1.1.1	The instability of my computer has been bugging me for a while now .	St
1.1.2	Computer specs : Inter i7 920 ( not overclocked ) , Gigabyte 4890 Factory overclocked , Asus P6T , 6Gigs G-power ( or smth like that ) 1600Megahertz , and an iCute case .	St
1.1.3	My computer handles games quite well offline , but whenever I go online in games like : Battlefield 2 , and Battlefield Bad Company 2 , my computer crashes within 20 minutes ( btw , i use lan cable , not wireless ) .	St
1.1.4	I think the source of my grief is my Graphics card , as once , directly after it had crashed , i reached my hand inside my case , and felt the air around different areas of the case , and suspected that the graphics card was overheating .	St
1.1.5	This was confirmed when my fingers brushed against it 's scalding ( -ish ) hot metal .	St
1.1.6	My graphics card was already underclocked then , ( for an 4890 ) , with 750 clock and 950 memory .	St
1.1.7	Another interesting point is that when i used gpuz , the clock speed showed up as 900 for a second , before plummeting to 240 .	St
1.1.8	Can anyone tell me what is happening	Ques
1.2.1	What did you do when you found that hot board ?	Ques
1.2.2	You did n't say .	St
1.3.1	That 's a good question What should i do ?	Ques
1.3.2	btw , i did a test with GPUZ , and i found temperatures as high as 90-95C	St
1.4.1	1 .	St
1.4.2	Talk to the machine 's maker about the issue .	St
1.4.3	2 .	St
1.4.4	Try leaving the cover off .	St
1.4.5	3 .	St
1.4.6	Add a fan to put cooler air to the area that 's hot .	St
1.4.7	Now I ca n't tell if it worked OK before but if so , some folk install other than stock GPU speed control apps and the issues begin .	St
1.4.8	So no history ?	Ques
1.4.9	4 .	St
1.4.10	Get some fresh compound and refresh all heat sink contact areas .	St
1.4.11	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks bob , I 'll try those	St
1.6.1	yes , no history	Res
1.7.1	Gaming in any form is going to push your system .	St
1.7.2	You already know that the video card is hot , so attack that issue .	St
1.7.3	Also , the exhaust of heat build-up is important as well to help overall cooling .	St
1.7.4	If none of Robert 's tips help , then use direct better cooling of the video card by replacing its fan setup ( HSF ) or replace entirely and use & quot ; water cooling & quot ; .	St
1.7.5	The whole point being that cooling is so much a consideration now , you ca n't leaver it out .	St
1.7.6	Plus , prolonged playing will be a key issue as persistent hi-temps sooner or later find the weakest link and crash a system or worst start to destroy it .	St
1.7.7	If you fix the system now and it works for a longer time , then one of the above needs to be revisited and upgraded yet again to better handle the situation .	St
1.7.8	Understand , continued use of the system where it will crash or not last as long is a clue that it reached its peak of sustainability , thus more $ and/or cooling tips are required .	St
1.7.9	FYI- Just look at any decent pre-build PC offered for gaming , what it entails .	St
1.7.10	These are not basic systems anymore .	St
1.7.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.8.1	Thanks willy , but I discovered a different problem Following bob 's suggestions , I opened my case , pointed a fan at it , as well as cleaned my gpu fan + heatsink a bit ( they were coated with dust ) .	St
1.8.2	Now moments before the crash , the highest temperature I see is less than 80 , however , the GPU Load ( btw i 'm still using gpuz only ) is at a constant 100 .	St
1.8.3	What should I do now ?	Ques
1.8.4	Btw , my gpu is a Gigabyte Factory overclocked 4890 ( GV-R489OC-1GD ) , which is now left at it 's original speed , so no more underclocking	St
1.9.1	With the clogged vents and the high temps these chips and boards age badly .	St
1.9.2	You may want to start thinking about replacing this card .	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	Hopefully , it 's only the worst case scenario	St
1.11.1	As I noted , you have to revisit the problem .	St
1.11.2	The video side has become the weakest link .	St
1.11.3	Even , if you clean it well , a & quot ; very fine dust & quot ; still coats the video card and only a true liquid cleaning with alcohol , etc .	St
1.11.4	will do or use of & quot ; electronic cleaner & quot ; .	Ques
1.11.5	Even so , the damage maybe already done and is too late .	St
1.11.6	Heat stress though not apparent is seen when repeated hi-end usage causes a faulty operation of all sorts to include crashes .	St
1.11.7	In most cases , replacing the video card is the fix AND must now include the newer and better cooling fixes , otherwise you will revisit the problem again .	St
1.11.8	Afterall , you did OC the video card and now you see the results of a & quot ; shorter service life & quot ; .	St
1.11.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.12.1	How many case fans are you running to reduce the heat load ?	Ques
1.12.2	VAPCMD	St
1.13.1	I use a cheap iCute case , with a slow , but large fan on the side , and a small fan at the front of the case , which sucks in air Thought it 'd be alright cus i have a CPU fan ( Coolermaster Hypern N520 ) which expelled heat from the case in the same direction as if another case fan was present	St
1.14.1	NIL	St
1.15.1	Coolermaster 750	St
1.16.1	for the moment .	St
1.16.2	Suggest checking the GPU fan speed settings ( should be SW that can adjust fan settings ) to make sure it 's operating at a high enough speed/RPM to remove the heat .	St
1.16.3	Next I 'd remove the GPU , then remove the GPU HS Fan , clean/remove the thermal paste , reapply new thermal paste , reassemble and reinstall the GPU .	St
1.16.4	Post temp results .	St
1.16.5	I 'd also suggest adding another case fan to intake cool air into the case .	St
1.16.6	VAPCMD	St
1.17.1	If you want to try avoiding replacing that card , do the DOLLAR work .	St
1.17.2	Example at http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=THERMAL-GREASE1-5 & cat=FAN Want to upgrade that ?	Ques
1.17.3	3 bucks then .	Sug
1.17.4	http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=AS-MTX-25G & cat=FAN Bob	Ques
1.18.1	NIL	St
1.19.1	The heatsink is as hot as the card , the heat is passing from the card quite flawlessly It 's just why does it produce so much heat	St
1.20.1	I think the overheating card has aged and needs replacement .	St
1.20.2	But for 1 to 3 bucks I would try this before I replaced the card .	St
1.20.3	It also gives me the chance to clean those heat sinks .	St
1.20.4	Bob	St
1.21.1	NIL	St
1.22.1	Could n't hurt to try thanks	Polite
