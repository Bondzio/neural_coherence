make sure what you have.. did you have a modem only (only have one port).. or a modem router (have more than one port.. usually 4).. try to connect your new router to the modem (or to the router if you already have one before) follow the instruction on installing the router.. if you already have a router (with your modem) then disable the dhcp on the new router ... and change the default ssid name.. do not configure any security yet.. after that you need to update the router firmware... (downloaded from linksys website) then try to connect your new inspiron... if it is connected and you can browse the internet.. you might want to try the security setting... one step at a time.. now look and choose, how you should connect the devices.. modem --&gt; wireless router --&gt; pc's (wired or wireless) modem router -- wireless router --&gt; pc's (wired or wireless)
