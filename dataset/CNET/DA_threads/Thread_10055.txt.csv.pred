1.2.1	it'll play everything the 1600pro can at about the same speed.	St
1.2.2	the 1650pro is faster but not fast enough to justify the extra expense.	St
1.2.3	and the 512mb won't make a bit of difference with these cards.	St
1.2.4	don't pump cash into obsolete agp technology.	St
1.3.1	HI ramarc, I am upgrading from a ATI Raden 9200 SE 128 Mb so I will certainly see the difference.	St
1.3.2	You are absolutely right why spend extra $$$$ when I will probably upgrade the whole system next year, PCI-e needs a new MOBO, mmmm a new chip mmmmm all a bunch of new goodies ..... lollllllllll Thanks a million $$$$$$ again for your input, it was the kick in the butt I needed.	St
