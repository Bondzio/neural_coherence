1.1.1	I have been satisfied with my Linksys CM100 cable modem and Linksys WRT54G wireless router ( about 22 mbs down and 1 mbs up ) .	St
1.1.2	Security settings were pretty straightforward , and the setup worked well with HomeDNS for my WEBCams in my old Dell E520 XP system .	St
1.1.3	Last night we had a power surge that fried the computer and the cable modem .	St
1.1.4	I got a temporary replacement modem , but apparently the wireless router was also hit , so I will have to replace both .	St
1.1.5	My question is whether there is any reason to move to a more modern system or possibly a combo modem/router .	St
1.1.6	Someone recommended a Motorola SBG 6580 , but I 'm wondering if I would likely see any real improvement in performance , and whether I would just be asking for setup headaches .	St
1.1.7	Right now I am leaning towards trying to find identical replacements , but I would welcome any suggestions .	St
1.1.8	& lt ; div & gt ; & lt ; div & gt ; Charles & lt ; /div & gt ; & lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.2.1	I was also looking at the Linksys E1200 or E2000 or E4200 as a replacement for the WRT54G .	St
1.2.2	Would one of these be a more modest upgrade ?	Ques
1.3.1	First question would be does your ISP use or plan to use DOCSIS3 .	St
1.3.2	You fried modem does not support this .	St
1.3.3	Of course you also have to ask if they charge extra to use this feature .	St
1.3.4	If all your equipment is G band then you will see little difference in any of the linksys routers you mention .	St
1.3.5	The primary difference is if you need wired gig ( streaming HD video INSIDE your house would be a example ) , or if you need to run on the 5ghz band ( your PC would need a wireless card that was compatible ) .	St
1.3.6	Do you buy a combo router/modem is a tougher question .	St
1.3.7	It will generally be cheaper to buy a combo but your selection of feature and brands is somewhat limited .	St
1.3.8	You also of course would need to replace the unit if you changed technology say to DSL , FIOS , UVERSE .	St
1.3.9	Since the amount of money is not huge I would go for separate units since you can pick the features that meet your needs the best .	St
1.4.1	The SBG6580 is a combo modem/wireless router which means if one side goes out you replace the whole thing .	St
1.4.2	If you like the Mororola modems why not go with a stand alone modem like the SB 6120 or SB 6121 modem , they are all DOCSIS 3.0 and then get a stand alone N wireless router .	St
1.4.3	If your IP is Comcast and you are in a DOCSIS 3.0 area you will see a improvement because you will have 4 bonded channels down which gives you more constant speeds .	St
1.4.4	You may end up spending a little more , initially , but I have heard they have problems with the combo units	St
