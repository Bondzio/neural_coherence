It worked wonderfully for about a month, then yesterday it stopped working. My computer took longer than usual to boot, and nothing would display (the monitor wouldn't detect any input). After messing around with the internal components (reinserting my RAM, Graphics card, etc.), i still get the same issue. However, when i start up my computer without the graphics card, it boots perfectly, but it runs off my stock graphics card, which doesn't perform at the level i would like it to. Basically, i found the issue to be my current graphics card. My question is, is there a way to fix my existing one, or would i need to spring for a new card? Thanks in advance.

Also, you didn't mention uninstalling and re-installing your driver software for your video card. If you haven't done so already, uninstall your video card driver and go to Nvidia's website to get the latest available driver (if that one didn't cause the problem in the first place).
