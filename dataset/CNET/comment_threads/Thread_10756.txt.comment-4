they are not the most reliable, since a friend of mine has a acer laptop with vista and has had nothing but major issues, so he bought a hp nettop, and another of my friends has a acer desktop and hes had nothing but major issues with it as well, considering acer scrimped on the ram by giving him only 1GB of ram and a single core athlon 64 for windows vista basic, and they also gave him aero on basic, so that further magnified his issues, so i would look at hp or dell, and nothing else, since other companies don't have the reliablity of dells and hps.
