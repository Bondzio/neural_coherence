<s> I just bought a bundled computer a couple days ago and the monitor is an eMachines 17&quot; flat CRT. </s>
<s> When you look at the items on the desktop they jump left to right like they are shaking and the clock does the same thing along with the icons in the system tray. </s>
<s> Actually everything shakes. </s>
<s> Sometimes it's not noticeable but others its very noticeable. </s>
<s> Should I try and see if they will replace it or is this normal? </s>
<s> I have never had any sort of flat panel monitor and don't know if this is common. </s>
<s> NO, that's not normal. </s>
<s> Excluding any RF source or outside influence, the monitor should be as solid as a rock. </s>
<s> Since, this is new, start the warranty process, the quick way is return to source of purchase as usually you have 15-30days, no questions(God only knows) asked, maybe return the whole system if they get lippy. </s>
<s> Then settle for a better system or whole replacement system or just the monitor to make you happy, otherwise accept your money back. </s>
<s> Don't waste time good luck -----Willy </s>
