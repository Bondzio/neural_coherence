I am NOT a Techinal person when it comes to computers. I can't tell you what the difference between a gigabit and a megabit is. LOL When I have a question I have to get my kids to come and help me! It is sad I know. But I am wanting to buy my kids Notebooks or netbooks for christmas. I have two 15 yr old boys and an 8 yr old girl. They will all get their own. My question is can they use a netbook with a wireless printer to print school assignments. Can I block their computer somehow so they don't get on adult websites? and last question...i have a internet card for my laptop...will they be able to pickup that signal on their netbooks? or will i have to go to a wireless motum? they are smart as can be on computers but I do not allow them on my computer, because it is for work not their games. Thanks for your help!

It's hardly imagineable somebody would buy one as their primary machine. But it's nice if you go backpacking and want to check your mail, provided you can find a hotspot for the Internet access. Most netbooks come with Windows XP, although you might find others with Linux or Windows 7. So to answer your questions: 1. Yes, you can use it with a wireless printer (provided it has a driver for the OS on the netbook). 2. Yes, you can use the same parental control options as on your own laptop. That's totally independent of the hardware. But don't expect too much from that. 3. A wireless modem/router is a very good thing to use to connect to the Internet from 2 or 3 or 4 laptops simultaneously. Kees
