no, not really, this is cuz some hardware specs cannot be changed e.g uni.
shader, gtx has128, gts has 96. that aint really poss.
to oc, although you do realize there is a limit how far you can actuallt oc.
you will get improved performance but i reallly dont thing youll match the gtx by just ocing!
