After changing to a wireless connection with Belkin router and network card I had no end of trouble sharing files. I got into no end of a mess trying to make it work, and eventually couldn't even access some folders on one machine on or off the network. I took my usual step when nothing else seems to work and formatted both machines and started again. Making sure they both had the same workgroup names was all I needed to do other than running the XP network &quot;wizard&quot; to make it all work perfectly. I concluded there must have been some conflict with the original wired setup.
