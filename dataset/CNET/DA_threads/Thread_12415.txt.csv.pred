1.1.4	How can i get windows to load and install programs on the E drive so there is plently of room.	Ques
1.1.5	Is there any advantages to the way it is set up now.	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks for your help.	Polite
1.2.1	This is a quite ridiculous setup, that won't last long to break down.	St
1.2.2	Back to your mate and let him redo it.	St
1.2.3	He should use Windows XP setup to delete both partitions and then create a new one covering the whole 604 GB disk and install XP on that.	Sug
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	That setup was for them and not you.	St
1.3.2	I'd heard many reasons why to do such a thing but to saddle a new user with such an onerous setup is just not nice.	St
1.3.3	Do it over.	St
