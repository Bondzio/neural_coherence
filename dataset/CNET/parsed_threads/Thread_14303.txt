<s> I have a wireless home network. </s>
<s> My internet service was down for 4 days. </s>
<s> After the comcast technician repaired the cables, I was able to get my desktop back on the internet, but not the laptop. </s>
<s> My desktop is wired to the netgear router, and my laptop is wireless. </s>
<s> My laptop IS connected to the network. </s>
<s> I am able to share the printer as before. </s>
<s> I originally used my laptop to set up the router and network. </s>
<s> Very frustrated, please help. </s>
<s> This my first time posting, and I'm not sure if this is enought information. </s>
<s> Control Panel -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Connections Tab LAN settings Make sure all the boxes are unchecked. </s>
<s> It sometimes will revert to Proxy Settings if there is no internet when you tried to connect. </s>
<s> After being able to connect with a network cable, and then also with a USB adapter, I'm pretty sure it's the wireless card in my laptop. </s>
<s> I will soon give Dell a call. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I use a cable modem and also have a wireless connection to the internet for my laptop, using a Netgear router connected to my desktop computer. </s>
<s> Everytime my ISP changes the IP address, I lose my internet connection on the laptop. </s>
<s> I have been unplugging the router and when I plug it in again my connection is restored. </s>
<s> Is there a setting that can be changed in order to prevent this from happening to me???? </s>
<s> Can the instructions you gave (Control Panel -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Connections Tab LAN settings Make sure all the boxes are unchecked. </s>
<s> It sometimes will revert to Proxy Settings if there is no internet when you tried to connect. </s>
<s> ), apply to my situation, too? </s>
<s> I appreciate your help with this. </s>
<s> It's been driving me crazy. </s>
<s> My ISP was no help and basically blamed it on the router. </s>
<s> I have been searching everywhere for a simple answer to this, but even when I did find an article that might apply, it was too technical for me to understand. </s>
<s> Thank you.......Gina </s>
<s> After spending two and a half hours on the phone with Dell tech support, the problem was resolved by scaling down some of the security I had set to protect my network. </s>
<s> (64 bit instead of 128 bit WEP for one thing). </s>
<s> He told me that the Dell draft N wireless mini-card in my laptop may have compatiblility issues with a Netgear router. </s>
<s> (I had no problems at all until the comcast lines were cut by the Direct TV installers)! </s>
<s> At any rate, he made me cut back on the encryption level, and now I'm back on line. </s>
<s> Ah--My laptop happens to be a Dell as well!! </s>
<s> Were you also getting disconnected when your ISP changed your IP number, or were you having a problem connecting all of the time? </s>
<s> As I mentiond earlier, the only time I have a problem is when my ISP changes the IP number every few days. </s>
<s> That makes me wonder if my solution could possibly be as simple as changing a setting--but if so, which setting??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> It should be Cable &gt; Cable modem &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Wired desktop or Cable &gt; Cable modem &gt; Wireless Router If it's connected like this, your settings for your wireless router should NOT change. </s>
<s> If you have it hooked up like this: Cable &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Cable modem &gt; wired desktop or Cable &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Cable modem This is wrong! </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> Thank you Rick! </s>
<s> I am 99% sure mine does go: Cable &gt; Wireless Router &gt; Cable modem &gt; wired desktop, because I believe that's how the instructions said to do it! </s>
<s> I am going to redo the connections as you suggested. </s>
<s> Will I also have to change any settings because of this setup change, or should changing the connection order alone do the trick?? </s>
<s> Thank you again! </s>
<s> I will be so happy to get this pesky problem corrected! </s>
