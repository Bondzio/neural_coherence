I have lost a couple of flash drives and need to find a more efficient way to store my data where I can access from anywhere in the world. I would appreciate any help! Thanks again!

While interesting I wonder why they relied on just one place to keep what they didn't want to lose. In their case a 10 cent CDR copy would have saved them. Point? Their photos weren't worth 10 cents.

After that you can pay for 50GB. Works with Mac, Windows & Linux. I've been using it for a few weeks now and am very impressed!
