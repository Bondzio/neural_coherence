<s> I have two 80 gb hard drives. </s>
<s> I've been thinking about using one just for my pictures,gif's,video,and music. </s>
<s> Hoping that they would be safer on a seperate drive. </s>
<s> Is this idea valid or not, and are there any other better ways to protect my files, other than the fact that I must back up my files. </s>
<s> I do use an antivirus program and firewall,and don't download anything questionable. </s>
<s> The most common reason for dataloss still remains the &quot;delete&quot; key. </s>
<s> Usually done in the small hours of the morning or due to a non-booting PC which someone installs the OS in hope of regaining access. </s>
<s> Go ahead but keep in mind that it's not a backup. </s>

<s> I have four drives and 8 partitions between them, one of which I partitioned about 9GB for C: and I used my D: drive to install all programs. </s>
<s> Another disk is partitioned for MP3s, another for Photos and another partitioned for Downloads only. </s>
<s> I named another drive/partition &quot;Resources&quot; and I keep copies of XP PRO (the entire CD) and XP OFFICE and other data/files from other computers, etc. </s>
<s> It is always a good idea to NOT use the entire C:\ for the operating system AND your programs because if it crashes then you are risking losing all your programs and data, etc.. </s>
<s> If you partition enough room for the root drive (C:) and install programs, etc., on other drives/partitions, you will not lose as much. </s>
