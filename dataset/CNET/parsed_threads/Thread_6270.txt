<s> Motherboards come with a BIOS version already stored in its flash ROM. </s>
<s> You usually don't necessarily have to update the BIOS on a new motherboard. </s>
<s> Sometimes you do, but that is only when the motherboard BIOS is older than some new version of a component, such as to accommodate a new CPU family. </s>
<s> You can check the motherboard mfg. </s>
<s> site for new BIOS versions for the motherboard and what the update does. </s>
<s> Download the latest version from a working computer and put it on a floppy. </s>
<s> The procedure for installing the new BIOS version is in your motherboard manual and usually described on the website from which you downloaded the newer BIOS version. </s>
<s> In general, you have to start your computer and enter the BIOS settings menu to update the BIOS. </s>
<s> Alternatively, some BIOS'es are updated by booting to a floppy with a program that updates the BIOS. </s>
<s> Again, check the documentation that came with the motherboard and the BIOS update. </s>
<s> After you have updated the motherboard BIOS and safely exited the BIOS settings (or the BIOS installation program), turn off your computer. </s>
<s> Turn on your computer, quickly place the OS installation CD into the CD drive, and follow the procedure in the OS installation program that automatically runs. </s>
