i too have had intermittant problems with the otherwise fantastic scanner.
my issue is that occassionally i get colored bars that run parallel to the long (width) of the slide.
i have yet to find its cause and a consistant method of fixing the problem.
the4se bar may cover the entire slide or may show only a few in varried positions, but always apparllel along the width.
ibm t43 with 1gb ram and 80 gb hd in windows explorer professional.
is there as help out there on this matter?
