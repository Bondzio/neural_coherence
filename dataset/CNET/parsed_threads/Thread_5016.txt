<s> i have an apple Ibook G4. </s>
<s> i am trying to run the smackbook program on it. </s>
<s> i get all the way through the process until it comes time to change out the line of code in the &quot;smack.pl&quot; file. </s>
<s> once i change it, i run the terminal correctly, and it says that there are a few errors, but it doesnt say how to fix them. </s>
