I recently bought a Hauppauge 1178 WinTV-HVR-1600 ( [L=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGGTY8] http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGGTY8 [/L] ) and opened it to then find out it only supports HD from over the Air broadcasts (ATSC.) I'm looking for a TV tuner that can watch and record in HD from my comcast cable Box. I have HD comcast cable box, and I want to be able to watch and record from that source on my computer, As I do not have a HD TV, and my computer is all I have that is capable of playing HD. (1900*1200 res) Are there any TV tuner cards that I can put in my pc that will let me do this?

If you could receive HD/digital broadcasts (cable or satellite) on your PC, could you not therefore save the digital movie and therefore burn that digital movie? What might an unscrupulous person do with that DVD?

It's being broadcast on TV... Are you saying that with HDTV, companies are not allowing people to record HDTV shows?

But recording the digital signal and burning that signal would rival a DVD quality movie. That could be construed as piracy. HDTV can be recorded on a DVR or such. But the encryption is limited to the recorder. Recording HDTV to a computer is highly discouraged. Look around if you like. I have. There are many video cards with HDMI and/or DVI OUTPUT. HDMI or DVI INPUT are nonexistent. If you find one, email me.

Watching live HD does not seem to be as much of a problem as recording it. The Hauppauge HD PVR 1212 is also supposedly capable of recording component outputs but is not a card.
