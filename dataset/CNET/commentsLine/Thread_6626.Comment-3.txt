that depends on what you copy.
if you choose to copy files that already exist on the target drive, they will be copied again.
so it's totally up to you.
of course, there's backup software that you can use to copy only changed or new files.
your choice to use them or not to use them.
did you already know that external drives are much less reliable than internal drives.
if you don't believe me count the number of posts in our storage forum about the theme &quot;i can't access my external drive&quot;.
so it's essential to have more copies of your data (for example, burned to dvd) than just on such a drive.
you say &quot;move&quot;; that means they are no longer on your internal hard disk.
otherwise you should have said &quot;copy&quot;.
that's an essential difference!
let me hope that you choose the wrong word, not the wrong action.
