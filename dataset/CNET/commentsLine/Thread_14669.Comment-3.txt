i apologize if i gave you the wrong idea, but the computers will all be used in the same location with the same monitor keyboard mouse and desk.
my point about them being in 3 different locations is simply that whatever solutions are proposed will have to be portable to be viable.
not looking for vpn, remote acces, etc, just a simple switch that i can control 3 pcs with.
right now i have my mac hooked up to the lcd at home if i hit the 2 button on the kvm the display switches to my win7 desktop machine, but i have to unplug the mouse &amp; keyboard and plug them into the desktop (therein lies the problem).
