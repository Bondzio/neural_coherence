You'll have to pick which Operating system you are using then it will take you to the proper download page. http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?product=305364&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&submit.y=9&submit.x=4&lang=en&cc=us I followed the link through using XP as my operating system of choice and it looks like there is only a driver but no software. There is a link to order a new CD Rom directly below the driver if you want a new disk.
