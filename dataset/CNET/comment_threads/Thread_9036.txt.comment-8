I read your first post and read it as if the printer was on the machine that changed from wifi to ethernet.
Sorry but that's me reading your post and it wasn't clear the printer was on a desktop.
Ok, if it still prints over wifi then the most likely is the old firewall issues.
I don't help with firewall configurations with step by steps since there are dozens out there but look at allowing all your LAN access to the server.
I don't see the router IP as the issue here.
