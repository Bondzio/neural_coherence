<s> Hi, This is the first time I'm writing here. </s>
<s> Recently, I encountered an astonishing problem. </s>
<s> I'm completely dumbfounded and clueless. </s>
<s> So any help is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Now, the issue: Whenever I install RAM in DIMM B1&B2 the system doesn't boot up. </s>
<s> I tried other RAMs and nothing changed. </s>
<s> This problem occured suddenly. </s>
<s> I mean I was working with computer and next time I turned it on, computer stopped working. </s>
<s> Here is what I have done so far: 1) update BIOS 2) nearly every single steps in this topic : http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/ [...] -installed Thanks in advance, </s>
<s> Since no details are available the usual to try next is go back to what worked. </s>
<s> If that works then you get a set of RAM from Crucial and try again. </s>

<s> I'd try what they did. </s>
<s> My thought still applies as we don't have the details to work with yet. </s>
