My system is a general off the shelf systme form compusa running windows XP using an AMD Athalon 2600+ w/ 512 meg of Ram and an ATI x800 pro video card but here is my problem. THis is my first &quot;install it yourself&quot; job and I cannot find the drivers for this thing. When ever I pop in a DVD it suddenly thinks it is a CD drive not a DVD drive. I have the correct firmwire (as far as I know) but am not sure aobut the drivers or why the Drive is having self esteem problems when I give it a DVD to read. It will read audio CDs fine and data CDs are slower than in my CD combo drive. Anyone have a solution to my DVD drive woes?

You only get DVD playback when you run DVD player software and recording when you run recording software. The ID of CD, DVD and such is a cosmetic issue that Microsoft doesn't seem to have fixed yet. Hope this helps, Bob

If none, then goto the support website of Rosewell products, you should at least get thier latest device drivers for that model DVD. While WMP(win. media player) will play DVDs, it isn't always the default player, if not then select it as the pgm. to do so, if it never did, then something is amiss. Get a free version of some media player for DVDs. I tried VLC from: http://www.videolan.org with success. Offhand, I think you got a s/w issue for now. tada -----Willy
