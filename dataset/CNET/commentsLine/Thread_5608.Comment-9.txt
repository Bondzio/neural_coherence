firstly, its impossible to build a computer to pre-empt unreleased games secondly, directx 10 was made obslete at the announcement/release of directx 10.1, not to mention that game development for the pc has become questionable at best (due to the popularity and equality of consoles, contrasted to the massive performance delta between the average pc and the performance pc).
thirdly, nvidia and ati are planning to release new graphics processors in about 5 or 6 months, replacing geforce 8 and radeon hd 2xxx.
also, theres no real advantage to having a creative card (don't really care what anand says) over integrated audio, in regards to quality, performance, etc
