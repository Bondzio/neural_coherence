<s> Hi, I have a Store 'n' Go USB 1GB that I bought a while ago, I have problem opening the disk so, I had to format it. </s>
<s> The system keeps telling me that the drive is copy protected on windows XP, and the files on the drive are copy protected and it is read-only files and I should have read help files on how to deal with read-only files on Windows Vista Ultimate. </s>
<s> However, I am unable to see if there are any files on the drive nor to open it or use it for anything. </s>
<s> I have tried to format it on different computers, different operating systems, and using the C-command, no progress I still got the same response. </s>
<s> The formation process was using the Default Allocation , 1024, and quick and normal format. </s>
<s> No progress. </s>
<s> Help me, I need to reformat it and just reuse it. </s>
<s> http://www.verbatim.com.au/products.cfm?productID=95229 You have to ask them how to turn it into a normal MSC USB device if you want to format it. </s>

<s> I already e-mail them few days ago, but no response yet. </s>
<s> Their US website sucks.. tehy have not techsupport nor helpful information for techsuport. </s>
<s> Thanks though </s>
<s> http://www.sandisk.com/Retail/Default.aspx?CatID=1415 as noted by http://kristagrothoff.wordpress.com/2006/08/24/removing-u3-and-associated-bundled-software-from-the-sandisk-cruzer-micro-usb-flash-drive/ is a good read. </s>
<s> You need such a tool from your U3 Drive's maker to kick all that out and start over. </s>
<s> I did see a Launchpad update at their site so if the drive is loopy, update that and try again. </s>
<s> Next? </s>
<s> Read http://www.u3.com/uninstall/ Bob </s>
<s> the flashdrive is Verbatim, not Sandisk... however, their techsupport is not really bad and is not helpful at all. </s>
<s> anyother suggestions? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> it is a Verbatim flashdrive, not a Sandisk. </s>
<s> any more suggestions, please? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> I was giving guidance and not tech support. </s>
<s> I noted the links so you could learn more about U3 and the last link was from the U3 themselves to uninstall such. </s>
<s> Sorry about that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Dear Bob, I was not blaming you and there is nothing to be sorry about. </s>
<s> However, the links you have sent to me was just useful, but it was not addressing my problem-although I have tried them. </s>
<s> thanks though. </s>
<s> could I use a specific partition software besides to DiskKill? </s>
<s> Once I've removed the U3 software I've used the HP formating tool (even on non HP sticks!) </s>
<s> to format the stick. </s>
<s> But there's the Linux way so let's do that. </s>
<s> http://pendrivelinux.com/ has a variety of LiveCDs to choose from and at http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/05/16/usb-pendrivelinux-install-tutorial/ we see how to use FDISK to partition our USB stick. </s>
<s> I don't offer tutorials in the forums since that usually duplicates content on the web. </s>
<s> But I do try to point at solutions I've used before. </s>
