I've tried via the Image zone as well as the so-called Solution center but without success. Does anybody have a real solution??! Any help gratefully received! Borrius

I think you can do the same with most photo editing programs. The only problem is if you take a small picture and try to blow it up too big the quality of the print goes down.

Thanks for finding a solution for me (can't imagine how they managed to make HP Image Zone so user unfriendly. Anyway am very pleased that at last I can perform such an apparently simple (but in practice difficult) task. Thanks again.
