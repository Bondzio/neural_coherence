i also can only run on standard vga.
the card is running on an abit fatality mainboard aa8xe sys: p4 3.8 1gig ddr2 @675mhz win xp home with sp2 160gig sata bassically if i install the drivers from the cd that came with the card, the system boots up but then the hole system locks up and the screen goes off (blank).
sometimes i can get into windows, but again as soon as i try and do anything with the mouse (cliking start for instance) the same occurs.
i have reflashed bios with the latest from abit and have upto date dxd.
