1. portability 2. big projection, otherwise i preferred a regular tv.
the bad part about projectors are; the good one are very expensive also the great screens are also very expensive (and i don't think $500 budget will do).
of course a white wall would do (but crappie).
personally i probably look for a 32&quot;-40&quot; tv instead.
what your reason/s for the projector?
