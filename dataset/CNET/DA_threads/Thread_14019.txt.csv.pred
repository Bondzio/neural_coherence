1.1.1	I can't pick between the D-Link DI-624 and the Linksys WRT54GS for my wireless router....LapTop Magizine rates the D-Link as the Top performer out of the wireless routers they tested....however I have my wired network on linksys parts and have liked their service and support.... *Question is*: Would it be better to go with D-Link, on its performance rating, then hook up the computers with matching D-Link or other company adpaters *OR* Go with Linksys and matching Linksys adpaters making the network on all one company's product, hoping to gain performance this way?

1.1.2	Thanks for the advice	Ques
1.2.1	That usually pays off if you use some &quot;plus&quot; feature offered by one or the other maker.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Support from the manufacturer is much easier when dealing solely with their product.	St
1.3.2	The only issue I have found in mixing D-Link and Linksys is in having to change the default IP address used (D-link likes to use 192.168.0.1, while Linksys uses 192.168.1.1).	St
