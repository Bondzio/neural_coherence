1.1.1	So a few months ago I upgraded my RAM to 3GB, my power supply to 600w, and put in a Diamond Viper Radeon X1950 Pro (PCI-e, 512MB) card.	St
1.1.2	My problem is that there are games that I would like to buy...(ie: Gears of War, Crysis, BioShock etc...) however the box requirements list graphics cards for NVIDIA GeForce etc...and that's not what I have... so does anyone know what NVIDIA cards are = to what I have?	St
1.1.3	Mine does support Direct X 9.0 and I think even 10....	St
1.2.1	There is no issue here.	St
1.2.2	But it's not a Geforce...	St
1.3.1	I've wanted to play Gears & Bioshock since I saw it on the X-box... but I play PS3...	St
1.3.2	I figured it would come out on the PC eventually.... now if I can get my controller to work with it.	St
1.3.3	I assuming that World Conflict will also be ok then...	St
1.4.1	Your card is a radeon from ATI.	St
1.4.2	your card supports DX9 only.	St
