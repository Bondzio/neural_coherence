to begin where robert left off is to suggest too much has happened since the 500mhz system was current.
the newer p4 is more demanding plus any other devices to make it a happy medium.
its just better to get all new or any used that is capable.
but as mentioned what came with the old system may not cut it.
-or- shop for some oem that on its own merit provides a jumping point into p4 realm at a bargain, but you take what you get as oem provided.
look into a emachine or hp models.
of course that leaves compaq, gateway and ibm to consider as well, they're usually on sale on a regular basis.
the choice is yours... tada -----willy
