so i've been going around the internet for a couple hours now trying to find some decent ram that's compatible with my motherboard (asus m4a77td) what i'm looking for is something along the lines of 8-12gb 1600mhz ddr3 $60-$80 i have 4 slots available to use.
i just picked up 12gb of corsair vengeance ram only to find out that it won't work with what i have.
the other problem is that i've found a few items that do work with my asus but are all out of stock at tigerdirect, newegg, etc.
