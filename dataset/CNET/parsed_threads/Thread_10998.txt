<s> I have a LCD samsung syncmaster 930b monitor about 4 years. </s>
<s> The last few months when I turn it on it is really dark for about 1-2 minutes, then it's normal. </s>
<s> Now the last few days when I turn it on, it flickers for a few minutes, then it is normal again. </s>
<s> It's fine after it seems to warm up(?) </s>
<s> if that makes sense. </s>
<s> I read somewhere the backlight(?) </s>
<s> may be going out. </s>
<s> What is this and can I replace it myself? </s>
<s> Or is it best to say bye-bye to the monitor? </s>
<s> What else could it be? </s>
<s> It does the same on my other computer, so I know it's a problem with the monitor. </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice. </s>
