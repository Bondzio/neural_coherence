I just fixed a PC that belongs to a friend of mine.
Basically, I formatted the hard drive and reinstalled XP.
Though I don't know if the computer was slow before, it's slow now.
Well, it's slow when there are webpages involving flash, and slow when I try to resize any window.
I have narrowed down the problem components to the processor and video.
I wonder if the slowness is due to the Intel Celeron Socket 478 @ 1.73GHz, or could it be the Integrated SIS 650 graphics?
I'm leaning towards the graphics being the culprit.
What do you think?
