1.1.1	I am looking to purchase Elder Scrolls: Oblivion and it is time to upgrade my ATI Radeon 9200 128 MB to something a little more powerful.	St
1.1.2	My motherboard only has an AGP slot and I have somewhat narrowed it down to these video cards: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1782292&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1240195&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1460940&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1240060&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 All of these ones are 256 MB NVIDIAs.	St
1.1.3	I am leaning towards the first one from PNY the 6800 GS.	St
1.1.4	I also found some 128 MB ones for a similar price: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1182887&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1121824&Tab=0&NoMapp=0 I'm thinking that 256 MB is gonna be better than 128 MB or is that not always true.	St
1.1.5	Anyway if anyone can help me choose a good one (either from these or another one) it would be much appreciated	Ques
1.2.1	...then get the best card that will fit in your budget.	St
1.2.2	definitely get 256mb.	St
1.2.3	here's my pecking order for AGP cards $200 or less: $205: geforce 6800gs $170: radeon X800gto $120: radeon x1600pro	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	My budget is around $200, but I definitely wouldn't be averse to getting something decent for cheaper.	St
1.5.1	unless you're planning on playing elder scrolls at 1600x1200 or on a 19&quot; widescreen, they'll all do just fine.	St
1.5.2	they'll be a big stepup from a 9200.	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	since u r using ati...wouldnt want to cause u trouble by switching here is a link to a decent card...it will be a huge improvement over the 9200 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102666	St
1.8.1	Well I think I might end up going with the PNY geforce 6800 gs 256 MB one found here: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1782292&CatId=0 The only other ones I can find that are similar to what people have mentioned are these: http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2111221&CatId=0 (this one is large but I could probably fit it in my case if I took out my useless dial-up modem card) http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1904065&Tab=11&NoMapp=0 (a little more expensice than the others, also for the x-series of ATI cards, is a lower number a better card, as opposed to how it was with the 9000 series where a larger number was better) http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1892411&CatId=0 (Again a little more expensive, but is it any better?)	St
1.8.2	Also being in Canada I can't order anything from newegg or zipzoomfly because they don't ship to Canada.	St
1.8.3	So I am pretty much stuck with Tigerdirect.ca, thought they do seem to have pretty reasonable prices) Any further help is appreciated.	St
1.9.1	...Are the two best AGP cards.	St
1.9.2	The only thing is that thte X850 is getting a little old, and it has no Piuxel Shader 3.	St
1.9.3	You'll make a good choice going with either of them.	St
