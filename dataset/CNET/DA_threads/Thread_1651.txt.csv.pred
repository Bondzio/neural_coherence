1.1.1	How important is the performance of your computer 's video card ?	Ques
1.1.2	-- It 's one of the most important hardware components of my system .	St
1.1.3	( Why is that ? )	Ques
1.1.4	-- Very important .	Polite
1.1.5	( Why is that ? )	Ques
1.1.6	-- Somewhat important .	St
1.1.7	( Why is that ? )	Ques
1.1.8	-- Not important at all .	St
1.1.9	( Why not ? )	Ques
1.1.10	-- I do n't understand the importance of my computer 's video card .	St
1.2.1	I 'm not a gamer and I do n't even usually watch videos on my multimedia PC , so video performance is good to have but hardly essential for me .	St
1.2.2	It 's a lot more important on my notebook , on which I do occasionally watch DVDs when traveling .	St
1.2.3	But , even then , it 's a lot less important than CPU speed , RAM , and HDD capacity .	St
1.3.1	I like to edit video and especially with HDV I have to have a decent video card.I have an older pc ( 1.8 ghz ) and could n't even begin to edit HDV without it.It also gives me a much needed second monitor .	St
1.4.1	Really , the entire question is somewhat meaningless unless you specify what the computer is being used for .	St
1.4.2	Gamers need the fastest , most powerful card available .	St
1.4.3	Servers need only minimal capabilities .	St
1.4.4	Most people can get by very well with the Video built into the motherboard , or fairly low-end boards .	St
1.5.1	I do a little video editing and some fairly-sophisticated perl and java animations of my own designs , and do these with the built-in video card on my ( 2GB , Athlon X2 ) system .	St
1.5.2	I suspect , but do n't really know , that the performance of both would be enhanced by a little better video card .	St
1.5.3	At heavy loads , the PC did not quite keep up with the animations till I added the second GB of memory , and I am thinking to go to even-more sophisticated animations in the future .	St
1.5.4	It 's hard for me to understand why anyone except an extreme gamer would need more than a $ 100 video adapter .	St
1.6.1	This is somewhat of a silly question , because the results of this poll do n't prove anything given that the & quot ; computer & quot ; is n't defined as to its kind or usage .	St
1.6.2	For a desktop PC being used to play video games , view and edit digital video , etc , most people would want the most powerful graphics card they could afford .	St
1.6.3	For a desktop PC being used to run business applications , a low-end graphics card -- or even an integrated graphics chipset -- would suffice .	St
1.6.4	And of course for a laptop , integrated chipset graphics are the way to go .	St
1.6.5	High-end graphics cards use a lot of power and generate a lot of heat , which would result in poor battery life , loud fan noise , and possible discomfort to the user .	St
1.6.6	Most people want a laptop primarily to run business applications , and would prefer long battery life and lower heat dissipation .	St
1.6.7	That is why the best quality laptops usually have very basic graphics capabilities .	St
1.7.1	It 's one of the most important hardware components of my system because we can only see what is on our monitor not which electron is going where inside our CPU !	St
1.8.1	The question ask how important is & quot ; your & quot ; video card and not & quot ; the & quot ; video card .	St
1.8.2	This automatically implies that it 's for your purposes and not just general ones .	St
1.9.1	Sorry , could n't resist throwing a Bart Simpson quip with the use of double negative .	St
1.9.2	I was surprised that my answer was not listed as an actual option on the polls above .	St
1.9.3	A request to the CNET Administrators - When you put the poll in the forums for discussions , please also include the link to the actual poll .	St
1.9.4	I chose to receive plain text newsletters and I ca n't actually exercise my vote anywhere because the link is not provided either in the newsletter or here .	St
1.10.1	and will suffice with integrated .	St
1.10.2	Graphics cards are important for gamers and if you work with graphics/modelling/3d animation for a living .	St
1.11.1	No really - thanks !	Polite
1.11.2	I dissect media headlines all the time !	St
1.12.1	I think you have to specify what the laptop or desktop computer will be used for .	St
1.12.2	If you are going to use it for multimedia or games , obviously a video card with more power is necessary .	St
1.12.3	Now if youre just after the browsing , you can settle for less .	St
1.13.1	I voted somewhat important .	St
1.13.2	I do n't play games or edit video so I do n't need the fastest thing out there .	St
1.13.3	I like to watch movies on my PC so I need something a little faster than the cheapest .	St
1.13.4	And I do n't like the video using my RAM either .	St
1.13.5	So I spend about $ 50.00 and for the most part I have been happy with what I get .	St
