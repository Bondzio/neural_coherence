1.1.1	I 've got a Maxtor Model # 2b020h1 20GB IDE hard drive that had a main board smoke show , complete with a melted chip .	St
1.1.2	I assume that the storage area is intact , and want to salvage data from the drive ( mostly photos ) , but data recovery services charge more than I can justify for what I 'll get back .	St
1.1.3	The drive is still under factory warranty , but that is just simple drive replacement , without data recovery .	St
1.1.4	I 've checked the web , and as the drives are basically obsolete , they are cheap and plentiful , which suggests the following question : What is involved in swapping the electrical components , while leaving the mechanical storage guts in place ?	Ques
1.1.5	Can I lift out the board and motor as a single assembly and swap , or does such a swap involve SMD 's ( which I 'm nor equipped to handle ) or some other other specialized process ?	Ques
1.1.6	I 'd also welcome any suggestions about an established repair service who could do that swap for a reasonable flat rate .	St
1.1.7	Thanks !	St

1.2.1	I may not be able to help much but it 's an interesting subject .	St
1.2.2	Another alternative would be to not replace the electric things but the disk .	St
1.2.3	Find an identical Maxtor HD , remove your disk and put it into the new one .	St
1.2.4	I do n't know how difficult that would be , but perhaps you could do it yourself .	St
1.2.5	I did something like that once but it was between two removable disk units .	St
1.2.6	It was something similar to Iomega zip-drives .	St
1.2.7	But a hard disk might be a little more complicated .	St
1.2.8	-	St
1.3.1	You do NOT want to open the case of a hard drive , they are put together in sealed rooms with no dust , opening one up will more than likely destroy any ability to recover the data from it .	St
1.3.2	A small bit of dust you ca n't even see is like a boulder under the heads of a hard drive .	St
1.3.3	Anyone replacing the PCB of a hard drive is taking a chance of losing all their data , which a recovery service may be able to get back .	St
1.4.1	My 2-cents ... You have a very good chance of having the HD work if you replace the PCB itself .	St
1.4.2	You do n't ever need to remove the HD cover , just the card .	St
1.4.3	While data can be recovered I consider more than a 50/50 chance of doing OK. Whatever made the pcb smoke in the 1st place can resurface , but usually these are the stepper or controller ICs burning up provided there is no physical internal disk damage will work with a pcb replacement .	St
1.4.4	-- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	This is true , we replaced a burnt out board with that of another identical drive and it worked a treat .	St
1.5.2	To be fair we did copy the data straight off and transfered it to another drive but it worked out much cheaper than data recovery .	St
1.5.3	Good luck .	Polite
