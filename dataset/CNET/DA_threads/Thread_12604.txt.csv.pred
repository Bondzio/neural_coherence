1.1.1	I just installed a new 120gb drive into my XP machine .	St
1.1.2	My old hard drive , which I copied to the new drive using Copy Commander , was a 13gb with only a few hundred mb of space left .	St
1.1.3	My problem is , the new drive is only being acknowledged as an almost full 13gb drive , My system is now slower than ever and acting exactly like it would with a very full hard drive .	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated !	Polite
1.1.5	!	St
1.2.1	Actually , I used Ghost 2002 ( an older version , but works with XP NTFS and all that ... ) to do the copy and if one was n't careful , the resulting partition would be the same as the old drive .	St
1.2.2	I do not have Copy Commander and it sounds like Copy Commander just copied the partitions as they were .	St
1.2.3	Try again ?	Ques
1.2.4	BOb	St
