<s> I just changed my Router from a Linksys to a D-Link, the Linksys went bad for some reason. </s>
<s> I have my computer hooked up to it and my sons in his room, I also had to format my Hard drive because I could not get into the set up utility of the roter to configure it for my DSL connection (PPPoE) I finally got it going and have Internet on both computers but my problem now is My computer can see his computer on the network, but his cant see mine, which means it can't see my printer for him to print to. </s>
<s> I have ran the Network set up wizard again, but it doesn't help. </s>
<s> I'm batting 1000 in finding that a new Dlink and other routers come with out of date FIRMWARE. </s>
<s> This, in my opinion is asking of the buyer of said device too much. </s>
<s> &quot;Hey, buy my router, but be sure to fix it before you use it. </s>
<s> Ok?&quot; Only after the firmware is uptodate would I attempt to fix the other issue. </s>
<s> And if you installed a firewall, then I don't expect it to work. </s>

<s> I have the same problem of comp. </s>
<s> 2 not &quot;seeing&quot; comp. </s>

<s> I'm asking because you said that you just format your HD... so, maybe you missed those step. </s>
<s> and did you run network setup wizard on his PC? </s>
<s> just a thought... Good Luck </s>
<s> Check your Workgroup name as well as setting something to share. </s>
<s> Then I might try Windows Search for Computer feature. </s>
<s> I had a similar problem with a Linksys router. </s>
<s> On the notebook, try checking the configuration of the network card. </s>
<s> Also, make sure that the WEP is not enabled until you can set your own key. </s>
<s> On the desktop, try reinstalling the software while the router is hooked-up to the computer. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
<s> Thanks for replying, Bob. </s>
<s> I am using Norton Pers. </s>
<s> Firewall on both machines. </s>
<s> both are configured the same. </s>
<s> Somewhere, I am probably missing a setting in XP Pro. </s>
<s> I've tried different firewalls with no luck. </s>
<s> I even borrowed a router and hardwired the two machines to the 'net. </s>
<s> I then tried wireless ad hoc between them with the same bad results. </s>
<s> Thanks for replying, JMack. </s>
<s> I am using a Linksys wireless usb adapter on comp. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Comp. </s>
<s> 1 is using an Asus pci board that has built in access point. </s>
<s> I have tried everything but using a different brand usb adapter. </s>
<s> Like I said, the only thing that doesn't work is that comp 2 can't see comp 1's files or printer. </s>
<s> NASA can network over millions of miles with their probes, but I can't reach across a room. </s>
<s> Bummer. </s>
<s> I even borrowed a router and hardwired the 2 comps together for net access. </s>
<s> I then tried ad hoc between the machines with the same results. </s>
<s> You've found a firewall and now need to decide what to do about it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If your son's computer can see its own shared files in My Network Places, then it is probably a firewall problem. </s>
<s> If your son's computer cannot see its own shared files in My Network Places, check this: Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Services to see that there are not any needed network services disabled. </s>
<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> I found a note that I left myself regarding some services that I wasn't using and had long ago disabled, including one that allowed the machine to share files. </s>
<s> Enabled, restarted, clicked on &quot;View workgroup computers&quot; in My Network Places, and there were the missing files. </s>
