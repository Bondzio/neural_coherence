<s> I am having some problems with my external HDD. </s>
<s> Lately, when I have tried to connect to any PC, I get an error message stating that the PC's USB port is experiencing a power surge of some kind and I am not able to get the HDD to start up. </s>
<s> I have tried using the USB cord from my printer but I still get the same error message. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me with this problem? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The bottom line is a patch is available for it. </s>
<s> It can be machine specific and you didn't tell much about the machine. </s>
<s> -&gt; Ask the machine maker for the patch. </s>

<s> My HDD is a Buffalo 120GB. </s>
<s> I live in Japan and bought the hard drive here. </s>
<s> I am not sure if Buffalo drives are sold in the US. </s>
<s> Could you point to where I find more info about the long discussion you mentioned or at least about the patch I should be looking for? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Not from the buffalo drive maker. </s>
<s> It's for the PC. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> It seems like I am not the only one having this problem. </s>
<s> I tried reading throught the posts but most of it was over my head. </s>
<s> I am using a Fujitsu FMV-820NUB laptop. </s>
<s> I am not sure if a patch or fix exists for that type of PC. </s>
<s> Is there any way to for me to patch or fix this problem? </s>
<s> Is there any kind of download from Microsoft? </s>
<s> If anyone can help me I would be most grateful </s>
<s> I've never had a problem with this one. </s>
<s> Everytime it's off to the board or system maker for the patch. </s>
<s> If you can't find the patch they you call the supplier and ask where it is. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
