The system will not run MS FLT SIM X Deluxe or any other Flt Sims I have, even in compatability mode, So I wouild like to know if I can fit my old 160 GB HDD from my previous PC (a Maxdata 3000 Mob Favorit) as a slave, or to be able to boot-up from, That has XP Home Edition, loaded &amp; all My Flt Sims but was only a 32 bit system, &lt;div&gt; I bought the emachines 1840 in January 2011 &amp; it has been returned twice due to faulty HDD's ? &lt;/div&gt;

Google this to get a tip of the iceburg view of the issues. Change motherboard and keep XP operating system. Your post makes me think you are beginning to learn about onboard graphics, cards and now this. Give yourself plenty of time! Bob

If both of the HDD's are SATA, you don't need to worry about the master/slave relationship, because SATA doesn't use them. If one is SATA and the other is IDE, you still shouldn't have to worry about it. As far as using it as a boot drive, ideally it would pop up after the POST to give you the option of which OS you wanted to boot up. If not, you should be able to choose in the BIOS which drive you wanted to boot from.
