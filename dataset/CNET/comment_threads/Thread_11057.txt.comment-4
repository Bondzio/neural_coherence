If you can RMA after 5yrs.
heck go for it.
PSU are strange items, I often post that they lose their &quot;phuumf&quot; after awhile.
The other half is the mtrbd.
and since logic is part of the &quot;start-up ckt&quot; something a user can't fix, a replacement mtrbd.
may be the fix.
However, as I stated it can be anything or a &quot;combo&quot; of problems.
