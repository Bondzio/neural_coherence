To save money, I bought an internal DVD burner(Yamakawa DVR 7-08 8X DVD+/-RW (R888-1002 )) and a USB 2.0 Enclosurer. I thought it should plug and play, but after I put everything together, the laptop(XP) did not recognize it as a DVD writer. The windows explorer did add a label to the DVD driver as &quot;DVD-R&quot;, but after I insert a blank DVD+R disk, the label changed to &quot;CD drive&quot;. I then tried the software(EZBurning) came with Dell, the software complained that it can not find any DVD writer divice. Any help will be appreciated.

If you just need data DVD recording, try what I use -&gt; http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ In closing, my external wasn't that stable until XP SP2 Bob
