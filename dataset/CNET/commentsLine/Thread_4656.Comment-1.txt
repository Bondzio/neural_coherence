i am sure this has been asked, but i don't see it on the forum: buying a workstation to run cpu-intense programs (statistics programs) but also want to be able to run standard programs at the same time (eg, word plus internet email client).
can't seem to decide between the dual core xeons (eg, 5150) or the core 2 duos (eg, e6700).
seems like the xeon is built more for a server, and the c2d for a home machine/work machine/gaming machine to run graphics.
i can say that we do run similar programs on dedicated servers.
not that i won't run a game here or there on the workstation.... i have seen a few internet threads on this, but still having a tough time deciding.
