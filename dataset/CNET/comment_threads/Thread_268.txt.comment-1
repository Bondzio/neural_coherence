I have ATT DSL internet service with a 2wire wireless network router, which works ok, except for sporadic service interruptions.
From time to time there are 5-6 laptops and a printer working from it wirelessly and a Dish Network receiver wired to it.
Problem is; I have two other Dish receivers that need to be connecter by wire in different rooms/floors away from where the current 2wire router is located.
Is there something I can used to connect these receivers by wire to my existing wireless network from 2wire?
Thanks for any help!
