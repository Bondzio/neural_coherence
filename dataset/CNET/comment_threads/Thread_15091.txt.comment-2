Original Equipment Manufacturer.
The speakers were originally sold to a company that makes computers to sell with the computers.
The mfr eventually ends up with some unsold and sells the entire batch to another reseller.
Normally you won't get any documentation, [the original mfr didn't need it] and no fancy box.
A few different scenarios, but similar.
