<s> How do I change partitions identified as D,E,F,G,H,J,K,etc; to one hard drive letter &quot;C&quot;? </s>
<s> My system says &quot;C&quot; drive is 98% full, but the partitons have plenty of memory. </s>
<s> Other then a backup of your important files (which should already exist off the hard drive), then fdisk (win9x), and a reinstall of Windows, your options are Partition Magic and others like it. </s>
<s> your programs and data to the other partitions, and then get the DISCIPLINE to not install anything except Op Sys functions on the C drive. </s>
<s> Most programs offer the ability to install to a location of your choice. </s>
<s> If you learn to use the option your problems will disappear. </s>
<s> barry, http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/file/structPartitions-c.html Web site is a guide to partitioning. </s>
<s> The number of partitions mentioned seems strange. </s>
<s> What are the sizes of the partitions? </s>
<s> As mention in the other posts cut/paste your files to the other partitions. </s>
<s> Displine yourself to place files and downloads on any partition other than C. Remember that H/D are prone to fail. </s>
<s> Keep your data backed up. </s>
