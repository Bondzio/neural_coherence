to keep it simple, a sempron is a 32bit athlon processor with a new lable on it, still a good processor.
a year ago a 3000+ athlon would have been consirded a fast gaming system.
it will do a good job on games.
yes a amd64 is a faster processor and the way things are going.
if you can return the sempron and get the amd64 i would do it.
the last computer i owned had a 386sx chip and i remember that i should have gotten a true 386 chip.
you haven't had one since??
