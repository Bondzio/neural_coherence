i had a similar problem.
my linkstation is plugged into a linksys switch.
i could ping it and open the configuration page through a web browser.
but when i typed \\linkstation, i got the message 'network path not found'.
buffalo tech support asked me to turn off my firewall (i use norton) temporarily and retry.
i was then able to access the drive.
i then entered the ip address for the linkstation in the trusted site tab in norton and turned the firewall back on.
i have not had problems since.
good luck
