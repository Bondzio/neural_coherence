i didn't say it couldn't be done.
just consider the complexity of the devices- which drives cost !!
i agree that dismissing the conceptual comparison to a tv was not really correct/fair on my part.
however, the resolution with which these devices would operate is much greater than a tv.
an analog tv is archaic in comparison.
lets not also forget that cds were developed back in 1980ish.
i recall years ago reading about an optical medium based on a cube using scanning lasers.
i wish i could recall who was doing the research.
if i remember correctly it used two lasers to generate an interference inside the medium, which was sensitive to the interference.
it was pretty awesome.
it was being predicted, if i remember correctly, that these devices would be capable of storing a terabit in a 1 inch cube.
where are they now ?
i certainly believe that it is possible to do it, and no doubt someone has.
my point was- the reason we don't have them is because, &quot;spinning&quot; cds and dvds as a pose to &quot;scanning&quot; the laser, was the easier more cost effective solution.
remember sony and philips are companies that do business to earn a profit and their engineers are driven by that factor.
