Thanks for the advice.. still no joy.
I did the debug at the msdos prompt & found out it is a standard IBM VGA compatible Monitor.
Looked in the drivers listed in the ME software & it doesnt seem to be there.
The Videocard is built onto the Motherboard & so I cannot remove it & re-install.
The screen size will not move off 480x460 size wise & the colours are still 16 only... HELP
