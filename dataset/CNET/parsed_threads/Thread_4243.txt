<s> Once in a while my computer will stop responding and I will have to shut it down via the power button. </s>
<s> After doing that it wont turn back on for an hour or two. </s>
<s> The power supply feels warm so I am assuming that is what is overheating. </s>
<s> I am fairly computer savy but never had problems with overheating before. </s>
<s> what should I do to solve the problem? </s>
<s> and then minimize it...the system temps will continue to be displayed in the upper right hand corner of you monitor. </s>
<s> Let us know what the temps shows. </s>

<s> is your hard drive slow to respond? </s>
<s> most power supply problems will result in plain just power loss. </s>
<s> however if the there is a burning smell like electronics burning it may be power supply. </s>
<s> if you have a warranty send it out if the problem is consistent. </s>
<s> check in windows management for MAJOR errors. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tips. </s>
<s> Temp right now is 35 degrees since it took sitting all last night unused to get the stupid computer to turn on again. </s>
<s> I guess I will have to wait for it to happen again so I can verify it is an overheating problem now that I have pc wizard </s>
<s> A quick test I use for overheating is placing a household fan at open side of case cover removed. </s>
<s> If it lasts longer and/or remains ON, good sign its overheating. </s>
<s> You didn't mentioned anything about your system but if it stuffed with PC goodies or has hi-end devices that generate heat, thjat too must be better cooled. </s>
<s> Thus, a well vent system and/or added fans will do great. </s>
<s> Better now components are decent as they age tend to become less stable and fail. </s>
<s> A PSU should feel as its a big heat source, so don't conclude its that alone, but a cheap or over-taxed PSU will become a candidate for failure if cooling isn't controlled. </s>
<s> I wish, I could offer more concrete advice, but have found a weak or bad PSU a constant source of problems when PCs have added devices, bad cooling, location and/or overwhelmed cooling. </s>
<s> Taken as a whole, a decent installed PSU capable of handling all power demands and well ventilated case does wonders. </s>
