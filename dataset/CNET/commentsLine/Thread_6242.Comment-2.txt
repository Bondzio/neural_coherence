you stated that you have enjoyed the ibook because it was easy to use and worry-free.
guess what, apart from looking different and having a new operating system on it, nothing changed.
you will find the new one as easy to use as the old one.
the limitations of quickbooks is a resident pain in the ykw but you have lived with that so far.
i'm a little confused by your statement that you will not be able to access your customers site once they upgrade to internet explorer 7. the customers website should not be dependent on any one particular browswer and if it is, you might want to suggest to the customer that he needs to employ someone else to build his website.
bye the way, ie 7 is a browser and is not used to build websites.
with the intel mac you could run windows using bootcamp or vm software like fusion or parallels.
then you could access the customers site with no problems.
if you get the mac, you will need a broadband connection to the internet and if you run windows on it you will certainly need virus protection on the windows side.
you have obviously been lucky with your pc's so far, but i wouldn't push it.
bottom line: go with the intel mac and be able to do all the things you have mentioned.
