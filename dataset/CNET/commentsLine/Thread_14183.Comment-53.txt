the first computer i ever touched was an apple iie at school.
a year or two later, my uncle bought a commodore 64, the first computer in the family.
the first computer i ever owned personally was an acer 286 sx2 (i think it was 16 mhz) with 640 kb ram, 5-1/4&quot; floppy (a:), 3-1/2&quot; floppy (b:), 40 mb hard drive, and dos 6.2. my grandpa gave it to me in the early 90s (i think it was '91 or '92), when he replaced it with a 486 running windows 3.1. my first printer was an epson 9-pin color dot matrix with 9 fonts.
