you are looking for some &quot;system&quot; like we have in pcs where you get your cpu in some stock form for boards, etc.
this is pretty much a powerpc and x86 phenom.
i suggest you dive into &quot;that other market&quot; and attend a few &quot;other than x86&quot; shows to get your feet wet.
your replies mean that you should look at x86 gear.
