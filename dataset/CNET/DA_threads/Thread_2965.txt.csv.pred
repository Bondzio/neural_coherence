1.1.1	i was reading one of yalls post on the emachine t6520 i just recently bought an emachine t6520 and i have a question about the specs of the machine.	St
1.1.2	i read that it was labeled different than what it actualy had such as... Os:windows xp media center edition Cpu:AMD Athlon 64, 2400 MHz(12x200) 3400+ 2.4 GHz Memory:892 MB (PC3200 DDR SDRAM) Chipset: ATI radeon xpress 200 series all of this info was from the everest system scan but yall said that it was a 3200+ 2.0 Ghz and the dxdiag also says that it is a 3400+.	St
1.1.3	so is it possible taht the EVEREST home edition is wrong as well or that they corrected the hardware.	St
1.1.4	i have another question about my computer i am not too smart when it comes to computers so i have a couple of clarity questoins.	St
1.1.5	i was wondering waht some terms mean if yall dont mind explaining them for me such as... on the everest scan it has a tab called overclocking and i was wondering what that meant because i was under the empressoin that you had to overclock your system in the bios and i didnt do taht so waht do they mean when they say over clocking in one of the tabs.	St
1.1.6	another question is i have read reviews about a gfx card i would like to purchase for my comp the geforce 6600gt and several people say that they overclocked there card and that they clocked ther card at xxxx.	St
1.1.7	another question i have is i have a fan on my motherboard and when i get a gfx card will that fan still run and should i get another fan and such and will i need an extra power supply for it i have a pcie16x.	St
1.1.8	sorry for all the questions but im just very curious at the moment if you dont wont to answer all of them please look at teh first one about my computer cause i got kind of dissapointed when i saw that it was in fack an amd athlon 3200 not 3400 and socket 743 or what ever because i didnt get what i payed for thanks for all your replies	St
1.2.1	The emachines t6520 is supposed to be 3400+.	St
1.2.2	The emachines t6522 is 3500+ and the t6410 is 3200+.	St
1.2.3	I never said 892MB, integrated gfx takes up the rest.	St
1.2.4	If you did oc it would show current hardware specs, so that's why its there.	St
1.2.5	You can oc the card via windows applications, if you upgrade to 6600gt, you might need a new psu, the motherbaord is not proprietary so any psu will do as long as its atx and it can fit the dumb emachine case.	St
1.2.6	The fan will still run, you will need a BETTER psu to run the 6600gt.	St
1.2.7	The t6410 and t6520 are both socket 754s, 3200+ and 3400+ respectively.	St
1.2.8	The t6212 is 3200+ Socket 939 and the t6522 is socket 939 3500+.	St
1.2.9	You got exactly what you paid for.	St
1.2.10	Roger	St
1.3.1	did you read the post earilier they were saying that the 3200+ not a 3400+ as described in the dxdiag.	St
1.3.2	and im still a little confused integrated gfx?	St
1.4.1	(can you edit your posts) anyway you say that the oc is what is on your hardware well what is oc	St
1.5.1	regarding 3200+/3400+.	St
1.5.2	Download rivatuner to oc your 6600gt if you get it, the settings can be changed in windows not bios like cpu.	St
