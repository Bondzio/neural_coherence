just before the problems occurred had you downloaded anything from the net?
what anti-virus and firewall are you using?
a problem out of nowhere usually means your hard drive is corrupted and may need to be reformatted.
do you run anti-spyware and/or registry cleaner?
i would refrain from downloading new stuff you don't completely understand for a while.
i will track this thread until things are figured out.
