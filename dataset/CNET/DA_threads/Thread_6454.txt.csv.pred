1.1.1	I have a wireless Netgear WGR614v5 router , 54Mbps which is approx 6 yrs old .	St
1.1.2	I also have the high speed cable internet service that provides up to 10 Mbps DL speed .	St
1.1.3	Since my router still works , is there any reason I should replace it or is it possible it degrades in speed as it ages ?	Ques
1.1.4	It just seems my internet speed is n't as fast as it used to be , that 's why I was curious .	St
1.1.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	is a pass-through device .	St
1.2.2	It has no effect on connect speed .	St
1.2.3	If your speed has dropped I 'd suggest you contact your provider .	St
1.3.1	The move to many using Netflix and other such services accounts for quite a bit of the internet traffic today .	St
1.3.2	And yes it will make the internet slower .	Res
1.4.1	I do n't use Netflix or watch any movies online if you are referring to me being the one that in doing that might cause the internet speed to be slower .	Ques
1.4.2	Or is it possible due to being on cable that people in my area using things like Netflix also affect & quot ; MT & quot ; internet speed as well ?	Ques
1.4.3	I remember reading years ago that if enough people in the area are using the cable for internet , it can affect the speed whereas that does n't apply to the DSL speed .	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Unless one is limiting their access to the DSL provider , the & quot ; internet & quot ; accesses are affected .	St
1.6.2	There are long nice articles about how this works and why the pipes are getting clogged .	St
1.7.1	There are many things that can affect your internet speed .	St
1.7.2	For example , if you have a broadband cable ISP , this has a fixed pool of bandwidth that 's determined by the infrastructure of fibre optic and copper cables that the ISP has installed .	St
1.7.3	So , you might buy 12Mb/s downlink internet , and some times of the day when there is n't much usage , you might get 20+Mb/s .	St
1.7.4	Other times of the day , like the evening , when everyone else is getting Netflix instant movies , or downloading other streaming video sources , your speed could go down 6Mb/s ( these are just examples , but I 've seen it happen at my house *smile* ) .	St
1.7.5	Also , while the maximum speed of your router via wireless may be 54Mb/s ( wireless-g ) , your router will be delivering half that if you 're lucky , on a strong connection .	St
1.7.6	You laptop or whatever may show 54Mb/s , but that 's just the speed of the connection according to the wireless internet interface driver or utility , that is n't the actual & quot ; throughput & quot ; being delivered .	St
1.7.7	There 's lot of overhead with wireless that takes away from the actual peak performance .	St
1.7.8	And as you get farther away from your router with intervening walls , and your connection goes down from & quot ; Excellent & quot ; , the speed also suffers from that .	St
1.7.9	You can see this if you look at some detailed router product reviews , like on the smallnetbuilder.com web site that has lots of router reviews .	St
1.7.10	To get the actual throughput , try transferring a large file ( 1 GB or larger ) from a wired system to a wireless system , and time the transfer .	St
1.7.11	This will tell you how fast your wireless is really transferring .	St
1.7.12	Anyways , there are other things to consider than just taking full advantage of your download speed .	St
1.7.13	For example , if you are streaming HDTV from files on an HTC , or running backups to an external disk connected to the router or to another computer , you may find that having Gb/s wired ports is useful to you .	St
1.7.14	So to answer your question , you really need to assess your needs against how things are currently working .	St
1.7.15	If you current router is fulfilling your needs , then stay with it .	St
1.7.16	If you need more speed for specific reasons , like streaming video , or running backups , or whatever , then you should make a plan on how you can reach your goals .	St
1.7.17	There are a surprising number of ways of getting more bandwidth in your home network , and doing some reading on a site like smallnetbuilder.com can be very helpful .	St
1.7.18	They also have user forums where you can talk about these things and get information from really experienced people .	St
1.8.1	Given the setup you describe with an 802.11G Router ( 54 Mbps ) on a 10 Mbps cable line , the router wo n't slow the traffic down , there is plenty of spare capacity .	St
1.8.2	That 's the & quot ; No & quot ; part .	St
1.8.3	The & quot ; Yes & quot ; part is a bit more complicated .	St
1.8.4	Internally to your network , if you subscribed to a fast cable service , like the 100 Mbps or 200 Mbps offered by Virgin Media in the UK , then yes , a 54 Mbps will slow it down to 54 Mbps .	St
1.8.5	You would need an N or N+ router ( 150 and 300 Mbps respectively ) to get the full faster speed .	St
1.8.6	There is one other circumstance on a G router and that is where you add to the network an older device with a B ( 11 Mbps ) Network Interface Card ( NIC ) .	St
1.8.7	Most G routers will slow the whole internal network down to 11 Mbps , including any G NICs on the network because they are single channel .	St
1.8.8	But again , this should n't affect you with a 10 Mbps cable feed .	St
1.8.9	Most N routers do n't have this problem because they broadcast on multiple channels .	St
1.8.10	So internally , I do n't think you have any problems , so unless your router breaks or you subscribe to a faster service , there is n't any real point in replacing it .	St
1.8.11	Externally , it 's a whole different kettle of fish !	St
1.8.12	DSL is by far the worst , all carriers implement the service by providing a high speed trunk to the distribution cabinet ( sometimes called a Fat Pipe ) and then multiplexing a number of users off it , In the UK for example , a consumer ADSL link will multiplex up to 50 users and a business link will multiplex up to 30 users .	St
1.8.13	The speed will be variable , depending how many users are on and what they are doing .	St
1.8.14	If you log on at say 3:00 am , it 's likely there wo n't be much contention and you 'll get nominal contracted speed , not usually more because the ISPs throttle it ( USA may be different , I defer to the local guys ) .	St
1.8.15	But if you log on when the kids get home from school and they are all Facebooking , twittering , or even , shock horror , doing homework , you will find the speed somewhat patchy .	St
1.8.16	Similarly , when their parents get home from work !	St
1.8.17	So pick your time if you are doing anything heavy .	St
1.8.18	Cable does n't work the same way and different cable systems work differently .	St
1.8.19	The Virgin Mobile system , for example , is susceptible to server load , rather than link load and their policy is ( or was , when I was there ) to add another server when the average load climbed above 70 % .	St
1.8.20	There was some load slowing but nothing like that on the more popular ADSL .	St
1.8.21	And the other major factor on the internet is who you are logging in to .	St
1.8.22	The speed you see will depend on the end to end speed of your link , so if you log into a slow website , yes , your speed will be slower than if you log into a fast one .	St
1.8.23	But assuming your usage pattern has n't changed , that should n't be a huge factor .	St
1.8.24	And it remains to be seen what effect the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 will have .	St
1.8.25	It & quot ; should & quot ; be better but if you have a router that does n't suppost it natively or worse , your ISP does n't , somewhere along the line , the IPv4 traffic will have to be tunnelled to IP v6 and vice versa .	St
1.8.26	More processing & quot ; could & quot ; result in less speed - who knows ?	Ques
1.8.27	Is n't it all wet string and cocoa tins , anyway & lt ; g & gt ; ?	Ques
1.9.1	I appreciate your detailed explanation & will also ck out the website too .	Polite
