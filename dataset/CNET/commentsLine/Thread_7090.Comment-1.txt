i have an old desktop computer(300mhz pii processor w/512k cache, 128 mb sdram, 4mb 3-d agp graphics and there was a 5 gb 9ms ultra ata hard drive) and the hard drive crashed.
i also have a laptop but would like to use my old desktop in a home network.
what type and specifications for a internal hard drive would work with my computer?
