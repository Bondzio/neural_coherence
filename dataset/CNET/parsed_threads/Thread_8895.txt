<s> my toshiba L505-S5990 will only allow connections to unsecured networks. </s>
<s> finally had to reset my router at home through my desktop as unsecured so I can get a wireless connection on my laptop but of course do not want to keep my home network unsecured. </s>
<s> help. </s>

<s> Sorry but tell a bit more. </s>

<s> at one point, a microsoft driver was updated and Toshiba support said that was the cause (6 months ago). </s>
<s> they had me reset to factory (F11 I think) and this seemed to work. </s>
<s> Two weeks ago, lost access. </s>
<s> after setting back to previous time (two weeks earlier when repair shop set to factory for virus removal), no microsoft driver, just realtek but still was having problems. </s>
<s> reset driver, reloaded disc for linksys on laptop, etc but no luck. </s>
<s> took laptop out of house to test remote places to determine if router or not and this worked. </s>
<s> then set up router through my desktop, kept unsecured and laptop connects without issue (so far). </s>
<s> I have not tried to add security through desktop but that was goint to be my next step but when I tried to connect to secure connection with correct password at remote location, computer would not connect. </s>
<s> hope this is enough info. </s>
<s> thanks for trying. </s>
<s> Try the toshiba support site and install the motherboard chipset drivers then the wifi driver again. </s>
<s> Sorry to read about a virus. </s>
<s> This usually means yet another reload. </s>
