I would like to make a more direct suggestion here but I can't.
It would help a lot if you provide some specs for the cases or a link to the cases.
Given that generic power supplies can be purchases for less than $30 and decents cases that provide good cooling solution and space and be purchased for less than $40, purchasis the P/S and chassis seperate might be the best way to go.
It really depends a lot on the parts that you will be installing in the case.
Antecs usually provide better cooling.
I haven't heard much about Liteon cases and to be honest I didn't Liteon made CASES.
If you get a P/S with more than 350 watts then you will have more room to work with on future upgrades.
