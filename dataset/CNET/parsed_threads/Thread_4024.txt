<s> It has been a while since last I bought a new desktop computer. </s>
<s> I have started researching, and found there have been a lot of changes in technology since my last purchase. </s>
<s> I am pretty well settled on an Intel E6600 CPU with a Gigabyte GA-965P-DS4 motherboard. </s>
<s> This board has pretty well everything I want already onboard, except a graphics card. </s>
<s> This is where I am bogging down in my search. </s>
<s> I had intended to keep my NEC 1800 LCD monitor, and just upgrade the processor box. </s>
<s> However, now I am having second thoughts. </s>
<s> The GA-965P-DS4 motherboard has these newer PCIE slots, which to my understanding are a replacement for the older AGP slots and cards. </s>
<s> But I am not sure which PCIE video card to get - and I am not sure if they are available to feed my old analog LCD monitor, or if they only come with a digital interface (which will force me to also buy a new digital interfaced monitor). </s>
<s> I am not a gamer, but I do want one of the fastest systems for digital photo and video editing, as well as running Adobe's Creative Suite of applications; I find that my current system just does not have the horsepower to drive these programs efficiently. </s>
<s> I also want a system that will be ready for Windows Vista when it eventually ships; my understanding is that it will need considerable horsepower and also a strong video card with 'pixel shading'. </s>
<s> So, my question is: what would be a good recommendation for a video card for my new system, and do I need to get a digital monitor, or is there a PCIE card that has analog output? </s>
<s> Or should I go with a digital card and new monitor - is there an advantage? </s>
<s> Btw.. </s>
<s> I notice many of these newer video cards support dual monitors.. this is NOT a feature that I require, and don't wish to pay extra for it. </s>
<s> Finally, I would also appreciate some links to sites on video cards - reviews, recommendations, etc. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> all new geforce/radeon perform about the same for 2D apps such as Adobe CS2. </s>
<s> any geforce 7300gt or radeon x1600pro will be more than sufficient. </s>
<s> both are in the $90 price range (from web shops) and both will fully support vista when it arrives. </s>
<s> also, practically all new cards come with dual monitor and hdtv support. </s>
<s> you're not paying extra for them since they're standard equipment nowadays. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply.. </s>
<s> I read up on it, and it looks like the x1600 pro is just what I need, and well within my budget. </s>
<s> It also has both VGA and DVI interfaces, so I can use it now on my current LCD monitor, and also later if I choose to upgrade to a digital monitor. </s>
<s> btw.. it mentions 'crossfire ready'... what exactly is crossfire? </s>
<s> ...is ATI's name for when two graphics cards that can be linked together for more 3D power. </s>
<s> Please be aware that while the hardware reqired by M$ Vista is not actually huge, no graphics card on the market at the moment provides &quot;full support&quot;. </s>
<s> http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsvista/evaluate/hardware/vistarpc.mspx Vista will use DirectX10 (and support DirectX9), and all graphics cards at the moment are only DirectX9. </s>
<s> http://www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarecentral/reports/article.php/3616546 GeeBee. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply.. </s>
<s> I guess it is just as well then that I am not shelling out big bucks for a graphics card.. the X1600 is only about $135 CAD. </s>
<s> And since I don't expect Vista to be stable for another year, I probably won't be migrating before then, so I still think the X1600 will do for a while. </s>
<s> thanks, pl </s>
<s> Vista's Aero interface is built on DX9, not DX10. </s>
<s> MS chose to do this since DX9 is stable and they've been working on Aero for over 2+ years. </s>
<s> Aero will be migrated to DX10 in a future Vista release. </s>
<s> Any DX9 card with SM 3.0 and 128MB of RAM will fully support Vista/Aero. </s>
<s> ...a site recently which detailed 2D speeds, and while all the cards were stratospheric scorers, it didn't look to have moved on much from the good old days. </s>
<s> Cards which wouldn't even score in the top 100 (Matrox/3Dfx /XGi/Videologic were even listed I think) now for 3D speed, were easily a match for more modern hardware (if I found it interesting, I'd be able to find it again! </s>
<s> ). </s>
<s> Apparently 2D speeds have been pretty much topped out (I can't even find the link now, but remeber Matrox 550 was a good &quot;old&quot; scorer) for many years with no drive for extra speeds, so any card will be adequate for what you require. </s>
<s> Here's a link detailing the X1600Pro (and Crossfire) fully too. </s>
<s> http://www.guru3d.com/article/Videocards/360/1/ The only caveat...the power required. </s>
<s> It's not exactly a low power device, so please make sure your PSU can provide the current required. </s>
<s> GB. </s>
<s> ...that &quot;full support&quot; will not include Vista's DX10, ramarc. </s>
<s> No need to get so testy! </s>
<s> GB. </s>
<s> Thanks again for all the advice. </s>
<s> As I said, I am not a gamer, so it would appear the X1600 will do nicely for me - and the price seems right. </s>
<s> My only concern now is the motherboard I intended to use (Gigabyte GA-965P-DS4) seems to be having problems. </s>
<s> I just heard from my dealer that Gigabyte recently recalled all these boards because of a design flaw in the chipset. </s>
<s> Who knows if the next release will be stable! </s>
<s> Gonna have to do some more research on this board. </s>
<s> Again, thanks for all the advice for the video card! </s>
<s> Yes, regarding power, I just read:: Power-Hungry Graphics If there's one area of computer hardware that is getting a bit out of hand, it's PC graphics. </s>
<s> ATI and Nvidia are releasing newer and faster products at a breakneck pace -- single-card SLI powerhouses, double-wide ATI CrossFire behemoths, Nvidia's Quad SLI -- all seemingly designed with no heed to power consumption or heat production. </s>
<s> If you think DirectX 10 will alleviate these concerns, you're dead wrong: The combined requirements of Vista, DirectX 10, and upcoming 3D games and applications will drive GPU technology through the ceiling. </s>
<s> Companies like Thermaltake are even ramping up for this increased power draw by releasing dedicated GPU power supplies. </s>
<s> These units range from 250 to 300 watts, fit into an open 5.25-inch drive bay, and supply power exclusively to the GPU. </s>
<s> From these wattage specifications, it's safe to assume that first-generation DirectX 10 cards will be power-hungry products indeed. </s>
<s> Heat production is another potential sore spot, and all indications say that cooling will be a challenge for Vista-ready GPUs. </s>
<s> The only hope is that second-generation or subsequent revisions will bring DirectX 10 products that get us back on track with a sane balance of high performance and energy savings, much as Nvidia has done with the evolution of its GeForce 7600 and 7900 GPUs. </s>
<s> some folks will never use dx10 or game so little that a dx9 card will suffice them for years to come. </s>
<s> there's just no need for them to think they've got to get a dx10 card in order to use the full vista ui. </s>
<s> ...power requirement indicated in the hardware review review : http://www.guru3d.com/article/Videocards/360/4/ The X1600 and modern graphics cards in general are a power hungry bunch. </s>
<s> If you don't have the PSU overhead to spare at the moment, you're looking immediately at extra expense. </s>
<s> Or you could go for one of those older cards that still do well in 2D speeds, and suck up far less power. </s>
<s> There are a few modern cards which use less wattage though : http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/gpu-consumption2006_7.html http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/geforce7900gtx_6.html X-bit seems to be one of the few tech sites that actually measures current draw, which may help upgraders to avoid upseting a weaker PSU. </s>
<s> Personally if the DX10 hardware coming in 2007 is going to be as bad as suspected, I suspect the electricity to power them for a year (we've had 3 prices rises in 6 months), may be more than the cost of the computers themselves! </s>
