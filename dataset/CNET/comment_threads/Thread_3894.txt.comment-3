The operating system?
Model number?
Do you have a floppy drive?
A CD/DVD drive?
What type of &quot;Recovery Discs&quot; do you have?
(If it's a brand name computer, many have &quot;recovery partitions&quot; or 'Recovery Discs&quot; that contain the operating system and all software which will take the computer back to &quot;factory condition&quot;..) Do you have the operating system information and nothing more?
The more information you give us, the better informed our answer will be.
Hope this helps.
