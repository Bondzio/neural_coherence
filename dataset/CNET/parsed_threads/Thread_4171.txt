<s> I have a six-year-old computer with a reset button on the tower. </s>
<s> This button is convenient because when a screen freezes up it is easier to press the reset button than to press ctrl. </s>

<s> and delete. </s>
<s> I need to buy a new computer but the stores that I visited only sell computers that do not have reset buttons. </s>
<s> If I buy a computer without a reset button how would I fix a frozen screen? </s>
<s> Thank you very much. </s>
<s> If you buy a new computer one would think a frozen screen to be very rare. </s>
<s> If necessary you can depress the power button for up to 10 sec and the machine will power off, you can then restart. </s>
<s> XP is so much more stable than W95/98. </s>
<s> That's why the reset button is gone. </s>
<s> XP can recover from frozen screens, if and when they ever happen. </s>
<s> I have four PCs running XP Home and Pro and it never happens to me. </s>
<s> Then, again, pressing the power button for &gt;5 seconds powers off and you can power back up. </s>
