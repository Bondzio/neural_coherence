Why not use Disk Management in XP to delete the existing partition and create a new one using the entire 80GB?
I suspect you format the drive into FAT32 earlier which may be why it only shows 32GB as XP cannot format a volume larger than 32GB into FAT32.
If you use NTFS then it can format all the 80GB in one partition.
Tell us what Disk Management reveals.
It should show the balance of the HDD as unallocated space?
