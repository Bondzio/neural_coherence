Its on a parallel port (tried LPT1 & LPT2) and except that some of the older ones were not bidirectional am not aware of any settings it can do.
Of course it could be flakeyness in the MB/BIOS as I have found other glitches in this MB (ECS 848P-A) and I am considering scrapping it and putting in a better one.
I selected it because it was on sale together with the P-4.
What would I look for in the BIOS?
