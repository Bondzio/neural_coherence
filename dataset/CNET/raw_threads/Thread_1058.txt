If I'm downloading something or the PC is running a programme, it'll crash about every 40 minutes or so. Is there anything relating to the installation of the anti-virus software that could cause this? I had installed McAfee Internet Security the day before and had HUGE problems so uninstalled it and reverted to the Norton package I had used without problems for the previous 12 months. Could this have caused this issue? I have Windows ME. Any ideas would be great!!
