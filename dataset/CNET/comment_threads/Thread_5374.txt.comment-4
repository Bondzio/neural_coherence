That's why there's no dual 660 or 650.
Darn!
Anyways, there's a Air-Conditioned MASSCOOL case at www.newegg.com.
($300!)
Otherwise...go all out and get a 120mm Panaflo that's 114 cfm.
Get a Thermaltake Big Typhoon CPU cooler and take off the stock 120mm fan, put on yet another 114 cfm Panaflo.
Hook them all up to a Vantec Fan Controller.
I didn't know that they ran that hot!
Intel needs help!
