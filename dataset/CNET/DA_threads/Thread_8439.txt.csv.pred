1.1.1	I a buying a new pc.	St
1.1.2	Planning to do a lot of gaming on it.	St
1.1.3	Is a Creative Audio X-FI PCI card worth $79?	St
1.1.4	Thank you for your help.	St
1.1.5	Though I will not be at my pc for a while and may not respond.	St
1.2.1	While I didn't hear much difference in the headphones the RECORDING was stellar compared to almost every onboard sound system I've tried.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	and in fact I use the X-Fi Fidelity with Creative speakers.	St
1.3.2	Very satisfied.	St
1.3.3	Comes with some fairly good software as well.	St
1.4.1	x-fi has lower cpu usage (which means higher framerates in games) and it sounds much better than built-in sound.	St
1.4.2	creative's eax implementation is way better than most built-in stuff so you'll hear sounds clearer, with better directional placing, and great environmental effects.	St
1.5.1	Good Sound Card + cheap speakers = wasted time and effort.	St
1.6.1	Would it be worth having a 2.1 audio system with it?	St
1.6.2	If so what would be best for the money?	St
