I've had the few programs and a couple peripherals that don't like it all that much but other than that, with the stuff I use the absolute most, it actually works better, and I'm saying this honestly.
My startups are actually faster with Vista than they are with XP, too.
I must have just lucked out.
Other than this, of course.
(If you want to mention the betas of Vista though, then you're right.
They were definitely not all together!)
