i just had to make this general comment after you raised the question about whether we should think of the internet as safe (at all!)
security on the internet does seem like an oxymoron - and becoming more so every day.
having said that, i am reminded when i used to do a fresh linux install and the &quot;what level of network security&quot; do i want to select..... one of the levels was &quot;paranoid&quot; now, it seems that this level of network security is the norm, that every developer now must build in so many layers of encryption as to practically render their apps so weighted down due to this security issue that it must burden them beyond belief.
my real question to you is this.
if i work in a company with heavy computer network security, and i want to use a ssh tunnel or a wifi to get to the internet at work, are it security people able to now eavesdrop on my internet activity almost out of the air?
now, that's ridiculous paranoia - or is it?
you tell me!
