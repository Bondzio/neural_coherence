over the last year or so trying to find any spare/extra models of this mouse to buy them up and no such luck.
I had purchased the last four or five of them years ago at Staples and my sister got two of them.
I'm down to two (one of them a puppy chewed through the cord and a friend rewired it for me and is still in the box as my last resort), and this one is getting pretty worn out as far as the rollers go now so moving the cursor across the screen takes four or five swipes with the ball now instead of just one like it should.
Kind of like trying to bowl with a flat groove on the ball...... TONI
