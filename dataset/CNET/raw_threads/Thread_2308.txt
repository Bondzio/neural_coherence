I finished it and plugged my computer via HDMI to my also new ASUS monitor and got no display. Heard no beeping in the computer and everything sounds like it's running normal. I have tried multiple monitors in the house and different type of connections on my graphics card. I am unsure what to do.

11282	5	511260	5053807	5053722	dbardoul	12/27/10 4:42 PM	1.29346812E12	power connections	The XFX HD-577A-ZNFC Radeon HD 5770 video card in my machine is plugged into the primary PCIE x16 port and the power connection going into the side of the video card is the 6-pin PCI-E plug
11282	6	511260	5053817	5053807	R. Proffitt	12/27/10 4:47 PM	1.29346842E12	That's good.	Power off, lift up the video card and firmly send it home again. Power up and hope for beeps. Bob
11282	7	511260	5053844	5053817	dbardoul	12/27/10 5:25 PM	1.2934707E12	still nothing	I turned off the power supply, took out the video card and then plugged it in, plugged some basic speakers up to the motherboard's green audio output, and heard no beeps and still no display.
11282	8	511260	5053847	5053844	R. Proffitt	12/27/10 5:30 PM	1.293471E12	No beeps?	Hmm, the plot thickens. 1. Find that reset button and unplug that. I ran into a few that were shorted out. 2. Double check your motherboard control wiring. One motherboard document was incorrect and folk could not boot as they had swapped the reset and the HDD LED in the docs. About a 50% RMA rate on that one. 3. Any IDE drives? Unplug, retest (each step and idea here.) 4. Check the back side of the motherboard. I've encountered a lot of extra mounting bolts shorting out the back side. 5. Less is more. To get beeps, no video, memory, HDDs, CD/DVDs and well, not much is needed. 6. Many boards shipped with the CMOS CLEAR jumper in the clear position. They stopped doing that due to high return rates (who reads the manuals?) Bob
11282	9	511260	5053855	5053847	dbardoul	12/27/10 5:39 PM	1.29347154E12	reply	After many unsuccessful attempts I dissasembled my machine and reassembled it on a table. I turn it on with a screw driver by jumping it where the Power wire would go. My hard drive and Cd/DVD drive are both SATA so I have no IDE devices. I unplugged everything and just have the processor and mother board running. I am hearing 3 beeps in a row consistently
11282	10	511260	5053858	5053855	R. Proffitt	12/27/10 5:50 PM	1.2934722E12	That's good news.	Now one part at a time. Power off when changing or adding parts. 1. One stick of ram. Beeps. 2. Video card, might show the BIOS screen. Ok, back into the case and if no beeps I bet it's the reset switch or too many standoffs. Bob
11282	11	511260	5053870	5053855	dbardoul	12/27/10 6:00 PM	1.2934728E12	RAM	ok my motherboard has 4 slots for RAM. 3 of them are blue and the 4th and closest one to the processor is black. I tried my stick of RAM in each slot alone and didnt get any beeps. oh and by the way. The video card's box has a 6 pin PCI-E connector that splits into two 4 pin IDE connectors. I don't know whether to use the power supply's 6 pin PCI-E connector to go into the video card, or to use the video card's IDE splitter thing.
11282	12	511260	5053863	5053870	R. Proffitt	12/27/10 6:15 PM	1.2934737E12	I thought you had 2 sticks of ram?	It's unusual for both to go bad. As to the video power we are not ready for that yet but I use the power supply's PCI-E power connector first and if there is none, then I use the other adapter. Bob
11282	13	511260	5053864	5053863	dbardoul	12/27/10 6:21 PM	1.29347406E12	ram	I bought four 2GB DDR3 sticks of memory and they all give no beeps in each slot alone. and still no video. I thought the card might not be getting enough power but I bought a 650W power supply and the newegg power supply calculator said in the lower 500W range.
11282	14	511260	5053873	5053139	R. Proffitt	12/27/10 6:24 PM	1.29347424E12	Time.	As we add RAM it could take longer to produce beeps but I am guessing that you tried one stick of RAM have double checked all jumpers and that clear cmos one as well. Did the motherboard appear to be new or second hand? bob
11282	15	511260	5053865	5053139	R. Proffitt	12/27/10 6:25 PM	1.2934743E12	Link, comment	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813121361&cm_re=intel_dx58so-_-13-121-361-_-Product&quot; and the feedback looks like others have had dead boards. Call it dead and get another. Bob
11282	16	511260	5053866	5053873	dbardoul	12/27/10 6:27 PM	1.29347442E12	brand new	every part of my machine is brand new. I only have 1 stick of RAM in at a time. What are jumpers and cmos?
11282	17	511260	5053878	5053865	dbardoul	12/27/10 6:33 PM	1.29347478E12	video card	I tried putting my ATI Radeon 5770 in my other factory built computer and could get display there either. How can I be sure if the motherboard is dead and not just a faulty graphics card?
11282	18	511260	5053869	5053866	R. Proffitt	12/27/10 6:38 PM	1.29347508E12	All apologies.	All skill levels show up here. I can't know if you have never seen a jumper setting or heard about cmos or bios settings. http://www.intel.com/products/desktop/motherboards/dx58so/dx58so-overview.htm is the home page of this board. Page 39 of http://downloadmirror.intel.com/18128/eng/DX58SO_ProductGuide02_English.pdf (the manual) shows which slot to install one stick of RAM. Page 42 tells you which of the two PCIE slots to use for the video card. Page 54 shows FOUR POWER CONNECTIONS for this board (did you get them all?) Page 55 shows &quot;Setting the BIOS Configuration Jumper&quot;. Sorry if anything upsets you. This is not my intention. Bob

11282	20	511260	5053891	5053869	dbardoul	12/27/10 7:00 PM	1.2934764E12	the manual	I read page 39 and I was putting my 2GB DDR3 stick of memory in the correct (Channel C) slot. I did, however, notice that the description of the memory to be inserted into Channel C shows &quot;1 GB, 1333MHz.&quot; I am using a 2GB stick as I do not have any 1GB sticks. SO i dont know if that could be a problem. I also read page 42 and I am also correctly placing my graphics card in the correct (Primary PCI Express x16) slot. Now page 54 could be the main problem. I used the manual for plugging the power supply connectors into the motherboard. I saw that there were FOUR slots to be plugged. I plugged the 24-pin connector into the slot, the 8-pin connector into the slot, and the SATA connector into its slot. I see the FOURTH slot is an IDE connector slot but I could not locate it on the motherboard. I do see where it would have been on the motherboard but it is simply an outline drawn on the board. The slot is missing or not there. As for page 55, I see the prongs of the bios settings but there is no &quot;jumper&quot; figure plugged into the prongs.
11282	21	511260	5053889	5053891	R. Proffitt	12/27/10 7:17 PM	1.29347742E12	I think you found it.	If the BIOS jumper is missing all bets are off about the board working. Find a spare jumper (or just ask the seller for it) and install it per the manual. Can you supply the link to the proper manual? Bob
11282	22	511260	5053901	5053889	dbardoul	12/27/10 7:21 PM	1.29347766E12	jumper	I found a spare jumper from my other desktop and placed it in the 1-2 configuration for normal. I used the same manual that you posted. http://downloadmirror.intel.com/18128/eng/DX58SO_ProductGuide02_English.pdf
11282	23	511260	5053898	5053880	dbardoul	12/27/10 7:22 PM	1.29347772E12	yes typo	Yes that indeed was a typo I am very sorry for the confusion. My other desktop has a pci express x16 slot and I placed my radeon 5770 in it and received NO VIDEO.

I had the jumper in 1-2 normal config and the video card plugged to the monitor via HDMI and there was no display. so then I plugged the video card to the moitor via DVI and got soemthing to display.

But when I plug it into the USB slot and press 'Y' nothing happens. NUM LOCK, CAPS LOCK, & SCROLL LOCK do not display their lit up LED's so I'm assuming the machine isn't detecting the keyboard. WHy is it not working?

Next time you try this .... bench test the components outside the case with a normal monitor. There's no point installing all the components in the case only to find they don't work at all. VAPCMD

It's been so long since I encountered a video card that didn't boot up to the HDMI display that I had forgotten about those early HDMI cards. Sorry but that was just a few years ago and I ran into all of two of those. Glad to see you got your machine sorted out. Bob
