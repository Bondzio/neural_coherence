This does not happen when I use other apps. Atlast, the system turns off. I have a PC with Pentium IV processor 512 MB RAM, 80 GB HD, D101GGC Motherboard Please help me with some solutions.

It reads to me like it's a DDR SDRam system, thus, is the system meeting the minimum requirements for the games? As the previous poster have mention, the sytem could do use some upgrade of memory, and powerful power supply unit, and also, better graphic card if you hadn't used one.
