Sorry, but you gave no clue of the system details and all that.
Its best to provide as much as possible otherwise, expect more questions just to get at a starting point.
Remove all connections to drives.
Now power-ON, what are the results?
Is there now a display of any system respose NOT the display's own lost signal message or similar?
