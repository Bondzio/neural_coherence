<s> So I just finished building a Core 2 Duo PC for a friend, and now that everythings in and all, the power switch won't turn it on. </s>
<s> For some reason the Power LED is on, though faint. </s>
<s> I reconnected all the front panel stuff and made sure they were in the correct places but to no avail. </s>
<s> Also, the mobo supports a 24-pin power, but I used a 20-pin. </s>
<s> It said it could use 20-pin too. </s>
<s> Also, the 12V connector had 8 slots but I used a P4 cable instead. </s>
<s> These might be the problem, but I'm not sure. </s>

<s> So you connected the 20 pin connector starting from PINs 1-13 (JPWR1) and what about JPWR2 (8-pin) and JPWR3 (4-pin molex). </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Yeah, the 20 pin fit into the 24 pin in the right slots, (it's idiot-proof). </s>
<s> The JPWR2(8pin) has a P4 12V (4pin) cable in the 4 slots that weren't originally covered up with a little plastic thingy. </s>
<s> As for the molex, I stuck a molex into it from the PSU. </s>
<s> Hope this is all right. </s>
<s> esp vodeo card. </s>
<s> Motherboard manual suggests 450W PSU .... looks as if what you have is either 350W or optionally 380W ...is that right ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> 7300 GT I believe (I'm at home now so I'm not 100% sure about this one, its 7300 for sure, not sure about the GT) As for HDD, the Master is a 250GB WD SATA2, and the slave is an IDE (160GB WD) drive with a adapter thing to convert to SATA (even though I don't like this, he's stuck with it until he can afford a SATA drive...soon) 2 Opticals are DVD burners, IDE, using the 1 IDE connector the mobo has. </s>
<s> We have a firewire card in a PCI slot for fun Proc is a Core 2 Duo E6300 (1.86 Ghz, 1066 FSB) The memory is CORSAIR ValueSelect (2x512) DDR2. </s>
<s> The PSU is 500W. </s>
