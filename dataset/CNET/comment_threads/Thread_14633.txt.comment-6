...if you can afford an external drive.
backup is only useful when it's done regularly.
having a backup from a month ago is little solace if your kid's birthday party video were put on your pc last week.
do you really want to spend time every week feeding your PC dvds when an external drive can be used for automatic (hands off) backup?
use dvd-rw for archiving stuff you don't need immediate access to but still want to keep (last year's photos, tax returns, etc.).
stick with an external drive for backup.
