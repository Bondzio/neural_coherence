installing the router.. usually you need to install the new router drivers first.. do not connect the router yet.
(you have to choose one of your computer to do this) again after you insert the drivers cd, follow the instruction.. you may need to restart the computer.. then you have to connect your computer to the new router... using a cable (wired) -- still do not connect the router to the modem yet.. -- you might want to change the ssid name here.. but do not use any security option yet.. now, when your computer can detect the router.. and you get an ip address .. turn off everything.... and connect your router to the modem, and also connect your computer to the router.. using cable (wired) and turn on the modem first... wait for all the light are stabilized... then turn on the router.. and wait for the light stabilized... now you can turn on your computer ... try it, if you can browse the internet.. then you need to go to the linksys website and download the firmware for your router.. (if available.. look at your firmware version) after you update the firmware.
then you can try to disconnect the cable from your computer to router.. and try wireless.. (if you use the wireless capable computer to do the set up -- if you use your dell, then just try your inspiron wirelessly) the point here is to follow the instruction on the manual .. as much as possible...
