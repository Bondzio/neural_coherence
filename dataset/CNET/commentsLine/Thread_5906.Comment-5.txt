these days, it's a pretty mundane topic.
i have used the fancy names like lexar and sandisk with the same success as lesser known/generic/store brand usb drives.
just make sure it is a usb 2.0 model.
check reviews at online stores like newegg.com.
the rest is all the bells and whistles you think you need: color, key loops, mp3 player, security software, material, finish, cartoon characters, ballpoint pen, swiss army knife, etc.
i do someties spend more to get the model that comes with encryption software--very handy.
