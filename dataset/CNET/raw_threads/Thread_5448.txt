You really need to check the specs on anything that interests you. However, if you find no such creature, try adding a USB pci card, that will allow use of newer printers. Just be sure to request one that supports USB2.0 vs 1, but it should anyways for most newer USB cards, just ask. To check specs on ainkjet model, visit the makers support website for info/details that refelect your model. It seems only laserjets come with any ports to attach as it were. enjoy -----Willy
