<s> Twice this week, my keyboard simply stopped inputting any characters--either in a browser or MS Word document. </s>
<s> After the first time, I looked in the Device Manager and the keyboard wasn't listed at all. </s>
<s> I rebooted and everything was back to normal again--until just this evening. </s>
<s> Another reboot took care of this. </s>
<s> But I'm wondering now why this is happening. </s>
<s> I am using a Dell Inspiron 1501 (Vista) and the drivers for this laptop on their support site don't have one for the keyboard. </s>
<s> 1st off, since this is a laptop, it maybe better to post in the laptop forum, as more laptop users can help. </s>
<s> A typical laptop is already provided its drivers for the system itself by the maker and/or the OS. </s>
<s> No separate driver should be required unless unique. </s>
<s> What you may need to do, is either try a &quot;restore point&quot; when the problem didn't exist or a OS repair. </s>
<s> An OS repair will make the required fixes by refreshing the OS. </s>
<s> This method shouldn't replace or delete your current pgms. </s>
<s> etc. </s>
<s> already loaded. </s>
<s> It will however require access to the Vista restore/recovery(OEM) discs or from the hidden partition for same purpose. </s>
<s> Vendors and makers provide OEM discs for some small cost or free(maybe?) </s>
<s> if not shipped with system, contact them or website to order, it always good to have these discs &quot;in hand&quot;. </s>
<s> Review your manual or visit the maker support website in order how to access this process. </s>
<s> As always, backup any critical data or use the maker's process to create a system recovery/restore disc. </s>
<s> Again visit the makers' support website for detailed info. </s>
<s> I exclude any possible real h/w fault and this maybe a cause of your problem. </s>
<s> Only a kybd. </s>
<s> replacement will fix it if nothing seems to work. </s>
<s> If you have any warranty, use it or call service support to attempt fix. </s>
<s> When asking for help provide all details of your system, etc. </s>
<s> in order to better respond to your query. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> posted this in laptop forum. </s>
<s> I can always do a repair install for this if I have to, I do have the disks. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I cross posted in the laptop troubleshooting forum. </s>
