thanks for all the comments.
the full model number of my gateway is zx6971-ub10p.
i checked the voltage output of my power supply.
the power suppy label states it has an output of 19 volts.
mine had an output of 18.7 volts.
i did take a quick look at the capacitors when i had my case off, but didn't see anything like the pictures on bad caps.
i will be taking the case off again an will do a more thourgh look at the caps., and anything else that you guys think needs checked.
any additional help is appreciated.
