for curtain #2. i think you have somewhat a known entity for support with compaq whereas you may or may not with a no-name pc.
i think the nec is a great monitor.
you should be able to find a decent pair of speakers for $10.00 us.
the balance of the money can go towards any future software and/or peripherals you need.
good luck.
