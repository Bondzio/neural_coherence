Their spec is identical, and all the components are original. So why is it that one CD-ROM drive will recognise CDRWs, but the other won't? CDRs are no problem, and it doesn't make a difference if it's Mac OS standard or ISO 9660. I've checked the extensions, software, control panels, everything I could think of! What am I missing? Thanks for your help so far! SJ

As the optical device gets older, it is not unusual for the laser to loose its original &quot;brightness&quot;. It could also be that the lens is dirty. I have a G3 that will NOT read Gold colored CD's! You have not mentioned if the non-reading iMac can read commercially produced CD's. You only mentioned CDRWs so the assumption is that it can. Commercial CD's use a different technique in production, they are not all burned, many times they are either &quot;stamped&quot; or Layered. If the CDRW is produced using a laser which is &quot;not up to spec&quot; there is a possibility that the &quot;pits&quot; are not being burned deep enough to register with another &quot;not up to spec&quot; CD reader. A replacement CDROM can be had on eBay for a small(ish) sum and are quite easy to replace. Hope this helps P

That just leaves the underpowered laser in the iMac or the underpowered CD burner making the CDRW's. Could you try a CDRW from a different source? I would still lean toward the iMac CDROM though P

But waning laser power on the iMac, makes sense - considering its age and the previous owner's frequent usage, deduced from clues he left on the hard drive ;0) I don't need it to read CDRWs, as I only bought it to fix the other iMac (failed power supply). I just couldn't work out why they behaved differently, given that they were the same spec. Many thanks! SJ
