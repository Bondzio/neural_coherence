<s> I have a HP Pavilion a6030 desktop and want to upgrade the PSU and graphics card. </s>
<s> It is currently a Delta 300W psu but I am not sure if a standard ATX PSU will fit. </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> ATX power supply dimensions are easy to find on the internet so you can check if a stock unit will do. </s>
<s> It should take a standard PSU unit such as Antec ATX with no problems, go to a 500w or so and you will be fine, have used them in Hp units as retrofit. </s>
<s> Many thanks, I will try that as soon as possible. </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick response </s>
