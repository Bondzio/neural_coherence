excellent.
i'm concerned with backing up primarily.
i'm a photograper and generate gigabytes of digital photo files.
i have a separate mirror hard drive that i keep up to date, but also like to do periodic incremental updates on disc.
the most recent took 12 dvds, so i thought the dual layer might be a more practical answer, but it wouldn't work if regular dvd drives couldn't read the dual layer discs.
thanks very much, dan
