some techs can't wrap their head around that.
and again the jumpers and cable types do matter.
well discussed but no where did i find where you told exactly what you used.
could be that issue i noted or could be the jumper and cable issues.
but your posts omit details and i didn't duplicate web content on jumpers and cables.
makes you wonder if it's one or the other usual issue.
