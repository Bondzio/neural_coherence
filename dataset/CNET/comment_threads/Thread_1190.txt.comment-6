...basically, because I wanted two.
The H2C was a compromise actually, especially as it has some corners cut for a supposedly uber-duper system.
But it is decent hardware I have to say, and the naysayers don't appreciate how much has to go into a stable overclock to a level that a major manufacturer is willing to support.
The other major reason for the compromise is that I'm a Dell corporate customer and I buy enough from them a year to secure good discounts, and this applies to everything they sell me including all the XPS machines I've bought from them.
Glad I was of some help, hoping you get some decent OC's.
