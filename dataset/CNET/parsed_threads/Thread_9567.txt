<s> Make sure you actually created a second partition of 150GB...it's not automatically created. </s>
<s> You can boot to your XP CD to verify this and create/delete partitions. </s>

<s> 127GB is a standard limitation unless you install SP2, a free (but large) download from Microsoft for all legitimate users. </s>

<s> To see if the motherboard can see the whole drive capacity. </s>
<s> If it shows there, then Windows can see it also, if you have SP2 installed. </s>
<s> Go to drive management and look there. </s>
<s> GO TO: Start Control Panel Administrative Tool Computer Management Disk Management Right click on the box that shows 'Unallocated' ...you can create and format the partition from there </s>
