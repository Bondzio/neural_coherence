go with a company called bunnie computers.
i have their hare performance pro, and i am in to the same thing converting to dvd.
bunnie computers has the new pentium 4 prescott that neither dell, ibm, or sony has yet to offer.
this difference is; dell (512kb l2 cache) bunnie (1mb) l2 cache.
you do the math :o) plus it glows
