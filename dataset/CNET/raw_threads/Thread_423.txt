Thinking of purchasing a 250 GB or 300 GB external drive for backup. I like what I have read about the Dantz Retrospect 7 Professional software. Will definitely automate backup. Which drive would you purchase? LaCie or Maxtor? Appreciate you helping me out!

Just read the heart stopping stories in these forums. Is a second copy enough? Then you're OK, but don't count on it to replace a proper backup. Bob
