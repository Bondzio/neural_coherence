hard disk cases that are well ventilated.
i like a small quiet fan but if it's for some server room i don't wince at a louder fan that pushes more air.
at the office most usb drives are self assembled units.
we get some drive on sale and then pick up some usb housing.
all of us know what a screwdriver is so it's not very challenging to put the 2 parts together.
-&gt; let me share what i use to sync my stuff with my external drive.
syncback (google.com) gets this done for me.
