There are TONS of good PC's.. Go to Circuit CITY to make a purchase..Circuit CITY has a Good Customer Service policy..
I just built my first PC/but the LENOVO Brand seems really interesting.. .. DELL makes great PC's and Laptops..but you fairly well get stuck w/the configuration you intitally purchased..upgrades are risky.. .. TOSHIBA makes great products.. .. SONY/is expensive....I quess there are SONY fans out there..I have a SONY Burner Drive(its excellent).. .. PanaSonic makes LapTops called TOUGH-Books..take a look there.. ..
ACER...I saw an ACER at Circuit CITY-a LapTop...didn't need a LapTop but was vert tempted..nice Priced LapTop.. .. $$5000.00 will get you one heck of a PC.
