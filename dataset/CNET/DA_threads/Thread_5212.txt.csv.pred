1.1.1	I 've watched half of my new & quot ; Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory & quot ; on my home computer , which sports a Pioneer BDC-202 Blu-Ray player .	St
1.1.2	Now , however , I can read and write other disks , but the 202 has stopped recognizing Blu-Ray disks altogether !	St
1.1.3	The only updates I 've made are Microsoft 's -- updates I 've grown increasingly wary of -- and I 'm wondering if it could be the updates that are creating this problem !	St
1.1.4	Not only will my PowerDVD 8 not see it , neither can I get my system to see any content .	St
1.1.5	Indeed , it thinks there is no disk there .	St
1.1.6	Does anyone have any ideas why this might be happening ?	Ques
1.1.7	I ca n't believe it 's a hardware problem , but who knows ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks !	St
1.1.9	John	St
1.2.1	That tells me it 's unlikely a software problem .	St
1.2.2	But try reinstall the software anyway ; it ca n't hurt .	Sug
1.2.3	Of course hardware do fail sometime but hopefully this is not the case .	St
1.2.4	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	Thanks , but there 's no software I can retry .	St
1.3.2	I go to the DVD drive icon and click on it , and it does n't see any disk .	St
1.3.3	Yet if I put a standard DVD into it , it will read it just fine .	St
1.4.1	a BD-rom drive can be had for about $ 50 now .	St
1.4.2	As for why dvd works but not BD , my understand is that there 2 different scanning laser ( 1 for dvd and 1 for BD ) .	St
1.5.1	Strange , but I popped in my Stargate Blu-Ray disc today and it plays fine .	St
1.5.2	Willy Wonka used to play fine , too , but now my system ca n't see the disk .	St
1.5.3	Why would it see other Blu-Ray discs , but not a disc that had played once with ease ?	Ques
1.5.4	If I ca n't get a workable answer , I 'll have to buy a fifty dollar LG disc player .	St
1.6.1	go to the store and get another one .	Sug
