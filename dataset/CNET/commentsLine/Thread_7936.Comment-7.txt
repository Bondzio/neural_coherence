calculators and it calculated your current psu requirement at 338 watts.
if you add another 4870 gpu, another hdd, another dvd plus 4 usbs and 2 120mm fan it only calls for psu with 527 watts &lt;40 amps.
i'm a firm believer in capacity or room to grow but a 1000 watt psu for a system requiring less than 350 watt or 527 watts is over the top even for this builder of 22 years.
good luck on your choices and your build.
