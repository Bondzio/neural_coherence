i have 4 Maxtor Diamonds that have been running steadily for 2+ years with narry a prob so disregard that very helpful and informative last reply.
i always love people that reply with absolutely no help.
Wasted space and time.
Try goind to My computer&gt;right click&gt;manage and make sure everything looks ok there under the volume it should say online in one area and healthy in the other.
if it doesn't right click and utilize tools.
Google any problems.
There is a world of answers out there.
Hope that helps a little.
