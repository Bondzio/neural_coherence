<s> Hi, yestreday, I used PC and connected my WD 500G HDD. </s>
<s> I am stupid, I know. </s>
<s> Anyways, when I used them, the USB- the side of HDD, not PC, was removed accidentally. </s>
<s> I reconnected it soon, but it was not respond at all. </s>
<s> I tried to use other computers, both PC, and Mac, but some said it is not respond, or said &quot;Searching preconfigured driver folders&quot; forever. </s>
<s> Now I do not have my own laptop, because it also has probelem and I sent it to be fixed. </s>
<s> I have bunch of important stuffs in this HDD, do you know how to resolve this issue in stead of endanger the memories? </s>
<s> My HDD's light is on when I connect to PC. </s>
<s> My HDD has kinda weird sound when I connect, but its gonna be stooped in seconds. </s>
<s> My HDD cannot show up in &quot;my computers&quot;. </s>
<s> Please help me! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> As the old saying goes &quot;You only lose what you didn't backup&quot;. </s>
<s> That's especially true for external hard disks, that are so prone to failures and thus utterly unsuited to store the only copy of important stuff. </s>
<s> That being said, there are 2 things you can do yourself: 1. </s>
<s> See what Disk Management (a program in Windows) says about the disk. </s>
<s> If it can't find the disk, go to step 2. </s>
<s> If it says something like &quot;unallocated&quot; or &quot;unformatted&quot; try data recovery software like RECUVA or GETDATABACK (see one of top posts in this forum &quot;lost and found&quot;; read all!) </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Take the disk out and mount it in another enclosure. </s>
<s> With some luck, it's only the electronics in the enclosure that's somehow damaged and the disk is OK and will function in a new enclosure. </s>
<s> If both steps fail, it's time to send your disk to a data recovery company and pay the bill. </s>
<s> That &quot;weird sound&quot; isn't promising and might make it rather expensive. </s>
<s> Think USD 1000. </s>

<s> Thank you for answering. </s>
<s> I tried, but I cannot see the HDD in disk management. </s>
<s> And how do I disk ou from the HDD? </s>
<s> I can't open it and I don know how to do it. </s>
<s> Could you help me out? </s>
<s> There might be some screws you can loosen. </s>
<s> And else there's always that data recovery company. </s>
