<s> I installed my new graphic card and it worked great. </s>
<s> I installed drivers, rebooted and it was working great. </s>
<s> After some time i rebooted the computer again and my monitor won't receive a signal. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> It sounds like you upgraded the video card. </s>
<s> Did you upgrade the power supply so it wouldn't fail later? </s>
<s> I didn't Are there any chances that my new graphic card isn't working? </s>
<s> If the power supply was barely up to the job then as time passes it ages and then can't do the job. </s>
<s> This is the most common thing I encounter and it may be something else but I can only use the clues provided so that's my best guess. </s>
<s> If you want more ideas, why not supply make, model, of the parts under discussion? </s>
