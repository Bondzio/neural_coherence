i was told i can change the operating system to win 8 but there is no real need at the moment.
as far as backup is concerned i have a few doks between 16 and 32gb each - all i needed was a way to download the pictures - but then it looks like a small laptop will be needed and we have one somewhere if one of the kids haven't already borrowed it.
maybe google will fix picasa, anyway i am sure that whatever happens will be interesting.
thanks again for the thoughts - heavy bob any idea on a reasonably priced motor-cycle or advice on a walkabout lense for a canon 7d?
have fun - light mike
