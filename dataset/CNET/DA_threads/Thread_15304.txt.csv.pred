1.1.1	I'd like to upgrade my video card, as it can't play new games very smoothly, and seems to be the bottleneck here are the specs: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01070924&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&product=3440615 I'd like to stay under 150, but i'd be willing to go a bit over i was thinking a 8800 gt?

1.2.1	If you are going to install an aftermarket card in that unit you should upgrade the power supply since the stock unit is pretty whimpy.	St
1.3.1	Whoops, 8120n, again, if you have issues after you install a stand alone vid card in that unit you should look into a stronger PSU to preclude problems and possible component failures.	St
