It's so close to the size of a modern netbook it made me wonder if I could load netbook software to make it a useful machine again. Right now it's on Windows ME. (When's the last time you saw that?) Current specs are: Intel Pentium&#63720; 266Mhz (2.0V/2.5V) w/MMX Technology Integrated Coprocessor Yes Processor Cache 32KB: (16KB code; 16KB data) External data bus width 64 bit External data/address bus speed 66 MHz Memory--maxed out at 96 meg

Instead, I would just do a reload of WinME to clear out all the old junks and make it useful as simple.. err.. web-browsing (if it is ever simple webpages).
