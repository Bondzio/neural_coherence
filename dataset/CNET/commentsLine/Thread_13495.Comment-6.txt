airlink technology and mfg is no better or worse than other brands.
they package wifi chipsets & rf just like the others do.
their firmware lack fancy features available in the linksys, netgear, dlink and buffalo brands but it works reliably.
your problem may be in setup as other replies suggest.
i will only add that if your ap/router is not mimo, you can expect poorer connections.
for the low price nowadays, always get a mimo (g or n) device.
the client need not be mimo.
