My only concern with the &quot;lazy&quot; way is: won't I lose the benefit of the 801.11n transfer rates because it will bottle neck at the D-Link router?
Because of that, I'm thinking that setting it up with the dual NAT config would be the better of the two options.
Don't think I would need to map anything to the security system - but won't know until I set it up I guess.
