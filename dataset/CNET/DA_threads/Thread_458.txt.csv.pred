1.1.1	I was wondering if my motherboard, which supports SATA 1.5 hardware would also support SATA 3.0 (not necessarily at the 3.0 speeds, but at least at 1.5).	St
1.1.2	I figure it would work, but I wanted to make sure.	St
1.1.3	I figured if I buy an SATA 3.0 hard drive now, whenever I get around to updating my motherboard, I'd be ahead of the game.	St
1.1.4	Comments/suggestions?	St
1.2.1	The key is to check the HD manufacturer's website on how to enable the SATA 3.0 HD to run on a SATA 1.5 motherboard/controller.	St
1.2.2	Some will work automatically.	St
1.2.3	Some will need to have a jumper set on the HD (or other fix).	St
1.2.4	Here is an example from Seagate: http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/faq/sata_lock.html	St
