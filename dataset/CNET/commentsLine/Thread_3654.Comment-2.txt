the range is limited by law.
since all makers have to abide by the same rules there is no router that will give you say &quot;double the range&quot; of the rest.
that alone means you won't be finding such a router.
as to 500 feet the laws hamper this as well as folk that don't know that such range is only across open space or line of sight.
as there is no such router and you are only beginning to learn about this i fear you won't find any router that you will be happy with.
