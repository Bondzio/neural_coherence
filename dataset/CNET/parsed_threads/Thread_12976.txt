<s> Hey, I've just installed a sata hard-drive as a secondary hard drive and it wont recognize it....it's win xp, and the mobo is an asus sli premium...any tips? </s>
<s> Have you formatted the drive? </s>
<s> XP won't see it without the drivers, and a friend found it necessary to also format it [used a Win 98 boot floppy]. </s>
<s> Installing the SATA as the boot drive using XP original install is a different matter. </s>
<s> Then you need to create a floppy from the MOBO driver CD, hit the F6 key when offered and later insertt the floppy created, so that XP will install the mobo drivers. </s>
<s> Confusing because it asks the question ere RAID or SCSI, but that actually includes SATA drivers. </s>
<s> You may have to activate it. </s>
<s> I did. </s>
<s> Go to My Computer. </s>
<s> Right click. </s>
<s> Go to manage. </s>
<s> You can figure it out from there. </s>
<s> Pretty straightforward. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Did you activate or turn on the SATA controller in the BIOS ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Just sayin thanks....i figured it out eventually on my own, and that's all I had to do lol, I kinda feel dumb, but now I know haha </s>
