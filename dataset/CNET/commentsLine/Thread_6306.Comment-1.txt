i can't believe how fast it is.
i got the amd x2 4400 with 1 gig ram, and a geforce 6800gt.
multitasking, unbelievabley fast.
i unpacked it, activated windows and away it went.
no problems at this time.
the only complaint i have is that there was an aol incon on the desk top for a free trial, but it was only there for a second.
no other garbage software.
