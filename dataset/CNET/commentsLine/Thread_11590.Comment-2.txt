why this is, is well discussed.
but here we go again.
since the battery is just a 300 cycle rated part and the warranty only calls the battery bad when it drops to 50% capacity you see that to get 8 hours a day for 2 years you need a battery that when new hits 16 hours and then in 2 years you are still getting your 8 hours.
what's odd about such a requirement is it's rarity.
you might find new students that want this or think it's a requirement but if it was then wouldn't there be plenty of choices?
ok, battery's done.
on to the digitizer.
what do you use now?
why i ask is that i find many ask for this then in a year they are back to mouse or pad.
