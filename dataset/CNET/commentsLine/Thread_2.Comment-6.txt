thank you bob, i have read the reply 17, which redirects me to the following site:  i am quite confused on what to do, i have had this router for over 2 years and i have usually been able to access its management.
i had to reinstall windows xp, and i have been unable to reinstall the routers software (which i am told is not too helpful).
as mentioned earlier, i have set up a static ip address, and i am trying to forward this port to my xbox 360. i'm sorry if i am repeating myself, but i have no idea where to go.
i am unable to manage anything related to the router, and therefore, i don't think i can follow the instructions on the website (which asks me to change the ip address of my router, which i am unable to do).
i feel as i am making a mountain out of a molehill.
thank you for help and patience
