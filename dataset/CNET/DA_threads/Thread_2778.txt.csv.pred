1.1.1	I need to take a HDD out of a HP Pavilion machine to use in another machine?	St
1.1.2	I opened the side panel & unscrewed the screw.	St
1.1.3	On the other side I can't access the screw coz there's this metal plate that covers the entire side.	St
1.1.4	The motherboard and everthing is attached to it.	St
1.1.5	How do I get the HDD out of that machine?	St
1.2.1	I don't know if this still holds, but at one time HP provided directions on their web page to install a new hard drive.	St
1.2.2	You will have to input the model of your Pavilion.	St
1.2.3	Hope the info that you need is still there.	St

1.3.1	Hey I hope this will help...	St
1.3.2	I actually did the same thing the other day.	St
1.3.3	1) Remove the Power supply 2) Unscrew the back screws and the side ones going into the metal panel.	St
1.3.4	3) Flip back the system board and then the side panel should be exposed.	St
1.3.5	I had to install a CD-burner the other day in one of these machines.	St
1.3.6	Good Luck.. Ray.	St
