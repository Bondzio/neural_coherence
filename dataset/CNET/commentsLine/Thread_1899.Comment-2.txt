since wifi is in the wide open, there are many reasons and causes for it to drop.
as to the unknown devices, since i can spoof the mac address you would never know if i connected to your network.
there are many tools to do this now as well as, well, more.
the industry has done a poor job in many areas.
both the router quality is not that good (proof?
why else would they issue firmware updates?)
and they don't explain that wifi is not a sure connection.
we can improve our setups with a move to tighter security (noted at the top of this forum) such as router defaults then change the ssid (keep it simple) and then wpa2 aes personal but i find most owners are not ready to do that.
