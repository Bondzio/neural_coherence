1.1.1	Hi , I have a machine with Win XP pro running , there is nothing special with the hardware , its standard .	St
1.1.2	Now suddenly I cant turn the machine on , every time I press the power on button , I hear a bleep sound and the monitor stays blank .	St
1.1.3	I cant even enter the machine to format it ... what should I do to make a simple format ?	Ques
1.1.4	maybe it is a hardware issue regards , Mirza	St
1.2.1	The beeps are a code to tell you what 's wrong .	St
1.2.2	Now check in the motherboard manual what this particular combination of beeps ( for example : 1 short one , 2 long ones ) means .	Sug
1.2.3	The usuals : - bad RAM - bad CPU - bad motherboard Yes , it 's surely hardware .	St
1.2.4	Formatting does n't make any sense .	St

1.3.1	ok , thanks actually it was a memory error , I changed the slots of my ram , now I 'm able to start my pc but after the initial screen the monitor simply fades to black , I cant start a formatting , anything ... the old win xp installation can not be started regards , mirza	St
1.4.1	You ca n't format from the old win xp installation .	St
1.4.2	You can only format from the xp installation CD .	St
1.4.3	So it might be time to find that .	St
1.4.4	Kees	St
1.5.1	I have the xp cd , but the problem is when I boot from the cd during startup ( first boot device set to cd rom ) then the installation can not be started , for some strange reason ...	St
1.6.1	must be hardware-related .	St
1.6.2	Maybe still a RAM issue , maybe something else .	St
1.6.3	Why not try memtest86 ( free download ) first ?	Sug
1.6.4	Anyway , you 're unlikely to get any effective help if you do n't tell more about the issue than that it has a & quot ; strange reason & quot ; .	St
1.6.5	Kees	St
1.7.1	ok..thanks , what details do you need about the machine and the problem ?	Ques
1.7.2	regards mirza	St
