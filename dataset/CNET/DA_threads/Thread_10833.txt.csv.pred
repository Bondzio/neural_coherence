1.1.1	I have a new PC , with adequate DRAM and a great chip to run VISTA Ultimate , and a laptop , running VISTA Home Premium .	St
1.1.2	Since I have used WIRED networks before with DSL service , I am guessing using a Cable modem wo n't cause any problems .	St
1.1.3	First , since I have to push the 60 feet of CAT5e wire through existing 2X6 walls , and co n't know exactly where the 110V wires are located , is it essential to use a wire locator to keep the CAT5e wire far enough away from the electrical circuit so as not to compromise the signal so it drops ?	Ques
1.1.4	Second , I have purchased a LINKSYS BEFSR41 Cable/DSL Router with a 4-port switch for my network , because I used the same router 8 years ago for my DSL modem and had no problems with speed or setup .	St
1.1.5	Is there a better wired router I should consider befoe I unwrap my BEFSR41 ?	Ques
1.1.6	Third , once I have the laptop connected to the router , should I buy a printer hub to connect my HP LaserJet 1300 and my OfficeJet 6210 to the router , or should I connect both printers to my PC and use printer and file sharing to enable my laptop to connect to both printers ?	Ques
1.1.7	Fourth , I have a Termaltake housing for a 500mb Western Digital external hardrive that has both a ESATA and a USB2.0 port .	St
1.1.8	I also have a LINKSYS Network Storage Link with two USB2.0 ports and an RJ45 ethernet port .	St
1.1.9	Should I connect the external hard drive directly to the PC , using the ESATA port , and then access the external hard drive using printer/files sharing with my laptop ?	Ques
1.1.10	Or , should I connect my LINKSYS Network Storage Link to one of the ports of the BEFSR41 , and keep my external hard drive connected to the network storage link so I can backup my files and folders on the external hard drive ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks for reading this long message , and for any advice you can send my way .	St
1.1.12	Thomboy	St
1.2.1	& quot ; is it essential to use a wire locator to keep the CAT5e wire far enough away from the electrical circuit so as not to compromise the signal so it drops ? & quot ; No .	St
1.2.2	The TWISTED PAIRS are there to negate such pickups .	St
1.2.3	I 'll decline explaining why this is so .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	Second , I have purchased a LINKSYS BEFSR41 Cable/DSL Router with a 4-port switch for my network , because I used the same router 8 years ago for my DSL modem and had no problems with speed or setup .	St
1.2.6	Is there a better wired router I should consider befoe I unwrap my BEFSR41 ?	Ques
1.2.7	If that works for you .	St
1.2.8	That 's a rather dated but fine product .	St
1.2.9	3 .	St
1.2.10	Third , once I have the laptop connected to the router , should I buy a printer hub to connect my HP LaserJet 1300 and my OfficeJet 6210 to the router , or should I connect both printers to my PC and use printer and file sharing to enable my laptop to connect to both printers ?	Ques
1.2.11	Absolutely your choice .	St
1.2.12	4 .	St
1.2.13	Fourth , I have a Termaltake housing for a 500mb Western Digital external hardrive that has both a ESATA and a USB2.0 port .	St
1.2.14	I also have a LINKSYS Network Storage Link with two USB2.0 ports and an RJ45 ethernet port .	St
1.2.15	Should I connect the external hard drive directly to the PC , using the ESATA port , and then access the external hard drive using printer/files sharing with my laptop ?	Ques
1.2.16	- & gt ; WOW , you got ESATA working ?	Ques
1.2.17	That 's fabulous .	Polite
1.2.18	Most owners can crack that nut .	St
1.2.19	Again it 's your choice on the setup .	St
1.2.20	5 .	St
1.2.21	Or , should I connect my LINKSYS Network Storage Link to one of the ports of the BEFSR41 , and keep my external hard drive connected to the network storage link so I can backup my files and folders on the external hard drive ?	Ques
1.2.22	Again , this is your choice .	St
1.2.23	I like the direct USB connection since NAS speed is abotu 1/5 that of a direct USB connection .	St
1.2.24	That 's sluggish .	St
1.2.25	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob for taking the time to read and respond to each of my questions .	St
1.3.2	You say that the BEFSR41 us a dated product .	St
1.3.3	Do you know of a better router for wired networks ?	Ques
1.3.4	I do n't need to keep the LinkSys wired router .	St
1.3.5	It sounds like keeping the LinkSys Network Storage Link and using the USB2.0 link to the router is your favored choice .	St
1.3.6	It is easy to do , and only saves a few bucks to keep the network storage link .	St
1.3.7	I am also grateful to better understand the way twisted pairs work in the CAT5e wires , as I do n't really know where the 110V circuit is located in the wall , and now I can get the job done without worrying about where it is .	St
1.3.8	Last question : I once was told that sharp bends in CAT5e wires compromise the speed of the signal .	St
1.3.9	Is this bolderdash or true ?	Ques
1.3.10	Many thanks , Bob	Polite
1.4.1	It 's a physics , electronics effect .	St
1.4.2	Read http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Pair Hopefully this will suffice for the explanation .	St
1.4.3	The sharp bends would have to be quite severe to create an issue .	St
1.4.4	You wo n't see this issue if you let the wire & quot ; flow & quot ; and do n't stress it over an 90 degree edge .	St
1.4.5	As to a better router , I found the BEFSR41 to not handle PC to PC traffic all that well .	St
1.4.6	If I connected my BEFSR41 to a switched hub the network performed better .	St
1.4.7	This has turned out to be true with most routers of that day .	St
1.4.8	Today 's units are usually better .	St
1.4.9	Try to use what gear you have .	St
1.4.10	You seem to be very close to a working system .	St
1.4.11	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the link to Wikipedia for the explanation of twisted pair technology .	St
1.5.2	I have an unopened box for a D-Link DIR-655 WIRELESS Router that I was going to return for credit .	St
1.5.3	Would it make any sense to use this router for a WIRED network , since it probably has more updated technology , unlike the LinkSye BEFSR41 that is from the dark ages ?	Ques
1.5.4	If I connect a switched hub to my BEFSR41 wired router , why will the PC to PC traffic move faster ?	Ques
1.5.5	Forgive me for asking these educational questions , because it takes far too much of your time to answer them and direct me to helpful sites , but maybe someday I can help someone else with the same problem .	St
1.5.6	Thanks for the advice and help , Thomboy	St
1.6.1	& quot ; If I connect a switched hub to my BEFSR41 wired router , why will the PC to PC traffic move faster ? & quot ; Because the switched hub in the BEFSR41 does n't keep up with 100Mb transfers .	St
1.6.2	Even the cheapest switches hubs helped curb the time when I copy a file between machines .	St
1.6.3	Since routers were pricey back then I would connect up the modem - & gt ; router - & gt ; switched hub - & gt ; PCs to get the best overall network speed .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Many thanks again , Bob , for the clarification about the switched hub .	Polite
1.7.2	I should be able to find an inexpensive one , and complete the network without problems , due to your help .	St
1.7.3	QUESTION : Is there any reason to use the D-Link DIR-655 Wireless router in place of the BEFSR41 for my wired network ?	Ques
1.7.4	I have been told over and over that using a wireless router for a wired network is OK , but wireless is more expensive .	St
1.7.5	COMMENT : The D-Link DIR-655 cost me $ 129 while the BEFSR41 cost $ $ 65 .	St
1.7.6	A cheap switched hub ca n't cost more than $ 30 or $ 95 versus $ 129 .	St
1.7.7	If the D-Link is better , I do n't mind spending $ 34 more for better long-term use .	St
1.7.8	Thanks again for the reply , Thomboy	St
1.8.1	I 'm a little taken aback with the prices you listed .	St
1.8.2	My recent upgrade was a Netgear WPNT-834 for 69 bucks refurb from geeks.com .	St
1.8.3	I found a Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 for 49 bucks on sale at Best Buy which is doing a stint running a Linux based router firmware since I wanted to do that for some time .	St
1.8.4	The gigabit wifi router is a nice touch since I doubt you 'll replace that any day soon .	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
1.9.1	Hi Bob : I bought the gigabit D-Link DIR-655 from Costco , but saw them advertised at cNet from other places for over $ 170 .	St
1.9.2	I bought the BDFSR41 from Best Buy as it was the only wired router they had in stock .	St
1.9.3	Maybe the Buffalo you bought would work for me ?	Ques
1.9.4	Since I do n't need the wi-fi function of the DIR-655 now , maybe using it is overkill ? ?	Ques
1.9.5	The think all the n , and pre-n routers are pricey with lots of problems -- setup , and even firmware downloads .	St
1.9.6	Even D-Link 's technical support is lacking if trouble comes along with sub-net mask , DHCP or IP addresses .	St
1.9.7	Thom	St
