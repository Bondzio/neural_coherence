1.1.1	I have one WRT54G connected to my DSL modem and configured as a Gateway.	St
1.1.2	I have a computer connected to one of the Gateway's LAN ports and another WRTG54G connected to an other of the Gatway's LAN ports.	St
1.1.3	The second WRT54G is configured as a Router.	St
1.1.4	Both are configured with WEP security.	St
1.1.5	When the computer cabled to the Gateway WRT54G is turned-off, another computer can maintain a flawless, highspeed Internet connection with the WRT54G configured as a Router.	St
1.1.6	When I turn-on the computer that is cabled to the Gateway, I lose the wireless connection on the WRT54G configured as the Router.	St
1.1.7	I can get the connection back by re-booting the computer with the wireless connection, but then I lose the Internet connection on the computer cabled to the Gateway.	St
1.1.8	Basically, I can only have one computer connected to the Internet at any given time.	St
1.1.9	Any suggestions?	St
