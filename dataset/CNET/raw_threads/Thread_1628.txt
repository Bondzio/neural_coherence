746	0	40390	473414	NR	InStyle76	10/9/04 6:49 PM	1.09734774E12	Media sharing via LAN	I was thinking aboutgetting something like the D-link DSM-320 or Hauppauge MediaMVP, but neither have very good reviews either because they acted inconsistently w/ different file types or streamed low-quality media. the Turtle Beach AudioTron got rave reviews, but it only deals with audio files (albeit very well). If anyone can point me to a good device that can stream both audio and video from an external hard drive, I'd greatly appreciate it!
