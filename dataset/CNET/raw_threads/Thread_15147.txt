Finally decided to try it and I get an error message stating &quot;USB device Not Recognized&quot; &quot;One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned&quot;. I have tried the cable on two laptops and two desktops; operating systems ranging from the current Windows 7; Vista and Windows XP. All with the same results. Going into device manager on the Xp system; it tells my that there is an &quot;Unknown Device&quot; and that there are no drivers installed for it. Did extensive research on the web; and every where it says that no drivers are required for a powered USB cable. Any suggestions or alternatives. Have had the cable to long to return it; so that is out!

Well, a good gauge and twisted like the &quot;spec&quot; but it does work EXCEPT for USB HARD DRIVES which we do expect to fail on such things. Bob
