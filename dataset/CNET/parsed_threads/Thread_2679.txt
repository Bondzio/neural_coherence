<s> i have laptop running windows xp pro and a desktop with windows98 that i would like to network together. </s>
<s> ive tried with no success. </s>
<s> the laptop is wireless and i use a linksys router. </s>
<s> the desktop ,however, is connected through the modem via USB due to the fact it does not have ethernet. </s>
<s> on both when i go to the network they just have themselves on there and not the other. </s>
<s> another problem is i can ping from my laptop to my desktop but i cant the other way around. </s>
<s> can anyone tell me how i could network these together? </s>
<s> as a router, it supposed to have several rj45/ethernet port. </s>
<s> a USB connection, you will need to ask your ISP for an ethernet type of modem or buy a router that does. </s>
<s> Have you checked the Network Properties, in particular the configuration of your network card? </s>
<s> I played with the different speeds and eventually found some settings that let all my computers talk to each other. </s>
<s> Double-click on the network-connected icon in your taskbar, then Properties. </s>
<s> Before you click Configure, just see if both your computers have the same things under 'This connection uses the following items'. </s>
<s> It's not important that they do, but the experts say that they should. </s>
<s> Best, Jack </s>
