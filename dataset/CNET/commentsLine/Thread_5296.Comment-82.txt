hi mr. jose these days most modern pc's ship with an integrated graphics card and all current generation machines are upgradeable unless otherwise stated, ask the sales representative if the machine is upgradeable.
unfortunately integrated graphics is never as good as the add-on cards and we currently have a wide range to choose from with sizes from 512mb to 2gb, also to remember is that onboard graphics cards uses your systems physical memory, meaning if you had 1gb system memory the graphics card would use 256mb leaving you with roughly only 744mb which is not a good idea if you want to run windows 7 smoothly.
other factors also play a role if you want to run current generation games meaning that the processor, memory, and hard drive of your system also plays a role.
you can choose between two existing graphic card manufacturers which i myself recommend and use, the first is nvidia geforce and the second ati radeon, if you were to choose any of these i would recommend the gt 200 series for nvidia and the hd 4000 for ati.
if i may ask you to post the full system specifications so that we can verify if the system as a whole will be able to play games that would be great, you can just ask the sales representative to compile a list with the specifications.
yours sincerely mr.w.
