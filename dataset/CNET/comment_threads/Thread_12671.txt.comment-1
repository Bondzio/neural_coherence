My computer is not recognizing my usb external hard drive.
I get the error message that the usb device is not recognized.
&quot;One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it.&quot; I don't know what to do, I've tried unplugging all USB devices, then plugging only the hard drive in, I've tried leaving everything unplugged for the night, and I even tried a system restore.
I'm running Vista ultimate 32bit on a hp dv6500t intel core 2 due 2.0ghz 2gb ram the hard drive is a Western Digital My Book Premium ES edtion
