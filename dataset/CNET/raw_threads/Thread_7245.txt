If I attach another IDE hdd my computer does not recognise either of them. This problem only happens with this hard drive. Any solutions please?

The best way, with newer drives, is to use an 80 conductor cable and set jumpers to CS (cable select). The 80 conductor cable has a specific way it needs to be connected to the MB. The important thing to note is that the blue connector goes to the motherboard.

Once in awhile you will find a drive that will not tolerate any second IDE device. This may confuse the new to IDE technician. After the initial shock and after encountering this a few more times it dawns on the tech that not all IDE devices can coexist. Yes they should but the awful truth is that a few don't. At least we have other solutions. I'll leave jumper and cable discussions out of my replies since that's been done many times and there are plenty of web pages about that. Bob

Both hd's are IDE When I plug in my maxtor hard drive with my cd both are recognised When I plug in my western digital hard drive with my cd drive neither are recognised however this hard drive is recognised by itself when the cd drive is not connected. So I feel that this one hard drive (western digital) which is only being recognised by itself has a problem. Any solutions please. I tried using jumpers. I only have one ide connector. I need to get this working so I can install windows on it. Please assist

Remember that I elected to not write about cables or jumpers as that's been done. Here's one thought. Test each drive on its own. Bob
4554	9	390864	3288135	3288133	ac1818	4/17/10 5:21 AM	1.27148166E12	Yes	As this pc works with other hard drives using the same cables I would expect it to work. I am quite sure that my jumpers settings are correct. Do you need an more details. Thanks

If the drives work one at a time but not together and you claim the cables and jumpers are fine then it's the usual problem I've seen over the years. Why not put these two each on their own IDE channel?
4554	13	390864	3288168	3288148	ac1818	4/17/10 5:51 AM	1.27148346E12	can't	don't have another channel. I have other sata connectors but not another ide one

And again the jumpers and cable types do matter. Well discussed but no where did I find where you told exactly what you used. Could be that issue I noted or could be the jumper and cable issues. But your posts omit details and I didn't duplicate web content on jumpers and cables. Makes you wonder if it's one or the other usual issue. Bob

Then when we emulate IDE the IDE ports can become disabled. The vicious cycle begins. My lesson on this is simple. Use an OS that supports SATA. Yes there are procedures that use a floppy drive but what to do when the floppy drive is broke, missing and the owner won't fix that? Bob
4554	19	390864	3288181	3288125	Steven Haninger	4/17/10 6:06 AM	1.27148436E12	Jumpers	I don't know the model #s, size or age of your Maxtor and WD drives but can tell you that I've never seen a specific jumper standard shared by all drive manufacturers or even between product lines from the same manufacturer. Since you mentioned using a HD with a CD ROM, I can tell you that this can often through a real monkey wrench into the works. Be careful of &quot;Master&quot; settings. Some will allow that setting if only one drive is installed and some consider that the master jumper position means that a slave exists and you cannot use it with a single HD. What you need is the instructions from the manufacturer for each drive model to figure out their scheme. Unfortunately the only experiences I've ever had with Maxtor drives have been bad so I avoid them. I also avoid trying to mix drives from other manufacturers or even vintages. If one is older IDE and one is called an EIDE, ultra ATA, etc., I wouldn't mix them on the same cable. Maybe if you know the HD model #s that might help dig up better information about what jumper settings are valid.

If I have a faulty ribbon cable in a computer is it ok to swap it with another ribbon cable which fits in the computer and makes the computer work or would the new one spoil my computer. Thanks, AC
4554	21	390864	3289147	3288179	R. Proffitt	4/19/10 5:33 AM	1.27165518E12	IDE cables are	Pretty much a generic item. If you researched this you found 2 common models with 3 connectors and two ribbon cable types. If you use the older ribbon cable type the worst that could happen is the drive data is corrupted. The newer ribbon cable type can be used without issue except you have to set the jumpers and the drives must &quot;like&quot; each other. I covered the old tech stumper earlier about drives that never work on the same IDE channel. This one has caused months of time lost for some techs. Some can't wrap their head about that. Bob
