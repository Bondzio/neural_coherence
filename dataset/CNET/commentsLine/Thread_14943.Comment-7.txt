im no pro but the s7 does not have flash support so your seeing mobile web with it and no official android market.
it was in my consideration for purchase.
i passed on it though and went with the elocity a7 and will also purchase the enspert idenity tab e201u.i think they are both better buys with full froyo out the box and the a7 can be easily modded to get android market.
you can also look for the s7 on youtube.
but your most likey to get some review from someone you can hardly understand:)
