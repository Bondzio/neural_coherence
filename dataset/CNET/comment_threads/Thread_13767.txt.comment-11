I have the same drive, Toshiba DVD-ROM SD-R2212 in my FUJITSU laptop (come to think of it, why does Fujitsu use a Toshiba drive in their computers?
), and it conked out suddenly on me.
It plays audio-CDs but doesnt even recognize DVDs anymore.
So has anyone found a solution to this?
or, I have to simply junk this and try to get an external DVD player or what?
