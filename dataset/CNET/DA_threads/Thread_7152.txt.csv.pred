1.6.1	just pick up whatever basic machine you can to handle your basic office needs ... for example just goto Dell 's site and see what their current & quot ; special & quot ; is or check HP or Gateway out possibly if you wanted to build it yourself i 'd say goto newegg and get some basic parts , keep it in the $ 400- $ 500 range unless you need to host a website or do something in addition to basic finances and office work	St
