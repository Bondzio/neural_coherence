I would love to have a BIOS where I can actually change things like my memory timings, cpu multiplier and FSB, and voltages (not gonna happen with the HP BIOS) Has anyone ever heard of them? Know anyone who has done this?

I found it cheaper to toss the board out and get one that was better all around. In closing, many of the Dell/HP/other designs have these settings cast in stone (or silicon) so don't bother wasting too much time on such boards. Bob
