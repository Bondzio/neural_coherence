No it's not that my machine is not completely working.
Like this problem struck me some 7-8 hours back and I had to switch off my machine from the main switch.
An hour later I switched on my PC again and I was able to enter into windows.
Something like this happens everytime so far and my machine is not completely blacked out yet.
I wanted to know what possible could be causing this problem.
Is it really a hard disk problem or can this be causing due to something else.
I hope I am not reading you wrongly..
