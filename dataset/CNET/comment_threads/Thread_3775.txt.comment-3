I have three different computers, but I do not run them at the same time.
Actually, I used to be able to run the old desktop off the USB connection off the DSL modem and the laptop off the Ethernet connector, and both ran at the same time at an acceptable speed.
But the new Dell doesn't run off the USB connection (I don't know why not--is that perhaps a clue?
), so I can only run one machine at a time.
I should get a router to run multiple machines, but that isn't relevant to the problem at hand.
Any other ideas?
