It finally arrived.
Its a Pentium 4 631.
It's SL9KG according to the box.
I forgot to look at the cpu.
But it says so on the box.
But its says 65nm according to cpuid.com.
Anyhow this thing is awesome.
It says 18 - 20 c degrees in speedfan.
And bios says about 25c degrees idol.
Not bad.
And I even turned down all the fans.
to low setting and I'm still getting those great temps.
Pretty cool for just a cpu change and nothing else.
Thanks, ivnj
