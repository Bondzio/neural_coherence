Proffitt	8/6/06 5:33 PM	1.15488558E12	I'l guess it has no RAM.	http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/BIOSBeepCodes.asp and other sites note this one when there is no RAM installed. Another site notes this when the video card came unplugged. Some gift machines come without RAM since the owner recycled it. Bob

First thing on these &quot;unknown&quot; units is to pull the side panel & see if everyone is home! Then plug it in & fire it up, watching PSU fan to make sure it's workng. Only then is it &quot;play time&quot;
