It works pretty much the same as when you're connected to your CAT5 network.
In addition to the set-up described in the previous message for the &quot;client&quot; computer, you first need to make sure the printer is shared (Start -&gt; Printers & Faxes -&gt; right-click on printer to be shared & select &quot;Sharing&quot;.
You may also need to check to make sure all computers are members of the same workgroup in order to share resources (right-click on &quot;My Computer&quot;, select &quot;Properties&quot;, then click on the &quot;Computer Name&quot; tab.
Click on the &quot;Change&quot; button if you need to change the workgroup name.
You'll need to restart the computer for the change to take effect.
I actually did this just this afternoon on my home wireless network.
