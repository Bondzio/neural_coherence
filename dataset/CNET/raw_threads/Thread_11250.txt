I have a work computer and a personal computer at home that share the monitor/keyboard/mouse and would also like it if they could share the printer. Both systems run Win XP pro and access the internet via a netgear router(wireless but both are hardwired). My work computer has wireless but my personal does not. If I added a print server could my work computer access it via wireless(while still on VPN) while my personal used USB? Thanks for any help.

Think it over and over and over and you'll understand why a VPN drops other network connections. But you can plug the printer directly to the VPN'd machine and print. Nothing broken... Bob

If you have two computers running Win XP pro on the same Router, all you need to do is enable file/print sharing on both computers (Use the Network Setup Wizard) and as long as the computer with the printer on it is on, the other will have access to it.
