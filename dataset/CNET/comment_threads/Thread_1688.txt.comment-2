if so, and you have it set to automatically lock after a set time or when the screen saver activates, then you will see a gold or red lock at the bottom, next to clock.
If you right click, then click on engage internet lock or stop all internet activity, it still might not connect.
Try turning off the radio and wait about 10 seconds then enable the radio.
That should work.
