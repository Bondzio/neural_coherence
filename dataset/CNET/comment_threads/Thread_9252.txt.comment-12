HP 6110 All In One Running on XPSP2 Suddenly showed up as a non recognized USB Device Thought it was because I tripped over the cable and knocked out the USB cable from the machine and might have damaged the port.
But it wasnt.
As stated, deleted the HP from hardware.
Rebooted laptop, printer automatically showed back up.
Thank you!
