The kids have a Play Station 3 that would also connect to the internet and wondered if there is filtering available for that as well.

There are two that I know of. One is made by SafeEyes and the other is by ContentProtect. Richard http://www.filterguide.com/ratings.htm

No software is needed and it will work with any device that is connected to your network. It will also protect you against phising scams. http://www.OpenDNS.com
