see my earlier thread &quot;how to restore system if mb fails?
?&quot; started on 12/20/03.
i am convinced i have a hardware problem.
lockup occurs at random points after boot-up.
i took my system apart before christmas and really cleaned it out good.
removed all dust - but system still locks up.
seems to be locking up more than ever - had to re-boot 6 times today before it became stable.
(yesterday, had to re-boot 4 or 5 times before it became stable.)
i have the mb and power pack part numbers from compaq.
how can i try to be sure what i have to replace before ordering new parts?
note: there was no visible sign of bad capacitors.
power pack fan and cpu fan seem to be working fine.
(to repeat: i run win98se with all updates; on a compaq presario 5838 (500 mhz amd athlon cpu); 384 megs ram; compaq 2 button wheel mouse; logitech mouseware control center version 9.00.99; mouse driver version 9.00; internet explorer 6.0 + all updates; norton anti-virus 2000 with all latest virus updates (it has passed all virus scans including the latest update); network neighborhood enabled.)
