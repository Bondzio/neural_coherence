I just got the following DFI Lanparty UT nF4 Ultra-D AMD Athlon64 X2 3800+ 2GB OCZ RAM 250 Seagate SATA with NCQ eVGA GeForce 6600GT I am hoping this will last a good 5 years I also have a question about working with High Definition Video The minimum requirements for working with 1080i in Pinnacle Liquid Edition say it requires a 256MB Video Card. Will my 6600GT be able to handle it? or will I have to upgrade it?

I'm just wondering if the Pinnacle requirements were exaggerated in any way. Also, I've put together all my parts now, but I'm not sure what to do next. Is it time to install Windows? If so, do I just pop the CD in?
