hi.
i need a 1gb ddr pc2700/pc3200 ram module, a dvdrw, and a 128/256 mb agp graphics card.
right now my mobo is p4vm800 (  ).
hard disk is maxtor 60gb.
still with windows xp.
so tell me, should i just buy a new desktop pc, or continue with the upgrade?
the primary reason why would i bother to upgrade is i want to switch to windows 7 with its aero support... any advice is greatly appreciated!
