i've been doing the same research for a wireless(g)webcam for my baby that is arriving in may.
the issue is that many of these shitacular webcams use activex (and therefore require a pc with ie) in order to display the web cam contents.
this product:  should work with safari as it uses java to display content.
it explicitly states that it works in mac os environments as well ( and has web based administration).
it costs about $155, and i've heard from at least one other mac user that it works fine.
hope this helps, loert
