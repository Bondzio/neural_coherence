Open &quot;My Computer&quot; in my Windows XP(stop laughing, I know it's old). Drive shows up but will not open. After many moments waiting the error message comes up: &quot;Cannot open due to I/O damage&quot; I need all the info recovered as it stores pictures of a recently deceased daughter of mine. I'm low tech, so take it easy. I went to Seagate website to download drivers for updating, could not even find my product! Downloaded Driver Manager and it says it's not plugged in.... Help - I'm confused.

You open the case and remove the drive. With a little luck, it will have a standard PATA or SATA drive on the inside. Most do but I've seen some proprietaries. If it's just a standard drive, you connect it to a port on the motherboard. Cross your fingers, boot the machine and hope its recognized. If so, you extract your data and make immediate extra backups. Afterward, you replace your external with two of them. Good luck.

If you replace the cable with anything longer, you're almost certain to get wierd errors because the timing isn't right. Generally replacing the cable that came with the drive is not a good idea because of that.
