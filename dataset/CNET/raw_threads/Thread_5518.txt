When I type, the key strokes are &quot;running&quot; like this: If I type word keey, theere aree two or three leetters eee. I am a good typist and I neeveer had this problem. I have to backspace all the time to clean up the typos. I noticed lettere &quot;ee&quot; is the most trouble somee. Any idea what is causing this? Any settings to change? This started a few weeeks ago. TIA.

Then replace the keyaboard and before, look for a Keyboard Trojan like we read at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=16933&messageID=186566&tag= There are dozens more like this one and one of their telltale signs are keyboard oddities. I usually find such with a scan with HOUSECALL. I can't trust the installed antivirus because... it can be compromised. Bob
