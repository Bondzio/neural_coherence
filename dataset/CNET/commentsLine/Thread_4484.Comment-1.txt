purchased a machine about 9 months ago.
shortly after buying it, i was getting error messages and the drive could not be detected.
after a week or two, i could not access the hard drive at all, so i was sent a replacement drive (about a month after purchase).
two-three months later, i again had the same problem, so i replaced the hard drive again, thinking i had bad luck and had gotten two bad hard drives.
this time i purchased it at retail and did not go through warranty as i needed the machine that weekend.
over the past month i have been having the same problem again.
when booting, i occassionally notice that the ide detection process would not show the hard drive and i would get the error: disk boot failure, insert system disk and press error usually after one or two restarts, the machine would right itself and i would not have the error message again.
yesterday, i got received this error and regardless of how many times i rebooted, i continued to get this error.
thinking it may be a bad ide cable or channel, i proceeded to do the following: switch the cd-rw and dvd drive to ide channel 2 and switch the hard drive to ide channel 1. switch the hard drive ide cable for a new cable.
switch back the hard drive to ide channel 2. regardless of what i now do, i continue to have the same error message when i try to boot, about 98% of the time: disk boot failure, insert system disk and press error any suggestions as to what i should do?
