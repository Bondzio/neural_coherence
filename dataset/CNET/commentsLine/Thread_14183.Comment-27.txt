i was a special education teacher and we used apple's at work starting in the early 1980s.
they had one floppy drive, no hard drive, green monatone screens.
i bought an apple iic for myself in 1986 and took a class in basic and tried to convert it to apple basic for myself.
thanks for asking the question.
it is fun to surf down memory lane.
