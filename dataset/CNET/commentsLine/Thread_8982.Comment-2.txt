&quot;will they show my existing data files?&quot; the answer from my experience is no.
i've yet to see many raid arrays survive even when we move the drives to the same chipset and controllers.
this is a testament to the addage &quot;we only lose what we don't backup.&quot; but those external raid capable nas boxes do work.
