<s> I am an artist/photographer, retired Art Educator...my new life focus is on merging my personal photography and computer art techniques. </s>
<s> My intent is to print out on specialty paper, as well as on canvas to merge to framed canvas to extend the image using acrylics, etc. </s>
<s> I have an iMac 800, but find memory, speed and size of screen limiting my work. </s>
<s> I was just ready to plunge in and buy a G5 tower and at least a 20inch screen, when I learned of the intel processor coming soooooooon. </s>
<s> As I'm on a fixed income and this may be the last computer purchase (I've said this 4 times already....ah well)...it is important that I understand my options. </s>
<s> Help...I'm asking for your opinions....thanks. </s>
<s> The faithful will meet and maybe it begins... </s>
<s> The Intel processors are not going to change the Mac line up over night and will almost certainly not change the machine you are considering buying, the PowerMac G5. </s>
<s> Maybe the Mini & iBook will go Intel first and others follow later but I think you can be sure that the PM, high end, will continue to run the G5 processor because it is still better than the current Intel offerings. </s>
<s> The PowerMac G5 will continue to be driven by G5 processors for quite a considerable time. </s>
<s> As there are only a few days left, you may as well wait until all the surprises have been announced at the Mac Expo though, you may find the PM has a speed bump and maybe a price change. </s>
<s> You still can't beat a Quad PM G5 P </s>
<s> My kid's going to college this year and I'm not buying 2 laptops. </s>
<s> The change will determine sale(s) here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> but I'm not trying to sell you anything. </s>
<s> This poster is not in the market for a laptop, does not use Windows at all and is looking for a higher end machine than a laptop. </s>
<s> Your reasoning is valid for your own reasons. </s>
<s> However, not everyone will want the ability to double or triple boot different OS's or to change horses in mid-stream. </s>
<s> Many moved to Mac to get away from Windows so the ability of a machine to run both is not a great selling point to them. </s>
<s> I doubt the majority of dyed in the wool Windows users will purchase one of the Intel Macs just because it will run Windows as well as OS X. </s>
<s> They probably have no intention of spending the extra cash on something that will do both when they will only ever use the one. </s>
<s> Granted, some will and you have the case for that. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Word from my developer friend is that the PC emulator is now very usable in the Mactel developer machines. </s>
<s> One can guess the speedup is that no emulation of the CPU's instructions must occur. </s>
<s> There will be some pundits that will dig in and yell &quot;PowerPC will be fine&quot; but given what I've seen I would not pick up a new machine based of the old CPU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Emulator, how would that effect the performance of OS X? </s>
<s> If Apple do not put Intels into the existing Power Mac cases in January 2006, are you advocating that everyone wait until they do? </s>
<s> As I said earlier, not everyone wants Windows and Intel do not have anything that touches the Quad G5, right now. </s>
<s> In the future they certainly will do but that will not make the PM G5 unusable. </s>
<s> For the average Mac buyer, not the switcher, the fact that a Mac can run Windows is moot. </s>
<s> Their main concern is how well does it run OS X. </s>
<s> That would be the only thing that I would be concerned with. </s>
<s> If I need a new Mac now, and are not concerned whether it runs WIndows or not, how long should I wait before Intel produce something comparable to the Quad G5 and Apple put it into a machine? </s>
<s> Of course, Intel may have some secret processor that they have not mentioned but I think that Apple will wait until the change to Intel, on the PM range, does not mean a performance drop. </s>
<s> JMO P </s>
<s> MacOSX also feels like it's pumped up too. </s>
<s> Can I ask if you've seen the Mactel developer machine? </s>
<s> I'm a bit lucky in that I don't have to keep absolutely mum about it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There have been a leak or two flying around but they all seem to concentrate on the machines ability with Windows. </s>
<s> There was a mention of OS X not suffering but no details. </s>
<s> I think the G5 has a little left in it, witness the Quad version which seemed to have come from left field, but I'm not sure that IBM will concentrate too much on further development of the G5 or it's production. </s>
<s> I'm sure there will be further development but not enough to handle a complete product range. </s>
<s> Maybe just the high end PM's until Intel revs up the development of a consumer model high end 64 bit processor. </s>
<s> I note that there was no mention, that I saw, of the new Yonah processor from Intel. </s>
<s> I guess we will all find out what's going on, next week. </s>
<s> Should be interesting. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> It seems like Mother Apple will sweep away all the Windows Microsoft programs with an OSX Tiger for all the Windows fans.......We all know how many holes, worms, viruses, etc. </s>
<s> Windows has......Microsoft better worry that Apple will enter into their territory with a superior operating system without any of the problems Windows offers.....It will not be just a hardware move, but a software move.....Should be interesting to have OSX being able to run on any Intel based machine .... </s>
<s> Save some money and get more applications. </s>
<s> The iMac can do everything you want by adding RAM memory. </s>
<s> Need more help, email me back. </s>
<s> &quot;Should be interesting to have OSX being able to run on any Intel based machine ....&quot; Apple is a hardware company and their aim is to sell as much hardware as possible. </s>
<s> Allowing OS X to run on any Windows box is probably not going to happen. </s>
<s> The current Intel driven Macs do not allow the use of Windows as the system does not use a BIOS as such. </s>
<s> Vista supports the new method, whose name escapes me, and will probably run on the Intel Macs, but OS X will almost certainly not run on a box that was not sold, or licensed, by Apple </s>
<s> When comparing notes with parents that sent their kid to school with a pricey mac laptop, the kids whined in 1 year for another Windows laptop. </s>
<s> Not all but too many. </s>
<s> Since it appears that Vista in BETA form does boot and run, the Intel Mac may save me from such a fate. </s>
<s> If it was not for this, we would not get the Mac. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Steve Jobs announced Apple is shipping the new iMacs now with the Intel Duo Core processor. </s>
<s> By waiting, you have gained a speed improvement of over 200%, a bigger HD, more ram, and it sells for same price as the olde iMacs! </s>
<s> I just bought a Dell XPS 400 With Windows Media Edition. </s>
<s> This is replacing my Mac. </s>
<s> I do a lot of Graphic work, infact it is almost all that I use it for. </s>
<s> The Dell is as goog, if not better in many respects. </s>
<s> One real good reason for the Dell over Apple is that you will be able to use all those online videos. </s>
<s> And I mean all of them. </s>
<s> The Apple got me so frustrated because the old style browsers will not play online videos. </s>
<s> I also set up video conferences with my Dell and can talk to Dell people and Mac people. </s>
<s> Mac would like you to only talk to other Macc's. </s>
<s> It might have been true that Mac's were the graphic stars some years ago BUT not anymore... </s>
<s> What Mac & OS was it that you replaced with a Dell? </s>
<s> &quot;I also set up video conferences with my Dell and can talk to Dell people and Mac people. </s>
<s> Mac would like you to only talk to other Macc's.&quot; I don't understand that statement. </s>
<s> You can talk to Mac people using your Dell but Mac people can only talk with Mac people? </s>
<s> Something not right there P </s>
<s> I haven't had any problems playing various kinds of online videos in a while now. </s>
<s> Are you sure you were doing this recently? </s>
<s> As for chatting, yes, things could be much improved there, but Apple does support chatting with PC users because iChat users can video chat with anyone using the latest version of AIM. </s>
<s> Yahoo Messenger also works, but with no sound. </s>
<s> There are other options, but those are the ones I'm familiar with. </s>
<s> Anyway, back on topic, I'd certainly wait to get a new Intel machine if I was in the market for one. </s>
<s> The MacBook and the new iMac are VERY impressive and things will only get better. </s>
<s> However, the Power Macs (I wonder what they'll be called now, because the word Power will certainly be dumped) will probably be the last to switch, because the change was mainly due to the fact that they couldn't figure out how to put G5s into laptops. </s>
<s> The iBooks and the mini will probably be next in line for the Intels, due to their small form factor. </s>
<s> Also, as a VirtualPC user, I find the possible ability to boot into either OS very intriguing! </s>
<s> It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out. </s>
<s> Apple has a long history of abandoning users when Apple decides that their technology is obsolete. </s>
<s> On the one hand, one can be philosophical and acknowledge that this is part of doing business with Apple -- you must be ready to spend big bucks to upgrade your hardware when Apple commands you to do so. </s>
<s> It is likely that, sooner rather than later, the Mac OS will be specific to Intel hardware and you will be left in the cold. </s>
<s> Knowing that history, if I were on a fixed income I believe I would soldier on with the old machine until the situation settles down. </s>
<s> I tried a quad G5 with 4 gig memory in local Apple store a week ago. </s>
<s> It screams in Photoshop. </s>
<s> With 1 gig dual G5's don't scream, but they do reasonably well. </s>
<s> On the other hand We have several laptops at home that have 1 or 1.25 G memory and they do reasonably well in Photoshop. </s>
<s> One of laptops is going to get a second 1 G memory and should be significantly faster with added memory. </s>
<s> To have an idea what your machine is doing go to the Activity Monitor which lets you see what is running, how much primary task uses in time and memory and details of disk, I/0, etc. </s>
<s> Real good peek at working. </s>
<s> It takes about 3-5% of cpu to run, so don't leave it on all the time. </s>
<s> If you use laptops then the side ports can support an eternal screen. </s>
<s> It is beside the built in, not a larger of internal screen. </s>
<s> I have a 12 inch and 17 external. </s>
<s> Makes lots of sense as big screen can contain photo and small one all the menus. </s>
<s> One good part of G5 big boxes is that they can supprt lots of displays, either huge big screen or several small ones. </s>
<s> And slots can have extra display cards. </s>
<s> My old 7500 can have 3 displays at once. </s>
<s> I think these same cards can run in new G5's slots which would make an impressive simulator for one use. </s>
<s> Imaging a 20 inch screen (or larger in center and two on each side of say 17 inch. </s>
<s> Almost like flight simulators. </s>
<s> Enough dreaming. </s>
<s> The intel replacement of iMac sounds like a limited compromise as there is only two slot memory. </s>
<s> 2 gigs. </s>
<s> When we get going in digitizing our family history box of photos over the last century and half we will probably spring for huge memory used G5 rather than intel. </s>
<s> I presume Adobe will have photoshop upgrades in not too long a time, but we have paid dues already. </s>
<s> duke </s>
<s> I do not know what kind of graphic work you do, but Mac not PC is the industry standard for graphics, video, photography etc.. </s>
<s> Yes, PC's do have better usage in general and you can use PC's to view all videos on line, but there are work arounds I sure. </s>
<s> Dell makes a great PC, but even Dell has said that they would love to produce a Mac clone. </s>
<s> Something to think about. </s>
<s> Me personally, I prefer the G5 because it is true 64 bit computing as opposed to the 32-bit P4 core of the dual-core Intel Duo. </s>
<s> (That also made me wonder why they went with Intel when AMD chips are 64-bit now; ah well must have been a political/financial thing.) </s>
<s> I REALLY hope they do a last cycle upgrade on the G5, say to 3GHz, on the Powermacs before they switch to the Intel chips. </s>
<s> If you want the ultimate image processing machine right now..the Quad...if you want to be certain that five years down the road, you will still be happy...wait...I was disappointed that there was not a new Quad but I was also certain that there would not be as that is going to be the very last machine to change over as most of the pro software will have to go to a universal binary before professionals will change. </s>
<s> I will wait for an intel PowerMac. </s>
<s> Instead, in the meantime, I ordered a 30 inch screen (!!!) </s>
<s> and the new MacBook Pro laptop so that I can work with a faster machine than my dual 800 PowerMac which is long in the tooth and feels so very slow compared to pretty much any other machine nowadays. </s>
<s> With the laptop having Rosetta and four times faster than the old PowerBook, I figure it has to be about as fast or faster than the ldual 800 even in emulation and when the new software is intel native...it will fly. </s>
<s> I will then get the PowerMac and end up with a nice laptop for work on the road and take it with the camera for on sight work...the best of both worlds. </s>
<s> The screen naturally will go with the intel PowerMac. </s>
<s> All of this to say, if you are going to work with large files which require a lot of RAM, you have no choice but to go for the old Quad (!) </s>
<s> or wait. </s>
<s> If you do not stress the RAM levels of an amateur machine, get the new iMac Intel which holds the same RAM level as the MacBook Pro and is slightly faster overall...insignificant but cheaper machine. </s>
<s> If you need the RAM then ...wait for 8 more months..the baby is in the oven... </s>
<s> I watched Steve Job's presentation again on my Mac early this morning from 2am until 3am utilizing Apple Quicktime Pro (Full image screen.) </s>
<s> I was very impressed with the graphics presentation. </s>
<s> (I happen to be a graphics person, not a tech.) </s>
<s> The amazing speed of the Intel processor and above all the ability to still be able to use all my present software with the MacIntel is amazing. </s>
<s> It was so late to view this video that I cannot remember the name of the software that would bridge say, Adobe Photoshop with the new processor. </s>
<s> Adobe Photoshop would be able to work on the new Mactels as I understand. </s>
<s> Peter, what is that software called?? </s>
<s> As far as purchasing a new MacIntel and concerns? </s>
<s> As I have posted before, really not even knowing about this new hybrid, Mac and Intel have been working on this project, their engineering departments have ironed it out I am sure. </s>
<s> Good guess on my part. </s>
<s> IT WORKS!!! </s>
<s> This is not a Windows Intel processor. </s>
<s> This is a brand new Mac Intel processor from scratch. </s>
<s> Designed from the ground up by the engineers from Mac and Intel. </s>
<s> Things that I also like is all the great new software that has been designed for the beginner as well as the pro. </s>
<s> Seemless professionalism on a presentation. </s>
<s> The list goes on. </s>
<s> More to come from Microsoft Office suite and a host of others that are impressed. </s>
<s> This will be the single most important step for Mac ever in its history. </s>
<s> I am excited about the future of the Mac. </s>
<s> I am a Mac user and probably can afford to send a Mac to my son, who is a PC user presently in Turkey. </s>
<s> Most likely would get it down pat in less than a week. </s>
<s> My son speaks seven languages fluently, and presently working toward learning his eighth language. </s>
<s> Mac? </s>
<s> Piece of cake! </s>
<s> What say you?? </s>
<s> What about PC users? </s>
<s> Wait, or JUMP ON NOW! </s>
<s> Thanks, -Kevin </s>
<s> ''Peter, what is that software called??'' </s>
<s> It's called Rosetta. </s>
<s> The new Intel processor was designed from the ground up by Intel at their plant in Israel. </s>
<s> Apple may have had a hand in the latter stages though. </s>
<s> This Duo Core processor will ship in the majority of Windows laptops starting in February. </s>
<s> Dell has that as a shipping date for their Intel Duo Core processor laptops. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Kevin, you seem to have been quite taken by Mr. Jobs' sales pitch. </s>
<s> I'm a lifelong Mac user and plan to buy again, but trusting that ''Mac and Intel have been working on this project, their engineering departments have ironed it out I am sure'' and that there won't be any bugs in the new Intel versions is ''buying a cat in a sack'' as the Danish say. </s>
<s> (Perhaps your son speaks Danish) Personally, I'm in a tough spot - my current computer, a G3 Powerbook running 9.2, is on its last breaths, and I doubt I can hold out for two years while Apple introduces and then gets the bugs out of the new Intel versions. </s>
<s> It'll also take software awhile to catch up - ie, what we can buy today won't work at its optimum level on Intel. </s>
<s> I'm tempted to just buy a G5 I can use now and for the next 2 or 3 years, but that means that by 2008 I could be in the same position I am now - with last-generation machine that doesn't work with the lastest software. </s>
<s> I have a baby daughter who will be needing educational software within 3 or 4 years, so that's a concern. </s>
<s> What's more, I live in Denmark, where in addition to high income taxes we pay 20% sales tax - so buying a new Mac on a regular basis becomes an even more expensive option. </s>
<s> It's a real pickle - usability now or later? </s>
<s> Intel based Macs were delivered to developers about a year ago. </s>
<s> I have the fortunate envy of talking to such a developer and the words have been nothing but glowing. </s>
<s> I'm sure you'll read some pundits write to stick with the PowerPC chip, but take a trip back in time when Apple moved from 68K to PowerPC and ... the pundits wrote to stick with the 68K CPU &quot;while the bugs are worked out.&quot; History does repeat itself so ask yourself if you had picked up the 68K Mac, what position would you be in? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> When I posted the original question I wondered if I would get any replies. </s>
<s> Thank you for sharing...I'm reading and thinking...haven't made any decisions yet, but I am appreciating all the thoughts. </s>
<s> I'm beginning to wonder if the suggestion of a lap top with a 20 inch screen would be an option until the intel processor gets to the level of the G5??? </s>
<s> I really liked the idea of having a computer with me in the field to download my images, etc. </s>
<s> Please continue discussion...I am learning...thanks again, Joanne. </s>
<s> The Intel that replaced the G5 processor in the iMac is supposed to be at least twice as fast. </s>
<s> I know the intel processor is in the new iMac, but I was originally looking at buying the G5 tower and separate 20inch monitor...and I understand that the intel processor isn't in the tower yet, right? </s>
<s> By going to the tower I was looking for greater speed, more memory, and more upgrade potential and plug-ins that would cover my needs now and in the future. </s>
<s> I'll go and read the specs on the new iMac, and the new lap tops and see what amount of memory is possible....now that they have the intel processor...perhaps the speed is there. </s>
<s> If there is a graphic artist...or.... out there that could help direct my thinking. </s>
<s> Computers and software are changing so rapidly it is hard to get on top of all the factors you need to know to move ahead. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone. </s>
<s> As a semi-professional photographer and way above average computer user myself, the PowerPC G5 is a waaaay better chip from a technical standpoint than even the Intel Duo at its fastest clock speed. </s>
<s> For one, these are 64-bit chips and with the front-side buses they support and addressable memory makes them second-to-none for CPU intensive tasks. </s>
<s> Also, not so much the bugs to be concerned about with the new MacIntels, but the fact that software runs on emulation currently via Rosetta, and emulation is ALWAYS slower than native instructions. </s>
<s> In addition to which, bear in mind that some applications do not work under such settings -i.e., OSX with emulation on the Intel Duo. </s>
<s> Now for the notebook, well that is an option I suppose but the one I use is my 40 GB iPod Photo with the photo connector to download images if I use the full 2 GB on my CF card for my Nikon d70. </s>
<s> It is much cheaper to either invest in higher capacity meory cards for your camera or to go the Ipod way. </s>
<s> Wait for benchmarks and don't forget that such comments as &quot;the PowerPC G5 is a waaaay better chip from a technical standpoint&quot; rings loudly in my ears as I remember back when the users were told they would be better off with the latest 68040 Macs. </s>
<s> History is repeating itself here. </s>
<s> Don't listen to the pundits. </s>
<s> Forget such writings and wait for the benchmarks. </s>
<s> Become an agnostic over what chip is used. </s>
<s> Vote with an open mind. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The G5 has 64 bit registers and data paths, as opposed to the Intel chips which are 32-bit. </s>
<s> (this made me wonder why the switch to Intel and not AMD, an underdog like Apple itself). </s>
<s> In addition to which the FSBs are a good 25%+ faster than the Intel equivalents. </s>
<s> Plus, despite being slower from a clock-speed standpoint the G5 chips can no more FLOPS than the fastest desktop P4. </s>
<s> So I do agree, that we have to wait for the benchmarks, but I would be greatly surprised (and appalled that I would have to eat my words) if they can come anywhere near, much less surpass, the dual core G5 with native OSX versus the 32-bit Intel duo emulating OSX via Rosetta (but I shall keep my words soft just in case!) </s>
<s> Your 64-bit wish... Will soon be granted. </s>
<s> I know I really enjoy using my 64-bit laptops.. ------------------ Very odd statement you made. </s>
<s> You wrote &quot;the dual core G5 with native OSX versus the 32-bit Intel duo emulating OSX via Rosetta (but I shall keep my words soft just in case! </s>
<s> )&quot; I read passages like this at many places. </s>
<s> &quot; Mac OS X version 10.4.4 &quot;Tiger&quot; including Safari, Mail, iCal, iChat AV, Front Row and Photo Booth, running natively &quot; http://www.letsgodigital.org/en/news/articles/story_5935.html If we recall the transition from 68K to PPC, the same story (sub which CPU moniker) is being repeated today. </s>
<s> Do you remember those days? </s>
<s> You are right that native apps are going to shine. </s>
<s> Just like it just a few years ago. </s>
<s> The bus speeds and such are fun to discuss since RISC machines needed more bus speed since they had to do more instructions whereas a CISC did more with less fetches. </s>
<s> This is very fun stuff but let's wait for benchmarks since the lines of RISC/CISC are very blurry on current generation Intels. </s>
<s> Apple did this move &quot;right&quot; by releasing those 1,000 buck developer machines many moons ago. </s>
<s> The surprises are going to be few. </s>
<s> ------------------------------------- http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10853916/site/newsweek/page/2/ &quot;How is battery life with the MacBook? </s>
<s> About the samethis with a dual processor [chip]! </s>
<s> Each processor is as fast as a G5, and the battery life will be the same as [the previous PowerBooks] G4.&quot; &quot;Your heavy-duty professional machine is the PowerMac, and it hasnt gotten its Intel transplant yet. </s>
<s> Wont this kill sales in the meantime? </s>
<s> Yes and no. </s>
<s> If youre an individual thats probably true, but if youre a business, youre thinking, Ive got someone whos going to use this four hours a day with PhotoShop. </s>
<s> Photoshop might not be available [in native code] until the spring or summer, and I need Photoshop native. </s>
<s> So I better get one of those quad PowerMacs while theyre still around.&quot; </s>
<s> When you said &quot;until the intel processor gets to the level of the G5?? </s>
<s> ?&quot; it sounded like you thought they were inferior to the G5 processors. </s>
<s> The new iMacs have sure got me thinking about replacing MY &quot;old&quot; iMac 800. </s>
<s> Looks like they still sale for around $500 on eBay. </s>
<s> Not sure how long that'll last... </s>
<s> It works well, but it's a bit slow. </s>
<s> And make sure your iPod battery is fully charged if you're going to be transferring a lot of photos. </s>
<s> but I was under the impression that OS 10.4.4, and it's associated apps, were running native on the Intel Mac. </s>
<s> Seems like the RDF is spreading all over. </s>
