I have just bought an Inspiron E1505 with Intel PRO 3945 and Dell 350 Bluetooth Internal Wireless Cards.
I'm thinking about setting up network in my house.
So I 'm consider between a WGU624 with a WGT624.
I'm a newbie at this, so I need advice about seeting these things up.
Which device do you think have simplier setup.
If you have another recommendation, please go ahead.
I am seeking for help and advice.
Thanks!!
!
