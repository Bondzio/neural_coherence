<s> i've had a sony dru-530A for about 9 months now and i just updated the firmware to allow me to burn dvd-r's from 4x to 8x.... and so i bought some dvd-r's at 8x. </s>
<s> Now when the cd's burn, they burn with a visible line in the middle from the edge of the disk to the center. </s>
<s> The section that is closer to the disk's center, is much more prominant and looks like it has a much thicker burn. </s>
<s> The other section looks weak, almost as if it barely burned that section. </s>
<s> So then i went out and bought some other dvd's. </s>
<s> Same thing. </s>
<s> Now since i did the firmware update, (which im guessing is the problem) can i uninstall it? </s>
<s> Eric </s>
<s> Not that a retrograde would fix your problem but to do so would require the ROM file from the previous firmware version and the utility to write it. </s>
<s> It's not done by uninstalling like other software. </s>
