<s> ok i have two problems. </s>
<s> first id like to say never had to deal with making a network or setting up a wireless connection before, so im lost. </s>
<s> one: my cousin recently brought her notebook pc to my house, and i have a wireless router and all. </s>
<s> so she goes on her laptop and does that scan for signal thing. </s>
<s> about 5 of them showed up. </s>
<s> 2 of them were named KB43903496 or something like that. </s>
<s> then the others were actual names, like &quot;ada,&quot; &quot;linksys,&quot; and &quot;&quot;network&quot;. </s>
<s> I assume that the names were made by the owners. </s>
<s> i was wondering how i would know which of the is mine. </s>
<s> and how can i make it have a name too? </s>
<s> two: i tried setting up a network between my two desktop pc's. </s>
<s> i ran the network setup wizard on one pc, followed all the directions, and then it says &quot;now run the network setup on the other computers.&quot; so i do on my other computer. </s>
<s> then i restart both pc's like it says. </s>
<s> On one computer, when i go into &quot;My network places&quot; and click &quot;View workgroup computers,&quot; i get this error message: &quot;Mshome is not accessible. </s>
<s> you might not have permission to use this network resource. </s>
<s> contact the admin. </s>
<s> of this server to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available.&quot; On the other, it shows the computer, and my other computer. </s>
<s> and when i click the computer icon, it freezes. </s>
<s> what am i doing wrong? </s>
<s> Ok for the first one... </s>
<s> The major thing you need to find out is how to log in to your router. </s>
<s> The way it works is go to a computer that's connected physically to the router and open IE or Firefox, some browser. </s>
<s> In the address bar you're going to need to enter the IP address of your router. </s>
<s> You should be able to find it in your original documentation that came with it. </s>
<s> It will look something like 182.147.0.1 Type that in and you should get a username/password prompt which is set at the factory (and you should be able to locate as well) to something like User: admin Pass: Password. </s>
<s> This will take you into the router and it's configuration. </s>
<s> If you've been using it already for non-wireless...there's little you must change. </s>
<s> You should have a wireless settings section, make sure you have these set up: SSID: It has one (you said KB439...), so you can either just make a note of the name of yours or change it if you'd like to something different. </s>
<s> For now, I'd make sure you don't have WEP, WPA, or equivalent security with keys on..because that will just make it harder at first. </s>
<s> Make sure that you have &quot;Radio&quot; enabled if you have that, and that you enable &quot;SSID Broadcast.&quot; Now the laptop should be able to connect, given it is configured to access an open dynamic DNS type access point, with DHCP enabled. </s>
<s> As far as networking both PC's, don't go do the same thing to the other PC like the wizard recommended. </s>
<s> Just get one computer working on the router, then go mimic EVERY setting on the second computer. </s>
<s> As long as you make sure that each computer is using the same Workgroup name...be in MSHOME or something easy like WORKGROUP. </s>
<s> Also make sure that you've enabled sharing of whatever folders on each computer you wish to share. </s>
<s> If you can't find one of them on the &quot;view workgroup computers&quot; thing, try searching for it by it's name (Case Sensitive). </s>
<s> You can verify/change both the name and workgroup of a computer by right-clicking on My Computer for properties. </s>
<s> Then go to the Computer Name tab....hope this helps. </s>
