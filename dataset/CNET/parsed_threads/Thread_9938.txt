<s> I have a 500GB Seagate Barracuda IDE drive that is giving me serious issues. </s>
<s> The drive is probably 2/3 full of movies and music. </s>
<s> I had it attached to a PCI IDE Raid Card in my home computer (Vista) (no on board IDE). </s>
<s> The computer stopped fully booting until I removed the drive. </s>
<s> I have since put the drive in an external USB case, put it in 2 other systems (Win2000) and still cannot get the drive to be recognized externally or able to boot internally. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> BTW...I could not care less about the actual hard drive, I just want to get my data onto a working drive. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> I was able to boot to MHDD and scan the drive. </s>
<s> There a sectors that are &quot;data is uncorrectable&quot; and &quot;sector ID cannot be read or not as expected&quot; So I know the drive is bad, now I just need to be able to get whatever files I can off the drive... </s>
<s> But this looks like where SPINRITE might work. </s>
