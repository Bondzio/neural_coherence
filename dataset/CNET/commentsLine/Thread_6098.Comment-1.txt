i have a dell dimension 4600 and i wanted to overclock my p4 2.66ghz cpu just to get a little more use out of it before i eventually buy a new pc.
i was wondering, is it safe to use an overclocking utility to overclock my cpu if my bios doesn't let me overclock it?
specs: p4 2.66ghz dell a07 bios intel i865p motherboard radeon x1600 pro gpu 1.5gb ram
