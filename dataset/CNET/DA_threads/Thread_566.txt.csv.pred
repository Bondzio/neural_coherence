1.1.1	I recently bought a Verbatim eSATA & USB 2.0 1,5 TB external hardrive.The manual tells me to connect the drive to my pc when my pc is off.i connect it with the eSATA cable provided and i do everything right but when i turn on my pc it gets stuck for a while in the screen where it says about pressing DEL for setup etc and after that it tells me that it can not boot from the drive and tells me to restart the computer.But when i connect the drive through the usb connection everything works fine.I believe that when i connect the drive in the eSATA the motherboard ignores my main drive and thinks that the main drive is the external one i tried to get it to boot from the main drive of my pc by pressing F8 for boot device sellecting but it only shows me the cd drive as a boot device .

1.2.1	This issue is growing to be a real problem today .	St
1.2.2	Many machines are set to emulate IDE on the SATA to ease install of Windows XP or for other reasons .	St
1.2.3	Then your story happens and go ahead and complain but who knew that mattered ( the IDE emulation . )	St
1.2.4	Changing this in the BIOS can cause the OS not to boot so the fallout continues to cause havoc .	St
1.2.5	Try this .	St
1.2.6	Use other SATA connections and read more about BIOS SATA IDE EMULATION or AHCI on google .	St
1.2.7	Sorry I ca n't put a tutorial here every time this comes up .	St
