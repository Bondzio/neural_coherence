<s> Hi, I am planning on building a gaming PC with Core i7. </s>
<s> I have build my system back in the days on Pentium4 but never with current generation processors. </s>
<s> I have a basic idea but nervous with some aspects. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Does a core i7 (940 or 965 extreme) need an aftermarket giant cooler unless I overclock it? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Do I need to apply a thermal paste for these processors or can it be safe without it as well? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> to fill the microscopic gaps at the surfaces of the processor and the heat sink itself. </s>
<s> Some heat sinks come with a thermal pad that softens and flows when heat is first generated. </s>
<s> You don't add paste to these. </s>
<s> You either trust them to be adequate or remove them and apply your own thermal treatment. </s>
<s> especially if you're gaming. </s>
<s> And go for one that installs with something other than the standard Intel method ...sometimes they pop loose and you'll never know until your system starts overheating. </s>
<s> If you want to see the difference in HS Fan cooling ...including the Intel or AMD stock HS Fans...go to http:/www.Frostytech.com. </s>
<s> Last, if you go with an aftermarket cooler ...the question about thermal compound is mute. </s>
<s> Some come with pre-installed pads and others require you to apply thermal compound separately Let us know which direction you go. </s>

<s> I keep reading about liquid cooling. </s>
<s> is it necessary for me? </s>
<s> I have no intensions of overclocking or atleast not serious overclocking. </s>
<s> for that matter. </s>

<s> Can you guys help me which ones are the best AIR Cooled cases currently, again my config in mind is Core i7 940 or greater Dual or 3 way SLI GTX 285 I saw an Alienware cabinet and really liked it but it not sure how good it is. </s>
<s> Please let me know of something thats sexy and efficient for my setup </s>
