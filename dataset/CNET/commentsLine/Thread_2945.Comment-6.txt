my husband uses cccleaner, and mr. fussy is very pleased with it.
i like registry fix (which is not free, but worth the money)--it has a super simple interface, you can customize it, and i have never felt uncomfortable using it.
it tells you what it did, asks you if you want to save or repair, and that's it.
no scary stuff.
