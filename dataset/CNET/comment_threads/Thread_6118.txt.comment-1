Hi There could anybody help me Im a little confused by the laptop intel core 2 duo mobile processors.
The Advent 9517 laptop has a T5250 the add says its a 3.8Ghz cpu Then the Advent 5511 has a P7350 at 2Ghz Can anybody point me to a site that makes sense of these procesors Nos etc.
There must be a list somewhere that lists them in order of performance.
I have found a performance list for desktop CPU,s but not for mobile CPU,s Many Thanks Tony B.
