when i try to copy data to the top cd/dvd drive, it tells me to put a disc in the drive.
it's already there.
when i put a pre-recorded dvd in the drive, it tells me to put a disc in the drive.
it's already there.
when i put a pre-recorded dvd in the second drive, then try to open the drive from my computer, there is nothing there.
sometimes when i try to copy data to the bottom drive, it works and sometimes it doesn't.
i'm sorry, but that's all i know.
i've used similar fora for help that i thought was technical support.
i don't know the difference with people helping people with technical problems and technical support.
when you asked what happened and i told you what happened you said i wasn't telling the real story.
when i tried to embelish it in hopes i would say something that you needed to hear, you told me you weren't interested in my husband's golf trip.
i don't know what to say.
