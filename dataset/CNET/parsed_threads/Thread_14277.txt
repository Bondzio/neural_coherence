<s> Hi All, I searched thru the existing posts relating to wireless networking, but couldn't find a fix that matches my situation, so I thought I'd ask some of the intelligent people here! </s>
<s> I'll keep the post short to save you some reading: Vaio laptop (2002) Windows XP Netgear Wireless card Netgear MR814v2 Router (B only) Synopsis: This network b/t the router, card, and pc has worked fine for 4 years or so. </s>
<s> Recently, I started getting the dreaded &quot;404&quot; page. </s>
<s> The network connection icon in the tray says the card-to-router is connected, and excellent signal strength. </s>
<s> No matter what settings you choose, it will not connect. </s>
<s> I even went so far as to reload the system restore discs, hoping any wrong check boxes made would be restored to the connection I could make before- NOTHING. </s>
<s> Even after restoring the system, and wiping everything out, it still does the same thing! </s>
<s> Connection status shows it is fine, but will not load any web page. </s>
<s> Oh, the network does have WEP, and the key is being entered correctly and accepted on the PC. </s>
<s> Not sure if it matters, but the SSID is broadcasted. </s>
<s> P.S.- I have 2 other laptops in the house (both newer, with internal wireless), and both connect to that &quot;B&quot; router just fine, and load web pages pretty fast. </s>
<s> Any pointers anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated!!! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> that hardware does break down. </s>
<s> I might try another network card first. </s>
<s> And does this Vaio laptop (2002) connect at free wifi hotspots? </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply! </s>
<s> Yes, when wired driectly to the router, it works fine. </s>
<s> I don't take this laptop out, so I'm not sure if it will pick up other networks. </s>
<s> It doesn't find any of my nieghbor's networks. </s>
<s> If out of warranty you'll want to try some PC CARD since repairs costs so much. </s>
<s> Something new since the last post- I clicked on repair the connection, and after a LONG time of it trying, I get an error message saying: &quot;The following steps of the repair operation failed: Renewing the IP address. </s>
<s> Please contact your network administrator or ISP&quot;. </s>
<s> Could this be the culprit? </s>
<s> I just tried a Linksys card I have and still nothing. </s>
<s> But even if the hardware (card, card slot on PC) has failed, wouldn't it give me a &quot;no connection&quot; icon in the tray? </s>
<s> I reloaded the Netgear card software, rebooted, and reinserted the card while it was rebooting and same thing. </s>
<s> It recognizes my network (and another in the neighborhood) and i can connect to mine using the network key. </s>
<s> It connects and says the connection status is excellent, but just will not load a web page. </s>
<s> I'm alomst certain there's something in the settings preventing it from connecting. </s>
<s> The Netgear software is controlling the connection and not Windows, so I know that setting is not a factor. </s>
<s> Thanks again, R.! </s>
<s> That's a message I would expect if there is a problem with the card, driver or even if you got the password wrong. </s>
<s> A trip to a free wifi hotspot would be my next test. </s>
