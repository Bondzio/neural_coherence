I'm just offering up one of my old computers as a loaner to shorten the time I'm without a work Pc.
I work for a non-profit and it could be over a month before I see parts to repair the old computer at work.
We have several unused legal Windows XP PRO liscences (Microsoft is very generous to non-profits.)
-- this is not the issue.
(Although it is my understanding the XP PRO is supposed to allow you to make 4 major hardware changes before it asks you to re-activate.)
I've done this before -- I'm just concerned about data loss.
I'm starting to think it may be better to piggy-back this drive on the drive that was orginally in the AMD computer.
(which I really don't want to do...) And I agree, taking a company harddrive for home use would go over like a lead ballon -- but that's not what I'm doing here.
Thanks for the input.
