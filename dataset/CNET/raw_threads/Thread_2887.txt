I need network connectivity and duplex built-in. I have done a fair bit of research and come down to these three models: 1. Brother 4050cdn 2. Samsung CLP-610nd 3. Oki C5650dn Brother and Samsung get excellent reviews, while I can't seem to find anything on the Oki. Brother is getting a little old now, which makes me think it is soon to be replaced. I would love to replace it with an MFC w. fax as I still have an ink-jet fax, but can't seem to find one that does all this for less than $700 AUD. Any advice, experience or suggestions would be great! Thanks.

If you like find out which of the toner replacements will cost to get yet another angle on cost operation. As for FAX ability, if you really want it, then I'm sure they're available but you will need to pony up more $. I don't like having all in one basket printers as if they glitch, you then have multiple issues to deal with. As for your ptr. list, I would go with the Oki model. Oki, simply has a rock solid operation, though you may not find easy of fixes should they appear. But, they're that good, regardless. Also, consider whatever prtr. you pick that these aren't zillion paper output presses, so use it as an office ptr. not a printing press to reduce problems. tada -----Willy
