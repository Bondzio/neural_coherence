<s> I am running windows XP on my computer and just installed a 200GB hard drive however, after I format the drive I only get 127 GB out of it, anyone can give me any Idea on how to get all 200GB out of this drive? </s>
<s> Please e-mail me at winperry@hotmail.com. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> XP only gets you 127GB support. </s>
<s> SP1 patches it so you can do more, but with the danger that if you make an over 127GB partition, the data will go missing until you apply SP1. </s>
<s> But you can't apply SP1 since the OS is not installed. </s>
<s> To get all around this issue, look up AUTOSTREAMER and make a proper XP CD with SP2 or order a XP SP2 CD from Microsoft. </s>

<s> Thank you much Bob, I will give it a try. </s>

<s> sometimes you need to make a change in the bios settings, so that that xp will recognise the bigger hard drive. </s>
<s> make a 100gb main, then do all the installs, then go back and make the secondary partition 100gb for storage? </s>
<s> I don't use more than 10gb or 20gb for main as cleanup, defrag and all goes faster, and I can redo the main partition without losing all I have stored in the other ones. </s>
<s> I have the same problem with a 160 gig drive. </s>
<s> I only get 128 gigs. </s>
<s> If I find anything I will let you know. </s>
