<s> what can i get to clean the fingerprints off my computer screen? </s>
<s> my daughter always touches it. </s>
<s> Is it coated? </s>
<s> Do you have any instructions that came with the monitor that might address this? </s>
<s> If so, follow those. </s>
<s> Most CRTs are glass or coated glass. </s>
<s> Regular glass cleaners using a soft cloth without rubbing will usually work fine. </s>
<s> Some camera lens cleaners might also be good to take away small fingerprints. </s>
<s> Again...soft cloth such as for use on glasses or lenses should be ok. Avoid strong solvents, of course, and stick with mild surfactants where grease and oil are a problem. </s>
<s> Maybe some coaching for your daughter might help if she's old enough to understand. </s>
<s> this is a crt model. </s>
<s> it looks like glass to me. </s>
<s> Actually, It doesn't metter what kind of screen. </s>
<s> There are so many resources of cleaning. </s>
<s> But I prefer humid serviettes it suits for any screens. </s>
<s> Go to computer shop, you could find it everywhere. </s>

<s> A gentle application of glass cleaner to the CRT 2. </s>

<s> :) </s>
<s> Use just about any &quot;glass cleaner&quot; to wipe a glassed monitor. </s>
<s> Best, to apply to cloth or rag instead of directly on monitor surface, then wipe. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, if you monitor is really a LCD type, don't do this, buy the required special wipes or cleaner for that purpose. </s>
