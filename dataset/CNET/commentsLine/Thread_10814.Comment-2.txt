my friends daughter has the hp pavilion 1657c and really likes it.
she does what you are wanting to do plus she is a gamer.the only thing different is she installed a graphics card and upgraded to vista home premium which runs great.
as for the re-furb thing, i have never bought one that way and don't know anyone who has.
what kind of warrenty are they giving?
if fry's stands behind it, that is an excellent price for that computer.
