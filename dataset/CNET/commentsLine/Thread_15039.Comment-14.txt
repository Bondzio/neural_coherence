with the price of externals today i cant imagine your saving any money by doing what you are doing especially since you have to ask in a forum about existing viruses you say you have already and assuming they do have a virus and just not defective in general .
you can buy thumbdrives bigger than an old hard drive or get cloud.
if you think a cloud is made out of water vapor then i would suggest using a ps3 for your computing needs.
