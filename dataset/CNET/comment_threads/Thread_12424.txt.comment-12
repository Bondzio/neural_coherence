I suspect your friend is jealous .
Assume you have Dell paperwork that shows it shipped a 630 processor.
I did a research on X86 some time ago, and just logged it out of my mind.
It concerns the industry standard on the design of a processor system and its compatibility.
For detailed info on your computer, I would suggest downloading the free small program from Belarc and printing out a copy http://www.belarc.com/Download.html Intel announced in February (this year) that they are now shipping four new processors in the Intel Pent 4 Processor 6xx sequence that support the 64-bit tech (EM64T).
Quote from Intel: &quot; Intel plans to ship EM64T on versions of every newly introduced Intel desktop processor including the company's Intel Celeron D processor lines later this year.
The new processors will support the upcoming Microsoft* Windows XP Professional x64 Edition operating system and will enable users to experience the benefits of 64-bit computing.&quot; Intel indicates for a Pent4 630 you have: 3.0GHz clock speed 800MHz Front Side Bus (FSB) 2MB of L2 cache 90nm LGA 775 Architechure So, this should be your processor: http://processorfinder.intel.com/scripts/details.asp?sSpec=SL7Z9&ProcFam=483&PkgType=ALL&SysBusSpd=ALL&CorSpd=ALL Note it includes the 64-bit (EM64T)
