Hello, I am having some problems with my drivers on my PC, they keep giving me a blue screen of death so I have decided to uninstall them, however I was looking at the uninstall guide and I did not understand step 7 Here the link to the uninstall guide. http://www.voyager.bt.com/selfhelp/s...nstall_win.htm What does it mean by explore the 105 CD? do I have to insert a CD or something at this point or does this screenshot automatically appear? Also the last step requires me to reboot my pc, if I click reboot would I loose all my data that is saved on my PC? what happens when I reboot, will the PC start again as normal? or do I have to insert a CD or something? Any help would be appreciated, Thank you

Can you post a working link? - Why do you think it's those drivers that give the blue screen? - What device are we talking about? - The usual way to uninstall drivers is to delete the device from Device Manager. But I think it's more that drivers here. What I think: - &quot;exploring the cd&quot; means &quot;put in the cd and open it in My Computer or Windows Explorer&quot;. I can't say more at the moment because the link doesn't work - &quot;rebooting&quot; is no more than shutdown and start again (without the CD in the drive). You won't lose any more data than you loose every night/morning when you do the same. So you won't lose anything that you did save. Kees -

Now, insert the CD and in My Computer browse to it. Once you've done that step 7 instructs you to doubleclick Remid. Hope this helps. Kees

So the drivers must be corrupt right? p.s sorry about my lack on technical language! I dont know much about computers. And are you sure I wont loose any of my work? Cause I got a lot of my college work on there, and if I loose it I might just die!

But I hope you realize that your ADSL (Internet connection) won't work anymore after you uninstall that driver. So I hope you've got some other way to get to the Internet. And there's no need to send the report to Microsoft if it's caused by BT software. Did you already contact their helpdesk? If it's their program, they should now what to do about it. No need to make an excuse for your language. It's perfectly understandable. I'm sure you won't lose any of your work. Once you've uninstalled your driver, however, go our Computer Newbies forum and ask them for advice on BACKUP. That's making a copy of your precious work on some other device (like a CD or DVD or USB-stick or external hard disk) so you won't lose it your computer breaks down or gets a serious virus or you delete the original just by accident. Tell them how much data you have (maybe pictures and music also, or do you use this machine for schoolwork only?). Better be safe than sorry, isn't it? Kees

If that doesn't work, I'm sure there is a &quot;cancel&quot; button somewhere to click on before anything serious happens. Then, after canceling, you can do your step 7. Kees

I know I should change from using BT voyager 105 USB ADSL modem, as it is quite outdated. What do you recommend I do?
14858	9	301464	2813246	2813243	Kees Bakker	7/17/08 5:40 AM	1.2162732E12	Re: uninstalling	If you don't have the CD, how could you reinstall the drivers then? Moreover, it isn't sure it would fix the problem. If it would, it would do so without uninstalling also, most of the time. Just reinstall the same drivers from the same CD as you did when you got the modem. What I should do: contact your ISP that gave you the modem. They might have a newer one, all ready to install, coming with a CD, or recommend you one that then mention the setup instructions of on their help pages. Or they might know what to do about the current error. Kees

And just one more question =) If I just left things as they were would that damage my computer? Cause all I do is just restart my PC every time I get the blue screen error. It happens every few week or so
