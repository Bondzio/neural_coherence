&quot;just use a nice 80 conductor ide cable, set both drives to cable select and plug the drive pair into a primary ide channel.&quot; does this &quot;generally&quot; work?
or does it depend on the mobo?
i have an intel d845bg mobo, and hdd is set as master.
if i were to add another hdd, could i set them up either way, master/slave, or cable select?
and is there any advantage of one setup over the other.
thanks.
