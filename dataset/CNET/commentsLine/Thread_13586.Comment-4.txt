floppies are notoriously unreliable.
certainly not suited for long-term storage.
but a good (albeit somewhat oldfashioned, slow and low capacity) way to transfer files between machines that don't have internet or usb.
all you can try: read the diskette on your laptop and see if that recognizes it.
that's not impossible, although unlikely.
then transfer the data using mail or usb-stick.
this is the umpteenth (if not more) proof that having data on one place only is an invitation to the gods of it to destroy it and lose it.
