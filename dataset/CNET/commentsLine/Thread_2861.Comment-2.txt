i bought a d-link pci (internal) because i had the room inside the computer and i don't like having things permanantly hanging off the sides of the case.
i also still have all my usb ports free.
i followed the directions exactly (install drivers from cd before inserting card) and it has worked flawlessly ever since.
$30 after rebate at officemax, and they did send me my check.
good luck, eric
