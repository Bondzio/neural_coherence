I have been running it for only a week or two, so far and last night I happened to notice that the CPU was touching around 50 degrees C. I remember reading in the manual that it took a good number of processing hours for the heatsink and thermal compound to reach maximum efficiency, but I have to say, I am still a little nervous about letting my CPU get above 50C. Now, keep in mind that I am not an overclocker, nor do I wish to be. My new CPU is an AMD Athlon 64 X2, 5200+ and Socket AM2. I am looking for plausible suggestion for cooling within an already well-ventilated case. I use a Lian-Li PC-60USB B2, with two front panel fans, one back panel fan and a top panel exhaust fan. The proprietary fans for the CPU and the videocard are installed. Any helpful replies will be appreciated. Thanks, Eric

When I was watching it on the EasyTuner app last night, I saw that it was hovering right around 48 - 50 C. This was after the machine had been up and running for a while. I had been playing games and running applications for probably a few hours. I guess it is still within it's safety zone. If anyone has a better suggestion for an app to measure stats, I'd be grateful.

Tempature flucuations are more dangerous than some warmer than normal temp. reading.. I would go with a steady as she goes tempature reading.. and not create a PC-environment that caused cold air to suddenly hit the machine surfaces.. I have had had High Heat Flags run on my Machine and nothing ever happened..this was with a Celeron D[331]2.66GHz CPU..I replaced that CPU w/P4[531]3.0GHz..and of course things run exactly so.. .. Video Rendering is CPU intensive..w/P4 I have no issues.
