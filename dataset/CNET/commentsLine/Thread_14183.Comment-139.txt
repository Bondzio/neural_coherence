my first computer was a kaypro pc with two floppy drives.
this was an &quot;ibm-compatible&quot; rather than a clone because of its proprietary backplane architecture.
i later added a seagate 30 mb hard drive and a modem.
one of the floppies failed; it cost $150 to replace it!
eventually i also had to replace the crappy btc keyboard with an ibm xt model.
my wife took over the computer when i got a 486 in 1993. she continued to use it until mid-1999, when she finally got the idea that it would have a problem with the year 2000 issue.
