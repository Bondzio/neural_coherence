1.
Run Scandisk-Thorough and see how many bad sectors are actually there.
2.
Go to Hdd's Mfg website and download an Hdd floppy that can check for same and might allow zero-fill.
But that wipes the whole Hdd and you'd have to reinstall.
As with SpinRite, I've recovered many bad sectors and more of Hdd that way, as the Hdd wasn't failing.
The bad sectors got made by data hard errors and sudden power-off.
