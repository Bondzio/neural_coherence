<s> My friend told me that if you turn off windows explorer before starting up a game, you can get the game running much better and faster. </s>
<s> Is that true? </s>
<s> not really, if you're using XP. </s>
<s> google a program called &quot;smartclose&quot;: it lets you shut down everything that can be shut down and still run windows environment, which you need for games (i play WoW, and had all kinds of lag before finding this program. </s>
<s> was going into task manager and shutting things down one at a time. </s>
<s> pain in the butt.) </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> depending your OS, it'll either BSOD or try to restart explorer explorer is the basis for Windows to operate with WinXP it tries to restart it, and sometimes you'd have to restart it for it (task manager -&gt; new task -&gt; explorer.exe) don't turn it off at all </s>
