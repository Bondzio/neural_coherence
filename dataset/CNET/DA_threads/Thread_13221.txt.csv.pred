1.1.1	I just wonder what in the world make these RAM so extremely expensive ?	Ques
1.1.2	I also wonder if they are faster than the equivalent PC3200 DDR400 modules .	St
1.2.1	RAM costs money because it takes some thousands of people to design the chips , the machines that make the chips , the machines that make the printed circuit boards , people who put it together and so on .	St
1.2.2	If you step back every year for many years , today 's memory is cheaper per byte than before .	St
1.2.3	You will pay a premium for latest and fastest .	St
1.2.4	Which is true for cars as well .	St
1.2.5	In this case , the memory looks to be something that is SPECIAL .	St
1.2.6	I see ECC and a specific make/model machine .	St
1.2.7	It 's possible that this machine ca n't take a generic module and that a special reserve of sticks has been set aside .	St
1.2.8	Since memory modules for such may have been made years ago , the price of the memory does n't follow today 's prices but gets stuck at the 2 year ago price PLUS inventory carrying charges .	St
1.2.9	Older machine memory often zooms up in price ( or at least it feels it . )	St
1.2.10	My example is memory for my old dual Pentium Pro Overdrive machine .	St
1.2.11	The memory costs more than your example per byte today .	St
1.2.12	Bob Bob	St
1.3.1	Just writing that its nice to see you up and around the boards .	St
1.3.2	I hope you did n't mind too much my play on words about the color to the CDRs .	St
1.3.3	Even I got caught by that one only to learn first-hand the new issue .	St
1.3.4	Cheers and have fun , Bob PS .	St
1.3.5	Yes , we hope the boards get Search , Marking and Pinning .	St
1.4.1	You would be better off replacing the systems with modern systems rather than upgrading the memory .	St
1.4.2	THe newer systems out today are 3 times the speed of your existing systems .	St
1.4.3	At Quarter end Dell was selling 2.6Ghz systems with 512meg of memory for $ 654 , including Office and Windows XP Pro .	St
1.4.4	That would be a much better choice than upgrading your old hardware with way overpriced memory .	St
1.4.5	I have my clients avoid the Optiplex or Precision Dell systems because they are overpriced .	St
1.4.6	The only reason to buy them is if you need dual processors or a SCSI Raid array .	St
1.4.7	Some people do n't notice that the Dimension are much lower priced and just as fast , only difference is that if you buy 100 of them the Optiplex and Precision would have identical brand hard drives and CD drives .	St
1.5.1	`	St
1.6.1	Well , I do n't have one of these ...	St
1.6.2	It was a friend of mine who bought his 3 years ago ( Dell Precision Workstation 220 with dual 933 MHz processors ) .	St
1.6.3	He now upgraded his RAM and states that his RAM is faster than those used by computers with PC3200 DDR400 since the RAM he just got is running at 800Mhz and the DDR at 400 if I 'm not too wrong ...	St
1.6.4	I do n't know .	St
1.6.5	You may have an explanation for me .	St
1.6.6	Thanks in advance !	St
