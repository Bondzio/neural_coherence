1.1.1	I have an HP psc 2110 printer that I can only print from if I install both a black and a color cartridge .	St
1.1.2	The problem is , I do n't do a lot of printing , mostly only documents and buying and installing a colored cartridge is a waste of money because it ends up drying out in the printer .	St
1.1.3	I recently bought 2 new black cartridges and installed only 1 black cartridge ... NO COLORED CARTRIDGE .	St
1.1.4	It worked fine with just the black ink cartridge installed until I turned it off and unplugged it .	St
1.1.5	After I replugged it in it wo n't print , so I contacted HP for help .	St
1.1.6	Unfortunately , HP was no help , after over an hour of live chatting with them they informed me that I must install a color cartridge along with the black cartridge in oder for the printer to work when using the Vista OS .	St
1.1.7	It appears that their built in software only supports having both cartridges .	St
1.1.8	Also , they are working on an updated fully functional software for this printer that will be released as soon as possible , meanwhile my options are to buy the color cartridge which is too expensive to buy , just to waste or they offered me an upgraded printer for $ 134.99 .	St
1.1.9	Ok now , my questions are ... Since it worked with only a black cartridge installed while using Vista before , should n't it work now ?	Ques
1.1.10	Does anyone know of a way to get around buying a new printer or colored ink cartridge ?	Ques
1.1.11	Does the printer just need to see a cartridge in the colored cartridge slot ?	Ques
1.1.12	Will the black cartridge ( I already ) work in the colored slot ?	Ques
1.1.13	Please help if you can , I really ca n't afford either option provided by Hp , who by the way has lost favor with me and I will never purchase from them again ... lkeyes01	St
1.2.1	Go into the printer software , find printers in control panel click on icon .	St
1.2.2	There should be an HP printer assistant installed , in the assistant there should be options .	St
1.2.3	You can set it to print black only from there .	St
1.2.4	Generally for printers to function you need to have ALL cartridges installed , running just one cartridge in a two cartridge system confuses everything and you may wind up re installing the software to make it function properly .	St
1.2.5	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	You have to have the all carts installed as its seen as an error otherwise .	St
1.3.2	That 's just the way it is .	St
1.3.3	Now , if thew optional setting provide for a & quot ; monochrome & quot ; usage , set it and forget about , thus only black output .	St
1.3.4	Provided it so optional , otherwise , you 're stuck .	St
1.3.5	If truly all you ever do is print black , then look into a B & W laser printer as that will overall be cheaper to run and be very good on output speed and quality .	St
1.3.6	If you brought this ptr .	St
1.3.7	because it was cheap or on sale , then consider you made a bad decision and doing the above will correct for it .	St
1.3.8	However , many newer ink cart ptrs .	St
1.3.9	do n't provide for black only output unless they are so optioned .	St
1.3.10	Check the support website for details on any possible setting that may help for final quest .	St
1.3.11	FYI , I do n't know of any gimmick that defeats the color output .	St
1.3.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	I agree with Willy , if you do ONLY black printing , get a cheap mono Laser printer , Brother makes several for 100.00 or less and they work quite well .	St
