5397	1	260381	2562922	2562864	ramarc	8/14/07 3:51 PM	1.18710666E12	you have very limited processor upgrade options	the gateway 503gr uses the intel 915 chipset and you can only upgrade to another pentium 4 500 series processor (no pentium d, no core2duo). you *may* be able to use a p4 600 series cpu but you should contact gateway since intel's 915 mobos only support 500 series and lower p4s: http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d915glvg/sb/CS-026956.htm since you already have a 3ghz p4, only a 3.4ghz chip could be considered an upgrade. but, the p4 500 series was superseded by the 600 series 2 years ago, and i can't find any retail 500 series cpus. you might take a look at ebay and see what's avaiable.

That way, you get the same class cpu and then decide the best cpu, the system will handle. Gateway isn't that forthcoming in such details, but likely you can install a 3.4mhz cpu. It important to find the &quot;multiplier value&quot; or FSB as this will allow to what speed cpu you can accept as a drop-in. If the value is already what your current cpu is installed, you may not be able to upgrade higher as you're locked-in to what the mtrbd. supports. I saw no cpu upgrade from Gateway, but you can ask if such is possible, email them and hope for a response. tada -----Willy

I think i may try my hand at building a whole new 1. my 2 pc's are kinda old (hp1040n) and the gateway 503gr and i figure ill be needing a new 1 in the coming years to play games w/direct-x 10 and whatnot.
