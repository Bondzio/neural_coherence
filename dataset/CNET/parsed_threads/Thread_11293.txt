<s> The My Passport drive I have has been working just fine until today. </s>
<s> I left it in my computer when it went to sleep and now all the root directories are there, but there is nothing inside them (it tells me &quot;Folder is Empty&quot; when I hover the mouse over a folder). </s>
<s> Yet, the drive has the same amount of free space it did before this happened. </s>
<s> I don't know what to do. </s>
<s> I'm afraid that I've lost everything. </s>
<s> I'm also afraid that I haven't lost everything, but if I remove the drive, it'll lose everything. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> I figured it out. </s>
<s> I just needed to reboot my computer. </s>
<s> I'm not sure how to delete my post or I would. </s>
