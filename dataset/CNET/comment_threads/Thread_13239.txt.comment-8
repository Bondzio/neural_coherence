Am going to look at a PC @ Walmart ... wife works there, we get a 10 percent discount ... ZT Systems box, i7-2600 3.4 ghz processor, comes stock with 16 gigs of RAM, 2 TB HD (although it's 5400 rpm green instead of 7,200, don't really care though) and BluRay/DVD/CD writer, comes bundled with Hannspree monitor, $950 including extended warranty.
May be best balance between going cheapo and overspending.
Have checked ZT Systems out, seeing pretty much universal positive reviews as no-frills but solid product which is right up my alley.
Thanks for input.
