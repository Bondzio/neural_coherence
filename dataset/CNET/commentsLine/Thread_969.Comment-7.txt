xigmatek has some excellent units that are worth looking at....esp compared to the coolermaster unit you've identified.
re psu...much better choice !
re sandy bridge... depends on when you plan to build.
you could get the cpu now but there's no mbs to put them in at the moment...notwithstanding the first mbs to hit the shelves may be repaired or patched mbs vice new builds with the updated chips.
re ...thermal grease....not a problem....just order some arctic silver from newegg...always good to extra grease ...just in case you need to reinstall it.
re ssds ... can't help you there.
no firsthand experience with them yet.
