The cursor was locking, and after some time the same happened with my keyboard. So I decided to take my PC to a technician and he replaced my USB mouse with a serial mouse since the problem seemed to be with the USB ports. Now my problem with this mouse is that it frequently acts very strangely in that right-click menus open suddenly without me having touched the mouse. Also sometimes the cursor changes its position on the monitor, yet the mouse is not being moved. Can anyone help me with this problem please? Thanks.

Yeah I have a USB/PS2 port, but I had to change that mouse since the ports seem to be faulty. The PS2 mouse was not working. Therefore my technician advised me to work with a serial mouse, which I am doing, but with this little problem.

There is no correlation between USB and PS/2, so if both broke it is not surprising that the Serial mouse doesn't work either. Are you having any other problems with this system? How old is it, what hardware are we talking about here, is this a REAL old system?
