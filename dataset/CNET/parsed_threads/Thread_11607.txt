<s> I am going to purchase a new computer after 8 years of using an HP8275. </s>
<s> This computer has been good to me and is still going strong. </s>
<s> For some reason after installing software (either EZ firwall or HP photosmart) I now recieve a not DRIVERIF.DLL was not found. </s>
<s> No idea how it happened or what to do. </s>
<s> New computer option. </s>
<s> I have had a great experience with HP but I am on a tight budget. </s>
<s> System: HP A810e $808 after taxes AMD Seprom 512 MB 160 GB Dual Drives (DVD) Flat Panel Is the 810N better? </s>
<s> System 2: Dell Dimension 3000 $730 after tax Pentium 4 512 MB 80 GB Dual Drive (CD only) Flat Panel memory key I don't want to spend over $700 what is the best system for the best price? </s>
<s> Is e-machine or any other I am not familiar with reliable? </s>
<s> Primary use: photos, email, word processing, high-speed cable modem, everyday use. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help:) </s>
<s> please, for the love of god, don't ge ta sempron. </s>
<s> Check out the emachines on Best Buy. </s>
<s> I have had one for a couple years and it works great </s>
<s> I made a decision many years ago to use only Intel processors whenever possibel, and I have never been unhappy with that decision. </s>
<s> On the few times I have used AMD I have had issues. </s>
<s> Because i do not pay attention any more to AMD I am not absolutely sure about the next few iseas that may sway your decision, but they are things to think about. </s>
<s> Intels P4 has a little doobie called hyperthreading. </s>
<s> In esssence a CPU that can do more than one thing at time. </s>
<s> True multitasking, not to be confused with pre- emptive multitasking where it only seems you are doing more than one thing ata time. </s>
<s> I noticed from the specs that the P4 had a half the storage space, and no dvd writer. </s>
<s> Good choice of brand names, and i want to send a nice big &quot;wHaT ArE U Thinking! </s>
<s> !&quot; to the person that reccomended an E-machine at worst buy. </s>
<s> Retail is the last place you should ever buy a PC. </s>
<s> E-machines are some of the wost pc's I have ever had the displeasure to have to deal with. </s>
<s> Fine if you are going to surf the net and write papers, but that is about it. </s>
<s> I LOVE HP and Dell products, but thier optical drive prices are high. </s>
<s> A nice double sided 16X dvd writer can be had for abot 60 dollars. </s>
<s> This upgrade can be done any time and fast and painless. </s>
<s> Hard drives are equally easy to add if you want more storage space. </s>
<s> I would definately reccomend checking out some online retailers such as Tigerdirect, Newegg, and Geeks to see what they have in the P4 family. </s>
<s> Geeks especially has a fluctuating stock from day to day and occasionally has just killer deals on systems. </s>
<s> Ultimately i have to say go with the P4. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> Is the Athlon 64 and sampron the same? </s>
<s> If not is the Athlon 64 a good processor? </s>
<s> They are not the same though. </s>
<s> Athlon 64 is a higher end processor and you wont find one in a $800 machine. </s>
<s> The Sempron can be thought of like the Celeron in the Intel line. </s>
<s> If you were working fine with your 8 year old machine and the driver issue is the only nag, any moden budget machine will work better than your old one. </s>
<s> Visit www.gotapex.com they list the current best Dell offers. </s>
<s> You can get a better box for your $700-800 than you had listed. </s>
<s> After reading your messages, I think I finally decided on the HP A810n which has an AMD 64, 512mb, 160gb and all the other basics . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> for $630. </s>
<s> Will this be a reliable system? </s>
<s> Good selection IMO. </s>
<s> Is this the HP A810n at Circuit City for $630 after rebates without a monitor/printer: http://www.circuitcity.com/ccd/productDetail.do?oid=114638&WT.mc_n=57&WT.mc_t=U Click on the packgage deal and for $650 at Circuit City you get the same thing but with a monitor and printer: http://www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/114638/bundleId/1077/rpem/ccd/bundleDetail.do Keep in mind that a Flat-Screen CRT monitor is not a 3-4 inch thick Flat-Screen(Panel) LCD monitor (like the photo's show). </s>
<s> One additional good thing about the HP A810n is that it has an AGP slot so that you can later upgrade the Integrated graphics to something better for video editing and better gaming. </s>
