<s> Hey guys any help would be awesome. </s>
<s> My Maxtor Basics 500GB external HDD powers up (Solid power light comes on) and makes a breif &quot;whirr&quot; but fails to start spinning properly. </s>
<s> Drive doesn't show up in My Computer. </s>
<s> The &quot;whirr&quot; continues to start and stop but nothing further happens. </s>
<s> Could this be an enclosure problem or is my drive screwed? </s>
<s> It hasn't been dropped or anything and i've only had it about 2 months. </s>
<s> Any idea what options i have? </s>
<s> It will be under warranty but is Maxtor likely to repair and save my data or just replace? </s>
<s> Any help much appreciated! </s>

<s> They take in your old and hand you another unit. </s>
<s> If you want your files (which begs the question about where the backup copies are) try reading this forum where people put the hard disk into a new enclosure and better than half the time (yes I know, not 100 percent) the drive comes back to life. </s>
<s> If you want them to save your data, they charge for that. </s>
<s> I prefer http://www.drivesavers.com over most. </s>
