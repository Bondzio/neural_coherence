<s> does anyone have a website that might have them to buy? </s>
<s> my sister got at it and ripped the sticker off. </s>
<s> looking to buy a spare one anyway. </s>
<s> i did a google search but didnt see anything </s>
<s> http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?page=products/productlist&CRID=19&countryid=19&languageid=1&ad=g03,srch=1 </s>
<s> You didn't give any information regarding the mouse; i.e. </s>
<s> , the model number. </s>
<s> However, all Logitech (and Microsoft) wireless mice that I have seen use standard AA batteries available everywhere. </s>
<s> BTW, what was your Google search that didn't show anything? </s>
<s> A search on logitech mouse batteries yields many hits telling what batteries are used. </s>
<s> Hope this helps Frank </s>
