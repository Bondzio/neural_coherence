i am getting the exact same message.
since nobody is jumping to our aid, lets see if we can figure this out ourselves.
lets see what we have in common... 1. zonealarm free 2. symantec av corp ed 3. trojan hunter 4. counterspy i tried uninstallling zonealarm, but that didnt help.
anyone of you want to participate in what kind of software you are running, maybe we can figure this out.
