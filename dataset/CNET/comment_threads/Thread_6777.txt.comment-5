What a relief!
First I tried the new Lacie power cables - no luck.
Then I tried Disk Warrior.
What a great program.
Easy to use.
It found the problem right away.
Apparently the Lacie's Boot Blocks were damaged.
Disk Warrior fixed that and then replaced the directory, so now everything is working as it should.
Needless to say I have now started burning my archives on to DVDs as back-up.
Thanks for the support.
