<s> I was asking if anyone has experience with the q6600... so its not a duplicate post.. </s>

<s> Quad core was nice in its day but today I wonder if I would make the change you have discussed. </s>
<s> I would if it was under 50 bucks and then move on. </s>
<s> The problem is that beyond the CPU I bet I'd need a new HSF unit and maybe a bigger PSU. </s>
<s> And after all that, I wonder it it would be much faster. </s>
<s> That is, I moved from one video transcoder to HANDBRAKE and found bigger speed gains than what I would expect from changing the CPU. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Because this transcoder uses all cores of the CPU where my old software was single core. </s>

<s> If you can get the quad cheap.......go for it. </s>
<s> Looks like over 2x the cpu power. </s>
<s> ive found some excellent deals on it... i heard you can Overclock it easy (although i wont do that with this mobo) people say alot of good things about the Q6600.. im not a PC gamer, i just wanna edit Hd vids smoothly </s>
<s> the q6600 installed easily in minutes.. running cool, and running fast </s>
