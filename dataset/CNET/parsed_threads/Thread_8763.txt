<s> I recently bought a Hauppauge 1178 WinTV-HVR-1600 ( [L=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGGTY8] http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGGTY8 [/L] ) and opened it to then find out it only supports HD from over the Air broadcasts (ATSC.) </s>
<s> I'm looking for a TV tuner that can watch and record in HD from my comcast cable Box. </s>
<s> I have HD comcast cable box, and I want to be able to watch and record from that source on my computer, As I do not have a HD TV, and my computer is all I have that is capable of playing HD. </s>
<s> (1900*1200 res) Are there any TV tuner cards that I can put in my pc that will let me do this? </s>
<s> Think about it. </s>
<s> If you could receive HD/digital broadcasts (cable or satellite) on your PC, could you not therefore save the digital movie and therefore burn that digital movie? </s>
<s> What might an unscrupulous person do with that DVD? </s>

<s> the hvr1600 has a QAM tuner which will let you see/record the non-encrypted (in-the-clear) HD channels on your cable system. </s>
<s> it must be connected to your cable (not the cable box) and it won't record premium channels. </s>
<s> call comcast to determine if your cable system has clear QAM HD channels. </s>

<s> eh, you can record normal cable TV, and burn a DVD of a movie on TV if you want.... </s>
<s> It's being broadcast on TV... Are you saying that with HDTV, companies are not allowing people to record HDTV shows? </s>
<s> but it's of lower quality. </s>
<s> But recording the digital signal and burning that signal would rival a DVD quality movie. </s>
<s> That could be construed as piracy. </s>
<s> HDTV can be recorded on a DVR or such. </s>
<s> But the encryption is limited to the recorder. </s>
<s> Recording HDTV to a computer is highly discouraged. </s>
<s> Look around if you like. </s>
<s> I have. </s>
<s> There are many video cards with HDMI and/or DVI OUTPUT. </s>
<s> HDMI or DVI INPUT are nonexistent. </s>
<s> If you find one, email me. </s>
<s> You might be interested in a similar topic here: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/forumdisplay.php?f=42 If you look for the STB you have, then you can research the method. </s>
<s> Watching live HD does not seem to be as much of a problem as recording it. </s>
<s> The Hauppauge HD PVR 1212 is also supposedly capable of recording component outputs but is not a card. </s>
