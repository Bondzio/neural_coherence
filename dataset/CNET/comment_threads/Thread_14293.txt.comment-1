Here is what I would like to do.
I want to have a machine running XP Pro with a shared drive visible on the network, but have no one logged on to that machine.
This is will allow the other machines to access the network drive, and to administer the machine I can remote in from one of the other pcs.
Is this possible without logging in?
Thanks Michael
