A bit of a newbie question - I have a Linksys WRT54G and a single computer, a wifi-enabled laptop. Is it possible after going through the setup wizard, to simply have the wifi router connected directly to the modem, without the ethernet cable to a computer, so I can use wifi to my laptop? Thanks!

In your case, you just make the wireless connection when you desire. Just remember to make administrative changes to the router using a network cable. Internet --- modem --- router --- computers * * * * * If your setup is for Internet Connection Sharing (ICS), then you need a host computer to be connected at all times. Internet --- modem --- host computer -- router --- other computers
