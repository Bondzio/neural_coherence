it's busted for sure.
sorry but you may have to catch up on the wifi terminology and that &quot;new&quot; units ship with outdated firmware to solve this one.
again, been that, done that and people are very confused about why it works on one machine but not the other and to them it looks like magic when i update the firmware, set it up and it works.
don't fret about it, people are making good money on this situation.
