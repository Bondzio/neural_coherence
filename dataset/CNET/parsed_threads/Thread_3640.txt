<s> Hi everyone, I recently purchased a 19&quot; Samsung 940NW widescreen monitor. </s>
<s> I assumed that my computer would have a resolution to cope with widescreen but of course no; that would be too easy! </s>
<s> I really don't want to have to buy a new graphics card so is there any software I can download to correct the stretched images? </s>
<s> I think my graphics card is built into the motherboard and don't know how to find out if it isn't? </s>
<s> I looked under the Device Manager but there's nothing too obvious that is a graphics card? </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance everyone! </s>

<s> Just like http://techreport.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=713581&sid=4a1b45b108645ba9e0c333966c9d6ea0 you need to do that step and maybe head off to the display properties to tell it which monitor you are using. </s>
