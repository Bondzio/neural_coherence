<s> I am trying to access my USB Flash Drive. </s>
<s> It was encripted using Bitlocker. </s>
<s> I am running windows 64 Bit Ultimate. </s>
<s> When i insert the drive it says it needs to be fornatted. </s>
<s> The drive capacity is full though so i am assuming the files are there. </s>
<s> This was after i had to reinstall Windows. </s>
<s> I have a copy of the Certificate in the Personal Information Format but this is no help. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> When I see bitlocker failures I turn to drivesavers.com. </s>
<s> I already know that MSFT's answer is to format it and restore from backup. </s>
<s> I'm going to assume you read how to install the certificate and this reinstall of Windows is complete. </s>
<s> That is, I find many to forget to install all the drivers and helper apps today. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> By the way, the CNET Computer Help forum is among the most visited. </s>
<s> Try that. </s>
<s> I'll lock this and others because it would create duplication of effort and confusion. </s>
<s> Yes, Windows is Reinstalled. </s>
<s> I dont have a backup of the Flash Drive. </s>
<s> How do i go about restoring the Ceritificate? </s>
<s> I have never had to do this before. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> But MSFT is a little disorganized as I look for that. </s>
<s> I read your post and it seems like you knew all about bitlocker. </s>
<s> Read http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766295%28v=ws.10%29.aspx and try each &quot;scenario.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Still no luck. </s>
<s> Be aware that if it was that easy to crack, security pundits would slam MSFT for that. </s>
<s> I think it's best to ask drivesavers.com what can be done next. </s>
<s> If you read my prior discussions about folder and drive lock apps, my advice is always to have a backup without encryption as these do tend to fail then take the data to the bit bucket in the sky. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have trired that on a Windows XP Laptop annd no luck. </s>
<s> I think its the Drive if so whats the best Software to try and recover it if its possible. </s>
<s> The drive was working fine but i had to reinstall Windows due to the Screen going black for a reason i could not determine. </s>
<s> When i did the reinstall i spotted on the BIOS that it had tried to change it to the first boot drive. </s>
<s> I have the Encription Key in the Personal Information Exchange Format saved on a DVD. </s>
<s> - What is &quot;that&quot; in your first sentence? </s>
<s> And &quot;no luck&quot; in a later post? </s>
<s> - Can you tell in more detail what you did to recover the contents of the drive and what happened? </s>
<s> We can't guess/ - Do I understand correctly that you reinstalled Windows with this stick inserted? </s>
<s> - Why is that copy of the encryption key on that DVD no help? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> That helped in an odd way. </s>
<s> We know that XP64 is the worst for getting a proper install today. </s>
<s> It's early version would have deep issues with drivers and USB drives over a few GB. </s>
<s> I strongly suggest you move to an OS you can get support for and FORGET DRIVE ENCRYPTION if you can't keep an unencrypted backup around. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I HAVE SAME [ROBLEM BUT MY PC NOT SEE IT AND ANY PC A BUY IT NEW </s>
<s> It's new, and not for you to solve. </s>
<s> But maybe you don't have the same problem as XP64 is not offered by any company today on a new computer (I'll discount those custom shops.) </s>
