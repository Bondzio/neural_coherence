I want a burner to just back up digital pictures and maybe convert some old VHS movies to DVD.
I have been looking at the SONY but while at Walmart noticed the Lite-On dual layer that uses all +/- formats.
It also comes with the Nero software and some others as well.
I believe it was $109.00 not a bad price and about $70.00 cheaper than the SONY.
Will it hold up do you guys think?
Thanks.
