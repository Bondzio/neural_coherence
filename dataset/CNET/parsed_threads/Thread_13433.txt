<s> &quot; I did a design with Motorola and one of their groups does that sort of work. </s>
<s> Site planning, government negotiations, and more. </s>
<s> The company headquarters is in Illinois, USA, but you can find them on the web. </s>
<s> This is not cheap stuff. </s>
<s> I hope you have the millions... Bob </s>
<s> What is the companys name? </s>
<s> &quot;What is the companys name?&quot; Motorola... </s>
<s> It's easy to find with http://www.google.com Be aware that I did work for them on a two-way data over RF system, so I write with some authority and am not guessing. </s>
<s> They also do such setups and staging worldwide. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But does the orignal link that i posted look like it would support PCS? </s>
<s> Thanks Mikei </s>
<s> Whose PCS? </s>
<s> When we designed our system, the PCS in Japan was far different that in the US. </s>
<s> This is exactly what the Motorola team will find out for you. </s>
<s> Are you serious are just fishing? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 100% Serious </s>
<s> A serious inquiry would be on the phone to Motorola or others. </s>
<s> All I can do is note a company I worked for and know they do such work. </s>
<s> On your part, you seem confused. </s>
<s> Why haven't you picked up the phone and started the journey? </s>
