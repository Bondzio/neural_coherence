reinstalling windows will do little if your pc continues to run a lot of background apps or has exhausted its ram.
do you have sufficient memory?
when you pc seems sluggish, open task manager and check how much available physical memory you have.
also check your commit charge.
if physical memory is less than 100,000k (100mb) or commit charge is more than 1.5 times your physical ram, you should add more memory.
do you have a lot of background apps?
if your system tray has more 10 icons, consider removing some helper apps.
quicktime, adobe, real, creative, ms office, and many other products add helper apps that suck ram and performance but can be disabled without issue.
is your anti-virus paranoid?
av programs can sap performance if they are configured to check everything all the time.
if you're a careful user and use a good isp, you can relax some settings (such as checking every e-mail, checking every file on use, etc).
