1.1.1	This is the first time I have attempted to use the scanner on my PSC 500, since updating Win XP.	St
1.1.2	The printer works just fine, but fails to recognize the scanner portion.	St
1.1.3	Any one else run into this problem?	St
1.1.4	Thanks, Bill	St
1.2.1	Did you load the software that came with the unit?	St
1.2.2	XP will recognize the printer, plug and play but not the scanner without software.	St
