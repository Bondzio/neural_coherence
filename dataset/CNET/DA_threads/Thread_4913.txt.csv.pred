1.1.1	Okay , with the mobo I was going to either go with this ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813131330 ) or this ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813131362 ) With the processor , I was planning on getting the amd phenom 9650 AM2+ ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16819103288 ) I was going to get a wd 640gb sata hdd ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16822136218 ) I plan to get 4 or 6 gb of ram ...	St
1.1.2	I may start with 4gb and see if I need more from there ( ram is cheap enough ) ( I already have the case ) So , is this a good build ?	Ques
1.1.3	Anything you would change ?	Ques
1.1.4	I know the mobo has on board video , but I want to get a new video card .	St
1.1.5	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.6	I do n't want to pay more than 150.00 on a video card .	St
1.1.7	Also ( and this should be the last question haha ) what power supply should I get to run it all ?	Ques
1.1.8	Again , I am somewhat on a budget .	St
1.2.1	what will the rig be used for ... gaming ?	Ques
1.2.2	anything heavy duty like video editing ?	Ques
1.2.3	every day use ?	Ques
1.2.4	what case do you have ?	Ques
1.2.5	are thinking of doing any overclocking or running stock ?	Ques
1.2.6	what is the total budget constraint ?	Ques
1.2.7	are you set on amd ?	Ques
1.2.8	personally , i would step up to either the 9850 or 9950 for an extra $ 25 .	St
1.2.9	i have used both and am now on the am3 deneb 940 which is pretty cool but pricey @ $ 230 .	St
1.2.10	the first mobo is a micro ... do you have a micro case ?	Ques
1.2.11	the other should be fine if that is you spending limit .	St
1.2.12	for $ 5 more , i would step up to this harddrive.. http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16822136319 same thing but a 32mb cache and a bit faster .	St
1.2.13	what are you using xp or vista , and 32 bit or 64 version .	St
1.2.14	32 bit versions are inherently limited in system memory to something around 3 Gb .	St
1.2.15	i am building a system right now and using xp home just for overclocking and it & quot ; sees & quot ; 3.3 Gb of my 4 Gb installed .	St
1.2.16	do you already have a monitor ?	Ques
1.2.17	is it high resolution ?	Ques
1.2.18	i like ati cards myself , and could not really offer much advice ... . i have used both the 4850 and 4870 , both are good cards .	St
1.2.19	i like this one and not too far over the $ 150 .	St
1.2.20	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814127401 these cards are big , and this one takes up space with the cooler on it , but 4850 's tend to run on the hot side , and this fan setup is nice if you are a gamer ... not as noisy as most reference card fans .	St
1.2.21	but it would block one of the PCI slots on your second asus board choice , so you would have to know if you need both those slots ... there are other 4850 's which do n't take up two slots .	St
1.2.22	psu ... . http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817139002 or http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817256021 ... . both would have a little headroom and are solid .	St
1.2.23	both are modular ... not know what case you have with how much room , i figured it might be good to have the ability to reduce clutter and help cable managment .	St
1.2.24	airflow will be important with a phenom system .	St
1.2.25	hope some of this helps steve	St
1.3.1	did n't mean am3 ... meant amd , and i am on an am3 mobo .	St
1.4.1	I do a lot of animating in a program called blender ( blender.org ) so that 's the MAIN thing .	St
1.4.2	I also plan to do some gaming on it in my free time ( half life 2 , crisis , ect . )	St
1.4.3	I do n't really need the games to run on & quot ; full power & quot ; lol .	St
1.4.4	I also do n't plan on having the pc on 24/7 .	St
1.4.5	I usually turn the pc to & quot ; sleep mode & quot ; when I 'll be away from it for more than an hour or two .	St
1.4.6	I 'll be using windows vista premium ( 64 bit ) .	St
1.4.7	okay , I 'm going to change around my question a bit .	St
1.4.8	This is my case ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16811103011 ) is there something you can put together for around 600.00 .	St
1.4.9	I can go over 600.00 , but I 'd rather not .	St
1.4.10	Am I going to get a good system for ( around ) 600.00 ( give or take 100.00 ) .	St
1.4.11	Also , I prefer nvidia with the graphics card ... and no , I 'm not totally stuck on amd , I 'm okay with intel .	St
1.4.12	Oh yeah , I 'm 99.9 % sure this is my monitor ( http : //www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp ? skuId=8764483 & type=product & id=1203815243481 ) .	St
1.5.1	Personally I would go Intel as It seems for the same price your going to get better performance .	St
1.5.2	I 'm sure either way amd/intel is going to do what you need it to do .	St
1.5.3	I just think if your spending the money anyways why not get the fastest .	St
1.5.4	Good luck !	Polite
1.6.1	performance will be practically identical compared to the other mobo .	St
1.6.2	a radeon hd 4850 is a good choice for a video card , but you only need a good 500w power supply .	St
1.6.3	thermaltake 500w , $ 60 before $ 20 rebate : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817153052 pc power & cooling 500w w/free 4gb flash drive , $ 75 before $ 15 rebate ( **my recommendation** ) : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817703015 here are corsair and bfg 550w units , both are $ 90 before $ 20 rebate : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817371002 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817702008	Ques
1.7.1	No , Intel is not doing well in this budget range The Phenom 2 720 BE kicks the crap out of most processors that sell for this price , it can overclock to the mid 3 's on stock , high 3 's on air and mid 4 's on water all with safe voltages The Phenom 2 720 sells for about $ 145 to $ 170	St

1.9.1	I agree that Intel is not doing well in this budget range , but personally I just think intel is more promising in the long run .	St
1.10.1	They 're changing sockets , so no future upgrades whatever Intel does wonderfully about their budget Core i5 is useless when you have a 775 board .	St
