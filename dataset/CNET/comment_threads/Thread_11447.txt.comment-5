in all regards (especially the liquid cooling); please note that if you are building this yourself, many manufacturers won't support liquid cooling leaks as a reason to RMA a component.
If you really want liquid cooling for your rig; consider CoolIt Systems http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835227006 or the Corsair H50 http://www.corsair.com/products/h50/default.aspx
