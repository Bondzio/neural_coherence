do a &quot;backup&quot; of enough files to fill the dvd and &quot;restore&quot; to a new directory &lt;dvdtest&gt;.
if there are problems with any of this, trash the writer and get a new one.
bob is right, it would cost you more for bench service than a good dual-layer dvd writer.
and life goes on... jack
