<s> Hello, I apologize for my terrible English, thank you for reading and help me. </s>
<s> I am using Window Vista, DSL Internet. </s>
<s> My internet for the past week is not good. </s>
<s> Throughout the whole day my internet fluctuates, up and down fluctuates speed all day. </s>
<s> My DSL download speed always been good, I always get 300kb/sec stable speed, until last week suddenly it start to drop from 300kb/sec down to 6kb/sec, This is a big change, something is definately wrong. </s>
<s> I call my Verizon DSL, they do a line test on their side and they say my Modemn recieve good signal, also the DSL light on my modemn is always solid, so I am sure it recieve good signal. </s>
<s> So if nothing is wrong on their side, maybe it my computer hardware? </s>
<s> I also do a Safe Mode Networking with Verizon, I run my computer in Safe Mode Networking, and the internet speed still drop dramatically starting from 300kb/s down to 6kb/s . </s>
<s> Since I am on Safe Mode Networking and this problem still exist, it is definately not any software conflict. </s>
<s> I also scan my computer with numerous of anti-virus from Norton, mcAfee, Kaspersky, Housecall, Esset, including Malwarebyte and lavasoft, and found Nothing!!!!! </s>
<s> No virus, no spyware, Nothing!!! </s>
<s> So all that has rules out, now the only option left I can think of is something wrong with my Vista hardware. </s>
<s> How can I know if something is wrong with my hardware? </s>
<s> Can anyone please hlep me. </s>
<s> Something is wrong, I just cannot figure out what it is. </s>
<s> Thank you so much! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum/r24461863-DSL-Slow-Variable-Download-Speeds and MANY OTHER DISCUSSIONS find this. </s>
<s> You also listed more than one Antivirus so you could have left your machine with some conflicts. </s>
<s> I find those forums that read HIJACKTHIS LOGS (google that!) </s>
<s> to often help you clean up that mess. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hello, i tis not Anti virus problem. </s>
<s> Those anti-virus I use are just online scanner that I use to scan my computer. </s>
<s> After I done scan, it all have been uninstal. </s>
<s> The Only one antivirus I have in my computer is Norton, and I know is not Norton problem because I have use Norton for many years. </s>
<s> I have try update all the drives (it say all your drive to up to date) and I try unplugging modemn for like 2 hours and plug it back in. </s>
<s> The Verizon DSL also reset my whole modemn, and the problem still persist. </s>
<s> (so it definately not modemn issue) Something is going on in my computer. </s>
<s> It is not software issue since I have try Safe Mode networking many times, and my internet speed still fluctuates, so this rule out the software conflict problem. </s>
<s> I scan my computer with all of these: Norton, mcAfee, Kaspersky, Housecall, Esset, including Malwarebyte and lavasoft, and found Nothing!! </s>
<s> If there is a virus in my computer, then it super powerful then since All of these anti-virus cannot even detect them. </s>
<s> (Unlikely it is virus issue) My computer is very hot though, and it have some sound like something is running inside. </s>
<s> Maybe my computer is overheated? </s>
<s> How to know if the NIC or network card inside my computer is not working correctly? </s>
<s> My internet is so slow right now, I am so frusterated, Thank you for helping me. </s>
<s> You don't want to know how many times I've read that then we get the HIJACKTHIS LOG to find out it's still there. </s>
<s> -&gt; There is another test I use and that's to boot up a Live CD call UBUNTU. </s>
<s> No install and I can test the connection. </s>
<s> As to what you know about norton, sadly they did change how it works so can we skip all this back and forth about it's not that? </s>
<s> -&gt; And not a word about that cord mentioned in the other discussion? </s>
<s> Why not? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Oh Sorry, I understand now. </s>
<s> But How can I do the HIJACKTHIS LOG? </s>
<s> How can I get the HIJACK LOG? </s>
<s> Sorry I am not very good with computer. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Did you try a shorter cord from the DSL modem to the wall as noted in that other discussion? </s>
<s> About the HIJACKTHIS LOG. </s>
<s> It's not for everyone and while I really like what it shows it is advanced skill to read it. </s>
<s> I want to be humble here and write I do know a bit about this but am not as expert as those that do this all the time. </s>
<s> Example at http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/forum22.html Again, while I do read such things, it's usually only to point out the obvious items. </s>
<s> Even you could run that tool and see if any item is left over from Norton, McAfee and the like. </s>
<s> Usually easy to spot. </s>
<s> Try it. </s>
<s> But ask others about this (see the link in this post!!!) </s>
<s> before you delete it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sounds as if Bob has you heading in the right direction already but have you checked items running at startup? </s>
<s> Go to start, then run type msconfig press enter, when system configuration comes up, look in startup to see if that might not be some of the issue. </s>
<s> I have check all those already. </s>
<s> I also do a test on Safe Mode Networking, and it is still same, so the problem is nothing with startup software. </s>
<s> Safe Mode networking is when no software start up, it only use the basic window system to start your computer. </s>
<s> Even in Safe mode, my speed still fluctuates, like right now I only have 15KB/sec , very very slow. </s>
<s> Thank you Bob, I head over there to see if I can get any help, and I look more into the HiJackThislog, thank you sir. </s>
