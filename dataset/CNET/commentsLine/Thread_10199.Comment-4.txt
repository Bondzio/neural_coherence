i started keeping a log of this computer's crashes after finding the computer still having problems even after logical repair actions.
the events correlated to periods of time where more people occupied the area.
i then realized that the area has seen an increase in foot traffic of over 70%.
this foot traffic turned out to result in the realignment of the furniture which caused the computer to be smashed against the wall and this was temporarily dislodging the power cord just enough to crash the computer.
i have now bolted down the furniture so that it will no longer allow this to happen.
the computer crashes of this nature have stopped.
