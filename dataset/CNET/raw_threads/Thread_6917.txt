I just got my pioneer 108 yesterday from www.dangeo.com. i'm running: windows xp dell dimension 2100 128 mb ram 18.6 gb hd i took out my old drive that came with my computer and replaced it with the dvr-108. all the cords are in the same place but when i try to use it i don't get anything at all. i can get it to physically open so i can put in discs but whenever i put in a cd or dvd it tells me to insert a disk into drive D (when i double click on it in my computer.) does anybody please have any ideas of what i'm doing wrong? also whats this master/slave thing and would it have anything to do with it? cheeseman222
