<s> I am in the market looking for a TV tuner card. </s>
<s> Honestly, the functionality I want is for system such as the Playstation 2 or Xbox, or other TV peripherals such as DVD players or what have you, basically anything that uses standard AV (Yellow, Red, and White) cables. </s>
<s> The ultimate goal for me is to be able to use those systems through my computer, and be able to record the video and sound into movie files. </s>
<s> So what kind of card offers that? </s>
<s> I won't use any of the actual TV tuning features, nor the FM radio ones or any such things. </s>
<s> It will basically serve as my video game recording station. </s>
<s> However, I've looked at some cards and noticed not a lot of them actually have all of proper AV ports...many just have a video-in. </s>
<s> I figure my best bet is to get something like the Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-150 (&lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/Hauppauge-WinTV-PVR-150-MCE-White-Tuner-Remote/dp/B000E65HOO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/105-8533176-7524417?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1180660825&sr=8-3&quot; &gt; http://www.amazon.com/Hauppauge-WinTV-PVR-150-MCE-White-Tuner-Remote/dp/B000E65HOO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/105-8533176-7524417?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1180660825&sr=8-3 &lt;/a&gt;) However, I always come to CNET before making a major purchase, because you guys here generally know what's what! </s>
<s> Haha well any replies or advice would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> would an A/V switch box help? </s>
