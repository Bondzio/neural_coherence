yea i am aware of the damaged the spyware can cause and i have removed infact all of the spyware now using the software you recomended.and still it keep disconnecting from the router and have to restart it again in order to connect again.
the thing now is i am not sure whether 100% of spyware is being cleaned and removed but when i try to scan it over no threat are beign found atm so could the problem lies with my router and i hope not so because its only 7 months old and have no money to buy a new one many thanks in advanced.
