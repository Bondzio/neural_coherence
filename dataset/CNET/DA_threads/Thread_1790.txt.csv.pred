1.1.1	I have a win98se laptop using a Belkin wireless G PC card .	St
1.1.2	I have noticed that in the Win98 Control Panel , NETWORK Connections , the entry for the BELKIN Adaptor ( NOT the TCP/IP entry ) , under ADVANCED there seems to be alot of options ( mode , power , etc . )	St
1.1.3	that are not described in the documentation or appear to be accessible via the Belkin utility .	St
1.1.4	I assume these are Windows OS properties .	St
1.1.5	What do these functions do , how are they accessible , if accessible would they do anything and is there any documentation ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks , Harvey	St
1.2.1	While most of this can be found on Google searches , for the money you paid for the card , they ca n't supply a manual to document 802.11g , all the possible tweaks , why you may want to change a setting and maybe even a primer on networking in general .	St
1.2.2	So to cut costs to the bone , I find the product in some small box with possibly a quick start guide and warranty card is the cheapest .	St
1.2.3	Some buyers of networking components need a lot more information and as such can go to Cisco training , buy all the books and more .	St
1.2.4	It 's all a big question about how much is the customer willing to spend for such and why penalise those who just want to connect up their laptop .	St
1.2.5	I do n't have this answer , but maybe the answer is as we see it today .	St
1.2.6	You want more , you can buy it .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/4505-3251_7-20906426.html http : //web.belkin.com/support/download/files/F5D6020_ver2.pdf The PDF may NOT be for your card , but I see they show a short explanation for each field in the control panel .	St
1.3.2	Have you looked at their support site ?	Ques
1.3.3	If not , why not ?	Ques
1.3.4	I ask just because I want to understand why people do n't go there .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the links , but I think you misunderstood my question .	St
1.4.2	I have the BELKIN Card with its documentation and am quite familar with accessing their website for firmware/software , etc..	St
1.4.3	The parameters I 'm trying to find are in the NETWORK CONNECTIONS portion of the WIN98SE CONTROL PANEL .	St
1.4.4	There , under the BELKIN adaptor ( not the BELKIN TCP/IP settings ) PROPERTIES/ADVANCED tab , are many more parameters which can be ( apparently ? ? ? )	Ques
1.4.5	modified .	St
1.4.6	It is these parameters that I 'm trying to get more information about .	St
1.4.7	Thanks , Harvey	St
1.5.1	But did n't detail how you were trying .	St
1.5.2	Let 's see if you are : 1 .	St
1.5.3	Using the phone .	St
1.5.4	With the sheer volume of emails , few companies respond .	St
1.5.5	I find a phone call and maybe a small amount of money gets my answers .	St
1.5.6	Some will not pay for answers and those people have pretty much stated the answer is not worth it to them .	St
1.5.7	BUT Belkin is smarting from a recent debacle and now is a good time to call in .	St
1.5.8	2 .	St
1.5.9	Using the web site .	St
1.5.10	I do n't know which model you have and the particular field you want to know more about .	St
1.5.11	I did suggest that model numbers would be helpful if you want me to comment on a field in partiticular .	St
1.5.12	3 .	St
1.5.13	Using the web in general .	St
1.5.14	You did n't reveal what you tried on http : //www.google.com There is an abundance of papers on Wifi in general and you as the person with the questions would have a lot to digest as you learn about networking 802.11x and so on .	St
1.5.15	In closing , the many more parameters are mostly for Belkin support to tweak a customers setup when something is amiss .	St
1.5.16	You have n't written that its not working , but seem to be in the search for some general knowledge or worse , the engineering document on your card .	St
1.5.17	I 'm not writing this is a bad thing , but it 's a lament that such is not supplied since only a few of us would ever look inside .	St
1.5.18	Before you get upset , remember that to contain costs , they do n't just publish such things .	St
1.5.19	And putting it all out on the web site might be nice , but then you run into someone that wants a free education and again that may upset you .	St
1.5.20	Sorry about that .	St
1.5.21	There 's no reason to get upset with me .	St
1.5.22	They are a business and I 'm just a friendly person who happens to have been on a design team of a two-way data transport system .	St
1.5.23	So I can share that my desk could n't hold all my books on the subject matter .	St
1.5.24	In closing , if you can condense your question to something specific other than what each parameter does , I might be able to find a concise answer .	St
1.5.25	Any bigger question gets to the point you need a collection of books on data over RF and more .	St
1.5.26	Cheers , Bob PS .	St
1.5.27	And yes , I have a few 802.11x networks .	St
1.5.28	Home and the office/lab .	St
1.5.29	Can compare notes if need be .	St
