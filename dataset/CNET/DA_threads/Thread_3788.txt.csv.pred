1.1.1	I have an old motherboard that is used in a Digital Video Recorder.	St
1.1.2	The motherbaord is a 2003 Bayfield, the memory chip is a 256MB SDRAM DDR DIMM 184 PC133.	St
1.1.3	I want to put a 1 Gig chip in but not sure if the faster chips will work in the motherboard.	St
1.1.4	I dont need the faster speed chip, but they are all that is available now and also much cheaper.	St
1.1.5	Do you think a PC2700 or something similar will work in a 2003 Bayfield Motherboard.	St
1.1.6	I think all it takes is One Memory Chip.	St
1.1.7	I haven't opened the case up yet because I need it recording my store.	St
1.1.8	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	PC133 should be 168 pin but you mentioned DDR 184 PC133.	St
1.2.2	That 184 is a valid pin count so I'm not sure what you have but the mix isn't compatible.	St
1.2.3	You'll need to open the case, I suspect.	St
1.2.4	I can't find that board at Crucial so maybe it has another name.	St
1.3.1	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=cctv&q=2003+Bayfield+MOTHERBOARD finds this board.	St
1.3.2	The problem is that many chipsets didn't support such large memory sticks back then for simple reasons.	St
1.3.3	I won't detail how the world has changed but I find some that find it incredible that a machine today doesn't support today's sticks and drives.	St
1.3.4	But it is so.	St
1.3.5	Moving on.	St
1.3.6	http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/dsktpboards/d865gbf might be this board.	St
1.3.7	http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d865gbf/sb/CS-027111.htm does list a 1GB stick so all that you can do is try it and hope the stick's organization is fine.	St
1.3.8	This is not to offer a course in memory tech but to write I find the speed to not be the problem here but the organization.	St
1.3.9	Bob	St
