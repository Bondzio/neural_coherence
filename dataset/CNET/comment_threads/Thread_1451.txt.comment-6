The PCI slots should not be an issue in the future.
The Asus photo shows you are getting a mobo with: 1- PCI-Express x16 (for the video card) 2- PCI-Express x1 (small white bus) some mobo's with x1 &quot;Express PCI Technology&quot; only have one instead of 2.
3- PCI (regular standard large white bus).
The PCI-Express is the wave of the future, and look for more mobo's to have less regular PCI as time goes on.
I don't see you having to get a new mobo for some time (years).

Newegg is $419.
Don't forget $'s for a case, and the WinXP Operating System...Home complete $187, or Pro Full version $276 Please see my post at the Hardware forum suggesting you might want to look at Monarch building it for you for $49.
Why go thru the hassle of doing something wrong, or time if you are short of,or headache's ... with no warranty other than what you get along with parts purchase.
