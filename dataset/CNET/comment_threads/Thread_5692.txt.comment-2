If you want a PC for Multi-Tasking, Gaming and possibly the option to upgrade, I would suggest buying off well known computer builders, Such as Mesh, Cube24/7 Etc (UK Companies) Its worth a bit of research into the company if you are just searching it on the internet, but a good idea is to go into a Magazine shop and look in a computing magazine, they normally have double page ads for computer builders.
Hardware Wise - I would look for a Core 2 Duo/Quad, 3GB/4GB/8GB if you want to go all out (DDR2), HDD would be up to you, you would need to know what sort of space you are going to use, 1TB+ Should be fine.. And dont forget to make sure it comes with a keyboard, mouse and screen if you are not going to use your old ones.
Posting links to computer you have spotted would be good aswell, I would be happy to look at them and give you my opinion.
