<s> I want to create a network between our conference room and our office. </s>
<s> I have a router in our office (which has four desktop computers) and i want to extend the network to our conference room, which unfortunately is beyond the reach of the router's wi-fi. </s>
<s> I am contemplating on using repeaters for the signal to reach the conference room and then then installing a network bridge (with wi-fi) to network the desktop computers there and facilitate wi-fi access. </s>
<s> Another option is to connect the router in the office with a bridge on the conference room with cables. </s>
<s> Or is it better to just connect even the desktops in the conference room via wi-fi? </s>
<s> If you install a range extender, and the wi-fi laptop can connect, you can still share files. </s>
<s> A modern router can connect up to 128 wireless connections. </s>
<s> Your choice on wired or wireless. </s>
