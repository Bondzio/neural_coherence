i hope i don't steer you wrong here, but for just one computer hooked up to the internet, you should not need a router.
the network card goes inside you computer in a pci slot, then you plug the cat5 cable from it to the comcast thing.
i hope this is a start and does not get me in hot water for messing you up.
