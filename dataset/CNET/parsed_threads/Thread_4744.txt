<s> Hello, Can anyone help me? </s>
<s> Im building a new computer now I dont know how to configure it to work properly. </s>
<s> The motherboard (a ASUS P5GDC Delux) has only one IDE bus, and two RAID buses (one primary and one secondary). </s>
<s> I have a Maxtor 300 GB Hard Drive (ATA) and a Memorex DVD Burner. </s>
<s> When I connect both the Hard Drive and the DVD Burner to the IDE, one as Master the other as slave, the the HD light stays on for &quot;too&quot; long while booting, and it doesnt detect my Hard Drive. </s>
<s> How should I connect the drives to work properly. </s>
<s> Ive tried different ways, both RAID, both IDE, one RAID the other IDE, etc. </s>
<s> OR do I only need to know a trick for configuring the BIOS? </s>
<s> Ive tried different things there too. </s>
<s> Many goof the drive jumpers on today's hardware. </s>
<s> Today, I set the devices to all CABLE SELECT and the master or slave is determined by which connector I connect it to. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
