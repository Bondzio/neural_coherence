1.1.1	I just picked up a CF-28 Toughbook, 800mhz Mst xp.	St
1.1.2	I want to hook up a Bluetooth GPS to use in my truck with my existing mapping software.	St
1.1.3	Any reccomendations or experience with a particular card and car mounted receiver?	St
1.2.1	Since it would be surprising that I run your un-named software title I'll have to pass on answering your post.	St
1.2.2	However I will share that if I were to do this I'd look for a WAAS enabled NMEA compatible Bluetooth GPS.	St
1.2.3	I wonder what &quot;card&quot; you are asking about.	St
1.2.4	I use a variety of 20 or less dollar USB Bluetooth dongles in my system.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Sorry I use Fugawi Map of America, it uses the USGS topo maps.	St
1.3.2	I had a mouse type setup with my PocketPC but the screen is so small and hard to see.	St
1.4.1	&quot;Garmin (including USB models), Magellan, Lowrance, Silva/Brunton MultiNavigator, and any other with NMEA v2 or greater output &quot; I've found nice looking Bluetooth WAAS NMEA GPS units for under 99 bucks.	St
1.4.2	Add another 20 for the USB Bluetooth dongle and you're done.	St
1.4.3	Just check the GPS for NMEA v2 .	Sug
1.4.4	I'll let you research why I think WAAS is needed.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks for your help.	Polite
1.5.2	I know what WAAS is.	St
