<s> &quot;including vista theme(crystalxp).&quot; One of the things you learn is to eject any pretty or shiny addons and get back to boring. </s>

<s> Hence...hardware..I would pull the Video card and use the Intergrated Video[Intel].. ..also if your useing a SP2 CD to upgrade your SP1..that might be another problem.. ..your PC sounds like its aged/ I would attempt to upgrade the RAM..and the HDD(NTFS)/ .. </s>
<s> If you add up the price of upgrading your PC/ 1./New OS 2./RAM(more like 2 x 512MB's) 3./USB 2.0 .............................. You may find you really need to purchase a New Machine.. .. Also..the fax viewer in XP does contain a BUG/ it was FIXED about 4-years ago.. ..You also need to find the FIX at http://www.microsoft.com .. </s>
<s> But I would just pull the Video card and go w/Integrated Graphics.. </s>
<s> If your useing a PCI-expansion card for sound/? </s>
<s> ?/pull that also..and use the Onboard Sound.. .. </s>
<s> Instead of lowering your CRT-screen Resolution.. considering that you did PULL the Expansion cards.. you can Right-Click your Monitor PROPERTIES/in TROUBLESHOOTING-drop the hardware Accelleration-one NOTCH.. .. </s>
<s> If none of that helps..you need a better PC. </s>
