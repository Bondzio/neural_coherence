you wrote: &quot;if this is bothersome, then find the router owner and have them fix it.&quot; i posted a simple technical question and expected a simple technical response.

you surely do not expect the isp to change their configuration for me?
i would suggest that if you do not have a practical answer to a problem, do not respond at all.
this is my first experience with cnet forums.
needless to say i am very disappointed.
