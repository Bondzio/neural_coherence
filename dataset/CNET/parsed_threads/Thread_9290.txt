<s> Been getting this error message for a while now - at first I put it down to dirty or scratched cd's, however I now notice that it is also giving the same response to my e drive (both asus drives, one dvd rom, one cd rw) and also to my floppy a drive. </s>
<s> To my knowlede the only recent update to my computer is the upgrading to the latest Norton Systemworks. </s>
<s> Very annoying so any help will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Col. </s>
<s> O/S - Windows XP Home (original installation, not upgrade from previous version) Tried removing the driver and forcing an update but still got the problem - though this did fix it long enough for me to run a cleaning disk on the drive. </s>
<s> tried different types of disk as well and no format is recognised, (cd cdr cdrw and audio cd) </s>
<s> Run the anti-bug suite courtesy of R Proffitt: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 </s>
<s> ok, carried out all of the above but to no avail I'm affraid - although ad-aware finds 54 items but then crashes b4 it does anything about them. </s>
<s> gonna keep trying with that one after clearing the quarantine in spybot and see if that helps, but in the mean time any other suggestions would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks Col. </s>
<s> Didn't get round to delting the quarantine in spybot - all of a sudden the computer started to recognise the drives again without me doing anything extra. </s>
<s> I did try to roll back with system restore but got an error on that as soon as I opened it telling me that it could not protect my computer and to restart. </s>
<s> It seemed to be after this restart that it all worked again. </s>
<s> Very Odd!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> For anybody else who develops this strange bug - which, by the way, returned. </s>
<s> Look at what you have recently installed - I totally forgot I had installed Microsoft Publisher, it was this program which caused the bug - delete the program - fix the bug. </s>
<s> Only problem now is - I want the program - Oh well - such is life!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> You sure the software/application isn't looking for media in that drive? </s>
<s> Check what defaults you have set for publisher. </s>
<s> Options / general. </s>
<s> Just a thought. </s>
<s> PRoblem returned, seems it wasnt microsoft publisher aftrer all. </s>
<s> The real reason, after much searching has turned out to be Norton systemworks 2004!!!! </s>
<s> apparently it has issues with any version of nero burning rom earlier than nero 6. as I only 5.5.9 this causes a conflict. </s>
<s> Removed systemworks and no longer have the problem. </s>
<s> If you also have this problem then either upgrade to nero 6 or remove systemworks. </s>
<s> Apparently no one is getting a response from the manufacturers of norton who are burying their heads in the proverbial sand on this problem with their software. </s>
<s> Hope this helps anybody else with this issue and btw - cheapest place I have found for nero 6 is e-bay, worth a try. </s>
<s> After 5 versions (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and now 2004), the only reason I see for it is a cheap way to get NAV (which looks like a misfire in 2004) and Disk Doctor. </s>
<s> The rest can be done without. </s>
<s> Reference http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/nunt.nsf/docid/2000120915010309&src=n The same bug continues on in most if not all versions. </s>
<s> Symptoms are as following: You get a message A:\ is not Accessible Incorrect function when accessing the floppy drive and D:\ is not Accessible Incorrect function when accessing the CD Drives in Windows XP. </s>
<s> If you boot with a floppy all hardware works great. </s>
<s> If you boot XP with a CD in the drive you are able to read that CD. </s>
<s> The problem seems to be with Nero Burning ROM. </s>
<s> (System also has Norton System Works 2004 on it.) </s>
<s> I uninstalled the older OEM version of Nero and installed the newer OEM version 5.5.10.53 and everything works great! </s>
<s> I really hope this helps someone as it took me a while to figure out what was going on. </s>
<s> Good Luck! </s>
