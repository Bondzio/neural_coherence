1.2.1	what kind of internet service you have .	St
1.2.2	DSL or cable by what company .	St
1.3.1	You do n't say what Model your LT is , but I assume it has a network plug-in , you may also need to make a change in the bios to initialize the network connection , but if there is no option in the bios you may have to set up a new network connection in Windows .	St
1.3.2	Also are you testing the connection from the linksys with the same cable as with your PC ?	Ques
1.3.3	If you are using a separate cable you can check if that is okay , by substituting it with the cable you use for the PC .	St
