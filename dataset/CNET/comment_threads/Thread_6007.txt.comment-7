Yes My 2 kids acer laptops have had connection problems for months, ever since we bought them.
I just thought it was Vista as my xp Acer has never had any problems.
After seeing a thread on this topic, I uninstalled this utility on both laptops and they now they work quite well.
I have to put this in the box of truly dumb software, maybe instead of wasting time and effort on this garbage they could get their touch pad software to work properly instead of it trying to emulate a random number generator!
