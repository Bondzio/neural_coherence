In the specs it states the resolutions and the refresh rates ( i.e. 800x600 70Hz - 1028x720 75Hz etc. )for the card. While looking at my monitors manual I also noticed that it included these same numbers (resolutions-refresh rates)and that the refresh rates for the same settings were different. My question is - which of the two( video card or monitor)determines the refresh rate you see on the screen ? or how does this work ?

Example. At 800x600, your card says it will do 100 Hz refresh. Your monitor says 75 Hz. You'll use 75 or less Hz. Bob

Because I was using win98 and the refresh rate was 56 Hz. I swapped out the hard drive to one with XP on it and the refresh rate jumped up to 75 Hz. Is this normal ?

If I r/c a blank area of the desktop and select properties it brings me to a screen that applies to my vid card. If I go through the tabs on that screen I get to a screen that allows me to select refresh rate. In my case it is set to default which gives me a rate slightly higher than yours. I have tested higher rates and for my use I do not see a diff, perhaps gamers play with this stuff.
