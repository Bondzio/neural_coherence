1.1.1	I have a i7 xp 32-bit machine.	St
1.1.2	It exceeds at 4gb ram, but I have 12.	St
1.1.3	What should I do in order for me to use all 12 gigs of ram?	Ques
1.2.1	For now the Windows 32 OSes limit apps to 2.0GB RAM each.	St
1.2.2	So why did you put XP on this?	St
1.3.1	The machine was bought 2 years ago, when i7 first came out and win 7 was still on beta.	St
1.3.2	Should I upgrade to Win 7 64bit?	St
1.3.3	Because 4gb ram is not enough memory to run multiple software simultaneously.	St
1.3.4	If not, what are my other solutions?	Ques
1.3.5	Thank you,	St
1.4.1	XP and in general all 32 bit OSes limit the memory space from 2.1 to about 3.5GB.	St
1.4.2	At no time has any of the 32 bit OSes given access to the full 4GB RAM.	St
1.4.3	I noted the 2.0GB limit per app and about the only way around that and keep a 32 bit OS is to install some &quot;HYPERVISOR&quot; and run multiple instances of Windows XP.	St
1.4.4	--&gt; What a mess.	St
1.4.5	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor I guess we could do that.	Sug
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Thank you man you guys rock!!	St
1.6.2	Just one more quick question.	St
1.6.3	How does one minimize the unnecessary program/software that window runs on the bg?	St
1.6.4	It really irritates me that every time I have to manually 'force close' programs that I rarely use, but yet it is running in the bg.	St
1.6.5	Thanks,	St
1.7.1	Which begs a discussion about why we let them start.	St
1.8.1	Use the MSCONFIG utility to disable the programs you don't want running at every start up Start &gt; Run &gt; Type in MSCONFIG &gt; ok &gt; Click the Start up tab &gt; Browse through the list &gt; uncheck the unnecessary ones &gt; Hit Apply and ok.	St
