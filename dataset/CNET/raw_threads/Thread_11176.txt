My ISP is Comcast - just regular (not Small Business) home service. My general question is, what's the best way to do this, and what are the details? It works fine from within my home, of course - my laptop to my desktop via RDP, no issues, cuz the IP is just a 192.168 address. The IP seems to be fairly stable, hasn't changed in days. If I look up the IP, and enter it as both the remote server address and the gateway, I get prompted for username and password; I then get an error complaining about the Subject of the certificate not corresponding to the server name. Someone who may have done this successfully, if you could tell me what I need to do to get this working I'd be most grateful! And thank you - Paul
