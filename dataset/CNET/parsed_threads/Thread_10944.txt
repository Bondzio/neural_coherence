<s> I have a Tiny Notebook with win2000 pro installed. </s>
<s> On startup I get the above stop code with advice telling me to uninstall any new hardware, run checkdisk/f. </s>
<s> I cant do any of this as it wont boot up in safe mode, safe mode with command prompt or normally. </s>
<s> Have inserted win 2000 system restore disc, installation cd in external cd drive, all to no avail. </s>
<s> Can any body help please? </s>
<s> Does your Windows 2000 CD fail to boot? </s>
<s> If so that is the next issue to address. </s>
<s> Check your BIOS setting to be sure that the CDROM is set to boot first. </s>
<s> Then duplicate your Windows 2000 CD and see if the copy boots. </s>
<s> If that fails try an external USB CDROM drive or another internal CDROM (replace yours!!!) </s>
<s> drive. </s>
<s> As these CD/DVD drives age they can fail to be bootable but work in Windows. </s>
<s> Your old tech person will know this but new to repair staffers will lose time as they wonder why. </s>

<s> Thanks for reply. </s>
<s> HAve tried using system restore disc in internal cd and external cd. </s>
<s> I know its not the hard drive cause it boots from a ms-dos floppy, but it wont go past the blue screen of death by any other method. </s>
<s> Can I just wipe the hard disc somehow and reinstall? </s>
<s> Follow Robert's advice. </s>
<s> The W@K CD is suppose to be bootable, provided you have set the bios to boot from CD. </s>
<s> This is a way to assure you can boot. </s>
<s> You say, your HD is OK but you boot from a floppy, not the same thing. </s>
<s> If you want to start over, simply install the W2K CD in the CD drive and boot from it. </s>
<s> You should be able to reformat, etc. </s>
<s> to reload the OS. </s>

<s> Can you tell me how to get the computer to boot from cd pleasse? </s>
<s> I've clicked F2 to get into the BIOS, but I can't seem to instruct it from there. </s>
<s> Can you give me a blow by blow directions so that the computer will boot from cd? </s>
<s> thanks in anticipation. </s>
<s> I looked and could not find a manual for your machine. </s>
<s> If you supply it, I'll read it. </s>
<s> So we are left with GENERIC instructions to look over all the bios settings to see if we left out the setting to boot from CD. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Since you can enter the bios, look for a &quot;boot sequence or boot-up&quot; of devices. </s>
<s> It maybe mentioned in different ways, but generically speaking, boots in this order &quot;HD, CD, FD&quot; being hard drive, CD drive, and floppy. </s>
<s> It maybe displayed as &quot;C, CD, A&quot;. </s>
<s> As you have a Tiny system not a common one here in the USA, be sure to locate their support website or review the manual for similar info for your model#. </s>
<s> When in the bios do search all areas, it may not be displayed on the initial 1st screen. </s>
<s> If you can't find or seem lost, provide the full details of your Tiny system model(from decal/sticker). </s>
