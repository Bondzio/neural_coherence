web site is on the server.
i have my domain name, in my signature, and it points to my comcast ip address.
i have a router with dmz open on one port connected to the server.
i use a d-link dir-655 gigabit/wireless b/g/n router.
i like the d-link because it has incoming filter settings.
if someone (and it has happened before) tries to slam my site i can block their specific ip address.
dial-up service has gone as far as it can go because of copper cable pair technology.
it won't get any better.
also because the fcc regulates the strength of the signal hitting the psn (public switched network).
any stronger signal (to get a faster speed) would bleed over into adjacent cable pairs causing cross-talk.
not understanding your last question.
