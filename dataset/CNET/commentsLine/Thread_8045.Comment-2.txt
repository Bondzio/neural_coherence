you need more ram or system optimizing.
if you are seriously waiting any amount of time for your system to boot - you are under-powered or you have too much garbage in your start-up menu.
and as to the life-expectancy, four years is nothing.
my old 100 mhz green board tower, the first one i ever built, is over 12 years old.
still runs like a champ!
(they really don't build things like they used to...) so does its 1.68 gig maxtor hard drive.
turned it off every 18 to 20 hours, or whenever i took a few hours break to sleep.
i also always install extra case fansss!
my current main computer has exhaust fans in the top front bay, the rear panel and the top of the case cover in addition to the standard power supply and cpu fans and hard drive cooling fans with heat sinks for each of the three hard drives.
when it comes to mobo's and processors, heat b-a-a-a-d, shutdown good!
if you're still not happy with your microsoft product, you could always get a mac
