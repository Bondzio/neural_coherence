<s> Ok have a fairly descent gaming pc and i did have SLI but got rid of 1 gfx card to connect a firewire/usb pci card (small port) but now thats blocking my graphics card fan and is over heating i have 3 graphic card slots and when i put 1 graphics card in the middle slot it says i cant do this and should move it to the 1st slots its really annoying can any one give me tips or explain why i have 3 slots and can only use 1 for 1 graphics card i know its for SLI but it should be able to take a graphics card. </s>

<s> The Mb manual dosnt say much about the slots, when i put a gfx card into a spare pcie x16 slot, and when i start up it says move gfx card to 1st slot for non sli play... any way to override this? </s>
