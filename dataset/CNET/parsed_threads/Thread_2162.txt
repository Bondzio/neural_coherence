<s> I'm setting up a home network and need some help. </s>
<s> I'll have my desktop which will act as my main computer and 2 laptops that will access wirelessly. </s>
<s> I want to have these 3 computers backup to, and store data on a 500gb external hard drive. </s>
<s> Is there an adapter that I can run from the router to the external drive so the laptops don't have to access through the desktop first. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
