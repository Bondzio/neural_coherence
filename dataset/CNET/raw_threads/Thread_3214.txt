I have searched the net for a USB PCMCIA card but can't find a 16 bit type. Plenty of 32 bit but no 16 bit. Is there such an animal? I'm going to cross post this for a little more exposure.

PCMCIA is at maximum some 8 megabytes a second whereas USB 2.0 is some 48 megabytes per second in burst mode. No match. Bob
