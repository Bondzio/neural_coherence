hi jose, you'll get a lot of good answers here; most will be technical.
here's a philosophical answer.
can you afford the house of your dreams?
the car of your dreams?
what other purchase could you make where the item of your highest desire is as affordable as the computer you really want?
for the additional cost of a few hundred dollars you'll get the graphics card, expansion slot or whatever is desired.
it's time to think outside of your dollar limitations, because these are self imposed.
will you regret the limitation of the integrated video card?
probably not.., but will you regret the thought process that told you it was unobtainable?
yes, you will!
go for it, get it, and keep going!
