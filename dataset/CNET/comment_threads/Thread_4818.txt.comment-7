I thought you were saying to take it somewhere and just have them fix the whole situation.
BestBuy charged my brother $300 before to basically insert his recovery discs and reformat the hard drive.
My brother should've known better, and his wife should know not to delete Windows files to &quot;save space&quot; (or be allowed on a computer to begin with) but hey.
