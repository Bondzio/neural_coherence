what is a pentium 111 256mg?
any drivers you will 'need' are going to be dependent on what hardware you have.
if nothing really special an xp instal disk should have what you will need.
beyond that you can repartition your hd, but there really isn't enough info in your post to give you any pointers on that.
the more detailed information you can provide will determine the amount of good advice you will get.
any particular reason for this re-install?
