It's possible that you cannot find an equivalent replacement in retail stores.
Your ATI video card is probably AGP and your RAM is an older DDR type.
If your HD(s) and CD ROM are ATA/Atapi you'll find newer boards favor SATA and will provide limited connection for older drives.
I'd say that if your MB is 3 years or older, you'd be looking for a used replacement.
Perhaps a local computer builder could help you providing an old board from a PC that was traded in or such.
