When I plugged in a laptop, I got a correct IP and was able to ping to it and from it to a connected PC and printer.
BTW, when I first plugged in the copier to its drop, and let it try to pick up DHCP, it picked up a 169.254 address.
All gateways and subnets have been checked thoroughly.
Like I said, it is a bizarre problem.
