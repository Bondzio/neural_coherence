Thank you, but that doesn't exactly answer my question... Like I said I have no problem backing up what is on my LaCie.
What I'm asking is how I can reformat it once I have everything I want off, or if that will even help the issue.
You mention my &quot;Apple app for formatting it fresh&quot;.
What is that?
I'm not complaining about losing files, I would just prefer not having to spend $100 on a new one if I didn't have to.
Thanks again.
