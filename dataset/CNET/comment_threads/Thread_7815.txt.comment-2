You need to find the NT guru that has been keeping the server alive.
NT 4 is full of traps for new to NT people.
It's from another time where you were expected to be trained in the ways of NT.
My advice is that you don't do this given the information you provided.
It's all too possible the tape backup software will not support your new drive as well as I know only one person that I would trust installing a new scsi controller onto NT 4 besides myself.
Since it's a business, they need to get this done proper.
The old machine may take a dive during the update so the disaster plan should be laid out before the changes made.
