<s> I have a problem on one of our home's computers. </s>
<s> Last night the computer was working fine, but this morning, when the computer was turned on I got this error on the BIOS screen: &quot;remove disks or other media and press any key to restart&quot; The only problem is, there is no media in the only drive on the computer. </s>
<s> It doesn't have a floppy drive and it only has a DVD-ROM and there's nothing even in that drive. </s>
<s> I hope someone here can provide some guidance on this. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Oh, BTW system specs are: Athlon 64 X2 5600 MSI K9MM-V mobo 2GB RAM WinXP Home SP2 If you need any more info, just let me know. </s>
<s> Once again, thanks! </s>
<s> Pedo </s>
<s> hey that's weird but you know a couple of days ago, my computer gave the same message even though there were no floppies or CDs. </s>
<s> then i realized that I had attached my external USB Hard drive. </s>
<s> i know this sounds stupid (don't throw tomatoes at me !) </s>
<s> but have you made sure you have absolutely nothing attached to this computer. </s>
<s> i'm talking about any peripherals other than monitor, keyboard, and mouse. </s>
<s> this may include USB Flash drives or Hard Drives, PCMCIA, XD, SD, MicroSD or other kinds of memory cards. </s>
<s> how about a printer ? </s>
<s> this is a stupid idea but maybe even a printer or other peripheral may be wrongly recognized by the system as &quot;media&quot;. </s>
<s> Check all your USB ports, and all other peripheral interface ports just to make sure. </s>
<s> Hope this works. </s>
<s> If not, maybe you could fiddle with the BIOS a little (if it even lets you into BIOS) like maybe disabling your DVD-ROM drive if that's possible (or just physically removing your DVD-ROM drive and re-installing it ?) </s>
<s> let me know if and when you're able to fix it, and GOOD LUCK !! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I checked that, there's no USB devices/external devices connected, so that's not an issue...supposedly, (this isn't my computer it's my fiancee's brother's computer) it was fine the night before, but now it's not. </s>
<s> gonna try disconnecting the DVD-ROM and will post the results if that fixes it. </s>
<s> Thanks, Pedo </s>
<s> seems to be fixed for right now...there are 2 HDD's in the machine - one 12GB IDE and a 300GB SATA. </s>
<s> The 300GB is the primary drive and the 12GB is used only for some minor storage. </s>
<s> Anyway, long story short, disconnecting the 12GB did the trick. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help! </s>
<s> Pedo </s>
<s> If no USB devices are connected (except maybe keyboard and mouse), then confirm that the proper hard drive is set to be the first boot device. </s>
<s> Does booting to the XP CD or a Linux liveCD give you the same message? </s>
<s> Ensure that the motherboard BIOS is latest available for your model from MSI. </s>
<s> Also confirm that your motherboard battery is good (test with multimeter or replace). </s>
