Looking at full size dell desktops I see many standard size power supplies.
Yes I see the newer PCIe power connections but only a person from a decade ago might call them proprietary.
The motherboards (most) take standard PCIe video cards so not much to write there but the motherboard do tend to have the Dell 4 LED diagnostic lights but how else to deliver hardware diagnostics for all?
