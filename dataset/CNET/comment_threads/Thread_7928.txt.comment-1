I have tried to get into my computer, however when I switch it on, the Microsoft windows xp professional comes up and I press enter, but, an error screen flashes on and then it goes back to the Microsoft windows xp professional menu again.
So, I created another partition on my computer with the basics and it works fine.
Trying to access my disk drive and it comes up &quot;Access is denied&quot;Tried to restoring, but, that failed.
Any suggestions, thanks?
