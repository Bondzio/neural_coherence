I defer to the maker for support.
Sorry but I must.
Your complaint is well known and I lay the issue at the maker's door.
OK, but how do I extend a router's coverage?
I use this phrase on google if you don't know about it -&gt; How to use a router as a WAP?
I never have this issue with the usual WAP setup.
-&gt; As to your login to the repeater, I find myself resetting the repeater to it's factory setting then doing it all over.
