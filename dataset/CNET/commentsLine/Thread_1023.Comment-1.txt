hello all, i currently have a dilemma.
i currently have an hp pavilion a6700f desktop pc that i use for recording music.
i use the computer program pro tools 8, but i am trying to make my machine efficient enough to handle the newest version of protools.
now it doesn't do badly, but for the amount of music i am currently doing i need it to function at an optimal level hence i am interested in doing some upgrades.
i am new at trying to upgrade computers because usually when they become obsolete i scrap them to get another model, but my music partner told me it may be more cost efficient simply to upgrade my machine.
so my questions are what component can i upgrade without having to buy a new computer case.
would i be able to change the motherboard so i can have a faster processor and store more memory?
what kind of power supply can fit in my model of hp?
any suggestions would be very helpful.
below are my computer specs, thank you ahead of time.
hp pavilion a6700f desktop pc motherboard: mcp61pm-hm (nettle3) processor: phenom x4 9150e memory: 4gb hard drive: 500 gb power supply 300w windows vista
