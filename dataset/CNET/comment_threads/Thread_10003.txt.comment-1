I want to upgrade my mother board because I have found that I have an off brand and I would like to upgrade my video card.
I don't however want to have to buy new memory or a processor.
I have an Intel Pentium 2.6 ghz processor.
And i have ddr sdram.
Does anyone know what mother board I could get.
Can ddr and ddr2-dimm ram run in the same motherboard?
