well I think I have isolated the issue, my Video Card is taking just enough juice to be a little to hard for that PSU...I tried jumping it on, and it worked stable with 2 HDD's, 2 fans and a Cold Cathode....so I don't think either part is dead...just this one is a little too small for me...also it has 25A on the 12v Rail...that should be sufficient, if it's wattage was higher right?
