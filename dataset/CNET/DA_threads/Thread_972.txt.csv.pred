1.1.1	Ok guys and gals , put on your thinkin ' caps .	St
1.1.2	I 'm having to dive into a project that 's bigger than my experience .	St
1.1.3	I know I could go to a local integrator but , for cost reasons ( there will be no revenue return ) , I need to pull this off myself .	St
1.1.4	I 've built and managed many networks , cabled and wireless , but nothing this large nor with the type of equipment that I think I need .	St
1.1.5	We want to provide free wifi over about an eight-acre area that is partially enclosed ( it 's a large flea market ) .	St
1.1.6	The building construction is mostly steel so I 'm anticipating considerable interference and therefore will probably need a considerable number of & quot ; hot spots & quot ; .	St
1.1.7	We 'll be sharing ( at first ) a single 5-Mbps DSL line devoted strictly to the hot spots .	St
1.1.8	Equipment will be under cover although the environment could be somewhat hostile ( heat , dust , humidity , etc .	St
1.1.9	) , so I 'm wondering if I need to work with APs , etc .	St
1.1.10	designed for outdoor use which , of course , are considerably more expensive .	St
1.1.11	My other networking experience tells me that I need at least a router/gateway , possibly a switch , and some APs ( around 6-8 ) .	St
1.1.12	My problem is that I 'm not sure what might be the most economical ( but still functional ) way to configure the equipment .	St
1.1.13	If I have to run cable from my router and/or switch to the APs , my segment lengths will exceed specs .	St
1.1.14	So , I 've considered the idea of adding phone outlets in various locations that would serve up the DSL to the extremities .	St
1.1.15	I 'd then use additional routers from those locations and run cable and hang APs from there .	St
1.1.16	Trouble is , I do n't even know if the nature of a DSL signal will allow such a configuration .	St
1.1.17	Of course , I 've also wondered if there are devices out there that would make it possible to eliminate the need for cable while maintaining acceptable signal strength , etc .	St
1.1.18	So , here 's the short version ... How would you do it ?	Ques
1.1.19	I 'll be happy to fill in the blanks for whatever I 've left out .	St
1.1.20	Thanks so much for sharing !	St
1.1.21	Al	St
1.2.1	Howard : I work for a Networking hardware company : LevelOne , Digital Data Communications .	St
1.2.2	I am based in Australia , however we do have a distributor in Florida : Abovd-Net , Inc .	St
1.2.3	Address : 18851 NE 29th Ave Suite 1011 Aventura , FL - 33180 Phone : +1 ( 786 ) 279-0527 Fax : +1 ( 305 ) 466-6606 Homepage : http : //www.above-net.com E-mail : vendas @ above-net.com We have a unit that would suit this kind of situation .	St
1.2.4	It is the WAB-3000 , this is a wireless outdoor mesh .	St
1.2.5	In your situation you would need a DSL Modem/Router , which then connects via Cat5/6 to the WAB .	St
1.2.6	For product information go to : global.level1.com/products2.php ? Id=929 & PC1thId=8 Or contact the distributor above .	St
1.2.7	We make use of these units extensively in Australia , for dispersed security camera setups , and for exactly the type of large area wifi you are trying to setup .	St
1.2.8	Good luck with the project ( even if you do n't go with our product ! )	St
1.3.1	Thanks very much for the info .	St
1.3.2	I 'll be checking it out today .	St
