<s> I have a PC with a MAC keyboard. </s>
<s> Since there is no &quot;print screen&quot; button, the PC won't do a screen grab. </s>
<s> Is there a way around this? </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?&q=printscreen There are many replacement programs that allow you to change the hot-key for this feature. </s>
<s> what a ridiculous answer, why must you waste peoples time </s>
<s> I have not tried this for Print Screen but it works with other combinations of Keyboards for other things. </s>
<s> The Print Screen key is actually the F13 key on either keyboard. </s>
<s> On the PC it is marked Print Screen and on the Mac it is just F13. </s>
<s> Go ahead and try the usual PC key combination, using the F13 key, to Print Screen. </s>
<s> Theoretically, it should capture the screen and allow you to paste it into a Text document. </s>
<s> Let us know if it works P </s>
<s> I'm not sure how your answer fits into the scheme of things here Bob. </s>
<s> The answer that fits into the scheme of things. </s>
<s> For what its worth, the poster posted a PC question in a Mac forum. </s>
<s> I supplied a google that finds replacement programs that will cure the issue. </s>
<s> If you feel my answer is not right, supply what you think is the right answer. </s>
<s> -&gt; Point? </s>
<s> If you want the forum to be full of members flaming each others answers, keep it up. </s>
<s> This is not how these forums work. </s>
<s> Give your answer and let them choose. </s>
<s> Do however butt in if you find an answer to cause other issues such as total data loss. </s>

<s> On the Mac and keyboard: Hold down the Apple command key plus the shift key and press the numeral #4. </s>
<s> After that you will get a marquie with cross hairs on it. </s>
<s> Place the crosshair marquie and drag over the image. </s>
<s> You will hear a faint click, like a camera shutter. </s>
<s> The Image will be placed to your desktop as a PDF file in OSX 70DPI. </s>
<s> And on the hard drive in OS9. </s>
<s> Hold down the Apple command key plus the shift key and press the numeral #3. </s>
<s> That will get you a full screen shot that is saved to your hard drive. </s>
<s> Usually listed as a Picture file and so forth. </s>
<s> That's how it's done on a Mac. </s>
<s> May be more difficult on the PC with a Mac keyboard. </s>
<s> Nice question! </s>
<s> Why would you use a Mac keyboard on a PC in the first place! </s>
<s> Doesn't the PC have a pull-down menu to print the screen? </s>
<s> Why use the keyboard at all? </s>
<s> Kevin </s>
<s> Yeah, what a ridiculous answer... </s>
<s> I supposed, some time, people who have found an answer DONT want to give the source of their discovery to other so they step from IGNORANCE to someone who know how to do the thing !! </s>
<s> Anyways, enough second language level... Searching the same answer and non-comunicative people **** me off ! </s>
<s> cheers </s>
<s> I offered an alternative answer so they could get by. </s>
<s> If you need help in the future, are you paving the road properly? </s>

<s> I feel your pain. </s>
<s> I use Boot Camp to dual boot XP and OS X, so I run into these issues quite a bit. </s>
<s> Go to Accessories/Accessability in the start menu and select the On-Screen Keyboard. </s>
<s> That will give you a print screen button you can click with your mouse. </s>

<s> January 22, 2003 Todd Miller is using an Apple Pro USB keyboard on a Windows machine, and found a way to remap the F13, F14, and F15 keys so that they act as the Windows Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Break functions. </s>
<s> His method involves creating a text with registry information. </s>
<s> I use my Apple brand USB keyboard with a USB KVM switch to control both my Macs and a PC. </s>
<s> It works great, except I was missing the Print Screen key because the Mac sends an F13 instead of Print Screen. </s>
<s> I came across this registry edit that will map the F13-F15 to their PC counterparts. </s>
<s> I have tested this on my Windows 2000 machine and I think it should also work on XP. </s>
<s> This allows the user to press F13 on the Mac keyboard and have Windows receive a Print Screen command instead of F13. </s>
<s> Follow these instructions In order to map the F13-F15 keys on an Apple USB keyboard to the functions, Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Break commonly found on PC keyboards: 1. </s>
<s> On your PC, copy the following lines into a text file. </s>
<s> REGEDIT4 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout] &quot;Scancode Map&quot;=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,04,00,00,00,46,E0,5F,00,46,00,5E,00,37,E0,5D,00,00,00,00,00 2. </s>
<s> Rename the text file remap.reg. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Double click on the file remap.reg and answer yes to the question about adding the information to the registry. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Reboot. </s>
<s> Function keys are now remapped to their PC equivalents. </s>
<s> Thanks for posting a real solution. </s>
<s> This helped me a ton. </s>
<s> My sentiments exactly. </s>
<s> I have a Macbook with a dual Windows boot, and for the longest time, could not get any of the keyboard combinations to do a Print Screen for me. </s>
<s> Your OnScreen Keyboard solution is perfect, and I would never have known about it I hadn't seen your post. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> What a simple solution :)) </s>
<s> what if u don't have F13 </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Alternatives were offered along with some other tips. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> how do i find the Apple key </s>
<s> i haven't found the default remap for the printscreen key (yet), but in the meantime you can do start-&gt;run-&gt; type in &quot;OSK&quot; -&gt; hit enter. </s>
<s> this pops OnScreenKeyboard and i us it to printscreen very often. </s>
<s> beside f12 there is the psc key. </s>
<s> i kinda miss the spaces between the grouped F keys, but like most things this i'm sure will take getting familiar with to overcome. </s>
<s> i failed to see the last two comments. </s>
<s> Thanks ! </s>

<s> (Using the On-Screen Keyboard will not change the active window, so you can even grab just the window you want). </s>
<s> ______________________________________________________________________ I tried what you suggested, which worked fine, except that it captured the on-screen keyboard as well! </s>
<s> I also tried the 'active window' capture, by clicking on the alt key, but that didn't work at all. </s>
<s> I know the other work-around is to use the screen capture feature of a paint package program, which is what I'm doing at the moment, but it's a little long-winded. </s>
<s> I never thought I'd miss that simple but very effective key combination! </s>
<s> It was so much quicker and easier. </s>
<s> I think I must be doing something wrong. </s>
<s> By the way, I'm using a MacBook, which may or may not make a difference to anything, but I thought I'd mention it anyway. </s>
<s> If there are any other suggestions, or any pointers as to where I might be going wrong, I'd be extremely grateful to try them. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> It's not that I didn't like them. </s>
<s> From what I read of them, I do not have a F13 key (or 14 or 15 etc, come to that), I'm familiar with, and use, the relevant key combination when using Mac's OS, and I'm not technically savvy (or confident) enough to mess with code. </s>
<s> I also have neither the time nor the patience to roadtest every Google link. </s>
<s> The tip offered by MasterOfNone seemed perfectly reasonable until I tried it out. </s>
<s> Unless I've missed something, I didn't see any other suggestions. </s>
<s> HM </s>
<s> Those instructions worked perfectly for me. </s>
<s> Since I have a MacBook Pro, I have no F13 key. </s>
<s> These instructions were very helpful! </s>
<s> The active window capture works for me. </s>
<s> Use the &lt;alt&gt; key on the OSK and click &lt;psc&gt;. </s>
<s> Just make sure the on screen keyboard doesn't overlap the window you are trying to capture. </s>
<s> Thank you for your reply. </s>
<s> I had already worked out that moving the OSK would ensure it didn't get captured as well. </s>
<s> What I didn't realise, when trying the active window capture, was that I had to deselct the &lt;alt&gt; key after clicking on the &lt;psc&gt; key. </s>
<s> Please take note, people: NEVER make assumptions when giving instructions - include EVERY SINGLE STEP. </s>
<s> Idiot-proof info is absolutely essential for brain-dead prats like me! </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> HM </s>
<s> I stumbled on this forum asking the same question... </s>
<s> I want to point out it is a very relative question to this or any mac forum... remember intel macs run windows... </s>
<s> Someone here posted that it should be f13 key... </s>
<s> I tried but it didn't work... Then i tried f14 key and Voila... curious thing is f14 is right where the print screen should be... </s>
<s> Maybe the one that is shaped like an apple...? </s>
<s> It is the one in the lower left hand corner of the keyboard. </s>
<s> Around where the ctrl, windows, and alt keys are on a pc. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
<s> --rbedi100 </s>
<s> The answer is very simple. </s>
<s> The very small MAC keyboard is great because of it's size. </s>
<s> That is exactly why I am ditching my keyboard and buying one. </s>
<s> I don't want or need all the extra keys, I like simplicity. </s>
<s> However, I would not purchase one if the print screen option was not available. </s>
<s> Thanks for providing the answer. </s>
<s> I had the same problem... the easy fix here is to use the Windows On-Screen Keyboard found in: Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Accessibility &gt; On-Screen Keyboard. </s>
<s> Then, just click the &quot;PSC&quot; button next to the F12 key. </s>
<s> Tada! </s>
<s> http://webpages.charter.net/krumsick/ finally the solution came to me as i was searching for something else this program lets you set that you have a mac keyboard, then in half-learn mode if you press say, f14, you can select from the dropdown that you would like to remap it to printscreen instead. </s>
<s> bye bye OSK </s>
