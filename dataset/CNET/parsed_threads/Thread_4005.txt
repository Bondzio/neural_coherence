<s> My computer has 16 gigs ram and I don't know what to do although I suspect its a RAM or Java issue. </s>
<s> Windows 7 Ultimate inel core i7-2600k CPU @ 3.4ghz 16 gigs ram installed 64 bit Crossfire Nvidia? </s>
<s> cards To start I was running a Minecraft server on my computer (using less then a gig Im guessing) running it 24/7. </s>
<s> Then computer started blue screening after any short time of running the server. </s>
<s> Now I don't run the server and computer still blue screens from just playing games or running youtube or anything like that. </s>
<s> I thought this has to be a RAM or Java problem. </s>
<s> I get error reports on my desktop everytime. </s>
<s> usually the errors are bad_pool_header or 1-2 other blue screen errors. </s>
<s> Im uploading some of the reports. </s>
<s> (memory_management,etc) Like I said I believe the error is either Java related (as I messed around with RAM allocation in Java to suit Minecraft better (run server/minecraft its self better)) I ran &quot;MemTest&quot; on my computer and it almost immediately gives me an errors stating that my RAM isnt storing data values correctly and is not storing data etc. </s>
<s> Anyone able to help as to what possible fixes I could try would be very helpful. </s>
<s> I would least of all like to have to buy more RAM which Im sure I would have to try each ram stick individually running untill I found the error before I could figure out what needs replacing. </s>
<s> Anyone that could help me in understanding the problem or if the Bluescreens are RAM or Java related would be helpful. </s>
<s> (Also I have uninstalled/reinstalled java twice.) </s>
<s> But u can see at the bottom of the error reports that there is mention of minecraft and the code I put in to give it more RAM allocation. </s>
<s> thanks ahead! </s>
<s> LMK if more info is needed. </s>
