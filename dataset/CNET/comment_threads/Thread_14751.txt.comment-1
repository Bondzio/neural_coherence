I bought a 320GB Western Digital Scorpio Blue hard drive (WD3200BEVE) for a laptop that died.
Since then I have gotten rid of the laptop but wanted to use the hard drive externally for my PC for storage.
I bought a Gigaware 2.5&quot; IDE Hard Drive Enclosure.
I set it up and the enclosure light turns blue.
The PC searched for the drivers for quite a while and failed.
From what I see on the WD website they don't offer drivers for external use of the hard drive.
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks.
