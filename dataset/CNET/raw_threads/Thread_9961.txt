Access is denied&quot; -please help. Answer Was this post helpful ? Reply Quote I had the same problem. I found a solution. Logically it makes no sense to me, but it worked so... Go to Control Panel. Choose printer. Then choose Add Printer. ChooseAdd a local printer. Click on Create a new port. The default in the drop down box is Local Port. Do not change that. Click Next. A dialogue box will appear asking for you to enter a port name. Type in the \\computer name\printer name ie. My computer's name is basement and the printer name is EpsonSty so I typed in \\basement\epsonsty Yahoo! It worked. Go figure! I guess Microsoft thinks printers on a intranet are local. Hope this helps someone else so they don't spend the hours I did on it! // It worked for me.
