The P-660HW has it's own wifi and router.
Setup could be classified as &quot;experts only&quot; when you add a second router.
Given only model numbers and no details about settings it is time to ask those that set this up to see if the settings are proper.
I can't tell such from your post except it's not a stock or standard setup.
Again the P-660HW is more than a modem.
I couldn't find a P-660.
