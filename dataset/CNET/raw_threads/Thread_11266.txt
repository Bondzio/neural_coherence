I've had some problems getting XP to &quot;see&quot; it but now the issue is an error message I don't understand. The drive shows up under my computer but when I click on it I get this error message. &quot; The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error&quot; Anyone know what that means or what I can do about it? thanks

Try another machine to get what you didn't backup off that drive. Bob
