i am one of the many &quot;core gamers&quot; (buys 1+ game/week) out there and i've gone to great expense for my hobby.
i don't hold back on expense.
i own a falcon nw mach v, and keep it updated regularly.
the point is, i don't buy sub par equipment.
my choice for gaming in a monitor?
the hp f2304 23&quot; 1900x1220 lcd.
it's wide screen, so supports that' feature in the growing number of games that support it.
it's digital, not analog and that's a big deal when you're looking for a great picture.
it also has, to my knowledge, the highest resolution you're going to find.
it also has a clearer, more brilliant picture than any monitor i've ever seen.
it's pricey at over $2,000 per (i have 2 and use the dual monitor support), but they're worth every penny.
and yes, btw... i did consider a crt, but today?
well, that's kind of like saying you stick to vinyl because you like the little crackling sound in the music.
i've never had any regrets about going with lcd.
just the opposite.
i've had many many night of far more pleasureable, brilliant, beautiful gaming, with colors so bright, far more clear, and reflection free color.
now, if you're going to skimp on your monitor and want to save money, i would not encourage you to go lcd.
the lower end lcd's ghost and actually have problems keeping a clear picture (especially analog) and you won't find many dvis in lcd on the low end.
so if money's no object, get the hp f2304 and if you don't have the money to at least get an lcd with a dvi interface, then you might as well stay with your crt, but at least buy the spider (a color correction tool (hardware) which works especially well on crts... but not quite as necessary on lcd's).
