That's a slick little device.
The attack I was specifically a type of MITM attack against EAP-TLS and PEAP where an attacker gets between the client and the AP.
During the initial phases, the attacker sends the client a bogus cert.
If the client is not required to validate the cert, then it blindly accepts the cert and authenticates with the bogus set up.
The attacker can then relay to the actual server and authenticate on to the wireless network.
The attacker is now in a position to intercept and decrypt all traffic between the client, and the real AP.
This is a fairly sophisticated attack that would be difficult to mount against a setup like mine, and there are ways to ensure that you are on the right network, but in an environment where you have a wireless network spanning multiple buildings, this could be a cause for concern.
