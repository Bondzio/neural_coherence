is to start over.
did you use a disk to format your drive besides 2000?
you should of recieved another disk with your new drive.
You can also use a old 98 or ME startup disk and boot to dos and type fdisk.
choose large disk format, delete partition then make new.
you would need to go into your bios first and change to floppy boot first.
