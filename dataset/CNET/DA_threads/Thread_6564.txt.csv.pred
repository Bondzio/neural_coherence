1.1.3	I 've 640 In Ram and the processor runs at 2.53mghz .	St
1.1.4	Well , the problem is that I 've ripped some dvd movies , and then copied then on dvd -r media , I 've tried ( memorex , tdk and verbatim ) , and when I finish , they all play well on the computer dvd , but when I put them on my sony dvd player in the living room , I get some still screens and some skips .	St
1.1.5	All of them are like that , and I 've tried in different dvd player that support the dvd -r/+r and so forth .	St
1.1.6	I 've use Cyberlink Dvdcopy , Dvd Shrink , Nero Burning Room .	St
1.1.7	I 've burn at different speeds also , and I got the same problem .	St
1.1.8	I 've disable any background program while burning , and leave the computer alone to do its job , but it is the same .	St
1.1.9	I go see the movie , it plays really well , but then some scenes in the movie get still for seconds or skip .	St

1.2.1	& quot ; they all play well on the computer dvd , but when I put them on my sony dvd player in the living room , I get some still screens and some skips .	St
1.2.2	& quot ; I had this APEX DVD player that I gave away .	St
1.2.3	Why ?	Ques
1.2.4	It did that on DVD+R and DVD-R from any machine/drive .	St
1.2.5	You need to try another DVD player .	St
1.2.6	In closing , I am thinking the 4X media should be burned at 2X , 8X at 4X and so on .	St
1.2.7	Just a nagging feeling it works better .	St
1.2.8	No websites to back me up , just me .	St
