i'm looking for a good reliable all-in-one to print, copy, and fax.
all the user reviews of hps products have made me want to avoid them like the plague, but there's not many other choices.
canon looks like a good, yet not perfect fit.
i need a good printer/copier that does well with drawings and text.
printing photos isn't the most important issue, though it would be nice.
i also need a fax that has an auto document feeder that works, which seems like the weakness of most that i've looked at.
am i better off getting a print/copier combo and a dedicated fax, or there any machines that do it all well?
