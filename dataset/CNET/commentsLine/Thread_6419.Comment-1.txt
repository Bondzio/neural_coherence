i have a hp laserjet 1100a that used to be connected through a standard parallel port, and of which both printing and scanning functions worked properly.
last year, i had to purchase a new computer (windows xp pro included).
since it has no parallel ports and installing a parallel port pci card did not work, i connected the printer through a parallel-to-usb cable adapter.
the printer works perfectly as a standard printer.
however, when i install the scanning software from the cd, i am prompted for a physical parallel (lptx) port, which of course makes no sense for my environment.
and while windows xp detects the scanner as a &quot;parallel&quot; peripheral, i have no driver to configure it and make it operational.
so my question is: is there an existing driver that supports such a parallel-to-usb connection for the scanner module?
if so, where can i get it?
thanks in advance for any helpful information, jeff
