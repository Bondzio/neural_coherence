<s> I heard before that if you add any more memory over 1gig it will not improve performance e.g. </s>
<s> games. </s>
<s> and that it is usually used for servers. </s>
<s> would going from 1 gig to 2 gig make a difference in games like doom 3 hl2 bfv and rtcw:et? </s>
<s> today for most games 512 mb is enough. </s>
<s> 1gb is excellent and 2gb is basically unnecessary right now and a waste of money. </s>
<s> Currently 2gbs is useless for gaming. </s>
<s> But your money would be best spent on other parts. </s>
<s> What parts do you have now? </s>
<s> p4 3ghz intel 915g mobo, 512 x 2 dual channel 400MHz, i want to upgrade the ram to corsair xms pc3200 512 x 2, with lower latency. </s>
<s> would this improve performance over stock ram? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> With your hardware, how can it get any better? </s>
<s> As was mentioned, over one Gig is overkill unless you're producing, ripping, converting, and burning DVDs. </s>
<s> Maybe your monitor is not up to the task. </s>
<s> Most people never consider upgrading the monitor. </s>
<s> If the pitch is .28 or above, a Terabyte of ram won't help. </s>
<s> How about your graphic card? </s>
<s> A bare bones card is the easiest to replace, and with a good monitor the results can be spectacular. </s>
<s> Just some thoughts. </s>
<s> on intel lower latencies barely affect performance. </s>
<s> On an amd processor (which is much faster than an intel on nearly all games in existance) they benefit from lower latencies. </s>
<s> Fortunately if you have 2gbs on an amd you will not have any lower performance. </s>
<s> An athlon 64 processor has such a high bus speed (thanks to hyperthreading) that it would take many sticks of ram to for it to bottleneck your ram. </s>
<s> For example the FX-55 has a clock speed of 2.6GHz, the bus speed would also be 2.6GHz. </s>
<s> Perhaps you would also be thinking of a new video card? </s>
<s> 3 ghz is pretty low by today's standards. </s>
<s> It's the second lowest speed for intels p4s that run on that chipset. </s>
<s> but not AMD, whos processors are all under 3Ghz. </s>
<s> Even though it's the second slowest P4 it's more than adequate in today's world. </s>
<s> Once again we are accustomed to the American ideal that more is better! </s>
<s> But its not. </s>
<s> Even Intel has realized that now. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> x800xl pci express graphics card and sony 17 in flat panel monitor </s>
<s> not everything is soley dependant on the cpu. </s>
<s> i really dont care that i have an intel. </s>
<s> my games run fine with everything on high settings and high resolution. </s>
<s> (over 60 fps) EVEN WITH AN INTEL CPU. </s>
<s> i have a very good graphics card(ati radeon x800xl) and my monitor works just fine for games. </s>
<s> so i really dont care for amd. </s>
<s> because i just bought my pc and i am not going to go run out and build an amd system just to get a few more fps. </s>
<s> Did i say everything? </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> Anyway you cant always look at the clock speeds, a 2.6 ghz athlon 64 will give you more frames per second than a 3.8ghz pentium 4. </s>
<s> Athlon 64s also run much cooler and quieter. </s>
<s> sry but heat isnt an issue for me. </s>
<s> BTX case and mobo = 2 120mm fans. </s>
<s> anyway, i can always upgrade my cpu to a faster p4 with the new 64 bit support. </s>
<s> it just is useless now </s>
