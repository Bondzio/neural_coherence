At first i thought it was a virus or malware, scanned and scanned again. Nothing came up, so i tried to reinstall windows. That didnt work still froze. Then my psu went, thought maybe thats why it was freezing because it was old.Then i thought maybe there is a virus but i need to really clean it out, so i got a hd scrubber, that didnt work. This machine is old, could this be because of its age?Could the motherboard be shorting out? Or the processor? Its about 5 years id say. Its a : Amd Athlon 2700 processor 120 gb hdd 2gb ram Win xp pro 400w psu

Do you get any beep tone errors prior or during freeze up? Many times, depending on the system, that can or may be an indicator. Pull the side case off and watch the fan function, especially CPU. If the fan lugs or drags, it is time to replace, hope that is all it is, meanwhile, good luck!

That is we know to turn such a machine away from repair no matter how minor as the owner would then claim all troubles were because of our repair even if it was to glue the decal back onto the frame. Consider that it served well and start looking for something newer even if it's from the free list at craigslist or freecycle. Bob

Sluggish to me, but not freezing until I start running heavy duty stuffs like photoshops with mp3 playing and video watching simultaneously which are tolerable to me. The few things you can give it longer life are: 1) updates for graphic card... your graphic card will already have new updates which will unfreeze 2) motherboard updates - bios, drivers.. lookup the manufacturer's manual on how to do it 3) updates for windows - especially drivers and DirectX. Stick to 9 if possible as 10 may not running smoothly on older cards 4) autostart programs - some programs you installed may put one of these little fellows. www.download.com have some good utilities which you can use, but do it with caution. 5) game/programs - newer ones will require newer hardware specs. Stick to those within the era of the hardware, unless it's necesary to have new ones. Exception will be the security s/w. Again, www.download.com have some good reviews on these guys, especially in relations to hardware requirements. Hope it helps.

If noting three times won't do, then you must pay up. My brother does this, I on the other had freecycled off some old gear rather send it to the e-waste place. Bob
