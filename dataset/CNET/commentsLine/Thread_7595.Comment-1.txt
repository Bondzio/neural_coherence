i have a canon pixma mp170 all in one printer/scanner/copier.
i bought it in 2005 installed it on my computer, windows xp operating system and it worked fine.
i have a 200gb hard drive with plenty of space, 1 gb of ram, 2.4mhz processor.
my computer crashed in march 2006. i reinstalled all my software but the computer cannot find the scanner.
it has found the printer which works brilliantly.
i have deleted and reinstalled all the canon software to no avail.
if i click on &quot;start&quot; go to &quot;control panel&quot; then &quot;scanners and cameras&quot; the scanner is not there.
if i click on &quot;add device&quot; nothing happens.
i have rang the canon help line, they downloaded the latest drivers and it still doesn't work.
the tech.
said it must be something to do with my operating system.
i would appreciate any help.
thanks john
