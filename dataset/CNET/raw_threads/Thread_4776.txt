There are several stories and a statement from nvidia re a high failure rate? Does anyone have more information? Are all the chips bad? My mac is not coverage by applecare, should I be concerned?

Apparently, many NVIDIA graphics cards are subject to manufacturing defects. As such, they could fail after certain periods of use. I have heard that the supposedly affected 8400 and 8600 cards actually belong to computers built by Dell and HP; Apple may not have them. No one knows if ALL of the chips are bad. Some people say that their NVIDIA-equipped MacBooks are failing, but they are in the minority (so far). Mine works perfectly, and many others do too. If your MacBook works fine, I wouldn't be concerned. If Apple orders a recall, then it should cover all affected notebooks, covered by AppleCare or not. You can only wait and see. -BMF

It's true. there is a serious problem and i know from experience: two replaced MBP logic boards and it's still dead but now out of warranty. if ur screen goes dark on boot and OS only sees the nvidia chip as the intel one, u know u got the bug. the only fix is logic board replacement. did that twice, as apple just replaces with the same board and they only last x amount of months. total hose job for hundreds of users so far. i had to get an imac to get some work done, the mbp is sitting in a box.
