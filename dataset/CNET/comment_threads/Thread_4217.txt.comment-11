Simple, portable, fast, fewer moving parts, larger storage space.
I seldom use anything else.
Just an occasional DVD movie on the DVD drive/player.
I also back up to a second Hard drive.
The real professionals uses other drives to back things up to on specialized computers called servers.
They might also make backups to off-site locations to avoid disasters.
This explanation is an oversimplification to reduce confusion, this can be very complicated in the real world.
