an integrated graphics card probably won't give you a great experience with the more graphics-intense games.
but it might not bee too bad.
you can upgrade most computers graphics with a card, and there are a lot of good cards available for less than $100.00.
check to see that it has a pcie slot available, in case you want to upgrade later.
