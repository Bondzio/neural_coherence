Hi there, Im not sure if this post fits in this area, so i apologize in advance i am new to cnet.
anyway i recently built my first PC.
Specs: CPU: Quad Core Q6600 MB: Asus P5N-D RAM: Kingston Hyper X 2GB HDD: Seagate Terabyte GFX: NVidia GeForce 8500 OS: Vista Ultimate 32 bit The question i now ask is will crysis warhead run on my PC?
i downloaded the original crysis singleplayer demo and turned the spec way down, this caused it to look horrible...which doesn't suprise me neither does it appeal to me.
The reason i now ask this is because apparently they optimized crysis warhead to run far better on a wider range of pcs (im guessing lower spec).
So what is your opinion do you think it will run at an acceptable level?
