I need to buy an external firewire-800 hard disk with at least 0.5TB, but I've never did this before.
What are the best reliable options?
Things to consider: - My first choice would be a 3.5'' 2TB portable USB powered compatible with any OS (some HD comes with software and I don't mind if mine does not) - but I couldn't find any (that would ship to Brazil)!
- First thing is portability - no AC power, small size, things like that - but I'm willing to give that up for a good priced with 2TB.
- Second and last, but not least, is again warranty and reliability - this is more a question if I should go local rather than international shipping.
- I'm thinking about those two opposite options right now: http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/MEQM7500GB16/ http://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-FireWire-External-WDBAAJ0020HSL-NESN/dp/B002RL8J12/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1266077647&amp;sr=1-1
