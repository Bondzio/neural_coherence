i recently purchased a new computer and i'm curious as to how good/bad it is?
how long before i will have to replace it?
the websites i viewed gave me mixed answers.
cpu - amd athlon 64 3400+ motherboard - ga-k8ns pro nforce3 250 video card - geforce fx 5700 le (256mb ddr) harddrive - 80 gbs memory - 512 mbs pc3200 400mhz (planning to upgrade soon) those are the basics.
i didn't include the dvd/cd-rw drive cause i'm lazy.
but that is much easier to upgrade than a processor and motherboard.
