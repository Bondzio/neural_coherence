<s> I've received alot of great help here, and I'm hoping you can do it again. </s>
<s> I live in a long ranch house. </s>
<s> On one end I have my desktop computer and a Netgear WNDR3300 wireless router. </s>
<s> In another room, approximately 70 feet away, is another desktop computer that is not near a cable jack so I'm using a D-Link AirPremier DWL-G550 PCI card with antenna to connect to the Internet. </s>
<s> The connection is so-so and reception depends on the placement of the antenna. </s>
<s> Approximately 20 feet further away is a Wii which cannot detect the wireless signal. </s>
<s> I would like to replace the router with one that has a stronger signal that is able to reach the 90+ feet necessary to establish good connections to the computer and Wii. </s>
<s> Are newer routers able to dependably cover long distances? </s>
<s> Most usually have disclaimers about walls, building materials, etc. </s>
<s> What I don't want is to buy a new router and spend several hours setting it up only to find that it's no better than the one I have now. </s>
<s> I was looking at the Asus RT-N56U model. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any opinions on this or other models that would solve my problem. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> All router &quot;power&quot; is limited but the FCC so no router is more powerful than the next. </s>
<s> I will write the DWL-G550 is a card that was indeed SO-SO and using another antenna helped. </s>
<s> This is why we have other solutions like moving the router to a central location or using a second router as a WAP. </s>
<s> Sorry but the answer is no. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> OK, now that we know that routers don't have &quot;more power&quot; or vary greatly in distance, what can we do? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Location, location, location., There are many that for whatever reason will not place the router in the central location (or worse, in the basement!) </s>
<s> These folk are best left alone to let them buy enough routers until it sinks in. </s>
<s> This is not mean at all. </s>
<s> It's how many folk learn. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> With location our of the way, the basic settings are covered in the CNET Forums often. </s>
<s> Let's repeat them. </s>
<s> Router Defaults, except for what the ISP wants. </s>
<s> Then we change the SSID to simple things. </s>
<s> SHORT IS GOOD! </s>
<s> Never hide the SSID and switch to WPA2 AES/PSK (WPA if your gear does not do WPA2). </s>
<s> Finally we may change the channel. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> NO 2.4GHz cordless phones allowed. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I cannot centralize the router. </s>
<s> My office is where it is and cannot be moved. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If all routers are distance limited then why, if I do a network search, does the computer pick up signals (sometimes moderately strong) from the neighbors routers which are certainly more than 100 feet away? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I've heard about gizmos you can buy (that you place in other parts of the house) that boost the router's signal so you can cover more distance. </s>
<s> Do these things work? </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> My phones are Panasonic DECT 6.0. </s>
<s> Item 2 can be rough on folk but let's try. </s>
<s> You know how LIGHT bounces off mirrors and walls? </s>
<s> You get dark and light spots. </s>
<s> The same is true with RF. </s>
<s> It's not an even distribution and a spot could be better because of a bounce or other reflection. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Gizmos. </s>
<s> I never use them. </s>
<s> I use well worn solutions such as &quot;HOW TO USE A ROUTER AS A WAP&quot; (google that) since it's cheap, effective and I am sure of what it does and the boost in the coverage. </s>
<s> No gizmos. </s>
<s> In short I can use a 25 to 50 foot ethernet cable to my ROUTER AS A WAP towards the spot that isn't so hot and I've good. </s>
<s> If the ethernet cable is verboten, I can use a powerline bridge to the router as a wap. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Due to Bob's replies I did Google research on WAPs which led to repeaters and wireless range extenders. </s>
<s> I read reviews on many of these (mostly Netgear, Linksys and D-Link) and most got many bad comments. </s>
<s> I was ready to give up when I ran across a relatively new model by Diamond, the WR300N. </s>
<s> It had almost uniformly good reviews so I decided to try it out. </s>
<s> It took me about 15 minutes to set it up, and I'm glad to report that it works like a charm. </s>
<s> I plugged it in about 50 feet from my router and now both the desktop computer and Wii at the other end of the house have strong wireless signals. </s>
<s> If you can't move your router or use a router as a WAP I suggest trying out this product. </s>
