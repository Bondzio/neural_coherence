Greetings, After some long hard work and help from the forums.....I have the box up and running.
The board was not compatible with the cpu until a bios update was performed.
I found a old am2 sempron, threw it in....then updated the bios....then all power issues were resolved with the 9850.
Also, the ram was a problem, would not boot with that Corsair.
So....bottom line is that I had two issue going on.
Tons of work was done thinking that this was a short or connection...etc..etc...for all the newbs out there wanting to build....DONT GIVE UP....KEEP DIGING.
The payoff of building your own system compared to buying .... is infinite...money and performance wise.
The only issue that im having now is the board sees one type of hdd but not another....another post is inevitable but im certainly getting there with everyones help.
thanks, RedTail
