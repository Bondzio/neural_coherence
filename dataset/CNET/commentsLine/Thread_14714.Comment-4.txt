hi chip, yes, i saw that in todays specials that will last until 7 may and it may fit a nitch for some people.
the hp a1022n was just introduced march 31st and appears to be a update of the hp a810n with both having the same motherboard, the only differance being the a810n has a 3300 processor and 160gb hdd.
comparing the difference of emachine t6212 with the hp a1022n: the hp a1022n: athlon 64 3400 processor, socket 754 integrated graphics, can upgrade to agp video cards.
has 200gb hdd price: $649.98 w/17&quot; crt monitor after rebates.
maybe printer?
the emachine t6212: athlon 64 3200 processor, socket 939 integrated graphics, can upgrade to pci-express x16 video cards.
has 160gb hdd price: when on sale $550 w/17&quot; crt monitor & printer after rebates.
it may not make a difference to some people not having the latest features for the future like socket 939 and the pci-express video cards, so paying aprx $100 more for the future obsolete socket 754, agp tech, but larger processor and hard drive may be ok for them.
another that may be of interest (near the price range) that i would consider is the gateway 827gm media center edition 2005 with tv tuner: athlon 64 3500 processor, socket 939 integrated graphics, can be upgraded to pci-express x16 video cards.
has 200gb hdd price: at circuit city, $724.99 after rebates or... $989,97 with 17&quot; lcd flat-panel nonitor and printer after rebates.
