However, the hub works fine with other devices, like my logitech mouse and gamepad. If I unplug the hub from my laptop and the devices that screw it up from the hub and then plug just the hub back in, it works fine again, but sometimes has to reinstall the driver. So why does the hub work with some devices and not others? It has enough power and all devices work on my onboard usb ports... (HP pavillion laptop, Vista)

The hub gets to have such a low power output after those devices are plugged in, it can't even communicate with the computer. Buy one with an external power connection or just don't use devices on it that make it fail.
