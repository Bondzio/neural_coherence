sony does use atrac3 for audio on lots of things, as it provides a tighter compression (it's like 2x mp3 or something) but it's always used on stuff that includes software to break it back to mp3 (like psp, which uses atrac3, but it's software for pc (that loads the music) is capable of putting it into mp3/converting it, so that you can use it on either) also all oem builders have their own format for the motherboard (most do, to hinder upgrades/save money) dell is horrible about this ^
