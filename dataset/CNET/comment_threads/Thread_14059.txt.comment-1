I upgraded my 60MB hard drive to a 200MB; How do I transfer all my data to the new hard drive.
I realize that having two hard drives don't hurt but my system boots from the 60MB drive and I would rather have everything boot from the 200MB drive.
I'm a DIY so I'm trying not to go to a tech center.
Can this be done?
do I need two computers to accomplish this?
