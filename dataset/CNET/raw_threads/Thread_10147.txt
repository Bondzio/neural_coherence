I have a GeForce FX 5500 video card that fit in my old motherboard's AGP slot. Now my new motherboard doesn't have a AGP slot only, PCI and PCI Express. The problem is that the FX5500 doesn't physically fit into the PCI slots, it's too long. I planning on buying a new video card for the new motherboard, but how will I know what card will physically fit into the slots?
