I first noticed a popping sound coming from the DAC hardware box when the silent loading screens initiated in SpecOps: The Line. I later noticed popping in the speakers during movie playback and during the first few notes of any song in Winamp. Progression and location of events; works box is popping while plugged into real USB port &gt; plug into externally AC powered USB hob and works fine. starts popping a month later. &gt; plug into front usb ports and second hub, notice sound is louder and no pops. Anyone have any clue as to the likely cause? Static in the motherboard? Underpowered/overpowered USB ports? Drivers?

I've heard numerous people make similar complaints about static and popping with the TubeMagic but nobody seems to have found the culprit. I think I've localized the problem to motherboard static, USB power surges or voltage under supply, and/or drivers. I'd sincerely appreciate any guesses as how plausible any of these possible causes are for static and popping through the speakers alongside a &quot;popping&quot; from the DAC. Two types of &quot;pops&quot; sound from the actual hardware. One sounds like a jittering buzz I associate with static. The other is a &quot;clicking&quot; sound identical to that made by a XonarSTX on start up or when switching modes. I'm not worried about this second type, as I understand that is the sound of transistors powering up.

I'm confident you're right that it's a hardware malfunction but I'm trending toward thinking the problem is due to a design defect. One more question, are you familiar enough with hardware to make a suggestion on what might cause the hardware to emit a static buzz at times? I'm more interested in finding a cause than a solution (solution being: as you suggest, returning a poorly designed device).

I get those USB DAC things for 2 to 3 bucks to my mailbox to sub in for failed onboard audio. So when I get a bum one I give it to a buddy that seems to want to try to fix everything. Bob

Audio bounds, but solutions are sometimes build-in to better handle them. Seeing some DAC devices handling low voltages, etc. and then the make-up of the components, you wonder if it can handle as they are easily over-whelmed it seems to me at times. Just the plain fact, you get a pop is not unheard of as being-ON just got an unwanted audio response. Just cranking up the audio may cause a &quot;hum&quot; from speakers in just about any audio system. So, you get what you pay for, IMHO. tada -----Willy

I did buy an entry level audiophile DAC and I do sense that the produce is being &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by electrical signals as Willy comments. I couldn't figure out how to close the thread after Bob's last response which I found satisfactory.

I found the DAC lines into the card to be hanging near the power for a DVD drive. After wrapping and grounding foil over the digital lines and dressing the power lines from the PS solved the popping and clicks and even reduced some hum.
