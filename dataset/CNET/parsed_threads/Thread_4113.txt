<s> I've looked high and low searching to see if the on board video card (Intel 82915G/GV/919GL)in my HP with XP will support 1440 X 900 resolution. </s>
<s> It does not appear in the display settings so does that mean it won't? </s>
<s> I've looked both at Intel's site and at Samsung's site for info but found nothing. </s>
<s> I also searched here and didn't find a direct answer. </s>
<s> Any info would be great, thanks. </s>
<s> http://support.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-022544.htm notes the basic supported modes. </s>
<s> It also notes what to do about getting the latest drivers. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
