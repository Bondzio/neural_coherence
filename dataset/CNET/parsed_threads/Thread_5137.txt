<s> I am going to set up RAID 0 with my laptop, since it supports a second hard drive. </s>
<s> I am deciding between these setups: 2 160GB hard drives at 5400 RPM for $215 2 100GB hard drives at 7200 RPM for $150 (already own first one) The good thing about the 160GB option is that I could use the old 100 GB drive for backup, and get an enclosure for it. </s>
<s> What's making this decision difficult is the drive speeds. </s>
<s> RAID 0 will speed things up, but will 5400 RPM be enough for games like Team Fortress 2? </s>
<s> Running Vista Home Premium, too. </s>
<s> Greatly appreciate the help, Brian </s>
<s> I just received a 750GB SATA 7200RPM drive today for 103 bucks. </s>
<s> see http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=WD7500AACS-R&cat=HDD For your one drive I could have 2 750's vs. your pair of 160GB drives. </s>
<s> Why is your price so far out of line? </s>

<s> Prices are what they are where they are. </s>
<s> But if game performance is an issue don't look to hard disk speeds to get a boost. </s>
<s> That only helps on the initial load time and no where else. </s>
<s> Hope this is clear enough. </s>

<s> RAM and better video chipsets. </s>

<s> The price for getting a second 100 GB 7200 RPM hard drive won't change, since I have to get the same exact drive. </s>
<s> For the 160 GB drives, I think I'm stuck there too, since I don't think you can buy the special secondary hard drive bracket that replaces a cd drive. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help! </s>
<s> I will quit thinking about RPM speed, and focus on how much memory I want. </s>
