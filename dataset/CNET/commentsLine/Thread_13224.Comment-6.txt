the problem with lightning is the problem(s) could be anything.
once, you figure it out, something else could go in short order or make the fix fail quickly.
i find that replacing the psu is about the quickest and safest bet to attempt a repair on first try.
i suggest you unplug ac for about a min.
then replug and retry.
if it works, great, if not then remove ac again and allow it be left alone for 30min.
unplugged.
retry again a fter that, otherwise if it fails again, test *all* componets one at a time elsewhere.
basically, the mtrbd.
or psu usually are the cuprits in such cases.
take my advise and ''do not take anything for granted, test it''.
fyi - lightning hits my area often and 6/21 last night hit my p/u truck(pretty sure).
it works but is acting strange, so lightning does weird effects.
oh yeah, i unplugged my system.
further more, i use several surge protector and line conditioner to quelch such hits and surges.
you should look into that as well once your system is up and running.
good luck tada -----willy
