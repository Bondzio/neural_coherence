I am trying to find out if there is a way to amplify a wireless signal if I don't have access to the router. I live just off campus and I am trying to increase the signal of the college to have dependable internet. I currently receive a very weak signal or no signal at all. I do have permission to access the network. Is there anything I can do to boost the signal? Thanks
