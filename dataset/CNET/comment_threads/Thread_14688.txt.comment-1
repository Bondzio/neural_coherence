Greetings, I have a Mac G4 Quicksilver 2001 Dual 800... All information I have says that a Ati Radeon 9600 Pro Graphics Display Card (256mb) will work with this machine provided that the card pins #3 and #11 are disabled (taping over these pins)...
I have done this, and still, the machine will not boot with this card installed...What else can be done??
?...Thanks !!
!
