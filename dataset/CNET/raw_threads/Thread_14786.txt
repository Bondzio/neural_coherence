And the Voodoo 2000 was the one I remember because of it's skill at some emulator game. So it outclassed the others for that app. That doesn't mean much but shows that the app you want to use could have the cards swapping positions more often than a herd of cats. All are pre-historic compared to today's cheapest card so try it from the newest to the oldest as you do your speed tests. Bob
