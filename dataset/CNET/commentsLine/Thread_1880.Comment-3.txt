this might simply be what is called a &quot;sympathetic&quot; vibration which is a chassis noise that comes and goes as it is vibrated by a motor from a fan or drive.
it could also be a &quot;harmonic&quot; created by the difference in frequency of two motors (again fans/drives) that becomes a third noise when these other frequencies &quot;beat&quot; against each other.
you need to disconnect one motor device (except for the cpu fan) at a time to see if it goes away.
that it happens after about 15 minutes might have something to do with things warming up and reaching full speed.
good luck.
