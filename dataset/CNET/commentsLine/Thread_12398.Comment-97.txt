hi all, i bought my phaser 8560dn at costco when they had a sale back in june.
anyway, this week is the last week i can return the printer and i finally noticed the flaking that people are talking about.
i noticed it on bazzill bling textured paper.
when i made wedding invitations i was using a pearlescent metallic paper that it printed beautifully on.
i also noticed that when i selected transparency a warning message pops up stating that i should only use xerox brand and any other brand might damage the printer?
has anyone tried other transparencies?
how about printing pictures on glossy?
are the pics decent?
lastly, is anyone returning their phaser?
unfortunately, this printer was priced at already the max that i was willing to pay right now.
so, i probably won't be replacing it anytime soon if i return it.
