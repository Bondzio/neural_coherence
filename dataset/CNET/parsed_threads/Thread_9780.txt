<s> I have a Kingston Data Traveler 4gb. </s>
<s> The head snapped off. </s>
<s> Is there any way to recover the info on there? </s>
<s> http://superuser.com/questions/83540/repair-snapped-usb-flash-drive shows the usual picture of what's inside. </s>
<s> We take that to the bench and solder on another cable or connector for that last time use to get the files out. </s>
<s> http://www.drivesavers.com also does this if you don't. </s>

<s> I do not have the equipment but I will take it to a location that does. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> i called drivesavers and they quoted $500-$1200 to repair. </s>
<s> seems really high. </s>
<s> They go beyond the simple repair I noted. </s>
<s> They can even remove the flash memory chip and put it on another board. </s>
<s> Then if there is file system damage they can recover that too. </s>
<s> When you can't lose it, they are to go to people. </s>
<s> The highest price we paid was about 24,000 for recovering Novell drives. </s>
<s> Long story about an IT that believed that RAID meant that backup was not necessary since RAID could recover from drive loss. </s>
<s> Backup copies are always cheaper. </s>
