My computer (Pentium IV 3ghz 512 RAM with 400 watts power supply, Windows XP) suddenly shuts down and lost electrical power while working or while browsing thru the internet and even while I've just started the computer.
The computer is connected directly to the wall socket thru an extension cord.
I'm not using an AVR (automatic voltage regulator).
My guess is that sometimes the computer cannot take the voltage comming in, that is why it is cutting off the electricity to protect the computer.
Does buying an AVR solves the problem?
