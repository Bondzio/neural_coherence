I am having trouble finding the netbook I want.
I want the 1001, but i CANNOT find this model with windows xp AND 11hr battery life.
I even found a website that sells the model with XP and 6 cell but claims its only 5 hour battery life, but all other sites claim its 3 cell with 4.5 to 3 hr battery life.
Why do I have to sacrifice 7 to 8 hours battery life to have XP, besides wouldnt u get even more battery life with XP running and the battery that comes with windows 7 version?
