<s> I don't have any kind of technical background with computers, so your help is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I am getting into video editing and just got PowerDirector 9. </s>
<s> Our current laptops could run it, but I would rather use a beefier machine that can handle it with ease. </s>
<s> In addition to that, the computer would mostly be used for simple internet browsing and Microsoft Office 2010/beyond. </s>
<s> We would like to store all of our photos on there as well. </s>
<s> Without any true computing knowledge, I do not know how much computer I really need. </s>
<s> I would like to keep the total package under $1,000. </s>
<s> Any guidance, assistance, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I can post additional information if it is needed. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> for video editing you will need a computer with a lot of memory, at least 500GB (I would recommend a 1TB {TerraByte} hard drive). </s>
<s> A fast processor (a 2ghz+ at the minimum), graphics card, optical drive with write capability and some expansion slots for future upgrades. </s>
<s> You CAN get one for under $1,000 but you will find that quality desktops capable of editing large movies will run over your budget. </s>
<s> You don't have much computing expierience...are you comfortable attempting digital editing? </s>
<s> As for the digital editing, the program I got is called Power Director 9... it had very good reviews and the demo was easy to use. </s>
<s> I am pretty good with user-friendly software, just not tech specs. </s>
<s> To be honest, most of this editing will just be photos and not actual video... </s>
<s> I would be creating DVD slideshows set to music with some graphical overlays and/or transitions, but I don't plan on much beyond that. </s>
<s> What kind of processor does that put me in? </s>
<s> 2ghz+ makes sense, but what I struggle with is Intel vs. Athlon vs....? </s>
<s> I just don't know. </s>
<s> I was thinking probably 1TB of memory, so that sounds good. </s>
<s> Other specs though? </s>
<s> Are there any particular brands I should or shouldn't check out? </s>
<s> I know this is subjective, but I have no frame of reference and need input. </s>
<s> Thanks so much for the response! </s>
<s> Hi Ray, Well I must be honest I am not too familiar with editing software so I am going to give you some general advice that should help you. </s>
<s> Since you are creating DVD slide shows you will need an optical drive with writable capability. </s>
<s> If you can afford it you should get one that will write to both standard DVD's and Blu-ray. </s>
<s> This will allow you to produce DVD's for a wider variety of players (important if your selling these). </s>
<s> Also look for a term called LightScribe. </s>
<s> LightScribe is a method of burning data into DVDs. </s>
<s> It also allows you to &quot;print&quot; artwork directly onto a dvd vs having to print out a label and sticking it onto the dvd later. </s>
<s> This is what the pros use and it will give your DVD's a more professional quality. </s>
<s> It doesn't add much more to the cost anyway. </s>
<s> Processors are a different matter. </s>
<s> You want the best processor you can afford. </s>
<s> Both Intel and Atheon make good processors. </s>
<s> I would recommend no less than an Intel i5 Core processor as your minimum (or the Atheon equivelant). </s>
<s> The processor is like your computers brain and the faster the processor, the faster your computer. </s>
<s> Also make sure that your computer has the appropriate connections for whatever your using to record your pics / movies. </s>
<s> I would recommend no fewer that 4 USB ports. </s>
<s> Be nice if it came with an eSATA port but I don't think that is essential (eSATA ports are going to be the USB replacements and are much faster that the current USB ports). </s>
<s> If you will be using a camcorder take a look at the cables that came with it and make sure the computer can accomadate them. </s>
<s> If the computer comes with a graphics card it should be able to. </s>
<s> Make sure you have a graphics card. </s>
<s> I will be honest, you will have to trust the salesman on this as I don't know too much about graphics cards. </s>
<s> Again you will need to get the best you can afford as that will make your editing easier. </s>
<s> As far as computer brands go almost all of the major brands are good. </s>
<s> I don't know too much about the Systemax brand other than they sell for cheap. </s>
<s> I would stay away from them. </s>
<s> Dell, Lenovo / IBM, apple, HP, etc. </s>
<s> are all good. </s>
<s> I will say that everyone I know that works in video /photography has strongly recommended apple and they use apple computers for their editing. </s>
<s> Might look into those but they will be expensive. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Thank you again for your response. </s>
<s> That gives me a good place to start. </s>
<s> I don't plan on selling an DVD's (though that could be a good business opportunity! </s>
<s> ); it is more for family/friend purposes. </s>
<s> I will be making the slideshow for my upcoming wedding with the software, and may do the same for other friends getting married soon. </s>
<s> I'm at the age where our families start to grow, too, so I'm sure I can use the software to chronicle those memories as well. </s>
<s> If a business springs out of it, great! </s>
<s> I did consider Apple, but I really want to stick with a PC. </s>
<s> I can't stand using Microsoft Office on a Mac... and I will be using that fairly frequently as well. </s>
<s> I think the software I have will be more than adequate for my purposes and should be fine on the PC. </s>
<s> Thanks for that suggestion though. </s>
<s> Again, thank you for the input and I will get to looking around. </s>
<s> Much appreciated! </s>
