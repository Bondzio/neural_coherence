That's probably a good secondary objective, touchy-feely netbooks.
And to be honest, 75% of what I REALLY do can be performed on a netbook.
But we know the REAL reason for Win7 --- maybe everyone will forget about Vista.
And just my luck.
I was one of the boobs that bought a PC when WindowsMe was launched too, and I went and did the same thing with Vista.
You would think I would have learned my lesson by now.
