<s> My hp1170c has been a great printer, but it is no longer working---simply worn out. </s>
<s> At any rate, I will be discarding it and would like to know if it has a permanent memory storage that should be removed for security reasons before discarding. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any information that you can provide! </s>

<s> There is buffer memory just used as temporary storage while printing. </s>
<s> It's reset when power goes off. </s>
<s> I suspected that might be the case, but wanted to make sure. </s>
<s> Appreciate your response. </s>
