I have a wireless network set up (D-Link), with a hard-connected PC and my son's Gateway laptop. Everything was working fine when I left, and my laptop worked fine at the hotels and airport yesterday. Now it won't connect, although the pc and my son's laptop are having no problems. I paid for the airport wireless connection yesterday - could that have reset or screwed something up in my settings? I've tried everything I can think of and am at my wit's end. On the task bar, it says I have an excellent connection, but when I open the wireless networks, it says &quot;not connected&quot;. I've tried the Windows &quot;repair&quot; button, but it says it can't connect. Any suggestions greatly appreciated!!! --Deborah

When I go into IBM Access Connections/Connection Status, it says &quot;IP Adress Not Assigned&quot;. Shouldn't there be one there and if so, how do I get it? Also under Diagnostic Tools, the IP Address shows as 0.0.0.0. I am obviously not an expert on this . Just enough knowledge to be dangerous.

On the tab at the top, click the ine that says &quot;Wireless Networks&quot; and check the box that says &quot;Use windows...&quot; If there is a native router on it click on it to select and this should at least help you connect. If that doesnt work then using a thumb drive you can copy the network settings from the wireless laptop that works and then using it on your laptop. Hope this helps
