Take Ron's advice and slow that burner down a little.
If you're burning at 32x with 256 mb ram, you should be getting buffer underruns.
You can burn a full cd in about 4 minutes at 24x, how fast is fast?
Why do you think the manufacturers stopped with the 52x burners?
It's because most computers aren't capable of running the drive that fast anyway.
The technology is ahead of it's time.
You also should be seeing the led on the front of the burner going out from time to time during a burn.
That's so the computer can catch up to the burner, because the burner is running too fast.
So unless you just happen to need more coasters, slow it down to 24x or even 12x or 16x.
