I have what you would call, a spikey ping in the game i play, f.e.a.r. multiplayer, and my ping jumps all over the place. It is never the same or close to the same ping for atleast 3 seconds. For example, the initial ping is 32. My ping will be 38, 29, 42, 23, 54. I have a cable connection and windows vista 64 bit. Anyone know how I can make my ping steady?
