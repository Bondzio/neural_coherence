They wanted to keep the old HD because of the pictures &amp; documents. So my question is how can I go about hooking up thier old HD for them to get what they need off it and transfer the documents and pictures.

Be sure to get the right size (2.5&quot; or 3.5&quot; and type (IDE or SATA). Put the drive in the enclosure and plug it into a USB slot. Windows will recognize it and assign it a drive letter where you can access it with Computer (aka Windows Explorer). Good luck.
