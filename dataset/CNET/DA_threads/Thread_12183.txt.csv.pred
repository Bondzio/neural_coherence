1.1.1	Hi , I was about to purchase 2 seagate 300GB hard drives ( seagate as they have 5 yr warranty ) with the intention of setting up a simple raid so that my data is mirrored across both drives , hence 2 copies of the same data , I believe its called RAID 1 , ofcourse I want the RAID purely for backup reasons .	St
1.1.2	I was all ready to go however a friend of mine told me that if my motherboard was to give up the ghost I would lose all my data unless i find the exact same motherboard and plug the hard drives in , this worried me as the whole point of setting up a RAID is to have data protection , my thought was there is nothing fancy going on , just a simple copy of data will exist on both hard drives , I mean I thought even if I take both hard drives and put it in a totally different machine I Can setup RAID 1 mirroring again if needs be and it wouldnt be a problem .	St
1.1.3	My motherboard is the Abit KN8 series with the Nforce4 chipset , I think the RAID utility built into the motherboard is by Nvidia but not 100 % sure on that .	St
1.1.4	Any help or answers will be very much appreciated as I 'm very confused !	St
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	That it 's not a viable backup system .	St
1.2.2	For years I 've seen this one as owners scream as the virus duplicates on both drives or wipes both drives at the same time .	St
1.2.3	If the OS makes a mistake , then it 's dutifully copied to the mirror .	St
1.2.4	No sale here .	St
1.2.5	I wo n't write how the delete key figures into this one .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	you 've brought up some interesting points , I 'm not TOO worried about viruses as I havent had one for over 2 years now , but I guess it is something to consider .	St
1.3.2	the OS will be on a seperate drive so in regard to the OS making a mistake , it should lower the chances a bit .	St
1.3.3	As for delete theres always recycle bin ( there will be very little access if any from the network ) .	St
1.3.4	After a little research there is backup software available such as retrospect , so I might just take that route with scheduled backups twice a week or something .	St
1.3.5	If you were in my position Bob what would you do ? , I really dont want to go towards removable media like DVD 's , hard disks are much more conveniant and with the 5 year warranty even if it only lasts 5 years I am happy .	St
1.3.6	I will have to do a bit more thinking , I might just have to go towards using software like retrospect .	St
1.3.7	Thx again	St
1.4.1	2 drives and a simple copy from one to the other on a 7 day rotation .	St
1.4.2	This gives me 6 or 7 days till a file I deleted is long gone .	St
1.4.3	I do n't bother with backup of the OS , programs or such .	St
1.4.4	You can determine your needs and make a plan you can live with .	Sug
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	That might be the best way then , one final question , what application do you use ? , I need an application which is reliable you see , after some reading up retrospect seems ok but would like to hear about what you use .	St
1.6.1	A simple batch file that fires off each day .	St
1.6.2	We used to use PKZIP to compress but with NTFS compression switched on , we dropped that .	St
1.6.3	All native tools .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thanks for all the advice , appreciated Will place the order today .	St
