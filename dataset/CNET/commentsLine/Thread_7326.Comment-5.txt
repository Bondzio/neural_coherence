since i can't chance it, i always look.
since we're inside the case every 6 months to keep it clean, it's just another thing to read while we're inside.
as to the case size, it wasn't clear to me so you can take measurements to see if a full size card fits and if there is a heat issue you can always cut a big hole in the case or leave a cover off.
