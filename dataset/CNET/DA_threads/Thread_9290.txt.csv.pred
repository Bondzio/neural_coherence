1.1.1	Been getting this error message for a while now - at first I put it down to dirty or scratched cd 's , however I now notice that it is also giving the same response to my e drive ( both asus drives , one dvd rom , one cd rw ) and also to my floppy a drive .	St
1.1.2	To my knowlede the only recent update to my computer is the upgrading to the latest Norton Systemworks .	St
1.1.3	Very annoying so any help will be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.4	Col .	St
1.2.1	O/S - Windows XP Home ( original installation , not upgrade from previous version ) Tried removing the driver and forcing an update but still got the problem - though this did fix it long enough for me to run a cleaning disk on the drive .	St
1.2.2	tried different types of disk as well and no format is recognised , ( cd cdr cdrw and audio cd )	St
1.3.1	Run the anti-bug suite courtesy of R Proffitt : http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html ? forumID=32 & threadID=1313 & start=0	St
1.4.1	ok , carried out all of the above but to no avail I 'm affraid - although ad-aware finds 54 items but then crashes b4 it does anything about them .	St
1.4.2	gon na keep trying with that one after clearing the quarantine in spybot and see if that helps , but in the mean time any other suggestions would be appreciated .	St
1.4.3	Thanks Col .	St
1.5.1	Did n't get round to delting the quarantine in spybot - all of a sudden the computer started to recognise the drives again without me doing anything extra .	St
1.5.2	I did try to roll back with system restore but got an error on that as soon as I opened it telling me that it could not protect my computer and to restart .	St
1.5.3	It seemed to be after this restart that it all worked again .	St
1.5.4	Very Odd ! ! !	St
1.5.5	!	St
1.6.1	.	St
1.7.1	For anybody else who develops this strange bug - which , by the way , returned .	St
1.7.2	Look at what you have recently installed - I totally forgot I had installed Microsoft Publisher , it was this program which caused the bug - delete the program - fix the bug .	St
1.7.3	Only problem now is - I want the program - Oh well - such is life ! ! !	St
1.7.4	!	St
1.8.1	You sure the software/application is n't looking for media in that drive ?	Ques
1.8.2	Check what defaults you have set for publisher .	St
1.8.3	Options / general .	St
1.8.4	Just a thought .	St
1.9.1	PRoblem returned , seems it wasnt microsoft publisher aftrer all .	St
1.9.2	The real reason , after much searching has turned out to be Norton systemworks 2004 ! ! ! !	St
1.9.3	apparently it has issues with any version of nero burning rom earlier than nero 6. as I only 5.5.9 this causes a conflict .	St
1.9.4	Removed systemworks and no longer have the problem .	St
1.9.5	If you also have this problem then either upgrade to nero 6 or remove systemworks .	St
1.9.6	Apparently no one is getting a response from the manufacturers of norton who are burying their heads in the proverbial sand on this problem with their software .	St
1.9.7	Hope this helps anybody else with this issue and btw - cheapest place I have found for nero 6 is e-bay , worth a try .	St
1.10.1	After 5 versions ( 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , and now 2004 ) , the only reason I see for it is a cheap way to get NAV ( which looks like a misfire in 2004 ) and Disk Doctor .	St
1.10.2	The rest can be done without .	St
1.10.3	Reference http : //service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/nunt.nsf/docid/2000120915010309 & src=n The same bug continues on in most if not all versions .	St
1.11.1	Symptoms are as following : You get a message A : \ is not Accessible Incorrect function when accessing the floppy drive and D : \ is not Accessible Incorrect function when accessing the CD Drives in Windows XP .	St
1.11.2	If you boot with a floppy all hardware works great .	St
1.11.3	If you boot XP with a CD in the drive you are able to read that CD .	St
1.11.4	The problem seems to be with Nero Burning ROM .	St
1.11.5	( System also has Norton System Works 2004 on it . )	St
1.11.6	I uninstalled the older OEM version of Nero and installed the newer OEM version 5.5.10.53 and everything works great !	St
1.11.7	I really hope this helps someone as it took me a while to figure out what was going on .	St
1.11.8	Good Luck !	St
