did you mean to write that you have an hp paviliona a1410n and not an ''a1410a'' ?
your sata hd should still be the boot drive, meaning that the windows is installed on that drive.
when you install a second drive, the bios will look on the designated boot drive for windows.
sometimes, when you install a second hd, the bios automatically will consider the second hd the primary boot drive and look for windows there.
if it doesn't have windows installed on it, then your computer will not boot windows.
entering the bios is pretty easy.
you must do this to confirm that your bios settings have the correct drive designated as the boot drive (primary boot volume).
