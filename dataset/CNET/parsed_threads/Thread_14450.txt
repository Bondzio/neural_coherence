<s> A piece was broken of a 9800 pro. </s>
<s> The piece is a spool of wire i took a picture of location of where the spool should be. </s>
<s> If you know what the item is and/or how to fix it that would be great There were numbers on the spool: 2.2 FALCO 0418 Pictures of video card http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk96/Igrac_videocard/IMG_9890.jpg http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk96/Igrac_videocard/IMG_9892.jpg </s>
<s> It does not look broken. </s>
<s> It looks like any decent tech with a solder iron and about 2 cents of solder could solder it back on for you. </s>
<s> The GOOD NEWS part 2 is that this coil is not polarized so even if they put it in backwarks it should be fine. </s>
