1.1.1	Hi I am going to purchase a new desktop to replace current six-year-old Dell Dimension 8250 .	St
1.1.2	I am a senior and this will probably be my last comuter .	St
1.1.3	I am only a general user but want the most & quot ; bang for the buck & quot ; PC .	St
1.1.4	I am strongly considering an Acer Aspire X3200-ED5600A or Acer Aspire X1700-U3700A ( I think these are almost the same machine but believe I can purchase the 3200 a little cheaper-it looks as though the major differences are the Graphics Controllers : the 3200 uses the NVIDIAGeForce8200 and the 1700 uses the NVIDIA GeForce G100 and the Processors : the 3200 uses AMD Athlon X2 5600+ 2.9 GHz dual core and the 1700 uses the Intel Pentium Dual Core E5200 2.4 GHz Any significant differences ?	Ques
1.1.5	Common Components Storage Controller : Serial ATA-300 Op .	St
1.1.6	Storage : DVD RW/DVD-RAM Ram : 4 GB DDR2 SDRAM Cache Mem .	St
1.1.7	: 1 MB L2 Cache Small Form Factor OS : Vista Home Premium 64 bit Hard Drive : 640 GB Audio Output : 5.1 channel surround The 3200 would cost about $ 415 online with free shipping and the 1700 would cost about $ 480 Thoughts on Acer/configuration ?	Ques
1.1.8	The compact space of these is a factor and I do not upgrade components so the lack of upgradeability is not a factor .	St
1.1.9	Regards Ronhawk	St
1.2.1	Recommendation still same..SFF is a poor choice for system longevity and reliability .	St
1.2.2	Too much heat in too small a space and not many ways to efficiently eliminate it .	St
1.2.3	SFF severely limits HW options ... HS Fans , GPUs , PSUs , etc. , in the event of component failure beyond warranty .	St
1.2.4	VAPCMD PS ... I 'm not far behind you age wise but would n't consider SFF unless I needed portability .	St
1.2.5	The smallest I buy for anything is a mid tower with plenty of drives bays for drive spacing/separation , cooling and ease of access in the event I need to repair or replace a component .	St
1.3.1	VAPCD The first post was probably not in the most appropriate catgegory and since I did n't know how to transfer it to this category I re-posted it .	St
1.3.2	I do like the idea of the tower sitting on top of the desk instead of underneath it but can see your point in minimizing potential problems .	St
1.3.3	Can you give me some examples of mid-towers to get me started ?	Ques
1.3.4	I did see a full-size desktop that seemed to have everything I would want-Gateway DX 4720-03 , NVIDIA GeForce7100 , DVDRW/DVD-RAM w/Labelflash , 4GB RAM ( 8GB max ) DDR2-800MHz PC2-6400 , Vista Home Premium 64 bit , Pen .	St
1.3.5	Dual Core E5200 2.5 GHz , 640 HDD , Fax/Modem-56Kbps , 7.1 channel surround .	St
1.3.6	Opinion ?	Ques
1.3.7	Dell is also having some good prices on their budget pc 's .	St
