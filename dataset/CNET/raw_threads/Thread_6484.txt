I believe the motherboard crashed and it seems that in many forums states that Emachines tend to blow the mobo quick. I would like to stick to XP and it seems that my only way is to go online. I am not a gamer only a budget minded user. Any site suggestions? I would like to build a pc one day but just not right now. My only concern is that will I be able to recover my old system drive if i use it as a slave on the new pc? Any help thanks. Gene

Plug the old drive into the new PC as a slave and access it through Explorer. Unless the drive is fried, all your data will be there. Just drag and drop. But you cannot move installed programs.
