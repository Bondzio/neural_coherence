<s> I own a emachine W3107 AMD Sempron processor 3100+ IE 7 Windows XP 32b 1.80 Ghz,1600 Mhz,256 KB L2 Cache,512 DDR-SDRAM,With a DSL modem I've been looking at an add on dual core processor upgrade.The cost is $75.00 Are these add on processors good,bad or otherwise. </s>
<s> The machine I found does not support dual core CPUs. </s>
<s> You'll have to supply a link to the product for me to change my mind. </s>
<s> Support emachine link: http://www.e4me.com/support/product_support.html?cat=Desktops&subcat=W-Series&model=W3107 It doesn't show info on a dual-core upgrade. </s>
<s> Follow the upgrade link and see if it does, but I thought it. </s>
<s> As an AMD cpu and socket provided. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy &quot;0 </s>
<s> I found it the other day on Amazon.com.The ad said turn your single core computer into a dual core computer.Handle twice the workload.It's half the size of a normal processor. </s>
<s> I can only *assume* you're talking about a &quot;overdrive kit&quot; type of thing. </s>
<s> I don't recall such an item, it's probably cheaper(maybe) to get a new mtrbd. </s>
<s> that truly supports dual-core cpu and go from there. </s>
<s> That way, you'll have a greater range of upgrades as its needed. </s>
<s> If you can provide that Amazon link, review it again and match it against your current system specs. </s>
<s> Otherwise, its a dead-end for dual path, only a single core will do. </s>
<s> Using the link I provided in the last, find the upgrade link and post a question to eMachine support and see what they may suggest. </s>
<s> Heck, it doesn't hurt to ask. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Just go to amazon and write in processors.They should come right up. </s>
<s> You can't put in another processor and hope it will work. </s>
<s> Please be very specific as to what kit you are looking at. </s>
<s> That is, a link. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Send me an adress and i'll send you the paga. </s>
<s> Then all can comment. </s>
