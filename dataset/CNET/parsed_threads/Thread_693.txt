<s> I recently read about this Tablet PC by Wipro called e.go so I checked out its website @ www.egobywipro.com as well. </s>
<s> And it looks amazing. </s>
<s> The screen rotates 180degrees, the colour is really nice and it has a stylus as well. </s>
<s> But what I want to know is - Is it a good laptop for a young business professional? </s>
<s> And how much is it for? </s>
<s> Any information on this laptop would be really helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The initial reviews and hands on use are coming up short. </s>
<s> While I'm sure there is a market for tablet PCs that market has been attempted some dozen times with too many dead bodies of company to say that it's finally here. </s>
<s> Initial reviews often write &quot;clunky&quot; when you see Windows Icon Mouse Pointer (WIMP) interfaces. </s>
<s> For tablets it's different enough that you don't want WIMP. </s>
