<s> Earlier tonight it was raining by my house so I turned off my PC after there was a short power outage. </s>
<s> A few minutes ago my dad came over to use and turned it on and it wouldn't work. </s>
<s> The boot screen showed up and it asked me if I wanted to start up the desktop normally or in safe mode. </s>
<s> Thinking nothing was wrong, I chose normal and then to my surprise, after the boot screen showed up, the monitor went blank. </s>
<s> I then tried turning it off by pressing the Power button, but it wouldn't so I had to unplug the power from the back. </s>
<s> I started it over and started it in Safe Mode which worked. </s>
<s> I'm going to try reinstalling Windows, but before I do that I wanted advice from you guys. </s>
<s> As for system info, I've got a Gateway 504GR with WinXP Home edition with integrated gfx (for those who think it might be my gfx card). </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> All right guys, I managed to &quot;fix&quot; it. </s>
<s> While in safe mode I just restored it to a time before the storm (7pm). </s>
<s> I still would like to know what might have caused my PC to act up like this though. </s>
<s> ...somewhere, and indicated by when the computer did work. </s>
<s> A rule of thumb is : If the computer works in &quot;Safe mode&quot; and not in &quot;Normal&quot;, you have corrupted drivers, or missing files. </s>
<s> &quot;Safe mode&quot; loads a minimum of these to get basic functionality going, to help you return the system to working order. </s>
<s> If &quot;Normal&quot; mode fails when you've had a power cut, your PC has almost certainly lost a driver. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Well powering off, whether by accident or otherwise isn't an instant usually an instant death to hardware. </s>
<s> Computers reset and Operating Systems crash all the time, without worry, so a power outage isn't any more dangerous. </s>
<s> However, an immediate power loss can corrupt a system file or driver. </s>
<s> Because these are loaded and in use, they are sometimes in a continual state of flux, and shutting down unduly springs a special surprise on them! </s>
<s> They are then effectively corrupted as they weren't returned to a default ready status by a correct shut down sequence. </s>
<s> This is a simplistic explanation, and it doesn't happen, but when it does...Safe Mode's always the first route to recovery. </s>
<s> GB. </s>
