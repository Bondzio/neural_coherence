Did you ever figure out how to connect to WIFI with the Katalyst.
We had a Belkin G router and we had the same problem.
We could call using WIFI and the person we called could hear us, but we could not hear them.
Now we got a D-Link DIR-615 and we cannot even get connected.
Now a clue as to the problem.
Its very frustrating because Samsung and T-mobile know nothing either, nor does their manual help.
