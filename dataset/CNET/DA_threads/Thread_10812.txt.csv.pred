1.1.1	This is the pc i have been putting together: p4 lga775 540j 3.2ghz GA-8I915P Duo Pro 120gb sata hd (i have not bought any ram yet but i know what i will buy.)	St
1.1.2	The main issue is which graphics card i will buy, i play alot of games and i am looking to purchase a card most suited to my needs.	St
1.1.3	My monitor is capable of high resolutions so this is not an issue, as i want to play games at high detail.	St
1.1.4	I am thinking of either 6800gt, 6800 ultra or a 7800gtx.	St
1.1.5	I am also aware of the new ati line of cards just around the corner.	St
1.1.6	Is a 7800gtx over kill for my system?	St
1.1.7	I want the card to last me a fair amount of time, i may choose to upgrade cpu etc in future, but the price difference is a considerable amount between these cards.	St
1.1.8	Could a 6800 ultra cope with modern games at highest settings?	St
1.1.9	Any thoughts or help on this would be gratefully accepted.	Polite
1.2.1	What power supply are you using?	Polite
1.2.2	The Nvidia 7 series cards require a minimum 400W psu.	St
1.2.3	Also, take alook at the 7800GT for more performance than a 6800 Ultra but cheaper than the GTX.	St
1.2.4	These cards do not come in AGP, only PCI Express.	St
1.2.5	The 7 series can handle any game out there as of right now.	St
1.3.1	i have a 525w hiper psu, do u think it is wise to wait for the ati offering, i am willing to pay for 7800gtx, but as it is a lot of money i want to be sure	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
