who installed windows 7?
home users usually are (blissfully) unaware that we can't install windows without hunting for the install plan for this machine.
i do not have the install plan for this machine (dell or alienware has it) but here's my generic install plan with added note for windows xp.
1. install the os.
2. install the motherboard chipset driver.
3. if xp and required install msuaa (see google) 4. install the audio driver.
5. install the video driver.
6. install lan, wifi drivers.
7. if a dell, may required the quickset software.
8. install protection suite.
