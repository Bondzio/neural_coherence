One reason I posted as I found newer mtrbds.
and/or other components showing cap damage.
Though, in some it wasn't apparent, a real close look resulted in a tipped or distended leaning.
Yes, I have taken apart PSUs and checked them for similar damage.
Some are so bad, BUT they still worked at least intermittently.
Of course, others are &quot;smoke generators&quot;.
