XP and in general all 32 bit OSes limit the memory space from 2.1 to about 3.5GB.
At no time has any of the 32 bit OSes given access to the full 4GB RAM.
I noted the 2.0GB limit per app and about the only way around that and keep a 32 bit OS is to install some &quot;HYPERVISOR&quot; and run multiple instances of Windows XP.
--&gt; What a mess.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor I guess we could do that.
