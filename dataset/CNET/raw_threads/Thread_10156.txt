CNET had a very helpful page, with info by someone named Jon Jacobi, covering everything about cd-r's and reviewing brands. Unfortunately, clicking on the links just gives you a &quot;can't find the page&quot; response. I'm not computer savvy and I just need someone who can direct me to the right page on CNET (why is that so hard to find? - rhetorical question.). Can anyone help? Mike Suarez

We'll look the Verbatims, if these fail us. (Though I don't know what &quot;Lightscribe&quot; is. But don't feel the need to educate me; that could be a frustrating exercise ). Thanks, again.
