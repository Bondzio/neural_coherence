<s> I need a better way to backup the 4 computers in my office. </s>
<s> 3 of them run WinXP and 1 runs Win98 (it's used for scanning & fax receiving). </s>
<s> They are networked peer to peer through a LinkSys 4 port router. </s>
<s> I currently use CD's to backup the data only (not the programs). </s>
<s> I am hoping for something that duplicates the hard drive so if a computer died or internal hard drive failed I could transfer the contents to a new computer or hard drive without having to reinstall all of the original software then restore data. </s>
<s> I am intrigued by the Maxtor One Touch II because of its simplicity and also by the fact that I can unplug it to isolate it from lightning strikes, etc. </s>
<s> However, it's a little pricey to buy 4 of them, especially when I have less than 100MB of data on all 4 computers combined. </s>
<s> I am not a techie but I would imagine it would need a separate partition for each computer. </s>
<s> Am I dreaming? </s>
<s> What would you suggest? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help offered. </s>
<s> It fails a few criteria of what &quot;backup&quot; should be. </s>
<s> Number one is a write protect. </s>
<s> There are many others that I'll let you ponder. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> It's a fast way to scoop up copies of what's on the machines. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> It's also a fast way to spread a virus... </s>
<s> Think carefully before you do this. </s>

<s> Good points, Bob. </s>
<s> I thought the One Touch II series offered some sort of write protection, but again, I'm not well-versed in technology. </s>
<s> What solution would be best to meet my &quot;wish list&quot; as outlined in my original post? </s>
<s> There have been attempts to do so in software or via file systems, but this doesn't work like the solid switch or slide on floppies (remember those) or tapes. </s>
<s> CDR/W and DVDR/W are rendered unwritable by placing such in a DVD or CD drive that can't write. </s>
<s> This area is full of solutions but no one can agree on best. </s>
<s> The usual office backup is a central server to store the files that need backup, then some tape drive to cart the data off site in case of a disaster. </s>
<s> This all starts when the person responsible writes... &quot;My business's Disaster Recovery Plan&quot;. </s>
<s> The drive you spoke of will do in a pinch, but is not &quot;backup&quot;. </s>
<s> It's a volatile copy. </s>
