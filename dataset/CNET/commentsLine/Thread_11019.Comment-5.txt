hmmm...it would be very informative to see if this phenomenon were repeated while connected to a different computer, then you could confidently rule out your computer.
the good thing is that the samsung monitors i have seen have a 3 year warranty.
i'd check into it.
a shot in the dark: 1. check monitor cable for kinks, frays, loose at jack or base of monitor.
2. check to see if there are any ati card diagnostics in catalyst or downloadable from mfg.
