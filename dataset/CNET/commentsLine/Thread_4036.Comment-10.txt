alright..... i printed a large .txt file and it came out ok (9 pages in total - no flaws).
i checked the margins and they're good.
i also tried another .jpg picture and it came out all screwed up again.
this seems to be only affecting picture files.
weird.
i think i'm going to contact compaq and if they don't have an answer, out the window the printer goes.
