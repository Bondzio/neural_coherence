I have a Maxtor OneTouch III Turbo Edition 600 GB FireWire 400/800 and USB 2.0 Hard Drive, which you can see at this site: http://www.superwarehouse.com/Maxtor_OneTouch_III_Turbo_Edition_600_GB_FireWire_400_800_and_USB_2.0_Hard_Drive/G01Y006/ps/726077 I just ordered this enclosure: Galaxy METAL GEAR Metal Gear Box 3500SAP-SESIL Aluminum 3.5&quot; Silver USB 2.0 External Enclosure - Retail http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817716016 But I don't think they are compatible.
The connectors don't seem to match, and there are two hard drives in the Maxtor, so should I have bought two enclosures or one that fits both into it?
I tried to connect one of the hard drives into the Metal Gear Box, but the white plastic connector wasn't the same as the one to the Maxtor HD.
Can anyone advise me to a compatible enclosure or tell me what I'm doing wrong?
Thanks.
