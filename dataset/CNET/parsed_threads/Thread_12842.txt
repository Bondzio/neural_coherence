<s> I just got a new Dell XPS 410 with the E6600 Processor, 2 GB RAM, Nvidia 7900GS Video Card, etc...Has anyone added another 7900GS successfully without changing the power supply? </s>
<s> What exactly is needed to run an SLI set up. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Also, would the performance increase warrant doing this upgrade? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If the model# was SLI ready, then Dell would have mentioned it was. </s>
<s> If there is no mention don't expect to become one later. </s>
<s> You need to visit the Dell support website and look up your model or S/N#, enter it and see what your order was fulfilled as. </s>
<s> Again, no SLI mentioned, not SLI ready. </s>
<s> SLI, needs extra power and the similar dual gpu cards to have SLI operation. </s>
<s> Of course the mtrbd. </s>
<s> must support all this. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info! </s>
<s> Going to check website now. </s>
<s> So far the Geforce one says my card is compatible, but need to find out if the mb and power supply are. </s>
<s> If anyone else has some experience using SLI on their XPS 410, please let me know! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> ... and what the system options/capabilities are. </s>
<s> Alternatively you cold open the box and check for PCIe slots...if there aren't two...Sli won't be an option for further consideration regardless of the PSU issue. </s>

<s> I just bought an XPS 410, and would like to replace the power supply with something better. </s>
<s> Did you end up buying a new one, and if so, which one? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> So has anyone found out if the PSU is upgradeable in the XPS410??? </s>
<s> That will be the deal breaker for me. </s>
<s> you'd have realized the XPS 410 has only one PCIe 16X slot, one PCIe 4X slot and one PCIe 1X slot. </s>
<s> All things considered, it's not what I'd call a good host or candidate for SLi. </s>
<s> The message is . </s>

<s> read before buying. </s>
<s> Much easier to read before buying and avoid the wrong purchase, than to buy and regret. </s>
<s> These docs are just too readily available and accessible to make such errors. </s>

<s> I have a dell dimension 410 and have upgraded the psu to a 500W, you have to find a dell compatible one though and they are sold through pc power and cooling (a subsidary of ocz) here http://www.pcpower.com/products/power_supplies/dell/ </s>

<s> As the machines age you will find you need a new power supply, DVDRW drive and other parts to keep it alive. </s>
