send it back.
i find the old usb 1.1 cable to be fine even at this but then again that front usb port wiring issue is why i test with rear usb ports.
as to usb 2.0 cables, i gifted all my old cables away and replaced them with the 99 cent usb 2.0 cables from geeks.com or newegg.com i see no reason to keep the old cables and any issues they harbor.
best of luck, bob
