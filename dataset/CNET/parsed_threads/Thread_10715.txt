<s> It seems bad caps are becoming a problem that is no longer one of a bad manufacturing issue. </s>
<s> At one time several yrs. </s>
<s> back, the formula for capacitors was stolen in an case of industrial espionage. </s>
<s> These so-called mis-formula made caps became over time an issue from various manufacturers of failing in all sorts of electronics. </s>
<s> When it came to PCs, which of course many caps are used, the result was a persistent rebooting or non-boot as it were though it may settle down. </s>
<s> Users may have continued this process until it fully failed to boot at all. </s>
<s> The fix was the replacement of the bad caps to include the whole bank of caps or as the repair was best suited for. </s>
<s> However, now the case is more about heat damage or stress. </s>
<s> The continuing output of heat build-up and/or lack of sufficient cooling causes the typical normally std. </s>
<s> used caps to fail over time. </s>
<s> These are usually seen as leaky or blown caps. </s>
<s> The repair still remains the same, replace. </s>
<s> However, since manufacturers are more aware of this and knowing the increased demands from users and PCs in general outputting more heat, the change to &quot;military grade&quot; caps is being used. </s>
<s> What this means is a more robust tolerance to the heat stress and overall better made cap. </s>
<s> So, if you're shopping for a mtrbd. </s>
<s> look for such as to what is now made. </s>
<s> It may become the standard as the continuing heat stress remains. </s>
<s> For now only better made mtrbds. </s>
<s> may offer this. </s>
<s> Google for bad caps to see what they look like. </s>
<s> They becoming more common than ever before: http://www.badcaps.net Shows examples for a quick link look see. </s>

<s> If you've opened a few power supplies, you may have seen some with darkened areas on the mounting boards. </s>
<s> This is when the resins turn to carbon. </s>
<s> Carbon is a conductor of electrical current. </s>
<s> Thus, it can act as another component in the circuit and change how things regulate. </s>
<s> Eventually the change to carbon cascades and causes total failure but any visible heat damage of this type to the boards is a warning of things to come. </s>
<s> One reason I posted as I found newer mtrbds. </s>
<s> and/or other components showing cap damage. </s>
<s> Though, in some it wasn't apparent, a real close look resulted in a tipped or distended leaning. </s>
<s> Yes, I have taken apart PSUs and checked them for similar damage. </s>
<s> Some are so bad, BUT they still worked at least intermittently. </s>
<s> Of course, others are &quot;smoke generators&quot;. </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I have suspected the power supply and have ordered a replacement with higher wattage. </s>
<s> Hopefully that will fix the problem. </s>
<s> I will also get out a light and magnifyer and look for bad caps. </s>
