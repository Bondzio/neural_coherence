i like it.
wish i had been daring enough to do that.
another question - would you suggest that i replace the hd, or iyho would reformatting to ntfs suffice?
suggestions on &quot;reading material&quot; on reformatting to ntfs?
i see that in &quot;my computer&quot;, if i right click on the hd and select &quot;format&quot;, there is the option to reformat to ntfs - does that reformat the same as from cmd?
whoops, guess that is more than one question.
but you'll bare with me, won't you, bob?
