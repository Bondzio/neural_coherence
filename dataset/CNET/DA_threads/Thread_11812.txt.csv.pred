1.1.1	So I was helping a friend of mine get a computer and we found this computer ( http : //www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=3231140 & CatId=2629 ) and this video card ( http : //www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=2568900 & CatId=1826 ) I know they are both PCI Express but just to make sure did I miss something , or is the card compatible with the computer ?	Ques
1.1.2	I 'm pretty sure that everything will go together , but if anything goes wrong it all gets blamed on me .	St
1.2.1	now I 'll get the blame if something goes wrong .	St
1.2.2	JUST to be on the safe side ... get a commitment from TD .	St
1.2.3	and life goes on ... Jack	St
1.3.1	Only gotcha may be on the video card needing more power than the system comes with as may be assuming a less power hungry card , I 'd think .	St
1.3.2	Regards , JB	St
