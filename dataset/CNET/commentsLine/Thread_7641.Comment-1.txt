hello, i'm looking for a good quality photo printer (5 or more colors) that will print on many types of media and up to 13x19 paper.
i've read the cnet editor recommendations, but i won't buy another epson stylus due to all the problems i've had with mine, the printer where i work, and those that my sister has experienced.
canon's i9900 looked promising until i discovered one must use only canon paper (how realistic is that!?).
i would appreciate any suggestions as i am completely without a printer now (the epson stylus 1280 i have has quit after three years of light use).
thank you for any suggestions!
