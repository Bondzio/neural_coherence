<s> MY WD external hard drive, after a re-start went to RAW file system, and I cannot format this drive anymore, I keep getting an error message &quot;windows was unable to format this drive&quot;. </s>
<s> It's a 2TB hard drive and I have about 18GB of data on it. </s>
<s> Can anyone suggest what i can do to make this drive accessible and recover my data without having to pay over $100 to geek squad? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Try the data recovery programs mentioned in http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-354911.html Might work. </s>
<s> Might not work. </s>
<s> You only know if you try. </s>
<s> But where is your backup? </s>

<s> That was my backup, That was my external drive that I use to back up all my pictures and videos. </s>
<s> I am a photographer. </s>
<s> So the Ubuntu will recover the data? </s>
<s> I bought this hard drive only a few months ago, might still be under warranty, do you think they'll be able to do anything better? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I didn't mention Ubuntu. </s>
<s> I was thinking programs like Getdataback, Zero Assumption Recovery, Recuva, Pandora. </s>
<s> It's unlikely a standard OS (like Linux) will find that data. </s>
<s> Warranty doesn't include recovery. </s>
<s> If they can't repair it you'll get another empty one. </s>
<s> If they repair it there's a good chance they delete your data in the process. </s>
<s> So don't count on that. </s>
<s> So if all you lost is your backup, you still have the originals. </s>
<s> I'd start with buying another hard disk to copy them to have another backup. </s>
<s> And from that external drive to another PC, of course, so you have 2 copies besides the original. </s>
<s> Then keep the external on a safe place outside your office and you'll have an acceptable backup for professional environment. </s>
<s> But webbased storage might even be better and easier. </s>

<s> possible) , do another backup to the new HDD and check the alternatives for replacing the 'the other drive' under warranty with WD. </s>
<s> I had a Fathom external drive that got the &quot;click of death&quot; and I lost all my data. </s>
<s> So when I replaced it, I bought the much more highly rated Western Digital My Book. </s>
<s> Two months ago I heard the horrible &quot;click of death&quot; sound as it tried and tried to search for files and then failed. </s>
<s> I finally got it to be recognized (sort of) by the computer. </s>
<s> It assigned it a drive letter, but indicated that the drive was completely unformatted. </s>
<s> About one Terebyte of data now gone! </s>
<s> But there's an interesting end to this hard drive story. </s>
<s> I didn't throw it away like I did the Fathom. </s>
<s> And the other day I gave it a try again, but this time plugging it into a different circuit -- not the powerstrip where all my other components were plugged into. </s>
<s> Apparently the power converter (this is just a guess of course) was not pulling quite enough power from the shared power strip to power the drive. </s>
<s> Once it was on a seperate outlet, it did just fine and I was able to access my data. </s>
<s> I'm not fully convinced something isn't wrong with the drive, but I was able to salvage and tranfer the data to another external drive. </s>
<s> Kinda wierd! </s>
<s> Because I have several other hard drives all plugged into power strips, and they all do just fine. </s>
