1.1.3	These are the specs I've come up with for my dream PC, which I plan to use as an all-in-one work/gaming/home theater system.	St
1.1.4	Can someone please tell me if they notice any components here that have known compatibility issues with each other.	Ques
1.1.5	Thank you in advance.	St

St
1.1.7	I want to have 8 gigs of RAM on Vista 64-bit.	St
1.1.8	Now the mobo's spec does not mention if it supports Intel EMT64 technology.	St
1.1.9	Does that mean that I cannot have 8 Gigs of RAM on this MOBO even with Vista-64 bit ?	Ques
1.1.10	I've been wondering about this forever.	St
1.1.11	Please help.	St
1.1.12	******** Any comments or suggestions regarding the above mentioned system configuration are welcome and would be greatly appreciated.	St
1.1.13	Thanks again.	Polite
1.2.1	http://www.motherboards.org/reviews/motherboards/1704_1.html Suggest you also google ASUS P5N32-E SLI nForce 680i and look at some of the reviews.	St
1.2.2	I saw 150 for that specific Mobo at Newegg.	St
1.2.3	Generally ASUS has a memory compatibility list grouped by stick size at the downloads area for each Mobo.	St
1.2.4	If you don't see it listed it could be an issue.	St
1.3.1	Hey jconner thanks for the info.	Polite
1.3.2	I looked at the Newegg reviews and the Qualified Vendor list.	St
1.3.3	Now one of the reviewers stated that he was happy about the board supporting 8 GB, but didn't mention clearly if he actually had 8 GB on it.	St
1.3.4	Now my question becomes: Even if the system does not have a problem recognizing 8 GB and shows 8 GB, how would you know if the system is ever using the second 4 gig pair when the first 4 gig pair is used up ?	Ques
1.3.5	In other words, is it even theoretically possible for the system to ever use the 2nd pair of 4 gigs without Intel EMT support ?	Ques
1.3.6	It says on the Intel QX6800 prod.	St
1.3.7	brief .pdf file that EMT requires supporting Mobo, BIOS, and OS.	St
1.3.8	any ideas ?	Ques
1.3.9	thanks again	Polite
1.4.1	and also I would e-mail ASUS support and ask the question of them.	St
1.4.2	I'm sorry I don't know the answer to your question.	Polite
1.4.3	Intel support and forums may also have an answer.	St
1.4.4	I also tend to use google like a person and ask specific questions with sometimes very good results.	St
1.4.5	Almost always I find it gets me to forum discussions similar to what I'm trying to find out.	St
1.4.6	Glad the suggestions helped a bit.	St
1.5.1	ok i will post the question there.	Sug
1.5.2	thanks a lot jconner.	Polite
