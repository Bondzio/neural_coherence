I want to add a 1 GB memory module to my 256 MB Dell Dimension 2400.
(WinXP Home, SP3).
The machine supports DDR-266 (PC2100) and DDR-333 (PC2700).
I dont know which one is currently in it.
If I add a DDR-333 module will it work OK if the original module is a DDR-266?
If not, is there a way to find out what kind of memory it has?
