hi, here is my magicjack experience.
i've had it for about 6 months.
i'm pretty happy with it.
you do have to factor in the cost... you do get what you pay for.
the sound quality, customer service, and reliability are not as good as a land line.
but for me it's good enough.. i just cancelled my land line a few weeks ago (i do have a cell phone too).
calls sound good most of the time.
i had an old laptop lying around so i made that my 'magicjack' computer.
i can leave it on and it doesn't use much power.
i did read something about it cutting off your calls after an hour (then you have to call the person back again).
but overall i'm satisfied.
