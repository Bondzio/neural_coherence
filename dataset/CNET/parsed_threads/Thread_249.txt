<s> Hey guys. </s>
<s> I got the same problem again as last time. </s>
<s> Turned my computer on and the only thing that shows are the black screen and &quot;No signal&quot; on the monitor. </s>
<s> I could hear it boot and all but it doesen't show it on the monitor. </s>
<s> The last time I got this problem, I changed my power supply (which was 4 weeks ago) and it worked again. </s>
<s> Just a couple of days ago, it did it again. </s>
<s> Anyone know what the problem or problems are? </s>
<s> I'm open to any suggestions. </s>

<s> Previous thread, I believe. </s>

<s> After relocation of some hardware to improve air flow, I had a floppy drive that would not work. </s>
<s> Turned out to be a pin fit to female connector in one of the power supply connectors extensions I had added to move the hardware around. </s>
<s> If I follow your previous post, you changed/replaced the power supply, maybe when you did this you fixed the problem only partially. </s>
<s> If a connector or even a wire is intermittent, the computer would work for awhile and then the connection or wire would open from vibrations and temperature change. </s>
<s> In addition to a connector being bad I also found the connection at the drive to be loose. </s>
<s> This required me to solder a pin on the drive back into place. </s>
<s> If this is the problem you are having about the only thing you can do is to check out all the connection till you find the bad one. </s>
<s> You may even need a magnifying glass to get a real close look at each connection also look at connection points on the PC boards. </s>
<s> Look for damaged, misalignment, and wires with too much play. </s>
<s> Just as a check, have you tried the safe mode at startup. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what OS your are using (win98, it was press F8 at just the right time in the boot up). </s>
<s> If you could enter safe mode and found that the display came up in safe mode I would then start looking into software fix, driver update. </s>
<s> I read some post that indicated Vista and video card driver compatibility issues were causing blank displays but I believe that was only a problem with laptop. </s>
<s> From your original post, you indicated that the display never even gave any load up splash screen. </s>
<s> If that is the case then I still feel you have a hardware problem. </s>
<s> Because the PS change did yield a positive result, it may still be the problem area. </s>
<s> Check the connections closely and if you find nothing you may have a deeper problem such as a short or failing board. </s>
