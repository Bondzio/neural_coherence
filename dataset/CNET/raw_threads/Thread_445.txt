First, we will assume you've done your homework, have decided on which components to buy, and are just looking for the best way to buy. Way 1): Log in to pricewatch.com amd get the lowest price period for that item. Make sure, however, that you are really getting the model you want. Lots of vendors substitute keywords and letters that mean a lot...an SE isn't an XT, etc. Double check before ordering. Most items will be OEM or bare (bare HDD's actually have a longer warranty thean retail box!) there's nothing wrong with that, they will come w/ drivers. Always get a mobo in retail box. Lowest price is your winner, but trust your gut. This way is the most fun, as pieces trickle in from all over and you do pay bottom dollar. TIP: One place to NOT scrimp is RAM, unless you're just building a number-cruncher. For power users, there really will be a difference, stick with Brand names like Corsiar, Crucial or Kingston. 1GB is minimum, (2)-512MB has a lower latency than (1)-1GB stick. Way 2): Buy everything in one place, like newegg.com. This is the way I'm headed more & more, as the slight cost difference is worth the convenience. There's a few things they don't carry, and I've had to go elsewhere for pieces, but I usually give these guys the meat of ny order. Really easy checkout too. Good luck & email me if you have any problems or questions! Tony

I always get the item one day before the date in the original fedex tracking info. Many other places give a low price and steal from you with the shipping cost.

Newegg has an &quot;expedited shipping&quot; for $2.99 that's for suckers only, I've NEVER used that and still get my parts within 3-4 days. I don't see how they could do it faster, unless they do them in their sleep! Always choose the least-expensive shipping method, unless it's an emergency.

Both are EXCELLENT, however. Everything I've ordered from them (RAM, speakers, video card, etc.) has arrived at least 1 day earlier than the FedEx expected delivery date. Tip: Newegg is cheaper on sound cards at the lower end, but ChiefValue is cheaper on the higher end ones (and usually they have free FedEx shipping!) Also, compare them, since they seem to be in direct competition with one another. (Some mornings one will have a monitor on sale and when I check the other, the exact monitor is also on sale!) RAM is usually cheaper at ChiefValue and Video cards, I've found, are less expensive at Newegg. Like another poster stated, if you're looking at pricewatch.com, pay CLOSE attention - I've noticed some model numbers advertised aren't the same ones when you visit the seller's web site. Good luck and have fun! Graham

I ordered a monitor from them last month and received an email receipt for a much higher price than what was advertised. I told them to either cancel the order or charge the advertised price. They told me that they could change their prices whenever they want, and they ignored my request to cancel the order. Since then they've somehow disappeared and not responded to any of my emails.

You have received some good advice, and practically everyone (including me) in these forums who have had dealings with Newegg have good results. I have read some time back of only one slight complaint, and that was them charging a 'restocking fee' on a certain item, but just about everyone charges a 'restocking fee' on certain returned items. About buying ''OEM''. There may be a longer warranty on certain OEM hard drives, but I always advise people who are new at buying mail order, installing parts, and not familiar with OEM parts to buy ''RETAIL'' boxed. When you see something that is indicated as ''White Box'' or ''Bulk'' it is normally ''OEM''. OEM (original equipment manufacture) parts may be made for a specific computer company like Dell, HP, Emachine, and others that may have given specific paramenters/specifications of what they want in the items construction, or the OEM may have cut corners in selling the OEM bulk parts. The OEM factory that actually makes the part may advertise their product commercially and sell it as ''RETAIL'', while making and selling an OEM version to a factory (or distributor getting ahold of OEM) that is not exactly like the 'Retail'. Also, on OEM versions you may not get instructions or manuals as the factory receiving the OEM item already knows and don't need. I recall ordering a computer around 6 years ago from Dell that advertised a certain Voodoo Video Card with certain features. When the PC arrived, the Voodoo Video Card was the right one ordered but didn't have the feature that was advertised by the Voodoo manufacturer, or Dell. I telephone Voodoo and finally talked to a engineer who told me that the particular OEM card that they shipped to Dell didn't have the feature that they advertise on their Retail card. Telephoning Dell and finally reaching a buyer representative of Dell parts (you could do that in those days), he was totally unaware that the particular OEM Voodoo Card lacked the advertised feature. Well, Dell almost immediately modified their Voodoo advertisements. They sent a truck out to my house and picked up my computer as they couldn't give me the video card features I wanted. I received a full $$ refund and no charge for shipping/handling either way (they charged in those days). When consumer VHS/Betamax cassette video recorders and camcorders came out is when I first heard about OEM, White Box, Bulk, vs Retail. Some mail order stores were selling them as OEM, White Box, Bulk, and when customers received them they were Japanese packed with instructions/manuals in Japanese and the units were set with switchable non US electricity and 50 cycle.

I have used tirgerdirect and Fry's outpost and computer gate, but I start with newwgg. Have you ever built one before??? If not repost and I'll post some links that will be helpfull. John
