<s> Hi, I have an ARRIS TG862 Modem/Router, it has a USB Port entrance in the back. </s>
<s> I would like to know if and how I can connect an external hard drive so as to use this External HD wirelessly. </s>
<s> Kind regards, </s>

<s> It does nothing today. </s>
<s> Small world. </s>
<s> I see TWC used that for our home. </s>

<s> I've seen on other threads that comcast will enable the usb port for a $70 fee. </s>
<s> Any hackers out there know how to do this for free? </s>
