(I tell you, mad...) As you add more sticks of RAM, the CPU BUS slows every so slightly and you may get failures.
You also will draw more power so any power issues may show up.
To get such to work I usually... first have the latest BIOS since some BIOS updates address memory timing.
Next I try the BIOS defaults, then I may slow down the memory timings.
If you feel this isn't right, you can always call the board/system supplier and demand they make it work or refund your money... Best of luck, Bob PS.
XP rarely pays off above 512M except for Doom 3.
And I've yet to see any payoff at 1.5G.
