After another one of my crashes, I inserted my Ubuntu live CD before forcing a shut down.
The computer would not access the harddrive and the Dell splash screen announcing hit F2 to enter set up would not show up on the monitor.
Although I did hear the CD drive beginning to spin, but eventually just stopped.
When running Ubuntu without a prior crash, it will still freeze after a prolonged period.
More Information: Only certain combinations of RAM make the computer crash.
256 & 256 - Crash 256 & 128 - Crash 256 - Stable 128 & 128 -Stable At this point, I'm completely perplexed as to what the problem could be.
Would CNET users just recommend sticking with the 256 (total) combinations?
