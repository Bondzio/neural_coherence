<s> Hey, I'm having some trouble in internet connection sharing. </s>
<s> My current setup is like this: I have a wireless router in the living room. </s>
<s> It is connected to a cable modem and an xbox through a wired connection. </s>
<s> In my room I have a computer with a wireless adapter, and it's working .. so i'm recieving wireless internet. </s>
<s> However the problem is this, my computer is connected to another computer via crossover cable. </s>
<s> This is what i want to do: The internet is accessed on the first computer via wireless and the second computer recieves internet through the first computer via ICS. </s>
<s> I've tried setting it up, but it the setup keeps telling me that the IP is already in use on the LAN ??? </s>
<s> Just for some extra information I'm using XP the ip of my router is 192.168.0.5 the ip of the first computer is 192.168.0.1 i can't seem to setup the ip of the second computer Any help is appreciated! </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> If you must use ICS and the crossover, you need to set ICS to use a different IP address range than the router, such as 198.168.1.xxx. </s>
<s> However, you could save yourself all kinds of headaches if you simply got another wireless adapter for the other computer. </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> within the same network segment is an exercise in futility. </s>
<s> Use another wireless device and ditch ICS. </s>
<s> thanks for the help! </s>
<s> Well just to follow up on what i did in the end: i moved the wireless router, and got an cat5 extention so the second computer and the xbox were wired, while the first computer recieved internet wirelessly. </s>
<s> Everything was working fine - until - i went to the next step of my wireless journey - security. </s>
<s> I decided to use the WPA-PSK method of security. </s>
<s> After installing it, everything seemed to be working fine..except when i started MSN messenger. </s>
<s> For some reason, when i have WPA-PSK activated, signing onto msn causes the wireless signal to disconnect. </s>
<s> Everything else works, (internet explorer ect. </s>
<s> ), just MSN doesn't. </s>
<s> After turing off security, everything went back to normal. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what the problem could be? </s>
<s> .. thanks in advance! </s>
<s> can cause agita in a lot a home networking scenarios. </s>
<s> I prefer to enable MAC filtering for the PCs/devices and leave encryption turned off. </s>
