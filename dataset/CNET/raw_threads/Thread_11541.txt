OS is Windows XP. 1.8GHz AMD Athlon(a few yrs old), 512MB RAM, 40Gb Hard drive. PC was working fine the other night and simply decided to restart on it's own(no ''obvious'' surge). As it restarted and went thru POST got stuck during windows loading. Since then doesn't even get that far. At one time got about 4 series of 8 short beeps. Checked beep codes. Tried different monitor, different video card. Tower lights are on, CPU fan running, PSU fan running, monitor light blinking, keyboard lights on. Was going to try swapping the PSU, but could PSU be faulty even if fan running? Should I swap PSU, change CMOS battery, or am I way out in Left field?? Hard drive seems to be running, just nothing getting to monitor anymore? Again monitor light is &quot;blinking&quot;. Hooked my son's PC to my monitor and monitor works fine. Other working video card did not work. Is my hard drive fried? Any ideas? Thanx.

I guess neither one &quot;hummed&quot;. ?Motherboard? I tried to check capacitors but didn't see anything suspicious. However, I probably wouldn't know the difference anyway. Would appreciate some feedback. Next step-Take it in to the shop. Thanx.

HP makes many different configurations and you did say it is a few years old. Will need processor, motherboard info etc. Model number of the system would help if you don't know the above:)

They heard a loud crack from the computer. The next day, when an attempted power-on was done, the power light did not come on, and there was no image on the monitor. I got it to work on. I wasn't sure what was wrong, so I stripped out all the PCI cards (modem, sound card, etc.)and I turned it on and it worked. I suggust you try taking out the PCI cards.

Has AMD Athlon 1.8GHz processor. WinXP Home, 512MB RAM; Don't know what MOBO it has or where to find Model#. Tried removing all PCI Cards as someone else suggested, but no results. Any other suggestions. I didn't really want to pay over a hundred bucks just to have it looked at by local Circuit City or Best Buy. Thanx.

I actually did have Belarc Advisor but that doesn't help now because I can't even get windows to open to access it. I actually think my Hard Drive is the problem and I committed the ultimate sin-that's right-I didn't back up. Live and learn. Hope that's not it. Any other ideas will be appreciated. Thanx.

I finally had someone look at it and there were some blown capacitors that fried the processor. So, getting a new motherboard and processor. Thank God it wasn't my Hard drive.
