<s> Yesterday morning when I turned on my home PC, it started acting very strangely. </s>
<s> The display was very odd, with every window that I closed appearing as a ghost image, before it shut down. </s>
<s> The mouse moved extremely slowly and anything I typed took a long time to show up. </s>
<s> I had to leave for work, so didn't get back to it until last night. </s>
<s> By the evening, all appeared well, and so I thought my problems were gone/over. </s>
<s> However, this morning when I turned on my PC the display never even lit up. </s>
<s> And once again, I had to leave to go to work. </s>
<s> I suspect that the monitor is shot, but I need to test this by putting another monitor onto the system. </s>
<s> Years ago I was told that you cannot hot swap monitors on Windows. </s>
<s> However, a friend of mine just told me that you can. </s>
<s> So I'd like to ask you all, can you hot swap DVI monitors on Windows 7? </s>
<s> While you can hot swap the monitors, it just makes sense to shut down and re-connect. </s>
<s> The time involved is minicle so it shouldn't be that long to do this. </s>
<s> At times some configs. </s>
<s> of the monitor may cause issue, so if things act up rather quickly then reset the monitor and/or setting via the OS and/or its video mgr. </s>
<s> to do this. </s>
<s> You may need to install the monitor disc to fully make use of all capabilities or install its s/w manager. </s>
<s> Basically, its up to you to conclude what's happening here. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> But how do I shut down the system gracefully, if I've got no video to work with, so I can see where to click the Shutdown link? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> If you see any display you act accordingly. </s>
<s> If none, then momentarily hitting the power-ON/OFF button will start the shutdown, direct h/w wise. </s>
<s> In some cases you may need to hold power-ON button longer to get reaction, too long it may restart again, you'll get a feel for it after awhile ------Willy </s>
<s> That worked perfectly! </s>
<s> Today's machines can power down, hibernate (the one I use), sleep, so you can tailor the power button to do what you want. </s>
