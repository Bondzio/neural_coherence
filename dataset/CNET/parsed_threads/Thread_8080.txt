<s> OK, I've researched and learned what I could (limited depth on computers) and now I'd like some good advice. </s>
<s> I want a new computer that I will be using primarily for photoshop. </s>
<s> Am I better off going with the i7-920 or will the difference be negligible if I go with the less expensive i7-860 or i5? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Rather than the CPU itself, you probably want one that can handle more threads. </s>
<s> i5 CPUs in quad core currently don't do hyperthreading. </s>
<s> i7s do. </s>
<s> Your budget will be a deciding factor. </s>
<s> here are some photoshop benchmarks with both and the i5: http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=3704&p=8 the diff in photoshop may not be that much, the diff in video apps is huge. </s>
<s> overall, i believe the i-860 to be best cpu from a price/performance standpoint. </s>
<s> ...that was the kind of data I was looking for. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
