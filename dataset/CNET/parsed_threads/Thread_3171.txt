<s> hello everyone, pls i have this porblem with the new laptop i bought, the laptop works just fine, but only when plugged to the charger, when i power up the laptop, it indicates charging in the task bar, but after a min, it display on ac power icon without the charging icon, i have checked the control panel the battery is in place, is a lithium-ion type, but is does charge, if i romeve the charger the unit just switches off, and i noticed that the standy mode is greyed out when i click the shut down button, any ideas, i don't want to open the unit (the battery is inside and cannot be removed without unscrewing the back cover), thanks. </s>
<s> The best advice might be to take it back while under warranty so there's no question about it being tampered with. </s>
