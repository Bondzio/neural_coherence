Is this type of device TEW-647GA Wireless Gaming Adapter the same as a network bridge? If so, why don't they call it a network bridge, which is a more general purpose device and appeal to more buyers? If not, what is it about this gaming adapter that makes it better than a network bridge for connecting to xbox, tivo, etc?
