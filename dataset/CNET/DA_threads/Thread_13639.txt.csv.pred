1.1.1	Hi, I have a HP Photosmart C5180 printer, and a few weeks ago it started having issues.	St
1.1.2	It wouldn't print at first, so we would turn it off and then back on, and then it would print.	St
1.1.3	Then after a few days, that quick fix didn't work and it wouldn't print at all.	St
1.1.4	I tried the suggestions from the troubleshooting manual - disconnect from pc, power, etc., then reconnect again, and that didn't work.	St
1.1.5	I removed it from the pc and just plugged it in separately to a different outlet to see if it would work on it's own, and it doesn't.	St
1.1.6	I have to remove the power cord entirely to turn it off.	St
1.1.7	When I leave it plugged in, the printer just continuously tries to restart itself without success, then shuts down for a couple seconds, then tries to turn on again.	St
1.1.8	I would try a different power adapter/cord, but it's not a traditional cord that I can just use a spare one to connect to the printer.	St
1.1.9	It would cost more to service this printer than it's worth, so I just wanted to check here and see if anyone had similar issues or know of a fix.	St
1.1.10	Thanks for any feedback!	St
1.2.1	You are left to YOUR CHOICE HERE.	St
1.2.2	There is no service manual and I've found service, even a DIAGNOSTIC to exceed the price of a new printer.	St
1.2.3	Some seem upset at that but would we rather pay more for a printer and service?	St
1.2.4	(If so, there are better printers which can be fixed when broken.)	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	You didn't mention the operating system that you are using.	St
1.3.2	Did you uninstall and reinstall the software?	St
1.3.3	If you are using Vista or 7, with the C5180 you may have to upgrade the software from Hp's web site.	St
1.3.4	It may be bad harware (internal printer issue) as Bob said but it could also be a software problem related to the printer/OS.	St
1.3.5	Check software before you scrap the unit, C5180 was fairly decent.	St
1.4.1	i know this post is old but my brother and i have the same printers and bought them at the same time.	St
1.4.2	he is having the exact same problem as described above we switched printer sand mine is working on his computer.	St
1.4.3	i searched alot of forums but no one has an answer.	St
1.4.4	do you ???	Ques
1.4.5	this is what it is doing the printer just continuously tries to restart itself without success, then shuts down for a couple seconds, then tries to turn on again.	St
1.4.6	i cannot even estabish a computer connection as well.	St
1.4.7	the display screen shows hp logo with the load bar trying to load and then it freezes then tries to restart again.	St
1.4.8	i check and did all the obvious here to troubleshoot but no prevail.	St
1.4.9	should i take it to best buy geeks	Ques
1.5.1	My answer is that there are no service manuals for these products.	St
1.5.2	I see a few for sale at 10 to 20 dollars at http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000GWMJVA/ref=dp_olp_used_mbc?ie=UTF8&amp;storeAttribute=e&amp;submit.see-all-buying-options=see-all-buying-options&amp;condition=used While service and repair is possible, the cost to do so is more than a new or used printer.
