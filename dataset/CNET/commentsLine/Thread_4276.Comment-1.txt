i have a single level house with three laptops, two of which are dell inspirons and one of which is an ibm thinkpad.
i need a recommendation for a router that is much more focused on range than speed.
the speed that comes out of the cable modem is fine for us, as we don't do many speed-intensive tasks.
also, i would like it to be easy to set up, as i am fairly knowledgeable when it comes to techy stuff, but not programmer smart or anything.
thanks much!
