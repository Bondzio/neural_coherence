jb1323, this message, &quot;digital input in power save mode.
press any key on keyboard or move mouse&quot;, means the monitor is no longer recieving a signal from the video card.
diagnostic lights 3 and 4 mean the memory modules are detected, but a memory failure has occurred.
* power the pc off * unplug the power cord from the rear of the pc * lay the pc on its left side * remove the cover  * remove and reseat all of the memory in their sockets  * reinsert the power cord * turn the pc on if you still get diagnostic lights 3 and 4, then either one or all of the memory is bad.
you can start the process of elimination by removing the memory from the black sockets, power on.
then replace those and remove the memory from the white sockets, power on.
you get the idea.
once you ascertain what memory is bad, you can then replace it.
