Thank you Willy.
Im planning on spending 6000 to 8000 on a high end gaming computer so I just wanted to make sure the company I go with has good technical support (at least enough to act like they care).
Falcon Northwest from what I have read has excellent customer service.
I'm not in it for just the cool case but if I spend this much on a computer I figure I should get what I want.
Thank you for your help!
