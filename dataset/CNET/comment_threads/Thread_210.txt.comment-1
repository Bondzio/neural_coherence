I have an iMac with a 2.4 GHZ Intel Core 2 Duo running OS 10.6.2 that I wish to set up in a local Firewire network with a Mac G4 Power PC Processor 867 running OS 10.5.8.
The Firewire is securely attached to both computers, I have carefully followed the first directions in the &quot;Help&quot;, In the &quot;Assist Me &quot; boxes and in Pogue's &quot;Missing Manual for Leopard&quot;, but neither machine responds with the same dialogue boxes as I was led to expect from any of the directions.
I would be VERY thankful if someone would help me (with detaiis, please) set up this network and connect it to the internet
