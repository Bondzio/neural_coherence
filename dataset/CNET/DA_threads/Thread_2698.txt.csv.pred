1.1.1	NOTE : this is similar to iceman854l 's problem .	St
1.1.2	Recently I purchased the LaCie 1TB Disk Extreme+ .	St
1.1.3	The problem is that my computer wo n't really recognize it .	St
1.1.4	Here 's what happens when I turn on the HDD .	St
1.1.5	It 's connected to the computer through Firewire 800 .	St
1.1.6	When I turn it on , the computer ( Vista OS ) makes the sound that indicates a device has been plugged in or turned on , but nothing else pops up .	St
1.1.7	When I go to & quot ; Computer & quot ; ( Vista 's & quot ; My Computer & quot ; ) there 's no sign of an external HDD .	St
1.1.8	When I go to the Device Manager and look under Disk Drives , the HDD is somehow listed in there , so then I go to its properties and it says it 's working properly , that it is online and everything , and it even shows how much space there is on the HDD ... but how the hell can I get in it ? !	Ques
1.1.9	I 've tried uninstalling the driver , then reinstalled .	St
1.1.10	Did n't work .	St
1.1.11	I 've tried to unplug any other devices but my keyboard/mouse .	St
1.1.12	Did n't work .	St
1.1.13	Tried to use USB .	St
1.1.14	Did n't make a difference .	St
1.1.15	Can anyone help ?	Ques
1.1.16	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	That 's not well supported even in Vista .	St
1.2.2	Use these simple rules on connections .	St
1.2.3	PC/Windows = USB Apple/MacOS = Firewire PC/Linux = your choice If you feel Firewire should work please call Microsoft .	St
1.2.4	I see you tried USB and failed .	St
1.2.5	At that point you have either not partitioned the drive and formatted those partitions or have a dead drive .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	I use it for my digital camcorder when I record things to the computer .	St
1.3.2	That works .	St
1.3.3	I found a way to get this HDD formatted ... the thing is : It freezes every time while formatting .	St
1.3.4	http : //i19.tinypic.com/4mceuxc.jpg This is an image of the formatting .	St
1.3.5	Note that I was doing this at almost 4:00AM .	St
1.3.6	I left it on all night and at the moment it is STILL at the same stage .	St
1.3.7	Nothing has changed ... ..	St
1.4.1	Remember that people have brought me these firewire problems for years .	St
1.4.2	No one shows me a working system .	St
1.4.3	Yes somewhere for some it does work .	St
1.4.4	But when people tell me of trouble you will get my take on firewire .	St
1.4.5	Again it 's either another firewire + Windows disaster or you have a defective drive .	St
1.4.6	I read that you write FORMATTING .	Polite
1.4.7	Tell me if you made the PARTTITIONS .	St
1.4.8	If not , remove then , create them and try one more time .	St
1.4.9	On XP I 'd suggest a QUICK FORMAT .	St
1.4.10	Same for Vista if you can since formatting large drives can take a very very long time .	St
1.4.11	Bob	St
1.5.1	Would you be able to explain all that to me in bigger details ?	Ques
1.5.2	Sorry , I 'm just a noob when it comes to this stuff .	St
1.5.3	So I was wonderng if you , or anyone , could explain me from the very start to finish how to do this whole formatting thing ?	Ques
1.6.1	But I try to never duplicate web content like how to partition in XP or Vista .	St
1.6.2	Let 's find some pages on that .	St
1.6.3	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & safe=off & q=VISTA+PARTITION Yes !	St
1.6.4	The very first link is about how to use the Vista partitioning tools .	St
1.6.5	After I have removed the old partition I create it anew and format it ( quick mode if possible ) .	St
1.6.6	Again it does not matter if firewire works on your camcorder .	St
1.6.7	Try USB if you fail on the firewire link .	St
1.6.8	Bob	St
1.7.1	I am using USB 2.0 now .	St
1.7.2	Lets see if this works .	St
1.8.1	Actually , someone told me something different about formatting .	St
1.8.2	This also reminded me on how I reformatted my first external HDD .	St
1.8.3	I opened up the Command Prompt window , typed in N : /FS : NTFS ( Yes , suddenly it became N. It used to be G : ) and so far it 's working .	St
1.8.4	It takes time but it 's 14 % complete now ( almost 2 hours in the reformatting process ) .	St
1.9.1	Then scandisk or other tool later .	St
1.9.2	Bob	St
1.10.1	After a long night , it has finally formatted Now it 's finally displaying on My Computer when it 's on and I can go into it woot .	St
