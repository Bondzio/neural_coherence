1.1.1	I 'm curious if a GIGABYTE GA-EP45-UD3P LGA 775 Intel P45 ATX Intel Motherboard would be compatible with an Intel Xeon X3370 Yorkfield 3.0GHz 12MB L2 Cache LGA 775 95W Quad-Core Server Processor .	St
1.1.2	I have researched their FSBs and they can run at a frequency of 1333Mhz .	St
1.1.3	The motherboard has others it can at it 's max is 1333Mhz and is the same rate as the Xeons frequency , also the motherboard can run quad-core chip sets .	St
1.1.4	The LGA is the same as already indicated .	St
1.1.5	I 'm positive even though the CPU is a server CPU type that it will fit and run on a desktop motherboard .	St
1.1.6	I 'm I correct or is this impossible ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/CPUSupport_Model.aspx ? ProductID=2953 the only difference between a xeon and core2quad is the xeon has a bit of microcode that allows it be used in a dual socket mobo .	St
1.2.2	otherwise the x3370 is the same chip as the q9650 .	St
1.2.3	your gigabyte mobo will handle that xeon fine .	St
1.3.1	thanks man .	Polite
1.3.2	It not being on the list of the manufacture pages CPU support info made me a little skeptical about it .	St
1.3.3	So that difference in the electrode is not critical it will work fine .	St
1.3.4	That 's good !	St
1.3.5	I posted on other forums as well about this to get input and website references .	St
1.3.6	I heard the Xeon is considered a core2 quad on yahoo answers by a person that replied .	St
1.4.1	I mean microcode .	St
1.4.2	whoops i had the word electrode in my head for some reason while typing .	St
1.5.1	so i can guarantee it works .	St
1.6.1	Hmm.. then I should n't have an issue with it then at all .	St
1.6.2	But the difference between the xeon x3370 and the core2 q9650 are not very different at all .	St
1.6.3	So in benchmarks for handling 3d applications like maya must be talking about the more workstation xeons for server boards that hardcore 3d animators use for their renderfarms .	St
1.6.4	Thanks again , I think I may consider the q9650 over the xeon , the only difference is the microcode and L1 and L2 cache speeds .	St
1.6.5	other than that I believe they are the same .	St
