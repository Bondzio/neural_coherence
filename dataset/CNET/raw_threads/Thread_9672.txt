Satellite vs HP? 210 vs Asus Eee PC 1005	Which one of these netbooks would last me a long time and comes with everything I need right out of the box. I am looking to use this netbook for web surfing, school work,and video watching. I also would like to know, if anybody knows,if I would have to buy the OS or Microsoft when I buy the netbook, or if I have a a month or two trial time. Below will be the links to the netbook specs.

M305-S49052 14.1&quot; Laptop (Refurbished) was the only one that had the REQUIRED DVDRW to complete the system, it is out of stock. As to buying the OS. Are you sure? Most arrive with an OS installed and you never &quot;buy&quot; it but pay for a license. The difference is subtle but some continue to think they buy the OS. Bob
