I want to find out what hardware is inside without dismantling them. Is there any software that will do this for me. I want to find out what kind of memory they have, what hard drives and what processor. I know I can get some info from My Computer etc. The Dell one is running Win 98 but I haven't tried the Tiny one yet. Any help gratefuly received

They should give you good info. Don't be afraid to open the case. You will need to do this anyway when you inspect the inside for dirt, dust, cobwebs, missing/broken components, bad capacitors, loose cables and cards, et al.
