but i did replace such a card with a fx5500 w/256mb ram and the kid's machine is now much better.
for &quot;today's&quot; games, this one is dated.
look at the test results.
i should address the cpu on sdram.
yes, an over 2ghz cpu would benchmark poorly with sdram.
it's much like a boat anchor or drag chute on such a cpu's performance.
