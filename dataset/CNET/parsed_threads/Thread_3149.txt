<s> I have 2 harddrive questions: 1. </s>
<s> I have an external hard drive and although I am suppose to have a USB 2.0 connection no matter where I pull the cable it keeps telling me that the hard drive is not going to function as well and needs to be put in a USB 2.0 port. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I currently have a 80GB hard drive installed on my computer and when like to get and larger one installed. </s>
<s> Can they install a bigger hard drive say 250GB and transfer over all my stuff from the 80GB hard drive without causing any problems? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Are you sure that your computer is USB 2.0? </s>
<s> Make sure that you have tried this whith every port on your PC. </s>
<s> Your hard drive will work in USB 1.1 mode, but transfer speeds will be DRAMATICALLY lower. </s>
<s> I'm not joking. </s>
<s> You will notice a HUGE difference with USB 2.0. </s>
<s> It is possible that your computer is USB 2.0 compliant, but for some reason is in USB 1.1 mode. </s>
<s> If you are sure that your computer should be USB 2.0, but for some reason is not, then email me at ranguvar13@gmail.ocm, I may be able to help more. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Why not run both hard drives together.? </s>
<s> You can do that. </s>
<s> You can keep your OS on the 80GB one,a nd use the larger one for most of your data that won't fit on the old one. </s>
<s> ''Can they install a bigger hard drive say 250GB and transfer over all my stuff from the 80GB hard drive without causing any problems?'' </s>
<s> Do you mean transfer EVERYTHING (as in, Windows (or whatever you use), apps, games, utilities, etc. </s>
<s> ), or do you mean just drag-and-drop data over? </s>
<s> Either way, the answer is yes. </s>
<s> If you want to copy EVERYTHING, though, you will need a drive-imaging app like Symantec Norton Ghost. </s>
<s> That program will read all the data on your 80-GB hard drive into a single file, which can be then (with Ghost or whatever) be uncompressed onto your new hard drive, resulting in a perfect copy of EVERYTHING. </s>
<s> I hope I could help. </s>
<s> About the USB 2.0 port you nead driver for USB 2.0 to be installd for it to work. </s>
<s> About swaping disks the best thing is to by this program http://www.drive-image.com/ to make a copy of your C: drive to the USB 2.0 drive and then pasting the imigefile to your new 250Gb disk. </s>
<s> After that you chang te 80 and the 250 on the cabels and log in to windows. </s>
<s> When loggd in you go for the command promt and run CMD If you do it right you get a black window, in it you type chkdsk C: /R and hit enter, then answer yes to the question and reboot. </s>
<s> After the reboot is doon you done! </s>

<s> 1 - you may have the usb ports set at 1.0 speed in the BIOS. </s>
<s> This is unlikely, but the only thing I could think of, unless you only have 1.0 ports 2 - yes, use norton/Symantec Ghost </s>
<s> Are you 100% sure that the ports on the computer you have are USB 2.0 Ports? </s>
<s> What type/model of computer is it that you have? </s>
<s> Is the 80 gig drive the drive on which your operating system is installed? </s>
<s> If it is then you will need a some drive image software unless you want to reinstall the OS and your applications. </s>
<s> There are hardware and software compatibility issues with larger HD's, so you need to: - Tell us the make & model of your computer. </s>
<s> - Tell us what operating system you are using (example: Windows XP with SP2). </s>
<s> * * * * * 1. </s>
<s> If your computer has only USB 1.1 ports, install a PCI USB 2.0 card. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You can keep your OS on the 80GB drive and just install the 250GB HD as a secondary drive. </s>
<s> If you want to move everything to the new HD, the HD maker (Seagate, Western Digital, Hitachi, Maxtor, etc.) </s>
<s> provides a free utility to transfer the image of everything on the 80GB model to the new HD. </s>
<s> Note that the utility from a particular maker usually only works if you have one of their HD's installed. </s>
<s> As far as the USB thing goes it sounds like your PC does not have USB 2.0. </s>
<s> The larger hard drive could be a very easy thing though. </s>
<s> Just get the new hard drive and put it in the second bay of your computer. </s>
<s> Make sure that the Hard drive is set to slave. </s>
<s> Then you will not have to go through all the work of mirroring the drive. </s>
<s> You will still have the 80 GB drive just as it ws before, but now you will also have the 250 GB drive. </s>
<s> Thats what I would do. </s>
<s> Since you already have the 80 GB drive why not use it too. </s>
<s> More storage is more storage ~Carl Marx </s>
<s> My computer shows that I have a USB 2.0 port but its not reconizing it as being a high speed port. </s>
<s> The people at Gateway told me the I need a USB adapter. </s>
<s> It is possible for the USB ports to work but be defective as not to work as a 2.0 port? </s>
<s> Also, I think I will just add another hard drive. </s>
<s> I do have a USB 2.0 port but for some reason my external hard drive doesn't reconize it. </s>
<s> My brother doesn't have this problem when he uses the hard drive with his computer. </s>
<s> Whats the best way to check if I do indeed have a USB 2.0 port? </s>
