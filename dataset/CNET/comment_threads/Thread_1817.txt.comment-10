You asked...&quot;Where it say's &quot;memory&quot; on the card info section does that have anything to do with my RAM?&quot; No...it (usually) refers only to the RAM that comes on the video card.
The good thing is going from an onboard GPU (which uses system RAM) to a separate video card which has it's own RAM and leaves the system RAM for the use by the system.
It's really a 'twofor'.
