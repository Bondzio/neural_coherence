It can work, but I was concerned that the NAT/Routers may not know how to handle the packet bound for the other LAN.
Good to see it works.
&quot;It seems to works... but did I do it correctly?&quot; The file sharing and route to/from each LAN may fail.
If so, you change the netmask so that both LANs are in the same LAN.
