1.2.1	It 's the one from Zotac with fanless , 1GB and is installed on a HP d499t .	St
1.2.2	Not any problem and I like the power draw .	St
1.2.3	The entire machine pulls about 99 Watts when on a web page or Office .	St
1.2.4	And when gaming pulls a gentle 120 Watts .	St
1.2.5	This means I did n't have to upgrade the power supply .	St
1.2.6	The 8400/8600s were ok when new but they seem to be failing a lot now .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	check out these benchmarks and note which card performs better in the games and resolutions you 're interested in .	Sug

1.4.1	same sys specs as i stated above .	St
1.4.2	I got this ZOTAC GT 240 1 gb ddr5 installed it properly with newest recommended driver 258.96 from nvidia website .	St
1.4.3	i did n't get any problem with graphics for 2 days ... .though i got some small blue pink like boxes while opening windows firewall ... .restarted the system and it did n't came after that .	St
1.4.4	but on third day which means few hours before i posted this problem ... .i started having a strange problem .	St
1.4.5	i play video , be it using any media player , but the computer freezes randomly after doing that .	St
1.4.6	this is what happens ( while playing any video only ) - sometimes it plays flawlessly sometimes it freezes in the middle for about 2-3 ( damn ) mins and then gets normal .	St
1.4.7	sometimes it freezes then recovers and plays only audio while the video is completely blank .	St
1.4.8	once the system froze , i restarted it and after welcome screen it showed only blue artifacts and boxes having color tones like we see on welcome screen only it takes a lot of time to close any media player from the task manager , system freezes while doing that .	St
1.4.9	sometimes the media player process keeps running , though i had closed it normally by hitting quit button , and at that time system performance shoots up to 50 percent or above .	St
1.4.10	i googled this problem and some of them got this problem but do n't seem to find any possible cause other than changing the card ( though it did n't worked either for some of them ) is there any problem with the card or do i need to update any other thing ... like bios ... if it could be a bios issue ... .guide me how to update it .	St
1.4.11	if it does n't seem that then HELP ME OUT PLEASE ! !	St
1.4.12	!	St
1.5.1	My Zotac gt 240 1GB fanless card is doing great .	St
1.5.2	No lockups or troubles and it 's in a HP d4999t .	St
1.5.3	But your system is one I find many struggle with .	St
1.5.4	It 's usually some BIOS setting , the RAM or the owner that thought CPU HEAT SINK COMPOUND was optional .	St
1.5.5	Too often they think it 's a driver .	St
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	i had tested my RAM with memtest and also installed and checked them individually ... came out with no errors some 8-9 months ago i had replaced my previous card 8400 gs ... then they had applied the compound on the heat sink and also updated the BIOS should i do that again ?	Ques
1.6.2	i mean checking the thermal grease and updating the bios ?	Ques
1.7.1	Tell more of the story .	St
1.7.2	Until this post I did n't read that it worked for 8 or more months .	St
1.7.3	And who are they ?	Ques
1.7.4	For now forget the memtest .	St
1.7.5	Use one stick of RAM .	St
1.7.6	Bob	St
1.8.1	my previous 8400 gs started working badly and showed jagged lines ... .this happened some 9 months ago i replaced that 8400 gs card with a new but same model ... then & quot ; they & quot ; means computer hardware technicians at xfx service centre had applied the thermal grease and also updated the bios .	St
1.8.2	and the reason i 'm using 2 sticks is that i have 1tb hdd ... as the system was giving slower performance with 2 gb ... the computer technician at my workplace suggested me to upgrade it to 4 gb ... .and to utilize 4 gb mem completely i had to install windows xp sp2 64 bit and now THIS problem after getting gt 240 .	St
1.9.1	That 's a sad version .	St
1.9.2	I find it to be fine if the drivers are spot on but rarely can I find an owner or shop able to deal with XP 64 bit .	St
1.9.3	My HP d4999t is running without a single issue with the same make , model card but I have Windows 7 64 bit and a clean machine .	St
1.9.4	No torrents or that older OS that you know to steer clear of .	St
1.9.5	Maybe it is the gt 240 but here not a sign of trouble but then again quite a different OS and machine .	St
1.9.6	Bob	St
1.10.1	i googled this issue and most of the windows 7 users are facing the same problem ... ..most of them are facing this while playing game .	St
1.10.2	so we ca n't say it can be an os problem	St
1.11.1	I did n't reveal that many friends and my son has this similar setup without issue .	St
1.11.2	Makes me wonder why folk have issues with this .	St
1.11.3	Bob	St
1.12.1	i have one pci-e x16 expansion slot .	St
1.12.2	which version , can we say , this slot is in m2a-vm 690g chipset ?	Ques
1.12.3	is it 1.1 ?	Ques
1.12.4	because i contacted the customer care regarding the graphics issue and they said that gt-240 shows compatibility with pci-e 2.0 x16 ... .and i should get gt 240 replaced with 9800 gt because it shows compatibility with both 2.0 and 1.1	St
1.13.1	It 's well discussed about 2.0 and 1.x slots .	St
1.13.2	So far it makes no diff if you have a 1.x card , 2.0 card and either slot .	St
1.13.3	Since I would be duplicating the web here I 'll keep it simple .	St
1.13.4	That 's not an issue .	St
1.13.5	Bob	St
1.14.1	actually i work as a 3d artist in a gaming studio and i use 3ds max 9.0 64 bit as gt 240 was showing problems so i removed it and installed my previous card 8400gs .	St
1.14.2	after installing it was running ok though making the system a little slower .	St
1.14.3	i started 3ds max ... .but i did n't showed any grid in the viewport ... ..i imported a mesh but max could n't render it ... ..so i went into & quot ; customize & gt ; preferences & gt ; viewports & quot ; and changed the driver from directx to openGL ... ..restarted it initially it hanged ... so i restarted the system then i started 3dsmax again and i could see the viewports ?	Ques
1.14.4	so could it be directx problem also ?	Ques
1.15.1	i ran dxdiag no problems found so directx is clear i checked the bios version it 's 1404 , date 10/92007 it could be old bios problem also then .	St
1.15.2	how latest bios do i need to run gt240 ... or even 84000gs ?	Ques
1.16.1	how latest version of the bios do i need for cards like 9800gt or gt 240 ?	Ques
1.17.1	Has the topic changed from board selection to fixing some issue ?	Ques
1.17.2	I know there are issues in 32 bit OSes but here as I noted these cards are not giving us any grief .	St
1.17.3	Bob	St
