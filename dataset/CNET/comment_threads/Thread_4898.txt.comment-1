Hiya - I'm looking for an LCD screen, preferably internal, but not a necessity, 8.75-9&quot;, traditional shape not widescreen, that would be compatible with a G4 iBook.
If not directly compatible, if it's just a connector problem, if an adapter of some sort is available or could be fashioned, that'd be close enough for jazz.
Does anyone know of something that'd fit the bill?
That sells for a reasonable price?
Not an immediate rush, got a few more things to take care of before the screen's needed, but it'd be good to know for when I get there.
Thanks
