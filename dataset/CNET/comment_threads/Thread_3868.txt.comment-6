If original holographed Windows XP CD won't install, it's a hardware issue.
All you can do: remove all unnecessary hardware.
Keep only necessary hardware (one harddisk, CD, (PS/2) keyboard, (PS/2) mouse, video).
Then try again.
If it's still failing, it's one of remaining components.
You already excluded the hard disk, it seems.
That leaves the fans to check (can be a temperature issue) and the motherboard, the RAM (try it with one stick if that's big enough), the CD drive, the keyboard, the mouse, the videocard and the PSU to replace.
Choose the sequence you like most.
