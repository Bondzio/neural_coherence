I did not want to temper with the BIOS as long as the pc can operate, this was fine over a year until recently the SATA HDD was suddenly undetectable.
I guess I'm wrong.
Should/must I update the BIOS?
I was forced to re-install XP on an older IDE HDD and it is working.
But a newly purchsed SATA HDD cannot be detected, so I suspect the motherboard's SATA function is damaged.
