I just received a Samsung Syncmaster 930BF and love it but I am having a problem, as I also had with my previous CRT monitor. When I move around -turning scrolling- in 3D applications (Games)it isn't smooth it blurs I have tried changing all of the settings apart from H/V frequences which I dont know how to change anyway, I have searched online also but can't find an answer. I had this problem on my previous CRT and I thought getting LCD monitor would fix it, but it didnt. Please help, thanks!
