<s> I am running Windows XP - I have a Maxtor 3000LE 40G external hard drive. </s>
<s> I've had some problems getting XP to &quot;see&quot; it but now the issue is an error message I don't understand. </s>
<s> The drive shows up under my computer but when I click on it I get this error message. </s>
<s> &quot; The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error&quot; Anyone know what that means or what I can do about it? </s>
<s> thanks </s>

<s> Try another machine to get what you didn't backup off that drive. </s>
