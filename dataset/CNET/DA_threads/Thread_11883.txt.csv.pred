1.1.1	I have a sony vio that have blutooth stack for windows by Toshiba.	St
1.1.2	I connect thru it to GPS dongle after connecting to the device ,when I click on detail button I see the MAC address of device, also I can type in Application-path dialog box a file to be run automatically after connecting to dongle.	St
1.1.3	does anybody know in which file the infornmatin of detail window (MAC address and application path) are saved?	Ques
1.2.1	But if I was to research this I'd find REGMON from Sysinternals to watch what registry keys are being written.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Sepassgozaram(Thanks) Bob, I saw those parameters and where they are saved.	St
1.3.2	Perhaps I will need to have your guide about how to access them and change.	St
1.4.1	Bob, I connected thru ProcessMon and saw where they are saved.	St
1.4.2	Toshiba establish a stack and save those variable there.	St
1.4.3	also it refers to a log file but i did not see its content change.	St
1.4.4	could you guide me how can i read and change these information?	Sug
1.4.5	by windows explorer I can go up to a directory that has log file, but I cannot see the stack, however thru processmonitor there are three level deeper directory as well.	St
1.5.1	This is what they call REVERSE ENGINEERING and has too much downside for me to do more than note the tools to find where the items are stored.	St
1.5.2	Now that you have your tools you get to REVERSE ENGINEER what all this means and how they use those settings.	St
1.5.3	Maybe there's something supported that you want to do but I don't see this in this discussion.	St
1.5.4	Let me reveal that I am programming apps that use Bluetooth which is partly why I shared.	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	Bob, what I am doing simply is as following: I have a software and thru it I call thirdparty exe file named ECCENTER.exe that is BT setting application in my VAIO laptop.	St
1.6.2	in ECCENTER app there is an option called Application path that we can enter another exe/app-file to be run automaytically after connecting to a BT device, what i am trying to achieve is that I insert the exe/app-file in application path dynamically inside my software and then call ECCENTER.	St
1.7.1	There is no need to play with the entries of the bluetooth registry.	St
1.7.2	Let me share again that I also have apps that use bluetooth and looked into automatic pairing and more.	St
1.7.3	I now know what it takes to do that but if you maintain there is no reverse engineering required, then we have no more to discuss?	St
