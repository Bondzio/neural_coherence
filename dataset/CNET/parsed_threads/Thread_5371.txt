<s> Do wireless routers degrade over time? </s>
<s> I have probably had this one for a year and a half or 2 years and probably did a firmware update about 6 months ago or so. </s>
<s> I have noticed that my signal has not been nearly as strong as it was a a couple months ago. </s>
<s> I am now connected at around 1mbps or 2, whereas I used to be connected around 18-54. </s>
<s> Is it possible that the router has hit its life span and I should do some research on a new one, possibly the Pre-N? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> My location of my computer has not changed at all. </s>
<s> I am using windows xp, on a 1.8ghz machine. </s>
