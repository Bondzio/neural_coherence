you won't have any problem getting a signal on both phases of your 220v house.
in fact the signal from homeplug devices will travel as far as the transformer that feeds your house from the power company (which might be shared with a few of your neighbors, so be sure to use the software utility include to change the default 128bit aes encryption key from &quot;homeplug&quot; to something unique).
the linksys devices work great and use the latest homeplug av technology.
i highly recommend them, especially if you plan on doing any streaming of audio or video in your home.
