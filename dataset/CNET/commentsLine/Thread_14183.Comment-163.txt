zenith 286 running zdos in 1986. i was a contractor and the military unit we were supporting bought 1500 of them and asked if we could support them.
we said sure (none of us had seen one before) and we proceeded to ojt.
you could do anything with a batch file back then.
i then purchased a pc with 512k ram, two 5 1/4 360k floppies,and a monster 10 mb hard drive, and a vga monitor.
we would never in a lifetime fill a 10 mb hard drive!
purchase price was $1800.
so we have come a long, long, way....
