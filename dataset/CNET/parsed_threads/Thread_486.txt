<s> Hi All, Any help would be really appreciated as I'm getting nowhere. </s>
<s> On my Vista basic laptop I want to enable ICS so that I can connect my Xbox to Xbox live through it as my router is downstairs. </s>
<s> I have trawled the web and come across web help and found tutorials saying to set to automatic and start various services i.e. </s>
<s> application layer gateway service, plug and play etc. </s>
<s> I've done this, switched off windows firewall. </s>
<s> I have no other active firerwalls currently. </s>
<s> But still it pops up with Shared for a second, disappears and I get the the generic error?? </s>
<s> ANy ideas what could still be stopping me from sharing? </s>
<s> Read why at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/937168 </s>
<s> My computer should be up to date with the latest service packs and patches so it's a strange one. </s>
<s> Still I got around the problem by bridging the connection between my Lan and Wifi connections. </s>
<s> Wish I'd realised in the first place </s>
