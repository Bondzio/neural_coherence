My PC does not have a brand.
Our network &quot;guy&quot; built it and a couple of others for us last year.
He moved and I can't get in touch with him anymore.
There is no manual.
I'm sure he used parts which were easy to find and cheap, but it is fast works great.
The ports, both front and back, are white, not blue, so I assume they are not USB 3.0.
Thanks for your help.
