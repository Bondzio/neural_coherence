Hello, Ironically, the HD on my Dell Inspiron failed this week, a day after I started a massive backup effort. My fault for not doing so more often (a recovery service is currently trying to retrieve portions of my PhD dissertation....). I want to avoid this headache should (actually, when) I have another failure. I do have an external drive that is several years old, but it was quite a pain to use and was limited by the size of the files I could transfer. This leads me to several questions: - Are most external drives formatted the same, or is there a specific feature I should look for in purchasing a new drive? I remember someone telling me that my file transfer issue was related to the format of the drive. - What is the most user-friendly method or software to perform regular backups? For example, I have a new HD coming from Dell. *IF* I had been backing up my data, is there a way that I could simply install my new HD, plug in the external backup, and it could create an identical replicate of my old HD(files, applications, settings..the works)? -Related to my last question, I'm looking for a drive that I could simply plug in once a day and execute a backup with little effort on my part. Is this possible? Can it be scheduled to create a &quot;new&quot; back-up file daily and replace the previous one? - Can the external drive be organized to both create a daily backup and to have long-term storage for files I don't want taking up space on my laptop? Or do I need two drives, one devoted to backup and one for long-term storage? - I read a suggestion in another thread that you should purchase a drive 3-4x the size of the files you want to backup. Is this accurate? Thank you in advance for your help. (FYI - I tried to search for this information in previous threads but was not finding exactly what I needed. I apologize if this has been discussed recently and I missed it.)

I would focus on the longer threads where there are lengthy exchange of ideas. The one thing I recommend is never ever have your only copy of things important on a single source in a single location...whether it be electronic bits and bytes . . especially an external HDD, or even hard copy. http://forums.cnet.com/5238-7813-0.html?kw=backup&select=forum&forumID=70&threadID=&messageType=1&tag=srchbr http://forums.cnet.com/5238-7813-0.html?kw=external+hard+drive+AND+backup&select=All+CNET+Forums&forumID=&threadID=&messageType=1&tag=srchbr Once you've explored the many approaches and eliminated those you don't want, you'll probably have a few more questions. Hoping this helps. VAPCMD
