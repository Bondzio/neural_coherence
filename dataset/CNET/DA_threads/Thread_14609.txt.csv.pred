1.1.1	I have an older pentium 4 computer with windows XP Pro w/SP 2 , 2 ghz and 512 ram .	St
1.1.2	It currently has two dvd drives installed .	St
1.1.3	I wanted to change out one of the dvd drives for a different one .	St
1.1.4	So I opened he computer box , changed one dvd drive for one I had been given .	St
1.1.5	Closed the box , started the comptuer and did not find any dvd drives at all .	St
1.1.6	Thinking it would be best to put the old one back , I removed the one I had changed and put the old one back .	St
1.1.7	Upon rebooting the computer , I still do not have either of the dvd drives in my computer nor in the device manager !	St
1.1.8	I put everything back the way it was in it 's origianl form , etc .	St
1.1.9	Can anyone help and tell me what I should do next .	Ques
1.1.10	Thank you so kindly , C	St
1.2.1	when you installed it ? ?	Ques
1.2.2	They only work together if the jumpers are right .	St
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	and not afterwards , it 's usually something I did .	St
1.3.2	If returning the drives to their original positions on the cable ... .and shall we presume IDE ? ... did not work , I 'd first try to check and reseat the cable ( s ) including the power connectors .	St
1.3.3	You can also try replacing them .	Sug
1.3.4	Setting the jumpers for cable select and using an 80 conductor IDE cable works best .	St
1.3.5	As well , interrupt the POST and see if they show in the BIOS .	St
1.3.6	If they do n't show there , they probably wo n't show in Windows either .	St
1.4.1	to just swap one dvd drive for another .	St
1.4.2	Have never done this before so will need specific instructions , if you please .	St
1.4.3	Is there a specic order that you plug the cables in ?	Ques
1.4.4	I made sure I put the cables back the same way I had unplugged them when I put the dvd drive back in .	St
1.4.5	There are two dvd drives sitting one on top of the other .	St
1.4.6	The one I wanted to swap out was the bottom one .	St
1.4.7	I did not change the IDE ( do n't know how to do that ) so should n't the original dvd drive work when put back where it was ?	Ques
1.4.8	What is the POST ?	Ques
1.4.9	And could you explain how to check the BIOS ?	Ques
1.4.10	If I put a dvd into either of the drives , the light blinks in the front of the drive , but nothing shows up on the computer .	St
1.4.11	I can hear the spinning of the dvd also .	St
1.4.12	There has to be something simple that I just screw up when I tried to replace one of the drives for a different one .	St
1.4.13	But do n't understand why the same dvd drive that was in the computer to begin with wo n't work after being put back in it 's same place ?	Ques
1.4.14	Thank you so much for your information , C	St
1.5.1	Can you see the drives in Windows Explorer ?	Ques
1.5.2	If so , it 's possible they are n't configured to autorun .	St
1.5.3	If you ca n't see the drives but can hear them spin , they are getting power .	St
1.5.4	That 's a good start .	St
1.5.5	You said you put the old drive back in ( presuming it was working ) exactly the way you took it out .	St
1.5.6	So , what has changed is the cable was removed from the drive and plugged back in .	St
1.5.7	It 's possible the cable got damaged in that process .	St
1.5.8	Replacing a cable is easy if you have or can get one .	St
1.5.9	I 've had some problems with ATAPI devices in the past that are n't easy to explain .	St
1.5.10	They do have jumpers and most can be configured as either Master , Slave , or Cable Select .	St
1.5.11	If you are using an 80 conductor cable it 's best to set the jumpers for Cable Select .	St
1.5.12	An 80 conductor cable will have different colored plug ends ... .generally blue , black and gray .	St
1.5.13	The blue one goes into the motherboard .	St
1.5.14	The black one will be for the master if the jumpers are set that way and the gray one for the slave .	St
1.5.15	Again , jumpers set to cable select will do that for you .	St
1.5.16	As for POST , that 's the screen you see before Windows starts .	St
1.5.17	The BIOS contains your basic hardware configuration and Windows works through it to access hardware .	St
1.5.18	Sometimes during POST ( which means Power On Self Test ) you can see references to hardware such as drives .	St
1.5.19	Otherwise , you can interrupt the process during while it 's booting and view a set of menus that allow you to see information about the hardware including hard drives and CD ROMs .	St
1.5.20	Generally it can even display the name and model of the drive as well .	St
1.5.21	It 's a good place to look to see if the drive has been found and configured .	St
1.5.22	You may see an option during POST to press a key to enter Setup .	St
1.5.23	It 's generally Del , or F1 but some use other keys .	St
1.5.24	If you can get to that , you might be able to see if the drives show .	St
1.5.25	If on the applicable IDE port it shows nothing configured , then Windows is n't going to see it either .	St
1.5.26	Anyway , my first thought is that you may have a damaged cable .	St
1.5.27	You 've tried everything else .	St
1.5.28	It would n't hurt to replace it .	St
1.6.1	Got into the bios setup and am trying to do IDE configuration .	St
1.6.2	I have Primary IDE Master which shows - Maxtor 5T040H4 ( must be the hard drive ? )	Ques
1.6.3	Then Secondary IDE Master and Secondary IDE Slave , both not installed .	St
1.6.4	Am thinking I should enable those two with CD Rom - for the two DVD drives ? ?	Ques
1.6.5	Do n't think it 's a damaged cable ( according to the cable information ) it 's a 40 pin .	St
1.6.6	You got ta know this is an older system , but it was custom built to last several years .	St
1.6.7	Thanks so much for the information , I really appreciate it .	St
1.6.8	Am I on the right track ? ?	Ques
1.6.9	C	St
1.7.1	willing to search for the info and read the applicable CNET FORUMs posts .	St
1.7.2	When connecting two IDE drives ( CDs , HDDs , etc . )	St
1.7.3	on the same IDE cable they should both be set to Cable Select ( & quot ; CS & quot ; ) .	St
1.7.4	When using Cable Select .	St
1.7.5	.	St
1.7.6	.	St
1.7.7	whichever drive is at the 'end of the cable ' is treated as 'Master ' .	St
1.7.8	One alternative when connecting two IDE drives on the same cable is jumpering one drive as 'Master ' and the other as 'Slave ' .	St
1.7.9	In your case , you should have looked at the jumpers on the CD you removed and jumpered the one you replaced it with the same way .	St
1.7.10	Let us know .	St
1.7.11	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	All I did was take out one dvd drive , swap it with one that used to be in the computer ( but a much slower dvd drive ) .	St
1.8.2	Boot the computer and neither drive was there .	St
1.8.3	Thinking I messed up , I turned off the computer , unplugged it , opened the case and put the dvd drive that was originally in there back , right to the same place with the same connections .	St
1.8.4	There is a power plug for each of the two dvd drives , ribbon cable for each of the two dvd drives ( one ribbon goes to one dvd and then to the other ) , and one audio plug to the dvd drive that I was taking in and out which then goes to the motherboard ?	Ques
1.8.5	Since I did n't do anything else , I thought putting everything back the way it originally was would work just fine .	St
1.8.6	Stupid me ... ..	St
1.8.7	I did not change any settings on either dvd drive , just unplugged the one I was swapping .	St
1.8.8	But when that did n't work , I put the original dvd drive back where it was , so everything was the same as before I even messed with it .	St
1.8.9	Any ideas here ? ?	Ques
1.8.10	Thanks so much , C	St
1.9.1	Because your BIOS said nothing was installed on the secondary IDE port , you 're 1/2 way there .	St
1.9.2	This explains why it 's not working in Windows .	St
1.9.3	Now we need to get the drives detected in the BIOS .	St
1.9.4	It could still be a cable issue .	St
1.9.5	First , make sure the cable is securely attached to the motherboard .	St
1.9.6	Carefully remove it and reinsert it until it 's snug .	St
1.9.7	Now , because you said yours is a 40 conductor cable , we 're not going to worry about the cable select jumper .	St
1.9.8	Plug only one DVD drive into any port on the cable .	St
1.9.9	Start the machine and enter the BIOS .	St
1.9.10	See if it detects the drive .	St
1.9.11	Since it 's an older machine , you may find an option to prompt the BIOS to detect rather than do it automatically .	St
1.9.12	If it wo n't detect the drive , turn it off and connect to the other port on the cable and retry .	St
1.9.13	If still no go , change the jumper .	St
1.9.14	If it was master , change it to slave , etc .	St
1.9.15	and try again .	Sug
1.9.16	You 'll need to turn the PC on and off each time .	St
1.9.17	If no go still , grab another drive and repeat the steps above .	Res
1.9.18	You have 3 drives and 2 ports to play with .	St
1.9.19	If no combination works , I 'd say you have a bad cable or have lost an IDE controller .	St
1.9.20	You can also disconnect the cable from the hard drive and attach a DVD device to that to see if the BIOS will detect it .	St
1.9.21	This will just be a matter of ruling out by trial and error .	St
1.9.22	I have seen plenty of cables go bad or not be properly seated .	St
1.9.23	I 'd guess that 's the case before thinking 3 drives were bad .	St
1.10.1	Thanks for all your help and information .	St
1.10.2	As always everyone is great at the forums !	St
1.10.3	Good news , I went into the bios and set the secondary master and slave to auto .	St
1.10.4	Rebooted and up popped my two dvd drives ! !	St
1.10.5	C	St
1.11.1	NIL	St
1.12.1	For the future please keep in mind that what I stated previously still applies ... that is about jumpering IDE drives on the same IDE cable .	St
1.12.2	So even if you set the BIOS correctly for both drives as & quot ; AUTO & quot ; ... the drives would not be detected UNLESS the drives are jumpered correctly .	St
1.12.3	Think of it as baseball where there are two runners on SECOND BASE ... . wait you ca n't have two runners on second base .	St
1.12.4	Same with IDE HDDs on same cable ... they can not function correctly when both are jumpered as Master OR Slave .	St
1.12.5	So for IDE drives jumpering using the same cable ... both drives can be jumpered as & quot ; CS & quot ; OR one drive as Master and the other Slave .	St
1.12.6	VAPCMD	St
1.13.1	and will keep it in mind .	St
1.13.2	Had read that in the booklet about the dvd drive .	St
1.13.3	Thanks , C	St
