1. seagate (models since 1998 only) cheaply made, but getting much better.
i never thought i would be putting seagate back on the top of the list but.... seagate now has the fewest failures of all the drives made now.
they do make cheap consumer models, but they also have a much better line of drives that cost a little more.
your drive, is not the item you want to try to save a buck on!
which seagate hd are the best though?
i only need to store camcorder video footage on it only.
i don't need much more than 320 gb, any suggestions?
