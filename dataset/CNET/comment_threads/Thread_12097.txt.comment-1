Hey all, My Project - I am wiring my house with CAT6 cable, due to increasing bandwidth needs, I decided CAT6 would be best for future applications.
I bought CAT5e keystone jacks, assuming they would work (that and at the time I couldn't find CAT6 keystone jacks anywhere, so I just figured they were one in the same).
I already opened the keystone jacks, so returning them is out of the question.
Can I still wire a CAT5e keystone jack with CAT6 cable?
Do you know where any wiring guides are?
I can only find guides for wiring CAT5e into a keystone jack.
Also, I don't understand this: on the keystone jacks, they have 2 options for wiring - 568A and 568B.
What does that mean?
I am under the assumption that one is straight through and the other is crossover, but if I'm wrong then please let me know.
