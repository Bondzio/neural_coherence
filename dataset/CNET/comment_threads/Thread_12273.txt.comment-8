This device was put out because there was pressure to reduce parts and costs in those models of the PC.
Folk back then were getting upset about yearly battery replacements and back then some makers were using proprietary battery packs or making it non-user serviceable.
So Dallas Semiconductor saw an opening for a RTC that included it's own battery and could work without external power for over 10 years.
In those models there is no battery to replace.
It's a shame the make/model and documentation on this board is not supplied as I may be able to check if there is a way to add a battery.
Are you sure this board works?
It's way past it's shelf life and socket 7 boards were twitchy even back then.
