<s> Hi, I don't know if this is the right Forum page but; I have 2 computers in the house and wonder how I can connect them together and run both from the same internet address. </s>
<s> Both on XP home Is it USB or other? </s>
<s> Any help will be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> Two PCs cannot have the same IP address on a network. </s>
<s> Therefore, I will presume you have an internet connection you wish to share. </s>
<s> There are two ways to do this depending on what type of connection you have. </s>
<s> If it's a dial up connection, you can share the modem connection with another PC. </s>
<s> You need to setup Windows ICS (internet connection sharing). </s>
<s> It requires separate IP addresses for each PC, however. </s>
<s> If you have a broadband connection, you can also share it the same way but the best approach is to use a router with separate ports for each PC. </s>
<s> The router has 1 IP address and is referred to as a &quot;gateway&quot;. </s>
<s> The PCs can can connect to the router but, again, they will have their own IP addresses as well. </s>
<s> No two devices on the same network can have the same address but can share resources with any. </s>
<s> Hope this makes sense. </s>
<s> If you want to post back with more about your internet connection type you will get a better answer for your application. </s>
<s> Hi,yes thanks,I have Broadband (AOL) and want to share the account with 2 computers. </s>
<s> What I need to know is how to physically connect the computers together (if thats needed) to share the AOL B/band account </s>
