<s> I have an elderly lady friend who needs a home phone, email, occasional web surfing and streaming video (TV) - all-in-one portable device. </s>
<s> Can a tablet do all that? </s>
<s> Or do you have to add something like a VoIP adapter/phone? </s>
<s> Let's see if I can find it. </s>
<s> http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-tab/SGH-I957ZKAATT-features is not clear about this but you can go to the ATT store and see it. </s>

<s> I had a look and found &quot;Call Functions - Multitasking&quot;, which seems to imply that it has phone functionality, but no details. </s>
<s> ATT wasn't much better. </s>
<s> I'll wait to see if any others can help. </s>
<s> That's very strange. </s>
<s> They are usually very chatty at the store about the products. </s>
<s> I know the next size down has the phone, but this one is one I haven't checked out in deep detail. </s>
<s> It does do Skype so would you consider that a phone call? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I know Skype would work, but was looking for actual cellphone functionality using built-in speaker/mic and Bluetooth headsets. </s>
<s> The ATT site only gives basic details. </s>
<s> If they won't talk to you, no sale. </s>
<s> I agree on that point. </s>
<s> But I have seen folk make &quot;calls&quot; on the Samsung Galaxy Tab with the cell phone in it. </s>
<s> But you may want more assurance than that so your best insight would be to go to the store that has this model and get a demo. </s>

<s> it does NOT work because AT&T gutted this function in the Samsung models delivered for the US - shame on them... Models for Europe are fully functional, though... And if you unlock your tablet I am sure there are ways to make it work - there are articles about it on the net.... </s>
<s> Months ago at some meeting (I am in some work that involves cellular) I saw this make a call over the cell phone so I used that for my answer. </s>
<s> Thanks for the correction. </s>
<s> As this is an old discussion, it's now closed. </s>
