hardware is probably not the limiting factor, it's the operating system - which may in its own way impose the hardware minimums.
a pii desktop system with an open pci slot running win98se should be able to support the drivers that a wifi card needs.
a usb 1.1 port would work too.
for a laptop of that vintage, it would need a usb 1.1 port, but you'd have to determine the exact specs of the pcmcia/pc-card slot to be sure the new adapter card is compatible.
