(maybe hp has some super chemical sensor that detected alien ink?) with the staples ink cartridge on my 3 year old multifunction printer, the mechanism for moving the cartridge just wouldn't go. i was afraid it broke, but when i replaced the cartridge with the hp brand, it worked fine again.

11216	45	203246	2187592	2175598	danarid	9/8/06 1:36 pm	1.15772256e12	buying alternative printer ink	i have used ink kits for ink refills for lexmark cartridges with very good results, provided i print out every day a test page or other material. i am now using a kit called iprint with no problems (i have used up all the ink in the kit in some 3 or 4 refills) so long as i follow the rule of a printout everyday. i used, in the distant past, a kit called universal inkjet refill system. the results with it were equal to or better than the iprint kit. a refill kit consisting of plastic bellows with attached needle filled with ink from wal-mart was a disaster. the iprint i found at target; the universal kit was some time ago advertised by cvs at something like $10 for three 25 ml bottles of ink. included was a syringe, bottle of solvent, and instructions. the iprint kit is essentially the same as the universal kit. i have also tried the technique of pulling out the cartridge and setting it on a wet paper towel to get the ink flowing after a time of no use. this works very well. however, after several removals and replacements of the cartidge a ridge locking the cartridge in place broke off and the cartridge would no longer lock in place. under those conditions a replacement cartridge was needed. i have used a tool which i made consisting of a strip of metal about three-quarters-inch wide with a layer of felt cemented to it. this tool i use to soak the bottom of the cartridge while in place without removal. the lexmark cartridge can be parked in place at the center-front of the carriage permitting the water-soaked felt strip to be slipped under; a minute or less of soaking is generally enough to get the ink flowing. this also worked well. i have used a remanufactured cartridge in one case and gotten satisfactory results. there will always be one that will not perform well, or will leak ink, or show other problems. in the one case, the first cartridge did not work and the supplier replaced it without charge. remanufactured cartridges save only little in cost and it is a turkey shoot to get a satisfactory replacement. in my view, the difference in cost between a new cartridge, a remanufacture cartridge, and a refill system is totally in favor of the refill and i intend to go looking for a universal kit shortly. good luck, sick of bush
11216	46	203246	2187799	2175598	yukiuk	9/8/06 2:59 pm	1.15772754e12	it's relative to the cost of the printer	it's a very good question. i have just purchased a top of the range canon all-in-one printer and the integrated software will not allow me to use generic inks. it will also record any instances of me doing so and void any warranty. canon tell me that generic inks are inferior and can damage the print head. i am not prepared to risk it because the printer is very pricey. if, however you have a cheaper printer, i would certainly take the risk as the money saved over time would more than compensate if the printer ultimately needed replacing.

11216	48	203246	2187972	2175844	letch54	9/8/06 4:42 pm	1.15773372e12	avoid the very cheap inks	i've found the very cheap inks have a tendency for the cartridges to run dry - either that or they don't actually contain much ink. (yes easily 5x cheaper than epson originals). more expensive cartridges do much better and are fine for day to day work. but for high quality output on quality papers and for true colour reproduction you really need the manufacturer's own cartridges. my problems with past epson printers has been with nozzles clogging. this always seemed to happen more frequently with third party inks and i found i used half my ink doing head cleaning cycles. however i only use my home printer every now and then. the danger is that if one or more nozzles are starved of ink during printing then they can over heat and burn out - the flow of ink acts as a lubricant and coolant to the nozzles. if this happens then your printer is useless and no amount of cleaning will fix it. anyway after several broken epson printers over the years i've now bought an hp printer - that way you get a new print head with every new cartridge.
