<s> My old PC (of which I donated to a charitable organization) was an IBM with Windows 2000 Professional and my Visioneer 8700 scanner worked well. </s>
<s> With my new Dell 4700, the software is not compatible with XP. </s>
<s> I checked a couple of sites and they concur that Visioneer does not keep pace with operating system upgrades even though it claims it is certified with XP SP2 (maybe older versions). </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions (other than buying a new scanner) as far as obtaining drivers that are compatible with XP SP2? </s>
<s> I have my eye on a Canon LIDE35 - any comments? </s>
<s> I have an 8700 and it is working fine with my Dell 4600. </s>
<s> The 8700 came with a version of PaperPort Deluxe, mine was Version 7.02. </s>
<s> When I changed to XP Pro I reinstalled it and I think had no trouble with the installation, and in any case it worked. </s>
<s> I am sure that when I upgraded to SP2 it worked fine with no change. </s>
<s> Have you tried reinstalling it? </s>
<s> After reinstalling, if PaperPort opens, but you have trouble connecting to the scanner, try going to the File menu, and then to Select Source. </s>
<s> If there are more than one listed, try each. </s>
<s> In general, it is not the scanner that is the problem, but the software. </s>
<s> In late Sept I found a PaperPort Delux 9 on sale for a net of $30 after a $55 rebate. </s>
<s> I have not yet installed it because Ver 7 is working fine. </s>
<s> I finally had some spare time to try your suggestion. </s>
<s> I re-installed (lucky I had made a restore point before installing) as per your instructions and so far, everything looks good! </s>
<s> The only bump-in-the-road (and maybe someone else has had the same issue) was that it was looking for the wiafbdrv.dll driver file. </s>
<s> I had to extract it out from the c:\windows\driver cache\I386\driver.cab to the Visioneer folder so that it could locate it and then it was happy. </s>
<s> I also used your instructions regarding the Select Source. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I used my Visioneer 8700 with Windows ME successfully. </s>
<s> I was able to use the Disc and install Paperport successfully. </s>
<s> But when I try to Scan, get message. </s>
<s> &quot;unable to connect&quot;. </s>
<s> Tried to follow your hints. </s>
<s> Went to Paper Port/File/Source/ Select Source but alas no source listed. </s>
<s> Also have limited expeerience. </s>
<s> Need step by step help to locate and transfer drivers. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> Richard </s>
<s> Disconnect your scanner. </s>
<s> Un-install your scanner. </s>
<s> Restart your computer. </s>
<s> Download the drivers from here. </s>
<s> http://support.visioneer.com/products/home/EOL/8700/downloads.asp Install the drivers, you'll be prompted when to connect it. </s>
<s> Everything should work. </s>
<s> If not, the go to http://www.usbman.com/ and download any drivers you need to make the USB ports work. </s>
<s> You may have to disconnect your scanner, un-install it, restart the computer and re-install the drivers again. </s>

<s> Rick: Thanks! </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> I installed Visioneer 8700 and the Drivers on the CD and visually, I have all of Paper Port and noted it was installed correctly. </s>
<s> Howwever, when I pushed the Scan Button, I get &quot;unable to connect to Scanner&quot;. </s>
<s> Checked all the connections. </s>
<s> OK! </s>
<s> Power is OK!. </s>
<s> Stymied! </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>

<s> I have a Dell AIO 964. </s>
<s> To scan using USB I have to open the Dell All-In-One Center and scan from there. </s>
<s> If scanning wirelessly, I have to use the scan button on the printer. </s>
<s> Maybe you have to open Paper Port and scan from the program. </s>
<s> Maybe someone else can shed some light for you. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> That's just it. </s>
<s> Paper Port is there and is usable. </s>
<s> However, when I push the Button. </s>
<s> Receive message, Scanner not Detected. </s>
<s> Dick </s>
<s> Kaecourt: You are the Genius. </s>
<s> Thanks: I followed your advice and &quot;extracted out the &quot;wiafbdrv.dll file from c;\windows\driver cache\1386\driver.cab&quot; and moved it to the Visioneer Folder. </s>
<s> Lo and behold. </s>
<s> Success! </s>
<s> Up to this pont I was only able to get Paper Port on the screen, but not able to &quot;connect the scanneer&quot;. </s>
<s> Now e are all happy. </s>
<s> Thanks, Richard </s>
<s> -- Resolution -- 1. </s>
<s> Extract the file wiafbdrv.dll, from &quot;c:\windows\driver cache\i386\driver.cab&quot;, place this in &quot;c:\program files\visioneer onetouch\&quot;. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> In device manager find the &quot;USB Scanner&quot; under other devices, Right click and tell windows to update driver. </s>
<s> -- Windows does not have automatic updates for the driver so you must install the drivers from the CD first. </s>
<s> Not sure if the file in step one is required, I have not had a 3rd chance to try witout the file first. </s>
<s> If you have this issue, please try installing the software then updateing the driver before extracting the file, and let everyone know if that worked. </s>
<s> -- I have done this on 2 diffrent systems, with 2 diffrent models (8920, and 8320). </s>
<s> One system was a clean install of windows XP (8920), the other an existing windows XP install (8320). </s>
<s> -- If you are thinking about buying this scanner, I would stay away from this brand entirly: it should not take some one with my techincal experince to install a driver. </s>
<s> One problem is ok, this is why people like me have jobs. </s>
<s> Same Issue with 2 diffrent models that aren't even the same year is a bad manufacture. </s>
<s> I recently acquired a Visioneer 8700 scanner. </s>
<s> It was puchased in 2003 but not used in recent months. </s>
<s> I installed the software in my computer which has OS Windows XP with SP3 and latest updates. </s>
<s> I have scanned over 20 different documents using PaperPort and the driver that came with the installation CD and have had NO PROBLEMS. </s>
<s> It works perfectly. </s>
<s> My experience is better than the above. </s>
<s> However let me comment I run into machines with missing motherboard drivers as well as malware or the new plague called &quot;registry cleaners&quot; and in the worst case scenario we get to reinstall the OS then the drivers but these scanners always start working (except that one that didn't work on ANY machine.) </s>
