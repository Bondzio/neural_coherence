i'll explain my layout: i have dsl internet and 2 computers.
one computer has 2 network cards, the other has one.
i have the dsl modem going into one of the network cards on computer a. the 2nd card on computer a is hooked up to a 5 port switch.
computer b is also hooked up to the switch.
before i had broadband i used dialup.
this set up worked fine for dial up, but for some reason the internet wont work at all if i try to network the 2 computers using this method.
please help me!
thanks
