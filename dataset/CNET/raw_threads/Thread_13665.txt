With the latest service pack Microsoft tweaked their OS to report (but not use) 4.0GB because too many CONSUMERS were calling in to ask &quot;Where's my ram?&quot; Nothing has changed in memory support here since the year 2000. 32 bit Windows and all the articles still apply so I'll stop here.

The info/misinfo on the internet is a problem compounded by retailers and manufacturers touting more RAM than the system can use. A curious parallel from a couple generations earlier: Jewelry quality watches will have jewels in the movements. There's a maximum of 17 places a jewel can be of use. However, with consumers generally being of the more-is-better mindset, watchmakers started adding in extra jewels. They'd just glue them in out of the way places. Who wouldn't prefer a 24 jewel watch over one with a mere 17? Same thing with RAM anymore. 2x2GB sticks is cheap and easier to sell than a 3 GB configuration.
