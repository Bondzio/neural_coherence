pretty much at this point the solution is to take the drive out and smash it with a hammer because it's nothing but a piece of crap.
i called seagate and they told me i had to hook it up internally and run their disk wizard and reset the drive capacity...yeah that didn't work for anything.
i installed it internally, got it formatted to 400gb, itstalled xp on it, took it out of that pc and put it in my case and it said 32gb unformatted, put it right back in the other pc and started right into windows and shows 400gb...i'm just going to find a new drive...most likely a western digital...now that i see maxtor info on seagates website they must one company now...nothing but a big piece of garbage...what a waste.
