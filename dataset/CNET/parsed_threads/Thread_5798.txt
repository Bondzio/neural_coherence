<s> Hello folks, I am in need of a portable scanner. </s>
<s> The one that perfectly fits the bill is, VuPoint Magic Wand but its not in the market yet. </s>
<s> According to the customer service, it will be available by November this year, so I guess, they are prepping for holiday season. </s>
<s> I wonder if there is any other product similar to this. </s>
<s> There was one from PanDigital but I doubt they make it anymore (and their customer service is close to pathetic so I am not interested in their product). </s>
<s> Will be glad to know. </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Just one link google found for PORTABLE SCANNER: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2363822,00.asp Also have a look at http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_11?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=portable+scanner&sprefix=portable+sc%2Caps%2C363 I even see a VuPoint Magic Wand with the note: &quot;Only 5 left in stock. </s>
<s> Order soon.&quot; It's 900 dpi in stead of the 1200 dpi that isn't available yet. </s>
<s> Since you don't tell WHY the 1200 dpi would be perfect, it could be a 900 dpi is good enough. </s>
<s> Personally I never scan with more that 400 dpi, I think. </s>

<s> If you look at the link I posted, that scanner acts as a wand as well as a dock and I exactly need these 2 features. </s>
<s> Otherwise there are literally tons of scanners with feeder only option like Fujitsu S1100 or Neat Receipts on cheaper side. </s>
<s> In my use, sometimes I will have to feed the documents (little crumpled) and sometimes I will have to scan them with wand (book or magazine, edges taken into account). </s>
<s> Hence the one mentioned in original post. </s>
<s> The link you posted doesn't have any of the type I need but are wand only or feeder only. </s>
<s> I tried wand only but did not work for crumpled but neat worked pretty well. </s>
<s> So preferring 2-in-1 type scanner. </s>
