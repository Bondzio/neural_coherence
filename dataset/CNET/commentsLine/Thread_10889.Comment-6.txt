i forgot to comment on the prices.
there's no way the lenovo's true value would be $1700, even imaginary retail price.
comparable towers can be had under $1000.
the price on velocity micro is typical for them.
they use good components.
i wish it had better than 8500gt, but that really depends on the needs -- it's a workable gcard for sure.
