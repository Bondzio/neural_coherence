<s> Going to replace hard drive on Titanium PBG4. </s>
<s> Becoming audible when it was whisper quiet before and I don't want to be caught. </s>
<s> It also seems to be slower but that could be imagination working. </s>
<s> How does one decide ? </s>
<s> What are the prime considerations other than size and price? </s>
<s> rotational speed? </s>
<s> 4200 5400 7200? </s>
<s> Is faster always better? </s>
<s> seek times? </s>
<s> brand? </s>
<s> Thanks for any insights. </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> RPMs. </s>
<s> Faster is faster but with that speed you get more noise, less battery time and more heat (most of the time.) </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Noise control settings of said drives. </s>
<s> AKA &quot;acoustic settings&quot;, these settings can quiet the seek noise of the drive and as you suspect does slow the drive down. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Seek times. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that lower seek times can mean more ticking sounds as the head seeks. </s>
<s> Not a bad thing but some are irritated by any noise. </s>

<s> About 9 months ago the same question came up, and I wrote a really long (longer than you are thinking) post on Powerbook replacement drives. </s>
<s> I was going to just post the link to it but after reading it I find it needs some updating so I've copied it here with changes. </s>
<s> The title of the post was ... More expensive than shoes! </s>
<s> Here's a subject I'm pretty good at, because A) I have been really abusive to every hard drive I have ever had, (so I've replaced quite a few), and B) I work with video alot and I'm a digital pack rat that never throws out anything so every year I require more-bigger. </s>
<s> My virtual shopping cart is full of aluminium cans, OK? </s>
<s> At this moment I've got a 60 in my Ti 1Ghz with a 30 IBM Travel-Star for &quot;overflow&quot;, and 2 Maxtor desktop externals. </s>
<s> ( A 250 and an 80 ) I also have a 60 in each of my other computers. </s>
<s> (NOTE: the Maxtor 250 died. </s>
<s> I've given up on Maxtor no mater how much cheaper they are. </s>
<s> I bought a Seagate to replace it) I won't get into the disk burners, old scsi drives, &quot;flopticals&quot; memory sticks, memory cards, flash drives, an i-Pod, a usb drive watch, and for those days when nothing else will do, (power failure) an abacus - sliderule set. </s>
<s> My girlfriend has about 60 pairs of shoes, and for my own sake, I'll never ever mention that I noticed, know what I mean? </s>
<s> You don't say what drive you have now, only that it's getting slower and louder. </s>
<s> No problem, let's look at the options. </s>
<s> With currently shipping products 160 gig is about as big as you want to go. </s>
<s> I'm sure there is, somewhere, a bigger 2.5&quot; 9.5mm (the size you need for fit) but it's going to be a &quot;very&quot; hard drive. </s>
<s> Very expensive, very fragile, very hard on the battery, and very slow. </s>
<s> Oh yea, it'll have a very short warranty too. </s>
<s> The limits that have to be pushed to make &quot;the big one&quot; at any given time in the hard drive industry seem to have worked out that if only one manufacturer is making em that big, there is a reason. </s>
<s> Either they have some new cool technology that makes the cover of every computer magazine (IBM did a few years back), or they are putting out crap just to make a quick name for themselves as biggest. </s>
<s> Maxtor did a few years back and that's how I learned it. </s>
<s> Since then I've noticed that someone different does it every year. </s>
<s> Your stock Powerbook HD spins at a slow 4200 rpm (up until January 05), for two reasons. </s>
<s> First, because Apple wants good battery numbers for the reviews and advertising. </s>
<s> It's like GM putting a 4 cyl. </s>
<s> into an SUV. </s>
<s> It's no fun to drive, but they need the numbers for the EPA and advertising. </s>
<s> The second reason Apple does it is the reliability / cost balance. </s>
<s> All other things being equal, the faster it spins the faster it wears out. </s>
<s> The faster it spins the closer the tolerances must be. </s>
<s> The faster it spins, the faster it will go out of tolerance. </s>
<s> Consider just how fast 7200 rpm is. </s>
<s> Now consider how close the read/write heads must be to the disk (way less than a hairs width). </s>
<s> If the head touches the disk, just for the smallest fraction of a second, the drive's junk. </s>
<s> In reality all things are not equal. </s>
<s> You'll pay more for better motors, better bearings, stronger metal, and closer tolerances, but it's still more fragile. </s>
<s> On a plane, in a car, at an airport bar, a lap-top is gonna get bumped around. </s>
<s> Ever seen someone pick up their lap-top and walk around with it on? </s>
<s> Yea, me to. </s>
<s> As of January 05 the new lap-tops got 5400 rpm drives, and there is a reason why they also got motion detectors that park the drive head if the powerbook moves. </s>
<s> You can put a 7200 in, and you will see great speed improvements if you work with video and multi-track audio, or if you still have the same amount of RAM in your laptop as it shipped with. </s>
<s> Applications will launch a little quicker. </s>
<s> The internet will still be slow. </s>
<s> You will also see your batteries die (need a recharge) and die (need to get a new one) at a faster rate. </s>
<s> How much faster depends on how and how often you use the computer on battery power. </s>
<s> I've noticed that as I travel more and more, I don't use my battery as much, because it is getting easier to find power. </s>
<s> Airports, airplanes, Starbucks, car lighter adaptors, even solar power is out there when you need a little juice, and it's getting better all the time. </s>
<s> How important the issue is to you?... </s>
<s> ah, it's up to you. </s>
<s> I wouldn't worry about the heat issue too much, if you buy a solid proven drive. </s>
<s> I doubt that they get much hotter than slower drives. </s>
<s> They're balanced better, have better bearings, and a more efficient motor. </s>
<s> Here's a link to a place where I've been buying PB drives for years. </s>
<s> They are 100% Mac based, and there is nothing they don't know about powerbook drives. </s>
<s> The support is great, even if you haven't bought anything yet. </s>
<s> The reason for the link is that it points to a chart where you can compare different speed/size/power specs for some good (in my opinion) 2.5&quot; drives. </s>
<s> http://mcetech.com/ms.html Get a bigger drive. </s>
<s> No matter how big it is, you will fill it. </s>
<s> My first external was an 80mb. </s>
<s> Yes that's MEG not GIG. </s>
<s> I couldn't believe I'd ever fill it, since the internal HD was only 20 megs. </s>
<s> Even though your stock drive is not as quiet as it used to be, spend an extra $50 and get a portable firewire case for it. </s>
<s> This works out well all the way around, because when you install the new one, it's empty. </s>
<s> You can't boot from it. </s>
<s> Put the old one into the firewire case, plug it into the firewire port, and hold down the option key as you start. </s>
<s> A blue window comes up with all the bootable drives on your system. </s>
<s> Choose the old one, let it boot, and you will not be able to tell that it's not still in the computer. </s>
<s> Carbon Copy Cloner, (shareware) can clone the stock drive onto the 100 (or what-ever you decide on). </s>
<s> Now you have the fast internal, but you also have a portable, bus powered, firewire drive. </s>
<s> That makes it a much bigger increase in storage, for just $50 more. </s>
<s> By the way, the noise the old drive is making may be serious, or not. </s>
<s> You are right not taking chances, but it may live another 2-3 years. </s>
<s> I have one that makes noises like a kazoo when it spins up (as it has for four years). </s>
<s> It has never failed. </s>
<s> One other thing. </s>
<s> You always want to put the faster drive into the lap-top, and the slower one into the firewire case. </s>
<s> The internal connects right up to the ATA bus, and therefore has a much faster connection than a firewire port. </s>
<s> Your speed bump wont be as dramatic if you put it on the firewire. </s>
<s> Do you install it yourself? </s>
<s> If you are not sure, don't. </s>
<s> It's not that hard (15-20 minutes if you're fast), but it's INSIDE the powerbook. </s>
<s> You have to split the cases, disconnect some stuff, remove a couple of things etc. </s>
<s> There are fragile components in there. </s>
<s> Sometimes things go wrong, and ... well, you get the idea. </s>
<s> See I told you it was long. </s>
<s> I hope it helped! </s>
<s> Lampie Out </s>
