<s> Guys, Need some help on deciding to buy a Netgear USB adapter or a Netgear card for my laptop. </s>
<s> I will also be buying the Netgear Rangemax router. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I have tried USB and it works good but sticks out the back quite a bit and I only have USB 1.1 so I prefer the pcmcia card for better speed. </s>
<s> I prefer Netgear and if that is the router you have I would match it but not necessary. </s>
<s> I use a D-link router and a Netgear Pcmcia card and they work fine together. </s>
<s> The D-link Pcmcia card I got in my combo kit had driver issues and did not perform well for me. </s>
<s> This is only my opinion so check around. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>
<s> Some users prefer a USB wi-fi adapter, as most can be moved about to obtain the best signal, whereas a wi-fi PC card adapter (once called a PCMCIA card) is buried in the notebook case. </s>
<s> On many laptop computers, the software and drivers for these PC cards are already built in. </s>
<s> If you are using Windows XP, you may find that when you slide in the card, the drivers and software will load automatically. </s>
<s> The computer will then scan the area to find and log onto the closest Wi-Fi network. </s>
<s> Have fun. </s>
