In my computer that is a 7 yr old Gateway, MAX SDRAM is 768 MB DIMM.
I checked it with this: http://www.crucial.com/promo/index.asp?prog=uslp_clickscansnap It shows I have 3 slots and Non-parity SDRAM, PC133, in each one 256MB, 128MB & 128MB.
That means I can replace the 2 (128) with 2 (256MB).
the math checks for 256 times 3= 768MB.
It will tell you how much RAM your computer supports & what you have in there now.
It also can be PC100 but they are outdated.
