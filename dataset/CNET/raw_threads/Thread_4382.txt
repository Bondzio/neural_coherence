Some of the comands do not work and bring up erros such as variables are invalid and undeclared when I know Just the OPPOSITE is True. Can any one tell me of a good software program that will check out my cpu to see if it works right?

Here's a link: http://www.majorgeeks.com/SiSoftware_Sandra_Lite_d4664.html to get that file but also check there for similar pgms. or more intense cpu testers. IMHO, if the systems boots up and runs well with other pgms., it may not be the cpu at fault. But, you gave no system details, so support via myself is fleeing. tada -----Willy
