the video card and the amount of ram is at least as important (or even more important) as the cpu-speed.
it could well be that the best way to spend a fixed amount of money isn't for a cpu but for a graphic card or extra ram.
can you tell: - your current video card - your current amount of ram - two recent games you want to play on this machine just to be sure you do the best available thing.
