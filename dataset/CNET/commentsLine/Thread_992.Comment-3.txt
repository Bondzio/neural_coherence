go into a command windows and type ping  &lt;+ enter-key&gt;, and ping  post your output here (copy/paste or retype, whatever you like).
it might take you more time to find out how to copy and paste from the command window than just retyping it.
installing java surely doesn't solve the problem if it's javascript related.
those are totally different technologies.
it's like putting more air in the tyres of your car when you ran out of gas: doesn't help.
