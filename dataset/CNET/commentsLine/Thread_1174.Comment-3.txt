look at these from  they're two listed in 12v/3a range.
as for proper usage, you do need the right voltage period, the amps can be higher, but lets not get crazy.
i did mention those, they seem to fit what you need and are new and cheap but verify the connection barrel type.
part# pwr1207 and pwr1206 good luck -----willy
