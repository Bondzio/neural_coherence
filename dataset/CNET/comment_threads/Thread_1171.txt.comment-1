My 2-year-old Logitech Optical Wheel Mouse (M-BJ58) seems to be less responsive for the past week.
It will be working fine, then it will become lazy and barely follow my movements.
Is there any maintenance I can perform to bring its performance back to standard, or must I buy a new mouse?
If so, which would you recommend for a: HP Pavilion Pentium 4 CPU, 2 Ghrtz, 512 RAM running WinXP Home, Service Pack 1?
