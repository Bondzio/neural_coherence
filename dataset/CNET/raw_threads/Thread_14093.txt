I know there is some difference in speed, but I wonder if the common user has any need for the SATA drives. The difference in price isn't a lot, but if the difference in speed isn't to be noticed, I don't find a reason to get a SATA drive as of now. Tnak you all in advance.

Proffitt	11/6/03 6:34 AM	1.06810044E12	Re:ATA or SATA?	&quot;What is the main difference in performance between ATA HDDs and SATA HDDs?&quot; Intel was lamenting on the cost of the cables and wanted something with less connections, less PCB space and to lower costs. They knew it would not go well unless the speed could go up as well. Since the differences are documented all over the web, I offer the prior sentences to throw a little light that SATA wasn't about speeding up the drive. &quot;Do you notice the difference? I know there is some difference in speed, but I wonder if the common user has any need for the SATA drives. The difference in price isn't a lot, but if the difference in speed isn't to be noticed, I don't find a reason to get a SATA drive as of now.&quot; You should find benchmarks on the usual places. www.tomshardware.com and such. For today, for the machines I've seen, little difference. The machine produced SETI packets at the same rate, booted in about the same time and the web pages appeared at the same speed. I wouldn't see this as a make or break item on a new machine, but will continue to write that over-investing in 32-bit machines is to be avoided. Bob

SATA is here to stay and most newer systems support it and will become the defacto std. to have. As for speed a more notable difference can be had once everything falls into place, when? well that's coming, but yes the speed difference is there already just isn't so obivious. 1-2 yrs. is a long time in the computer world so unless you need ATA get SATA and as you've noticed pricing isn't a great wall to overcome, if you're planning to buy now, many a mtrbd. has either connecters or an adapter can be had, so even that isn't a stopper. In real terms, provided no great hang-up when the last great push of ATA is done, roughly 5yrs pasts before you wonder what ever happened to them and they're history. good luck -----Willy
14453	4	2044	25025	24040	Steven Haninger	11/6/03 5:37 PM	1.06814022E12	Re:ATA or SATA?/My thoughts and opinions	I have a couple of WD Raptor drives and can say that these &quot;seem&quot; to be quicker than even my IBM Deskstars (some call them &quot;Deathstars&quot;) which were said to be the IDE champions before the WD upped theirs to 8 megs of cache. I notice the difference, however, only when performing specific tasks which clock time such as backup events. What I think we need to remember is that IDE /ATA drives underwent a metamorphasis over it's life and got faster and faster as the technology improved with competition for sales. SATA should do the same but is in it's infancy now. As your ATA drives die out, the SATAs do offer some small benefits now so I would not avoid them if your MB supports them natively. I would not go out and by a PCI add in card just to accommodate the new drives because these will probably never be impressive and are not inexpensive.

14453	7	2044	47617	47378	R. Proffitt	11/25/03 4:47 AM	1.06973562E12	SATA is a 1-bit hard disk.	Which is about right when you think that the read/write recording head is not reading off multiple tracks... Bob
