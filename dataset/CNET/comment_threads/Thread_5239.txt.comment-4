Well, sort of but it's not a good idea.
You could simply pull out the old hard drive and put it in the new machine and boot from that.
This will work but it's not a good idea because your installation of XP is set up for your old machine.
XP is actually smart enough to cope with this (barely), it's pretty good at installing all the new drivers for your motherboard, etc, but the old drivers and stuff tend to hang around.
Basically you'll end up with a wounded operating system and may have more serious problems too.
You're really better off rebuilding the whole lot as you'll have a more stable setup in the long run.
