You will find that as versions go up, so does the hardware requirements.
Nothing new here.
If you must keep old hardware you don't want the new OS.
The machines that crash are telling however.
Crashing machines can be murder on your bottom line.
Moreso than a new non-crashing machine.
Repairs on such (here) cost more than a new machine.
