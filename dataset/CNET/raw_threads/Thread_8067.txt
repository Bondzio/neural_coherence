I will be buying different colours depending on the job I am asking each cable to do. Thanks in Advance

The only thing you may want to do is to buy the normal as well as a &quot;crossover&quot; type so you know you have both types handy. Bob

You will only be as good as the weakest part of your cabling network. I would match up with at least Cat 5e. These guys have them starting at $.79/ea. and in lengths from 6 inches to 150 ft. and in 9 different colors http://www.showmecables.com/Cat-5e-Cat-6-Products.html
