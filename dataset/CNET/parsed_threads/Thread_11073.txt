<s> has anybody bought this thing i cant seem to find any reveiws on it on the net. </s>
<s> its a Westinghouse 17&quot; Widescreen Flat-Panel TFT-LCD Monitor .thanx a lot </s>
<s> Best Buy has to offer something is certain price ranges otherwise, people(buyers) won't come-in. </s>
<s> Westinghouse is a good brand name, but it never was a recent electronics power house. </s>
<s> Its just another import offered branded by Westinghouse, so take care and read the specs. </s>
<s> If possible, take one in hand and look at the model label/sticker you may find who really makes it and thus take that to the google search. </s>
<s> Sorry, for now, price is the best virtue of the LCD. </s>
<s> Everyone wants a cheap LCD, but if you really intend to keep it for awhile, cheap is not the way to go and pay for decent brandname out there. </s>
<s> If not Best BUy, some vendor always has a sale on some LCD. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Try newegg.com, frys, geeks.com and such and you'll find those as well. </s>
<s> For the price, not bad. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanx for the help guys but i think widescreen would give mor picture for a widescreen type dvd movie. </s>
<s> isnt that so , correct me if i am wrong </s>
<s> all i can say is i couldn't have bought a better one for the price, i play a lot online, especially BF2 and this LCD is hands down one of the best i've used, if you have the DVI-D cable, it looks awesome, i recommend it 150%, sorry if you got the answer already </s>
<s> It's an outstanding monitor. </s>
<s> I have 2 of them. </s>
<s> You will be very happy. </s>
<s> Use the 1280X768 setting. </s>
<s> If you are making the jump from CRT 800X600 it will take a little getting used to, but well worth it. </s>
<s> In 30 days someone will need a gun to take it away from you. </s>
<s> Nice looking white monitor with a sharp, bright, colorful picture! </s>
<s> If you've never run a widescreen, you're in for a real treat. </s>
