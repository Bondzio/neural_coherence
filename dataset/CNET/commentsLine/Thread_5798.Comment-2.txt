just one link google found for portable scanner:  also have a look at  i even see a vupoint magic wand with the note: &quot;only 5 left in stock.
order soon.&quot; it's 900 dpi in stead of the 1200 dpi that isn't available yet.
since you don't tell why the 1200 dpi would be perfect, it could be a 900 dpi is good enough.
personally i never scan with more that 400 dpi, i think.
