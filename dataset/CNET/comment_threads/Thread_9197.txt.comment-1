Where do you locate the Network Key for a wireless router.
I am trying to establish a wireless internet connection with a 2Wire wireless router connected to the host computer.
The second computer recongines the 2wire network but because the network is locked I can not access it.
It asks for the Network Key which can either be 5-13 ascii characters or 10-26 hexadecimal characters and 40 or 104 bits depending on the network configuration.
Please help, Thank you.
