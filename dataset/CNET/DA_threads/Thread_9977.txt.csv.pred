1.1.1	So I 'm building a budget gaming pc and my budget is about $ 500 .	St
1.1.2	I have picked all the parts that I want to buy and want to know some professional advice on the products and if its a good line up .	St
1.1.3	I will be buying from Newegg.com , also I already have an optical drive and a 500w psu so I should be set with that .	St
1.1.4	My other big question is do I need to buy extra parts like SATA cables , thermal paste , screws , etc ?	Ques
1.1.5	Anyways , here 's my list : & lt ; div & gt ; Ram : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820231394 & lt ; /div & gt ; Case : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16811119227 500 Gb HDD : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16822136769 & lt ; div & gt ; Mobo : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813131657 & lt ; /div & gt ; & lt ; div & gt ; Video Card : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814121442 & lt ; /div & gt ; & lt ; div & gt ; CPU : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16819103996 & lt ; /div & gt ; & lt ; div & gt ; CPU Cooler : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16835103065 & lt ; /div & gt ; I 'm new to this Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Tip : Get some 600+ WATT SINGLE RAIL PSU please .	St
1.3.1	Well I would hate to spend the extra money on something I already have ...	St
1.4.1	Good .	St
1.4.2	Go for it .	St
1.5.1	NNNNNOOOOOOO ! ! ! !	St
1.5.2	dude i 'm tellin you ... you 're your graphics *might* be as good as the xbox 360 with that config ... if your lucky ... maybe .	St
1.5.3	but there is good news : at your price range the best thing to do is go for a A series APU it 's got integrated graphics and can be used WITH that GPU in dual graphics mode ( essentially crossfire ) but that switches out your mobo , too b/c AMD APU 's have a FM1 Socket .	St
1.5.4	here ( you were gon na spend $ 189 on that CPU & amp ; mobo - this is 10 more bucks ) http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx ? ItemList=Combo.825767 the mobo supports 32GB of ( faster ) RAM and has USB 3.0 which beats the crap out of the one you had picked out .	St
1.5.5	if you get this config you 'll be looking at these results : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=wJAWavcYLo0 now the numbers on the CPU might psych you out but trust me ... you 'll get 1000 times better performance in games with this one .	St
1.5.6	NEXT : Get one 4GB of RAM stick instead of 2x2 .	St
1.5.7	It 's cheaper & amp ; leaves your bays open in case you ever wan na go for more memory in the future .	St
1.5.8	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820103010 ALSO : -- -the mobo will come with SATA cables - all do -- -- thermal paste comes with the Hypter 212 - i have one ... & amp ; the stock heat sink would really be efficient unless you plan on overclocking the **** out of it .	St
1.5.9	-- -- all the screws will be included with the stuff you buy : case comes with most , hyper 212 will come with some , -- -- if you decide against the heat sink thermal paste comes pre-applied on the stock ones that come with the CPU .	St
1.6.1	Also it would be overkill and complete dumbasscery to buy a 600w PSU for that config .	St
1.6.2	Your 500 is more than efficient .	St
1.7.1	Ok , I think you have me on this one .	St
1.7.2	Your right , I seemed a bit edgy when the processor speed was clocked at 2.9 ghz ... Is that going to affect my computer speeds at all when I 'm not gaming ?	Ques
1.7.3	I can also overclock it to like 3.5 if I want to which is probably a good thing to do .	St
1.7.4	But I was surprised at how well the fps caught up !	St
1.7.5	So overall it is better to buy an apu and the gpu to get the max fps and speed of the computer ?	Ques
1.7.6	I 'm very new and hardly even knew what an apu was prior to looking it up after you showed me this .	St
1.7.7	The motherboard is able to overclock too correct ?	Ques
1.8.1	your processor 's only going to go as fast as it has to .	St
1.8.2	more demanding apps are going to be what pushes it to the limit .	St
1.8.3	i 've got an i5 2500k .	St
1.8.4	stock is 3.3GHz .	St
1.8.5	Turbo is 3.7 .	St
1.8.6	I 'm stable at with a 4.5GHz OC ... given that I have an aftermarket heat sync and k series processors are made for overclocking .	St
1.8.7	the point is ... i sit at about 1.5-1.6GHz while i 'm sitting around on the internet with maybe a few small programs open .	St
1.8.8	unless you 're going to do some major music production , 3D rendering , or use some kind of super app , you 're just not going to use all that power .	St
1.8.9	i 'm assuming games will be the most demanding thing you 'll be using it for and with a llano processor you 'll get twice the performance with the GPU + APU .	St
1.8.10	But also keep this in mind : any APU 's only going to work with Radeon GPU 's and only the 6670 and under .	St
1.8.11	otherwise the card becomes too powerful for the processor and it only uses the dedicated card .	St
1.8.12	in the name of upgrades , getting a motherboard that supports CrossfireX would be also a smart move .	St
1.8.13	I know for sure it would n't cost that much more , and maybe even less if you look around and find the right deal .	St
1.8.14	That one I showed you in the package at newegg did n't ... i did n't even think about that when i was looking .	St
1.8.15	If you get a board with Crossfire support , it 's going to allow you to add a second GPU .	St
1.8.16	Unlike Nvidia , the great thing about AMD cards is you can put two different models together and they 'll still work .	St
1.8.17	If you did do this in the future , the integrated graphics would n't have any affect , but you would n't need them anyway , leaving doors open and knowing what you want to do in the future will save you a hell of a lot of money in the future if you go ahead and think it through the first time .	Sug
1.8.18	disregard all that crossfire crap if you do n't really care about upgrading the graphics , but that 's just how my brain works .	St
1.8.19	last month i did an entirely new build and ended up spending $ 500 more than i originally intended .	St
1.8.20	okay , this : it 's a A8-3870K with a crossfire board , 4 ( which is sick nasty ) USB 3.0 's , and supports 32GB of really fast RAM .	St
1.8.21	The K on the end means it 's unlocked for overclocking , which means you 'll be able to OC it significantly more than a regular non-k , it 's $ 215 plus a $ 10 rebate .	St
1.8.22	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx ? ItemList=Combo.830595 if you wan na look for other crossfire boards on newegg , there 's no little check box for it , so i usually google the model name , go to the manufacturer 's website and find ( ctrl+f ) & quot ; crossfire & quot ; on the page .	St
1.8.23	you 'll find it if it does .	St
1.8.24	sometimes a board 'll support it and it wo n't say on newegg 's page .	St
1.9.1	p.s .	St
1.9.2	HDD prices are through the roof right now ... if you 're building this now , i 'd use an old one if i had a spare .	St
1.9.3	they 're expected to go back down sometime .	St
1.9.4	that 500GB you 've got is $ 110 .	St
1.9.5	last august i got a 1TB for $ 44 .	St
1.9.6	but if you do here 's a 5800 RPM 1.5TB HDD for 10 bucks less : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16822148725 IMO it 'd be dumb to take the slightly higher read/write speed over 1000 more GB .	St
1.10.1	Ok , I think your right about the crossfire board .	St
1.10.2	So if I wanted to buy a better gpu in the future , I can just pop it in instead of only using the 6770 or lower ?	Ques
1.10.3	Also the hdd choice is way better too .	St
1.10.4	The only problem that I find with that is there a lot of reviews claiming that they are n't working right and dying right off the bat ?	Ques
1.10.5	Idk but maybe I should listen to that .	Sug
1.10.6	I appreciate your & quot ; book & quot ; ( Lol ) .	Polite
1.10.7	Anyways , the price for everything is around $ 520 , and I 'm planning on buying the gpu separate maybe a bit later and I get a 15 dollar newegg gift card with my purchase which is going to save me some money .	St
1.10.8	I just need to look more into hard drives and I think that you have got my mind set on what I need ...	St
1.11.1	I may be getting this wrong but I 'm a little confused by those first two sentences .	St
1.11.2	Let me try to break it down : If you got a 6670 ( or anything lower ) you 'd be able to crossfire that GPU with the processor 's graphics .	St
1.11.3	If you get a second card in the future and pop it in the other PCI-e , let 's say a 6770 , you 'll be able to crossfire the 6670 and 6770 , but do n't expect 3-way crossfire using the integrated graphics .	St
1.11.4	I really do n't know about the HDD though .	St
1.11.5	If you get one ( and that 's all it takes ) that runs at the advertised speed with the advertised size then I 'd say you 're good .	St
1.11.6	If it 's bad , you 'll have 30 days to RMA it and/or the 2 year warranty .	St
1.11.7	4 eggs is n't bad with 190 reviews though .	Polite
1.11.8	I 've even bought a lot of stuff with really crappy reviews just because of the price/specs and been more than happy with it .	St
1.11.9	I guess it just takes that one dud ( which all companys will end up having ) for somebody to post an angry review .	St
1.11.10	So what do you have so far ?	Ques
1.11.11	Are you talking about not getting a GPU at all , or just the second one ( which I did n't expect yet ) I really ca n't speak for desktops on the integrated graphics alone buy my laptop has a single A8-3500m with no dedicated GPU .	St
1.11.12	If you 're running just the APU you can expect low settings at descent frame rates in most games , with others like BF3 unplayable .	St
1.11.13	I appreciate my laptop b/c I can play Steam games online at work and stuff but I would n't consider it a & quot ; gaming & quot ; computer .	St
1.12.1	Alright , I just realized that I put the 6670 but I meant the 6770 !	St
1.12.2	My bad ... Anyways , What I meant was , with the crossfire board I cant go above a 6670 or only use the 6770 ?	Ques
1.12.3	And I also am getting the gpu with the build just maybe like a week later , because I will have more money to spend on a gpu .	St
1.12.4	I was planning on the 6770 this whole time but now I guess I cant get that !	St
1.12.5	Hmmm , that 's a bit aggravating .	St
1.12.6	I also agree with you on the hard drive .	St
1.12.7	I just realized that your most likely right and the reviews are coming from the small lot of people who bought a couple duds .	St
1.12.8	So yes this hard drives got to be the better buy overall .	St
1.12.9	Another thing , I heard a major factor would be buying 1833 ram because it would increase graphics performance on the apu .	St
1.12.10	Do n't know if it 's true , but I 'm including some 1633 ram in the list .	St
1.12.11	As for what I am planning on getting so far , here is my list that I have made ( Updated ) : Apu/Mobo combo deal : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx ? ItemList=Combo.830595 Cooler , for OCing : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16835103065 Better Ram : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820211409 HD Radeon 6670 GDDR5 : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814121442 Wifi Card : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16833166073 1.5 Tb HDD : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16822148725 Sexy Case : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16811119227 Thats what I have so far .	Ques
1.12.12	Totals to $ 540	St
1.13.1	Dat RAM .	St
1.13.2	Do what you want , but the boy scout in me would much rather have one 4GB stick to leave room for upgrading .	St
1.13.3	You can get a single 1600MHz stick for as low as $ 18 and the price goes up as the heat syncs get prettier .	St
1.13.4	Make sure to look at the timing .	Res
1.13.5	EX : 9-9-9-24 .	St
1.13.6	Lower numbers are better .	St
1.13.7	I 'm sure that RAM you have picked out is gon na be pretty schweet but just make sure they 're not selling the word & quot ; game & quot ; .	St
1.13.8	You want to look for RAM with the fastest MHz and lowest timing in your budget .	St
1.13.9	RAM is pretty much RAM regardless of brand .	St
1.13.10	It 's kind of hard to get wrong .	St
1.13.11	You 'll see some that looks pretty good but then only have one review of one egg that says & quot ; only showed up as 1333. & quot ; -- -It kills me because it 's always their freaking motherboard .	St
1.13.12	Also make sure that PSU you 've got has either an 8-pin or 2 4-pins .	Sug
1.13.13	I know some mobos only have 4-pin connectors , so I assume there are some power supplies out there that only do too .	St
1.13.14	Your GPU also might take 2 6-pins .	St
1.13.15	I really do n't know .	St
1.13.16	That 's one of the few NewEgg mysteries that I never figured out .	St
1.13.17	I can never find out how many 6-pins a GPU takes .	St
1.13.18	Chances are you 'll have at least 2 on the PSU , but if 1 GPU does take two then you 're going to need at least 4 to crossfire in the future .	St
1.13.19	I ran into the same problem .	St
1.13.20	Other than that it looks good .	Polite
1.13.21	Really good .	Polite
1.13.22	Oh , and yes , if you got a 6770 right now then the graphics would n't crossfire with the processor 's graphics and that thing alone would n't look as good as the A8 + 6670 .	St
1.14.1	Lol I completely forgot about getting one stick of 4g ram .	St
1.14.2	I will look and see what I can get .	St
1.14.3	The reason I think I chose the other one is because of dual threading .	St
1.14.4	By my understanding two sticks of ram work together better than one ?	Ques
1.14.5	Idk that 's just what I have been told .	St
1.14.6	I know absolutely nothing about the pins and all that .	St
1.14.7	I just have to work that everything 's going to be compatible .	St
1.14.8	I also have a dvd drive that I had spoken of earlier .	St
1.14.9	The model is a TS-H653 that I pulled out of a not very old desktop .	St
1.14.10	Will that work ?	Ques
1.14.11	I also need to find the model number of the psu that I will be receiving and make sure that will be compatible .	St
1.15.1	to get maximum system performance .	St
1.15.2	That 's the design ... dual channel .	St
1.15.3	A single DIMM or unmatched DIMMs suboptimizes system performance and frankly who wants that ?	Ques
1.15.4	First choice is get an 8GB kit ... one with 2-4GB DIMMs or if you 're cash strapped , 2-2GB DIMMs .	St
1.15.5	Re the PSU ... .get the best one you can reasonably afford .	St
1.15.6	The better ones usually cost a little more but use electricity more efficiently .	St
1.15.7	Besides , you can add components to a system if you have the headroom ( extra watts and AMPS ) and always transfer good components to another system at a later date .	St
1.15.8	VAPCMD	St
1.16.1	Well I 'm proud to say that today I ordered about four of the main components .	St
1.16.2	I will order the other stuff next week .	St
1.16.3	Here is what I bought so far .	St
1.16.4	CORSAIR Vengeance 4GB 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600 GIGABYTE GA-A75-UD4H FM1 AMD A75 ( Hudson D3 ) SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 HDMI ATX AMD Motherboard AMD A8-3870K Unlocked Llano 3.0GHz Socket FM1 100W Quad-Core Desktop APU ( CPU + GPU ) with DirectX 11 Graphic AMD Radeon HD ... COOLER MASTER Elite 430 RC-430-KWN1 Black Steel / Plastic Computer Case Next week I will buy the hard drive , gpu , psu , fan , wireless card , and another stick of ddr3 vengeance .	St
1.16.5	( 4gb ) I 'm excited and hope I can build this thing .	St
1.16.6	If you guys could link me to some good building guides that would be great .	St
