<s> So I recently bought parts to build a new computer to replace my old one, and I bought a Spire Swordfin SP-9007B from newegg.com where as after I recived it I noticed that the case doesn't seem to have any normal slots for hard drives that I can see. </s>
<s> The place in the case where it looks like it's meant to go &quot;underneath the floppy and cd drives&quot; there are two metal walls with lots of big oval shaped holes, but no places for screws to fit and the open sides face both the case doors. </s>
<s> The case didn't include any manuals or instructions and the people on the Spire website refuse to even respond to my emails. </s>
<s> If anyone can shed some light on my problem I would be very thankful. </s>
<s> Does it look like this? </s>

<s> Yikes, that's pretty different from the inside of my case which has everything except the hard drive bays. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> Ugh I don't think spire is going to pay for the shipping on their own mistake. </s>
