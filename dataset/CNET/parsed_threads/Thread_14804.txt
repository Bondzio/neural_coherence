<s> **Please bear with me as i am totally dumb when it comes to technology** I have a desktop computer, two laptops and a router. </s>
<s> My computer is connected to the Internet through a usb modem. </s>
<s> Two days ago i had both laptops and my computer connected to the Internet. </s>
<s> I got a tech guy to set everything up for 30 ($60). </s>
<s> Now I think Ive totally messed everything up. </s>
<s> I was trying to connect my ps3 to my router, so i messed around with all the network connections. </s>
<s> Now nothing works anymore. </s>
<s> Ive followed the manual that came with the router, but nothing works. </s>
<s> My computer is now connected to my modem through a usb cable. </s>
<s> But when everything was set up two days ago, the guy took the usb cable out and connected everything using ethernet cables. </s>
<s> I had my modem connected to the internet port on my router and my computer connected to one of the lan ports on my router and everything worked perfectly. </s>
<s> Now when i make those same connections, nothing works and i cant even connect to the internet from my desktop computer, without using usb. </s>
<s> I think it might have something to do with using a usb connection to my modem, but Ive tried connection through Ethernet and nothing works. </s>
<s> Basically i just need to know how to connect my internet connection to my router, so then i can connect my router to both my laptops. </s>
<s> I know its possible and i have all the equipment, because two days ago everything was working perfectly. </s>
<s> The only changes i have made since everything thing was working, is that Ive reset my router and reinstalled my usb modem. </s>
<s> I really want this all sorted out asap, and i don't want to have to pay another 30 ($60), so if anyone could help i would be really grateful. </s>
<s> Like i said i am really stupid with all this stuff and i shouldn't have messed with it in the first place. </s>
<s> I will do my best to answer any questions and give any information you need in order to help me out, and i will be logged in all day as i really want this fixed. </s>
<s> please help. </s>

<s> You must now put those settings back in yourself. </s>
<s> Typical troubleshooting is make sure modem is powered and connected to the ISP line and a LAN or USB cord to computer. </s>
<s> LAN is easiest. </s>
<s> If you can access the internet the next step is to move that LAN cord from the computer to the WAN or &quot;internet in&quot; port on the router. </s>
<s> Put a LAN cord between the router and the computer. </s>
<s> Next you open a browser and put in the default internal IP address of the router. </s>
