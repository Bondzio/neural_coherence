Ken, Yes, I tried exactly what you discribed.
Everytime the system finishes it says that it must restart in order to complete changes.
When it restarts, it reloads the hardware and software for the intel video card.
I went on their website asking for assistance but was disappointed with the results.
Thanks for the comments.
