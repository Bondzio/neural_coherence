I have a new Compaq CQ61-313US Notebook with Windows 7 and a 2005 Netgear router that works fine.
I have the router set for WPA-PSK and a long passphrase with a combination of 10 letters and numbers.
I have my computer wireless network properties set for WPA-personal and encryption type TKIP.
When I changed the encryption to AES I lost my wireless connection so I changed it back to TKIP and got my connection back.
Should I change the WPA-personal to WPA 2-personal?
If so should I change the TKIP to AES or leave it on TKIP?
Would my router support this change?
