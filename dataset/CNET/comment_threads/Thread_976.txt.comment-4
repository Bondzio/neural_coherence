I guess that's a no on the Vista GPU.
Damn, I was really hoping to get a GPU now and SLI it when Vista came out.
Maybe I'll try a 6600 for a bit...
I will try it with the two optical drives together and the HDD by itself since I'll most likely use the HDD more than the optical drives.
The reason why I like both a DVD and DVD-RW drive is because I don't like taking my DVDs to school.
Usually someone takes it and never returns it or returns it all scratched up.
I really wish this HD was SATA but $50 (after rebates) for a 300GB Seagate was a hell of a deal.
Thanks guys.
