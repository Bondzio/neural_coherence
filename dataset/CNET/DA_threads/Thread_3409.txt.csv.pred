1.1.1	Hi guys !	St
1.1.2	I am in market for a webcam , and would like your recommendations for one .	St
1.1.3	I would like one that has fairly good resolution , maybe face tracking , and a resonable price .	St
1.1.4	I looked at the Logitech Quickcam Fusion , and it seems good .	St
1.1.5	I saw it on Newegg for $ 50 with a rebate .	St
1.1.6	However , are there any other webcams that are cheaper and/or better ?	Ques
1.1.7	I do not particularly need a wide lens like the Fusion has .	St
1.1.8	Anyway , I would like to hear what you think about this .	St

1.2.1	I got a Logitech Fusion for Xmas and have been very unhappy .	St
1.2.2	Although the avatars & extras are entertaining they get old in a hurry .	St
1.2.3	I actually asked other I camed and my results were n't that great .	St
1.2.4	When I saw very good live webcam video , I 've asked the person what brand & model .	St
1.2.5	I 've been told a WalMart a $ 29. , a Logitech notebook webcam to A Sony Handycam response and others .	St
1.2.6	Perhaps you should buy , try and return it does n't work as you hope .	Sug
1.2.7	I understand CCD webcams usually provide a better image than the common CMOS webcams .	St
1.2.8	Sometimes finding which madel has what takes some investigation .	St
1.2.9	My old Orange Micro firewire iBot webcam sure is a better vid than the Fusion wish it was n't a gift .	St
1.2.10	I 'd returned it long time ago .	St
