<s> is there a function in the AIW card where I can set a schedule, and hibernate the computer? </s>
<s> and when the time comes, the computer will start itself and record and then shut down once its done? </s>
<s> that is one function i really need it seems what i want is called SRPO (scheduled recording in power-off mode) from searching on google, it doesnt seem like the AIW's have this feature.... but i cant be sure can any of you with AIW's confirm this with me? </s>
<s> any video/tuner card *should* support this feature, but lots of PCs have problems going to sleep and waking up. </s>
<s> if your PC can hibernate/restore without a problem, srpo should work for you. </s>
<s> generally, you'll need to use the official/stable (whql) drivers for your PC and the latest OS service pack... resist the urge to update your drivers beyond what the PC manufacturer provides unless it comes via Windows update (assuming you're using XP). </s>
<s> if you need more reassurance, post your question to ATI or the &quot;Home Theater Computers&quot; forum of http://www.avsforum.com/ . </s>
<s> right now im using a monstertv tuner, and it has a built in SRPO function in its software and it works very well, no problems at all. </s>
<s> just wondering if the AIW software had it built in as well... </s>
