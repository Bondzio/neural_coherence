1.2.1	I ca n't see in your post you checked the video cable/connection .	St
1.3.1	Best case it could just be a loose connection , so unplug the video cable and plug it back in , making sure the screws are tightened .	St
1.3.2	If that 's it , it could be either your monitor has died or your video adapter has .	St
1.3.3	If you can plug in another monitor , you can see if it 's your video adapter .	St
1.3.4	If the adapter is working , that narrows it down to the monitor .	St
1.3.5	I have an Acer monitor I bought a couple of years ago that has a light below the lower right corner .	St
1.3.6	FWIW , when it 's not receiving a signal the light is amber , when it is , it 's blue .	St
1.3.7	Good luck .	Polite
1.4.1	Based on the Acer lcd I 'm looking at .	St
1.4.2	If I disconnect the monitor from the pc and then power the monitor on I see the Acer logo .	St
1.4.3	If I use the OSD ... .on screen display buttons I can view and play with stuff .	St
1.4.4	If I did not get a logo and the OSD did not function I 'd take a guess the monitor is & quot ; borked & quot ; .	St
1.5.1	With the monitor disconnected from the pc or the pc turned off .	St
1.5.2	I turn the monitor on ... ... I see an Acer logo then a no signal message .	St
1.5.3	The OSD does not function .	St
1.6.1	If the OSD did n't work , the test told us what to swap out .	St
