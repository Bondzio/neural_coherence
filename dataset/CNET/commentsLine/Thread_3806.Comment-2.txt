i have a new vista laptop and after just a little time in the woodshed to hack off uac and install free avg our softwares are now installing and working fine.
are you sure you want to go through the headaches of loading a new os?
as to uninstalling vista, that's not really done.
you can check our vista forum to read the sticky there so i won't write further.
