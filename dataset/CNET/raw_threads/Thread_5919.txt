Newer laptops run very hot and it appears your HD where the OS is stored got corrupted. Of course hitting the laptop just won't help. If any warranty, use it that's what its for. The noise you hear is probably the HD trying to access itself and fails. Some laptops have very small fans with rear exhaust, check there for heat output or any. Other laptops use a &quot;heat tube&quot; which makes them very quiet. Once the system is repaired or fixed, get your hands on a laptop cooler which is nothing more than extra fans placed on a plate to mount below the laptop ext. skin which greatly helps. If you're worried about any data from the laptop HD, you can buy a 2.5HD adapter that allows attachement to desktop system, then using whatever means extract important data for later restore, etc.. Beware of warranty action, since that may void your warranty, so how important is the data? Here's a link to such a source: http://www.newegg.com tada -----Willy
