okay, with the mobo i was going to either go with this (  ) or this (  ) with the processor, i was planning on getting the amd phenom 9650 am2+ (  ) i was going to get a wd 640gb sata hdd (  ) i plan to get 4 or 6 gb of ram... i may start with 4gb and see if i need more from there (ram is cheap enough) (i already have the case) so, is this a good build?
anything you would change?
i know the mobo has on board video, but i want to get a new video card.
any suggestions?
i don't want to pay more than 150.00 on a video card.
also (and this should be the last question haha) what power supply should i get to run it all?
again, i am somewhat on a budget.
