<s> Running a four workstation wireless network (three desktops, one laptop). </s>
<s> The main PC is running Vista, all the others are XP. </s>
<s> Router is a Linkys Wireless-G (WRT54G). </s>
<s> I had everything running fine and dandy -- all the PCs were connected on-line, I could share files easily. </s>
<s> And then Microsoft pushed out their security fixes a couple of weeks ago. </s>
<s> Now, after changing absolutely NOTHING on my own, none of my three XP systems can access the Public Folders on the Vista system. </s>
<s> They can SEE the public folder, but when I try to actually go into the folder, the XP systems all get hung up. </s>
<s> All my settings are as they were on the Vista PC and the XP systems. </s>
<s> Sharing is on, etc, etc. </s>
<s> It's absolutly infuriating that I lost functionality after a supposed &quot;fix.&quot; Anyone else running into this problem?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Check my account on each machine. </s>
<s> For me it's &quot;bob&quot; and then I see if &quot;bob&quot; can access the files locally and then across the network. </s>
<s> I'll also check the firewall settings since updates can remove my rules. </s>
