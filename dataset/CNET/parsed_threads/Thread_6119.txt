<s> Greetings; I need a new graphics card with an HDMI port. </s>
<s> have a refurbished lenovo with: Pentium E2140 1.6 GHz processor Lenovo MB - LPCIO; chipset: Intel 946PL/GZ southboard: 82801 GB Bios: 2QKT22AUS graphics: Intel 946GZ DDR2 memory - 2gb None of this really means anything to me! </s>
<s> But I'm reasonably confident I can install a new card . </s>

<s> . </s>
<s> took computer data from CPU-Z software - recommended somewhere here I'm only going to watch internet video (TV networks and Netflix) with this computer - connected to a 1080 hd samsung TV. </s>
<s> that's it! </s>
<s> Don't need anything special; but have no idea how to find a graphics card that's compatible with MB thanks in advance Let me know if I forgot some spec you need Happy Holidays! </s>

<s> But look at the usual ATI 5450 1GB low profile compatible card you find for 30 bucks at newegg. </s>
<s> It's a sleeper of a card that has HDMI and enough oomph without need to change the power supply in all the boxes I've seen. </s>

<s> Does the interface type matter? </s>
<s> how would I figure this out if I had to know? </s>
<s> If I'm looking at the right card - it says pci express 2.1; and DDR3 memory .. does it have it's own memory boy I really don't know anything about this . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> .. ;- ) thanks kelly </s>
<s> You supplied quite a few details. </s>
<s> Maybe I missed which Lenovo it is. </s>
<s> Sorry but the card's memory is only of interest to those that dissect cards. </s>
<s> Here we need a video card. </s>
<s> The memory could be DDR, static or core and it would not matter to the host PC. </s>

<s> It's refurbished (joy systems) - so I'm not sure that the components are original - it could actually be 'rebuilt' - with some other components but this was the description: Lenovo IBM ThinkCentre M55e Desktop PC - Intel Dual-Core 1.6GHz, 2GB DDR2, 80GB HDD, DVD-ROM, Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit, Also - won't buy from newegg anymore - nothing but headaches with UPS lost shipment . </s>

<s> Do I need to figure out what type of USB port I have (2.0? </s>
<s> 3.0?) </s>
<s> before I buy an external HD? </s>
<s> thanks Kelly </s>
<s> There are dozens so I can't check them all. </s>
<s> If I was betting it would be 2.0 because 3.0 was out later. </s>
