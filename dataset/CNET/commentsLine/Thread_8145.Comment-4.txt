your biggest costs will be the new video card and a new processor...unless you're using the old one.
$200 won't hack it.
you'll spend at least that on the cpu.
$130 for the motherboard; $75 - $100 for memory.
a 350w psu may work initially but you'll need to upgrade to at least 400w..with 450w preferred.
oh yeh... if you computer came with windows loaded you'll have to buy a new os.
oem supplied oses won't activiate on the new motherboard.
and life goes on... jack
