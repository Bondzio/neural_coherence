i figured maybe some people from cnet might read these forums....and yes i did e-mail a few editors.
i haven't bought one yet, because i an saving the $$ for one, and i want to see what is coming out in the near future.
perhaps i am reading it wrong but the way you wrote &quot;artists&quot; in quotes like that, comes off as rather condescending.
i am an artist with 20 years of freelance, and 14 years of video game experience.
most of us artists that want a digital sketch book know its a niche market, and are willing to spend a good amount for the right product.i have never met a digital artist that expects prices for a tablet to be $99.
almost all the artists i have worked with would pay a premium price for a tablet that meets our needs, and yes those needs are that of a niche market.
there is a market there, its just a smaller market, but that doesn't mean it cant be profitable for a company.
wacom does quite well selling most of its products to the niche of digital artists, and has only recently gotten into more mass market products.
anyhow this is pointless and getting way off track.
this post was about addressing reviews.
