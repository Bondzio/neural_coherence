1.1.2	I am going finally do a long needed memory upgrade .	St
1.1.3	I currently have 128MB .	St

1.2.1	Some motherboards ca n't use generic 256MB sticks .	St
1.2.2	What works fairly well is to get another stick of what you have if you ca n't identify the machine or if some homebrew , the make/model of the motherboard .	St

1.3.1	It 's an older Gateway that I have access to all of the info on-line , but if it 's easier to just get the same thing that is fine .	St

1.4.1	Most Intel BX chipset based systems ca n't use the low cost generic sticks .	St
