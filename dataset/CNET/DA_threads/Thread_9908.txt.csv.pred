1.4.1	but not the 7800 it 's $ 600 and PCIE only please make sure your system 's PSU can support it ( if I remember correctly nVidia reccomended a ~450W PSU with 24A on the 12v rail ) it is not an amazing performance increase over the 6800 series , and i 'd like to note that if your not going for the absolute fastest system on earth do n't get a 7800 , as a 6800 series card is fine ( Radeon X however is not , as it does not support SM3.0 , ATi 's new chip does though , and it 's due in a few weeks ) GeForce 6800 Vanilla and above would be fine as a card but i 'd suggest a 6800GT or 6800 Ultra instead of a 7800GTX unless you have the money to spend/were saving for an expensive 6800 Ultra and NO a 512MB 6800 Ultra will NOT outperform a 7800GTX	St
