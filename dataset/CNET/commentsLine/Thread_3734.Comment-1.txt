for some unknown reason, every once in a while, my computer will not boot up, it's a compaq sa4000t with p4 560, 1gb ram, and x300se-win xp sp2.
upon pushing the powerbutton, there will be 4 short beeps and the fans will spin up, the optical drive lights will flash, so will hard drive light (almost like normal start-up), then lights go off and its just as the pc is on idle except the monitor isn't on.
to fix the situation,i would have to force shutdown and yank out the power cord to the psu and push the power button, then reconnect and it works.
what is up with this?
is this a motherboard problem?
thnx for any replys.
roger
