and about page 38 shows it still does wep.
i own the 3800 and it can do wep.
as to chaining, google this phrase.
&quot;how to use a router as a wap&quot; as to your question &quot;can i just take the internet connection from my cable modem, send it through a small switch&quot; the answer is yes but it is costly.
the last time someone did that if your cable bill for internet was 50 bucks, the second ip would add 50 a month, and so it.
so yes, but you pay!
so here we are with your statement &quot; my netgear router does not support wep.
&quot; and the documents disagree.
