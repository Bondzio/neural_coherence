<s> i recently upgrading my windows 2000 to windows xp when after finishing everything i clicked on my windows media player and suprised to see this message &quot; cannot play back audio stream : no audio hardware is available , or the hardware is not responding. </s>
<s> it couldnt be that no soundcard is not being installed yet cause before in my windows 2000 i am able to play sounds through windows meida player and winamp. </s>
<s> Any idea how to solved the problem ? </s>
<s> This is more a lesson about Microsoft's attitude about drivers. </s>
<s> In short, they expect you to find and install them for motherboard, sound, video and more. </s>
<s> Try that. </s>
