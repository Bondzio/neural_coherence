<s> I recently changed my MoBo and did not account for my non-sata IDE hard drives not being able to be accessed by the new all sata port mobo. </s>
<s> I tried using the sata to ide adaptors but to no avail. </s>
<s> I since went ahead and bought a sata HD, but how can I retrieve all my precious data from the old IDE drives and apply to my new system? </s>
<s> HELP PLEASE!!! </s>
<s> I run Windows XP with AMD Athalon 64X2 Core Processor 5200+, 271 GHz and 3.25 gigs of ram, ATI Radeon HD 3600 Video Card, Tascam FW-1082 WDM Audio Interface, with a Gigabyte MoBo </s>
<s> Get your system up and running with the new HD. </s>
<s> Once done, get your hands on a ext. </s>
<s> USB enclosure or adapter. </s>
<s> I've used this with great success: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2020D&cpc=SCH You can use that or similar and access your data via the USB port. </s>

<s> I should have mentioned, you're better off re-installing the pgms. </s>
<s> you plan to swap data from. </s>
<s> Once that's done, you can then more easily copy data from old source to new under XP. </s>
<s> Otherwise, with XP it can get sticky, so don't try to defeat this if you plan to install on new HD. </s>
<s> Once, you're happy, you can reformat the old HD and use as an ext. </s>
<s> HD for backup or whatever. </s>
