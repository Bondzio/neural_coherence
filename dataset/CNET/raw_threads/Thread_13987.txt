Trying to attach a microcontroller to my computer so that I can program it in AVR CodeVision, however every time I attempt to do so I get an error message telling me that com 2 is not available and that's what the program wants to use. The USB to serial cable can be plugged into com ports 3 through 5 and has never been plugged into com 2. I'm attempting to change the com port settings, however it doesn't seem to be available in the Device Manager. Is it possible to change a com port coding conventions or to modify the program so that it can accept a different com port? Thanks.

Not one plugs into a com port but creates a com port when I plug the device into some USB port. I've programmed and written code for AVR in the past but do not have your dev kit. It may be time to avail yourself of AVR's support. Bob
