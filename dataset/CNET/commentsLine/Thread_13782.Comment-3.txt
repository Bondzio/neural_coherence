your specs show no immediate support for pata type(eide) hds.
unless, the cd drives have use of an eide port, then you *may* install an ide hd, but it won't be quick or as desirable other than it can be used.
if you plan to use some old ide hd, you may have to look at some adapter to attach on ide drive then i/f with sata port.
imo, you would be better served simply to have a sata type drive to install.
