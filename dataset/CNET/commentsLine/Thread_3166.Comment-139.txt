so, we should look for an official cnet review of a five or ten year old product to know if a critical component is reliable??
if a company puts out &quot;dogs,&quot; why not simply publicize which products correspond to &quot;dogs&quot; thereby intensifying the competition, serving the consumer, and validating the so called free enterprise system cherished by so many?
tell us what would happen if you divulged your secret information gleaned by so many years of experience, information which you are insisting we learn as you did, the hard way.
or, simply use a pen name to give you the courage required to help your constituency.
