The Media Center is a bliss and it is a waste not taking full advantage of. But my Gateway desktop doesn't come with PCI TV Tuner so please recommend a USB TV Tuner product that is easy to install and manage. I have Dishnetwork top-box (no DVR) and HD premimum channels. Thank you. P.S. It would be even better if a walkthrough guide can be provided. Merry Christmas.
