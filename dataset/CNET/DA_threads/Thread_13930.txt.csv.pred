1.1.1	I read Office Depot had a great clearance on computers.	St
1.1.2	Unfortunately, by the time I got there the Compaq Desktop display SR 1420NX was the only one left.	St
1.1.3	After rebates, it was only $212.	St
1.1.4	We'll mostly use it for word processing, surfing the internet and photo editing.	St
1.1.5	It's replacing an old 98 Gateway.	St
1.1.6	Any thoughts before my 14 days is up?	St
1.1.7	I don't want a $200.00 headache.	St
1.1.8	It has a Celeron D processor, DVD/CD burner, 80G hard drive, 512 RAM.	St
1.1.9	No monitor included.	St
1.1.10	Thanks for any advice.	St
1.2.1	thus far I cannot locate specs for that model but i'm guessing it should be fine	St
1.3.1	http://www.jr.com/JRProductPage.process?Product_Id=4029108&JRSource=google.datafeed.CPQ+SR1420NX#productTabDetails	St
1.4.1	Just don't expect to game on it because of the lack of an AGP slot.	St
1.5.1	We don't do much gaming but my kids have several of the Sims....	St
1.6.1	Suggest you get a gfx card upgrade.	St
1.6.2	Nvdia 5500 128-bit.	St
1.6.3	Around $100 at newegg.	St
1.6.4	If can't, get 5200 should be less than $50.	St
1.6.5	Roger	St
1.7.1	The SR1420NX was introduced Feb 16, 2005.	St
1.7.2	It has a Intel 845GV chipset and Integrated graphics.	St
1.7.3	Maybe someone who has the Intel Extreme Integrated graphics can tell you if it will handle Sims type games if they have the games.	St
1.7.4	There is no AGP or PCI-Express x16 slot, so to upgrade the Integrated on board graphics, you would have to get a PCI video card (again note when you buy...no AGP or PCIe card).	St
1.7.5	Roger mentioned the Nvidia 5200 and 5500, but they would have to be in the PCI versions.	St
1.7.6	The highest you can go in PCI is Nvidia 5700LE, which I would suggest.	St
1.8.1	Provided you get the rebates back, you got a good deal.	St
1.8.2	Even w/o rebates its a system worth having for awhile.	St
1.8.3	I won't complain if you don't.	St
1.8.4	Here's a link to specs and such: http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&sku_id=0926INGFS10058764&catid=20217&test%5Fcookie=1 So be happy, for a $212.00 I,m sure anyone would like to have.	St
1.8.5	tada -----Willy	St
1.9.1	I think it will be fine for what we want if for - has to be better than our old Gateway that keeps crashing!	St
1.10.1	i have the very same model like you and it can run very good.	St
1.10.2	I played Unreal Tornament 2003 on it.	St
1.10.3	i also played 7 different mmorpg games and it still runs fine and the same speed like when i got it	St
