who is currently making the lcd displays which use amat technology and where can an end user buy one of those machines online today ?
or are you saying that these lcd displays are not currently available but will be in the near future, perhaps february of 2009 which you seem to be implying ?
if these be proportional lcd displays, where both the width and height increase the size of the display, i am interested in purchasing such an lcd monitor for the system i intend to build.
of course this is predicated on these lcd displays being as reasonably priced as the current wide screen monitors.
