never thought they were ugly....who can really see it way down on the floor...tucked away on the side of my desk?
however, i just got the latest media center (n7060m) and i am not impressed.
lotsa software loading problems.
and networking with my other gateway was very difficult.
i ended up with a circuit city pc guru making a house call to network them.
plus, xp dvd discs back-up has failed 3x.
but, i'm stuck with it...and so, i'll be calling hp and circuit city for some time to come.
