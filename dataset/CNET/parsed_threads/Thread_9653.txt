<s> Hi, I'm driving myself nuts over this problem. </s>
<s> I have a Belkin Pre N router, and a Dell Inspiron 1505 with the 1500 Draft-N card. </s>
<s> I keep dropping connection totally. </s>
<s> I know that the Belkin isn't a compatible router using the 802.11n speeds. </s>
<s> When I plug into the router or modem I have no problems. </s>
<s> When I do drop the connection when I go to the available wireless networks list I see my router, but when I try to connect it says that I have a low wireless signal problem. </s>
<s> I have verified with another computer running XP Pro Tablet Edition and the connection doesn't seem to drop out the couple times I have noticed it. </s>
<s> (BTW I have Vista Home Premium) Any ideas? </s>
<s> If I need to buy a new router that isn't a problem. </s>
<s> These are the routers that are &quot;approved&quot; so to speak: # NETGEAR WNR834B # Linksys WRT300N # Buffalo WZR-G300N Thanks folks. </s>
<s> Ya'll have been very helpful in the past and appreciate that very much! </s>
<s> Drives us nuts. </s>
<s> Be sure to try not to trip up the connection by other well meaning advice such as disabling the SSID broadcast. </s>
<s> Start with no encryption and see if it works. </s>
<s> Also, don't get too far away from the wifi router plus have current drivers. </s>
<s> One dropper was cured recently by using or not using the native Windows WZC service. </s>
<s> Let's see if we can find that. </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=226739&messageID=2366100#2366100 In that case WZC was not helping. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for your advice. </s>
<s> I fell victim to the SSID Broadcasting thing, I changed it back and so far it's stayed online. </s>
<s> I have Vista so I'm pretty sure that the Dell Wireless isn't running I checked the task manager and I don't believe it is running. </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure that Vista takes complete control over the connection (as with everything else). </s>
<s> I checked the Dell website for driver updates and there aren't any. </s>
<s> I did briefly chat with a rep and they said that they are working on an updated driver for my wifi card because they said there were having &quot;issues&quot; with it and audio. </s>
<s> Fun times. </s>
<s> Well thank you. </s>
<s> If I notice anything at all I will put another post up. </s>
<s> Oh and I have read the billions of posts about Draft N and Pre N. I am contemplating buying another router to take advantage of the &quot;Draft N&quot; speeds. </s>
<s> It's been too many times I've flipped SSID back on and the connection just works. </s>
<s> It's not a big security item but moving to WPA is helpful here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah, I did switch over to WPA security. </s>
<s> I was originally using WEP and had many many problems. </s>
<s> WPA has definitely helped in that aspect of it. </s>
<s> Hopefully is stays up and running for me. </s>
<s> Do you all suggest that I go and get a new router to take advantage of the &quot;N&quot; speeds, or should I just wait for &quot;N&quot; to be ratified? </s>
<s> It appears you may have cured the basic issue but to get pre-n and draft-n up to speed most of us learned we had to stick with one maker for it to work. </s>
<s> I'm still on 802.11g. </s>
<s> Not changing since it's still working fine here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, That could be a problem seeing as how I have a Dell wireless card. </s>
<s> I know on the Dell website they advertise/sell Linksys, Netgear, and D Link. </s>
<s> My girlfriend and myself often send files over the network to each other. </s>
<s> I know that using a USB drive would probably solve my problem, but just wondering what your folks thought? </s>
<s> Has anyone had good experiences with the Dell Draft-N card and a particular router? </s>
<s> BTW thanks Bob for all of your help! </s>
<s> to buy a compatible Draft-N router now versus using G until N is ratified, search for Connect With Centrino routers since your Dell card is Intel's N. </s>
<s> Hey thanks! </s>
<s> Do we have a timeline until n is ratified? </s>
<s> than trying to guess when the Fed will lower interest rate, but still risky to bet on it. </s>
<s> Judge for yourself if this appears to be a fast action group. </s>

<s> Hey folks. </s>
<s> I'm back. </s>
<s> I just logged on this morning and the wireless wouldn't connect. </s>
<s> It wouldn't even see the router sometimes. </s>
<s> Then when it did it saw two of them. </s>
<s> I haven't changed a thing since it started working again. </s>
<s> Right now I am plugged in and its working fine. </s>
<s> In all honesty could it be the router? </s>
<s> My girlfriend is having the same problem on her new E1505 running Vista. </s>
<s> I'm pulling my hair out (what little I have). </s>
<s> Thank you soo much for all your help. </s>
<s> You have been awesome!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Try another wifi channel. </s>
<s> It your laptop or router offers it, scan for available networks and note which channels are in use in your area. </s>
<s> Choose which is not used. </s>
<s> If you see networks on 6 and 11, then use 1, etc. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi folks. </s>
<s> I just got off the phone with a couple of dell technicians, and I was told that the reason that my network is bouncing is because of my Belkin router. </s>
<s> So I have to go out and buy a new one. </s>
<s> Here is my question for all of you. </s>
<s> Now I have a Belkin router that isn't going to be used. </s>
<s> Is there a way to hook both up so that I can extend my wireless signal? </s>
<s> I know that's pretty silly to ask, but I am just trying to find something to do with the Belkin. </s>
<s> Thanks folks. </s>
<s> This may be a little late but I had problems with my Belkin Pre-n router dropping connections. </s>
<s> I updated the firmware and the problems went away. </s>
<s> I wasn't connecting using pre-n or draft-n cards, I was using D-Link g and Apple b cards but the new firmware solved the problems. </s>
<s> My Belkin pre-n router has been rock solid ever since. </s>
<s> You can download the firmware update from here: http://www.belkin.com/support/article/?lid=en&pid=F5D8230-4&aid=5632&scid=221 . </s>
<s> The latest firmware version is 1.01.03. </s>
<s> You can see what version you currently have on your router if you hit the router's internal webserver. </s>
<s> Instructions for updating the firmware are in the manual on page 69. </s>
<s> This may not solve your problems because you are connecting to a pre-n router with a draft-n card from different manufactures but it may allow you to drop down to g/b speeds reliably. </s>
<s> Cheers, Y </s>
