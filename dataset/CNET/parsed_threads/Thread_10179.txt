<s> Any help or guidance regarding the following problem would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I have recently set up a broadband connection. </s>
<s> I am using one Origo router connected via an 8-port switch to a number of computers. </s>
<s> On two of the machines an internet connection is readily available, but on a further two, when an attempt is made to access internet explorer the following message is displayed: ------------------------------------------- Forbidden You were denied access because: Access denied by access control list. </s>
<s> ------------------------------------------- I have limited knowlege on the subject but i am lead to believe that this is due to the router blocking the ip addresses of the problematic machines. </s>
<s> I have been able to ping the router from the problematic machine, so it is my guess that the problem is not in the connection. </s>
<s> I was informed that it may be to do with the routers 'firewall' although i have been unable to find any such settings within the router config. </s>
<s> A second opinion was that the ip of the problematic computers may be outside of the range set by the router. </s>
<s> I have checked this, the problematic computers have ip's 10.0.0.5 and 10.0.0.6 (those working correctly have 10.0.0.7 and 10.0.0.10) and the settings within the router config (if i am looking at the right thing) specify the DHCP User Defined Start Address to be 10.0.0.4 and the End Address to be 10.0.0.15. </s>
<s> The problematic computers are identified on the router config screen and are listed as connected to the DHCP server. </s>
<s> As i say, i have very limited knowlege and have simply been trying to decifer the all this lingo over the past days. </s>
<s> If anyone could offer some guidance my way it would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Many thanks, David. </s>
<s> To give a little more information. </s>
<s> I have checked and my network connection details which look as below... </s>
<s> Physical Address: 00:09:F3:00:E1:2F IP Address: 10.0.0.2 Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0 Default Gateway: 10.0.0.2 DHCP Address: 10.0.0.4 to 10.0.0.15 </s>

<s> The problematic machines are using Windows 98. </s>
<s> Those machines which are successfully connected to the net employ windows 98 and XP. </s>
<s> Thje router used is an Origo ADSL router connected to a simple 8 prt switch. </s>
<s> Each machine is fitted with a standard 10/100 network card, which is fully installed and connected to the LAN. </s>
<s> The problem occurrs when connecting via MS IE5. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> Microsoft has not produced patches to IE 5.0 so it's very possible that parasites or more are having a party. </s>
<s> This upsets some people, but I am not the one to take it out on. </s>
<s> The parasite scans are noted at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 You'll have to ask Microsoft if the holes will be patched any day soon. </s>
