At spywareinfoforum .com I got some help updating my software and getting my spyware figured out, so I'm going to look at my hardware now. I know I need to clean all the dust out of my PC and will be getting some compressed air to do that. While I have the cover off, I was thinking of replacing my two 1G RAM sticks with two 2G RAM sticks. (I would install two 4G RAM sticks, but it sounds like a 32bit system can't do that, only a 64bit system can) I was going to just pop on Newegg and just order a couple sticks and call it a day, but I noticed there are several different kinds of them. DDR, DDR2, DDR3 etc. I'm not sure what to get and I was hoping for a little guidance. I also heard something about checking my power supply too? Not sure how worried I should be about this. My system: Windows Vista x32 Home Premium Service Pack 2 (build:6002) AMD Athalon 64x2 Dual Core Processor X2 with 2Gbyte; NVIDIA GeForce 7300LE. Any other suggestions, or insight into what I'm doing here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

This is from Crucial.com Memory: DDR2 PC2-5300 Memory Type: DDR2 PC2-5300, DDR2 (non-ECC) Maximum Memory: 4GB Slots: 4 Each memory slot can hold DDR2 PC2-5300 with a maximum of 1GB per slot.* *Not to exceed manufacturer supported memory. Although the memory can be installed one module at a time, the best performance comes from using matched pairs of modules. How much memory your Windows OS will recognize depends on which version of Windows you are running. 32-bit versions of Windows will see (and utilize) only 3GB or 3.5GB. To utilize more memory, install a 64-bit version of your OS. More information about OS memory maximums can be found here. Memory or DRAM is the 'working' memory of the computer. It's used to store data for programs (sequences of instructions) on a temporary basis.
