Has anyone tried these offers and do you receive the software or is it a scam? I need to obtain Windows XP for a new machine I am building. Do you receive a licens with these offers to make them legal? Thanks for any feedback.

I wouldn't trust any as far as I can toss a server. Beware laddy, its all a trap, stay clear. There are far, far too many pitfalls than good harbors of safety. Check out http://www.newegg.com and other websites that have a good history of selling &quot;reputable goods&quot; at respecyable but lower pricing. Google for vendors that may offer decent pricing but beware regardless of any real cheap offering. Also, under that XP is sold as retail package, OEM, or eductional offerings. good luck -----Willy
