i made it work!
i told you this scanner can work in xp!
i took the following steps: 1. i unistalled the drivers, deleted all the files that remained after the unistall and i cleaned the registry from all the references to the scanner that i could find (some of them manually, some of them by using ccleaner).
2. i updated my mainboard's bios (&lt;--maybe this step was crucial) 3. in bios, new options appeared which were not there previously.
i turned on the enhanced parallel port (epp) option.
though the scanner can work in the standard spp mode, its better like this.
4. i uninstalled several programs, cause i assumed that they can interfere with the scanner.
i unistalled: corel draw x13, virtual dvd drive, my mobile phone's software etc.
(now i dont think that this step was necesary, but i wanted to achieve a more-less &quot;clean&quot; situation).
5. after achieving what i considered a more-less &quot;clean&quot; situation, i installed the scanner's drivers.
6. after the installation, i opened the acdsee program, clicked import and the scanner was there!
it worked!
7. i re-installed corel draw and the scanner is there!
again, it worked!
8. now i will reinstall my other programs i dont know which of these steps was crucial, but i assume that the bios update helped.
the conclusion is: this scanner can definetly work in windows xp!
no need for dual-boot, linux or such solutions
