1964	0	136485	1536144	NR	brucester	11/14/05 5:42 AM	1.13194692E12	Lost my F: Drive	I have a Sony Vaio desktop (RCX5550) computer running Windows XP with an internal CD drive and an internal CDR drive.Yesterday I went to open the CDR and it wouldn't open. I then clicked on my computer to open it that way and it didn't exist anymore under the drives listed. What could have happened that deleted it from the system? The cd drive is fine(E:)but the CDR is nowhere to be found. I had system restore turned off so I can't try that method. Any ideas ?

Restart system and check results. If it works, great, you had minor problem. Upon boot-up does the bios report it? If not, then more than likely the CD drive is dead or done in, replace. While there can be s/w glithces, more often than not, h/w failure is the cause, nothing can be repaired, just replace. If you were having some difficlties prior to this, that's a good reason to replace. You can try cleaning the drive out, but that's alast gasp effort. I leave any other possible cause to other posters. I found so many CD drive problems are resolved by replacement and thier cost is very reasonable. tada -----Willy

I was trying to delete some files due to the fact I started getting a low memory message.If I did, how could I re-install it. Also how do you access thebios. I know each computer is different but what are some of the ways to check that?

Depending the nature of that CD you *may* directly select the drivers for the CD drive in question. You thus re-install that way or if you know the product find the driver directly from the Sony support website or the CD drive maker support website, get related driver. Yeah, you could have made an error in wiping out some files that supported that CD drive, but at least it should have reported being present though not active. Check, the h/w device manager and see what it states about that drive, there too can re-install drivers needed at that time. As for the bios, you manual should give a clear method to access or upon boot-up any key sequence to eneter the bios. I suggest for now hitting eiother F1 or F2 key if so stated, otherwise find what your manual states. This info should also be repeated at the Sony support website as well. tada -----Willy

If the BIOS does not report the drive, Windows won't display it. Follow the previous poster's advice. With a can of air and the power off, open the computer and blow it out. Carefull reseat all the cables. Watch the screen when you power up. Note if the BIOS detects both optical drives. If it does, most likely Windows will show your drive. (Note that it never uninstalled the problem drive in the first place.) If it does not show up in the BIOS, you will probably have to replace the drive. Gwee
