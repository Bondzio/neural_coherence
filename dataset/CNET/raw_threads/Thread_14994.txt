It says I've only got 312MB left! I've not downloaded music or videos, and only some photos. When I check my system and data folders, they indicate about 20-25G each, so where's the rest? Is there something I can do to access that or make additional memory available? Are these junk files?

I've got more duplicate files that I'd realized, but Treesize will enable me to find and consolidate/remove them. CCleaner and eliminating extra restore points also helped. You've made my weekend -- cheers!
