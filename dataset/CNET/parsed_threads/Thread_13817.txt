<s> Well I have decided to to my annual XP reinstall with the recovery disc. </s>
<s> So I removed the video card, unplugged my second HD and dropped the recovery DVD in and did a deconstructive XP reinstall. </s>
<s> All seemed to go okay with the reformat, but now it boots to the XP screen, then shuts down and restarts...everytime. </s>
<s> I cannot even continue in safe mode. </s>
<s> I should not be having any hardware conflicts because there is none. </s>
<s> I'm running off of the on-board video and nothing is plugged in. </s>
<s> When I tried to boot with last known good configuration, it is saying something along the lines as &quot;missing system32&quot;??? </s>
<s> I did reflash the BIOS earlier this year, will that cause a problem? </s>
<s> The mobo is a MSI K8NGM2-L w/ AMD 64X2 Dual Core 4200 and 2.5GB RAM. </s>
<s> 250GB SATA HD master w/ a 160GB PATA HD slave. </s>
<s> This is on an eMachines T6216. </s>
<s> I see you told use &quot;XP&quot; and have a 250GB SATA hard disk. </s>
<s> I've learned to make sure I have my XP SP2 CD handy with SATA drives and even more so with over 127GB drives. </s>
<s> It's a minor point but one that keeps coming up. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
