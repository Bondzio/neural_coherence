i'm sure that this has already been covered, but i am curious whether or not i should purchase a dvi video card for my pc.
i have an lcd monitor with a dvi input, but my pc does not have the dvi output.
i dont play games on my computer, but i do watch videos and dvd's.
is it worth it for me to purchase a video card and if so, can anyone recommend the dvi card to buy.
thanks
