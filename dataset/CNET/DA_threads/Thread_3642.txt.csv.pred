1.1.1	I recently upgraded from 256MB to 1GB of regular DDR RAM .	St
1.1.2	Both the bios and DirectX Diagnostic say that there is 1GB RAM , so it is installed correctly .	St
1.1.3	The thing is , the computer really does n't seem faster .	St
1.1.4	As far as page filing goes , the system is managing it .	St
1.1.5	It says that the recommended is 1486MB while 1487MB is allocated !	St
1.1.6	Why is a gig and a half allocated when I should have more than enough proper RAM ?	Ques
1.1.7	My processor speed is something like 1.8GHz and I have gotten rid of all but the required start up programs .	St

1.2.1	One question is what processor do you have ?	Ques
1.2.2	If it is a Celeron or Sempron then you may have your computer needing more processing power which is n't the same as speed .	St
1.2.3	The idea with more memory is that for memory-intensive tasks things may be done in shorter time .	St
1.2.4	Generally I do n't think it 'll seem that much faster .	St
1.2.5	As for the 1486 MB recommended allocation this is likely due to windows wanting 1.5 times the physical RAM which is common .	St
1.2.6	I have 2 GB of RAM and windows recommends I have 3069 MB of virtual memory that just seems unnecessary to me so I have it set to 0 .	St
1.2.7	Regards , JB	St
1.3.1	virtual memory .	St
1.3.2	The 1400 number is simply telling you how much hard drive space is being allocated for virtual memory .	St
1.3.3	As far as normal running of XP not much improvement when one goes above 500 Mb .	St
1.3.4	There are some specific areas where a little more will help .	St
1.3.5	High level gamers know what they are .	St
