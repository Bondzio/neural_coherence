I've read much praise from Targus APA10US adaptors on other forums but I've actually had issues with those adaptors (yes, plural).
I used these adaptors exstensively and exclusively for my Toshiba Satellite A55-S136 but after a year or so those adaptors die.
When I plug them in the blue light on the brick flickers for less than a second and then nothing.
I'm not an electrical engineer but is this a case of a short circuit?
Any help would be super cool, Thanks.
