<s> Amateur here and any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I have a Gateway computer (about a year and a half old) running XP with a LCD flat screen monitor. </s>
<s> All was well until today when, after the computer had been on &quot;stand by&quot; mode, the monitor failed to automatically come on when I started the computer up again. </s>
<s> I turned off the power button to the monitor, then turned it back on again and received the message, &quot;no signal&quot;. </s>
<s> After checking to see if the connections were all secure, I restarted the computer (not just &quot;stand by&quot;) and the monitor came on as normal. </s>
<s> I tried &quot;stand by&quot; again with the same &quot;no signal&quot; results. </s>
<s> I'm at a loss. </s>
<s> Don't know if this means I need a new graphics card or perhaps to at least check if it is seated correctly. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> The monitor has a low power state activated and deactivated by the video card. </s>
<s> Either the card is not sending the signal or the monitor is not responding. </s>
<s> Swap one or the other for a test. </s>
<s> Thanks much, Cory. </s>
<s> I'll give a shot to swapping the monitor out first. </s>
<s> Hopefully, by process of elimination, I'll have a culprit at that time. </s>
<s> Will probably take me a few days to get to it though. </s>
