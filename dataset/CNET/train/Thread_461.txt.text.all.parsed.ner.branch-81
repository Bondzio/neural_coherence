11216	4	203246	2186163	2175598	gnasher	9/8/06 2:54 am	1.15768404e12	look at the costs of the whole package	i use generic ink in my epson printer. the economics are simple. the printer itself is now dirt cheap. the expected operational life without breakdown of modern inkjet printers seems to be about two years. (my current one is 3 years old but has not printed in colour, only black and white for the past 18 months - and will not work at all unless i replace the colour cartridges on a regular basis, no idea where all that ink goes to, but definitely not onto any paper). you can use cheap ink and throw the printer away after two years, or use extortionately expensive ink and throw it away after three. even if you have to throw it away after one year the savings on the cheaper ink are greater than the cost of the new printer. for some reason epson printers suffer from clogged nozzles more than other brands, particularly if you don't use them every day. on my last one even the drastic windex treatment failed. incidentally i have a 10 year old hp deskjet 500 used once a month or less, and it always works first time without fail. the quality of the print is not as good as on more recent models, but it never fails to deliver what it always did.
