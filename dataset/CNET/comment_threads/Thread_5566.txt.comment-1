I'm buying a new computer from dell (XPS600).
I just want to know which videocard should I get: 1)512MB ATI Radeon X1900 XTX Or: 2)Dual 256MB PCI Express x16 (DVI/VGA/TV-out) nVidia GeForce 6800 Just out of personal preference, which do you feel is better?
Friends of mine say they like nVidia over ATI and I just need some opinions Here are the specs for the computer if you want to know: -Pentium D Processor 940 with Dual Core Technology (3.20GHz, 800FSB) - 2GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM -250GB Serial ATA Hard Drive
