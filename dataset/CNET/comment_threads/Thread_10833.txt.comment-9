Hi Bob: I bought the gigabit D-Link DIR-655 from Costco, but saw them advertised at cNet from other places for over $170.
I bought the BDFSR41 from Best Buy as it was the only wired router they had in stock.
Maybe the Buffalo you bought would work for me?
Since I don't need the wi-fi function of the DIR-655 now, maybe using it is overkill??
The think all the n, and pre-n routers are pricey with lots of problems--setup, and even firmware downloads.
Even D-Link's technical support is lacking if trouble comes along with sub-net mask, DHCP or IP addresses.
