<s> I had a local area connection on my wireless network without using a cable and now it's gone. </s>
<s> I up'd my roaming and transmission levels but now it seems I don't have the LAC anymore. </s>
<s> I've tried everything I can think of from disabling firewall, putting the adapter settings back to what they were, doing two restore points, deleting the network connection and connecting manually, and updating my driver (which was already up to date). </s>
<s> I lost it on my laptop, but I checked my pc (also using wireless with no cable) and it's still there. </s>
<s> I'm perplexed.... </s>
<s> I'm no expert in computers, have a good sense of them, but maybe my card is faulty or i just plainly screwed up? </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
