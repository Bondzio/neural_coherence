1.2.1	is not to use ICS but buy a router .	St
1.2.2	They go for $ 50- $ 80 ( somewhat more when wireless ) .	St

1.3.1	I did contact Verizon to help me resolve my networking issue but they stated that they do not support networking with there product and that I shoud purchase another USB modem and pay for 2 years $ 60 a month .	St
1.3.2	I thought that Windows ICS and with a LAN Crossover Cable could do the job since Machine # 1 at like the DHCP server and not require a Router , Switch , or Hub .	St
1.3.3	Since I 'm only connecting 2 Machines .	St
1.3.4	As last resort I could buy a router and cross my finger it will fix my problem .	St

1.5.1	The router you see at 3gstore.com	St
1.6.1	Just remember this : even if you manage to make it work , when problems occur your ICS solution : * will not be supported by the people that made your router ; * will not be supported by Microsoft , Apple , or the people that made your computers ; * will not be supported by Sprint/Verizon/AT & T/Alltel or any other carrier or ISP ; * will require you to keep one computer ON ( not asleep ) to feed the others ; * will add some wear and tear to your routing computer ; * can affect performance on all computers , depending on type of internet activity ; * always have certain types of activities that simply may not work right .
