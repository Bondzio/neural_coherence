<s> I have a hard drive enclosure with FireWire ports on it.. </s>
<s> I know I can cascade, BUT: Can I hook up this drive to two computers (running WinXP and Win 2003) at the same time with FireWire? </s>
<s> Will both Windows recognize them (will it handle priorities etc)? </s>
<s> Make firewire connected hard disks reliable. </s>
<s> Some will write it works but given how many I see each year (almost equal to USB drives) and that we had firsthand experience of total wipeouts for no good reason I'll write &quot;don't.&quot; Feel free to try but don't store anything that you can't lose on them. </s>
<s> Then again, when I connect to an Apple, we'll go firewire everytime. </s>

<s> I'm going to try this out, but yes definetly no vital data will be stored I know Linux handles this: [Setting Up Linux with FireWire-Based Shared Storage for Oracle9i RAC] http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/webcolumns/2003/techarticles/coekaertsfirewiresetup.html You can actually have more than two servers connected to the storage via FireWire at the same time.. </s>
<s> It would be kind of cool to have a shared hard drive at home with all the MP3s.. Not much writing, mostly reading.. </s>
<s> So they wouldn't have to struggle for access rights that much.. </s>
<s> &quot;Neither Oracle nor any other vendor currently supports the patch; it is intended for testing and demonstration only.&quot; It's not something native to most if not all Linux setups. </s>
<s> Microsoft is even moreso unlikely to work proper since it's OS will never expect the filesystem to be shared. </s>
<s> Just like a trainwreck, this may be fun to watch. </s>

<s> COMPLETE FAILURE I connected an external hard drive to two computers (WinXP and Win 2003) via FireWire.. </s>
<s> Both PCs would not even detect the hard drive. </s>
<s> One at a time they would and when you hook up the second cable, the first computer would disconnect (and second one wouldn't find the drive).. </s>
<s> So I didn't even get in the fun stuff of testing simult. </s>
<s> writing etc Too bad. </s>
<s> By the way, Windows 2003 is not too good with plug-and-play FireWire.. </s>
<s> It would ocassionally not detect it and I had to 'Add New HardWare'.. Plus is you boot it with hard drive attached it would often just freeze.. No problems with WinXP though. </s>
<s> Proves yet again that 2003 and XP are very different OSs and they just look similar. </s>
