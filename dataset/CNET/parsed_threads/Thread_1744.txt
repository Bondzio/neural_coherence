<s> I'm wondering if my PSU and motherboard will support a new GPU and CPU upgrade. </s>

<s> Maybe someone here can straighten it out I have two people saying I can upgrade the CPU and another saying I can't. </s>

<s> What about the GPU? </s>
<s> Can my PSU handle that? </s>
<s> The +12 v rating min is 1.0a and 16a max on the psu. </s>
<s> According to NVidia's website; the 9800 GT requires at least 105 watts of power (Minimum Recommended System Power 400 watts), as well as (2) 6 pin power connectors. </s>
<s> The Phenom II x4 955 BE requires 125 watts of power...so if your current PSU is 450 watts, with no 6 pin GPU connectors, I'd have to say that you're SOL for the PSU. </s>
<s> http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_9800gt_us.html (see thermal and power specs) I would have to concur with posters from the other forum; your current motherboard only supports AMD Phenom CPU's up to (and including) the 9600 Agena series, and is limited to 65 watts max. </s>
