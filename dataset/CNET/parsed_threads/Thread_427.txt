<s> I have been looking around online at a bunch of stores, and i found some computers that says the computer has dedicated memory, even though it's an IGP. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> Just wondering, this confused me. </s>

<s> And there are couple other products like this.) </s>
<s> I know they could be lieing, but are they telling the truth? </s>
<s> that dedicated is a different meaning. </s>
<s> It means what the card's memory is without the help of Vista. </s>
<s> like the video is on the system board. </s>
<s> have VIDEO CARDS, the GPU chip is on the MB and it is most likely using some of the SYSTEM RAM. </s>
<s> If the video meets your need and the OS and APPS have enough RAM...min 1GBs, 2GBs recommended, then not a big deal. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> having 64mb/128mb on-board for graphics is not uncommon. </s>
<s> ...before windows 'sees' it. </s>
<s> just want to make it clear that there is not seperate 64mb/128mb ram on the board. </s>
<s> the video driver can dynamically use ram in windows to make it act like it has 256mb/512mb (hah). </s>
<s> If you are mainly doing 2d or text, the memory that is &quot;dedicated&quot; is one or two memory chips soldered on the motherboard that are indeed dedicated to the use of only the graphics controller portion of the chip. </s>
<s> Dynamically, when 3d graphics or higher screen resolution demands it' is can take some memory away from the operating system and use it as video memory. </s>
<s> It's pretty much exactly what it says it is, and it's usually substantially faster than system memory (for technical reasons that would probably bore you). </s>
<s> A 6150 chipset with 128meg (or 64meg) of dedicated video memory will perform substantially better than a 6150 with shared video memory, and have more memory available to the operating system and the running processes. </s>
