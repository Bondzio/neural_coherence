1.1.1	I have a Poweredge 2300 with a 220 volt power supply.	St
1.1.2	Do I need to change the power supply to run in the US.	St
1.1.3	This server was made in Ireland.	St
1.1.4	Model:SMM Ser#:PGLLK	St
1.2.1	I could guess but won't.	St
1.2.2	Do look on the PSU for a 110/220 switch or the sticker that tells what the input range is.	St
1.2.3	In fact, it doesn't matter at all what the make is since the PSU is a common failing item on a lot of machines and the PSU may not be what was supplied from the manufacturer.	St
1.2.4	My answer is to look for the switch or label.	St
