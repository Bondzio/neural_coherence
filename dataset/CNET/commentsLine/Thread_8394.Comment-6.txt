most cpu fans have the air drawn away from the cpu.
heat rises even if on its side, the fan accomplishes this quite well.
what may have happened, if this isn't the oem fan or diy setup, it just reaches it best optimum performance.
i suggest then you get a better hsf setup that's capable of handling that cpu but is capable of any higher level cpu as well, to assure best operation.
also, some hsf arrangements get pretty wild, so i don't know what yours is, i can only suggest further to be sure proper hs compound is applied as it should, don't over/under do it as that decreases efficiently and tighten evenly when mounting.
whatever you do, understand if the cpu isn't cooled enough you may not like the result.
i mention that as removing the fan is very iffy.
i've seen pretty interesting &quot;cooling mods&quot; so do whatever cuts it.
heck a plain old 14in.
home fan(quiet?)
can do as well.
then there's oil immersion of the whole system and of course water setups.
