<s> Currently use a Dell 8250 with 512 ram (4x128). </s>
<s> I do a lot of large CorelDraw file printing (example: 100 copies of a 10 meg file). </s>
<s> I also multitask with at least 2 browsers being open, 1 or 2 additional files that I am working on in Draw. </s>
<s> Question is this.... </s>
<s> If I increase my ram to 768m (+$250) or 1g (+600), will I gain that much speed with redrawing corel files, internet work, etc (while multitasking)? </s>
<s> Also, does the ram have anything to do with the spooling speed to my HP 1700 printer? </s>
<s> I don't want to spend the $ if I will only see a 10% increase in performance. </s>
<s> Thanks, Flip </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Many don't understand the XP DMA display bug. </s>
<s> I share it quite often. </s>
<s> But time and time again, the person is told that it will display the ide channel is in DMA, but the bug has it in PIO mode. </s>
<s> The fix is to set it to PIO, OK it then go back in to set it to DMA. </s>
<s> No reboot is needed, yet less than half can accomplish this task even with 100 word descriptions about the issue. </s>
<s> More words about this issue at http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx 2. </s>
<s> Spyware. </s>
<s> Today's plague is spyware. </s>
<s> &quot;TECH&quot; now suffers a near 90% call rate due to spyware instead of broken hardware or &quot;real problems&quot;. </s>
<s> Through a year of spyware calls the common issue is the continued use of Internet Explorer as the person's only browser. </s>
<s> Sadly with Firefox or Mozilla they could have avoided the service call. </s>
<s> Bottom line? </s>
<s> No spyware or don't complain. </s>
<s> http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm notes retail software that adds insult to injury to those that pay for removal software. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Finally, when steps 1 and 2 are complete a trip to Black Viper's web page about services and more can reduce what a machine is doing and give back both RAM and CPU cycles. </s>
<s> I use most of what he wrote to have my old laptop running circles around new laptops that have 2X the RAM and GHz. </s>

<s> Adding RAM. </s>
<s> While it's not loading that many 10M JPEG images, we did a real interesting test on our DVD rendering boxes. </s>
<s> There were 2 exact clones built for this with identical CPUs, boards, drives OS, settings and Video. </s>
<s> They diverged in that one had 512MB, the other had 1.0G RAM. </s>
<s> On the 6 hour render, the 1GB machine finished 5 minutes sooned. </s>
<s> We then moved a 512MB stick to the other machine and it finished 5 minutes sooner and the other machine went back to 6 hours. </s>
<s> For this application and setup, the payoff was so minuscule it was not funny. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> However, any more ram is a plus. </s>
<s> With the XP OS, having above 512mb is *real desirable* while the payback may not be huge you certainly benefit from it. </s>
<s> While windoze can mutlitask, if you have alot going on you really dimimish the results as resources are used elsewhere, try to keep this to a minmium if results are needed right away. </s>
<s> Overall, you system maybe bested served is having whatever &quot;tweeks&quot; are needed to jug along. </s>
<s> Besides the Black Viper website, try this one as well: http://www.dougknox.com for your OS. </s>
<s> As for your printer once you handoff a printing task, it suppose to fulfill it on its own resources. </s>
<s> The system provides initial spooling but repeats should go smoother. </s>
<s> However, the larger the task the more difficult it becomes and if the printer has to slow down it bottlenecks back tomthe system to &quot;wait&quot; and if it waits, it will fill-up the spooler quickly. </s>
<s> if you do alot of this you may want to invest in a &quot;buffer box&quot; to dump tasks into its own memory or increase the printer's memory, if applicable. </s>
<s> Usually, inkjets aren't memory upgradable, thus the buffer box. </s>
<s> Look at Buffalo product line in what they offer and similar vendors. </s>
<s> Under the printer's spool setting, check to see if you have RAW selected, it should print faster. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> appreciate it </s>
<s> you need to find some new ram. </s>
<s> You should be able to get a 256MB stick of PC-3200 for $19. </s>
<s> Go to tigerdirect.com and buy 256 megs of Ultra memory (Ultra is the brand name). </s>
