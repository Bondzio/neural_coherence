i have an 80 gig hard drive salvaged from a digital video recorder.
can't seem to use in pc.
it is discovered during bootup but has other than pc fat file system.
will not fdisk.
can this drive be partioned and formatted for a pc.
i've tried a few partitioning programs with this drive as a slave drive.
any help is appreciated.
