Now, when overclocking with the 6600 I couldn't get it to go past 3.0Ghz (just wont boot past the windows logo screen), so I left it alone, figuring it was the just the chip. But after upgrading, I have the same problem with he q9400, even though I know for a fact that the q9400 can be overclocked a lot higher. Can anyone help me!? I overclock through the BIOS btw. Also, when sitting idle, the cpu drops to 2Ghz, but when I start an app, or do anything, it jumps back up to 2.66Ghz. Maybe that has something to do with it? System: EVGA 780i mobo Intel q9400 (2.66Ghz) with Asetek Liquid Cooling 8GB pc6400 OCZ/Corsair Ram nVidia 9800 GTX+ OC 1TB HDD

Just because you can OC, you basically find a level that can be sustained/stable. Meaning, you can't go beyond a certain point w/o causing problems. Thus, your results are less than you expect. Further, some mtrbds. even OC friendly maybe lacking in that those components are capable as expected when you reach the top levels. Understand also, you may need to configure the cpu voltage besides the FSB, etc.. Also, your PSU should be a brute and provide every voltage as stable as possible. This is all a careful balancing act and each increase done one step at a time until the best output can be had. Of you had problems with the 6600, the most friendly of OC'able cpus then your problem lays elsewhere, IMHO. tada -----Willy
