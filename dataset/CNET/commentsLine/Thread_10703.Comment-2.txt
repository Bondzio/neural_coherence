provided the warranty allows this, many don't, open the case and be sure the noise is from the hd.
-or- simply request warranty now before time goes by.
the noise could be from a fan, or a lousy mounting of the hd as it causes &quot;vibration&quot; upon the metal to metal contact.
either way, warranty should cover it.
no way should the hd be the source of noise of any kind, but lets not be too picky, if its more of a whine type noise and not real grinding, etc.. find the maker of the hd and goto thier support website and get thier diagnostic tools to determine or any hp may provide.
