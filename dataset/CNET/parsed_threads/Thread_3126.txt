<s> Hi, I'm a student, and I am in need of a new comp for christmas. </s>
<s> I am considering a fast computer (Core 2 duo) that can run many apps. </s>
<s> I was looking at the 20 inch imac and the slim xps desktop for dell. </s>
<s> I am not sure what desktop to get. </s>
<s> Do you guys have any suggestions of a desktop that is perfect for fast performance? </s>
<s> I also want to play a little games. </s>
<s> I don't want to waste my money and crappy computer so what is a good one? </s>
<s> core 2 duo at least 1 gb ram 250 above gb hard drive GOOD graphics card THANKS </s>
<s> answered your own question with the specs you have listed. </s>
<s> Some other suggestions, The Ram should be DDR2 and an 256MB video card. </s>
<s> a PCI-E slot be available for future video upgrades. </s>
<s> As for the Manf. </s>
<s> I can't help on that one as I have been building my own for years. </s>
<s> I would go with A PC for gaming. </s>
<s> It's a whole lot easier to have it upfront than to try to add/upgrade later. </s>
