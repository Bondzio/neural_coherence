<s> i am experiencing a problem with my wireless, the only time it ever cuts out is when i play a game such as counter strike and even sometimes when i fullscreen a video on youtube. </s>
<s> please help. </s>
<s> i am running windows xp pro. </s>
<s> belkin wireless g router and wireless network adapter. </s>
<s> Set it up like our forum sticky asks? </s>
<s> If not, tell what you chose as your settings. </s>
<s> i had it set up like it says but i called tech support and they told me to disable the security settings, but im starting to doubt what they say. </s>
<s> so i went to change it back and i did, now my wireless internet wont connect and when i try to change it, my WIRED computer which i am using to change the setting keeps disconnecting, sometimes it says little or no connectivity or network cable unplugged, stop trying to change setting, internet works fine, i am stumped, any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Then you have bad cables, router, bum OS install, bad drivers etc. </s>
<s> It is not a simple issue to diagnose but at least we can tell where to start. </s>
<s> The cables. </s>
<s> Try another one. </s>

<s> it stopped dropping and i set the security settings back to disabled and my wireless picked back up, do i have to have it enabled to fix the main problem? </s>
<s> There are people who MOOCH off unsecured networks to download via P2P networks. </s>
<s> Some routers will behave oddly like yours when the moochers are using your network. </s>
<s> Looking in the router logs won't help. </s>
<s> The test I use is to leave the router set as the customer left it (insecure) and turn off all the owners PCs, etc. </s>
<s> If we still see the lights blinking like mad uploading and downloading then we know we have a moocher. </s>
