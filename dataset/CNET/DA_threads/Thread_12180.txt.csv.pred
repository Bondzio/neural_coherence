1.1.1	I have a Dell Dimension V350 ( win95 ) that is run occasionally and complained about lost date and time settings - so I replaced the CMOS battery .	St
1.1.2	Now it wo n't boot On power up fans and hd starts spinning and display lits up saying : PhoenixBIOS 4.0 Release 6.0 Copyright 1985-1998 Phoenix Technologies Ltd. All Rights Reserved Copyright 1985-1998 Intel Corporation .	St
1.1.3	4A4RB0X0.10A.0018.P06 Dell Dimension V350 BIOS Version A05 Pentium II processor 350 MHz 64 MB System RAM Press & lt ; DEL & gt ; to enter SETUP then nothing happens and it does n't respond to & lt ; DEL & gt ; .	St
1.1.4	& lt ; Ctrl-Alt-Del & gt ; restarts the process but it ends up in the same spot .	St
1.1.5	If I hit & lt ; Del & gt ; while it is counting memory up to 64 MB it instead ends up with Entering SETUP ... on the bottom of the screen and nothing happens .	St
1.1.6	Only response I get is a beep when hitting & lt ; any key & gt ; after that I have hit it several times before .	St
1.1.7	I 'm a little puzzled over that it only counts up to 64 MB as it is equipped with two memory chips labelled & quot ; PC100-322-620 & quot ; which I belive are of 128 MB each .	St
1.1.8	Removing one or the other of them stops the counting at 32 MB .	St
1.1.9	I 'd be much obliged for any help on this , CT	St
1.2.1	Those older machines often had the SETUP application on the HDD .	St
1.2.2	Later it was moved to the BIOS .	St
1.2.3	There are also a lot of rules about memory that will be hard to relay over a forum but nothing sounds wrong with your observations so far .	St
1.2.4	That 's how it worked back then .	St
1.2.5	You should find old hardware that has issues with RAM like that .	St
1.2.6	Again , nothing is wrong here .	St
1.2.7	It was limitations of chips , chip select lines and more .	St
1.2.8	So moving on ...	St
1.2.9	It 's possible that dell has some setup app on floppy media .	St
1.2.10	You 'll have to look for that .	St
1.2.11	Bob	St
1.3.1	Do this all again and just wait .	St
1.3.2	This is an older system and it sees an error , but your pressing keys and such is causing other issues .	St
1.3.3	Allow it to error out and then reconfigure the bios because that has changed .	St
1.3.4	Which is the reason it ca n't boot ( errors ) .	St
1.3.5	So , next time when it displays enter SETUP , wait at least 10-15mins .	St
1.3.6	Enjoy soda or coffee until then .	St
1.3.7	Report back results .	St
1.3.8	Also , this being an older older PC , it may need a floppy disk in order to reset bios setting or get into them , but this is so long ago for me , it may not apply to Dells but did for other OEM type PCs .	St
1.3.9	With power-OFF , you may want to reseat the RAM sticks .	St
1.3.10	Doing so may clear the count-up problem or that 64mb you see may refer to video ram amount .	St
1.3.11	Plus , it just takes longer for a V350 system and all .	St
1.3.12	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
1.4.1	Thanks Bob , It 's good to hear that the behaviour is normal up to the point were it gets stuck .	St
1.4.2	But I havent been able to get beyound that point .	St
1.4.3	See also my response to Willy below .	St
1.5.1	Thanks Willy , I 've given it plenty of time , while having a meal myself , but it just stands there .	St
1.5.2	And I 've fed it a floppy & quot ; CD-ROM Setup Boot DIsk & quot ; and left it both as Press & lt ; DEL & gt ; to enter SETUP or as Entering SETUP ... but it does n't even try to read the floppy .	St
1.5.3	( I also got a floppy with Dell Dimension Vxxx/Vxxxc A08 FlashBIOS but as long as floppies are n't read it 's not of much use . )	St
1.5.4	I reseated the memory chips earlier to exclude that they were causing the error but it did n't change anything other than the amount of memory being counted .	St
1.5.5	Suggestions ?	Ques
1.5.6	Is there a point in removing the CMOS battery again ?	Ques
1.5.7	CT	St
1.6.1	Those days where the CMOS setup was on floppy .	St
1.6.2	Even back then you did n't pull the battery to reset the BIOS settings , are you sure there is n't some reset bios jumper ?	Ques
1.6.3	Also , start supplying links to the documentation so folk can check out if there is that floppy setup requirement .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	and dusted it off .	St
1.7.2	Inside was an explanation of the four LED and the status they had indicated & quot ; The microprocessor has failed a BIOS test. & quot ; , not very uplifting .	St
1.7.3	Anyhow , I took your advice and identified one single jumper , also mentioned in manual , and moved it to Maintenance mode .	St
1.7.4	Voila !	St
1.7.5	the computer started and displayed a Maintenance screen .	St
1.7.6	I set the date and time , saved and exit .	St
1.7.7	Moved the jumper back to Normal mode and restarted .	St
1.7.8	Guess what ?	Ques
1.7.9	It resumed operations as before .	St
1.7.10	It 's strange though that the date-time setting can cause such boot problems .	St
1.7.11	But I 'm happy that it 's up and running , cause setting up the same peripherals on another computer would have been a challenge , even with the backups .	St
1.7.12	Thanks , I 'm much obliged , C-T	St
1.8.1	Keep in mind that such machines were in transition back then with what you found in addition to what I wrote .	St
1.8.2	Nothing is certain back in those days and since the internet was just arriving , you might not find online docs so folk have to scan and put up those docs for others .	St
1.8.3	Good to read you found that jumper .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
