a 9800gx2 will work with any motherboard with a pci-express x16 slot (and your mobo definitely has at least one since it's based on the x38 chipset).
the real question is will it fit in your case since they're very long cards.
also, it's easier to get help if you just post the mobo make/model rather than the &quot;specification&quot;.
