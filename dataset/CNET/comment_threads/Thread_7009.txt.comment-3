I agree on the setup.
Are all the units the same?
My set up is now a motorola modem from a cable company and a Cisco 800 gateway.
Now I would like to find a router under $200 that will give the best and reliable results on today new technology, under that price.
I realize there are better quality unit at a higher price.
I need to replace my old linksys router.
Do you or any one else can share their results with their router?
