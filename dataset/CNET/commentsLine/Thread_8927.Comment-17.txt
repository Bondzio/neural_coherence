don't forget that crt technology still provides the best quality image.
in terms of black level, contrast, and quality of images and motion, top crt sets are better than any plasma or lcd display.
unfortunately crt's negatives are heavy weight and limited size.
top of the line crt tv sets are only 37 inches, and weigh up to 200 lbs.
but the image is outstanding.
