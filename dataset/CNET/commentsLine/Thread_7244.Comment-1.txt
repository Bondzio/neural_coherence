i am checking(resurrecting) a friend's compaq lte5300.
it is running 98se.
everything seems to be fine except the battery.
if a 1.2g hdd and 32mb of ram can be called fine.
anyway, the laptop has been in a closet for about 2 years.
has nimh battery.
ac adaptor works okay and shows charging.
problem is, it is veeery slow.
6% in 24 hrs.
if charger is disconnected, computer dies and charge immediately drops.
should i consider battery dead, or will it just take time to reconstitute the battery, if possible.
i know the laptop is just a toy and usuable for much(except maybe loading smoothwall and making a hardware firewall).
