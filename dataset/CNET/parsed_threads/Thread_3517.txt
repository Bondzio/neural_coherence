<s> I'm running Windows XP and i just bought a Wireless G PCI network adapter, i have disabled the linksys software and am using Windows XP to manage my connections. </s>
<s> So i was wondering if there was a way to get the linksys software off of my computer and still be able to use the adapter. </s>
<s> There are no options to close the icon when right clicked, nor is there a menu to block it from . </s>
<s> I tried uninstalling the software but that uninstalled the hardware as well, is there any other way that i can get this annoying software off my taskbar? </s>
<s> installing the drivers from the Linksys disk without installing their software? </s>
<s> No, how would i go about doing that? </s>
<s> Would i just explore the CD with explorer and then open the drivers folder? </s>
<s> you can do that. </s>
<s> When you install hardware and it asks you if you have a disk, click Yes and point it to the .inf file. </s>
