Sounds like your laptop is missing the required drivers for the Motherboard, not Windows drivers!
Check your system, using the Control Panel, Device Manager and look for the USB tab.
If it has a question mark of 'x' beside it, you need to install the machines drivers, so that the computer itself can recognize the ports.
Download the required driver from the manufacturers website and install them, or (after downloading), Update the drivers from the control panel, using the download.
Should work perfectly after that MarkinTO
