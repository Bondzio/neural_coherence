<s> Apple is being very shady with there extended repair program for emac's I have a emac that had been freezing since late fall so for two months i called then and paid for techinical support they told me to go to the store and buy new pather disks which the stores dont sell. </s>
<s> I described to at least 4 different tech support people my problem none told me about the extention repair problem. </s>
<s> Finally during christmas break i on a wiff typed in freezing emacs and came to a bunch of disscussion boards about the problem. </s>
<s> I called Apple and the tech guy acted like he did not know what I was talking bout I had to guide him through to the web page. </s>
<s> Finally he put on his supervisor and the guy got smart with me. </s>
<s> He told me when i asked him for a case number to take to the Apple Service Providers that I dont need one because it is public knowledge, I was like that is funny I just talked to a apple tech and he did not know what it was. </s>
<s> Anypoint, that is great that they are going to fix the project but dont be shady and what sucks the worse I have to wait at least 3 weeks before i get my computer back. </s>
<s> If Apple thinks I am going to buy a Iphone they are crazy </s>
<s> It is always a good idea, when talking to Tech Support (any Tech Support) to get a case number. </s>
<s> This number establishes your problem, records it with the company, and if the problem drags on and on, you have proof of when the problem first started. </s>
<s> Insist on a case number. </s>
<s> Glad they decided to fix it for you P </s>
