<s> Hi all, Need some info as to how to reuse an IDE drive w/out wiping it clean and reloading everything. </s>
<s> I just replaced my old 40GB IDE drive with a new 250GB SATA drive. </s>
<s> Problem is, I have a 120GB IDE drive that was the slave and was used only for storage. </s>
<s> My question is, can I just reconnect the 120GB (left in the &quot;slave&quot; configuration) and keep using it for storage without having to wipe it and if so, how do I go about doing it? </s>
<s> Is there a good resource out there that I can reference that will lay it out for me step-by-step? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> What I would do is install the 250GB SATA drive as the only drive in the computer. </s>
<s> Next, perform a clean install your operating system on the SATA drive. </s>
<s> During installation, Windows may ask you to press F6 to insert a floppy with a SATA driver--your computer or motherboard should have come with a driver disk. </s>
<s> If not, you should be able to download the driver from your motherboard or computer manufacturer. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> What is the manufacturer and model name of the 120GB drive? </s>
<s> You should be able to find an installation guide for the 120GB HD on the manufacturer's website. </s>
<s> Many hard drives perform better as Masters. </s>
<s> I would change the jumper on the pins on the back of the 120GB drive to the master position (or Cable Select) and install the drive at the end of the IDE cable. </s>
<s> On the HD, there is usually a diagram describing how to jumper it for master, slave, or cable select. </s>

<s> The only drive that will be ''wiped'' is the drive on which you install your operating system. </s>
<s> That is why I recommended having only the 250GB HD installed when you go to install your operating system. </s>
<s> That way, there will be no possibility of losing your storage files by accidentaly installing the operating system on the wrong drive. </s>
<s> You da man! </s>
<s> Works great! </s>
