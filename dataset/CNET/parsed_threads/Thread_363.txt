<s> I don't know much about them, But i was wondering if anyone knew of any Wireless routers with lan connections, were the wireless part can be turned off and on by pressing say a switch? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help </s>
<s> Then I added the WAP. </s>
<s> This would be like today's modern WIFI router but with the external WAP I could turn off the wifi just but removing the WAP's power. </s>
<s> This meets your &quot;spec.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> They have four wired ports and wireless. </s>
<s> To turn off wireless you enter the router configuration, looks like a web page, navigate to the wireless settings, and click the off button. </s>
<s> Dose going into settings actually turn it off, or dose it just no longer connect? </s>
<s> i may just go with the wap </s>
<s> It's like turning off a light bulb. </s>
<s> There can still be one leg of the power connected so some existentialist could argue the power is still on even when there is no light. </s>
<s> Then again they could be right and the bulb is burnt out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Have you tried to connect? </s>
