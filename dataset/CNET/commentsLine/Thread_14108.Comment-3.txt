i know it is the cpu because i had the gpu for a while before i upgraded the processor, and that's when the noise started.
i have checked the computer while it's running and it is defintely the cpu fan.
my computer is running plenty cool it is just the noise that bothers me, i would like to find a upgrade to my current fan/heatsink without filling up my case.
i have a fan at the front of the case and the rear of the case so i'm ok for case cooling, just want to find a comparable fan that will do the job while being silent under load.
i will check temps tomorrow it's too late to run that now.
thanks for the website have been looking at that for a new fan.
