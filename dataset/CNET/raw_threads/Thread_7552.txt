I know that the xt master card has 512mb and that in order to use it in crossfire i would have to sacrifice half of this, and i have taken this into consideration. I'll be gratefull for any help that anyone can offer, thanks in advance

Even using the specially-designed game demo gives us nothing compelling to recommend purchasing a PhysX based card. We are still excited about what physics will bring to gaming, but we stand only on the doorstep of what could be the next greatest processing development.&quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/07/19/is_ageias_physx_failing/page9.html
