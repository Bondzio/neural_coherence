i don't see what the big deal is all about (i haven't notice either).
personally i have 3 monitors (and they are all 1440x720)..and i think they look just great for me.
i got them instead of 1080 because i don't have the spare cash but it really come down to what you want to use the monitor for; if you are going to watch bru-ray, is there any other way?
