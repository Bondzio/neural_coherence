<s> Re the Video Card and Power Supply: Video card selected requires 400W PSU ... the PSU selected is delivers up to 180W (and it's MICRO-ATX ... MICRO-ATX is OK if that's all the case will take...but you are not limited to MICRO-ATX sized PSUs.) </s>
<s> &quot;Hardware - Intel Pentium 4/CoreTM 2 or AMD AthlonTM /PhenomTM - 1 GB or more of system memory for best performance - Optical drive for software installation (CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive) - A power supply that provides at least 400-watt is required. </s>
<s> The power supply should be with a known brand and certified to conform to safety regulations. </s>

CPU comes with HS FAN http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835150018&Tpk=N82E16835150018 For the Motherboard: Full size, with more slots and greater flexibility. </s>
<s> The one you picked has GPU built in (you don't need the built in you're getting a separate video card), it will be very cramped using a MICRO-ATX MB with a large video card and it has very limited expansion slots. </s>

<s> The links I provided take right where you need to go. </s>
<s> thanks a ton for all the help would this power supply work because the others were a little too expensive im working with a 525 dollar spending limit heres the link http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817170018 i added the motherboard you suggested what would be a good 25 dollar 2nd video card </s>
<s> the reason i had the second cpu fan was that i wanted to overclock it what would be good fan for that same with the video card the cheaper the better thank a lot bye the way </s>
<s> ...if the budget is that tight I'd skip the internal light. </s>
<s> You've got to start with a strong base system .. the MB, PSU and RAM to have everything stable and reliable. </s>
<s> The PSU you picked would be insufficient for that system ... and certainly not something that would support overclocking. </s>
<s> It may work for a time but at some time it will become unstable and fail and you'd be replacing it. </s>

<s> 3 year warranty. </s>
<s> $39.99 after rebate. </s>
<s> The PSU delivers 480 with 16 AMPs on the 12V line Buyer Ratings: 54% 5s, 22% 4s, no efficiency reported at &gt;100,000 hours MTBF. </s>
<s> Warranty not specified. </s>
<s> Skip the separate HS Fan for now... at the price, it's probably not as good at the factory original. </s>
<s> Just can't go too low on such a key component that can efficiently support your system for years. </s>
