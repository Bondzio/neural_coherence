<s> I have been working with layouts in Word and doing some simple graphic design with MS Publisher and Adobe Photoshop elements on a Dell laptop. </s>
<s> I now want to move on to Adobe InDesign CS and Photoshop full version and plan to buy a desktop with 2 monitors. </s>
<s> Everything I read about graphic cards has to do with video that I have no interest in. </s>
<s> Can anyone recommend specs for a good graphic card, RAM size (1Gb enough? </s>
<s> ), and monitor size and specs for this type of application? </s>
<s> Money is no object but I don't want to do an overkill either as everything will inevitably be obsolete faster than I can amortize it! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Monitor is also important, i dont really know how to pick. </s>
<s> I guess I'm somewhat old school. </s>
<s> I use (and am very happy with) a Viewsonic Graphic Series G220fb. </s>
<s> It's a flat screen CRT. </s>
<s> Quite frankly, I haven't seen a LCD that can match it. </s>
<s> And it costs far less that a LCD the same size and resolution. </s>
<s> ATI and nVidia probably are the best out there. </s>
<s> Go for their high-end cards. </s>
<s> You didn't say what video cards your mobo supports. </s>
<s> Something with 256mb should work fine. </s>
<s> I've heard great things about the new PCI express standard. </s>
<s> I'm a freelance photographer and I use the ATI 800Xpro and believe the pair make a good match. </s>
<s> About the second monitor... </s>
<s> I just saw a reasonable 19&quot; LCD for under $200. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> I don't know too much about what your software needs, so I apologize if I'm wrong. </s>
<s> You're going to need 1 GB of memory, 2GB would help. </s>
<s> You probably could use a quadro ro firegl card with at least 128mb memory. </s>
<s> However, those cards are somewhat pricy, so stick to what you can afford. </s>
<s> I would also get a dual-core cpu, like the Athlon 64 X2. </s>
<s> Monitor size depends on what you view, more is better so whatever you can get is good. </s>
<s> Unlike a computer system, you can keep using a monitor for years so I'd put more money into the monitor size, at least 19&quot;. </s>
<s> Good points. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I'll look these up </s>
<s> May I ask if anyone has specific recommendations about monitors in terms of color rendition and definition? </s>
<s> I can walk into a store and visually compare say flat screen TVs of various technologies, sizes and specs, but I cannot do the same with monitors since most are sold only by mail order, such as Dell. </s>
<s> That's why I am asking if anyone has experience based recommendations... </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> You may want to look at LCD monitors with 10 bit gamma instead of 8 bit. </s>
<s> A company called Lacie, www.lacie.com, make both crt and lcd monitors for graphics use, though they aren't promoting the crt any more. </s>
<s> Their 300 series lcd monitors are of the highest quality and have 10 bit gamma correction. </s>
<s> (I believe they are based on top quality NEC units) You can also get Calibrators for their monitors. </s>
<s> They are no longer promoting the CRT monitors on their site, but they may be still around. </s>
<s> You should definitely get a monitor with a digital (DVI) input and a quality video card with DVI out. </s>
<s> Using a digital signal will produce the sharpest image on an lcd monitor. </s>
<s> The best type of video card for graphics would be a High end graphics workstation card like one of the Quadro 4 nVidia cards. </s>
<s> They are not made for gaming, but for accurate colour. </s>
<s> Hope I've been of some help. </s>
