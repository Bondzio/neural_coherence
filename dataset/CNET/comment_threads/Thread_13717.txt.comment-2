It is one long paragraph so while it would be nice to know the make and model I may have missed it because of that long paragraph.
Let me share a laptop I own had a similar issue.
I cured it by using a powered USB 2.0 HUB inbetween the PC and the drive.
Now it boots up fine.
If you get a random reboot, check your laptop's maker for &quot;motherboard&quot; drivers.
