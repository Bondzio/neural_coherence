you say it's a zif socket.
it sounds like it shouldn't be any harder than installing a processor.
i opted to buy the bios replacement chip because i figured it would be cheaper and less of a hassle than replacing the whole motherboard.
the bios chip cost me $20 plus shipping.
with it being a zif socket i feel like this is something i can do myself.
thanks for your help.
