I have an IDE configured SATA HDD with Windows 7 currently running on it.
(WD Caviar 500GB) I have a twin for this disk, currently not installed.
I would like to, if possible configure these two disks so that it registers in Windows as a single disk (1TB) with one drive letter.
Any help or pointers is greatly appreciated.
