1.1.1	I need to know how to connect back my front panel I/O pins in my Dell Dimension 4600 ( Dell F4491 or N2828 MotherBoard ) .	St
1.1.2	I have no idea on how to connect back my Switch On/Off , Power LED wires .	St
1.1.3	Can anyone help ?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Yes , I have checked the system docs , but the document doesnt have enough detail .	St
1.3.2	The Dell site also proved to be useless .	St
1.4.1	With the power out I find the block that has the usual pins for HDD light , power LED and the power on switch .	St
1.4.2	I take a & quot ; pop jumper & quot ; ( see http : //media.digikey.com/photos/FCI % 20Photos/71363-102LF , % 2071363-202LF.jpg for a big image ) or other such item and test for which pair turns on the machine .	St
1.4.3	Then I know the pair for the power on jumper .	St
1.4.4	Now I can use an LED for the other functions .	St
1.4.5	I made no effort to look for documentation .	St
1.4.6	I leave that to you but will share the old school way .	St

1.8.1	Here is the picture , http : //img26.imageshack.us/img26/8380/img0768qho.jpg	St
1.9.1	That is the connection for use in a Dell case .	St
1.9.2	The Dell case uses a connection that needs no documentation so they did n't create it .	St
1.9.3	Maybe you need to research the documentation for the Dell case next time as that MIGHT have the wiring or pin out since it 's not needed for the main board .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	not visible in the PIC you provided ... you might ask one of the MODERATORs to move this thread to the DELL FORUM .	St
1.10.2	I looked on the Dell site and I was n't able to find anything re the pin outs for that JUMPER BLOCK .	St
1.10.3	VAPCMD	St
1.11.1	But I can guess now what the issue is .	St
1.11.2	The OP likely obtained a Dell motherboard or moved a Dell motherboard from a Dell case to a generic case .	St
1.11.3	That explains why they could n't just plug it in .	St
