I'll be blunt, if you know you have a 'bad psu' then why not replace it at the earliest convience if not sooner. many a generic brand has survived basic demands, just go for one that's higher wattage. tada -----Willy

It might be made in China, but so what. Yes the odds are high that it is not the greatest power supply but as long as it is working, why worry. The 30 hour limit is in your head. The power supply internals have reached its &quot;stable&quot; running temperature in ten or so minutes. It may vary a little as the running load on the CPU varies depending on what you are doing. It should stay in that temperature range as long as it is on.

If your concerned maybe remove the side cover...keep things a little cooler....doubt that it's needed. Can you really keep your dial-up connection alive for 30 hrs? That must be some HUGE download.
