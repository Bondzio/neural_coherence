i have an old motherboard that is used in a digital video recorder.
the motherbaord is a 2003 bayfield, the memory chip is a 256mb sdram ddr dimm 184 pc133.
i want to put a 1 gig chip in but not sure if the faster chips will work in the motherboard.
i dont need the faster speed chip, but they are all that is available now and also much cheaper.
do you think a pc2700 or something similar will work in a 2003 bayfield motherboard.
i think all it takes is one memory chip.
i haven't opened the case up yet because i need it recording my store.
thanks!
