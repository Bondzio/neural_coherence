it should tell you about adding RAM and whether it's advantageous to add in pairs or not.
Many of today's systems are built with dual channel memory architecture which means it is advantageous to add in DIMMs in pairs...2@512MBs vice 1@1GB.
If you download and run CPUZ .. it should tell you what RAM you have in your system and whether it's one DIMM or two DIMMs.
