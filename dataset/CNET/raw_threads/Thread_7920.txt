1262	0	600207	5491339	NR	TitashRC	8/27/13 9:29 AM	1.37759574E12	Creating a Virtual Network	Hi All, My cousin and I want to establish a VLAN of sorts over the internet to collaborate over files and applications installed in each other's laptop. What would be the easiest and cheapest way to go about doing this? Thanks in advance.

VLAN however is entirely a different scope. Regards David
