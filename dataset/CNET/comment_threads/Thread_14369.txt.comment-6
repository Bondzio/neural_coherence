Bob -- Thanks for all your advice.
Unfortunately, we ran into an unexpected delay -- Best Buy misinformed us about the type of board I have.
When they diagnosed it as dead, they told me it was a socket 775.
When we opened it up, however, we discovered the malfunctioning board was a socket A/462.
Thankfully, the gentleman my hubby bought it from consented to a switch, and we're waiting for the 462 to arrive.
I do have one question from reading the links you posted: if I need to reinstall some Windows files, will that erase my hard drive?
I have a lot of stuff on there I want to preserve!
I'll post again once we get this done -- I'm sure I'll run into problems and will need your expert advice once again.
B
