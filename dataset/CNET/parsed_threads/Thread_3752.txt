<s> Last summer I purchased a 1T Lacie external hard drive, and lately it's been acting up. </s>
<s> Every once in a while the computer wouldn't recognize it, but if I restarted the external hard drive that usually solved it. </s>
<s> Last night, however, my computer stopped recognizing the drive, and nothing I've done has helped (restarting the computer, restarting the hard drive, and trying a different USB port). </s>
<s> When I turn on the hard drive my computer makes the &quot;ding&quot; sound that I usually take to mean it recognizes it, but when I go to my computer the hard drive either doesn't appear or only &quot;Local Disc (F:)&quot; appears without the usual ____ gb/____gb used and when I double click on it the My Computer folder freezes and I can't access the hard drive. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciate! </s>
<s> I'd try the drive directly connected to the MB if possible. </s>
<s> They do go bad. </s>
<s> If it works that way, there's an issue with the enclosure or its power supply. </s>
<s> You can try to put the drive in another enclosure and see if it works. </s>
<s> I'm sorry, I'm a bit lacking in knowledge when it comes to computers. </s>
<s> How would I attach it directly to the MB? </s>
<s> Thanks so much! </s>
<s> and then open the computer's case. </s>
<s> You'd need to determine whether the drive was SATA or PATA by the rear connectors. </s>
<s> You'd need to attach the drive to an available port on the MB if SATA. </s>
<s> If PATA, it could be attached by an unused plug on a cable or open IDE port on the MB but there may be jumpers to deal with. </s>
<s> It's not that difficult but depends on your own comfort level with trying this. </s>
<s> I plugged my hard drive into another power outlet and now it's working fine. </s>
<s> Thanks so much for your help! </s>
