Ok, when I am trying to work on pictures (can be 1 loaded into program or 50 pics)the system starts slowing down badly. My other system is a slower computer and can fly through the pics (1GB RAM, 128 Video Card). I am just not sure why the faster system is slower, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Yes it is amazing how much memory is used, however My older system handles up to 850mb PF usage, (not sure if the PF is a good tell tale, but it is something I can go by...lol)new system slows and &quot;thinks&quot; at about 350mb PF usage. Video Bios settings have been taken care of---256, not sure what pallette snooping is. Ready built system, I added vid card. intel 915G socket 775a....I think it is &quot;A&quot; onboard video, sound, etc. I disabled onboard vid in BIOS when I installed card. I am thinking it may b a mobo problem as this is a refurb, or just operator problems...lol. Going to try resuming onboard and see if maybe vid card is bad.
