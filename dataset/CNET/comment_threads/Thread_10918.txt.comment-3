I was actually checking DeskTops here at C/Net today and was really looking at VISTA ready machines.. a LEVONO&lt;&lt;--did I spell that rt./ Business Machine called a Think Centre was going for $$758..00 utilizeing a 3.06 GHz CPU and an 80 GB HDD..and 512 MB's of RAM.. seems from the ReView that it did not SHIP w/Burner Drive..only a CD-ROM.. ..
I would suggest this machine for a Purchase and a Upgrade.. you could go USB 2.0 on your Burner Drive..along w/External HDD at least 120-GB's... .. Software.... .. its an added $$300.00.
