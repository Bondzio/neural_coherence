<s> I cannot decide for basic home office use between two models that a sales rep with Velocity Micro recommended to me the other night. </s>
<s> One model which I've read many good posts in this forum about is the Velocity Micro SX-V Value Edition. </s>
<s> Another model the sales rep configured for me was a Velocity Micro Vector PCX. </s>
<s> It seems to me that the Velocity Micro Vector PCX has more option choices than does the SX-V Value Edition; other than that; according to the sales rep; both models appear to be identical. </s>
<s> I have a few questions on configuration which I'd like to submit to you and if anyone in this forum would consider addressing them; that would be great. </s>
<s> The sales rep has configured the following on the SX-V Value edition that I have a question about: 1. </s>
<s> 350 watt power supply w/single fan QUESTION: A 500 watt power supply is available w/dual fans for an extra $39.00. </s>
<s> Should I consider it or will the extra fan generate much more noise to the point that I might not be able to work on my PC? </s>
<s> If it will generate more noise; what are we talking about? </s>
<s> Noise like a 1500 watt hair dryer on low speed or would the noise generated be much lower? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I also want a floppy drive configured. </s>
<s> QUESTION: I can configure only a floppy drive or for an extra $25.00 a media reader can be added as well. </s>
<s> Should I consider adding the media reader for future use or buy a new inkjet printer also having media card slots instead? </s>
<s> I have only one configuration question on the Velocity Micro Model Vector PCX. </s>
<s> The sales rep has configured an 80GB HD for me on this model. </s>
<s> QUESTION: I can increase that HD size from 80GB to 120GB for an extra $35.00. </s>
<s> A 120GB HD is the smallest size HD available on the other model; the SX-V Value Edition. </s>
<s> Should I go ahead and spend the extra $35.00 and increase the HD size on the Vector PCX from 80GB to 120GB or stay with the 80GB HD as was configured by the sales rep with Velocity Micro? </s>
<s> My primary use for a desktop computer would be for word processing; email; internet surfing and personal finance. </s>
<s> I'm not into gaming or digital photography although I might consider digital photography at some point in time in the future. </s>
<s> Playing games on a computer is not part of my plans; never has been. </s>
<s> For those of you out there who have recently purchased desktop computers from Velocity Micro; have you experienced any issues with their company's tech support and were those issues resolved to your satisfaction? </s>
<s> Anyone out there recently purchased a Velocity Micro Vector PCX desktop computer from the company? </s>
<s> If so; have you been satisfied with your new desktop computer purchase? </s>
<s> I have not been able to locate any user/owner reviews anywhere on the web for the Velocity Micro Vector PCX desktop computer. </s>
<s> Big Steve End Of Message 05/11/05 </s>
<s> yes i would go for the higher power supply. </s>
<s> the fan should not make dat much noise but if it does dl speedfan from download.com to control the speed of the fans i not sure if u really need dat media card reader/floppy since u dont do much photography and u can just link ur camera to pc through usb. </s>
<s> also floppy getting replaced by flash drives. </s>
<s> i would say 80gb is sufficient. </s>
<s> but if ure considering keeping dis pc for 5+years, get the 120gb. </s>
<s> i would go for the sx-v one not the sx-v value edition one. </s>
<s> i'm not sure which one ure suggesting but go for the amd one. </s>
<s> However, i'm not sure if the athlon 64s are socket 939 or socket 754. it doesnt say. </s>
<s> U should ask b4 purchasing. </s>
<s> if socket 754, dont get dat model. </s>
<s> Go for the vision 64 model. </s>
<s> I thought u were looking into the emachines t6212 and the gateway 827gm or something? </s>
<s> I would say those are better than the velocity ones ure suggesting. </s>
