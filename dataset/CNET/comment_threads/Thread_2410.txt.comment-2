a comparable dell e510 w/512mb ram, a 80gb HD, but a 128mb x300 video card is $1,044 w/free shipping.
add your own 2gb of ram for $160 (less $50 rebate = $110) and a 250gb HD for $90 to make a comparable upgraded dell for $1,294.
i don't care for the integrated graphics (gma950) since a) its 'stealing' 128mb ram from the PC, b) its 3D performance is slow, and c) i don't think you'll be able to run Win Vista's Aero interface on it.
if those drawbacks aren't important to you, then go for it.
