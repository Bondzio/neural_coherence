Having found the problem: PSU, I opened the dead PSU and found plently burnt/blackend/covered in god-knows-what capacitors and need a new one. It was a 400W which had these rails (Is that the word for these?): +5: 40A +12:14A -12:1A -5:1A 3.3V:28A VSB:2.5A Are those good? I don't think so, but... Can anyone give me a good wattage range and/or brand for these components: P4 2.8Ghz GeForce 4 Ti 4600 CD-RW Drive DVD Drive 120GB 7200 RPM IDE HD QDI Superb4FX Motherboard NIC Card 5-Port USB 2.0 Card Floppy 56K Modem 12inch Cold Cathode Light 1GB of DDR3200 (Corsair Value) I have found that the connector to the motherboard is 2 rows of 10 pins totaling: A 20-pin connector for the motherboard. I am aware that most new motherboards use the 24-pin, but there are adapters, aren't there? I do have the website for the Motherboard: http://www.qdigrp.com/qdisite/eng/products/S4FX.htm I also need a recommendation for a Heatsink as the one I have currently is not doing too well. My budget is low, maybe not over $75 for both items? I can shop anywhere, but I'd rather not have to resort to eBay. Just as an afterthought: This motherboard is not too hot, I have a NIC card and a USB card because those two items on the board don't work. Should I buy a new motherboard? But those are the only two things that aren't working. I'd rather not make this like a huge ''makeover'', but should it be trashed and bought another? But this is just an afterthought: The PSU and HSF are priority. Sorry for the length, but this will be my first ''big'' computer item and want it to go smoothly. Thanks in advance! ~Ibrahim~

Power supply works with either 20 or 24 PIN MB connector. They always get good ratings when reviewed at site like Tomshardware.com. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817104954 $49.99 plus shipping (reasonable at Newegg) Output +3.3V@30A, +5V@28A, +12V1@18A, +12V2@18A, -12V@0.5A, +5VSB@2A Re the HS FAN....your call plenty of choices at Newegg.

It lists these connectors: 1 x Main connector (20+4 pin)- Good 1 x 12V (P4)-Good 6 x peripheral-What does that include? IDE? 2 x SATA-Are SATA Power connectors the same as IDE? 1 x Floppy-Good I like the Heatsink, cool design! Thanks~ ~Ibrahim~

Now that I have to take that one out, the heatsink would be blowing air directly on to the side of the case, right? What should I do? Drill some holes for a case fan there? Buy another duct/funnel? ~Ibrahim~

I just need a 80mm fan to go with it. Any good recommendations? I realize I've got to expand my budget a little. ~Ibrahim~

Some earlier SATA drives used the same molex connector, However all of the newer SATA drives use a different type connector that are much different than the four pin molex.
