If yes then... shall i make my (20 GB FAT 32 HD) into Paging file disk ? And should i disable the page file in... my main HD ? Also, I got this HD from a fren, it's working fine... but it had 5 BAD clusters. (which i surfaced scanned and all)... but my fren didn't want it, so i took it... it's basically FREE!!! I will be using it only for PAging file and TEMP folder for my Other softwares (like Audition, Photoshop... KAZA, Limeware...etc) Now... is there any software, that can further check, or help in BAD clusters? Till now... it has only, 5 BAD clusters... HELP !!! Please... Gsoul2soul

Members are losing their OS or files due to that. Your choice to use this poison. Let me comment that with today's well equipped machines of 256, 512 or more megabytes of RAM that payoff of such paging file optimizing is not paying off. Your choice here and I will not discuss why in detail. You do the test. Bob
