<s> Hi, I'm in the market for a HD enclosure. </s>
<s> I plan on buying the new 1 terabyte HD by Hitachi when it comes out this month. </s>
<s> But when I look for enclosures, a lot of them say that their maximum HD capacity is 500 GB, or 750 GB, etc. </s>
<s> Since all 3.5&quot; HD's are the same size physically, why is there a capacity for an enclosure? </s>
<s> Shouldn't it not matter? </s>
<s> Would a 1 TB HD work in an enclosure that says their max is 500 GB? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help </s>
<s> There are no 1TB drives to test in said enclosures so while it should work, no one has tested it hence this is why you read this. </s>

<s> http://www.adaptec.com/en-US/products/_eol/consstor/enclosures/ACS-300/ I've purchased several Adaptec external HDD enclosures and they have served me well. </s>
<s> They were the only mfg at the time that offered enclosures which clearly stated their enclosures handled HDDs greater than 300GBs. </s>
<s> Having used their SCSI HBAs....I knew I could depend on their products specs. </s>
<s> It appears Adaptec is discontinuing this line of products from their sales. </s>
