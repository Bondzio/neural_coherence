<s> If I'm going to do anything serious with a word processor or spreadsheet, I want a desktop or laptop. </s>
<s> Doing much typing on anything smaller is an exercise in masochism. </s>
<s> I switched to LibreOffice (originally called StarOffice, later called OpenOffice, and now called LibreOffice) a decade ago, and I am happy that I did. </s>
<s> Why on earth would I switch to an inferior product which costs more? </s>
<s> Definitely on my iPad. </s>
<s> Probably not on my android phone. </s>
<s> It would seem frustrating to try and do any real work on a small screen like those on most smartphones. </s>
<s> Many years ago i switched all my computers to Open Office programs and ihave never looked back nor spent any money for upgrades. </s>
<s> Recently, i discovered KingSoft and i am impressed with the new discovery on my Android phone and tablet and both my desktop and laptop. </s>

<s> Whether you like it or not, I think MS Office is part of the business world. </s>
<s> Having MS Office on the IPAD would be terrific. </s>
<s> I have two laptops (one small and one large) and I would much rather carry the IPAD with me.....it's lighter and simply takes up less space in the briefcase. </s>
<s> Just wish I could have MS Office on it! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> First time I used MS Office was on a MAC SE before the &quot;office&quot; concept using Word, Excel, and later PowerPoint. </s>
<s> I think MS developed Word and Excel for the MAC before the PC. </s>
<s> It is good they get back to their roots. </s>
<s> I've been delaying buying a tablet because I like the Android OS, but I like the full functionality of Excel. </s>
<s> I hate switching back and forth between Excel and pseudo-excel worksheets. </s>
<s> If it was free, or very low priced (make that extremely low priced). </s>
<s> A lite version would be beneficial. </s>
<s> I use Excel, Word, PP, OneNote, and picture manager daily. </s>
<s> I don't think a full blown version of Office on a tablet or phone would be very useful. </s>
<s> Also if you consider the limited space available on some of these devices. </s>
<s> I just put together a PowerPoint presentation today. </s>
<s> I would not consider using my tablet to do something like this. </s>
<s> However it would be great to view or do some light editing on the run. </s>
<s> This is the very reason we (155 users) went away from Microsoft. </s>
<s> To get rid of their lockin and horrendus prices. </s>
<s> I use an ASUS Transformer Prime running Jelly Bean for note-taking and viewing documents in writing and editing classes. </s>
<s> I use Polaris Office (which came with the tablet) and Pro Office Suite. </s>
<s> Neither app can display tracked changes or multiple documents, both of which I'd like to do. </s>
<s> My current workaround for tracked changes is to print the document with changes displayed to a pdf. </s>
<s> I open that document in Adobe, and one document each in the office apps. </s>
<s> If MS Office for Android eliminated my need for the workarounds, I'd definitely consider it, provided that the implementation was reliable and reasonably priced. </s>
<s> There may be other Android apps out there now that have the features I need, but I'm pretty sure there weren't any available on Google Play when I went looking for them last year. </s>
<s> MS Office is proprietary, paid software. </s>
<s> Free, open source software makes massively more sense. </s>
<s> Libre Office, my choice among many, communicates with MS Office formats. </s>
<s> Microsoft is obsolete. </s>
<s> Cost & features would be the determining factor. </s>
<s> I have been using DOCUMENTS TO GO on various platforms for years... Palm, Andriod & IOS. </s>
<s> I seldom do anything from &quot;scratch&quot;, but use it to update Excel & Word files. </s>
<s> For the most part I need to create an Excel workbook w/ functions on PC & transfer to my mobile device. </s>
<s> I miss database software! </s>
<s> If reasonably priced & most of the functionality from Windows - YES, I would use MS Office on a mobile device in a heartbeat! </s>
<s> I have had situations where I was standing, entering data read off into a workbook on a mobile device. </s>
<s> Most mobile devices weigh less than laptops. </s>
<s> YES - the workbook gets transferred to PC for any major manipulation, but at least I got my data entered quickly on the fly. </s>
<s> Even though Tablet tries to cover most work aspects, when it comes to documents we really don't have strong, unified and platform independent tools. </s>
<s> Microsoft office is plays an inevitable role on every kind of business on the PC front and if the same potential can be leveraged into tablets i would definitely go for it. </s>
<s> Also, I discovered that the &quot;Speech-to-Text&quot; option on all my Android devices is re-markedly accurate and requires very little editing. </s>
<s> (My 'old man' fat fingers need lots of editing!) </s>
<s> I have and use my laptop (windows 7) for spread sheet and serious letter or memo writing. </s>
<s> I am happy with Open Office so I don't need Microsoft Office even on that computer. </s>
<s> My tablet is only for fast rtesponses, so no need for Microsoft Office on that either. </s>
<s> I agree with all the comments about price. </s>
<s> Microsoft and Adobe think most of us have more money than we do. </s>
<s> However, I use my Android tablet to take minutes for meetings, and I'd love to have the full, or nearly-full version of Office on my tablet. </s>
<s> At this point, I use Evernote to take notes, then copy/paste them into Word. </s>
<s> Evernote is great, but limited to simple text formatting. </s>
<s> I want a multilevel outline framework, for example. </s>
<s> Office 365 is already available on the Android platform. </s>
<s> I have it, and have it installed on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. </s>
<s> Too much, too late! </s>
<s> I have been using Google Docs for years. </s>
<s> Apple now offers its iWork's for free too. </s>
<s> MS decision to make Office for iPad is simply too late, and probably too much too. </s>
<s> OH!! </s>
<s> For those who say you cant do serious work on a tablet... </s>
<s> Plenty of great Bluetooth keyboards around for cheap. </s>
<s> (Even some really nice BT keyboard cases.) </s>
<s> For those seriously working, they already have laptops, using Office work alikes to great creations. </s>
<s> Microsoft is a software company, they should try to improve the software and OS already in market or yet to be introduced. </s>
<s> their Windows8 is not running as good as expected, Vista has fail. </s>
<s> They should give consumers a good service, their software will automatically make their own place and people will replace others to adopt them. </s>
<s> A good thing and service always pay better. </s>
<s> All serious work on desktop and to be free and handy one must adopt a tablet for easy going. </s>
<s> Since I have free things that work for me this may be a steep hurdle for them to overcome. </s>
<s> I generally prefer other products over Microsoft except for Excel, which is unfortunately a well deserved industry standard. </s>
<s> The other products? </s>
<s> Not so much. </s>
