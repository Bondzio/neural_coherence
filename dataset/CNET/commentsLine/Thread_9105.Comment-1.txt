my desktop pc has two units of 256mb ddram - which was pretty good at the time the machine was built.
but i'm thinking about upgrading, now that i could quadruple that amount of memory for probably $200.
so my question is, what kind of performance increase can i reasonably expect for that kind of upgrade?
i realize there are many factors in play here, but for those who have upgraded memory, have you found it to be a worthwhile expense?
or should i wait until prices drop?
just wondering if this is worth my while.
thanks.
