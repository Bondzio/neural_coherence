<s> We just bought a camcorder with it's own HD. </s>
<s> I want to be able to put family videos and pictures from the camcorder and some that are stored on our laptops too. </s>
<s> I see manufacturers like Iomega has portable hard drives. </s>
<s> Any replys would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Reading the posts here I can safely bet that external drives are not the best solution. </s>
<s> Any chance of you bringing yourself to put what you can't lose on a few DVDs? </s>
<s> Ok, DVD's are the safest then. </s>
<s> Just wanted to make sure. </s>
<s> I've been a &quot;member&quot; of CNET sense the website started, and have read the same. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
