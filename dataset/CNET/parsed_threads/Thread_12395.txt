<s> Ok. Only other time I networked anything was when I used a router to split a cable ISP connection between my neighbor and myself. </s>
<s> However, when we tried to take the router off and go back to individual access, my neighbor's pc could never connect so I'm already afraid of routers. </s>
<s> Anyway.... </s>
<s> I've got a desktop pc, a new ibook w/Airport card, and an xbox. </s>
<s> Need advice to set up a network where the ibook is wireless and the xbox (wired or wireless) gets strong bandwith throughput. </s>
<s> I'll be downloading a lot of music on the pc as well. </s>
<s> The pc is upstairs while the xbox is in the basement. </s>
<s> (thanks to my wife!) </s>
<s> I was looking at the new Belkin Pre-N router. </s>
<s> I'd like all the help and suggestions I can get. </s>
<s> I would stick with a good quality router. </s>
<s> Netgear and Linksys are two of the best brands out there. </s>
<s> Dlink would be my third choice. </s>
<s> I personally wouldn't use a highspeed connection without a router. </s>
<s> A router offer some protection from the outside. </s>
<s> Better to get one with a built in firewall. </s>
