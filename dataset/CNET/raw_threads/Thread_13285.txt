It has three monitor ins, VGA, DVI, and HDMI. I have a Dell 1907FP hooked up to the HDMI port (I have a cable that has DVI to monitor and HDMI to computer) I have a ViewPanel VPA150 hooked up to the VGA port, and I have a Gateway FPD1510 hooked up to the DVI port. I have the two monitors working (ViewPanel and Dell) but in Catalyst Control Center when I try to extend the Gateway CCC says something like &quot;If you extend this monitor another monitor will have to be disabled&quot; And I clicked continue it just disabled the ViewPanel and replaced it with The Gateway. I wondered if there is anyway I could get the three monitors all extended, not like eyefinity but just so I can move windows to other ones

To enable more than two displays, additional panels with native DisplayPort connectors, and/or DisplayPort compliant active adapters to convert your monitors native input to your cards DisplayPort or Mini-DisplayPort connector(s), are required. ATI Eyefinity technology can support up to 6 displays using a single enabled ATI Radeon graphics card with Windows Vista or Windows 7 operating systems - the number of displays may vary by board design and you should confirm exact specifications with the applicable manufacturer before purchase. Systems using multiple ATI Radeon graphics cards can support a maximum of 8 displays (total across all cards in system) with a maximum 6 of those displays being used together in a display group (also known as a single large surface mode)&quot; http://www.amd.com/US/PRODUCTS/DESKTOP/GRAPHICS/ATI-RADEON-HD-5000/HD-5570/Pages/hd-5570-specifications.aspx {Note 2). Seems you may need something extra. Mark
