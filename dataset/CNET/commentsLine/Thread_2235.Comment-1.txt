the only parts i am not sure about are the motherboard and the power supply.
i don't know if thats enough for all that stuff.
also, on the motherboard i doubt i am ever going to do sli for an 8800. and i am also only going to have one (maybe one more) sata hard drive in there and one older hard drive.
i do know that i plan on having this computer a while though so should i go for a good mobo like that or does it not matter?
thanks in advance guys.
