<s> I have connected my TV to my Gainward GeForce FX5200 s-video output, I get a picture, but I am unable to view both my TV-set and my PC-monitor at the same time. </s>
<s> I have updated my drivers. </s>
<s> I suspect that my graphics card does not support this feature, otherwise the option to run both screens (clone-view or whatever, my driver is Norwegian) would appear in the Nvidia control panel, right? </s>
<s> Is this correct? </s>
<s> Does this mean I need a new graphics card in order to use both? </s>
<s> How do I identify which cards support this and which don't? </s>
<s> Or is it simply something I'm doing wrong? </s>
<s> To have two monitors with differnt content you need a better video card. </s>
<s> Such is life. </s>
