<s> Been trying to rehook my wife's e machine to my network. </s>
<s> It won't connect. </s>
<s> It was connected and I think she screwed with settings but won't admit it. </s>
<s> The network consists of 2 laptops and 2 desktops. </s>
<s> Her XP laptop hooks up ok. My laptop and desktop (both Vista) both hookup ok. </s>
<s> Her desktop e-machine (XP) sees the network but won't connect. </s>
<s> I am using Belkin wireless adapters on both desktops and they are ok. </s>
<s> It hooks up with ethernet cable ok. </s>
<s> I've tried everything I can think of to get it to hook up but it just won't. </s>
<s> Using the linksys setup utility, it says that it is hooked up, but it isn't! </s>
<s> I seem to be unable to find the network settings in xp. </s>
<s> I don't want to re set the router (Linksys WRT54GL) because then I will have to reinstall the 3 units that are working. </s>
<s> Anything I can do? </s>
<s> ABC's please. </s>
<s> I'm senile and used to running Vista now, can't remember XP stuff. </s>
<s> thanks a bunch. </s>
<s> George </s>
<s> the encryption on that machine. </s>
<s> It has to be the same as those that are working properly. </s>
<s> I know that, but I can't seem to locate the place or means of checking the present settings. </s>
