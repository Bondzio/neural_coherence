The one that perfectly fits the bill is, VuPoint Magic Wand but its not in the market yet. According to the customer service, it will be available by November this year, so I guess, they are prepping for holiday season. I wonder if there is any other product similar to this. There was one from PanDigital but I doubt they make it anymore (and their customer service is close to pathetic so I am not interested in their product). Will be glad to know. Many thanks in advance.

Order soon.&quot; It's 900 dpi in stead of the 1200 dpi that isn't available yet. Since you don't tell WHY the 1200 dpi would be perfect, it could be a 900 dpi is good enough. Personally I never scan with more that 400 dpi, I think. Kees

Otherwise there are literally tons of scanners with feeder only option like Fujitsu S1100 or Neat Receipts on cheaper side. In my use, sometimes I will have to feed the documents (little crumpled) and sometimes I will have to scan them with wand (book or magazine, edges taken into account). Hence the one mentioned in original post. The link you posted doesn't have any of the type I need but are wand only or feeder only. I tried wand only but did not work for crumpled but neat worked pretty well. So preferring 2-in-1 type scanner.
