my os is windows 7, p5k premium motherboard, ive had this system stable for almost 2 years, its not newly built.
i recenlty bought a new monitor, and my computer was shut down.
i removed the old dvi cable from the old monitor that was hooked to the video card and then hooked the new dvi from the new monitor.
then pressed power on the computer, then it wouldn't start, makes wierd noises and all the fans are slightly twitching, even psu and cpu fans, and the case fans which had leds on them flickered really fast, it looked as if it was possessed or something...i cant keep it on too long because im worried about the cpu frying, although it may be dead already...what can i do to diagnose the problem?
