intel pentium 4's produce a TON of heat.
i know for myseld as i am on one right now.
it would help if you said ur cpu number or the GHz, but either way, they run hot and idle in the 40's (celcious) you can use speedfan, google it, so quiet it down.
also, the wooshing sound, was that just the fan going at full speed?
because most computers' fans run at 100% before the bios kicks in.
