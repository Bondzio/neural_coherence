where do you locate the network key for a wireless router.
i am trying to establish a wireless internet connection with a 2wire wireless router connected to the host computer.
the second computer recongines the 2wire network but because the network is locked i can not access it.
it asks for the network key which can either be 5-13 ascii characters or 10-26 hexadecimal characters and 40 or 104 bits depending on the network configuration.
please help, thank you.
