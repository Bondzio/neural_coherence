<s> Hello there, I hope English speaker geek will help me, the French one couldn't ;( One of my &quot;fiend&quot;, even he is not really one right now, decide to destroy the MFT from my extra backup hard-disk to be able to read my NTFS files on his (f..k.ng) Mac OS to watch a ... movie ????!!!!! </s>
<s> Now I can' t access my files (backup of few years of work). </s>
<s> Symptoms : 1- &quot;My computer&quot; see nothing. </s>
<s> 2- The disk management from Windows see it as &quot;unallocated space&quot;. </s>
<s> 3- PTDD Partition Table Doctor see : - the partition, - the root and the files in it (there is some hope here) - confirm that the Boot sector is right. </s>
<s> - rebuild the MFT in Automatic and in Interactive mode (27 hours ...) So what now ? </s>
<s> Any advices. </s>
<s> Other software ? </s>
<s> Maybe it is not the MFT the problem (or was but there is another one)? </s>
<s> Help ...... </s>

<s> I try the Ubuntu stuff, but didn't help even Linux can't see my partition. </s>
<s> Only partition Doctor can. </s>
<s> The other solution are about recovering files that have been deleted, which is not my case. </s>
<s> thansk if anybody else as a solution. </s>
<s> I will only point out that other titles test and try to recover from this. </s>
<s> If you need someone to try them for you it looks like http://www.drivesavers.com would be best for you. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> But ... </s>
<s> Thanks to Linux also !!! </s>
<s> Playing around with it between Partition table doctor and Testdisk, I went back to Unbuntu and now I can access 2 of the 3 partition which is fine for me as the third one has stuff I don't really care about. </s>
<s> The problem is now to try to extract the files as it is extremely, extremely slow 11kb/s ....... As we are talking about 320 giga, it is a bit too slow. </s>
<s> Why that ? </s>
<s> Cause the MFt is bad ? </s>
<s> Cause I am strating a linux on a USB key, so not installed ? </s>
<s> Any suggestion, thanks </s>
<s> The most common is a power loss at the wrong moment. </s>
<s> The most common self inflicted damage is from those that defrag external drives. </s>
<s> If there were LESSONS to be learned from the storage forum it would be to backup what you can't lose and don't defrag external drives. </s>
