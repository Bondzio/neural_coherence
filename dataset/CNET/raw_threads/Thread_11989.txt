I have tried setting up a network using &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot; and &quot;Wireless Network Setup Wizard&quot;, and tried adding a network place, but after all of them, I still don't see any of the files I set to share, or the network name. I have been able to ping the computers on the network, so they're in range, but I still can't share anything. Any suggestions for setting this up? Thanks.

To save me from typing it again I'll not duplicate any answer that was given from the linked discussion you'll see next.
