Hello cNET, My name's Robert, and I recently got a upgraded video card which has been causing some issues once I installed it. I was using a Radeon HD 4600 series then upgraded to an ASUS Radeon HD 7770. Before installing the new card I uninstalled the old driver through Control Panel, then shutdown, installed new card, rebooted and installed the new driver. During my gaming sessions I would notice random screen tears happening, it would only be for less than a second but it would happen every few hours sometimes back to back when it did occur. After the tears started to become more frequent then I would be getting blue screens, I was always checking my temps they were fine, my 6pin is connected. I then read online to install &quot;Driversweeper&quot; to remove all existing drivers that may be causing interference which I did, then after I uninstalled those drivers it had me reboot, now during startup and I can't get to my desktop without getting a bluescreen. I was just going to whipe my computer with my Vista disk but that is not working. Any way to resolve this without whiping my computer?

I see various sites write about 100 Watts just for this card and http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/7000/7770/Pages/radeon-7770.aspx#3 asks for a 500 Watt or better PSU. While I'm inside I'd replace the CPU heatsink compound and ask the machine's maker about BIOS updates and compatibility. Bob

I found out that my power supply is in total 700 watts. I'm not sure of a program I could use to show all my information, for example the dxdiag doesn't display my information for some reason. I know this much about my computer... Intel Quad Core Q6600 2.40GHZ Heatsink is a Hyper Master 212 Plus Asus Radeon HD 7770 8 Gigs of Ram OCZ 700 watt PSU (12v) Windows Vista 64bit Below I was able to provide a screenshot of the bluescreen I am getting. I tried swapping out the Radeon 7770 with the 4600 series I was using before I was getting the Bluescreen and I still get it right before it shows the Windows logo then goes to desktop. I ended up taking out everything, cleaning out the computer which built up some dust, and replaced everything and still ended up with the bluescreen. Screenshot of Bluescreen provided below. http://i85.photobucket.com/albums/k79/Dbz_08/IMG_20130322_191041_zps2b2a5d0c.jpg

At least it's not my first guess. I hope you see why I could only guess without the details. There is some thought that since it works for a time it could be heat related. Did you try it with the cover off and pointing a fan at the open box? Bob
