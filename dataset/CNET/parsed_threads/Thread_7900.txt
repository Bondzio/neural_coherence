<s> I need help deciding on a new AGP video card, and also want to know if I should upgrade my power supply. </s>
<s> My computer is an XP, with a P4 2.8, 1 gig of RAM, 2 drives, 1 hard drive, and a Nvidia FX 5700 LE video card with 128 MB of memory. </s>
<s> I want to update my video card, primarly to run Oblivion on less than &quot;low&quot; settings with no extremely low frame-rates. </s>
<s> I currently have a 250 watt power supply. </s>
<s> I want to know if anyone can recommend a video card that meets my criteria, and is hopefully below $200. </s>
<s> I would also like to know if, should I upgrade to that card, if I would need to upgrade my power supply, and if so, to what. </s>
<s> Note: When examining the insides of my PC, I saw that above the AGP card slot, it said AGP slot, and also said 1.5v only. </s>
