in 1967 10 people in tarrant county (ft. worth, arlington and other suburbs), texas were offered a seat in a class on programming the new ncr century 100 series computer.
a test was given to anyone who showed up and lived in tarrant county and the top ten scores were offered the seats.
i was lucky enough to earn one of those seats.
we saw one computer.
it was at a steel company and filled the perimeter of a large room and we could walk around the room and follow the computer's computing progress (meaning it was pretty slow).
in those days everything was done using desk debugging and a programmer had a time slot on one day each week.
if their program was not ready to go, they had to wait until the next week.
shortly after that, don't remember the exact date, texas instruments came out with the ti 99-4a which i immediately purchased.
it had 4k memory and used a cassette tape for storage.
of course, it was programmed in basic.
i wrote a program to calculate auto insurance rates in texas, which was huge at the time, and would run out of memory frequently and would have to go back and rewrite some of the lines of code to gain more memory so i could finish the program.
i would go into the study to work on the program for a couple of hours and suddenly realize i had been there 5 or 6 hours.
in the end, the program served its purpose very well and was used for quite some time.
i loved that machine and have not gotten as much thrill working on any computer since as i did that one.
