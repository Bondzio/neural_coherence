A couple people said that, although the 2 x 1GB sticks ran at the 12000MHZ they are supposed to, adding another 2 x 1GB sticks of the exact same RAM slowed the entire FSB down. Why would this be and is there anyway it could be avoided? A tiny bit extra voltage maybe? Below is the link and the reviews I was talking about. Customer 1 This memory is very good. Sometimes you have to burn the memory in so it can run properly and overclock. This memory is specified to run at 1200mhz with 2 gigs not 4. So before you purchase please do the research. You very seldom run 4 gigs over 1100 mhz. Customer 2 Cons: none-cant run 4Gigs at 1200Mhz http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220282

Today the physics still apply that as you add more devices on a CPU &quot;bus&quot; it slows since each device adds capacitance. This is not a design bug or issue and I see someone else pointed out the overclocking aspect. Lesson? Get by with just 2 sticks. Bob

It should be able to take 1066mhz as well, right? Here's the for my motherboard if you need it. http://www.evga.com/products/moreInfo.asp?pn=132-CK-NF78-A1&family=Motherboard%20Family
