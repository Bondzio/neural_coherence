<s> I currently have Sony Vegas 7 video editing software but need a capture box to capture video from vhs. </s>
<s> I was considering a moviebox from Pinnacle and see two kinds I could try to bid for. </s>
<s> Is there a difference between the Deluxe version and the Plus version besides cosmetics? </s>
<s> Does the newer model produce better quality? </s>
<s> Or, would you recommend a different breakout box? </s>
<s> I currently have a Pinnacle Moviebox and I must say I am not too happy with it. </s>
<s> I used it to import VHS video onto my computer, but I found that even with a good spec on my system the sound wasn't matching up right. </s>
<s> Perhaps they have improved the Moviebox with the &quot;Plus&quot; version but I would suggest looking through some forums and reviews on it before you make the purchase. </s>
<s> Now I have since built a new system that is more than suitable for editing video but I may just dub vhs tapes using a DVD recorder, then import them into the computer from the DVDs. </s>
<s> That route may work better in terms of preserving the overall quality of the picture + the sound if you have a DVD player that records. </s>
<s> I'm unfamiliar with other brands or alternative methods beyond that discussed here so far, but hopefully your set-up works out. </s>
<s> I suppose if you're able to return the product after it's been opened you can always just take it for a test run. </s>
<s> If you are set on the Moviebox though I heard the &quot;Plus&quot; isn't that much different technologically for transferring VHS video into digital than the regular version, but you're probably better off with it anyway since we're probably all suckers for &quot;later models.&quot; </s>
<s> Be patient, and shop around some more. </s>
<s> I bought a pinnacle moviebox, and it's been nothing but a royal pain. </s>
<s> Even worse, there's no tech support available - they don't answer the phone, and email replies, when you get them, are just like automated searches of their FAQs. </s>
<s> For me, I can't even submitt a tech assistance request, because my &quot;product&quot; isn't listed on their drop down menu. </s>
<s> the software that came with it, Studio 9.4 seems to work well enough, mostly, except that it incorporates Quicktime, which has always given me problems in the past (hangs and stop errors, etc) There are several other similar products out there. </s>
<s> Don't go with the pinnacle just because they're the only ones on the shelf at Circuit City. </s>
<s> Check out other forums, like at camcorderinfo.com or consumerreports.com, and see what they have to say. </s>
