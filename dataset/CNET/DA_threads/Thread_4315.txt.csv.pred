1.1.1	All computers at this location access the Internet wirelessly through an 802.1g wireless router , which is cabled directly to a DSL modem .	St
1.1.2	The wireless network is not encrypted , and frequently interlopers can be found camped-onto my Internet connection .	St
1.1.3	Usually MAC filtering fixes this , but what I would like to do is to log traffic to and from the Internet .	St
1.1.4	Can this be done from the router or by bridging the hard-wired connection between the router and the DSL modem ?	Ques
1.1.5	How difficult can this be ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	There are very simple hack tools that let others use WEP and MAC filtered networks .	St
1.2.2	To solve this issue is very very simple .	St
1.2.3	Enable WPA , broadcast the SSID and no MAC filters .	St
1.2.4	Done .	St
1.3.1	Yes , I realize this , but a couple of the computers here are older and wo n't do WPA .	St
1.3.2	Anyhow , I 'd sincerely like to hack/embarrass these nefarious campers !	St
1.4.1	Turn off the wifi when you can .	St
1.4.2	Remember that WEP , even with MAC filtering is cracked in about 2 minutes with the right software .	St
1.4.3	Hopefully you can get the old gear wired and off the air soon .	St

1.5.1	If your router has a mirror/monitor option then you can do that but most consumer routers do not .	St
1.5.2	First you need a packet capture program and a PC you can leave running to capture it .	St
1.5.3	Wireshark is your best bet since its free and works very well The harder problem will be getting into the data stream .	St
1.5.4	A old hub if they still make those would work between the router and the dsl modem .	St
1.5.5	They make real ethernet taps but they are rather expensive .	St
1.5.6	The most common way to do this is with a switch that has the ability to & quot ; mirror & quot ; traffic .	St
1.5.7	You will need a switch is manageable ie 'you can log into ' .	St
1.5.8	They are some consumer ones but the cheapest way to buy a old cisco or 3com on ebay .	St
1.5.9	Even the very old switches can do this .	St
1.5.10	You still have the issue of knowing which traffic is valid and which is not .	St
1.5.11	All traffic will appear to come from the address on the router so it will be more difficult to know if it is your traffic or your intruders traffic .	St
1.5.12	To a point it will be obvious if they are visiting sites you do not .	St
1.6.1	Just the answer I was looking for , thanks very much .	Polite
1.6.2	I 'll initiate a search for that 'old hub ' and see what I can find .	St
1.6.3	I already have Wireshark ; this ought to be fun .	St
1.7.1	Hi as for me I used ProteMac Meter for monitoring traffic ... I liked	St
