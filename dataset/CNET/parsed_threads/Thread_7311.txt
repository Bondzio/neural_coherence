<s> I know this probably gets asked all the time, but I would really like some help with this... </s>
<s> I'm looking to hopefully get a new desktop PC sometime soon, and I've just heard a few things that lead me to question just how much I really know about picking the right PC parts, so I thought I would ask around and get people's opinions on just what to look for. </s>
<s> I would like this new PC to be a great gaming rig, preferrably for the least amount of money. </s>
<s> I'm a fan of Intel and Nvidia, and I would really like this next PC to be able to run games in 3D and in 7.1 surround sound. </s>
<s> If possible, it should play games like Witcher 2 (new, really awesome looking games) on max graphics, but I would also like to use it for Star Wars: The Old Republic (whenever it comes out). </s>
<s> It should be easily upgradable (should the need arise), and last as is for a while (I hesitate to use the term &quot;futureproof&quot;). </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Also, any recommendations on where to find a 3D monitor, and any recommendations on what customization site to go through? </s>
<s> Or should I build it myself? </s>
<s> Keep in mind, I am a beginner at all this. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, everyone! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> And you being a beginner my advice is to get it all at one place. </s>
<s> I'm not happy as I read posts where folk are complaining about getting their 3D to work. </s>
<s> It appears there are not ways to solve their issues without changing video cards or displays so the lesson can cost more than getting a ready to use 3D game machine. </s>

<s> I would only recommending building your computer if you have a friend who can supervise. </s>
<s> I tried building my own computer, and honestly the building part was easy, it was just the troubleshooting afterwards if something goes wrong, that makes it hard. </s>
<s> If you're looking for a good company to build your computer, you might want to try Ironside, Ironsidecomputers.com. </s>
<s> They just started selling online earlier this year, but they do a fantastic job at building computers, and their customer service is great. </s>
<s> At least from my own experience. </s>
<s> I agree with grafixdude. </s>
<s> I don't know anything about building a computer your self, but I can say that Ironside did a great job on my computer. </s>
<s> I've had it for awhile now, and so far I haven't had a single problem. </s>
<s> In my opinion it was definitely worth the money. </s>
