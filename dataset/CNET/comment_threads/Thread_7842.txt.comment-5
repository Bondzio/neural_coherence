It is making good contact, I had a blank screen prior to installing the new battery.
It is a 3 volt battery and the old one read .4 volts.
Battery is properly installed.
Now I get a message &quot;CMOS checksum bad&quot; Press F1 to run setup Press F2 to load default values and continue_ Pressing F1 or F2 has no effect on the screen/system
