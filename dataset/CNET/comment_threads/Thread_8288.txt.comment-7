Hello again, yes sorry but I was trying to download directly and why I do not know .
Anyway, I made a USB and booted from it and nothing happened.
I do not know what to expect to be honest.
Would Ubuntu come up automatically?
sorry but I am beginning on this path but very eager and determined I tired to eject the usb and message said the file was in use by system but could not see anything anyways thanks Reza
