&gt;&gt;try updating the drivers, and I think you will have to use one of the PS (post script) ones.&lt;&lt; Thanks for suggestion, unfortunately I already tried this.
It is definately the printer and Wordperfect.
I switched with co-worker and her printer (HP) worked fine.
I may have to see if we can make switch permanent or see if boss will spring for new printer.
But will would like to see if I can resolve it first.
