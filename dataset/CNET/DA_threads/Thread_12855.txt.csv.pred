1.1.1	I 've read a lot about both of these systems , and the majority of reviews are very positive .	St
1.1.2	The price difference does not concern me .	St
1.1.3	I am by no means an audiophile , and I 'm pretty sure that the difference in satellite sound will not concern me .	St
1.1.4	What I am most concerned about is the subwoofer .	St
1.1.5	I primarily listen to rock music , but I do enjoy a little bit of everything .	St
1.1.6	I know that the Klipsch sub is able to hit lower notes , but does this actually mean anything ?	Ques
1.1.7	Can anyone recommend one sub over the other ?	Ques
1.1.8	This system will travel back and forth with me to school , so durability and portability are also a bit of a concern , but I do n't expect the speakers to be banged up .	St
1.1.9	Also any comments about any aspect of each product is really appreciated .	Polite
1.1.10	None of the stores around me carry either of these products to listen to , and I 'd have to drive about a half hour to pick up the Klipsch ... the z2300 is closer .	St
1.1.11	I 'm having a really hard time deciding , so any and all input is greatly appreciated !	St
1.2.1	I have n't listened to the Klipsch , but I 've never been a fan of the brand - too much sizzle comin ' out of their horn-loaded tweeters ... but some people like that ... : ?	Ques
1.2.2	I have the Z-2300s , and I like them a lot .	St
1.2.3	For computer speakers , they 're great- they even have a semblance of a sound-stage !	St
1.2.4	I do n't think that you 'll have to worry about low-end output - If you 're going back and forth to school , I 'm assuming that you 're not going to be putting them in a very large room - you should easily be able to reach adequate sound pressure levels- as always , take a little care with the placement of the sub .	St
1.2.5	Oh , on the portability side of things ... they 're not very ... the set probably weighs 40 lbs+ .	St
1.2.6	Oh , and to directly address your question about the real-world difference in frequency response range of the two subs - the cnet review said that there was some distortion ...	St
1.2.7	I would take the sub with less distortion any day , even if it does n't go as low .	St
1.2.8	A good sub , that 's setup well , will blend in with the main channels - if you close your eyes , you should n't be able to tell where it is , bass frequencies are omnidirectional .	St
1.2.9	Distortion kills that illusion .	St
1.2.10	That , and the fact that you probably wont miss that frequency range anyway ( unless you listen to pipe organs !	St
1.2.11	) , would make me lean towards the z-2300s	St
1.3.1	I really appreciate the information you 've provided , thanks .	Polite
1.3.2	Definitely going to check out the z2300s .	St
1.3.3	Now do you have specific advice on sub placement ?	Ques
1.3.4	Or somewhere to find out about that stuff ?	Ques
1.4.1	In a nutshell - front of the room , near ( but not in ! )	St
1.4.2	a corner or wall .	St
1.4.3	Not-so-nutshell - if you have enough cable , place the sub where you would normally listen .	St
1.4.4	Play something with at least somewhat musical bass .	St
1.4.5	Walk around near the front of the room slowly , listening to the changes in the quality of the bass - bass frequencies/waves are long , as such very dependant on room shape , size and location within that space- it 'll sound different at point A than it will at point B , even if they 're only a foot apart .	St
1.4.6	So , on your walkabout , you 'll find a place where it sounds best - good oomph , but not too bloated and boomy - that 's where you want to put the sub .	St
1.4.7	Again , pay particular attention to the areas to the front of the room , near a corner or wall , but never up against one .	St
1.4.8	Also , never put a sub at the halfway point between opposite walls - the waves will reflect and tend cancel each other out .	St
1.4.9	After you get the sub placed , fiddle with the sub volume 'til it matches what 's coming out of the L & R speakers ( the z-2300 has a bass volume knob in addition to the master volume on the wired control ) .	St
1.4.10	If you REALLY want to get the most out of them ( hehhehheh ) go to RadioShack and get a $ 30 Sound Pressure Level ( SPL ) meter and a test disc and balance along the frequency range to your heart 's content !	St
1.5.1	I should clarify - when I say to place the sub where you would normally listen , I mean , where you , yourself , would be when you 're listening - if you would most likely sit 2 feet in front of the computer when listening , put it there .	St
1.5.2	If you 're going to listen more from the edge of your bed , put it there , etc .	St
1.6.1	Great stuff , ca n't thank you enough for the info !	Polite
