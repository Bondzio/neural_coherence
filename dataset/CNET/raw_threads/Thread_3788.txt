The motherbaord is a 2003 Bayfield, the memory chip is a 256MB SDRAM DDR DIMM 184 PC133. I want to put a 1 Gig chip in but not sure if the faster chips will work in the motherboard. I dont need the faster speed chip, but they are all that is available now and also much cheaper. Do you think a PC2700 or something similar will work in a 2003 Bayfield Motherboard. I think all it takes is One Memory Chip. I haven't opened the case up yet because I need it recording my store. Thanks!

That 184 is a valid pin count so I'm not sure what you have but the mix isn't compatible. You'll need to open the case, I suspect. I can't find that board at Crucial so maybe it has another name.

The problem is that many chipsets didn't support such large memory sticks back then for simple reasons. I won't detail how the world has changed but I find some that find it incredible that a machine today doesn't support today's sticks and drives. But it is so. Moving on. http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/dsktpboards/d865gbf might be this board. http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d865gbf/sb/CS-027111.htm does list a 1GB stick so all that you can do is try it and hope the stick's organization is fine. This is not to offer a course in memory tech but to write I find the speed to not be the problem here but the organization. Bob
