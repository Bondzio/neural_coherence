Thanks for the replies guys.
I appreciate the heads up on the financials with Sun I will for sure look into that.
I understand the point you are trying to make about processor performance.
However, as you can see from my handle, I am but a lowely intern doing research and was given these requirements from the boss.
He basically said he wanted to double the processing and ram of the current mainframe we have that runs at 50mips, dual processor 4gb ram setup and have at minimum the same ~144GB of storage space.
I have been looking and San's and you have lead me into what would have been my next question.
In these new servers where would i get better performance in terms of speed, internal SCSI disk drives or a fiber SAN?
