as for the conner drive, here's my suggestions.
1) disassemble it... hds are really cool devices their innards make really interesting paperweights/conversation pieces.
2) get sunday's circulars and find a nice new hd for your main pc.
$60 should get you 160gb or more.
3) put the old drive from your main pc in your hobby pc and start tinkering with stuff you'd never do with your main pc.
install linux.
make a backup device.
make a firewall.
geek out!
