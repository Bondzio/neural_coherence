my setup: sbc yahoo dsl standard speedstream dsl modem hooked up to smc router (router has printer-sharing usb hub, wireless capability, two antennae) two desktops, one laptop: one desktop connected by ethernet cord to the router, other desktop using a hawking usb wireless network card, the laptop with internal wireless card; all machines run windows xp the laptop runs a custom edition of zonealarm software firewall (university of chicago edition) dhcp, auto-acquire ip addresses on ... i didn't touch any of the default plug and play settings my problem: i'm plug and play right now: i installed all the relevant drivers for the hardware that came on cd, but never set up a network with windows xp.
and it works -- with a catch: every so often, the two &quot;sharing&quot; computers -- both my laptop and the desktop with a usb wireless card -- would drop the connection.
essentially, the ip would expire on my home network, and my two sharing computers would get &quot;invalid ip address&quot; through dhcp.
the &quot;host&quot; desktop would still have access though, through the ethernet wire.
my temporary solution so far is to pull the power plug on my router (not the dsl modem) in order to force a reset of the ip address.
can any of you experts tell me a way around this?
if it requires running a formal home network setup, etc.
or, is there some app that i can run from a sharing computer to reset the host comp's ip?
because that seems to be the key problem, the ip becoming invalid after a few hours of use.
btw, i've tried once to set up a home network through the xp control panel walkthrough, but none of my comps recognized that setup.
what else ... the computers aren't invisible to each other on the network; i can access shared documents, if that gives any indication of the extent to which this is a network.
much appreciated for help!
