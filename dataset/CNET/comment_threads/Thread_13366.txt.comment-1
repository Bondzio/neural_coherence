Currently unit is HP slimline s3100n with AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 4000+ 2.10GHz, 2GB ram, 32 bit system.
Running Nvidia GeForce 6150 LE video card.
Video source is Sony camera HDR-SR7 60GB HDDD with AVCHD format.
Pininacle Studio's (running Plus V12) support told me I have to upgrade processor & video card for AVCHD format.
Pinnacle reccomends Core 2 Duo 2.6 GHz min.
and Nvidia 8800 (need 256GB or higher) My question is: What is the most effective upgrade without having to change out processors sockets, cooling fans, etc?
