<s> I have added a external USB HDD to one of the computers on a three computer network. </s>
<s> How do I add it to the work group? </s>
<s> WXP SP2 </s>
<s> And you can use it across your network. </s>
<s> And when you power down the PC it's connected to it's not shared any more. </s>
<s> And if you power it off it's not shared any more. </s>
<s> It won't stay shared unless it's an internal drive. </s>
<s> Don't ask me how I know. </s>

<s> My mini-Schnauzer is smarter than your honor student. </s>
<s> no matter how many time my PC has been off or restarted. </s>
<s> I believe it might be because the drive is seen in the BIOS by it's model # and maybe more. </s>
<s> Windows device manager doesn't see it as a generic but displays its full model #. </s>
<s> I can disconnect it and take it to another PC. </s>
<s> As long as I plug it back into the same USB port, everyone is happy and it remains shared. </s>
<s> Maybe because it is a SATA drive. </s>
<s> So I just got me a longer SATA cable and extended the power. </s>
<s> It sits on my computer. </s>
<s> Slightly modded. </s>
<s> http://www.wayne2.net/modded.jpg Fast flash, the fan is spinning. </s>
<s> I'm not sure why you can't get it to work with USB. </s>
<s> My external is also SATA on the inside and works fine. </s>
<s> My ASUS MB is 5 years old now so it's old by some standards. </s>
<s> I can even see the external's drive letters when booting from DOS disks. </s>
<s> It would seem if you could do that you could get the HDs fully ID'd. </s>
<s> Perhaps the external enclosure's interface is the problem. </s>
