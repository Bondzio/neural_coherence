before my trusty roommate was shipped off to iraq, i bought his router so now i have two exactly same routers, the linksys wrt320n.
both units are still using oem firmware.
i have been searching online to find out how i can use both in my network.
i would like to use one for g network at 2.4mhz and another for n at 5mhz.
the information i found online is very technical and for a noob like myself, little hard to follow.
can anyone here give some pointers on how to set up my network?
i have been researching online for the past week or so and i am still confused...
