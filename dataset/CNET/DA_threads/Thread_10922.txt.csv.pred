1.1.1	Hello Everyone , I am in need of a new software to connect to the internet wirelessly .	St
1.1.2	I currently have a waveplus wp 1200 802.11b wireless pcmcia card on the laptop .	St
1.1.3	It came with the Quetec connection software ( quetec.ca ) .	St
1.1.4	Unfortunately I believe either the software or hardware is bad , maybe both .	St
1.1.5	The thing connected for a brief few seconds got lost it completely afterwards , the program sometimes can detect wireless networks and says that it connects to them but no browsing or pinging is able .	St
1.1.6	Anybody know of a program that is preferrably free that I can use with my adapter to connect to wireless networks ( windows ME ) ?	Ques
1.2.1	If drivers , support , then head to http : //www.quetec.ca/ BUT I see no mention of YOUR WIFI ROUTER .	St
1.2.2	Some do buy such cards but think they do n't need to provide the access .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	My router is a wrt54g linksys router .	St
1.3.2	It recognized my laptop because and is in the dhcp active ip table and was connected for a brief few seconds , pulled up google and yahoo , but lost it .	St
1.4.1	But my initial thoughts are ... 1 .	Polite
1.4.2	No mention of the gritty details .	St
1.4.3	Make/model laptop and most important , who installed that OS .	St
1.4.4	Here 's why .	St
1.4.5	Most will install the OS but laptop drivers are not something Microsoft will install .	St
1.4.6	2 .	St
1.4.7	If the product is defective .	St
1.4.8	Return it .	St
1.4.9	3 .	St
1.4.10	Try Linux .	St
1.4.11	Use google.com and see if DSL ( Damn Small Linux ) can use that card .	St
1.4.12	Bob	St
1.5.1	Dell Inspiron 5000e .	St
1.5.2	The os came with the laptop from store ( do n't know where , was my a friends laptop ) .	St
1.5.3	Quetecs support is nil .	St
1.5.4	Their website does n't even work .	St
1.5.5	I do n't think it works with linux/unix .	St
1.5.6	For compatibility the cards requirements said only windows versions .	St
1.6.1	You do n't know how the OS was installed .	St
1.6.2	That 's alright .	St
1.6.3	Now you can dig around Dell 's site for all the drivers .	St
1.6.4	A clean install of the OS and Dell 's drivers might fix this .	St
1.6.5	Before all that .	St
1.6.6	Go to some free hotspot and try again .	St
1.6.7	Bob	St
