<s> I have Windows XP on my pc. </s>
<s> My question is: Can I redo a hard drive, it has already been formatted and partitioned once, but at the time I wasn;t sure of how to turn a 40gig drive into 2 20gigs. </s>
<s> I ended up with four partitions on a 40gig. </s>
<s> three of those four are WAY too small, so I wanted to know if there is any way to go back and strart from the beginning again, without causing a HUGE headache. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> (I would like to make it only two partitions instead of four.) </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> usaully hitting a function key or the delete key (it says how to when ya first boot) and change the primary boot to the cdrom drive, then put in your backup copy of windows xp that came with your computer. </s>
<s> It'll boot off of the cd. </s>
<s> From there you can delete all your partitions and start over again. </s>
<s> When it asks to format do a low-level format (the one thats not quick). </s>
<s> One thing to note though is that you should make sure you have all your drivers. </s>
<s> At least your internet drivers, so you can download the fresh ones from the internet if you have to. </s>
<s> Also, make sure you have your firewall running before you load your internet drivers. </s>
<s> i would not suggest u to make it within windows. </s>
<s> Because if u merge partitions (that is delete) u will lose data ur partition contained, besides it's quite difficult to complete. </s>
<s> The easiest way is to download partition software and merge those two unwanted partitions. </s>
<s> Using software u won't lose any data. </s>
<s> As for software: i'd recommend Disk Director developed by acronis company. </s>
<s> It's much cheaper than partition magic and has some extra features, such as recovery expert. </s>
<s> This Utility recovers ur accidently delete data (partitions). </s>
<s> the main con here that it's not free to use software. </s>
<s> Disk Director ~ 45$. </s>
<s> http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/diskdirector/ whatever, u'd like to use way 1 : backup ur needed data and it's better backup on other removable disks (CD/DVD/USB drive). </s>
<s> but, in this case u'll need backup software. </s>
<s> i'd recommend to use partitioing software. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the info. </s>
<s> on re-partitioning hard drive. </s>
<s> You ALL have a GREAT DAY!!!!! </s>
<s> Thanks Again!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> hope we brough out the right solution have fun with ur partitioned disk. </s>
