I didn't know where to start with the print sever on this setup.
I just knew that the modem should be in bridged mode and the router should be left to do the address translations.
I've never seen a setup with double NATing before, so I thought something was wrong.
He's trying to connect a wireless linksys print server when he already has a wireless router.
Should just be a non-wireless print server.
I think I may leave that one alone.
