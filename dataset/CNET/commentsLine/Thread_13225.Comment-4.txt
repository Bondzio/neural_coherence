as vapcmd said you don't need on that board because it's new.
people with older boards may need adaptors for the sata power connector, or a pci sata card if they don't have onboard sata connectors.
there are no con's to sata hdd's, they are faster.
older systems may need sata drivers on floppy disk to install xp.
your board sata can be set in bios to ide mode, so you don't need to worry about the driver for xp.
