i am trying to install the third internal hard drive inside my sony vaio computer case.
there are only two bays for the hard drives.
there is enough space for the third one, though.
does anyone know what kind of brackets i could use to install the third drive?
is there a site i can purchase a bay for one drive or some kind of hardware which will hold the drive in place?
thanks a lot.
alex.
