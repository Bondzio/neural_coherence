<s> My problem: I tried my Windows PC on a new wireless network (which is usually used by my friend's Mac). </s>
<s> My PC seems to pick up a series of local connections none of which are picked up by the Mac (which picks up an entirely different array of networks). </s>
<s> Moreover, when I try to connect to one of the unsecured networks showing on my network, I am told that &quot;You are connecting to the unsecured network...&quot;; I hit &quot;Continue anyway&quot; which only triggers my computer to rescan for networks in range, bringing up the same list as before. </s>
<s> Needless to say, I can't connect to the internet through any connection, let alone our own home connection. </s>
<s> What can I do to help my computer find the right networks and connect? </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> The top posts in this forum offer our suggested setups. </s>
<s> While we pass over it quickly you should name your router so you can find it quickly. </s>
<s> Also with all the issues that abound with unsecured networks you find we write to use WPA and if you can, WPA2. </s>
<s> That should help. </s>
