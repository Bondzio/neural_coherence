11537	1	165047	1825670	1825537	Ray Harinec	3/22/06 1:26 PM	1.14303396E12	complete	processors work each properly written software seems obvious working different parts problem same time putting together answer pays off idea clock speed cpu equaled performance false proved few years amd cpus performing intel cpus ran higher speeds got bad intel months ago ceased including clock speed part their cpu model number generation intell cpus hatching run lower clock speeds perform biggest problem clock speed causes cpu extremely hot intels cpus got over hundred watts thus decided go dual core couldnt use top speed ones dual simply couldnt cool total architecture design cpu chipset cache determine performance
