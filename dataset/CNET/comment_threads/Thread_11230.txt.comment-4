Sony is loosing an estimated $500 - $450 for every PS3( playstation 3) console sold.
it cost an estimated $900 to make, and probably sold to retailers at like $400 then sold to end consumers at $500 and $600.
400-900=500 net loss The blu-ray drive alone costs them like $300+ ea..... (normal blu-ray drives cost upwards of $1,000) the Cell Prossesor cost them like 200+ ea..... +all the other stuff like the Graffix prossesor one hell of a losss on their part But at these pricess the PS3 ..... is HELLLLA Cheap
