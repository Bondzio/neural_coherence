10697	0	597920	5480648	NR	June0303	7/25/13 12:04 PM	1.37475384E12	Why is my computer suddenly getting hot?(CPU)	So I made a custom PC few months ago, and It works perfectly, its' temp was normal, everything was plugged in right, but after 2 months, my PC started to make loud fan noise. So when I checked it's (CPU) temperature it was 61 C on idle. With no programs on. I checked the AMD processor website and choose my CPU. It says it can only handle up to 62 C... So I checked my CPU, and apparently I put too much thermal paste and it leaked to the bottom of my chip (but very very little amount). So I got some 99%USP Isopropyl Alcohol and cleaned it very carefully. Then I applied new thermal paste. But it still does that.... Also by the way there is a tiny crack on the top of the CPU.... The heatsink/fan has tiny amount of thermal paste on it. &lt;div&gt; My PC specs. CPU-AMD Phenom II x4 955BE CPU cooler-Regular stock fan that came with the CPU GPU-MSI r6450 2gb gddr3 PSU-Corsair CX430 430w RAM-8gb ddr3 *2 case fans(120mm)* &lt;/div&gt; I hope you could help me, thanks

Now there are some newer folk that think they can add more case fans but for many builders and gamers they just leave the side cover off. If I have the time I head to my shop area to carve out a square foot out of the cover then I hot glue screen or speaker mesh over that. Bob
