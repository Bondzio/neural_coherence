I have an I/O Magic DVD+RW+R External Usb 2.0 Duel Format 8x DVD Rewritable Drive with InstantCD/DVD and Pinnacle Studio 8 It use to work just fine till I put it up for awhile to get through the holidays now when I plug it up it will stay on for just a few minutes then go off and on.
I see an icon in the taskbar that says found new hardware.
I try to click on it but nothing happens Finally It will show an icon to safely remove hardware What can I do to solve this problem
