1.1.1	I work for as a Computer Systems Manager for a large government agency with a baffling problem .	St
1.1.2	Some of what I will say below makes zero sense , which is why I am baffled .	St
1.1.3	I have a site that received an Ethernet-enabled Toshiba EStudio E452 .	St
1.1.4	We enabled it for Ethernet and plugged it into a nearby wall jack .	St
1.1.5	It does not work .	St
1.1.6	The fixed IP does not ping and it picks up a 192 # on a DHCP setup .	St
1.1.7	We have a nearby working network printer , a Lexmark T632 .	St
1.1.8	We take it 's network cable and plug it into the Toshiba 's drop .	St
1.1.9	All works well .	St
1.1.10	We then take the Lexmark 's cable and plug the copier into the Lexmark 's drop , we get both fixed IP and a valid DHCP network IP .	St
1.1.11	We switch wires and every things the same way .	St
1.1.12	It is NOT the wire .	St
1.1.13	We run a new drop for the Toshiba and replace its NIC .	St
1.1.14	No dice .	St
1.1.15	We go into the Ethernet settings and try all the settings , resetting the card each time , no dice .	St
1.1.16	We change ports for the Toshiba on the switch , no dice .	St
1.1.17	One thing I notice .	St
1.1.18	When an Ethernet drop works , the light on the left side stays green and the light on the right goes green intermittently and randomly .	St
1.1.19	When the Toshiba is attached to its drop and not seeing the network , that right side light flashes green on a regular basis .	St
1.1.20	What am I missing here ?	Ques
1.2.1	Usual RJ45 indicators : Left Green Linked Blinking Network activity Right Unlit 10 Green 100 Yellow 1000 Run a cable directly from printer to switch port and see what happens .	St
1.3.1	To see if the Ethernet wire or the port on the switch is the problem , connect a laptop to it and see if you can see the network .	St
1.3.2	If you have internet connection to it , see if you can access the internet .	St
1.4.1	You have n't mentioned much about the actual problem you 're having .	St
1.4.2	All you say is you 've plugged it in and & quot ; It does not work. & quot ; What is the specific problem when you try to join the Toshiba to your network 's domain ?	Ques
1.4.3	Have you even tried to tried joining it to the domain ?	Ques
1.4.4	The government domains I 've worked with require a fixed IP , meaning you 'll need to turn off DHCP and maunally configure IP/DNS settings on the Toshiba .	St
1.5.1	I can not ping the copier after I attach an Ethernet cable to it a d give it a known valid IP on the network .	St
1.5.2	If I can not ping it , then I can not set it up as a network printer which is why I am writing this .	St
1.5.3	BTW , I plug in a laptop and it picks up an IP with no problem via the same cable used by the non-connecting copier .	St
1.6.1	When the laptop was connected to the tosh-drop , were you able to ping the laptop and can you ping another device from it ?	Ques
1.6.2	You said the that it picked up an ip address from a dhcp , that 's dynamic .	St
1.6.3	If you have the dhcp set up to give it a number , make sure the tosh-printer is set do take an ip dynamically ( or automatically ) .	St
1.6.4	Do n't try to give it a static address .	Sug
1.6.5	If you 're required to give it a static address , then make sure you have the right subnet and gateway .	Sug
1.7.1	When I plugged in a laptop , I got a correct IP and was able to ping to it and from it to a connected PC and printer .	St
1.7.2	BTW , when I first plugged in the copier to its drop , and let it try to pick up DHCP , it picked up a 169.254 address .	St
1.7.3	All gateways and subnets have been checked thoroughly .	St
1.7.4	Like I said , it is a bizarre problem .	St
1.8.1	Since the Lexmark and the Toshiba are right next to each other and the drops are not too far from each other , why do n't you just switch the connection .	St
1.8.2	Lexmark & gt ; Tosh-drop and Copier & gt ; Lexmark-drop .	St
1.8.3	I think you mentioned that if you switch the cables , they work fine , right ?	Ques
1.8.4	You may not even have to move the devices if the patch cables are long enough .	St
1.8.5	This will solve it until you figure out the culprit .	St
1.9.1	Yes , criss-crossing the wires will work , it just is an ugly solution .	St
1.9.2	And while it does work , I just want to know why it does not work the other way .	St
