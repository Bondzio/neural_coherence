it's still debatable about how terrible these things are to setup but here's one i one -&gt;  from  however this is still too rough on setup in my opinion but the price was right and i have some usb memory stick served up too.
i put a watt meter on it and it sits there drawing 2 watts so it's not as bad as some others.
