<s> I am currently running on an outdated Intel Celeron 1.7Ghz with 533Mhz FSB and no real graphic to speak of. </s>
<s> 1GM DDR2 RAM 80GB HD(5400rpm). </s>
<s> As you can imagine, it is slowly slowing... </s>
<s> I am looking for a new (laptop) computer to do the following: -Do school work in Web Development -Photoshop (mostly web graphics and amateur photography editing) -YouTube video editing (rarely DVD) -Occasional browser-based games and what not -Want to stream web-based TV to my HDTV periodically OK, now the real question. </s>
<s> I have a moderate understanding of computer specs, but not sure how they really translate into day-to-day use. </s>
<s> I am currently looking at a few laptops by HP and can list specs, but really just need some practical advice here. </s>
<s> Do I need a &quot;Core2 Duo, 512 GPU, 3G DDR2&quot; type setup, or a &quot;Core i7, 1GB GPU, 4GB DDR3&quot; type setup? </s>
<s> I understand some of the technical differences, just not sure how they would really translate into working performance. </s>
<s> I can also select from a few AMD processors(turion ii X2 for instance). </s>
<s> Thanks so much, I have spent hours researching and just can't come up with solid in-life advice. </s>
<s> Do I need a &quot;Core2 Duo, 512 GPU, 3G DDR2&quot; type setup, or a &quot;Core i7, 1GB GPU, 4GB DDR3&quot; type setup? </s>
<s> Either are nice but I'd stick to the 4GB machines since you move solidly into the 64 bit wave and won't feel left behind. </s>
<s> The memory on the GPU is all about gaming. </s>
<s> So no real gain for your listed uses. </s>
<s> I am using something along the first model (C2D w/4GB DDR3) and it's nice. </s>
<s> But will shop for a quad desktop later this year. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> Gaming really isn't my thing. </s>
<s> Does Photoshop process through the GPU or CPU, mostly (I haven't found a solid answer online)? </s>
<s> Do you think (for my uses) that it is worth the extra $200ish for quad-core? </s>
<s> Quad would also automatically give me the larger GPU. </s>
<s> Sorry for so volume of questions, I simply want to understand. </s>
<s> This question going to anybody BTW. </s>
<s> CPU. </s>
<s> There is some nugget that posts about GPU processing but for photoshop, for the rest of us it's the CPU. </s>
<s> After all this, I ordered a quad core unit just minutes ago. </s>
<s> But back to you. </s>
<s> To let photoshop stretch its legs, go 4GB and 64 bit. </s>
<s> 200 may be about right, but where are you shopping? </s>
<s> For example this 8GB monster at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883108209 while it's on Vista seems to be a deal I would have considered. </s>
<s> We still have 2 more Windows 7 updrades left. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks again Bob, Well I was hoping to use my student status as an advantage and get an edu discount from HP. </s>
<s> They offer the best discount that I can find. </s>
<s> i was looking at the DV6T which comes in C2D or i7 (and AMD). </s>
<s> There are several quick-ship models as well as customized models which allow me to tweak with the specs a little. </s>
<s> Your link seems to point to a desktop. </s>
<s> I am really looking for a laptop. </s>
<s> As for the prices, they are $705 for C2D (with a faster FSB and 4GB RAM (no GPU)) and $915 for i7 (4GB, 1333mhz, 1GB GPU). </s>
<s> I just couldn't find cheaper. </s>
<s> Add on wireless-n, 12 cell battery and a few customizations and its like $1,045. </s>
<s> -Jared </s>
<s> Forgot the AMD model. </s>
<s> It is the same system but AMD Turion II Ultra Dual-Core M620 Mobile Processor (2.5GHz) 6144MB DDR2 memory For $911 </s>
<s> I went with the HP DV6-1361SB fro 799 at Newegg. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16834157045 That's what I'm on today. </s>
<s> Fairly fast and my only quibble is the keyboard is a little slick. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There is also a 14.1&quot; Intel i5 ($779) which has a way faster clock speed, but no threading like the i7. </s>
<s> I am so confused. </s>
<s> : ) Thanks for clearing me up on the GPU. </s>
<s> Not having one will save me a good $50-$100. </s>
<s> Nice system. </s>
<s> Exactly like one of the ones I was looking at. </s>
<s> The i5 is almost the rebadge of the Core 2 Duo line. </s>
<s> If we are to compare models, name names or give up links. </s>
<s> Here's the killer Best Buy exclusive -&gt; http://ces.cnet.com/8301-31045_1-10429305-269.html Almost good enough to consider but not to displace what I use today. </s>
