You'll need to provide more description about your DVR.
That's what you'll need to figure out, how (on your DVR) you can access a setup page to set a static ip.
For a temporary fix, if you have other computers on your network, give them all static IPs.
Then tell your router to only give out 1 ip for the dhcp network, and your dvr will always have the same IP.
For instance, set your IP range for the DHCP to 192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.2
