yeah, d/l the sit, its not intrusive.
it will check your system and compare it to what vista needs.
understand also, that vista will come in various flavours and need a *minium* to run for its most basic release, as more bells&whistles are added, sure it needs more.
as in oses before it, i don't doubt that vista(when openly sold) will run its own tests and see if it can be installed, thus the last test before installing for sure.
