If it is simply plugged in without recieving or being used to make a call could it still cause interference with your 802.11g network?

Have wireless cable modem in house, plenty of bluetooth devices. Despite all that the phone worked great until about two weeks ago when unbrearable static crept in. All the doc says is to move the base away from other electrical devices. That's no fix and still searching for source of problem. Read post on another forum that said that while the base transmits at 5.8ghz the handsets transmit at 2.4ghz. Anyone know if this is true ? Off to try swapping channels on cable modem again...
