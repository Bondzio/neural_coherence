i'm looking for help on deciding what would be best.
i'm looking to purchase an inexpensive tablet for my mother-in-law.
does not need to be anything special...i do own an ipad 2 and it certainly doesn't need to be anything of that quality.
really, she just wants to be able to read books on it (like an e-reader) and surf the web a little.
doesn't need to have the best app selection or availability in the world, but if one has better access than the other, then great.
i'm looking for something around the $250 mark.
in order of importance for what she would need: 1) needs to be the larger 10&quot; screen size 2) read books 3) web surfing - doesn't need to be blazing fast...just adequate.
although, if it would display web pages in their &quot;true form&quot; that is cerainly a plus compared to something that will only display them in their &quot;mobile&quot; format 4) general email really, i'm looking at the following.
but if there is something better, by all means please suggest.
if not, can you recommend from this list based on my needs?
1) viewsonic gtablet 10.1 - can get around $250 right now 2) archos 101 internet tablet - can get around $230 right now 3) hp touchpad - i know of the firsesale, but because of it you can still get them right now for around $250 so i'm throwing it into the mix thank you for your help!!
