I also have the high speed cable internet service that provides up to 10 Mbps DL speed. Since my router still works, is there any reason I should replace it or is it possible it degrades in speed as it ages? It just seems my internet speed isn't as fast as it used to be, that's why I was curious. Thanks.

Or is it possible due to being on cable that people in my area using things like Netflix also affect &quot;MT&quot; internet speed as well? I remember reading years ago that if enough people in the area are using the cable for internet, it can affect the speed whereas that doesn't apply to the DSL speed.

Unless one is limiting their access to the DSL provider, the &quot;internet&quot; accesses are affected. There are long nice articles about how this works and why the pipes are getting clogged.

For example, if you have a broadband cable ISP, this has a fixed pool of bandwidth that's determined by the infrastructure of fibre optic and copper cables that the ISP has installed. So, you might buy 12Mb/s downlink internet, and some times of the day when there isn't much usage, you might get 20+Mb/s. Other times of the day, like the evening, when everyone else is getting Netflix instant movies, or downloading other streaming video sources, your speed could go down 6Mb/s (these are just examples, but I've seen it happen at my house *smile*). Also, while the maximum speed of your router via wireless may be 54Mb/s (wireless-g), your router will be delivering half that if you're lucky, on a strong connection. You laptop or whatever may show 54Mb/s, but that's just the speed of the connection according to the wireless internet interface driver or utility, that isn't the actual &quot;throughput&quot; being delivered. There's lot of overhead with wireless that takes away from the actual peak performance. And as you get farther away from your router with intervening walls, and your connection goes down from &quot;Excellent&quot;, the speed also suffers from that. You can see this if you look at some detailed router product reviews, like on the smallnetbuilder.com web site that has lots of router reviews. To get the actual throughput, try transferring a large file (1 GB or larger) from a wired system to a wireless system, and time the transfer. This will tell you how fast your wireless is really transferring. Anyways, there are other things to consider than just taking full advantage of your download speed. For example, if you are streaming HDTV from files on an HTC, or running backups to an external disk connected to the router or to another computer, you may find that having Gb/s wired ports is useful to you. So to answer your question, you really need to assess your needs against how things are currently working. If you current router is fulfilling your needs, then stay with it. If you need more speed for specific reasons, like streaming video, or running backups, or whatever, then you should make a plan on how you can reach your goals. There are a surprising number of ways of getting more bandwidth in your home network, and doing some reading on a site like smallnetbuilder.com can be very helpful. They also have user forums where you can talk about these things and get information from really experienced people.

Given the setup you describe with an 802.11G Router (54 Mbps) on a 10 Mbps cable line, the router won't slow the traffic down, there is plenty of spare capacity. That's the &quot;No&quot; part. The &quot;Yes&quot; part is a bit more complicated. Internally to your network, if you subscribed to a fast cable service, like the 100 Mbps or 200 Mbps offered by Virgin Media in the UK, then yes, a 54 Mbps will slow it down to 54 Mbps. You would need an N or N+ router (150 and 300 Mbps respectively) to get the full faster speed. There is one other circumstance on a G router and that is where you add to the network an older device with a B (11 Mbps) Network Interface Card (NIC). Most G routers will slow the whole internal network down to 11 Mbps, including any G NICs on the network because they are single channel. But again, this shouldn't affect you with a 10 Mbps cable feed. Most N routers don't have this problem because they broadcast on multiple channels. So internally, I don't think you have any problems, so unless your router breaks or you subscribe to a faster service, there isn't any real point in replacing it. Externally, it's a whole different kettle of fish! DSL is by far the worst, all carriers implement the service by providing a high speed trunk to the distribution cabinet (sometimes called a Fat Pipe) and then multiplexing a number of users off it, In the UK for example, a consumer ADSL link will multiplex up to 50 users and a business link will multiplex up to 30 users. The speed will be variable, depending how many users are on and what they are doing. If you log on at say 3:00 am, it's likely there won't be much contention and you'll get nominal contracted speed, not usually more because the ISPs throttle it (USA may be different, I defer to the local guys). But if you log on when the kids get home from school and they are all Facebooking, twittering, or even, shock horror, doing homework, you will find the speed somewhat patchy. Similarly, when their parents get home from work! So pick your time if you are doing anything heavy. Cable doesn't work the same way and different cable systems work differently. The Virgin Mobile system, for example, is susceptible to server load, rather than link load and their policy is (or was, when I was there) to add another server when the average load climbed above 70%. There was some load slowing but nothing like that on the more popular ADSL. And the other major factor on the internet is who you are logging in to. The speed you see will depend on the end to end speed of your link, so if you log into a slow website, yes, your speed will be slower than if you log into a fast one. But assuming your usage pattern hasn't changed, that shouldn't be a huge factor. And it remains to be seen what effect the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 will have. It &quot;should&quot; be better but if you have a router that doesn't suppost it natively or worse, your ISP doesn't, somewhere along the line, the IPv4 traffic will have to be tunnelled to IP v6 and vice versa. More processing &quot;could&quot; result in less speed - who knows? Isn't it all wet string and cocoa tins, anyway &lt;g&gt;?
