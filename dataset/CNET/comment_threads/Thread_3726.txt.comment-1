My computer has a K7S5A PRO Socket A Main Board.The CPU is an Athlon XP 2000 which I suspect to be defective.
The heatsink is held in place by two retentipon clips on either side of the heatsink unit.
I can't figure how to remove the clips from the socket 462 base so that I can get to the CPU.
There must be an easy way to do it, but I can't figure how.
HELP!!
Thanks, Ray Savage
