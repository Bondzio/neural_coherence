Are you saying it won't recongize a 40gb partition or a physical HD 40gb size.
Its important, as then you could partition a large HD into smaller partitions under 40gb, probably 32gb as the limit for each partition.
Did you visit the HD makers website for HD install s/w to help install beyond whatever the bios limits are?
good luck -----Willy
