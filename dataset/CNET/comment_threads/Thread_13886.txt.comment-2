That's the voltage for main memory, so you can see the results once the system gets used.
Voltages vary by at least +/- 10% aren't that much but it shouldn't be constantly at those levels, if so then replace with new power supply.
Being an older system system, the psu probably saw better days, but the expense of new psu and other repairs suggest to start looking for a newer system when funds are available as problems may crop-up sooner than later.
