since my post in 2008, i have personally experience a decline in product quality, and have seen a sharp decline in the quality of products, and support from hp.
although, this has been disappointing, i have seen a sharp increase in the quality of products, support, and market share of apple products.
while i highly recommend and regard the lenovo thinkpad products, i am now equally convinced that the apple macbook pro is by far a superior product to most every other platform today.
to be honest, if i had to buy a computer tomorrow, i would be torn between the latest thinkpad and the macbook pro.
i also have removed the ms windows vista business, from my thinkpad in favor of linux ubuntu 11.10.
