I use a HPf1903 19'' LCD it works well with Nivida GForce and with 1280X1040 Res.
Max it gives HD a new out look on HD.
Goes for about 795.00 on sale.
A little more than you said you wanted to pay.
But well worth it.
It Rocks!
No I mean It really rocks back and forth, Tilts and Telescopes about 6'' Versatile and very cool.
Will accept HDMI or Db25 or both and comes with the HDMI cable
