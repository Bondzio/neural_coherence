(Old MB had ''given up the ghost''.) I reinstalled the olds heatsink after cleaning the CPU core and heatsink an adding some fresh silicone thermal compound from Comp USA. It runs fine and dandy... but according to the BIOS (Award v.1.4)... the CPU temperature is peaking out at 65C. I've checked the documentation... the burn-out factor for this CPU is 90C... and all my Googling tells me that they run hot. I let the PC sit overnight in a cool room with the case open. Pressed the power button and within 4 seconds was in the ''PC Health'' secton of the BIOS... the CPU was showing 49C and slowly climbing. Should I assume that the CMOS temperature reading may be mis-calibrated? The heatsink is pleasantly warm... but never scalding hot. My options... replacing the ''stock'' heatsink and fan... or simply cleaning and the heatsink/cpu AGAIN and changing to ''arctic silver 5''. Or possibly adding another fan to the case? I ordered one of those PC Card exhaust fans from tigerdirect last night. My case does not seem to be set up for case fans, though... but there are a set of ''aeration holes'' near the back below the CPU... can a fan be mounted there? Thanks. ~Wayne

You should check the difference between idle and under load. Shouldn't be more than 10 to 20 degrees. As a precaution I would remove the heatsink and replace the thermal compound with arctic silver 5. Just remember a little goes along way, use too much and it will insulate against the heat and prevent proper cooling.A very thin film is enough. Also, make sure the heatsink is properly positioned.Just a few tips incase your not familiar with the process.

The heatsink surface should be considerably cooler. What temp does the CPU peak at when running with the case cover off and running programs that put a little load on the CPU? That'll tell you if adding case cooling will help.

If I were to put a fan on the back of the case, under the PSU and just under the CPU... should it exhaust to blow are in? There appears to be no opening in the front... just a row of slits in the side (bottom) of the chassis. Thansks again. ~Wayne

Very unusual case to not have a hole pattern in the rear for mounting a fan. Re the possibility of a front intake. Look very closely at the front from inside the computer. Don't be surprised to see a place to mount a fan. Many cases will not show the air intakes on the front plastic of the case. The air gets pulled in from the bottom front of the case and flows between the plastic front panel and the metal structure of the case. If one has the tower sitting on the floor, it becomes a great source of dust bunnies for that fan regardless how good a housekeeper there is. Do a google search for &quot;Speed Fan&quot;, download and install that. You can use its readings to compare to the BIOS readings, as well as being able to watch temp in real time.

Actually, I do see the holes for the fans on both ends of the case... but as you say, the plastic cover in the front confused me. I just reapplied the CPU with Artic Silver 5, and also picked up a copper heatsink and new fan... I noted that my old 'stock' fan said &quot;Budget&quot; on it. So far, so good... I'm seemingly running cooler now. With the case shut... it was running 65C+ under load before... now it's maxing out around 58 or 59C. When my PCI exhaust fan comes in the mail, I'll mount that below the graphics card and see if I can't take another degree or two off. Thanks again! ~Wayne
