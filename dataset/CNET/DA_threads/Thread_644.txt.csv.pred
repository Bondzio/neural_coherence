1.1.1	Hello , I just bought an external hard and plan to reformat it to NTFS .	St
1.1.2	I have a PC with Windows 2000 and a laptop with XP Pro that I will use it with .	St
1.1.3	I will also take it over to a friend 's house to transfer some music from his collection .	St
1.1.4	I believe that his external hard drive is formatted to FAT32 .	St
1.1.5	Might be an ignorant question , but will I be able to take files off of his FAT32 formatted external hard drive and transfer them to my NTFS formatted drive ?	Ques
1.1.6	In addition , if he has data stored on his Windows ME pc that I want , I am assuming that I can not take it since my drive is NTFS ?	Ques
1.1.7	Is that correct ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks in advance for any help .	St
1.2.1	But more to the point , for USB file system support your Windows 2000 works fine with FAT32 and NTFS .	St
1.2.2	Windows ME will only support FAT32 ( and the other FATs ) .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Ok , I understand .	St
1.3.2	So no issue with getting the files from his FAT external drive but I wo n't be able to plug into his ME pc , right ?	Ques
1.4.1	Can I plug my NTFS drive into Windows ME ?	Ques
1.4.2	Sure , but it wo n't be recognised .	St
1.4.3	For that direction of transfer use some FAT32 volume .	St
1.4.4	PLEASE EJECT SAID DRIVES PROPER since FAT32 drives are well known to corrupt or vanish if we lose power or pull the plug .	St

1.5.1	What I meant !	St
1.5.2	Thanks Bob .	St
