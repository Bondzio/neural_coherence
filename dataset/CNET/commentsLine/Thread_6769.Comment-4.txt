i read it and thought it was a new drive.
since it sounds like the old conflicting drive letter issue i wonder what other drive letters can be freed up.
for example in my (dead) hp g62 i could disable the sd card reader in device manager in a pinch.
i can't know what's not told and sorry about that.
