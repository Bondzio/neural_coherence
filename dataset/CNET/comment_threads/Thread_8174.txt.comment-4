I do some gaming.
I guess I would like to do a Raid 0 configuration to speed up my gaming.
My understanding is that I do not need a second operating system installed to do this.
I guess then, my questions are narrowed down to these: Am I going to have a problem running Raid 0 configuration with a 80+ GB sized SATA hardrive and a 60GB IDE hardrive?
If not, does anyone have any recommendations for a hardrive?
Lastly, What steps will I need to utilize in order to implement this process?
Thanks,
