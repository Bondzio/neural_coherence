question 1: is there a program i could use to make the drive spin up and move the lazer around to possibly clean it?
there are cleaner kits that you reach in and swap the lens.
question 2: is thereany other suggestions someone might have for possible fixes?
or any possible answers as to why this happened?
i've always used the drive lightly... i replace the drive since it's a commodity item and repair of those drives are not possible.
no vendor schematics, no spare parts and tech time exceeds the cost of a drive every time.
some want to fix the drive, but its best to let them figure out that such isn't going to happen.
usually they rack up phone bills greater than the cost of the new drive before it sinks in.
i hope this reply will hurry your epiphany.
your story is typical with some dvd type being hard to read and then it degrades further.
the laser loses power and soon nothing works.
try a cd lens cleaner, new firmware and then change the drive.
