So a couple of days ago I had a post about how I would go about using my external drive on a PC to transfer data (I've been using it on a Mac for several years). I was told that formatting it would erase the content so I opted not to do that. However, now when I tried to hook it up to the same Mac its been used on for years it won't mount at all. Instead it makes a weird clicking noise over and over and will not load! Does this mean the drive is dead and I've lost all my data?! I have never had a single problem with this drive and just the other day it was working fine. Is there no way to recover the data from my external drive at this point??

For example put the HDD in another enclosure. And when all fails you get it to http://www.drivesavers.com But may I ask where is the backup copy? Bob

I was copying everything from a Mac to the drive and my other (PC) computer. So everything is kind of spread out between the three but I didn't finish before this happened. Of course I have hard copies (cd's) of the music files but I've still got a good amount of stuff on that drive that I didn't get to copy...

That's a good decision on your part as some folk try to &quot;move&quot; rather than copy and lose stuff during the move. Mayne the new external case is the best idea and then a new drive for that case if the drive has failed. Bob
