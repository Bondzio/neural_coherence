..got a new dell dimension running winxp home in the b office.
after several tries with the network setup utility, i still can't get it to share files and printers with the computer in the a office, even though both computers go on the internet just fine.
..i used the network troubleshooter and got to the part about pinging the other computer.
i used ipconfig at the command prompt to find out the ip address for the b computer.
then i walked over to the a office to find the ip address of that machine.
then i tried to ping the b computer from a, and got nothing.
..ok, were getting somewhere.
..then, on a whim, i asked a to ping itself.
a normal response came back.
ok, thats good.
then i walked back to b and tried to ping a. a normal response came back.
hmmm.
.
.i can ping a from b, but i cant ping b from a. is that normal?
..then i asked b to ping itself.
..no response.
..now, how can a computer be unable to talk to its own self?
i checked the properties tab on the network connection for b, and everything appears to be nominal.
i set file and printer sharing on in the network setup utility.
can anybody tell me whats going on?
is this really weird, or am i just ignorant about something?
