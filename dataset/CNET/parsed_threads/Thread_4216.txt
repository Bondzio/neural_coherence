<s> Hello, I have external WD 1TB hard drive. </s>
<s> FAT32. </s>
<s> One day 3 folder in my hard turned into 32KB files. </s>
<s> I've red some articles and learned that it might be a cluster. </s>
<s> Dispite the fact, there was about 200GB data in these folders, hard drive's used and free space is same as it was. </s>
<s> So I think my data should be somewhere in the hard drive. </s>
<s> I've googled a lot, but I didn't found why my data turned into clusters. </s>
<s> I want to know how to recover my files of these 3 folders. </s>
<s> How to turn these clusters into folders with my data? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Windows has checked the file system and found no problems. </s>
<s> 192KB in bad sectors. </s>
<s> 32.768 bytes in each allocation unit. </s>
<s> 30.516.298 total allocation units on disk. </s>
<s> 11.341.087 allocation units available on disk. </s>

<s> The makers supply drives in FAT32 but it's far too unreliable for most of us. </s>
<s> You'll want to start over but use NTFS for Windows and Apple's file system on that system. </s>
<s> The files would be recovered from your backups or other copies. </s>
<s> This forum is full of posts about people who &quot;stored&quot; their last copy of files on these externals and learn first hand why we can't ignore backups. </s>
<s> -&gt; Try RECUVA at google.com then: GETDATABACK Zero Assumption Recovery Bob </s>
<s> If it is still relevant, the following post on Tech Support Forums might help you: http://www.techsupportforum.com/microsoft-support/windows-xp-support/420353-unrecoverable-error-convert-folder-file-y-n-yes.html#post2714618 The process of recovery is very time consuming, but can be well worth it for important or valuable files. </s>
<s> Proceed with caution through each step. </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>
