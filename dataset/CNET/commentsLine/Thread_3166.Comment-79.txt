if you have an external drive fail, it may not be the drive that has failed.
i have had computers in the home since 1990. i am currently running a network of 7 machines in my home.
since the beginning i have had one drive actually &quot;fail&quot;.
i have some drives that have been working for the full 19 years.
i currently have four external usb drives and one ethernet storage drive in the network.
the usb drives are the least reliable of those in my system, but the drives are not the problem, it is the case interface that seems to bail on me.
i have had only two of them fail in the past three years, the interfaces not the drives, i simply tore the cases open and pulled the drives and installed them in the computer as internal drives, and they work fine.
i am a fairly active gamer and i have 4 x 500gb in a non striped raid in my gaming machine today, all are over 6 years old and all are working well.
i have been told by some &quot;experts&quot; that certain brands are good and others are bad, i was told by a computer store owner that he would never use a western digital drive.
well, i am no fan of their software, but 95% of the drives i have been discussing are wd brand and i can't say they are the best only because i have not used others that much, i can tell you that in my experience, wds have been reliable for me since 1990, and still going.
