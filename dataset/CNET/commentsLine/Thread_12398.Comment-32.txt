macgirl...had you ever considered the xerox phaser 8560?
just asking because i too have an invitation/stationery business and wanted to know who else may have considred this and why or why not it was a viable option...how is that 6180 working for you?
i'm assuming you work with a mac...so is it mac compatible?
