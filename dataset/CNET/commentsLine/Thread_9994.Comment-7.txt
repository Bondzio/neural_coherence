ok, here's what i'd do to rule out the os.
can you download some &quot;live linux&quot; iso or even some utility iso and burn to cd.
see if the lines are still there.
if they are, it's not windows.
you're left with the display card or the monitor or cable.
if the cable is detachable, you can try another or just reseat things.
i suspect you have.
you're going to run out of options if you cannot try another monitor or plug this one into another pc but, if it came down to only the video display device or monitor, my guess would be the monitor has the problem.
