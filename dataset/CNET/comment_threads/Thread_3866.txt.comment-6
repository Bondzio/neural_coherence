Late yesterday I decide to go on Chat with a HP tech after having no luck whatsoever at it website to see if there were any alerts for my printer or new drivers.
Well it turns out there are two critical updates for HP Printers for this very problem: 1) Critical Update to Correct a PC to Printer Communication Issue http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=oj-67880-1&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&lang=en&os=2100&product=3204785 2)Critical Update to Enhance Reliability of Network and USB Connectivity and Improve System Responsiveness While Printing&quot;.
Nobody knows about this until you actually get a hold of the tech.
If you go to the page where my printer is at there are two alerts and none of them are those two.
So problem solved.
I am a little mad because HP has this real intrusive program that automatically installs in your computer that suppose to tell you when the products you are using has a update but all it seems to do is pop up to tell me I need to buy HP Products and that the printer was offline.
