1.1.1	my brother got a new computer for christmass being as im the only one who knows what shes doing I had to pick out the parts.	St
1.1.2	problem is- newegg was out of stock of abits is7 mobos so I bought it through amazon (i know.. i know..) arrived just in time but in pieces- broken abit box, missing cables etc.	St
1.1.3	installed it just for ***** and giggles and it wouldnt read a power supply- tried 3 different psus none worked- figured out it was a faulty connection on the pin on the mobo so sent the sucker back problem now is i cant find a mobo for this computer apparently the abits AI7 and IS7 dont exist anymore as noone has them in stock I cant use the IS7-E2 b/c it doesnt hold enough ram and theres no firewire i found the asus p4p800 deluxe but those are notorious for the southbridge going puff if you use anything besides the usb ports on the back so i figured id ask here unfortunately switching socket type isnt an option as the cpu is already bought (Pentium 4 3.0E Prescott 800MHz FSB 1MB L2 Cache Socket 478 Processor) the only thing missing is the bloody mobo so what do you guys think?	St

1.4.1	hey Ed thanks for the direction unfortunately pcprogress has an abismal rating on resellerratings and buyer's edge isnt even on there have you done business with any of these two companies??	St
1.4.2	I'm reluctant to buy anything from a new place if I haven't heard anything good about them you know.	St
1.4.3	thanks for all the help, at least it means they are still out there.	Polite
1.5.1	searched using Pricewatch??	St
1.5.2	?	Ques
1.6.1	Have bought small items from one of those listed with the ABIT.	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	Tough to find a more reliable supplier than newegg.	St
1.9.1	thats the IS7-E2 it has a max of 2G of Ram (instead of 4) and no firewire ports im just gonna break down today and either buy the is7-E2 and then hell just have to live w/ 2g of ram and ill buy him a seperate firewire port or buy the asus p4p800 deluxe board which do u guys think is better?	St
1.9.2	?	Ques
1.10.1	look for a mobo with such.	St
1.10.2	Can't you find one??	St
1.10.3	I'm only replying because you asked.	St
1.10.4	For myself, if looking for a mobo for a specific CPU, I would go to tomshardware and anandtech sites and look at their writeups.	St
1.10.5	I liked Abit mobos because their manuals are written a little better than most others.	St
1.10.6	Prefer Gigabyte mobos but more expensive, and terrible to try to communicate via their support.	St
1.10.7	For an Intel CPU, I would prefer to get a non Intel mobo but one with the Intel chipset.	St
1.10.8	Not sure that there is one with all the features that you want.	St
1.10.9	Intel mobos give no extras, but their chipsets virtually assure compatibility.	St
