if so, the obvious answer is to return them under warranty rather than risk losing it.
if you bought them &quot;as is&quot;, the distortion could be a blown speaker (loose coil), bad volume control potentiometer or something as simple as loose hardware inside.
somethings you can find and fix this.
replacing the satellites is going to mean cutting and splicing some wire and dealing with the volume controls for both the satellites and the sub.
you'd have to fabricate some method of doing this.
i seriously doubt that you'll get better sound from the old jbls than from a good working klipsch outfit.
as for the sub woofer volume setting, i run the dial no higher than 9 to 10 oclock or bass tends to get muddy.
most all of these systems will do this.
the extra power generated by its amplifier was never intended to allow you max out the volume controls.
it's there for damping and such to improve the accuracy of the speaker by controlling its travel.
i really like my klipsch speakers and hope you get your problem resolved.
