<s> There always appear occasions in which we could not make right choices. </s>
<s> That's why need friends who accompany us and give us sincere suggestions on what to do. </s>
<s> So that is why I love the invention of &quot;forum&quot;. </s>
<s> These days I have been considering to change a new notebook. </s>
<s> Before this, I bought the next product and several bare Samsung SATA drives, preparing to deal with all data in my old Toshiba notebook. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/products/dp/B00EHDTQQ0 I am not so skilled in handling this process. </s>
<s> I am worried that this gadget would come across problems resulting to data loss in the transferring. </s>
<s> Is it reasonable for my worry? </s>
<s> Or do you have any experience like this? </s>
<s> which factors to pay attention on ? </s>
<s> I tried your link it remains blank to me. </s>
<s> In other words, it didn't work. </s>
<s> If you plan to xfer data from one source to another that's been a common practice. </s>
<s> I don't a problem here provided you follow any instructions given or supplied to you. </s>
<s> if the posts required for such a device are available then agin it should work. </s>
<s> I leave it at that. </s>

<s> I always do a full system backup to an external hard drive. </s>
<s> Then I know I've got everything from my old PC and can selectively restore whatever I want. </s>
<s> I do export my email & contacts separately only because it's easier that way. </s>
<s> In the past I've used Norton Ghost 15, but that's no longer on the market so I've switched to Easeus Todo Backup. </s>
<s> Some people like Acronis True Image, but I've had a lot of problems with it, so I avoid it. </s>
<s> An alternative is WET, Windows Easy Transfer, which a lot of people like. </s>
<s> It's slow, and it's all or nothing with no options, which is why I don't like it. </s>
<s> Like Willy, I got a blank screen when I clicked on your link. </s>
<s> ` Good luck. </s>
<s> Sorry, it is very nice of you to remind the blank link. </s>
<s> i searched and post it here again. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EHDTQQ0 I would rather to know the difference between the so-called &quot;docking station&quot; and hard drive enclosures. </s>
<s> Which one is easier to operate? </s>
<s> Move your mouse over that link and it looks like you have turned on the forum visual editor on and tried to get fancy. </s>
<s> Try just the link without fancy? </s>

<s> Both interfaces of my laptop are USB 2.0. </s>
<s> I am not sure if I got the wrong information. </s>
<s> Most of the higher- edition USB 3.0 devices support backward with USB 2.0? </s>
<s> Is this one with the function or performance? </s>
<s> I've bumped into USB 3.0 not working on USB 2.0 ports a few times. </s>
<s> yes, it was supposed to work but didn't. </s>
<s> I'm not writing this won't work, but there's a chance. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've also heard about the possible situation. </s>
<s> My friend also reminded me that the speed may reduce into USB 2.0 speed when it works on USB 2.0 devices. </s>
<s> However , it still sounds great and attractive to me if it supports both. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Excluding that issue, the actual use of the docking station seems practical. </s>
<s> The ease of use vs. that of ext. </s>
<s> USB case becomes apparent, however either will work once you understand the limits of each. </s>
<s> Though, I assume that the &quot;docking station&quot; is more open to use on as needed basis and/or immediate one. </s>
<s> As for USB 2 and 3, then you assume the risk that it may not work on that basis alone. </s>
<s> This is a very strong roadblock in Dell PC and maybe others. </s>
