I will be using it to do backups on my 5 year old computer. Right now I'm looking at a: Seagate Freeagent go 120gb http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FreeAgent-External-Drive-ST901203FGA1E1-RK/dp/B000ND93ES and a simpletech signature mini 160gb http://www.amazon.com/SimpleTech-Signature-FS-U25-160BB-Blueberry/dp/B0012RCKOE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1217181517&sr=1-1 I need a good quality hard drive with good backup software. I don't want something thats going to crash next year. Any tips are appreciated

Keep reading these forums and you find that it's not a backup but a fast copy since there is no backup copy somewhere else plus the drive has no write protection feature. Most of the losses appear to be bad luck (dropped the drive) to malware (which is where that write protection matters.) I'd think it over how to get a real backup system going. Bob

Sorry but as it stands you'll find detractors for all the models on the markets since all have owners that suffered loss. This is why you must have a disaster plan. For what's on the shelves at the stores today, I see Ford, Chevy...
