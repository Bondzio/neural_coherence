1.1.1	Hello Ive done something really stupid .	St
1.1.2	I sent my computer off for repair ( Apple Powerbook G4 ) but as it was not going to be ready before I left on my travels I asked the repair company to send me my hard drive ( 60GB ) .	St
1.1.3	I put the hard drive in a caddy and connected it to my friends Mac ( heres the stupid bit ) I put an AC power source and not DC as it said on the caddy and now my friends ( ex ) USB port dosnt work nor does my hard drive .	St
1.1.4	I have tried it in a new caddy but it still does not work .	St
1.1.5	Does anybody have any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.6	Cheers Lee	St
1.2.1	Data recovery houses .	St
1.2.2	Try drivesavers.com and ontrack.com Bob	St
1.3.1	Just as a matter of interest , who makes the & quot ; caddy & quot ; that takes a Laptop HD and makes it connect to a USB port ?	Ques
1.3.2	Sounds like a piece of kit that could come in handy .	St
1.3.3	I use an adapter to connect laptop drives to an IDE cable and take power from the computers power supply or from an external drive enclosure .	St
1.3.4	My other question is how do you put AC into a device that only needs DC ?	Ques
1.3.5	Sounds like a design flaw .	St
1.3.6	On another note , was the HD working before you sent the machine away and does the drive only fit into the caddy , one way .	St
1.3.7	How do you determine which pins carry the DC voltage for the drive ?	Ques
1.3.8	P	St
1.4.1	When you installed the hard drive mechanism in the drive case , you would have seen the electronics on one side of the drive .	St
1.4.2	One item you did not see was the motor that drives the spindle that spins the platters ( at 7200 rpm ) that hold the data .	St
1.4.3	Also not visible to you are the armature mechanisms that hold the drive heads that move across the platters that read and write the data .	St
1.4.4	If the external circuit board blew out , that might be easy for a drive repair/data recovery company to fix .	St
1.4.5	Chances are pretty good that in addition to blowing out that circuit board , the spindle motor and the armature mechanisms were impacted by the surge in AC power .	St
1.4.6	There is a slight chance that the heads ( being held by the armatures ) went bananas and could have scruffed the platter surfaces .	St
1.4.7	If only external stuff was impacted , that is one thing - but if anything internal was impacted , the only way to get to the data is to actually open the drive - in a special & quot ; clean room & quot ; and with special tools read the platters sector by sector and recover whatever may be recoverable .	St
1.4.8	I presume you had no data back ups ... Bummer .	St
1.4.9	Good luck .	Polite
