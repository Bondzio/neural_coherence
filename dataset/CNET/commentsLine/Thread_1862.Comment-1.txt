helo, ok i currently have a modem that goes to a router with 2 phone jacks for my vonage phone service and lan 1 out also goes into computer.
according to its setup disk my netgear wireless router wants to be the first router.
i am afraid this will gum up my vonage signal.
is it ok to have the wireless router first?
anyone with vonage and a wireless router out there who can advise?
thanks - fj
