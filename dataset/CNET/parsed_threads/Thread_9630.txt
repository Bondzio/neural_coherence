<s> Hi, I have just had broadband installed using a cable modem (motorola sb5100). </s>
<s> It connects to my network card. </s>
<s> I presume that by fitting another network card I can then use this to connect to my wifes computer network card so that she can also use the internet. </s>
<s> Basically am I correct in saying this. </s>
<s> I run WinXPpro and my wife Win98 </s>
<s> http://broadband.motorola.com/consumers/products/sb5100/ doesn't note it has a router, so you'll need a router too. </s>

<s> Since your wife's pc has a network card buy a router. </s>
<s> Plug the broadband into the router then both pc's into the router then both pc's can use the connetion equaly. </s>
<s> You will have to setup the router for you broadband account but in the end you will have a much better setup. </s>
