The sharing works almost as if you have the entire connection if you are getting email, loading a web site or such.
You can pile 100 users on a router and it works super since no one is demanding long demands on the connection.
Your email is fetched and that's over.
The Web page loads and it's over.
It's sharing at its best.
However if someone starts downloading something big then you see the effect.
