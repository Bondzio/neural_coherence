also, if i turn both the tv and mac off.
then turn them both back on, the mac boot screen shows on the tv until the apple boot screen (white with an apple on it) disappears.
then it goes black and i get the &quot;invalid format&quot; error from the tv.
must be the point in boot when the mac changes resolution settings?
