Reboot, and it's back. If I have only two drives, the primary drive is OK, and the other drive 'disappears'! Why am I 'losing' a hard drive from the system, 'sometimes'?

Reboot returns system. Power supply should not be considered a culprit, as it works with one or two removable drives. Does anyone have any idea about how this may happen?? John

I won't go into details but it is all about age, electrical noise increases due to capacitor aging and more. Here's the problem. The owner will likely tell you &quot;It worked before&quot; or &quot;It's worked for years.&quot; But don't let that bother you because that's the normal response to this and other age related issues. Press on with updating 40 conductor cables to 80 conductor as well as outright moves to a bigger single drive. Those that must have removeables usually are trouble at the shop counter. Be sure to put on your best smile and help them save their files first and then let them figure it out that such may not be a supportable configuration. Help them toss the drive trays and connect it up directly. The moment the owner declares it can't be something, then the likelyhood increased it is that! Hope this helps, Bob

Get your files out before the dropout wipes out the file system. And removable drives are always trouble. Just look in the storage forum for proof. Bob
