The FX will definatly be better for high-end gaming that is single threaded, however, the dual core CPU's like the X2 will not be as fast for gaming due to lower clock speeds and inablility to overclock as well. The X2 would be great for multitasking, such as photo/video editting, 3d rendering, encoding music/videos things like that... The FX would be great for single threaded applications such as video games.
