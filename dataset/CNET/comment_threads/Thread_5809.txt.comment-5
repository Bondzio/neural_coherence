I don't have to have homepage to stream live video, right?
Can I setup the stream in shared folder so I can see the streamed video?
I'm planning to do this project this thursday, so I need all the help I could get.
Thanks in advance.
I understand Bob, what you're trying to say.
Forgive my stubornness in this.
I like to see through this whether I can do this or not.
