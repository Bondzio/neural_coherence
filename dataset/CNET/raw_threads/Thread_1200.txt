I've run into problems with dual boot machines not recognizing the second hard drive. Anyone know why this would happen? There isn't a seperate bios configuration per operating system is there?

It's a nutty thing that you have to deal with. Even more nutty when you deal with Windows versions prior to 2000. Not busted, just coded that way. Bob

I currently have Windows 2000 server. Haven't gotten around to upgrading that since I don't upgrade unless I am forced to upgrade. I built the PC myself. I'll need to post the specs when I get home since I don't know off the top of my head.
