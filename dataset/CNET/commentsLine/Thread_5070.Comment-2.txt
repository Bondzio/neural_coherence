but rather a firewall and network configuration.. just a thought, can you filter the internet access using a mac address (from the router)... --do not include that particular machine mac address-- this way .. networking still available for everyone, and internet access only available for registered mac address.. i might be wrong though... but i know someone that use a linux based gateway server.. where you can configured many things with the ultility called webmin(?)
