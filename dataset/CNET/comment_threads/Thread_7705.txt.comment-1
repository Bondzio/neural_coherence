I am thinking about picking one up but wanted to hear some thoughts about the model and the 'N' spec (or lack thereof) in general.
I am currently running a Netgear GS gigabit switch with a POS Linksys single port router.
This would be my first wireless experience (and would provide extra gigabit ports).
I have a work laptop with G and any laptop in my future would definitly have N.
