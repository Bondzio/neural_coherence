<s> I have an Epson WorkForce 600, which I like very much, but I suddenly have a problem. </s>
<s> I can't print anything off of the Internet. </s>
<s> I can print normal email and documents that I've saved. </s>
<s> I tried to print airline confirmation that came with my email message, and all I got was blank pages that rolled through the printer. </s>
<s> I just attempted to print some movie theater info off the Internet, and the same thing happened. </s>
<s> I can't find any information in my Epson booklet about this kind of problem. </s>
<s> I just downloaded a new driver, but that didn't help. </s>
<s> Can someone please help me? </s>
<s> Turns out the problem isn't my printer, it's my browser. </s>
<s> Printer works fine with Internet Explorer but not with Firefox. </s>
<s> Is there a forum for browsers? </s>
<s> Check the Firefox setting and enable/disable what maybe interfering. </s>
<s> You can also look into any &quot;add-ons&quot; if you use them as well. </s>
<s> If definitely the browser, then delete it and reload it again, but save your favorites for later return. </s>
<s> If you like try a &quot;restore point&quot; to to a date before the problem. </s>
<s> If that works and later it doesn't, then some update maybe at work here. </s>
<s> I exclude any system issues. </s>
<s> FYI- I have Firefox and it works printing whatever I deem necessary. </s>
<s> This is going to be one of those problems that someone reports on and us Firefox users point to a fix or you have something unique to you. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thank you, Willy. </s>
<s> It's definitely the browser, so I think I'll uninstall it and try again. </s>
<s> After reading all the comments everywhere on the net, uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling, nothing worked. </s>
<s> (Like you, it worked on IE). </s>
<s> Apparently the cause was a MS update. </s>
<s> I just right-clicked the printer in the printers and devices folder and removed the printer (with the printer off). </s>
<s> Then I turned the printer on. </s>
<s> The drivers were automatically installed and voila! </s>
<s> Everything worked. </s>
