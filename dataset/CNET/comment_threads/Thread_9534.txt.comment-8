PCMCIA card = PC Card While ''PCMCIA'' is really the name of the standards organization that governs such card technology, many manufacturers and retailers use that name instead of the more proper ''PC-Card.''
As for for PC Card vs USB wireless adapter?
I see it as more of a convenience issue.
Using a PC card in a notebook frees the USB 2.0 ports for other uses; however, a USB 2.0 adapter can later be used on a desktop if the need arises.
I have used both kinds.
These days, I just get the inexpensive wireless-g USB 2.0 adapter and have no regrets.
