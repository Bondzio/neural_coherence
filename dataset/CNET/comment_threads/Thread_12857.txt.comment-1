I am trying to an Epson WF 545 to connect to a wireless network.
I get an error message when it fails to connect to a networked iMac.
The message says, &quot;Entered security key/password does not match the one set for your router/access point.&quot; Several weeks ago, I had to reset my wireless network password/security key.
That reset worked for our 3 PCs and 2 Macs including this iMac...the one that now doesn't connect to the wireless printer or maybe vice versa.
I don't know what's going on...why the iMac can't connect to the Epson (or vice versa), but the iMac does connect to the wireless network, and in order to do that, it makes use of the new network password / security key that I just put in the Epson to set it up in the network.
Can you tell me if the wireless router somehow has a password / security key that I did not change when I changed the wireless network security key?
The new network password/security key that I entered in the Epson is correct.
No doubt of that.
