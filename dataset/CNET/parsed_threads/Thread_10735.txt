<s> Well, I just had an interesting experience this evening. </s>
<s> So my friend had been itching for a graphics card for his 4 year old Dell (bad idea). </s>
<s> The first he bought was BFG FX5500 OC for AGP, didn't care for it for some reason. </s>
<s> Then a few days later he buys an ATI X1300 Pro 256MB for AGP for $180. </s>
<s> Now I knew that it would be trouble, his 250watt powersupply will not handle it. </s>
<s> And I was right, it didnt work. </s>
<s> So then he tried to buy a new power supply after I told him that the connection is proprietary and he would have to buy it online. </s>
<s> The Antec didn't fit, big surprise. </s>
<s> So he goes to return the card at Bestbuy and they wouldn't take it because the serial numbers didnt match on the box. </s>
<s> But somehow I ended up with the card. </s>
<s> I would give him my FX5700LE and pay the difference which would only be $80. </s>
<s> Sounded like a deal. </s>
<s> My gut feeling said it wouldn't work because I have a cheap OEM Emachine psu that was never making 300watts. </s>
<s> But I tried it anyway. </s>
<s> I popped it in, hooked up the molex connecter to the psu(I should have turned around there). </s>
<s> Well, the machine didn't start up. </s>
<s> Big surprise. </s>
<s> Now, I wasn't about to go out and buy a $60 psu at work so I decided to disconnect 1 of my drives and the useless dial-up modem from my pc. </s>
<s> And it actually booted up. </s>
<s> But it wasn't very stable. </s>
<s> Quite ugly. </s>
<s> So, I disconnected everything and put back in my original card. </s>
<s> So now I'm wasting my time installing drivers and putting my PC back to the way it was before all this. </s>
<s> All in the name for a card that underperforms a 6600! </s>
<s> It will never happen again. </s>
<s> Lessons learned: 1.Upgrade ur PSU when buying a $100+ card 2.Don't try upgrading your 4-year old Dell 3.Make sure you are wayyy over the minimum requirements for a graphics card 4.Buy components online so you don't get ripped off. </s>
<s> 5.Avoid temptation. </s>
<s> It will only back to where you started. </s>
<s> sells power supplies specifically for Dell's as a separate line. </s>
<s> 1-Drive the user crazy. </s>
<s> 2-Empty the user's wallet. </s>
<s> It seems like both machines have met specs. </s>
<s> Trying to upgrade a machine can open a can of worms. </s>
<s> But their GREAT TOYS. </s>
