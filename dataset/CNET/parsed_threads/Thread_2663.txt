<s> I'm a photographer and I'm trying to get raw images (.CR2) from my PC to another person's Mac. </s>
<s> I think I have tried jpgs and they didn't work either so the file extension should be irrelevant but there you go just in case. </s>
<s> It's a couple of weddings so they are huge files. </s>
<s> Here's what I've tried: *I put each folder on my external hard drive, 14G worth. </s>
<s> When I am done I see that the images transferred fine and my hard drive is 14G fuller now. </s>
<s> I hand that over to the Mac person and he says the folders are empty when trying to view from his computer. </s>
<s> *Then I got his external hard drive and ended up with the exact same result. </s>
<s> His drive was 14G fuller and everything. </s>
<s> * I have burned discs for him and they come up empty as well What do I need to do? </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> I bet the Apple user is a bit new at this. </s>
<s> If the files do not show its possible they can't or don't know how to add NTFS support to their machine. </s>
<s> Try another Apple owner. </s>

<s> why didn't I think of that? </s>
<s> Seriously, if it's on their end and I think it is, what do they need to do? </s>
<s> Please people I need help with this issue, not sarcastic remarks. </s>
<s> Have them install NTFS support or have them format the drive on their machine and use a Linux boot CD to copy files to their Apple formatted drive. </s>
<s> We discuss the Linux boot CD at the top of the forum. </s>
<s> It is not sarcastic but stating that you might have to upgrade that person. </s>
