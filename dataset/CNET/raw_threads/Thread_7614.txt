It has a Asus mainboard and as I say the main drive shows as removable hardware. It works fine I'm just worried I accidentally hit remove device! Would I then be in loads of trouble trying to start my PC.Also I would like to know why it shows like this. Many Thanks J J

Look around for any checkbox with the word &quot;removeable&quot; for that drive. Bob PS. Not an issue so far, just annoying to some.

(it can be fooled into doing so, but then i would question the legality of the install. you typically have to install it onto a fixed drive then clone that onto a removeable drive.)

This is a new area and predates XP so XP could label it as removable. This is not a registry error. It's an option. Bob

But if as you say a copy has been copied from one drive to another it's still a hard drive and not removable. Please forgive me if I'm sounding stupid to you but I am in the land of fog,mud and whats that burning smell at the moment, but many thanks for your responses. J J

That here we have windows installed and the boot drive is marked removable as it's in the tray. I've seen this often with XP, SATA connected drives and Windows installs just fine. Vista seems to understand SATA much better and will not mark the boot drive as removable. After a few hundred installs you just gotta wonder what is immutable and what is not. Bob
