i would like up upgrade my computer by replacing the motherboard, cpu, ram and power supply, everything else will stay the same.
i am ruuning windows vista home premium.
my question is will i have to re-load windows vista?
i upgraded to vista from xp and only have the upgrade dvd and not the full version.
the price for the hardware is not an issue, but if i have to pay $250 for the full version of vista that then becomes a problem thanks wayne
