1.1.1	I have problem with my Dell Inspiron 9200 Laptop.I couldn't start it and when I tried harder, pressing the power key a bit longer it started,but after few seconds I saw a smock comming from behind.I tried to start it with and without battery - no result.When I took it for repair they said me the problem most probably was in the moherboard (it is gone and it is no use to do something, too costly).
