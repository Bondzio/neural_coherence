You wrote you got it to work wired then wrote you would go dark.
This didn't make any sense to me as it worked wired and we have Virtual Router for our Windows PCs and Apple has it's own way of doing that.
We also have a dozen settings on WiFi routers to try but I can't do that on a forum.
I will offer the usual that works for most and not get into the other area (that's for support folk to do.)
This is only a discussion forum and I'll share or discuss this but in no way am support.
