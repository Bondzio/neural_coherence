<s> Hi everyone, it's me again with another question, jeje I have a computer with IDE socket, but I bought a DVD-R with E-IDE interfase(I discovered after I bought it) My question is: This DVD-R will work in my computer? </s>
<s> PS: I saw a picture of a E-IDE socket and has exactly the same amount of pins. </s>
<s> but I'm not sure. </s>
<s> compatible. </s>
<s> The first E is for &quot;Enhanced&quot;. </s>
<s> Most drives have been EIDE for many years now. </s>
<s> One possiblity that I ran into in 3 mobo's is that they insisted that the DVD drive be a Slave on either bus. </s>
<s> They would not let it work as a Master, I know not why, but the mobo FAQs clearly said that. </s>
