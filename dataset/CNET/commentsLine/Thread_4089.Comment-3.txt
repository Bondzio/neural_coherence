steven, thanks for the feedback.
i have been absent because i had to take the computer into a local repair.
the long story is in another thread i started about repartitioning.
anyway, my internal drive works intermitently and i am looking to replace it.
this computer, the gateway solo 1450 laptop, does not boot from a usb connected device.
