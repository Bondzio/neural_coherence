i just purchased an hp a1410a multimedia computer.
i am trying to connect my hard drive from my old emachines computer but the new computer does not have a wide ribbon ide cable connected to the hard drive, so i have no idea now what to do.
i have installed second hard drives before on older computers but they have always had the wide ribbon ide.
the only ide wide ribbon goes to the dvd/cd.
the new computer has a narrow red data connection (at least that is what it looks like) and the power cable.
is there any way to connect my old drive at least temporarily to move my data?
any advise?
thanks for your help.
