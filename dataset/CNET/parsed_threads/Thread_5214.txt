<s> First off, im a complete rookie to graphics card, so pardon if something is not clear. </s>
<s> My system is Intel PIV(3.06 GHZ) 1024 MB RAM and Intel 865G graphics chipset with 96 MB RAM. </s>
<s> These are a few issues with this card: When I installed Prince of Persia warrior within, it said my card didn't support Pixel Shader 1.1, I still ran it and things were fine. </s>
<s> From time to time, I have seen games complaining. </s>
<s> Besides, I don't think 96 MB is considered good for a hobbyist gamer. </s>
<s> (I may be wrong though.) </s>
<s> What is the status of this card in today's world? </s>
<s> It has an AGI 8X slot. </s>
<s> Most games list their requirements in terms of Nvidia this or that or ATI Radeon this or that. </s>
<s> Can I fix a non-Intel card in that AGI slot? </s>
<s> (Of course I'll get a professional to install it.) </s>
<s> Recently Titan Quest has refused to run my system, and it really boils my blood.. What is the best solution for my problems? </s>
<s> I want an AGP card that is not too highly priced and has a good value for money. </s>
<s> By the way, I remember having read somewhere that it is possible to disable this Intel on-board card. </s>
<s> Can it be done? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot in advance. </s>
<s> Plz help me out. </s>
<s> The Intel 865G is a motherboard chipset, with the ''G'' signifying that it has built-in (integrated) video circuitry. </s>
<s> That is not a dedicated video card. </s>
<s> What is your computer manufacturer and model name? </s>
<s> If a home build, what is the motherboard model name? </s>
<s> Download and run CPU-Z to confirm your motherboard (system board) model number. </s>
<s> Look at the back of your computer and tell us about your power supply unit (PSU). </s>
<s> What is its maximum Wattage rating? </s>
<s> What is the manufacturer and model number? </s>
<s> You will want to have have a video card with an ATI or nVidia graphics processing unit (GPU). </s>
<s> Disabling the integrated video is one step in the process of installing the new dedicated video card. </s>
<s> Just about any dedicated video card will improve your system's performance. </s>
<s> The better gaming video cards are little more expensive and usually start at about USD$100. </s>
<s> Ok, as per CPU-Z, Model : P4i65GV Chipset: i865P/PE/G/i848P (whatever that means) It's a home build. </s>
<s> Power Supply: Quantum Hi-Tech. </s>
<s> Model No. </s>
<s> PIV-300T It doesn't list any wattage, but gives a chart of volatge and current outputs. </s>
<s> Does that help? </s>
<s> And oh, I have two hard drives. </s>
<s> By the way, aren't consoles a better solution to the ever increasing &quot;upgrade&quot; demand of computers? </s>
<s> here's a decent agp card for your system: 7600gs, agp, 256mb http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814127219 it will need a larger power supply: antec 450w ps http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Antec-Power-Supply-SP450/sem/rpsm/oid/143267/catOid/-13011/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do as for consoles vs. &quot;upgrade&quot; demand of pcs... if you get a pc intended for gaming, it will serve you well for a couple of years. </s>
<s> integrated graphics have never really been suitable for gaming so a pc like yours needed an &quot;upgrade&quot; for gaming when it was new. </s>
