thanks for the information.
i think i have a much better grasp on things, but am still not quite where i need to be to be able to make all my decisions for my new build.
1) i am planning on running ddr2 1000 memory, and i am also planning to overclock, so i guess it depends on what i end up running them at with the memory dividers.
from your response i take it my choices are i can run it faster, but pretty much guarantee only being able to use two sticks to avoid a slowdown of the memory, unless i can convince it to maintain its speed with higher voltages (i'm personally not a big fan of overvolting memory very much), or i can run it slower and shouldn't have a problem with 4 sticks.
so i guess it will come down to whether i want the little extra speed or more capacity.
i'll probably just stick with a 2x2 setup, should be more than enough.
also, i was under the impression ddr2 rarely performs at 1t at 800 and above.
2) all i needed to know.
i only need 3, so knowing that at least 4 will be locked works for me i thought the northbridge controlled the sata ports, might be why i couldn't find much info on it.
makes a lot more sense that the southbridge would control it, not really sure why i thought that... 4) so it sounds like i was accurate in my assumption then, basically just a guaranteed overclocking capability for the motherboard.
pretty much what i do for memory: buy cheap memory that doesn't oc well but is rated at a faster speed and costs half as much as the slower stuff that ocs better to get you to the same speed.
