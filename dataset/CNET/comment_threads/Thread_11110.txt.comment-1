I went out and tried to do todays &quot;weekend project&quot; except i had a problem, when I pulled out the older cooling unit, the processor came out as well, apparently it is stuck to it.
considering the cost of getting a new processor i'm not about to force it off.
What should I do?
btw: the socket is a P4 478.
