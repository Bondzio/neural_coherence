Your rationale behind Apple is sound, and I hadn't really thought of it.
I have been investigating, and most people around here who have Kindles read books, period.
I don't think the camera is TOO big a deal but maybe it is.
I did find one woman who uses a Kindle FIre for all sorts of things, which means that if I do a presentation I should invite her to join me.
So thanks, for understanding exactly what I was looking for.
A few years back everyone here was saying everyone (even grandma) should get Linux computers.
I don't hear that often any more.
The ability to understand that what YOU may want or enjoy isn't necessarily what EVERYONE should get perhaps come with maturity and experience.
Thanks again!
