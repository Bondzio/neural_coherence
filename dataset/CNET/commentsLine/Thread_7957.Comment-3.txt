the only firewall i am using is the one with xp pro.
the high speed modem connects to my p4 via usb.
the p4 connects to the hub via ethernet as does the p2.
i used xp pro to set up the home network.
i can access messenger on the p4, no problem, but when i sign in on the p2 it just sits there.
i have tried to connect on the p2 after turning off the xp firewall (on the p4) but that doesn't work either.
the hub doesn't have a firewall.
yahoo messenger works fine on the p2 & p4.
