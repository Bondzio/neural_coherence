if you're not having problems but just want to zap the icon, right click on a blank space to the right of the time/ date etc at bottom right corner and select properties, make sure 'hide inactive icons' is ticked.
&gt; customize &gt; drop-down box next to icon/s you want to zap and choose 'always hide'&gt; ok &gt; apply &gt; ok.
