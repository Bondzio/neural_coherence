much has been talked about amd athlon64 and intel pentium 4 series.
when it comes to gaming or extreme graphics, people say go amd but when it comes to encoding or digital media they say go intel's way.
this is a common concept now embedded in our minds but is all that true.
i mean most of us, when we want to purchase a new pc want an all rounder pc capable doing all that stuff.
someone please help the majority of ill-informed people.
thanks!
