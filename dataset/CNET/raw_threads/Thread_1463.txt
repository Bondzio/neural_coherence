My 2003 pavilion ze5300 has an incredibly annoying habit of typing ' r ' on its own and does not allow me to type an 'r' at will. All r's must be deleted, copied and pasted in. Has a new hard drive, has been cleaned with air cans and has no known viruses. Can an alliterative keypad bypass this issue? Any advice how I can stop the ' r ' key madness?

It's not surprising to find some issue with an older laptop won't crop-up. The whole kybd. can be replaced, if you're capable. I suppled a link in case you want to review that and many others once you google. You can try a USB kybd. and see if allowed as an ext. kybd. access or secondary human interface device for possible quick fix. http://fixcorner.blogspot.com/2009/05/hp-pavilion-ze5300-specs-repair-fault.html tada -----Willy
