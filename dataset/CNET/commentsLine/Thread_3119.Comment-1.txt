hello - i'm thinking of buying the samsung 244t widescreen lcd for my pc.
i'm also buying a new pc and want to make sure everything's compatible.
what will i need as far as a video card?
i know that some pc games are compatible with 16:9 ratio, but what about the ones that aren't?
will they be stretched out or just normal size (4:3) on the screen - with black bars on the left and right of the screen?
any help is much appreciated?
thanks tim
