A slot expander can't add this needed signal. Similar issues for PCI Express. As to sata, you might look at adding drives on USB 2.0. Not as fast but pretty fast. Bob

I KNOW THEY WORK, EXIST ETC, b/c i've used both at once. I dont know how, believe me I thought a/b exactly what you said, then i put an ethernet card and a firewire card in the slots and used them simultaneously. so i KNOW they work...just dont know how or where to get one.

This is not something in the basic Intel design. I can see where people may think it's a standard. As to getting the part, you just revealed where. Dell. Call and order it. Will it work? Bob
