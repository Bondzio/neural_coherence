isp offers a dedicated line for $2300 for the week, vs the shared line for $1200 and will allow a router on the dedicated line, but still require $150 &quot;machine charge&quot; per machine using the broadband after the first two.
can you believe the nerve!
because their tone seems like they might well do onsite inspection, i'm going with the dedicated and just not paying for the additional machines.
no way for them to augue that the other machines are 'using' the broadband.
i'll just say they're not.
crooks.
would be one thing if they just said they charge for the ips to make money, but to charge double for the dedicated so i can use a router then try to bleed me for $150 per machine is criminal.
should run a free hotspot and screw them out of some of their wifi income in the convention center as well.
thanks again.
