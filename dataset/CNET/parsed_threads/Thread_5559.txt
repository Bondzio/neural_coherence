<s> My computer has a AMD Athlon processor with 802 MHZ and 256 mb ram, running Windows Me. </s>
<s> The power supply is from Skyhawk, but I'm not sure what wattage it is. </s>
<s> First the computer started being slow to shut down, then it would start turning itself on by itself. </s>
<s> One day it kept turning on and my husband kept shutting it down. </s>
<s> When I got home, it wouldn't turn on, so I checked all connections, dusted it out and then hooked it back up and turned it on. </s>
<s> Smoke came out of the power supply vents, so shut it back down. </s>
<s> I am sure it's the power supply, but don't know where to find the wattage, and what size power supply to replace it with. </s>
<s> hopefully this is enough info. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help </s>
<s> http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1051384504905&skuId=4683293&type=product Get at least a 350 W. </s>
<s> Would a power supply with a dual fan be better to use?I really don't want this to happen again.Needing to know how large a power supply is safe for this computer. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Your basic PC can use any oversized power supply since it will only draw the power it needs. </s>
<s> Supersizing the supply to 450 Watts is a 20 dollar exercise and has no downside. </s>
<s> compgeeks.com has these all the time, so shop around. </s>
<s> Dual fans are nice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You probably had a 250W or 300W p/s unit. </s>
<s> the good news is a larger p/s will fit, so a 350W or larger of the same pysical type will work even if it isn't the exact same wattage as you're old one. </s>
<s> Check this website for some info, then shop: http://www.sparklepower.com or any similar p/s maker... good luck ----Willy </s>
