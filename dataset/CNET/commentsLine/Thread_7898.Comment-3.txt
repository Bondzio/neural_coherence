such hardware rendering were really just dedicated cpu(s) and some hardware on a board so it's speed depended on how many dollars you pumped into it.
now we have a simple financial issue to solve.
since the real fast boards are over 1k why not go get that quad core intel cpu from gateway or hp that is hovering at the 1k mark?
