My preference is to use the smaller drive for the OS and applications.
80gigs will hold a ton of these.
Your 80gig shows quicker specs but I am not certain that is correct with a 2meg cache, however.
You do want your main drive to perform well.
The larger drives are well suited for storage and can be used as backups for other data.
I have mine done this way and use imaging software to backup my entire hard drive as a compressed image on larger secondary drives as part of my distaster recovery scheme.
In the end, however, your opinion and needs outweigh all outside advice.
Good luck with your project.
