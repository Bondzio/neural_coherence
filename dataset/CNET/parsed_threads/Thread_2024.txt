<s> Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone can help me. </s>
<s> I have a Linksys Wireless G Broadband Router, model No WRT54G. </s>
<s> The router's red Diag light stays always red. </s>
<s> I went into the Linksys technical support for help and followed the instructions on how to fix the problem on the page: http://linksys.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/linksys.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=175&p_created=1084205858&p_sid=t6pJvP8i&p_accessibility=0&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MyZwX3Byb2RzPTEsMjAsMzI2JnBfY2F0cz0mcF9wdj0zLjMyNiZwX2N2PSZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPWFuc3dlcnMuc2VhcmNoX25sJnBfc2NmX2xhbmc9MSZwX3BhZ2U9MSZwX3NlYXJjaF90ZXh0PWRpYWc*&p_li=&p_topview=1 I got as far as testing the communication between the Router and the network card. </s>
<s> It seems that the router established a connection but when I test the communication with ping 192.168.1.1 it say Request timed out... Could anyone please advise me on what to do? </s>
<s> Thank you, any help is greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> connected properly on the correct port? </s>
<s> Good day, Regarding w/ your concern sir mataharimata, if the red diag light lit-up and always stays red, it means that it may be have a software or hardware failure on the unit. </s>
<s> The only way to troubleshoot the device is just to reset it twice for 20-30secs. </s>
<s> after that try to ping the routers ip addr. </s>
<s> w/c is 192.168.1.1. </s>
<s> If it still getting a request time out pinging the rotuers ip addr. </s>
<s> try usign another pc to ping the router. </s>
<s> Once youve done all this troubleshooting steps and still unable to ping or get replys pinging the routers ip addr. </s>
<s> it only means that the router is deffective or theres already a hardware failure on it. </s>
<s> (I hope this may help you.) </s>
<s> Thanks and have a productive day ahead. </s>
<s> I've heard that sometimes the solid red Diag light is due to a weak or malfunctioning AC adaptor. </s>
<s> Make sure that the replacement has the same ratings and polarity. </s>
<s> For the WRT54g, DC output is +5.0V 2.0A, inside positive, outside negative. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Weve got it sorted out, please check: http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?p=116212#116212 Thanks for all the help </s>
