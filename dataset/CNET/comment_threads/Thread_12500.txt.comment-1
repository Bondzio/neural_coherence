Hi forum; I have a proposed system build from the following parts: OCZ StealthXStream 700W Gigabyte GA-MA785GMT-UD2H AMD Phenom II 955 2x 1GBDDR3 PC3-10600 1333MHz WD Caviar Blue 500GB SATAII XFX Radeon HD 4890 1GB LG W2230s-EFV Case is already there, a generic ATX box.
The budget is somewhat limited to 550 GBP, so I would welcome any comments on improvements to this...
Please, no fanboy rants, though.
TIA Andy
