1.2.1	a 9800gx2 will work with any motherboard with a pci-express x16 slot ( and your mobo definitely has at least one since it 's based on the x38 chipset ) .	St
1.2.2	the real question is will it fit in your case since they 're very long cards .	St
1.2.3	also , it 's easier to get help if you just post the mobo make/model rather than the & quot ; specification & quot ; .	St
1.3.1	The video ram is that 's your ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.2	That ram is n't part of the mtrbd .	St
1.3.3	itself it is for the video card .	St
1.3.4	That 's independent of the mtrbd .	St
1.3.5	ram if you think DDR3 vs. any DDR ?	Ques
1.3.6	on mtrbd..	St
1.3.7	If the video card you select is PCIe slot compatible then proceed .	St
1.3.8	The only other issue that *may* crop up is physical sizing as some video cards are too wide or the mtrbd .	St
1.3.9	has componets in the way of the video fully seating .	St
1.3.10	This also varies with the vendor 's make-up as well as they differ even with the same chipsets .	St
1.3.11	Only a true test of actually installing is up to you , decisioning ca n't always be made until done in the real world as this is where the specs may fail us .	St
