i have a 400gb seagate hard drive and i'm installing it into an external usb case, the vantec nexstar 3. when i first installed and turn it on it only showed up as 32gb in windows no matter how i set the jumper.
i contacted segate and was told to install it internally and use their diskwizard to reset the drive volume.
well...i finally managed to get it to format at 400gb and actually ended up installing windows xp on the drive at the same time.
i checked my computer and it shows at 400gb.
i then took the drive out of the pc and put it back in the external case and it still comes up as 32gb and windows says it's not formatted.
i'm pulling my hair out!
any idea what the issue could be?
thanks for any insight.
