many cases are designed or fall into the frt.
fans=in and rear fans=out(exhaust).
however, with the introduction of side fans, some are made to blow directly into the cpu to help cool it, yet others are venting it out.
i fall into the group that vent it.
in cases where the outside air just isn't as cool as it used to be, then blowing air in isn't going to help as it once did.
as the other poster offered get your hands on a buss/slot fan to help.
actually, reverse the side case fan rather than the cpu fan.
the cpu fan is suppose to draw hot air away from cpu and the side fan is interfering in this process.
all this is called &quot;airflow&quot; and thus secure cables/harness better and reduce obstructiosn to help it.
also, clean out the system case as well.
fyi- when things get hot here, i remove side cover and use a small 6in.
household(personal) fan, that's far better than any case fan to help cool the system down.
its quiet too.
