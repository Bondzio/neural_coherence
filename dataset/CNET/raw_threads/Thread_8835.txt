HELP ME PLEASE, my computer is filling up fast...

I've seen people reload the OS, fidget with a dead CDRW drive for months before they give up. My lesson is to swap early. Bob

4676	5	124254	1409698	1408339	Coryphaeus	9/8/05 6:38 PM	1.12620468E12	Just wondering. . .	if anyone has priced dual layer media lately? I had heart failure when I did. I can buy another drive for the price of four disks, or a hell'of'a large HD for a few more disks. Didn't want to get into the middle of this conversation, but DL-DVD disks are just too pricy for me. Then again you can still use single layer disk in a dual layer drive like I do. I bought the drive before I priced the disks. And they are slooooow to burn.

I reserve dual layer for the few instances its needed. -&gt; I'm found of a program called Alcohol 120% which can emulate a dual layer dvd media and drive so we can test burn and play a dual layer dvd without actually recording it onto real media. A real time and money saver. Bob

Most burners, whether they be CD or DVD or CD/DVD Combos, need to be set as master and any CD-ROM, or in your case, DVD-ROM drives set as slave. The fact that it worked awhile back means nothing in this case. When first installed, they can do that but very soon will stop operating properly. I am willing to bet that if you were to go inside your computer and switch them, both drives would work properly. When you turn on your computer, it will automatically make the changes in your setup. If you install your new burner in the same setup you have now, with it as slave, and it doesn't work, try the solution above.
