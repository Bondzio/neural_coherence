this afternoon i added a 1gb memory stick to my lapstop, to double what i had.
it recognized the change to 2gb, but then i got 5 blue screen errors and shut-downs in 2 hours.
never happened before.
before removing the new stick (yes, it's seated correctly), i decided to run the memory test that's on the ubuntu linux install disk.
it's been going for well over 3 hours now, and i have to go to bed sometime!
is this normal?
if it ever finishes, will it give a simple &quot;result&quot;, telling me for instance, that my new memory stick is bad?
i'd hate to shut it off now and have to re-start it again when i have all day!
