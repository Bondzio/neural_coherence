Before I installed it, I had Adobe Pro 6.0 installed (which turns docs into PDFs) and an HP Deskjet Now, after installing the A920, my Adobe print/make PDF function has disappeared and my HP Deskjet (both say &quot;no printers installed&quot; when try to use them) Seems the A920 has taken over/conflict?? Then when I try to uninstall and reinstall Adobe Pro it says &quot;Error 1920 Service Print Spooler (Spooler) failed to start. Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start system services&quot;. Which is ridiculous - I am the administrator of the computer/only account. I have never in twenty years had one device wreak such havoc on my system! Can anyone help? Can;'t find anything in the Dell knowledge base! Thanks PS Running Windows XP SP2
