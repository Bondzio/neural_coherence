1.1.1	How can I clean my plasma screen effectively without damaging it or my laptop?	St
1.1.2	Preferably without having to buy anything special.	St
1.2.1	Since I value my laptop screen, I purchased a few laptop screen wipes.	St
1.2.2	They have an antistatic feature so less dust builds up.	St
1.2.3	Well worth the 2 or 3 bucks.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Sound perfect, thanks for the info.	Polite
1.3.2	Adi	St
1.4.1	I have never seen or heard of a Plasma screen on a laptop, they normally use TFT or some equivalent.	St
1.4.2	I find that a soft damp cloth works just as well as anything else to clean one.	St
1.4.3	Never seen a static problem.	St
1.5.1	The screen surface and LCDs don't have such a big charge as CRT, but the laptop screen wipes are cheap and effective to keep &quot;fluffy&quot; from the screen surface... Bob	St
1.6.1	Sorry, you're right it is a TFT, I just always think they're plasma because of the ripple effect when you touch them.	St
1.6.2	The soft damp cloth worked like a dream, thanks.	St
1.6.3	And free as well I do have a cat Bob, but I don't usually have much trouble with static, only paws pressing random keys on my keyboard when I'm not watching.	St
1.6.4	Thanks again to the both of you.	St
1.6.5	Adi	St
1.7.1	Hope you don't mind a little more info on the subject...a few days late perhaps.	St

1.8.4	They range in prices from $2.95 to $8.00 each.	St
1.8.5	In cleaning them use hot water and wring out tightly.	St
1.8.6	To remove tough soils put them in your washing machine &quot;alone&quot; and use a drop or two of Dawn or similiar with Hot water and Hot water rinse.	St
1.8.7	Don't dry them in the dryer!	St
1.8.8	They can be used in all types of cleaning while your cleaning your screen.	St
1.8.9	Though I sell them they can be found anywhere on the net and in cleaning supply stores.	St
1.9.1	You must use a manufacturer approved and tested product to avoid damage.	St
1.9.2	Read about Techniclean at WWW.techniclean.tv the worldwide best seller sutable for all screens including plasma.	St
1.9.3	Independant test results TechniClean: 3 Stars This other type of Computer Screen Cleaning Product, requires No Specific Cleaning Cloth.	St
1.9.4	You only need to Spray the Foaming Cleaner onto the Screen, and then use Any Soft, Clean Cloth to Wipe the Surface Clean.	St

1.11.1	I use the Office Depot Screen Cleaner, but there are many others like this on the market.	St
1.11.2	They clean your screen and surely make a good job!	St
1.11.3	My screen is still clean after 10 days I used it on my notebook!	St
1.11.4	See ya!	St
1.12.1	Surely, anyone could have seen that.	Ques
1.12.2	Only a total idiot would have done it.	St
1.12.3	Use steelwool and press hard.	St
1.12.4	Really	St
1.13.1	This may sound highly irregular, but I use nappy liners in conjunction with diluted (one in ten) methylated spirits, and then use a chamois lens cloth to remove any fluff and clear any smudge marks.	St
1.13.2	Of course, one could always just buy a new laptop when the old one gets dirty which will also ensure your equipment is up to date and not getting obsolete	Sug
1.14.1	OK ... it would be clean, but a wire brush would be quicker, and oven cleaner would give it a better shine Obviously this cleaning process assumes that you want to clean the screen ... not use the screen again ;p	St
1.15.1	Make a one in ten dilution using one part methylated spirits and nine parts water.	St
1.15.2	Use a soft cloth dampened with the solution (important, damp ... not dripping wet).	St
1.15.3	I use nappy liners because they are cheap, soft and absorbant.	St
1.15.4	Afterwards I give a soft rub using a Chamois lens cloth to remove any lint, fluff or streaking and smudges.	St
1.15.5	The lens cloth is cheap and available from most opticician's or good camera shops.	St
1.15.6	A damp sponge also does the trick, but you could end up dripping water into the keyboard if you don't wring out the excess water properly ... so I find my solution above a better bet.	St
1.16.1	I liked your idea better than mine.	St
1.17.1	I have always liked the blue window cleaner spray.	St
1.17.2	Do not spray directly on the screen, but rather on a soft clean cotton cloth, e.g., a not entirely new t-shirt or dish towel.	St
1.17.3	Spraying directly on the screen may (1) be too strong a solution and (2) short out the connectors on the sides of the screen; don't so that.	St
1.17.4	In extreme circumstances (long flight or distant land) a little vodka on a cloth will do the trick.	St
1.17.5	It takes something a little stronger that water to remove oily fingerprints and smudges, and soaps leave a film.	St
1.18.1	Ok, I was wondering about this.	St
1.18.2	I just got a desktop PC with a TFT monitor and I just dusted it and the screen bleeds or something, is this normal and ok?	St
1.18.3	Thanks	Polite
1.19.1	Use a damp cloth to clean the finger prints then use a softer cloth the dry those areas you cleaned.	St
1.19.2	Use a microfiber cloth afterwards to go over the whole tv.	St
1.19.3	I just did it and that is why I'm posting this.	St
1.20.1	but you can't use glass cleaner on a plasma screen.	St
1.20.2	It smears.	St
1.20.3	You have to use water.	St
1.21.1	How do I clean my plasma screen?	St
1.22.1	I have a 50&quot; plasma and 37&quot; LCD and the best thing to clean with is Microfiber Suede, soft and gentle.	St
1.22.2	You can buy some expensive versions, but I found a cheap source at www.eriecotton.com.	St
1.22.3	Large 16&quot; towel for about $4.00 a towel.	St
1.22.4	This product is a great polishing cloth, and I use it on my glasses too.	St
1.22.5	For plasma and Lcd cleaning I use it dry to dust and for smudges etc slightly damp and gentle wiping.	St
1.23.1	You people with the fantastic IQs really have to know not everyone is equipped with you know how.	St
1.23.2	Like developed mental people and others.. you promote a disaster and you will more than likely cause a disaster.	St
1.23.3	If your anything like those spectators that promoted that kid in chat online to kill himself, then your are a cold-hearted embarrassment to the Internet community.	St
1.23.4	P.E.R.I.O.D.	St
1.23.5	Wake Up!!	St
1.23.6	there really are people, kids, who would this, & you'll laugh.. of-course..	St
1.24.1	My Panasonic manual says to use diluted detergent if it is really dirty.	St
1.24.2	After spilling beer on my TV screen, here is how I got it perfectly clean.	St
1.24.3	I took a new microfiber cloth, put a single drop of dish detergent on it, and then wrung it out in warm water.	St
1.24.4	I GENTLY went over the entire screen in a circular manner.	St
1.24.5	I then took a dry microfiber (actually kept 1/2 of the same cloth dry) and GENTLY wiped off the screen.	St
1.24.6	My last pass was a with a gently buffing motion.	St
1.24.7	Looks like new and I didn't have to buy any special cleaners.	St
