I had an MSI motherboard with an Athlon 64 3000 CPU and it would hang on boot when it started the IDE detection process.
Turned out to be a failing/defective CD-DVD drive.
Once I disconnected the defective CD-DVD...it booted and worked flawlessly.
Ergo the reason it's so important to disconnect (not remove) periperhals when troubleshooting PCs that won't post or boot.
