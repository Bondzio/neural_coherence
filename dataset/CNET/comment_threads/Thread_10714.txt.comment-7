It isn't just the DVD.
The TV goes through the boot cycle, and then nothing.
Can't get the desktop to display on the TV.
It would be nice if the DVDs would play on the TV though.
Don't have widescreen, alot of DVDs don't come in full screen, and WinDVD will play them full screen.
The few times I got the DVDs to play on the tv the picture wasn't too bad.
I'm not streaming videos, I'm playing my own.
