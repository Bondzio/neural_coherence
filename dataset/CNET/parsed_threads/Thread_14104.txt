<s> So my comp wont start, it was running fine the other day, I installed a new hard drive and an hour later it froze up. </s>
<s> Now it wont even boot up. </s>
<s> I replaced the power supply, no dice. </s>
<s> Removed all components and still nothing. </s>
<s> I thought it might be the BIOS battery, nope. </s>
<s> Motherboard nope, well then it had to be the CPU, nope. </s>
<s> Anyone help? </s>
<s> When I press the power button the CPU fan moves a bit then stops. </s>
<s> I removed the Motherboard from the case and tested it that way thinking the case may be shorting it somehow, nothing. </s>
<s> Any ideas please help. </s>
<s> A dead board or an upside down or off by row/pin IDE cable. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Did you check the capacitors ? </s>
