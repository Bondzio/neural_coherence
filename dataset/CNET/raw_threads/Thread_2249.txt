ATI and Nvidia use different setups to utilize SLI type technology and boards so no you cant wire them together in a sort of hybred SLI setup. if you're going to go for a dual card setup go with a pair of 6800s; or even better 7800s.

If you check benchmarks posted on most games, the system memory is not as much of an issue as the video card. You probably wouldn't even get a 5 FPS boost using 3 GB instead of 2 GB.
