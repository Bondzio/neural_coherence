I hit the wrong button and deleted Robert's message.
He said that he had done this with other brand systems and it was not succesful.
He said that shows Dell may have an advantage in this area.
I was going to reply (before I hit the wrong button) that Dell includes a full version of Windows XP, not a recovery disk (like HP or many others) so you can do a REAL install with the CD, on any system, it doesn't even check to see if it is a Dell system.
Of course the Install Code isn't as forgiving!!!!
This is one major advantage of a Dell however, you have a problem with the OS you can actually do a repair install, instead of having to wipe the drive and do a recovery.
