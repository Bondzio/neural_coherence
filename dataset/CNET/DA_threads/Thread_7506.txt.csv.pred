1.2.1	http : //www.tomshardware.com/2008/02/04/best_cards_february_2008/page6.html & quot ; In this category we 're recommending the extremely cheap Radeon X1650 PRO .	St
1.2.2	Yes , it 's a DDR2 card , but it 's only $ 65 , and would make a decent upgrade for an AGP system with an older card like a Radeon 9600 or Geforce 5900. & quot ;	St
