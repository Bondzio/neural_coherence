I'd like some suggestions as to what a decent PC for various video operations would be.
For example: Capturing & processing video with a PCI PVR card.
Ripping & processing & burning DVD video.
Price is flexible, but I am interested in best bang for my buck This will be a dedicated unit that sits down by the home theater.
I'm even open to building it myself.
Although I've never built one before, I have a BS in EE & I work full time as an embedded software engineer.
