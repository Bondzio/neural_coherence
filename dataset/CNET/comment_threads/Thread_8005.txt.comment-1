The new article with a sneek peak of Windows longhorn has made me much less stressed out ( http://tinyurl.com/75dhm ).
Someone said you would need like 4GB of RAM to run it well and you would also have to have a 64 bit processor.
Well not only does the article mention it will need &quot;at least 512MB of RAM&quot; but it also says it comes in a 64 bit AND 32 bit versions.
I think that because longhorn will also have 32 bit version, 64 bit will become the standard at a much later time then most people were expecting.
I'm just very thankful that M$ didnt just go all out and make a OS that needs a $2,000+ computer to run.
