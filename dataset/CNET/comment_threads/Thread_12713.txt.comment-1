I purchased a 3.5 COSMOS alum external USB enclosure and a Seagate Barracuda 160 gig HD.
My PC (AMD 64 3500+, 1g Corsair, MSI K8N Neo4 board, 200 gig Seagate internal, 256mb 6800 video,etc) sees the drive as USB mass storage device and even recognizes it as a ST1600 drive but no true ''drive location'' is listed (i.e.
''G'' drive, etc..) and Win Explorer only lists my HD (&quot;C&quot;)and optical drives,(&quot;D & F&quot;) etc.
I have configured the external drive as master which from reading is supposed to be correct.
I believe my problem is I have to format it... Device manager sees this as USB device, etc.. What do I do to make this drive work???
I am using Win XP pro, NTFS format.
Help, Phil
