five days ago my computer crashed.
when i tried booting it up again i got a message that said windows xp could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \windows\system32\config\software.
i was able to repair it however and lost only the my documents folder.
however, a few days later it crashed again, this time the erorr being invalid system disk.
i then reformated and reinstalled xp.
now, my computer is crashing every few hours with the invalid system disk error.
the first time i was able to restart and xp started but now i am getting a blue screen that says something has happened so windows cant start.
i used diagnosis programs to test my hard drive and ram but they said everything is fine.
the temperature of the cpu is around 56 c. does anyone have any ideas as to what could be wrong?
thanks.
p.s.
my computer is a athlon xp 2000+ with 256mb ddr and has been working fine for a little less than a year.
