<s> I have a Brother Multi Function 8680 DN Laser Printer and it operates with Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> Although I like the printer my only issue is that Brother Support tells me that the only way for the Date & Time to work is to initially leave the printer on for 48 hours to charge the battery and not shut it off for more than a day or two (leave in sleep mode). </s>
<s> If I shut it off for a few days, it resets to a default 1/1/2010 setting and I lose fax logs. </s>
<s> Why would any printer with an uninterrupted power source require being on continuously to maintain it's date in time. </s>
<s> In an era of trying to cut power consumption, this would seem to be a poor design feature particularly if a large organization had hundreds of printers. </s>
<s> Please comment </s>
<s> I had the same problem with my first refurbished 8680DN unit I got from Staples. </s>
<s> I realized this was a defect, so I returned it for a replacement unit. </s>
<s> My replacement unit does not have such a problem. </s>
<s> Hi: My unit is new, I called Brother and an affiliated service unit and they told me that it must be turned on almost continuously. </s>
<s> It doesn't make sense. </s>
<s> And, I won't buy another HP model as HP is difficult to deal with and their solutions after a couple of years is to buy, buy, buy! </s>
<s> By the way, what was the defect in your unit? </s>
