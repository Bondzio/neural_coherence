ha!
i picked the same printer up the monday after thanksgiving when staples had a sale, buy a new laptop, get the printer for $40.
when i tried to connect the printer to the router it would not connect after repeated tries, wouldn't even turn on.
the next day i boxed it up and returned it to staples.
they swapped it for another one, same model.
the replacement one worked perfectly.
