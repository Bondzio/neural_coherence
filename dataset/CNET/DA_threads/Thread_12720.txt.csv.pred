1.1.1	Hi , I picked up this monitor from a local goodwill for about $ 20 .	St
1.1.2	It did n't have a power supply , so I ordered a replacement ( not from HP , from another vendor ) .	St
1.1.3	The one I got is rated at 12V , 5A , and it worked fine .	St
1.1.4	But after a day , I discovered the backlight power failure issue that apparently plagues these monitors .	St
1.1.5	Discovered the thread here , and though most of the solutions pointed to problems in HP 's power supply , I wanted to see if anyone has a suggestion if I 'm using a new , non-HP power supply .	St
1.1.6	thanks !	Polite
1.2.1	Provided the ps falls into the same specs as the old HP one did , there should n't be a problem .	St
1.2.2	The issue on this forum that users had were bad & quot ; inverters & quot ; located within the LCD itself , not the ps .	St
1.2.3	The inverter had poor manufacture or componets so they got whacked .	St
1.2.4	the reply of that same monitor also provided links to fixes and repairs that could be made or at least point to the problem area .	St
1.2.5	This needs some disassembly so if you 're not capable , then find a good repair center/shop .	St
1.2.6	That $ 20 LCD may not be a bargain after all .	St
1.2.7	Use the forum search engine to locate the topic .	St
1.2.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	thanks Willy !	Polite
1.3.2	time to get out the soldering iron .	St
1.3.3	I 'm working on reading through that thread now but it 's over 350 posts , mostly furious customers posting their frustrating treatment at the hands of HP tech support , so it 's taking me a little while ...	St
1.4.1	Believe me its worth looking to hit the one with the & quot ; details and such & quot ; and breakdown of the LCD case .	St
1.4.2	I used HP 1703 and possibly HP 1503 ( similar ) to get those valuable tips/hints/fixes/cures , etc .	St
1.4.3	via the forum search .	St
1.4.4	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.5.1	Here is a direct link , that was founded via C/Net then on to a user that really started a blog .	St
1.5.2	http : //www.lesliewong.us/blog/2005/05/02/hp-pavilion-f1703-flat-panel-display-blackout-solution/ again good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.6.1	Thanks again .	St
1.6.2	Unbelievable .	St
1.6.3	If only fixing everything was that easy .	St
1.6.4	The solder points on mine looked good , but I put more on anyway - 15 minutes and it was working perfectly .	St
