<s> Printer is an HP PhotoSmart C4280 connected via usb to pc, Operating system is Windows XPPro SP3, Computer is a Dell Dimension 4600i. </s>
<s> I have uninstalled the printer several times, I have reinstalled various versions of the printer driver. </s>
<s> Whenever I print to this printer I get Windows Installer popping up wanting to install a feature that is not available. </s>
<s> It wants &quot;G:\ Market Research&quot;. </s>
<s> My Logical Disk Management has changed the disk &quot;Letters&quot; so G: no longer exists. </s>
<s> If I &quot;cancel&quot; the request twice the printer continues and prints. </s>
<s> I have tried various things and I do not want to reformat the HDD for this annoyance. </s>
<s> Uninstall the printer and reinstall it. </s>
<s> It will find another drive to put their market research on and all will be fine again. </s>
