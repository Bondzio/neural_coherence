the power supply w/ most boxes i have seen is 420w (sometimes 350w).
i would rather spend the extra 50-80 bucks to go to a 500w from a decent manufacturer.
you are right, though, &quot;price first&quot; is a dangerous mindframe.
where would you think i could cut my cost a little bit?
i don't need dual dvd/cd drives, media card readers, zip drives, blah blah blah, so thats a start.
but where else can i save money?
