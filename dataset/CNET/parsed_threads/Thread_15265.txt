<s> I have built a system with a msi k7n2 delta-ilsr with an amd athlon xp 2400 processor. </s>
<s> I have a quantum fire ball 30 gig hard drive. </s>
<s> When I'm doing work especially when I'm online the computer beeps once and restarts at the same time. </s>
<s> About a month ago the power supply burned out and I replaced it thinking that was the problem, but that is not the case. </s>
<s> It's back to doing the same thing. </s>
<s> Please help!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> No error messages, just sudden restarts? </s>
<s> Try opening the case and pointing a fan at the inside, heat build up might be the cause. </s>
<s> And eyeball those internal fans while you are there. </s>
<s> may be an inadequarte Power Supply. </s>
<s> Put a good quality higher rated supply in, if the problem is not caused bymthe CPU getting too hot. </s>
