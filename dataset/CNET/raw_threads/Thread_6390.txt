He suggested that I go with the Lynksys WRT54GS with speedbooster. My network is set up with 2 desktop computers and my sons X-box hardwired into the router, with another desktop and a laptop with wireless cards. I don't know enough about wireless technology ( wireless G, wireless N ) to know if there would be a difference in response time from the router to the individual devices. My son occassionally complains about lag time with his X-box live, and I notice a huge difference between the desktop that is 3 feet from the router, and the other which is @ 80 feet away. I would like to stay with Lynksys, as I find that this seems to work best in my neighborhood with my internet provider. Any insight would be helpful. Thanks Dennis

No wireless solution will assure you that it won't contribute to lag, ping times. This is why you wire such a connection. At 80 feet, the situation is not going to get any better. You would NEVER consider wifi for this. You might consider ethernet cable or powerline links. Bob

The desktop that is 80 feet away, and the X-box are hardwired with cat5 ethernet cable, as well as the desktop that is 3 feet away. The X-box is approximately 25 feet away from the router. Will there be a difference in response time based on the different factors? ( Distance, type of router, etc.. ) Thanks Dennis
