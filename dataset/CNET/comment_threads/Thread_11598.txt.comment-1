This might be a stupid question, but how well do the macs interact with the rest of the windows world.
If I write up a bunch of papers on a pc will it be easy to get it to the mac?
and vice versa?
Do saved documents on a mac transfer to a pc without great effort?
I've heard that there are isn't a whole lot of software that's compatible with both machines, I might be wrong though.
Does this mean I'll have to get completely different software that can't 'communicate' with my friends who own pc's?
I'm looking in to buying a mac so I'd like to know how easy it's gonna be to mesh with the rest of the world.
