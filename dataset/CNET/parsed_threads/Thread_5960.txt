<s> I upgraded the RAM on a Dell 131L laptop from two 512 MB cards to two 1 GB cards. </s>
<s> I purchased the RAM from an Ebay store. </s>
<s> It is DDR2 533 MHz. </s>
<s> The specs on this system say it can handle up to 2.05 GB. </s>
<s> The cards register on the system as 1.9 GB. </s>
<s> When I initially installed the new RAM the computer would boot normally and operate with improved speed for the duration of that first boot. </s>
<s> On subsequent boots Windows either would not boot or would crash within 5-10 min (blue screen of death). </s>
<s> I went through two or three rounds of installing the old RAM and running it for awhile (with no troubles) and then installing the new RAM (after which the same series of events would occur as I just described). </s>
<s> After reading several internet forums (including this one)and visiting the seller's troubleshooting site, I went to the Dell website and updated the BIOS. </s>
<s> This solved the problem of Windows crashing within 5-10 min on subsequent boots. </s>
<s> The computer would run normally during active use but when left alone with no programs open several hours Windows crashes. </s>
<s> I don't know how long it takes for it to crash, just that when I return to the computer, the blue screen of death is up. </s>
<s> The message says something like &quot;new hardware has been installed and is causing a problem. </s>
<s> If this is the first time to see this message re-install the hardware. </s>
<s> If it is not the first time...&quot; I don't know the exact wording because each of the two times it has happened, my girlfriend (its her laptop) has just shut the computer down. </s>
<s> Today I downloaded memtest86+ version 4.10 and ran each memory card on the program. </s>
<s> I ran one card for 5 passes with no errors. </s>
<s> The other card is currently on its 3rd pass with no errors(I will let it run a full 5 passes). </s>
<s> I will happily provide any other system info if it will help, just didn't want to make the post longer than it is right now. </s>
<s> What should my next step be to solve the problem? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> If both cards apart test OK, don't forget to test with both cards together (so the full 2 MB). </s>
<s> I don't really see what you mean with: - the specs saying it can handle up to 2.05 GB, because there are not .05 GB cards - the cards register as 1.9 GB. </s>
<s> 1+1=2, not 1.9. </s>
<s> Where do you see that strange amount? </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> I went to crucial.com and used their software to scan my computer for available memory upgrades. </s>
<s> They list this model as having a maximum of 2048 MB(1000MB is a GB right?). </s>
<s> I believe that is what is listed on the Dell website as well. </s>
<s> When I posted I converted to GB and rounded up. </s>
<s> As far as the 1.9 GB, I went through the control panel to the system properties icon under the &quot;General&quot; tab. </s>
<s> Here it lists the the OS w/ service pack, computer model, CPU and amount of RAM. </s>
<s> For example, I am currently running the computer on one 1GB memory card but when I go through the control panel it lists 896 MB of RAM. </s>
<s> I am not sure about the weird numbers either (maybe a difference between binary/base2 vs decimal/base 10 notation?). </s>
<s> Sorry for the confusion. </s>
<s> I will run memtest with both cards in and report back. </s>
<s> I have done some more internet reading and found that it may be a motherboard issue? </s>
<s> I found a site where someone had a nearly identical problem to mine and he concluded his motherboard could not handle that amount of RAM even though the spec sheet stated that it could. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on that? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help so far. </s>

<s> or 1024MBs (1 DIMM) minus 128MBs allocated for video RAM for systems with onboard graphics leaves you 1.92GBs or 896MBs respectively. </s>
<s> Bottom line, your system will always show something different than the actual RAM installed. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Running memtest with both cards installed showed several failures at test 8 pass 3. </s>
<s> Any suggestions for fixing the problem? </s>
<s> How did you select the memory? </s>
<s> What did you do to ensure it was the right kind for your system and would be compatible? </s>
<s> Please provide brand and model numbers on the memory. </s>
<s> If the sticks apart are OK, it seems more like a motherboard issue indeed. </s>
<s> I don't expect the seller of the sticks to return your money. </s>
<s> So now it's time to contact Dell tech support, maybe? </s>
<s> Either they acknowledge it's a motherboard error or they have you buy Dell certified memory. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work either, Dell at least should give your money back. </s>
<s> If the original Dell memory works, you can return the sticks you bought now as defective or not compatible and ask your money back. </s>

<s> The spec shows.... Memory module connector </s>
<s> I searched ebay for Dell 131L laptop memory and chose a seller because of his 30 day money back guarantee and free shipping. </s>
<s> In retrospect, I didn't do anything to ensure compatibility. </s>
<s> The memory is Avant brand DDR2 PC2-4200 533 MHz. </s>
<s> I just noticed that the memory Crucial recommends is DDR2 PC2-5300. </s>
<s> While I am not sure the of difference between 4200 and 5300, I would be willing to bet that is what is causing my problem. </s>
<s> I'd be open to any advice you may deem pertinent at this point. </s>
<s> The memory is going back Mon and I will give Crucial a try. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Long story short, the seller sent me new RAM and the computer is working well. </s>
<s> More details below if anyone is interested.... </s>
<s> I contacted the seller and made arrangements to return the RAM for a refund. </s>
<s> A mistake was made on the seller's end and they processed it as an exchange. </s>
<s> Good thing I decided to wait until I saw the money refunded in my account before buying the RAM from Crucial. </s>
<s> Since I didn't realize the mistake had been made until I received the replacement RAM, I decided to give it a try before sending it back. </s>
<s> The computer has ran with no problems for the past week. </s>
<s> Still, I think I will try Crucial next time. </s>
<s> Thanks again for all the advice. </s>
<s> out with a working PC and more RAM. </s>
