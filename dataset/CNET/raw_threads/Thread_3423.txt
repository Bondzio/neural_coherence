I have Dell Laptop with vista . when I search for wireless network it shows my network with &quot;Excellent&quot; signal, but when I connect to the network it decrases to &quot;good&quot; or sometimes &quot;low&quot; . the router is in a very close distance with the laptop . When I tried another laptop, it shows an &quot;Excellent&quot; signal and even when I connect to the network it gives me &quot;Excellent&quot; signal. So , why My Dell give me a &quot;low&quot; signal only when it is connected ? thanks .
