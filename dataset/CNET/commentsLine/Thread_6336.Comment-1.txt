hi, i am trying to buy new ram for my gateway desktop and there is a really good deal on for some ddr3 1600mhz ram.
the memory adviser results on the crucial website say that my computer can hold 16gb of 1333mhz ddr3 (  ).
but does that mean that my computer can't handle 1600mhz ram?
and would there be a performance difference if i was to have 1600mhz instead of the 1333mhz?
also, does it matter if the ram is dram or sdram?
thanks
