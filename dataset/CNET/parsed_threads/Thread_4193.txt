<s> So I just bought a 4GB Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo for my cell, and it came with an adapter, so I can plug it into my laptop. </s>
<s> However, every time I do, I get a lovely blue screen and a free restart. </s>
<s> When I put the 256MB SanDisk that came with the phone in the adapter, it works fine. </s>
<s> What's the deal? </s>
<s> Any way to fix it? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> None of those model numbers are anywhere on either the card or the adapter. </s>
<s> The apparent model number is MSX-M4GST/X. </s>
<s> I just purchased a &quot;MSX-M4GST/X&quot; memory stick, and I've immediatly got a blue screen of death from it. </s>
<s> After some investigation I've determined this stick is a counterfeit, and a very good one at that. </s>
<s> There is a guide here which explains the counterfeit chips: http://reviews.ebay.com/FAKE-Sony-Memory-Stick-Pro-Duo-MagicGate-Cards-Exposed_W0QQugidZ10000000001236041?ssPageName=BUYGD:CAT:-1:LISTINGS:2 I purchased mine on ebay so I'm going through the process of getting a full refund from the seller. </s>
