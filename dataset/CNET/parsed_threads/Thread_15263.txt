<s> I've got a slave drive that was working fine and now wants new formatting. </s>
<s> Is there any way to fix the file system without formatting it so I can possibly save the data I had on it? </s>
<s> I'm running Windows 2000 Pro with Service Pack 4. </s>
<s> The drive is not the system drive for the computer. </s>
<s> You posted in a hardware forum, but it looks like a software or format issue. </s>
<s> Here's a link to the usual software: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=file+recovery+pro&btnG=Google+Search Bob </s>
<s> How important is your data, you could send the drive to a data recovery service (like Ontrack) to get the data back. </s>
<s> When a drive all of a sudden needs formatting again there is usually something wrong with it, physically. </s>
<s> What actually happened that led up to this, what told you it needed formatting, EXACTLY what did you see? </s>
