<s> I am endeavoring to learn Win XP Pro for the 70-270 exam. </s>
<s> The training book came with a 120 Win XP Pro OS Disc uprgrade. </s>
<s> My laptop runs Win XP Home. </s>
<s> I don't want to upgrade to the temporary system for it to mess things up. </s>
<s> Win Xp Home takes up the entire hard drive. </s>
<s> Repartitioning is is very difficult if not impossible to fit it on the same drive. </s>
<s> Do you think I could get an external HD and load it up with the home and then use the upgrade and then boot from the external for training purposes? </s>
<s> My only other alternative is to purchase the full Win XP Pro upgrade and use it forever and ever. </s>
<s> This isn't the worst choice and perhaps the best. </s>
<s> Your opinion is deeply appreciated. </s>

<s> Windows (any version) does not run from USB or Firewire drives today. </s>
<s> Partition Magic could partition without wiping out your XP Home and you could perform a parallel install. </s>
<s> For not much more you could install a new hard disk and use that. </s>

<s> The new hard drive sounds pretty interesting. </s>
<s> I don't want to go through the reconfiguring of all my browsers, clients and so forth. </s>
<s> Let's not even think about the docs! </s>
<s> It doesn't have to be that large of a HD. </s>
<s> I'll check ebay and also look at upgrades. </s>
<s> Bob, have you got any Microsoft certs? </s>
<s> Any advice on the exams? </s>

<s> I'm more of an embedded electronics designer. </s>
<s> It's because of IT staff that our engineers took up learning about PCs and more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've always been involved with computers but have learned so much due to our engineers lack of response. </s>
<s> They now wonder why I don't call them. </s>
<s> They usually confuse the matter more than assist and I get more accomplished without them. </s>
<s> Freaks them out! </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice! </s>
