<s> I arrived at work today to find that my IBM P77 monitor (6639-u3n) had been tampered with ( someones idea of April fool I suppose ) The problem is that the text is in reverse and the window boxes etc are upside down. </s>
<s> I tried a duplicate monitor and the PC works ok with that. </s>
<s> Has anyone any idea of what was done and more importantly to me how to fix it without going to the jokers </s>
<s> Your monitor *may* have on-screen diagnostic controls. </s>
<s> Also, these are config. </s>
<s> control as well. </s>
<s> Using those, see if you can find a &quot;default&quot; mode. </s>
<s> then set it, now tweak it for best operation. </s>
<s> If none of this makes sense, IBM is pretty helpful via thier support website, find your model and get a &quot;manual/guide&quot; to help you. </s>
<s> Of course make sure that some simple pgm. </s>
<s> isn't working that really the culpit. </s>
<s> Report it to your boss or manager and play an April Fool's, on your fellow workers, &quot;Your're fired&quot; bye, adios, your check is in the mail. </s>
<s> Health benefits run-out in 1yr. </s>
<s> yadadadada..... good luck -----Willy </s>
