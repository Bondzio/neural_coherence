recently purchased macbook pro 17&quot;.
all fonts are micro type.
web pages are columns using only one half to one third of the nice big screen.
i can &quot;zoom&quot; but that is not a permanent solution.
this includes the tool bar........ its tiny.
how do i make things readable and fit the screen?
i cannot find the answer in the manual or online but i may be searching the wrong criteria.
help in the form of the correct web page is fine.
