Restarted in safe mode with networking and it started fine I'm currently backing my 2 hard drives up with power2go to be on the safe side, but i'd like to know how to fix it as I'm scared to turn the thing off now Please let me know what you think

Since you can boot to Safe Mode OK, go into the Display applet of the Control Panel and lower the resolution. Good luck.

Normally I'd use the default for the monitor, but if your PC's video can't handle that, you've got to either lower the setting or get a better video card. Try 800 x 600 and see if that works. If it does, try 1024 x 786, and keep going up 'till you find one that doesn't, then back down from that. Good luck.

The res however is the same 1440 x 900, so I don't know what got it working again, but I'm not complaining! Thanks for the help. But any idea what fixed it?
