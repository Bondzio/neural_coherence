Hi, I live in an old house, and I do not know how current the wiring is.
The outlets are all three prong grounded.
What I would appreciate knowing is, what should/can I do to protect my computer?
I am already using a Dynex battery backup/uninterupted power supply.
The outlets on the UPS that I am plugged into are marked &quot;surge/battery.&quot; There are three additional ones for &quot;surge&quot; only.
Will this setup be sufficient, or do I need something else?
Thank you,
