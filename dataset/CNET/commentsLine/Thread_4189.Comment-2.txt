the cost of upgrades will get you close to the cost of a new system box--either from dell or your own build.
the new components in a new system will be much faster and less troublesome than the best upgrades to your old system.
if you can find dirt cheap or free parts, i would consider maxing ram to 512mb, installing a usb2.0 pci card, and getting a better agp 4x (agp4x/8x) card that is compatible with your agp slot voltage.
after all that, you may have to upgrade your psu.
again, this would only be a consideration for me if the parts were essentially free.
