<s> I have an external hard drive by ADS technologies. </s>
<s> it's model number usbx-835 and I cannot find a power adapter for it anywhere. </s>
<s> The pin configuration seems so strange, i don't know if it's a 5 or 6 pin set up! </s>
<s> Can anyone help me? </s>
<s> thank you! </s>
<s> It's faster and cheaper to change to another enclosure. </s>
<s> the cords are out there all over ebay for 10 or 15 bucks...that would be easiest, but i can't seem to find the right one. </s>
<s> the hard drive is attached to the enclosure and i don't really know how to just change out the enclosure. </s>
<s> i wish i could just plug it into the usb and make it work, but it needs external power obviously. </s>
<s> You claim the cords are there but you did not find the right one. </s>
<s> Again, change the drive to a new enclosure and you'll fix this in much less time that anyone expected. </s>
<s> Here's a tutorial -&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FlySnyJ0CQ </s>
<s> You need two voltages that are present in any 3 1/2&quot; enclosure PS brick. </s>
<s> You use your DVM or, if lucky, wiring color codes to figure out what goes to where. </s>
<s> You get soldering and splicing equipment...maybe a grommet or two. </s>
<s> I can't give exact step by step but this can be done. </s>
<s> You're result may be ugly and it won't be UL approved. </s>
<s> Make sure you're home insurance is up to date. </s>
<s> Or, use Bob's advice. </s>
