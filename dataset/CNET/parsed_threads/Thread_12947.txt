<s> I just put in a DVR-108 into my computer; however, the computer does not seem to see that it is there. </s>
<s> I can play a movie on it or a cd, but not record to it. </s>
<s> I never received an installation CD and I got the firmware already. </s>
<s> Still no go. </s>
<s> Can someone help please b/c I know that I'm doing something wrong! </s>
<s> No OS mentioned either. </s>
<s> Try http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ But if you run Linux, use K3b. </s>
<s> Read you post and consider this is all you told. </s>

<s> Thank you for all the help it works great now. </s>
<s> Does that software allow me to write the dual layer? </s>
<s> Besides you can't get dual layer DVDRW today. </s>

<s> What platform are you on - PC/Mac? </s>
<s> Anyhow if you are on a mac you probably have to download a driver called patchburn x.0 (depending on your version of OS X). </s>
<s> You can download it here http://www.patchburn.de/ Good luck. </s>
