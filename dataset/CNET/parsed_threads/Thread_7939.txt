<s> Computer (Dell)has been working fine then yesterday I went to watch a video and it played fine but no voice. </s>
<s> So I checked to see if the volume might have gotten on mute but it was on it's regular setting. </s>
<s> The icon is no longer in the tray as it usually is. </s>
<s> Then check Sounds & Devices and everything is grayed out staying no audio device can be found. </s>
<s> I checked everything else and update all the drivers but still no sound. </s>
<s> How could it suddenly disappear. </s>
<s> Any help, as always is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> So I'm going with GENERIC ADVICE. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Use system restore to the day before yesterday. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> NEVER ACCEPT DRIVERS from Microsoft unless you are ready to deal with the failures. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Look in the BIOS settings for the enable/disable of on board sound. </s>
<s> A few reply they didn't change it which is nice to know but still something we must check. </s>
<s> Sorry for the generic answers but no model number to work with. </s>
<s> And don't panic if the audio card is gone and failed. </s>
<s> There are 2 dollar USB sound devices to take over for a cheap fix. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Now that is crazy. </s>
<s> I haven't had to do restore for a very long time. </s>
<s> Went to System Restore and to click on a restore date. </s>
<s> There are no dates showing. </s>
<s> The &quot;calendar&quot; is blank. </s>
<s> As for the drivers I only checked to see if they were all up to date and they were. </s>
<s> What would cause this issue with system restore? </s>
<s> Going to check the BIOS settings now. </s>
<s> Nice when it works but it fails for far too many reasons for me to list here. </s>
<s> No model number, no OS listed so we are still in generic answers. </s>
<s> Oh, here's the 2 buck audio fix I use too often -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-5-1-surround-External-Sound-Card/dp/B000N35A0Y/ That's $1.46 today to my mail box. </s>
<s> I carry one with me if I'm out to troubleshoot/fix an audio issue like the one above. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Dell Inspiron and Windows XP. </s>
<s> Sounds like a easy fix if all else fails...will order one today. </s>
<s> I see you see why I carry one in my bag of tricks. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Once again....you've help solve a issue without a great deal of cost. </s>
<s> Thanks Raven </s>
<s> But it's not a done deal yet. </s>
<s> It is something I've used a few times and sometimes I don't even have to install a driver for that thing. </s>
<s> Try it without the driver and hope. </s>
<s> -&gt; About system restore. </s>
<s> If it's empty try the old Windows thing. </s>
<s> Disable SR and then re-enable SR. Bob </s>
<s> I tried what you suggested and that still didn't fix the issue. </s>
<s> So I ran Disk Cleanup and SR now show the calendar but now it won't allow me to chose a date. </s>
<s> My only option is restore today. </s>
<s> I went into Device Manager and there is a yellow question mark beside Multimedia Audio Controller. </s>
<s> I did right click on it, disabled and enabled and check properties. </s>
<s> It appears their is no audio controller or driver...I'm not sure which of those is the issue and how to fix it. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Just remove the sound controller. </s>
<s> Windows should try to reinstall it. </s>
<s> Another way to approach this is to see if you have a disk that came with the computer with a chipset driver. </s>
<s> A Chipset Driver is software that tells windows what hardware you have on your computer's motherboard so it will know what it is and how to use it. </s>
<s> Usually this comes with a motherboard or a computer when you purchase it. </s>
<s> If you take your model number of your computer you should be able to go to Dell's website and download it or an updated version. </s>
<s> Look for the support section at dell's website. </s>
<s> Sometimes drivers become corrupt. </s>
<s> This can happen if the power supply is going bad or the hard drive is failing and you get file damage. </s>
<s> If the computer is really old things may be waring out. </s>
<s> Hard drives fail and this may be a sign of a failing hard drive. </s>
<s> Of course your audio devide could be bad also. </s>
<s> Only if there are restore points after the repairs you did. </s>
<s> There are many issues with System Restore and the lack of any backup or restore of this feature is one of them. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I right clicked on Multimedia Audio Controller and properities. </s>
<s> It states there is no driver. </s>
<s> I searched around and the driver they are suggesting is Realtek 97 and it keeps crashing my pc midway through the install causing the Blue Screen of Death. </s>
<s> After I two attempts at installing it I gave it. </s>
<s> I also went in Services, Windows Audio and clicked on restart and nothing. </s>
<s> Still no audio. </s>
<s> I shut down and rebooted and still no sound. </s>
<s> I just keeps stating there is no driver for Multimedia Audio Controller. </s>
<s> I downloaded the suggested one from here but for some reason it won't allow me to run it. </s>
<s> Any suggestions. </s>
<s> And dozens of drivers for each one. </s>
<s> So it is almost a sure thing you can't get the right one. </s>
<s> ----&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't find the MODEL NUMBER of this Dell. </s>
<s> Then means I have to go with generic advice along with the usual head to dell.com, put in the service tag from the machine for the drivers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry I thought I had posted that info. </s>
<s> I also was wrong on what Dell it is. </s>
<s> It's actually Dimesion 4550 not a Inspiron (that is my laptop). </s>
<s> Not sure if it's any help as I didn't post it but the Audio Device is Unimodem Half Duplex Audio Device. </s>
<s> I'll give Dell a try and post whatever results I get. </s>
<s> Reply to the top post to carry on. </s>
