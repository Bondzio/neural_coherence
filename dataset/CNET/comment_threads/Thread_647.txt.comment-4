but do you want to get a new motherboard then?
There are a few 939 dual-core CPUs that you could upgrade to if you want to keep the same motherboard assuming that you have a 939 now as Googling that CPU brought up a 939 model.
If you do go for the Intel side then a Core 2 Duo or better would be my suggestion.
