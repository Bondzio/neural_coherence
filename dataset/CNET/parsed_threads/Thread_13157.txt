<s> I just moved to the UK from the US and I am trying to get my desktop up and running. </s>
<s> Dell customer service is useless. </s>
<s> Is there a company that sells a kit to do this (UK cords, power conversion items, etc.)? </s>
<s> Any advice is appreciated. </s>
<s> My friends simply use step down transformers for the devices that don't run on 240. </s>
<s> The items that are rated for that higher voltage just need a new cord or plug adapter. </s>
<s> Dell has little to nothing to do with this. </s>
<s> Your expectations are dashed here. </s>

<s> I tried to plug everything into a US power strip then I plugged the strip cord into a Radio Shack Converter. </s>
<s> I ended up hearing a buzzing sound through the computer speakers and then heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound before the circuit blew on the wall outlet. </s>
<s> Do you think I damaged the computer? </s>
<s> I fear I may need a new power supply for the computer but how can I tell? </s>
<s> Also, any recommendataions on where to get power cords/step down converters for the desktop in the UK? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> You need to see what runs on 240 and what does not. </s>
<s> The Radio Shack convertor has to be of sufficient size to handle what you plug into it. </s>
<s> What parts run directly on 240 (or thereabouts) should not be on the convertor. </s>
<s> The Radio Shack people should be chatty about this so take advantage and talk about it there since this medium is not as chatty. </s>
