i see from it's setup that this is not going to be easy enough for me to solve here.
while i have setup these things, unless i was privy to every detail it's too likely what i didn't know had an error.
find a local network guru and offer pizza and cherry coke and accolades to get this all working.
in closing i used this one -&gt; wgps606 (see google.com) its instructions are no better but since i used to write embedded web servers and routers a long time ago it wasn't all that hard to see what they wanted me to do.
