thank you for the link.
i'm not sure if i should shell out the cash for a new psu and find it still not working.
and as for anything else about the machine, i didn't think anything else i could say would make a difference.
but now that i think that power might be an issue - i have 512mb ddr ram, a radeon 9000 video card, an 80 gig hard drive plus a 10gb additional hard drive, 3 case fans and that cd-r drive.
could not enough power be the issue?
and is there more info my system that could help?
