<s> The cables are specific to the monitor in question. </s>
<s> In other words, they're not that generic. </s>
<s> You still hadn't explain your problem does the monitor work? </s>
<s> Have you tried anything yet? </s>
<s> Is the monitor cable at the monitor side or at the video port? </s>
<s> If not, you maybe able to return cable provide no real physical damage is done, just loose. </s>
<s> Otherwise, disassemble the back cover and see what's what, again only if you're capable. </s>
<s> Get back. </s>

<s> yes the montior does work , my son did not unscrew the video connector plug he puled it out and the who;e thing came out of the monther board in the back or can i get another video card and install that will it work. </s>
<s> richard </s>
<s> So what you are saying is, the monitor port &quot;where the cable plugs into&quot; was yanked off the motherboard. </s>
<s> Fortunately, you can buy a graphics card or basic monitor card and put one in. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, I won't say there wasn't any damage to the motherboard itself further than where the port got yanked from but if you are lucky, there isn't. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> If the video port is ashew then yes you can replace it. </s>
<s> You will need to &quot;disable&quot; the build-in mtrbd. </s>
<s> video and install a new video card. </s>
<s> The new card should contain instructions for all this or at its support website. </s>
<s> Place electrical tape to prevent the video port from moving to possibility cause a short or whatever, just keep it from moving. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
