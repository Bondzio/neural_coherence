i would consider getting it built dell can do pc's for under $400 per unit also i would defintaly consider systems with some of the following cpu's: pentium iv (the slow ones, don't go over 2.4ghz (exception is the lga 775 2.8, as it's only $154-ish) celeron celeron d (better than celeron) the chip i would actually use if i was you the amd duron as it's the previous generation value chip you can get a duron for $50/cpu @ most retailers and add in a mid-price nforce2 motherboard with onboard gf4mx gfx, 256-512mb of ddr, and a 40gb hdd and your set man just throw in a decent case/psu combo you could probalby do it for $250/system but consider 20 machines will take you some time to build
