hi im using windows 7 32 bit with intel pro/wireless 3945abg wireless card on an hp dv2000 and starting from today my wireless was unable to detect any networks.
wen u mouse over the icon in the lower right corner, it says &quot;not connected - no connections are available&quot; which is not true because my router is right next to me and is working cuz im using ethernet to write this right now and my ipod touch can connect to its wireless.
wen i go to the properties it says the device is working properly but its obviously not, and this is what the status looks like:  now i tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver but it didnt help either.. on the hp dv2000 there is a wireless switch which i made sure was on, the light was also blue which means its on (red means its off) but it still wouldnt detect any wireless networks.. what can i do to fix this?
