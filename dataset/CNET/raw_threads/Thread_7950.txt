By the way, &quot;we&quot; refers to XPS 700 purchasers. 1) The nVidia 590 chipset that Dell openly brags about on their mobo's is really a limited version of the 590 southbridge combined with a &quot;slimmed down version of the nForce 4 northbridge&quot;. Several features of the 590 chipset (as listed on the Nvidia site) are disabled on the Dell mobo. 2) The X-Fi sound card that Dell claims to put in this computer is a licensed version which, once again, has been limited. It does not support Dolby 5.1 nor does it support DTS. 3) The special &quot;XPS support team&quot;, who is supposed to be available 24/7 (part of the cost of the XPS) told a customer who's power button broke after 2 weeks of ownership, that she would have to wait until Monday for a resolution. Also included in the price of an XPS, next day in-home service. So beware possible Dell customers. This is apparently not the same Dell we once knew. They have flat out lied to their customers at all stages of production. Perhaps they will change their way of doing business soon; but until then...BEWARE

When I build my own, I have know exactly what is going into my machine--no surprises. I also don't have to pay for hardware/software I don't want or won't use. I still rely on the big boys for office/corporate systems.
