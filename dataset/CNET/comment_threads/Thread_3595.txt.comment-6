If &quot;top hat&quot; means &quot;hot flashing&quot; placing one IC over another, then you're on your own.
It may work it may not on its own merits.
Further, having successfully done it, you still need *very similar* mtrbd.
bios otherwise, features will get hosed or simply place a corrupted bios(to org.
mtrbd.)
from new source and get flaky even if boots-up which alone is good but not 100% as you may find out.
If it gets this far, you can then try reflashing again to the corrupted bios from org.
bios file to rebuild it to its &quot;proper bios level&quot; or any working revision now current.
