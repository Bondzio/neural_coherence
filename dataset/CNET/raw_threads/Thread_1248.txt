But from rumours I've heard, Apple may relase a new laptop with the new processors and hard drives. Is all this worth it the wait or should I buy the new ones know. Also, if I buy from Apple, instead of Amazon before Leopard is relased, will they give me a free upgrade. Thanks everyone

I'm just thinking here,as this will be my first laptop and it may carry some Landscape Design software, as this is what I want to major in. Plus, with a new redesign on the MacBook Pros (rumor). From what Apple Insider is saying sometime this year, Apple will have new Macbook Pros with the LED backlight and the Santa Rosa processors. And the new ultra portable Mac Apple is supposed to be relasing late '07, early '08. I have an Uncle that works for Intel. I'm going to call him up later tonight and ask about these new processors. I'll let you know what he says, as he probaly helped design it.

I'm still debating the Pro model, as I will have to talk this designer thing over with my Dad, and see where I can get it and how much. If I don't go with the pro model, should I stick with the MacBook, or just go all in with the Pro. Thanks
