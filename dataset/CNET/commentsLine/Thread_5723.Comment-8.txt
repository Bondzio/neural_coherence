i remember those units.
that computer connection was so it could be controlled by same and the midi out was not only for output from the keyboard but to control down stream instruments.
i'm sorry but i thought you were a midi aficionado and only was in need of getting your gear up and running again after a change of machines.
after all this i'm beginning to thing this is your first midi setup.
bob ps.
the picture helps but when we get right down to it, make, model, age, manuals, etc.
