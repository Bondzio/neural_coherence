I was in exactly the same boat, but I decided not to allow Alienware to drag me along that long.
When they started giving me delivery dates that were a month longer than they said when I placed the purchase, I immediately cancelled and built the system myself.
My dollars speak for themselves, I build the same system for about $1500 less and used the difference to buy a nice Dell for my niece.
I'll never buy again now that I've built a system on my own.
