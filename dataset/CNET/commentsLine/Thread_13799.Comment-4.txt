thanks for the input, i appreciate it.
however, i think my question was misunderstood, it's an odd question.
i was trying to ask if, since i tried to update the bios within windows, would it give me a message stating the bios update was not compatible with 64-bit windows, even though it was actually compatible if i used an alternative method to windows.
so in essence, should i try to update the bios with a usb drive (since that's all i have) even though when i tried to update within windows it said it was not compatible?
hopefully that's a little more clear.
