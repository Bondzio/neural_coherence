<s> AnandTech benchmarks seem to show that the 260 runs about 30W less at idle and that the two are essentially equal under load. </s>
<s> Given that the card will spend a vast majority of time at or near idle, does it make sense to spend nearly double the price, once the 9800 price cuts hit (making the GTX+ roughly $230)? </s>
<s> At current California prices for electricity the financial cost for the electrical power difference between the cards would be $37.74 (based on $.1436 per kWh) per year, if you run your PC 24/7. </s>
<s> I'm clueless how many tonnes of CO2 that is. </s>
<s> Obviously it'd be cooler to run. </s>
<s> And sexier cuz it's new. </s>
<s> XD </s>
<s> But lets take a real bill and find a number to use. </s>
<s> Using the total bill divided by the number of KWh I arrive at 15.68 cents per KWh. </s>
<s> 1 year = 8,760 hours 30 Watts for 1 year = 262.8 KWh or 41.21 bucks. </s>
<s> You decide here. </s>
<s> But your usual gamer desktops idles at 200 Watts so let's do that. </s>
<s> About 275 a year. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> you buy a high performance video card based on it's gaming performance, not it's power draw. </s>
<s> if you only game at 1680x1050, a 9800gtx will play most every game just as smoothly as a gtx 260. also consider the new hd 4870 which gives comparable performance to a gtx 260 for $100 less. </s>
