I have the Harmon Kardon soundsticks and I find the sound really good, but, as you can see from the photos, the subwoofer has a blue light glowing when it's powered.
If it's for your bedroom, one of the others would be better if they don't have lights on them (if you leave them powered all the time and if glowing lights will bother your sleep).
That's the only drawback to them, otherwise I'd recommend them.
