There are pros and cons for either system.
Just like in printers that just print heads or not.
At 150 for a drum I can only guess this is a printer over 150 bucks new.
All drums need replacement some day but the HP and Canon design has you paying a bit more each change versus toner only systems.
I can't guess why I would be concerned here but the drum and toner system keeps the machine in very near new condition.
