<s> Hi, I want to buy a wireless laser mouse. </s>
<s> I ve researched a lot on various mices, but Logtiech's G7 gaming mouse and the MX610 laser mouse catch my interest. </s>
<s> Onto my question. </s>
<s> I ve seen on the MX610, there are two buttons near the thumb area, for going back and forward while browsing the internet. </s>
<s> I had an hp mouse with similar buttons but they always accounted for Accidental Clicks. </s>
<s> And I would end up way too back or forward while browsing. </s>
<s> Does this happen with the MX610 also? </s>
<s> Please let me know, thanks in advance. </s>
<s> These do work very well. </s>

<s> They work very well, but what about the accidental clicks? </s>
<s> Are they positioned such that u ll press these buttons by ur thumb without inteding to? </s>
<s> That happens on hp mice. </s>
<s> It is the Nortek Office 200WD, had a power rating of 5Volts 100milliAmps. </s>
<s> It is quite power hungry and sometimes, not a lot but sometimes, doesn't get enough power from the USB ports and either cuts out for a second or slows down. </s>
<s> But this is very rare. </s>
<s> So I would advise you to look for this in mice too and make sure you have enough power in your USB ports. </s>
<s> As for its thumb buttons, it has the two for back and forward browser (and great for games too) and I never catch them by accident. </s>
<s> Both buttons are on the same side, where you'd put your thumb. </s>
<s> Unfortunately not very good for left handed people though. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> When I click it clicks, when I don't it doesn't. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for ur replies... Just one more question... Is MX610 good enough for gaming? </s>
<s> I m not a hardcore gamer, I just play games once in a while. </s>
<s> So i want a mouse to work normally as well as good enough in games. </s>
