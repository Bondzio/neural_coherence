hello, i found some information on this forum that helped me identify the cause of a very annoying alarm sounds my pc recently started to make when playing games and running a lot of applications at once.
thank you.
i installed speedfan and find that my gpu lowest temp is 135 degrees f and my cpu lowest temp is 125 degrees f. i cleared some dust out of the vents and am keeping the door open, but the temps won't go down.
the side fan is working fine, and the rear fan seems a bit slow, but it's working.
i can't get to look at the video card fan right now.
any ideas on why my pc is running so hot?
it's driving me nuts!
tia
