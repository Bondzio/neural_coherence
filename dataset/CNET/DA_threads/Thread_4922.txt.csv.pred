1.1.1	Hello .	St
1.1.2	I have an older md S6300NX presario and would like to upgrade the mobo and keep the original hardware that came with it .	St
1.1.3	Any suggestions appreciated .	Polite
1.1.4	Thanx .	St
1.2.1	Since we ca n't reuse the OS we 're out another hundred .	St
1.2.2	The RAM is outdated so no savings there .	St
1.2.3	The hard drive is the now dated IDE so another part lost .	St
1.2.4	Then the power supply is not compatible with today 's boards .	St
1.2.5	Is the case worth saving ?	Ques
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Your trying to salvage an old machine for comfort level , and maybe because of XP and purchased program compatiblity .	St
1.3.2	You do n't really state why you believe you need a new MOBO .	St
1.3.3	Stock config was 512MB PC2700 , 80GB EIDE , 64MB onboard Graphics .	St
1.3.4	You have ( 1 ) AGP and ( 3 ) PCI slots , less whatever is being used .	St
1.3.5	A new ( VGA port ) graphic card ( $ 100 or less ) would help , but may stress your PS .	St
1.3.6	Maxing out memory RAM is costly , at $ 100 for ( 2 ) 1GB PC2700 .	St
1.3.7	( I am trying to find some cheaper for my own , see below , project ) .	St
1.3.8	My reply is predicated upon XP and your purchased programs and data .	St
1.3.9	If the programs can be re-installed into a Win7 machine ( you 'll need to research it ) , then go with a new Win7 machine , and transfer the data .	St
1.3.10	Bob 's correct .	Res
1.3.11	It 's limited .	St
1.3.12	Time to migrate .	St
1.3.13	But , after the migation , re-format and install XP with SP3 .	St
1.3.14	Think of recycling to a senior citizen , or a retirement home .	St
1.3.15	I say that because of what I do locally with other seniors in my community .	St
