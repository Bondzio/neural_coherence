<s> Almost all Windows PCs can't understand a Mac formatted drive. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that the error message is asked about many thousand times so did you read a few prior discussions? </s>

<s> .. </s>
<s> There are too many issues here. </s>
<s> The first is that you'll have the same issue later since Windows can't understand the Apple drive format. </s>
<s> Yes there is software to add this and yes we could boot a Live Linux CD to copy files over but this ignores the biggest issue of them all. </s>
<s> Ready? </s>
<s> The biggest issue is this is not a backup. </s>
<s> It's a copy. </s>
<s> The forums are full of folk that &quot;backed up&quot; onto one lone drive and then something happened. </s>
<s> This is not backup. </s>
<s> I'm going to stop writing and let that sink in and CHANGE THE SUBJECT. </s>
<s> -&gt; OK how would I tackle this without adding an Apple file system driver? </s>
<s> Many ways. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I'd get some USB memory stick to copy files on and then on the Apple copy those to the HDD. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I'd use my DropBox or Google Drive to save files and then on the Apple copy those to the HDD. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i was wondering if i could install windows 8 without losing anything.like in a new drive or something is that possible </s>
<s> Now that we covered the issues of backup we don't need to cover that again. </s>
<s> Windows 8 would cost far more than a memory stick or the DropBox or Google Drive solution but your choice here. </s>
