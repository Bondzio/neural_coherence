1.1.1	Hello, this is my first post on this site so forgive me if I sound stupid but anyway; I have a fairly old pc that i have digged out because its actually more powerful than the cheap pc i am currently using (intergrated gpu).	St
1.1.2	It has an AGP slot and I have a gigabtye 6800 gt graphics card installed.	St
1.1.3	The problem is, its been so long since I've done any tinkering, I've become confused.	St
1.1.4	The card fits into the agp slot now problem.	St
1.1.5	But there is a 4-pin connector on board (the type for hard drives and disk drives, molex I think?).	St
1.1.6	When I opened the case, there was no connector plugged in.	St
1.1.7	Everytime I turn pc on it gives this continuous beeping sound like an alarm.	St
1.1.8	Is this because the graphics card needs the power connector plugged in?	St
1.1.9	I know it sounds silly but I don't want to plug in something wrongly and damage it.	St
1.1.10	When I take the card out, theres no beeping alarm sound.	St
1.1.11	Thanks for any advice and help anyone can give me.	Ques
1.2.1	of the card requires an additional power connection.	St
1.2.2	So find an additional lead from the power supply and plug it in.	St
1.2.3	Then try to turn the computer on again.	St
1.2.4	The beeping sound is called a beep code, so if it still does that, make a note of the sequence, if any, and then report back as to the make and model of this PC.	St
1.2.5	Or you can search for the beep code but you need to know the make and model of the motherboard to start.	St
1.3.1	Hello, thanks for the help.	Polite
1.3.2	At the moment it is just one continuous alarm beep type sound-have also read elsewhere that other people have experienced this and did what you said-hopefully will resolve the issue, i hope so because I don't really have the money to upgrade at the moment and i remember my system running games like far cry, half life 2, doom 3 and call of duty all very well, so gonna plug in the molex and pray for the best!	St
1.3.3	Thanks again.	Polite
