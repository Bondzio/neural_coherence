fan, or the power supply as most prefer.
ps's are not expensive.
if the tower shuts off automatically after using the normal windows shutdown, it is an atx type supply and mobo [system].
if an at type there is a bundle of heavy wires from the power supply to the power switch.
this is the ac power going up to the switch and return as the way an at supply gets turned on.
it's your [your sister's} judgement as to buying a new system.
