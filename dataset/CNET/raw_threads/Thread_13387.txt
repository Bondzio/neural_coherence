I definitely want a powerful sub, but I want a balance between rich bass and crisp trebles. There are so many speakers to chose from that it's mind-baffling. Any suggestions of specific models or brands are extremely appreciated. I don't want to spend a butt-load of money, but I'm open to high-end models. Thanks! Nick

They tend to be more affordable without sacrificing quality, and they win awards and good reviews. I personally game with a 3-year old set of Logitech 5.1's that I bought for $35 and still love
