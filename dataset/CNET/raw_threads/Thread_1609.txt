My thought was to buy an external 2.5&quot; drive and enclosure using USB. I realized that the Dell has SATAII but no port. Can I use an express card with SATA ports to connect with the Dell for data and use an external power supply for power or use a usb connector for power. Any specific hardware suggestions? Will it work? Hard drive suggestions 320gb? Enclosure suggestions? Thanks

This will reduce power demands on the laptops own psu and provide a longer life as such. The added benefit is any USB device will more generically be mobile to other systems vs the eSATA as has limited support for now. The decision is yours to best fit your needs though. tada -----Willy

USB max speed is 480 Mb/s and the sata is 3000 Mb/s. I want to have max speed for I/O operations due to a small but very speedy SSD drive. Most of the separate enclosures with SATA connections also have USP ports for data and/or power. Your point is correct that the USB allows use with other slower computers but this should be available with the box hooked up USB.

If you need(desire) both ports in a ext. case, google for such(USB and eSATA ext. case). When using custom or adapter type situations expect some problems to crop-up one way or another, maybe not in this case though. Like i mentioned before do what best suits ya. tada -----Willy
