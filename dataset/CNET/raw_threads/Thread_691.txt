I need a wall plate with both RJ-45 and COAX Tv in on plate. Just like this except RJ-45 instead of RJ-11. http://www.goodmart.com/products/82084.htm I only see plates with RJ-11 and CAT-TV like in the picutre. Why isn't any plate mate with RJ-45 Ethernet. Singe RJ-45 are made all the time. But nothing I see with RJ-45 and CAT-TV in the same plate. Thanks, Confusimo
