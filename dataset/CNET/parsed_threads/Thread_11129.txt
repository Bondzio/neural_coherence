<s> Hi to everyone! </s>
<s> I would appreciate your advice and time; I have 2 single areas of concern: 1. download/upload Speed 2 Coverage distance/strength I use Win XP (SP3), my home is about 200 msq (600 sqft) and the walls are thin, wooden, paperwalled separators, yet an &quot;n&quot; draft Buffalo Airstation Nifty Giga cannot manage to allow g std laptop operation throught the house. </s>
<s> I want to watch Blueray movies, in full HD, by streaming them wirelessly from my laptop to my HT (through a Digital Media Centre). </s>
<s> Here is my doubt: given certain technical specifications as the &quot;n&quot; standard and the dual band (2.4 and 5 GHz) does it matter which model or brand I buy? </s>
<s> I am not interested in options and accessories as preferential bandwith assign, or USB mass storage sharing or Safety improvements or LCD screens, etc... Only speed and coverage. </s>
<s> Any advice for my next &quot;n&quot; std, dual band, router purchase? </s>
<s> Thank you for any help. </s>

<s> Hi everyone, I just realized that in theory a std should set the specs and therefore all routers should have the same a) download/upload speeds and b) coverage Strength/distance.. </s>
<s> However, antennas, radio RX/TX, maybe even packet management and other matters may differentiate a) & b)... </s>
<s> So, I'm back at having to read all the reviews... Has anyone had to buy an N std, Dual Band Router recently? </s>
<s> Did anyone have to read all the reviews concerning a) & b)? </s>
<s> Can anyone cut my research time and give me the reply? </s>
<s> Thanks to anyone who did the research and is willing to share it. </s>
<s> Ciao, Tommaso </s>
<s> That the FCC limits power emissions in any one direction so all makers are playing from the same rule book. </s>
<s> Good routers tend to all blur into a group of good routers with bad routers finding bad comments so no one router stands out. </s>
<s> This is hard for most to accept. </s>
<s> That is, some think there is a router that will outperform all other routers by say 2 times. </s>
<s> That's untrue yet you find people researching this. </s>
<s> Here I use post 18 of this forum sticky if I need better coverage and it costs so little that maybe that's why many won't do that. </s>

<s> Dear R. Proffitt, Thanks, I imagined as much... Can you pls point me to the 18 post you mention? </s>
<s> I could not find them. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
