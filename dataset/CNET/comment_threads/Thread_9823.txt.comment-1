I have 3 oki color laser printers.
A c3200, a c3400 and a c5500 all color laser printers.
All three are either out of toner or the c3200 needs image drums for yellow, cyan and magenta.
It seems the cost of all the drums or all the toner cartridges would be 2 times the cost of a new printer.
Is my logic wrong or is there a better way to get the consumables to a reasonable cost that is not more than a brand new printer?
It just doesn't seem right that the cost of the image drums are more than the entire cost of a new printer.
PLEASE advise.
