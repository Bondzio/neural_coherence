<s> Hello, What is the fastest way for calculating the power consumption of: PC (with NIC) 17in LCD monitor Router Hub Printer (laser as well as deskjet) Scanner Webcam In brief, I am building a network of 8 to 12 PC for a internet club use and I wish to calculate my monthly power consumption. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Far from scientific, but my method is 100 Watts per big device. </s>
<s> 10 Watts for little things (webcam, scanner.) </s>
<s> The Laset is all over the map from 1000 Watts when printing to some under 10 idle, so the 100 Watt number evens out the numbers. </s>
<s> You can also go to Radio Shack and for under 20 bucks get a AC WattMeter if you want to be accurate, but you may be surprised how close I am. </s>

<s> Hello Bob, Thanx for your humorous but nonetheless serious reply. </s>
<s> I found a site that helps which I share with you (and all who migh come across this issue): http://www.jscustompcs.com/power_supply/ Now, I have another question: Bearing in mind that i am nill in physics, let's say my PC power consumption is 300 watts and it runs for 12 hours daily; What formula do I use to get the 12hrs power consumption? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> At 300 Watts, that's 12 hours or ... 3.6 KiloWatt Hours. </s>
<s> It's simple Watts times hours. </s>
