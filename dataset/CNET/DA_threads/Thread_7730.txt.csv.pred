1.1.1	I want to get a (not too expensive) scanner for scanning in b+w negatives I'm taking for school (and probably color negatives in the future) but also for general scanning in documents etc.	St
1.1.2	Any suggestions?	St
1.1.3	I know I once saw a scanner that was a regular scanner but then had a frame that you put negatives in and put that on the scanner bed, and it would automatically crop and resize all the negatives-is this a common feature or only available in higher price scanners?	St
