My goal is to be able watch HD movies downloaded from a P2P network on the big screen. I was told that the best way to do this is to use a DVI to HDMI cable. I have confirmed that the Samsung 3-330 TV has 2 HDMI ports in the back, but I am having trouble locating a DVI port on the old dell. Is this because the Dell 8250 was created without a DVI port? Is DVI a more recent thing? The Dell was purchased about 5 years ago. Is it even possible to connect an older PC to an LCD TV?

So I am better off just getting a new PC solely for the purpose of watching HD movies off the internet. What type of PC would I be able to buy at a reasonable price that has the capabilities I am looking for? The reason I am doing this is to save money. I have gone through 4 DVD players in a year and they keep breaking, I dont know why. If buying a PC with all the components is going to cost an arm and a leg then that defeats the purpose. If I can find one at a reasonable price than I will still consider it. I bought this LCD TV assuming that it was going to have &quot;amazing quality picture&quot; but it is only slightly better than my other TV I bought over ten years ago. A thousand dollars later, and I still have lower end of technology. Sometimes I just feel like giving up. I have never even downloaded a torrent before. Is this idea even realistic?

Check your local box stores such as Office Depot, they carry them, several other stores do as well. You would be better off to do that than to try to pump up the old unit that you have. Good luck!

There are no hi-def. movies on the internet. What's wrong with the outdoor antenna?

On the box it reads (1.8)-VGA/SUPER VGA MONITOR. On the vable itself it reads 2919 80 degrees 30v Space Shuttle-C Low Voltage Cable. I connected audio via 1/8&quot; STEREO MINIPLUG Audio Cable. The samsung series 3 330 LCD TV says &quot;no signal&quot; when I select input_tv. What could be the problem?
