We have multiple trucks that provide service to this area and must stay connected to the network at all time. To do so, they hop from AP to AP as they drive through the area. We are currently using Cisco PCMCIA network adapter cards with external antennae's on the trucks and they work relatively well. However, we are in the process of upgrading to Panasonic Toughbooks within the trucks which no longer have the PCMCIA slots - so looking for a new internet adapter solution which will hold up to a harsh usage environment, compatible with Motorola wireless infrastructure, has a high power radio, is able to switch from AP to AP timely and efficiently (preferrably with ability to administratively manage the algorithm used to decide when a switch between AP's is made) and is RADIUS friendly. We have looked at TrendNet and Radiolabs USB adapters but have found that their switching algorithm waits until the last possible minute to switch from the current AP to a new AP with packet loss occuring during the transition time as the trucks move down the road. Does anyone have suggestions for an industrial grade network adaptor which may fit the need described above? Thanks in advance...

Get back to Motorola and see what they offer today that fits your installed system. However in the system we developed the system involved a custom data collection app that would verify delivery of the data. Sadly you find systems that tried to rely on just the network. The tales of sorrow and woe are legendary. Bob
