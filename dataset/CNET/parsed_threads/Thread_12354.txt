<s> I got a 1TB Seagate Expansion drive around 3 months ago for my EeePC laptop and it's made soft clicking noises that don't exactly match the ones on datacent.com. </s>
<s> The ones on mine are way softer and can't be heard over an electric fan on full blast. </s>
<s> (Then again, my hearing's never been the best.) </s>
<s> I take generally good care of the hard drive (haven't dropped it, always have handled it with care), though I have tripped over the cord connecting it to the electric socket several times. </s>
<s> My room's stuffy, though, just in case that turns out to be important. </s>
<s> As this probably means trouble, I've decided to just buy another hard drive. </s>
<s> (I'm a first-time user, so I don't feel like I want to touch another Seagate hard drive with a ten-foot pole now. </s>
<s> Am I being too much?) </s>
<s> Any good ones out there (preferably 1TB)? </s>
<s> What brands would you recommend? </s>
<s> I'm a no-frills kind of person, so I'll be happy with simple functional storage space without any fancy features. </s>
<s> Also, I'm thinking of switching to Linux (XP user here) maybe in a few months or so, so I'd prefer something that's Linux-compatible too, if that's possible. </s>
<s> One of the new features of hard drives that produce a soft clicking is the drive performing a surface scan on its own. </s>
<s> This is proving to upset owners today. </s>
<s> And all the makers are implementing it. </s>
<s> I fear that another drive could do the same. </s>
<s> You can research this if you like but I am on travel so have to keep it short. </s>

<s> You google away and find the results are few for many ext. </s>
<s> HDs out there of the actual HD installed. </s>
<s> The makers of HDs are Seagate(owns Maxtor), WD, Samsung and Hitachi and that's it. </s>
<s> I exclude any laptop installs or such. </s>
<s> You can try to search for a different brand but the installed HD will be one of the above. </s>
<s> NOPE! </s>
<s> any movement of the HD while on is a negative action, regardless of past use history. </s>
<s> Often enough, IMHO heat is the main cuplrit of damaging ext. </s>
<s> HDs as they usually don't have active(real good) heat dissipation other than thermo-ally metal(HD case) and whatever ext. </s>
<s> case suited for this task. </s>
<s> In other words, no fan or huge heat sinks. </s>
<s> Also, USB ext. </s>
<s> HDs getting power from USB port can tax that USB current output and can cause damage as it hits the limits but to each PC is different. </s>
<s> Next, the AC powered ext. </s>
<s> cases are prone to what the outside world has to offer. </s>
<s> Any sags or surges of AC current will more directly effect the ext. </s>
<s> HD as usually no protection is provided. </s>
<s> Last, just because you turn PC-OFF doesn't mean you turn ext. </s>
<s> HD off when AC powered. </s>
<s> it sits there powered-ON, maybe idle but cooks under its own heat build-up. </s>
<s> Psssst, my cat sits on mine, I have to shoo it away. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> &quot;automatic off-line read scan to monitor additional operations.&quot; This is noted about today's hard drives. </s>
<s> This read scan is causing some folk to think the drive has a defect. </s>
