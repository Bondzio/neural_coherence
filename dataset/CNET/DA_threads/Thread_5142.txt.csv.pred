1.1.2	It is connected to an HP deskjet 932C printer.	St

1.1.4	I uninstalled and then reinstalled the printer.	St
1.1.5	I used the toolbox to clean the cartridges and recalibrate the printer.	St
1.1.6	Since this has happened with two cartridges, bought at separate times, I don't think it's a cartridge problem.	St
1.1.7	I have also cleaned the surfaces around the cartridge with a damp rag.	St
1.1.8	Nothing has worked thus far.	St
1.1.9	Any suggestions would be most appreciated.	St

1.3.1	Have the same situation on an HP 952C printer, magenta and black prints, nothing else.	St

1.4.1	I have the same problem on a hp 7755 - no yellow.	St
1.4.2	I have just changed the printer & cartridge and STILL have the problem !	St
1.4.3	I reckon it must be the power supply as it's the only remaining common item.	St
1.4.4	I'm trying to source another one.	St
1.5.1	Try downloading the drivers for your printer off the HP site according to your OS.	St
1.5.2	If you use a Windows 98 driver for your Windows XP it may not function correctly.	St
1.6.1	I do suggest using a soft toothbrush and some alcohol, dip brush and gingerly brush the carriage contact area.	St
1.6.2	Wipe with a clean cloth or shop towel, leave no towel residue, repeat 2-3 times, allow to dry.	St
1.6.3	return ink cart, but you should wipe ink cart contacts as well.	St
1.6.4	test and check results.	Sug
1.6.5	best done with new ink cart.	St
1.6.6	If results are the same, possible bad carraige cable harness or electronics on logic(rare), in eiither case, the repair cost if no warranty will suggest buy new printer.	St
1.6.7	I thought any s/w issues if the test pattern HP uses fails.	St
