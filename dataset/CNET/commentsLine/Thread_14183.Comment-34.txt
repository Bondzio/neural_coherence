i worked at the depot here in ohio.
many a componet or device was sent back for repairs/rebuild.
the logic modules on devices were before ics became common, descrete componets and i replaced many a &quot;top hat&quot; xsister.
fixed many a &quot;decoder&quot; for the teller machine for banks.
did you use any &quot;marvel mystery oil&quot; as some techs did to help keep the solenoids from freezing and thus not change a decoder.
i cut my fingers on those dang steel bands!!!
an old bench tech taught me the quick and easy way to replace and bother it made a difference.
saw the 1st tape cart drives, plessley drives, cermanic drives, huge printers, huge hds, heck the compressor alone was good for home projects.
thanks for the trip back... -----willy
