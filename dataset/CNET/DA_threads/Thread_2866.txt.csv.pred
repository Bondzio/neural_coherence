1.1.1	I use adobe cs2 alot .	St
1.1.2	I have a core 2 @ 2.66 and 3 gigs of ram on an EVGA 680i on vista 32 bit .	St
1.1.3	I want to upgrage vista to 64 bit ultimate and bring the total memory up to 8 gigs .	St
1.1.4	The question is , if i wait for quad core penryns to be available at a reasonable price ( hopefully january ? )	Ques
1.1.5	and get a nice x38 mainboard will using ddr2 800 slow me down much ?	Ques
1.1.6	Should i break the bank and get 1066 ?	Ques
1.1.7	thanks for the help .	Polite
1.2.1	Most applications have memory limits of about 2GB unless they are 64-bit specific .	St
1.2.2	Microsoft wrote about the /3G switch and in that article noted a special compiler switch .	St
1.2.3	To wit , if you are going out there be sure the apps will go with you .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	from what i 've head photoshop can use 3.5 gigs and whatever is left after that it uses as a page file .	St
1.3.2	Also i like to leave in design and other apps open while i work .	St
1.3.3	So having 8 gigs would be nice .	St
1.3.4	everything would always have as much ram as it wanted .	St
1.4.1	As is , the limit is 3.0G ( according the Microsoft 's docs . )	St
1.4.2	But I 'm not going to argue with you but note that another has done this and they were PISSED at the results .	St
1.4.3	They ended up with a 64 bit Windows which was a royal pain to find all the drivers , they choice of antivirus , firewalls were not available in 64 bit and it was slower than they former Core 2 Duo with 2GB RAM .	St
1.4.4	So thousands later it was slower ( in CS2 . )	St
1.4.5	Other things were slamming ( a good thing ) such as video work .	St
1.4.6	Just trying to help you avoid a repeat .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	guess i will have to think about this alot more .	St
1.5.2	Thanks Bob .	St
1.6.1	I was livid when I found out that my Microsoft One-Care was incompatible with Vista 64-bit .	St
1.6.2	Frankly , I think you 'd be alright with no virus protection at all ... oddly enough , 64-bit Vista is kind of virus free .	St
1.6.3	32-bit viruses ca n't infect 64-bit systems .	St
1.6.4	But anyhow , get one of the compatible AV software and do n't let that deter you .	St
1.6.5	Note that G-Skill has an incredible dual on DD2-1000 RAM , just $ 20 more per each 4GB than the 800 stuff .	St
1.6.6	If I read you right , you want to get 8GB of RAM to last you to 2009 ... very good idea , I may borrow it .	St
1.6.7	$ 250.00 for 8GB of great RAM is an outrageously good deal , there 's just no other way to look at it .	St
1.6.8	You are right , at the very worst , each application will use up 2GB of RAM for themselves , but when you combine a bunch of 32-bit appls overall you can totally make full use of the 8GB .	St
1.6.9	I honestly do n't see why go Vista and not go 64-bit .	St
1.6.10	Drivers have n't been a big deal for me at all , and I seriously doubt that your new motherboard would have any problems .	St
1.6.11	Vista 64-bit is n't exactly an underground movement ... hardware vendors are fully aware that they need to provide support for it .	St
1.6.12	Your mileage may vary , but I think it 's a great idea to buy 8GB and Vista 64-bit .	St
1.6.13	I 'm surprised that this is n't a more widely discussed scenario .	St
1.6.14	I really wonder what the effect would be .	St
1.6.15	It 's not a really pricey adventure .	St
1.6.16	I wonder if it would go a long way to & quot ; fix Vista & quot ; to have that much memory .	St
