<s> I need some advice .... What would be a good/high quality internal HD for my iBook? </s>
<s> I'd like to spend around $100-150, and want to have something that is higher quality, very reliable, and fast! </s>
<s> Don't need a huge HD, maybe 120 GB max. </s>
<s> I'm more concerned with the quality than the size. </s>
<s> My computer is an iBook G4 (purchased June 2004), running OS X 10.4.11. </s>
<s> I'm also adding a one GB stick of RAM. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> macsales.com for decent prices on internal drives for you machine. </s>
<s> They also guarantee that they will work in your particular machine.. Worth a visit P </s>
<s> My uncle recommended a smaller HD. </s>
<s> He said they last longer. </s>
<s> So I think I'll go with an 80GB HD. </s>
<s> Still trying to decide which one .... </s>
<s> theory that smaller drives last longer? </s>
<s> That has not been my experience. </s>
<s> That said, could his theory be based on older hard drives, back in the day, that seemed to last forever, or at least longer than the actual computer? </s>
<s> Those drives were only 2, 4, 8 GB. </s>
<s> If 80GB is going to do for you, go for it P </s>
<s> I've had bad experiences with Samsung and Hitachi HDs. </s>
<s> I can recommend Seagate and Western Digital if possible. </s>
<s> Your iBook is not SATA so take care about that. </s>
<s> I believe it's IDE. </s>
