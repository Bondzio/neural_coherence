your questions on hdd size & screw holes have been answered.
re your usb keyboard, since you can't use it to access the bios setup you'll have to get a ps/2 keyboard to do so.
i noticed in my bios there is an option to enable legacy usb support.
but that may not mean that the usb keyboard will let you access the bios setup.
unfortunately i do not use a usb kb so i cannot test it.
on switching to ntfs in bios setup...this is not the way it's done.
you can boot into xp and use disk management to format the 120gb to ntfs.
if there is data on it, don't format but use the conversion tool to convert the volume to ntfs.
see this link:  or open the help & support center and research convert to ntfs.
