1.1.1	I am booting XP Pro from a Maxtor SATA on an Abit AN7 (onboard sata controller - Silicon Image SiI3112) and I am experiencing very slow HDD writes.	St
1.1.2	It used to be over 40 MB/s but since a while (I don't remember since when) it is around 5 MB/s.	St
1.1.3	It writes ok for about 1 sec.	Polite
1.1.4	(untill the buffer is full) than it drops instantly.	St
1.1.5	I reinstalled XP, updated the bios, ran the diagnostic tools from maxtor, everithing was fine... where else should I look?	St
1.2.1	It's a XP thing.	St
1.2.2	Read http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=7297&messageID=85244 for a note and a link how to.	St
1.2.3	Cheers, Bob	Polite
