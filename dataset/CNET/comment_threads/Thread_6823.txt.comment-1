My Deskjet 3650 won't print.
It keeps blinking.
It says remove right cartridge and if it still blinks cartridge in side might be broken.
I called HP they said out of warentee.
I don't remember any cartridge inside the machine besides the 2 ink ones (color and black).
What cartridge could they mean.
