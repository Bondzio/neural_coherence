most video editing software is extremely dependent on cpu and ram.
i'm not sure which way to go on the ram question - i personally haven't put a lot of stock in ram speed differences.
i use an amd athlon 64 cpu and pc 2700 ddr ram (1.5gb) running avid xpress pro editing software.
i have basically no problems with rendering, layers, etc.
i also am running (internal) ata/ide drives and connecting both usb and firewire external drives.
access of the externals is sometimes a little slow, but not enough to affect the editing performance.
the video card requirements depend on the software requirements.
for example, avid - and many other high end programs don't require more than about a 64mb video card in most cases.
i run an nvidia 128mb card in my system.
i've been told not to waste my money on a high end/high ram capacity video card for editing - the current softwares won't use most of the onboard video ram anyway.
