<s> In the future I will upgrade the whole computer. </s>
<s> I will reuse the power supply and disc drives. </s>
<s> What new MSI mother board is a good choice? </s>
<s> It's possible that you cannot find an equivalent replacement in retail stores. </s>
<s> Your ATI video card is probably AGP and your RAM is an older DDR type. </s>
<s> If your HD(s) and CD ROM are ATA/Atapi you'll find newer boards favor SATA and will provide limited connection for older drives. </s>
<s> I'd say that if your MB is 3 years or older, you'd be looking for a used replacement. </s>
<s> Perhaps a local computer builder could help you providing an old board from a PC that was traded in or such. </s>
<s> But you could give EBay a try if you decide on what to buy. </s>
<s> There is a possibility of finding older equipment there but still usable. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The model number is MS-6758. </s>
<s> Its a 2003 model. </s>
<s> Since, you now know the MSI model#, visit the MSI support website. </s>
<s> There locate your model# to determine the specs of your mtrbd.. You can decide what if anything can be saved or xfered to another mtrbd. </s>
<s> and/or be upgraded to yet a newer and better class mtrbd.. Circa 2003 seems to be too old to keep the ram and cpu as mtrbds. </s>
<s> have progressed. </s>
<s> In this light pick one, it need not be MSI but should be should be adaptable for the latest cpu and ram now available to keep current for some time. </s>
<s> Since, you have a custom system, it shouldn't be too hard to go forward. </s>
<s> Though, I suggest you look into &quot;dual-core or multiple core cpu&quot; for best outcome of a typical system now. </s>
<s> If you like check eBay for older and/or used system if you want to keep within the level you're now at determined by the specs you find. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> If the latter...here's one option. </s>
