open your system preferences (either from the pull-down menu under the apple icon in the far upper-left or from your dock), then under hardware there is a &quot;cd&dvd&quot; button.
click that, then you can choose what you want your computer to do when you insert a disc.
it may have &quot;ignore&quot; chosen as the default.
you can choose any application you want to open (like dvd player) or to have the disc icon just show up n the finder when you insert it.
