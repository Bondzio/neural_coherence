<s> Im just recently learning about processors. </s>
<s> I currently have a dual-core with 1 GB of DDR2 RAM and 250GB HDD. </s>
<s> I wanted to buy a new quad processor because I really dont need a computer that is really powerful but i came across this deal for a 6-core processor with 8GB DDR3 RAM and 1TB HDD for $350. </s>
<s> To buy a new computer with a quad core would prolly be $500+ so is this deal good or does it just look good? </s>
<s> My dual-core has lasted me 6 years so i just want kno if i get this 6-core it will last me a long time. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would help. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
