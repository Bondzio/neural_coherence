to check if you are into the &quot;danger zone&quot; of your hdd you must be refer to the tech specs.
of the manifacturer for that model.
you will find a value called mtbf expressed in hours.
if the on time of your hdd is around that value be very carefull on its use.
i've seen perfectly running hdd to die in seconds for a failure.
running the disk into perfect condition of temperature and without mechanical stress increases its life!
