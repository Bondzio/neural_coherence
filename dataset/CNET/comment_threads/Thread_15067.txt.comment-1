Alright so we just bought a new Belkin N Router.
The only way for my computer to be connected is for it to be wirelessly connected.
But the wireless adapter I have isn't detecting the network.
I've got a D-Link G usb adapter.
Is there any way to make the wireless adapter G adapter compatible with my N Router?
I've also got a Belkin G wireless adapter, is there any way to make that compatible as well?
