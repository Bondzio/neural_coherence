<s> Are there 2 categories of hard drives, one is Advanced Format, the other Traditional Format? </s>
<s> But the spec sheet did not tell us these are the new 4K sectors. </s>
<s> You may have to ask WD. </s>
<s> Why do you ask? </s>
<s> I've used both types and the only time I see an issue is on outdated OSes. </s>

<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822236338 See the feedback on the fifth row. </s>
<s> Depends on the seller(not always) to provide that when the &quot;maker&quot; usually does. </s>
<s> What a seller may provide is a link to specs or maker's own support. </s>
<s> There is only so much room for info and most sellers provide the basics. </s>
<s> If you ever want a specific need or want direct data, then go to the source, the maker. </s>
<s> AND yeah sometimes it doesn't make sense to the uninformed or those lacking knowledge on the latest developments until MUCH later explained in common lingo. </s>
<s> Which is why those users that are on the cutting edge, get cut. </s>
<s> Even I as an informed tech and such, get hosed because so much is being tossed out there. </s>
<s> Even with notes, memos, phone calls, or links, etc., no one can know what's what until handled in practical terms. </s>
<s> http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/SpecSheet/ENG/2879-701277.pdf http://www.wdc.com/global/products/features/?id=7&language=1 Please explain your circumstances why all this is an issue. </s>
<s> Let's hope this isn't an OS(XP) issue overall. </s>
<s> But heck, one link I provide shows you can use an AF pgm. </s>
<s> to get what maybe what you're looking for that product. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> From the data sheet. </s>
<s> So 750,000,000,000 divided by 1,465,149,168 should be our clue. </s>
<s> I get a number close to 512. </s>
<s> What do you get? </s>
<s> Good question but since the spec sheet lets us figure it out, should we expect folk to know how to do this if they are in this deep with PCs? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I read an article online the day before that the earlier AF drives are needed an Align software, but the latest ones are automatically aligned. </s>
<s> Few months ago, I installed XP to a 6G/s 2T drive which I did not know it is an AF drive then, but somehow, It has not caused any problem so far. </s>
<s> I just didn't know why the non-AF drives can be AF formatted but not vise versa. </s>
<s> I don't want to upset you but by post was so you could figure it out given the existing documents. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If an AF drive is formatted/partitioned in Windows Vista, 7, or 2008, is it still need to align? </s>
<s> In this case, is it compatible with windows XP? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> At first it was a big deal. </s>
<s> Today I rarely see anyone fret about it. </s>
<s> To the second question, no. </s>
<s> Not really. </s>
<s> XP has an 127GB install limit and no SATA support and I found that I could not use the SATA drivers unless I had XP SP2 CDs. </s>
<s> So if we take your question as-is, the answer is no. </s>
