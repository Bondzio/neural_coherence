1.1.1	I will be buying logitech z -2300 speakers for my computer.Plz suggest an appropriate sound card for my computer.Or do you i think i am better off using the onboard soundcard???	St
1.1.2	?	Ques
1.2.1	on-board sound will work but remember it uses the cpu to produce sound.	St
1.2.2	i suggest a sound card to avoid stealing cpu power.	St
1.2.3	creative labs is by far the most popular sound card out there but... there have been some reports of driver issues, my own pc suffers and there is no fix available.	St
1.2.4	so unless you have extra-ordinary hearing i suggest one of turtle beaches offerings.	St
1.2.5	these are available just about everywhere and you can even save a few bucks to boot.	St
1.2.6	m-audio also make a good card but they start at about $100	St
1.3.1	if your PC has high-definition (HD) audio, then its built-in audio is as good as an inexpensive ($15) sound card.	St
1.3.2	here's a simple test.	St
1.3.3	buy your speakers, plug them into your portable cd or mp3 player, and listen to a few songs.	Sug
1.3.4	now plug them into your pc, and listen to the same songs.	St
1.3.5	if the pc sounds 'hissy' or 'buzzy' compared to your cd/mp3 player, get a new sound card.	St
1.3.6	if you can't tell (or don't mind) the difference, stick with your on-board sound.	St
1.3.7	if you do choose to get a sound card, the creative audigy 4 is $80 retail and the diamond xtreme with dolby digital live is about $60 retail.	St
1.3.8	some walmarts have the sound blaster live external for about $50.	St
1.3.9	to me, the best cheap upgrade for on-board sound is the good ol' sound blaster live!	St
1.3.10	you can get it at geeks.com for about $30.	St
1.3.11	most sound cards include a bunch of crap/unneeded software.	St
1.3.12	when installing, just select the bare minimum necessary to avoid many of the driver/software headaches that often follow sound cards.	St
