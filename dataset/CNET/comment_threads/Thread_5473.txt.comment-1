Hey everybody I'm a newbie on these forums.
I was on cnet live today.
They directed me here.
I called in asking about wanting to build a system now with one hard drive, but later as my budget allows add additional hard drives in a raid array.
The only way I know how to do this is to reinstall the OS and start from scratch.
Is there a way to streamline this process so I can add drives and not lose my data or rebuild the array every time?
