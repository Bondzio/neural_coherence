<s> I am currently have and am using a Free Agent Desk 500GB External Hard drive with a speed of 7200. </s>
<s> I was thinking of purchasing the WD My Passport Hard Drive 250GB which is only $29.99 at Target and was wondering how reliable they are compared to the Free Agent drives. </s>
<s> I know that it's has a slower speed but I like the fact that it's USB powered vice A/C/ and is extremely small. </s>
<s> I'm just going to be using this as a backup for my MP3 files. </s>
<s> Also, if someone knows of another good USB powered hard drive please let me know. </s>
<s> They are OK and quite a good idea as a backup copy (but never as &quot;storage&quot;) </s>
<s> Thanks again for the reply! </s>
