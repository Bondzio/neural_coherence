<s> I made the mistake of choosing to try Zone Alarm Pro when I recently got an automatic update of the program, which I'd been using for quite some time. </s>
<s> When the trial period expired, I decided to go back to the freebie version. </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure the prompts said it would remember all the settings. </s>
<s> It did not. </s>
<s> Each internet-related program had to be re-allowed as I launched them. </s>
<s> No problem there. </s>
<s> However... Networking is another thing. </s>
<s> I've never been real savvy with networking. </s>
<s> I have 3 other computers on my home network, and they can no longer access my main desktop (the one I've re-installed Zone Alarm on.) </s>
<s> I can't for the life of me remember how to configure ZA and add a local network to the trusted zone. </s>
<s> I can see where that is done in the program, and I can see how to add an individual IP address, and a range of IP addresses, and a subnet and all that...but I don't remember how the local network was entered. </s>
<s> Is it a &quot;range of IP addresses,&quot; or is it a &quot;subnet&quot;...and where do I find the data to enter into the appropriate spaces? </s>
<s> I've done searches on the internet, but come up with little help. </s>
<s> Evidently I did this at one point, because I've had this network in place and running for quite some time. </s>
<s> I am using a Linksys wireless ap/router (physically connected to this computer) for my home network. </s>
<s> Thanks, Rag </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> Did that. </s>
<s> Didn't help. </s>
<s> I thought it would detect my network, but it didn't. </s>
<s> If it's installed, I find no end of grief when the network isn't working. </s>
<s> You'll have to reveal if the DHCP address is valid. </s>
<s> If it's 192.168, then you can reveal the details here since that's a non-public IP... Bob </s>
<s> See, it's just that kind of talk (reveal if the DHCP address is valid) that makes me feel like an idiot! </s>
<s> I can only tell you at this point that if I open look at the ZA &quot;zones&quot; on the other three computers (yes, I have it installed on all of the systems) there is an &quot;adapter subnet&quot; that does, indeed, start with 192.168 They seem to be associated with the wireless adapters on those computers. </s>
<s> On the &quot;main&quot; computer (the desktop I have re-installed ZA on, and which is the one that is actually connected physically to the Linksys) there is a listing for a Realtec Fast ethernet NIC. </s>
<s> (Could this be the built-in Ethernet adapter?) </s>
<s> Sorry I am such a dummy when it comes to networking stuff. </s>
<s> I can't tell from your post if the IP is valid. </s>
<s> Seem close, but you didn't reveal the rest of the numbers. </s>
<s> Netmask, and more. </s>
<s> It's not a public IP so there are no jewels at risk. </s>
<s> Another nugget to get network sharing to work is that the firewalls of XP are &quot;off&quot; and that the WORKGROUP names are the same. </s>
<s> If you can't share, I have to leave you to read http://www.wown.com and http://www.practicallynetworked.com It's also very important that Zone Alarm be uninstalled or again, I can't help... Bob </s>
<s> These are all items I see in Zone Alarm, under the Firewall heading, in the Zones tab. </s>
<s> And, yes, Zone alarm has since been uninstalled from the main desktop. </s>
<s> That is the PC on which I had changed the installation of the program and which is physically connected to the Linksys AP\Router. </s>
<s> One other Desktop on the network is physically connected via ethernet cable to the router. </s>
<s> The other two are notebooks and they are networked via WiFi wireless. </s>
<s> On main desktop is only one entry, as follows: Name: Realtek RTL 8139 Family PCI Fast Ethernet NIC - packet scheduler miniport IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.100/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Internet ----------------------------------- On the other Desktop are two entries: Name: SMC1211 Series NDIS 5.1 Driver IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.108/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted Name: PPP Adapter IP Address/Site: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted ---------------------------------- On Notebook 1, two entries: Name: Instant Wireless Network PC Card V3.0 IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.106/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted Name: PPP Adapter IP Address/Site: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted ---------------------------------- On Notebook 2, two entries Name: Broadcom 440x 10/100 Integrated Controller - Packet Scheduler Miniport IP Address/Site: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Internet Name: WLAN 802.11g Network Adapter - Packet Scheduler Miniport IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.102/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted Thanks, Rag </s>
<s> But as long as Zone Alarm is installed anywhere, I wouldn't write it should work. </s>
<s> Here's the reason. </s>
<s> You have a firewall of sorts in the router. </s>
<s> For now, you can toss Zone Alarm out until the network is back up and working. </s>
<s> If you don't then that's your choice. </s>
