visit some gamer websites.
they provide hot news plus what has worked or seems to.
you can also visit some of the popular gamer building websites as well, at least you get a look at the specs.
you can then build what makes you happy.
my advice, get a big frigging case with plenty of gamer type accessories(fans, bottom psu), hulking name brand psu(suggest pc power and cooling) and best cpu and gpu(or gpus) available.
if you can do all that for $20, call me.
why, because you want all that on the cheap, i'm sure.
