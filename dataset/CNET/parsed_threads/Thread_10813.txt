<s> My software talks to RS232 on industrial controllers. </s>
<s> Yes, I wrote it, I can port it but there is no other choice when it comes to talking to hardware than good old RS232. </s>
<s> I don't see an Apple USB to RS232 device. </s>
<s> Do you know of such? </s>
<s> And does it work in Parallels or Vmware's Fusion? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> It still needs someone to try it in Parallels or Vmware's fusion. </s>
