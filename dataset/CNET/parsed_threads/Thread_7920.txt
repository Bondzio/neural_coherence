<s> Hi All, My cousin and I want to establish a VLAN of sorts over the internet to collaborate over files and applications installed in each other's laptop. </s>
<s> What would be the easiest and cheapest way to go about doing this? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> And with many offerings of &quot;your own cloud&quot; why not that since I find most folk that ask this blow apart and any VPN VLAN setup. </s>
<s> Most get really upset you can't do it with just a router. </s>

<s> Hi, You can use Team-viewer for file sharing and screen sharing otherwise to make a VPN either you have to buy dyndns services for connection of VPN if you are planning on using dynamic IP's or else you need to request static IP from your respective ISP's and then creating a VPN using network setup wizard from your PC windows. </s>
<s> VLAN however is entirely a different scope. </s>
<s> Regards David </s>
