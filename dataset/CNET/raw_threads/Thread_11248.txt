While some recent games like &quot;Plants vs. Zombies&quot; don't tax such a machine anything richer will not be happy. All the corners have been cut on CPU, GPU, RAM so let's just say that's not a gamer machine. Upgrading could cost as much as a Xbox 360. Bob

You will be able to play web games just fine, but you won't really be able to play any offline games that one would care about at this point in time (except maybe StarCraft or Warcraft III). As said, buying an Xbox 360 would probably be easier and cheaper. What games were you planning to play on this?

So a 7300 wouldn't probably be even able to play it. As has already been said, it would be cheaper to buy a xbox 360 if your wanting to play all the new games. You could get away with upgrading the RAM and buying a cheaper graphics card, all for maybe around $180. But you still won't play the newest games all that well.
