<s> I did a fresh windows 7 installation on one of my PCs on the network. </s>
<s> The problem now is I cannot ping that computer from any other computer on the network. </s>
<s> I can ping the gateway and other computers from that specific computer, but not vice versa. </s>
<s> The PC s ip address is 10.5.3.100 If I ping it from another machine it says reply from 10.5.3.108 Destination host unreachable I have noticed that it is even replying from a different ip address Help </s>
<s> in that IP address range? </s>
<s> Did you change it? </s>
<s> Have you checked the cable connected from your pc to another? </s>
<s> I think this problem is because of cable or some wrong IP address. </s>
<s> on the network? </s>
<s> That message suggests there is no path to the problem computer. </s>
