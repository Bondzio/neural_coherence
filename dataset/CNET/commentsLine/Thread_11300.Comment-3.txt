thanks bob, went to &quot;canon&quot;, found drivers right away.
about a month ago, typed in &quot;canoscan drivers&quot; on google and was unable to find right drivers.
got it now, and scanner works, thanks a lot.
ben btw bob, appreciate all the help you gave when i was having xp problems.
fortunately the reformat and reinstall of xp was flawless.
(it didn't even ask to put previous win disk) had xp up and running in 55 minutes.
the hard part is getting other stuff back, scanner was last item to redo.
not been in any big rush.
