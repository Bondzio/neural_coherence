you need both routers running on the same subnet (192.168.0.xxx).
this is required for your computer to be able to talk to the router with internet access.
i have a set up with two d-link routers, but i have set up d-link and linksys routers on the same network before, any combination should be possible.
to set them up right, you will need to disable dhcp on the router that is not connected directly to the dsl, and make sure that the ip addresses on the routers do not conflict.
ie, one should be 192.168.0.1, the next 192.168.0.2. let me know if this helps.
