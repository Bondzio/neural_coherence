i appreciate your input.
yes, it's largely personal preference.
again though, i'm looking for suggestions on something with quieter keystrokes, keys that don't need so much pressure to be activated, and finally; wondering if the technology (since i got the model i currently use) is really much improved.
i've seen pretty positive comments about the logitech cordless desktop wave pro....but mixed on how noisy it is.
also can't determine if it's really much of an upgrade from my current keyboard.
thanks in advance for any additional thoughts/advice.
