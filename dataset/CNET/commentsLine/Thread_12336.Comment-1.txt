just got this as a gift from my employers.
64mb flash drive!
(yay).
now, what can i do with this?
currently i'm thinking a few options: 1) make it a bootable drive for emergency rescue operations.
but, which os / distro?
is there an os that can fit within 64mb?
2) install windows portable apps on it.
thinking of abiword for sure, what other useful apps you think can fit on it?
