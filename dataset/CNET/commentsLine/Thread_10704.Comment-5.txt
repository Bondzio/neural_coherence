just need a topic... such old drives may have odd (to today's users) jumper methods.
some drives had a slave present jumper.
but without exacting details i can't guess you missed the jumpers or what type ide cable you used.
then again, the 2gb drive could be dead.
it is certainly past the 5 year mark.
