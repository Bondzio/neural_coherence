i'm no expert however, i suffered similar problems in that my comp, without warning, would switch itself off completely and then restart and boot to the welcome screen as if nothing had happened.
i persevered for around three months until i could take it no more.
i checked all my wiring connections inside my comp to start - no probs there!
i did a virus scan - no probs there!
i changed my ram - still had the problem.
then i changed my psu from a fsp 250-60 gta (250w) to a jeantech 400w (30 from pc world) - problem cured!!!
since changing the psu (it has been running for around two months now) i have not experienced any more unexplained shutdowns.
i hope this helps.
regards daz
