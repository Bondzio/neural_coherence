I got this computer off ebay.
Since I got it I have not been able to get a sound out of it.
When I look in device manager it shows me an unknown PCI device, and of course I have no drivers forit.
When I download the sound drivers off the compaq website supposedly for the computer I have, no luck no sound.
I tried diabling the on-board sound and putting in my own sound card, but that hasn't worked either.
Any other things I can try?
