<s> I was sad becasue It was like I had 2 hard drive failers within 2 months .... </s>
<s> I WAS WONDERING THOUGH ... is this from me transfering files from my failing HARD DRIVE VAIO (like mp3s and pix) to my Windows VISTA XPS420 ... did I bring a virus over that killed my next systems HARD DRIVE? </s>
<s> is that possible .... DELL nicely said they send me a NEW ONE .. but SHOULD I NOT move my old files tomy new computer or is the just a kawink-e-dink! </s>
<s> ha THNX, ,,,, much HELP/advise wanted </s>
<s> Windows doesn't work with failing hardware well. </s>
<s> So you need to FOLLOW DIRECTIONS. </s>
<s> I see it told you to backup your files but it appears you didn't do that. </s>
<s> Instead you delayed and now are moving the failing drive to a new machine and complaining that Windows doesn't like failing drives. </s>
<s> GO AHEAD and complain about that. </s>
<s> When you are done you'll want to try going back to what did boot and work to get your files out. </s>

<s> There's no telling by what you did. </s>
<s> You should backup, then xfer files, them check for any malware. </s>
<s> In fact, you should had checked for malware before xferring any files. </s>
<s> It's possible to cause problems by xferring some malware as it attack continues, but normally, it should have been more obivous. </s>
<s> If you have a true h/w fault, then getting problems now by xfering files is nil but again I don't know what total files they were. </s>
<s> Dell, has a know issue with losing HDs under Vista, check thier support website for details and/or check the forums of theirs. </s>
<s> Run some anti-virus tests or use the free online services check here at virus&security forum for links to same. </s>
<s> good luck ------Willy </s>
<s> No No No I Didnt move my DRIVE I was backing up my old data just to a new computer by using the DATA TRANSFER THING in vista ... </s>
<s> I was saying that could my new HD failed beacuse I brought a virus over from my old computer ... so I most likely shouldnt tranfer my files or If I do use a SCAN on em ... </s>
<s> I wouldn't discount anything. </s>
<s> Let's look at a recent disaster. </s>
<s> The owner was a P2P user downloading cracked software. </s>
<s> They had no end of troubles on all their machines. </s>
<s> Frankly I think they should get a Mac since this may be the only cure for them since they are convinced Windows is buggy as ell. </s>
<s> They can't see the cracks for what they are. </s>
<s> Their last comment was that Norton (yet another cracked software!) </s>
<s> should have protected them. </s>
<s> The protection starts with us. </s>
<s> No, I'm not saying you have such an issue but thinking that Norton or other software will stop today's pests is wishful thinking. </s>
