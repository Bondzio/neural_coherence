I'm looking at getting a Core i7 920 and I wondering if anybody has already purchased one and if they could tell how well the stock heatsink/fan work. I've heard that they are terrible, so I am just wondering.

If you plan to &quot;overclock&quot; then consider a higher rated or suitable replaceable fan that's rated for such use. In most cases, just trust the supplied fan that came with the cpu. tada -----Willy
