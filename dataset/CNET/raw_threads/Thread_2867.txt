The laptop bit the dust (motherboard issue), so I removed the hard drive from the laptop, and now have it in an external (USB 2) enclosure. When I jack the old drive into the USB 2 port on my desktop, it recognizes that the drive is attached. Everything looks good in Device Manager. As seems to be everyone's problem, it does not show up in My Computer. The volume is showing as Disk 5 under Disk Management, layout is partition, type is basic, file system is NTFS (same as the root drive), and the status shows Healthy (Active). It is not assigned a drive letter, and the only activity available to me is to delete the partition. I am trying to access the drive to recover the data, so I'd like to avoid reformatting (for obvious reasons). The desktop is a VAOI RB42G running XP with Media Center. The laptop was running Win2k. Any insight would be appreciated.

Forgive me fo not being a Linux user, but I cannot transfer the data between drives. I believe it because I do not have write privileges. I've tried changing up permissions, but I do not know the root password. Are you aware of a default? Thanks for the help to date.

I'm booting off of the DVD burner drive, so that doesn't work as an option either. Further thoughts? Thanks, Shawn

An USB memory key, USB hard disk in FAT32 format or USB CDRW drive or go across a network to backup in that situation. The KNOPPIX confirms the files are still there. Can I ask if you partitioned it with Partition Magic? It seems to be a source of this issue. Bob
