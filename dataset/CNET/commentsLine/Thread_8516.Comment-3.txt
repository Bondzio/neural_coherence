well!
my flash drive of 2gb stopped writing at under 1gb and i got the usual write protected message and tried a number of things on the internet.
in the end i started the pc in safe mode and right clicked the drive to format it.
it started but then near the end came up with a cannot complete this action message.
having restarted the pc normally i right clicked the drive again and this time it began formatting normally.
problem solved i hope!!
