Hello, I have an older Intel D845PEBT2 motherboard and it has both the Primary and Secondary IDE channels, but it also has Primary and Secondary channels for onboard RAID.
I am not interested in setting up a RAID config, but I want to know if I can just add more drives and run them each independantly.
I tried hooking up a 3rd drive but it does not show up under My Computer in Windows XP.
I have enabled the RAID in the BIOS (I enabled it only, not set up a config) but Windows still will not show the icon for the drive.
I know the drive and the cable are good.
Is this possible on my motherboard?
Thanks.
