I recently had to get a whole new computer because my old one kept breaking.
I would like to put my old Hard Drive in as a slave just to get some of the information off of it.
Both Hard drives are SATA connections, and both have windows XP installed on them.
How do I put my old Hard Drive in as a slave so that the computer doesn't boot off of it?
