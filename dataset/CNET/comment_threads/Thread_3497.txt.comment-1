Just wondering if there are any external hard drives that will automatically update files on your hard drive?
I own a business and would like to auto save all my files in a designated area at the end of each work day.
For example... set it to save all my files in my C:/My Documents/TJdavisInc/ drive at 6pm every night.
Is this possible?
