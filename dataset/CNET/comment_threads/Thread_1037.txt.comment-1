Hallo,i've got a HP XW6600 and i'm having a problem to start the system after Win 7 installation.It goes to the windows logo and shuts down.I had the same problem Win XP pro and Vista business every time i've installed graphichs driver it did hang at the log in screen and hibernates after that.I've tried it with Nvidia quadro NVS 285 128Mb,Sapphire Radeon 5450 1GB and EVGA Geforce GTX 560 2GB.I have the same issue with XW6400.
No start up repair or fresh install helped.I'm at the end of my knowledge.
Could anybody help Thanks
