the most part cpu hs fans blow air downward toward the cpu but there are exception.
it all depends on the design.
if the chipset is running hot....there are better passive heatsinks and heatsinks with fans.
here's one place that specializes in these parts.
you'll see they also carry an endless variety of case fans that might help too.
i solved a defective chipset hs fan with a zalman passive cooler.
good luck and let us know how it works.
