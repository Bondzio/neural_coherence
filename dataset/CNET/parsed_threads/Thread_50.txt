<s> Hey Guys, Quick question for you: I can buy either a Corsair ValueSelect 2x256 Dual Channel DDR2 533 set or a G.Skill 1 x 512MB DDR2 800 stick. </s>
<s> They cost the exact same on Newegg. </s>
<s> Which do you think would be the better choice? </s>
<s> This computer will not be OC'd in any way, simply stock. </s>
<s> DDR2 800 is the highest RAM standard accepted by the Mobo I have picked, a Biostar TFORCE 550 for socket AM2. </s>
<s> Neither set will be pushed to its limits, as they will go into a computer for my sister. </s>
<s> This computer has to stick around for a LONG time, so longevity and keeping the computer current for as long as possible is a concern. </s>
<s> My sister is the teenybopper type, interests include internet gossip w/friends, email, instant messaging, and mp3. </s>
<s> thats about it. </s>
<s> so, with that said, any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks Keith </s>
<s> only 1 DIMM. </s>
<s> Got to install 2 DIMMs to take advantage of the design. </s>
<s> If any way possible, start with 1GB vs 512MB RAM ...it will defer or eliminate the need to add RAM. </s>
<s> What MB will this be going in ?? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Get your RAM facts straight on that motherboard. </s>
<s> I don't think thatit supports Dual Channel and doesn't it support DDR 400? </s>
<s> I would check the manufacturer's product page. </s>
<s> Typo. </s>
<s> DDR2 800? </s>
<s> I always forget to stick in the 2 and I see that I also typed 400. </s>
<s> supported. </s>
<s> It also shows DDR2 standard = DDR2 800 Question is, why go AMD now. </s>
<s> Looks like Intel is the better bang for the buck now. </s>
<s> Memory Number of DDR2 Slots 4x 240pin DDR2 DDR2 Standard DDR2 800 Maximum Memory Supported 4GB Dual Channel Supported Yes VAPCMD </s>
<s> I agree that Core 2 Duo is the better BFB (bang for buck) right now. </s>
<s> The caviat comes in with my price limit. </s>
<s> I am supposed to build the best computer possible being as close to $700 as possible. </s>
<s> I can do it with a Conroe E6300, but it is hard to find a good mobo that doesnt cost as much as the proc! </s>
<s> We will see how it ends up. </s>
<s> you include. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS .. Don't forget about the 2 DIMMs to take advantage of the dual channel architecture. </s>
<s> Might as well get all there is to get within the design limits. </s>
