1.1.1	Hi , I am considering buying the Gateway ZX 6810 all-in-one pc .	St
1.1.2	Would someone be able to advise me if all-in-ones in general or this Gateway in particular be susceptible to overheating .	St
1.1.3	I intend to use it in India , where outside temperatures can get pretty hot in summers ( going upto 45 Celcius ) .	St
1.1.4	In other words , is over-heating a serious problem with all-in-ones ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks ,	St
1.2.1	Such systems tend to be build that handle any heat build-up be exhausted or radiated away .	St
1.2.2	The makers knows it maybe a problem and thus allow for better static cooling .	St
1.2.3	However , if the environment itself is a threat then consider a system where you can improve on cooling as the all-in-ones are n't that capable of a any cooling upgrades other than external .	St
1.2.4	So , if you buy one , best to use it in A/C cooled room and/or where cooling is in a comfort zone for the PC .	St
1.2.5	This is akk an opinion , as I see it .	St
1.2.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I 'd be concerned about running any PC in an ambient temperature that high so you 're probably right to be concerned .	St
1.3.2	You might want to see if you can find specs for operating temperature ( non-condensing ) and keep well within that range .	St
