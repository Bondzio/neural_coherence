Alright, so I got my computer custom made, and the day after i order it, I read something about how power supplies are the #1 Most overlooked part of a custom comp. I got the intel i7 and a 400w power supply, should that be enough, because now that I have the computer, it worked fine for the first week, and now in the past 12 hours of use, it has turned off instantly 3 times now, the first two times i was running many things and thought it might have been a little too much for the power supply, but the most recent time, it turned off right when i started it up after going to google... Thanks in advance for the help...

Have you contacted them ? http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/?psn=000101&pid=202 400 Watt or greater power supply (550 Watt for ATI CrossFireX technology in dual mode) is recommended.

Well, i guess i have the minimum, because i actually havent installed the crossfire myself, because due to some confusion in the order, they had sent the bridge but didnt install it in the computer, so i will have to uprade the power supply before installing it...thanks for your help guys!

Just make sure you get a good quality PSU...because like everything all 600 watt PSUs are not equal. The better ones use less electricity too. VAPCMD
