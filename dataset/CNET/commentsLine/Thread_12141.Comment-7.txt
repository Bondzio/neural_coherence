there are 3 semprons: 2800+ 3000+ 3100+ the 2800 and 3000 are essentially athlon xp cpus.
the 3100+ is an athlon64 core without the 64bit instruction capability.
the 3100+ takes a different mainboard than the others.
most current athlonxp mainboards will accept the 2800 and 3000 but not the 3100, the socket is different.
now as far as low end systems, compaq is at sams club 3100+ 160gig hd 512 megs ram 17&quot; crt speakers cdburner dvd player usb 2 / firewire kb and mouse xp home for 599.00. that is pretty darn cheap and they are not bad systems
