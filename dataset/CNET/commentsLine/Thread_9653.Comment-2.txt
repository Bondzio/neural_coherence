drives us nuts.
be sure to try not to trip up the connection by other well meaning advice such as disabling the ssid broadcast.
start with no encryption and see if it works.
also, don't get too far away from the wifi router plus have current drivers.
one dropper was cured recently by using or not using the native windows wzc service.
let's see if we can find that.
in that case wzc was not helping.
hope this helps, bob
