with care of the usual moving parts such as keeping the fans and vents clean you find the hard disk makers rate their drives at &quot;5 year design life.&quot; but a desktop is unlike a laptop where we discuss the laptop life span at  a desktop usually can be repaired for less than 1/2 the cost of a new desktop so you can get well beyond the 5 years.
&quot;usable life&quot; however is another story.
if you are a gamer then lifespan appears to be about 2 years as the newest games tend to want the latest hardware.
