you need to unplug the device from your computer before you uninstall the driver in device manager.
as long as the device is plugged into your computer, it will continue to appear in device manager, even if you try to delete it from there.
or you can try looking for the device in the &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; area in the system tray and uninstall it from there.
if you still get the &quot;found new hardware&quot; message after you try these methods, then you should allow windows to go ahead and install the driver again.
after that, you should be able to see the device in device manager instead of seeing &quot;unknown device&quot; with a question mark.once the device has been restored to the device manager without that error message, you can then go ahead and uninstall the driver for good.
