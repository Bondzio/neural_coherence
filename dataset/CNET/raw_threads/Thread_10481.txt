On hps site it says that if you want to convert old home movies or tape recordings to a digital format is what the front analog connections are for. When I connect my analog camcorder to it nothing happens I figure I need some type of software to recognize the front port am I wrong? And if I do need some kind of software what do I need all the software I have looked at says it only reads from firewire or USB But not analog I know that I can buy a separate piece of hardware but that defeats the reason of why I bought the hp media center in the first place I wanted the built in analog ports. I called hp but they dont know what to do (strange) Can someone plz help me

So let's start with http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx Remember this system may let you record content but will not create a DVD from such. For that you have to buy something that will handle the usual DVR-MS files that Media Center creates. The trick is to get the camcorder showing on the Tv settings. http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/using/tv/recordtv.mspx and once there you can record it to the usual DVR-MS files. For me this is far too much work so I move to other software fast. Bob

Ok get this I called hp back and asked about the analog connections in the front of the media center and how to get it working. I gave them all the serial numbers and model first the lady try to tell me that the connections arent real. I told her Im starring right at it I finally got her to look on there own website and see that the connections are real. Then she try to tell me that I need a device that would change my analog from analog to digital then back to analog again then send it to the analog connection on the media center. Then I showed her on there website where it say you can capture video directly from analog devices such as vcr, or analog camcorder then she wanted to charge me $65.00 to talk to someone who would be able to tell me how the ports (that she said werent real) work.

It's an old electronics issue and not a bug or omission by anyone. If the unit claims you can convert your media and you can't find out how then why not ask for every dime back? Bob
