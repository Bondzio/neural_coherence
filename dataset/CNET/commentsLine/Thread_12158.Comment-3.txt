thank you so much for replying steven haninger!
i have a wired connection, cable.
cable plugged into modem and modem plugged into pc.
that's it.
i know there are usb flash drive-sized wireless adapters, that pick up wireless from existing access points.
but i would like to know if there's a flash drive-sized router.
where i can plug it into my wired pc and it will broadcast my internet.
i just want an access point made from my wired connection, but not with something as big as a router.
thanks again for all your help!
