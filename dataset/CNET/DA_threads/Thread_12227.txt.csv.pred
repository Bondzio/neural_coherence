1.2.1	Read a few from http : //forums.cnet.com/5238-7813-0.html ? kw=no+beeps & messageType=1 & tag=srchbr	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Yes , this is my First Build .	St
1.5.1	you want to test them outside the case so the you do n't end up like you are now ... everything 's inside and it does n't work .	St
1.5.2	You can try disconnecting the data and power cables from any of the drives , reduce the RAM to one stick , double check the PSU connectors ... the 24-pin and 4-pin ATX connectors and the PSU connector to the video card .	St
1.5.3	If the system wo n't POST then , the next step is to pull the MB ... .put in on a piece of cardboard and start from scratch .	St
1.5.4	Important to have a speaker connected so you hear any beeps which are signals for what 's wrong .	St
1.5.5	Here 's a good troubleshooting guide from MSI that may give you some some tips .	St
1.5.6	Start with noting but the CPU installed and build from there ... 1 DIMM , 2 DIMMs then video , then an HDD Keep us posted .	St
1.5.7	VAPCMD http : //www.msicomputer.com/support/sup_tshoot.asp	St
1.6.1	I think I found the problem , after doing some research I discovered that the D975XBX2 Motherboard does n't support the E6750 Processor because it uses a 1333 MHz FSB but the motherboard only supports 1066 or 800 MHz .	St
1.6.2	So the E6700 should work but I think I 'm going to get the Q6600 because it 's cheaper on Amazon and the motherboard supports it .	St
1.7.1	http : //processormatch.intel.com/COMPDB/SearchResult.aspx ? Boardname=d975xbx2 How about another MB ?	Ques
1.7.2	Abit IP35 PRO gets great reviews everywhere I read..and buyer reviews are good too .	St
1.7.3	If you stick with the Intel MB ... believe they 're sensitive to RAM speed .	St
1.7.4	So if that RAM is n't 1.8V ... might want to check too .	St
1.7.5	Keep us posted .	St
1.7.6	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	The Abit IP35 PRO looks good I think I 'll go with that one , thanks .	Polite
