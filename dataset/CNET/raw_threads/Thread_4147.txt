There are TWO Radeon drivers installing because Windows keeps detecting a secondary one on a PCI port! I remove them every time, but they keep coming back.

The computer relies on windows drivers through the PCI until told otherwise. It could be that either you have not installed Ati drivers properly, or whatever version of Ati is in conflict with windows. What does 'roll back drivers' do if you have a version of XP?

If you read through the install text (read me file) it will explain to you somewhere in it that this is normal. So I would gather that your weird issue isn't related to that, and request that you describe what's happening. TONI
