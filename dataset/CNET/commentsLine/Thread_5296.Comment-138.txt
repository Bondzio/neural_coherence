i would steer clear of anything that has a hp logo run runaway fast from that logo.
i was suckered into getting one and have regreted evrything about it.
i have the hp pavilion slimline s3020n and cannot do most of the updates for windows vista premium home edition.
here's the fix for that though.
adding more memory, som my question to hp that has never been answered is if you know the problem exists then why not charge the small amount extra so no extra fix would be needed.
the customer support is average but stll is mainly self directed.
bottom line is look elsewhere for a slightly better unit without have to add on fixes later.
that would drive up the after market price.
