checked out, the case has a capacity of 750gb, excellent.
so, like others have stated before, and after me then, you must be formatting it in fat32.
you have to format in ntfs and this should cure your problem.
delete the existing partition from the disk management section of computer management in administrative tools.
then, format the drive from the same section.
settings should be saying, file system = ntfs and allocation unit size = default.
no check marks in the boxes and format.
should be good to go then.
good luck.
