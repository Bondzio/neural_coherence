if you can help, i'd sincerely appreciate it.. i got a worm.
i managed to download ad-ware 6 and got rid of the worm, but had a corrupt registery file and could not get 'word' to open.
a computer savy relative changed from windows me to windows 2000, and 'word' worked, but dispite ad-ware 6 and mcaffee, i got another worm which resulted in a home page of porn advertisement which i could not reset(errant surfing 14 yr old lost computer privledges at this point).
now the problem.. i tried to use the recovery function on this out of warranty hp pavillion pentium 3, 128 mb ram desktop utilizing the provided cd.
1 it could not find hard drive, 2 suggested using fdisk function 3 fdisk offerred 4 alternatives; only one would work 4 that fuction offered 3 alternatives; only 1 worked 5 i created a partition, 6 reformated 7 recovery disk worked, loaded original windows me; worked correctly 8 tried to install software (printer), but found out i do not have enough disk space.
now i only have 1.99 gb with 1.79 already used.
did i seal off the rest of my hard drive disk space?
can anyone help get it back?
