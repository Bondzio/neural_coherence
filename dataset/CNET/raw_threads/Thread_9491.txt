My son (Now deceased) was assistant athetic trainer for the Alabama Crimson Tide from 1979-199. I have VCR tapes for every televised Crimson Tide game from 1985-1990. I want to heep them in a better format, and perhaps to edit and burn them to DVD-RW disks. Thanks, Ed Henne

We went to Best Buy and bought a DVD recorder that also had a VCR deck. Dubbing tapes to DVD is a cinch, though you do have to do that in real time. Once you have the DVDs burned, you can use software (I use a DVD ripper from Xilisoft) to rip those DVDs into smaller MPEGs if you want. But I suspect you just want DVDs of the tapes, so the dual deck is the way to go. Not expensive either.

For quick editing I use the following titles (the free ones.) Virtual Dub (snip snip!) DVD FLICK (that was easy) IMGBURN (that is good stuff) Bob
