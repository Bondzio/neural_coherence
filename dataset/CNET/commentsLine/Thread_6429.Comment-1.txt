i have a brand new lexar professional 32gb sdhc card that i used in my camcorder on vacation.
when i try to get the videos off it my computer isn't recognizing the card.
so i put it in the sdhc port in my printer and it said the card has an error.
when i view movies on the card via the camcorder, the list of movies on the cards show 2 boxes with exclamation points.
the rest of the videos play fine.
what are these boxes with exclamation points?
i sort of figure this is where the error on the card is.
is there any way to fix this so i can get the uncorrupted movies off the card?
so disappointed that this card did this so soon after buying it.
thanks in advance for the help!
