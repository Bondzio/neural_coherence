you should definitely check to see that any existing fans are running okay, but it sounds to me at first glance you have a demo'ed hard drive.
ticking like a clock and then a thud is a pretty good indication the read arm is defective, and most likely broken all together.
if it's still accessing c: drive, it may not be too late to get your stuff off of there.
this doesn't mean the rest of the unit is garbage, just the hard drive needs replacing.
if it's particularly old, it may not be worth it to you to replace the hard drive if in fact that's the problem.
there's a remote possibility it's a fan and an overheat is wht's causing the lock-up but i really doubt it.
