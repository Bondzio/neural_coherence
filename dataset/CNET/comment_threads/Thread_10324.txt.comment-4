I just switched from a Linksys wireless G router to a DLink Extreme wireless N router - DIR 655.
The difference is night and day.
Now the kids play their online games and the internet works perfectly.
No one complains of slow load times.
I had to many issues with the Linksys.
Set up with the DLink was a breeze.
Consider this one another option.
