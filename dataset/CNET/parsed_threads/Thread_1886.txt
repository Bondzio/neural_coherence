<s> Replaced my mobo with the exact same one that was on my system Intel desktop board D815EPEA2. </s>
<s> The only difference was the old mobo had onboard video and the new one needed an AGP card. </s>
<s> I installed a evga card e-geforce MX4000 and added a Trendnet wireless pci card. </s>
<s> I left the hard drive with windows xp home that was being used on the old system and 2 cd drives. </s>
<s> The problem is that when I turn on the system I get no video. </s>
<s> Nothing happens on the monitor. </s>
<s> I looked at an old post in April where someone had the same problem but it was inconclusive. </s>
<s> Would appreciate some ideas as to why this is happening. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> When I have this type of problem with a clients PC, the first thing I do is to remove all expansion cards except video from the motherboard. </s>
<s> And then disconnect all drives from the motherboard, so the only thing you have left is memory and video card. </s>
<s> Make sure the drive cables are disconnected from the motherboard not just the power cables. </s>
<s> Then try booting the system. </s>
<s> If you get video, then try reconnecting the drives and installing the expansion cards one at a time. </s>
<s> If you don't get video, then either the video card, memory, CPU or motherboard is bad. </s>
<s> If you get down to the last four items, remove the battery from the motherboard or reset the BIOS with the jumper and try again. </s>
<s> Try removing all the memory, and see it you get a beep warning from the BIOS from the missing memory. </s>
<s> If there is no beep without the memory then the motherboard is the problem, if you do get the beep warning , then it is probably a bad video card. </s>
<s> You can also remove the CPU from the motherboard and power on the system for a few seconds to reset the motherboard, sometimes the CPU and motherboard get out of synch and doing this resets them. </s>
<s> Hope this gives you some ideas about what to try. </s>
<s> If you can't boot , how did you install the video drivers for the card? </s>
