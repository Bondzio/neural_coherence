<s> OK so here is my problem. </s>
<s> I recently ran out of space on my 1tb hdd. </s>
<s> So until i saved up enough money to buy and new 1tb hdd i decided to take out my 160gb sata drive from my old laptop and let that hold me over for a few weeks till i get enough money. </s>
<s> The installation went great plugged everything in and windows detected it just fine. </s>
<s> problem now is i wanna format it so i can have all the space from it to put shows, music etc. </s>
<s> in it put every time i try to format the drive i get the following error. </s>

<s> Dell Xps 9100 1tb hdd, 160gb sata I7 Processor Radeon 6870 GPu 9gb ram. </s>
<s> I would unplug my good drive (just power off and pull the cables off) then boot up DBAN or GPARTED and try again. </s>
