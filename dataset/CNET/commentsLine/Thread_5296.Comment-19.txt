a dedicated graphics card is necessary in one of four scenarios: 1. you play games which are above and beyond web-based ones or very old games.
even older games will benefit with a basic dedicated graphics card.
2. you play high definition compressed video, whether locally or on the internet, including blu-ray movies.
an integrated graphics solution will be able to play high definition compressed video, but it will likely cause the computer's cooling solutions to kick into high gear, potentially causing a lot of noise.
3. you edit high definition videos or shoot dslr photos in raw.
most newer video and image editing software packages can tap into the processing power of a dedicated graphics card to greatly reduce the time necessary to encode video, apply effects and do real-time previews.
4. you use some other program which either requires or gets a significant performance boost from a dedicated graphics solution.
gpus are different types of processors than the main cpu in your computer and are not just game accelerators any more.
programs above and beyond games and video editors are beginning to take advantage of gpus as they are more efficient than cpus in certain computing tasks.
now, with all this being said, you don't have to run out and buy a monster graphics card like an ati radeon hd 5970 or an nvidia geforce gtx 480 in order to play games, watch hd video or run a video editor.
those graphics cards will do them quite well - in fact they're the best available as of this post, but they aren't necessary for everyone.
a much more basic card such as an nvidia geforce gts 250 or ati radeon hd 5550 will handle any of the above tasks just fine while not costing as much as a new computer.
they won't be able to handle the latest and greatest games with all the details at maximum and at the highest resolution, but they will play most current games no problem.
