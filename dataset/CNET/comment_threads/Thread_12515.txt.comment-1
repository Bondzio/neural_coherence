Hello, CNET Forum: Recently I needed to format my computer and reinstall everything.
Everything's set up correctly again, with one annoying exception- I can't get my computer to recognize and use the Front Audio Panel of my Antec Sonata II case.
The internal wiring between the panel and my GA-8I915P Duo Pro motherboard hasn't changed, and my BIOS is at its latest version (and has the option to automatically recognize the Azalia Codec enabled, and the type set to &quot;AC'97&quot; (as opposed to HD Audio, which never worked) under the BIOS settings).
I have the codecs from this site http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=14&PFid=23&Level=4&Conn=3&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false (the 1st WinXP compatible linked downloadable file) but when I install them, the only available options from the &quot;DEFAULT PLAYBACK&quot; drop down menu under the AUDIO TAB of the SOUND AND AUDIO DEVICES applet from CONTROL PANEL are my: -Sound Blaster 4 Audigy SE (really a misnomer on SB's part, but nm) -a Modem #0 Line Playback, and a -HD Audio Rear Output (the speakers ports built into my motherboard itself).
Doing some research (cursory, only) off of Google led me to downloading the codecs below (C-Media CMI9880 Driver (Windows XP/2000) 62.64) http://www.download.com/3001-2120_4-10518831.html?spi=9b7b4d7c6da9a9d883288f21a2d16c51 but they seem nearly exactly the same as the C-Media Audio Codec/Driver I previously downloaded off of Windows Update which 1) Seemingly changed the name of the Default Playback option &quot;HD Audio Rear Output&quot; to &quot;C-Media Audio Rear Output&quot; only 2) caused the Dr Watson Post Mortem Debugger to screw up explorer everytime my computer restarted due to something related to msconfig & startup (which I fixed by uninstalling the Windows-Update provided C-Media installation).
I know for a fact that pre-format my front audio panel worked just fine using the codecs available from the site linked to from the first hyperlink pasted above.
I am not sure why the exact same setup no longer works.
I would greatly appreciate any help from more experienced CNET troubleshooters, and gladly give my thanks in advance for your efforts on my behalf.
Kind Regards, Tom
