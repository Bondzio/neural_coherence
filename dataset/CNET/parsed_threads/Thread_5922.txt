<s> Actually I see many grievances with over 127GB drives and that many can't partition or format the drive. </s>
<s> More at http://www.48bitlba.com With the PC user base becoming more &quot;users&quot; than owners I'm seeing that most will have a basic issue and call the products bad. </s>
<s> They are right in one respect. </s>
<s> The product in its quest to lower costs does not include tutorials or basic troubleshooting. </s>
<s> Also some machines will not support such size drives. </s>
<s> The fallout is a top post like this. </s>

<s> i maybe the only who's gonna use the computer... atmost will be two users... the other one being a guest account.. </s>
<s> Such devices do come with a warranty and the only pitfall I find today is that people expect hard disks to never fail or try to use them as backup. </s>
<s> As long as you can partition, format and keep your backups going, you'll do fine. </s>

<s> of buying either the 250 or the 500 is the same? </s>
<s> thanks for all the help... ill probbly get the 500gb... </s>
<s> Let's say I had 2 250GB or a single 500GB. </s>
<s> At first glance the risk of the 500GB looks to be twice as large since any small mistake by me or the OS or a power outage at the wrong moment will wipe out 500GB vs the chances with 2 250GB units might lose only 250GB. </s>
<s> Then again, having twice as many parts raises the possibility that problems may occur twice as often. </s>
<s> You can see where this is going. </s>
<s> -&gt; Here's the bottom line. </s>
<s> Hard disks are still temporary and fast storage. </s>
<s> If you can't lose something then you find backup medium such as DVDRW or other to have spare copies ready. </s>

<s> i guess ill get the 250gb and just get an external one.. i cant lose 500gb in a flash.... i got too many photos, videos, etc... but then again, i might change my decision again.. hehe thanks for all the info.. if theres still anything relevant thing i need to know bout, not necessarily just on hard drives, but in general about the imac intel core duo, i would appreciate it if u could let me know. </s>
<s> thanks... </s>
