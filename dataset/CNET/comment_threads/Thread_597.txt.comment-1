Hi, i have a 2TB external hard drive connected to my desktop.A few days ago when i was trying to open a folder on the drive in says &quot;XYZ not accessible.The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable&quot;.
Is there a way i can fix the problem with this problem.I'm using windows 7 home premium.
