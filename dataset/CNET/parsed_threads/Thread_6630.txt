<s> I just got an external hard drive with a 160GB hitachi hard drive in it. </s>
<s> The enclosure is a USB 2.0 PM-350-U2. </s>
<s> I hook it up to my computer and the drivers install and report no problems. </s>
<s> I have 3 USB 2.0 ports and tried them all. </s>
<s> I also have Windows XP Pro SP2. </s>
<s> The disk also does not appear on the disk management utility. </s>
<s> Can someone please help me. </s>
<s> No mention about the machine make/model and if you installed the motherboard driver package or it's USB 2.0 supplement. </s>
<s> Some boards require this. </s>
<s> http://www.usbman.com has more about USB 2.0 Be sure to see if the USB drive works on another machine. </s>
<s> It could be dead. </s>

<s> I have a HP ZV5000 notebook. </s>
<s> The USB drivers are installed and they do work. </s>
<s> Every time I hook up the hard drive to my computer the safely remove hardware icon appears. </s>
<s> In my device mananger, all my USB drivers are there and working properly. </s>
<s> The host controllers and USB mass storage device is also there and working. </s>
<s> I hooked up the hard drive to another computer and the same things occur. </s>
<s> Sorry to read about your loss. </s>
<s> Have you tried another USB cable? </s>

<s> Thank you for your help </s>
<s> Why does the computer recognize the disk drive and usb device in device manager but won't work. </s>
<s> The hard disk isn't supported in the case. </s>
<s> The hard disk is unplugged in the case. </s>
<s> The hard disk is dead. </s>
<s> The case has a fault. </s>
<s> The cable has a fault. </s>
<s> There isn't enough of a clue train here to nail this one. </s>
<s> But if it's not working with any machine... then it's dead. </s>

<s> The jumpers on the drive didn't match what the instructions noted. </s>
<s> Who reads those? </s>
<s> The jumpers on the instructions don't match what really works. </s>
<s> They don't read them! </s>
