Even tried 3 at one time, did not do much to improve anything. I just removed the 9800's and installed daul EVGA 250GT's with 1gig ram each. In BoarderLands now running the 250's, I am seeing some latency that was not there with the 9800's! I was under the assumption that the 250's were a step up from the 9800's which only have 512m each. Please advise. Thanks.

But the performance overall could be less as more QUALITY in the rendering could eat up any gain in the GPUs. In otherwords, 2 steps forward and 2 steps back. I'd expect a better looking display but no gains. Bob
