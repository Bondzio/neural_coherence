i have one for a while allready it works goood for me.
the only problem i see is yhat you have to keep you computer running all the time if you want your house phone working, otherwise transfer the calls to your cell phone.
i think it is a good deal for the money you pay for it.
it will be a good idea if they get it to work off the omputer, direct to the internet line like vonage is doing, that way you don't have to keep your computer running if you are no using it.
