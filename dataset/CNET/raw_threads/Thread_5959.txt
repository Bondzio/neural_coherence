18	0	55452	660720	NR	beatlejoel	1/6/05 8:26 AM	1.10499996E12	Please offer help if you can	I have 3 computers and am trying to hook them up to a network. I have the linksys wrt54g and the appropriate adapters for the other 2 computers. I installed the router and was able to connect to the internet fine. It told me to install the other 2 adapters before setting up the network. I installed the 1st adapter fine and came to check my router connection and I could connect to the internet. I tried everything to connect and finally had to restore to yesterdays settings just to be able to use my cable modem again. What am I doing wrong? and is there someone who can talk me through it? Thanks for any help. Windows xp

The IP Address range is usually, depending on your router, 192.168.0.100 to 192.168.0.199. You'll need to set up each machine within that range.
