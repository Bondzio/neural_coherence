<s> Thanks all. </s>
<s> &quot;to run without any delay&quot; But any nice Windows 7 64 bit machine with 4 or more GB RAM may be a fine start. </s>
<s> Since it is price sensitive, let's look at desktops with quad core CPUs and at least 4GB RAM. </s>

<s> ....relatively speaking. </s>
<s> I meant without any appreciable delay. </s>
<s> I just want to make sure I have what I need to work with my digital photos. </s>

<s> So let's hear what you use now. </s>
