I haven't been able to find crap for user reviews of larger scanners for businesses so I'm hoping someone here can help. I'm looking for opinions on the Fujitsu 5185601/518501 and Ricoh IS760 scanners on newegg.com. Or any first hand reviews of other large scanners capable of 12x18 scanning. Also, does anyone have opinions on the included scanning software from those manufacturers?

So all have &quot;worked.&quot; What usually happens is the new owner had other criteria such as &quot;I want to put the sheet to be scanned in and it to scan it with a push of the button. I want the software to automatically name it per my specification...&quot; That never happens. Bob
