1.1.1	Hello , I just purchased a USB 3.5G modem - model : K190 made by KTech and I need its drivers/software .	St
1.1.2	It does n't work ( except the extra SD memory card capability ) as it does n't have any drivers or software on it , contrary to what the store clerk said , maybe there 's a defect because I already tried it on two different laptops .	St
1.1.3	Certainly , it did n't come with any CD or manual nor can I give it back .	St
1.1.4	The company does n't have any website and there are no drivers to be found on the internet..	St
1.1.5	I spent hours looking for the modem 's drivers..	St
1.1.6	I would be very grateful if somebody could help me out and if possible , send me the software/driver of this modem to my email address : gkmansion @ o2.pl If somebody from this website does n't help me , I will have to throw it away : ( I paid $ 25 for it..	St
1.1.7	I realize that for some folks it 's nothing , but I 'm quite poor and I ca n't afford to buy another model..	St
1.1.8	Thank you for your time and help in advance .	St

1.2.1	Just purchased means you should return it if they do n't supply those or the location to get the drivers .	St
