my friend has this to say: i have tried many things, but no results.
the latest is to select the flopy, click &quot;properties&quot; and at the bottom of the page i see three boxes as follows; 'read only' - &quot;hidden&quot; and &quot; archives&quot;.
usualy the read only is check, so i clear that and try the other two attributes or none .
an &quot;apply&quot; box appears and i check that, but nothing changes.
do you know how i can get rid of the &quot;read only
