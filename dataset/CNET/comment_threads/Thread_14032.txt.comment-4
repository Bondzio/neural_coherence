it's next-to-impossible for a PC that's functioning normally to &quot;kill&quot; a power supply every few months.
an electrical problem in the PC would cause it to perform erractically if at all.
however, bad AC power can cause a power supply to fail and a cheap surge suppressor won't clean up bad power.
