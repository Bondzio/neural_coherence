anything that has moving parts, and even some things that don't, have what was referred to as &quot;mean time to failure&quot; or words to that effect.
essentially, this means that anything with moving parts, from your egg timer to your car, will eventually wear out some part that will cause failure of either another part or parts, or just cause the entire machine to fail.
this also means that a computer that is used 8 hours a day should last 3 times longer than a computer that is left on 24 hrs/day, unless it can slow down drive after long periods of non-use.
sometimes it is easy to examine and determine the cause of the failure (e.g.
a burnt-out spark plug or fuse).
other times it is not so clear until you take the entire thing apart.
the manufacturer used to (i have not checked in years) a brief statement in their computer specs about average time to failure, giving you something to compare along with prices.
why pay $100 for a hard drive that will fail sooner than a similar drive which may not be that far apart in price?
also remember, that one of the solutions for failed drives is to reformat the drive, destroying all the data on the disk that you could not remove.
so remember to backup those backups!
