The 2 page text email is about 60 characters per line of 50 lines, so that's 3,000 bytes per page or 6K for 2 pages. Now let's bump that up to 10K to allow for overhead and make the calculation easy. 16 GB is 16,000,000,000 and 10K is 10,000, so now we can just knock 4 zeros of that 16 GB and get 1,600,000 emails. Is that enough for you?

I guess the 16 is adequate...thanks for doing the 'quick math'....couldn't find that answer anywhere.... Is it easy to do ??? Is there are 'step-by-step' directions somewhere on how to transfer all those emails in one 'block' or 2 or 3... ??? (hopefully - not 1 by 1) Where could I find those directions ??/

And you've neglected to mention that little detail. The key word though is EXPORT. E.g. with Windows Live Mail, you click the xxxxxx and click export email. Point it at an empty folder and it'll put all of them in that folder. Each one is a separate file, but you can put them in a single zipped file and take advantage of compression at the same time.
