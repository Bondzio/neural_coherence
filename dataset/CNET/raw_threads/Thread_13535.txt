Wired or wireless, I don't care. I just want to be able to access and control the camera from anywhere. - Zoom via web interface. - Start/stop recording via web interface. - SD or microSD storage - Good picture, at least as good as a midrange webcam Not required, but pan/zoom/tilt would be great. There are plenty that match 75% of what I want, but either the video is only 720p or you can't control the camera via the web or the picture stinks, etc. I won't say price is no object, but I'd spend up to $200 for the right camera, which is pretty good for a webcam these days.

It's weird that the market still lists 640x480 as a great video resolution on $250 cameras, when my cellphone can do 1080p and 8 megapixel stills. It would almost make sense to buy some cheap phones and never activate them. Just keep them wireless only and remote in to them.

Even USB 2.0 is getting soaked at 480 megabits per second at 480p or 720p. If we could drop the frame rate, sure we can get 1080 across but then what? The last time I had this dicussion they wanted to do a live 1080p feed to webcast and they didn't have all the hardware and no internet connection fast enough. 480p is great for webcam talks. Bob

The camera can have an sd card or microsd card in it to capture the data. The only thing that needs to get transmitted via wireless is the start and stop recording commands, pan right/left, etc.

And you're talking to the right person as I have traveled to the makers to help correct the code in security DVRs. That's not a webcam at all but a surveillance device. There are some cheap units that do such but fail as a web cam (because it's not a web cam.) They also fail your remote requirements. -&gt; There are some HD CCTV units that come close and possibly are out there that I don't know about but the prototypes I encountered were still North of a few thousand.
