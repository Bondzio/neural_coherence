<s> I got an external enclosure and an 80gb HD off Newegg to transfer all my stuff from my desktop to so that way I could ditch the desktop and just use the external HD for storage for my laptop. </s>
<s> I followed all the instructions in assembling the enclosure with the HD and then plugged everything. </s>
<s> The computer says the device is working working fine but the drive won't show up in the My Computer folder. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> This is the enclosure: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16817155512 And this is the HD: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16822145069 </s>
<s> If not... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
