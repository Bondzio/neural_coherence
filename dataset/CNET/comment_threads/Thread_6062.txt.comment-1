I work for a company as a Media Handler.
Another big company contracts to our company to pull tapes from the libraries and send them offsite.
We had 3 accounts that went somewhere else for their media storage needs a few years back.
They left behind over 3 thousand+ tapes that we sold to a buyer or reseller.
The tapes had old data on them.
This information was important enough to back up and maybe had SS numbers included.
Was this a bad thing and did our company break any laws?
