Give away to local school or maybe neighbor, I gave a similar older computer to my stepdaughter and another to a neighbor who had school-age kids yet couldn't afford to buy a computer.
Both partys were very happy, since they just wanted to get on the Internet and do homework.
I might have gotten $25-$50 out of the computers but neither had that much and I was happy to keep them out of the landfill.
