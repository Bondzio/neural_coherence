<s> As administrator, Vista, why would an on board NIC (wired) keep an IP or aquire an IP from an unknown router, not release nor renew. </s>
<s> See's my router, address 192.168....., but won't let go of an IP address of 196........?? </s>
<s> Disabled in bios the on board NIC, added USB Wireless adapter, this adapter gets the 196... frame like the NIC?? </s>
<s> Won't release or renew....only have limited access, no internet just local....I done all the obvious what am I missing here? </s>
<s> IP Stack corrupt, winsock?? </s>
<s> Any suggestions.....oh yeah, ALL network settings for the adapters were all dhcp enabled, with no ip addresses manually entered. </s>
<s> Suggestions are welcome??? </s>
<s> Thanks ahead of time......... </s>
<s> The 169 series is well discussed, the 196 would be a new mystery. </s>

<s> I am sure it was 196, I will double check, will respond back to you this evening </s>
<s> you mentioned &quot;well discussed&quot;....take me to the holy grail...... </s>
<s> It means there is a hard failure most of the time. </s>
<s> Cable, card or damaged OS. </s>
<s> To sniff out which I boot a LiveCD called UBUNTU (see google) since it runs from CD with no install. </s>
<s> If it can't use the ethernet I know it's cable, card or router ports. </s>
<s> There are far too many discussions about the 169 issue but that's the boiled down version and the test I use. </s>
