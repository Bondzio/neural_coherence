there can be multiple causes that leads to problem such as this.
i had similar problem on my laptop (an ibm thnkpad)before.
just fyi.
this was what i did: i took out the seemd problematic hard drive and replace it with a new hard drive and tried to install winodws xp on it.
it wouldn't install .then i knew the problem was probablly with the motherboard.
i took it to ibm service to have them check it out for me.
the service engineer told me that the problem can bee either with chipset(hardware) on the board or the that drived the chipset.
in my case,lucky enough, it turned out that the firmware was out of date and wouldn't work with the level of windows on the hard drive.
he downloaded the latest firmware from ibm site installed it and the hard drive booted properly.
and i wasn't charged for that.
hope this helps.
good luck.god bless.
may the force be with you :-)) jacob
