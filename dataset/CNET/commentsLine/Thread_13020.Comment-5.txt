ok i found a driver update for the scsi card and i now get into windows (after a long wait) it doesent find the drive but displays it in device manager under the drives bit.
i cant seem to get it recognised to format it or anything at all yet, so really im back at square one (i take this time to say that this is my first scsi experience so im verry much at sea on this one:) to respond to bob: i have found a website to get drivers for this card but it doesent show my one (or im not giving the right info)  all i have on this board is :fcc id # cnt75mxz33 its a compaq card with a symbios logic (do the numbers on the chip mean anything?
53c875j 609-0392654 dp06945 9821r ... from the card is a 50 pin connector ribbon to a 50 -68 pin comnnector pluging straight into the drive (no other connectors on the ribbon) i have put the jumpers onto scsi id 1 but i still dont know what the jumpers all mean and what to do with them?
if i have to get a different card, what type do i need and does it have to match the drive?
my head is starting to hurt;(
