<s> Hello everybody, I'm planning to buy an iMac G5 in a couple of months and I've been reading some feedback on the product from other users. </s>
<s> I like the elegant desing of the iMac G5 but I'm worried about a possible fried system because of the tiny all in one integrated design. </s>
<s> That concern comes to mind after reading some users said that the system has not lasted more than 30 days before frying. </s>
<s> My concern is greater since I don't live in the U.S. and a refund or system change is more difficult overseas and the investment is too much to take such a risk. </s>
<s> I read that consumers should not buy first generation Apple products because they always fail. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> Should I wait a little more? </s>
<s> I haven't heard from Apple explaining possible issues about the heating factor on the new iMac G5. </s>
<s> Many users have complain that it has a noisy fan and its performance is not like the one advertised by Apple in the first place. </s>
<s> I like the space saving design and upgrading capabilities of the iMac G5 and I would like to buy one. </s>
<s> What do you guys recomend me about the possible heating and fry factor? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Hi, I can see you concern about the difficulties of returns and system changes. </s>
<s> However, I think that Apple has the required infrastructure in place for all the places that it sells equipment to. </s>
<s> You have not said where in the world you live so I cannot be more specific. </s>
<s> First generation machines are always a little suspect but the iMac G5 is no longer a First generation machine. </s>
<s> It has been updated at least twice. </s>
<s> I know of 8 iMac G5 owners and none of them have had any problem with their machines. </s>
<s> Do some more reading and remember, you only hear about the fried few and never about the working thousands. </s>
<s> Good Luck P </s>
<s> Hello, One of my co-workers purchased a new iMac G5 over six months ago and loves it. </s>
<s> No problems ever. </s>
<s> I think that Apple did their job on this one. </s>
<s> Yet, he leaves his toaster oven on repeatedly. </s>
<s> He will probably burn his house down some day. </s>
<s> He does not use his iMac for frying eggs in the morning either. </s>
<s> Seriously, on the other hand, another co-worker bought one of the brand-new iMac G4s before and has had a lot of problems with it for over a year. </s>
<s> But, not overheating. </s>
<s> Mostly software issues. </s>
<s> Where in the world did you hear the feedback that the iMac G5 overheated and fried? </s>
<s> I would like to know please? </s>
<s> Need facts and documentation! </s>
<s> If it is true, than I think that it could become the next George Forman Fry-O-Lator! </s>
<s> Foodnetwork.com could be selling them next. </s>
<s> I think that I am getting hungry with all this frying stuff. </s>
<s> Is it also good for toasting crumpets also? </s>
<s> Thought that I would keep the discussion light. </s>
<s> :) Kevin </s>
<s> Hi, Yes, my concern about the returns and refunds is a bit higher than purchasing an iMac living in the U.S. </s>
<s> I live in Central America. </s>
<s> We do not have Apple stores over here, only distributors. </s>
<s> Their sells and systems have guarantee of course but I will not be purchasing one to them cuz is a lot money to spend. </s>
<s> I want to buy my iMac G5 directly from the Apple website. </s>
<s> It's good to know that the iMac G5 has been updated at least twice and according to your buddies none of them has had any problems with the overheating factor. </s>
<s> That will be my first Mac since I wanna change from Mac to Windows because I'm tired of all the updating thing and spyware, viruses, OS inestability, etc. </s>
<s> Regarding of the feedback I read, yes, there were some people who had troubles with their Mac's cuz of the overheating factor. </s>
<s> Of course I will do more reading but I wanted some opinion of this community. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> I had a lot of fun reading your post. </s>
<s> Well, the feedback I read was from CNET's users opinion on the new iMac G5. </s>
<s> I want to make something clear too. </s>
<s> Out of the 450 something... opinions about the product, maybe only 10% or 15% were bad. </s>
<s> But it happens that almost all the bad opinions were noisy-fan related and that makes you wonder if there could be a problem with an overheating system in the future since the desing is up to such a thing to happen. </s>
<s> And about the frying thing, yes, there was some user that affirmed that his system fried due to overheating. </s>
<s> But my concern about all of this is that it happens that I can be a person that can face the same situation and since I live in Central America my invesment adquires a higher risk. </s>
<s> I hope you guys can understand my concern. </s>
<s> I'm not saying exactly that this will happen to me nor do I want you guys to think that I'm overreacting. </s>
<s> I just wanna be sure before I make the decision. </s>
<s> I will catch up my reading also. </s>
<s> Have a nice weekend. </s>
<s> There was a problem with a brand new G4 tower that had a bad cooling system and a really noisy fan a year ago at work. </s>
<s> Kind of sounded like an air-conditioner starting up.WWWWWRRRRRRWWWWHHHEEERRRR!!!! </s>
<s> (Lousy sound effects!) </s>
<s> Our company sent it back to Apple and the new G4 replacement was quiet as a Church Mouse. </s>
<s> (Bad Fan) If you are worried about getting fried by Apple, don't worry. </s>
<s> Apple will replace it! </s>
<s> Guaranteed and they do not want any of their apples fried. </s>
<s> Baked, maybe, with some brown sugar! </s>
<s> I do not think that it would cost you anything to have it returned and sent back for a new iMac-G5 if it ever came to that, being fried. </s>
<s> What are the latest CNET reviews on the iMac-G5? </s>
<s> As a suggestion, go to about.com and read the reviews on the iMac-G5. </s>
<s> About.com has a ton of info also. </s>
<s> One other site would be daniweb.com A forum site. </s>
<s> Nice! </s>
<s> Ask a question and get the answer. </s>
<s> Free to join Apple stands behind all of its products. </s>
<s> Guaranteed. </s>
<s> If you ever had a problem with an Apple product and had to do a replacement, you would probably receive your replacement in the same time as I would living here in New England. </s>
<s> Check out the Apple website and distribution. </s>
<s> Where do you live in Central America? </s>
<s> Thanks for your post, Kevin </s>
<s> Well, about the CNET's reviews I just did a search on home page (iMac G5) and I clicked on the &quot;all users opinions&quot; button. </s>
<s> Thank you for giving info about these sites that can also provide me with feedback on the iMac. </s>
<s> I live in El Salvador. </s>
<s> Users opinions are sometimes helpful. </s>
<s> Try those other sites out also. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
