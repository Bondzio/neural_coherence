ok, after reviewing the manual for my mobo and looking at the intel web site, i am even more confused.
the site says that i only need to set 3 jumpers while the manual says 5. ive double checked and the manual i have is correct, d865perl.
the website makes more sense as my mobo only came with 3 jumper blocks or whatever they are called.
please help clarify.
