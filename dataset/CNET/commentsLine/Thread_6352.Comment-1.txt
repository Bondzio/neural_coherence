i'm putting together an old pc i brought home from school with all the same parts except for the case.
when i hook everything in, turn on the psu, and turn on the power, the fans run for less that one second before turning off.
i am positive the motherboard is not shorting out on the case, nor is any other component.
i've triple-checked all of the connections, but i still get the same problem.
it's possible that on the trip back, one or more of the parts may have sustained damage.
can anyone diagnose this problem?
