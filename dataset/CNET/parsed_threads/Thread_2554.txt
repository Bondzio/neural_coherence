<s> I have this card installed on an XP OS, and have nothing but problems. </s>
<s> The box says &quot;For Best Ports Connection&quot; and it uses an ALi chipset, 4 USB's plus firewire. </s>
<s> The drivers never seem to install right, I also tried one from another site. </s>
<s> Now the hardware wizard comes up everytime I boot. </s>
<s> ANyone have luck with this card? </s>
<s> I got this off eBay for a bargain, but that seems not to be now. </s>
<s> It appeared to work for a bit, but not all devices initially, now it seems useless. </s>
<s> any help? </s>
<s> -thanks, Russ </s>
<s> I'm finding it works fine with camcorders, but reports of dataloss on Windows with firewire drives just continue. </s>
<s> I know of no fix other than to move the drive to USB. </s>
<s> In closing, I install no drivers for such cards with XP SP2. </s>

<s> I'm sorry, I did not understand your message about hard drive, USB port. </s>
<s> My problem is with a PCI card that is supposed to give me USB 2.0 & firewire ports. </s>
<s> The card seems to have major driver issues with WIN XP and I do have SP2 loaded. </s>
<s> The people who sell this card seem to play dumb. </s>
<s> Just looking to see if this is a lousy generic card and that there are in fact no legit drivers out there for this. </s>
<s> I can't seem to find a legit tech support site for this as well. </s>
<s> Maybe someone can even recommend a bargain USB 2.0 card out there. </s>

<s> People are losing data on PC/Windows and firewire drives daily. </s>
<s> What can I do but warn you off? </s>
<s> As to drivers? </s>
<s> I have yet to need them for any Firewire card. </s>

<s> I have a 4 port MS DOS PCI serial expansion card containing a Nm9845CV chip by MosChip. </s>
<s> I can not get this card to work. </s>
<s> The card manufacturer is not labled but packaging refers to &quot;Best Ports Connection&quot;. </s>
<s> My BIOS acknowledges the card but the the BIOS and driver monitor tells me that the COM ports need to be reconfigured. </s>
<s> MosChip.com has driver information and documentation but not enough for me to configure the COM ports for my application. </s>
<s> Anyone have information on this card or how to configure the COM port parameters? </s>
<s> The post you replied to is about an USB/Firewire card. </s>
<s> Yours is not this card. </s>
<s> On your new post supply: a. </s>
<s> A link to the product. </s>
<s> I will not hunt it down. </s>

<s> Model....SY-NEC-5U Serial....UW0702NC00900 I believe I am having the same issue with this card, and yes I bought it from Ebay at a bargain as well. </s>
<s> It has the 5 USB port connections (1 internal, 4 external). </s>
<s> I have installed it in the top PCI slot of my motherboard and I let Windows XP SP2 find the driver(s), which it did with no problems. </s>
<s> In &quot;device manager&quot;, the new card shows up and shows to be working properly with no conflicts. </s>
<s> Now the problem.......No matter what I plug into the new usb card, it doesnt recognize any of them (mouse, digital camera, printer, etc.) </s>
<s> I get a small balloon at the bottom right corner that says &quot;unknown device&quot;. </s>
<s> If I plug any of these items back into my motherboard usb slots, it finds them correctly with no issues....but my motherboard usb slots are 1.1 which is why I bought this new card. </s>
<s> Any fixes or tech support for this problem? </s>
<s> I will comment that the most common fix to this issue is to install the motherboard drivers. </s>
<s> However if the card is dead... </s>
<s> Machine?? </s>
<s> I built my own pc.....Motherboard &quot;ECS Elite Group&quot;, &quot;K7VTA3 V.8&quot; Everything on my pc works fine, it's just the new card that doesnt. </s>
<s> My motherboard AND windows see the card and acknowledge it, but the card itself doesnt recognize anything I plug into it. </s>
<s> Test the card in another machine and find ECS's latest motherboard driver package... </s>
