I my computer had been turned off and without power supply for four hours, if not longer when I initially removed the faulty RAM.
By the time I received replacement RAM, my computer had been sitting, turned off, without power supply for two weeks.
I don't think I need to worry about that.
However, when I took it into a shop this morning; the guy told me my mobo had still managed to short itself and I'm in need of a new one -.-
