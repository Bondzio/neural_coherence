Sorry...I re-read your question and notice that you are using a Netgear router...and my answer was referring to a Linksys router.
I don't think anything would be THAT much different...you still &quot;cascade&quot; as I describe...I would contact Netgear and get their input.
Incidently, my RT31P2 Vonage router is the &quot;first&quot; one in line from the modem.
sorry if I confused you with the Linksys info
