I'll explain my layout: I have DSL internet and 2 computers.
One computer has 2 network cards, the other has one.
I have the DSL modem going into one of the network cards on computer A.
The 2nd card on computer A is hooked up to a 5 port switch.
Computer B is also hooked up to the switch.
Before I had broadband i used dialup.
This set up worked fine for dial up, but for some reason the internet wont work at all if i try to network the 2 computers using this method.
Please help me!
Thanks
