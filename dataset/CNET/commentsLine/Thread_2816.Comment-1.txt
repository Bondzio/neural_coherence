i currently have a 750gb pata drive (only about 20-25gb actually used, the rest is free) that i want to clone onto a 300gb velociraptor drive recently purchased for increased performance of my system.
i am going to use arconis true image to clone the disk and i was wondering if anyone had any issues cloning a partition from a larger disk to a smaller disk?
would any data be potentially lost even though the pata drive is only about 20-25gb full right now?
