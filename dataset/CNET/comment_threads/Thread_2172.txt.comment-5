Well with the case open I could clearly tell it was the heat sink that is making the noise.
It was running, but it was making the humming buzzing noise (not sure what best describes it).
I noticed that as pitch of the sound changed, the fan would slow or speed up accordingly.
Will this likely need to be completely replaced?
I glaced at NewEgg just to get an idea on price, and all the compatibility listings confused me.
How do I know what I need to look for?
