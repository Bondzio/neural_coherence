1.1.1	Hi unfortunately i have this problem with my brand new seagate 160GB SATA drive but i 've runned some benchmarks ( freshdiagnose ) with this score : Write 8mb\s , Read 480mb\s .	St
1.1.2	Its a bit frustating seeing this slow write speed compared to the too ( ? )	Ques
1.1.3	high reading speed ...	St
1.1.4	I have the newest drivers ( intel Ultra/Sata storage controllers ) and the whole computer is just 1month old .	St
1.1.5	I 've runned the seatool and it took 4hours to complete with the result of failure of the extended test but it didnt say why ... so it work properly but slow .	St
1.1.6	I checked the main IDE channel it is in UltraDMA5 mode .	St
1.1.7	I have two partitions on it ( 135-15 ) but i dint thin so this make the problems ... How can I make it work on proper speed like 40-50mb/s ?	Ques
1.1.8	I took year to copy my olda data to this drive so i dont want to foramt it again .	St
1.1.9	Specs : Drive - seagate barracuda 7200 ( ST3160811AS ) Windows XP pro s2 1gb ram Intel Pentium 945D 3.4ghz motherboard : MSI 945PL	St
1.2.1	Is the drive a SATA 150 or a 300 ?	Ques
1.2.2	Whuch of the two speeds does your mobo 's SATA support .	St
1.2.3	The Seagates have a jumper if it is a 3.0 Gbps drive and the mobo 's only 1.5 Gbps .	St
1.2.4	Mostly they are shipped with the jumper to limit it to 1.5 , and must be removed .	St
1.2.5	[ just the opposite for WD drives ] The mobo reporting UDMA5 is an error according to Scott Mueller 's book .	St
1.2.6	Upgrading and Repairing PC'sa [ 17th edition ] Quote is from the book .	St
1.2.7	Hope that this does not violate copyright laws .	St
1.2.8	& quot ; Note that because SATA is designed to be backward-compatible with parallel ATA , some confusion can result because SATA drives can report speeds and modes that emulate parallel ATA settings for backwards compatibility .	St
1.2.9	This means the drive is merely lying for backwards compatibility with existing software. & quot ; & quot ; UDMA 5 is is ATA 100 [ parallel ATA mode at 100 MBps ] while the slowest Serial mode [ 1.5 GBps ] is 150 MBps and Ultra DMA modes simply do not apply to Serial ATA drives. & quot ; & quot ; The Serial ATA spec actually requires that the reply to the IDENTIFY DEVICE command are to be set as indicated in ATA/ATAPI 5. & quot ;	St
1.3.1	This is the only one ( +IDE dvd writer ) and the PC is ready made so not i build it , thats mean if i open it ( to change the jumper ) I will lose the warranty ... but who cares i took off the warranty vignette ( of course very carefully so i can replace haha : D ) and removed the jumper .	St
1.3.2	ok motherboard supports 3gb/s as its SATA II and the harddisk also supports 3gb/s but change is resulted with no speed incrase and XP become very unstable ( blue screen of death several times ) I reinstalled the mother chipset drivers with original ones .	St
1.3.3	If i can understand you its not good that my drive is on UDMA5 .. but the bios says its on UDMA6 so i 've reinstalled de IDE drives in device manager ( deleted first IDE channel and restarted ) but it 's stucked on UDMA5.. What can i do ?	Ques
1.4.1	That info is INTENTIONALLY incorrect .	St
1.4.2	That is not the cause of your problem .	St
1.4.3	[ I did NOT say that it was not good that the drive was on UDMA 5 ] Is it possible that that whatever you used for the speed test does not support SATA drives ?	Ques
1.4.4	My reply was basically to tell that the UDMA 5 was not actually correct , but was intentional reported as such by the SATA specification to maintain compatibility with ATA software .	St
1.4.5	That does NOT control the speed of the data transfers , your mobo controller shoud do that .	St
1.4.6	[ actually the controller is on the card inside the drive ] the chipset on the mobo talks to that controller .	St
1.4.7	I erred in not telling you to first go to the Seagate site to verify that your drive came defaulted with the jumper on for the 150 or not .	St
1.4.8	Please go there and enter the drive model to double check the jumpering .	St
1.4.9	If the system got unstable after you removed the jumper , you should check things at the Seagate site .	St
1.4.10	What make and model is your computer ? ?	Ques
1.4.11	I am assuming that you are not using some kind of adapter to use a PATA port to interface the SATA drive .	St
1.4.12	I am NOT an expert on measuring the transfer speed , never bothered to check in 20 years or so .	St
1.4.13	Again , my info was simply to advise you that the UDMA 5 was incorrect but intentional by spec .	St
1.4.14	Hopefully Robert Proffitt or Ed O'Daniel can help .	St
1.5.1	Is the SATA drive connected to an SATA port or IDE port ( with an adapter ) on the motherboard ?	Ques
1.6.1	of course yes its connected to the sata port my pc is ready made from the store Theres nothing with the test but i 've runned some other benchmarks .	St
1.6.2	I can see how slow it is without it ( ex .	St
1.6.3	: flashget mallocing disk space for 150meg for about 2mins ) I 've also downloaded seagate diagnostic program - seatools which says there is something wrong but it doesnt what it is ... Im wondering about : if some settings are wrong if the harddrive is wrong ( i have a warranty ) if the motherboard chipset driver isnt installed correctly ( i 've tried download some new driver from intel but its the same ) if something in the bios incorrect if the operating system sucks	St
1.7.1	Also tell us if you reinstalled the OS .	Sug
1.7.2	Completing a few details such as what 's asked for in the forum note may help .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	I 've bought the PC with this specs : Drive - seagate barracuda 7200 ( ST3160811AS ) SATAII motherboard : MSI 945PL supports SATAIIas I said .	St
1.8.2	Its not from a manufacturer ( like dell or IBM ) the store should have made it from parts but its name 'optimum SPC-8 ' ( - P Dual 3.4 , 2*512Mb 533MHz DDR II , 160Gb 7200rpm Sata2 HDD , FDD , DVD +/-RW , Nvidia 7300GS ) Yes i have reinstalled the OS and then drive speed was just around 3mb/s cuz it was in PIO mod I 've the driver reinstalled so its in UDMA5 then .	St
1.8.3	It think I found out the reason of the freezes could it be because is touched the sata cable ?	Ques
1.8.4	I 've read somewhere this cable is very sensitive .	St
1.9.1	Since it 's 1 month old and store bought how is it that you are having to repair it ?	Ques
1.9.2	Just wondering .	St
1.9.3	So far I do n't see any glaring clue here except maybe a bum OS install .	St
1.9.4	One owner complained to me and we found a pirated XP OS .	St
1.9.5	What to do then ?	Ques
1.9.6	But this is not saying you have such but any clue would be appreciated to see if something that others have seen will show .	St
1.9.7	Bob	St
1.10.1	As far as my os is a legal copy with all the updates provided by microsoft .	St
1.10.2	I will try your suggest and reinstall the OS & quot ; ... ok I removed the jumper ... but the change is resulted with no speed incrase and XP become very unstable ( blue screen of death several times ) ... & quot ; - freezes only happened after i had done this Insted of reinstalling the OS having an other partition with 15GB can help ?	Sug
1.10.3	Install another copy of the os on this partition and will see it will be helpful or I wont need to format the whole harddisk ?	Ques
1.11.1	& quot ; Since it 's 1 month old and store bought how is it that you are having to repair it ?	Ques
1.11.2	& quot ; Because it was slow from the begining and it should , it must work on much higher speed..	St
1.12.1	The blue screen is telling me something 's busted .	St
1.12.2	My XP never does this anymore .	St
1.12.3	I found a bad stick of ram .	St
1.12.4	Bob	St
1.13.1	repair it under warranty .	St
1.13.2	Any hardware can fail at any time .	St
1.14.1	came after he removed the jumper that Seagate normally has on their 3.0 drives to force it to 150 .	St
1.14.2	It is possible that the system assembler had already had the jumper in the proper position and I fouled him up .	St
1.14.3	I tried to tell him that but he probably has some trouble with English .	St
1.14.4	He probably shouild first replace the jumper and then possibly you can suggest a speed test to run .	St
1.14.5	I think that his data seemed weird .	St
1.14.6	I wonder if the Seagate diagnostic was run after the jumper change or before .	St
1.14.7	Certainly he should give the exact text of the Seagate Diagnostic test results .	St
1.15.1	OK i will run seatools - seageta diagnostics tomorrow .	St
1.15.2	The freezes occured by the SATA cable 's berth	St
1.16.1	Simply that the early cables had nothing to hold the connectors mated .	St
1.16.2	Thus they could easily loosen and make poor connections .	St
1.16.3	Now one can buy cables that have a type of catch on them .	St
1.16.4	The ones that come with a mobo still seem to be the ones with no such catch to keep them mated .	St
1.16.5	They really can fall off easily .	St
1.17.1	you need to download and use their PowerMax diagnostic .	St
1.17.2	Powermax generates an 8 digit code IF it is defective .	St
1.17.3	This info and a link to the Powermax is located here : My internal hard drive may be defective , how can I test it ?	Ques
1.17.4	This link will explain the use of the error code : PowerMax Diagnostic Codes - What does the error code mean and what do I do ?	Ques
1.17.5	You appear to have changed your jumper so you might want to look at this graphic to ensure that you now have it proper for the 3 Gbits per sec ( normal ) configuration .	St
1.17.6	In short , NO pins jumpered together : http : //www.seagate.com/images/support/en/us/cuda_sata_block.gif Could also be a problem with native command queuing .	St
1.17.7	Is NCQ enabled or disabled in your BIOS ( or did the drivers you used support or not support it ? )	Ques
1.17.8	for the SATA host controller ?	Ques
1.17.9	http : //www.seagate.com/content/pdf/whitepaper/D2c_tech_paper_intc-stx_sata_ncq.pdf Poor write speeds can also result from conflict between BIOs version and SATA driver versions .	St
1.17.10	Since this is such a recent purchase , I personally would waste no time taking it back and letting them ( whoever built it ) handle the problem .	St
