My question is &quot;What is steel capture?&quot; As to the video watching, playback apps are widely available now so if one player does not do what you want, why not try another? Bob

Sorry but with the misspellings and typographic errors I can barely guess what the questions are. Tablets do not substitute for a camera or camcorder. But keep in mind that any &quot;app&quot; can be replaced so if the supplied app does not do &quot;steel capture&quot; why would we not look for a replacement for better captures of steel images? As of my posting there are 10 more hours on that sale and they were not sold out. Bob

You are using shortened words such as u instead of YOU and then &quot;dat&quot; and &quot;steel capture&quot; without correcting your posts. I can't enter into your point if you don't use English or correct your posts. But if you are asking if the camera has zoom, it's clear from the specifications at http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxytab2/7.0/spec.html?type=find that it does not have zoom or compare with any digital camera or camcorder.
