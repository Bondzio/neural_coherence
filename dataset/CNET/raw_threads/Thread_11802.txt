Does anyone have power consumption or battery life information on the Core solo vs. the Core duo chips? Rumors suggest the new macbook will be in both core solo and duo. I don't plan on doing any major computing projects beyond the occasional iLife project so would one thing I would need the core duo? Is the cpu power vs. battery life difference worth getting the solo over the duo? Does getting a duo over the solo add much in terms of longevity to the latptop?
