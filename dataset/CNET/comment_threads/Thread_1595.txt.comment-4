Are you running the Nozzle check?
If so, does it show anything now that you have replaced the cartridges again.
Be aware, that pulling out a cartridge and putting it back in is a NO NO with an Epson, it can leave a bubble in the nozzle that will not clear up easily.
You really need to clean until you get a complete nozzle check pattern.
At this point, about all you can do is try repeatedly, printing a nozzle check each time.
It should improve with each cleaning.
You can buy cartridges that have cleaning fluid in them, that may fix it.
