<s> I recently bought a Sapphire x1950Pro PCI-E. </s>
<s> I uninstalled my onboard card's drivers,went to the ATI website, updatedd the drivers, got CCC 7.7. </s>
<s> I start up oblivion, change the video settings, start playing. </s>
<s> After about 20 minutes, the game crashes and it shows the &quot;This program has encountered a problem and needs to close&quot; thingy. </s>
<s> then I start half life 2 lost coast. </s>
<s> This time, 5 minutes into the game, it crashes. </s>
<s> I tried theHitman:BM demo and it crashed. </s>
<s> I tried again, and I played it all the way through with no problems. </s>
<s> Then it started geting worse, whenXP started up, some 4 or five programs failed to start up. </s>
<s> Even Internet Explorer crashes every once in a while. </s>
<s> Then it went from &quot;X program has encountered a problem&quot;, to &quot;failed to start X.dll&quot;. </s>
<s> I even got the blue screen that says &quot;Windows has shutdown because of a system error. </s>
<s> If this is the first time you see this screen... blahblahblah&quot; I tried using the MSI Live update to look for updated BIOS but it says that version 1.00 is the latest. </s>
<s> this is my motherboard http://www.msi-computer.ca/product_info.php?cPath=22_35&products_id=63 I've tried a system restore, so it is not a virus. </s>
<s> What else could cause so much crashing? </s>
<s> I am guessing it is my RAM, but I've been using it for 5 months with no problems at all. </s>
<s> Is there some sort of utility that could help me find the problem? </s>
<s> Try re-installing your onboard graphics drivers and re-installing the drivers for your graphics card. </s>
<s> It can't be your RAM if it has never done this before you replaced your GPU. </s>
<s> When I replaced my GPU, all I did was install the new drivers for it and left everything else alone. </s>
<s> the power supply? </s>
<s> You could be stretching it thin there. </s>
<s> Not enough voltage could produce the same results. </s>
<s> Also, make sure the card is seated correctly. </s>
<s> How hot is the system getting? </s>
<s> Another area to look at. </s>
<s> Make sure ALL surfaces are dust free. </s>
<s> Especially the fan blades and fins on the heat sink. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
