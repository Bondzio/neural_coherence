<s> While trying to make a USB boot disk for windows 7, my flash drive stopped working all together. </s>
<s> My computer does not see it at all. </s>
<s> But when I go into command prompt,diskpart,disk list. </s>
<s> It comes up. </s>
<s> when i try to clean it i get a parameter error. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea on how to fix it </s>
<s> It's more or less a hardware issue. </s>
<s> Try another USB-port (front in stead of back or the other way around), another cable, no hub or active hub or passive hub). </s>
<s> There's a good chance one possible combination will work. </s>
<s> But first use another machine to format the drive again and see if it works there. </s>
