I had a similar situation with an external HDD.
My mobo has a USB 1x, I used a USB 2x plugin card.
It worked fine for a few days before this problem cropped up.
It happened on both XP and 98!
Finally, I got rid of the plugin card and started to use the mobo USB.
No prob, no speed.
I think it could have been a hardware failure.
Not sure.
Waiting for more info ......
