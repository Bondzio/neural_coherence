i usually have the printer dhcp at first then latter if i have time set it to some known address on my lan.
you write about using the epson cd but for setting the printer settings on the printer i use the controls on the printer to do that.
and again about the espon cd.
i've found such cds to be out of date even on a new printer.
i always head to epson.com and get their latest.
