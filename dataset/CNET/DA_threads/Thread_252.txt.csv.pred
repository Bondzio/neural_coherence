1.1.1	I have a Compaq PC , 733 mhz , P3 , 128mb RAM , currently running an NVidia TNT2 graphics card .	St
1.1.2	I 'd like to upgrade the graphics , now that there are plenty of used G-Force cards on the market .	St
1.1.3	I play a lot of older games ( Unreal Tournament , Riven , Madden 2002 , Ghost Recon ) , but there are some newer games that I 'd like to get which require a better graphics card .	St
1.1.4	Is there a noticeable difference between a G-Force 2 and G-Force 4 card ?	Ques
1.1.5	Any other suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	To be honest your GFX card upgrade would n't do an awful lot without the memory been upgrading too .	St
1.2.2	I would check out the games you WANT to play and see what the system requirments are .	St
1.2.3	The GeForce 4 is quite a step up from the GeForce 2 , The TNT card were very good in their day like the GF2 Mx 400 's .	St
1.3.1	Do as Matt-Page suggest , add at least another 128MB of RAM before you do anything .	St
1.3.2	It is not hard to do .	St
1.3.3	Check http : //www.crucial.com for what type you will need for your particular PC .	St
1.3.4	Here are some old test of Video Cards that show performance rating under different games .	St
1.3.5	April 2002 http : //graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20020418/vgacharts-01.html # aquanox December 2002 http : //graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20021218/vgacharts-02.html # aquanox I would suggest the GeForce 3 TI-500 , or the GeForce 4 TI-4200 .	St
1.4.1	My nephew has a similar system .	St
1.4.2	But it 's a 1Ghz and 256MB .	St
1.4.3	I fitted a DVDROM drive so he has his own DVD player too .	St
1.4.4	At 733MHz , that 's more than enough for DVD playback , but 128MB will be far too tight .	St
1.4.5	I 'd forget today 's games on such a machine .	St
1.4.6	But 512MB is not a bad idea .	Polite
1.4.7	If you find a CHEAP ! ! !	St
1.4.8	GeForce 2GTS or there abouts , it will deliver about 2X or better the graphic speed , but with that CPU and RAM it will never be a gaming machine except for old titles ( try the year 2000 ) .	St
1.4.9	Bob	St
1.5.1	A very good card .	Polite
1.5.2	Cheap .	St
1.5.3	Need an AGP slot , I 'm not sure if they come connectable to standard PCI slots .	St
1.6.1	GeForce Ti4200 with 64mb and after 2 years of heavy use it still competes with newer cards .	St
1.6.2	I benchmarked ( 3DMarkSE ) against a new ATI 9600 ( 256mb ) and beat it handily .	St
1.6.3	Furthermore this card can be overclocked , however it can get unstable by doing so , so I leave it at the default settings .	St
1.6.4	Just make sure you have the AGP slot like the previous poster said .	Sug
1.6.5	It has a fan so it will drain a bit more power than your old card , I am guessing .	St
1.6.6	GL	St
