I also read about self powered usb hubs could i plug my devices into it and be able to charge them with out having the computer on or having the hub not being pluged into the computer?

PCs that will offer startup by mouse or kbd might do this but I've not seen that on USB. The current isn't generally sufficient for charging with the PC turned off.

What you'd be looking for is how much current they offer versus a standard charger. As well, a good charger will sense the amount of current being drawn and adjust itself accordingly. USB attachment to a PC or non-dedicated charging device may work...or work somewhat...but this isn't a substitute for a proper charger.

Of course there may be a hub that doesn't meet the USB specs. Because of this I picked up a wall mount USB charger. Bob

The key for your needs is the flexibility of various different connections and/or universal one if supplied(adapter?). http://www.cpdocks.com/ Of course, if your university/school uses such, why not see what they use. You may find that such a station may offer to charge only similar same devices because so many devices get used and returned to be charged. tada -----Willy
