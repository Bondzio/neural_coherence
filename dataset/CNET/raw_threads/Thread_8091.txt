My family gets in the internet, used MS Office, does some minor playing around with pictures, really just simple basic stuff. I'm looking for a recommendation on a low end computer desktop (box only) to buy. Does anyone have a suggestion on what to get that fits this user description? We'd like to be in the sub-$600 range too. Thanks all, Mark

Another good brand is Lenovo and for $500 you'll find something nice with either brand. Since you dont need anything fancy, look for something with these specs: * Intel Core i3 -or- Intel Core 2 Duo -or- AMD Athlon II * 3 or 4 Gigabytes of Memory * 500Gb Hard Drive or more * Windows 7 I've read not to bother with any warranty they offer because usually problems occur within the first year and the manufacturer should cover that. Here's a few I've picked out for your price range. Hopefully this helps =) http://www.bestbuy.com/site/HP+-+Pavilion+Desktop+/+AMD+Athlon%26%23153%3B+II+Processor+/+4GB+Memory+/+1TB+Hard+Drive/1757098.p?id=1218289373194&skuId=1757098 http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Lenovo+-+Ideacentre+Desktop+/+Intel%26%23174%3B+Core%26%23153%3B+i3+Processor+/+4GB+Memory+/+1TB+Hard+Drive/1287442.p?id=1218247183355&skuId=1287442
