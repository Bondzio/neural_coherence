win xp sp2 1 gb dual channel ddr3 ram p4 3.8 ghz 400 gb i have d-link dwl-520 wirless adapter installed in on of my pci slots and it was working fine.
unexpectedly, it failed to disable the connection throwing up the error message.
''error disabling connection - it is not possible to diasble the connection at this time.
this connection may be using one or more protocols that do not support plug-and-play, or it may have been initiated by another user or the system account.''
there are two computers on this network but no one else uses them and i have made no changes to the connection settings.
i cannot find an answer to my problem anywhere and any help would be greatly appreciated thanks.
