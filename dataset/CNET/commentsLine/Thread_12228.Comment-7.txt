this idea is thinking the way i want to fix this.
ultimately, i just tweaked the boot order.
one note fwiw, is that when i selected the boot order for the first second and third options, i found that depending on which drive i wanted to boot into, that i had to set all of the options to the same drive, i.e.
first scsi second scsi third scsi in order to ensure that it would take.
i discovered this by accident when it kept failing when i just set it to first hd1 second hd2 third cdrom when i did the above, it would not boot into hd2 or cdrom.
