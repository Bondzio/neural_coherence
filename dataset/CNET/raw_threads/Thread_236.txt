As one of many being totally confused as to which Tablet to buy, after all the usual attempts to eliminate potential &quot;bombs&quot;, the one question I have been unable to have answered, properly is when looking at machines available how do you know if it will have an up-grade from ICS to JB. What has further confused me is just one hour ago reading a punter,s review of a Samsung machine with ICS and he was able to up-grade to JB himself using Kies. So, before buying a particular machine which only carries ICS, how can you tell if an up-grade is possible?

I just bought a Nexus 7 to use in my car as a GPS/entertainment system and I know that has Jelly Bean. You can buy direct from Google or from a store.

In fact I have looked at your suggestions and am interested in buying one but thare are a couple of other machines which also interest me, other than them not having JellyBean. I am still left with the question as to how you can know, in advance, that a machine which only carries ICS may be upgraded to JB soon or at a later date or, if in fact, never. This is really the hub of my question which I would really love someone to answer me. Many thanks.

It warned me I might &quot;lose&quot; some of the apps i'd installed,so I held my breath, but all was ok. Can't say I noticed any change after the upgrade(it told me it had updated successfully), but am still getting used to it anyway. So far i'm loving it!
