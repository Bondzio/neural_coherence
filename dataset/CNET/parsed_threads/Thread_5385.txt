<s> Hello, I have a Linksys WRT54GL v. 1.1 that has been dropping connection speed (starts at 54mb, then drops to 48mbs, 36mbs, 28mbs, down to 1mbs) then disconnects, then reconnects at 54 mbs. </s>
<s> After a short while, it will drop the speed again until it disconnects and reconnects again. </s>
<s> This is the third Linksys WRT54GL that has done this. </s>
<s> The first one was 5 years old before it started doing this in February, the second was 3 months old, and now the replacement Linksys sent to me is doing this? </s>
<s> Does anyone know what is going on with my router? </s>
<s> I am able to connect fine with the Cat5 cable, but wireless seems to be the problem. </s>
<s> Even my phone(s) get disconnected from the wireless router. </s>
<s> This problem just recently started and I don't know why, no settings had been changed on any of the routers until after the problem had already ocurred, then the Linksys phone tech support had me make multiple changes. </s>
<s> That is how wireless works. </s>
<s> If it gets too many errors at a certain speed it will continue to reduce the speed until it gets one that works. </s>
<s> Errors are generally caused by interference. </s>
<s> You many times will still see good signal strength since that does not measure the quality. </s>
<s> You best option is to change the channel until you find one that is more stable. </s>
<s> Finding the source of the interference is tough. </s>
<s> It ranges from microwave ovens to the neighbors routers. </s>
<s> I would next try a different nic on your PC since it might be that end causing the issue. </s>
<s> Last you could try to replace all your equipment (router and nics) with stuff that supports 802.11n. </s>
<s> N is more tolerant of interference than G. Your other option is to buy dual band equipment and move to the 5G band. </s>
<s> While changing the channel is a great idea, if WEP is noted or if someone is trying MAC filters, those old security are now ineffective. </s>
<s> Time to move up to WPA2 if possible. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What is &quot;nic&quot; in reference to my PC and your post? </s>
<s> I know that when I search for wireless connections around my house, I pick up approximately 5 different ones! </s>
<s> I'll try switching channels to see if this helps. </s>
<s> network interface controller. </s>
<s> For laptop the wireless nic is built in for desktops it is mostly a USB device. </s>
<s> The USB wireless nic work on both laptop and desktop. </s>
<s> Since you have already replaced the router it is unlikely a hardware issue. </s>
<s> It is also very unlikely it is a hardware issue with your nic card but it is the cheapest thing to try next. </s>
<s> When you start replacing hardware it generally means you have tried everything else. </s>
<s> If it's an Internet connection then you are sharing that connection with others (contrary to whatever any company tells you). </s>
<s> This is true for cable, DSL, Fios, satellite. </s>
<s> The more people in the pool that you share are on, the slower your connection. </s>
<s> As people disconnect or their activity ceases your bandwidth increases again. </s>
<s> DSLreports.com has a nice speed measuring tool which works not only for DSL. </s>
<s> It is quite reliable. </s>
<s> Use that during different hours of the day. </s>
