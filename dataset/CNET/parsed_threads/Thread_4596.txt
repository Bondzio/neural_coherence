<s> Hi all Just got the NETGEAR - RangeMax Dual-Band Wireless-N and set it up (no issues setting it up, in fact surprisingly easy)and it is set to dual band (2.4 & 5GHz). </s>
<s> House has concrete walls (I know this can mess with the signal) question is. </s>
<s> I get an excellent signal with the 2.4GHz wifi (in the room where I need the laptop working), but the 5GHz signal is not that great. </s>
<s> any thoughts? </s>
<s> The absorption of the signal does vary with the frequency. </s>
<s> It would take a boatload or equipment to measure this but you should... Go with what works best. </s>

<s> I am OK with the 2.4GHz, I was just wondering. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply </s>
<s> http://www.cse.unt.edu/~rakl/Tum05.pdf On page 15 or so you see the range of 5.8GHz to be noted at 200 feet. </s>
<s> The 802.11g 2.4GHz is in the next section and is noted to be 300 feet. </s>
<s> Again the issue here is all about what's in between and what frequencies are absorbed and by how much. </s>
