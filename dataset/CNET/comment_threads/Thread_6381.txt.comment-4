I'm afraid the procedure for exporting your email depends on what you're using for email.
And you've neglected to mention that little detail.
The key word though is EXPORT.
E.g.
with Windows Live Mail, you click the xxxxxx and click export email.
Point it at an empty folder and it'll put all of them in that folder.
Each one is a separate file, but you can put them in a single zipped file and take advantage of compression at the same time.
