<s> Hi, We are having this Deauth and Deassoc flood attacks, and we have also identified that the attacks are coming from the clients themselves. </s>
<s> Example, a client will suddenly start broacasting on the same channel as an AP. </s>
<s> Eventually the AP will be jammed and all clients will be disconnected. </s>
<s> It is like a script running on the machines and it has distributed to several of the clients: The summary is like this: Spoof Mac, construct de-authenticate, de-assoc, packet, send to BROADCAST address. </s>
<s> Bam!The network crashes. </s>
<s> It broadcast with this SSID &quot;InterTocuh GHM Lobby&quot; Any idea of how to remove this? </s>
<s> It has made life unbearable. </s>
<s> AP is dLink DWL-3200. </s>
<s> Clients are XP, Vista and windows 7. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The usual attack software SPOOFS who is doing the attack so you are never sure it is the clients since they can be spoofed. </s>
<s> Usually easy to fix by moving to WPA2. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your prompt response. </s>
<s> We am convinced it is coming from the clients. </s>
<s> Here is scenario: We have 3 APs and all will be working fine, suddenly the wireless manager will show a peer 2 peer device with SSID &quot;InterTouch GHM Lobby&quot; broadcasting at the same frequency as the APs. </s>
<s> At that instant, the associated clients will loose connections. </s>
<s> Now, here is what we did: The &quot;InterTouch GHM Lobby&quot; SSID shows with the signal strenght. </s>
<s> So we used a laptop to trace it until the signal strenght was 100% (it was another laptop). </s>
<s> We shut the laptop down, and the SSID disappeared. </s>
<s> After a while, it came up again and we traced it like before and it landed on another laptop. </s>
<s> As soon as we shut it down, it diappeared. </s>
<s> Out Theory: It seems the DoS attack is running like a script. </s>
<s> It started perhaps with one of the clients, but now has disbritued to other clients (we have counted about 5 so far out of 20 systems). </s>
<s> How do we detect and remove it from the laptops? </s>
<s> Can an Antivirus do it? </s>
<s> What is the approach to stopping it from repeating? </s>
<s> Thanks a million. </s>
<s> I thought we covered this but if your security is WEP or less the spoofing makes it so you think the attack is from your own clients. </s>
<s> I read your post and reply and can't see where you reveal the WIFI security. </s>
<s> If there is some pest on the machines, then you remove that. </s>
<s> It's that simple. </s>
<s> As this company has IT staff you instruct them to do that and if they don't you get them to call the antivirus company, get help or get better IT staff. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks once more and thanks for your patience. </s>
<s> I understand they dont have WEP on the APs. </s>
<s> I will make sure they do that asap (infact today. </s>
<s> Yet, on the clients being involved: I have the following questions, 1. </s>
<s> As it is possible for DoS to be luanched from say a laptop, I used signal strenght to trace the source of the &quot;InterTouch GHM Lobby&quot; SSID to a particular laptop (which is part of the network). </s>
<s> The attack was stopped when I shutdown the laptop. </s>
<s> My conclusion was not based on the MAC address, but based on the 100% signal strenght traced to that particular laptop at that time. </s>
<s> My question is this? </s>
<s> Does the spoofing mean that the signal will appear to be coming from the PHYSICAL LOCATION of the client? </s>
<s> If yes, then that might be it. </s>
<s> If no, then we still got problems. </s>
<s> Also, can the everyday antivirus softwares like Karpasky detect and remove DoS Trojans? </s>
<s> Thanks once more for every of your assistance. </s>
<s> Sincerely, Cosmas </s>
<s> WEP or less means that the SPOOF (did you notice the SPOOF in your first post? </s>
<s> I did!) </s>
<s> can lead you you to think that YOUR clients are at fault. </s>
<s> The fix is easy and that is to move to WPA. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> YES. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Spoofing is just that. </s>
<s> I can't duplicate the web content or write a paper about this here. </s>
<s> The reason is simple. </s>
<s> I type my replies and the content is out there for the taking. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Since the wifi is insecure there are easy, kid friendly softwares that can cause this issue and make it look like it's the company machines. </s>
<s> Sadly this many replies and it looks like we are where we started. </s>
<s> Is it possible to share what security is in place? </s>
<s> Also, the forum advises AGAINST SSID names like that. </s>
<s> If you go against that advice I tend to get a little deaf. </s>
<s> This is not that I don't care, but having solved too many systems with this issue it seems like it's easier to wait for the user/owner to soften up so they are more receptive to the forum sticky advice. </s>
<s> Again, let's hope securing the wifi with WPA helps. </s>
<s> Again, the forum sticky has this advice if you need more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Dear Bob, Thanks a million. </s>
<s> The problem now is that they are using dLink DAP-3220 and DWL-3200, both have the WAP ability, but they require a Radius Server: They dont have a Radius Server for now. </s>
<s> Is there a Radius Server software that can work on windows xp? </s>
<s> I have googled with luck. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Then no radius server. </s>
<s> This should be in the forum sticky. </s>
<s> But many try the option that requires the server. </s>
<s> I can't know why. </s>
<s> Be careful in our acronym use. </s>
<s> WAP means something other than WPA. </s>
