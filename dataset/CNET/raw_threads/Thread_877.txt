I currently have almost 50 gigs and plan to add more from my CD and album collections. My Windows Media Player stopped working, so I'm dealing with that as well as looking to buy a new computer to replace my Pentium 4. At the moment, my music files are all intact. I've been backing up everything on a 350 gig WD external hard drive, but after reading all the negative stuff about externals, I'm at a loss. Should I buy one or two more externals and keep copies in two locations? Is on-line storage reliable in the long run? Any suggestions would be much appreciated!

(2 1TB drives for me and i have a 750 already internal that i will use for this.) Keeping one external offline but local and only putting it on when needed to backup (weekly?), and the other offsite (Quarterly). (both in decent fireproof boxes) The offsite is overkill but I would rather be safe then sorry.
