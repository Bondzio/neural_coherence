1.1.1	I have a P4 2GHz , 2.5GB RAM , PNY GeForce 8600 GT ( w/ 256MB RAM ) , and I am using a 32 & quot ; HDTV .	St
1.1.2	I bought the card when I upgraded my old PC to some new super PC about a year ago .	St
1.1.3	About 5 months ago I noticed that when I play games like Crysis , HL2 , Age of Conan , Left 4 Dead , Dead Space , and Day of Defeat : Source .	St
1.1.4	I have been monitoring the temp of the video card and it idles at about 56-58c and when under high stress it goes up to 80 .	St
1.1.5	PNY tech support said that the card normal operating temp is up to 100c .	St
1.1.6	I tested my RAM with MemTest over 6 hours straight and it found 0 errors .	St
1.1.7	I used the nVidia nTune Stress Test and it finds no errors , but I do n't know if that counts for anything .	St
1.1.8	Anyone have any ideas what is causing the lines ?	Ques
1.1.9	BTW I do get some artifacting also .	St
1.1.10	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Type 8600 DEFECTIVE At google ?	Ques
1.3.1	Thanks for your quick response .	St
1.3.2	When I type that in i find articles on defective 8600M , the mobile cards , no mention of the 8600 GT .	St
1.3.3	Did n't help , but thank you for your response .	Polite
1.4.1	The 8400 and 8600 on PCIE cards are dying .	St
1.4.2	I 'd make the call and see if they 'll replace yours sooner than later .	St
1.5.1	if you registered the card with pny , you have a 3 year warranty and can rma it to them ( http : //www.pny.com/ ) .	St
1.5.2	otherwise , start shopping for a new card .	St
1.6.1	What do you think it is ?	Ques
1.6.2	Could it be the Onboard RAM ?	Ques
1.6.3	Should I get another PNY card , Ive never had problems with any other their other products .	St
1.7.1	Nothing remarkable but the issue was NOT their making .	St
1.7.2	I 'm unsure why some need the board to do more than what you reported to motivate them to get it replaced .	St
1.7.3	At least I know the issue and can get it changed out before this company goes under .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	I started the RMA form .	St
1.8.2	I keep boxes and receipts for everything I own for about 6 months after I buy an item .	St
1.8.3	So I have thrown away the receipt and the box , I believe I do have it registered , but no way to show this fact , because I ca n't get anyone on the phone at PNY 's offices to corroborate this .	St
1.8.4	Long story shorter , I ca n't return it for RMA .	St
1.8.5	Guess I will have to buy a new one and take the lesson learned .	St
1.9.1	Is a lot of denials all around as the body count keeps rising .	St
1.9.2	For now , for today any 8400 , 8600 M or not is an avoid and in my opinion & quot ; no sale. & quot ; Bob	St
1.10.1	Yea , I did finally get a hold of someone over there that wanted to help me figure out what is happening , he said since I ran the nTune Stress Test and it passed fine that it is likely nothing at all wrong with the card .	St
1.10.2	HE suggested taking a spare HDD and loading windows , the drivers , and one game and try it taht way to rule out some software ( like Norton ) isnt the root of the issue .	St
1.10.3	I 'll going to work on that later on , let you know what is happening .	St
1.10.4	Thanks again	St
