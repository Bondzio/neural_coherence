We've talked about who makes the best equipment, and what to look for when choosing that equipment...now it's time to go shopping! So, here's my next question: In your personal opinion, what is the absolute best place and/or way to buy quality hardware at the best possible price? Is NewEgg the best? How about Ebay? Should we shop Tiger Direct, or Crazy Bob's House of Hardware? Is &quot;white box&quot; stuff worth the extra effort? And how about those sales we should probably all be watching for? When is a deal really a deal? Any tips and/or tricks would be greatly appreciated! There will be no votes in this thread--and no winners will be declared. I just want to hear what everyone has to say. Sincerely, JDM (*I hope CNET's international readers will share their favorite suppliers, tips and tricks as well. People have to shop for hardware in Australia, Britain, Canada...and everywhere else, too. So tell us what you know!)

2633	7	102102	1174374	1171379	culture_of_one	5/6/05 4:53 PM	1.11539838E12	Personally...	I use OEM (a.k.a. &quot;White Box&quot;) parts. For those of you who don't already know--white box parts are what large producers use. They usually come without any cables or manuals, and have a 3 month guarantee at best. For me, the prices are great--so I don't really mind scrounging up a few cables and downloading the necessary info/software from the web. I get my stuff from what you might call &quot;warehouse stores&quot;...although I think &quot;garage stores&quot; might give you a better idea of what they actually look like. I get sales/price info from local &quot;computer rags&quot; and off the web. JDM (*OEM parts are nicknamed &quot;white box&quot; parts because they usually come in plain white boxes.) (**OEM stands for &quot;Original Equipment Maker/Manufacturer&quot;--if anyone really wanted to know.)

Well, I guess hardware heaven isn't so hard to reach after all! JDM (*A few more &quot;shopping tips&quot; for the average muggle would be appreciated. How safe is shopping online? Is there any way to make it safer?)
