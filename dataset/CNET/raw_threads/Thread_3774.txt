What does Disk Management (that's a program in Windows) say about that partition? My guess: Disk Management says it's unallocated (then make a partition on the available space) or it needs to be formatted (then do that). In both cases you'll only lose what you didn't backup. That should only be a few files. If it's more, consider using a data recovery program to see what it can recover and copy to your other partition or an external disk. Kees
