<s> Hi, My computer crashed in the night and when i try to restart it i get the message that windows did not shut down properly.... and asks how i should start windows - safe mode, last known config, normal ect. </s>
<s> Regardless of which of these a choose the boot fails and the computer restarts. </s>
<s> In safe mode, the last line it shows is the driver agp440.sys. </s>
<s> I have tried the recovery console to disable this driver but lstsvc doesnt list anything and i can't disable agp440 via &quot;disable agp440&quot;. </s>
<s> If i try and reinstall windows, in the list of available discs to install to, the harddrive isn't there. </s>
<s> I can't figure out if the drive has just had it or not. </s>
<s> It just doesnt make sense that it can load a bunch of drives during boot, but yet it doesn't reconised the drive at all in installation. </s>
<s> Any help with this matter would be great. </s>
<s> Im running win xp pro sp2. </s>
<s> Try running with only one memory stick. </s>
<s> Can you boot into the BIOS? </s>
<s> It's like Delete or one of the &quot;F&quot; keys, like F12 or something. </s>
<s> If you get there, is the hard drive seen there? </s>

<s> no i cant see it in the bios </s>
<s> Did using only one memory stick help? </s>
<s> Try checking the cables for the hard drive. </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> you to Google. </s>
<s> Your answer might be here: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1B2GGGL_en__177&q=agp440.sys and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Nice find. </s>
<s> I might have been away too long, lol! </s>
