Okay, I get I should apologize, or something, for saying the details of my existing router are not important.
I only wrote that since SMC says my router, and none of their routers, will do what I want.
SYSLOG is new to me, so I'm reading up on it.
You're suggesting that somehow by using SYSLOG, the IP addresses which are logged in my apache access log file (and by extension the IP addresses sent to applications like phpbb) will be the actual external IP addresses of the clients accessing my server instead of the IP address of my server itself?
thanks.kah
