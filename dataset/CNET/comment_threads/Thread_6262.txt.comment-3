Thanks for the response.
It seems that the SMPS was faulty.
I concluded this from the fact that the clicking Sata HDD worked perfectly when attached to another SMPS.
Anyways, I'm not relying on the HDD and a backup is in progress.
Apart from this, I had attached another PATA HDD to the faulty SMPS to check and after being detected, it stopped spinning after 5 seconds and has now completely stopped functioning even with another SMPS.
The &quot;Smooth&quot; chip is getting overheated in this HDD and the motor seems lifeless.
I guess i blew the smooth chip and am now stuck with a bricked HDD
