Hello, my husband just bought a gateway notebook computer for home and travel use.
Went into this without really knowing much about notebooks, but he really wanted one (happy early father's day to him :-)) Anyway....where do we start about getting wireless internet?
What do we need to buy?
We have a one level house currently using DSL (Roadrunner) for our 2 desktops.
Should we get wireless through Roadrunner?
Someone mentioned said NO...use wireless cards?????
Any information would be appreciated.
Thanks
