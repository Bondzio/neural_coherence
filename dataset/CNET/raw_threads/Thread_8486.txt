The system started getting slower and slower and would lock up at times. I would have to hit reset to get back up. I ran all the necessary scans on the system and found nothing. After a few more lockups, I took it to my shop thinking I had bad memory. Changed to new memory and no change. When turned on one time, I heard a &quot;pop&quot; in the area of the PS. Installed new PS and no change in system performance. Ran the Windows task mgr and under performance saw that CPU usage would spike to 95% most of the time and I had nothing running. I disconnected the network cbl and the usage dropped to 5% MAX. Everything worked fast again. Put cbl back in and I was back to the same bad performance with 95%+ CPU usage when nothing was running. I have reinstalled the XP upgrade several times with no change. Thinking it might be the 10/100 adapter on the mobo, I put in a PCI card and disabled all the other adapters. Same problem. I am at a total loss here. Any help would be great! Thanks in advance.

Saw on another site that this update would &quot;update&quot; the whole mobo. Not sure what the video card has to do with it. The network worked ok before this problem started and the video card has not changed.
