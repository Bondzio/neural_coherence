Just now i finished with the Checking Disk and also Defragmentation, but the problem still occurs.
It copies to a certain limit and it freezes, Light on the HDD blinking very fast, the &quot;Time remaining&quot; says &quot;calculating...&quot; and the &quot;Speed&quot; stays as 135MB/sec without any change.
