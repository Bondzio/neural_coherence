<s> I got a new SD card a while ago for my camera. </s>
<s> The built in card reader in my epson printer displays a picture of a memory card with a zig zag line across it implying that the card is corrupted. </s>
<s> However, I can view the pictures on the camera and can transfer normally to the computer using a USB to the camera. </s>
<s> However, the card reader is much more convenient. </s>
<s> I have formatted the card using the camera's function and that did nothing. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Some printers had limitations. </s>
<s> It's 4GB and I have tested it with only one photo on it, so it's not like there is a huge amount of data on it. </s>
<s> It has slots for 6 different types of card and I have previously used it with a Memory Duo Pro (or whatever that long Sony one is called) successfully. </s>
<s> The printer is only a couple of years old. </s>
<s> It is an Epson Stylus Photo RX520 (which is similar to the RX500: http://reviews.cnet.com/multifunction-devices/epson-stylus-photo-rx500/4505-3181_7-30604037.html?tag=prod.txt.1 ) </s>
<s> High Capacity. </s>
<s> You are lucky your camera supports this. </s>
<s> You might have had better luck with the 2GB which is just SD and not SDHC. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I didn't think about that. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
