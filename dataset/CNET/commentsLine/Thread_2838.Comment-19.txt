i have formatted the drive in ntfs and when i select ntfs in disk management to format it will not let me change the default size of 32gb.
like i said before, i formatted the drive on my old pc and it formatted to 400gb and installed windows xp sp2 and worked fine on that computer but when i put it in my drive case it only shows up as 32gb and says it's not formatted, did the same thing on my brother's computer and his is a brand new dell.
i also tried his external case and had no luck.
it's mind boggling but i don't know what else to do at this point.
i've check the jumper settings, tried different cases, tried on different computers, and have formatted in ntfs.
the drive has never been formatted in fat32.
