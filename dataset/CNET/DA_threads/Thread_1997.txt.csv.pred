1.1.1	We have a modem connected to a Cisco 506E PIX firewall , connected to a 25-port Cisco switch .	St
1.1.2	We 're using the PIX as the DHCP server .	St
1.1.3	One server machine ( functioning as DNS server , etc . )	St
1.1.4	connected to the switch , 23 wired desktop connections , and two Netgear wireless access points .	St
1.1.5	The APs have the DHCP function turned off .	St
1.1.6	Here 's the problem - I can connect multiple PCs to each AP , but only one PC per AP can be connected to the server and internet at a time .	St
1.1.7	I need to be able to connect multiple PCs to the server/internet via these APs !	St
1.1.8	I 've configured the same wireless APs elsewhere at our remote sites with no problem - but they were connected via a router to a modem - no server or PIX involved .	St
1.1.9	Any suggestions on how to troubleshoot ?	Ques
1.2.1	I assume these are true AP and not routers .	St
1.2.2	This would mean that each device would pass its own mac address up the path .	St
1.2.3	First I would check the firewall logs to make sure you are not getting anything denied via rule .	St
1.2.4	Since I assume your wired PC work I doubt this is the problem .	St
1.2.5	Just a guess but I would suspect a port security setting on the switch .	St
1.2.6	One of the many option in cisco is to allow only a single mac on a port .	St
1.2.7	The switch should produce error messages into the log .	St
1.2.8	You can also do a show mac-address command on the ports you are having issues with .	St
1.2.9	You should see multiple macs assigned to that port .	St
1.3.1	Thanks , Bill - I 've checked the firewall and there do n't seem to be issues there ; and as far as the APs - one is a true AP , the other a router configured as an AP .	St
1.3.2	I 've spent lots of time chasing my tail on the router configuration , but I 'm pretty sure it 's solid .	St
1.3.3	I think you 've got me pointed in the right direction with switch configuration , which I have n't checked out at all .	St
1.3.4	The company that installed the switch ( before my time ) never set up an interface for it , so I 'll do that over the weekend and see if there are settings that will fix the problem .	St
1.3.5	I 'm an accidental techie working for a nonprofit with serious budget constraints , so really appreciate your help .	St
