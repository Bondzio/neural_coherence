Where's the second and third copy? 3. Same failure modes (actually more) as the hard disk in the PC. While an external drive makes a fine &quot;copy&quot; it fails the classic criteria for &quot;backup.&quot; Do you have a DVD recorder? My entire photo collection fits on on DVDRW. My other stuff fits on 2 other DVDRWs. Cost? A few dollars. And I have multiple copies. Bob
