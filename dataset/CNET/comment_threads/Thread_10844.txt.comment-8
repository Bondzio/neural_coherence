that &quot;partitioning and formatting&quot; simply means a complete instal of the operating system and other applications and all that involves - and that's it???
From all I have read on this subject, I have always thought that when they were talking about &quot;partitioning and formatting&quot; they were talking about something that was completely different from anything I have experienced.
Thanks so much again for helping me see the light on this.
