Are you sure that you aren't getting 6 GB lost by converting from bytes to Gigabytes?
If 1024 Bytes = 1 Kilobyte, 1024 Kilobytes = 1 Megabyte, and 1024 Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte, then 1,073,741,824 bytes = 1 Gigabyte and so, 80,000,000,000 bytes = 74.50580596923828125 GB which is where you are getting 74 GB from as I have a couple machines with similar drives.
