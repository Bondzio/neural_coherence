well i went into bios and i got to a screen that showed the cpu frequency at 200 and underneath that it had a ratio of 6:5 to ram of 166 mhz i couldn't find anything that said &quot;fsb&quot; or &quot;front side bus&quot; anywhere.
where in bios am i supposed to find it?
is it the ram setting underneath that needs to be higher?
