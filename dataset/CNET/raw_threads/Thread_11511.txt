4855	0	136131	1533200	NR	smierdiakow	11/12/05 10:30 AM	1.1317914E12	Need advice on buying a new PC. Have NO IDEA what to buy.	Don't know anything about computers except that I use them on daily basis. I don't want to spend more than $800-900. Have DSL. Want to be able to burn cds, download pictures, need Word, Excel, internet access. What can/should I get? I don't need sth. incredible, but sth. that would last me for the next 5 years and be fast, and NOT FREEZE all the time. Thanks so much for your help.

As far as the software is concerned...unless you absolutely positively need the real deal, just use OpenOffice 2.0. Regards, VAPCMD
