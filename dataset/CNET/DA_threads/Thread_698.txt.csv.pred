1.1.1	I 'm looking to buy a hp laptop , for use mainly in school , and maybe some gaming here and there ( Warcraft 3 , civ 4 , oblivion if I 'm lucky , but probably not ) .	St
1.1.2	Anyway , I was wondering if there 's a huge difference between have a hard drive with 5400 rpm , and a hard drive with 7200 rpm .	St
1.1.3	Considering what I 'd be doing , would it have a huge effect ?	Ques
1.1.4	I was also wondering if you could tell me if my other specs look good .	St
1.1.5	They look fine to me , but I 'd like a second opinion .	St
1.1.6	- Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) 2 Duo Processor T6500 ( 2.1GHz , 2MB L2 Cache , 800MHz FSB ) - 3GB DDR2 System Memory ( 2 Dimm ) - 32-bit vista ( will upgrade to win 7 ) - Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 4500MHD ( I 'm unsure about this card , I know it could n't run Oblivion , but could it run Civ 4 an Warcraft 3 ) Thank you	St
1.2.1	While the difference is there its hardly noticeable .	St
1.2.2	For all intends and purposes only under intense work cycles will it be noted and even then it depends on the task .	St
1.2.3	Actually , for laptop usage , slower speed is desirable as a safety measure of sorts .	St
1.2.4	The choice is yours .	St
1.2.5	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
1.3.1	My kid has that 4500 in a Toshiba .	St
1.3.2	What runs is pretty amazing .	Polite
1.3.3	Much more than I would have thought .	St
1.3.4	If you have to get a value machine , I 'm giving this chipset the nod .	St
1.3.5	About drive RPM .	St
1.3.6	The balance in laptops would be the 5400 RPM .	St
1.3.7	I wo n't write any long dialog about this but it 's where I like to be .	St

1.4.1	Would 1 MB for the L2 cache be enough ?	Ques
1.4.2	I know vaguely what L2 cache does , but what does it and front side bus do specifically ?	Ques
1.5.1	Frankly , you go get benchmarks and use a big fat black marker on the size of L2 Cache .	St
1.5.2	The benchmarks matter .	St
1.5.3	Not the L2 cache size .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	I 'm ordering a custom laptop from hp .	St
1.8.1	I 'd go 7,200 RPM .	St
1.8.2	The other thing you may want to consider is whether you get a matte finish ( anti-glare ) or gloss ( highly reflective ) screen with the laptop .	St
1.8.3	I strongly recommend the matte finish as it eliminates glare and reflection coming from anywhere and everywhere .	Sug
1.8.4	If you 're getting Vista ... I recommend getting the 64 bit version and that you should get a free upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit .	St
1.8.5	Let us know how it turns out .	St
1.8.6	VAPCMD While I 'm not 100 % sure it has a matte ( anti-glare ) screen , this HP laptop looked pretty interesting to me .	St
1.8.7	Downside it is what it is ... . no options although you could change/replace the drive .	St
