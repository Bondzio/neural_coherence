I ran the installation disk as stated. I have Cox high speed internet with cable modem. My phone is attached to the modem. (bundle package) phone/internet/cable tv. After setting up router I get no internet access/internet not detected. My PS3 reads the netgear is there but at 55% signal strength. What next?

See here http://playstation.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/playstation.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=238 Your PS3 has a built in NIC card. I recommend you use the wired connection anyway.

NOW: CPU---CABLE (COX) MODEM---PHONE----with cable cord going into modem from wall. AFTER: CPU---ROUTER----CABLE (COX) MODEM----PHONE----with cable cord going into modem from wall Before, after the reconfigure the link light on modem went out. So after a week and being frustrated from not being able to play SOCOM for PS3 (ONLINE ONLY GAME wtf) I just added a USB from modem to CPU (so I have two connections to CPU--MODEM) I will just try USB after work....But the PS3 shows the NETGEAR router at 47% to 55% signal strenghtjust can't get internet light to light up on Router....I change IP address from another thread I seen on CNET and still nothing.... You call COX and get &quot;We don't support NETGEAR&quot; and you call NETGEAR and you can here LOCAL TV stations saying it's 80 degrees here in Mumbai, India today...

I just added the USB and for some reason the &quot;Link&quot; or internet cable light stayed on.....Before that, when I followed the disk with the NETGEAR router it would cut off....I live in a small Louisiana town but I was able to find 3 computer fixer companies that will come out and take a look. Since COX cable do not tech support NETGEAR...
