Currently have wireless broadband from a local isp.
Signal goes through outside antenna to alvarion breezeaccess box to wireless router.
Each pc has a wireless adapter.
Thinking of switching to Verizon wireless.
The Verizon wireless modem would be usb.
Can I send the broadband signal from Verizon's usb modem through a pc to the wireless router?
Running windows 2000.
