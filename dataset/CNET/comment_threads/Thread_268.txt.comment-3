Thanks Bill - Correct, I don't want to run wires all over the house.
The Ethernet to wireless bridge sound like what I want to do.
Would the Linksys WET610N or similar be the device I would need.
Also, do you know if they make one of these with multi-port?
Since I'm hooking up the Dish receiver, if there is a multi-port device I could use the same device to hook-up the Blu-ray and TV.
I didn't think about those yesterday.
Again, thanks for the help.
