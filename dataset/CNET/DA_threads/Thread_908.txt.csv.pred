1.3.1	Would be nice if you could just give it to them ... used PCs are n't usually worth much used and given all they 've done for you , that 's my first recommendation .	St
1.3.2	If they absolutely refuse to accept it gratis ... ..then price it as a 3 yr old PC with no warranty ( and too little RAM ) relative to the cost of current technology replacement .	St
1.3.3	Given you can get a current technology PC from Dell for $ 500 or $ 600 ( US ) ... $ 150 is probably all that 's reasonable .	St
1.3.4	And if that 's all you can get for it .	St

1.3.6	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	or any comparable Canadian second hand site .	St
