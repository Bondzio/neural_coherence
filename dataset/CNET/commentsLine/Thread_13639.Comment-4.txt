i know this post is old but my brother and i have the same printers and bought them at the same time.
he is having the exact same problem as described above we switched printer sand mine is working on his computer.
i searched alot of forums but no one has an answer.
do you ???
this is what it is doing the printer just continuously tries to restart itself without success, then shuts down for a couple seconds, then tries to turn on again.
i cannot even estabish a computer connection as well.
the display screen shows hp logo with the load bar trying to load and then it freezes then tries to restart again.
i check and did all the obvious here to troubleshoot but no prevail.
should i take it to best buy geeks
