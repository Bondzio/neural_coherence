1.1.1	My 89-year-old mother wants desperately to have & quot ; a copying machine & quot ; so she can copy family documents and photos to distribute to relatives before she dies .	St
1.1.2	She wo n't go near a computer , although she will use a photocopier .	St
1.1.3	My question : Is there a personal copier for $ 200 or so which will operate as a standalone item , i. e. , without a computer connection ?	Ques
1.1.4	It would need to be compact enough for her to use in her room .	St
1.1.5	It would need to be easy to use , with clearly marked controls .	St
1.1.6	The device only needs to scan and print , nothing fancy .	St
1.2.1	Around here we have Office Max , Staples and such stores that would be a fine place to see what 's out there .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Very basic copiers exist , try looking at Canon or Xerox models for & quot ; stand alone & quot ; operation .	St
1.3.2	However , you mention $ 200 and that really is too low , maybe more into the $ 400 range if you 're lucky .	St
1.3.3	You best bet is to check any decent office outlet center or go online even those same office centers .	St
1.3.4	Of course , you look into a rental/lease for a month or more and see if that 's possible but have all your ducks in a row in order to make the best use out of it .	St
1.3.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
