<s> I was unaware that the HP m1050y has 2x pci-express x16 slots...It doesn't. </s>
<s> It only has a single ATI X600. </s>
<s> No real advantage, as there will eventually be a newer single card that will beat 2 old cards. </s>

<s> There is not much point having 2x X600's if it's performance you're looking at go for a better card all-together, I'd get an X800 or if your feeling saucy get a X850XT. </s>
<s> They'll beat your X600 hands down. </s>
<s> What I meant was is there an advantage to having 2 cards in general. </s>
<s> Is there a noticeable difference between 1 x600 and 2 of them? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
