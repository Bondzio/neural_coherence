The company I work for has agreed to upgrade my monitor. I was always under the impression the the CRT monitor is better on the eyes than a LCD doing this kind of work. I've been getting mixed answers on this issue. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

The real culprit IMHO is room lighting as it will really deminish the value of any viewing screen. While 17in. seems big, most use 19in, if not bigger to best do CAD. I believe here the value of larger viewing screen offers more, regardless of LCD or monitor. Overall, you get tired eyes from either viewing source. good luck -----Willy

Seriously, I do the same kind of work and what you need is _high resolution_ as well as a physically large display. CRT is the best for resolution but LCD is catching up. Dell has a very nice 20&quot; LCD that will do 1600x1200 pixels. It's usually around $650 but often on sale for $550. If your cheapskate boss wont spring for that, you are better off getting a 22&quot;CRT at $350 to $450. NEC and Sony both make good ones. Don't bother with smaller LCD because they will only display 1280x1024. CRT vs LCD is a personal preference thing. It's nice to not have a 70lb CRT on your desk but you can't stack stuff on top of a LCD. Good luck.

We'll let me expand, We picked up a Viewsonic P225, The first one fizzed out after 10 min. the second 1/3 of the screen is blurred not real bad but not what it should be. I've been out looking locally and no one seems to be stocking the large CRT's any more, I think what I'll go out pick up a 20&quot; LCD and try it out, I'll know after a day or two and if I dont like it I'll take it back.
