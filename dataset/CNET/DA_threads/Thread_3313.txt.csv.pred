1.1.1	I shut down my desktop computer last night and a few hours later went to start it back up .	St
1.1.2	When I hit the button to turn it back on nothing happened .	St
1.1.3	I 've checked the surge protector , outlet , power cable to the back of the tower , and the connection to the surge protector .	St
1.1.4	There is a green light on the back of the tower located by where the power cord plugs in and when I push the power button on the front of the computer it lights up but the computer does n't seem to start booting up .	St
1.1.5	Also when I shut it down last night it did n't make any odd noises and I did n't smell anything like an ozone smell or a burning smell .	St
1.1.6	Any ideas and or help would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.7	Thank you all .	St
1.2.1	You did n't say anything about computer type , hardware , etc .	St
1.2.2	But from the description of the issue it sounds like a PSU failure , that would be my first guess .	St
1.2.3	You can purchase a tester or take it to a shop , it is an easy test to do with the right test equipment .	St
1.2.4	If it is a PSU failure it is usually a fairly easy fix , just replace PSU .	St
1.2.5	Unless it is a very old system it is typically worth doing .	St
