<s> See ya. </s>
<s> you'll be able to play most games released before 2007 (oblivion, prey, fear, call of duty 2, etc) on medium detail at 1024x768 or lower. </s>
<s> it will struggle with this year's titles (world in conflict, company of heroes, bioshock, etc) though and you'll need to replace it for crysis and hellgate. </s>
<s> as a rule of thumb, if you want to play current games at high detail levels and/or high resolution, budget at least $150 for a video card. </s>
