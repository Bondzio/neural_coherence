i'd suspect the power supply first, but my experience with gateway has been that they use very flaky components.
as a circumvention, you could try using hibernation instead of complete shutdown.
i bought a gateway desktop in 2006 and within weeks the keyboard crapped out.
then after a year's use the monitor went.
shortly after 3 years the system wouldn't boot and gateway didn't have the parts to fix it, so they referred me to a 3rd party that wanted $200 for a motherboard.
i removed the hard drive and put it in another desktop i built and have avoided gateway ever since.
good luck.
