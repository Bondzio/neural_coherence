<s> I would like to have my desktop PC interact with my netbook. </s>
<s> They are both connected (wired) to a LinkSys 2.4 Router. </s>
<s> What and how is the best way to connect them? </s>
<s> When I go to establish a home network it asks if I want to share the printer and folders. </s>
<s> I want to share folders but only from one computer to the other not to the Internet. </s>
<s> I just want two computer to talk to each other. </s>
<s> From each machine you control the level of access. </s>
<s> Since only you know the Operating System of each machine, you'll have to dig a little. </s>
<s> Thank you for your response. </s>
<s> I tried to set up both computers but nothing happened. </s>
<s> I do not have much patience, when it is something that does not matter one way or the other, so I gave up. </s>
<s> Just have too much time on my hands. </s>
<s> If you don't have the patience why not have this done for you? </s>
<s> Call up some local talent and tell them what you want done. </s>
<s> Then have them tell you when it's working so you don't have to wait or invest personal time in the effort. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for your suggestion. </s>
<s> I continued to play around with this set up and discovered that on the desktop I can access the netbook by accessing the &quot;workgroup&quot;. </s>
<s> On the netbook I can access the desktop with &quot;network places&quot;. </s>
<s> I do not know if that is the best or correct way but I have been able to transfer data and that is what I wanted to do. </s>
<s> When I delete a folder in the &quot;Share Document&quot; folder it does not delete the original, does it? </s>
<s> Make a backup copy to another folder and then delete one. </s>
<s> The shared document when deleted does delete the original here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for the suggestions. </s>
<s> I found out the hard way about deleting but was able to recover it. </s>
<s> I think I am getting the hang of this. </s>
