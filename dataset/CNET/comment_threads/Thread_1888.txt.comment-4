I am not trying to bridge anything.
I am trying to disable the bridge but as shown in the pictures there is no bridge icon.
That prevents me from disabling the &quot;bridge&quot; or seperately modifying the adapters to turn off the ICS option.
I would like to stop this bridge so i can configure my netowrk adapters.
