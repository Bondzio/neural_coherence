<s> Greetings: After my #1 firewall router died recently, I bought a BEFVP41 so I could ''dial into'' (via VPN) my home LAN while on the road. </s>
<s> Setting up the BEFVP41 at least *seemed* easy. </s>
<s> Getting a XP client going was another story. </s>
<s> Getting to see/ping/use network shares is the #1 problem now. </s>
<s> The BEFVP41 only supports IPSec tunnels, which configuring under XP is a ROYAL PAIN, after scanning a number of forums about VPN's I decided on trying a ''VPN Client'' solution instead of using the built in but dreadfully painfull client support in XP. </s>
<s> If you search HIGH and LOW about the internet, you may find ''SSHSentinel 1.3.2''. </s>
<s> This VPN client is free for non-comercial use. </s>
<s> It was easy to setup this client to connect to my BEFVP41. </s>
<s> However, once setup it automaticly loads on system startup and reroutes all network traffic to the VPN (existing or not), thereby breaking network connections when you are not using a VPN. </s>
<s> (I ended up uninstalling it as I'm %99 NON-VPN and might use VPN %1 of the time.) </s>
<s> ''Greenbow_VPN'' is another solution spoken about in many forums. </s>
<s> This client was easy to setup to connect to my BEFVP41, however the public license is only for a ''30-60 day trial''. </s>
<s> I uninstalled it. </s>
<s> After much searching, I came across the ''Draytek'' VPN client. </s>
<s> Written by Draytek in China for their brand of VPN routers, this client loads a device driver as part of its client solution. </s>
<s> The driver comes up as another ''network connection'' under XP. </s>
<s> The NICE part about all this is that the client program/driver will create network configuration changes ''on the fly'' thereby NOT breaking connections when the VPN is not in use. </s>
<s> This was also easy to setup to connect to my BEFVP41. </s>
<s> When the tunnel is active/connected, the client application will show a little ''green light'' indicator and the connection will not have a RED X ontop of it in the system tray. </s>
<s> Pretty cool. </s>
<s> So what does all this have to do with ''network shares over a VPN?'' </s>
<s> In all cases, while I was able to get the clients to work (connect) with my Linksys VPN router, I was unable to access the VPN Router or any of the network shares attached to it. </s>
<s> I finally decided that my routing tables must not be setup correctly to route to&lt;=&gt;from my LAN addresses through the VPN tunnel. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Client Address &lt;=&gt; Server Address 65.mylaptop &lt;=&gt; 66.mylan 2. </s>
<s> Client Secure Group &lt;=&gt; Server Secure group 192.168.2.0 &lt;=&gt; 192.168.2.0 This dident work. </s>
<s> I read somewhere that the LAN segments on both ends needed to be different. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Client Secure Group &lt;=&gt; Server Secure group 192.168.4.0 &lt;=&gt; 192.168.2.0 This dident work ether. </s>
<s> After much reading, I'm under the (miss)understanding that: A. </s>
<s> The tunnel needs to have a different IP address scheme then ether of the LAN segments on ether end. </s>
<s> B. </s>
<s> The tunnel needs to have a different IP address scheme then the FQDN of ether end. </s>
<s> C. I have to manually setup ROUTE's on each end to direct traffic through the tunnel. </s>

<s> In the mean time I'm sure that the readers of this forum will show me the errors of my ways.... &lt;g&gt; mark. </s>
<s> I have found www.logmein.com free and paid editions to be much easier to use for connecting remotely. </s>
<s> The free edition is great. </s>
<s> When using a BEFVP41 and VPN, I opted to use a software VPN on a server in the other LAN to get to network shares. </s>
<s> Also, using two BEFVP41s to connect the two LANs together all of the time works well. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>

<s> Greetings: A quick look at &quot;logmein&quot; appears to be a PAID service. </s>
<s> Not what I was looking for at all or any HELP at all. </s>
<s> (did not see any &quot;free &quot; options other than &quot;free trial&quot;=Not FREE.) </s>
<s> I have a number of FREE VPN clients already and have a VPN router that I paid good $$ for. </s>
<s> I'm connecting via: LAPTOP=&gt;CellPhone=&gt;Internet=&gt;BEFVP41=&gt;LAN </s>
<s> If you've found that the CNET forums are lacking on help with more complicated configurations: &quot;Broadbandreports.com&quot; has forums for all the major network hardware manufacturers as well as most of the big ISP's. </s>
<s> &quot;linksysinfo.com&quot; has a bunch of information for Linksys routers. </s>
<s> Mark. </s>
