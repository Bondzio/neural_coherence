1.1.1	My network currently experiences bandwidth sharing issues .	St
1.1.2	If one person on the network is downloading a large file he or she seems to use up almost the entire amount of available bandwidth - and as a result other users ca n't even load a webpage .	St
1.1.3	I 'm lloking for a solution that allows a more even distribution of bandwidth to ~30 users .	St
1.1.4	My current solution utilizes 2 Linksys 16 port switches attached to a NetGear router which is in turn attached to a 6meg capped cable modem ( courtesy of Time Warner ) .	Sug
1.1.5	My guess as to what is going on is that the given individual is in continuous connection with the switch/router and that causes requests for information to simply be ignored until they time out ... leading to websites not loading .	St
1.1.6	Is there a product around that I can purchase that will let me manage the network more like a college-dorm ?	Ques
1.1.7	( the situation i 'm in is actually a Fraternity ) It seems that in college dorms that any number of people can download large files and the others on the same network ( where I am it 's done by hall in each dorm ) do n't see any slowing down of their own connection .	St
1.1.8	This may be due to the intensely large amount of bandwidth supplied to the dorms to begin with .	St
1.1.9	I doubt that the entire solution relies on having a high bandwidth fiber - so there must be something I 'm missing .	St
1.1.10	Links/names of products would be REALLY useful if anyone can help .	Sug
1.1.11	Thanks , Mark	St
1.2.1	That feature is called IP SHAPING .	St
1.2.2	You may not find it in an easy to obtain dlink/linksys/other product .	St
1.2.3	It is however in Linux , but I offer no support for such .	St
1.2.4	You can research if a Linux based router is right for you .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
