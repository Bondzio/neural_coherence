1.1.1	HI Trying to set up a new wireless router - it is Netgear DG834G (v.4).	St
1.1.2	It works fine with ethernet, but when I try to connect through wireless its status is continually 'Acquiring Network Address'.	St
1.1.3	I have tried using the winsoc fix, to no avail.	St
1.1.4	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	Interfere with the wifi address acquisition.	St
1.2.2	Did you do the usual ipconfig /release all and then disable the ethernet in device manager?	St
1.2.3	Is this network WIFI setup per our forum sticky and does this wifi work at free wifi hotspots?	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
