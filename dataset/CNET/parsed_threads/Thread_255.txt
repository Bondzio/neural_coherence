<s> I was restarting my desktop when a power surge went through my room. </s>
<s> My ATXPW550 power source was spewing dense smoke through both the front and especially the back of the PC. </s>
<s> I want to know if the damage would be isolated to the power source or could it have corrupted other vital components as well? </s>
<s> I know, I should have used a surge protector. </s>
<s> But times are tough. </s>
<s> I need this info to know what credit to claim from my landlord. </s>
<s> Power supplies standards (long before an IBM PC even existed) defined functions so that a supply causes no other damage. </s>
<s> To have damage means a supply was missing what must be standard in all machines. </s>
<s> A problem mostly found when computer assemblers select a supply only on dollars, watts, or name. </s>
<s> An assembler (not the supply manufacturer) is responsible for having required functions inside a computer. </s>
<s> A supply manufacturer will say in specifications whether those required functions exist. </s>
<s> If an assembler does not read those specs, then nobody can say if a computer contains standard and required protection. </s>
<s> If you had a surge, then also list other surge damaged appliances. </s>
<s> Chances are the defect is due to the most common reason for failure. </s>
<s> A manufacturing defect. </s>
<s> To say more would be apparent by identifying physically damaged part(s). </s>
<s> I've been in the shop when an owner was allowed to show us what was wrong with their PC. </s>
<s> No surge occurred (we had many other PCs on the mains at the time) and their machine's PSU failed taking every board and drive with it, There was a moment of silence and then people left the area so to not hurt their feelings. </s>
<s> So you'll never know what's dead until you test it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> IMHO, electrical problems are just another headache that can effect everything that's connected. </s>
<s> There is no guarantee than it will be isolated. </s>
<s> if in fact you had other protection schemes in place to help you, then you reduce any possible damage. </s>
<s> If nothing other than a Ac cord, you need to find out the hard way what is effected. </s>
<s> In no uncertain, once the new PSU in put into place it will tell in the real world what can be effected. </s>
<s> Until then, you're at the mercy of can be had. </s>
<s> I can only suggest in future setups that you include some surge protection like a power strip or AC cord ends had the basic protection. </s>
<s> This maybe too late but a lesson learned. </s>
<s> If you have the ability test components and devices elsewhere to help eliminate the accumulative effect that at times are also a problem. </s>
<s> In other words alone they may not cause a problem but together will. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> If you are going to be compensated then you will need to have receipts anyway. </s>
<s> Replace the power supply and see if anything else is destroyed. </s>
<s> You can do this yourself or take it to a shop. </s>
<s> Fortunately, I have seen many instances of power supplies dying without any other damage, but it is impossible to know for sure until you have checked it out. </s>
<s> Maybe be other things were damaged, maybe not. </s>
<s> Wouldn't think it's your landlords fault. </s>
