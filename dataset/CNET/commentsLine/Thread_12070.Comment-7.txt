lot of talk about a simple issue.
lets condense it: did you use heat compound or the tape version?
no-then do so.
yes-move on.
joseph pointed out something i noticed right away.
power supply.
even a good 300w ps is probably too small for what you have in your box.
i have roughly the same setup and run a 400w ps.
good luck.
