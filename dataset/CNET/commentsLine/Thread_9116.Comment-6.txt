yes, i'm also expecting that.
hopefully seagate will come up with a solution, as i am sure that i am not the only one that has experienced this.
interestingly, i've an older and smaller lacie drive attached that has never caused any problems.
if i can recover the files from the seagate drive, i'm tempted to dump it and return to the lacie stable.
it's also a shame that mac's disk utility doesn't really do the job that it should (in my case, at least).
it should fix this problem and not report that all is well when i run the first aid option.
i guess that's why disk warrior and others are in the game.
