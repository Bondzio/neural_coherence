your standard red, yellow white av connections while not s-video (see  ) are rarely found on a pc.
be very clear that composite and svideo is going to be unacceptable to most (so far nearly 100%!)
so i strongly suggest you don't spend a dime on this.
unless your pc has composite out why not try this another way?
many want to watch content from the pc on the tv but given we are going to get 1/3 to 1/4 the pixels as the vga display again you find that folk after expending money and effort are often upset with the results.
this changes if you have a hdtv.
