The issue of less than 4GB is widely discussed.
To curb the phonecalls Microsoft changed the reported RAM to include all installed RAM but as you research this you find the same old 32 bit limits are still their.
Beyond that, apps are still limited to 2GB with one rare exception.
While interesting I'd skip any 32 bit Windows today.
