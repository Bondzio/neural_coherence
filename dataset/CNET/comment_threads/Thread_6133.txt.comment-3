i've made up my mind about the CPU- AMD Athlon 64 FX-55 proccesor and the Nvidia GeForce 6800 Ultra or not dont really matter.
The case i dont really mind anything.
But i dont have any clue of what RAM i should get or what is Mobo, since im like one of those computer dead guys, lol, thx for the suggestions though, im getting closer to actually deciding everything.
