our 10 year old hp 6l laserjet which never gave us any problems until a tech from a laser printer repair shop in the city by the bay (pst) cleaned our printer (and seems to have done something to the memory chip or whatever is in the printer that makes it respond to data commands to print after the data leaves the print queue and arrives in the printer - we can tell this because the printer lights blink on and off as the document file name disappears from the print queue screen on the laptop)- well, the printer is now dead.
hp claims on its website that the hp laserjet 2015 is the &quot;replacement&quot; for the 6l line.
actually, befoer reading this i concluded, after much research online, that the 2015 would meet our needs but i'm concerned about the driver problems and the lack of hp tech support which we experienced today and with the many reports of bad or nonexistent hp tech support which i read on the message boards over at consumerreports.org.
i have also read that brother printers are awful, especially the toner cartridges and that canon is not what it used to be.
help!
what do we do?
the laptop the laserjet will be paired with is a lenovo t60 with 1gb (soon to be 2gb)running xp.
of course, in the future it may be upgraded to vista.
the hp 2015 is not really compatible with vista from what i've read.
actually, i've read that there are problems with hps in general.
but all these messages are from last year.
has hp developed real vista drivers for shipment this year?
any thoughts on what we should look at or buy?
the printer will be used by a writer and needs to be able to print quality black and white text on documents of 10-75 pages in length at a time, web pages, envelopes, labels, etc.
it also needs to be able to print photos and other images within documents reasonably decently.
it does not need to be networked.
(we have a color printer for that).
it must have a small footprint 13&quot; x 12&quot; and weigh no more than 24 -25 lbs.
thanks!
