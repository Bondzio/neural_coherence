IMO If it's 32bit it doesn't matter , I personally like amd chips because the onboard graphics is radeon based and I like the force options for resolution , but anything ~ 2-3 ghz processor and 2+ gb ram would be sufficient for what you require !
If it's 64 bit IMO I go with an amd 64 bit dual core ~ 2-3 ghz and 2gb ram.... Iknow alot of ppl like intel but I like and notice the extra cache per cost on amd You can shave more $$ if you rethink your needs and cost.
