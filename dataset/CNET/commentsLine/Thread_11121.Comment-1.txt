i have some mobility problems and i can buy the necessary items only on the web.
i use a nice teac ox1200 mouse on my office computer and i tried to find similar mouse for my house computer but i cannot find the same model.
several online shops offer teac mouse of different models but without enough data to decide if they are what i need.
is there any teac catalog with data on the various models of teac mice?
i could not find such on the web.
please advise thanks
