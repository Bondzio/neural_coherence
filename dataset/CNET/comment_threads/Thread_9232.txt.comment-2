Contacted with US HP online support.
they recommended me to reseat the cable from power supply in pc tower to motherboard and from motherboard to cable.... and said if the power light still does not glow fine, the problem should be on the motherboard....due to there are lots of minicircuits on it.
i am not an expert.... maybe he is right.
don you guys also think the burning of my cleaner a totally different thing?
my PC works fine now in my new house just with booting problem sometimes... maybe i should wait until monday to contact with UK online support..........
