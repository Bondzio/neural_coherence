I am also having this issue but it may not be totally the router's fault.
This problem occurs with my Dell Studio 15 laptop running Win7 Home Premium which I purchased early this year.
But I don't have this problem with my 4 year old Lenovo Thinkpad T61 laptop running WinXP SP3.
So that tells me that there is a compatibility issue between the internal wireless adapter in the Dell and the Belkin.
I did try to muck around with the advanced wireless card settings in the Dell but I had to be careful as I am not a networking expert and was afraid of making the problem worse.
I was hoping to find a posting somewhere that specified some settings that could be changed to fix this problem but my broader searches on this issue seems to point to a firmware problem.
