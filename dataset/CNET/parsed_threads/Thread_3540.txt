<s> I set up the C drive (of computer 1)to share and then mapped it to a folder. </s>
<s> I can see the folder on #1 computer. </s>
<s> However on #2 computer it is not in &quot;My Computer&quot;. </s>
<s> I want to be able to access the #1 C drive (folder) from computer #2. </s>
<s> How do I do this? </s>
<s> Both machines are WXP. </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> If your network is properly configured, shares will show up in My Network Places. </s>
<s> Simply create an identical account on all machines, enable file and print sharing by running the network setup wizard on said machines, and then create shares. </s>
<s> OOps! </s>
<s> Hit ENTER too soon. </s>
<s> What kind of account are you talking about? </s>
<s> How? </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> If computer 1 has a user acount named Bill with password &quot;OpenSaysMe&quot; then computer 2 must have a user account named Bill with password &quot;OpenSaysMe.&quot; In other words, you must log on to both computers using the same name and password. </s>
