You can install 4gb of ram in the ram slots, but as i stated only a certain amt. will actually be used. If your system is capable install win7 64bit as better solution. Also, your system may need a bios update to handle such ram if not already installed. tada -----Willy

To curb the phonecalls Microsoft changed the reported RAM to include all installed RAM but as you research this you find the same old 32 bit limits are still their. Beyond that, apps are still limited to 2GB with one rare exception. While interesting I'd skip any 32 bit Windows today. Bob
