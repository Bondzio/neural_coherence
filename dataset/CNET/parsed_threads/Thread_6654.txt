<s> Hi all, I'm trying to find a software that can handle my requirment. </s>
<s> I have a notebook that I use at work and Home. </s>
<s> I have an external usb drive here at work and another one at home. </s>
<s> I would like to find a software that syncronize those two drives. </s>
<s> This thing should be done in different ways but what I expect should be the behaviour is something like: I get at work and use the external HD. </s>
<s> Meanwhile in the notebook (or remotely via a nas or ftp server) it tracks down every file I added or modified or deleted. </s>
<s> When I get home and connect to the other drive the software should recognize the drive and sync it with the info the notebook collected. </s>
<s> Then it starts collecting infos on the change I make on the Home HD that will be synched to the Work HD whenever I recconect to it. </s>
<s> Is there some kind of software that can do something like that? </s>
<s> Any other solution? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot in advance mario </s>
<s> Syncback Goodsync Not one title does this -&gt; &quot;should recognize the drive and sync it with the info the notebook collected.&quot; For that you would have to create your own custom app. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Personally I don't see in none of the software the requested features.. both let to sync different computers for example, but not the same pc with different hd connected not simultaneously. </s>
<s> Anyway I will try with GoodSync if there is a way to let it work like I need. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> It's called Dropbox. </s>
<s> It requires a manual upload, however, and doesn't propagate deletions. </s>
<s> Otherwise, research Webdav (shared storage on the web, accessible via Windows Explorer as a normal folder). </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I dont think there is any software for such kind of usb synchronization from two different place, i would advise you to remote your systems and then achieve the maximum out of them </s>
