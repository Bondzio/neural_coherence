i've been building computers for myself and for friends for a dozen years now.
i've used practically every brand of hard drive out there.
the only brand that has a 100% survival rating is samsung.
i've got several that are 11 years old and still going strong.
maybe the new wd drives are better, but my failure rate with them used to be quite high.
nowadays samsung is the only brand i'll put in the computers i build.
i have one of the new samsung 1 tb drives in my newest computer and it is awesome!
