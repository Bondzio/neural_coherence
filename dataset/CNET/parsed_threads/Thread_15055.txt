<s> So for a couple of years my WD 1.5 hard drive hasnt been working i havent messed with it for a while but maybe you can can help i have uploaded to youtube that should describe the problem would there be a way to get my data off of it? </s>
<s> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebxlJG-xkKU thanks again </s>
<s> You could research getting another PCB or main board but since the cover was removed, all bets about recovery are not ones I'd take. </s>
<s> Maybe www.drivesavers.com is next. </s>

<s> Head replacement, board replacement, etc. </s>
<s> Basically you take a good drive to make yours good then after the data is off you never trust those units since they are ... untrustworthy. </s>

<s> Well, cracking it open is certainly the action of last resort. </s>
<s> if at all possible use a similar WD pcd board and see if that changes anything. </s>
<s> If that is the cause then somehow the electronics are wonky either the tracking or the R/W head is kaput. </s>
<s> It need not be broken but as its now open the flight distance can vary and be too much to correct. </s>
<s> It could well have be done w.\/o removing the cover. </s>
<s> All bets bets are off that now even if you fixed it, there's no telling how long it will last after being exposed. </s>
<s> I would offer via Craigslist to buy &quot;dead WD drives&quot; for some cost in order to get the parts you may need. </s>
<s> I don't suspect you know anything about SMC type electronics and you do need the proper tools to even attempt installing SMC type components. </s>
<s> look at the pcb board, could exchange those parts. </s>
<s> If nope your best bet is a working pcb board. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
