I am building a computer with an Asus TXP4-X motherboard, which I do not know how to connect to the case.
The plugs from the case are: PWR LED + (green) PWR LED - (white) POWER SW (double-width plug, two wires, orange and white) RESET SW (double-width plug, two wires, blue and white) SPEAKER (quadruple-width plug, two wires, red and black).
The motherboard pins are designated in the manual as follows: Reserved: (1) Message LED: (2)+5V, (3)GND SMI Lead: (4), (5)GND ATX Power Switch: (6), (7)GND Reset SW: (8), (9)GND System Power LED: (10)+5v, (11)NC, (12)GND Keyboard Lock: (13)LOCK, (14)GND Reserved: (15) Speaker Connector: (16)+5V, (17)GND, (18)GND, (19)SPKR
