i disabled eist, but i didn't find c1e.
somehow... it performed worse on the benchmark than with it enabled.
i retested it with both settings a few times to make sure.
cpuz shows my proccesor at normal stats.
333x8 2.66ghz, but passmark's &quot;measured cpu speed&quot; is always on the low side (and it varies every time i open it) the only other cpu settings i could find in the bios are: cpu function -&gt; execute bit support (disabled), set cpuid maxval to 3 (disabled) i'm not sure what these mean but i will test them out
