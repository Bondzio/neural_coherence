My AMD system consists of an Asus A7N8X MoBo, 3200+ CPU, 1GB Corsair PC-3200 (DDR-400) XMS memory running in dual channel and an EVGA Geforce 6800 GT VGA card.
Playing Half Life 2 I experienced what you mentioned.
I can turn off the antivirus and this greatly helps but doesn't eliminate the occasional pauses.
On my other PC; an Asus P5ND2-SLI with a Pentium 4, 3 Gh (630) CPU, 1GB PC2-4200 (DDR2-533) Crucial Ballistix memory running in dual channel and an EVGA Geforce 7800 GT CO, still has occasional pauses but not as bad as the other system.
I think it's inherent in the game.
