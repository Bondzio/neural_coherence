hi, buying my first camcorder, for use with a powerbook g4 (which will probably be replaced with an imac with leopard next year).
i don't plan on buying anything fancy and hope to keep it to around $300-$400.
is there any camcorder in that price range that seems to work better than others with macs?
or, is there any reason to think the jvc gr-d650, which seems to suit my needs, wouldn't work?
thanks.
