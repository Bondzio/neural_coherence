<s> I purchased a 120GB hard drive from NewEgg for my Sony Vaio VGN-S150 laptop. </s>
<s> I first installed XP Pro on it but uninstalled it cause I couldnt find the drivers for the USB Controller, or the mass storage device(if you could help with that, i would install pro which i need again). </s>
<s> When Pro was installed the OS saw the 120GB. </s>
<s> Since I couldn't find the those 2 drivers off of sony's site (had all the other drivers) I decided to just uninstalled Pro and install the OS with the VGN-S150 recovery kit which has home edition which i really don't want. </s>
<s> With the recovery cd's everything looked great, but when I check to see how much space the recovery took up on the hard drive it said it took up 3.08GB, and only 15GB are free. </s>
<s> I reinstalled with the recovery cd's and same thing happend. </s>
<s> In BIOS the the system saw the whole 120GB drive. </s>
<s> So know the system see it, but for some reason the recovery cd's partition it wrong or something. </s>
<s> Any Ideas? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Not yet. </s>
<s> I thought I would try here to see what you all would say before all of that. </s>
<s> I'd see what disk management has to report. </s>
<s> It's possible the drive was cloned and along with it the partition sizes. </s>
<s> disk or drive management might show the unused space. </s>
