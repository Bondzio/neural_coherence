1.1.2	I'm just looking for something I can get on the internet with, maybe watch some streaming videos and other light duty things and has a good touchpad.	St
1.1.3	Ive been recommended the asus netbooks, but when I look on amazon there are so many different ones with similar &quot;names&quot; but a few different numbers after them and the price difference is usually large.	St
1.1.4	For instance: the ASUS Eee PC 1018P-PU37-BK vrs the Asus Eee 1018P-BBK804.	St
1.1.5	There is about a $150 difference between the two but i can quite figure out why.&lt;div&gt; Can anybody help me find a good netbook.	St
1.1.6	$350 give or take a little is about what id like to spend &lt;/div&gt;	St
1.2.1	For in the 229 buck range you head to target/walmart and you get the usual netbook.	St

1.3.1	If I can get a decent net book for $229 than that would be great.	St
1.3.2	Can you recommend one in particular?	Sug
1.3.3	I am looking for a small computer i can take with me to work when i have down time on the ambulance.	St
1.3.4	Ill mostly use it just to cruise the internet, apply to jobs, watch streaming video, etc.	St
1.3.5	I have a nice desk top computer that I use at home.	St
1.3.6	I guess I could look at laptops, do they make laptops that are the size of netbooks?	St
1.3.7	I really like the size and portability of the netbooks... are there any good laptops out there for $350 that you would recommend?	St
1.4.1	For the usual I'd get the 229 buck unit at Target and use it, pocket the bucks in savings.	St
1.4.2	As to 350 buck laptops you have to keep shopping to catch the sale to get the best deals but http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?InvtId=LATITUDE-D631-PB-R&amp;cpc=RESX is so similar to my HP dv6910us that it's scary.	St
1.4.3	And I can write that XP in that system is really fast and usable.	St
