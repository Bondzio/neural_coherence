Can any one recommend a good motherboard that i can put this CPU on.I am just in the process of building up a desktop pc. Thanks

Re finding a motherboard, ram, etc., http://www newegg.com is one of the easier sites to find parts by category or type...i.e. motherboards, intel, socket 775....the list will be nearly endless. Filter the list by 'best rating'. VAPCMD

Good motherboards to look at, MSI and or Gigabyte in socket 775. Use at least 1 GB of ram, preferably 2 or even 3 and you have a start to a very decent hook up. Good luck and have fun!
