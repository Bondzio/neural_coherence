1.1.1	Do you really need a seperate hard drive for your Windows operating system ?	Ques
1.1.2	I do light video editing and light gaming , some people say to seperate the OS to a another drive .	St
1.2.1	Such is easy to answer since most run the OS , applications and more on one hard disk .	St
1.2.2	Not needed or required .	St

1.3.1	I 'm a strong proponent for separating the OS and APPS ( C : ) from the data ( D : ) even if they 're just partitions on the same hard disk drive .	St
1.3.2	This makes it easier to do backups because the partitions are smaller ( only OS and APPs vs OS APPs and DATA ) and makes it safer to recover from a system crasj because your data is isolated on D : To faciliate backups , restores and minimize downtime ... I always put a second drive in every system I build to store my backups of C : and D :	St
