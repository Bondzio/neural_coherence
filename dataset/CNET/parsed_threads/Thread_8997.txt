<s> Can I connect a powerline network and a wireless network simultaneously between 2 computers? </s>
<s> Since you asked it appears you have failed to do so. </s>
<s> But given only the question and no details of what setup you envisioned I'm unsure if this was a good way to kick off your discussion. </s>
<s> Try explaining in detail what you want to do. </s>

<s> I currently have a wireless network between 2 computers. </s>
<s> Cable modem thru a Hawking router. </s>
<s> (Presently using XP sp2 with Network Magic to connect wirelessly rather than using My Network Places. </s>
<s> Network Magic does not support powerline networking but I assume XP could, the same as with a true wired connection). </s>
<s> I have purchased a Panasonic BL-PA100KT powerline networking kit (2 units (BL-PA100E) under the brand name of HD-PLC, High-Speed Power Line Network). </s>
<s> I am curious if both could be operated simultaneously or would there be a conflict? </s>
<s> Both would go through the same Hawking router using the cable modem. </s>
<s> One of the setups would be wireless and the other pseudo wired through the house wiring. </s>
<s> Could both be used at the same time? </s>
<s> You can indeed deploy both means of access but Windows can only use one or the other connection path at any given moment. </s>
<s> Hope this clears that up. </s>

<s> You can buy a Powerline/Wifi bridge for $55. </s>
<s> Isn't the Panasonic powerline a bridge? </s>
<s> How would the computer know which method (wireless or powerline) to use if they were both installed? </s>
<s> Would one overpower the other when using the internet? </s>
