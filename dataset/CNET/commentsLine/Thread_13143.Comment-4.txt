if they seller has tons of feedback ratings (1,000 +) and a good rating (i usually look for 98.5% or better) though then you may be safe.
the trick is to read the auction carefully, and send a note with any questions.
if you do not get a response back that is sometimes a bad sign.
i have not purchased anything as expensive as a pc off of ebay, but have bought 60+ things over the last 3-4 years and have not had problems yet.
but i think if you use paypal they have something where you can get the 4 back i believe.
