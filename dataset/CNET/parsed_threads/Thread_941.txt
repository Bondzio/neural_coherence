<s> My Mickey Mouse phone company (Citizen's Telecom/Frontier Communications) wants an arm and a leg to &quot;rent&quot; their 356k DSL wireless modem each month. </s>
<s> But they say I can buy one from a third party, & they'll hook it up for $25. </s>
<s> I'd like to be able to buy & intall one myself, but I'm not sure which type I'll need, which manufacturer is best. </s>
<s> Gateway, 2 Wire, or whichever company can provide the cheapest that will do the job. </s>
<s> I am a senior citizen, running MAC OSX10.4.11. </s>
<s> Can anyone advise me? </s>
<s> Every penny counts. </s>
<s> THANX </s>
<s> I loaned my DSL modem to a neighbor for troubleshooting. </s>
<s> So while hookup is a breeze sometimes they must do that step if a wiring change is required in some external box. </s>
<s> But you should be able to install the thing. </s>
<s> But back to setup. </s>
<s> I can't count how many know knowthing about PPPoE. </s>
<s> If you don't you may not be ready to install. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I can set up any acct information, preferences, etc - just need to know what DSL modem would be easiest and most compatible with my provider and my MAC OS. </s>
<s> If not, let them do it the first time. </s>
<s> Also if you didn't research PPPoE. </s>
<s> It shows you may have issues. </s>
<s> call the geeksquad and have them come to your home and take care of it and also get a tune-up and it,s all covered if you have a problem down the road. </s>
<s> Sometimes we just have to pay! </s>
<s> At my FL home, I've installed a PPPoE (point-to-point protocol over ethernet) ethernet modem and separate wireless router on an AT&T line successfully. </s>
<s> I want to try it myself on this phone line from Mickey Mouse telecom, but I need to know what type wireless DSL modem works best with my MAC OS. </s>
<s> This phone company charges $19.99 per month for dial-up so slow that the connection times out before pages load. </s>
<s> Its cost for the &quot;light&quot; (cheapest) DSL is $29.99, + $3.99 for modem rental. </s>
<s> I'll only use it for 6 mos of my one year mandated contract, so instead of paying $33.98 a month for 12 months, I'll effectively be paying $67.96 per month actual usage. </s>
<s> Mickey Mouse telecom has no provision for temporarily suspending service, as other companies do. </s>
<s> I don't want to pay them 1 cent more than necessary! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Writing just a bit more tells me you shouldn't have any issue. </s>
<s> I didn't know that you had setup this before or what country you were in. </s>
<s> Go for it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> THANX for everything, now... LINKSYS has lousy support for MAC, any clues about which manufacturer has decent support? </s>
<s> But you don't need it. </s>
<s> For a setup with modem then a router you just have the router do the PPPoE login. </s>
