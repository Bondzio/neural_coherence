hello, my mother has a old computor HP pavillion 8533z with windows 98, she has a problem, when the computor boots up a message comes on the screen says &quot;unable to continue due to missing file&quot; then the message says this &quot; the message says that file zmm32.vxd is required to run windows, if this file is not in your past, you may need to re install windows 98.and when she trys to install windows it says that she needs windows update instead of the orginal windows program that she bought, this just happened, she uses the computor for teaching class and keeps alot of projects and school picture on the hard drive,she does not want to reformat the drive cause she will loose all her work.
any help....
Question---can she reboot with windows 98 disk with out formatting the hard drive.
Question---does she need a update for windows 98 in order to continue,.....and she is unable to find a windows 98 update program...where can she find or buy one... Question-how can she get her files off the computor so that she can re format.
