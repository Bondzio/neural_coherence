<s> Hi, I picked up this monitor from a local goodwill for about $20. </s>
<s> It didn't have a power supply, so I ordered a replacement (not from HP, from another vendor). </s>
<s> The one I got is rated at 12V, 5A, and it worked fine. </s>
<s> But after a day, I discovered the backlight power failure issue that apparently plagues these monitors. </s>
<s> Discovered the thread here, and though most of the solutions pointed to problems in HP's power supply, I wanted to see if anyone has a suggestion if I'm using a new, non-HP power supply. </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> Provided the ps falls into the same specs as the old HP one did, there shouldn't be a problem. </s>
<s> The issue on this forum that users had were bad &quot;inverters&quot; located within the LCD itself, not the ps. </s>
<s> The inverter had poor manufacture or componets so they got whacked. </s>
<s> the reply of that same monitor also provided links to fixes and repairs that could be made or at least point to the problem area. </s>
<s> This needs some disassembly so if you're not capable, then find a good repair center/shop. </s>
<s> That $20 LCD may not be a bargain after all. </s>
<s> Use the forum search engine to locate the topic. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> thanks Willy! </s>
<s> time to get out the soldering iron. </s>
<s> I'm working on reading through that thread now but it's over 350 posts, mostly furious customers posting their frustrating treatment at the hands of HP tech support, so it's taking me a little while ... </s>
<s> Believe me its worth looking to hit the one with the &quot;details and such&quot; and breakdown of the LCD case. </s>
<s> I used HP 1703 and possibly HP 1503(similar) to get those valuable tips/hints/fixes/cures, etc. </s>
<s> via the forum search. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Here is a direct link, that was founded via C/Net then on to a user that really started a blog. </s>
<s> http://www.lesliewong.us/blog/2005/05/02/hp-pavilion-f1703-flat-panel-display-blackout-solution/ again good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Unbelievable. </s>
<s> If only fixing everything was that easy. </s>
<s> The solder points on mine looked good, but I put more on anyway - 15 minutes and it was working perfectly. </s>
