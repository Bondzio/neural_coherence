I successfully paired another device only a few days ago so I'm 99.99% certain I'm using the correct pairing key. How can I check the pairing key on my laptop bluetooth to be sure I'm using the correct key? P.S. I changed it from the default key a long time ago, and I have been successfully pairing devices up until now.

I've seen Toshiba, Widcomm, MSFT, Blue Soleil, something with Samsung on it and now some Chinese stacks. Each one is accessed in some different way so I can't answer this one without the final detail. But do look around. Here's the Microsoft article about theirs. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883259 Bob

I have an Asus Eee Pad Transformer Tablet with Bluetooth that I use to send photos among my devices. I was able to pair all of the devices with no problem except the Toshiba Laptop. I have paired the Asus Tablet with the Desktop Computer and the Desktop Computer with the Tablet and a Bluetooth printer. The Asus Tablet does not support WiFi printing and only supports photos via Bluetooth. My Desktop Computer is running Win VISTA Premium and my Toshiba Laptop is running Win XP SP3. P.S. Since my laptop is rather old and I was using the Bluetooth Stack for Windows which came already installed on the laptop, I just might remove that and get newer Bluetooth Adapter and use that. Thanks for the help.
