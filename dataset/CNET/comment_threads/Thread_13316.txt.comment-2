The machine's maker?
Some smaller shops don't test for proper airflow or skimp on a needed fan.
You didn't tell if you are the designer.
If so, you get to solve heat buildup issues if your case fails to expel the heat.
Common fixes are to cut new exhaust holes, fit a few more fans or just leave the case cover off.
There is no ready to use formula for this, but I endorse making the system maker aware of the issue and letting them resolve it (as no cost) first.
