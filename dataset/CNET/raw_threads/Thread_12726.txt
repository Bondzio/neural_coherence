I have absolutely no idea which sort I need or which size. My hard drive measures 6&quot; by 4&quot;. Could someone please advise me. Thank you, Helen

To confirm this and other details, please tell us the model number of the hard drive. Will this be used for a Mac or Windows computer?

Excellent Service..great website..lots of info..great prices.. .. I think BELKIN makes really great products and I use them.. So I would suggest you try the BELKIN Ext. Enclosure.. .. But recently I came across some discarded HDD's that I wanted to use.. I purchased from NEW EGG two External Enclosure KITS: ....EXT ENCLO ANYWARE[ME-325U2-SV RTL]....and I'm very surprised at the Excellent Quality for the PRICE.. .. They loaded easily/did not need the enclosed CD.. I suggest you have USB 2.0/ Comes w/the CABLE..externally powered by 120vAC.

4673	5	229759	2382898	2382275	Helen Hunt	1/23/07 4:16 AM	1.16952576E12	More information	I bought it to go into my desktop PC to automatically back up everything I do. However the person who was going to fit it has a serious drink problem and after 5 months waiting it is still not installed. I decided to use it as an external hard drive for backing up my data but I have no idea how to do this. It has been suggested that I use a Belkin, but I think I need more information and help before I go and spend more money. Any help you can give me will be very much appreciated. Thanks. Helen

It is a standard 3.5&quot; form factor desktop drive. What you need is an external enclosure with the following: - a 3.5&quot; external enclosure (not the 2.5&quot; or 1.8&quot; enclosures for notebook drives) - IDE (may be listed as Ultra ATA or ATA/100/133 or UDMA5 or UDMA6) internal interface. (Not SATA.) - USB 2.0 external interface (Firewire would be better if using a Mac) - external power supply Alternative: - a 5.25&quot; external enclosure that can fit a 3.5&quot; hard drive Optional, but recommended: - metal case material to dissipate heat better than plastic - external enclosure with fan to better dissipate heat 3.5&quot; external enclosures with internal IDE and external USB 2.0 5.25&quot; external enclosures with internal IDE, external USB 2.0, and fan (For these, make sure the specifications say that it will take a 3.5&quot; drive)
