<s> Hi, I have a e-machines T5016 Desktop which just died recently. </s>
<s> It is less than a year and a half old. </s>
<s> I had it checked and it was not the power system or switch. </s>
<s> It was suggested it might be the motherboard. </s>
<s> Does this sound right and how do I make sure? </s>
<s> Should I use e-machines replacement parts or something else? </s>
<s> I have installed extra memory before so would I be able to replace the motherboard myself or is it a technical job? </s>

<s> &quot;# Do not replace motherboard using Original Bestec Atx250-12e Power Supply # The above power supply is known to damage motherboard upon failure&quot; Bob </s>
<s> With power-OFF, disconnect all devices inside the case and remove memory. </s>
<s> Now. </s>
<s> power-ON and if it beeps, the mtrbd. </s>
<s> maybe OK or good. </s>
<s> Return ram into slots after powering off. </s>
<s> Repower system and it should beep again, if not possible bad ram. </s>
<s> Add only the HD on next try and see how far it goes, etc. </s>
<s> on other devices one at a time and each time make sure power is off before attaching. </s>
<s> If nothing seems to work from the beginning, I tend to replace the PSU if only because its a known good one and the mtrbd. </s>
<s> may be good and respond, plus a mtrbd. </s>
<s> can take little hits but not major ones, its usually the 2nd compomnet to fail rather than first. </s>
<s> You should though visually inspect the mtrbd. </s>
<s> for any obvious damage and/or distorted or leaking caps. </s>
<s> DON&quot;T take anything for granted, prove it. </s>
<s> Next, even if the mtrbd. </s>
<s> is bad and you can replace it don't expect the emachine OEM OS to work as it will balk as to not finding the emachine system mtrbd. </s>
<s> or the hidden bios tag for emachine. </s>
<s> you decide -----Willy </s>
<s> tell you the brand. </s>
<s> my e machines has an MSI board for instance. </s>
<s> so then i would go to tigerdirect or newegg and match your board with what they are selling. </s>
<s> its quite possible to find an exact match. </s>
<s> it would be cheaper by far than using e machines replacement parts. </s>
