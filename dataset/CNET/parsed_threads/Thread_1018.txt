<s> Hi , I have a desktop PC with Intel Dual Core 2.8 GHz processor , a motherboard with ATI Xpress 200 chipset . </s>
<s> The computer has 2 GB of DDR2 667 memory. </s>
<s> I want to add a Graphic Card to the configuration . </s>
<s> Now my question is if I add a Graphic card of the Nvida 2 series like the 240 , will the Graphic card confict with the configuration because of the ATI Xpress 200 chipset ? </s>
<s> Is it best to stick with the ATI brand of GPUs ? </s>
<s> Actually a few years ago , we were assembling a PC with Core 2 Duo E6600 processor , Intel Motherboard with 965 chipset , 4 GB of DDR2 RAM and a 8400 GT graphic card . </s>
<s> There was a conflict between the Graphic Card and the Intel 965 chipset motherboard . </s>
<s> The motherboard and the graphic card was sent to their respective support centers , but it was said they were working fine ( We suspected that either Mobo or G-card was having a problem ) . </s>
<s> Finally the problem was sorted out by swapping the Intel 965 mobo with a XFX NForce chipset mobo , and till date the configuration works like a charm . </s>
<s> So my question is , will I be facing any compatibility issues if I pair a Nvidia GPC card with a ATI Xpress Chipset motherboard ? </s>
<s> Or is it is best to stick to a ATI GPU card with a ATI Xpress 200 Chipset ? </s>
<s> Thanks for reading Sam </s>
<s> But the 8400 was a problem unit. </s>
<s> It was subject of many issues and recalls. </s>
<s> I would dismiss any 8400 troubles and move forward. </s>
<s> Then again I have a friend that tries to overclock and constantly has issues. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>

<s> Thanks for your time and efforts , but the issue with NVIDIA 8400 and Intel 965 is history . </s>
<s> I want to know if you have encountered any issues with the NVIDIA 240 GPU and ATI Xpress 200 chipset . </s>
<s> I have configured PCs with Intel G31 and G41 chipsets as well as the X58 chipset ( Intel X58BP server board ) with NVIDIA GPUs cards ; No issues at all . </s>
<s> I am just asking because I have no experience with the ATI Xpress 200 chipset . </s>
<s> Thanks Sam </s>
<s> And the Nvidia card with the 240 which I have has never given me any sign of trouble but it's on some Intel chipset. </s>
<s> I guess you can google it but keep in mind I can bet somewhere someone had trouble. </s>
<s> And then with each card, someone somewhere reported trouble. </s>
<s> My card has (keeping it to my hardware) been in the HP d4999t and d5000t without issue. </s>
