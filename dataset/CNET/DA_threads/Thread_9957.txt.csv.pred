1.1.1	Hello , This question might sound dumb but Im new to how External Hard drives work .	St
1.1.2	So hopefully someone can ansewer a question for me : If I set up an external hard drive for my mac , Can I put and run software on it ?	Ques
1.1.3	The reason Im asking is because I would like to partition my mac with osx 10.4 and osx 10.5 and to do this I would have to reformat ( erase to factory settings ) my mac .	St
1.1.4	If I do this I will lose all of my software .	St
1.1.5	So Im hoping if I use an external hard drive , I can copy all my software to it .	St
1.1.6	Then partition my mac , and then send all my software back to my mac .	St
1.1.7	Does anyone know if something like this will work ?	Ques
1.1.8	or have any other suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.9	I have a lot of third party software on my computer that I cant get again , they are all in my applications folder sooo I was hoping to copy the contents to the external HD then put it back .	St
1.1.10	Will the software still work ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thank You , Sincerely , Michael	St
1.2.1	There is/was a program ( paid ) that would partition the drive without destroying the contents .	St
1.2.2	I believe it was/is called iPartition .	St
1.2.3	Google for it .	St
1.2.4	You can usually install software on any drive that is attached to your Mac but bear in mind that it is not just the application that gets installed .	St
1.2.5	While the app is located someplace , the preferences , library entry , application support data ( if any ) will be installed on the drive from which the machine is booted .	St
1.2.6	When you move an application from the internal to the external , it will continue to run correctly .	St
1.2.7	However , when you delete the contents of the main drive , you may well be deleting an integral part of the application , one that is required to make the application function correctly .	St
1.2.8	Probably the best way to move everything from one drive to the other is to use an application like Carbon Copy Cloner , there are others , to make an exact copy of your internal and then transfer it to the external .	St
1.2.9	The external now become bootable and you are free to mess with the internal .	St
1.2.10	Another way to go would be to leave the internal drive exactly like it is , with whatever OS version is currently on it , attach the external FIREWIRE ( preferably Firewire 800 if your Mac supports it ) connected hard drive ( go for 500GB or more ) and then install the new OS onto it .	St
1.2.11	That will save you the hassle of trying to ensure that all your existing programs continue to work correctly if you move the .	Sug
1.2.12	You then have the choice of which OS to boot into when you start up your Mac .	St
1.2.13	Remember that you can not have 10.4 and 10.5 running at the same time .	St
1.2.14	It would have helped a bit if you had mentioned exactly what sort of Mac you had .	St
1.2.15	Do you have a particular reason for wanting 10.4 and 10.5 on your machine ?	Ques
1.2.16	P	St
1.3.1	Hello , Yes , there is a reason Id like 10.4 and 10.5 on my machine because the mac zbrush runs on 10.5 and my maya runs on 10.4 I have just purchased a lavie external hard drive and mac osx 10.5.4 and im going to give it a try hopfully I can figure out how to upload the 10.5 to the external drive without messing up the internal drive .	St
1.3.2	I have an imac 10.4 .	St
1.3.3	Oh you mentioned that I can not have 10.4 and 10.5 running at the same time .	St
1.3.4	How would I transfer files then ?	Ques
1.3.5	Sincerely Michael	St
1.4.1	Installing 10.5 on the external is just a question of booting your iMac from the 10.5 DVD and choosing the external drive as the place to install it .	St
1.4.2	To transfer files from one OS to the other is straight forward .	St
1.4.3	Example : You are booted into 10.4 which is on the internal HD of the iMac .	St
1.4.4	The external drive appears mounted on the desktop .	St
1.4.5	( it will usually be below the internal HD ) ( Note .	St
1.4.6	the drive you are booted from is normally the top icon on the right hand side of the screen .	St
1.4.7	All other attached drives appear below it . )	St
1.4.8	You have created a file in Maya that needs to be further processed in Mac xbrush .	St
1.4.9	Locate the file you want to transfer to the external drive and drag it to the icon of the external drive .	St
1.4.10	Do not let go , the icon of the external drive will open and reveal the contents of the drive .	Sug
1.4.11	Continue to drag the file to the location you want it to be .	St
1.4.12	As you drag the file over a folder , the folder will open .	St
1.4.13	When you reach your destination , let go of the mouse button .	St
1.4.14	Exactly the same principle applies in the opposite direction .	St
1.4.15	Restart the iMac and hold down the option key .	St
1.4.16	Choose the external as the startup disk .	St
1.4.17	When booted , launch Mac zbrush and open the file you just moved over .	St
1.4.18	Question : Are you sure that Maya will not run on 10.5 ?	Ques
1.4.19	The 2009 version requires it but it would be worth checking to see if your version will run on 10.5 BTW , the last , not the latest , version of zbrush runs on 10.4 P	St
1.5.1	Thank you Mrmacfixit , I have installed the external hard drive as well as 10.5.4 on it not too bad it was simpler than I had thought .	St
1.5.2	I thank you very much .	Polite
1.5.3	I heard of problems in the past running maya 8.0 or 8.5 on mac 10.5 so I did n't want to take the chance , thats why I wanted to keep the 10.4 .	St
1.5.4	I now realize that the maya does work just as good on the 10.5 mac osx and I did n't even have to re-install it ( beautiful thing ) .	St
1.5.5	zbrush 3 dose not run on mac 10.4 thats why I got the external hard drive to put 10.5 on to be able to run zbrush 3.12 .	St
1.5.6	In the end it all worked out and I dont even need the 10.4 now .	St
1.5.7	So I can now use the external as a back up yay .	St
1.5.8	Do you use these graphics programs ?	Ques
1.5.9	you seen very knowledgeable about them .	St
1.5.10	If you do theres another great tool out now its called Unity 3d .	St
1.5.11	pretty awesome program if you ever want to check it out ?	Ques
1.5.12	Its my whole purpose of using these programs .	St
1.5.13	you can even create games for the iphone , mac , pc , wii , and all of they above .	St
1.5.14	Now if I could only afford the zbrush lol Thanks alot have a great day and happy holidays .	St
1.5.15	Sincerely , Michael	St
1.6.1	Glad everything worked out for you .	St
1.6.2	No , I 'm afraid that Maya just left me cold when I tried the demo and decided that Photoshop Elements with , perhaps , a little of the regular Photoshop thrown in , was about my level of artistic expertise .	St
1.6.3	In your case , I hammered Google looking for system specs for both those programs , but thanks for the compliment .	St
1.6.4	Enjoy your new toys , P	St
