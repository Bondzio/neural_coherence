I bought a PCI eSATA card and cable from Fry's to connect to my 750 GB FreeAgent Pro.
The drive will not power on (no light) no matter what I tried.
The card appears in the XP Media Center configuration.
The base of the drive is warm but no orange light.
USB and Firewire work fine.
I have a Sony VAIO desktop with XP Media Center edition.
Has anyone experience this problem?
Thanks
