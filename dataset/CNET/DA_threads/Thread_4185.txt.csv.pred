1.1.1	so at best buy and i bought a PNY 9600 GSO overclocked edtion for my new christmas PC .	St
1.1.2	It says it needs a minimum 400wat PSU , but the system only has a 250watt .	St
1.1.3	i installed it and it runs great the fan is queit not always on full like the 7900gt i tried before , and it does n't flicket out of games , do i need to update my powersupply to be safe , is this bad , can the PSU eventually die , will the card automatically tone it 's self down to not draw so much power ?	Ques
1.1.4	thanks , bigboy	Polite
1.2.1	The maker has recommended a 400W psu , that is n't a suggestion .	St
1.2.2	Sooner or later you 'll find out why .	St
1.2.3	For now , your 250W is making it but wo n't for long .	St
1.2.4	Just get the new 400W or greater psu ASAP .	St
1.2.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Add a trailer to your average car and now pull it up the mountain every day .	St
1.3.2	The average car will break down eventually .	St
1.3.3	Try that with your proper size truck and it works for a very long time .	St
1.3.4	Sorry if its a bad analogy .	St
