part iii the athlon on the other hand i usually just re-cable and re-jumper since the spare hard drive is never actually connected, its just there so i reconnect it when i do a quick update of a norton ghost from one to the other and then a quick ghost restore when i hear the usual dad the computer wont boot up again why do i bother with this silly stuff just cause but also ive had too many bad experiences with dual boot and problems with boot loaders that crash and burn if it doesnt see both operating systems alive and well.
if you want rock solid trouble free operation nt (no usb) and win 2k are so good i just cant believe there from microsoft.
as far as xp and/or xp pro is concerned i just havent been drunk enough to spend the money on it yet.
bill still owes me for windows 2.11 not to mention the $#%^ windows 95 that wouldnt work with amd processors greater than 350mhz.
went through $%% to get the patch only to find that it wouldnt work with my osr version.
i also have a fundamental problem with having to ask permission from the company i paid money to reinstall my software.
since what has proven to be one of my favorite hobbies (and the only one i can almost afford) is formatting hard drives.
