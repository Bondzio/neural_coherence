It usually starts at the beginning of the soundtracks and sometimes get so loud I have to turn the WMP or Ultra Player off.
This is with either music stored on the hard drive or from a CD in the bay (E: drive).
I checked all the drivers and they all read &quot;This is functioning properly&quot;...same for the audio codecs.

I use Logitech stereo-headphones Thanks
