hello, Am from India, and i would like to purchase a desktop for watching movie.
I prefer Intel Processor.
It would be great, if i can get some idea on the configuration am looking at.
I would like to have a good LCD (27&quot;) for this.
Which LCD monitor is the best to wtach movies?
Should i go for enhanced graphics card and also sound system (5.1 or 7.1)?
Appreciate your advice.
