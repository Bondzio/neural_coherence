I had to reformat this pc, was able to load onboard lan, sound, and modem drivers, have only standard vga driver loaded which gives me 16/2 bits- horrible.
system is as follows: Windows 98 SE (build 4.10.2222) PCCHIPS M599LMR Asset Tag: 0123ABC Enclosure Type: Desktop Processor a Main Circuit Board b 167 megahertz AMD K6-2 w/3DNow!
32 kilobyte primary memory cache 512 kilobyte secondary memory cache Board: PCCHIPS M598LMR 1.0 Bus Clock: 66 megahertz BIOS: American Megatrends Inc. 062601 07/15/97 uses sis530 but I can't load it.
Is this a chiset package?
