1.3.1	Rick, thanks for your reply, I just finished updating windows (I choose every optional installation) and after a second restart I got the pop up again.	Polite
1.3.2	Also downloaded the hp software from hp web page and installed an uninstalled the software Since the pop up appears even without the printer being connected, I believe the problem should be a piece of software that kind of &quot;identifies new hardware&quot; when there is none, as part of the process to install the printer when is part of the wireless network.
