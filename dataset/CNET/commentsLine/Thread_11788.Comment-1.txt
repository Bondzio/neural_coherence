i just put my system together with an asus ma3790t-deluxe mb and an amd phenom 9950 (125 watt).
i thought i could get by with an older atx power supply and was just using a 4 pin input on the 8 pin socket and my cpu fan is not running.
i can get into the bios and such but do not want to run the machine for long because i can see the cpu temp rising in the hardware monitor.
i tried plugging in two 4-pin atx jacks to the socket but they did not fit cleanly and the concept made me queasy to begin with (is this something to avoid?)
i'm guessing/hoping that this is due to the lack of an 8 pin atx input on that socket (documentation does specifically note that this should be used).
i have a new atx 12 v v2 power supply coming in two days but want to be sure i have a backup plan if that is not the case.
my question is whether it is reasonable to assume that the power supply is the reason the cpu fan is not working.
is is possible that the cpu fan power jack has a problem (mb was an open box item on newegg...)?
is it an issue with the heat sink, perhaps (and can i swap out my heat sink for my amd 2 to check)?
further, if the new power supply does not resolve the problem, is there an alternate cpu heat sink that would run off of a 4 pin atx connector?
this would seem like a reasonable workaround.
