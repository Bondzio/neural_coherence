CPU 2.66GHz Ram 256 MB.
I downloaded that AFT and it cleans everything out, ie, temps, cache, cookies,prefetch, etc.
, and I use it daily.
I defrag and scan disk weekly.
I have no icons down by my clock except my zone alarm and my volume icon.
I disabled all those things from my startup, so I wouldnt have all those icons down there.
Since my first post, I tried getting to that site with firefox and I had no problem.
It has something to do with IE I think, but I don't know what.
Thanks again, Sitnpritee
