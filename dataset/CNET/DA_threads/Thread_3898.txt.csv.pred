1.3.1	My wife has a Macbook and I have an iMac .	St
1.3.2	The Macbook is nice and portable , but I do a lot of multi-media stuff : Movie editing , music , graphics work , etc .	St
1.3.3	I find working with an iMac is much easier for doing this stuff .	St
1.3.4	The Macbook , with a small screen and scrunched keyboard is too small .	St
1.3.5	Also , the iMac has more Firewire , USB , audio-in , audio-out , speaker plug , etc .	St
1.3.6	that makes it much easier to plug external equipment in and also run my iMac speakers , all in a neat package .	St
1.3.7	But , the Macbook IS portable , and I can download movies and music and take it with me .	St
1.3.8	I just like the space and the & quot ; open & quot ; work environment that the iMac gives me .	St
1.4.1	Well , I guess you 're right and for the first time I found someone who though like me , Actually I 'm a composer and I work with softwares that require a big monitor and also rams .	St
1.4.2	Thanx for your opinion	St
1.5.1	If you 're planning on going to college after high school , I 'd say go for the macbook because its great to have the portability so you can take it to lectures , use wifi and everything else .	St
