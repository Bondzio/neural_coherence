10480	1	153745	1709450	1709383	TONI H	1/31/06 5:14 AM	1.13868444E12	I have had ATI cards	for a long time, and I don't have a problem with their drivers or tech support. I've never had to call them on the phone, but their email tech support is usually pretty good for me once I was able to get past the language barrier for some of them. I wasn't crazy about the programs that installed along with the drivers and found some of them confusing to use and went to other programs that were easier, but all in all, I haven't had much to complain about. The programs were just a personal preference with me. What kinds of problems have you encountered or was your question just one in general as a comparison type of ATI vs others? TONI

But, that was before reading all the reviews and how disgusted people that have actually used the card have been. I do realize that the only way you can make a true decision is to purchase &quot;said&quot; merchandise and experiment for yourself which can become expensive and time consuming. The below review is a good one that tells how ATI has compromised in the software area on the TV WONDER ELITE with the THEATER 550 chip, hopefully it will improve. http://www.firingsquad.com/hardware/ati_theater_550_pro/
