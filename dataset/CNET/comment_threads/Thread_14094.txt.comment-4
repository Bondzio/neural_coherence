I know an issue and have fixed dozens of them.
I refuse to enter into yet another discussion about fixing the internal wifi card or if it's a driver.
Please forgive me as that discussion has been done too many times.
Here's the card I'm using to overcome this issue -&gt; WPNT511 or WPC54G.
You can read all the banter about this at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=298008&start=0&tag=forum-w;forums06 Again, sorry if I don't want to go over this again.
It's become a well known issue.
I hope you see what's up and understand why I'm just popping in 20 buck cards now.
