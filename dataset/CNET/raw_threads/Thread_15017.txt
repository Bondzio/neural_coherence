The message arises even if the iPod is not connected and only the cable is connected. I am using Windows XP Home. The port on the back is used for a printer and another port on the front is used for a Blue Tooth device. They function OK. When the &quot;Power Surge&quot; message appears the curser for the BlueTooth mouse is frozen. Anyone familiar with this problem?

Proffitt	7/3/09 7:11 PM	1.24664826E12	try from the discussion	&quot;You can supppress the &quot;USB Surge Alert&quot; message with the following process: - Click on Windows &quot;Start&quot; Button - Go to &quot;Settings&quot; - Enter in &quot;Control Panel&quot; - Click on &quot;System&quot; - Go on &quot;Hardware&quot; panel - Run &quot;Device Manager&quot; - Open the list &quot;Universal Serial Bus Controller&quot; - Right Click on &quot;Intel(R) 82801DB.DBM USB Universal Host Controller&quot; (or equivalent, as 82801G...), and go to the &quot;Advanced Panel&quot; - Enable the option &quot;Don't tell me about USB errors&quot;. - Click on OK&quot; From discussion above.
