i built a pc last year and recently activated windows xp pro on it.
amd athlon 4000+ 2.4 ghz bfg tech geforce 7800gt oc'ed 37 gb wd-raptor 10,000 rpm radmax case with 420w power supply corsair xms 4x 512mb ram (2gb total) dvd drive lg chaintech nvidia nforce4 motherboard socket 939 samsung 19&quot; widescreen lcd monitor windows vista certified i activated windows and this pc boots up really fast.
but it will run for about 2-3 minutes then it will freeze the os except for the mouse that can't click and open any applications, then i have to pull the plug.
it's not overheated and it stalls???
and i'm not getting any internet on it either, it's not the isp though because i'm using a different pc on the same ethernet jack it the pc runs fine.
when it ran the first time i could run counter strike source at 170 fps.
how does a computer like this keep locking up on me?
