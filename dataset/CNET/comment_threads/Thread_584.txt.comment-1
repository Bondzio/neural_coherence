Windows 98SE I installed a new Albatron MX480E video card.
All seems to be working but when I go to Control Panel for display adapt.
and click on settings to set the resolution, I can't seem to get one that is just right.
One setting causes the print to be so large that it over fills the screen and I have to keep using the up/down and left/right arrows to see it all.
The next setting up causes the print to be so small I really have to strain to read it and my eyes really suffer by days end.
Is there any way to create something inbetween?
I don't remember the exact numbers but it's like 800 X 600 and then jumps to 1048 X 765 - I need the pointer to stop somewhere inbetween.
