<s> Hello, I am attempting to network my desktop and laptop. </s>
<s> Both connect to the internet (desktop via a lan cable and the lappy wirelessly). </s>
<s> Having run the WinXp network wizard a couple of times has not corrected my problem. </s>
<s> When using the Desktop, I can see all the shared folders on both computers and more importantly I can use the files in those folders. </s>
<s> When using the lappy, I can see all the shared folders but whenever I try to open a folder it hangs. </s>
<s> Windoze tells me that it's not responding. </s>
<s> So I ran a little experiment to see if this was a wireless issue and hooked the lappy up to the router with a lan cable and ran the wizard again. </s>
<s> Same result. </s>
<s> Also I can not print via the network (the printer is hooked up to the desktop via USB), I can print from the desktop no problem but not from the lappy Equipment being used; Liksys G wireless router Rogers cable modem Desktop - AthlonXp 2500+, 1gb of ram, 280gb of HD space Lappy - Acer 5024 - AMD 64 ML34 1gb of ram, 100gb HD Both have file sharing turned on, nothing different was done on the lappy from the desktop. </s>
<s> Why can I only access files one way but not the other, and how do I fix this. </s>
<s> Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> Shared a folder on the desktop? </s>
<s> Configured desktop firewall to allow access from network computers? </s>
<s> What firewall does the desktop have running? </s>
<s> Try connecting to the desktop with the desktop firewall turned OFF. </s>
<s> Does it work? </s>
<s> File and print sharing is checked off on both puters in windowz firewall. </s>
<s> As for turning the firewall off and on to network my desktop (in the basement) and the laptop (upstairs) is not only inconvenient to do each and every time I want to share files, but counterproductive to the firewall itself I think. </s>
<s> So to answer your questions, no, I haven't tried that yet, but just out of curiosity I will. </s>
<s> I did read another discussion about something similar, computer1 could see the shared folders on computer2 but not vice versa. </s>
<s> I can see them on both but can only actually access the lappy from the desktop. </s>
<s> The laptop is new (bought about 2 months ago) and I did have to use the recovery disk that came with it once, right at the begining when I had issues with NAV05. </s>
<s> I could see some of the networking settings being lost but like I said, I can see the files just not access them. </s>
<s> &quot;My network places&quot; window stops responding for a min or so, then without actually opening up the folder I clicked on, it begins to respond again, where I am free to click on a shared folder again only to have it freeze again. </s>
<s> Forgot to mention but both systems are running Xp Home. </s>
<s> Now I have restored the default settings under &quot;advanced&quot; in windows firewall and deleted all existing networks found in &quot;my network places&quot;. </s>
<s> I have also deleted all the printers I could see that the laptop has. </s>
<s> Adding a printer and allowing windows to search the network for a printer has fixed this problem (for the time being), I am now able to print from the lappy via the network. </s>
<s> Also, I ran the wireless networking wizard on both puters (I used an SD card to transfer all the settings as I don't have a floppy on the lapptop nor do I have a memory stick), this seems to work fine. </s>
<s> One thing I was not able to do is to connect the SD card to the Router, which it seems to suggest in the instructions. </s>
<s> I then ran the &quot;network setup wizard&quot; also on both computers as instructed by the &quot;help&quot; feature in WinXp. </s>
<s> All that seems to have worked well and I have selected print and file sharing under the windows firewall settings. </s>
<s> But now instead of hanging like before, I get a new messg. </s>
<s> when I attempting to access the shared folders from either the desktop or the laptop; &quot;X folder is not accessible. </s>
<s> You might not have permission to use this network resource. </s>
<s> Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> Not enough server storage is available to process this comand&quot;. </s>
<s> Any help at all would be appreciated. </s>
