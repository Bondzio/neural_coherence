<s> I am planning on a home wireless network for the first time and wondering about purchasing b or g devices. </s>
<s> It would be for two desktop computers (and maybe a laptop) sharing a DSL connection. </s>
<s> Some of the b stuff I have found is quite cheap and I don't think I need the faster speeds of g. Are there other benefits to a g network that I should consider? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Around here, the G equipment is within 1 dollar of the B equipment. </s>
<s> In a nutshell, B goes 11 megabit per second and G might get 54. </s>
<s> For 1 dollar, I'd get the G equipment. </s>

<s> Thanks--I appreciate it! </s>
<s> Doing some price comparisons clearl backs you up: I can find a very cheap b router but not a cheap b PCI wireless card--the total is about the same for a g set-up. </s>
<s> As Bob points out, the prices are close. </s>
<s> Although the b speed is sufficient for simple DSL connectivity, you will find it dragging when transferring large files between computers and just plain inadequate when playing a high quality music or video file that resides on the other computer (pauses and dropouts). </s>
<s> The g equipment will be robust enough for that. </s>
<s> Since the price differences are not material, don't box yourself into unsatisfactory performance with the slower b equipment. </s>

<s> Thanks for your comments! </s>
<s> There are some benefits to using G over B. </s>
<s> The speed issue you know about, and while it won't boost your Internet connection much, since I doubt you have an 11Mbps connection no matter how broad your bandwidth is, it would facilitate faster file sharing between the machines on the network - a plus. </s>
<s> Some G equipment is equipped with WPA (a stronger encryption protocol than WEP), another plus - and you will want to encrypt your network; if you don't know why, read some recent articles in CNET on the subject! </s>
<s> Lastly, any G hardware will work on a B network, like if the notebook goes down to a local cafe with wireless service, but B hardware won't work on a G network. </s>
<s> in a problem like this I would plan ahead. </s>
<s> WHat will you eb doing in the future? </s>
<s> thiknig of upgrading to a fast Broadband connection ever? </s>
<s> in which case the 812.11G will be needed. </s>
<s> Also, anything for 812.11 is compatable with 802.11g! </s>
<s> My advice would be to get a g network and use b equipment on it until you need to upgrade to g equipment when you need the speed </s>
<s> If you do alot of large file transfers between the PC's on your Wireless Network go with G. If your just gonna use the Internet with different computers B is the cost effective solution and you won't notice any difference anyways. </s>
<s> Also, G is backwards compatible with B so you can mix-and-match the cheapest parts but you would be limited to B's transmission speed of 11Mbps. </s>
<s> If you don't need the speed of the 'G', then stick with the 'B'. </s>
<s> It's slower, but also a liitle more secure then 'G'. </s>
<s> 'B' - 11Mb transfer rate 'G' - 54Mb transfer rate </s>
<s> In response to your saying 'G will run on a B, but B hardware won't work on a G network'. </s>
<s> That's not true. </s>
<s> B will run on a G network, but only at B speed (11Mb). </s>
<s> Hi! </s>
<s> I used b myself for a project last year. </s>
<s> I did not find that g would give me any other significant benefits. </s>
<s> However I would suggest that before you buy any equipment you check the range they provide for. </s>
<s> Especially if you use an access point. </s>
<s> Make sure you check that the signal strength supported by the cards and the access point covers the distance that you intend to use it over. </s>
<s> Also keep in mind that the g version is going to become more and more popular from now on, whereas b may soon be fogotten (I personally don't think that will happen too soon). </s>
<s> If you want to go into the technical details of the issue, g uses a wider frequency band but the same modulation technique as b. g actually reaches the same speeds as version a but there is also version e that's under construction. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
