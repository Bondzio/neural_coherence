<s> I was wondering if anyone had any experience with wireless N and Windows XP? </s>
<s> I have a D-link 655 wireless N router and a Dell Vostro laptop with a wireless N card. </s>
<s> No matter how i configure or tweak the router and laptop settings the best connection speed i get is 130mbps nowhere near the advertised 300mbps. </s>
<s> I spent many hours with technical support and still no change. </s>
<s> One person suggested that windows cannot show speeds higher than 130mbps Does anyone out there have any insights into this issue? </s>
<s> can windows xp connect and show 300mbps? </s>
<s> Many Thanks... Anon </s>
<s> Those advertised speeds are in perfect laboratory conditions and will never happen in the real world. </s>
<s> Trust me on this. </s>
<s> By the same token, the advertised wired speed will never happen either. </s>
