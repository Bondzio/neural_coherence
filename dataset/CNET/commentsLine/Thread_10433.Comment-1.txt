hello.
i am having temperature issues with my pc, as the bios is beeping now, and checking my bios beeping guide it looks like it's a temperature problem, and i'd like you to show me which is the hardware that is having that overheating.
here you have a screenshot of cpuid:  &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;this is the temperature for a normal use, i'm just using a virtual machine with ubuntu, listening to itunes and browsing with chrome... &lt;span&gt; my display card currently has no fan or cooling system, yesterday i bought a new fan, and it'll arrive soon.
but i don't know, i've seen my display card with temperatures around 75*, and it was not beeping... i'd like to know if there's a problem with something esle.
thanks in advance.
