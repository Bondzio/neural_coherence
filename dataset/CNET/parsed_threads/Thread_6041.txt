<s> PC Wizard should give you some answers&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.cpuid.com/pcw But it always a good idea to eyeball the drive itself. </s>
<s> Is this a proprietary machine (Gateway, HP, Compaq etc.) </s>

<s> Download and run the Belarc Advisor available at the follwing link. </s>
<s> It should provide all the required information, Jim http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html </s>
<s> If the other suggestions fail try this.Almost all motherboards have the model typed directly on the board somewhere.You will need very good lighting and possibly may have to take some cables or cards out of the way if it is not readily visible.Often the model is stamped near or between the pci slots where you add your peripheral cards.Many boards have the manufacturers name on it clearly stamped such as Gigabyte or Asus and the model number nearby.Take note that this letter and number sequence is directly on the board itself,not on a chip mounted on the board.After you have located the number go to Google.com and simply put the number into the search field.Sometimes it will take you directly to the manufacturers web site or give links revealing who makes it.You can then find any available updates for drivers, bios, etc. </s>
<s> at their web site. </s>
