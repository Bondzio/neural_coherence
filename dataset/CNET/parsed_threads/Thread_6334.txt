<s> I Installed a new Motherboard in a system with a 2.0 ghz p4 running WinXP SP2. </s>
<s> Now when I try to boot the system, it continually comes to the screen asking for boot type; Start normally, Safe Mode, Last known good config, etc. </s>
<s> No matter which option I choose, the system restarts and returns to this screen. </s>
<s> Any help will be greatly appreciated Thanks....JediChef </s>
<s> then your PC is not the problem. </s>
<s> XP will not let you install a new MB an boot right away. </s>
<s> This is it's behavior when it sees itself on a new PC. </s>
<s> You will probably need to do a repair installation of the OS and reactivate it. </s>
<s> A repair installation does not (usually) cause data loss. </s>
<s> You also cannot just put the old MB back now to back things up. </s>
<s> Go for the repair installation and reactivate the OS. </s>
<s> I really hoped I wouldn't have to do that. </s>
<s> But in the end, it wasn't that painful. </s>
<s> I didn't seem to lose any programs as with a normal reinstall. </s>
<s> It appears I have to update XP but that's a piece of cake. </s>
<s> Thanks again Chef </s>
