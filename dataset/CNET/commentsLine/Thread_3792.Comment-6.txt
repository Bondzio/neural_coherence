if you can't boot from a cd then you're pretty much sunk.
partition magic is the only way and it costs 70$.
but there is a free way if you can boot up from cd, and it's called linux.
go look up knoppix, which is linux that boots from cd.
download it and burn an image to a cd.
then defrag your hard drive (thuroughly.
you just want one big clump of ntfs or fat, whichever you have).
then turn off your computer and boot up in knoppix (make sure it's 4.0.2, otherwise it won't be able to do ntfs).
and start up qtparted.
it's pretty easy from there.
but... without a cd drive you can boot from, partition magic is about your only bet.
what's wrong with your cd drive that you can't boot from it?
