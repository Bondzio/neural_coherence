1.2.2	There are X1 , X4 , X8 , slots on some mobos , likely only an X1 on yours .	St
1.2.3	I hope that you are not confusing PCI X with the old 33 MHz PCI bus .	St
1.3.1	No not confusing them at all , just want to know in the even a card i get is not 16x will it still work in a 16x slot ?	Ques
1.4.1	are different for each the X1 , X4 , X8 , and X16 .	St
1.4.2	The difference is the number of serial busses they have in parallel , but not sure how the power connections are made .	St
1.4.3	But I doubt that an X1 would work in an X16 slot .	St
1.4.4	However , there is a X1 video card made by Matrox .	St
