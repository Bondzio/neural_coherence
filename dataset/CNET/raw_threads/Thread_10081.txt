Well, the other day when I turned the pc on, the monitor picture shrink until it completing turned black. It remindered me of the old tv when the picture tube was going out the picture would &quot;rolled&quot; until a thin line was in the middle, then black. I can hear the pc (tower) humming, trying to work. I turned off the pc, unplug and waited for about 1 hour. Plugged everything back, turn it on, hear the &quot;tower&quot; working but still black monitor. I tried to get into safe mode so I can do a system restore, but since no picture came up, couldn't do it. So, before I purchase a whole new pc, monitor, etc. I would like to know is it the monitor? This has never happened to me. And yes, the monitor is much older than the pc. My operating system is WindowsXP, model # of Pavilion A1110N. 512mb memory/160mb hard drive. I do believe the monitor which is a Compaq FS940 was brought in 2002.
