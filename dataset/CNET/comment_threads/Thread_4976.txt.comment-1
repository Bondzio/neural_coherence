Hi, Not sure if this is the best place for this request, but I'll try here first...
I'm looking for a &lt;100 NAS device.
I've had a look around for one, but am finding it hard to choose one.
As the ones I like have more features than i would need, and have a fairly large price tag.
I really like this one for example.

I also need to be able to connect to this device from my xbox 360, as i'd like to stream media to it.
Hopefully someone can suggest a product that would be best for both my needs and my budget.
thank you, sam
