1. too little ram.
a machine from 1998 might have 64mb ram which means that you need to increase that to 256 or 512 m. 2. the person installing xp forgot that microsoft does not install the best drivers.
update drivers from the hardware makers, not microsoft.
3. the usual virus, worm or more invades windows xp on a first install and connect to the internet.
antivirus and firewalls must be installed before connecting to the internet.
best of luck in recovery.
