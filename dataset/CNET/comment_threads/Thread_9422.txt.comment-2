Since I don't research devices, the question would be, does the modem incorporate a router?
And does this router contain a wireless radio?
If the answer is no to the router, you need to purchase a wireless router to attach to the modem.
Connect thus: Modem -&gt; router -&gt; PC.
Please answer the first two questions.
