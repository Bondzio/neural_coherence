Thanks I'll give it a try.
Do you mean the backup copy of stuff I had on the drive?
I was copying everything from a Mac to the drive and my other (PC) computer.
So everything is kind of spread out between the three but I didn't finish before this happened.
Of course I have hard copies (cd's) of the music files but I've still got a good amount of stuff on that drive that I didn't get to copy...
