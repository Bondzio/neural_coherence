<s> I recently got Roller Coaster Tycoon 3: Platinum, and sometimes (especially at night, with the fireworks), it keeps freezing. </s>
<s> This happens regardless of how large the park is or how much activity is going on, whether it's 100 customers or 1000 customers in the park moving. </s>
<s> I'm thinking it's because of my graphics card, and I've considered upgrading it. </s>
<s> Windows Vista says it's because of the MJPEG codec, which apparently is the audio and video content. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Dimension E521 with AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+ 2.00 GHz, 2GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 6150 LE. </s>
<s> Is it because of the graphics card that is causing the problem? </s>
<s> Around how much and how difficult would it be to upgrade it? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> While it's a fine choice in the value PCs it's not your best 3D solution. </s>
<s> Try it with the case cover off to sniff out if it's heat and consider finding a real 3D card. </s>
<s> is your pc freezing (non responsive, you have to restart) or crashing (blue screen and/or restarts on it's own)? </s>
<s> quote: &quot;vista says &lt;i&gt;it's&lt;/i&gt; because of the mjpeg codec&quot;. </s>
<s> what &quot;it&quot; are you referring to... the freeze/crash? </s>
<s> codecs (COmpressor DECompressor) are not directly related to the video card unless they support hardware-assisted video acceleration. </s>
<s> regardless, here's what i suggest you do: 1) install the latest nvidia drivers using the scan feature of this site: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/ScannForce.aspx?lang=en-us . </s>
<s> if that fixes the issue skip step 2. </s>
<s> 2) roller coaster tycoon 3 was released long before vista and is not designed for vista. </s>
<s> you can either install this codc package for vista: http://www.afreecodec.com/2059/advanced-vista-codec-package/ or configure roller coaster tycoon to run in XP compatibility mode: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-compatibility-mode/ . </s>
<s> one or the other may fix the problem or both may be necessary. </s>
<s> Only the program crashes, not the actual computer, and there has never been a blue screen of death. </s>
<s> Vista says the MJPEG codec is the reason for the crash. </s>
<s> I'll try to download the codec package to see if it might work, otherwise I'll consider upgrading my graphics card. </s>
<s> Will all graphics cards work on my computer or can I only buy a select few that are compatible? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> so you can upgrade to new card. </s>
<s> but a codec provoked crash will probably not be cured by a new video card. </s>
<s> it's a software problem, not hardware. </s>
