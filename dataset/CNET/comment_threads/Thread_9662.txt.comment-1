I own a Sony VAIO VGC-RA826G, currently running Vista Ultimate under 2GB of RAM (400Mhz PC3200 DDR; 4x512MB modules).
Is there a BIOS limitation that would prevent the system from working if I were to put four 1GB 400Mz PC3200 chips in?
Or is it more of a physical limitation of the motherboard?
I'm also wondering if the motherboard would support a more recent CPU.
Right now, it has the OEM 3.4Ghz Pentium 4/HT.
I've asked both questions of Sony but did not receive any response.
