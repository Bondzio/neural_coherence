if anyone has priced dual layer media lately?
I had heart failure when I did.
I can buy another drive for the price of four disks, or a hell'of'a large HD for a few more disks.
Didn't want to get into the middle of this conversation, but DL-DVD disks are just too pricy for me.
Then again you can still use single layer disk in a dual layer drive like I do.
I bought the drive before I priced the disks.
And they are slooooow to burn.
