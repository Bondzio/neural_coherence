Issue: Samsung IDE HDD 250GB Is spinning but the needle keeps going to the middle and back, over and over again ( i took it apart to see what could be wrong), But it's not mounting on any PC.
I used a Double USB &gt; Micro USB cable.
so it does have sufficient power.
(the HDD is normally in a casing, which dropped yesterday and is probably causing the issue) Does anyone have ay idea if i can make it work again, and what is causing the issue If anyone is interested, i can upload a movie of the spinning HDD tonight so people can see what i mean.
Ty in Advance,
