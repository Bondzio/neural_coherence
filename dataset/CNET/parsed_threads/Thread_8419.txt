<s> It's time to replace my old Sony 200es monitor and I want an LCD in the 17-19&quot; size. </s>
<s> I'm looking for any suggestions as to which ones to lokk towards and which ones to shy away from. </s>
<s> I'll probably stay to the lower or middle of the spectrum pricing, so any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Mostly used for browsing the web, imaging, and typical home stuff without much if any gaming. </s>
<s> Stay at or above the 500:1 contrast ratio. </s>
<s> Below that I see murky grey instead of black. </s>
<s> Always take a gander at display units. </s>
<s> If they show any defect, don't buy that one. </s>
<s> I've seen the ultracheeps with waves on the display, the salespeople say that's only on the demo unit. </s>
<s> Nope... Don't get too uptight about going beyond 1024x768 on 15 inch and 1280x1024 on 17 inch displays. </s>
<s> Most find the display text gets too small. </s>
<s> Even if it is, Windows has ways to push up the text sizes. </s>
<s> -&gt; If you know you can live with a 3 year lifespan, your gamble on the warranty. </s>
<s> If it offers a 90 day warranty, don't consider those. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob </s>
<s> Are you saying that they generally only last about three years? </s>
<s> I just looked at the ads and see that many are tft as apposed to lcd. </s>
<s> The ad has at least three or four on sale. </s>
<s> I'm leaning towards the Daewoo 19&quot;tft with tv tuner for $379 - $50rebate @ 500:1 and a .291mm pixel pitch </s>
<s> If they do supply all the data, you should find some number of hours till the display is some 1/2 brightness or MTBF. </s>
<s> For simplicity I'm using the 3 year number. </s>
<s> It's an average of what I see out there. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> As I posted in a later thread, I just bought a Planar PL1700 17&quot; from CDW. </s>
<s> I got a special price through my son-in-law's company but they are &lt;$300 and have a 3 year 2 day replacement warranty. </s>
<s> Bob is right about the 3 year life expectancy, but my son-in-law has one that is 4 years old and still going; sorry I can't remember what brand though. </s>
<s> It's just the form of the LCD, Thin Film Transistor, to be precise. </s>
<s> It's the LCD technology that gives us a near-CRT-bright display, though using radically different technology. </s>
<s> I would have thought that TFT was universal, but if there's a choice (? </s>
<s> ), go with TFT. </s>
