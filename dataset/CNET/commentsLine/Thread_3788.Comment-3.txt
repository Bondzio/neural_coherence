finds this board.
the problem is that many chipsets didn't support such large memory sticks back then for simple reasons.
i won't detail how the world has changed but i find some that find it incredible that a machine today doesn't support today's sticks and drives.
but it is so.
moving on.
might be this board.
does list a 1gb stick so all that you can do is try it and hope the stick's organization is fine.
this is not to offer a course in memory tech but to write i find the speed to not be the problem here but the organization.
