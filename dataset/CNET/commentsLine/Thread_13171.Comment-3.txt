thank you p for your advice.
on this occasion i did not follow it .
i looked for information where ever i could find it .
i found it on the you tube.
a clever gentleman had a whole lot of information on a lot of apple laptops.
i just looked at his video/commentary a couple of times then left it.
then i looked it at the website ifixit.com where i found step by step text with photographs.
i went through it a couple of times.
the end result was that i decided to do it myself.
i have not done a lot of computer work however i have been using them for more years than many.
there is no scare factor for me.
the only problem i have is that i forget the procedures of very familiar things if i am not using the procedure for a couple of months,it only happened in my early 70s, it is a few years since so i am used to it.
so i usually have to learn it afresh.my hands are steady and my brain usually works if a challenge is to be faced.
so i went through the video and the text with photographs.
i cleared my study table, in some places it had gathered some considerable dust, well the study desk clear and clean with a bed sheet for cover and a couple of screw drivers of the appropriate size i sat down to take on the job.
yes ,there was a bit of apprehension as one would experience facing a new situation,but no fear of mortal danger , a foolhardy (silly) belief that i can handle it.
i had written the text notes on a piece of paper.
i went through it one by one.
making sure that i put the small screws in some sensible order so that i do not forget to put them back in the right places.
one hour and twenty minutes i got the 3&quot; disc out and i am using the same computer to tell the tale.i guess if i have to do it again half an hour will be enough.
thank you for being there, which gives me the confidence that i can seek help when stuck.
yours shafiq
