listen, what you want to do is you want to buy the amd athlon 64 3200+ venice integrated into chip fsb 512kb l2 cache socket 939 processor - oem.
this comes without a fan, so you'll have to supply your own.
tigerdirect.com is the best place to buy anything, so buy it from there.
but the reason you want to buy the 3200 over the 3000 is because the 3200 is the most easily overclocked chipset in the world!!!!
you can take this in-exspensive $190 procesor and overclock it to 2.6 ghz!!!!
yes, thats right the 3200 can be as powerful as the $900 clawhammer fx55 chipset.
so the answer is buy the venice 3200 (939 socket) with the asus delux sli motherboard (future profing) and and nvidia 6800 gt.
or go with a nice dfy motherboard.
hope it was helpful.
