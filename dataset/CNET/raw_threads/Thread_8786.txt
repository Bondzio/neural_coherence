My issue is that I am from the school that all computer components are the same. Let me know of any product preferrence that you have and why. I've looked at Kingston and PNY but I can't decided which I want to go with. System: Sony Vaio VCPEB290 X; Core i5 @2.53 GHz; Win 7 Ultimate 64 bit; 4 Gigs RAM

I can only suggest as you have 4gb already it may not support more or you have to remove some ram in order to re-use the now empty slot(s) to populate with larger ram sticks. Otherwise, its a mute point. Alas, when it comes to brand it always nice to have the same type and/or brand installed. It may not matter but it can if the system is too picky. As already suggested to you, crucial is a good place to review and kingston is also one. The vaule of either one is the replacement or if there is an issue you can return them minus any s/h costs. review the warranty and what it entails. I have found these website good sources due to cost and/or sales at times. http://www.newegg.com http://www.geeks.com http://www.tigerdirect.com Its all up to you and I find it best review again what policies they have in order to understand they maybe. tada -----Willy
