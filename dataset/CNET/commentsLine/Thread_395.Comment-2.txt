sorry, but we don't help with circumventing employers (or whatever network we talk about) restrictions.
and we certainly don't advise installing and using p2p programs at company laptops.
at work, the admin runs a remote program once in a while to see what's installed.
although i don't know what program he uses i suppose it can see all files on my disk.
so the most safe option for you is to only do what is allowed and nothing else.
