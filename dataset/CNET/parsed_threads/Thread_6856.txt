<s> Hi, I have an internet connection (landline and wifi modem) at my parent's summerhouse as I need it for work. </s>
<s> Nobody else does around here so I get constant nagging from neighbours to give them the password. </s>
<s> I can't say no however I'm afraid they may use up too much of my bandwith connection which could lead to alot of money being lost from my part. </s>
<s> Constant and stable internet is a must for my work. </s>
<s> Hence my question - how can I limit the bandwith I give to them? </s>
<s> Can I create a second public network with limited bandwith or something like that? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> And given they could download junk that gets you into trouble the answer must be no. </s>
<s> Given you'd have to replace the router or create one from a Linux box, it's just not worth it to most folk and again it's back to just say no and then change the router to channel 14 (I will deny I wrote this) and then set your wifi to Europe settings and they won't even see the wifi router to ask you. </s>

<s> Thanks for your answer. </s>
<s> I am actually located in Europe. </s>
<s> They know I have a wifi internet connection as I sit on the porch and do work. </s>
<s> Saying no is also pretty much impossible as they have helped me out quite a few times. </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt; So in order to limit the bandwith I allocate to them I have to get a new router? </s>
<s> No other easier way? </s>
<s> &lt;/div&gt; </s>

<s> Is what you are asking for. </s>
<s> This is not a common feature in routers but folk have put such into Linux based routers but it seems expensive to run 100 or 200 or more Watt computer to do this. </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/routers/?filter=500563_5554972_ is a page about these units. </s>
<s> Traffic Shaping is the other common term used. </s>

<s> Read http://www.shorewall.net/traffic_shaping.htm Hope this let's you see what you are in for. </s>

<s> Let's see if you supplied what router or gear we are working with. </s>
<s> Oops. </s>
<s> I can't find any. </s>
