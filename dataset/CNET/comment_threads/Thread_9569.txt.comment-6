So I tore it down again just to double-check the dust.
Very little dust for such an old machine, no bugs.
Fan worked fine.
I hadn't tested that before because I didn't want to run it without the back cover, but when I did, she booted just fine!
Had to go back to a previous rebuild or whatever, but she worked.
Then I shut her down, put the back cover on and tried again, no problemo.
But why?
