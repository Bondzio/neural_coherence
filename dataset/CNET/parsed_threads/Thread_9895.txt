<s> I am running a home built Intel PC. </s>
<s> I have a Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3L motherboard running an Intel Core 2 Duo E4400 @ 2.00GHz. </s>
<s> I currently have (2) 1 gig sticks of OCZ PC2 6400 800 mhz Dual CH ram. </s>
<s> The timing on those sticks is listed as 4-4-4-15. </s>
<s> I couldn't pass up a good deal that I got online for (2) more 1 gig sticks for only $19.99 (after rebate). </s>
<s> They area also OCZ PC2 6400 800 mhz Dual CH ram. </s>
<s> I didn't realize when I purchased it that they have a different timing of 5-5-5. </s>
<s> When I put all 4 in windows XP professional crashes. </s>
<s> I understand that with the 32 bit version I will never see all 4 gigs, but 3 would be nice. </s>
<s> My motherboard does have the ability to manually set the ram timing. </s>
<s> I tried that and I am still getting crashes. </s>
<s> I also took out the old ram and just booted off the new stuff to make sure I didn't get a bad stick. </s>
<s> It worked fine. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea how to get this working. </s>
<s> This is the first computer that I have ever built. </s>
<s> If I can't get it working it looks like these sticks are going on eBay. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> to 5-5-5-15 or use 'fail-safe' settings. </s>
<s> you may also want to increase your ram voltage a bit. </s>
<s> if all 4 boot fine, then try to speed up to 4-4-4-15 and then 4-4-4-12. once you're able to boot ok, be sure to run a memory test to stress the system and ensure stability. </s>
<s> Mtrbds. </s>
<s> become picky when all ram slots are used. </s>
<s> It really pays to have matched sets of ram and/or similar types. </s>
<s> While you have very similar type you don't have true matched pairs and you see the result. </s>
<s> If you have tweaked the ram at all, return or reduce ram demands abit in order to lessen speed, hopefully it can recover. </s>
<s> You can play with the setting but start at more safe level then tweak up. </s>
<s> Further, you have the OS limits and that may come into play. </s>
<s> Then on top of that, the mtrbd. </s>
<s> may need a bios update, see if one is available for such a cure and &quot;what it does&quot;. </s>
<s> What happens when only 3 sticks are installed? </s>
<s> Try with the new sticks alone, what happens? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I tried it with 3 sticks. </s>
<s> I made it into windows and started working. </s>
<s> It crashed in about 5 minutes. </s>
<s> 3 gigs were showing up at that time. </s>
<s> I also tried just putting in the brand new sticks and taking out the old sticks. </s>
<s> The computer booted fine with just the new ones. </s>
