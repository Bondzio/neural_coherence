There is a huge difference.
Noises generated at temperatures cross thermal thresholds are well documented.
These noises will come from a transducer on the motherboard or maybe even monitoring software through your speakers.
Such noise is triggered by and not made by a device that's too hot.
You'd first look for such in your BIOS and then check to see if you have software monitoring temperature.
If your temp is ok, the threshold might just be set low.
That's about all I can offer.
