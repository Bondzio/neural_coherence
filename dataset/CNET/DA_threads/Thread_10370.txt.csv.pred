1.1.1	I have a old pentium 4 computer custom built back in 2001 .	St
1.1.2	Foll are the details : Pentium 4 CPU 1400 Mhz 256 MB RDRAM NVIDIA GEForce2 32MB While I am not a computer guy , I am comfortable swapping out parts to make it faster ( Coming to think of it ... I think I did swap out the orig graphics card sometime in 2005 or so ) .	St
1.1.3	Question is if it is worthwhile to make it last another 2-3 years by swapping out new components or should I just get a new computer .	St
1.1.4	Specifically : - What is the fastest CPU I can upgrade to using the same Board .	St
1.1.5	( The one inside is a Willamette 0.18um technology acc to Speccy ) - What type of memory can i use .	St
1.1.6	I saw a post here saying DDR RAM ( whcih seem to have won out the battle ) is not compatible with RDRAM .	St
1.1.7	CAn I swap out all the RD RAMs to some other platform without changing the board ...	St
1.1.8	Sorry for the long winded query but appreciate any expert advice .	St
1.1.9	Happy Holidays to all .	St
1.2.1	The CPU is governed by 2 things .	St
1.2.2	The motherboard and the availability of a CPU .	St
1.2.3	Since it 's been many years the problem is that many searched and used up what would have been the faster CPUs .	St
1.2.4	We ca n't start looking for a CPU since you did n't supply what Dell computer this was or if something else , the make , model or details .	St
1.2.5	Even if we had that the speed bump would be minimal and frankly I 've seen faster machines from FREECYCLE or the FREE AREA of craigslist for free .	St
1.2.6	I would not upgrade this box .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	I was suspecting that much but wanted to get confirmation .	St
1.3.2	I do see some used components being sold online but figured that would put be back the cost of getting a cheap new one .	St
1.3.3	Also , The computer was built for me by a local store .	St
1.3.4	It has a bunch of retail parts .	St
1.3.5	So cant give you more details than in my orig post till I can open it .	St
1.3.6	I think I will start looking for New Year Sales for new computers .	St
1.3.7	Thanks again for your input .	St
1.4.1	Then the make , model and revision of the mainboard is needed .	St
1.4.2	Here 's why .	St
1.4.3	There were socket 423 and 478 RDRAM boards .	St
1.4.4	And then some boards did n't supply HT P4 CPUs .	St
1.4.5	For now you could limit your search for non-HT CPUs of the 423 or 478 P4 with the same FSB .	St
1.4.6	Sorry but I 'll stick to the acronyms and you can google what they mean today .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	PCWizard2010 or Belarc and they will tell you most everything you need to know about your PC components .	St
1.5.2	If you have a system requiring RDRAM , your best bet is to skip all this an head for an up-to-date PC .	St
1.5.3	VAPCMD	St
