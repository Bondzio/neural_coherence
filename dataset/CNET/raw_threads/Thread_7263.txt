So I bought a PNY Verto Geforce FX5500 PCI 128MB DDR card and with stock cooling it can be overclocked to about 380 core clock (270MHz stock) and about 490 memory (400MHz stock), now obviously the performance boosts only lasts a few turns on Civilization 4 before becoming choppy again. What do you think this fan and RAM heatsinks ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835118117 ) would do for performance and OC'ing ability?

The fan seems good, but I have a little worry. Caution: cannot be used with Matrox VGA cards and NVIDIA PCX 5xxx series VGA cards That isn't your card, right? PCX and PCI are different, right?
