i'm not sure of the brand, i'm not at work right now.
i doubt it was a name brand.
i did try another different stick of ram and got knoppix to load but not xp.
thing is the overzealous person in purchasing immediately took the upc's for the cpu and ram to send in for the rebates.
she did this while i was away from my desk and had them mailed before i knew what she had done.
grrr.
so i can't return the ram or the cpu even if i wanted to.
i would have asked her to wait until i was completely done.
i'll try an alternate power supply first thing in the am.
this is so weird, i've never had a mobo post but then not work right.. thanks again for all the advice, you have know idea how much i value your time!
