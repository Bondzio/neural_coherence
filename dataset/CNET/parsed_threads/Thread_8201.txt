<s> Okay so I was in BIOS and decided to do a really STUPID thing. </s>
<s> I saw this place that said CPU speed. </s>
<s> It stated 133mhz. </s>
<s> I hit enter. </s>
<s> It said to put in a value bewteen 133 and 200, so I put 200. </s>
<s> And then I saved and exited. </s>
<s> Anyway, it went to restart, and I have no response from my monitor. </s>
<s> I use another video card (so I don't use my onboard one). </s>
<s> I tried plugging the monitor back into my old onboard video with no success. </s>
<s> At startup the Hard drive dosen't do its usual beep. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Do I need to reset BIOS? </s>
<s> If so, how would I go about doing that without actually going in to the BIOS. </s>
<s> I dont think my mobo is shot, because I recieve the annoying long beep if I take my RAM out. </s>
<s> The only other thing I can think of is that the processor is shot. </s>
<s> I put my ear close to it and can hear noise but I'm not sure if thats how it usually sounds because I dont ever listen to my processor up close. </s>
<s> In case its important im using win XP. </s>
<s> 2.4GHZ processor, 512 RAM. </s>
<s> I dont really care if I lose whats on my HD so much(most of it is backed up) and the other stuff is on my ipod. </s>
<s> Please HELP!! </s>
<s> PS I posted this in the Computer help forum as well. </s>
<s> Im not sure which is appropriate. </s>
<s> Find the jumper on your motherboard that says reset cmos. </s>
<s> Move the jumper as indicated in the motherboard manual, restart computer will go t default settings. </s>
<s> Try 134 next time! </s>
<s> okay will do. </s>
<s> Dont have a mobo manual but i will get it off net. </s>
<s> What's 134? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> that your attempt to use 200 MHz was an poor attempt at overclocking. </s>
<s> One overclocks the Memory bus in 1 MHz steps. </s>
<s> Thus if you were trying to overclock starting from 133 MHz, he says try 134 MHz as the next step. </s>
<s> If you want to overclock, PLEASE do a lot of research to understand the techniques that are used for various types of systems. </s>
<s> As Ray said baby steps to OC You can also remove the cmos battery to reset the bios </s>
