7969	45	558569	5290318	5287497	webserf	3/24/12 9:51 am	1.33258266e12	i really think his best bet is:	to look into buying an unlimited internet plan, so that he can get back to building his business. if you take away the worry that leaches cause, you can focus on making your business the best it can be. this might cause an increase in internet cost, but i can just about assure you that many (or at least some) customers come because of the free internet. this results in increased revenue. increased revenue allows for the additional overhead of internet costs, and hopefully creates a profit that you'd otherwise not have. consider an unlimited plan and get back to work in/on marketing your pub! of course locking down your router at night by turning off the wifi radio and changing the login every day is also a help. a lot of this depends on willingness to spend time and a bit of money to set up a &quot;walled garden&quot; and/or other &quot;roadblocks&quot; to leeches.

(keep it simple stupid) this is a simple problem that only requires a simple solution. over-complicating the thing is a flag for impassioned pioneers of hacking. it is a challenge! something to defeat. (and most of the kids out there have some pretty good tools (other people wrote for other good purposes, as well as specialty hacker tools) be secure, but don't make yourself a target.

7969	49	558569	5290686	5287501	tumbleweed_biff	3/25/12 1:57 pm	1.33268382e12	my solution ...	i have read through a good number of the posts above, although not all, and have the following thoughts: first, a constantly/daily changing password will annoy your regulars. how much? i don't know, but it may cost you business. i think your best solution would be to first, post your expectations to customers. make sure they know that the service is not intended for high bandwidth use. second, configuring your local network. as noted by some, you need two separate networks: one for your business and one for your customers. this does not require two connections. assuming your current bandwidth can handle all the traffic of both, you would probably want to go with a switch or router as the first point of connection which has no other services going, beyond basic routing activity. not even a firewall. connected to that are two separate routers, one for your business and one for your customers. if you have a powerful (expensive) enough business router, this can be done with just the one appliance. i am assuming you don't have some high-end cisco or such appliance. on the router for customer use, it would need to have the ability to perform bandwidth throttling on individual connections. decide how much bandwidth you want to allow any given user to pull at any given time, set the throttling to that amount and all is taken care of. you might want to consider a second, secure connection for &quot;regulars&quot; and special cases to whom you wish to provide more bandwidth. the first customer connection would have no security beyond initial direction to a tos agreement. this will pretty much eliminate any need of support. if you enable security, you will almost certainly regularly have problems with customers connecting and needing help. you don't want that. any type of firewall will cause a reduction in available bandwidth, so beyond the inherent nat firewall, you probably don't want one. as you move to increasingly costly and advanced routers, requiring more advanced and expensive technical skills to configure and operate, there are ways to allow users brief periods of high bandwidth but then fall back to a slower bandwidth after some period of time. this would allow the casual users higher performance while making life not so nice for the big file down-loaders/media users. you have to balance things like a $2000 router and a $100 an hour network person to setup and maintain against the cost of higher customer bandwidth use and possibly having to increase the bandwidth to your business. i like the one suggestion given regarding a farady cage using chicken wire, but i'd have to question what that might do to things like cell phones and devices operating along those lines? would that kill my phones 4g reception? ... as others have pointed out however, the availability of the internet at such places is likely a significant draw to your business, providing you with additional customers who stay longer and probably purchase more so you have to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages to any given approach. you might consider establishing some means of simply monitoring the bandwidth used by any given connection. as others have also pointed out, the customer router/network should be off when the business is closed. check around and see if there are any roi studies covering this topic. i expect that someone has done such and let that be your guide: what is the return on investment by providing various types of access? with best wishes for your success, mike
