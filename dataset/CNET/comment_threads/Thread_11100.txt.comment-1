I would like to wirelessly bridge 2 or 3 wired switches/hubs, plus have normal wireless access.
(New house, and I don't want to snake wires between floors.)
I have a large collection of hubs, wired and wireless routers and a wireless access points, but no &quot;bridge&quot; (they are never on sale).
Can I get this project done with what I have?
And if so, how?
Will I have to utilize more than one channel?
Different network names?
Help!
