Need a new PC.
For personal & business & to do graphics.
Read reviews on different companies & customer support.
They say Apple is the best, but not sure if I want to learn the curve of using Mac, but customer support is so important.
Any recommendations on a great pc and great customer support.
Thank you for any input
