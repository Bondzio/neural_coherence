what you didn't write in your post is if you installed a driver for said card.
a clue is this user's review: &quot;easier install driver than the netgear 311 but..., netgear packaged the wrong software driver disk with my 310 (they send me the 311 driver disk).
i figured if they included the 311 driver there must be a good reason but that turned out to be a poor assumption.
after wasting sometime with the wrong driver i got the 310 driver from their site and install was pretty easy from there.
it works very well.. i just wish netgear was a little more careful&quot; they had some 311's too and noted difficulty with the driver install.
in closing, i think something fishy is going on here and i'd just get another card.
why?
look over  and if you download documentation and files, the latest date i see is 2001. this is years before windows xp, so it may be just a bum card?
try another make/model.
or at least another slot... bob bob
