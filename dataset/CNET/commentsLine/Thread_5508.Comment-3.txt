any good disk utility should be able to clean up the file index on this drive, unless something drastic has happened to it.
i used to use norton utilities, but i understand that has fallen out of favor in recent years.
any computer store should be able to provide something.
since i use a mac (apple has their own disk utility) i can't advise you since my pc knowledge is limited and out of date.
