<s> I have a Dell Dimension 4600 and I wanted to overclock my P4 2.66Ghz CPU just to get a little more use out of it before I eventually buy a new PC. </s>
<s> I was wondering, is it safe to use an overclocking utility to overclock my CPU if my BIOS doesn't let me overclock it? </s>
<s> Specs: P4 2.66Ghz Dell A07 BIOS Intel i865P Motherboard Radeon x1600 Pro GPU 1.5Gb RAM </s>
<s> some of the windows based OC utilities will also overclock the graphics and hard disk i/o channels (they usually warn about this). </s>
<s> an OC'd hard disk can become corrupted very easily and the graphics may wig out. </s>
<s> be sure you know the risks and can live with the possible consequences before proceeding. </s>
<s> Same risk for oc as with bios. </s>
<s> Anyone know of a good CPU overclocking utility? </s>
