Hi, did you ever figure out how to fix the proble you were having with your disk drive?
I am having the same problem.
My DVD rom can read DVD movies but it cannot read any software disks.
I wanted to reformat/restore my laptop but unfortunately I can't because the dvd wont read the restore disks.
You can contact me at elizabether@hotmail.com.
Thank you in advance for any help given.
