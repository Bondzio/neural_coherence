I don't think you can connect to the internet through the desktop to another desktop without creating a dns server, you should buy a router and wireless card for your two desktops, and if you notebook does not have wireless capability, you need a pc card.
I'm assuming you have at least dsl, or else its not worth sharing internet.
As for the range of the notebook &quot;in the garden&quot;, i don't know it depends on the router.
This should be in the networking and wireless forum.
