ive been using my aunts macbook (1.83 core duo 512mb 667 ram, os x 10.4.10) for a short time and ive noticed (among other macs ive used) that they are so unresponsive to my requests!
i would have to say that i have seen the spinning umbrella a lot when doing ordinary things on the macbook, but it seems so slow and unresponsive!
i personally have a dell laptop with a pentium m 2.13 cpu and it runs much faster than this macbook.
i know my notebook is faster in ghz, but this macbook has two cores, so it should multi task much better) i would like to know why macs are so slow!
is it the os?
ram?
something?
this is something that would prevent me from buying a macbook because of its inability to respond quickly without halting or freezing a lot.
are there programs that allow me to tweak the performance settings on a mac to speed it up faster?
like i said, if this could be fixed, i would consider buying a mac, but they are to sketchy is responsiveness at the moment.
