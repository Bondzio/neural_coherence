<s> I have just gone from Windows 2000 to Windows XP Professional, full, clean install, and now my graphics card is being recognized only as a PCI card (under the cards properties it says that the location is PCI 1), also I know that it there is a problem because every time I load up Savage, it tells me that my card is in PCI mode and this will cause problems, which it does. </s>
<s> I have tried uninstalling the card, reinstalling it, using an older card (that still came up as PCI), and had no joy with anything. </s>
<s> My PC Specs are as follows: Windows XP Pro SP1 Abit AT7 Max2 Motherboard AMD Athlon XP 2600+ Galaxy Geforce FX 5200 (the other card I tried was an ABIT GeForce Ti 4200) 1GB PC2700 RAM NOTE: I have noticed a few people suggesting that you need to reformat reinstall to resolve this problem, however, seeing as that's what I have just done, I don't see how that would have any effect. </s>
<s> Any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> Cheers Ben </s>
<s> This is a cosmetic item with no real effect. </s>
<s> I would not fix this. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> You didn't note if the BIOS and motherboard drivers were current. </s>
<s> For reference, another discussion about it: &quot;I fixed this on my computer. </s>
<s> I have a Ti4600 on an Asus P4T-E motherboard. </s>
<s> Any time I went to the adapter settings screen I saw that it said my card was AGP running in PCI mode. </s>
<s> After a lot of reading and searching, I read on Intel's site that you need to run an Inf updater to get this motherboard (and 100 others) to communicate properly with the AGP slot. </s>
<s> I looked up the files for my chipset (I850) and downloaded the Inf updater. </s>
<s> I ran the updater (had to unzip it and then run the 'setup' program) and rebooted my computer. </s>
<s> It found all kinds of new hardware for the bridges and installed it automatically. </s>

<s> Install using XP specific drivers for your mtrbd. </s>
<s> video. </s>
<s> If needed, try the latest ones available from the mtrbd. </s>
<s> support website. </s>
<s> Under the bios, verify what AGP setting are at, try going to a lower level just to get it to work and if does, goto the next level or higher rate. </s>
<s> If capable, allow the bios to &quot;use optium setting&quot; or &quot;safe setting&quot; to restart that area. </s>
<s> If all fails, simply &quot;clear&quot; the bios and then reset values. </s>
<s> FYI, I found video to be an increasing difficult area to work in lately. </s>
<s> In many cases going back to older drivers or recheck the newest driver is a perfect match for the video card installed. </s>
<s> So, I don't find your problem a lone one, others I'm sure have similar problems. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> He's running an AMD based system, not Intel-based. </s>
<s> but I understand what you're saying. </s>
<s> In other words, eCobweb, go find the chipset drivers for your motherboard from the ABIT website. </s>
<s> Go to this link for your drivers... http://www.abit-usa.com/downloads/driver/drivers.php?categories=1&model=1 Here's their site for the newest BIOS: http://www.abit-usa.com/downloads/bios/bios_revision.php?categories=1&model=1 Hope this helps </s>
<s> The item in question has been spotted by me a few times and some descend in another spiral of problems as they &quot;fix&quot; such things. </s>
<s> Proceed with care. </s>
<s> Found out some stuff for ya. </s>
<s> Turns out, when you see the location of the Video Card as &quot;PCI bus 1&quot;, that is OK. </s>
<s> If you want to make sure, download the latest drivers for your video card from NVidia's website (www.nvidia.com), or use Gainward's own drivers from their website. </s>
<s> Also, if you are able to edit your registry (regedit.exe), go to the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global\NVTweak Right-click the right side of the two &quot;sides&quot;, then click on &quot;New/DWORD Value&quot;. </s>
<s> Name the value &quot;CoolBits&quot;, then set it as &quot;ffffffff&quot;. </s>
<s> This will enable all the &quot;secret&quot; pages in the video properties page. </s>
<s> Right-click on the desktop and then on &quot;properties&quot;. </s>
<s> Under the NVIDIA properties, go to where it (should) says &quot;AGP Settings&quot;. </s>
<s> On that tab, there is a slider that enables you to change from &quot;PCI&quot; to &quot;AGP&quot;. </s>
<s> Did you change the option in the CMOS to show you are running an AGP card? </s>
<s> I believe the default for this setting is PCI. </s>
