1.1.2	Powered down to install an audigy4 sound card and when i rebooted the seagate sata drive was not recognised .	St

1.1.4	I have read up on different forums to try and solve but have had little luck .	St
1.1.5	Each time i boot up get the following 'Reboot and select proper boot device ' I have checked in bios setup that onboard sata controller is enabled and checked all leads etc .	St
1.1.6	and that 1st boot device is Hard Drive .	St
1.1.7	I have made a floppy driver diskette from the mobo cd and rebooted with xp disc in and hit F6 .	St
1.1.8	Installed diskette and ran through the system setup Obviously i do not want to install xp and so went to repair option this then recognised the sata partitioned hard drive !	St
