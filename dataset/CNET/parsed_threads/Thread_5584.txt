<s> On my current machine I have two 500gig SATA hard drives both in working condition, one running windows 7 and the other used for storage. </s>
<s> Now I also have an 80gig IDE hard drive running Ubuntu; which I have from my old machine. </s>
<s> The 80gig IDE ran perfectly with a different SATA hard drive in the old machine (all I had to do was switch the boot order to use either Ubuntu on the 80gig IDE or Windows 7 on the old SATA hard drive). </s>
<s> I just recently tried bringing the 80gig IDE drive over to my new computer but it doesn't seem to be working. </s>
<s> The Bios recognizes it as a 2500mb drive for some absurd reason. </s>
<s> Any Ideas on how to get this to work? </s>
<s> Additional Info: Mother Board: Asus A8-NE Jumper settings for the IDE drive: CS </s>
<s> Some Asus boards, and probably many others, have hard drive controllers that are either/or but not both SATA and IDE. </s>
<s> I've seen this mainly if a RAID configuration is possible. </s>
<s> If you select to use SATA, the corresponding IDE ports become unusable. </s>
<s> Check your manual to see if this is the case. </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestion I double checked the manual and it appears I should be able to run both SATA and IDE concurrently. </s>
<s> While browsing the manual I came across this, &quot;If the hard disk was already formatted on a previous system, the setup BIOS may detect incorrect parameters. </s>
<s> Select [Manual] to manually enter the IDE hard disk drive parameters.&quot; After looking up the parameters for the hard drive, I tried to manually enter the IDE hard disk drive parameters; however, I was not able to do so. </s>
<s> The Sectors, Heads, and Cylinders all had adjustable values but when I set them to the proper values and hit enter, they just reset to the incorrect values. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
