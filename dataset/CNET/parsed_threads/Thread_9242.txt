<s> I am looking for the best video card I can get for my PC and still spend under $150. </s>
<s> The only game that I play on it is World of WarCraft: Wrath of the Litch King. </s>
<s> Currently I have a ATI All-In-Wonder 2006 256MB Video card (Radeon 9600). </s>
<s> I have to play the game at the lowest settings and would like to find a card that will allow me to play it at the best settings and be able to handle updates to the game. </s>
<s> The cards that I have looked at are: XFX GeForce 8400 GS Video Card - 512MB PNY GeForce 8600 GT Video Card - 512MB DDR2 XFX GeForce 8500 GT Ultra Silent Cooling Video Card - 512MB DDR2 BFG Tech BFGE851024GTE GeForce 8500 GT 1GB HIS Hightech H260XTP512DDN-R Radeon HD 2600XT 512MB Most of the reviews are not from gamers and the ones that are do not always list PC specs. </s>
<s> I heard that nVidia is better for gaming, so I'm leaning that way. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on which of these or any other cards I should buy? </s>
<s> My PC Specs: Gateway GT5032 with modifications ( http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/gateway-gt5032-media-center/4507-3118_7-31801238.html?tag=mncol;rnav ) WinXP MCE 2005 AMD Athlon X2 2.2GHz 2GB RAM ATI All-in-Wonder 2006 256MB video card 160GB & 250GB HDs </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2118.html For me the 8400 to 8600 chips are NO SALE. </s>
<s> Why chance it? </s>
<s> Mid Level 9 series likethe 9400, 9500, 9600 are cheap and are twice as powerful as the 8 series usually. </s>
<s> bigboy73 </s>
<s> My big complication is that according to my PC specs at least that I found on CNET)...I only have PCI Express x16 1.0. </s>
<s> And most 9 series are PCI Express 2.0. </s>
<s> The only card that is 9 series and PCI Express 1.0 is: Galaxy 95TGE8HUFEXX GeForce 9500 GT 1GB (Newegg.com $82) But according to this post, I can use PCI-e 2.0 in my PC: http://forum.desktopreview.com/showthread.php?t=236596 This seems like it might be a recipe for disaster putting a PCI-e 2.0 card in there. </s>
<s> Or at the very least it won't function properly. </s>
<s> If this is true, then Id get something like this: EVGA 01G-P3-N959-TR GeForce 9500 GT 1GB (Newegg.com $70) ASUS EN9500GT TOP/DI/512M GeForce 9500 GT 512MB (Newegg.com $80) Galaxy GeForce 9600 GT Video Card - 1GB DDR3, (TigerDriect.com $105) Any thoughts appreciated. </s>
<s> PCIe 1.0 cards work in 2.0 slots and PCIe 2.0 cards work in 1.0 slots. </s>
<s> It is not a recipe for disaster since they designed this so it should always work. </s>
<s> HOWEVER I can't speak to those that have trouble but when we dive in we find people that can't install drivers. </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> the 4670 is the fastest $80 card http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102818 benchmarks: http://hothardware.com/Articles/ATI-Radeon-HD-4670-Redefining-The-Mainstream/?page=5 the 4830 is the fastest $100 card http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127394 benchmarks: http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3437&p=4 and do not waste money on a 1gb ddr3 card in this price range. </s>
<s> the memory is typically slower than a 512mb gddr3 version and the 1gb version won't be any faster (and sometimes will be slower). </s>
<s> To R.Proffit: Thanks for the clarification, I was not aware of the compatibility. </s>
<s> My other worry about this is that the card won't operate to benchmarks b/c of the limitations in interface. </s>
<s> To Ramarc: For the price and the graphs my belief of nVidia is better than ATI for gaming is changing. </s>
<s> Is it safe to assume that the performance charts did not have the video cards paired? </s>
<s> I'll probably go with the 4830 unless anyone else has an opinion. </s>
<s> Thanks to you both for your help! </s>
<s> the links for the hd 4830 show that it's performance is comparable to geforce 9800GT (which is faster than a 9600GT which is faster than a 9500GT). </s>
<s> Doing further research on the 2 cards requirements brought up this: 4670 = http://ati.amd.com/products/radeonhd4600/requirements.html 4830 = http://ati.amd.com/products/Radeonhd4800/requirements.html My PC specs: http://support.gateway.com/s/PC/R/5878/5878sp3.shtml The 4830 needs a 450W power supply and the 4670 a 400W power supply. </s>
<s> If I were to get either of these cards, then would I be able to run them since I have a 300W power supply? </s>
<s> And if I need a new power supply, what do you think of this: LOGISYS Computer PS575XBK 575W ATX12V SLI Ready Power Supply (Newegg $30) </s>
<s> I wondered if they were paired, as in 2 of the same video cards linked together. </s>
<s> I'm not up on the SLI/Crossfire technologies, so I don't know how else to explain it. </s>
<s> I just wanted to make sure that the data was from a standalone card and not 2 of them linked together. </s>
<s> I don't have 2 PCI-e slots...so I can only put one in there, nor do I feel like upgrading this PC much more other than a new video card and maybe power supply. </s>
<s> Next time I'm making one. </s>
<s> but the hd 4670 shouldn't. </s>
<s> video card power supply recommendations are estimates. </s>
<s> the hd 4670 does not require a pci-e connector -- it draws all of it's power from the pci-e slot. </s>
<s> a pci-e slot must provide up to 75 watts of power so generally if a card doesn't have a seperate power connector, it doesn't need a big power supply either. </s>
<s> gateway uses pretty good power supplies so i'd leave it be. </s>
<s> here's an article on the actual power draw of PCs using various video cards (as you can see, the hd 4670 only draws 60w and thus doesn't require a seperate pci-e power connector): http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-radeon-power,2122-6.html p.s. </s>
<s> : the benchmarks are sent earlier are for single card configurations. </s>
<s> yeah i was wondering about that too, but the tech support at tiger direct.com assured me they were completely backwards compatible. </s>
<s> and either card will work in either slot :oP </s>
