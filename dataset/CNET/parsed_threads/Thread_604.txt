<s> My computer (running Windows 98) does not recognize the installed modem anymore. </s>
<s> I was using DSL so I didn't need it and before then it was working fine. </s>
<s> Now I need to use dial-up again. </s>
<s> I've since deleted the modem from the device manager and hardware profile and have physically taken the modem out and re-installed it but even the hardware device wizard didnt detect it when I put it back in the slot. </s>
<s> I've downloaded a number of drivers (with my other computer) but nothing. </s>
<s> Could this be a problem with the BIOS now? </s>
<s> What can be done? </s>
<s> where you have it......some motherboards have a shared slot that shouldn't be used for a modem. </s>
<s> It's usually the last (furthest away from the AGP slot) or the first one (right next to the AGP slot). </s>
<s> If you have it in either of those slots, move it to another, and then see if windows finds it. </s>
