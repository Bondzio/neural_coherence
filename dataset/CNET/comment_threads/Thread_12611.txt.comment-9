The eMachines T6524 came with a 300W power supply.
Of course, that is still not enough to run the new high end video cards.
I had to upgrade the psu for the ATI Radeon X800XL I added to my system.
Proprietary?
Not any longer.
The MB is an OEM version made by MSI, granted a low end version, but used by at least eMachines, HP, and Compaq (yeah, same as HP, I know) in their systems.
But it is still a 939 Socket MB and includes a PCI-e slot, 4 RAM slots, an open drive bay, 3 open pci slots ... very upgradable, a good starting point.
As for junk on the hard drive ... nothing Add/Remove Programs couldn't resolve.
