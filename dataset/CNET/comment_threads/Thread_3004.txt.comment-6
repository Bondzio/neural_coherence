I have gone into safe mode, run a full AVG scan and also Superantispyware.
The Superantispyware picks up the rogue Windows Disk, and seems to delete it.
Unfortunately after rebooting, it is not on the desktop, but then suddenly appears again.
Then we just go through the process which requires payment!!
The web site is https://windows-disk.com/secure/payments .
I will try Grif's bleepingcomputer link next.
