<s> I've been using my Linksys Wireless B USB network adapter ver 4 to get my Internet connection for about 3-4 years now & I know they there is something newer & better than my linksys network adapter out there. </s>
<s> I want something that does exzactly the same thing & hooks up to my laptop exzactly the way my Linksys does....just something more modern & perhaps more powerful. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Please & thank you! </s>
<s> What do you mean with &quot;newer and better and more modern and (perhaps) more powerful&quot;. </s>
<s> Is there anything that doesn't function to your satisfaction now? </s>

<s> If it works well I would not bother upgrading. </s>
<s> Even a B wireless is faster than most people have for internet. </s>
<s> You will just get the data to the router faster and then it goes over your same slow internet. </s>
<s> The newest technology does have a little better coverage but if you are not having issues you basically can only make it worse. </s>
<s> If you are going to replace your stuff you might as well buy N stuff. </s>
<s> This will run B and G also but most models you must pick one you cannot run all at the same time. </s>
<s> You need to replace all your equipment at the same time. </s>
<s> So its not just as simple as buying a $20 USB adapter. </s>
<s> Now if you just want new toys for christmas thats a good reason too </s>
