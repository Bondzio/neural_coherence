If i go and view the computers on My Network, both my upstairs and downstairs computers show up. If im on my downstairs computer i can view shared files from my upstairs computer fine. If im on my upstairs computer, shared folders from my downstairs computer dont show up. If i go and view the computers on my network and click on the downstairs computer I get this error: &quot;//Basement is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this netowrk resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. The network path was not found.&quot; How do i give my upstairs PC access to view shared folders from my downstairs PC?

A peer to peer network requires that you have the same user account and password on all machines. After that, reshare the folder. Shares made before that are not accessible. Firewall may be another issue.
