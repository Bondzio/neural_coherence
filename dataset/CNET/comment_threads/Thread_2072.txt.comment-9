I have SATA drivers installed that create the RAID 0 array, and I did do the F6 and diskette thing to install my RAID drivers.
So BIOS is limiting to only 2 SATA drives so XP will understand?
That sucks...so is it impossible to use more than 2 SATA drives on an XP machine, because thats bizzare.
I'll look into if vista will help my problem, thanks a lot so far, I appreciate the help (MSI has no tech support...lol)
