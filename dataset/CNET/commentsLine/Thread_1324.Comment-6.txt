i would disagree to a point.
if you are going to get a slim model get what you want now instead of adding on later as adding peripherals can cause problems.
i have a slim model c521 and love it.
if space is a factor and or you don't want bulky, it is the way to go and they are a powerful unit if you don't go cheap at the start.
amd vs intel.
once again it is up to you.
i have both intel and amd and love both.
i enjoy the amd for gaming as i have it overclocked and does the job well.
i use my intel for work with multi-tasking and does the job well.
it comes down to the brand & bang for the buck.
everything is so competitive today...
