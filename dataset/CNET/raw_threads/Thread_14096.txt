So a few months ago I upgraded my RAM to 3GB, my power supply to 600w, and put in a Diamond Viper Radeon X1950 Pro (PCI-e, 512MB) card. My problem is that there are games that I would like to buy...(ie: Gears of War, Crysis, BioShock etc...) however the box requirements list graphics cards for NVIDIA GeForce etc...and that's not what I have... so does anyone know what NVIDIA cards are = to what I have? Mine does support Direct X 9.0 and I think even 10....

I figured it would come out on the PC eventually.... now if I can get my controller to work with it. I assuming that World Conflict will also be ok then...
