<s> I just bought a 22 inch widescreen monitor with DVI input, but my computer doesn't have a DVI out. </s>
<s> Will a VGA to DVI cable do the trick, or do I need a new video card? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Is such a cable available? </s>
<s> Never saw one myself. </s>
<s> You need a new video card. </s>
<s> http://www.startech.com/product/itemlist.aspx?product_desc=dvi+to+vga+adapter </s>
<s> Yeah that. </s>
<s> Will that convert to digital or keep it analog? </s>
<s> I think a new card might be better ($30-$40). </s>
<s> Using an adapter doesn't change things much. </s>
<s> ok what card (or type of card) would you recommend? </s>
<s> Keep in mind I use my computer as my TV. </s>
<s> http://www.mwave.com/mwave/viewspec.hmx?scriteria=AA71196 This one is an AGP but there should be others for different types of connectors. </s>
<s> You will spend a fair amount of bucks to try and convert that VGA output to DVI. </s>
<s> It can be done. </s>
<s> However, you will be more greatly satisfied by purchasing another video card. </s>
<s> Any cheap video card with DVI output will be better than converting the VGA. </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies. </s>
<s> Anymore suggestions on a good card? </s>
<s> According to my specs I have an AGP slot. </s>
<s> I don't do gaming, but again, my computer is also my television. </s>
<s> This is by no means the only selection but is a good one. </s>
<s> ATI Radeon X1650 Pro / 512MB GDDR2 / AGP 8x / DVI / VGA / HDTV / Video Card The Radeon X1650 PRO delivers great 3D graphics, excellent performance, and all </s>
<s> If the plug on the monitor is DVI-I it will accept an analog signal and should work fine with a simple adapter cable (as opposed to DVI-D which will only accept digital). </s>
<s> If you can't find this information or you know it is DVI-D (which I'm guessing it probably is), I would suggest getting a new video card. </s>
<s> You can get one with a tuner and video inputs built in (i.e. </s>
<s> ATI All-in-Wonder cards) or if you already have a tuner card, any basic video card will do--you can get one for as low as $30. </s>
<s> You may be thinking since you don't do 3D gaming you have no reason to spend more, but higher end cards have more features to improve the image quality of DVDs and TV and better support for things like HD video and HDCP if needed. </s>
<s> Look at the features and reviews of different cards to find what out which have what you're looking for. </s>
<s> Also there is AGP 2X/4X/8X and AGP Pro 4X/8X so you'll have to figure that out. </s>
<s> Here's a good starting point: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=Property&N=2010380048&PropertyCodeValue=696%3A9640%2C696%3A9638%2C696%3A9639%2C691%3A9630%2C691%3A9631&bop=And&Page=2 </s>
<s> I know adapters are avalible from Apple. </s>
<s> Also most ATI cards now come with both a VGA and DVI port. </s>
<s> perhaps you should check the monitor next time you buy one. </s>
<s> So if I buy a new card, on a scale from 1 to 10 how much better will the picture be if I use DVI rather than using the ol' VGA like i'm doing now? </s>
<s> First of all, we don't know what you have now. </s>
<s> So, given that, assuming you have a normal type setup, lets give it a 5 if you go for a dvi card and not vga conversion. </s>
<s> I'm guessing it's normal. </s>
<s> I don't even know the specs of the card that came with my computer originally (Compaq Presario 6000 Pentium 4), and I can't find it online. </s>
<s> All I know is it's at least 5 years old, connected to the motherboard, and doesn't have a DVI connection. </s>
<s> Westinghouse LCM-22w3 22&quot; LCD is the monitor. </s>
<s> The monitor has a DVI input, but I'm connecting using the VGA port. </s>
<s> Looking at that, nearly any AGP video card will work perfectly fine. </s>
<s> ATI's website nearly always has clearance deals that would suit your purpose perfectly. </s>
<s> But if you're looking for specifics, I'd go for anything at least Radeon 9000 or GeForce FX series. </s>

<s> If your system is a little older, this would work GREAT! </s>
