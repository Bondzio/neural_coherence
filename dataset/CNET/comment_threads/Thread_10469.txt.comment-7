I bought an Acers desktop on 12/15/09 for $900.00 only use it for 1 month and all of a sudden it won't turn on.
I've call tech support, they aks me to purchase a $20 driver from them to reboot.
I did buy the CD, reboot and still don't work.
I call again they said I have to ship it in to be fix.
It cost me another $20 to ship it.
I receive my computer back yesterday, still not work the same problem is still there.
I don't think technical support even fix it.
I've call again and they said to ship it back to them again.
Acers is a bad choice to make, BAD computer, BAD company.
