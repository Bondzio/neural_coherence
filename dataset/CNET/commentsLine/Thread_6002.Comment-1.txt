i have a motherboard that support ata(80gb) and sata(320) hdd.

my problem is, when i copy something from the ata to the sata hdd and vice versa, my computer slows down, the mouse move staccato and the music is freezing,but the speed is very good ap.:50000kbtye.
the question is,how this problem can be eliminated, or what cause this problem?
