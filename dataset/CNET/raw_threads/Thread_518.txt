And when you power down the PC it's connected to it's not shared any more. And if you power it off it's not shared any more. It won't stay shared unless it's an internal drive. Don't ask me how I know.

I believe it might be because the drive is seen in the BIOS by it's model # and maybe more. Windows device manager doesn't see it as a generic but displays its full model #. I can disconnect it and take it to another PC. As long as I plug it back into the same USB port, everyone is happy and it remains shared.

It sits on my computer. Slightly modded. http://www.wayne2.net/modded.jpg Fast flash, the fan is spinning.

My external is also SATA on the inside and works fine. My ASUS MB is 5 years old now so it's old by some standards. I can even see the external's drive letters when booting from DOS disks. It would seem if you could do that you could get the HDs fully ID'd. Perhaps the external enclosure's interface is the problem.
