<s> I am planning to buy a 2 or 4 gb usb pen drive and cant decide which is better- Kingston or Transcend.Which is better performancewise? </s>
<s> Cost is not a problem. </s>
<s> Please mention the modelname if possible. </s>
<s> If one has the Readyboost logo on it then it's faster. </s>
<s> If not it's much like a chicken or ham sandwich. </s>
<s> Pick which looks better to you. </s>

<s> What do you actually mean by ReadyBoost?How does it effect the transfer-rates?Can this feature be used only with Windows Vista? </s>
<s> From what i have searched,Transcend doesnt have a pendrive with ReadyBoost. </s>
<s> I answered your question but wonder if you read it. </s>
<s> Since one didn't have readyboost then the one with would be faster so that would be my choice. </s>
