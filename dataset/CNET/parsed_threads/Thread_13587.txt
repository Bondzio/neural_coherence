<s> Ok here is another dumb question. </s>
<s> I have a coumputer with a k6-2 350mz cpu. </s>
<s> What do you usually have to do/change if you put in a say 500mz cpu? </s>
<s> I know it would be to much to hope for to just be able to pop it in and go. </s>
<s> The simplest! </s>
<s> 1) What CPU's does your motherboard support? </s>
<s> Do you have the mobo booklet that gives this inf? </s>
<s> If not, identify your mobo and see if you can get the details from the internet. </s>
<s> 2) IF it does support a 500MHz CPU, is such a CPU available? </s>
<s> 3) If yes, then you will usually have to pull out the old CPU, do some jumper changes in the motherboard, plug in the new CPU and you are thru'. </s>
