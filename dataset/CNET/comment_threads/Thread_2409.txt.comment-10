your responses to the replies I will simply suggest that you can sit down with the discs and a good sector editor and recover what you can sector by sector.
(You have mentioned limited funds so professional recovery is out and RAID 0 recovery is EXPENSIVE!)
Here are a couple and you can use this link to find others: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22sector+editor%22 BreakPoint Software offers the HEX Workshop at http://www.hexworkshop.com/ X-Ways Software offers several forensic tools including WinHex at http://www.x-ways.net/index-m.html &quot;Roadkils&quot; offers another here http://www.filehungry.com/index.php?action=viewitemdetails&id=10047 Another would be DISKEDIT (find it here http://www.clinch.ch/CLINCH/DownLoad.htm ) and this site will help with your editing project http://www.geocities.com/thestarman3/DOS/bd98/bd98NDE.html For getting back up and running the advice to skip the RAID and start with a single good IDE drive to keep things simple is something you should really consider.
The alternative is to take your problem to a professional and pay for the fix.
Good luck.
