success!
i did what you said and reseated all my cards, infact i took the darn thing apart and put it together.
turned it on, inserted floppy disk 1 of 6 to allow me to install xp from cd rom.
after a long proccess of inserting disk after disk i was greeted with the very welcomed setup page.
it sed press enter to install win xp, had another option for recovery and another for quitting.
i proceeded to press enter but nothing happened, all over sudden my keyboard had failed.
ive tried another keyboard that works, but nothing.
what i dont understand is why it allowed me to get thru the setup process then cut me off.
when i turn the comp again the keyboard works properly.
