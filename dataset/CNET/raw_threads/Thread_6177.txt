9276	1	540211	5196843	5196787	berkfan	9/2/11 3:25 PM	1.3149771E12	Tabletoy	I broke down and bought an iPad 2 and must say it is much easier to use in bed than a laptop or netbook, both of which get hot fast. I found a really nice app that lets me set a timer to go to sleep go my own playlist. I also enjoy the Netflix app. If some other show preempts re-runs of &quot;The Office,&quot; I can watch them or other tv shows on my iPad. I also have an alarm clock app that has come in handy when the electricity goes out. I still use a laptop during the day when I am home, but my iPad 2 is my new best bedtime and traveling buddy!

There's nothing I can't do on it, I can create documents with iWork, diagrams with Omnigraffle, manage my data with FileMaker, entertain my self with Netflix and all the great games, and so much more. I have been tempted to get an Android tablet lately, mainly because I would like to learn more about the development environment, and also because they come in smaller sizes. If I end up getting one, I'm going to wait for the Sony Tablet P - mainly because the compact design looks cool and I really need mobile broadband on a tablet for on the go.

Rick Broida had a post that Staples was offering a $100 off coupon on any tablet and he specifically mentioned the Acer Iconia had been reduced from $449 to $399. Went to Staples and purchased the Iconia for $299. Took it home, charged it, turned it on and it immediately offered a free upgrade to 3.2 from Android 3.1. Response time is excellent on my wi-fi and in general love its speed, sound and vivid screen. It is a great supplement to my pc and I hardly use my laptop anymore. The only shortcoming in my opinion is that when I move away from a network I do not have GPS coverage. (Just a note that I am a 76 year old retired semi-techie -yes we do exist.)

I'm not because: 1-I have an HTC android phone (with a 32 Gb. micro SD card) that does all the same as the tables (only with a little smaller screen), email, casual web surf, logmein, social networking, HD 720 P video, 8 Mp. photos, music, Pandora, Skype, GPS, etc. (i pay it $ 20.00 with a 2 year ATT plan) 2-For other mobility advanced task (that tablets or phones CAN'T do) I have a very comfortable dual core 6 Gb.ram 500 Gb Hard drive laptop. ($ 450 HP Pro book) 3-For heavy work I have a 6 core 8 Gb 1,5 Tb, blue ray, 22' monitor etc... desktop PC. (Clone PC around $ 1000.00, including windows 7 ultimate, build by me) And I don't like to carry out a (BIG) thing all the time like a tablet, because it doesn't replace the phone, and does almost the same.. So have in mind your needs before spend $ 200 to $ 600 in a tablet.

For now, though, I'll wait. And it will most likely be either an iPad (3, I hope) or a Samsung Galaxy Tab, which might be a better companion for the Android phone I'm also planning to buy. I guess that's going to take quite a few pennies. So why am I already scoping out accessories for the durn thing?

I know that there are better processors coming down the pike and would rather wait. I will pay five hundred dollars for a quad-core tablet; not a dual-core 1ghz. I would rather buy a laptop than put up with that kind of performance. Then, I want my tablet dual booted with windows 8 and android 4. Peace TeraNeter

I find no need to run out and buy the latest whiz-bang which will be obsolete by the end of the year due to some new whiz-bang. Don't need a tablet, smart phone, nor any of the other gizmos on the market. Have my desktop, my laptop, my Roku. That's enough, thank you.
9276	8	540211	5196960	5196787	canarado	9/2/11 6:05 PM	1.3149867E12	Meh	I bought a 64G iPad in May from a big chain pretty much on a whim(got drawn in with a $399 price tag) and 3 months later I rarely use it. I find it fits in between my other devices so it doesn't play a roll in my tech needs, my 15&quot; MBP is still my staple machine with my iPods and iPhone 4 handling the portable side of things. The MBP sits on my lap freeing up my hands too do other stuff, it balances well and doesn't require adjustments if I shift around in the chair, and has a full keyboard attached vs the screen keyboard in the iPad(not friendly too type on) One thing I find is that I play way more games on the iPad which I haven't done in 15 years and watching video for it's size is handy. Oh and no flash...that sucks! I guess the way I would sum it up for tablets is they are the sport utility of the computer world......can do a little bit of everything but don't do anything perfectly. &lt;div&gt; I just recently got a Samsung Galaxy S2 for my daily phone and I must say that I love how much freedom I have with the Android OS too manipulate how it runs, so if and when I replace the iPad I will switch too an Android.&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

9276	10	540211	5196996	5196787	sbill	9/2/11 8:26 PM	1.31499516E12	Not just no, but &quot;hell no&quot;! Tablet=gimmicky overpriced toy.	Me, buy a tablet? Yeah right. I'd sooner spend the $500+ on a new TV (and I don't have any plans to do that either) than waste the money on a low-powered, limited-use device that's worthless for business/student usage, incompatible with many websites, and requires you to pay to download so-called &quot;apps&quot;. A netbook (or even a low-end &quot;budget&quot; laptop) can do everything a tablet can do plus more, for less than half the cost. Oh, and the laptop won't become obsolete overnight just because a new model is released. I am convinced that the only reason these tablets are still being sold is because people are too easily swayed by Apple's marketing campaign and feel they &quot;need&quot; a tablet when really it's just an overpriced status symbol. I suspect that in a couple years, when the novelty wears off, you will see people dumping their iPads on Craigslist for $150 to $200, just as you now see people dumping their netbooks for $100 to $200.

It seems like it would be like a smartphone just typing by pecking versus typing on a keyboard like a laptop. So in that thought I am sticking with my laptop for now. A tablet just seems like a novelty item to me at present. So after thinking about it for now my laptop seems more functional actually. Price is also too high in my opinion for a tablet. The price HP just had for a $149 seems more like the right price for a tablet since it is not really that functional from what I have read versus a laptop. $500-$600 for tablets is just way too expensive or so I feel. I am still reading input on tablets and would like to hear more Cnet users on this subject as well as how others feel on the prices for tablets. Thank you. jik47

If I find a honeycomb or later tablet that is as compelling a value, I'll consider getting one. The Lenovo A1 and the Amazon tablet (neither available in the US, yet) are on my short list. Bob
9276	14	540211	5197247	5196787	dayman	9/3/11 10:09 AM	1.31504454E12	My Tablet	I got a Flytouch 3 which worked, at the third attempt!! On the fisrt one not much seemed to work, so I sent it back for a refund. The second one had a DOA PSU, so that went back as well. The third one works OK, but android 2.2 is obviously a mobile phone OS. Not a lot of good for a tablet, IMHO! I want a tablet that runs Windows 7 and then 8, so it looks like my PC and laptop, and RDC and Logmein work 'out of the box', so I can log on to my network via the tablet where ever I am. They are available, but much too pricey at present! I know I can do it all with Android, but it is a real pain!!

It's so much faster to boot than either my desktop or laptop, I can instantly check on current weather (severe or radar), check my email on all 3 accounts, read a book that feels just like a Kindle, play games (not interactive, I don't do that), follow recipes, learn a foreign language, etc. I was apprehensive as I'd never dealt with Apple before, but after researching for over a year, when ipad2 came out, I jumped in. I have the 16 gig, and haven't come up with any limitations versus the bigger ones. I only have wifi, not 4g. The app store is awesome, and I've only so far looked at the free apps. I retired from IT, and have been a Dell snob until their products became unreliable, and now own a power HP desktop and high-end laptop, and now after buying my ipad2 I went out and bought an ipod touch as well. Maybe I'm just bored with retirement, I don't know. But these two products that I bought mainly for toys, have been nothing but joys. I don't miss Flash, most web sites are smart enough to realize Apple users are customers also. I do not do productivity apps on my ipad2, I use the big boys for that. But for most of my daily agenda, I won't be without one of these in the future.

I have used a wildfire s before and I was pretty satisfied with the sense so I would not see the liking disappear with Puccini.

Music, photos and films are everything I want to use it for. For games I use my PC. So if you want to find a good tablet follow my example, read reviews first.
