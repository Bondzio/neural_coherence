well if u can run it with the x700 and it doesnt crash when playing games then its ok. but over time, this won't be good as you would be putting too much stress on your powersupply and it'll will die.
so its your choice.
i would recommend getting a psu thats 400watt plus.
the thermaltake 430 watt at newegg that cost around 40 dollars should do u good.
its good enough for your machine although some may disagree and tell you to get psus that use a lot of wattage.
