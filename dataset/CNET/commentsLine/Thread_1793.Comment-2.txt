if this is your computer,  ...then the specifications say that you have an open slot for inserting a pci express x16 (not agp, not pci) video card.
a good video card that has dedicated memory will not share slower system memory.
shared memory includes ''integrated video,'' and video carda that have ''hypermemory'' or ''turbocache.''
you can find pci express x16 video cards with dedicated memory for under $100 in the usa.
you may need a psu upgrade to accommodate the more power hungry video cards.
