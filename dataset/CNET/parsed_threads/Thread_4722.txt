<s> I've read much praise from Targus APA10US adaptors on other forums but I've actually had issues with those adaptors (yes, plural). </s>
<s> I used these adaptors exstensively and exclusively for my Toshiba Satellite A55-S136 but after a year or so those adaptors die. </s>
<s> When I plug them in the blue light on the brick flickers for less than a second and then nothing. </s>
<s> I'm not an electrical engineer but is this a case of a short circuit? </s>
<s> Any help would be super cool, Thanks. </s>
<s> Didn't this laptop require the 90 or 120 Watt unit? </s>

<s> It may be I need higher wattage. </s>
<s> That APA10US is 70 watts. </s>
<s> But definitly I'll probably go with a toshiba adaptor this time. </s>
<s> It's too bad though because I wish I didn't have to change out my adaptors so much. </s>
<s> Maybe it's my computer's battery? </s>
<s> Or is there a proper proceedure of plugging an adaptor in that I don't know of. </s>
<s> Perhaps I should have always pluged in the adaptor first to my laptop THEN to the outlet? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> But check the old adapters to see what they were rated at. </s>
<s> I do know these can burn out if the old laptop battery is less than stellar. </s>
<s> The ONLY thing I am religious about is to never move the laptop with the power plug in. </s>
<s> I've repaired more than my fair share (other peoples). </s>
<s> It's a lesson I learned by others making that mistake. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah, my battery dies out in like 10 mins if left alone. </s>
<s> I'll probably look into getting a new battery and adaptor. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
