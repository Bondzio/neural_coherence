Sharing files and internet access. yesterday my 2nd computer has no internest access. My main one which has a modem plugged into a wireless router's internet access is fine. My network places (shared files) are showing up on both computers but I am getting an error message saying That &quot;file is not accessible. You might not have permision to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. The network path was not found&quot; Any ideas what could be going wrong? By the way I have networked my Tivo and that is working fine.
