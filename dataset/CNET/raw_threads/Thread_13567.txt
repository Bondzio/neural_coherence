2623	0	526240	5128474	NR	TxReV	5/8/11 11:36 PM	1.30489776E12	No signal for second monitor	I'm using direct VGA to VGA from my lenovo laptop to a hannspree 25&quot; lcd 1080p tv. My laptop is supposed to be able to support a second monitor, and the tv has the vga port with pc input mode. However the signal doesnt make it to the tv. When I plug in the cable my laptop recognizes theres a second monitor (I can move things off the screen) and a second monitor appears in the display settings. How can I troubleshoot the problem?

The other half is that the laptop needs to be setup to show there is a 2nd display. Since, its shows that then the signal source is lost at the TV side. I suspect you use the OSD of the TV or whatever it needs, otherwise it defaults to std. signal source, like cable, sat./or antenna, get the idea. tada -----Willy
