some secondary fans don't support speed monitoring.
likewise, some motherboards/bioses don't implement temperature monitoring in a standard fashion.
you can configure speedfan to ignore/skip the sensors that aren't producing a reading.
if you want a foolproof method, you'll have to download monitoring software from your motherboard manufacturer and use only pwm fans.
