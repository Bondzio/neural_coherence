<s> I have acer aspire 3000 and zv6000. </s>
<s> someone gave me a RAM but i don't know whether they are competable with these two computer. </s>
<s> i am going to have two RAM, is it ok if one is DDR266 and the other one is DDR333? </s>
<s> Do they have to be the same? </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> mode, they must be virtually twins. </s>
<s> In single channel mode, you can use them mixed EXCEPT that the memory bus can only run at the speed of the slower [DDR 266]. </s>
<s> Thus the DDR 333 will perform exactly as DDR 266. </s>

<s> They have a program which will scan your PC and tell you exactly which RAM to use. </s>
