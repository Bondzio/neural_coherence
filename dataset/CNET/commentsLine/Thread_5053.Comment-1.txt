hello, i have been trying to play games like call of duty 2 and doom 3 and they run really slow and choppy.
i took this system requirements test and my graphics card was the only thing that failed the test.
so my question is if i want to upgrade a graphics card, can i just upgrade to any graphics card or does it matter what my pc specs are?
i have a pentium 4, 3.06 ghz, 896 ram, 146 gb hard drive, ati radeon express 200, and i have a pci express slot.
