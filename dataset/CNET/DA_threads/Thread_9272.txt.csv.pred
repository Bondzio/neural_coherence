1.1.7	Please help, i am sort of teaching myself as i go... yea might not be the best way to go... thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Is 226 a typo?	St
1.2.2	What is SDRAMAT?	St
1.2.3	DDR SDRAM at?	St
1.2.4	Possibly your mobo does not support DDR 400 [PC 3400].	St
1.2.5	I don't know about HP setup, but possibly there is a setting to determine what speed the memory bus should run at.	St
1.2.6	Does your system support Dual Channel?	St
1.2.7	?	Ques
1.3.1	According to your motherboard specs, your PC can use DDR-266/DDR-333 and maxes out at 1GB of RAM.	St
1.3.2	It may not work with sticks larger than 512MB.	St
1.3.3	http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00068983&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=424216&os=228&lang=en Try removing the old RAM and booting with the new 1GB stick.	St
1.3.4	(Most ddr400 is compatible with the slower speeds, but some motherboards get confused by it.)	St
1.3.5	If that doesn't work, return the RAM and get 1 or 2 sticks of 512MB DDR-333.	St
