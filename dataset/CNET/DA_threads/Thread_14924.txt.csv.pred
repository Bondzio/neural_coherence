1.2.1	http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card-game-performance-radeon-hd-6670,2935.html Even the Radeon HD 6670 at the near 100 buck mark is quite the upgrade here .	St
1.2.2	And it pulls about 124 total system Watts as noted at http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-6570-radeon-hd-6670-turks,2925-15.html To see if you need a new power supply I 'd use a P3 Watt Meter to see what your system draws now ( that 's about 20 bucks if you do n't own one ) then you can see if you can skip the PSU upgrade .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	So two of these are better then the gtx 570 ?	Ques

1.3.4	Im trying to play higher end games .	St
1.4.1	I do n't discuss dual video cards .	St
1.4.2	This is my choice on the matter .	St
1.4.3	Why ?	Ques
1.4.4	Dual video cards are only for those that must go there and suffer the issues .	St
1.4.5	It 's like a tar pit .	St
1.4.6	I do n't go into tar pits .	St
1.4.7	Hope this explains my choice on this .	St
1.4.8	If you need more power , use the first link and move up the chain .	St
1.4.9	Then read the review on your selected card to sniff out if you need to replace the PSU .	St
1.4.10	Here I use the Watt meter before and after along with the PSU details on Amperes per rail to make the decision to replace or not replace a PSU .	St
1.4.11	Bob	St
1.5.1	Not going into much technical detail choose any one of the following 1 ) Radeon HD 6870 : Or 6950 for more power 2 ) Any 80 plus certified psu minimum 550w : Corsair and Antech are good choice HD 6870 is a decent card .	St
1.5.2	My brother has it ( with Intel i7 ) and plays all kinds of new games in HD monitor ( 1920x1200 ) , with all details maxed and at decent frame rates : Get a good PSU .	St
1.5.3	80 plus means 80 % effeciency or higher .	St
1.5.4	Corsair , antech and cooler master is a good choice .	St
1.6.1	If your serious about this stuff it 's a never ending quest for one or two more fps or to get rid of that very slight lag .	St
1.6.2	I have no idea what size/type psu you have now ... ... .so just winging it .	St
1.6.3	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817139021 Assuming that fits in the machine it should carry you through most future upgrades .	St
1.6.4	The HD 6670 ... .as mentioned ... is quite a jump from where you are and may be a simple video card swap with no psu upgrade needed .	St
1.6.5	Might be worth a look ... ... ... .depends how high up the gaming ladder you want to go .	St
1.7.1	Jump !	St
1.7.2	How high ?	Ques
1.7.3	I really like the 6670 in this situation .	St
1.7.4	It 's not a budget buster , and it 's likely no PSU change is required .	St
1.7.5	Thanks for the added feedback .	St
1.7.6	Bob	St
1.8.1	My budget is up to 400 dollars , more if needed but i dont feel i need the newest or the best , just close to it .	St
1.8.2	I want to be able to run the newest games with decent fps rates maxed settings .	St
1.8.3	I want to play arma 2 specifically .	St
1.9.1	But if you are going dual cards , be sure to locate a vendor that accepts returns !	St
1.10.1	Are there frequent errors with them ?	Ques
1.10.2	I can run 2 graphics cards and cross fire is supported .	St
1.10.3	I will need a new psu i believe though .	St
1.11.1	I know to never stray into that area .	St
1.11.2	If the seller wo n't discuss this with you , that 's another clear sign .	St
1.11.3	Bob	St
1.12.1	You have what is a rather large budget for a video updgrade - much more than you need to & quot ; something nice , not state of the art but id like to be able to run newer games with out a problem & quot ; .	St
1.12.2	Your definition still leaves quite a range .	St
1.12.3	First I recommend you look at some general guidelines on how to upgrade a video card .	St
1.12.4	This site has good information about defining wants , system requirements , non-gaming and gaming cards , reviews , and installing video cards at : http : //www.upgradevideocards.com/ It will give you a good general information on upgrading your video card and a link to excellent sources .	St
1.12.5	One top link is to the list of the best video cards at each budget level at THG - it includes a brief but very helpful description of which each will buy you : http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2964.html Based on what little info you have provided , I think you are in the range of the GTX 560 - which is on the above list at the $ 190 level .	St
1.12.6	I recommend this EVGA ( excellent brand ) card at $ 175 after rebate : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814130660 You might also be interested in reading a reviews about the GTX 560 card and about mid-level cards in general : http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-560-amp-edition-gtx-560-directcu-ii-top,2944.html http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-radeon-graphics,2977.html As you can see in the article about the GTX 560 - at load the total system usage was 150w - 200w at factory settings .	St
1.12.7	Assuming you have no other power hunger added components , you should be able to comfortably run the system with a PSU at 300w or more - although I would recommend 350w to be safe .	St
1.12.8	This also assumes you have a good PSU .	St
1.12.9	What brand and model do you have ?	Ques
1.12.10	The first link above includes a page with a good but concise introduction to selecting power supplies for graphics cards at ( about half way down the page : http : //www.upgradevideocards.com/criteria.html	St
1.13.1	Get a new cooler	St

1.15.1	While THUNDERBOLT is interesting , it 's not getting much love .	St
1.15.2	Bob	St
1.16.1	PCIe 3.0 specs were finished and announced last November .	St
1.16.2	I have read of only on mobo with them , an ASRock board only released this month .	St
