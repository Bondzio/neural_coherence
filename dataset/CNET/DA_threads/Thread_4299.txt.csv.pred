1.1.1	I have a Presario 5000US and would like to change the factory installed motherboard with a new motherboard/CPU combo upgrade .	St
1.1.2	Does anyone know a good motherboard that would be compatible with this Compaq model .	St
1.1.3	I am told there can be issues with power supply hook-ups and alignment .	St
1.1.4	I ca n't spend a fortune right now and this looked like a good way to upgrade without buying an entirely new system .	St
1.1.5	Everything else on the unit is up to date .	St
1.1.6	It is a standard A-Slot , ATX board with a 750 MHz Duron chip .	St
1.1.7	Any help would really be appreciated .	Polite
1.1.8	The HP site was n't a big help ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks , Dave	St
1.2.1	The power supply was only sized to power what HP/Compaq provided .	St
1.2.2	i.e .	St
1.2.3	If you upsize to some over 1 GHz CPU and such , then you have to upsize the power supply to match .	St
1.2.4	http : //www.tomshardware.com/howto/02q4/021021/ is a starting point to see that you want to avoid the 350 Watt power units and skip right to 450 to just remove this from your issue list .	St
1.2.5	Another issue is heat .	St
1.2.6	The HP/Compaq case was again for a 700 or so MHz CPU with so many Watts to let so much heat out .	St
1.2.7	You 'll likely to have to rework the metal to fit another case fan too .	St
1.2.8	Power tools and tin snips are handy for this work .	St

1.3.1	Consider getting a new case and moving the hardware you want to keep to it , that may be a lot easier than trying to update an old case with a new motherboard .	St
1.4.1	I appreciate the quick reply .	Polite
1.4.2	After doing some more research I was starting to think the same thing .	St
1.4.3	Switching everything over to a new case sounds more like a better option .	St
1.4.4	Thanks Again , Dave	St
1.5.1	Thanks , I appreciate the all the quick replies .	Polite
1.5.2	I may just take all the hardware I have a switching it to a new case .	St
1.5.3	It 's kind of like remodeling an old house .	St
1.5.4	It costs more to rework the old than to just build new .	St
1.5.5	All my other hardware is new except for the old motherboard and CPU .	St
1.5.6	I 'll have to change RAM types however .	St
1.5.7	I guess that 's what E-Bay is for .	St
1.5.8	Thanks , Dave	St
1.6.1	Hi might want to try this site for memory might cast a little more but you will have what you need .	St
