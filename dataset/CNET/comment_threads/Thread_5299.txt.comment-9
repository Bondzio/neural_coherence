it's GeForce PCX 5750 there is no PCX 5250 there is however a PCX 5300, which is a value card the 5750 is a 5700nU on PCIE the PCX 5900 is a 5900nU on PCIE the 6200 is not a bad card the 6200TC is the one that shares it's RAM, the non-TC has it's own RAM also you don't need an X800XL if your not gaming the X800XL is 6800U level of power stop preaching that PCIE is over priced and under powered it's actually under priced for PCIE you have to buy in the $100-$200 range for just $105 you can get the 6600nU, which is 9800XT level of power for $160-ish you can get a 6600GT which is nearly 6800nU performance for just around $300 is the 6800nU it depends where your buying in the market for you, i'd suggest the 6600nU PCIE, as it's only around $105 and will give superior performance to any card suggested here please stop saying PCIE is over priced, and please stop saying you need an X800XL for non-gaming the X800XL is an amazingly fast card
