the netbooks of today have a faster bus, higher clock, uses ddr2 ram, sata/flash based drives (on top of this some of the ssd are the fast type though small), and as i mention &quot;most&quot; but not &quot;all&quot;.
the main problem with netbooks for the op will be the keyboard followed by the screen size based on the criteria the op mentioned, it'll be faster than what the op had, especially if they up the ram to 2gb.
