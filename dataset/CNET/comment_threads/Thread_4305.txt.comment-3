Bob what do you have against Creative Modems?
This one has worked flawlessly for almost a year.
I know another modem will work as I stated earlier in my post.
This modem is still under warranty so I can get it replaced for just the shipping charges.
However I would like to find out why it will dial in and hook the ISP modem just not negociate the correct protocols to allow it to connect.
Thanks for replying.
James
