I have my list semi set up already.
Ive opened my PC plenty of times to install harddrives, cd burners, replace psu, add a fan.
So Im not completely new inside a PC.
The only thing that somewhat scares me even after reading stuff on the net would be the processor.
I dont know why but that just seems from what Ive read to be over me.
Most of my stuff would be coming from newegg and I always read the buyer comments just to get an idea of what they thought and if anything was bad.
Most of the times its just &quot;good product, fast shipping etc&quot; Theres not to many &quot;Not reccamended&quot;'s.
But yeah once I more finalize my list, I will probably post here and try to get some ideas.
