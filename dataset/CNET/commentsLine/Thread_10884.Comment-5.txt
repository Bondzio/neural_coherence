i powered it up with all hooked up and got nothing but lights.
i disconnected the floppy, cd/rw drivesall cards except video and after starting it up about less than a minute later the cpu fan started and then stopped like 2 seconds later.
so i took the memory out and restarted it, well same thing with the cpu fan but this time it stayed running, although i did have to manually spin the fan for the ps to get it going.
they stayed running without booting up until i reconnected the cd/rw drive then i heard the cpu fan gradually start to slow, it stopped then i heard 6 loud beeps, and 3 more beeps sefore it shut down.
voltage at yellow wires is 1 v, red is 11 v. ps is a newton power ltd. model nps-250cb a 250w max.
if it is determined that it is bad how do i know it is an atx type?
being that the computer is already 4 years old, already having put in a new cd/rw drive and a new modem, is it worth it to keep going on parts?
being as cheap as you can get pc's now?
thanks for all y'alls help on this.
