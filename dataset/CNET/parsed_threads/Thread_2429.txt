<s> G'Day, I am currently purchasing a computer and these are the specs of the system that i think i am going to get. </s>
<s> If someone could tell me if they are ok or not it would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Athlon 2800 Barton 256 GeForce fx5600XT TV out 1*GA-7vt600pl, viakt600, 5 * PCI, 3 * DDR 400, agp8X. </s>
<s> 6USB2, SATA, LAN 80 GB Hard Drive 512 Ram DVD Burner Windows XP Home creative live 5.1 FDD Belkin Wireless keyboard mouse bundle 2 years parts and labour. </s>
<s> Is there anything in there that i should change, was thinking about maybe a 3000 processor. </s>
<s> The system will mainly be used for the net, study and very few games. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>
<s> Justin. </s>
<s> Keep with the 2800. </s>
<s> If you only use it for net study and a few games, that setup will be more than adequate. </s>
<s> If you'd still like the speed of a 3000, you can always overclock if you feel confident doing so. </s>
<s> Honestly though, the 2800 is fine. </s>
<s> XP pro- if it's a website build it'll only cost 50$ or less to do it now and you'll like the features / controls better right off the bat ( some builder / suppliers if leaned on will upgrade to pro for no charge.) </s>
<s> Make sure it comes with real recovery disks-not a partition on the HD, bigger hard drive ( you'll wish for more space in less than 6 months) perhaps the ATI agp card instead of the Geforce-more ram up front-1Gb at least. </s>
<s> about the cpu as thats the same one im useing on my own puter roughly same stats its very fast. </s>
<s> ive built a puter in shop i work in with 3000 in it unless you use a bench mark program you wont see a diference stick with 2800 go pro </s>
