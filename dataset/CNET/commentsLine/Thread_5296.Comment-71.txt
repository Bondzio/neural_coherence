hi jose, don't expect to play any graphics intensive game with an integrated graphics card.
256mb is low for graphics nowadays.
new graphics cards have at least 512mb, the high end ones 2gb.
you've provided no info about the computer, other than hp.
if it's a media center type requiring a low profile card, your options are extremely limited and your game playing will be too.
assuming it's a standard atx or matx you can add a very capable card and play any game you want at high resolution, limited only by your budget and power supply.
high end video cards have separate, pci-e, power connectors and can require more power than your cpu.
power supply requirements are usually listed for each card.
budget computers usually have budget power supplies, so that's a limiting factor.
tom's hardware has a good review of present cards: graphics card hierarchy chart : best graphics cards for the money: june 2010 address : &lt;  &gt;graphics card hierarchy chart amd/ati have very good cards now.
they run cooler and use less power than nvidia's.
the newer 5000 series are the best performers.
you can check out all the cards at newegg.com, use the advanced search feature to narrow your choice.
the amd 5670 and below do not need separate power connectors and will plug in and work fine in your computer and play any game at low to medium resolutions.
which one you get depends on your budget.
for game playing look for at least ddr3 memory, ddr5 is much better if you can afford it.
if you go with an amd card i'd download the latest drivers first at: source: drivers & support | game.amd.com address : &lt;  &gt;ati radeon video card drivers then shut off and unplug the computer, install the video card, and connect your monitor to it.
restart and opt out of letting windows search for and install new hardware drivers, it will install default drivers anyway.
after windows starts completely click on the new .exe file you downloaded and follow the directions.
