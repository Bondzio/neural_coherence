i'm wondering if you had picked a printer yet?
i've been looking for one for the same purpose for a few months and have not yet found one that i love.
i have seen print samples from a ricoh 811 on card stock ... print quality itself was so bad that it didn't even matter that it could accept card stock.
what i've found so far ... xerox 7400 and the oki 9600 i have been told are actually the same printer inside with different interfaces.
both have excellent print quality, will take and print well on up to 105 lb metallic card stock (stardream).
but but but both print a light gray haze on heavy stock, over the whole page.
konika 7450 print quality was very nice but still not up to the xerox, and the toner did not fuse onto 105lb metallic paper.
(i know that's out of the printer's spec range, but it's what i need anyhow).
and the ricoh didn't even compare.
i'm realizing that having access to a xerox docucolor 240 at the office has completely spolied my prining expectations.
so if anyone knows a printer that prints just as well at a tenth of the price ... that's what i'm looking for.
if you have any new information, please share!
it seems that most reviews and even the sales folks do not understand our needs are different from most offices.
everyone tries to impress me with print speeds, processing time, and how much paper the trays can hold.
i care about everything but that... graphics print quality, font handling and paper handling such as truly heavy card stock and custom paper sizes.
