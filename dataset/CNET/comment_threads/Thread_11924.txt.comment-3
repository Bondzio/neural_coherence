Thanks anmor for the link to this excellent site.
I found an ATI 8500 Pro graphics card on e-bay for a good price.
It has 64mb with tv out.
I know it's a couple of years old but I found a professional review that said it was very good card.
I know you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear but if I can improve my video, I can think about buying a new desk top in a couple of years.
