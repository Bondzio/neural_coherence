this just started last night and i'm waiting for some ppl to get home that have sata plugs on their mb's and are willing to let me try this on their machines .
these ppl live in the country , and i live in back-woods boondocks , so this takes a while .
thanx for the tip , i'll post results hopefully late tonight .
