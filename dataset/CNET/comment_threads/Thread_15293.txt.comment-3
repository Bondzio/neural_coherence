SATA is the means by which the hard drive connects to the computer.
Raid (Redundant Array of Independant Disks) was originally a security backup device using multiple identical hard drives.
If one failed, all the data was still on one of the other drives.
RAID 0 changes this a bit however.
It takes 2 drives and creates a single drive.
Not unlike dual-channel memory.
It nearly double the rate that data can be both read and written.
It requires a special controller that is either built into the motherboard, or can come as a seperate controller card.
