Very few home machines get such upgrades and Vista that came with that box is all of 32 bit so that means crazy things like RAM may only register 3 to 3.5 GB even with 4GB installed. Sorry, it's not a big deal for how long such a machine lasts. Bob

Vista handles ram differently. For example, you upgrade to a 256mb dedicated ram video card. Vista will use up to 1023mb of total system ram for graphics(including the card's 256mb). So the rest of your system will have up to 768mb less ram for other things excluding graphics. With DDR2 prices dropping why not? I put in an extra GB for like $50.00
