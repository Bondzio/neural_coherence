Another with the copy in a write protected state and the last copy not in the same building or city. That means we need 3 drives. And they need a write protect switch to keep the contents safe. Bob

The tenants of proper backup do not change. If you want more proof that backup is usually disregarded we only need to read other members posts about trying to recover files or accidental wipeouts of the backup (hence the need for the write protect switch.)
