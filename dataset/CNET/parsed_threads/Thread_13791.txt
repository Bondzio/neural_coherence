<s> After upgrading your hard drives, do you reuse your old ones (granted that it is in proper working order)? </s>
<s> Why or why not? </s>
<s> -- Yes. </s>
<s> (For what? </s>
<s> Do you ever fear it will fail on you?) </s>
<s> -- Sometimes. </s>
<s> (When?) </s>
<s> -- It depends. </s>
<s> (On what?) </s>
<s> -- Never. </s>
<s> (Why not?) </s>
<s> First, I use laptops. </s>
<s> I don't even own a desktop PC. </s>
<s> Second, I just don't have that much data to store. </s>
<s> About the only data I keep are photos. </s>
<s> I burn them to a DVD. </s>
<s> They are much easier to store and use. </s>
<s> I could use an old hard drive as an external drive but I don't even use the portable external hard drive I already have. </s>
<s> Yes, I do reuse hard drives. </s>
<s> To experiment, like with Windows 8 pre-release version and for temporary storage. </s>
<s> Temporary, because ALL hard drives will eventually fail. </s>
<s> I do not replace a drive until it quits. </s>
<s> And hopefully I have recently backed it up! </s>
<s> Boo-rah! </s>
<s> I use old hard drives as paper weights...... Well, on second thought, I do keep them around because I work on computers for a living. </s>
<s> I just had a machine the other day that the customer wanted Windows 7 put on it, and it was an old Dell that was previously running XP Home. </s>
<s> The hard drive that was on it was rather small, but still big enough to support Windows 7, but not much more. </s>
<s> We're talking about parallel drives here folks, so I added a second drive to give them some more storage. </s>
<s> Mobo didn't support serial, so even if I wanted to go out to buy one, it wouldn't work in this particular system. </s>
<s> So, if you work on systems, they have a use. </s>
<s> But if you don't work on systems for a living, then you might as well get rid of them. </s>
<s> It also depends on how big the hard drives are. </s>
<s> If it's a small one, I'm probably just going to write it to zeros (to protect my customers' data) and throw it in the garbage. </s>
<s> But if it's a big one, it doesn't hurt to keep it around in case you might need it. </s>
<s> - Yes = Sure why not, it works and there's always some PC that needs a different and BETTER drive. </s>
<s> - Sometimes = If the need is there, why not and it's a known working drive, &quot;good to go&quot;. </s>
<s> - It depends = It always depends on need, cost, and availability not to mention its already in hand. </s>
<s> - Never = Can't say never unless its too old or weak on capacity. </s>
<s> I make it a point to toss 20gb or less. </s>
<s> However, if its broken, rarely does it make past the recycle bin. </s>
<s> But, its not like I do this every day or even monthly, maybe 3-4 a yr.. Heck, there are 3Tb drives out there. </s>
<s> If I have a 500Gb and I used it for 2yrs+, then looking at an affordable 3Tb is inviting. </s>
<s> It's been my experience that a good drive will last at least 5yrs. </s>
<s> or more. </s>
<s> However, if a drive pukes at 3yrs. </s>
<s> or less, its not worthwhile to save other than data and hope the warranty is still there. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Yes, I reuse drive but only because I have an OS and applications image stored on an external drive. </s>
<s> I'm frugal to the extent that I'll squeeze the last bit of life out of any drive. </s>
<s> Current drive capacities are such that storage space isn't really a worry. </s>
<s> Smart testing and other disk checks provide warning of impending failure. </s>
<s> No specific reason to ditch an old drive before it shows signs of stress. </s>
<s> Several years ago, I saw it mathematically demonstrated that the drive had to written over for at least 3 times to ensure that nobody could retrieve the data. </s>
<s> Now, since some cd's are 3 dimensional, the 3 time write over supposedly doesn't work. </s>
<s> At a Business show a few months ago, some guys were selling a &quot;Drive Shredder&quot; that actually chops up the drive into tiny metal and plastic pieces that resembles the way a paper shredder works. </s>
<s> How important is your data? </s>
<s> How paranoid are you? </s>
<s> Do you think a hammer and saw could accomplish the same thing? </s>
<s> I am using an acer aspire desktop - last one til they started making laptops only, and it is loaded. </s>
<s> BUT I keep my old HP brand XP with upgrade for some of my games that do not trade up easily. </s>
<s> My Acer Aspire is running on Windows 7, and I had to do some fancy footware to get it to go on some of the games written for much simpler machines. </s>
<s> SO some things I doubt would go to Windows 8. </s>
<s> Therefore the XP is still on board. </s>
<s> I can save other stuff, like family pictures on it as well. </s>
<s> Who prints pictures? </s>
<s> My addresses for email are on it as well. </s>
<s> some are changed, but the really old ones are still somewhat useful. </s>
<s> There are just enough things that just don't transfer from machine to machine - like the pinball machine! </s>
<s> I love it, but it won't transfer out of HP-XP to the Aspire. </s>
<s> Darn! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Once replaced the 4GB hard drive with a 32, kept the old one just the way it came out; the self-installed OS did miss some tricks which the manufacturer had included, and I was glad to swap back to the old drive for OS, swapfile and most used software, installed remaining software and copied all files to the large drive. </s>
<s> Regularly sort saved items and transfer all I want to keep to external HD, thus built-in HD remains spacious enough to hold installed software and current files. </s>
<s> And this way there is an external back-up in case notebook goes AWOL. </s>
<s> Re-using the old HD is likely more an enthusiast thing, where people replace a 500GB drive with a 750, or a 5400RPM with 7200. </s>
<s> As an aside, for me, speed really increased when adding RAM, not when upgrading the HD. </s>
<s> Also ensure better cooling of notebook - i.e. </s>
<s> not using it on a warm lap as that way the thermal envelope is less likely to be reached - meaning the cpu and HD slow down when reaching around 50C to avoid overheating, on my desk the surrounds are 20C, on my lap 35C. </s>
<s> It's the main cause of slow computer when room temperature reaches 30C. </s>
<s> But I digress. </s>
<s> Time to make jewelry and recover some really 'neat' magnets to play with from the HDD case! </s>
