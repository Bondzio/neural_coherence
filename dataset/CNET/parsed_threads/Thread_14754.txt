<s> I currently use a Powerbook, and I access the internet though our AirPort Extreme router. </s>
<s> Recently, for some reason, although I am on the right network, and signal strength is full - I am unable to connect to the internet! </s>
<s> I've called my provider, and everything is fine on their end according to their systems. </s>
<s> I've tried power cycling, and checking my settings, and everything SEEMS to be ok. Am I doing something wrong? </s>
<s> What do I do? </s>
<s> I am very frustrated. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Can you connect to the Internet if you connect your Powerbook directly to the Modem or Router (Not the Airport Extreme) using ethernet cable? </s>
<s> If no, then there could be a problem with your Modem or Router. </s>
<s> If yes, Reset the Airport Extreme and run the Airport Setup assistant again. </s>

<s> Thank you for your reply. </s>
<s> However, I am still unable to connect. </s>
<s> Anything else you would suggest? </s>
<s> It is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> The frustration unfortunately remains... </s>
<s> using ethernet cable directly to the Modem or Router, then the problem is not in the Airport. </s>
<s> You have to establish a connection to the internet first to rule out all the variables. </s>
<s> Shut down everything, modem/router/switches/airport/computer. </s>
<s> Connect the computer directly to the modem. </s>
<s> Make sure the computer is set to expect an IP address via DHCP or if you are using PPPoE, that everything in that section is correct. </s>
<s> Connect should be via Built-in Ethernet. </s>
<s> Bring them back up in the same order, waiting for each one to become ready before firing up the next one. </s>
<s> Once the modem and computer are back up, try to get on-line. </s>
<s> Take a look at the Network Preferances pane and see if the computer has an IP address. </s>
<s> If it starts with 169, shut it all down and try again. </s>

<s> My MacBook is connected to the internet via my Airport Extreme transceiver/router. </s>
<s> Suddenly it fails to connect to the internet although signal strength is high. </s>
<s> When I abandon the Extreme and opt for the plain old wifi offered on the primary household system, voila! </s>
<s> Internet. </s>
<s> But the Extreme is faster and preferred on this machine. </s>
<s> I have recycled power on the Extreme's hardware unit. </s>
<s> No joy. </s>
<s> I'm running OS-X, 10.5.2. </s>
<s> No software updates pending. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Why/how do you have both a regular router and the airport ex? </s>
<s> How about using just the Airport Extreme to serve as the main/only router? </s>
<s> It's N, but backwards compatible to work with your old G or B wireless devices. </s>
<s> two separate networks, one upstairs and one downstairs, and for this he uses two routers. </s>
<s> Refer to the network forum for more details P </s>
<s> both my mini-mac and my powerbook have a strong airport signal from my airport extreme base station. </s>
<s> The internet connection always works on the mini-mac (running10.5.4). </s>
<s> The internet connection is sporadic on the powerbook G4 (OS 10.4.11). </s>
<s> Like now there is no internet, but the airport signal strength is great. </s>
<s> Restarting the base station or the Powerbook does not solve the problem. </s>
<s> You had this problem in the past. </s>
<s> What was your solution? </s>
