i have an hp dv2000z laptop(ie amd chips) w an interal broadcom wireless b/g card w bluetooth.
it has been working for a year.
all of a sudden the computer cannot detect it.
strangely the bluetooth seems to work fine.
button switch is blue.
wireless just doesn't work.
no networks detected.
card not even there.
is it something loose?
card just fritzed out?
can an automatic update interfere w something?
i don't think it's a driver issue, but then again...
