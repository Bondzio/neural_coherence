i am having exactly the same problem with a used dell latitude i just purchased.
i can connect to my network at home but when i try to connect here at work the laptop sees the network, says i have excellent signal strength but limited or no connectivity.
when i try to repair the connection the laptop is unable to acquire a new ip.
the router is a linxsys wap54g.
can anyone help?
