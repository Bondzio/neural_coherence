<s> I noticed two ip addresses reserved with DCHP on my home wireless. </s>
<s> From IP addresses I can't seem to figure out who these belong to at home. </s>
<s> All connected computers and devices are accounted for. </s>
<s> Could these possibly be someone(s) hacking to my wireless to connect to internet? </s>
<s> Or are these for modem setup, etc.? </s>
<s> Can anyone help please. </s>
<s> I don't want to block them w/o knowing if they are legitimate or not. </s>
<s> Thx. </s>
<s> These are under your control so block away and if a printer stops, you can change it back. </s>
<s> And yes to your hack question. </s>
<s> It could be something the person that set it up did but it's your network. </s>
<s> Control it or let others control it. </s>

<s> You should be able to see the MAC address associated with the IP. </s>
<s> When I see a MAC that I don't recognize, I copy and paste into a site like this one . </s>
<s> Sometimes it doesn't return a straightforward result, but it might give you a clue to which device it belongs. </s>
<s> I also keep a list of all MAC addresses for devices I own for future reference. </s>
