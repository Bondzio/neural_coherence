unless we have the entire package to consider, you can find confirmation of such claims and proof that such claims are false.
you need the package to see which is the better deal.
however.
and this is the big one, today you should be finding great values in the old ddr2 based systems.
if value overrides the performance issues them post a question about the packages you are considering to see what people think.
to pick a system just on memory type is a bad idea unless there is a reason such as you paid thousands for some old memory and you must get more years of use.
