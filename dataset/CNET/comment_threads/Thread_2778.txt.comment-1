I need to take a HDD out of a HP Pavilion machine to use in another machine?
I opened the side panel & unscrewed the screw.
On the other side I can't access the screw coz there's this metal plate that covers the entire side.
The motherboard and everthing is attached to it.
How do I get the HDD out of that machine?
