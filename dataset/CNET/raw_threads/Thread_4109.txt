Could someone help me with steps to recovery of data? My seems to run fine, computer says there are no errors, but I don't see the drive as being recognized on my computer. What should I do first? Can I start with &quot;testdisk&quot;, and I can I download that from the internet? Actual drive inside the case is a Magnetic Data Technologies Drive, 500GB Thanks Mark

I don't work in IT, I'm a Mech Engineer, so I'm out of my area of expertise.

The reason for multiple choices is that no two failures are alike. If none of the self help items are possible then the companies we know do this work are listed in the forum sticky. Remember that backup copies are very cheap compared to recovery. Bob
