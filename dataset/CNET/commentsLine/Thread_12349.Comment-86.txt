im being using a belkin ap for one year and it's pretty good.
it can reach more than 100 meters even if concrete walls are present.
the configuration is easy.
i had some problems some weeks ago after updgrading firmware (for the first time i had to reset it).
but in general it's a pretty good product.
linksys is also pretty good.
i changed my router (the modem itself) for a wireless router and it's all working pretty well.
the security is extremely good (of course, they have a little bit of cisco net knowledge).
i hadn't problems to configure but i think they could make some settings more accessible for average users.
i having almost the same signal coverage that i used to have with the belkin ap (of course the belkin is a dedicated ap).
i thought to sell my belkin ap but i could use it as bridge.
i'm pleased with both brands.
