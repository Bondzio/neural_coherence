about 6 months ago, a thunderstorm was in the area and caused lightning to go through my computer (which was turned off, but unfortunately not unplugged).
when i attempted to turn it on the next day the only thing that came on was a fan somewhere in the computer.
i tested out the hard drive in another computer and it came up fine; the cd-rom drive works as well.
is there anyway the problem could be the power supply unit?
or is that not likely the problem?
