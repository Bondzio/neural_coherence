<s> I am getting stuck on this and I hope someone out there can help. </s>
<s> My desktop disk storage has gotten out of controll. </s>
<s> At present I have two hard drives on the first IDE channel and one hard drive and a DVD/r on the other. </s>
<s> Here is my delima. </s>
<s> I want to eliminate two of the hard drives that do not contain the operating system and replace it with one large one. </s>
<s> I want the other slot to become a second DVD/r drive. </s>
<s> of the two drives I want to replace one has one partition on it and the other has three. </s>
<s> I am thinking I can use Ghost to make an image of all drives on a seperat external drive and then install the new large one and copy images to it. </s>
<s> Will that work? </s>
<s> Will I be able to keep current drive letter assignments? </s>
<s> I am a little gun shy since I don't want to reinstall everything. </s>
<s> Thanks Gary </s>

<s> 2 partitions C: OS and all APPS D: ALL DATA B. </s>
<s> 2 partitions E: small partition for swapfile F: images of C: and D: If the OS gets corrupt ... get the image of C: from F: and restore it with Ghost. </s>
<s> If drive primary drive dies....replace it and restore C: and D: from the images on F: with Ghost. </s>
<s> If you get a windfall...then put the images of C: and D: on an external...just in case. </s>
<s> Trust me, it works and works well. </s>
<s> Retail versions of HD's usually come with a drive copy utility. </s>
<s> You just add the new drive to your system and use the utility CD to copy the image of the HD with your OS to the new drive. </s>
<s> If you purchase an OEM drive, you can download the HD utility form the HD mfg. </s>
<s> Example: Western Digital offers ''Data Lifeguard Tools'' for their HD's. </s>
