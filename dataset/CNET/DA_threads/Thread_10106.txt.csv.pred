1.1.1	Hi , just got this iBook 12 & quot ; in the mail been to a mac shop before i bought it where the owner was told the screen had died .	St
1.1.2	Motherboard was said to be Ok by the repairer I replaced the screen with a know working one and the screen was dead .	St
1.1.3	Then after the fiddle of pulling it apart again wondered if i could use the hard drive on another ibook .	St
1.1.4	The hard drive i put in another iBook which loaded up fine with display .	St
1.1.5	later i tried again but it was a dead screen ?	Ques
1.1.6	*Is it that both ibooks have faulty motherboards ?	Ques
1.1.7	Motherboard determines a display ?	Ques
1.1.8	Or could it be the display module ?	Ques
1.1.9	What else could cause dead screen ?	Ques
1.1.10	Cables good .	Polite
1.1.11	Cheers Cas	St
1.2.1	then try applying pressure , squeezing , to the left of the trackpad but on the same level You may be surprised at the results .	Sug
1.2.2	The iBook G4 was notorious for this problem which is caused by broken solder joints on the graphics chip connections to the logicboard .	St
1.2.3	P	St
1.3.1	Hi , thanks i pressed on the area and there was sort of change .	Polite
1.3.2	it opened up on it 's own last night and worked perfectly , some flashing of screen , but worked .	St
1.3.3	Can the solder joints be repaired ?	Ques
1.3.4	Read that you can re-heat this area to re-solder/ place bit of lino in case to pressure the spot ... ... ... ... . Or do you just end up with a pile of un-fixable ibooks ?	Ques
1.3.5	Is the earlier Clamshell less faulty ?	Ques
1.3.6	Cheers Cas	St
1.4.1	the trick is to find someone who can do it .	St
1.4.2	Google for it , there are places that specialize in all sorts of things .	St
1.4.3	The earlier clamshells were less faulty but , on the other hand , they only had a G3 processor , went slower , not all had Firewire but they were built like the proverbial outhouse .	St
1.4.4	P	St
