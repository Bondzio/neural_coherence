Here at home I still have dial up for my internet which is hooked up to my desktop. I rescently acquired a wireless laptop at a very good price. Can I create a wireless network and be able to use my laptop within the house as my existing desktop and dial as the source? What do I need to make this happen? Thanks for any help

By this, I mean get them connected via the wireless devices. Once this is working, you can configure ICS (internet connection sharing). Your desktop hosts the internet connection. A call from the laptop to the desktop can initiate the dial up process. It can be done. Hope this answers your basic question.
