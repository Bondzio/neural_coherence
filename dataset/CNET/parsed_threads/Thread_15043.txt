<s> Hi I have a Hp pavillion a220n and my 300w power supply died. </s>
<s> I have no idea what i should buy for it. </s>
<s> Does anyone happen to know if a APEVIA ATX-CW500WP4 500W ATX Power Supply would work in it? </s>
<s> I found it on Newegg.com. </s>
<s> Got really good reviews and has a very good price. </s>
<s> My specs are: Hp Pavillion a220n Amd athlon running 2.08ghz 2gb ddr ram 120gb hdd Came with factory 300w power supply. </s>
<s> And you need 400W because ........... ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Well i just figured it would be better, and i have a newer video card too and it needs 400w or better. </s>
<s> And i did find a really good price on a 500w one.Since the original died id rather not go back to 300w. </s>
<s> But the maker of the power supply i have right now is Delta Electronics. </s>
<s> Like i asked before, Could a 500w run in my system? </s>
<s> DLT250QB4A 00 </s>
<s> Regardless of what PSU you install, the system will use only what it needs. </s>
<s> Just have to make sure the PSU you pick is wired to work with your system VAPCMD </s>
<s> How do i tell what my computers wiring is, or do i have to go and take out the already dead power supply? </s>
<s> will do the job as long as it fits physically. </s>
<s> To be sure about the size, you'll just have to measure the old PSU and check the dimensions on the new PSU before buying. </s>
<s> The first three PSUs are listed as replacements from an aftermarket PSU website. </s>
<s> The last link is for a quality PSU from Newegg.com. </s>
<s> http://www.atxpowersupplies.com/300-watt-power-supply-fsp-atx-300-gu.php http://www.atxpowersupplies.com/400-watt-power-supply-ap-mps3atx40.php http://www.atxpowersupplies.com/500-watt-atx-power-supply-AX500-A.php http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139003 Based on quality, efficiency (use of electricty to power the PC), performance and warranty..the last entry from Newegg at $49.99 after rebate would be my pick unless you want more WATTAGE and AMPS for now and to carry over for a future PC. </s>
<s> Your call ...let us know which you pick and how it works. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...For what its worth, Apevia PSUs wouldn't be on the list of PSUs to put in one of my systems. </s>
<s> And i looked at the Output source of the old psu. </s>
<s> It works with 115-230V. </s>
<s> Its output is +5v/25A +12v/14A +5vsb/2A +3.3v/18A -12v/0.8A would it work in this BFG? </s>
<s> : http://www.circuitcity.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4898173&CatId=1078 The dimensions work fine in my PC, just a little less room for my cd Rom and DVD Rom cables but it would be fine.I just don't know if the Output has to be dead on to work with my machine. </s>
<s> with 25 AMPs and 304W rating on the 12V line. </s>
<s> Gave you a great recommendation for a highly rated, efficient, quality PSU 33AMPs and 396 WATTs 12V...that'll be my final recommendation. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> your first recommendation is only because i have only $40, I'm 15 yo and cant get a job yet. </s>
<s> I'm sorry but do yo have any other suggestions for a PSU that's not as pricey? </s>
<s> I understand what rails do and what not, and without a high rail voltage the psu will probably be horrible. </s>
<s> I just need something 400w or above that's good for about or less then $40. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> that clear upfront. </s>
<s> I've spent a lot of time trying to help you without the benefit of knowing that important piece of info. </s>
<s> Before going any further, do you really need 400W and if so ...what did you add or plan to add that bumps the need from 300W to 400W. </s>
<s> If you added a video card or you want to add a video card ....which one did you add or are you looking at? </s>
<s> Is that $40 including including shipping and rebates? </s>
<s> Have you talked with your folks about spending a little more upfront assuming the higher cost PSU is more efficient and actually uses less electricity than the cheaper PSU ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> but i learned for next time to say that right up front, totally my fault. </s>
<s> But what i am trying to install is a ATI Radeon Santa Cruz video card, and it needs a minmum of 300w, but i would like to bump my power supply up to 400w or so. </s>
<s> Any other good brands for cheap? </s>
<s> Ill ask my parents if they can help me out with maybe a better one. </s>
<s> Because I'm not getting a new computer until i go to college, that's another 2 years. </s>
<s> So any suggestions? </s>
<s> If not it's fine, i can just get that first one you suggested, it does seem very well made. </s>
<s> gave me nothing on ATI Radeon Santa Cruz And you already have it, the video card ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS&gt;&gt;&gt;When I buy PC stuff..I want good stuff that's highly reliable, durable, stable, good warranty, efficient where applicable, over spec (head room or expansion room), perhaps reusable in another PC, etc., sending stuff back, returning it is a pain that I avoid. </s>
<s> Its a pretty decent video card for pc 2700 machines and pc 3200. </s>

<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Man they all look like pretty good psu's but the Corsair looks like the price for a 400w and 12v/30a is really good at only $40. </s>
<s> Maybe ill just convince my parents and get that one, looks the best out of the bunch. </s>
<s> Thanks so much for helping! </s>
