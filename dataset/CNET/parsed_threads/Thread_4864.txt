<s> I mean to leave a pc (XP Pro) unattended for weeks, collecting data from meteorological instruments for a moment every hour or so. </s>
<s> The site has a 30w solar panel and lead-acid batteries with about 100 amp-hours available before the charge controller turns off the load for low battery voltage. </s>
<s> Days could pass before the sun comes out enough to charge the batteries, so I want to reduce the power requirement of the pc as much as possible. </s>
<s> It has solid state IDE storage, video disabled and an external 12v power supply, and needs about 20w when active. </s>
<s> That load would use up the batteries in less than three days of no sun. </s>
<s> I'm thinking that if the pc could download the met data and go into standby until the next data is available, the power use could be reduced by a factor of ten or so. </s>
<s> The sun and batteries could easily keep up with that. </s>
<s> I'd set the no-activity interval to 5 minutes to get the pc to go into standby. </s>
<s> How to wake it up again? </s>
<s> After the met data logger has accumulated 175 datasets, it sends them to the pc on a serial port so maybe I could use activity on a serial line to activate the USB-wakeup function of the pc. </s>
<s> I would be grateful for comments on this idea and suggestions for better approaches, that solve the basic problem that I need more power or less consumption. </s>
<s> I have this netbook I put on the Watt Meter and it draws 9 Watts when running and the screen has shut off. </s>
<s> For reference the make and model is the eMachines 250-1162. </s>
<s> I've used both bluetooth and usb to serial converters with it along with apps I've written. </s>
<s> For even lower power I've used Windows Mobile phones with the apps in C# and the serial connection via bluetooth serial ports. </s>
<s> As to your method, you may have to try it. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> I wish I'd known about the eMachines 250-1162 before I got so far down the road I'm on. </s>
<s> As to waking up, it could be just a matter of the bios set to wake on usb activity. </s>
<s> Or you researching the use of the windows scheduler. </s>
<s> From memory, the current versions of Windows 7 can wake from sleep when scheduled. </s>
<s> This is not an offer to write the app but to chat about how to research it further. </s>
<s> And to share that apps on windows mobile up to 6.5 is fairly easy with Visual Studio Pro 2008. </s>
<s> I demo &quot;your first app in 5 minutes&quot; on that so it can't be more than a few days for your average programmer to have their first WM apps out and running. </s>
<s> I think my Pharos m619 tops out at 2 Watts with everything going (GPS, Cell Phone, WIFI and Bluetooth.) </s>
<s> So it makes for a fine little data collector. </s>
<s> And with the cell phone it can email home the data. </s>
