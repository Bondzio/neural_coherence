<s> Two years ago, I upgraded from a humongous CRT to a LCD flat screen monitor. </s>
<s> I came to CNET and reviewed a bunch. </s>
<s> I've dealt with Gateway in the past, had an account I could charge on, and decided to buy the FPD2185W. </s>
<s> At the time it had good reviews wtih the editors here and it seemed like a good deal. </s>
<s> So, I bought it. </s>
<s> It was beautiful and the picture was great. </s>
<s> Now...two years later...it just DIED. </s>
<s> I shut down one night and the next day it wouldn't turn on. </s>
<s> I took my computer and monitor to a repair facility. </s>
<s> They hooked up the monitor to a different computer but it still didn't turn on. </s>
<s> Decision: it is not working. </s>
<s> And the facility I took it too didn't repair monitors. </s>
<s> I came home and jumped on CNET and found that that particular monitor was a piece of junk. </s>
<s> Many, many people have had the same problems. </s>
<s> And to top it all off, Gateway's technical support (which was great in 2000) was rude and just not available. </s>
<s> They would not stand behind their monitor. </s>
<s> It was a year out of warranty. </s>
<s> I WILL NEVER EVER BUY FROM GATEWAY AGAIN. </s>
<s> And I suggest to anyone out there run far from Gateway. </s>
<s> There is a reason their business tanked. </s>
<s> Now I am going to buy a new monitor. </s>
<s> The guys at the repair facility said buy Univision and that Costco has them. </s>
<s> My experience with Costco is great and they STAND BEHIND everything they sell. </s>
<s> We've had great luck with them when a microwave died. </s>
<s> So, I'm inclined to buy what they have. </s>
<s> Their concierge service is known to be great. </s>
<s> So, what monitor do you guys out there suggest as far as dependability and after the sale service? </s>
<s> I liked the 21&quot; but will consider a 19&quot; if it will last me longer than 2 years. </s>
<s> Not to be picking on you but really, &quot;would you honor a warranty that's 1 yr. out of date&quot;? </s>
<s> Most companies would pretty much give you the same answer, no. </s>
<s> If you like verify any warranty policy on the next LCD monitor and if offered see if an &quot;extended warranty&quot; is worth your time and possible added cost. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Well Willy, You were being a bit nit-picky to have that answer. </s>
<s> And it's obvious you have not shopped at Costco. </s>
<s> They stand behind their products even when they were out of warranty. </s>
<s> Many of our friends, as well as myself, have taken things back that were way out of warranty and THEY COVERED THEM FULLY. </s>
<s> Go back under your rock and quit picking on people on the message boards just because you have too much time on your hands. </s>
<s> Your response was annoying and not at all helpful. </s>
<s> I wanted monitor information, not your snippy remarks. </s>
