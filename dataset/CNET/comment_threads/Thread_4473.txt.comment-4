Idk how I would do the media thing.. but when I tried to do all the restore points and everything I was not able to.
It was all because the hard drive was 'missing' and when I would look at the hard drive in some windows it wouldn't show the amount of memory it had and when I opened it, it would have no files in it.
so I ended up popping off the back to make sure it was secure.
And as far as the history of the damage.
Apparently this was my friend's friend's computer.
And she one day got pissed off and threw it to the ground and punched it.
Then when she started the computer it started with the whole broken bootmgr.
