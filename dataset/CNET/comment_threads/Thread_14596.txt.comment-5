Bob, No, you didn't miss anything.
I could have clarified better.
For now, I'm perfectly content with dial-up.
And for now I would only want to use the router as a hub for my wired network and as a WAP to connect my new Wi-Fi enabled laptop wirelessly to since I basically just use the wired network now for backups.
But 'down the road' I would still have the router functionality once I decide to get broadband cable or DSL.
(Re dial-up Internet access: For 'grins', I occasionally run PCAnywhere 'host' on one computer to connect to the Internet and then browse from another PCAnywhere 'client' computer via the wired network.
Kludgey and not exactly super fast, but it works !
Of course, until I get broadband cable or DSL, I'll probably also want to try this wirelessly for 'grins.')
Many thanks, Tom
