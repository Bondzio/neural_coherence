(buy one with embedded sound and video) with new CPU and memory, combined with a new PSU and a new hard disk, in essence is a new PC in an old case.
Why not add a DVD-burner to replace the CD-ROM?
Then all is new!
It might be cheaper to buy everything new, including the case, if you can get a nice deal.
And it certainly is less work.
