3883	0	302330	2818709	NR	King Fisher	7/24/08 5:32 PM	1.21692072E12	Computer Freezing, mouse won't work	I have an older Compaq computer 5320 CA from about 2002, I'm using Windows XP. I used it for a couple of years then not for approximately 2 years. I have been using it for the last year without any problems. On Saturday, it is now Thursday, after about 5 hours my computer started to freeze to the point where it was no longer sending data and my mouse wouldn't work, it lasted a minute then was find for a while, then started to freeze more regularly once I turned it off I got a few more hours before it would start freezing again. Each day the amount of time I would get before it froze has been getting shorter and shorter to the point today where it started almost immediately. Now it is freezing about every minute or two for a minute or so. At some point in the last week my cd burner quit working (ie does not recognize when a cd is put into it). Once it starts its freezing issues the cd burner has a red light on. The last few times I have tried to turn my computer off, it will not fully shut off competely. It does into shutdown mode but will not actually turn off. I thought originally it was a virus but I did a virus scan and it found nothing so then I did a factory reset and cleaned my computer. I thought maybe it was the fan not working, but I have a fan on it and that is not working, it has actually gotten worse. Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly welcomed
