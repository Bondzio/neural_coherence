The computer is less than 3 months old.
Computer freezes now at less once a day when on the internet searching.
Will not restart by CTRL/Alt/Delete.

There is No Scan for Errors under ACCESSORIES/SYSTEM's TOOLS.
Did Window's Vista not add that feature to the program?
How can you check for errors on the computer with Vista?
