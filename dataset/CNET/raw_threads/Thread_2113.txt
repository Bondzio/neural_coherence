4451	0	127522	1441364	NR	Robert Owen	9/26/05 9:33 AM	1.12772718E12	Video card not recognized	Ok I'm trying to recover from a hard drive change, I cloned my drive, then the windows xp had to be repaired, I cant get my video card working. I'm using a Jetway Kp8 motherboard, with a AMD 64 bit processor. Their is an AGP on the board, and I think this is where the problem lies, I cant load the drivers from the magic install disc that came with the board, it says it is corrupted. I cant findd the 4 in 1 drivers or any agp driver for the board. I used the driver windows ask for viaagp1.sys that I found (with great difficulty)I have loaded several agp drivers, I still Have no video card showing in my systems files, and the ATI radeon driver program refuses to load. Any one with any ideas on this issue? I'm about at my ropes end. Thanks
