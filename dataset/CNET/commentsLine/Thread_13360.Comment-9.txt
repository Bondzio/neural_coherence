pop in another psu.
there are psu testers but for years when i head 3 beeps it was a dead board or incompatible ram or bad sockets or the chip that interfaces with the ram (still means a dead motherboard.)
i've seen techs lose months on boards like that.
i learned to get them out of the shop fast to save us from wasting hours trying to recover the dead boards.
