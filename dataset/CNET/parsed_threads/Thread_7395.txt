<s> My old PC's MB has three RAM slots, and two of the slots have two 128MB RAM already plugged. </s>
<s> Recently, I buy a 256MB RAM so that the PC will now have 512MB memory. </s>
<s> The kind shop assistant recommend me to plug the new 256MB RAM into the 1st RAM slot so that the system can access the resources more quickly. </s>
<s> But problem's that I don't know which of them is the 1st RAM slot! </s>
<s> Please help if you could! </s>
<s> :confused: </s>
<s> numbered either slot/bank or whatever as 0[zero]. </s>
<s> The first digit of all number systems is zero, however we humans tend to start with one, and some mobo mfr's mark the first slot as one. </s>
<s> As to whether it will make a meaningful difference, I would doubt it. </s>
<s> Might depend on the size of the CPU's onboard cache. </s>
<s> MB manual. </s>
<s> Should also be available on the mfgs WEB too. </s>
