when i started thinking about a new computer a year or so ago i thought of the diy route.
i looked over a few tutorials and parts over at newegg.
i think i could build one just fine, my problem would be being my own tech support.
the idea of syncing ram, configuring a raid setup, and a couple other things freaked me out a little too.
i may drop into bb and see what they've got.
another route i thought of was costco, which sells dell with i believe a 90 day no questions return policy.
