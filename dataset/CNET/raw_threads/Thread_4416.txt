I have it outside attached to our rain gutter with some bread ties & a magnet. I have it so Macgyvered that I have a copper wire attached to the antenna part of the Network adapter. I found the copper wire & the rain gutters actually increase the signal strength. Ive also found that moving the network adapter even a quarter of an inch can make a difference in my signal strength too. Im wondering if theres anything else I can do to improve my signal strength even more? Or if anyone has some good ideas about homemade wifi antennas? Please & Thank You!

While it's possible that you might get some signal reflection from metal objects such as gutters, they can also interfere with a signal. Antenna length is based on math and depends on the wavelength of the signal you're trying to pick up. As such, adding more wire to make the antenna longer won't always increase the signal.
