Well, I have a desktop computer running XP pro with 1 ethernet jack which is connected to a DSL modem. I have a laptop which is running 98 with 1 ethernet jack. Is there a way I can simultaneously let both computers acess the internet? If you require any info please, just ask. Thanx Ibrahim Jadoon

My setup, all D-link: DCM-200 cable modem DI-614+ four port wired/wireless router DFE-530TX+ NICs in three desktops DWL-650 wireless NIC for a laptop Since you already have the modem and NICs in the PCs all you need is the router and cables. D-link has excellent support both on line and email (don't ask me how I know). Good luck, Telephony facts, analog/digital explained. See the CNet faces behind the posts. I think computer viruses should count as life. I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive.
