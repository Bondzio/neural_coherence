1.1.1	Hi people .	St
1.1.2	I ? ve got a question concerning the Lacie 2big Quadra ( external raid drive with changable hd slots ) .	St
1.1.3	The drive is Mac os extended formatted , I ? m on OSX .	St
1.1.4	Now , my 2big quadra has been collecting dust the past couple of years since I ? ve completed the project stored on it .	St
1.1.5	It has been kept as a backup only .	St
1.1.6	The Lacie is configured in Fast Raid mode .	St
1.1.7	However , now I also have a couple of unused 750GB wd SATA internal disk lying around ...	St
1.1.8	So my question is this : Can I remove the two disks on the Lacie with my old project from the trays , replace them with the unused WD disks , work on the drive , and then be able to switch back to the old drives without loosing data / Raid setup ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thus keeping the old disks as backup , if you get what I mean .	St
1.1.10	I ? m wondering , since both the old and the new setup will be configured in raid fast mode , and I can ? t seem to find any mention of such a scenario in the manual or elsewhere .	St
1.1.11	Ok !	St
1.1.12	Thank you so much for any replies Yours Fredrik	St
1.2.1	This is a bad idea .	Polite
1.2.2	USB drive cases are much cheaper than : 1 .	St
1.2.3	The risk .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	The cost if something did n't work out .	St
1.2.6	3 .	St
1.2.7	Recovery costs .	St
1.2.8	In fact , did you reveal there is no backup copy ?	Ques
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	Ok , I 'm with you .	St
1.3.2	Still , I find it a bit strange that raid enclosure is n't up to something like this .	St
1.3.3	Well , thanks for the advice !	Polite
1.3.4	I guess drives will have to find new places to go .	St
