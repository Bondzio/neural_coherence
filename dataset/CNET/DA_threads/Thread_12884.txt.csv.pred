1.1.1	Hello just saw and placed an order for a 512mb little flash drive on Buy.Com It 's listed as a USB 2.0 drive but I now have my suspicions the claimed transfer rate is only about 8mb/m read and I believe 6mb/m write .	St
1.1.2	Is this in line with the transfer rates for a USB 2.0 .	St
1.1.3	Here 's a copy of the specs from the Buy.Com sight and the URL .	St
1.1.4	Do these fit the specifications for USB 2.0 ? ?	Ques
1.1.5	in terns of transfer rate or are they trying to put one over on us .	St

1.2.1	Hi guys found a couple of sights that might help in figuring this whole thing out apparently their are three different standards for USB 2.0 High speed , full speed and low speed .	St
1.2.2	I 'm assuming the low speed is for the backward compatibility issue with 1.0 and 1.1 here 's the two links I found although I 'm still unclear if this flash drive is actually compliant with the specifications for 2.0 hoping someone can help .	St
1.2.3	Thanks .	Polite
