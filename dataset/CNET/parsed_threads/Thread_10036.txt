<s> I am looking for some benchmarks on database performance comparing Sybase ASE on a Sun/Sparc systems and MS-SQL on a WinTel box. </s>
<s> The key is someone matching the boxes to roughly the same level, so it is as like for like as possible. </s>
<s> I know this is not really in the domain of this forum but I was here so I figured I would ask. </s>
<s> On a pricing level I was looking at a 32 Core Sun M5000 and a HP Blade Server with 32 Cores, both with 72G of RAM. </s>
<s> However I really need database performance benchmarks. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> http://www.tpc.org/default.asp </s>
<s> I was there and they have some dated TPC-C for Sybase vs MS SQL but not TPC-E which is the one I really need to compare as it is modeled on OLTP &quot;brokerage&quot; type transactions. </s>
<s> That is a great site in general for benchmarking. </s>
<s> I may be stuck with vendor published results or bite the bullet and use the TPC tools to create our own, something I am really trying to avoid. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
