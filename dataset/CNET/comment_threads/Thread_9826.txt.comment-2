Probably with the 54g and definitly with the Pre-N (see page 54 of the manual) I'm surprised that you are having problems with this the Pre-N is supposed to have the airgo chipset which should prevent the router from dropping to the losest common denominator of card, but I doesn't seem to hurt you Pre-n equiped computer's speed.
Make sure you are using the latest firmware in the router and drivers for the cards.
Have you tried calling Belking Tech support?
