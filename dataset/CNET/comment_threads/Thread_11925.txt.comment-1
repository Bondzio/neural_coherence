At the CES show in Vegas (2013), a company (Milllenniata) is claiming to have single layer DVD disks (4.7 GB) that use available burners to make an actual engraved mark to the disk storage layer resulting in storage that will last 'thousands of years&quot;.
Disks can be played on regular DVD players and devices.
These are expensive compared to regular disks but if the storage capacity and longevity of them is accurate (and not just media hype), it seems a good solution.
Here's a link to the CNet article: http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20091808-1/millenniata-m-disk-the-possibility-of-permanent-data-archival/ .
The Millenenniata web site ( http://www.mdisc.com/ ) has a list of current burners that work with this media and you can also order media from them directly.
I have no connection with this company at all.
I am certainly wondering if the marketing is accurate and if anyone has any experience with these given how new they are.
