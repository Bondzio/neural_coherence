Hey everyone, my router just died (RIP WRT54G) my house is quite diverse, and I need a router that can handle it all, I have: 1) A Wii (wireless) 2) bluray player (wired) 3) internet enabled HDTV (wired) 4) a PC running Windows 7 (wired) 5) two MacBooks (wireless) and finally, 6) two iPhones (wireless, obviously) oh yeah and 7) an XBOX 360 (wired) sounds crazy now that I write it all out :P So, I need a router that can take wired connections and wireless all at once without freaking out, any ideas? Thanks!
