google for this product(adapter) called ada-2020.
found at  and others.
used for usb 2.0 to sata/ide connections.
this adapter will allow you to access the old laptop drive and many others should the need arise.
pricing is decent and is far more flexible than a simple usb case, though that will work.
good luck tada -----willy
