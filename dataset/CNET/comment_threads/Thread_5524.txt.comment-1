I have a Creative Zen Vision M. Every time I plug it into a USB port and the Zen is Identified as docked the PC shuts off completely.
Some PC specs are: Asus K8V-MX motherboard, 1GB RAM, AMD Athlon XP 2500 CPU, 80 GB HD.
I've tried using the Zen on a new Notebook I bought and it works fine on it.
Unfortunately all my music files are on my PC.
Any help or suggestions would be great.
Thanks.
