you're at that stage were any money sunk into an older system will the return benefit be decent.
-or- you can use those funds plus some more and get abroad a newer system.
since, you mentioned gaming, it maybe better to really upgrade rather than drag older stuff along.
the choice is yours.
the newer system pretty much requires more than new video card, etc.
and that's the extra cost, but you should be better suited for newer games and/or other demands placed on the system.
