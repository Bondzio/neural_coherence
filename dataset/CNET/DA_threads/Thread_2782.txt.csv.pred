1.1.1	Hi, I have just bought a 400GB Freecom external hard drive.	St
1.1.2	I plugged it in and it seems to work OK but all my mp3s now sound distorted.	St
1.1.3	I thought at first it was just the mp3s I put on the hard drive.	St
1.1.4	But infact its all sound played on my computer whether on the Freecom, on my internal hard drive, or from the internet.	St
1.1.5	Has anyone come across this before?	Ques
1.1.6	I think my computer might have USB 1 rather than USB 2 but Im not sure how to find out.	St
1.1.7	It shouldnt affect the sound either way though should it?	St
1.1.8	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	It's basically just a mass storage device, so the connection of an external hard drive shouldn't affect the quality of your sound.	St
1.2.2	In any case, here are some things to check: * Did this problem start immediately after you connected the external hard drive or was it down the road a ways?	St
1.2.3	* Just to make sure, try unplugging the external hard drive and see if the problem remains.	St
1.2.4	* Check that the speaker connection(s) is (are) firm...if a plug isn't in all the way it can cause distortion.	St
1.2.5	* Try using a different set of speakers with the computer to rule them out.	St
1.2.6	Alternatively, try connecting the speakers to a CD player, stereo, etc and see if the problem still exists.	Sug
1.2.7	* Check Device Manager to see if there is an issue with the audio drivers.	St
1.2.8	* Try downloading the latest software/drivers for your sound card from the manufacturer's website.	St
1.2.9	Also, please include the following information about your setup: * Basic PC specs, including processor and RAM * Operating system installed * Sound card (make/model) * Speakers (make/model) If there are details about your computer, such as sound card, that you don't know, the free program Everest will help determine the specs.

1.3.1	Many are blissfully unaware about motherboard and other drivers for their machine until they see an issue like yours.	St
1.3.2	Microsoft does not fetch or find the latest drivers so you must think back to the old ways of making sure your motherboard and other drivers are current.	St
