My school also offers a RedHat... Is RedHat really important to have for a career or not?

For example, if you are going to be working for an organization with only Windows software, a RedHat endorsement is going to be worth very little. But since you are still in school, I will assume that you do not know where you will be working after you graduate, so it probably wouldn't hurt to have it. But from personal experience I have seen very few jobs that were looking for a RedHat certificate. It is always good to have options though, if Linux is something that interests you anyway. Most employers are going to be more concerned about your experience, but having some certificates might give you and edge to at least get an interview. You might be better off considering getting something like an A+ certificate or something more generalized that can applied to many career options.
