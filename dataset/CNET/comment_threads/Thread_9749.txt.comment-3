I am not complain about, as you say, &quot;new user of analog capture MIGHT and WILL complain about issues with video capture that just years ago folk accepted as normal.&quot; The problem I am having is so so bad, you can not see a picture.
As for my post, are you suggesting I have post this question in the wrong forum?
