i saied executible file because thats what it asked for yet its named executive.exe file.
no the product didnt come with a cd since windows xp needs no drivers.
i downloaded the software from logitech.
the product is a logitech joystick attack 3. the software told me to basically connect what game i was going to play to make the game file.
i went to the games folder until it stopped at the file where it was ok. this is the produtct here.
