finished a machine this pm., msi k7t266 pro-2 mb, 256 memory,ddr.
standard (pulls) cd-rom and floppy.
cpu is amd 1800, msi page said it is compatible.
kicked the power up, and monitor wont show signs of life beyound recieving power.
i changed out video cards, get the same.
i think it could be problem in rom memory, but what should i be checking first..?
