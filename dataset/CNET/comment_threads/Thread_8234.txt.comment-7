You have anything you want to be saved or &quot;retrieved&quot; at a latter date then have access to multiple copies of same data to be safe as possible.
Anything you deem critical should always be backed up to several media sources of any type you like.
However, SUPER CRITICAL data should be saved to discs, as many as it takes.
if you have that much data to save, then yet another ext.
HD can't be dismissed depending on your wallet.
It's far cheaper in this regard than trying to retrieve from a single failed media source using some data service or s/w, if at all and time involved.
