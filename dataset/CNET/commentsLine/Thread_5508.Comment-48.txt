hi there!
it?s been a long time!
i had not recently written.
i've been very busy with my job and the college.
hello virginia, you're in a stressful and frustrating.
the first thing i recommend you do before anything is calm down.
believe me, i've been there and will be easier and fun for you to resolve this in complete calm.
for starters, you'll need some software.
i recommend you update your drivers for windows xp usb on you pc and laptop.
you can use the &quot;pc chip&quot; with which downloads and installs the driver &quot;chipset&quot; updated for your pc and laptop, among other &quot;drivers&quot; that have outdated.
while doing this, i recommend purchasing a new computer store &quot;y&quot; cable that is compatible with your hdd.
i have a lg usb hdd for some reason stopped working and discovered that the &quot;y&quot; cable was damaged.
now i'm using the usb cable of my nokia n-95 cel!
(i am a student and did not have enough money to buy the cable &quot;y&quot; original.)
if these steps fail to resolve the problem, then you will need additional resources.
first, you need from someone you trust to provide your pc and have installed win xp.
here you need to install and run the programs needed to backup and recover your files.
there are hundreds!
i used the &quot;recuva&quot; or &quot;recovery toolbox for flash.&quot; once backed up your files, either on dvds, or otherwise, need the utility of windows xp &quot;checkdisk&quot;.
this is completely recognizable and repair errors in your hdd.
all usb hdd behave like native hdd, that is, and should also be defragmented and cleaned from time to time!
try &quot;auslogics diskdefrag.&quot; for the rest, i do not write, because you will need to be much more skilled.
i recommend more a technician of your trust or related to the hdd manufacturer.
it's all i can share with you: my experience and what little i know.
i'm no technical expert or &quot;geek&quot;.
i'm just a student.
long ago, i used my beloved xp windows server 2003 64 bit; i currently use 32-bit windows 7 ultimate.
soon i will be using my 64 bit windows 7 ultimate on my beloved toshiba satellite pro a-200 laptop with 2gb.
ram & 160gb.
hdd.
thank you all for the opportunity to share knowledge.
my best regards.
