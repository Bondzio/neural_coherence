Longhorn will require more than 512MB of RAM.
I have never had &quot;any&quot; version of Windows run smoothly with the minimum recommended RAM.
I think MS must base their calculations on the premise that Windows will be the &quot;only&quot; program installed on your computer.
-JDM (*BTW, the people I've talked to about Longhorn say that most of the good stuff will be under the hood.
That's nice to know, but it will be a tough sell for MS...people like what they can see.)
