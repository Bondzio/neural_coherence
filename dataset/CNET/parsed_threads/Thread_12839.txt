<s> Hi, Posted a thread in Windows 7 about OS on SSD C: drive but now have a hardware (I think) question. </s>
<s> When I press the space bar to come out of hibernation it comes back on (so the keyboard works then) but then the keyboard and mouse don't work at all and I'm dead. </s>
<s> Have to press the power button and restart. </s>
<s> It's a custom built, bought all the parts at Fry's and Fry's put it together for $60. </s>
<s> It works great except for this so far. </s>
<s> Here are the specs if you know what they mean. </s>
<s> I'm new w/ Win7 so could it be a setting? </s>
<s> Antec DF-85 Case Thermaltake TPS-775 Intel Core i7 950 3.06GHz 4.8GT/s LGA1366 8MB Cache Gigabyte GA-X58-USB3 DDR3 12GB 1600MHz TRI P 3x4GB Modules, Patriot Viper II Sector 7 64GB SSD S599 A-Data Galaxy GTX460 1GB WD10000 LSRTL 1TB Black SATA/300 Caviar Samsung 22x SATA DVDRW Windows 7 Home Premium D-Link DWA-130 N USB </s>
<s> Have you check the Power Options under Control Panel ? </s>
<s> Checked the device drivers for the keyboard and mouse in 'Device Manager' ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> It is enabled. </s>
<s> I read the MS white paper on it but it was over my head. </s>
<s> Power Options Sleep after 30min Hibernate Never Display off after 10min Keyboard & Mouse both allow to wake computer but NOT checked to allow pc to turn off device to save power. </s>
<s> Strange thing though. </s>
<s> I didn't power button it off and just left it to call Fry's and when I came back the screen was black (maybe screen saver mode came on or monitor?) </s>
<s> and I pressed a key and then everything works fine. </s>
<s> Could it be a power screen saving thing with the montior? </s>
<s> It's a LG 2286L. </s>
<s> Don't see it listed in my list but it's USB3. </s>
<s> Old standard Dell keyboard and HP mouse. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> But if you want to try something, try HIBERNATE and tell if that works or not. </s>
