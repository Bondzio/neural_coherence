Hi.
Today i just buy my Western Digital My Book Live 1TB Network Storage this is first time im using WD NAS I successfully installed Windows 7 x64 on my computer this week, but the computer sometimes loses contact with my WD 1TB Book live NAS(When trying to copy Big FILE).
When this happens, I restart the computer, and the drive usually reappears.
I just bought this hard drive two days ago.
Instead of simply failing to recognize it, I sometimes get &quot;not responding&quot; errors when trying to open files.
here the screen shot
