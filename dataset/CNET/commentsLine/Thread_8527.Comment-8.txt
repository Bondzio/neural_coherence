i have checked the fans, there working, i have left the door open it's on a hinge and swings open.
but that reminds me &quot;heat issue&quot; i have noticed an occassional slight umm lets call it &quot;hot&quot; odor as oppossed to a &quot;burning&quot; odor especially with frequent reboots as i was trying to trouble shooot the usb errors.
seems the possible cause of the problems now are, heating/cooling ie.
fans, heat sink, excessive dust, or motherboard, or simply a possible driver issue..... wow think i might just have to order a new desktop and then as money and time permitts take all the woking parts of my xps and use them to add to a barebones system if i can find one that uses the same memory etc.
