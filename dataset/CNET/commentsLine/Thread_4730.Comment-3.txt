bob, thanks for your help.
i had no problems removing the hard drive from the case and hooking it up to the ide channel internally.
when i booted my pc, i was able to see the drive, but wxp said that the drive needed to be formatted and i could not browse the drive.
any suggestions?
i read somewhere about trying the knoppix cd?
thanks again for your help!
