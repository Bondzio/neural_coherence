<s> lol yeaah but to what you guys think of it because I need to buy one before the tuesday and theres the bank holidays and weekend so I need to see which one is best for web browsing and watching videos online and streaming. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I gave a nod to which seems best. </s>
<s> To go further we would have to find more reviews, build up a &quot;report&quot; and spreadsheets and maybe more. </s>
<s> As this is all volunteer most members won't do much more than give you a nod or if they own it tell about it and if they were burned by it, they tell you that. </s>

<s> That looks like your average clone desktop. </s>
<s> Not that I don't like clones but too often you find the Windows install is half done and there is now web page about support like you have with acer, etc. </s>
<s> No way I'm going with this one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry but as you might have figured by now, this is not exactly my field. </s>
<s> What do you mean by &quot;Average clone desktop&quot;. </s>
<s> And why do you say that? </s>
<s> I thought that this one would be fantastic with the huge RAM and HDD, processor speed and the supossedly &quot;alright&quot; graphics card (According to some reviews I found) Thanks again. </s>
<s> It's not a company with reviews by the usual sites (such as Cnet) and is what you can find at mom and pop PC clone shops all over. </s>
<s> Yes, the parts are there but are you ready to figure out if they forget a driver or some other thing? </s>
<s> For example many clone shops omit/forget Intel's little Rapid Storage app and the owner suffers needlessly. </s>
<s> Such details are many but you see them all the time. </s>
<s> The final choice is yours but I wouldn't buy that. </s>
<s> If I was going to go down that road I'd copy what another member is doing at this link: http://forums.cnet.com/7723-6122_102-525050.html That's one nice selection. </s>
<s> They picked the top from the people's choices. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks mate, I think I WILL go with the Acer now Cheers for all the help. </s>
