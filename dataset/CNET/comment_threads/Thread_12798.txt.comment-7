I did a litle more research on the crack.
It is an improved attack over the standard dictionary attack.
It apparently takes very few packets to mount it.
Now the good news, if you're using a strong, random psk, you're still pretty safe.
If you're using a 64 dicit hex, you're still rock solid.
Even if this program was able to boost the brute force attack to do 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 keys a second, (which it can't) the program would still have to check 1.1579208923731619542357098500869e+77 keys to exhaust the key space.
This would take approximately 3.6692298919219520946957621938515e+51 years.
I think for the momenent we're pretty safe if we use good PSK practices.
