bios area??
most newer mobos only require setting one parameter.
are you sure that &quot;cpu external clock ratio&quot; is the correct terminology??
modern cpu's have their multiplier [clock ratio] top locked [you can lower it if overclocking] what settings are allowed?
my bet would be that you are setting the memory bus speed, so that the correct fsb gets set.
what speed memory are you using???
seems that robert thinks that newegg sold you a kit.
they are only a parts supplier.
