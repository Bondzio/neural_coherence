i can help you fix the color matching.
first, design in rgb.
i know you'd think cymk, but do rgb (i'm using illustrator & in design).
second, don't go by your screen - that is extremely tough unless you calibrate well.
instead, print out the pantone spot color chart from xerox on the solid ink printer (link at bottom) before you start designing, pick your colors from here and they will match.
i use my charts all the time.
you need to use pantone solid coated swatches (even on uncoated papers!).
lastly, you must choose in the print dialog box, under color mgmt, color handling, &quot;let postscript printer determine colors&quot;  (us)&plats=windows%20xp&xtype=download&utype= now i've given away all my secrets
