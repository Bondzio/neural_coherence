1.4.1	The reason I want SLI is so that later I can buy a 2nd 256mb video card ( when the upgrade would be pratical ) .	St
1.4.2	I thought getting 2x 1 gig rams sticks would be good because then , if I ever wanted to upgrade to 4 gigs , I could just buy 2 more , instead of having to replace any ram , and having to buy 4x 1 gig ram sticks .	St

1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	but software has yet to catch up with 64-bit processing .	St
1.7.2	Unless you are configuring for the future ( 2-3 yrs ) , you are n't going to see much of an increase in speed .	St
1.7.3	Microsoft has announced XP64 and if you have XP you can download the 64 free .	St
1.7.4	All your drivers have to be rewritten for 64 bit .	St
1.7.5	Until all this happens , everything will run as 32-bit .	St
1.7.6	BTW..I just traded my 64 for a P4C800-E ( ASUS ) w/3.4ghz .	St
1.7.7	800fsb , 3gb , x800pro ( ATI ) , SATA/RAID , and it screams .	St
1.7.8	and life goes on ... Jack	St
1.8.1	I just bought a Planar .	St
1.8.2	They have a 3 year 2 day replacement policy .	St
1.9.1	I bought a new machine in April and have since upgraded with 3 of the items you 've upgraded with .	St
1.9.2	1 .	St
1.9.3	Logitech MX510 931162-0403 Blue 8 Buttons 1x Wheel USB + PS/2 Optical Mouse - Retail 2 .	St
1.9.4	CREATIVE Sound Blaster Audigy 2 Value SB0400 8 ( 7.1 ) Channels PCI Interface Sound Card - OEM 3 .	St
1.9.5	Logitech X-530 70 Watts 5.1 Speaker - Retail I really like all the products , but here 's a few tips ; 1 .	St
1.9.6	On the Logitech mouse , set a RESTORE POINT before installing it .	St
1.9.7	It mucked with my keyboard driver and I ended up uninstalling it and then reinstalling the drivers ONLY .	St
1.9.8	( Logitech has gotten into the bad habit of including advertisements and self-promotions in their software ) .	St
1.9.9	ONLY INSTALL WHAT YOU NEED .	St
1.9.10	2 .	St
1.9.11	The Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 OEM - compare prices at ( A ) newegg ( B ) ChiefValue and ( C ) UpgradeSource .	St
1.9.12	They 're all 3 always running specials .	St
1.9.13	I ended up buying from UpgradeSource for $ 45 with free FedEx .	St
1.9.14	Creative also has some funky extra stuff .	St
1.9.15	Also , set a restore point prior to installation .	St
1.9.16	Also , remove ALL remnants of ANY previously installed sound card , including disabling onboard sound from the BIOS .	St
1.9.17	Once done , the Creative Sounds Sweet and their ''Creative MediaSource '' player sounds far superior to Windows Media Player 10 3 .	St
1.9.18	The Logitech X-530 70 Watts 5.1 Speakers sound GREAT out of the box !	St
1.9.19	The extra thick cable on the right front speaker is a little awkward as far as limiting where you can place the speaker .	St
1.9.20	The cord is SO thick that it topples the speaker .	St
1.9.21	I had to wrap mine around a desk support to hold it in place .	St
1.9.22	Also , the rear speaker conections are short - 8 feet I think .	St
1.9.23	Plan on getting some RCA extensions if you have a large room .	St
1.9.24	I picked up a 17 '' LCD from SVA ( Korean company ) and it works fine .	St
1.9.25	The refresh rate is only 75 Hz though .	St
1.9.26	Just shop around and by the way , the 420W power supply should be sufficient .	St
1.9.27	Good luck and keep us posted on how it all comes together !	St
1.10.1	I think the power supply is suspect .	St
1.10.2	I guess it would do for now , However with you wanting to go Sli in the future a better Psu would be high on my priority list , No sense in spending over a grand on a system and chance having a lower quality PSU take out some components .	St
1.10.3	Frankly Aspire is not noted for making quality Psu 's .	St
1.11.1	With today 's power chips , power graphics cards , power USB2.0 ports , SATA , etc..etc.. , power supplies no less than 500w should be used .	St
1.11.2	The Athlon64 alone will use over 100w .	St
1.11.3	You can buy now or double buy later .	St
1.11.4	Up to you .	St
1.11.5	and life goes on ... Jack	St
