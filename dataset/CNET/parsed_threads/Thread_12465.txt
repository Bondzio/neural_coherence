<s> I just recently upgraded everything but my GPU which is the Nvidia GeForce GT 520. </s>
<s> My screen now randomly flickers, and makes the sound as if a usb has been unplugged. </s>
<s> I'm running Windows 8, as I was on my last PC and it never did such thing. </s>
<s> I tried the latest drivers for the card, and even some previous versions and nothing has fixed this. </s>
<s> Gaming seems to make it happen just a bit more frequently, and sometimes it minimizes the game and flashes non-stop, resulting in a reboot. </s>
<s> Other system components are i5 3570k 8gb DDR3 RAM, 1TB HDD, Any advice would be great because I'm at a loss. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> And is this a fresh install of the OS? </s>
<s> And finally, why not give a short run down of the machine before and after? </s>
<s> If you changed the motherboard the classic gaffe is to leave an extra mounting post where there should be none. </s>

<s> Hey Bob. </s>
<s> I'm running a COMPLETELY new system from the tower, to everything inside of it (except the GPU). </s>
<s> Completely fresh OS install of Win8. </s>
<s> My old system was a Core 2 Duo e5300, 4GB of RAM 250GB HDD, Win8, and I forget the exact mobo but it was an LGA775 with Q35 chipset. </s>
<s> I've also noticed that when the screen flashes and I have the display options in front of me, it goes from displaying &quot;SyncMaster P2350(G)/P23500&quot; to &quot;Generic non PnP monitor&quot; then flashes back and changes the name to my display device. </s>
<s> It's weird. </s>
<s> Sorry if I left out any information, still kind of new to the forum scene. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> And yes, everything including power supply. </s>
<s> Sorry but I'm not seeing makers catch up with the changes. </s>
<s> We do know there are issues. </s>
<s> And just yesterday I read about a game that was glitching just like you described and no fix is out yet. </s>
<s> Be sure to chat with motherboard and video card makers if they have updates. </s>
<s> But that won't help that game issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
