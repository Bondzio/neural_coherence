unfortunatly a while back i purchased a maxtor 80 gig &quot;fluid drive&quot; hard drive.
the information on it read like a sound feature.
however from day one, i noticed a &quot;clicking, grinding&quot; noise occasionally coming from my p.c.
on start up.
at the time i had installed several new hardware pieces and thought it was a bad floppy drive.
i eventually replaced the floppy, only to find that the sound continued.
i replaced a second floppy drive, and eventually my maxtor hard drive locked up.
only then did i realize that the whole time the sound was comming from the new hard drive.
maxtor replaced the hard drive at no expense, but that didn't help me with the aproximatly 40 gigs of info already recorded on it.
my advice: if the hard drive is making noise......replace it.
p.s.
copy and wipe the info off the hard drive first, (while it's still working) before sending it in for replacement.
