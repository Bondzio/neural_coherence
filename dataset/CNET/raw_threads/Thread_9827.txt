The table below is what I am trying to comoplete. Excel does not paste well into this format. Is there a site that has pricing and RAM for a 1989 486dx 50 MHz machine? Thanks, astiller Year

I worked on a number of 486 units with the 30 Simms Ram (just threw out a whole slew of them two weeks ago, btw) and 8MB ran over $30 per stick and had to be purchased as EDO/pairs by 1994. I don't know the original price in 1989, but assume it was much higher at that time because the 78 Simms was priced about the same $30 by 1994. TONI

Accounting program [Peachtree] wouldn't run. Added 4 MB for $200. $50 per MB!!!!!!!! They were 72 [or was it 78 pin???] pin Fast Page Mode SIMMS. EDO came out about that time.
