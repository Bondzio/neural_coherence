Hello!
I have a WD external hard drive.
It works well all the time.
However, to my surprise, I could not open it yesterday.
It only displayed this message: &quot;The drive is not formatted.
Do you want to format it?&quot; I don't know what is going on here.
Is it failed or corrupted?
Is it still possible for me to access the contained pictures, videos and documents?
I know I should have backed up all of them.
But, this drive is my backup drive.
Help please!
