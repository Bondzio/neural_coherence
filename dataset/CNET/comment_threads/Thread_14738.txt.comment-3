you've replaced the hard drive, power supply, video card, memory.
you've isolated to the minimum parts and the problem still reoccurs.
here's a nifty mobo for $61 that will let you keep your legacy parts (agp, ddr, ide, p4) but still is upgradeable to the latest tech (pci-e, ddr2, ide, p4d/core2duo).

http://www.anandtech.com/mb/showdoc.aspx?i=2814 you will need a new cpu though.
a celeron 2.5ghz is $47 while a 3ghz is $61: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductList.jsp?ThirdCategoryCode=010409&SortBy=A a pentium-d 2.66ghz is $96: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductList.jsp?ThirdCategoryCode=010427&SortBy=A a core2duo e6300 is $190: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductList.jsp?ThirdCategoryCode=010431&SortBy=A might as well get 512mb of ram for $44: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=80061-5 so for a &quot;new&quot; system with 512mb and a celeron would be $152; a p4-d 805 is $201; and a core2duo is $295.
