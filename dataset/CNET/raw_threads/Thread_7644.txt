Signal strength starts off at 54.0 mbps and weakens to the point of disconnect and then immediately goes through the &quot;repair&quot; process repeatedly. This happens no matter the distance from the router, whether right next to it or in the next room. There are 3 other computers that connect to the same router (2 wirelessly and 1 wired) and DO NOT have this disconnect problem. Have used WinSockFix.exe (version 1.0) obtained from Geek Squad, but still experience problem. Wireless card has been reseated. Tried to use Windows XP Network diagnostics, but wlan repairs connection before I am able to complete the diagnostics. SYSTEM DETAILS: HP Compaq Presario with Win XP SP2. Wireless card Broadcom 802.11 b/g with driver version 4.170.25.12 (09/20/2007) and HP Wireless Assistant (version 3.0). Connects to Linksys Router WRT54GX4 (firmware 1.00.20) Would appreciate advice and/or suggestions on how to correct this problem. Thanks!!

Is it set per our forum sticky at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=264135&messageID=2584349 There are some that will not update the router firmware because it works with other machines. Sadly I have over a dozen personal instances of that and the owner paid the 120 bucks for the tech to come out and update the firmware they could have done themselves. Yes, go ahead and ask why it fixes it. Sorry, I don't know the answer or rather I do but it's too much for me to type in this small space. Bob
