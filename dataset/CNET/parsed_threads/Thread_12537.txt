<s> I have a internal dvd rom drive that i have had for a while. </s>
<s> Windows XP finds the drive and you can see it in &quot;my computer&quot;, but it will not read dvd disks. </s>
<s> I can put cd rom disks in all day long and it reads them fine. </s>
<s> but as soon as i but in a movie...nothing.. doesnt even recognize the disk. </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=92547&messageID=1044823 </s>
<s> And test it with GEEXBOX. </s>
<s> I will not tell you to find this with Google or how to create the CD. </s>

<s> Power DVD and another but i cant remember what it was called, neither recognize the disk. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I am experiencing similar problems with DVD playback except that in my case it will play video & audio for a few seconds, then it runs sort of in a slow motion in jerky movements, or stops altogether and then it restarts again. </s>
<s> Basically stop and go situation. </s>
<s> The problem just started a couple days ago, I had no problem before. </s>
<s> I have performed every possible test and diagnostic service that Dell provided on my computer, but to no avail. </s>
<s> I know it's not the playback software that I am using (PowerDVD loaded by Dell) as the same problem occurs when I am using the MS Media Player or Real Player. </s>
<s> The DVD ROM that Dell installed on my computer is Samsung SD-616T. </s>
<s> Unfortunately my warranty has expired so I cannot get any help from Dell. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> Please? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> The same question is... </s>
<s> Does GEEXBOX work? </s>
<s> And the other question is: Did you try the usual &quot;Set all IDE channels to PIO, OK it and then set them back to DMA?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> I am not sure what a GEEBOX is. </s>
<s> Also, would you please clarify the steps to set IDE to PIO and back to DMA as I am not sure how to do it. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> No need to repeat it. </s>
<s> If you don't have the same issue, then you should start your own discussion with all the missing details. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Try http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=XP+DMA+SETTINGS </s>
<s> Hello Bob: Thanks very much for the Google link. </s>
<s> Setting all IDE channels to PIO, and then back to DMA didn't work, however, deleting the files in the registry as suggested in the second link on the Google page did the trick, and thanks to you I am now back to normal and am very happy about it. </s>
<s> Appreciate your help! </s>

<s> I have had my pc for about 3 years, and just recently my DVD-Rom drive has stopped working. </s>
<s> If I insert a disc (CD or DVD)i can hear it spinning then stopping then spinning, as it would if the disc were dirty, but it happens with any disc, even brand new ones, and will not read any! </s>
<s> Help Please </s>
<s> You could try the GEEXBOX and see if the drive is still working. </s>
<s> I can only guess you didn't try the tests or solutions in this discussion. </s>
