i have the same netgear router.
i have verizon dsl and they use a modem/router combo.
the first tech person told me that i needed to change my ip address from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.2.1 0r 192.168.3.1 i accidently changed the ip to 192.168.1.2 and it locked up the netgear router.
i could not reset it to the factory defaults or nothing.
i had to send it back for a replacement.
try login in with this url  i use this url to login using internet explorer.
before i could login, the tech person from netgear, walked me through the process.
if the netgear router is new, register it.
if you cannot reset it to factory settings, they will give you a case number.
then contact the person you bought it from and exchange it for a new one.
then register the new one.
after registration, then call netgear support and have them help you configure it to a new ip number.
as someone else said, the subnet numbers must match.
hope this helps.
