I thought getting 2x 1 gig rams sticks would be good because then, if I ever wanted to upgrade to 4 gigs, I could just buy 2 more, instead of having to replace any ram, and having to buy 4x 1 gig ram sticks. Do you think that 420W will be enough to run all the stuff? Oh, I should buy some more fans and stuff, shouldnt I? Do you recommend getting the San Diego or the Veince chip?

1994	6	112913	1284350	1282275	jackintucson	7/7/05 11:19 AM	1.12073514E12	I have Athlon64...	but software has yet to catch up with 64-bit processing. Unless you are configuring for the future (2-3 yrs), you aren't going to see much of an increase in speed. Microsoft has announced XP64 and if you have XP you can download the 64 free. All your drivers have to be rewritten for 64 bit. Until all this happens, everything will run as 32-bit. BTW..I just traded my 64 for a P4C800-E (ASUS) w/3.4ghz. 800fsb, 3gb, x800pro (ATI), SATA/RAID, and it screams. and life goes on... Jack

1994	8	112913	1285276	1282275	ihop4no1	7/7/05 9:53 PM	1.12077318E12	Sounds good...	I bought a new machine in April and have since upgraded with 3 of the items you've upgraded with. 1. Logitech MX510 931162-0403 Blue 8 Buttons 1x Wheel USB + PS/2 Optical Mouse - Retail 2. CREATIVE Sound Blaster Audigy 2 Value SB0400 8 (7.1) Channels PCI Interface Sound Card - OEM 3. Logitech X-530 70 Watts 5.1 Speaker - Retail I really like all the products, but here's a few tips; 1. On the Logitech mouse, set a RESTORE POINT before installing it. It mucked with my keyboard driver and I ended up uninstalling it and then reinstalling the drivers ONLY. (Logitech has gotten into the bad habit of including advertisements and self-promotions in their software). ONLY INSTALL WHAT YOU NEED. 2. The Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 OEM - compare prices at (A) newegg (B) ChiefValue and (C) UpgradeSource. They're all 3 always running specials. I ended up buying from UpgradeSource for $45 with free FedEx. Creative also has some funky extra stuff. Also, set a restore point prior to installation. Also, remove ALL remnants of ANY previously installed sound card, including disabling onboard sound from the BIOS. Once done, the Creative Sounds Sweet and their ''Creative MediaSource'' player sounds far superior to Windows Media Player 10 3. The Logitech X-530 70 Watts 5.1 Speakers sound GREAT out of the box! The extra thick cable on the right front speaker is a little awkward as far as limiting where you can place the speaker. The cord is SO thick that it topples the speaker. I had to wrap mine around a desk support to hold it in place. Also, the rear speaker conections are short - 8 feet I think. Plan on getting some RCA extensions if you have a large room. I picked up a 17'' LCD from SVA (Korean company) and it works fine. The refresh rate is only 75 Hz though. Just shop around and by the way, the 420W power supply should be sufficient. Good luck and keep us posted on how it all comes together!

I guess it would do for now, However with you wanting to go Sli in the future a better Psu would be high on my priority list, No sense in spending over a grand on a system and chance having a lower quality PSU take out some components. Frankly Aspire is not noted for making quality Psu's.
1994	10	112913	1286533	1282275	jackintucson	7/8/05 11:35 AM	1.1208225E12	A Larger Power Supply is a MUST...	With today's power chips, power graphics cards, power USB2.0 ports, SATA, etc..etc.. , power supplies no less than 500w should be used. The Athlon64 alone will use over 100w. You can buy now or double buy later. Up to you. and life goes on... Jack
