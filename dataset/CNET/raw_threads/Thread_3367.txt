I've just installed a new mother board and processor into my PC and now I cannot transfer my video to my PC. My firewire PCI card is installed correctly and the camera is recognised by win XP home and I can control the camera (rewind the tape)but I get an error when trying to capture the video. The sony suplied software does not recognise the camera. Adobe Premier Pro and Win Movie maker recognises it. Please can anyone help

No one will help you fix this issue. It's either a total wipeout and proper install of the OS or you get lucky and move the card or you dive in and remove devices in the device manager and let windows redetect and you add drivers again. You would also remove the software and reinstall it. It's unlikely Sony will help you in OS issues. Bob

(Try this)	Use the Autofix and Autoplay repair tools at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6142-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=54970&messageID=655494&tag=cnr This may help if you've done the motherboard drivers and all that.
