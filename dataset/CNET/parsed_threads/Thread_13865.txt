<s> I have been trying for the past couple of days to network a couple of PC's. </s>
<s> a)win XP - b)Win NT. </s>
<s> I have b running through a Netgear hub where I have a Laser copier as well. </s>
<s> The thing is that the laser copier is identified in the network but the win NT machine is not. </s>
<s> I tried to ping one machine from the other and no luck. </s>
<s> They seem to not see each other on the network. </s>
<s> However when I enter the IP address of the NT machine in the XP one a message flags instantly on both machines, they can't shared the same IP. </s>
<s> I am not a wizard at all on networking, to my disgrace, but if they are not seeing each other on the network why is this message coming up in both machines simultaneously? </s>
<s> Now I realize that in the NT machine there are two protocols installed: TCP/IP & NetBUI while XP does not carry NetBUI anymore. </s>
<s> Could this be the bloody reason why XP is not picking up this machine on the network? </s>
<s> I have tried a million things that have come to my mind to no luck. </s>
<s> What suggestions come to your mind guys? </s>
<s> Please enlighten me... Gelson </s>
<s> With NBT being the preferred solution, you need to move off Netbeui. </s>
<s> Of course, if you want, there are articles about forcing Netbeui into XP. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Forget about Netbeui. </s>
<s> Focus on workgroup names set as the same and file sharing being enabled. </s>
<s> Also look for those link lights on the NICs flashing. </s>
<s> Check your IPs, see that they are not the same. </s>
