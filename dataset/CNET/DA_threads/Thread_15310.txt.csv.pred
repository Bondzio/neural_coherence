1.2.1	&quot; Simple question.	St
1.2.2	Will a P3 handle a 160 Gig harddrive?&quot; Yes.	St
1.2.3	P3's can do that, but the BIOS must have been updated.	St
1.2.4	But a BIOS is not a P3.	St
1.2.5	A &quot;P3&quot; is just the CPU of the machine and this CPU is not limited in this respect.	St
1.2.6	There is an end run around a BIOS with a limited support and that is to put the drive in an USB 2.0 enclosure and use a compatible OS.	St
1.2.7	Also, the OS is an issue... Bob	St
