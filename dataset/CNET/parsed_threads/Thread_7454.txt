<s> Hello, this is my first thread on the CNET forums. </s>
<s> anyway, i plan on buying a netbook pretty soon, which is the asus eee pc 1005 hab, which includes windows XP. </s>
<s> i plan on using it for itunes, backup storage, maybe some school work, but i think the main focus is for itunes. </s>
<s> can the netbook i mentioned be used without problems? </s>
<s> will itunes be limited because of the netbook hardware? </s>
<s> i know you cant watch HD or SD video, play iTunes extras and whatnot, but can i use itunes for iPod management, like restoring and downgrading and whatnot? </s>
<s> also, just a personal preference, but can you change the color of the XP taskbar from the blue color? </s>
<s> :P </s>
<s> It does that fine. </s>
<s> Yes you may have to be patient for some operations but it does work. </s>
<s> My nephew has an emachines 250-1162 netbook and an ipod nano which he uses all the time. </s>

<s> Thanks for the response. </s>
<s> Can I still change the wallpaper or the color of the XP taskbar though? </s>
<s> There are plentiful discussions about Windows 7 Basic and how to change the wallpaper in spite of how it arrives. </s>
<s> I bet the color of the taskbar is covered too. </s>
<s> As to Windows XP, no version I know of has such a limitation or needs any work around. </s>
