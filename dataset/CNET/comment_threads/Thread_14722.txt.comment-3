You can remove the CMOS battery for 15min.
and then replace and then power-ON and check results.
If that still fails, then you need to replace bios chip, hopefully its removable one(socketed) and contact a bios replacement source.
i suggest: http://www.badflash.com and take it from there.
A cost(cheaper than new mtrbd.)
is involved, but it varies.
Also, you can &quot;hot flash&quot; the bios but only if you have access to an exact same model mtrbd.
(but tricky).
And no, any other at hand bios won't work unless reburned to the specs of the system mtrbd.. tada -----Willy
