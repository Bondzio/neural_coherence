<s> I would like to change my IDE harddrive and replace the master hardrive with an Sata harddrive. </s>
<s> I am just worry if there will be any thing I need to pay attention to before getting a new sata harddrive. </s>
<s> My motherboard is an asus tusl2-c intel815ep chip set. </s>
<s> I would like to set the SATA as the master drive with an adaptor and then attach and ata drive just for data storage as slave. </s>
<s> will I be asked to intall an driver with intalling winxp since I no longer had a floppy disk. </s>
<s> Yes, if you are installing XP on to the SATA drive, you'll need to to install the SATA controller driver right at the beginning of setup (press F6), from a floppy disk. </s>
<s> I suppose you could put the driver on to a CD-R but I have only seen reference to SATA drivers being installed from a floppy. </s>
<s> Not sure if XP setup would see a cd-rom drive in it's initial setup phase, other than being able to boot from it of course, which is made possible by the BIOS. </s>
