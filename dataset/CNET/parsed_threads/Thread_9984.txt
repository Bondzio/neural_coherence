<s> im going to do a positive pressure system when i get my new case however the ratio of air in/air out is very dramatic. </s>

<s> what are normal ratios of air for a positive pressure system? </s>
<s> Usually the old in/out is such that I've never had a problem. </s>
<s> You seen to want to create a new way of cooling so my advice is to try your idea, measure the temps and then try the other options. </s>
<s> I know some may want to model this but I find modeling is expensive and time consuming compared to the old fashioned use the usual setup and measure it. </s>
