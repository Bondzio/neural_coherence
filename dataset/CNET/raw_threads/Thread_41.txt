Had to order the replacement and it has a 4-pin video connector and the computer has a 3-pin connection. Can I buy an adapter to convert the connector to a 3-pin or do I need to return the power source. The power source is smaller in size than usual (thanks HP) and finding a replacement has not been easy. Thanks for any info you may have. Butch

You didn't reveal if the 3 pin is used on the old setup. Sadly, I haven't found the service manual for that model, but did find the note and clue above. Bob

The 4 pin is the 12 volt power plug that many mobos use to power the CPU now. [older mobos used the 5 volts or 3.3 volt connector] It's a mobo issue not a CPU issue. A given CPU can be fed from the 4 pin 12 volt on a newer mobo and work without such a connector on a mobo not set up for that connector. Had you plugged that in to the viseo card you would have fried video card for dinner. Yellow wires are normally 12 volts [of course black wires are grounds / returns]. I might guess that the Greeen is for 3.3 volts, HOWEVER 3.3 volts is normally Orange. The only green wire in the standard is the PS-ON lead on pin 14 of the 20 pin connector or pin 16 of the 24 pin connector. Check with HP before plugging anything in.
