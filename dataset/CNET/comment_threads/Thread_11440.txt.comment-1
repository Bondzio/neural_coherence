My experience is not Wholely with The Manufacturer but also with the Retailer.
After purchasing a Packard Bell I Extreme 6091 from a Big....... retailer I was assured of all the usual things, but when my Computer arrived from the Big....... retailer there was no operators manual and also when I log onto the Packard Bell Website to upgrade any drivers the Website tells me that the Serial number it finds is not recognisable and will not upgrade my Drivers.
I contacted Packard Bell and the Big....... retailer and the one passed the Buck to the other and neither would help me out.
So I will just have to treat this as a Lesson Learned and NEVER WILL I BUY ANOTHER PACKARD BELL AND MORESO NEVER WILL I deal with the Big....... retailer I hope a lot of you people out there recognise which Big....... retailer I am talking about.

I would be grateful for an operators Manual and I would pay or could someone lend me their serial number so I can update my Drivers
