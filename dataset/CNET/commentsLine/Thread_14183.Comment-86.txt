my first pc was of mitac brand, an xt computer that was bought in 1985. it had basic interpreter language with which i programmed a lot.
i made an analog clock programme, universal calendar i.e.
eternal calendar programme, climatological regression model and a lot more.
at end i.e.
in 1992 i developed storm track prediction model (pc-based, dos).
this moderl got 13th saarc (south asian association for regional cooperation) young scientist's award in 1995. it is still my dream.
i used many advanced computers later on like pentium 4, pentium duel core, hp workstations etc.
but i cant forget that mitac computers that i used first.
