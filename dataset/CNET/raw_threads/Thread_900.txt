If I create 3 logical wireless interfaces of that interface and configure each one respectively to the modes above, would this work? do they use the same MAC address or each needs to be configured a different one? And what is the disadvantages of this approach? Thanks! Hanibra

This is similar to the radios that can run B,G,N but not at the same time. They attempt to switch back and forth but are only somewhat successful. Same with routers that claim to be dual band but only have a single radio that switches between 5g and 2.4g If you were to work for a chipset manufacture maybe you could integrate this type of switching function. Trying to do it with software external to the chipset would be quite the challenge. The last time I was digging at that level you had to actually reinitialize the radio to change it from AP mode to client mode. I have seen some newer devices that claim easy changing of these mode but I would suspect they don't mean changing back and forth trying to emulate both devices at the same time.

They had spent months trying to solve it and the owner came to me out of desperation since the trade show was looming and they had to have it working. The IT staffer was put to other work and we jerry-rigged a solution using multiple APs and routers. Their IT staffer exploded and quit the next day and the show went off without a hitch. Be sure you are not restricting your options here as they were. They were trying to do this with a single box. Bob
