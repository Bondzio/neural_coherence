1.1.1	I have a Western Digital 80gb drive that i was using as an external drive .	St
1.1.2	I took the drive off for a bit and I believe I even placed some of my friends files on there so that I can back up his drive .	St
1.1.3	WEELLL now that I have placed the drive back into the casing to make it a external hard drive again , nothing picks up , i made sure all the jumpers where in place correctly and nothing .	St
1.1.4	when placing the drive into my pc as a slave this is what i see WDC $ WD84VFB-04CEA6 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 17.47W17 and then my machine will not boot up .	St
1.1.5	I take the drive off and i am able to get into my computer .	St
1.1.6	I have alot of pics on that drive including of my late mother that just recently passed away and some of my exfiance , yeah i know shes my ex but I still like too see her pics and I have other personal pics on there .	St
1.1.7	Is there ANYTHING that can be done ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.8	Please let me know	Sug
1.2.1	WD drives are jumpered differently than most other Mfr 's drives .	St
1.3.1	Ive Actually tried every jumper , trial by error , and the jumper has been on a slave for months now never changed it .	St
1.3.2	This is killing me lol	St
1.4.1	That is how WD drives get set as Master with no other drive on the cable .	St
1.4.2	However I 'm not sure of whether the USB case actually uses the jumpering .	St
1.4.3	For Master only WD puts the jumper horizontally ONLY for the purposes of providing a jumper for future use .	St
1.5.1	be fine , so do n't do anything radical .	St
1.5.2	Possibly using it at both locations changed or corrupted something re the MBR or such .	St
1.5.3	Worse comes to worse get a Knoppix CD and put the drive into a computer as Master [ the only drive in the computer at the time and see if the Knppix CD gives access to the data .	St
1.5.4	Robert Proffitt , a Moderator here , and a few others are experts on use of the Knoppix CD .	St
1.5.5	I have two and have never even tried one .	St
1.6.1	Actually yeah , and with the external casing the drive has to be placed with a jumper dont know why , but its been on as a slave for about a year or a year and half now .	St
1.6.2	Ive never had a problem until now with the drive , maybe the ide board on the hd went .	St
