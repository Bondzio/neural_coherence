Thank you very much!
That PSU looks amazing!
I think i will get that considering it has such high ratings.
Also, I looked online for conflicts between the motherboard and the processor and I could only find issues with and older version of this motherboard by the looks of it.
Am I incorrect?
Can you find me something on this if possible?
Thanks, Chris
