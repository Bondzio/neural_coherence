I bought my computer two days ago.
It is HP Pavilion A1130, the shop I bought it told me that the CPU is hyperthreading but I do not know how to find it.
I cannot see HT sign on the Pentium 4 logo and I cannot see in the BIOS setup too.
It shows Intel (R) Pentium (R) 4 CPU 3.06GHz.
(Pentium4 519 (P) 3.06 GHz: 533 MHz front side bus Socket 775).
Please help me to find my CPU is hyperthreading or not.
