<s> Home built PC w/Asus P5GPL-X-SE MB, Intel P43.2 GHz Processor, 2 gig RAM, XP w/SP3, GeForce 8500 GT 1 gig(Driver 178.13) Video card, PCI Express. </s>
<s> Display set at 1680 X 1050 as suggested. </s>
<s> Recently added the video card along with a new pwr supply (750 watt) and a 20 inch Viewsonic monitor. </s>
<s> Since I have added new hardware scrolling pages takes a long time. </s>
<s> If I use my mouse wheel it does not react immediately and, in fact, takes a while to scroll. </s>
<s> Very frustrating. </s>
<s> Suggestions on what is causing this greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Assume you already went to control panel, under mouse to try to adjust scrolling options? </s>
<s> Have you tried going to your mouse settings and increasing the scroll speed? </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I have not tried adjusting the mouse but I do not think that is it since it does the same hesitation when I use the up and down arrows on the keyboard. </s>
<s> I will try though. </s>
<s> Thanks again to both of you for the suggestion. </s>
