<s> I have an old Iomega ext zip drive, ya know with that plug with the hundred pins. </s>
<s> DB25 I guess??? </s>
<s> Of course all of my current computers have USB ports. </s>
<s> Is there an adaptor I can buy to use the old zip drive with my new computers? </s>
<s> Or ANY WAY at all to get info from those 100 zip disks onto something else? </s>
<s> Is yours an internal or external? </s>
<s> Your mention of a DB25 connector sounds like the external type that plugged into the printer port and had a pass through to the printer. </s>
<s> If that's the case, it would still plug into a printer port if your MB has one. </s>
<s> The first internals, if I recall correctly, came with a SCSI card and cable. </s>
<s> Later ones were ATAPI. </s>
<s> Which do you have? </s>
<s> Sorry for the confusion...I use ext as a short for External. </s>
<s> Anyway... None of my current computers have a multi pin port. </s>
<s> Except for my monitor which is DB9. </s>
<s> All of my ports are for USB, including my printers. </s>
<s> I need an adaptor that will convert the multi pin on the ext Zip plug to a USB plug for my cpu. </s>
