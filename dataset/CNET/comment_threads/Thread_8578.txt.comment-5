VAPCMD is right, reply back with the model number of the PC and that may help us track down your problem.
Sometimes older PCs require a BIOS upgrade to recognize more memory than they were originally intended to use.
It's also possible the old memory module brand and new one won't work together (brand conflicts).
But before you get too far into that, post the model number and we can most likely help.
The model is either printed on the front of the PC or somewhere on the back, like Presario 2400, 8100, etc.
The DDR modules will only go in one way due to the slots near the gold leads, so don't force it.
