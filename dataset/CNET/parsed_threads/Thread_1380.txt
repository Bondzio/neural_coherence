<s> A couple of days ago I bought the HP Media Center bundle m7267c. </s>
<s> Right out of the box I started experiencing problems with it. </s>
<s> More specifically the system never did a successful restart, forcing me to do a hard-reset on the box each time. </s>
<s> The 'shut-downs' on the other hand were working fine. </s>
<s> I spent a couple of hours with HP Technical Support trying to solve the problem but nothing worked. </s>
<s> Eventually they had me do a 'destructive' system recovery and even that didn't fix it. </s>
<s> Out of frustration I put the entire system back in the box and brought it back to where I had originally bought it. </s>
<s> They gave me another one on the spot - no problem with this one so far, I am keeping my fingers crossed. </s>
<s> Let me just tell you that I was glad I didn't buy this thing on the Web or from eBay. </s>
<s> There is something to be said about being able to drive to a store and get a replacement the same day. </s>
<s> Other than that this is a very nice system and I love the f1905b display! </s>
<s> I agree with those last few sentences: The simplicity of buying local. </s>
<s> Its glad to hear a success story once and while. </s>
<s> But, alas, alot of buyers (me included) sometimes will cave in for the cheaper prices on eBay. </s>
<s> Just wondering: Is that an AMD version or Intel? </s>
