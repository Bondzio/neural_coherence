FYI - A Test I ran last year Transfer 28.0 megabyte file from my server to my wireless laptop located 14 feet away and indicating excellent signal strength.
Wireless B = 70 sec Wireless G = 47 sec (router set in mixed Mode) Wireless G = 36 sec (router set in G Mode only) Wireless N = 12 sec (Belkin Pre N hardware) Wired NIC = 4 sec (Wired 10/100 ethernet)
