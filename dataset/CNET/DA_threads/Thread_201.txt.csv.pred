1.1.1	I was trying a trial software for home networking and its a nice program, but it cannot settle for some reason me sharing files and folders.	St
1.1.2	So I decided to remove it and go along with windows xp network wizard.	St
1.1.3	BTW, I have a wirless usb adapter on laptop, which oddly, I am able to go on the internet with it via my router.	St
1.1.4	Getting back to XP networking, i ran the wizard on both computers, and only one has an ip address, the host when I do ipconfig.	St
1.1.5	The laptop comes back with: Desination host unreachable ( 4 X ).Packet 100% loss.	St
1.1.6	I disabled firewall.	St
1.1.7	just what else is there to do?	St
1.1.8	The message says check connections.	St
1.1.9	Someone told me to check Dchp i believe is the acronym..but the wizard does not give me that option...only my router does.	St
1.2.1	Given only the details in your post I can't comment why the unnamed software appears to be buggy.	St
1.2.2	Maybe you should do the setup without it?	Sug
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Maybe you should do the setup without it?&gt;&gt;&gt; Which setup are you talking about...XP wizard or the magic network software?	St
1.3.2	I've reinstalled the software so many times even their techs are confused...which is not saying much these days.	St
1.3.3	Obviously, you don't mean the XP wizard...how else can one setup a network..Jeesh!	St
1.4.1	For instance the Wizard can't handle making the connection if we add or enable a firewall.	St
1.4.2	So it's my view we best do without such wizards and set these things up the old fashioned way.	St
1.4.3	There is a Magic Network software out there but I've never found it reliable enough to sort out networks for those that wanted an easy button.	St
1.4.4	I'm still pretty stumped since I know so little about your network.	St
1.4.5	Sometimes it's out of date firmware in the router, firewall settings or other oddities.	St
1.4.6	How do I setup a network?	St
1.4.7	I follow the directions on the router and know when and where to setup the firewall to allow what I want.	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	First, I read somewhere that windows wizard for networking takes into account about firewalls...regardless, I had it disabled anyway on both computers.	St
1.5.2	Your right about Magic Network..it is fickled..so I removed it.	St
1.5.3	Now, my systems were working when i had a ethernet connection, and that was done with xp wizard.	St
1.5.4	Now that i got a usb adapter wi-fi for my laptop, i couldn't get to share files or folders although they were chosen in setup.	St
1.5.5	I am able to get to the internet though.The adapter is not at fault, because me and a tech of theirs established that, plus the fact I am able to get on the internet.	St
1.5.6	I was wondering if the software that came with the usb adapter may be at fault...if I remove it, then most likely I would not be able to get on the internet also.	St
1.5.7	So I am at a loss.	St
1.6.1	I had a 20+ back and forth discussion and it ended when we started to share details so I could point to the firewall in the router.	St
1.6.2	If you don't share the details I can't tell you about that setting in the router.	St
1.6.3	But you can look since you are there.	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
