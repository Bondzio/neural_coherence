<s> My dvd burner on my computer is a Pioneer DVR-106A. </s>
<s> The fastest for dvd-r's is 4x. </s>
<s> I'm running winxp and using nero to burn it. </s>
<s> I have used generic blank dvd-r's in the past which works very well, but i ran out so i got new ones which are Memorex DVD-R 16x. </s>
<s> Firmware for the burner HAS been updated. </s>
<s> When i burn an dvd iso image onto the blank dvd-r, Nero does it without errors. </s>
<s> But when i look at the disc that i just burned (through windows/mycomputer/drive), it says it is a CD instead of a DVD and it has 0 free space/0 used space. </s>
<s> my GUESS is my pioneer burner is too old to work with a 16x (even though i thought a firmware upgrade would have fixed it), but i dont want to throw $100 at a new burner if i dont have to. </s>
<s> can anyone tell me what is wrong? </s>
<s> Maybe you are not in the states with newegg.com or geeks? </s>
<s> That drive sounds years old. </s>
<s> I'd go back to the media and firmware that worked. </s>

<s> Since you've updated the firmware the next thing to check is your burning software. </s>
<s> Check your Nero and update it if necessary. </s>
<s> Make sure that it isn't bumping into the native XP burning capabilities. </s>
<s> When you check the drive in Device Manager is it showing up as a DVD? </s>
<s> Can you record other types of DVDs to it fine or are you just having a problem with this one ISO? </s>
