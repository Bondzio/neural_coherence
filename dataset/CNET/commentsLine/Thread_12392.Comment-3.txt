as bob has already pointed out, wireless is not faster.
even if it were faster, your internet wouldn't be any faster because that speed is limited to what your cable isp is pushing through your cable modem, and that is probably much much much slower than the worst wireless network speeds.
so, the only reason to change your wired setup is to incorporate new features.
with wireless, if you have a laptop computer, you can move it around the house at will - work at the kitchen table, in the living room, upstairs, downstairs, where ever.
if you want to stream mp3 music to your home stereo, you can do that wirelessly and not have to install a new network outlet behind the hi-fi rack.
and there will undoubtedly be as-yet unimagined new devices in the future.
the downside to wireless is you introduce a whole new set of security administration issues.
so imo don't do it unless you have a definite plan for something that can't be done with your existing wires.
