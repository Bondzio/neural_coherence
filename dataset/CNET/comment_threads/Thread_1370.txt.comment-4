How is the laptop partitioned ?
How large is the external HDD ?
Nothing wrong with partitiong the external HDD.
Just make it an 'extended partition' and then create the logical partitions/drives within the extended.
What are backing up and SW are you using to do it ...just data or the entire disk ?
VAPCMD
