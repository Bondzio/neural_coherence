Im considering re assembling my whole pc from the bottom up... Its driving me crazy that doing things as small as replacing some thermal paste on a gpu always end up as a nightmare for me... Never seemed to have power issues in the past, even with both cards running at the same time, and I get fans spinning and everything in the state its in now Is it even possible to have broken both GPUS by merely replacing the thermal compound?
Having neither of them working now makes me start wondering...
