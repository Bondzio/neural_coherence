I have a Brother laser printer which I have connected to my router wirelessly, and a desktop connected to the same router via ethernet. Yet, when I go in Windows to add a printer, it cannot find it. I have the drivers installed, and it works via USB. Any advice? Thanks.

It varies with the model but most require you to setup the wireless printer first (not on your PC!) then I install the printer driver and then it knows to look on the network. At no time do I need to add wifi to the desktop. Bob

As long as the printer is connected to your Router and your computer is connected to your router, either by wire or wireless, you are golden......As you have already discovered! P
