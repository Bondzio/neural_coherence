What are the best reliable options? Things to consider: - My first choice would be a 3.5'' 2TB portable USB powered compatible with any OS (some HD comes with software and I don't mind if mine does not) - but I couldn't find any (that would ship to Brazil)! - First thing is portability - no AC power, small size, things like that - but I'm willing to give that up for a good priced with 2TB. - Second and last, but not least, is again warranty and reliability - this is more a question if I should go local rather than international shipping. - I'm thinking about those two opposite options right now: http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/MEQM7500GB16/ http://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-FireWire-External-WDBAAJ0020HSL-NESN/dp/B002RL8J12/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1266077647&amp;sr=1-1

I won't discuss international shopping in depth. It's all about many things such as no warranty, trust (none), import fees, taxes and at the end the story is usually told that it was not worth the trouble. Bob

I kinda agree with it, but it's good to have more opinions in the same side to put things into perspective. In specific, from the research I've been doing, this is probably true for hard disks. I mean, I don't know any tech place claiming to fix RAM memory, for instance, or pen drives - they just are able to recover the data in the rare case you need to. Hard disks just almost seem like are made to break sooner or later. Thanks!
