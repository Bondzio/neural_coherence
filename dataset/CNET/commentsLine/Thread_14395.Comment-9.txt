there's a reason.
it's because some routers don't like that.
issues such as routers that run slowly or lockup are common.
i had hoped that you would reveal your settings.
then i could comment directly about them.
in one sentence try all defaults, broadcast ssid, wpa and latest firmware.
-&gt; about the printer server.
i picked up a 26 dollar printer server with 2 ports.
it's this one.
but i have yet to run 2 printers and will not vouch for it.
but i do own 2 of them as i am running a nas on one.
here's the link to it and if they are out of stock, look at other sites.
there must be similar units for similar prices.
