Thank You Frank, I am currently using a program called Avronis's True Image.
This is on a 3rd HD in my current computer.
Each Fri after a full virus scan, it automatically run's to take a snapshot of my ''C'' drive for a backup.
So the mirror feature would not be needed.
With that in mind, do you have suggestion's as to the way to set the Raid on the new computer?
