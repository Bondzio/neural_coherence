with no esd protection?
there are none.
if you're going to build a custom rig, and i assume you'll be dropping big bucks, a five dollar esd wrist strap is a minimal investment.
if you know how to protect your devices easier than that, how about sharing?
i've been dealing with and teaching electronics since the 70s.
esd will give you a bad day.
