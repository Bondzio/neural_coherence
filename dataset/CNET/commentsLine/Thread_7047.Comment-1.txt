i'm not sure what to do at this point.
i've installed my cpu but not the heatsink.
the heatsink has a gray pad which i think is the thermal paste.
the thing is i want to use artic silver for my thermal paste.
what should i do?
should i leave the thermal pad on the heatsink and apply artic silver on the cpu and on top of the thermal pad on the heatsink -or- should i remove the thermal pad on the heatsink and smudge some artic silver on it and the cpu?
i'm not sure if it's of any benefit but it's a pentium d 830 processor.
also, can anyone tell me if a thicker layer of artic silver will give me better heat dissipation on my cpu?
thanks
