I am currently on my second WD My Book World 500GB external network hard drive. I just want to be able to plug it into my router (Cisco) and access it from my laptop or any other pc, and really only use it for file storage with things like pics, audio, video, etc. Would like 500GB or 1TB, no need for less or more. I would like to be able to leave the drive on all the time, 24/7. Not really happy with WD performance. First one had 'recall' due to power issue. My second one ran for a well over a year with no problems, but now fails to be able to be accessed after it is left on for a long period of time (more than one hour). Turn on to use for less than an hour it works fine, but longer than that, the blue rings stay lit and the drive is spinning, but my laptop cannot access it. My laptop is a Dell Studio 17 with Vista 64bit. I don't need any bells/whistles, just a good realiable drive that will last a real long time that I can access from my router from any computer. Thanks

Any other places to look or any other advice? Now looking at a LaCie brand model Network Space 2. Any thoughts on that one?

Instead, look for reasonably priced units that perform the necessary functions you require (take time to learn what they are). Low cost NAS generally are slow, awkward to administer and fail (or gag until they cool down) mostly due to built-up heat inside the enclosure. Brands don't matter as much as the way they are designed. Better units are larger enclosures with exhaust fan (or fans, ie. noisy). Linux units are cheaper obviously due to free OS; WHS units cost more obviously due to Microsoft. You could be better off running a low power PC (such as Atom), attach a USB drive of your choice and &quot;share&quot; it over the network as your file server. Again, take time to learn how if you don't know.

Google for more brands. Interesting alternatives but quirky: Hitachi NAS dongle and Seagate Dockstar. Good luck.
