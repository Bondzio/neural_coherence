1.1.1	Hello , My iMac ( intel core duo , running 10.4.11 , about 2 years old ) has never had any problems connecting to my wifi box via airport - then suddenly it wo n't work any more ( nothing changed - just one day to another ) .	St
1.1.2	Airport status is connected to my wifi network , but there is no internet connection .	St
1.1.3	The connection via ethernet cable works fine , so it ca n't be an ISP or router problem ( in any case my Mac laptop has no trouble picking up the wifi ) , and when I search other neighbour networks via Airport , it gets me to their ISP login page , so I doubt its a hardware problem .	St
1.1.4	Called apple who said I 'd probably need to reset the wifi / airport system configuration and create a new location - but for her to talk me through it ( with no guarantee of a fix ) would cost me .	St
1.1.5	So I tried to do what I can ( deleting certain system files etc ) but I do n't really know what I 'm doing , and nothing has worked so far .	St
1.1.6	Can anyone help ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks so much in advance	St
1.2.1	When I read a post like this , I know I want to swap in another wifi router and not touch the Apple or PCs .	St
1.3.1	... as my laptop sat on the desk next to the iMac picks up the wifi from the same box no problem.. ?	Ques
1.3.2	Could that still be a router malfunction ?	Ques
1.3.3	Thanks !	St
1.4.1	The router is misconfigured as in MAC filters .	St
1.4.2	But that is NOT WHAT IS WRITTEN TO USE in this forum 's sticky .	St
1.4.3	The settings do matter but your post still has me trying another router if the settings are good .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
