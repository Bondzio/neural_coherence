<s> Hi the problem is I have windows XP professional and I have western digital 120 GB hard disk external the problem is that I can't restart or shutdown the pc what is the problem? </s>
<s> How about some info. </s>
<s> What hardware are you running, what computer motherboard, processors, how does the external drive connect? </s>
<s> When it doesn't come up what happens, where does it stop? </s>
<s> IF you plug the drive in while it is running does it work? </s>
<s> You left out the big clues. </s>
<s> What the drive was connected to. </s>
<s> Motherboard make/model, if the BIOS is current in such and whether you updated the motherboard driver package. </s>

<s> &quot;Motherboard Intel CPU P4 1700Ghz RAM 256+256 External Hard drive is connected throw USB port When I unplug the External HD it restarts normally&quot; While interesting, it didn't tell exactly where the USB port is, or the make/model of the motherboard and if the BIOS was up to date. </s>
<s> You may want to either become more familiar with what you have or just make this a warranty issue with the machine's supplier. </s>

<s> You also didn't answer the question about whether the drive shows up if you plug it in while the computer is up and running. </s>
<s> Also what version of Windows? </s>
