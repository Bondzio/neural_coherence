i've purchased a couple battery items from a place called &quot;ebatts&quot; including a dallas chip for an old intel 386 pc's motherboard.
my experience with them isn't extensive but they were very prompt.
i won't provide the link but google can do it.
they are still around and there retailer rating shows as a ten.
