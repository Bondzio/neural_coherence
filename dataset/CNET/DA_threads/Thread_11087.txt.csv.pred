1.1.1	I have bought a new 160 GB SATA Seagate HDD and I already use a 40 GB PATA samsung HDD .	St
1.1.2	After I add the new SATA to my PC will there be any compatibility issues between the two disks ?	Ques
1.1.3	Any booting delays etc ?	Ques
1.1.4	Can anyone shed some light on this ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.5	My motherboard supports both SATA and PATA HDD 's , Intel D101GGc is the model .	St
1.2.1	All I can offer is that I had to tinker with the BIOS and add a driver to the OS .	St
1.2.2	Sadly what I did does n't apply to all other PCs .	St
1.2.3	There is or was not compatibility issue but there definitely is a issue with how well they document this .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	and as far as compatibility goes , you problaly wo n't notice a thing especially both uses as an internal drives .	St
1.4.1	Thanks guys ...	Polite
1.4.2	Even I hope there is no issues as such ... .Am planning to use the new SATA as the master and the present PATA 40 GB as the slave .	St
1.4.3	Hope everything goes fine .	St
1.5.1	Read our XP forum you find many posts about people having difficulty installing XP to SATA drives .	St
1.5.2	Thankfully there are now thousands of articles HOW TO on google .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	You should have said that in your opening post , that way you would have got the right information to start with .	St
1.6.2	As Bob said adding a hdd and adding & changing it for boot drive , is not the same thing .	St
1.7.1	and your PATA should still be master if nothing has been change .	St
1.7.2	Your sata are actually a SCSI device .	St
1.7.3	Make sure to change the boot sequence if that will be your OS drive .	St
1.8.1	Thanks for the input guys ... the help here has been wonderful ... .. : - )	St
