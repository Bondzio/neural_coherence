<s> Well, mine went out on my dimension 4600, now I dont know what to get. </s>
<s> There's a lot of adapters and whatever else online, but I dont want to fry my motherboard or anything. </s>
<s> I cant seem to get anywhere on Dell's website, so I dont know what to do... </s>
<s> You would have to order one from pc power and cooling the best psu manufactuer out there (one good thing about dell, they don't use crappy parts), however the psus are specially made for dell, so the wiring is differnet though they share the same pin-layout. </s>
<s> SO sticking any psu will fry your computer. </s>
<s> Google pc power and cooling and check for the psu that matches your model. </s>
<s> The Psus are expensive. </s>
<s> Dells always offer limited upgradeability and bad technical support. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> Well, the dell man says I also need a new motherboard and memory cards, so it looks like I'm screwed... </s>
<s> memory cards? </s>
<s> dat makes no sense...i think u mean memory modules for ram </s>
<s> Dell has a non-standard wired ATX power connector. </s>
<s> So you need a PSU that is made for a Dell or a ATX PSU and one of the adapters. </s>
<s> Find them online with google. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> If your looking for a psu, try this site. </s>
<s> www.tigerdirect.com Good Luck </s>

<s> Bummer!!! </s>
<s> That's why I build my own. </s>
<s> Got a Dell about 5 years ago, tried to put in different motherboard, no good. </s>
<s> Found a site that showed how to get around the power supply and connect the motherboard, too complicated, so built one instead. </s>
<s> Still have the Dell running Linux. </s>

<s> This guy documented everything you'll ever want to know about Dell's evil proprietary pinout power supplies: http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.asp?p=339053 &quot;An even bigger crime than simply using non-standard power connectors is that only the pinout is non-standard, the connectors look like and are keyed the same as is dictated by true ATX.&quot; &quot;I discovered this the hard way as well; by frying parts. </s>
<s> At first I thought the upgraded power supply I installed in one of my Dell systems was bad, especially considering the dramatic way it smoked when I turned the system on, I actually saw **fire through the vents**! </s>
<s> Good thing I decided to check the color codes on the connectors and verify the pinout on another Dell system by using a voltmeter before I installed and fried a second supply.&quot; I recommend replacing the power supply AND motherboard with industry-standard components. </s>
<s> Everything else should carry over. </s>
<s> Heck, get a nice AMD Athlon 64 CPU to replace your power-guzzling P4 while you're at it. </s>
<s> I like ASUS for motherboards and Seasonic for power supplies. </s>
<s> Be sure to tell Dell what you did. </s>
<s> I find this thread interesting considering that I have four Dell Optiplex computers bought at the same time that all had power supply failures within a couple of months. </s>
<s> At first they would fail to start reliably, and eventually not at all. </s>
<s> At first the Dell tech said I motherboard, but after replacing the MB and memory with no sucess, he traded out a PS and voila ... it worked! </s>
<s> With another computer beginning to act up the rep ordered two PS's and those were fixed. </s>
<s> When the other two started acting up, I called Dell but was told they couldn't replace parts with intermitent problems. </s>
<s> No problem ... </s>
<s> I called back and said &quot;they're dead&quot; and the PS's were shipped. </s>
<s> BTW, pretty easy to replace .... about a 5 minute job once you know the one screw to remove and how to get the processor air funnel out of the way. </s>
<s> Okay, Simple solution - go to http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com/products/power_supplies/selector/ Put your information in and VOILA! </s>
<s> You have a new power supply that is better than the original. </s>
<s> Probably cost you $150 (plus shipping) for the older models. </s>
<s> But you factor in a mobo and a PSU to replace them, you are gonna fork over more dough anyway. </s>
<s> Believe it or not, just last week my power supply took a nose dive. </s>
<s> I have a Systemax Pent 4, 2.4gig. </s>
<s> Well I went to all sorts of sites & couldn't find a replacement. </s>
<s> It seems like it is either out of manufacturing or the manufactures make them so you can't get replacements. </s>
<s> Well, anyway, I couldn't locate a 300watt one that would fit my system, so I went to a computer repair store close to me. </s>
<s> I purchased a 350watt, instead of a 300watt. </s>
<s> Installed it & it works great, so far. </s>
<s> It cost me a bundle, but hey, its the only joy I get here. </s>
<s> 1st time I've ever replaced a power supply & I'm proud of myself. </s>
<s> When you find a store, take your old supply with you & make sure the new one is same size, hole alignment matches, etc. </s>
<s> Also make sure all the cables match your cables on the old supply. </s>
<s> I even got a supply that has more power cables then my old one. </s>
<s> It leaves me room for expansion. </s>
<s> When I bought my Dell desktop 2 1/2 years ago, my husband insisted I get the extended warranty, which I did. </s>
<s> I had the same symptoms of an imminent power supply failure - harder to start, erratic start, and no start. </s>
<s> When the problem of starting began, I called Dell and they sent out a technician in less than 24 hours and of course, it worked perfectly, BUT the technician said he thought it was a power supply failure evolving and he was right. </s>
<s> When I called Dell and told them of the previous visit, there was no taking my word for it, and my husband and I went through the lengthy talk-through on removing the case, etc. </s>
<s> and finally, the person on the other end said, &quot;yes, it's a power supply failure&quot; and within 24 hours, it was fixed, in house. </s>
<s> Not being savvy with the inner workings, did it cost me more to have the power supply replaced this way, or for an ignoramus, was this the best bet? </s>
<s> In any event, I have to say that in my experience, Dell did a good job in handling the situation, or maybe I just got lucky with the technician in this area. </s>
<s> I have a Gateway notebook (bought based on my previous positive experience with them) and I usually go through 3 or 4 phone calls until I get someone who actually sounds like they know what they're talking about and then take their advice - however, in order to have something less than minor taken care of, it's the same answer: send it to us and we'll solve the problem after we've reformatted the hard drive. </s>
<s> Needless to say, I'm not going to be a Gateway customer again! </s>
<s> http://www.pcpowercooling.com/products/power_supplies/dell/ These guys seem to have a knowledge of the problem; haven't tried them but worth investigating. </s>
<s> I also had no idea my dim 8200 had a non-standard psu, so when I tried to replace my mobo I hit a brickwall. </s>
<s> Luckily the plugs didn't fit so I didn't fry a new mobo. </s>
<s> I was still mad, though. </s>
<s> Not only had I wasted the time I put aside for the change over, but now I had to order a new psu and wait for it to arrive. </s>
<s> Dell shoud be putting a big red sign on their cases and website: WARNING: Non-standard parts used here. </s>
<s> I will never buy from dell again. </s>
<s> Something went bad on our dell earlier this year. </s>
<s> Phone support could not diagnose it, so I ended up doing exactly that: getting new chip, motherboard and psu. </s>
<s> Fortunately, the warranty had not run out. </s>
<s> Point is, Dell could not figure out what was wrong and was willing to replace the whole shebang. </s>
<s> If the machine had not been under warranty though, I'd have been out a lot of money. </s>
<s> I wouldn't go to these people if their crap was all free. </s>
<s> After two months of getting the red tape runaround and time consuming try this and try that I agreed to a different brand computer and recieved a different one than they promised, I kept it because it was the first one of three that actually worked. </s>
<s> Unless you want to be treated like a moron and given the run around steer clear of Tiger Direct. </s>
<s> Search ebay for a replacement PSU. </s>
<s> It may be used, but you'll get it a lot cheaper than retail. </s>
<s> Dell support is terrible. </s>
<s> I don't bother calling them anymore with problems. </s>
<s> I just search their community forums and google for info. </s>
<s> The Dell Dimension 4600 will accept a standard ATX power supply. </s>
<s> My recommendation: Antec SL350 (the SP350 also works). </s>
<s> Nice quiet supplies - running one in my 4600 right now! </s>
<s> I also recommend the Dell forums over their tech support. </s>
<s> http://forums.us.dell.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=dim_other&message.id=210341&view=by_date_ascending&page=1 </s>
<s> It's nice to know that Dell has switched back to standard power supplies for at least some of their models. </s>
<s> Does Dell document which machines have normal power supplies and which ones have their old proprietary ones? </s>
<s> If so, where? </s>
<s> amd cpus are WELL known to be power hogs! </s>
<s> not intel! </s>
<s> I replaced the power supply in my Demension 8200 over a year ago, standard PSU, 425W and there are no problems, except for the minor case modification I had to make to get the screw holes to line up. </s>
<s> The PSU is a Diablotec, but works great. </s>
<s> Dell OptiPlex and Latitude support is US-based, and is several steps above the off-shored support. </s>
<s> I keep waiting for the off-shore support to improve, but it's pretty time consuming to work with. </s>
<s> Your best bet on newer units is to run the hardware diagnostics on the utility partition of the hard drive (if the machine starts!) </s>
<s> before calling, and give the techs the results at the begnning of the call. </s>
<s> Several years ago AMD CPUs were power hogs, as in back in the 180nm process days. </s>
<s> Their current 90nm chips use MUCH less power than Intel P4's. </s>

<s> this may sound funny, have you heard of aarons rental? </s>
<s> i got a 4600 from them and down the road my ps went out and the fixed it. </s>
<s> call them and the might be able hook you up. </s>
<s> they sell a lot of dells </s>
<s> I run a computer business and work on Dell computers ALL the time. </s>
<s> With that being said, I can say it's not a huge issue to replace their power supply. </s>
<s> All you need to do is call the Dell spare parts dept. </s>
<s> and tell them the model. </s>
<s> It's $29.95 plus $10.00 shipping for a replacement and they ship them with 2nd day service for that price. </s>
<s> It's really a no-brainer! </s>
<s> The only issue you may run into is if Dell spare parts give you the run around that they are out of stock. </s>
<s> This has happened and it has taken 2 weeks to get a replacement processor cooling fan. </s>
<s> Overall they don't usually take to long. </s>
<s> Mike D. </s>
<s> As long as you have a valid warranty Dell should replace your power supply. </s>
<s> I work at a technical college with Dell computers and we have power supply problems all the time. </s>
<s> I don't even call the Dell technical support line I just email them and they either send out a replacment part or send a technician to replace the part. </s>
<s> Yep, I'm 7 for 24 on two year old machines, but I suspect the power that courses though my classroom's wiring is at fault - not the power supplies themselves. </s>
<s> Well maybe? </s>
<s> Given that many buildings are underwired for today's technology I wonder if this may be the case for some of you as well. </s>
<s> We also replaced 11 power supplies on our last batch of Gateway's.... 11 I beleive of 20 or so over the course of 3 years. </s>
<s> Electrician has been called - Dell replaced all seven power supplies - though it took several calls and yes, some poorer service. </s>
<s> Unfortunately most buyers are unaware of Dell's use of 'proprietary' parts. </s>
<s> I didn't know the PSU appears 'designed' to destroy your computer! </s>
<s> i.e. </s>
<s> Same connectors, different wires. </s>
<s> Jeeze, my sister and her daughter recently bought Dell's. </s>
<s> Same with memory modules, though not as bad, or dangerous. </s>
<s> Deceptive advertising in my opinion. </s>
<s> 'Let the buyer beware' certainly applies to Dell. </s>
<s> Just happened, I have 25 days left on my warranty. </s>
<s> My power supply went, called Dell last Thursday, the tech asked me to do some diagnosing routines. </s>
<s> In my case, the machine wouldn't boot so answering most of his questions was easy. </s>
<s> At the end of the call, he decided to send a new motherboard as well as the power supply. </s>
<s> A local tech showed up Monday afternoon, took about 30 minutes to install and test the new parts. </s>
<s> I haven't decided whether to extend the warranty but I think, depending on the price, it might be a no brainer. </s>
<s> Good Luck everyone Bob </s>
<s> Using any compatible PS will NOT fry your Dell. </s>
<s> My brother is currently using a PS from an HP computer in his 4600 as we speak. </s>
<s> I know because I put it in there. </s>
<s> On another occasion, I saw an ANTEC PS in another Dell unit. </s>
<s> No idea how these myths come about... </s>
<s> http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.asp?p=339053 That's how. </s>
<s> I nearly swapped in a standard power supply into one of those Dells but hesitated when something just didn't look right about the ATX power cable. </s>
<s> Dell used those idiotic nonstandard cables for several years. </s>
<s> I know of no definitive list of which Dells have what. </s>
<s> I have a dell 8200, manufacture date jan, 2002, How can I tell FOR SURE it will take a standard atx psu upgrade? </s>
<s> Also I just upgraded video card to a Gforce 6600gt with extra power connecter.Current psu is stock 250 watt. </s>
<s> Card manufacturer recommends 300 to 350 watts. </s>
<s> Do I really need to upgrade? </s>
<s> thanks saltcod </s>
<s> any warranty? </s>
<s> I am trying to install a SATA DVD RW drive. </s>
<s> I cannot find a SATA power cable coming from my supply, only molex. </s>
<s> I was told the drive was compatable with my Dell. </s>
<s> Does my supply have a SATA power cable for me to use, or do I have to do some jury rigging. </s>
<s> To avoid unanswered new posts, this thread is now closed. </s>
