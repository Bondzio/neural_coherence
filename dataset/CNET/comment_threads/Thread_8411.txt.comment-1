I need help setting up my new business please?
What kind of internal networking configuration and appropriate hardware/devices would I need for my business?
My business includes: 54 employees- 37 have desk jobs (meaning there are at least some andministrative responsibilities, though this number also includes the salespeople and customer service representatives) -17 work exclusively on the manufacturing floor.
I'll need a preliminary sketch of the physical layout of the network which I don't expect you to do.
But I do however need to know how my company will be connected to the outside networks, in particular the Internet.
