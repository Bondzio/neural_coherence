bob, i am interested in your reply post to another with missing ram.
you said there is a box in windows that can limit ram.
i need more info on this.
i put in 2 ea 1 gb sticks of ram on my dell 4600, 2.8mhz, single core, windows xp home, system.
when my system slowed down all of a sudden, i found it was registering only 1 gb of ram.
i reseated then swapped ram sticks with each other with no improvement.
so, i either have a configuration problem or my second ram slot on the mb is bad.
hopefully, you can provide the needed info on the configs.
thanks.
dave h.
