1.1.1	My friend bought me a wireless router as a Christmas present , and I set it up in my house so everyone in the household can get access to the internet anywhere in the house .	St
1.1.2	But since my son can access the internet anywhere in the house , I want to monitor what sites he had been to .	St
1.1.3	Please help me on that issue	Sug
1.2.1	Some routers have a SNMP reporting tool .	St
1.2.2	As it stands you get to find it .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have NetGear WGT624 .	St
1.3.2	Do they have SNMP reporting tool ?	Ques
1.4.1	& quot ; & gt ; How we will programmatically get the information of the Bandwidth of & gt ; an access point .	St
1.4.2	& gt ; Otherwards how we will keep track of the bandwidth strength of an & gt ; access point .	St
1.4.3	If the access point supports SNMP , then MRTG , RRDTool , or a wide variety of SNMP based utilities will draw nice looking graphs .	St
1.4.4	http : //www.mrtg.org http : //www.rrdtool.org However , if your access point does not support SNMP , then you can build a scripting tool that will extract the same information from a web page .	St
1.4.5	For example , this Java program will extract the numbers from a WGT624 .	St
1.4.6	As always , it would be nice to know what you are trying to accomplish and what you have to work with .	St

1.5.1	But what do you mean by access point ?	Ques
1.5.2	My router ?	Ques
1.5.3	( I do n't konw if my router supports SNMP or not ) I went to both website that you told me and download the software from that site , but I have absolutely no idea how to work them out ( since there is not a single EXE file within the archive ) .	St
1.5.4	All I wanted to do was to monitor what sites that my son had gone to .	St
1.5.5	Thank You !	St
1.6.1	As you can tell , no ready to use application is ready for your make/model .	St
1.6.2	Since this is true , then you have to use the noted software I linked to .	St
1.6.3	If you were looking for a & quot ; click here to use & quot ; application , I did n't find it .	St
1.6.4	However I have seen MTRG working and it would satisfy your question .	St
