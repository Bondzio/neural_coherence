I went to turn on my computer the other day and when it was booting nothing came on my screen....I immediately thought it was a graphics card issue.
When I looked at the power button on my tower, it was just flashing and my computer system was not doing anything.
I have an 1.1 gig Athlon...Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated.
Thanks
