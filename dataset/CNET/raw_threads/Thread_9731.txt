So far it has worked ok. With all the extensive changes in technology (almost every day) is there a time frame when I should look to upgrade my routher, or just wait for it to wear out? Thanks for any advice.

Only one modem and one router today (that I've found) are IPv6 and DOCSIS-3 ready. The modem is the Cisco DCP3000 (mine) and the D-link DIR-825.

So you will have to trust to your ISP to upgrade when they are IPv6 ready. If they do not offer an IPv6 capable router at the same time, that is when you should get a new one. Mark
