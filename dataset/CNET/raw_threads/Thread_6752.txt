I have been looking at getting a NAS for awhile. Is the benefits of NAS worth a little extra cash and the lack of firewire?

My advice is to &quot;forget about it&quot; if you are running Windows. 2. NAS speed is about 1/4 or less the speed of USB speed. While NAS is a great thing most have 100 megabit Ethernet which pales is comparison to USB 2.0's 480 megabit link. Hope this helps you decide. Bob

I'd go with 500GB today since http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822154106 shows what happens to many that don't shut down nicely. Bob

Would that work if i just attached a basic external drive to it? Like.... Apple Router http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=E8408794&nplm=MB053LL/A
