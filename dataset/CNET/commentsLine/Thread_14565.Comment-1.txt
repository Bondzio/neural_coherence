i'm looking to buy a video & capture card combo (e.g.
ati all-in-wonder or similar).
my friend has the old 128mb agp version and it works for them and from what i've seen it's gotten great reviews.
but i want 256mb & i need the pci-e format.
currently i have a very cheapo capture card and video card and wish to upgrade both at the same time.
i need to get a 256mb 2006 pci-e version of the card (i don't have an agp slot), but it seems to have gotten more bad reviews than good.
i don't know of any other options for the same combo technology either.
does anyone have any comments on this card (2006 pci-e version) or any other suggestions to getting another combo card for roughly the same price?
i am also worried about its integration w/ winxp mce 2005.
