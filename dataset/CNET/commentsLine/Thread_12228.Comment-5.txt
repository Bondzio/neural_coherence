the jumpers on the linux drive would be set to...slave?
and cabled on the intermediate connecter?
i actually don't have a floppy drive, but two cd rom drives.
i think i need to contact my motherboard mfgr and see if a boot manager is available for this.
i would prefer to stay totally clear of touching the mbr on the one drive, for sure.
thoughts?
thanks.
