<s> Hi, Im deciding whether or not I should buy this computer, please give me all your suggestions, they are ALL welcome, thank you. </s>
<s> Intel Core i5 750 Quad Core Gigabyte CrossFireX USB3.0 SATA3 Motherboard Western Digital Caviar Black 1TB SATA3 6GB/S 7200RPM 64MB Cache 3.5IN Dual Proc Hard Drive OEM Samsung Black DVD writer XFX Radeon HD 5770 850MHZ Video Card Antec Three Hundred Mini Tower Gaming Case Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Edition 64BIT DVD OEM OCZ ModXStream Pro 700W ATX 20/24 PIN SLI All this adds up with about $1,206 Canadian dollars </s>
<s> buy a machine with only one hard drive. </s>
<s> That 1TB drive might be fine for data but I'd put the OS and apps on something smaller. </s>
<s> I'm also not seeing RAM. </s>
<s> If you're going 64 bit, you'll go 4 gigs and up. </s>
<s> That i5 will be dual channel so 4 gigs means 2 modules minimum so figure about 100 + bucks US per set. </s>
<s> I built a similar setup in Sept 09 for about $900 US. </s>
<s> But I had 2 ea. </s>
<s> 500 GB sata drives along with the Caviar Green 1TB. </s>
<s> I used my old case though and a 650 Corsair PSU along with the Win 7 upgrade early release which was $49. </s>
<s> So your prices are not far out of line, you can shop around for a little better. </s>
<s> ZipZoom, New Egg and Tiger are all moderately priced, sometimes you can find a deal or rebate. </s>
<s> Too high, why MINI tower? </s>
<s> I'm trying to figure out if this is a config you have setup, a system configurator (from a website, eg: Newegg, TigerDirect, etc. </s>
<s> ), or a specific brand name (HP, Acer, Gateway, Dell). </s>
<s> If it's a system you're thinking of putting together yourself; I would definitely be looking at a larger case; the Antec 300 is just too small to allow the proper ventilation you'll need to cool the CPU and videocard, also your first build should be a joy not a nightmare because the case you bought is too small for your components. </s>
<s> As stated before, we think you forgot to include the RAM, this will add some cost to your project. </s>
<s> If this is a specific system from a manufacturer; then make sure you check their website forums for customer reviews, problems, concerns, etc. </s>
<s> If you're looking to buy a specific setup; then you need to decide what you're going to be using the computer for (eg: photo/ video editing, gaming, etc. </s>
<s> ), then decide which components will best suit your needs. </s>
<s> Judging by the price ($1206 CAD); I'm thinking you probably hail from Canada-not a bad thing, if you're in the western region, try researching components from NCIX, Newegg.ca, or Memory Express. </s>
<s> I buy all my computer components from Memory Express for 3 reasons; their competively priced, quality products, and the best extended warranties in the west http://www.memoryexpress.com/ . </s>
<s> I don't know if you have set your mind on Intel, but for $1206 you can put together a rather killer AMD system </s>
