Hi Brian I think you could go with a mid range vidieo card and be just fine with you power supply and system.
If you want a quick, cheap upgrade to accomplish your goals it would be a resonable option just to add a PCIE graphics card.
May I suggest a Geforce 8600 based card such as http://www.techforless.com/cgi-bin/tech4less/PVT84JYAJG?mv_pc=google_base&tts=20090507020701 .
It is not a power hog and it is not expensive and yet it delivers outstanding performance.
Just my $.02 zonzin
