I reformatted a hard drive, but most of the space is unallocated, and i need to recover this.
I looked into some demos of partition software, but they all seem to do nothing, just let you look, and then ask you to buy the software.
So is there a demo that will let me do this?
Could i also do this myself?
I'm running windows 98, what if i just adjust the virtual memory of the hard drive up to the max size of it, under the system properties performance advanced settings?
Would that cause any problems, like wipe the hard drive?
