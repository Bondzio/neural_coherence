1.1.1	I am happy with my six years young PC.	St
1.1.2	Afterall, who doesn't like a PC which play music nicely, and surfs internet okay, and doesn't need Vista?	St
1.1.3	So, why the forum?	St
1.1.4	My PC doesn't seem to have USB 2.0 and my handycam won't like it.	St
1.1.5	I know I could just buy a FireWire cable, or just a PCI to USB thingie.	St
1.1.6	But I just wanted to know if there was a way to get USB 2.0 on my current system itself?	St
1.1.7	I looked here http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d850gb/ and here and they say I could http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/CS-009024.htm But I don't see any option like that in BIOS.	St
1.1.8	I am contemplating upgrading the BIOS, but will that really help?	St
1.1.9	What do you think?	St
1.1.10	Or will I just end up wasting my holiday redoing my OS?	St
1.1.11	Your advice and help is appreciated.	Ques
1.2.1	If the links you provided offer no mention of USB2.0 then you have NONE under your *specific mtrbd.	St
1.2.2	model#*.	St
1.2.3	You already know the cure, get a new pci card that can provide it.	St
1.2.4	There is no way to add/or somehow fix your current USB chipset to v2.0.	St
1.2.5	The USB level is strictly a h/w item, s/w only acknowledges or provides access to it to include the bios area.	St
1.2.6	The link for &quot;enabling USB2.0&quot; was if the mtrbd.	St
1.2.7	does have it, then you need a supporting OS to actually use it, and some patches to further support it.	St
1.2.8	This doesn't actually fix a mtrbd.	St
1.2.9	that &quot;physically&quot; lacks USB2.0 but does have USB but only at a USB1.1 level.	St
1.2.10	Any bios update is serious business, so be sure before proceeding and be ready as instructed for a successful update.	St
1.2.11	From link: To Enable USB 2.0: Step 5 5.	St
1.2.12	Enable &quot;High-speed USB&quot;.	St
1.2.13	-If no USB2.0 is found, then that option isn't present, it will read &quot;enable USB&quot; or similar, thus low-speed at USB1.1 tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	https://www.lemcomputers.com/intel/brochure/mboard/d850g.pdf If just says USB.	St
1.3.2	If USB-2, it would say so.	St
1.3.3	Also uses RAMBUS memory.	St
1.3.4	Hmm.	St
1.3.5	Big bucks getting that stuff.	St
1.3.6	Anyway, USB-2 standards were finalized in 2001.	St
1.3.7	If your board is of that vintage or older, it's not going to work.	St
1.3.8	A BIOS upgrade doesn't add this feature either.	St
1.3.9	You'll need an add in card.	St
1.3.10	BTW, which OS?	St
1.3.11	Hopefully XP w/SP2.	St
1.4.1	Thanks Willy, kinda I knew what you said, but you know they say -- don't give up!	St
1.5.1	Thanks Steven.	St
1.5.2	Correct link.	St
1.5.3	I have the same board.	St
1.5.4	D/l technical manual from intel site as well.	St
1.5.5	No luck.	St
1.5.6	Currently using XP.	St
1.5.7	Have tried with 95/98/2000 Adv Server SP4 as well.	St
1.5.8	No luck.	St
1.5.9	So if the mb doesn't have it, OS won't add it.	St
1.5.10	Gotta get a PCI-USB card/FireWire cable.	St
1.5.11	Oh btw, are RDRAMs still in production :-?	St
1.6.1	http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Description=rambus&x=0&y=0	St
1.7.1	Funny, 2 GB of PC 800 RDRAM costs as mush as a Brand new desktop	St
