Thanks for your reply.
I'm from Montana, and am busy raising lean Angus beef and US #1 hard red springwheat to keep all you US citizens healthy with sharp minds, so I greatly appreciate your helping me.Found a D-Link DI-624 router and DWL-G520 adapter that I think will work, or the DWL-G620 (faster).
I read some feedback that said the adapter was a pain to install, so go with DWL-G122 USB adapter, but taking that advice with a grain of salt, can't be that tough can it?
I have a system with Windows 98SE and a new Dell with XP Pro that I want to network.
The adapter will go in XP system.
What is your take on this hardware?
