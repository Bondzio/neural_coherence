Have you tried using (add network place) listed at the top left of the Net Work Places?
Im running three Dells, using XP, and sometime need to use the process after adding a shaired file.
Go into My Network Place, then under Network Task (to the left) click on Add a network place.
Welcome will come up, just click NEXT.
Go down to (Choose another network location) and click.Then click NEXT.
You can now check that both of your PC are listed, and the files you are shairing are listed, when you click on the down arrow,or use the BROWSE Entire Network.
I hope the helps you.
I'm assuming you know that both PCs must be running.
