But when I uninstall it the computer returns to normal. This hard drive has data on it that belongs to my dad, so I want to return it to him, but don't want to cause serious damage to his PC. The drive was put into an enclosure a while back, but it got damaged. what I have tried I have changed the jumper settings to &quot;Cable Select&quot; which stopped the drive from interfering with my hard drive. But this caused the battery on the motherboard to fail. I tried changing the jumpers to &quot;Slave&quot; but the same issue continued. The hard drive is a PATA drive, and the details for the drive are as follows: Manufacturer: ExcelStor Model: T880 I found details on the manufacturers website which advised on how to change the settings to the above stated. As my dad wants the drive back and I can't currently afford a new enclosure I'm hoping someone can give me some advice on what to try. An important thing I forgot to mention is the drive had been installed in my old PC of which my dad now owns, the drive was set as master but it wasn't set to boot as it's just for storage not for the operating system.

Could there be a possibility that this issue is down to my PC rather than the drive, just like RAM working in one machine but not another? Thanks

You are using 80 wire 40 pin cable ...right ? Is your CMOS battery fresh or is it old ? VAPCMD

Not knowing what damage, you maybe seeing the result, causing other working PC to NOT be proper with it installed. You know its doing something negative here. I use AD-2020 adapter setup(or others) in order to test various drives w/o an enclose and if it doesn't work, then I know any further attempts usually aren't going to be fruitful. It appears your old HD is a goner or close to it provided everything is setup correctly. Checkout: What happens when that HD is installed alone, then use the Ubuntu bootable Linux disc to then access it? Get the Ubuntu s/w .ISO file to make a bootable disc to test with. This allows the CD drive to boot the current PC and then access the now &quot;solo trouble HD&quot; if at all possible. If it does't boot or finding the HD didn't mount, suggest serious issues. tada ------Willy

The HD is &quot;master&quot; on what IDE Ch.? Plus, how can this boot as under normal setup, master is the boot device expected on primary Ch.. If on secondary Ch. that too rises a ?, if it never was cleared of the OS, then the PC sees possibility 2 OSes installed, it maybe trying or already changed the &quot;boot menu&quot; and when installed elsewhere causing an issue. All this on top of what I already posted plus what others have will pin-point the cause of problem(s) or fault. -----Willy

PATA(ATA) drives, EIDE type. FYI- This was abit harder to narrow support for, and its not as popular for int. drives alone. In other words, this maybe a PITA to fix or resolve. You may want to cut losses short. ------Willy
