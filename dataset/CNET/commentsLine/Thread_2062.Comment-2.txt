your issue is simply that microsoft's xp sp2 does not install of sata without a lot of help from the person that installs this os.
i don't tell how to install xp since there are thousands of web sites about that so let's go quickly over the basics.
we boot the xp sp2 cd and have the sata drivers handy on diskette.
at some point we tap one of the f keys to tell xp's installer we will supply drivers that microsoft doesn't put on their cd.
after all that we have a working install but with out of date drivers and possibly no sound, internet or such.
we get to install a potload of drivers.
if this is an add on drive and not a boot drive, then you need to check your boot order in the bios.
