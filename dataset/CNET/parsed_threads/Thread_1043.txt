<s> I have the MERCURY p1845gvm-p Motherboard. </s>
<s> I earlier had 128mb ddr 440 or 490 RAM . </s>
<s> I purchased a new 256 DDR-2100 ram. </s>
<s> When i installed the new ram and restart , the display stays off and there is a beeping sound. </s>
<s> Do i have to make any changes in ths BIOS please help! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> the mobo doesn't seem to like the new ram. </s>
<s> try clearing your cmos and attempting to boot again. </s>
<s> i couldn't find a manual on your mobo, but typically there's a jumper on the mobo that must be closed (a pin block placed on it) for about 30 secs, then opened again (the pin block removed). </s>
<s> Make sure it is pushed in correctly, if that doesnt work, take out the &quot;watch battery&quot; on your mobo, and let it sit for 30 seconds. </s>
<s> Put it back in and see if it works, if not, put the old memory back in and see if that works, than try again. </s>
<s> You shouldnt have to change any bios settings </s>
<s> Heard of DDR 400 [PC3200}, never heard of DDR 490, [DDR 500 is PC4000, DDR466 is PC 3700] nor DDR 2100. </s>
<s> If that, perchance, is PC 2100, that is DDR 266, much slower than the other memory and certainly can't be expected to run at the DDR 400 clock rate. </s>
