Otherwise the Athlon 64 X2 is the best. With dual-core, there is no need to throw money on hyperthreading unless your on an EXTREME budget. RAM is straight foreward. Just get the fastest the board supports. Video card is iffy for me, as both companies make good video cards, but I have seen more reviews of people using nvidia quadro cards.
