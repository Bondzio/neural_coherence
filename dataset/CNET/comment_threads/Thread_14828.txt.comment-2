...connect them directly.
But it requires a special ethernet crossover cable.
This is the ethernet version of the good old serial / parallel null modem cable.
In effect the cross over connects one ethernet's out to the other's in, and vice versa.
A normal ethernet cable won't work.
If you connected them both to a modem (router) they can both connect to the internet, but not to each other.
Network hubs are what form small LAN's for connecting computers.
Plug modems, printers (but not fingers), into a hub for complete connectivity and multi-user fun and games.
