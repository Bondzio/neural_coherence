i have had it directly connected to the modem in the past with the same issues, but they (the isp) cannot see them on the outside.
however, with wireless turned off, it hasn't been tested this way.
i think this may be a muti-tiered issue.
i'm going to hook direct into the modem (both cable and dsl) and see what i can see... regarding an article about the sledgehammer being helpful to other than my sanity.
i haven't been able to locate yet and will spend my time resolving, and not destroying, the router.
