<s> Hi all, I have a Belkin WG111v2 USB Wireless adapter that gets great signal strength, but will randomly drop the connection for hours at a time. </s>
<s> All the other computers in the house don't have a problem with the internet. </s>
<s> I had a different network card that couldn't pick up a signal from my room, so I purchased this USB adapter that has a cord so you can move it in different areas. </s>
<s> It was working fine for about a month, with very little connection problems, but lately it's been dropping several times a day. </s>
<s> I know I have great signal strength, so beyond that what can I do to keep me connected? </s>
<s> Should I just purchase a different adapter? </s>
<s> I've seen adapters that you can plug into the wall by your router that are highly rated.. does anyone have experience with these kind of adapters? </s>
<s> If so, what brand are they? </s>
<s> All your help is greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> The setup is not per our forum sticky. </s>
<s> PLEASE read that and tell how you setup differs. </s>
<s> It's the top post in this forum. </s>
