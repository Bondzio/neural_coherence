combination price at Circuit City on the T6212 if interested.
Just now noticed.
Had thought it expired last Saturday like Best Buy.
Course' the combination special could reappear in weeks to come with Best Buy.
Anyway the T6212 normally sells for $580 without a monitor or printer.
Circuit City showing sale extension for T6212 with emachine 17&quot; Flat-screen CRT monitor and Canon PIXMA Photo Printer, in package for $550 that ends at 5PM ET (Eastern Time) today.
