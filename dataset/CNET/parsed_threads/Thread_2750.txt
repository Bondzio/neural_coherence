<s> About 2 weeks ago my cpu suddenly started freezing. </s>
<s> It would click 1 time and freeze. </s>
<s> I installed speed fan and looked in the bios and it was reading 75C. </s>
<s> So I took it almost completely apart and cleaned everything. </s>
<s> I cleaned the heatsink and reapplied thermal paste. </s>
<s> It still would click 1 time and freeze and was still hot at 71C. </s>
<s> A few days after that it started completely shuting down on top of the click and freeze. </s>
<s> The only way to get it to turn back on after it would shutdown is to flip the power supply switch to the other side and back. </s>
<s> Then i noticed the next day that it reads 71C to 75C in both SF and the Bios as soon as I turn it on. </s>
<s> The heat sink is set on correctly. </s>
<s> The processor is the only thing showing hot besides the ACPI thermal zone which allways shows the same temp. </s>
<s> I have had it for for 4 years and never had a problem. </s>
<s> Ohh yea, the fans are working fine. </s>
<s> Help! </s>

<s> AMD cpus don't take well to &quot;over temp&quot; operation. </s>
<s> It may have already failed and is not going to get better. </s>
<s> You've reached a tipping point until you can cool it better. </s>
<s> IMHO, it needs to be replaced, its probably succumbed to heat damage. </s>
<s> However, you MUST be sure the heat compound is applied correctly, not too much or too little. </s>
<s> Though, you only need a small amount to do the job. </s>
<s> Check this out: http://www.arcticsilver.com/instructions.htm (good info) If you throttle down the AMD 2500+ to say 2000+ cpu instead, it recognized that way, it may not overheat too quickly and really test it. </s>
<s> If it lasts longer before a freeze, its the cpu. </s>
<s> You can try a better HSF setup that better at cooling as well and see if it handles it better. </s>
<s> Also, the socket itself may have &quot;crystallized&quot; causing intermittent contact/operation so only a new mtrbd. </s>
<s> instead of cpu. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I was thinking the cpu was going bad i just wanted to hear it from someone else before i spent money on the wrong thing. </s>
<s> It would be the 1st step, however as always, its a logical procedure should it not be the problem. </s>
<s> The other candidates are weak psu and/or mtrbd., also possible bad ram. </s>
<s> Reseat the ram and/or use less if more than 1 stick present. </s>
<s> Also, are there any beep sequence or error message, maybe a beeping sequence then? </s>
<s> If not, then the cpu again. </s>
<s> Good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> No there is no error messages or beeping sequence. </s>
<s> with each core showing 23 or below at idle. </s>
<s> Cooler is stock. </s>
<s> Ambient is 70F. </s>
<s> What's the CPU voltage ? </s>
<s> Sure the HS is flat and making good contact ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
