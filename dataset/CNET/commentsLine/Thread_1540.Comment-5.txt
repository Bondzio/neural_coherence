hi bill, i downloaded the manual to see if it is the same as the one i got with the mobo.
page 41, do you mean the 41st page?
i'm sorry, but the page numbering is done by sections.
page 41 is marked as 4-3. page 4-1 is just an intro to the bios.
i'm sorry to appear thick, but 4-3 has the bit about initialising pci or agp first.
that is set to agp.
have i got hold of the wrong end of the stick?
as i said in the other reply, i've updated the mobo bios this morning, so i'll check the cards again tonight when i get home and let you know the result.
thanks for helping.
