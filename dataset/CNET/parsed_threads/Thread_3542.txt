<s> My laptop is T60p. </s>

<s> Sometime it's so noise and restart without a reason. </s>
<s> How can I check and find out the reason? </s>
<s> Tell more about how you cleaned and replaced fans as need be over it's life. </s>

<s> I've cleaned 3 months / time and replaced 2 years /time for the fan. </s>
<s> But now it is still very noise. </s>
<s> Problem maybe not from fan. </s>
<s> Hi. </s>
<s> friend The reason is not only by fan. </s>
<s> You need to check some other hardware as hard disk, power supplier, CD room. </s>
<s> This is the link that instruct you about some reason for noise of your laptop. </s>
<s> Beside that, you can check the reason of some beep sounds. </s>
<s> http://www.techyv.com/questions/bad-and-un-excepted-noise-my-computer Best regard. </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> Make sure you using your laptop on a smooth hard surface for maximum airflow as well. </s>
<s> At 5yrs. </s>
<s> of usage, there is also embedded dust, this is located and also adhears to components. </s>
<s> This is NOT the typical dust bunnies but rather the fine dust, that ONLY immediate contact with will clean. </s>
<s> This as to be directly blown and brushed off. </s>
<s> Plus, if this laptop uses an int. </s>
<s> cpu fan, it may have failed and the case fan is working hard to maintain coolness. </s>
<s> If using &quot;heat tube&quot; method, fine dust isolates against best operation and outside air blowing won't do. </s>
<s> In other words, you have to teardown and clean it all off. </s>
<s> Finally, if this laptop was constantly used with continuing heat stress/build-up, the cpu paste can age and reduce its properties for best performance, re-paste. </s>
<s> Last, over time as already explained above, some component may have started to flake out, if not a easily replaceable item, then rethink any fix. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> You put in a new fan. </s>
<s> Is the noise from the fan? </s>
<s> Also, at 5 years you replace the heatsink compound. </s>
<s> Sometimes you find old machines that the owner has never had serviced so you do the service. </s>
