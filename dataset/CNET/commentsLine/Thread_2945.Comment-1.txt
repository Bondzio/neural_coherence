i am running windows xp and i just wanted to know if there are any good registry cleaners.
my computer is running slow and i assume that that is what i need to do to make it pick up.
my internet is slow (i have shaw highspeed), programs start slowly, and my computer just doesn't respond as well anymore.
thanks
