1.1.1	I 'm going to be living on campus next semester and I 'll be lacking a Television .	St
1.1.2	I 'm curious if it is possible to connect a Wii to my MacBook Pro and use the MacBook as a screen to play my games on .	St
1.1.3	If anyone knows anything about this , please let me know if it 's possible , and how or what I need to buy in order to accomplish this .	Ques
1.2.1	is probably not going to work as there is nowhere to put the video signal from the Wii into the Laptop .	St
1.2.2	What & quot ; might & quot ; be possible is that you purchased a USB TV tuner for the laptop , plug the Wii to it and tune to whatever the Wii puts out .	St
1.2.3	If the Wii only puts out a finished video signal and not a TV signal , this will not work .	St
1.2.4	You may want to consider a cheap TV .	St
1.2.5	I 'm sure there are Wii owners out there that will offer other suggestions though .	St
1.2.6	P	St
1.3.1	I once succeeded in connecting an old ( original ) Xbox to a portable DVD player .	St
1.3.2	Sound and graphics were sub-par I think , but it worked .	St
1.3.3	Of course , a DVD Player vs. a MBP screen is a large difference .	St
1.3.4	If you had a converter cable to combine the audio channel cables ( red and yellow cables I believe , assuming the Wii uses those standard connection cables ) , you could physically connect the Wii to the Mac , but you would n't get anything from the Wii on the screen , supposing the Wii works as any other console ...	St
1.3.5	Anyway , I agree , with a TV , it would be better .	St
1.3.6	-BMF	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	Check out the Elgato offerings .	St
1.5.2	I have an EyeTV 250 and this has a console setting that is supposed to reduce latency in game play .	St
1.5.3	As someone said earlier , you hook your Wii up to this and tune it to the TV channel it 's using Caveat - I have not tried this and the reviews are mixed .	St
1.5.4	Check out Elgato 's site or the reviews on the Apple Store Oh - and if you are off to college and they have an aerial point ( or a good signal ) you can use the Eye to watch/record broadcast analog or digital TV !	St
1.6.1	A cheap TV is going to cost far less than any solution you could think of , especially if you pick up a used TV set .	St
