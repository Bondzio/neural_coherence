1.1.1	It seems bad caps are becoming a problem that is no longer one of a bad manufacturing issue .	St
1.1.2	At one time several yrs .	St
1.1.3	back , the formula for capacitors was stolen in an case of industrial espionage .	St
1.1.4	These so-called mis-formula made caps became over time an issue from various manufacturers of failing in all sorts of electronics .	St
1.1.5	When it came to PCs , which of course many caps are used , the result was a persistent rebooting or non-boot as it were though it may settle down .	St
1.1.6	Users may have continued this process until it fully failed to boot at all .	St
1.1.7	The fix was the replacement of the bad caps to include the whole bank of caps or as the repair was best suited for .	St
1.1.8	However , now the case is more about heat damage or stress .	St
1.1.9	The continuing output of heat build-up and/or lack of sufficient cooling causes the typical normally std .	St
1.1.10	used caps to fail over time .	St
1.1.11	These are usually seen as leaky or blown caps .	St
1.1.12	The repair still remains the same , replace .	St
1.1.13	However , since manufacturers are more aware of this and knowing the increased demands from users and PCs in general outputting more heat , the change to & quot ; military grade & quot ; caps is being used .	St
1.1.14	What this means is a more robust tolerance to the heat stress and overall better made cap .	St
1.1.15	So , if you 're shopping for a mtrbd .	St
1.1.16	look for such as to what is now made .	St
1.1.17	It may become the standard as the continuing heat stress remains .	St
1.1.18	For now only better made mtrbds .	St
1.1.19	may offer this .	St
1.1.20	Google for bad caps to see what they look like .	St
1.1.21	They becoming more common than ever before : http : //www.badcaps.net Shows examples for a quick link look see .	St
1.1.22	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.2.1	If you 've opened a few power supplies , you may have seen some with darkened areas on the mounting boards .	St
1.2.2	This is when the resins turn to carbon .	St
1.2.3	Carbon is a conductor of electrical current .	St
1.2.4	Thus , it can act as another component in the circuit and change how things regulate .	St
1.2.5	Eventually the change to carbon cascades and causes total failure but any visible heat damage of this type to the boards is a warning of things to come .	St
1.3.1	One reason I posted as I found newer mtrbds .	St
1.3.2	and/or other components showing cap damage .	St
1.3.3	Though , in some it was n't apparent , a real close look resulted in a tipped or distended leaning .	St
1.3.4	Yes , I have taken apart PSUs and checked them for similar damage .	St
1.3.5	Some are so bad , BUT they still worked at least intermittently .	St
1.3.6	Of course , others are & quot ; smoke generators & quot ; .	St
1.3.7	-- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.4.2	I have suspected the power supply and have ordered a replacement with higher wattage .	St
1.4.3	Hopefully that will fix the problem .	St
1.4.4	I will also get out a light and magnifyer and look for bad caps .	St
