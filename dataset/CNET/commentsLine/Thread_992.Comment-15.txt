this is probably too late as i see your post date was quite some time ago, but i see no one mentioned this fix that has worked for me several times.
hold the windwos key, press r. this brings up the run command window.
type in msconfig and hit enter.
this brings up the system configuration utility.
click the startup tab and check the box disable all.
click the services tab, make sure that you check the hide all microsoft services, and then click disable all for the remaining ones.
reboot your computer, it is now running only the stuff microsoft intended windows the start up with.
try your browser now, if it was software interferance there is a good chance this will fix the problem.
especially if your computer is a brand name one like: toshiba, acer, dell, etc.. they always stack the computer with their garbage software right out of the box and sometimes it has issues with what the user is trying to do.
