1.1.1	I built my own PC a couple years ago , and I discovered recently that my on board USB slots are all USB 1.1 after I tried to transfer some pretty big files to a friends external HD and it took forever .	St
1.1.2	I want to upgrade to USB 2.0 and mount it in one of my 5.25 '' bays so they 're in the front .	St
1.1.3	I 've priced USB 2.0 cards , but before I buy one , I want to make sure that it 'll work right .	St
1.1.4	Does the motherboard need to support USB 2.0 for it to work at the higher speeds , or can I just buy a PCI card and be done with it ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	I 've used all models from newegg.com , geeks.com and they all work in Windows 2000/XP .	St
1.2.2	I ca n't tell if other OSes have support .	St
1.2.3	As to the front panel , USB 2.0 wiring must be used .	St
1.2.4	Cheers , Bob	St
1.3.1	if it is from a pci card , your motherboard will support it .	St
1.3.2	you can find them that go from the pci card to the front 5.25 & quot ; bay and yes , it should support it .	St
1.4.1	I 'm backing the last post up ... ..	St
