always in a &quot;serious&quot; battle, its how they ship products, there's been a biopoloy since amd broke off in the 1960's, but it hasn't been pronounced that long generally i wouldn't worry about directx 10, a number of developers are saying directx 10 is worthless or hyped up, because of the performance gulf between high end gaming pcs and average pc's (because of marketing and other things) which means the majority of pcs out there can't play the majority of games out there, then theres that ms has been talking about directx 10.1, and moving beyond dx10 already... nvidia and amd are slated to release new gpus in the next 6 to 9 months (they always are, thats another thing you pick up fairly quickly) in the form of g9x and r700, the advantage to this release is that it should give us generation 2 directx 10, which should provide a generation of boards worth paying for now, this doesn't mean you should avoid a directx 10 graphics card on this basis, if you're buying a graphics card in the $130 to $170 segment, nothing can beat the 8600gts, yeah, it supports directx 10, i've yet to see it benchmarked in directx 10 though
