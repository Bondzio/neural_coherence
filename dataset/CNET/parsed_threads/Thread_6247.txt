<s> 384 meg ddr ram ,40g hard drive, amd athalon 1.4 gig processor , running windows me , nvidia riva tnt2pro graphics , sb pci(wdm) sound , cd writer, dvd writer, and dvd rom drives. </s>
<s> custom build 2 years ago, still runs great. </s>
<s> use it mainly for gaming, web/ downloading, burning cds/movies, playing movies, and encoding. </s>
<s> so whats the best thing to upgrade first? </s>
<s> What are you trying to fix? </s>
<s> If it works great as you said are you trying to break it? </s>
<s> Your vid card is pretty far down on the scale but if the old one works ok for your use why upgrade. </s>
<s> Be aware that if you do deceide to start upgrading you might run into issues like power and others, the can of worms gets opened. </s>
<s> not much help bob, but the vid card sounds like a good way to start. </s>
<s> anybody know what would be a good card to pick up. </s>
<s> ive heard some come with svideo now, does this mean i can just run a line from my computer to tv and watch mpg/ avi formats on the big screen? </s>
<s> I would upgrade to XP from ME first and, then Video card. </s>
<s> Stay with nvidia in my opinion. </s>
<s> They make a great product and, are always working on new drivers for your cards. </s>
<s> There is an upgrade every couple months with my geforce and they keep adding new features. </s>
<s> You can never have too much memory also. </s>
<s> Another hard drive is always great for backup and storage. </s>
<s> Stay with AMD All the way Brother! </s>
<s> Thanks skipp, appreciate the help. </s>
