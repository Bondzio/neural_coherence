ok i need an expert opinion..
I'm building a new comp strictly for gaming and i cant decide on a CRT or an LCD.. ive read good things about some LCD's such as the Samsung 226BW but i just am not sure if this is what i want to get.
I've always played with my resolutions in the past at 1024x768 and I'm worried that an LCD with a big resolution is going to be way to different for me.
If someone could advise me on whether to purchase an LCD or a CRT it would be greatly appreciated.
By the way i will be running this monitor on an 8800GT, thanks.
