well, i do like hp but i know theer are some pretty sweet deals on the internet.
i've searched but i' m just reluctant to buy from seemingly unknown &quot;companies&quot; that's why i'm here.
i don't need my computer to be brand name...i just need it to have what i need.
basically my question is, and this may depend on different opinions, what is the best all-around i can get for $700?
thanks foir the suggestions though
