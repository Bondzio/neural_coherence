1.1.1	I have checked with the Epson website and managed to get the printer working but they do not have a scanner/photocopier driver for Windows 7.	St
1.1.2	Is there any way I can get these functions to work on this printer?	St
1.1.3	I am using an Acer 5635Z 64bit laptop.	St
1.2.1	epson.com wrote &quot;Download and install the Windows Vista version of Epson Scan from the Epson website.&quot; for the scanner in Windows 7.	St
1.2.2	Did you try that?	St
1.2.3	http://www.hamrick.com/vuescan/epson_stylus_cx3650.html claims their scanner software works but do drop them a line.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	No Epson's suggestion using the one for Vista won't install.	St
1.3.2	VueScan seems very impressive but the free test one has dollar signs over the result.	St
1.3.3	The usable one costs $39.	St
1.3.4	Question..is it worth spending this on an old printer or do I buy a new one?	St
1.4.1	Vuescan used to offer a demo mode so you could test it.	St
1.4.2	Ask them for that or just try it.	St
1.4.3	I can't tell if you feel if this scanner is worth it.	Sug
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks Bob, It is the demo where you finish up with dollar watermarks over the result.	St
1.5.2	No I know you can't make up my mind for me.	St
1.5.3	It was a kinda rhetorical question.	St
1.6.1	At least you can give it a test before you decide.	St
1.6.2	Can I share an observation here?	St
1.6.3	A few get upset over the lack of drivers as the years roll by.	St
1.6.4	While I can explain why this is so what I want to write is this -&gt; Many get so upset they write &quot;I'll never buy from them again.&quot; Here's my observation.	St
1.6.5	This issue is not limited to just a few makers.	St
1.6.6	I've seen this happen with every product over the years from each maker.	St
1.6.7	HOWEVER I have had good luck with Windows 7 XP MODE where I use an old outdated no driver will ever be found USB MICROSCOPE.	St
1.6.8	This device has been very nice to capture pictures of stuff I need to document.	St
1.6.9	It would be a shame to work that hard and for some there is that cost to upgrade to Windows 7 Pro or higher so Vuescan is likely the cheap exit unless there is a new all in one that is cheaper than vuescan.	St
1.6.10	Bob	St
1.7.1	But I am not eligible to download Windows XP Mode with Windows 7 home premium.	St
1.7.2	VueScan seems very good but I must weigh this against the cost of a brand new printer/scanner for about 50.	St
1.7.3	You are right about about the compatibility cost of Windows 7.	St
1.7.4	I lost Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw, VideoCam Look, Greeting Card Magic and Canon Zoom Browser does not link to Pictures.	St
1.7.5	All these were working well on XP so I seem to be paying the price of getting up to date.	St
1.8.1	The cost of that is to upgrade to 7 Pro.	St
1.8.2	Then you gain access to XP Mode and those old softwares can run in XP Mode.	St
1.8.3	Maybe that would be worth it?	St
1.8.4	It takes a little learning to master it but I find it to be a great solution.	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
