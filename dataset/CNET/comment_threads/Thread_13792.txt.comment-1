I recently took out my 2 GTX460's to replace the thermal paste and had my computer working fine afterwords until a crash when Playing Crysis which made my computer have a hard time booting back up...
I then proceeded to take the card out, take the heatsink off and make sure everything was fine, and then reseat it once again... it didnt work at all (no video at boot) so i decided to swap the cards (slot 1 to slot 2 and vice versa) to see if that would work and it did...However the computer couldnt detect the second card for SLI so once again I took them out and tried reseating them as well as only having one card in at a time and now neither of them work at all!!
No video signal on either on them, so I dont know what to do All I did was reseat the darn things, its not like I cracked them in the process or anything...
Please help, Ive been working on this for hours to no avail...Help would be appreciated
