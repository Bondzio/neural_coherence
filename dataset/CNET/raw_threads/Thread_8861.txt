Is there a way to do this without also purchasing an external CD/DVD drive? I appreciate any information about how to do this, if there is a way. Thank you, Cathy

Your choice here but reading the forums today's owners seem upset when the OS becomes corrupt and they didn't make the media. Back on point. I tried this -&gt; I copied the Office 2003 CD to some USB memory stick and installed from that. Bob

Also, where could I find out how to copy msoffice to a memory stick? This is probably very elementary knowledge but I am not a techie. Thanks again, Cathy

Have no doubt that, when talking about hardware/software failure, it's not a matter of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when&quot;. Even the USB drive is going to fail at some point. You can get external CD/DVD drives (almost all are burners too) for 50 bucks or under. The difference in cost to you will the drive minus the price of the flash drive. Many...if not most...netbooks come with a backup utility that can burn rescue media to such drives. Reconsider, if you can.

I have msoffice on my desktop and I will need to save reports made on the netbook to my desktop. Would I be able to save the reports made with open office on the msoffice files? Thanks for any information on this.

Yes, Open Office can open MS Office files through Office 2003, the version that I have installed on my desktop, but it cannot keep the formatting; therefore, it is NOT compatible. If the formatting is not important to you, then there's no reason not to try Open Office on your netbook. It's similar to MS Office, but not identical, so if you're familiar with MS Office and don't want to learn new routines, you will be disappointed. If you don't mind learning new routines, then it may be just what you need and want. Whatever works for you and whatever you like is good, better, and best for you. I you have MS Office 2007, forget Open Office altogether. I have that on my netbook running Windows 7 Ultimate RC1. Works perfectly. No problem whatsoever.

I am leaning towards getting an external drive. Does it matter what brand external dvd drive or are they all basically the same? Best Buy is offering the ASUS netbook at a good price,though the external dvd drive is $89. But they also recommend getting their initial 'tune-up'which enhances performance, removes things, etc., for $49 Is this tune-up a worthwhile thing to do/invest in for best functioning? Thanks again for any feedback.

I really don't, however, think &quot;I don't have a DVD drive&quot; is a good reason to switch to it. Switch if you support open computing, or think MS Office is a bloated poopy product, or cuz you wanna stick it to the man, or you're cheap. I find it not too difficult to switch between MS Office, Star office/open office, iWork. It's easier nowadays than it ever used to be. Choose &quot;Save As...&quot; and it's an easy double-click to open as you switch from system to system. But for most people, one office suite is enough. If it were me, I'd use the interwebs to download install files for MS Office (trymicrosoftoffice.com). It'll take a while, but it's not like you have to watch the progress bar the whole time. The tune-up from Best Buy is really quite good on regular laptops. They'll get it set up, do a lot of the initial chores for less than what I consider a reasonable cost for the time it saves me, and they do a better job than most users are capable to do. I feel the same way about my local garage who changes my oil for about the same price. On netbooks, Best Buy charges more for set-ups but does a lot less, so I'd not recommend it unless you can't manage it yourself. On a netbook with XP, you really just need antivirus and you're ready to go. Pricewise, if you shop around you'll save on an external dvd. Big box retailers can't make money on netbooks, but they have to pay for those helpful folks, local brick-n-mortar, free interest financing, etc. So accessories are more $$ there compared to mail-order.
