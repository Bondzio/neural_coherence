since you have a RJ45 ethernet port but wiring is not feasible there is only one option left you will need a wireless AP/router and a usb adapter.
option 2 call your provider ask them to help you.
and be firm in the fact that you DO NOT require their additional services and please help you if they dont, tell them to come get their stuff.
