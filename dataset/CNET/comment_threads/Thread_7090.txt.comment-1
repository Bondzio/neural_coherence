I have an old desktop computer(300Mhz PII Processor w/512K Cache, 128 MB SDRAM, 4MB 3-D AGP Graphics and there was a 5 GB 9ms Ultra ATA Hard Drive) and the hard drive crashed.
I also have a laptop but would like to use my old desktop in a home network.
What type and specifications for a internal hard drive would work with my computer?
