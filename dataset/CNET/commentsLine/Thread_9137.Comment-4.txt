the monitor would not come on and this black piece i'm talking about is the size of a grain of rice.
so i doubt this has a lot, if anything, to do with the fact that the monitor won't come on.
i guess i could try the video card at a local shop, if i can find someone to do it for free.
what else could it be, though?
