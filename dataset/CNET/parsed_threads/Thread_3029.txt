<s> In the e machines t640 i posted earlier with the bad onboard graphics i tested and tested and found it was a bad motherboard.I need to know if i get a new motherboard A Biostar GeForce 6100-M9 Socket 939 mATX MB w/LAN Snd Vid.Will i be able to transfer all of the old parts from the bad board to the new one? </s>
<s> OEM operating systems are locked to the motherboard and generally cannot be transferred. </s>
<s> You can call eMachines about that and see if they'd be willing to help you out, but chances are you'd need to start looking into purchasing a new copy of Windows. </s>
<s> Other than that it should be a relatively smooth transition. </s>
<s> John P.S. </s>
<s> For those wondering, that is an eMachines t6420, not a t640. </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/emachines-t6420/4507-3118_7-31732646.html?tag=sub Now you need to download the specs on the BIOSTAR and see if it supports your PC 3200 Ram at 400MHZ and if it supports your AMD 64 3400+ CPU. </s>
<s> Everything else should work. </s>
<s> They are however not necessarily interchangeable in the sense that you can install it and boot up your old operating system. </s>
<s> You may (probably) have to re-install, so make sure you have the necessary CD's along with any applications. </s>
<s> Otherwise look for an identical motherboard as the one you had. </s>
