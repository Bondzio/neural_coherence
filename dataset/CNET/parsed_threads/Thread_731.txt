<s> I want to play simcity 4 on my machine but it wont work. </s>
<s> After looking to Aspyr tech support (online) it says I need a few requirements (upgrades): Requirements: ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce Card - I have ATY Rage m3 32 mb of Vram - I have 8mb. </s>
<s> 500MHz - I have 400MHz - the least of my worries I don't mind slow game play. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if my old trusty powerbook can accept these upgrades and approx what would cost be? </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you for your time in advance. </s>
<s> Sincerely, LastG3Interceptor </s>
<s> No! </s>
<s> The PowerBook video card, it's built onto the the logicboard, is not replaceable. </s>
<s> You have an ATI RAGE Mobility 128 video controller with AGP 2X, 14.1-inch TFT The VRAM is not expandable. </s>
<s> The good news is that the processor can be replaced, for a fee. </s>
<s> I'm not sure that I would bother with the expense given that I would still not be able to play the game. </s>
<s> I would be able to not play it faster though:-) You may be able to play an earlier version of SimCity. </s>
<s> The cheapest upgrade route that I could find for you to be able to play SimCity 4, is $499.00. </s>
<s> That will exceed the system requirements for this game. </s>

<s> Dear MrMacfixit, Thank you for your quick & helpful response!!! </s>
<s> I think it probably makes sense at this point to wait until I have the funds to purchase a new ibook or powerbook or until my fiance gets her next imac. </s>
<s> Thanks again, LastG3Interceptor </s>
