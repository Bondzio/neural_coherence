integrated graphics is not that much as a seperate graphic card it is not even equall to a 64 mb graphic card .
if you'r buying laptop then graphic card should not be your concern as its working is not gaurnteed but if it is a desktop system then you must chose a computer with windows xp or a computer with no preinstalled windows as it is more expensive.
take one with dos and buy xp.then buy a seperate graphic card and install new drivers for the card from internet and then download the latest dx(directx 11) drivers and enjoy gaming ram=1.5-2.0 gb graphic card=nvidia 8800 or ati 3670 256mb (seperate, the integrated one is additional and not good for exellent gaming some games do run but they lag ,works till you dont have graphic card)processor=2-2.6 c2d
