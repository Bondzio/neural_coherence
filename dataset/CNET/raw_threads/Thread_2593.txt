(It is a maxtor hard drive 200gb in a external usb encloser) It was working ok until all the sudden, the computer can not read the drive anymore! I am having trouble getting access to all the files that are on the drive.. the computer keep telling me the hard drive need to be format... or that it can not read the drive (the drive is partition into 3 parts) what can I do to retrieve the data? can the drive be use still?
