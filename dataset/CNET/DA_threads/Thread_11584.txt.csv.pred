1.1.1	hi - i am running two hard drives under the intel matrix storage program , which allows me to have one RAID 1 and on RAID 0 on only two hard drives .	St
1.1.2	one of my drives just died , so now i have to replace it and repair the stupid thing .	St
1.1.3	i would like to take advantage of this problem to reconfigure my RAID .	St
1.1.4	i think i put too little space on my RAID 1 partition and would like to increase it .	St
1.1.5	is there a way to change my partition sizes without deleting everything on my computer ?	Ques
1.1.6	i configured the RAID on my motherboard bios , a Gigabyte GA-EP45-UD3P .	St
1.1.7	the intel matrix runs through windows 7 , i guess it just keeps a handle on things and fixes problems .	St
1.1.8	i 've found intel 's matrix storage site and documentation to be pretty bad and hard to deal with .	St
1.1.9	matt	St
1.2.1	i have another problem : i 'm not really sure what 's wrong with my hard drive .	St
1.2.2	its not really dead , maybe damaged , maybe nothing ?	Ques
1.2.3	again , I have a RAID 0,1 array , using the Intel Storage Matrix .	St
1.2.4	I have two hard drives put into two partitions , a Stripe RAID 0 and a Mirror RAID 1. i 'm running windows 7 , and my mobo is a Gigabyte EP45-UD3P .	St
1.2.5	upon booting , i 'm told that my RAID 1 array is & quot ; degraded & quot ; my RAID 0 array is & quot ; normal & quot ; one of my physical hard drives - & quot ; error occurred 0,1 & quot ; the other one is & quot ; member drive 0,1 & quot ; i can boot up my computer and it looks like windows is running fine , except that the intel matrix storage manager says there is an error with my hard drive ( as stated above ) .	St
1.2.6	however , i ca n't figure out what the error is , and i ca n't figure out how to perform a diagnostic on my hard drives .	St
1.2.7	i can only perform a diagnostic on my hard drive PARTITIONS , and those are both labelled & quot ; healthy. & quot ; i can not figure out how to get to a diagnostic out of my BIOS .	St
1.2.8	i 've tried unplugging the offending hard drive and that causes the RAID 0 to fail completely and all sorts of related problems , leading me to believe that the hard drive is simply damaged .	St
1.2.9	so - do i need a new hard drive ?	Ques
1.2.10	is there a way to diagnose and maybe fix whatever is wrong with my current drive ?	Ques
1.2.11	thanks in advance	Polite
1.3.1	If the controller sees inconsistency between the two volumes in a RAID 1 array , it can often just rebuild it to match the two again .	St
1.3.2	The ones I 've seen offer that option while booting up but I can not know what you 're seeing .	St
1.3.3	This does n't usually mean data loss but it would be good to back things up .	St
1.3.4	From what I 've been reading about newer drives is that , if they were not specifically designed for RAID use , they will cause problems .	St
1.3.5	As I understand , it 's due to some sort of deep cycling they do that 's built into the firmware and part of their error correction routine .	St
1.3.6	What happens is that one of the two drives may enter this function making it temporarily unavailable .	St
1.3.7	This can break the array ... .or so I 've read .	St
1.3.8	Make sure the drives you are using are RAID capable according to the manufacturer .	St
1.4.1	RAID or & quot ; Not & quot ; to RAID , that is the question .	St
1.4.2	Whether I should connect my hard drives , into one ( x1 ) storage system ! ! !	St
1.4.3	To loose control of independent Hard Drives ! ! !	St
1.4.4	Please Note : I am not an expert in using RAID .	St
1.4.5	My first set up was to connect two Hard Drives together , as one complete single ( x1 ) storage unit .	St
1.4.6	Warning + Dangers = Using Raid - Hard Drive Software / Storage : This is a history of my own experience .	St
1.4.7	My first PC , was an Intel , running DOS 3,2 .	St
1.4.8	Years back I decided to build my last most powerful , maximum PC .	St
1.4.9	At the time , I used all the best top quality made products .	St
1.4.10	At the time , money was no object .	St
1.4.11	Only months after the limited warranty , my deluxe power supply failed .	St
1.4.12	Thanks to a built in spike protector , my motherboard and hard drives were saved .	St
1.4.13	Only months after the limited warranty , my master hard drive , had a major mechanical error .	St
1.4.14	The tracking arm broke .	St
1.4.15	( Mechanical Break Down ) .	St
1.4.16	Since I had two ( x2 ) Hard Drives connected using Hard Drive Intel Raid , I lost all information , on both hard drives ( x2 ) .	St
1.4.17	It cost me $ 1,000.00 to retrieve my information .	St
1.4.18	I live in Kitchener Ontario , Canada .	St
1.4.19	I am surrounded by famous computer information .	St
1.4.20	Research In Motion ( RIM ) the Blackberry producer and the University of Waterloo , a major in computer science .	St
1.4.21	NOTE : The biggest asset around here for computer stores and computer repairs , is fixing faulty computer hardware .	St
1.4.22	All secondary hardware , power supplies , hard drives and etc .	St
1.4.23	are now all junk .	St
1.4.24	Not reliable .	St
1.4.25	My own research and development , has found that Hard Drives are failing at a high rate .	St
1.4.26	Hard Drives are longer a reliable source for secure / private storage .	St
1.4.27	I am no longer using RAID hard drive system utility .	St
1.4.28	This can / will become a costly adventure , down the road .	St
1.4.29	I am NO longer using my internal 2ND Hard Drive as back up .	St
1.4.30	A power spike from a burnt out power supply , could / will , fry your hard drives .	St
1.4.31	Do Not use any Raid Hard Drive Software .	St
1.4.32	Special software is required to retrieve any lost RAID information .	St
1.4.33	1 )	St
