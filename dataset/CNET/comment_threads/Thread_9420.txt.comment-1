Please help.
I just installed WIFI wireless camera in the house.
I validated that I can access and view video within home WIFI network.
However, I can't seem to access it remotely outside my home Wifi.
I follwowed the instruction - found my IP address xxx.xx.xx.xxx : 85 and set port forwarding to 85 to IP camera.
What am I missing here?
