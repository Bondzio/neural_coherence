giving an opinion either, I'm giving advice based on years of actual experience with the hardware being talked about, along with experience and advice from other colleagues (who have equally great experience with either the hardware in question, the software in question, or the industry in general), and over the years of dealing with Creative products, the following has been learned: Their drivers never work as advertised Only recently have they started to create hardware that doesn't pop or hum when idling (and even then, some of their new hardware still does) Only recently have they started to create hardware thats worth roughly half what it costs (compared to, oh lets say, AWE32) EAX is a worthless feature and a relic of a dying age of proprietary formats, and it belongs in the past along with A3D, GLiDE, and other similar APIs Summarily I can say that while Creative's products do work, they don't work as well as we'd like, and they don't provide the amazing leaps and bounds which their marketing lauds on them, they provide unrealisticly high expectations and rarely (if ever) deliever.
