i replaced two of the three 512-mb sticks of ram with two 1-gb sticks, increasing the total ram from 1.5 gb to 2.5 gb.
(as mentioned earlier, the sony specification for this pc is 1.5 gb maximum.)
when i started up the computer, the bios recognized all of the installed ram, as &quot;2560 mb.&quot; however, the computer then produced a much louder operating sound--a loud whirring--than before.
it sounded like the system was overclocked and straining.
that obviously was not good.
after i had the pc shut down for about a half hour, i restarted it, and got an excessive temperature warning in bios.
even after the 1/2-hour shutdown, the cpu temperature was at 76.5 degrees c and highlighted in red type--so the system had a lot of thermal inertia.
i decided not to endanger the pc further, so i removed the two 1-gb ram sticks, and re-installed the original two 512-mb ram sticks they had replaced, for a total of 1.5 gb of ram.
well, this was a learning experience!
