I have avery old iomega back up drive and have a brand new Lacie Stark on the way.
I just bought a new an iMAC (11,2 ?).
How can I copy the files from my old back up iomega to the new Lacie?
I figure since I have a new iMac I might as well have a new backup drive.
Is there an easy way to do it?
Any help is very much appreciated!
Once I get the files migrated over I am guessing most would suggest deleting files from the old drive before I dispose of it to eliminate any identify theft problems.
