1.1.1	I just wiped my Frankenstein Dell Inspiron 5160 clean and installed XP Pro SP3 .	St
1.1.2	I am having a problem with an ebay purchased external dvd-rw usb device ( Pioneer DVR K16A ) .	St
1.1.3	XP Pro SP3 will not recognize the hardware .	St
1.1.4	My desktop sees it just fine ( XP Home SP3 ) .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas out there ?	Ques
1.2.1	sethicles , Testing the device in your desktop with XP SP3 installed tends to rule out a hardware problem with the drive itself so one should look at the drivers and/or the USB port on the Dell 5160 .	St
1.2.2	Interesting , a search of Microsoft KB says to install the latest service pack to cover the old Upper & Lower Filters and USB detection issues but alas SP3 may not have corrected these problems as MS hoped .	St
1.2.3	Consider reinstalling all the USB conttrollers on the 5160 , here is the steps from MS : To remove and reinstall all USB controllers , follow these steps : Click Start , click Run , type sysdm.cpl in the Open box , and then click OK. Click the Hardware tab .	St
1.2.4	Click the Device Manager button .	St
1.2.5	Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers .	St
1.2.6	Right-click every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node , and then click Uninstall to remove them one at a time .	St
1.2.7	Restart the computer , and then reinstall the USB controllers .	St
1.2.8	Plug in the removable USB storage device , and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved .	St
