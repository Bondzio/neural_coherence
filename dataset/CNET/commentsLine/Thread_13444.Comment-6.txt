owned it for about a month now.
absolutely delighted!
primary uses are looking at email and the web while watching tv.
battery lasts for 5 days with moderate usage.
discovered several additional uses that i had never intended, such as using it as a gps navigator in the car!
still experimenting with additional android tablet apps.
much more useful than i had originally thought, and way cheaper than the ipad that i originally looked at.
love the full-size ports and the ability to easily replace the battery myself if and when it becomes necessary.
