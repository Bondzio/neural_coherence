Hello I installed ubuntu 12.10 using a CD image and actually did so twice.
In both cases i lost my windows 8, or actually i did not lose it as when i used the recovery disk i re-gained windows 8 but i could not dual boot and only can boot into ubuntu, does so directly I read many forums and Ubuntu site for how to fix this and many said run a boot repair 1- can someone please send me a reliable site or wasy to get boot-repair 2- i found some commands to be typed from ubuntu to run boot repair but to my surprise my ubuntu informed me i did not have boot repair 3- any suggestions in general as how to solve this issue 4- also when i use the remix linux from ubuntu site it goes to another site and when i make a USB it does not boot.
becomes a non-bootable usb, how come?
Thanks a lot in advance and much appreciated for your patience i am still a beginner Reza
