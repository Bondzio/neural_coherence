Error 691.. Access denied because the username and/or password was invalid on the domain. But after a I shut down a second time I am able to get online. I have a Windows XP system, high speed connection. Sound familiar???????And, if so, what should I do?? thanks, Miller

Anytime you have an &quot;error message&quot; copy&paste or write down then enter in your search engine in order to hints&tips on what's up. I suspect, that upon your system boot-up it automatically tries to log-on onto the www or network. It gets a hit(OK) or miss(failed) try and thus the error, especially if it tries to re-enter right were you left out during the freeze. See, if you can edit you boot-up or start-up process NOT to automatically enter into the network, do this manually or from the icon required. The system has so much to do during start-up anything can go wrong and having the network link is just another item to start. I do suspect as well, you can &quot;activate&quot; the network s/w from hi-speed and forgo the actual link-up and do that part manually as stated above. tada -----Willy
