bob, i normally don't call support lines but might have to if a new computer has problems or if there is something i don't understand.
i'm running a 5 year old dell that has had no problems other than the time i installed some beta software and had to reinstall windows.
i needed some help with that.
macs aren't a consideration for me but i do appreciate your response.
