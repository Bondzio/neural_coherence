sadly, if the ports are dead and other ps2 and usb keyboards fail then i look to transfering what parts i can into a new box with another compatible motherboard.
it's out of stock, but 423 socket boards can be cheap.
then you get a new case and start moving it.
the os hopefully will run on worst case will have to be obtained and installed.
do some checks to see what sony wants for repair and then how much for motherboard, case/powersupply and maybe an operating system.
best of luck, bob
