there's a nifty little utility out called hdd health, and i have it on both of my computers.
it measures not only temperature (not in any particular unit) but also other things about your hard drive, and can even predict a possible hd failure date.
at first when you install it, it says its precision is only like 25 percent, but as u keep using it, eventually it will go to 75 or 80 percent.
help file is very useful.
