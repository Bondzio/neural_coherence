unless you get lucky and it's something like we see discussed at  what electronics background do you have?
for example i have not only a volt meter but the usual oscilloscope and other electronic repair items in my little home lab.
if the warranty can't be extended what stops you from opening it up and looking for bad solder joints or burnt spots?
