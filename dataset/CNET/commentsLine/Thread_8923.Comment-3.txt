could i use acronis disk director to copy disk to an external?
and then what do i do install both drives and then set it u via the bios?
also how do i restore the system copy from the external at that point.
i am pretty nervous.
also how do i find if i have the right drivers installed?
and wouldn't those be on the motherboard?
thanks.
