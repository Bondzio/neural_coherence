<s> Hi there: My motherobard is ''P4TSP-D2 that has the following features: up to 3.06GHz(FSB533), 3.6GHz(FSB800) and Celeron Processor from 2.0 to 2.4GHz 400MHz/533MHz/800MHz system interface speed Socket 478 Prescott supports from latest MB version 1.3 of P4TSP-D2. </s>
<s> CHIPSET Intel 848P/ICH5 I have a bisic components in my machine: Gforce 5200 series from biostar, 2x256 DDRAM 400MB . </s>
<s> Intel Pentium 4 processor 3.0GHz 2 drives one is sata which has my operating system and the other one is parralel ide connection. </s>
<s> My question is this. </s>
<s> I can't seem to hardware components in pci slots. </s>
<s> If i do so for example sound card 24 bit creative the PnP dects it as simple pci connection and then i look and instead of giving me the name of creative whic phisically i added it it give generic 56 sound plaster and question marks. </s>
<s> it really acted funny. </s>
<s> It did to all my pci components. </s>
<s> I even check the cmos setup and altered it and no use.No only that but also I formated my hard drvie and re-installed xp but no to avail. </s>
<s> what could be the problem? </s>
<s> This sounds as if the drivers for your hardware aren't installed. </s>
<s> You should have a driver cd that came with your motherboard or computer. </s>
<s> Place it in the cd drive and install the drivers. </s>
<s> You may have to reboot the computer and let Windows install each device. </s>
<s> Almost all addin cards are back to the old ways of install drivers. </s>
<s> Some require (as Stan noted) that the motherboard drivers or BIOS be current as well. </s>
<s> Microsoft will not do this for you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Plug N Play, this means that the MB BIOS will auto assign the IRQ and DMA settings. </s>
<s> A Plug N PLay OS like XP will try to find the drivers, if it can then your OK. </s>
<s> If it can't it may put in it's closest guess, which will probably NOT work. </s>
<s> So for video and sound cards you allwise have to install the correct drivers. </s>
