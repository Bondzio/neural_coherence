I have a Goodway BU2240 / 4 port Card Bus card which fits into one of my PCMCIA slots which doesn't work anymore. It was working fine. Then I took it out, after I had shut down, to take my PC with me. When I returned I put it back in and booted up. It was dead. I put my 3Com card in the slot to make sure it wasn't the slot at fault. I also removed the software and drivers of the card. Put the card in and the system recognized it so I went through the install again. But upon reboot the laptop froze and the card didn't work. Would appreciate any help anyone can offer to help me getting it working again. Goodway hasn't been any help. I have an IBM 390x laptop, running Win98SE. Thanks in advance for the help.

It works in the lower PCMCIA slot. and my 3 Comm card works in the upper slot where I need to have the Card Bus because of the plug in's. So why if both items are working, why are they not working where they once were. Thanks!
