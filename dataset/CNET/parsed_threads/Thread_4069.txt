<s> I am having problems with my microphone, I can hear sound coming from the speakers, however, when I try to use my mic (record or on the web), I can't. </s>
<s> I have tried to use the sound trouble shooter, but it doesn't help because I can't use the mic. </s>
<s> I have also changed mics and tested both mics on other pc's. </s>
<s> stupid question, have you unchecked the usually checked &quot;mute&quot; button in your audio mixer panel? </s>
<s> Yes,I sure did!!! </s>
<s> Not only did I check my general audio settings, I also checked the connections, and the mic itself to see if it was working correctly on another pc. </s>
<s> Here is a sound card trouble shooting chart. </s>
