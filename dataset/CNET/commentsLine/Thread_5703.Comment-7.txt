i buy mine from  they have a wide assortment of the brands.
they are usually half price if not better.
free shipping if you join there club.
the club is free just they setup a regular delivery schedule of ink for you.
which you can adjust as you see fit.
i've been buying mine there for a couple of years now.
there inks are good enough for everyday printing and decent photo output.
if you require top notch finish stick with the retail ink from the manufactor.
they are usually the highest quality.
but not cheap.
this goes for all the generic ink outfits.
for me i haven't needed the highest quality.
also i have found by using the cheaper inks i can go for better paper and get pretty damn good quality there.
just my 2 cents!
