<s> Hi guys, I have been using a Netgear DG834G wireless ADSL router successfully for some years. </s>
<s> We have recently moved house and are now in an apartment block. </s>
<s> I have never made the router 'secure' as nobody was in range. </s>
<s> Now they are and I feel performance is now variable, maybe because others are accessing it. </s>
<s> How can I make it secure? </s>
<s> Be gentle with me , I am not very technical! </s>

<s> - In your web browser's address bar, type in 192.168.0.1 - You will be asked for a login ID and password. </s>
<s> If not set by your ISP to something different, it should be &quot;admin&quot; for login and &quot;password&quot; for the password - On the left side of the screen, go to the Setup section and choose &quot;Wireless Settings&quot; - On the wireless page, you can rename your network (SSID) if you'd like, but to add security choose at minimum WPA, but preferably WPA2 with AES if available. </s>
<s> Below that, enter your own wireless password. </s>
<s> - Once you choose &quot;Apply&quot;, you will lose access to the router since it you have made it secure. </s>
<s> You will need to reconnect all of your wireless devices with the SSID and password that you created. </s>
<s> On PC's, you will probably need to remove the existing wireless network name since PCs will try to connect to the same SSID with the old settings, and your connection will fail. </s>
<s> Thanks for a detailed reply. </s>
<s> I havn't done it yet as I need to move phone lines first, then I can hard wire the router to the desktop. </s>
<s> But I have another issue with the wireless connection. </s>
<s> I connect at 54mbps but it can disappear down to 1mbps. </s>
<s> It is currently at 36. </s>
<s> Is someone hijacking my router? </s>
<s> How can I tell if that is happening? </s>
<s> Thanks guys. </s>

<s> And with that done you run into channel overlap faster than you can blink an eye. </s>
<s> Look at the channel overlap at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels and if you, like others have a 802.11n router that's all of TWO channels available without overlap. </s>
<s> Since those spill over, even if you set your router to 802.11g, you still see the problems. </s>
<s> Best bet is to wire what you can and keep the distances in the 20 foot range in crowded buildings. </s>

<s> It's very possible that someone is connecting wirelessly to your router and causing issues with your connection. </s>
<s> Anyone can connect wirelessly if your router is not secured. </s>
<s> Being in an apartment, you are likely to have several people connecting without your knowledge. </s>
<s> You can access the web interface for your router (at 192.168.0.1) to see what devices are connected. </s>
<s> It should be under a section labeled &quot;connected devices&quot; or similar. </s>
<s> I would strongly urge you to enable wireless security immediately, as it would not be difficult for others to access your devices and do something malicious with your wireless open. </s>
