1.1.1	I have had Comcast cable internet for about 3 years now and have always used the same RCA cable modem and have had no problems .	St
1.1.2	Two months ago I first starting having a problem where the internet randomly disconnects but the modem is blinking exactly as it does when it 's connected .	St
1.1.3	I 'd have to wait several hours before the internet would work again and had no clue why .	St
1.1.4	This only happened about once a week so I figured it was comcast fixing something each time .	St
1.1.5	About a week ago it did this and did not come back on for over 24 hours .	St
1.1.6	I called Comcast and asked them how to fix this and they told me to open up my Network Connections folder and disable Local Area Connection 2 .	St
1.1.7	After that I need to unplug my cable modem and plug it back in until the lights are all blinking as normal .	St
1.1.8	I then have to enable Local Area Connection 2 and the internet works again .	St
1.1.9	I was glad to find a solution to the problem , but now this happens every several minutes !	St
1.1.10	The problem seems to happen a lot more often when I am downloading torrents or other p2p files but this never used to happen .	St
1.1.11	I 've had to fix the problem four times while typing this message , can anybody help me ?	Ques
1.1.12	I 'd like to rid myself of this problem or at least minimize it .	St
1.2.1	a P2P sharing program points to some form of malware infestation .	St
1.2.2	If this is the only PC on the LAN , try another .	St
1.2.3	This will tell if the disconnects are related to your original PC , a faulty modem or an ISP issue .	St
1.3.1	Comcast has upgraded their system to a newer protocol .	St
1.3.2	Some of the older modems are not compatible .	St
1.3.3	The list of modems is at the Comcast site .	St
1.3.4	And the new protocol enables faster speeds .	St
1.3.5	I replaced my D-link DCM-200 to a new DCM-202 and my speed went from 3 Mb/s to over 6 .	St
1.3.6	And Comcast is in the process of upgrading again to an advertised 11 Mb/s .	St
1.3.7	Replace the modem .	St
1.4.1	Are they both DHCP ?	Ques
1.4.2	Does this mean you have 2 default gateways as well ?	Ques
1.4.3	Windows typically uses 1 gateway and never resorts to the second gateway until packet loss is detected .	St
1.4.4	My guess is that your P2P software is opening bunches of tcp sessions and you router can not handle it .	St
1.4.5	Your $ 50 router can only track a certaing number of sessions .	St
1.4.6	It seems many consumer routers stop functioning when the NAT limit is exceeded .	St
1.4.7	Try turning it off or stop sharing your directory with others to cut down on sessions .	St
1.4.8	Trace Route to yahoo or the DNS server when the problem happens to see if traffic even gets past your router .	St
1.4.9	You should do this while the network is healthy and keep a copy handy for future reference .	St
1.4.10	SKrall	St
1.5.1	I 'm not sure if I found the right list but my modem model ( DCM305 ) was on the list of cable modems approved for use with the Comcast High-Speed Internet Service at http : //www.comcast.net/help/faq/index.jsp ? faq=ConnectionCable_Modems17905 This list might not be up-to-date so could you please check if mine is on the list you were referring to or send me a link ?	Ques
1.5.2	Also , I 've tested my download speed and it 's maxing out at only 1.5mbps when it was maxing out at 6.2mbps only a few months ago .	St
1.6.1	I 've always used Local Area Connection 2 as far back as I can remember .	St
1.6.2	Local Area Connection is disabled and if I enable it I get an error saying & quot ; A network cable is unplugged & quot ; .	St
1.6.3	I do n't worry about that because my internet has always worked fine with it disabled .	St
1.6.4	The internet disconnects often even when I 'm not using P2P file sharing software but it only happens every 30 minutes or so instead of every 2 to 20 minutes while running P2P file sharing software .	St
1.6.5	I 've only been downloading 2 large files and used to download 10+ at a time without a problem .	St
1.6.6	I 'm basically downloading files I wont be able to download when I relocate in 3 weeks and cancel my comcast subscription .	St
1.6.7	I really see no benefit in buying a new modem , if that is the cause of the problem , just to use it for 3 weeks .	St
1.7.1	Your modem is DOCSIS is 1.0/1.1 ( the older cable protocol ) .	St
1.7.2	The newer protocol is DOCSIS 2.0 .	St
1.7.3	Your modem is indeed approved for Comcast , but the newer protocol is needed to get the higher speeds .	St
1.7.4	The D-link DCM-202 is DOCSIS 2.0 protocol .	St
1.7.5	I 'd buy the D-link , try it , and if it works you 're set .	St
1.7.6	If it does n't work , return it and we 'll try another route .	St
1.8.1	Some Virus do port scans looking for a new target to infect .	St
1.8.2	This can have the same effect as P2P software opening many TCP connections and crashing the router .	St
1.8.3	When in doubt , download the free Ethereal scanner and capture everything in/out of your PC ethernet card .	St
1.8.4	Shut down all browsers and mail and just scann your ethernet and see what traffic generates on its own .	St
1.8.5	This will give you a hint of what is going on .	St
1.8.6	I seriously doubt the problem is Comcast .	St
