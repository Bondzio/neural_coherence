hi, they were all jumpered and booted and cabled etc correctly.
the only thing is when i tried to boot from my master drive a windows32 seup file was missing so i had to change my bios to boot from my win xp pro cd.
windows has now almost finished installing itself, and i expect it means i will have lost everything on the master drive - but im hoping that everything on the slave is intact as this was my main storage drive.
fingers crossed.
(but then i suppose even if i did loose it all that would serve me right for not backing up for about a year!
lol) thanks so much for your help, i really appreciate it - i would have been trying to figure this out for days, even weeks if you hadnt been here!!
take care & thanks again cat
