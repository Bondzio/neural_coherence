&quot;i have set up a database using microsoft access and when i saved it to the server, no one else could access it or add any data to it.i then set up the individual stations with the same database, but could not retrieve any information from them and they did not allow me to download the info from their computer or even add it to my workstation program.&quot; i'm not going to dive into access programming or file permissions.
any it staffer can do that.
however access is a poorman's database.
it's single user and too easy to corrupt in a multi-user environment.
let me share i install mysql on the server then create the tables and then via myodbc or my custom application allow what you are asking.
mysql, myodbc are free and easy to find at google.com i've seen a few expend thousands (hours or dollars) in access but again i share i don't use it anymore.
i found it too expensive.
