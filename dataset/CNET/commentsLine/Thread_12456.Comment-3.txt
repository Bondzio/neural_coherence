it is a g4 800mhz i would just get an airport card but i was told only the older discontinued ones will work and people want $60 plus for an outdated card.
doesnt make sense to spend 60 bux on a card that uses an old standard when i could go down to wal mart and have a selection of faster wireless adapters for around 40 dollars.
of course those dont seem to work.
the extreme will work with the g4 ibook?
