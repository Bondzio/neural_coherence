running xp home sp2.
currently have an nvidia geforce2 mx 64 meg video card in the agp slot.
going to replace it with a geforce fx5500 256mb ddr agp card.
what's the best/correct process to replace it?
the nvidia drivers are listed in add/remove.
can i swap the cards, power up and run the new drivers install cd?
or should i uninstall the old ones first.
tlia, wayne
