&quot;I have a user that lost her restore CD with her EMachine.
I can use my XP HE CD as long as I use the key that is on the PC?
It is an OEM XP HE, BTW.&quot; The keys sometimes don't take on the foriegn version of the OS.
It's all in the plan to curb piracy of the OS.
It's also been noted that using another CD has resulted in the machine taking a fatal exception requiring a total install.
Proceed with caution.
Bob
