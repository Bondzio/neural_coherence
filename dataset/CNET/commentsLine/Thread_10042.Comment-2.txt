(buy one with embedded sound and video) with new cpu and memory, combined with a new psu and a new hard disk, in essence is a new pc in an old case.
why not add a dvd-burner to replace the cd-rom?
then all is new!
it might be cheaper to buy everything new, including the case, if you can get a nice deal.
and it certainly is less work.
