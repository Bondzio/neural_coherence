<s> I just received an external CD writer from the US where the power used is 110V I live in India and here the power is 220V Do i need to buy a transformer to work this device here or just an ordinary adapter would do? </s>
<s> I don't want to damage either the device or my pc by not using the correct power connection </s>
<s> Your choice on make and model. </s>
<s> Anything that will convert 220 to 110. </s>
<s> Thank you.Got a voltage convertor - input 330v-240v and output 110v-120v </s>
