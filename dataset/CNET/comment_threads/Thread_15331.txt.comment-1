Hello, I am using Tenda WiFi Router Model no W316R.
It is working fine for my Laptop also on Nokia C3-00 cell phone.
Problem is that when i click on Youtube Videos on Cell phone, media player shows an error &quot;No Responce&quot; after few seconds.
I showed my phone to company outlet they said that configure your Router properly for Streming on Cell phone.
Will Somebody guide me step by step to solve the problem.
Thanks.
