Especially with an AMD X2!
AMD features their 'cool 'n' quiet' technology which does indeed keep things cool and quiet.
Unless you're going to lock the multiplier and overclock, etc, there shouldn't be any problems with overheating on the stock HSF, unless you've got some other issues going on.
(Incidentally, I hear that the new HSFs that AMD is sending out with their CPUs are pretty decent and that spending 50 bucks to replace it with an aftermarket HSF is a waste of 50 bucks.)
One of my PCs is an HP with a 4200 X2, an ATI graphics card, a 400W PSU and a little more memory- everything else is stock.
I've had no problems with the system, even with moderate ('very high' settings, not the highest settings) gaming.
