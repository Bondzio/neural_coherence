<s> My PC's CD/DVD player has twice over the last couple of months made a noise like there's something loose inside the player when a CD or DVD is playing, and when I ejected it, a flat donut-shaped, gray foam/felt object that's exactly 1-3/8&quot; wide came out. </s>
<s> The 1st one looked like it had a lot of radial marks in it on one side, but the 2nd one was smooth on both sides. </s>
<s> The unit kept working after the 1st one came out, so I forgot about it, and now a couple of months later, the 2nd one has come out, but it's still working. </s>
<s> I have a 2002 Dell Dimension 4550 PC and the CD/DVD drive is a Memorex 16-X player. </s>
<s> Did these objects come from the player or did somebody put them there when I wasn't looking? </s>
<s> If they came from the player, is this a minor or major issue to leave them out, and if I need to put them back in, is there a link to a tutorial to guide me thru it? </s>
<s> If the drive is from 2002 too, then consider you got your moneys worth. </s>
<s> I would replace, ASAP. </s>
<s> The cost isn't that much and it may take out a precious CD you may like. </s>
<s> Anything coming/falling from a drive is bad news. </s>
<s> -OR- you could use it until it really poops out. </s>
<s> Its your choice, but again, I would replace it. </s>
<s> Also, if you have kids, are they into mischief? </s>
<s> If possible post a link with some pics of the items in question. </s>

<s> someone is pulling your legs, hehe. </s>
<s> But good luck, dvd drive are cheap. </s>
