1.1.1	I just read about an interesting font , called & quot ; Ecofont. & quot ; It supposedly saves 20 % of the typical ink used by a laser printer .	St
1.1.2	The site is here : http : //www.ecofont.eu/look_at_ecofont_en.html Anyways , I 'm wondering about this claim .	St
1.1.3	It is made on the basis that the letters in this font have small white circles throughout the letters , which is plainly visible if you print it in a large font size ; and barely so at 12 point font .	St
1.1.4	My question -- will this in fact save ink ?	Ques
1.1.5	I have looked at the Draft mode within MS Word , but that hardly is any different from the normal mode .	St
1.1.6	My laser printer ( HP 1018 ) has an & quot ; economode & quot ; setting which obviuosly uses less ink , but is a bit of an eyesore .	St
1.1.7	I hand out a lot of material that is hard to comprehend and I ca n't afford folks to be put off by a hard-to-read printout .	St
1.1.8	This appears to be the only real option I have to save ink , but I 'm wondering -- will this in fact save any ink ?	Ques
1.1.9	Or is the mechanics of laser printing such that it really wo n't save anything ?	Ques
1.1.10	If not , I 'd rather not even bother with changing fonts from Times New Roman to this and then back again .	St
1.1.11	Any thoughts ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //falcon.jmu.edu/~johns2ja/illusion/onlywhitecirclesatintersections.gif I think it 's a great idea but needs work to avoid the optical illusion and visual issues .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Let me guess ... you installed the font but did n't like what you saw ?	Ques
1.3.2	It looks pretty crummy on a word processor but it prints out just fine .	St
1.3.3	Or was this your way of saying that this claim of saving 20 % is just an illusion ?	Ques
1.4.1	It may work .	St
1.4.2	But I 'm not going to test it .	St
1.4.3	The method is as old as the printing press so let 's not think this is a new idea .	St
1.4.4	I see the optical illusion issue and dug up a picture to show the issue .	St
1.4.5	What I am saying is the font needs work .	St
1.4.6	But the premise is sound .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	See this link .	St
1.5.2	He says that any ink savings depends on what font you typically print with .	St
1.5.3	He calculates ( by comparing pixels to dots of ink on a paper ) that serif fonts ( Times New Roman is the most common serif font ) actually consume a lot less ink than this font , though .	St
1.5.4	However , compared to some sans serif fonts , you can save 20 % -- but again , the savings depend on what font you use .	St
1.5.5	http : //farlukar.110mb.com/stuff.php # ecofont	St
1.6.1	EcoFont is a step in the right direction .	St
1.6.2	Not only ink is expensive , the printers do a great job spending it !	St
1.6.3	I recently found a software utility , PretonSaver Home , that & quot ; turns & quot ; every font to eco-font .	St
1.6.4	It reduces ink consumption by up to 70 % and provides excellent print quality .	St
1.6.5	I did not have to change the fonts I use or change the way I print .	St
1.6.6	PretonSaver works in the background and very smartly optimizes the ink/toner used by my printers .	St
1.6.7	Try it for free .	St
1.6.8	Download PretonSaver from halftheink.com ( http : //www.halftheink.com )	St
1.7.1	Eco-fonts or control of inkjets is n't new , but the principal is sound .	St
1.7.2	The basis of using ink in the 100 % use of the nozzles will produce ink overrun ( excess ) which in turn makes for a solid printed output .	St
1.7.3	What is typical of so-called ink control is the non-firing of adjacent ink nozzles causing less ink usage and the & quot ; ink overrun & quot ; will still cover the missed spaces and for most fonts being used appear OK or at least for plain text offer reasonable results .	St
1.7.4	Alot depends on the font being used , the paper , and printer printhead in general .	St
1.7.5	If a printhead has say , 50 ink nozzles will show better results than one with 40 .	St
1.7.6	The paper itself due to & quot ; ink sop & quot ; or ink absorbing quality .	St
1.7.7	As for the font itself , they lend a pattern for output to be done and if less dense , on its own merits becomes less effective is even more non-print pattern is followed .	St
1.7.8	Savvy ? ? ?	Ques
1.7.9	To answer your question , yeah they do work .	St
1.7.10	But , to what degree is up to the ink control ( driver ) being used .	St
1.7.11	The eco-font in question is just proving a print pattern ( bit map ) that is using less ink nozzles to create that font .	St
