<s> List all the parts that didn't beep. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It doesent beep at all on bare minimum power and CPU fan, It's been abused for years, Overclocked to over 1000mhz despite the CPU being 858mhz, Its had Pencil lines on the CPU to Do overclockers tweaks to it, agp and ISA Clocking, Too high Refresh rates e.t.c, now I have a new PC it was my guini pig, so I kind of expected it to break in a way, but I will get it another mobo and sqeeze a few more years out of her as a linux machine </s>
<s> You might have found it finally melted down. </s>
<s> Try another CPU and check the MOTHERBOARD CAPACITORS for the issue in this next link. </s>
<s> I have a dead socket A board and the CPU lived due to this... http://www.badcaps.net/ Bob </s>
<s> I don't think it is a First Gen, Correct me If I'm wrong though It's a 850mhz Athlon From their 1999 range of 800,850,900,950 and 1ghz Cpu's (I think). </s>
<s> It's the Thunderbird Core, So I don't think it's a 1st gen, but do correct me if I'm wrong </s>
<s> Sorry, but those did melt. </s>
<s> How did the capacitor check go? </s>
