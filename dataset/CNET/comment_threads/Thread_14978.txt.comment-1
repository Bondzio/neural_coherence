I have just purchased a Crossover Cable from eBay and I was wondering if that was the right choice.
I do not know the difference between crossover, and patch and all that.
Could someone explain this to me please.
I want to connect my computer or 360 to a router.
I also might use this to connect my modem to my router, and so on.
Will I be able to use a crossover cable in everyday networking?
