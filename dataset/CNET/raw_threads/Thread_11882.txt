I just purchased a 100 pack of blank dvds and when I put the blank disc in, it takes awhile to read them and it is showing that they are not blank. I put in a blank cd and that shows as being blank. Can anyone help me to figure out why it is not reading my blank dvds as blank or what I can do to fix this issue?

And you are right, it is alot easier to replace and easier to work with. I will go out and buy another one... only about $40 at my local store... thanks!
