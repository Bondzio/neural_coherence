Hi Bob, I checked the sticky which contains some pretty elementary basics for set-up.
My knowledge base is far beyond this.
I've worked with other Wifi routers, even other D-Link routers and have never encountered problems like I am encountering with the DI-624.
I bought it based on CNET's recommendation.
There are a plethora of complaints about the DI-624 out there.
We all have the same problem.
The radio just drops out occasionally and we lose the connection.
I'm curious to look into a Broadcom-based router so that I can install Tomato firmware.
