<s> On my laptop there are two air vents in the back. </s>
<s> When I play videogames both vents blow hot air out and work perfectly. </s>
<s> However when I am simply browsing the internet or not even on my comp, only the left fan runs and it is very loud. </s>
<s> The right side (which fan isnt running) is noticeably hotter. </s>
<s> What could be wrong with my comp? </s>
<s> This has been going on for about two months and it really worries me because the laptop is only 1 year old </s>
<s> It could sound as if this was by some design. </s>
<s> Of course you've already done the usual canned air cleaning, right? </s>
<s> If you've done no configuration for fan operation, then its doing what most laptops do, operate on an as need basis. </s>
<s> They get turned-ON when it gets hotter for whatever setting or sensor activation. </s>
<s> Since, you mentioned a 1yr. </s>
<s> use, maybe its time to do at least the basic &quot;cleaning cycle&quot; of the laptop. </s>
<s> Once done and it acts the same, then its done what its setting were at. </s>

<s> You don't like this model. </s>
<s> Try another? </s>
<s> I clean out my fans quite often so I dont think it is a cleaning issue. </s>
<s> The main thing that bugs me though is that it seems that the laptop is using the one fan too an extreme when its not necessary. </s>
<s> What happens is I leave my laptop for 10 minutes, when I comeback the one fan is roaring while the other does nothing, but if I dont leave my laptop and am constantly browsing the web or typing neither fan is really blowing. </s>
<s> Once the fan starts going it goes on and off until I shut down or restart my computer. </s>
<s> My BIOS is up to date. </s>
<s> My Laptop is an Alienware m17x R3 with i7quad core and Radeon 6990 HD Graphics card </s>
<s> Replace the fan and use the Laptop Cooling Pad for it. </s>
