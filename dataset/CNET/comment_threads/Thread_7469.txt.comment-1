Hi there, I run windows XP Pro with SP2 all updates done.
I recentley had the local I.T.
wiz, install me a second hard drive of 160GB along with a DVD-RW drive and a couple of software packages (main one is called 'MySonic' DVD).
I want to use this software on my new hard drive for my video's and slide shows, but don't know how to change it from drive 'C', to drive Archive 'F'?
In Disk Management, it shows both drives...as follows..... Archive (F:)..PARTION..BASIC..NTFS..HEALTHY..149.05GB..148.94..99%FREE...NO WINXP (C:)..PARTITION..BASIC..NTFS..HEALTHY(system)..37.26GB..10.29GB..27%..NO..
Both drives seen to be marked as 'primary partition' I am sure it is a simple thing to do, but I admit to being a novice at this type of thing, so any help at all would be great, but please, keep it simple as poss, thanks a lot for your time guys.
Malc.
(p.s.
Don't know where the smiley's come from)
