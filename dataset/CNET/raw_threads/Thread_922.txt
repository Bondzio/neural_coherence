I'm choosing between the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and the Acer Aspire v5-413. Based on productivity and convenience, which should I get? If it helps, the course I'm taking is BS Accountancy. Also, I currently own a 3-year old Acer Aspire One d250, although it's not in top condition anymore. It looks a bit beaten up but still works okay.
