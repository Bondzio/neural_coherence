<s> Howdy all, I am an AV Tech, responsible for maintaining equipment at for an installation with about 300 staff. </s>
<s> Last week, one of our staff returned a ViewSonic PJ 658 projector, and they had broken the adjuster foor off. </s>
<s> The viewSonic Tech guys gave me the part number, but this is an out-of stock item. </s>
<s> It is the screw-height adjuster leg. </s>
<s> I am usually pretty good at finding these things, but have found nothing so far. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of a repository of oddball viewsonic parts? </s>
<s> Anybody buy these things when they are broken and part them out? </s>
<s> I kind of stinks that we can't use this just now because it is functioning properly...you just can't get a level image to project. </s>
<s> All Help appreciated. </s>
<s> It's strange you mentioned this. </s>
<s> A projector at the office lost a foot so one of the office staff whittled one from some wood. </s>
<s> If you want to not make a part, try Ebay, craigslist and place that part on order at Viewsonic. </s>
