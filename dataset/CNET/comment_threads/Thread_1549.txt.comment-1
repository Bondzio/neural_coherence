Here's my problem.
I have a wired desktop and a wireless laptop (both XP) going througha linksys router to the internet.
I have file sharing turned on and shared folders on both computers; but, I can only access the folders on the laptop.
I can see the folders of both my desktop and laptop when I look at Network Neighborhood on both PCs but can't access the folders on the desktop through Network Neighborhood (on either computer).
Everytime I get the error &quot;XXX is not accessible.&quot; Both are on the same workgroup and I never changed the permissions of the folder on the desktop.
I know for a fact that the shared folders have worked in the past, but I don't know what happened.
Oh, and the printer works fine on the shared network.
It is connected to my desktop and I can print to it from my laptop.
Please help!
