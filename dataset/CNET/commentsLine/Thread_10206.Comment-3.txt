thanks for your reply.
when i go into ibm access connections/connection status, it says &quot;ip adress not assigned&quot;.
shouldn't there be one there and if so, how do i get it?
also under diagnostic tools, the ip address shows as 0.0.0.0. i am obviously not an expert on this .
just enough knowledge to be dangerous.
