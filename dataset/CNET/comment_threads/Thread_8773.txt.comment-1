I have several HDs from my older computers.
They were the master drives, running XP.
I have a new computer, and wish to copy their data.
I use a SATA Jazz drive to connect the drive to my USB port, and I can access the drive.
Howerver, when I select the 'my documents' folder on the old drive, I get a 'you do not have permission' message.
this must be because my account was password protected...however, there is no provision to enter the password (I use file manager to access the drive).
Is there a software utility I can download that would help?
I am stuck...
