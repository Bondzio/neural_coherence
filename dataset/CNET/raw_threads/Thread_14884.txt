I narrowed it down because i tried some overly extensive programs, on my other drives. Nothing. All good, on my D drive my computer completely froze when i tried anything, then it took two reboots to get back up. Also I am hearing some whirring then a sound of brakes screaming or an engine build up then CLUNK CLUNK. Now it's dead silent but still recognized and files are readable albeit anything run freezes my computer on D drive. I'm pretty much certain it's a soon to be dead drive. I've restored everything i can from it, but i just wanted your thoughts? Dead Drive, overheating? Thanks!

I ripped and encoded one of my dvd's on another drive, no problems, encoded, again no problems, but a simple cut and paste of a file originating on my D:\ drive to another disk produced another hard reboot. Played a game originating on another drive, again no problems. so i do think the HD is shot. Thanks!
