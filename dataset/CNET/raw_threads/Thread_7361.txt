I haven't actually seen that HP touchpad for 200. I was thinking of getting that one anyway, but I wanted to check what the best one was in 300-400 price range or does it not really change?

I want to find out what the best tablets I can find for a higher price and see if it's worth saving more money as opposed to getting something under 200 that may not be as good.

Let me warn you about the lesser tablets. Some don't have multi-touch, the android market, g sensors, etc. If you don't get the basics you may be unhappy. Bob
