1.1.1	Hi , A small business in my town recently got new IBM PCs .	St
1.1.2	They then upgraded from Win98SE to WinXP Pro .	St
1.1.3	They took all of there networking configuration from 98SE and entered them into XP Pro .	St
1.1.4	The host PC has an IP address of 192.168.0.12 .	St
1.1.5	The other three are .13 , .14 , .11 .	St
1.1.6	All subnet masks are set to 255.255.255.0 .	St
1.1.7	Default gateway is set to 192.168.1.1 .	St
1.1.8	There are 3 shared folders , G , H , P .	St
1.1.9	When the non-hosts try to access info on G : , a message shows that this drive is set as & quot ; Read Only & quot ; .	St
1.1.10	H and P can be accessed with no trouble .	St
1.1.11	This happens when the non-host PC users are trying to access Word Perfect files on G : .	St
1.1.12	Also , when the files are edited on the host PC , the other PCs do n't see the change .	St
1.1.13	We have tried to remove the read- only status , but it does n't stick .	St
1.1.14	Can anyone help ?	Ques
1.1.15	Thanks , Paul	St
1.2.1	& quot ; 192.168.0.12 .	St
1.2.2	The other three are .13 , .14 , .11 .	St
1.2.3	All subnet masks are set to 255.255.255.0 .	St
1.2.4	Default gateway is set to 192.168.1.1. & quot ; Blam .	St
1.2.5	The default gateway is not on the LAN .	St
1.2.6	Look at the numbers and there 's an error right there .	St
1.2.7	You may respond & quot ; it worked before & quot ; , but it 's still an error .	St
1.2.8	As to the read-only thing , XP is a new ball game with & quot ; users and permissions. & quot ; The XP that is serving will have to have the users added with the same passwords as on the client machines .	St
1.2.9	This and more at http : //www.wown.com and http : //www.practicallynetworked.com Tip : Delete this registry key to speed it back up - & gt ; Disable searching for scheduled tasks This Microsoft Knowledge Base article 245800 describes a bug in Windows 2000 Professional that also exists in Windows XP .

1.2.10	Disable searching for scheduled tasks by deleting this registry key , normally on one line , but broken here presentation .	St
1.2.11	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\ CurrentVersion\Explorer\RemoteComputer\NameSpace\ { D6277990-4C6A-11CF-8D87-00AA0060F5BF } Bob	St
1.3.1	I ca n't know this one .	St
1.3.2	I can tell that without added ROUTE ADD commands , given the LAN NETMASK is 255.255.255.0 and the Lan IPs are in the 192.168.1.x range , then that gateway is that & quot ; x & quot ; value from 1 to 254 .	St
1.3.3	But I ca n't tell with the supplied info which machine it is .	St
1.3.4	I 'm only pointing out this is a flawed entry with the information supplied .	St
1.3.5	My hunch is that the NEW way of NT/2000/XP/2003 and that users have to be added to each machine can be daunting until you get it all entered on each machine .	St
