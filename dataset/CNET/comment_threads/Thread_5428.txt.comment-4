There's a nifty little utility out called HDD Health, and I have it on both of my computers.
It measures not only temperature (not in any particular unit) but also other things about your hard drive, and can even predict a possible HD Failure date.
At first when you install it, it says its precision is only like 25 percent, but as u keep using it, eventually it will go to 75 or 80 percent.
Help file is very useful.
