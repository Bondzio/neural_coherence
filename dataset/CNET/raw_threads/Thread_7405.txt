It has three USB ports (one at the back and two on the side). I usually use the one at the back to connect a mouse while one of the ones on the side is usually use to connect to a printer. The second on the side is usually for connecting my flashdrive. One morning about 3 weeks ago, all three ports stopped working; they recognise any USB device connected to the ports. We have tried uninstalling and re-installing the drivers. This has not restored the ports. It has been suggested to re-install the operating system but this could not be carried out because the optical drive had seized functioning and have depended on an external USB DVD RW. Any suggestions how to overcome this predicament? Thanks Oladele Afolabi Ile-Ife, Nigeria

Since your drive has failed it's much like trying to fix a flat on your car but missing the spare tire. Do this the right way. Fix the broken parts, reload the OS and see if the ports work. Bob

I suggest you at least verify the USB ports are active in the bios area. Once checked, get your hands on a registry cleaner for windows, that's XP capable, run it and reboot after its done its job. That will clear any registry flags, etc., and hopefully return to a more pristine registry. If the USB ports fail still, unplug all, and make sure if vailable to use a PS/2 mouse port for a mouse instead of USB. You may need to enter bios again and enter PS/2 for mouse usage. If it still fails you may have a h/w fault with the USB ports and no end-user is applicable other than replace mtrbd.. The last option if not a h/w fault, then reload the OS as others offered to restart fresh, this will prove either a h/w or s/w(OS) fault if it fails to function. The only other option as I see it, you may have a flaky power link to USB ports again possible mtrbd. h/w fault(wiring) or chips overheated and are done in.
