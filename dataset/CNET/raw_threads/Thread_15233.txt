4336	3	378861	3225401	3225116	Nick_ab	1/18/10 11:25 AM	1.2638139E12	cpu noise	fan ok mean way cpu quietfrom bios maybecheck subwebaddr thanks
4336	4	378861	3225408	3225401	VAPCMD	1/18/10 11:55 AM	1.2638157E12	probably indicated pc	list main components without really difficult tell component components generating noise could cpu heatsink fan itself video card fan power supply fan case fan vapcmd
4336	5	378861	3225462	3225408	Nick_ab	1/18/10 12:28 PM	1.26381768E12	ok pc	mother gaeg mfus cpu intel core duo grafic card extra fans fan cpuagain mean sound cpu running programsmakes lot noiseaso iv read people noticed problem kinda drives crazy timesso should
4336	6	378861	3225495	3225462	Steven Haninger	1/18/10 12:53 PM	1.26381918E12	start describing noise	exactly where hear coming cpu mechanical parts transducers noise actual noise cpu could death knell while crackling hissing heat could hearing heat threshold warnings mb often bios configurable
4336	7	378861	3225499	3225495	Nick_ab	1/18/10 1:04 PM	1.26381984E12	em	sounds coming cpu grr grr grr execute proramall pc noise thinkso tell cpu actualy workingcpu temperatue cso else noise
4336	8	378861	3225559	3225499	Steven Haninger	1/18/10 2:51 PM	1.26382626E12	ok maybe terminology issue	cpu central processing unit usually small flat square sandwiched between motherboard mounting heatsinkfan assembly heard folks use cpu mean entire box mouse keyboard monitor etc attached whole box calling cpu could guess noise comes hard drive generally loud run program hard drive being accessed noise presuming youve already opened case stuck ear interior listen noise could offer sometimes cardboard tube such empty roll paper towels such help isolate noise stick ear listen around case let anyone doing
4336	9	378861	3225909	3225559	Nick_ab	1/19/10 4:02 AM	1.26387372E12	cpu noise	cpu processor hear noise computer boots executing program onit happens mine louder hear fan bit wich ok hear hard drive boot wich ok noise wich sounds comming cpu under fan sounds cpu forcing self times guys hear pc others check subwebaddr limit noise thanks
4336	10	378861	3227420	3225909	Steven Haninger	1/20/10 3:20 PM	1.2640008E12	making noise triggering noise	huge difference noises generated temperatures cross thermal thresholds documented noises come transducer motherboard maybe monitoring software through speakers such noise triggered made device thats too hot youd look such bios check software monitoring temperature temp ok threshold might set low thats offer
4336	11	378861	3227727	3227420	Nick_ab	1/21/10 4:03 AM	1.26404658E12	thanks	ok thanks il say motherboard cpu ram newbut old power suply wattsas old hdd havent added grafic card yet temperatures hdd cpu core thanks theres anything youd addim
