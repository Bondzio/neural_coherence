I have found out that I bought the computer with a partitioned hard drive, one is primary, one is logical. I want to merge the two into the one whole and complete hard drive. I am staring from scratch, so none of the files are sacred. My XP disk does not give the option of merging and I can't afford the $100.00 for Partition Magic. Are there other options for me out there? Sony Vio, 36 GB HD, 768 RAM

Are you certain that the other partition is not a partition used by the Laptop mfr to store the op sys and all the drivers, and that your CD is actually a restore CD? Proprietary Systems normally do this, i.e. Dell, Compaq, Gateway, etc.

If none or problematic, then going to the laptop makers support website for that model's drivers will be required. This process takes place after loading the OS. Ray, pretty covered the OS install process, just load your XP Pro CD and &quot;make sure the CD is 1st boot device in bios&quot;. Once done, when prompted upon the HD format, make all space available for a &quot;C&quot; drive option or 1 partition. good luck tada -----Willy
