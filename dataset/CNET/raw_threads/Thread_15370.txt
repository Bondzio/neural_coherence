I wonder if an appliance solution would be better and would like to get some feedback from my fellow techies... What firewall do you use and why? If I implement another smoothwall then I have to buy a new machine for it by which time I may as well just buy an appliance. I wouldn't mind seeing the back of smoothwall, but if I am to consider another solution it must interoperate with smoothwall in order keep vpns between sites etc...
