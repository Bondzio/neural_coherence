<s> hi, I was wanting to get a new router as i have the 1 supplied by the provider (D-Link DSL - 2640r). </s>
<s> it works well on my computer and PS3 which i use wired connection for but is useless when it comes to wireless and i am moving my PS3 onto a new tv downstairs and my connection will be very poor. </s>
<s> i shall also use network storage on this router for family laptops etc. </s>
<s> So i was wondering if any one could guide me on how to go about setting this product up i.e.. modem, filters etc. </s>
<s> i have done my research on this subject but haven't been able to find my answers. </s>
<s> i have a adsl connection. </s>
<s> would and what modem if any would i need to purchase. </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> Keep it all D-link. </s>
<s> I have a D-link modem (cable) and the DIR-655 wireless N Gigabit router. </s>
<s> Easy setup, just run the CD that comes with the router. </s>
<s> It'll hold your hand throughout, show you how to connect the devices wired and how to configure wireless and set up wireless security. </s>
<s> Unless you have wireless N and Gigabit NICs in the PCs (I do), the DIR-655 is a little overkill. </s>
<s> But it's an excellent router, and you've planned for the future. </s>
<s> thank you for this advice and i was planning to keep all D-Link however i am quite unexperienced in the modem area as i am used to them being built-in. </s>
<s> so do i have to buy a certain type or speed and which do u recommend ? </s>
<s> Visit the D-link site or any good on line seller. </s>
<s> They're all the same as far as DSL, but different from a cable modem. </s>
<s> I'd get this one http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16825112003 </s>
<s> with these dsl modems is there any speed or frequency factors i have to consider when buying like which ones are fastest etc. </s>
<s> i assume these are really easy to set up with no software. </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> The Internet connection speed is dependent on your provider, not the modem. </s>
<s> The modem will handle anything from the provider. </s>
<s> They're plug and play. </s>
<s> You will need to contact your provider and give them the MAC address of the modem so they can set it up. </s>
<s> Call'em, they'll walk you through it. </s>
<s> thank you for this information and i am sorry that i know so little. </s>
<s> so i have to call my provider up and simply say i have a new modem and they will change the settings too the modem for it to work correctly ? </s>
