so after actually doing some research i think i may need to rebudget a bit to get one i'll be really happy with but i think i have found one that meets the spirit of my requirements if not the letter so unless anyone has had any bad experiences with it that i haven't found yet i think i'm going to go with the toshiba thrive no it doesn't charge via usb but it has decent battery life and a user replaceable battery so i can still extend the life for longer trips it may cost $80 for each 7-11 hour extension but its nice to know that when the battery gets old it won't mean retiring the tab or shipping it back to the manufacturer 10.1 inch screen is a little larger than i was thinking if they made a 7 inch version of the thrive i'd be all over it but thats still not to bad i like the rubberized backing on the thrive it feels tough and the texture will help to keep it from getting dropped here is the biggest reason(along with the replaceable battery) it has a full sized sd card port and a full usb 2.0 port that can read flash/external hds.
i know programs like dropbox are great but sometimes your(or at least i'm)out of wifi range and i can't afford a monthly charge for 3g service.
its a 1ghz dual core with 1gb memory so its fairly fast it has full sized usb ports and can use any keyboard with a usb plug its a bit more than i want to spend but when it comes down to &quot;what does it do how well does it do it&quot; sometimes you have to bite the bullet and budget a little bit does anyone know any reason why i shouldn't go for the thrive?
as for my issues with itunes i just think its a huge resource hog for what it does and it seem like a pain to use just mho
