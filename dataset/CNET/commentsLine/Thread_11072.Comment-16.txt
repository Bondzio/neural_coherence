just a shame it isn't more straightforward ... but dell isn't the box to get if you want to buy now with the idea of upgrading major components like cpus, psus, and video, etc., later.
can you do it ?
.

probably !
as it pertains to this upgrade, it would just a whole lot cleaner, better to know upfront exactly what's involved .. specifically the cpu and hs and the psu.
then at least you'd have all the parts and know what to expect.
i thought i had seen a mb diagram of the mb showing just a low-height small heasink without fan for this system but the links below inidcate the presence of a larger, taller hs (second link below).
not sure what combination of cpu and hs with or without fan might work on this configuration.
doubt if a retail cpu with hs and fan would fit under the shroud.
he could get an oem cpu and reuse the old hs ....just not sure if that's efficient enough to dissipate the heat generated by higher wattage cpu.
this much guessing makes me nervous.
good chatting with you on this.
