Will use one of the major brand [Dlink, LinkSys,...]a g [2.4GHz/5GHz] wireless router with 4 port switch and entry point. Want both frequencies. Want 5 GHZ but be able to fall back to 2.4 GHz for more range. Only two computers involved, but one is in a trailer on the other side of a wide paved driveway and handicapped parking area [a Municipal bldg for road maintenance trucks, graders et al], running cables would be too difficult.. We added a new function and employee but had no space for an office, thus the trailer LOL Telephone company refused to drop a phone line to it [says that PA law does not allow drops to two places on one property]. Thus his phone line comes into our building and we have the base station for a 2.4 GHz phone and he has an additional phone with charger. It works fine. [one reason I might need 5 GHz for the network, to prevent interference.] The router will sit in a window in the main building with a clear shot to the windows in the trailer. About 120 feet. If necesary the computer's location in the trailer can to optimized for the antenna on the PCI slot. [unless there are extension antennas]. Plenty of info on the 2.4 b or g units but not much on the a g . I know that there is a &quot;high&quot; gain antenna available for 2.4 but haven't seen one for 5 GHz. Any ideas and also recco's on which brands, based on experience???
