sorry but i did not realize in what forum i was in before i just started asking questions... well if you can help, that'll be awesome.. 15l x 13w x 9h room.
tv viewing distance about 10'.
if i'm watching tv; wall to the left, sliding glass door/wall on the rear, kitchen to the right(8' of open space), 2'wide wall next to kitchen leading to dining room(5' of open space).
any help would be appreciated..
