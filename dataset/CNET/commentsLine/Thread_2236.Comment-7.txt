i did end up upgrading my power supply.
however, i am still having problems running two monitors.
if i leave the hardware acceleration at ''full'' then i get both monitors going black, with the only recourse left is to reboot.
i have monitored the video card and cpu temperature and they are all in the normal range.
it varies from 15 minutes to several hours before it shuts off.
i have hibernate and all power saving turned off.
if i run just a single monitor, it seems to stay up longer, but even then i have had it lock up.
i tried setting the hardware acceleration to none and it ran for over 24 hours with no problem.
i'm now notching it back up one tick at a time.
i am now several hours into the second tick up from none.
has anyone else had these kinds of problems?
by the way, i already replaced the bfg geforce 7800 gt oc card once.
the second card exhibited the very same symptoms as the first.
is this a problem with the gateway, the video card, or an incompatibility between the two?
any ideas out there?
