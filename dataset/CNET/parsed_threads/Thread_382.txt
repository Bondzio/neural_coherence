<s> Does anyone have any information on an affordable, reasonably sized (64gb & up) solid state drive? </s>
<s> I am guessing you are deluged with information. </s>
<s> Maybe you are shopping for price and didn't say? </s>
<s> (and what country, etc.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Country is US and I'm looking for something in the sub-$200 area. </s>
<s> Yet, I'd probably just be using it as a hot-swap device on top of a desktop. </s>
<s> It would be nice to be of considerable size so that I could store my OS on it along with other items. </s>
<s> I could even go as low as 32gb possibly. </s>
<s> I just want something from a reliable company, but I also know that patience is a virtue with internal and external storage. </s>
<s> Let's pick any drive maker and even though they are a reliable company and made millions of drives, that doesn't make the drives any more reliable. </s>
<s> Let's read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive#Quality_and_performance That should help. </s>

<s> Pricing is a main factor in any SSD purchase, so don't expect a bargain soon. </s>
<s> In fact if you do, seriously reconsider the vendor. </s>
<s> A SSD will be fast, but some have proven not to last as long or be as problem free. </s>
<s> Many operate well, however when they do have a problem, they just up and die, no clue beforehand, via my experience. </s>
<s> So, pick a vendor or maker with a good warranty. </s>
<s> I have pointed to and many of the bigger vendors offer them: http://www.crucial.com http://www.kingston.com Beware of the several classes that refer to speed, size and/or data transfer rating, etc.. tada -----Willy </s>
