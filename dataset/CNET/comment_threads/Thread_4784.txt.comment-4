I have the 2ghz macbook with 158mb of ram ( still havent gotten around to updating it :P) and I think its a great computer..but since we're soo close to leopard being released maybe you should wait and see.
Things like &quot;Time Travel&quot; similar to the feature on windows computers is something really nice to have.
If you need a laptop for work now though, then dont hesitate, upgrade to leopard later.
