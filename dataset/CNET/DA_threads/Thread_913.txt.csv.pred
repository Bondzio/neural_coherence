1.1.1	http://www.bitssite.com/serial-ata-ide-100-133-convertor-adapter/6063/hard-driver-converter/accessory.html I recently bought this IDE to SATA Converter to use on a Maxtor Diamondmax 10 300GB HDD.	St
1.1.2	I connected it correctly, and also attached all the necessary cables.	St
1.1.3	However, the HDD won't show up in my BIOS.	St
1.1.4	Here is my setup: AMD Phenom X4 9650 ASUS M4N72-E Corsair XMS2 4GB (4 x 1GB) Western Digital 300GB HDD SATA Nvidia XFX GeForce 9800 Why isn't it working?	St
1.1.5	Can anyone help, please?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	If you are, the adapter spec.	St
1.3.2	doesn't say anything about that.	St
1.3.3	Some adapter can do that but don't know about this one.	St
1.3.4	Harddrive are cheap..get another ide.	St
1.3.5	Use the sata for data storage.	St
1.3.6	Good luck.	St
1.4.1	The HDD works.	St
1.4.2	I tried it on the IDE and it comes up, like it should.	St
1.4.3	However, I also have two disc drives: one dvd and the other dvd-rw.	St
1.4.4	Both use up the only IDE port I have.	St
1.4.5	My SATA drive is my boot drive.	St
1.5.1	Might have been better or easier to get an SATA optical drive or a PCI IDE-SATA controller.	St
1.5.2	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	I tried putting the adapter on one of my optical drives and that didn't work either.	St
1.6.2	I use both disc drives so I need them both active.	St
1.7.1	optical, get another controller (see link below) or get an external USB case and mount the IDE drive in that.	St
