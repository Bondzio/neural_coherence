took the power supply apart and on the circuit board i found a burnt dyote (sp?).
i turned the power supply on and it started smoking in that area.
that piece on the circiut i guess directions current into one direction only.
so hopefully it didn't damage other pieces.
there is only one other part that seemed like it got burnt a little from the dyote, but it seems to be fine.
this part will probably only cost me 2 dollars at radio shack, so hopefully it will solve the problem.
