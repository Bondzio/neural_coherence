I do suggest using a soft toothbrush and some alcohol, dip brush and gingerly brush the carriage contact area.
Wipe with a clean cloth or shop towel, leave no towel residue, repeat 2-3 times, allow to dry.
return ink cart, but you should wipe ink cart contacts as well.
test and check results.
best done with new ink cart.
If results are the same, possible bad carraige cable harness or electronics on logic(rare), in eiither case, the repair cost if no warranty will suggest buy new printer.
I thought any s/w issues if the test pattern HP uses fails.
