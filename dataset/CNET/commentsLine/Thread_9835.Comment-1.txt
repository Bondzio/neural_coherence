hi there.
it was recently brought to my attention that my computer will not boot up windows xp.
instead, i am prompted with a message saying something along the lines of &quot;system32 is missing or corrupted - please insert win xp disc to [try] repair file&quot;.
the problem is; my disc drive is buggered.
i can easily get a new one, but will the new disc drive work if win xp isn't booting up?
don't i need to install drivers?
how is that going to be possible?
thank you.
