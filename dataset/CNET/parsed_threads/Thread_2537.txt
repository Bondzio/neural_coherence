<s> I share my internet connection with my roommate who is very tech savvy. </s>
<s> I found out yesterday that he has been hacking into my gmail account and reading my emails. </s>
<s> I didn't think it was quite possible and I'm very surprised. </s>
<s> He manages the internet connection and has full access/control over it. </s>
<s> My question is what can I do to prevent him from accessing my information? </s>
<s> Does this mean he has my banking and credit card login information as well? </s>
<s> I thought those sites are safe and can't be hacked into. </s>
<s> Desperately need help. </s>
<s> What can I do from preventing this. </s>
<s> I have no privacy in my own house?? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP. </s>
<s> Besides, if it is your house, control the router and kick this off it. </s>
<s> It's your house, let them get their own internet if this is an issue. </s>

<s> I use https (gmail login is https) but that didn't help? </s>
<s> How did he get control off it? </s>
<s> I can kick him out but how do I know someone else isn't going to do the same thing? </s>
<s> Isn't there any secure way to access network without people having to snoop in to my email or bank/credit card accounts? </s>
<s> Someone mentioned getting VPN connection. </s>
<s> Is that secure? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I demo'd this for years for new IT staffers that would announce they secured our PCs or locked them down. </s>
<s> We would pull out the old Linux CD (today we use the USB stick version) to boot up, bypass all the security and get into the PC. </s>
<s> Leaving no trace we would leave. </s>
<s> I think we are going to repeat prior discussions about PC security and that physical access means I have full access to that PC, HD contents and more. </s>
<s> I can't guess which method they used. </s>
<s> It could have been as simple as FireSheep (see google). </s>
