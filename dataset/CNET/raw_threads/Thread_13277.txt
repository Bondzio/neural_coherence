729	0	48624	577611	NR	barrydunlevy	11/30/04 3:48 PM	1.10182968E12	Partitions (Hard Drive)	How do I change partitions identified as D,E,F,G,H,J,K,etc; to one hard drive letter &quot;C&quot;? My system says &quot;C&quot; drive is 98% full, but the partitons have plenty of memory.

Most programs offer the ability to install to a location of your choice. If you learn to use the option your problems will disappear.

The number of partitions mentioned seems strange. What are the sizes of the partitions? As mention in the other posts cut/paste your files to the other partitions. Displine yourself to place files and downloads on any partition other than C. Remember that H/D are prone to fail. Keep your data backed up. Bill .
