Not what we write to do in our forum sticky.
We found it causes network drop outs but who are we to give out advice that could stop owners from calling in hired help?
That is, please try it our way.
There is NO added security by hiding the SSID.
It's in each packet that's sent out so newer software will show the hidden ones.
Only those that stuck with what Windows uses will call it more secure.
You can used wired now, wireless cards can be added later.
