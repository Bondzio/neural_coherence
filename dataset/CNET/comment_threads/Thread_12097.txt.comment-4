I was so stupid, I didn't realize that the colors on the keystone jack were for the wires.
Well, thanks for helping me.
I am actually using one of the cables for the internet connection right now!
Now all I need is a gigabit router and some CAT6 keystone jacks and I'm ready to surf (as fast as my ISP allows, which is currently slower than CAT5e, but maybe some day .
