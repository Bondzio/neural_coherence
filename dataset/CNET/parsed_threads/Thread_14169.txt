<s> Ive been using my aunts macbook (1.83 core duo 512mb 667 ram, OS X 10.4.10) for a short time and Ive noticed (among other macs Ive used) that they are so unresponsive to my requests! </s>
<s> I would have to say that I have seen the spinning umbrella a lot when doing ordinary things on the macbook, but it seems so slow and unresponsive! </s>
<s> I personally have a dell laptop with a pentium M 2.13 cpu and it runs much faster than this macbook. </s>
<s> I know my notebook is faster in ghz, but this macbook has two cores, so it should multi task much better) I would like to know why macs are so slow! </s>
<s> Is it the OS? </s>
<s> Ram? </s>
<s> Something? </s>
<s> This is something that would prevent me from buying a macbook because of its inability to respond quickly without halting or freezing a lot. </s>
<s> Are there programs that allow me to tweak the performance settings on a mac to speed it up faster? </s>
<s> Like I said, if this could be fixed, I would consider buying a mac, but they are to sketchy is responsiveness at the moment. </s>
<s> is the normal cause of the spinning colored wheel along with an over full HD. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> It was just fine. </s>
<s> iTunes launched fast and was great overall. </s>
<s> Filling up the hard disk could be an issue or having many apps open with so little ram. </s>

<s> Your use of one Mac Laptop has led you to this dumb statement......Go to a Apple store, or Best Buy or whatever and give them a try.......I know you have not been to my house to try mine .....Give them a try....I have four PCs and two Macs..... </s>
<s> That wasnt very kind...anyways, my question is about how I can speed up a mac that is clearly slower. </s>
<s> Your mac may not be slow, but you probably know more about how to alleviate those symptoms than I do. </s>
<s> Therefore, I ask those that would kindly point me in the right direction... As for those that can help me, what causes them to be slow in the first place? </s>
<s> I know much more about PC's and I am able to tweak a PC with various tools and cleaners to get it optimal. </s>
<s> I do not know of many ways to speed up a mac and the like. </s>
<s> If anyone knows more on this subject, I would greatly appreciate help and not criticism on a subject that I am clearly trying to find the answer for. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your advise! </s>
<s> As you have described the macbook you are using as only having 512 mb of RAM... </s>
<s> I would suspect that this could be part of the problem. </s>
<s> You say you're familiar with windows machines. </s>
<s> How much performance would you expect from an XP or Vista box with only 512 mb of RAM? </s>
<s> There are several things you could do to help keep your aunts' macbook running smoothly. </s>
<s> One of the major maintenance procedures is repairing permissions using Disc Utility. </s>
<s> another would be to limit the amount of open programs you have running at any given time. </s>
<s> Another is to keep plenty of open room on your hard drive. </s>
<s> Bottom line however is the fact that you're not gonna get much from this computer with so little memory installed. </s>
<s> BTW... do us all a favor and go back and reread your original post. </s>
<s> Telling folks that their computer of choice sux in their own forum... informing us how much better a windows machine is... complaining some more... and then challenging us to persuade you to buy a mac... is pretty unreasonable public behavior. </s>
<s> I would suggest that if you really need help, then asking for it politely next time will get you the &quot;kind&quot; response you seem to have been expecting. </s>
<s> Even a zoned in, tranced out dude like you oughta know, if your throw an elbow in the middle of a trip hop rave and smack someone, then you oughta apologize instead of being surprised if you get elbowed back. </s>
<s> Ciao! </s>
<s> grim </s>
<s> Thank you for the response you gave me. </s>
<s> As you've mentioned about coming into a mac forum and complaining about macs and the like, it was obviously not my intention to step on anyones feelings about their macs. </s>
<s> Just like giving an elbow to a fellow raver and not meaning it, the struck raver shouldnt get too upset because it was not an evil intention. </s>
<s> The struck raver shouldnt exaggerate the events and make a mountain out of a mole hill. </s>
<s> The real problem is a misunderstanding of intentions. </s>
<s> If it was perceived that I wanted to challenge mac users, telling them that their macs sux, then I was obviously massively misunderstood. </s>
<s> I hope that you can understand my sincerity that I want to be educated and not get involved in a demeaning war. </s>
<s> Ive read forums about how other people bag on pcs (and are doing so incorrectly) but I kindly direct them to informative info so that they can fully understand the full picture. </s>
<s> I would assume that if it is the case that macs are very good machines, you would be able to set me straight (which you have attempted to do). </s>
<s> Hopefully there are no hurt feelings, but I would hope that the struck raver would initially &quot;think the best of another&quot; so that these &quot;fights&quot; dont emerge like they so often do. </s>
<s> So... </s>
<s> I apologize that there is always that level of misunderstanding and miscommunication that comes with language (especially over the internet). </s>
<s> Help me to love macs as you do and maybe I can be on the other side of the fence in the future. </s>
<s> have a great day! </s>
<s> btw, im a fellow raver... havent been to one in a while, but Im glad to hear that there are others here that enjoy those things! </s>
<s> Although I prefer industrial over trance (check out &quot;PORCELAIN and the tramps&quot; for a rocking underground time) we can all be forgiving on the dance floor when we take a look at where the other folk are standing, and respect their space. </s>
<s> Like I said, try the Disc Utility in the Finder window &gt; Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Disc Utility path. </s>
<s> Select the main hard drive in the side bar and click on repair permissions at the bottom of the window. </s>
<s> If you see a whole big list of repairs being made, then it might indicate that this small regular maintenance has been neglected. </s>
<s> Repairing permissions is akin to defraging/registry clean up (but different)... and can make a rough running mac act like a new machine. </s>
<s> Bottom line however, is a machine with so little RAM isn't going to run too well. </s>
<s> A gig of RAM, minimum is needed to run video applications smoothly. </s>
<s> cheers grim </s>
