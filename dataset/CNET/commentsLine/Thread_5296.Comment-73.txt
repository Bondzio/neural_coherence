i don't know if this is going to be a direct enough answer to your question but i recently had a 3.5 year old dell laptop that passed on.
i put in a new new hard drive and all was well for two weeks.
next, the video card died.
unfortunately, it was an integrated video card & i was told by dell & other local repair shops that they didn't even want to take on the task.
that said, my feeling is that if you can opt for a better or optional video card it won't be an integrated card.
in closing, i've never been able to get much more than 3 or 4 years life out of a laptop & i've had most all of the brands.
sure wish that some day someone will make something designed to last.
