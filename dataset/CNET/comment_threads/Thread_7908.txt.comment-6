I would also use the onboard sound and divert the savings to other components, but I was thinking that koolman51 seems to value high quality or enhanced music and sound.
If it's a choice between the Xmod and an X-Fi card, I choose the X-Fi card if they are similarly priced.
Maybe koolman51 can shed some light on what he wants out of this system?
