<s> Much has been talked about AMD Athlon64 and Intel Pentium 4 series. </s>
<s> When it comes to gaming or extreme graphics, people say go AMD but when it comes to encoding or digital media they say go Intel's way. </s>
<s> This is a common concept now embedded in our minds but is all that true. </s>
<s> I mean most of us, when we want to purchase a new PC want an all rounder PC capable doing all that stuff. </s>
<s> Someone please help the majority of ill-informed people. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> for everyone who knows nothing. </s>
<s> Just what is a eMachine? </s>
<s> Stop advertising for crapola computers... -_- Seriously, it doesn't matter. </s>
<s> The gap between processors isn't nearly as much as some of these hardcore gamers would like you to think. </s>
<s> If it's top performance you want, either AMD or Pentium is fine. </s>
<s> If it's value, get Celeron. </s>
<s> Compared to AMD and Pentium processors running at the same speed, it's much cheaper. </s>
<s> for the price of a celeron, you can get an athlon 64 in the t6212. </s>
<s> emachines are not crap, they're an oem i would consider for ppl who don't know/want to build their own. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> emachines are kick ass computers, u can turn the t6212 in a formidable super computer (exagerating). </s>
<s> i really dont think the path you choose whether it be amd or intel really make a difference, they each have certain tasks that they can finish faster than the other. </s>
<s> AMD obviously beats intel in gaming, but does that mean that people with intel cpus cant play intense pc games? </s>
<s> the answer is NO. </s>
<s> so what if an amd will get a few more fps in a game, big woop. </s>
<s> intel is extremely good at multitasking, i never see any amd fans mention this ever, because they know that intel is the most advance cpu that can multitask efficiently. </s>
<s> but now that dual cores are out, its a little more even, except the dual cores with hyper threading with each core, similiar to have 4 cpus. </s>
<s> the like wise is for amd. </s>
<s> intel is great at video editing and what not, but does that mean that amd cpus cant do that? </s>
<s> NO, intel will just perform these tasks slightly faster. </s>
<s> so my big answer is, what ever cpu you choose whether it be intel or amd, can perform the exact same task that the other is either better at or weaker at. </s>
<s> now im off to play the bf2 demo on my INTEL p4 3ghz machine konny </s>
<s> I just took a look at the specs, and it's hardly strong. </s>
<s> First of all, 512Mb of ram is hardly enough for modern systems. </s>
<s> Secondly, Ati X200 isn't exactly top of the line. </s>
<s> A lot of AGP cards with better performance are available for cheaper. </s>
<s> 3rd, what kind of monitor is included in the $629.99 package? </s>
<s> The reviews even listed &quot;mediocre&quot; gaming performance as a low. </s>
<s> I build my current machine for around $600. </s>
<s> That's including a $250 17&quot; LCD monitor, and a year ago. </s>
<s> Things are just a bit more expensive back then. </s>
<s> And I'm pretty sure it can outperform that thing. </s>
<s> with upgrades it'll be good. </s>
<s> also u said 512 mb ram isnt enough...i have to disagree.... also yes the integrated gfx suks but if u put in any pci-express gfx card you'll c an improvement. </s>
<s> cept not really junk gfx cards usually cost like 550 at circuit city or compusa with a crt monitor and a printer. </s>
<s> &quot;512Mb of ram is hardly enough for modern systems&quot; -Um 512MB is more than adequate, and you will find 512MB in most of the computer systems sold today. </s>
<s> The minimum requirement for Windows XP is 128MB. </s>
<s> In more pricey systems the 1GB is popular and 2GB is just overkill. </s>
<s> In fact, having alot of RAM can slow the performance of your computer down and 512MB is known as the &quot;sweet-spot&quot; for many computers today. </s>
<s> &quot;Secondly, Ati X200 isn't exactly top of the line.&quot; -Secondly it's not supposed to be top of the line, its a budget computer system!! </s>
<s> However it is certainly better than many other integrated graphics out there that you would get with a budget computer. </s>
<s> &quot;3rd, what kind of monitor is included in the $629.99 package?&quot; -A 15in. </s>
<s> LCD Monitor is included in that package from Bestbuy which is $629.99 after $330.00 in rebates. </s>
<s> -Also the Emachines is very popular because it is easily upgradable as John Robie highlights in this post: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=101999&messageID=1175501 &quot;The T6212 caught on for gamers (and others) mainly because of the features it has for the price. </s>
<s> It has a fairly powerful processor, the Athlon 64 3200, which has the 64-bit support for the future, AMD's better socket 939 which usually doesn't come with inexpensive computers (I don't know of any), a motherboard which has a PCI-Express x16 video card slot allowing for upgrade of the Integrated on board grahics. </s>
<s> The new PCI-Express (PCIe) video cards are the future slowly replacing the more expensive AGP cards. </s>
<s> A 160GB hard drive, 512MB of RAM (memory), 17&quot; monitor and printer are also a plus for an inexpensive computer...&quot; -What are the specs of your $600 built computer? </s>
<s> I'm curious. </s>
<s> My specs: 2.6Ghz Celeron 1GB ram, PC3200 128MB Radeon 9600 2 HDs, 40GB 5900rpm, 160GB 7200rpm 2 CDROMs, 52x CDRW, 8x DVDRW 17&quot; LG LCD monitor The old 300watts power supply and 40GB harddrive are salvaged from my last computer, and don't cost extra. </s>
<s> But still, you have to remember, this was build a year ago. </s>
<s> Maybe things are just a bit more expensive then? </s>
