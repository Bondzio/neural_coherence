<s> Hi, Having done as much research as seems possible on the internet, I'd appreciate some input to help choose between these color laser printers: - Xerox Phaser 6500DN - Konica Minolta Magicolor 3730DN - HP Color LaserJet CP3525dn - Epson AcuLaser C3900DN - Lexmark C734dn Anybody with experience of using any of them? </s>
<s> Please post positive / negative views, especially re reliability issues and hidden / unexpected costs. </s>
<s> Some background info Currently a SOHO user, expanding in one years time to small business of 3+ people who will share the printer. </s>
<s> Main use is printing duplexed A4 high quality flyers as well as teaching materials; these include (some colored) text, graphs and photographic content. </s>
<s> Other (smaller) sizes and heavier weights of paper are occasionally printed. </s>
<s> I already have an OKI B6200 laser printer with duplexer for plain B/W printing. </s>
<s> Main criteria + budget of &#8364;350-&#8364;700 + text, graphic and photo printing must be as close to excellent as possible (for a laser) - slower print speeds are acceptable if not extreme - higher printing costs acceptable within reason Thnx in advance for any comments on these printers, or even for other printers that you think might fit the bill. </s>
<s> All the color lasers are nice but your spec makes me think you are not going to be happy with laser color printing. </s>
<s> There's only one way to settle that. </s>
<s> Get some output in your hands. </s>

<s> Yes, samples of course will help with print quality issues, but what I'm really after is insight into reliability issues or hidden running costs which samples won't show me. </s>
<s> Life span is about 2 years till you may need repairs or an expensive part. </s>
<s> I know of no hidden running costs. </s>
<s> All the printers I looked at years ago gave expected pages for the drum, fuser and such. </s>
<s> HOWEVER the real costs soar when folk do full page color prints. </s>
<s> Most of the page counts are for 5% coverage. </s>
<s> You can do the math if you move to 100% coverage. </s>
