Interestingly enough your computer shipped with four different models of motherboards, so the motherboard model sure helped.
Before purchasing, please confirm you have two RAM slots and not four, just in case.
If that is correct, you can install a 1GB stick of RAM if you like, with no need to remove the 512MB, bumping it up to 1.5GB.
You could likewise just insert another 512MB stick to reduce the cost, totaling 1GB.
As to PC3200 vs PC2700, the higher the number the faster it is, generally speaking.
You can safely mix-and-match PC3200 with PC2700, which results in all RAM running at the slower of the speeds.
Ideally you'd want all PC3200, but it's better to have 1.5GB running as PC2700 than 1GB running as PC3200.
Hope this helps, John
