I getting a used 2800+ 333 of ebay.
I know its not the latest.
But it is 333mhz.
My board will take it.
But I'm still using 266 ram.
I forget do I have to get 333 ram?
Or can I use the 2 512mb 2100 266 ram I have?
It'll be a little bit slower.
But will it still work or do I have to get 333 ram?
Or I can under clock.
The bios allows me to set the cpu at 100, 133, or 166.
Don't know if under clocking is safe.
I know overclocking is not but under clocking?
