1.1.1	Please let me know what you think ...	Sug
1.1.2	I am ordering the adaptec card to run raid 5 with 4 hdd ( ordered 5 in case one dies ) [ IMG ] http : //s15.postimage.org/ddn9g8xm3/My_Home_Server.jpg [ /IMG ]	St
1.2.1	My only caveat is that you did n't use a & quot ; redundant & quot ; power server case .	St
1.2.2	Everything else appears OK , too .	St
1.2.3	As for the case , that PSU will do , but here too you may want to have a spare PSU .	St
1.2.4	Now , make darn sure all of this is well cooled , which a server case would have provided and have amble room as well .	St
1.2.5	Just check out server cases to get a feel of what I 'm suggesting here .	Sug
1.2.6	I do like 100 % you use a true server mtrbd.. tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Is raid 5 for the OS and data fine ?	Ques
1.3.2	I will be installing the OS on raid 5 then I will be using windows to partiton a new storage & quot ; drive & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	is this fine to do ?	Ques
1.3.4	?	Ques
1.4.1	of the system that supports it ?	Ques
1.4.2	Does the system store only family PICs , tax records or is it used for business and earning a living too ?	Ques
1.4.3	The question is ... what level of redundancy and backup are you looking for ?	Ques
1.4.4	What if the system was hit by voltage spikes , lightning , flood , tornado , etc. , ?	Ques
1.4.5	RAID 5 and having a spare HDD is great but but you may need to think beyond that if you want ensure system availability , data access and continuity of business .	St
1.4.6	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels The above link should provide an idea of the RAID levels on what they do .	St
1.5.2	RAID 5 is the robust but still you need the care of a *master backup* to include other back-ups on a regular basis .	St
1.5.3	While RAID 5 provides for its own data safety , the world still makes it rough at times , thus backups are more than a good idea .	St
1.5.4	On top of all this the master backup I suggested is for return a working network if a major failure comes about , you can restart again , reloading the basic network and then using whatever other backups to return to some date of last backup. , etc..	St
1.5.5	I mention this only if all else fails , you have something to return to .	St
1.5.6	While i did n't suggested before you may want to look at MS Home Server 2011 or similar to better handle network demands .	St
1.5.7	While Win7 will provide for a decent networking setup it becomes a more stretched use of the OS .	St
1.5.8	Home Server OS , provides a ready OS to better handle the demands of networking , just a thought to pass on .	St
1.5.9	I also suggest you get your hands on & quot ; networking s/w tools & quot ; that are capable of networking needs .	Sug
1.5.10	I mention this just as method to make life easier , though you have to find this out by trail and error what suits you .	St
1.5.11	Google away for such tools and there are freebies or low-cost ones .	St
1.5.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	I use a simple NAS and for more speed and a second copy a low power 10 Watt Netbook .	St
1.6.2	About 20 Watts for both .	St
