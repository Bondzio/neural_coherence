<s> hey everybody, i'm looking for some help regarding the free slimdriver software i downloaded from this site. </s>
<s> i have a dell laptop with windows seven that has been acting up. </s>
<s> sometimes a message saying there was a driver error and it restarts itself automatically. </s>
<s> i thought i would try and use the slimdriver software but when i installed it, it completely crashed my computer. </s>
<s> it will not turn back on. </s>
<s> when i try it brings up start up repair which runs for hours and then states it can not automatically fix the problem. </s>
<s> i tried doing a system restore however after it runs it says it was unable to complete the action. </s>
<s> any ideas or suggestions?? </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> Driver finders and such can't find all known drivers or even the right ones. </s>
<s> Registry cleaners, driver cleaners are also in that boat. </s>
<s> So yes, it can mess up a working system but &quot;harm&quot;? </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> The hardware has yet to be harmed by such things. </s>
<s> ABOUT SYSTEM RESTORE. </s>
<s> Too many causes from your antivirus choice to malware to registry cleaners to other. </s>
<s> It is not reliable enough for you to count on so you use the age old system of backup of what you can't lose. </s>
