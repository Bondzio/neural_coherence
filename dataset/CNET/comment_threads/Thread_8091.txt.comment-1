In reading various articles I'm more confused on what to buy than ever.
My family gets in the internet, used MS Office, does some minor playing around with pictures, really just simple basic stuff.
I'm looking for a recommendation on a low end computer desktop (box only) to buy.
Does anyone have a suggestion on what to get that fits this user description?
We'd like to be in the sub-$600 range too.
Thanks all, Mark
