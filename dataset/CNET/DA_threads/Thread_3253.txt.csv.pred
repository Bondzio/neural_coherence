1.1.1	First off I did not realise a DVD drive used two lasers to read either DVD and normal CD Rom + Music disks .	St
1.1.2	How long should a DVD or other Optical drive last ?	Ques
1.1.3	My drive still plays all my music CDs and can read CD Roms but it will not read any of my movies any more .	St
1.1.4	All they do is spin the drive up and then it says there is & quot ; no disk in drive. & quot ; Drive is about 14 months old .	St
1.1.5	Is this how long these things are meant to last these days ?	Ques
1.2.1	Some machines will get months , others years .	St
1.2.2	The deciding factor I 'm seeing is how hot it is inside the computer case .	St
1.2.3	While many owners learn about CPU temperatures they often neglect cooling for other parts .	St
1.2.4	A year may be typical for a box where the drive is a bit warm .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	A few yrs .	St
1.3.2	ago many a CD drive would last longer and the reason is the speed factor .	St
1.3.3	As drives become more speed-X they have little room for error and & quot ; settledown & quot ; time is nil and quickly errors out .	St
1.3.4	However , a basic CD drive is darn cheap nowadays and reflects that , but quality still matters and usually will last longer excludes any other factor .	St
1.3.5	DVD drives by default are more demanding and quite easily get tossed early after normal wear & tear .	St
1.3.6	My rule of thunb upon hearing a drive going bad , is it at least 1yr .	St
1.3.7	and used often , then you got your money 's worth if brought with the system .	St
1.3.8	Plus , now you have the & quot ; combo drives & quot ; which just allows more possibilites of having a problem , so there you go .	St
1.3.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	You guys wo n't believe this but just today I put a DVD into the drive and it WORKED ! ! !	St
1.4.2	I fell of my seat almost literally .	St
1.4.3	I think I have solved the problem of why it did not work when I first mentioned this on Monday .	St
1.4.4	The drive has drive belts inside that spin the disk .	St
1.4.5	I am not sure what the belts are made of but they seem to be a bit greasy to the touch and sometimes the drive wo n't spin properly when the disk is inside it.. DVD disks spin at a higher speed then normal CD or CD Rom and I suspect that all this fuss might be due to the crap quality of the drive belts and this & quot ; greasy & quot ; substance that builds up on them ... ...
