i recently built my new pc and changed most of stock stuff.
the cpu fan - thermaltake.
moved the internal fans where they would blow sensibly.
left the side off.
had overheating problems.
my temp readings when nothing was running was 109f cpu mobo 94f the hd's were hot to the touch as were some of the mobo chips.
had some doom3 lockups.
went to walmart - 9.95 fan - put it next to the pc.
(small desk - printer is next to pc - fan between ) cpu now at 92f and mobo 79f and the tracking during quake 4 shows only an increase of approx 8 to 10 deg on both.
now my problem is that the fan is too close to the pc.
the motor creates a mag field and is picked up by the vid card (asus ax850xt 256mb) and the upper left corner of my monitor has a pulse like a bad florescent light - but only slightly.
turn off fan and it stops.
so am trying to figure a way to move the fan or block the mag field - may try a grounded wire mesh .
just dont have much room to move stuff.
sooo... try a large desktop fan.
will drop your temps a lot.
hd's are running cooler too.
