rather recently i have discovered my hard drive &quot;buzzing&quot; rather loudly.
i have been using this computer that i built along with this hard drive for well over three months now (the hard drive is roughly a year or more old and the additional parts are over a year old but i put these pieces together about 5 months ago) and am just now starting to hear this noise.
it seems to happen when the hard drive is more active, though it's buzzing has increased.
i have my computer sitting open and can tell it is the hard drive due to the fact that when i move it, the noise changes slightly.
i have it currently sitting on one end (&quot;face&quot; down, perpendicular to the way it normally would sit) simply because for whatever reason, it quiets down that way.
i have noticed a definite decrease in functionality with my computer but i have also managed to get a small string of viruses (so i was planning on formatting it anyways - thank god i already have it backed up) so i'm not sure if it's really the hard drive going bad that is causing the slower system.
if anyone has any suggestions, i would love them.
i've attempted to look up this problem on google but really didn't find much information.
