i will try the solder as practice if i buy another mobo.
thank you for the info.
i will call compaq and make sure of the mobo.
there were no cd's but i used pc tools to create a compaq recovery cd which i have used on 4 hd's while testing.
but all were on this mobo.
all the pinouts were removed from the sony dvd to allows cable select but i will test again with slave selected in the pin out.
thanks for all the tips.
