There are so many choices out there and I'm a noob anyway so I would like some suggestions. I need a motherboard that can handle games like Age of Empires 2, Blood Bowl, Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, and other similar games. I don't think I particularly need a gaming computer but I want something reliable and capable to get me through college. Any feedback would be appreciated thanks.

I like to see the i5 CPU as you surely have read the following. &quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. &quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html With the motherboard and CPU out of the way, I like to pick a video card from this list. -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html Bob
