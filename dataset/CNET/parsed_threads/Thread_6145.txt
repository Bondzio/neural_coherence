<s> i have a dell Dimension xps t550 computer that was given to me. </s>
<s> it had windows 2000 pro on it. </s>
<s> the person who gave it to me had put a administrator password on it, but forgot the password. </s>
<s> so i wanted to install windows xp pro and it wouldn't let me. </s>
<s> i tried everything...i ended up putting the HD from the Dell in another computer and installed windows xp pro. </s>
<s> everything went smooth...when i put the HD back into the Dell and fired it up.. i get an error that says that &quot;the hardrive is corrupted or the IDE contollers are messed up. </s>
<s> it tells me to go to A:\chkdsk /F...any ideas out there? </s>
<s> it put all of the data related to the computer and it's parts on it. </s>
<s> When you reformatted all of that data was lost. </s>
<s> The Dell system is looking for the data at the location that they keep it on the drive [probably a hidden partition], therefore it assumes that the drive is corrupted. </s>
<s> Replacing or reformatting a drive on a proprietary computer, Dell, Compaq, Gateway, HP, et al always creates this problem. </s>
<s> The don't give one the Op Sys CD they give a CD that can format et al the way that they want [it has the cab files on it, but some of the cabs are modified to Dell's desires. </s>
<s> All of the correct drivers are also on that CD. </s>
<s> Compaq has the access to the BIOS on the Hard drive, not sure about Dell. </s>
<s> You may be able to go to the Dell website to find out how to recover from this. </s>
<s> The Donor of the computer should have given you Dell's restore/recovery CD. </s>
