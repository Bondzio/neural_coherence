1.1.1	Hi Everyone , I have been given a Toshiba Satellite L30 - 101 lap top which I have been told if I can fix it I can keep it .	St
1.1.2	The laptop has a broken screen so every time it is switched on most of the screen is covered in black and all you can see is the surrounding parts .	St
1.1.3	What I would like to know is if there is any way that this can be fixed without replacing the screen ?	Ques
1.1.4	I hav n't managed to do anything other then connect it to an external monitor which is not practical for what I need it for and search online for a new screen , a new screen is very expensive so if I can fix it that would be amazing .	St
1.1.5	If anyone knows if this is possible it 's you guys as you have helped me a lot over the past few months with other computer problems Thanks all Paul	St

1.4.1	If there 's evidence of physical damage , you have no option but to replace the damaged part .	St
1.4.2	If there is no backlight , it 's the CCF tube or it 's high voltage supply .	St
1.4.3	You can replace the power supply component quite easily .	St
1.4.4	This is often called and inverter and should got for 30 to 50 bucks .	St
1.4.5	If the CCF tube is bad , it 's usually embedded in to screen assembly and you change the screen .	St
1.4.6	There is also a ribbon cable that passes from the screen to the main board .	St
1.4.7	These flex and can break .	St
1.4.8	They are sometimes part of the screen assembly and not detachable so you replace the screen .	St
1.4.9	If you go the screen route , you will want the manufacturer 's part number as these vary from machine to machine and model to model within the family .	St
1.4.10	It should be somewhere on the back of the screen .	St
1.4.11	You 'll need some precision tools , skill to use them and some patience to figure out how to get these off without doing further damage .	St
1.4.12	Your comfort level with doing this is important .	St
1.4.13	To have this done by one in the business of doing so will cost at least 3x what it will cost to do it yourself .	St
