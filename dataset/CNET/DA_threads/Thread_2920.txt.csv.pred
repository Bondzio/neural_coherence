1.1.1	I am not sure where to post this.	St
1.1.2	I am looking for IBM compatible PS2 type keyboard that uses 120mA power consumtion or less.	St
1.1.3	What is exactly is that type of keyboard.	St
1.1.4	I looked online to see if I could find one but nothing lists the power consumption.	St
1.1.5	Any help will be appreciated.	St
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	But no one specs that anymore so you'll have to measure a few to see what they do.	St
1.2.2	It's all of one measurement with an ammeter.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	What a bummer So you are saying it is just hit and miss?	St
1.3.2	I will tell you what I am using it for, I have to enter disc info on my mega DVD player and it requires that type of keyboard I already have one for my computer and it doesn't work.	St
1.3.3	Let me ask you would the ones without all of the multimedia buttons be a good start to check?	St
1.4.1	That's a little clearer.	St
1.4.2	I wonder why you didn't share the make/model of this thing to start with.	St
1.4.3	You could have helped members help you without all the back and forths.	St
1.4.4	Yup, I'd try a &quot;plain&quot; keyboard.	Sug
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Sorry but I thought I mentioned that because the keyboard that didn't work with my new Sony DVD player worked with my older Sony cd player and they both specified the same keyboard.	St
1.5.2	I was confused about that.	St
1.5.3	It was a important point.	St
1.5.4	A pre senior moment on my part.	St
1.6.1	It's one of those little bits of information that could have someone write they have it and use some specific keyboard.	St
