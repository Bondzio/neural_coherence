Hi, I'm running Vista on my new laptop, and trying to connect to my family's secured wireless network.
It won't connect unless I reboot the router while my laptop is up and running.
If the connection is interrupted for any reason, including turning off or hibernating the laptop, I can't get back on unless I unplug the router and plug it back in again.
Two other computers on the network, 1 XP and 1 Vista, have no trouble establishing connection at all.
Has anyone heard of this problem before, and if so, how do I fix it?
