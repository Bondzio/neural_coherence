I have a netgear 108mbps super g router, it has worked great with my laptop.
I have just purchased a HP desktop dualcore AMD 64x2 4600+, which runs xp media and want to connect to my wireless network.
Any suggestions if I should get a pci card or usb adapter?
I have read reviews for Netgear and they weren't too favorable.
Can I use another brand or will I suffer compatability problems
