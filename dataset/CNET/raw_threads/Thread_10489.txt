12233	0	35221	407167	NR	pdhartog	8/31/04 7:00 PM	1.0939788E12	Missing Memory	I've got a 1GB HP PAV Processor and am supposed to have 128MB of SDRAM only 92 MB show up on the Performance Tab. Any ideas where my memory has gotten to? I've tried shutting down down drivers one at a time to find a change.....no dice.

In some cases you can +/- that value to suit your needs. It then either uses some vendor utility or the setting value in the bios. You can't defeat it, if you continue to use the build-in video. Otherwise, if capable get a video card that directly installs and uses it own ram. You needn't woryy about it and you add more ram if you have available ram slots open -OR- swap out the ram for a larger mb size in its place. Hope this helps... good luck -----Willy
