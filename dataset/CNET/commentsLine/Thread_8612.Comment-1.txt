i have a media center pc with a tv tuner card and an ati radeon x600 pro graphics card.
i also have a 19&quot; lcd flat panel display.
my question is if i use an hd tuner box from comcast for my cable tv and i run the coaxial cable into the pc, will i be able to watch hdtv through the media center app?
