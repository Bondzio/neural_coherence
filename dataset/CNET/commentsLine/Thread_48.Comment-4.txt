the best computer they've ever owned but, by then, it's yesterday's news.
pc technology changes too rapidly.
i was being a bit facetious about the credit card but not about the expert resource.
why anyone would think some anonymous person in tech forums would have a better answer than a reliable builder who has done this over and over is something i cannot understand.
you can peruse these many help forums for bits and pieces of information if it's your intention to build this machine yourself but if your intention is to have the fastest/strongest in the world you need to know that should that objective be met you will be the champion for no more than a few seconds.
