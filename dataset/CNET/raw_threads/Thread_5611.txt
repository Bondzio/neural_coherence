Tried all three usb ports. Since then none of them work. Tried a usb memory stick and a usb wireless adapter. The computer freezes and requires a hard boot. I did a system restore back to a week ago. Same problem. I updated the bios. Same problem. I took the battery out of the laptop and left it unplugged overnight. Same problem. I wiped the connectors of the usb devices before plugging them in. Same problem. I uninstalled the usb controllers in Device Manager. Drivers reinstalled and the same problem. No question marks in Device Manager. Any suggestions? System specs: HP dv5130us laptop XP Media Center w/SP2 AMD Turion ML-37 2 GB RAM

Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=271360&messageID=2699006#2699006 and notice that HP may hide the drivers we are looking for off the main site. You make the call.

I have done everything drivers, bios and chipset wise that I could short of just totally wiping the OS and starting fresh. That shouldn't be necessary. I was looking @ some of the POST motherboard test cards. Any thoughts?

Said &quot;Port 1 reset error - 110.&quot; &quot;hub_port_status failed (error - 32).&quot; &quot;Cannot enable port 1. Maybe the usb cable is bad?&quot; I'm not a Linux person (headed in that direction though) so I'm just guessing that it's saying that there's a problem with the usb ports (tested all 3, same result). Any other opinions?

That's it. I checked Component Services in Administrative Tools. The &quot;Universal Plug and Play Device Host&quot; is running and set to start automatically. I plugged a usb wireless adapter in and the system shut down again.
