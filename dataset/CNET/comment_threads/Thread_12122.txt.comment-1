Sorry if my question is stupid, but I currently use a cable modem and am interested in networking my other two computers in order to have access to the internet on all 3.
I called my provider and they made it sound as simple as buying a wirless router and hooking it up to my cable modem and that that is all I have to do.
My question is, Is it that simple?
Do I only have to by a router and install it to have access for the other two?
Any help you could offer would be great!!!!
Thanks, Steve
