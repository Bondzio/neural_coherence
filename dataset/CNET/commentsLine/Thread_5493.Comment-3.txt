hi i have got into my hard drive by hooking it up to my laptop through a usb to sata cable to retrieve my data but password permission makes it inaccesable how do i get my data back?
thanks originally had a problem boot config data booot\bcd status 0x000000f but i want to get my data before i reformat the hard drive as i tried running the master cd and i tried non destructive recovery wicj didnt work so i wanr to get my data off off before i reformat (i will be backing up from now on lesson learnt!)
