mayvbe you could temporarily hook the drive up to that one, and use a win 98 boot floppy or the hitachi diagnostics??
i made a post asking robert proffitt to check this thread.
you probably won't hear from him until tomorrow eastern time.
i work tomorrow, but will look in a little from there but have not much to offer.
i have one that i would like call to check with, but she has gone to bed.
i don't remember if a win98 boot disk has scandisk on it and whether you could run a thorough scan from it [if you had a computer with a floppy].
seems that things are pointing to some kind of drive problem.
this is one of the times that a floppy drive can be a big help, even though they are virtually not used anymore.
but one can get them for $10 and they sure can come in handy at a time like this.
