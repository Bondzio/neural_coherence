Well, I finally was able to get to it.
I unhooked the modem from router and disabled all the firewalls on all the computers (Windows firewalls as well).
The computers still showed to be connected to the router, but when I tried the NEW VIEW, it still gave me the message that there was no list.
I also tried just using 2 computers on the network and got nothing.
Do you have any other suggestions?
Thanks Raymon
