Even at trade shows.
As to cooling, a laptop cooling pad may be today's answer.
And while I've found SATA PC-Cards and USB 2.0 cards, none have &quot;active cooling&quot; so the only hope is the cooling pad.
The e on ESATA stands for external which is by nature of being a PC-Card will be automatic.
Therefore you just need to get a SATA card and you're done.
To get the USB 2.0 card and SATA to fit in the 2 slots you'll have to pay a bit more for those USB 2.0 cards built with dongles.
Sorry, I will not search for these products for you but have in the past and they are still available in the US.
