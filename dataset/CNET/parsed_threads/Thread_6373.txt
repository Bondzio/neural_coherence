<s> I have a compaq presario, mv540, operating system is Window Mil One day when I was playing a game, Reading Blaster, with my 4 yr old son I heard a shattering sound and the computer froze, I opened the cd drive and the cd literally shattered into hundreds of pieces and the cd rom has not worked ever since. </s>
<s> So I use the CD burner to run cd's. </s>
<s> Now the cd drive will not even open. </s>
<s> There is nothing in the drive but I push the button and nothing happens. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Small pieces of plastic can lodge in the gears. </s>
<s> Either take apart yourself and clean it out or get a new one (recommended). </s>
<s> Since the speed of a drive is quite fast, an electronic component could also have been damaged. </s>
<s> Replace it. </s>
<s> CD drives are 20 bucks or less. </s>
<s> Good luck, Telephony facts, analog/digital explained. </s>

<s> A lot of drives have a small hole in the front just big enough for a paper clip wire. </s>
<s> That's exactly what the hole if for...to manually open the drive. </s>
<s> You do so by pushing straight in the hole with enough force to lift the heads up and start the door to open. </s>
<s> I might guess the drive belt that operates the door is damaged or off the pulley. </s>
<s> When this happens you hear the drive try but it just cannot open. </s>
<s> To manually pop open a cd drive, take a small pin or a small safety pin (open), or a very thin paper clip, unfolded, and insert it into the tiny little hole located somewhere on the cd drive's face. </s>
<s> Look carefully, almost every cd-rom/writer drive has one for opening the drive manually. </s>
<s> When you locate the hole, press the pointed object into the hole carefully, while at the same time, pressing the button you press to pop open the cd drive normally. </s>
<s> It should pop open, no problem. </s>
<s> I hope this helps. </s>
<s> (the exploding cd in drive has happened to me too, I feel your pain...) </s>
<s> Thank you so much for this advice! </s>
<s> Our E drive was stuck shut and after reading this thread, I used a CAKE TESTER to open it. </s>
<s> I could see that the belt was broken. </s>
<s> I just cant wait to show my hubby who sat here for an hour trying to fix it! </s>
<s> LOL </s>
<s> Dear friends, the main question was the drive did not respond and there was no CD in the drive. </s>
<s> It could be the mechanical problem but in this case I feel its the power supply problem or a dead drive. </s>
<s> If you could see a light on the drive when u press a button or when you start the system, then it could be a mechanism problem or a faulty drive. </s>
<s> if you dont see any light at any time then the problem is with the power supply to the drive or a dead drive. </s>
<s> Just open the chasis and check for the connections or try with a free power cord. </s>
<s> Hope this is useful. </s>
<s> reply if it works.. </s>
