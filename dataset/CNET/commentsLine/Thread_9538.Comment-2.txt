about all you can do is check to make sure the connections are good.
you have have wiring from the front ports to the mb header.
remove the connectors and plug them back in.
make sure the pins in the connectors are fully seated as well.
pulled pins are notorious for causing connection failures.
i have had usb ports go bad and i suspect due to static discharge.
when this happened to me, however, the ports didn't disappear but showed as having a problem.
good luck.
