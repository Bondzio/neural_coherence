<s> the left button </s>
<s> what you are doing is squeezing the mouse when you press the left button and activating Expos. </s>
<s> There are two ways to fix this problem: 1. </s>
<s> Try to relax when using the mouse and be careful how you lift it to a different place on your desk/table/whatever. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Turn off button 4 (the side buttons) by going to the System Preferences &gt; Keyboard & Mouse &gt; Mouse Tab and choosing OFF from the drop down menu for the side button. </s>
<s> You can also turn on the Right button and use it as a Secondary button for bringing up contextual menus when you click it. </s>
<s> Things like Copy, Paste, New Folder, Get info, etc., if you have not already done so. </s>
<s> Does that solve your problem? </s>
