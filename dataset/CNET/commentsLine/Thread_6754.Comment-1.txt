i have been having problems with my hp pavilion dv5220us laptop for over a year.
it has windows xp, service pack 2, 1.60ghz, intel centrino duo mobile, intel core duo processor, 1.6hz, 2mb, 120 gb hard drive.
since i bought it in august 2006 it has had problems off and on.
i bought it at circuit city & thank goodness i paid for the extended warranty for 2 years.
in the past year the hard drive failed and had to be replaced.
the main problem i have been having for over a year is that i can be on the laptop doing something not related to the internet and all of a sudden the blue light for the wireless will go out.
it will also go out everytime i take the laptop to another room in my house.
it also goes out when i'm not even on the computer.
when this happens i go to network connections and it doesn't even show an icon for a wireless network.
the wireless connection eventually comes back on all on its own, sometimes it's 30 minutes or up to several hours.
sometimes restarting the computer will work but not always.
i have taken the laptop to circuit city twice for this issue and it still keeps happening.
i have also chatted on-line with hp about this issue and they have had me re-install the drivers and do a bios update.
circuit city said yesterday that i can return the laptop and that they will give me another laptop with the same specs and that the laptop that i get can be any brand that they carry.
they are not going to match the price i paid but the specs of the laptop i have now to something comparable.
do you think i should do this???
the extended warranty i got on this laptop expires september 3rd so i don't have much time to decide what to do which is why i would like your thoughts and suggestions.
i use my laptop not just for personal use but also for my job.
i look forward to hearing your opinions on what i should do.
