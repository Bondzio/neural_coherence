could you let us know how exactly the wireless router fits into your network?
is it connected this way?
internet -&gt; modem -&gt; wireless router -&gt; desktop or is it configured differently?
is there another router in the mix somewhere?
there shouldn't be any need to reinstall anything on the pc to get the wireless working for others.
i'm assuming that a simple reboot of the router doesn't work?
