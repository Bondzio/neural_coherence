My cd drive is not working at all, every time I put a cd in all it will do is spin very fast. My children have tried it and it does the same thing. Do I need another drive?

Double click my computer Double click the drive you want to open (D) probably although you don't say. Double click the file you want to open. Just putting a disk in does not open the program.

After 3 years of usage with the computer, I had never burned a CD. So I tried, but it never read the blank CD I inserted. So my best guess is replace your CD drive. You might as well go for a DVD durner since they are basically dirt cheap. I saw a couple for under 80 bucks a couple of weeks ago.

My computer said there was nothing in my drive. In general it never read any blank CD. My friend made a mixed CD, it worked fine on his CD player, but not on my computer.
