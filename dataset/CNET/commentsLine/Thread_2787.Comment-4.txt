with connected usb devices booting at start-up.
only have your mouse and keyboard connected(in the back, not the front or in the monitor.
printer is ok, i don't have it on unless i'm using it anyway.
i use a usb flash-drive for readyboost but don't connect it until my system gets past the bios screen, then is ok to put in.
lastest bios update still causing problems and was pulled.
