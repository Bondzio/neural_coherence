<s> hello all , this time around I'm, or should i say my roomate , is having a problem with his internet connection. </s>
<s> Well the problem is that after a while his computer being on, the internet stops working. </s>
<s> It states that it is connected and fully functional but we can't surf the net. </s>
<s> Its really annoying especially since when i need it and try to use his comp to quickly check my mail instead of taking out of my laptop from my backpack. </s>
<s> To get it to work we simply just restart the comp and its good to go. </s>
<s> I don't know if this is important but many times the computer is constantly on maybe days at a time. </s>
<s> No settings have been change that i know of and is scanned with AV and antispyware on a weekly basis. </s>
<s> Also the comp is connected to a wireless router(D-Link DI-514) The setup is: Hp a1600n Windows XP Media Center Edition 1gb Ram 200gb HDD ISP: Time warner Thanks in advance for any help MarsDTA </s>
<s> right click on the computer icon in the toolbar (bottom right down near the clock and calendar) choose diagnose connection, let it run. </s>
<s> How about now? </s>
<s> Well the first couple of times i tried your method it worked, but this morning it did its thing and i &quot; repaired&quot; the connection but still a no go. </s>
<s> MarsDTA </s>
<s> and check the D-Link web site for any new ones after reinstalling the original. </s>
<s> I've never installed a router driver. </s>
<s> Only for the wireless PC-card in the laptop. </s>
<s> But that's another device, of course. </s>
<s> What exactly do you mean? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> http://support.dlink.com/products/revision.asp This page will. </s>
<s> after you provide the needed information, take you to the newest driver for the adapter. </s>
<s> Drivers are available for both cards and chipset adapters. </s>
<s> This includes wired and wireless versions. </s>
<s> If you buy a card a disk usually comes with it to provide immediate support. </s>
<s> Kees sound like you need to look into a new driver. </s>
<s> Also, by the way, video drivers, audio drivers and ethernet adapter driver need to be sought out, auto up dating them isn't very reliable so you have to do it yourself to stay current. </s>
<s> I check every four months for new ones and they do change frequently. </s>
<s> I've been really busy this week with school( finals are coming up), but i finally had time this weekend. </s>
<s> so i reinstalled the the original driver (version 1) and then updated it to version 1.3, but still have the same problem. </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help so far guys Mars </s>
<s> Follow this path (no, OS specified) Start&gt; control panel&gt; network and sharing center&gt; go to the router your using, right click on it &gt; choose diagnostic repair. </s>
<s> let it run. </s>
<s> Try the connection again. </s>
<s> Is it working? </s>
<s> You can also reach this tool by right clicking on the adapter icon on the toolbar. </s>
<s> They look like two over lapping monitors in Vista and is the first one on the far right on the bottom. </s>
<s> If this does not work contact your IP for further connection testing. </s>
<s> Request this when you call. </s>
<s> You do have an IP don't you? </s>
<s> What is your connection speed? </s>
<s> You can test it here: http://www.speedtest.net/ Bookmark this site and run the test from time to time. </s>
<s> ok so i ran a diagnostic test but still the same problem, the desktop will not view any pages, but my iphone and lappy work without a hitch. </s>
<s> here are the connection speeds on the desktop with the problem [URL=http://www.speedtest.net][IMG] http://www.speedtest.net/result/211243633.png [/IMG][/URL] I think the problem is his desktop because as i mentioned before any other computer connected to the router work and do not have the same problem. </s>
<s> I feel like giving up, but am still willing to try more advice Dango that for the help so far mars </s>
<s> What specifically happens when you try and connect? </s>
<s> I need details, be specific. </s>
<s> Any error messages? </s>
<s> How about Email? </s>
<s> Has the OS been installed lately or re-installed? </s>
<s> Are you using AT&T DSL by chance? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> a couple of days ago the desktop stopped having hte problem, i thought it might have been a fluke so i left it on all day and tested the internet once in a while and all was good. </s>
<s> I i did nothing,and its fixed so yeah As to your questions Dango, before the comp mysteriously fixed it self. </s>
<s> Usually the comp is on all day and when i tried to use the internet it would not work, i would have t to reboot and then it would &quot;connect&quot;( when i checked the status of the signal and ran diagnostic test it said all was fine but no pages would load) Firefox and IE either said the typical page cant not be loaded or server not found(FF). </s>
<s> XP has not been re-installed recently or at all as a matter of fact. </s>
<s> Our ISP is Time warner RoadRunner.Thanks for all the help </s>
<s> see ya </s>
