I don't know if you've heard of &quot;Tiny&quot;... they were a UK-based company that didn't too well, so I'm no longer covered by them.
In any case, I'm well past my guarantee's duration.
A friend has told me it may be the motherboard that is messed up, but I can't afford investing in that so I'm likely to just buy a couple of more fans.
I have tried leavin the cover off but that hasn't solved it.
