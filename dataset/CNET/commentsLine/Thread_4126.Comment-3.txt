bob, yes, it is about 4 years old and out of warranty...seems a crying shame since i never got to back up anything on it.
i spent alot of money for nothing.
i will take it into best buy geek squad and if they do mechnical tests on it and find it is truly damaged i will just buy another external hard drive this time an ssd if they sell ssd external hard drives with large capacity...in the meantime, i have to find a way to unload large sections of my ssd c: drive it is now down to 6.82 gb free of a 119 gb capacity.... i do wonder if my windows 7 32 bit operating system is to blame for any of this..???
?
