You indicated you used the wizard to configure your home network.
So I assume you set up the Internet Connection sharing and etc already.
Did you also go into your Internet Explorer &quot;Options&quot; and change your &quot;Connection&quot; settings on your &quot;slave&quot; machine?
If not, go into your Internet &quot;Properties&quot; and under the &quot;Connections&quot; tab there should be some radio buttons.
Select the one that says &quot;Never dial a connection.&quot; This should disable the modem.
If your connection does not work after this, you may want to try to &quot;Setup&quot; your connection again.
And when you do this choose the option to use your LAN connection.
The wizard should walk you through it.
