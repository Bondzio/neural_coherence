<s> Yes I have a Linksys WRT54G router that have up stairs but I have no wireless equipment downstairs, but my PS2 is downstairs. </s>
<s> I want to hookup the PS2 to the internet for online gaming, but not sure how to get it connected. </s>
<s> I was thinking about purchasing the Linksys WTR54GS Wireless-G Travel Router so I can just plug it in downstairs and hook it up to the PS2. </s>
<s> Just a thought though. </s>
<s> Note: I had the same WTR54G travel router before, but took it back, cause I couldn't get it working. </s>
<s> But I think I just didn't know how to use it. </s>
<s> I thought you could just plug it in and roam around but didnt know you had to plug a cat5 cable to it to actually get on the network first then roam. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Check out the Linksys WGA54G. </s>
<s> I've never used it, but it's designed for exactly what you are trying to do. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> That sounds about right. </s>
