This has continued to be a question mark for me, too.
Dell does populate all 6 slots with 1GB sticks which is a real bummer - if I order now with 6GB and see that my heavy home video editing could use the full 12GB, then I would have to replace ALL 6 1GB DIMMs.
So that is a waste of the initial investment for me.
My question: if I'm running Corel VideoStudio ProX2, editing a large movie (45+ minutes), have multiple photoshop image files open, etc., could this system take advantage of the full 12GB of RAM?
A previous poster recommended ordering with 6GB and monitoring usage, but I don't want to waste the initial investment by throwing all those away if I see 6GB is not enough.
