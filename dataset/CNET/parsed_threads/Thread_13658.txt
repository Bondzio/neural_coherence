<s> I was in the process of getting my pc ready for an XP-home re-installation in order to clean up some things on my computer. </s>
<s> I have a large capacity slave drive (160 GB)that I previously partitioned into a 130 and a 30 GB drive. </s>
<s> I moved all of my data files from my primary C drive to the 130GB partition of the slave and I was just doing some other things to get ready for the process. </s>
<s> I'm not exactly sure when it happened but all of a sudden my computer was unable to view any of the files on that partition of the slave drive. </s>
<s> The 30 GB partition of the same drive is apparently unaffected. </s>
<s> In a Windows Explorer window when I click on the drive letter of the problem drive, a window opens asking me if I want to format this drive and that it is not formatted. </s>
<s> Of course I do not do it but I have all my files backed up there and I don't know how to retrieve them. </s>
<s> Some other things I recall doing in the process of getting ready for a re-install were: Upgrading the system BIOS (Dell Dimension 450 pc), unsuccessfully trying to install Norton Ghost to make a disk image, and just a bunch of files tranfered from C drive to slave partition. </s>
<s> I need some help here. </s>
<s> After I couldn't get the drive accessed, I unplugged all my hardware and re-installed XP on the C drive. </s>
<s> All my stuff is on the slave backup though. </s>
<s> With the new XP operating system installed, I re-plugged the slave and unfortunately the same symptoms occurred. </s>
<s> Any advise would be appreciated. </s>

<s> I have seen Windows install an generic driver for hard disk controllers that does not recognize large HD's. </s>

<s> If this is a homebuilt machine, download the driver from the motherboard mfg. </s>
<s> If the controller is a PCI add-in card, download the driver from the card's website. </s>
<s> The description of the driver should say something to the effect that it supports large hard disks or 48-bit LBA. </s>

<s> XP (you noted XP, not XP SP1 or XP SP2) will not recognise a drive over 127GB and it's partitions. </s>

<s> Did you try to install the latest HD controller driver as I suggested? </s>
<s> When you update the system BIOS, it often necessitates the installation of updated/new device drivers. </s>
<s> This is what sometimes happens--when the BIOS changes, Windows will install a generic driver because the old one no longer works. </s>
<s> The problem lies in that the generic Windows driver sometimes will not address the issue of 48-bit LBA, as noted by the post by R. Proffitt. </s>
<s> I had assumed you were using at least XP (SP1) because you had the drive working before. </s>
<s> Some fall into a pit by doing this. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Install XP. </s>
<s> Their CD is XP. </s>
<s> Nothing more. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Install SP1 or later. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Add a drive, use it and then... 4. </s>
<s> Wipe the OS and forget SP1 to regain access to the other drive. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> To seal the second drive's fate they often try disk repair tools before they install SP1 because &quot;they are looking to recover the data first.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> I had the large hard drive problem once with XP (no SP1). </s>
<s> Another time I had the problem when I installed Windows on a drive from an XP (SP2) disk. </s>
<s> I had a secondary 250GB PATA drive (not the boot partition) on a Promise Ulrta 100TX2 controller card. </s>
<s> After the Windows XP (SP2) installation, Windows didn't recognize the secodary drive as being formatted and storing files and asked I if I wanted to format it. </s>
<s> I knew the firmware version on the controller card supported 48-bit LBA, but the driver that Windows installed for the controller card didn't allow the card to recognize the large hard drives properly. </s>
<s> I ended up downloading and installing a driver from Promise to solve the problem. </s>
<s> Does that mean the slave drive in that scenario will never be able to be used above 130GB, or it could, but only after partitioning that 130GB+ partition into smaller partitions or formatting it? </s>
<s> You could install SP1 or SP2 to enable XP to support such a large drive. </s>
<s> Your choice here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Okay everyone say it &quot;Bob Proffit is my computer guru hero!&quot; Props on that answer Bob, you always stay a step ahead of me, just when I think &quot;Hey I know what the problem is there&quot; I scroll down, and sure enough, R.Proffit R.Proffit R.Proffit. </s>

<s> That my pager didn't work one day. </s>

<s> Bob </s>
<s> i you review my original post, I said that the drive was not recognized prior to my re-installation of the OS (which is XP-home SP2). </s>
<s> The drive was working fine right up until I did the BIOS upgrade and some other minor software things. </s>
<s> So if someone can link the BIOS upgrade to my problems then that is where I could use some help. </s>
<s> Please detail some solutions in that direction. </s>
<s> Is it possible to remove the BIOS upgrade and revert back to the previous one installed? </s>
<s> I'm kicking myself for doing that in the first place. </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies so far though. </s>
<s> Keep them coming. </s>
<s> If you can download an older BIOS file, just reinstall that. </s>
<s> However, I would try to keep the new BIOS, as it probably fixes some bugs in older versions and adds capabilities. </s>
<s> Please clarify the following: How many total physical hard drives do you have in this computer? </s>
<s> How many logical partitions and on what physical drive do they reside? </s>
<s> Where are all the drives located? </s>

<s> What are the names of your HD controllers? </s>
<s> What is the name and version of the HD controller driver? </s>
<s> I have had your same exact problem. </s>
<s> My solution involved uninstalling the HD controller driver and installing a different one. </s>
<s> You might be able to resolve this problem by downloading and reinstalling the latest IDE controller/chipset driver from the computer mfg. </s>
<s> If this is a homebuilt system, get it from your motherboard mfg. </s>

<s> I think this is correct: I went to My Computer - Device Manager - IDE ATI/ATAPI controllers - in this there were three listings: -Intel ATA Storage Controller -Primary IDE Channel -Secondary IDE Channel (I also saw each HDD listed in Device Manager with their own set of properties and drivers but I continued to look at the IDE controllers as you are suggesting) I clicked on the properties of each channel and then the ''Driver'' tab. </s>
<s> I assume that the Secondary IDE Channel is the affected one. </s>
<s> Is this a correct assumption? </s>
<s> Should I be doing something here? </s>
<s> Update, uninstall? </s>
<s> I wish that I tried this BEFORE reinstalling the XP operating system because I might have been able to select ''Roll Back Driver'' but now that I have obliterated the last OS, there will be no record of the previous driver. </s>
<s> If I Uninstall - I'm thinking Windows will try to locate the updated driver on next reboot - or maybe I should just click Update and my guess is that Win will search the web for an updated driver. </s>
<s> However, I have not installed web access on that computer yet - I have been waiting to get this drive functioning properly before making any more changes. </s>
<s> Since I have the CD with Win XP - SP2, will windows use that to search for an updated driver for this IDE controller. </s>
<s> Go to Dell.com and find all the drivers for your model here: http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/index.aspx?~ck=mn Download the ATA driver for your model. </s>
<s> There may not be an ATA or driver listed, so you will have to download the chipset driver. </s>
<s> If the downloaded file is a self installing executable file (.exe), just run that. </s>
<s> If the downloaded file is the actual driver file, try to update the driver through the particular device in the Device Manager. </s>

<s> I do apprecitate the help that people are trying to offer here. </s>
<s> However, I have a feeling that the controllers are not what is causing my problems. </s>
<s> If the controller was not working properly, why would the second partition on the hard drive in question work perfectly fine? </s>
<s> The driver for the controllers was from the XP Service Pack 2 from when I reinstalled the OS. </s>
<s> I don't see how that could be affecting things since the drive was working fine before. </s>
