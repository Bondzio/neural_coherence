<s> My mom has a Dell Dimension 5100 and the on/off switch to the CPU seems to be bad. </s>
<s> Sometimes it turns the computer on, sometimes it doesn't. </s>
<s> She thinks she needs a new on/off switch. </s>
<s> I've scoured the net and can't find one anywhere. </s>
<s> Some folks sell old ones pulled from working computers on eBay, but none match the 5100. </s>
<s> 2 questions: 1. </s>
<s> Is it really likely that it's the switch that's bad? </s>
<s> The computer does occasionally power up. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Where the heck can I find a switch?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> if you want to dig a little. </s>
<s> Find the two wires coming from the switch. </s>
<s> Trace them to the motherboard connectors. </s>
<s> The switch is the &quot;momentary&quot; type which means the contacts close the connection on the wires only while the button is pressed. </s>
<s> You can do the same thing with a small screwdriver between the two connectors on the motherboard. </s>
<s> If it powers up every time, the switch is bad, a not uncommon occurrence. </s>
<s> You might find a replacement switch here, input the PC make and model number. </s>
