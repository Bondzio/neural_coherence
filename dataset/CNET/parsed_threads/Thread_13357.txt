<s> Hey I wanna buy a new windows laptop and I am wondering buy the toshiba satellite L855 B511 or the HP dv6?. </s>
<s> they are both almost equal in options but the toshiba has 3.4GHz while HP has 3.1 GHz but it's not a big difference and that's why I am wondering so which one do you think is better? </s>
<s> Also if you know another laptop with good features please let me know it's name. </s>
<s> BTW, I have a macbook pro so please if you list a name of a laptop please I want it with chiclet keyboard like the mac ty </s>
<s> HP has got problems. </s>
<s> I've had Toshiba laptops the last 5 years, and have as yet to have a problem with them (knock, knock). </s>
<s> I already had the HP and it was fine but that was since around 4-5 years so idk about the new HP what type of problems did u face with HP? </s>
<s> Right out of the box there was a bug/defect. </s>
<s> At 3 months I had the time to call it in. </s>
<s> 8 hours on the phone and they take it back. </s>
<s> What's not good about what happened next is that they returned it in far worse shape than they got it. </s>
<s> Before it had a bug. </s>
<s> After their repair it would lock up in minutes. </s>
<s> To make matters worse the support calls were answers with &quot;we've done all we could.&quot; at 9 months I called it my last HP. </s>

<s> Toshiba any day, I've had a few different manufacturers L/T's. </s>
<s> Toshiba with Intel processor, pretty hard to beat, I presently own 2, one is 5 years old, the other a bit over a year, great units, highly recommend. </s>
<s> HP's tech support has got to be worse than nothing. </s>
<s> They're the only ones I've ever experienced who will tell you things that're 100% opposite from the truth. </s>
<s> E.g. </s>
<s> they told me you could plug a PCI card into a PCIe slot. </s>
<s> I've read Bob Proffitt's posts about how they were unable to fix a defective system after many months (I see he's posted about it in this thread), and seen other similar posts. </s>
<s> There've been numerous news reports about their financial problems and the management shake-ups they've had in recent years too. </s>
<s> does not matter what matters are the chips inside intel for business amd for games </s>
