pc2100 is in less demand, so you might think that it costs less; but it doesn't because there is not a large supply of new modules, and it's more costly for vendors to carry it.
today, pc3200 is usually least expensive because there is still a lot of it around and is backwards compatible with slower ddr.
putting it another way, the one-size-fits-all product is less expensive.
just get whatever is least expensive from kingston, crucial, corsiar, pny.
it's usually called &quot;value&quot; ram and costs about $40 today.
you will see rebate specials on this from time to time at $29.
the cheapo 512mb pc3200 module from compusa should also do just fine--just return it if it doesn't work.
you're correct--you can always purchase a second 512mb module later if the need arises.

in fact, with windows xp it should do the opposite by relieving system resources (namely the use of your hard drive for virtual memory).
this is especially true if the computer is using integrated video circuitry and not a dedicated video card.
