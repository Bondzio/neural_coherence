<s> I am a first-time computer builder who just finished his first build - and no problems! </s>
<s> I have two 640GB hard drives that I have put into RAID configuration, with 200 GB worth of mirrored RAID1 space and approx. </s>
<s> 800GB of striped RAID0 space. </s>
<s> I am a little confused about the best way to allocate my programs and my system onto my space. </s>
<s> I have an awful lot of large files to copy over and create(i do a lot of graphic design) and music and pictures, hence the 200GB of RAID1. </s>
<s> I have also put windows vista x64 on the RAID1, as i don't want to go through the headaches of reinstallation if something goes wrong, and set the RAID1 part as the primary boot partition. </s>
<s> I plan on putting the rest of my programs (adobe suite, autoCAD, assorted games) on the RAID0, along with general non-backup needed files. </s>
<s> Am i taking full advantage of the RAID array I've created? </s>
<s> should I put the OS on the RAID0 partition? </s>
<s> currently EVERYTHING is set up ono the RAID1 part, as i've just set the thing up and installed windows. </s>
<s> if i should change something, i have no problem reinstalling things or reformatting my system now when it is squeaky clean. </s>
<s> also - i am a new vista user and kind of a newbie in general - doing a bit of learning by doing. </s>
<s> if you advise doing something with the page file or crash dump or anything like that, please either explain or send a helpful link. </s>
<s> thanks for the help matt </s>
<s> put all of your apps and windows tree on the raid1 (i assume c:) drive. </s>
<s> reinstalling apps is a pain especially if they issue a lot of patches. </s>
<s> create a fixed pagefile on your raid0 drive (assume d:) of 2-3gb. </s>
<s> shrink the pagefile on c: to 64mb (just enough to hold a kernel dump). </s>
<s> change your temp folder to one on d: as well as temporary internet files. </s>
<s> use d: for your adobe/autocad scratch device and games, music, video, etc. </s>
<s> if you're using vista business or ultimate, turn on shadow copies for any document folders. </s>
<s> basically put anything you can easily restore from backup on d:. </s>
<s> anything that has to be reinstalled should be on c:. </s>
