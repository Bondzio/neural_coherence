<s> Hello guys, I have a question. </s>
<s> I'm currently buying a new PC and I would like to know which of the two options gives me more performance. </s>
<s> A single 750GB 7200 rpm speed, SATA 3Gb/s hard drive or two 320GB 7200 rpm speed, SATA hard drives in RAID 0. </s>
<s> There is no specification for the 320GB drive, so I'm assuming its 1.5GB/s. </s>
<s> Which of the two options will give me a better performance? </s>
<s> Or will there be barely any difference? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> That SATA speed is just for the interface and not indicative of any drive speed. </s>
<s> In fact a 3.0G drive benchmarked not much faster when we jumpered it down to 1.5 or connected it to a 1.5G interface. </s>
<s> Test then decide. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your quick reply. </s>
<s> Guess I'll have to test it then. </s>
