<s> Im stuck between the 7900 cards and the new 8800's. </s>
<s> I have a legit copy of windoes xp laying around, from which i will built my system with. </s>
<s> I dont plan on upgrading to Vista. </s>
<s> So if the dx10 doesnt work with windoes xp then i dont want to waste my money on a dx10 card, ill go for a 7900 sli instead. </s>
<s> Thx in advance. </s>
<s> Read http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb219721.aspx#Will_DirectX_10_be_available_for_Windows_XP </s>
<s> Man i almost went for the 8800 320mb. </s>
<s> Well now at least i can get better performance for less with 7900 sli. </s>
<s> Thx </s>
<s> I plan on buying halo2, will a dx9 card run fine with it, how far in the future will i be able to play games with dx9. </s>
<s> That's what my crystal ball said so I'm sticking with that. </s>

<s> Sorry, your guess is as good as mine on that one. </s>

<s> An 8800 GTS 320 will outperform a 7900 gt 512, 7900gtx, and 7950 with no problems and will even hold its own against 7900 in SLI. </s>
<s> Not sure how much you've looked into it, but just thought I'd throw in my two cents! </s>
<s> 8800gts 320mb is faster in most games than 7900gs in sli. </s>
<s> and you don't have to worry about the niggles that sli can cause. </s>
<s> Im not as knowledgable about the specifications about videocards as u guys. </s>
<s> The way i compared how the 7900's in sli would be faster is, i just doubled the clock speeds and compared it to the single 8800, but i guess i was wrong. </s>
<s> If the 8800's indeed are that fast i have have no problem purchasing one of them or even sli'ing it later. </s>
<s> Cool, now i learned something new. </s>
<s> Isnt pc gaming so much fun (and lots of $, LOL). </s>
<s> I read somewhere that older cards like the 7900's with 512MB run better then the new 8800 with 320MB cuz of less memory or something. </s>
<s> the 8800gts/320mb starts to stumble at high resolutions. </s>
<s> however at resolutions below 1920x1200, the 8800gts is as fast as a 7950gt (dual 7900gtxs). </s>
<s> so unless you've got a 24&quot; widescreen or larger, one 8800gts/320 will smoke two 7900gs cards. </s>

<s> Everyone is familiar with Microsoft's subtle, gentle pushes to upgrade to the latest and newest and more expensive software, e.g. </s>
<s> &quot;We will no longer provide Security Packs or updates to this version of Windows after this date.&quot; What's the word with Win XP? </s>
<s> I agree with you, I see no point in moving to Vista. </s>
<s> My wife can get an outrageous educator discount, my system will handle everything but the highest Aero demands (128MB PCIe card) but I'm having a hard time figuring out &quot;WHY&quot;. </s>
<s> Win XP was a phenomenal jump over Windows 98SE in terms of stability, usability, PnP, security, etc. </s>
<s> but I don't see the radical need this time. </s>
<s> I know adoption of Vista has gone well but is not replacing XP all over the world. </s>
<s> Sooo...... anyone heard any rumors about how long Microsoft will continue to support Win XP before putting it out to pasture? </s>
<s> I'll pass on the web site but MS does answer that and the dates change with time so my answer will be incorrect as soon as it changes. </s>
<s> But let's look at Windows NT 4.0. </s>
<s> While it was left with a gaping security hole we fix that with a firewall. </s>
<s> Now what's left? </s>
<s> APPLICATIONS, not the OS. </s>
<s> Who needs Internet Explorer? </s>

<s> I think this is getting off-topic, but i would like to make a point. </s>
<s> I recently figured out how to backup and restore windows with 'Bart PE' so if anything happens (viruses, corrupted files) i can restore it as it was. </s>
<s> As for security updates, i think most hackers will move on to the new vista and most importanatly i won't be botherd by a massage like &quot;Secuity updates are ready to be downloaded&quot; in the middle of the game (LOL), if MS stops issuing them. </s>
<s> direct x 10 is a whole new patch over direct x 9c and will cause your directx 9 video card to crash if you can even get it to load </s>
