4338	0	226440	2363381	NR	SonChaser	1/2/07 9:41 PM	1.16777406E12	Dual access to external HD	I just got a Acomdata external HD enclosure (USB 2.0/Firewire) and I want to hook my main PC to it using the firewire (done sucessfully) and my laptop up to it at the same time using the USB connection. Can this be done without damaging the unit? I have successfully plugged it into the laptop with only the USB interface (no connection through firewire at that time). Thanks for the advice

And advantage is that (using a wireless connection to a router from your laptop) it's available wirelessly also. You might be able to buy just an enclosure, and keep using your current hard disk in it. Kees

I assume it is, but I was just wondering. I tried searching for my question before posting and didn't find it...sorry for the repost.
