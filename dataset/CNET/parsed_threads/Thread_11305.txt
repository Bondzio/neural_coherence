<s> If I have two 150gb drives in raid 0 can I mirror them to just one 500gb drive, or does it have to be a raid 0+1 or 1+0 set up with two drives in raid 0 and two drives mirroring them in raid 1? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> RAID 0 is not a mirror. </s>
<s> That's striping. </s>

<s> &quot;two 150gb drives in raid 0 can I mirror them to just one 500gb drive,&quot; Well, 2 times 150 is 300 here. </s>
<s> How did you get to 500? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> All this RAID stuff is confusing to new owners. </s>
<s> Why not make your choice and &quot;do it&quot;? </s>
<s> you could setup the mirror via the OS (vista or xp pro) but you'd be losing the speed of the existing striped volume. </s>
<s> all onboard RAID controllers that i know of would require 4 drives for a 1+0 setup. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I never said raid 0 was a mirror. </s>
<s> The question was is it possible to mirror a raid 0 array onto just one drive or does it have to be four drives in raid 0+1 or 1+0. </s>
<s> 2. these are the drives I have already. </s>
<s> I understand that 300gbs is less than 500gbs. </s>
<s> It is not really relevent to the question so long as one of the drives is large enofe to mirror the size of the smaller two together. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I asked the question so I would understand a little more about the subject so I could make a better choice on witch way to go. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> It's now clear you are not using English. </s>
<s> Let's say you have an existing RAID 0 you want to convert to RAID 0+1. </s>
<s> There is NO DOCUMENTED METHOD to do this because you have no details from what RAID controller you are using today. </s>
<s> If it is possible your documentation must tell you how. </s>
<s> DO NOT GUESS. </s>
<s> Read the fine documents and if you don't see it, then it doesn't offer such. </s>

<s> Thank you this is just what I wanted to know. </s>
<s> Sounds like I should put the two 150s in raid 0 and use the 500 for the os and media files like music. </s>
<s> Just have to remember to make a back up every week or so. </s>
<s> This will be a hardware RAID. </s>
<s> I am building a new game computer and have been looking up alot of things that iv never tryed before. </s>
<s> My next questions will be on overclocking. </s>
<s> I dont know enofe about it to have a question yet. </s>
<s> maybe soon. </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your reply. </s>
<s> It helped alot. </s>
<s> The question was is it possible to setup a 0+1 with only three drives, two in raid 0 and one in raid 1 with the first set. </s>
<s> It is now clear to me that this is not possable. </s>
<s> I do thank you for your replys. </s>
