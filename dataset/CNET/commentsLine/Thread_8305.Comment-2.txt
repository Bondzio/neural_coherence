opinions are based on judgements, judgements are based on values, no two people share exactly the same values, therefore the opinion of others can only be useful if you know the values upon which they based their opinions.
if it does what you want it to do, and you are happy with it, it is good, and may remain that way for many years.
don't fall into the trap of &quot;mine is bigger than yours&quot;.
otoh, if it doesn't make you happy, and you genuinely need more power, then, and only then, consider an upgrade.
