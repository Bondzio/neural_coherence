<s> I bought a Cannon imageCLASS MF4690 and it seems I can't view the software on os 10.5.2. </s>
<s> It seems to install and then after words it does not go into the application folder. </s>
<s> I had to map the ip address to the printer to connect to it. </s>
<s> It prints right now I just want to get the cannon printer software to work. </s>
<s> The software does not work on windows xp or vista. </s>
<s> Disconnect your printer. </s>
<s> Uninstall your printer. </s>
<s> Restart your computer. </s>
<s> Download the current firmware from here http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&tabact=DownloadDetailTabAct&fcategoryid=335&modelid=14980 Click on it. </s>
<s> It will prompt you when to connect your printer. </s>
