Thank you, both of you, for your quick and succinct advice.
For WD1600JB HD 160GB.
I have downloaded the dlgsetup 11- win.zip (that is being padentic and uninformed)although the WD advises, &quot;if you want to copy all the contents of the boot disc, that is precisely what I want to do,&quot; use DOS version of Data.
Should I use that instead?
I would not know the results of the exercise until after the Xmas holidays.
The product is a Xmas present for my grandson.
Thank for your help.
