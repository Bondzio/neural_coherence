2218	0	194916	2101390	NR	Varren	7/30/06 1:53 PM	1.15426758E12	Computer overheating constantly	Lately, my computer has been freezing every time I start playing a game forcing me to shut it down and restart it. One time I felt the top of the case and it was very hot. I am almost certain that overheating is the cause of my problems. I also know that my case has horrible airflow and my video card probably has lots of dust in it too. The temperature in the room is 80-85 degrees. So what I am asking is, what should I do to solve this problem? Buy a new cooler for my video card? Some more fans...or maybe a new case alltogether? If you need to know any more details about my comp feel free to ask, I really want to know what's the very best for my situation. Specs AMD Athlon XP 2400+ EVGA 6800GT in AGP Antec Mini-tower case Here are some pics of the outside of my case, showing all the fans.

Oh and opening up the side might not be such a bad idea, it'd greatly allow for more air to get into the case, but I don't plan on drilling any holes in my case at any time.

So if your room is 80 degrees, you need to try and keep it in the 70's. That being said, do the following: 1. Install some form of windows AC unit. 2. Clean all the dust, use a static free brush and a portable vaccum cleaner / blower. 3. Check connections for processor fan, HDD fan, GPU fan, etc... If problem persists, 4. You can get a portbale fan and blow it onto the computer (keep the case open). 5. Get a new case with lots of fan's or a liquid cool system.
2218	6	194916	2101925	2101868	Varren	7/30/06 10:20 PM	1.154298E12	Well....	I do not know what a windows AC unit is and I'm kind of nervous about messing around in my case because I've never done it before and my parents will get angry at me. I do have a fairly large fan that I can set so it blows into the case, but I really don't have the money right now for a nice, new case. Maybe sometime later though.
2218	7	194916	2102122	2101925	Willy	7/31/06 4:23 AM	1.15431978E12	Act now	Since, you mentioned parents, well do what you can. If you don't at least open case soon and clean out the innards and place a household fan to blow on system you wouldn't have a working system in the future. Understand also that as system heat goes up, the psu becomes less stable. Less stable means it loses wattage output and/or more prone to outright failure, so act quickly. I suggest also, you elivate the system off the floor to reduce sucking up dust too readily. enuf said -----Willy

I applied some thermal compound, which usually comes along with the processor, in between the Heat Sink and the Processor. My Processor temperature has not gone up since then.

As for elevating the case, there isn't really any space on my desk or anything but I guess I could find some things to prop up under it. As for applying thermal compound, if I knew how to do it then I would. Again, I have never gone into my case and tinkered around with the hardware before. If I got desperate enough maybe, but I'm hoping this open case, fan cooling method will work for now.

My pc has been running for years without any problem with overheating and then one day it overheated. I splitted my pc into pieces to find out the problem. I found out that the thermal compound on the video card was getting old and hard. It couldnt lead the heat from the chips anymore. I fixed it with replacing the old thermal compound.
2218	11	194916	2103169	2102622	Willy	7/31/06 2:53 PM	1.15435758E12	Not rocket science	There's a first time for everything. Just use common sense and don't rush any attempts. Placing something under the case isn't a brain twister(books, 2x4's, some bricks). Further, opening the case and doing direct dust control isn't that hard either, I suggest a small paint brush, ground yourself on the metal portion of the system case before any cleaning. Getting that fan pointed at the system case, well you get the picture. tada -----Willy

Starcraft's requirements are easily met and Counter-Strike: Source's I meet as well (I can play it at max settings with little problems). Again my video card is a 6800gt and my cpu a XP 2400+. My 430W psu is sufficient for this, right?

Double check every fan inside your computer to make sure all of them are actually running. You could have a bad fan on the processor or video card. 2. You may want to evaluate the overall ventilation layout and change the direction of one of the fans. If all of the fans are blowing in the same direction, such as out of the case, you may not have enough openings in the case to balance the air flow. Try turning the lower fan around to blow into the case. So you now have some fans blowing out and 1 blowing in. 3. Depending on your layout inside of your case, if you have any PCI cards, such as a modem or NIC card, you could try moving it to another slot away from your video card. 4. Cables, especially any wide ribbon cables can block airflow, try changing the placement of some of these cables. 5. You may have a poor thermal connection between one of your heatsinks and your processor or video chipset. You could remove and reapply heatsink compound to these areas and make sure they are seated properly. 6. You may need to purchase a better heatsink and fan for your processor or video card. 7. You could cut holes in the case and install more fans or purchase a new case, but I would only do this after you have exhausted all other issues. Good Luck! Dana H.

Simply if your system is overheating the typical first suspect is the cpu fan and heatsink. Video cards come later as if a video card gives out, you'll either be able to boot without video or it'll give that beeping sound for &quot;video card not detected&quot; (consult your motheboard's user's manual). Or if the video card is overheating, usually you'll only get a heavy maybe 1 minute lag, not a full shutdown. Usually the easiest way is to apply new thermal grease and clean the fan. Then test with torture test programs such as Prime95. If the thing still gives out then try buying a better cpu and heatsink (which is the usual case with AthlonXP's).

After much head scratching and thoughts on new hardware, I found the solution. The inside of my case showed some dust, dead insects etc. The cpu fan looked slightly grubby until removed when it was apparent how grubby it was, equally, the heatsink on top of the cpu was virtually completely clogged. Unbelievable. I cleaned everything with a small paintbrush and vacuum cleaner. No more problems. Hope this works for you. Regards Ralph, Valencia, Spain

The stock powersupply was rated a 300 watts . and the recomended powersupply is a minimum 350 watt powersupply for the 6600gt . I beleve that nvidia recomends a minimum of a 400 watt power supply for the 6800. Judging from your case and the fact that you are running a 2400+ processor you may only have a 200-250 watt power supply . Also check to see if you have the power plug connected to the video card and that it is not shared with your harddrive. New power supplies are cheap these days and you should be able to pu a 500 watt one for the 100 dollar range or less.
2218	21	194916	2111604	2111522	kristaylor	8/4/06 6:16 AM	1.15467216E12	Buy an air conditioner!	No matter how good a computer's case airflow and cooling are, if the room is too hot, the computer will be too. As the ambient (room) temperature rises, it becomes more and more difficult to cool the computer. The reason? Cooling happens by moving heat, in this case away from the chips, drives and other items which produce it in the computer and into the room. The heat is replaced by the air in the room. As that replacement air gets hotter and hotter, less and less cooling occurs. Once the temperature in your room approaches that inside your computer, no cooling is actually taking place. The only solution is to lower the temperature in the room. Other partial solutions such as getting a better power supply might help as well. 3D games draw more power from the power supply, and cause the power supply and video card to produce more heat. Some power supplys cut off if the temperature gets too high. A good power supply will produce power more efficiently, producing less heat, and also generally be able to withstand higher thermal conditions (they're also more likely to have better cooling built into them).

Although the case didn't get as hot as yours did, my system would constantly freeze up. Sometimes during regular activity such as reading e-mail etc... It got to the point where it would freeze up running idle with a screen saver running. I started making phone calls and inquiries and first thing I was told was that it was the power supply so I replaced the power supply.....no luck with that. I then started replacing obvious items such as the Graphics card sound card. It still persisted. I then called the MB Manufacturer who suggested that I try using a different thermal transfer grease between the CPU and the cooling element. I did that, as well as install a colder, faster cooling fan. Seemed like for about 3 days it worked but then was right back a it. I contacted the MB Manufacturer and they were great. They sent me a brand new MB replacement because they thought it was possible that there was possibly a defect with the CPU Chip port on the board. Then after installing the new board etc... It continued, there was only one possibility left. The CPU itself, I had previously called Intel about this issue and they had a case number on me for the chip so they replaced it. That was the problem the entire time, mind you I called them prior to that. They always insisted that there was no way it could be the chip, which it was an unsusual incident as it did not completely stop working. But after that no more Freeze ups! The most recent system I built this year also had an overheating issue. It was solved by a buying a much better cooler case. An Antec P180, See my profile about my system. This case is much better, it has 3 cooling fans and it separates the HD compartment from the MB and it is extremely quiet. It's amazing, the design is all about cooler air flow inside the case. My CPU would keep overheating when I first built this system and now it never heats up. Well I hope this information helps you out. On the system freeze up.... I would be inclined to think (based on my experiences) that it is the CPU. If it's fairly new then AMD should honor the warranty on it and replace it. Of course, if you have available parts and peripherals to swap in and out of the system to test it, that's a good way to do a process of elimination as to what the specific problem is. Unfortunately it is not a simple one. Good luck with it.

If you installed the fans in the case yourself, you may have installed a fan that is drawing air in the opposite direction of the other fans. example: rear fans may be pulling the air to the rear of the case and the front fan is pulling air towards the front of the case. Make sure the air is flowing in one direction.
2218	24	194916	2112181	2101390	pcguru4u	8/4/06 9:16 AM	1.15468296E12	Some sensible suggestions Varren	For the love of Pete..... You've got an adequate power supply, a nice processor and a decent card. Now lets get down to business. While leaving the side off the case has proven effective, it's just not practical for obvious reasons. So let me help you on a permanent one. You already stated the top of the case gets warm. Yes. When the PC is just sitting there, the CPU, the Vid card and the PSU (power supply unit - just to make sure!) are not under load. When you play one of your favorite games, everything is sucking up the extra juice the PSU is supplying. Extra heat. I'm guessing the Vid card is a recent upgrade (and a good one) and you probably didn't have much of a problem before. That eliminates the CPU, and the power supply as the heat mongers causing the problem. So now you've got a great card, but it's pumping more heat into the case. Too much for it to get rid of efficiently. Lets look at the fans at the front and back of the case. All fans are measured in millimeters nowadays and there are hundreds of sizes just for PC cases. Do a Google search for Case Fans and you'll see what I mean. Your fans will have a sticker in the middle that you can probably use to search to see the specs on it. I mean the CFM (cubic feet per minute) and the noise level (in db). What you want is a fan (actually - fans as you have two) that provides a higher CFM. This will move more air in and out of your case much quicker than the stock fans. One thing to note: the stock fans are based on the assumption that they will move an adequate amount of air &quot;as quietly as possible&quot;. There's the trade-off. A quieter fan moves less air. If you can find the specs for your fan online (I'm sure you will as most PC manufacturers don't make their own fans, they get them the same places you or I would, just by the boatload!) get another fan, the same outside dimensions (say 80mm, 92mm or even 120mm) and with at least double the CFM. You will have to make a small sacrifice in noise level, but it wont be like shouting over a jet engine. As a bonus, most fans will not set you back much in the way of bucks. Expect to pay around $30 or so for the two fans. As far as keeping the PC off the floor - do it! Use anything because keep in mind the intake fan on the front is sucking in air -and whatever else is in front of it. Think of it like an expensive vacuum cleaner and you get the picture. Dust is a great insulator and if enough of it accumulates in the PC, you can toast your rig. I hope this helps a litle. Your PC is a valuable tool and you want it to last.
2218	25	194916	2112828	2101390	sasquatchll	8/4/06 1:23 PM	1.15469778E12	Computer overheating constantly	I would like to jump in on the 'dust' wagon. It is warm in your room which is part of your trouble. I'll bet if you live somewhere where you get a full four seasons that you had little or no trouble in cooler weather. Your 430 watt power supply might be a little borderline. But considering you are using an AMD processor and maybe only one hard drive, it should be quite adequate. If at all possible supply your nVidia card with a power lead that is not supplying power to anything else. Now to possible cures: Your CPU's heatsink. This thing will clog with dust and you cannot see it clearly enough to notice the problem while it is in place. Cleaning this is not difficult. Just go easy on things while you are taking them apart. Once you have the heatsink in hand using some care you will be able to clean it. Use a brush (a tooth brush will be fine) and clear out the dust bunnies. Important, use new thermal compound if at all possible. And if the compound present has hardened then this is an absolute must. Your CPU can fry in just seconds if there is poor to non-existent thermal conductivity between the heatsink and the processor. Scrape the old compound off with a single edge razor blade and wipe the surfaces clean. Then apply a little paste to the processor and gently re-assemble your parts and pieces in reverse order. This same condition can affect your GeForce 6800, or most any other graphics card also. Here it isn't as hard to clean it up though. You should not have to remove the heatsinks to clean them. Just remove the cover and brush them and the fans out. Your chipset can be cleaned the same way if there is a dust buildup on the fins. A little compressed air or a brush will suffice here. Your case might have filters in front of the intake fan(s). These can usually be easily cleaned with a brush or your fingers. Now for the hard one. Your power supply. Many power supplies also have a fan inside of them. You may find it a little hard to open the case because of the wires and cables but this area can be a cause for heat related shutdowns too. As dust builds up on the fan and the heatsinks inside of your power supplies case its' efficiency will be downgraded. You 430 watt unit might be outputting 330 watts or even less. Take your time and open up the power supplies case with reasonable caution. You do not want to apply too much force on the cabling because you might tug some internal parts shorting out the unit. Just open it up far enough to apply some compressed air or whatever will do the job. All of these things should be on your maintenance schedule. In my case I usually do the CPU about every 3-4 months. The graphics card twice a year. And the power supply once a year or so. Needless to say, you will not only turn your PC off to do these things but unplug it too. Static electricity can easily fry most any IC's. So do make sure that you are touching the case or some other metal object while handling the CPU or the video card. Static is much more of a problem in cool dry weather but it should never be assumed that it won't rear its' ugly head at any time. Touch something to discharge it frequently. And keep your fingers away from any traces or other contact surfaces as much as possible. Using appropriate caution a complete newbie can do all of these things. Just remember how you took each part out or label things as you go, and don't loose OR mix up any of the screws. Shoot even I can do it.

If the back is that dusty I can only imagine what the inside is like. I think that a good cleaning (blow the dust out) will help that overheating.
2218	27	194916	2112910	2101390	atcgy	8/4/06 2:00 PM	1.1547E12	Varren, Open the case. 9 out of 10 dust is in your heatsinc	Open the case. Don't use a blow can, use a vaccum with the brush attachmet. Unplug your computer from the back. Let it sit for a minute or two to releave the static charge from the motherboard. If you have a static wire that hooks to your wrist and clips on the compter it is best. Without mashing the brush on anything go over everything lightly with the vaccum on. What you can't get use a Q-tip to clean with the vaccum hovering over it. Make sure you don't leave any of it behind. The case you are using has restrictive air flow. An AMD processor and motherboard is notroious for overheating. Getting the dust out will sure help. Getting a $10 fan from Bed Bath and Beyond, Brand Honeywell. It gives a great amount of airflow with surprisingly little noise. Aim it in the corner to blow the air around the back, but not into your computer. This will also increase the ariflow in the room and help to dispurse stagnent air pockets in the room. keep vents from blowing into the computer. That is the best way of building up internal dust. If te problem persiste you may need to alpply some new thermal compound on your processor. It it comes off black just replace the processor. It has heat damage.
2218	28	194916	2113201	2112910	sasquatchll	8/4/06 4:24 PM	1.15470864E12	Vacuuming	Your vacuum cleaner will be unable to 'clean' the various heatsinks that are enclosed and covered with fans. In fact if you try to vacuum out those heatsinks what you will actually accomplish is to lodge the 'dust bunnies' in worse. The only real access to the heatsinks you have that a vacuum cleaner can get to are on the wrong side of the problem. If you wish to use air to clean these heatsinks you have to blow air through from the fan (outer) side of the heatsink. You might use a vacuum cleaner to trap the dust blobs as they are dislodged. But if you do this be very careful as the vacuum cleaner itself is very capable of generating a respectable static charge by itself. It is really much better to remove the fan/heatsink combo from the CPU to do the cleaning. Then you can renew the thermal paste at the same time. This is aggravated more with newer processors as the heatsinks are largely enclosed and can really get plugged up. The dust plug is generally between the processor/socket/motherboard and the heatsink where a vacuum cleaner cannot reach. This is made much worse if someone smokes in the area. The residue from smoke acts like a binder for the dust making it really build up into something from another planet.

I said in my second post here that I had an Antec 430W PSU. Next, I didn't unfortunately take the time to clear out all the dust from all the heatsinks or anything. I just took off the side panel and stuck the fan there. I really lack the experience and skill necessary to handle all of the hardware correctly, I had it built at a local computer place. I also lack the money to buy any new things such as a new case or new fans. Despite all this, I have been having zero trouble during games. Nothing is overheating anymore so as of now I am perfectly content with my computer like this: http://putfile.com/pic.php?pic=main/8/21522422624.jpg&s=f10 (See also that I slipped a plank of wood under it to get it off the dusty ground) Note: I do have a portable air conditioner in my room it just takes awhile to really cool things off in the extremely hot weather.

Make sure you blow out all connection ports (USB, Serial, Ethernet, Phone modem, ETC). You computer needs all the openings it can get to suck air in and push it out to vent and cool. If you have your fan vent clear but the gaps around your connections clogged you are not getting all the circulation the computer needs. CLEAN IT ALL OUT! This is the cheapest fix there is.

If the top of the case get extreamly hot to the touch then you could be looking at a power supply issue. You really need to do a through cleaning even if it comes to removing the power supply and blowing it out thourghly. even doing that there is no garentee that you will remmove all the dust. Your intake and exhaust fans must also be thourghly cleaned. Dirt causes them to slow down and not run at the proper RPM that they were designed to run at. One way to find out is to remove the side and try to spin the blades by hand if it seems to drag as you are trying to rotate them, then replace them with at least 2000 rpm fans. Next you need to blow out the heat sink on the processor, this is extreamly important, as the air flow can not remove the heat build up if the fins of the heat sink are clogged with dirt, I have seen heat sinks so clogged that they had to be removed and scraped in order to get the dirt out.(If you have to remove the heat sink then you will have to replace the thermal grease. clean both the processor and heat sink with alcohol make sure they are both clean, let them dry good and then smear a thin layer of thermal grease on the processor ONLY, carefully replace the heat sink). Next blow the entire case out. if there is a fan on the Video card check it also. This fan is extreamly important also. I am a computer tech. and I have seen some perty dirty computers in my time. Your ambiant temp. has a lot to do with how cool your computer runs. If you room temp is above 80 then you are going to have poor cooling because the out side air is just as warm as the air inside the case. Processors usually run at a temature of 90 to 125 degrees depending on the processor. Intel's run hotter then AMD's. If you are going to play games on your computer then you have to make sure your computer can handle it. That includes good ventalation. But it really sounds as though you power supply is the problem if the top of the case is getting hot to the touch. I run a 660W power supply in my gaming machine, the top of the case is as cool as anything. If you need any further help my e-mail address is airborn1012004@yahoo.com please feel free to ask any questions about computers. I also custom build computers, mostly for gaming.

I did not notice a SIDE mount fan in the pics. ONE rear case fan is not going to cut it on a gaming `puter. ya need a side intake fan to bring air INTO the case as well as the rear fan sending the hot air OUT of the case. Additional CPU / GPU cooling would be a good idea too. Rather than getting fancy with Liquid Nitrogen or DiHydrogen Oxide cooling systems, try using a simple supercooler plate between the CPU and heatsink. Utilizing the Peltier Effect, one side will get ''freezing cold'' as the other gets blazing hot. As long as you wire it correctly so that the HOT side is against the Heatsink, not the CPU, your system should remain quite stable even while sitting in a 90 room since the cooling does not rely on the ambient temp in & around the case.

From the picture you showed with the power strip surge protector with a full load of other plugs in it,I'm not surprised. 1:Calculate the total amps drawn on the line in. 2:Figure out the max draw in amps when you are running full boar on the comp. 3:It may be that you are not getting enough from your line into the comp period.I bet any fluctuation would- To little amps,volts,emf or even get this disturbances from harmonics or phasing Oh! and line distance(resistance) from the main breaker box this is just a taste of all the things that people say what? You can learn some of the basics of electrical theory and common sense Ideas at http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/ sniff around there. Best bet is to shut off cpu hogs in the start up tray, Clean out your cache etc,....set to games mode your anti virus....clean and defrag your system. Do a reg mechanic fix. Believe it or not they can overload the processor and make it hot all own their own. Then to stabilize the power input to your machine and give it clean uniterupted power to prevent any waiting of momentary lulls or spikes that kink the high speed 1's and 0's, get a huge battery back up power strip surge protector rated higher than most people want to spend but hey its your crash.... worth every penny....I know for sure. The right one can keep those wave forms sweet. Last but least cheapest way out find an outlet closest to your breaker box with no other connecting devices plug it right in and watch-you ''will'' see smoother cooler operations... and do the other stuff clean defrag etc. That stuff really works for any one with any computer.

2218	37	194916	2114355	2113534	Compdoc46	8/5/06 10:12 AM	1.15477272E12	A final bit of advice	Varren, you asked for advice and you got it. All of it good and knowledgeable. However a few additions to what you have listened to. For instance, getting it off the floor means set the PC up on a table or your desk. Not something a half an inch in height! Something that's at least 2 or 3 feet off of the floor. Using that board... you're still going to get dust, animal hair etc... These are PC killers! When people tell you these things can kill your PC they are being honest. If your CPU and motherboard fry they will fry everything that is plugged into or attached to them as well. Such as your HD, Video card, sound card, modem CD Drive etc.... You will basically be left with a box of fried electronic junk. Invest also in a can if compressed air. You don't have to be Einstein to know how to use it to blow the dust out of your machine. You just use the thin tube that comes with it, hold it close to the fan over the CPU and blow. Not difficult at all. Also the house fan you're using.....do you have it blowing air into the case or drawing air out of the case? If it's blowing air into the case it's just pulling more dust and debris into the case as well and will expedite your PC's demise. If it's pulling air away that's exactly what you want it to be doing. Drawing as much heat away from the case as possible. Good luck with whatever you decide to do.

2218	39	194916	2116375	2101390	OsborneJo	8/6/06 6:24 PM	1.15488864E12	Try no-cost.	Before modifications to the computer, try the no-cost - move the computer away from the wall, open the case and gently vacuum with dusting brush (I have a minature vacuum extension brush which is ideal), reseat the boards after vacuuming, making sure the dust does not create an electrical open. Leave the cover off, as long as no pets or kids might investigate, and move to a cooler room. Putting a small room fan to blow on the computer helps, if you have one to spare. Dust is murder on these machines - move it off the floor if there's a big accumulation, because the bare floor doesn't trap dust like a carpet, so guess who collects it? Dust can also jam the little chip fans - I lost a video card that way - the chip fan froze, and the video card (fortunately cheap) went south. I've heard that the LinkSys routers have heat problems, as well, and putting it on the hotspot of the computer isn't help either one.

I installed another (bigger) fan but didn't help. Took the PC to a PC repair shop, they checked and said the CPU was faulty. Replaced the CPU and voila... problem solved.

The systems fans are located in certain spots on the computer to help increase the airflow inside the pc. That airflow is directed over the system board, especially the Processor! Taking the cover off will cut off the airflow path and cause your computer to overheat MORE. You can check your fans by simply taking the side off momentarily and see if the are spinning and feel for air, then putting the side back on. Again, DON'T leave the side panel off this messes up the airflow within the unit!

Replacing the same may correct the thing. But I want to ask u that how does changing the power supply solve the problem & what do u actualy say by changing the power supply does it men for AC to DC ?

The one biggest dust collector in a pc is the cooling fins on top of the cpu. Carefully remove the entire assembly. Then you can get in all the fins. A can of compressed air comes in handy for this as well as oyher parts of the pc. Clean out all the ports, etc. Now dont scimp here; get some good quality thermal grease. This would also be a good time to do a complete reboot. Shut her down, turn off the pwr. switch, unplug it, remove the quarter sized battery on the mother board for 60 sec. Reverse it all and see what happens. Ps After removing the battery; hold down the front power buton to bleed off any remaining juice. Dont forget to ground yourself.

When I came back and turned it off.The next day the computer, a laptop Dell D600,started shutting off but in stand by.In other words the screen would go off and the computer would do a strange shutting off. What I did is, I would press the stand by button and press it again then the computer would start normally again.After a few minutes or longer the screen shuts off again. How I fixed the problem so far: I opened up the computer and cleaned up the fan and the cooling radiator with a vacuum cleaner. I also removed the cooling pipe off and as I thought there was not enough heat sink compound.I put more on the processor an Intel mobile 1.8GB.I put everything back together. Also as a precaution,I reinstalled the graphic card drivers. It may take the processor some time to change protocol so it may shut down a few more times before it stops that routine. Today Tuesday its two days later, so far so good no more shutting down....

Start attending church and please take your kids so they have a fair chance at coming to know your, mine and their God. Now go to Target or where ever they sell a can of air...buy it! Blow the dust out of your fan and intake portals...walah...done in ten minuites.
