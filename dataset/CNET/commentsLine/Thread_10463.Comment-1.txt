hello, i am running with a geforce ti-4200 card on a abit kg7 motherboard.
for years, if i try to enter a game without letting the machine run for 10 minutes, the video goes into pyscho colors mode and i have to reset.
temperatures are fine within case and cpu.
suspecting the 300w psu, i upgraded to a good 400w with no change.
downloaded latest nvidia drivers - no change.
i swapped with video card with another (geforce 256) in another older pc and both pcs work fine.
so, i believe i have some quirky compatibility issue between the mb and the ti4200.
i would like to get a 6600gt card but would i be throwing away money since the mb only supports agp 4x?
