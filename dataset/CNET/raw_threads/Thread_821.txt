Thanks for all your help. n my second wireless laptop, i am having a problem with slow download speeds and cannot get the comcast setup wizard cd to run. The download speed is about 700KBPS. What would cause this computers download speed to be slower than my other two computers? OS is Windows XP sp1. After running Tweak Tester II on both wireless computers, the only difference was the max idle time 1St computer 46.1 ms 2nd computer 120.2ms. What adjustments can i make to reduce the amount of idle time? Posted by: dwhyte Posted on: 11/12/2004 12:09 PM
