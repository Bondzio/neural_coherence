1.1.1	I currently have a sent of the Logitech Z-5300e and want to know the frequency range of JUST the satellite speakers ( ie not with the sub ) .	St
1.2.1	I typed the following into Google.com : Logitech Z-5300e This is one of the first links that came up in the search : http : //www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN , CRID=2177 , CONTENTID=9586 I then clicked on the & quot ; Specifications & quot ; tab and saw that its frequency response is 35Hz - 20kHz .	St
1.3.1	See if you can see a part number for the just the satellites .	St
1.3.2	I could n't find one at Logitech.com .	St
1.4.1	I 've tried all that and I even emailed Logitech about it but they gave me the same response you did ( 35Hz-20kHz ) so not very helpful .	St
1.4.2	I 'm not too sure where I 'd find a part number either , there is n't much on the speaker itself .	St
