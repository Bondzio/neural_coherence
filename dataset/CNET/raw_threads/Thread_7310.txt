Then I got the bright Idea to get a wireless card for my desktop, just to see if I could get the laptop to talk to the desktop. but after reading the info that came with the PCI card it seems I can not do that. I did not try it yet and figure I would ask if it will work before I try it. Now I have no wireless access point or router or anything on that line just 2 computers with wireless cards. All I want to do is make sure the card in the Laptop will work while I am away. Thanks Gene

Quite a few of the Motels I am going to stay in next month have wireless access and I wanted it to work. Thanks again
