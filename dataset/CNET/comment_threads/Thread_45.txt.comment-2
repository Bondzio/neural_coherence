You will need a much larger power supply and plenty of cooling.
I'll guess the MB, processor and RAM will cost you close to $500 alone.
You might through in another 100 for a halfway decent case with some breathing room and PS over 400w.
If you want to do more than spreadsheets, web browsing and such, you might want more RAM but XP will run ok with 512 megs.
Your Dell box might not fit the MB anyway.
Have you checked into this?
