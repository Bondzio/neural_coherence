i have a us robotics router connected to a satellite modem with 1 wired connection, 1 desktop wireless connection and a laptop wireless connection.
the setup was extremely simple, speed is 125mbps and the only problem i have is the satellite connection.
i have never had to call for technical support as the network works flawlessly.
i am only working on one floor with a maximum distance of 50 feet.
the usrobotics pcmcia card in my laptop also functions flawlessly with every other wifi network i have encountered at motels across the country.
