1.1.1	My Linksys WRT54G v5 is a dog -- stops working , needs to be rebooted almost daily .	St
1.1.2	I 've read the reviews ( and this forum ) and I know I 'm not the only person with this problem .	St
1.1.3	It 's lousy equipment , I want to replace it , and I wo n't be buying Linksys again .	St
1.1.4	So -- can anyone recommend an affordable ( & lt ; $ 100 ) home wireless router ?	Ques
1.1.5	My criteria are , in this order , 1 ) RELIABLE ( day in , day out , never needs attention ) ; 2 ) FAST ; and 3 ) EASY to set up and maintain .	St
1.1.6	I do n't need any high-end features -- just an internet access point with WPA+ encryption .	St
1.1.7	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.1.8	I think we might all have been better off when we communicated by beating on hollow logs .	St
1.2.1	Check out this post on how to hack your linksys router and turn it into a more reliable firewall , client access point , or just plain old wireless router .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.jimzimmerman.com/blog/2006/10/13/Turning+A+Linksys+WRT54G+Router+Into+A+Wireless+Client+Access+Point.aspx I now love my linksys .	St
1.3.1	First ... What is fast ?	Ques
1.3.2	You want a line speed router ?	Ques
1.3.3	Why ?	Ques
1.3.4	If your looking at $ 100 routers then you probably ca n't produce enough bandwidth to actually use a line speed router .	St
1.3.5	Second ... It needs to be rebooted daily ?	Ques
1.3.6	I 've used nothing but modified linksys routers for my company of 100+ people and its the only thing I do n't have to worry about .	St
1.3.7	''Thanks for your help .	St
1.3.8	I think we might all have been better off when we communicated by beating on hollow logs . ''	St
1.3.9	( Right ... . ) ''Easy to setup . ''	St
1.3.10	What easier than plugging it in ?	Ques
1.3.11	Do a little research .	St
1.3.12	Walk though Best Buy .	St
1.3.13	Do n't trash a good product , maybe you should talk to your ISP ( Internet Service Provider ) .	St
1.4.1	I have had my Netgear Super G Wireless Router Model : WGT624 ( Bestbuy $ 59.99 ) for about a year now , only had to reset it once , which was very quick and painless , so I would totally recommend a Netgear wireless router .	St
1.4.2	I have a mac ibook , but my friends come over with there peecees and they have never had trouble connecting .	St
1.4.3	If you do n't want an open network , very easy to close it up too .	St
1.4.4	That is all I have to say , hope is helps .	St
1.5.1	works fine for me .	St
1.5.2	I have n't had to reset it after I set it up correctly .	St
1.5.3	Question Are you turning off your radio when you disconnect ?	Ques
1.5.4	Rick	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	To be perfectly honest , as I support and install these for friends and family , I have n't seen much difference in the four most popular routers ( NetGear , LinkSys , DLink , and Belkin ) .	St
1.7.2	All of them seem , from my vantage point , to work as advertised .	St
1.7.3	As such , when someone asks me which one , I tell them to buy which ever is on sale that week and I 'll help them get it up and running .	St
1.7.4	Following Bob 's advice about upgrading the firmware has resolved almost every issue I have come across , except the occasional & quot ; doa & quot ; that can happen to any vendor .	St
1.8.1	I posted the original message on 10/16 .	St
1.8.2	One of your responses reminded to check my firmware , and I did -- sure enough , Linksys had posted an update on 9/22 .	St
1.8.3	I updated and , to their slight credit , the worst of the problem has ended -- I have not had to re-boot the router since I updated .	St
1.8.4	HOWEVER , Linksys is n't free and clear -- this was the third or fourth firmware update I 've installed since I 've had the router , none of which solved the problem I described in my original post ; AND the darn thing is still buggy -- sometimes I have to try several times in order to establish a connection .	St
1.8.5	If I take the router out of the loop , the problem is gone .	St
1.8.6	Linksys still has some 'splainin to do .	St
1.8.7	Thanks gang for the suggestions .	St
1.9.1	My now 3+ year old Linksys 802.11b router still works like a charm .	St
1.9.2	No problems .	St
1.9.3	If you are having problems you may want to try a simple flush .	St
1.9.4	Open the command prompt and enter : ipconfig /flushdns .	St
1.9.5	This may clear some old stuff in the cache .	St
1.10.1	I own a Linksys WRT54G wireless router for just about 3 years now .	St
1.10.2	In all the crap that I put it through , even with self-inflicted errors what I would get when I 'tweak ' it , it still runs like a charm .	St
1.10.3	I will admit , there are times when I flash to new BIOS , the router would crap out .	St
1.10.4	I simply re-flash it to it 's origional state , and works like a charm agian .	St
1.10.5	Added Hi-Gain antennas when I get crappy signals , and it works even better than I thought .	St
1.10.6	If you are still experiencing internet issues , you may want to try the hi-gain antenna option .	St
1.10.7	Assuming all else fails .	St
1.10.8	Good luck	Polite
1.11.1	I do n't know about the WGT624 but I can tell you the WGU624 is not good .	St
1.11.2	The problem that sticks in my craw is that the logging/emailing function is not operational .	St
1.11.3	This thing does not log at all .	St
1.11.4	My old 614 did it flawlessly .	St
1.11.5	I spent three months trying to work with Netgear support only to find out about a class action lawsuit against them .	St
1.11.6	They offered me $ 10 off my next online purchase through them .	St
1.11.7	I also bought their MP101 to wirelessly stream music .	St
1.11.8	It looks pretty there gathering dust .	St
1.11.9	It has never worked although I think it is the server software .	St
1.11.10	I have negative feelings about a company that their gear fails out of the box .	St
1.12.1	Actually , I just replaced a DLink DI524 with the DI634M .	St
1.12.2	Both are very reliable , gave me virtually no trouble .	St
1.12.3	However , the 634M is much faster , with MIMO and a greater range .	St
1.12.4	I 've had it for at least three months , and I may have rebooted it once since getting it set up originally .	St
1.12.5	Both were easy to configure with a reasonably simple & quot ; G & quot ; home network .	St
1.13.1	I USE BELKIN ROUTER I HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH ONLY COSTS 40.00 FOR THE ROUTER AND THE CARD WE HAVE 2 PCS NO PROBLEM WITH EITHER ONE DELRAYBEACHBUM @ ADELPHIA.NET	St
1.14.1	Experienced a problem setting up my Linksys Speedboost Router with Verizon DSL .	St
1.14.2	After several weeks , and no resolution from Verizon , and a ton of frustration , called LinkSys Tech Support .	St
1.14.3	Result , return unit ( defective ) for exchange .	St
1.14.4	With the exchanged unit , setup ran smoothly and without any problem .	St
1.14.5	No problems since .	St
1.14.6	Regardless of the brand , anything can fail out of the box , or have problems .	St
1.14.7	The model Linksys I have is the SpeedBoost model .	St
1.14.8	I turn mine off daily after use , as well as the computer .	St
1.15.1	that I purchased at Sam 's Club a year or so ago .	St
1.15.2	I may have to reboot once a month or less , but other than that , I have n't had many problems .	St
1.16.1	When I went wireless two years ago , I already had a Belkin switch based wired network .	St
1.16.2	I added a Belkin Wireless Access Point and I 've had not a single problem .	St
1.16.3	The interface to the AP control panel is a bit clunky but it does the job .	St
1.16.4	I 've had Belkin kit for other projects in the past and never had a problem with any of it .	St
1.16.5	It 's cheap too - at least here in the UK !	St
1.16.6	Good luck .	Polite
1.16.7	Z	St
1.17.1	I have had endless linksys routers same problem as you finally went with 3com never rebooted in two years .	St
1.18.1	I used to have the same problem with routers when doing torrents .	St
1.18.2	Searched through the web for solution and found that its better to update the linksys firmware to a Linux DDWRT .	St
1.18.3	Am now a very happy owner of the router .	St
1.19.1	You sir , are an idiot .	St
1.19.2	You should note that this is a VERY common problem with v5 of the firmware for this router .	St
1.19.3	Linksys does not deserve your business if they allow such ridiculously lousy firmware to become public without the proper testing .	St
1.19.4	Check Wikipedia if you do n't believe me .	St
