i have what i believe is a 32 bit operating system which i was told will only hold 2, 1 gb ram sticks in its two open slots.
i already have one in there and the other 1gb is new.
i believe they both are ddr (atleast the new one is) and i have an intel processor.
my properties show 960 mb but my bios reads 2000 mb?
please help!
