you do not want to open the case of a hard drive, they are put together in sealed rooms with no dust, opening one up will more than likely destroy any ability to recover the data from it.
a small bit of dust you can't even see is like a boulder under the heads of a hard drive.
anyone replacing the pcb of a hard drive is taking a chance of losing all their data, which a recovery service may be able to get back.
