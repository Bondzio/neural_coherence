I'd like to spend around $100-150, and want to have something that is higher quality, very reliable, and fast! Don't need a huge HD, maybe 120 GB max. I'm more concerned with the quality than the size. My computer is an iBook G4 (purchased June 2004), running OS X 10.4.11. I'm also adding a one GB stick of RAM. Thanks!

That said, could his theory be based on older hard drives, back in the day, that seemed to last forever, or at least longer than the actual computer? Those drives were only 2, 4, 8 GB. If 80GB is going to do for you, go for it P
