&quot;could i use 512mb ram with 256mb ram in dual channel mode (sounds it could happen) and if yes what kind of 256mb ram could i use in this situation?
&quot; no.
then memory must be in pairs.
i will not explain further why this is so.
there may be some that wish such a mismatched pair would work but that's all in the computer's design and not subject to our wishes.
confirms you need pairs.
get the second 8htf6464ay-53ed7 from crucial and you're done.
