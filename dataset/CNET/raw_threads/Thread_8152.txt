So until i saved up enough money to buy and new 1tb hdd i decided to take out my 160gb sata drive from my old laptop and let that hold me over for a few weeks till i get enough money. The installation went great plugged everything in and windows detected it just fine. problem now is i wanna format it so i can have all the space from it to put shows, music etc. in it put every time i try to format the drive i get the following error. http://tinypic.com/r/vi1y1d/6 System Specs.
