<s> Hi, I got another 512 ram through today to add to my 1 gig of memory I already have. </s>
<s> But when I install it, the computer just holds on the motherboard Splash page. </s>
<s> I am running: winxp sp2 2x Samsung 512 memory (new is Crucial 512 memory) p4p800s-e deluxe motherboard I know all the slots and memory sticks work as I have juggled them around to test them all, its just the motherboard doesnt like having more than 2 sticks in at a time. </s>
<s> And I am sure the motherboard will take up to 3 GIG of ram. </s>
<s> I cant think what it can be at the moment, so any suggestions will be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> (I tell you, mad...) As you add more sticks of RAM, the CPU BUS slows every so slightly and you may get failures. </s>
<s> You also will draw more power so any power issues may show up. </s>
<s> To get such to work I usually... first have the latest BIOS since some BIOS updates address memory timing. </s>
<s> Next I try the BIOS defaults, then I may slow down the memory timings. </s>
<s> If you feel this isn't right, you can always call the board/system supplier and demand they make it work or refund your money... Best of luck, Bob PS. </s>
<s> XP rarely pays off above 512M except for Doom 3. </s>
<s> And I've yet to see any payoff at 1.5G. </s>
<s> Sorry, run through that again. </s>
<s> Im having trouble flashing the bios, but thats another story, Iv been told I have the latest version anyway. </s>
<s> How do you slow down the memory timings? </s>
<s> And what do you mean by pay off? </s>
<s> im running a DAW (digital audio workstation) and need all the RAM I can get when running (often 3) big power hungry programs at the same time...if thats what u meant? </s>
<s> Anyway, thanks. </s>
<s> Every make of BIOS uses some other set of pages of options. </s>
<s> YOU didn't post a link your your machines BIOS instructions so all I can offer is a GUIDE such as &quot;slow down the memory access&quot;. </s>
<s> This means reducing the CPU FSB clock rate, inserting a wait-state or setting the CL from 2.5 to 3.0 or other... </s>
<s> This may be bad news since video work is generally not that dependent on RAM past 512M. </s>
<s> I know this one since we run some DVD compilation software and at 512M the box does its work in 6 hours. </s>
<s> We added the second 512M and it finished in 5 hours, 55 minutes. </s>
<s> No payoff there. </s>
<s> The test was repeated many times. </s>
<s> We did eek more time out of the boxes by getting faster RAM and finding some settings in the BIOS and we eeked out 5 hours with just 512M so that paid off. </s>
<s> Sorry you didn't post your machines BIOS manual... Why are you not making this the machine supplier's problem? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Because I built the machine, but I will contact ASUS soon. </s>
<s> I just post problems on forums because they are a lot more helpful than most technical support, who tell you just to upgrade drivers to get you out the door quickly. </s>
<s> I just restarted my machine to get into the BIOS and I think its completely freezing when it gets to the splash page as I cant hit DEL. </s>
<s> That's a sign of deeper problems such as power. </s>
<s> Since you built it, then it's likely you get to fix it. </s>
<s> No one may be able to get this to work with the sticks of RAM you have. </s>
<s> To get it to work, you would fit the monster power supply (try 550 or 650 Watts) so you know that's not the issue, have the latest BIOS or don't complain and then use 1GB memory sticks of the make/model that the motherboard maker lists as compatible. </s>
<s> Remember that some boards have odd requirements for pairs of sticks to get better memory access. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks, im having problems flashing my BIOS, its yet another story, ROMID errors and all that, list goes on. </s>
<s> Anyway, is there a way I can test to see if it is insufficient power before I go buying another PSU? </s>
<s> ..can I just disconnect some IDE devises for example and try and boot? </s>
<s> And I also though it might be something about installing RAM in pairs, but there are only 3 black RAM slots, and it says nothing in the manual about pairing memory. </s>
<s> Thanks for replying </s>
<s> There are mobos that are critical relative to compatibility, some will only run if the memory boards have the same capacity or speed, try checking your mother board manufacturer's web site, there could be compatibility issues like in the case of tomato mother boards, did you check the memory capacity jumper setting switches, you may need to adjust it to accept the additional memory, check the mother board setting manual reletive to jumper setting. </s>
<s> jumper settings! </s>
<s> dam im such a noob sumtimes :P ill check it out, (please let it be them) </s>
<s> i think i may have found the problem Recommended Memory Configurations: DDR DIMM1 |DDR DIMM2 |DDR DIMM3 (Rows 0 and 1) |(rows 2 & 3) |(rows 3&2) --------------- |------------ |---------- Single/Double-sided |double sided |None --------------- |------------ |---------- Single/Double Sided |single sided |Single sided 2 old RAM sticks are double sided, new is single I think i need to replace one of the old ones with a single at least i think thats what it is What do ya think? </s>
<s> No one reads the manuals... </s>
<s> I agree with you Bob, 100%. </s>
<s> YEt, there are times, sometimes when we have something new, we feel so excited about it. </s>
<s> No intention. </s>
<s> You are doing a good thing Bob! </s>
<s> Keep it up! </s>
<s> yeh yeh i know im a noob. </s>
<s> But i only seem to learn the hard way i should have it sorted soon anyway, got some more on order.....compatible ones </s>
<s> NIL </s>
