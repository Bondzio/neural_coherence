<s> Hi -- I'm having some real problems with my Soundblaster PCI128 - I had problems installing it initially, and it was all down to the PCI Legacy Device that it was trying to install. </s>
<s> Eventually, it just didn't install the device, and, since I don't use it, it wasn't missed. </s>
<s> I rejigged the guts of my PC yesterday, and moved the soundcard to a different PCI slot. </s>
<s> It redetected on Windows load, and it locks up -mouse, keyboard - everything - as soon as it detects the 'Soundblaster PCI128 Legact device' - I've removed all references in Device manager and rebooted - same problem. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Try booting up into safemode and go back to Device Mgr. </s>
<s> Go to the Sound category, click the plus mark if it's not already opened up, right click the Legacy Device, and choose Properties. </s>
<s> Once there, look for the box that says Disable In All Hardware Profiles and put a check mark in it. </s>
<s> Click OK, and then reboot to see if the problem persists or if it fixes it. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice, but I already removed the legacy device in Safe Mode, so it no longer exists. </s>
<s> I did however disable the soundblaster's main driver in Safe Mode, then rebooted, and attempted to enable it. </s>
<s> It detected the legacy device again, and hung the system. </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I've seen that hangup when the motherboard drivers were not installed. </s>
<s> When you dive into such issues, the make/model of the motherboard is important. </s>

<s> Hi - It's an ASROCK K7S8x Does that help, or would you need more? </s>
<s> All I can do is offer you clues. </s>
<s> I noted it, so what do you do next? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You don't mention the version of Windows, without that it really is difficult to assist anyone. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> You did not mention the Version of Windows. </s>
<s> If it is WindowsXP then it normally detects & installs the Card (Eacept if it is not XP compatible certified in which case you need to have proper drivers) while Win9X needs the proper drivers. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The version & model of the card? </s>
<s> There are quite a number of models & Vers of this name. </s>
<s> Vibra, WDM etc. </s>
