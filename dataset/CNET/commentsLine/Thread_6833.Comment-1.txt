i have a computer service business that i started over a year ago that i run out of my house.
one thing that i don't have it some diagnostic utility to test hard drives.
when a customer suspects that their hard drive is going bad, i'm not really sure how to check that out.
is there some utility that can be used for this purpose?
suggestions?
thanks.
