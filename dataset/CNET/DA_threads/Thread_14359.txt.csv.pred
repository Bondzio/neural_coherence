1.1.1	I want to give an adult family member a tablet for Christmas .	St
1.1.2	He has learning disabilities and is not a PC user and is truly a computer newbie .	St
1.1.3	With my help I envision him using the tablet to watch movies via Netflix and other sources ; watch TV shows via websites ( e.g. , NBC ) ; do simple Web surfing ( e.g. , check the weather and his bank balance ) ; and check a Gmail account .	St
1.1.4	GPS would be nice but is not mandatory .	St
1.1.5	A 9 - 10 inch screen would be best for him .	St
1.1.6	Higher battery power ( but not necessarily the highest ) would be best .	St
1.1.7	He does n't read well so we do n't need book-reading capability .	St
1.1.8	I have the impression that watching live TV , such as a football game , is not yet readily available or cheap .	St
1.1.9	He does n't use apps , although there might be one or two that interest him .	St
1.1.10	He does have an iPod ; I download the music for him .	St
1.1.11	He would use this tablet at home and while we travel .	St
1.1.12	I 'd like to keep connectivity fees as low as possible .	St
1.1.13	At home we have Verizon FIOS for Internet , TV and cell phones ( not for our & quot ; regular phone , & quot ; which is a landline on copper ) .	St
1.1.14	One thing I do n't understand about tablets is whether getting one with Wifi means we can connect in a hotel room or coffee shop without extra fees ( unless either or those charges a fee ) .	St
1.1.15	I understand a data plan is not recommended .	St
1.1.16	Do we need 3G or 4G for the usage I describe ?	Ques
1.1.17	I would appreciate any recommendations .	Polite
1.1.18	So far it appears that the iPad and Samsun Galaxy are the way to go .	St
1.1.19	Thank in advance .	St
1.2.1	Next week I 'll have the 7 on hand so I can check new questions about NBC that I did n't try at the trade show .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	As I explored options this past weekend , I focused on Netflix capability , since we already pay for a Netflix account and that will be one of the primary uses .	St
1.3.2	But I could not find a chart that compares tablets ' support at a micro level .	St
1.3.3	I did discover year-old message boards and Netflix tech blogs that stated that Netflix was supporting Android devices ( Honeycomb ) , along with a link to a download for the tablet .	St
1.3.4	In May 2011 PCWorld listed six recommended Honeycomb tablets and I assume they support Netflix : Xoom , Transformer , Iconia , Flyer , G-Slate and Galaxy .	St
1.3.5	I could n't find any newer info on which tablets support Netflix .	St
1.3.6	Do the iPad and Nexus support it ?	Ques
1.3.7	What are the minimum processor requirements I should seek in order to enjoy streaming movies and TV ?	Ques
1.3.8	Thanks so much for your fast response over the weekend .	St
1.4.1	What 's your price range - If you do not have any problems to spend 400-500 bucks on a tablet computer then you should head straight to iPad , Galaxy tab or even Google Nexus 7 .	St
1.4.2	As far as I can see , battery life and processor is one of the most important factors while choosing a tablet for your family member .	St
1.4.3	You should definitely consider Google Nexus 10 as a forum member mentioned before .	St
1.4.4	But If I were you - I 'd buy either Nexus 10 or iPad 4th ( Not mini iPad cause it 's the same s*** except it 's smaller )	St
1.5.1	I initially was headed straight for the iPad , but then I started wondering if I could find something cheaper .	St
1.5.2	I 'm signed up for various price discount alerts between now and Black Friday .	St
1.5.3	There 's a Galaxy Tab 2 deal right now for $ 300 plus free shipping .	St
1.5.4	But I 'm still weighing functionality vs. price .	St
1.5.5	I agree that battery life and processor are key for our purposes .	St
1.5.6	I also want to minimize taking on additional fees , such as a data plan or a new movie streaming vendor .	St
1.6.1	The makers and Netflix are n't answering your questions which is troubling .	St
1.6.2	But here it is : https : //play.google.com/store/apps/details ? id=com.netflix.mediaclient & hl=en https : //itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051 ? mt=8 The confusion I can see in the Android are those no-name tablets that you do n't have the Google App Play store .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	To see if your web sites work on them .	St
1.7.2	While the Kindle Fire HD is really really great some will not like that some sites do n't work .	St
1.7.3	CNET Videos are fine but no videos at Yahoo Finance work .	St
1.7.4	Go figure ?	Ques
1.7.5	The KF HD is again , really really great for the buck .	St
1.7.6	Still getting the Nexus for another reason .	St
1.7.7	I 'm lucky that the office is on the move to Android apps so we are getting more units .	St
1.7.8	Bob	St
1.8.1	... I should test-drive in person .	St
1.8.2	After poking around the Netflix blogs a little more , it appears that the Android tablets , iPad and Nook support Netflix .	St
1.8.3	The online specialis I 've seen so far allow returns in extremely limited circumstances , so it 's buyer beware .	St
1.9.1	I now have the Kindle Fire HD 7 , a Nexus 7 and some older Android tablets and a few older tablets from last year .	St
1.9.2	And the phone is now Android 4.0.4 .	St
1.9.3	With a little help from others the Nexus 7 is now able to use most web sites so it 's the clear web user winner .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	Pantel has today launched one low budget ( approx 160 $ ) Android ICS tablet .	St
1.10.2	It comes with 1.2 GHz chipset processsor and runs on Android ICS platfrom .	St
1.10.3	Packed with 5000 mAh battery , it supports all standard connectivity and multimedia formats .	St
1.10.4	Additional and unique thing about this tablet is its 2G SIM compatbilty which let 's you enjoy with normal voice call facility .	St
1.10.5	You can get complpte detailes from here : http : //www.techgama.com/2012/11/penta-t-pad-ws802c-2g-launched-with-2g.html	St
1.11.1	It 's usable but junky .	St
1.11.2	At least it was cheap .	St
1.11.3	The truly awful thing is how poorly it 's integrated with the Android OS .	St
1.11.4	Some folk think it 's fab to be able to type in words but you have to use this setup to see how short they fell in integration .	St
1.11.5	Pass .	St
1.11.6	Bob	St
1.12.1	Check out my reviews at : http : //pacsnet.org/forum/viewtopic.php ? f=25 & t=160 I chose the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 seven inch , 8GB tablet .	St
1.12.2	You can find these on sale this Christmas for $ 179 .	St
1.13.1	I am part of the over 60 crowd and want a tablet for just the same reasons ... adding on book reading .	St
1.13.2	With eyesite going being able to choose the size of the print will be a blessing .	St
1.13.3	Mainly it will be the simplistic side of having a tablet ... e-mail , browsing , simple games , I have both Hulu and Netflix accounts and wi-fi in the home , and the ipod 2 as I do like to take photos and share video every so often .	St
1.13.4	This may be something he too will enjoy so just an added attraction of the 2nd gen. My family has chosed the ipad 2 with 3 G for me .	St
1.13.5	The 3G is in case I get stuck at a Drs office for a extended period of time and am willing to pay the data fees .	St
1.13.6	The 2nd generation seems to be available at lower and lower fees too so good deals are possible .	St
1.13.7	My kids are all tech savvy , no land lines..only cell phones ( new ones every year ) and all have tablets and laptops .	St
1.13.8	The BIG reason they are going ipad for me is because it is easier then Andriod for us oldsters to learn .	St
1.13.9	I have a Driod X phone and well over 2 years of having it I am still learning how to use it .	St
1.13.10	We have talked a lot about pros and cons on which talbet to get me and I have tried out the ipad .	St
1.13.11	My advice is to go with the ipad2..sales will likely get better as they get rid of the 2nd gen stock since everyone is on the new 4G bandwagon right now .	St
1.13.12	I have seen those..they are blazing fast with stunning visuals !	St
1.13.13	For older folk and people with learning diabilities I tend to agree that the ipad is easier to learn .	St
1.13.14	If you think about it - it does us no good to have caring people buy a wonderful item for us if we are not able to understand how to use it AND good of you to care to be able to offer this to someone who I am sure will have his world opened up immensely by what you are going to give him .	St
1.13.15	Kudos to you !	St
1.13.16	!	St
1.14.1	After finding very positive reviews of this device , including Netflix users on Amazon , and scoring an online purchase price of $ 296.00 ( and free shipping ) , I took the plunge .	St
1.14.2	I 'm still exploring the device , which arrived yesterday , but so far it 's fantastic .	St
1.14.3	I had Netflix up and running an Instant Play movie from my Netflix queue in about a half hour .	St
1.14.4	Not having viewed movies on a smartphone or anything other than my TV or laptop , I did n't know how to get the Netflix app for the Galaxy .	St
1.14.5	I called Netflix customer support and they explained it .	St
1.14.6	I have n't watched a movie all the way through , but the first five minutes were great .	St
1.14.7	This is using my dependable Verizon FIOS wifi from home .	St
1.14.8	Will be interesting to try this in a hotel , where wifi can be sketchier .	St
1.14.9	I also set up a Gmail account and surfed my usual sites - Weather Channel , Yahoo , etc .	St
1.14.10	I 'll report back if I encounter any problems .	St
1.14.11	I have 45 days to return the device .	St
1.14.12	May be tough to hand this over as a Christmas present , which was the original plan !	St
1.15.1	Yahoo Business web pages with video did n't play here .	St
1.15.2	So I found that discussion about Firefox Beta and a link in same discussion for Flash and it 's all good now .	St
1.15.3	Bob	St
1.16.1	If he has a good music library , get an iPad .	St
1.16.2	All the music from iTunes library will instantly load on iPad , save you time and hassle .	St
1.16.3	iPad 's interface is more consistent , not that Android is overly complex ( it has customizable features that might not be useful ) Both have ways to track device location , but I think iPad 's have a little more control in that regard .	St
1.16.4	As to durability , iPad 's lead in taking dings and bumps .	St
1.17.1	Check out http : //www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2412184,00.asp .	St
1.17.2	Good comparisons about tablets .	St
1.17.3	Hope that helps .	St
1.18.1	It was not funny to find that many websites did n't work on that tablet .	St
1.18.2	I wo n't go into great detail but at least on this one I can install another browser and an add on and get to far more sites than when it was stock .	St
1.18.3	Folk are trying to use these but they are coming up short in many areas .	St
1.18.4	With billions at their disposal I was a little surprised I needed to add another browser .	St
1.18.5	Bob	St
1.19.1	i found a 7 & quot ; tablet a13 .	St
1.19.2	it is about $ 70 .	St
1.19.3	i used it .	St
1.19.4	it is cheat and good .	St
1.20.1	This member SPAMMED the forums and we left this one post .	St
