&quot;well, if youve followed this thread this far you know that whatever type of hard drive (scsi?)
that a server uses is not going to let me do the standard pc operations&quot; i don't quite understand why formatting a drive and reinstalling a non-server os will not be possible on this machine.
give more details on why this will not work.
