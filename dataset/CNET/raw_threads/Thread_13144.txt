I have been using this computer that I built along with this hard drive for well over three months now (the hard drive is roughly a year or more old and the additional parts are over a year old but I put these pieces together about 5 months ago) and am just now starting to hear this noise. It seems to happen when the hard drive is more active, though it's buzzing has increased. I have my computer sitting open and can tell it is the hard drive due to the fact that when I move it, the noise changes slightly. I have it currently sitting on one end (&quot;face&quot; down, perpendicular to the way it normally would sit) simply because for whatever reason, it quiets down that way. I have noticed a definite decrease in functionality with my computer but I have also managed to get a small string of viruses (so I was planning on formatting it anyways - thank god I already have it backed up) so I'm not sure if it's really the hard drive going bad that is causing the slower system. If anyone has any suggestions, I would love them. I've attempted to look up this problem on Google but really didn't find much information.

When I told the Maxtor tech support my issues with the drive, he immediately suggested that there was in fact, a defect with the drive. So if you have a hard drive that is sending out the same signals, pray that you're under warranty!

The problem went away after the format and it is working well now if this fixes the problem do that instead of buying a new hard drive most likely you have bad clusters and the format will find and mark those clusters. The defective hard drive in my case was my slave drive which was a 40 gig western digital drive my primary drive was a 40 gig sygate drive. I recently build this sempron 3200 computer with 512 megabytes of RAM i was looking for a stable second computer for my sister and it works well. My primary computer is my Emachines 6212 and from now on i'll just buy an emachine instead of building one its just too much time and effort and money and the E-Machines are making better computers ever since Gateway bought them out.
