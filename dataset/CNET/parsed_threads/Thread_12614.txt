<s> I'm looking to buy a new desktop computer and I'm on a budget. </s>
<s> I am not up on the latest processor technology but would be interested to know what is the best bang for the buck in processors. </s>
<s> I'm not into gaming or photo editing, just typical PC applications and web surfing. </s>
<s> I plan to go to Vista so I want to make sure I get a decent enough machine to handle it. </s>
<s> So is there a sweet spot($)in processors that I should look for in a desktop. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> If purchasing a new desktop today, I'd start with an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU. </s>
<s> Entry level CPU is the E6300 (2MB L2 cache). </s>
<s> The E6600 fits my definition of a CPU sweetspot (4MB L2 cache). </s>
<s> It is the cheapest with 4MB cache, which translates into a nice performance bump. </s>
<s> Spending more money on the offered faster clock speeds doesn't give as much a performance bump. </s>
<s> Check the CPU CHARTS at TomsHardware.com for performance scores. </s>
<s> Now, tomorrow the sweetspot will be.... </s>
<s> unless you're going to build the pc yourself, a specific cpu alone does not guarantee you'll get a pc suitable for you use. </s>
<s> still, since it seems you just want a good entry-level general-purpose pc, make sure it includes a dual-core processor (athlon x2, pentium d, or core 2 duo). </s>
<s> the price differential between them and a single-core processor is minimal. </s>
<s> also, avoid sempron or celeron cpus which are cut-back (some would say crippled) versions of other cpus. </s>
<s> the extra $100 (perhaps even less) for an entry-level dual-core is well worth the money. </s>
<s> See Tomshardware.com for CPU performance comparison. </s>
