1.1.1	I am in the market for an external hard drive , USB 2.0 to be exact .	St
1.1.2	I am wondering what is the best way to go about it .	St
1.1.3	Should I get one that is already put together like the Maxtor or should I make on by buying an external case and HD .	St
1.1.4	Is doing it on your own stable ?	Ques
1.1.5	Is it reliable ?	Ques
1.1.6	If you can help recommend solutions like what brand of case and hd or whatever , Id appreciate it .	St
1.1.7	Thanx in advance .	St
1.2.1	Shop the sales at BB , CC , FRY 's , Newegg , pricewatch.com etc .	St
1.2.2	The first one I assembled the 2nd one was pre built they both work .	St
1.2.3	Get one that has a good rebate .	St
1.2.4	John	St
1.3.1	I recently purchased two USB2 only enclosures from Newegg for 34 bucks each ( free shipping too ) and had no problems .	St
1.3.2	These were plain ( no neons ) aluminum boxes and are made fairly well .	St
1.3.3	When the drives fail ( and it 's when and not if ) , I should be able to replace them easily .	St
1.3.4	I think I saved a bit by going this route .	St
1.4.1	I have an older Maxtor 40 Gb USB drive that just went .	St
1.4.2	The USB port was working but when I removed the HD and put it in one of my PCs to check , it was n't recognized .	St
1.4.3	I tried a new replacement Maxtor 40 ( I do n't know the interface protocol ) but it 's dead behind the port .	St
1.4.4	So I guess there 's some interface rules that have to be observed .	St
1.4.5	Maybe , the Maxtor USB will only work with select Maxtor HDs .	St
1.4.6	So get the rules first .	St
1.4.7	Like which class of drives will work , and hopefully will be available a year or two from now .	St
1.5.1	I recently bought a LaCie 80GB external USB 2.0 drive from Buy.com for $ 85 and have been pleasantly surpised with its quality and performance .	St
1.5.2	If you have Windows XP it is just plug and play .	St
1.5.3	It has a FAT32 format but can be reformatted to NTFS in about 20 mins .	St
1.5.4	Also , it has an off/on switch which is convenient .	St
1.5.5	All documentation ( manual ) is on the CD .	St
