Hi, Can somebody help me please, I have a Toshiba PX1265SE-1G16 external hard drive, it has onspec regen in stalled on what I think is a virtual drive, the only problem is is that when I enter the password for the drive, it says that the drive is enabled but when I go to my computer, it is only showing up as a cd drive with only 19.7 mb.
the drive itself is 200gb.
I have loads of pictures and files on there which i do not want to loose.
can anybody help?
Is there a way of removing the virtual cd drive, thus allowing me access to my files?
I am running windows 7 on a Samsung NC10.
thank you.
