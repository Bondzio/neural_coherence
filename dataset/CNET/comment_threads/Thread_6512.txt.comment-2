power and generate as much heat as the newer CPU's One MUST get that heat out of the case, as well get some dynamic movement of air througout the inside of the tower, none moving air is an insulator and things such as the hard drives and things near the top of the case get too hot with no moving air.
I will only use a case with a Top exhaust fan.
and a side intake fan as well as the normal rear exhaust.
