1.1.1	I am looking for an inexpensive router that can push output to a Barracuda Networks appliance.	St
1.1.2	I have a cluster of Access points that get DHCP from a router/switch.	St
1.1.3	Traffic then goes through the router to the Internet.	St
1.1.4	I want to push traffic through a router to the proxy appliance and have had little luck finding routers that list being capable of anything related to proxied Internet ports.	St
1.1.5	It may be wishful thinking but I don't want to spend the money on a high end router with a good IOS, and ACLS.	St
1.1.6	Any suggestions would be appreciated.	St
1.2.1	Since I've never heard of a port being used as such for the gateway (gateways are usually just the IP address) I've subscribed to see how this plays out.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	The feature you want cisco calls WCCP.	St
1.3.2	I am not real sure but I bet your proxy appliance supports this depends on the exact model.	St
1.3.3	It will dynamically intercept the traffic from the router.	St
1.3.4	Of course you can do policy routing based on ports but it is a pain.	St
1.3.5	To go cheap your best bet is a older cisco router.	Sug
1.3.6	Something like a 2621 has 2 fast ethernet and are well under $100.	St
1.3.7	The wccp feature is in ios 12.2 and later.	St
1.3.8	Now a 2621 will not pass anywhere near 100m so you may need larger but it is the same software.	St
1.3.9	There are linux based routers that can do a lot of this too.	St
1.3.10	It is the cheap way to do it if you are the hacker type.	St
1.4.1	Thanks bill012, that definitely looks like the route to go after reading up on WCCP	St
