<s> Hey guys, I just bought a new 250GB hard drive for my computer and I installed it as my slave drive, I already have a 40GB hard drive installed as my master. </s>
<s> I installed my new game (resident evil 4) onto the new hard drive (F drive) everything worked fine. </s>
<s> I played the game for a couple minutes but then I decided to update it because apparently the game is 100x's better if you update. </s>
<s> My issue is... </s>
<s> When I go to update the game, I save the download onto my old drive (C Drive) and when I click run, the program does not read that my game is located on my F drive and it says that the game is not installed, it's only reading whats on my C drive. </s>
<s> How do I make it work? </s>
<s> PLEASE Thanks, Travis PS: I'm running Windows XP if that helps? </s>
<s> That is strange. </s>
<s> You can see both drives in My Computer? </s>
<s> Does your BIOS see both drives? </s>
<s> is this a SATA drive? </s>
<s> I'm sure you have rebooted and tried installing the update again. </s>
<s> Windows Should be able to know that you have another drive? </s>
<s> Create a folder on your F drive....call it TEMP. </s>
<s> Download the update. </s>
<s> When it asks where to save it to....point it at the F drive temp folder. </s>
<s> After that's done. </s>
<s> Navigate to the F drive temp folder and run the updater. </s>
<s> i tired both but it still does not read that the game is on a different hard drive. </s>
<s> thanks for trying tho </s>
<s> Possible that the update installer is looking for the game on drive C. If this is true you may have to contact the games Mnf for a work around. </s>
