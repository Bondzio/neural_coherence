I have an Epson CX3200 and I use compatable cartiridges the colour reproduction is darker and has a blue hue.
This also applied to using Epson full price cartridges.
I have looked at the printer advance settings but am a bit scared to fiddle.
Can anyone help at all I would be most grateful for any advice.
