That was his original point that he need a N router and a G router that he could not run both on the same device.
Those instructions for the bridge mode are pretty close.
In effect you just turn it on bridge mode.
You want your N router to do nothing other than convert the wireless signal to ethernet and pass it to your current internet router.
The issue I had doing this was it took me a while to figure out how to get back into the router.
Your N router will learn a management address from your G router over the copper.
Make sure you set the N router to be able to be managed from the wan port which is normally disabled.
They you will need to either dig though the DHCP table on the G router and find the address you assigned to the N router or just guess until you get the address.
