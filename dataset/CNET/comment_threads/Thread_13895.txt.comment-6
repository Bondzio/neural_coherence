Sine you mentioned you replaced the old PSU 6mos.
ago you maybe experiencing a 2ndary problem.
The final act of a dying system.
I can't guarantee the new PSU will fix it, it's just a course of action to take when the system won't power-ON.
All too often when a burnt PSU as you say, it could very well weaken or stress or outright take another compoment or device with it, if not now, later.
try: www.badcaps.com for examples.
YES, a bad caps situation can be corrected, but only if you're capable and/or allow a local source to fix it.
If outside repair, it maybe more practical to just buy another mtrbd.. for money better spend.
