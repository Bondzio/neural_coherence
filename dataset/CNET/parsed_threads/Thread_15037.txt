<s> I have a Compaq Presario 6000 series with a 1.6 GH Pentium 4 processor. </s>
<s> My CD-RW drive just flopped so I might as well install a DVD-RW drive. </s>
<s> Could someone recommend a good drive that will work with my computer, or tell me how to figure out what the requirements are for my computer? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You didn't tell what software you have to work with but those 30 to 40 dollar internals you see at newegg.com or geeks.com should be fine. </s>

<s> What do you mean by software? </s>
<s> Burning software? </s>
<s> Besides the drive. </s>
<s> I don't need more software so I just get the drive. </s>
<s> I have about 4 or 5 different DVD burning programs I just need to know what type of drive will work with my computer as far as plugs fitting, processor requirements etc... </s>
<s> You want an IDE DVDRW drive. </s>
<s> The type you see for 27 to about 59 bucks tops. </s>
<s> You have your software and there are replacement softwares for free. </s>
<s> There is no more you need to look at here. </s>
