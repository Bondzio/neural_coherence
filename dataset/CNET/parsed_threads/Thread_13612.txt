<s> I have a minor problem with my monitor that I hope isn't a sign of a larger issue. </s>
<s> Every so often the screen will flicker slightly. </s>
<s> Not flicker completely but just a dim flicker. </s>
<s> I was trying to figure out what could be causing it when I was able to recreate it by pressing on the plastic bezel at the bottom of the screen right around where the buttons are. </s>
<s> It sends a flicker up the monitor screen when you squeeze on it that looks identical to my problem. </s>
<s> I don't know a lot about LCD monitors but should I contact Acer before my warranty expires or is this common? </s>
<s> The thing was relatively expensive so if it is on the way out, I need to take advantage of the warranty. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>

<s> FLICKER BE GONE! </s>
<s> I have a new external Acer X183H 18.5&quot; monitor I'm using with a 6 month old HP/Compaq &quot;Presario&quot; laptop. </s>
<s> I've had a similar problem with constant monitor flicker when my laptop is plugged into an AC outlet, but discovered the flicker disappears completely when the laptop is unplugged and running on battery. </s>
<s> I changed the refresh rate from 60 Hz to various alternates available on my pc: 59Hz,70Hz,73Hz,75Hz, as I'd read that sometimes this will cure flicker. </s>
<s> But it did absolutely nothing to fix my problem. </s>
<s> But today I found a simple suggestion on another site that fixed my flicker problem completely. </s>
<s> It seems electrical interference caused my flicker, and the interference was apparently created when both units were plugged into the same power bar and wall outlet. </s>
<s> As someone elsewhere suggested, I simply plugged the laptop and monitor into 2 separate wall outlets instead. </s>
<s> It worked like a charm! </s>
<s> I now have my laptop plugged into a power bar connected to one wall outlet, and my external monitor plugged into another one, connected to a 2nd wall outlet. </s>
<s> What ever interference existed before that caused the irritating flicker effect is finally gone! </s>
<s> Here I was expecting I might need to buy new cables, new adapters, or who knows what else...But all it required was the simplest of simple fixes! </s>
<s> Yippeeiohkayay. </s>
<s> Bobb999 You are my hero. </s>
<s> While knocking on wood, this change seems to have fix my problem completely. </s>
<s> Even better, I didn't have to buy or build anything and didn't even have to move my components around to improve the feng shui Thanks! </s>
<s> Fixed my problem too, thanks! </s>
