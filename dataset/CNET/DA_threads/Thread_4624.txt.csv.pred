1.3.1	I work at a historical society and use a couple of portable USB-powered scanners ( Canon , Xerox ) with a laptop to do just as you say .	St
1.3.2	Either brand and others can be had for & lt ; $ 100 .	St
1.3.3	By the way , scan black and white photos as full color , not greyscale , to get a good quality scan and be sure to save as TIF files .	St
1.3.4	You may want to scan at 600dpi as well to get the best image .	St
1.4.1	The publisher requests that the color mode be set to grayscale 8-Bit -- so we will probably follow that direction .	St
1.4.2	What are the models of Canon and Xerox scanners you are using ?	Ques
