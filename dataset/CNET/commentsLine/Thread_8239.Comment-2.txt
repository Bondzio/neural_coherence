wireless accesspoint router with mimo or pre n system.. look in linksys, d-link, belkin etc.... (need compatible wifi adapter to get max range) or better antenna or amplified antenna please note on range expander... it should be place between (somewhere in the middle) the accesspoint and the computer.. not near one of them...
