a way to eliminate other problems is to connect the drive directly to the motherboard via sata cable, (by removing it from the enclosure) and then boot to your setup (bios) and see if the drive is recognized there.
if not, don't waste time with all these other 'tricks' as you will increase the chance of damaging your drive and the data on it.
you will most likely need professional help.
