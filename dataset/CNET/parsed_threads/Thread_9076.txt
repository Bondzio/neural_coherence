<s> I have an HP Pavilion notebook that has issue with playing audio. </s>
<s> Whenever I play music or view content with audio the sound stutters occaisionally. </s>
<s> The problem is more likely to occur when I am opening a program, which leads me to belive that it's a memory issue, but I have a 256 in there already. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Also, my battery now only lasts for 15-20 minutes or so when not plugged in. </s>
<s> The machine is about 1.5 years old, is this normal? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> No reboot needed and it's documented at http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx If it is this issue, that will cure it. </s>
<s> If you do not perform the procedure, please tell why. </s>

<s> Thanks for the suggestions, Bob. </s>
<s> Switching from DMA mode to PIO only and back didn't seem to do anything for my audio problem. </s>
<s> Any further suggestions, or did I not performed the procedure correctly? </s>
<s> Thanks, MAtt </s>
<s> It's sometimes hard for me to understand why the steps are not followed. </s>
<s> Either someone flips it back and forth then OKs it (that was not the procedure) or they were rebooting at each step (again, not in the procedure.) </s>
<s> It's in the noted web link so if you are unsure you followed the steps, just read it one more time and do the steps exactly as written. </s>
<s> Next up? </s>

<s> Drivers. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> No spyware. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Scan the machine with HOUSECALL. </s>

<s> The steps seem to indicate that I should switch modes and tehm switch them back. </s>
<s> Is this incorrect? </s>
<s> I tried once more to no effect. </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
<s> It said to change the mode, OK it. </s>
<s> Then change it to DMA, then OK it. </s>
<s> If you just switched it and back, the procedure doesn't work. </s>
<s> It's all in the details and if you could... </s>
<s> Either write you did it exactly as described or wrote your exact steps I could call this step done. </s>
<s> As it stands, I'm not sure you completed the procedure. </s>
