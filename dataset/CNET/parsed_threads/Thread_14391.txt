<s> I'm trying to retrofit an older computer (6 years old) to be my link to the internet for my TV. </s>
<s> I like to watch some Hulu shows. </s>
<s> What video card would you recommend for just plain old TV (HD) viewing from the internet? </s>
<s> I'm running Windows 7 Pro on this machine, I have 3 Gig of Memory, and 500 Gig of hard drive space. </s>
<s> Processor is a 2.25 gigahertz Intel Pentium Dual with an IP35 Pro mother board, 3328 Megabytes of usable memory. </s>
<s> Any video card that meets this 2 requirements would be fine: 1. </s>
<s> It fits in your 6 year old PC (PCI, PCI-E x1?). </s>
<s> Have a look in your motherboard manual. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> It has HDMI output. </s>

<s> If I understand right, you plan to connect via the WWW and stream the Hulu to your TV acting as a monitor. </s>
<s> If so, then you need any video card that has HDMI connection port. </s>
<s> the go to video card is a ATI 5450, with at least 1gb and HDMI port. </s>
<s> It's a good fir for many older PCs, but you do have to consider a possible PSU upgrade as it needs at least 400W rating, though what you buy should provide the required wattage needs. </s>
<s> Google for that model as various vendors offer it. </s>
<s> But, any newer video card of at least 1gb and HDMI port will do, IMO. </s>
<s> As alreasy stated if you get into heavy video demands and get a top end video card, then you have replace the PSU to a better suited one for needs. </s>
<s> If you plan to get free HDTV which in turn becomes probable &quot;dual duty&quot; HDMI connection, then look at some TV tuner card. </s>

<s> As your requirements are pretty basic, you can do with an entry level graphics card. </s>
<s> For that matter you can go for this inexpensive NVIDIA GeForce GT210 With 1 Gig of memory, it should be enough for your multimedia usage! </s>
