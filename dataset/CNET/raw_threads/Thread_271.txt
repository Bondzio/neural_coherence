I know I have to match up the Series, such as Athlon or Sempron, socket type, and front side bus. Anything else? Also, I'm accustomed to Intel processors, but AMD processors always seem to either give two numbers when it comes to the front side bus or just one Hyper Transports number. What numbers do I have to match up to make this work? For Intel processors, their cores are named such as Allendale, Conroe, or Cedar Mill. What do these names mean? Also, why is there such a huge difference in price between an Intel Core 2 Quad and Core 2 Extreme? Both have 4 cores and comparable ghz speeds.
