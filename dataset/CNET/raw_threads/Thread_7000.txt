Maybe some sort of device or extension thingie? Thank you for taking the time to read and/or respond to this. Guesswho

You could however check if any installable cards offer that option to an empty slot and provides any support s/w if applicable. The only HDMI item that even comes to mind to output is for HDMI TV setup. Thus, if you plan to replace or upgrade the video card/port, look for HDMI as a port. A quick google for GT-610 should provide some idea. The messy way of doing this would be some USB adapter setup. As for your current PC, the manual should readily explain what it can or can't do. You didn't offer what you have, so little given to fully answer you question other than basic generic answer. tada -----Willy
