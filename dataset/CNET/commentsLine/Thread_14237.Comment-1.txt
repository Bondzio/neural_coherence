ok, i'm a new computer builder.
i've always been tweaking computers, whether it is installing new ram, new hard drives, installing operating systems, so instead of buying a dell like i usually do, i figured that i'd just build my own and save some money.
but i need some help.
first of all, which brands are the best for the following?
1. case 2. processor (i'm pretty sure i want intel from what i've read about) 3. motherboard 4. video card ( 5. ram memory 6. hard drive (sata or ide) 7. lcd monitor also, i'm not looking for budget parts/brands.
i'm a light gamer, like the sims 2, starcraft, warcraft iii, rollercoaster tycoon games, i will eventually buy starcraft 2. also, i do some small photo editing.
suggestions for brands, types, sizes of the computer parts would be awesome.
