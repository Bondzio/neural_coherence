I 2 have 3com 5500g switch and I installed new transceiver which is 1000BASE-LX SFP 3CSFP92. How many LC connector do I need to buy? is it recommended to have 2 for transmitter and receiver or it is being fused? please guide me. thank you.

It has 1 strand for transmit and 1 strand for receive. You want to cross transmit to receive, most cables you can very carefully swap the pair at the end. What you need is a dual strand LC-LC cable the proper length. I assume even though you have LX SFP you are going a short distance so you can use multimode cable. If your question is do you buy 4 SFP and run 2 connections between the switches for redundancy then you get even more questions since you must have configurations to allow for it. If you are running a fiber within a building it is very unlikely it will ever fail. The failure for fiber is that someone physically breaks it. When you look at fiber redundancy you must run the fibers in different paths since things that break 1 fiber tend to break all at the same time.

Buy what you call a fused cable which is called dual strand in most sites. The ends can be unsnapped and swapped very easy if the orientation is not correct... generally most companies they are crossed on short cables just like you need.
