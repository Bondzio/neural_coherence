That iBook will only take the Airport .11b (original) card and does not have the physical connections, or space, for the .11g Airport card.
There are a number of USB Wireless adapters out there but, as Bob pointed out, their performance can be a little short of steller.
I don't think that any major speed gain would be made by spending extra cash on an external Wireless card for this device.
I think you will find the speed adequate for normal web surfing and email P
