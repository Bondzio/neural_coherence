reformat -- you would only reformat if you want a larger partion (bigger then 15gb).
and really you could do this with out formating.
restore--?
how old is your computer?
i don't think there is a way in windows to restore it to the orginal setting?
reload-- reload is the best bet if you want to start over.
you well loose everything on your c drive.
but most people do this to keep windows running smooth.
but your problem seems to be size.
i had an 80gb hard drive that was split with 20 and 60 gb.
i was running out of space (tried to do video editing).
finally i bought a 320 gb hard drive for like $80 (at the time) and re-partitioned my 80 gb.
i lost everthing on my d drive (the 60gb) (moved what i could over to the 320) and now i run fine until my next build.
i still kept all my windows settings.
