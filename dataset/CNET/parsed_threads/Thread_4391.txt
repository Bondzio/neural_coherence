<s> Hello everyone, My Logitech MX 518 went bad, I sent it off to be replaced, while waiting I bought a Logitech wirelss M, 325, I used this for about a week, I had my MX 518 plugged into a usb to ps/2 adapter, when I installed the wireless I uninstalled the ps/2, Now I got my new replacement mouse a Logitech G400, So I plug it in the usb slot where the wireless was, and playing a old game Quake 3 Arena it engages left ,click, which is the fire button, and stays pressed for a little bit, it's not constant it happens every few presses though and sometimes does not even fire when you change to a new weapon, so i uninstalled the HID compatible and rebooted and it set it up again but didn't change anything, So I thought I would simply go back to the ps/2 slot using the adapter but now it does not recognize it to install it, even after reboots and even safe mode, I go to add new hardware and can not find the ps/2 compatible to install it. </s>
<s> Any suggestions ? </s>
<s> WinXP Home SP3. </s>
<s> Maybe how or where to get the driver, or how to install using the add new hardware wizard, whatever. </s>
<s> I've found the native PS/2 and USB mouse drivers to be fine. </s>
<s> However not all USB mice can plug into those USB to PS/2 convertors. </s>
<s> Once in a while you'll find folk try that and wonder why it fails. </s>

<s> I have always found the basic/ generic drivers to be fine also. </s>
<s> I have never installed a logitech driver, all my mice have always worked great, how ever in this case, it does not work properly in the usb and does not work anymore in my ps/2 port with the adapter although all my other mice have, what I would like to do is either figure out why it is messing up the left click usinbg usb, see when playing tha game q3 arena as I explained it keeps firing, I cna even type a message, it will stop then hit enter to send my message and it keeps on firing, OR find the ps/2 compatible mouse section of the mouse and other pointing devices in my add new hardware wizard, IF I can do that the ps/2 port just may work again. </s>
<s> Unfortunately the was Logitechs replacement for the MX518 which could utilize a ps/2 port, this G400 can not. </s>
<s> I ASSumed... </s>
<s> But I do still have this sometimes not firing and sometimes stuck left click issue. </s>
