Proffitt	12/24/11 7:55 AM	1.3247133E12	I think Skype or the Skype forum has you covered.	http://www.ehow.com/how_8489855_connect-blueant-q1.html http://forums.techarena.in/vista-hardware-devices/720475.htm There are too many tutorials and blogs about this. It's a shame the detail or step you had trouble at was not shared. Bob
