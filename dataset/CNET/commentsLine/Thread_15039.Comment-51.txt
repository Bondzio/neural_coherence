without quotes the command to blank a drive is &quot;dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda&quot; if the drive you want to blank is sdb then substitute sdb for sda.
in the original post i reversed the syntax by mistake.
if (means the file or device you are writing from) &quot;if&quot; just stands for input file of (means the device or file that you are writing the input to) dead simple and really reliable like most great stuff.
i always use dd before i sell an old computer with a drive and no os installed.
silly as it sounds an old scsi drive that i once purchased at a used computer store actually had all of a dentists patient files on it unencrypted.
fortunately i am not the type that snoops, but the so called windows it guy that sold off the computer parts should have known better!
