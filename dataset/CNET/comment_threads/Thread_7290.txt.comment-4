That's actually the same router I have but, it's down stairs in my basement.
In my backyard(about 40 feet through 2 walls and a brick wall away)I get a weak signal with my mom's laptop.My Desktop is upstairs on the other side of my house about 40 feet away and it's wired.I used the adapter that paired with the router before I wired my desktop.
The only reason i'm wanting to extend the wifi reach because i'm geting a smartphone soon and wanted to make sure I could connect throughout my entire house even a distance from my house.
If I can use that spare adapter to increase the range can you tell me how?
