Today we use 80 CONDUCTOR IDE CABLES (see google.com about that) and both drives are jumped to Cable Select.
Even a 2000 era PC should have that cable and use those jumper settings.
The CDROM is never a CDROM DRIVER issue.
When you install the motherboard drivers, the CDROM works.
Same for USB.
Which leaves the soundblaster.
Google is your friend here.
The soundblaster drivers are a bit too easy to find.
