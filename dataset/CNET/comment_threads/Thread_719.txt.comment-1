I have a wireless network set up at home, and secured it with a key code.
The router is a Belkin, running windows xp .
I added the security lock to my daugherts Gateway nootbook(wireless)xp also, and now she can not access anyother wireless connections except the one at home.
On my Dell notebook I can go to the ControlPanel and under the Wireless Config.tab I can remove the security lock with one click.
On the Gateway,there is no Wireless Conf.tab in Control Panel.My problem is, how do I remove or unlock her computer so she can access Wireless connections when she is away at college.Any help would be appreciated.
