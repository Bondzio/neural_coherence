<s> Hey there, I recently bought an &quot;entry-level&quot; tablet running on Android 4.1 and when I try to connect to my home wi-fi router it says &quot;Saved, secured with WPA2&quot;. </s>
<s> Then I click on the name again, and for about 2 seconds it tries to cennect, but then I get the same &quot;Saved, secured with WPA2&quot; and it's not working... On the other hand, when I used a wi-fi hotspot on my Android phone the wi-fi worked just fine. </s>
<s> So, any of you know the solution? </s>
<s> What should I edit in the router settings? </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> None at all. </s>
<s> I'd re-review the router settings and share what you can. </s>
<s> I'd also test this at a free wifi hotspot and if it fails there, this one goes back. </s>

<s> First of all thanks for yours answer. </s>
<s> Second, I opened the router settings again, and I'll share the pictures to let you see what are the current details: http://puu.sh/43pVt/665ae848b2.png http://puu.sh/43pVT/b12027fd65.png </s>
<s> In your first picture I see you didn't enter a WPA2 password in your router. </s>
<s> It's blank while it should be from 8 to 64 characters. </s>
<s> Then tell your tablet to use the same password. </s>
