you will not believe my experience because i am a dinosaur!i first knew about &quot;the beast&quot; in 1967 when i was part of a sales team using e.d.p (electronic data processing) department coding every sale item,customer account number,delivery instructions,and cost pricing,together with technical data.
ironically i was made redundant due the upgrading and direct input.it never rained, but it poured, as i was offered a job with the international reference exchange on data entry inputting.that ceased when microsoft me 2000 came in.however i bought microsoft's &quot;x p&quot; soon afterwards, and an email allowed me to continue gathering information for business use.
