hello, okay, i have this old pii pc (soyo 6ba mobo) and i was using it to format/erase some old hard drives before discarding, when an old maxtor drive i had hooked up made this singing sound and when i restarted i got this message after a good post: &quot;your program caused a divide overflow error (if problems persistst,conctact vendor etc)&quot; this message occurs whether i use a win 98 startup in the a drive or using the win 98 on the hard drive.
i am going to toss this machine and sell for parts anyhow but was curious as to what this is.
thanks!
