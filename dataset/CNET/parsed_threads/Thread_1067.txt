<s> I want to clear up an old subject. </s>
<s> My friendly computer techie told me I was doing the right thing to limit my software to Windows compliant and stay away from anything that starts with an 'i'. </s>
<s> I am still scared of iTunes, I'm so happy with my music storage, playing and management using WMP - I'm talking about maybe ten years - using things like Dell DJ (obsolete) now using Zune and buying an HTC aria phone because it has HTC sync which will sync Outlook with no problems or weird accounts. </s>
<s> NOW I am drooling at iPad 2 WIFI only. </s>
<s> Would someone give me an honest, clear critique about my attitude and my fear of iTunes? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I have wide experience with both macs and pcs, going back many years. </s>
<s> More people use itunes than any other music syncing program and there is a good reason for that. </s>
<s> It works. </s>
<s> Microsoft has published so many software horrors that I am astounded anyone still takes them seriously for anything except windows. </s>
<s> As you mentioned, there is Outlook, microsoft activesync, the windows mobile device center, internet explorer and other programs that can be flat out nightmares. </s>
<s> I have spent uncounted hours on the internet trying to find a solution to syncing problems with microsoft products. </s>
<s> Now, I am not really a big fan of itunes. </s>
<s> I hate the way apple controls the way you can use their software and hardware products. </s>
<s> But no one can deny that, for their stated purposes, the products work. </s>
<s> Bottom line, itunes does a good job with media librarys and is more reliable than most.' </s>
<s> The settings interface could be better, like only a few months ago I found out that when I copied my CD's for my iTouch & iPad I could do it in a higher bite rate. </s>
<s> The software updating is dumb, it is just mostly a new install so unlike most other programs that just install the new parts, iTunes you have install the whole thing, luckily there maybe only 1-2 updates a year. </s>
<s> It does saves all you presets but sometimes things get lost, I have lost many songs ( not big deal since I also own the CD's) & one time all my videos got lost, just had to find the folder then import the folder, fixed. </s>
<s> Just like everything else back it up to a USB HDD. </s>
<s> I worked for 35 years in the business world is why I am married to Windows. </s>
<s> I don't wan't iTunes to touch my music. </s>
<s> First off, I don't like popular music. </s>
<s> I download MP3s from Amazon, mostly listen on my PC playing thru my stereo. </s>
<s> I have tons of copied music from old audiotapes and new CDs. </s>
<s> I listen on my Zune to music and audiobooks - a few videos. </s>
<s> I read books on my Kindle. </s>
<s> The only things I would like on an iPad which are on my desktop are email, pictures, documents, writing program, games. </s>
<s> If I had an iPad, could I e-mail myself stuff (using house WIFI) without a need for iTunes installed on my desktop or laptop? </s>
<s> Does an iPad come with an email program? </s>
<s> I admit total ignorance of this new medium. </s>
<s> It has all the big ones & you can import the odd ones. </s>
<s> You do need iTunes to register it, do updates & back it up. </s>
<s> I have had my iPad since the 2nd month it came out & have only hooked it up to my PC 6 times, the 1st to register it, onetime for an update, the rest to back it up & transfer stuff from my PC to my iPad. </s>
<s> What does your post have to do with iTunes? </s>
<s> I have never bought a MP3, I buy the CD & then transfer them. </s>
<s> What does not liking &quot;popular music&quot; have to do with iTunes, YES there's a lot of junk out there that is &quot;popular&quot; but at lease it is not as bad as the early/mid 90's with all those boy bands, that was a dark time in music history. </s>
<s> Why so anti iTunes? </s>
<s> No program is prefect, it is not that big of a file, it does bogs down my old 3ghz P4 2gig DIMM XP Pro laptop SOME but not to the point I can not use the Internet, just I can not say use iTunes & Google Earth with 2 or 3 windows open at the same time, it does not lockup but it is sloooow. </s>
<s> Sure you could email your stuff but Apple's new USB encryption system has broke about every software I knew of for sending stuff to the ipods/iphones/ipads. </s>
<s> You may try email but jumping through hoops is not fun after the first few times. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My post had to do with what your post is talking about. </s>
<s> Causing problems on my desktop computer if I buy an iPad - meaning I would have to install iTunes and put up with things I would rather not put up with. </s>
<s> Not just with music but because it is the basic software that runs iPhones and iPads. </s>
<s> When I installed iTunes many years ago at the advice of the kids in the office this happened: Music sounded terrible played with iTunes. </s>
<s> Several times a day people tried to access my computer. </s>
<s> I began to associate popular music with kids chitchatting all day long and swappping stuff. </s>
<s> (I chitchat too, on Facebook, but never about the song of the day.) </s>
<s> It was right after the era of Napster which I thought was kind of fun until I discovered I could easily convert music I already had on other media to MP3 or WMA. </s>
<s> And CDs got cheaper. </s>
<s> And Amazon came along with 99cent tracks. </s>
<s> So I think my answer is going to be the same: wait for a WIFI-only tablet which is just as good as iPad2. </s>
<s> I certainly don't need one - it would be a toy and I don't want iTunes messing up my 'serious' computer. </s>
<s> You confirm my doubts. </s>
