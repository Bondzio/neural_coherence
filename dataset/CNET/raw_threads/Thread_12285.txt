First of all i have basically no experience with Wi-Fi, I have a &quot;CREATIX 802.11g Wireless Adapter&quot; Its a PCI card. With the sony PSP you need a wireless access point to connect to, i am running windows XP home edition (which doesnt help things). Basically i(we) need to know if this type of PCI card can be used or do we all need to buy wireless routers . Again thanks for taking time to help, from me and from all the people needing help at www.psphacks.net! Dooba
