1.1.1	I am trying to link up 3 of my computers to a 4-port hub .	St
1.1.2	The first two computers are running Windows XP Home , ( First , Dell , P4 2.4ghz 40gig , 300gig external , 512DDR , Second Compaq P4 1.8ghz 30gig , 256RAM ) .	St
1.1.3	The other one is a bit older ( AMD K6333 , 30gig 128RAM ) , and is running Windows ME ( Which I know from past experences is a pain in the butt to network ) .	St
1.1.4	The problem is , network wizard on the Dell does nothing .	St
1.1.5	I run it , restart , and suprise ... .. nothing has happened .	St
1.1.6	On the Compaq I set it so that my main dial-up connection can be shared with my other two computers , but the other two computers dont even see the network to begin with !	St
1.1.7	On the windows ME computer I truely dont know where to start ...	St
1.1.8	I got some advice from a friend who told me to dump the hub and get a Switch ( I belive thats what its called ) He said that it would be alot easier .	St
1.1.9	Would that help ?	Ques
1.1.10	I 'm kinda at the end of a burning rope here .	St
1.1.11	ANY help would be good help .	St
1.1.12	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Most home networking problems can be boiled down to a few things : 1 ) Bad hardware : including a defective hub/NIC/cable .	St
1.2.2	If the lights on the hub/NICs are lit then the hardware is likely good 2 ) Incorrect software settings : a ) Workgroup names are different , should be the same .	St
1.2.3	b ) File and print sharing is not enabled ( more likely with ME then XP ) .	St
1.2.4	c ) XP built in firewall or some other firewall is enabled ( likely ) .	St
1.2.5	Note : switches are better then hubs , give up the make and model of such to verify that 's what you have .	St
1.3.1	All one needs to know is buried at http : //www.wown.com and http : //www.practicallynetworked.com .	St
1.3.2	But worthy of note is that the top two items I see cause instant setup woes is a firewall ( XP has ICF which people have difficulty locating to turn off ) and others load a firewall before they get their network up .	St
1.3.3	As to switch/hub , both would work .	St
1.3.4	However , neither would be how to share an internet connection via a DSL/Cable modem ... Bob	Ques
1.4.1	The hub will be fine until you get a dsl or cable internet connection .	St
1.4.2	The other computers wo n't be able to use the internet unless the Compaq is connected .	St
1.4.3	Make sure the NIC 's are on and are connected to the hub .	St
1.4.4	Check your network settings on each PC .	St
1.4.5	& quot ; File and Print Sharing & quot ; must be selected .	St
1.4.6	& quot ; TCP/IP Internet Protocol & quot ; must be present and selected .	St
1.4.7	Be certain file sharing on the harddrives you want to share is activated .	St
1.4.8	Good Luck !	St
1.4.9	Ciao	St
1.5.1	Have you even networked anything before ?	Ques
1.5.2	You do n't mention the brand of hub ( and model # ) , whether you are trying to & quot ; Internet Connection Share & quot ; or if you are a dial-up or broadband/DSL subscriber .	St
1.5.3	The switch is definitely a better choice , but a combination hub/switch is even better , and provides more flexibility , especially for a new person to networking .	St
1.5.4	Are all your computers in the same & quot ; Workgrooup & quot ; ?	Ques
1.5.5	And do you allow them to share files , folders , and printers ?	Ques
1.5.6	Home networking is simple , and painless , especially if you are using ethernet cabling , and not trying to do it wirelessly , which is easier with XP Professional , but can be done by a novice with some difficulty ( 3 out of 10 scale ) .	St
1.5.7	Get your & quot ; friend & quot ; to bring his idea of hub/switch or switch over and start with the two computers on XP first .	St
1.5.8	Forget about ME until you can make to two talk/intercommunicate first .	St
1.5.9	Good luck .	Polite
1.6.1	One thing I have n't seen covered- make sure that all the NICs are set at the same speed or to auto- and if auto or 100 mips , make sure that hub can handle it .	St
1.6.2	Other than that , the # 1 cause I have seen with hubs is that each machine has to have an IP assigned and not 'get one on it 's own ' , as IIRC that takes a DHCP server- unless the ICS proxy handles that , followed by something as simple as not typing in 'workgroup ' the same way on each .
