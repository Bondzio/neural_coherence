<s> I was given an older Gateway laptop with an Orinoco Wireless LAN Card built in. </s>
<s> I have updated the driver so that I could use WPA. </s>
<s> I have a Belkin Router G and a desktop and an iPod connected. </s>
<s> I get great connection speeds with my other devices through my DSL connection, however, the Gateway laptop is getting less than dial up speed (17k) I am sure it is some kind of setting/tweak. </s>
<s> Please provide me with any advice. </s>
<s> THanks. </s>
<s> You gave the slim version of the details. </s>
<s> First, is it setup per our forum sticky? </s>
<s> Some enable AP ISOLATION, disable SSID, try MAC filters and end up with slow speeds. </s>
<s> Sometimes its the firmware in the router or someone is running P2P on the other connection. </s>
<s> The story is much too light here and I can't ask all the questions. </s>
<s> Let's let you tell more. </s>

<s> Sure, the details are that I have no idea what MAC filtering is, the SSID is enabled, and I have no idea what AP Isolation is. </s>
<s> The firmware in my router is current. </s>
<s> The laptop has 512MB of memorty and an Intel 4 M at 2.18Ghz. </s>
<s> The Orinoco driver is updated and it shows connected as if it were 11Mbps. </s>
<s> Additoinally, I cannot access the other computer on the network from that laptop. </s>
<s> When it does appear, I get an erro stating that that computer is unaccessible and i may not have permissions. </s>
<s> Contact administrator. </s>
<s> I am not a uber geek, please talk to me like I'm four.LOL </s>
<s> That's right. </s>
<s> Mixed mode on the router can be fickle. </s>
<s> But you didn't confirm if the setup was per our forum. </s>
<s> No word about security, the channel you tried and the details. </s>
<s> -&gt; If you don't want to know networking go find NETWORK MAGIC (see google.com) It's very good for us that don't want to find why it didn't share. </s>
