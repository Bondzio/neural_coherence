<s> Hi everyone, thanks for taking time to read this! </s>
<s> First of all i have basically no experience with Wi-Fi, I have a &quot;CREATIX 802.11g Wireless Adapter&quot; Its a PCI card. </s>
<s> With the sony PSP you need a wireless access point to connect to, i am running windows XP home edition (which doesnt help things). </s>
<s> Basically i(we) need to know if this type of PCI card can be used or do we all need to buy wireless routers . </s>
<s> Again thanks for taking time to help, from me and from all the people needing help at www.psphacks.net! </s>
