i believe it is a mobo issue.
motherboard is a msi pm8m-v chip is a celerond 2.93 ghz have installed 512mb ultra ram pc 3200 have tried numerous cdroms by different makers.
first try to install xp pro, i'm advised in a blue screen of death that the acpi button is not comliant and i should update the bios.
1. i have updated the bios from version 2.0 to 2.2. i used the manufacurer's website and am sure i have used the correct drivers.
2. i also disabled the acpi options in the bios.
i've disabled all the onboard items, tried moving midway through the ''d'' files the installation slows to a crawl and the installation program claims it cannot ''find'' file driver.cab.
if i try again it will not be able to ''find'' another file in the same section.
3. i have tried different cd-rom drives to get around this issue.
it always crashes about the same place.
4. i've tried different installation disks and different operating systems types.
no luck.
even my knoppix (linux on cd) cd hangs.
5. i've moved cables, the ram, reset the bios, tried diffrent parts.
nothig is working.
basically my bag of tricks is empty.
the bios posts just fine, i just can't get any os to isntall.
any ideas out there?
