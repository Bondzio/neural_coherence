hey, alright so i've been having this probelm for awhile but now its really not working.
the first time it happen was when i restarted my computer one time, it just shutdown and didn't turn back on, then it wouldn't turn on.
what the computer does is the power light turns on, i can hear my fan getting a lot of air.
the probelm is, my computer has a huge fan so it doens't always run at full speed.
just when it starts up for about 2-3 seconds, then if it gets hot.
when i turn on my computer and i get the probelm my van just keeps sucking in air.
its like my computer is working fine and it turns on, but its only working right for abut 1 second.
after that second it like freezes or something it just sits there.
my lights turn on, my dvd rom trys reading my cd's, but my montior just stays black.
the computer some times after awhile turns on normal, but only after i turn it on and off many times, each time it always a differnt # of times, and this time it wont just turn on.
if any one has any ideas please thanks -mythraz
