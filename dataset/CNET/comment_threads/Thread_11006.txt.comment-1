Can someone tell me what's involved in replacing a currupted bios chip on a motherboard?
Is there any special tools that are needed.
I have a SOYO KT333 Dragon Plus motherboard that I tried to update the bios on, and it has appeared to have failed.
I can't get my system to boot up.
I even tried resetting the bios using the reset jumper on the motherboard, but this did not work.
I have ordered a new bios chip from Soyo.
I'm just wondering if this is something that I could probably do myself or if I'm going to need to take it to a professional to do.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
