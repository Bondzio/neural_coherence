hey all, lately i've noticed a very weird problem on my monitors.
i have random pixels that are strangely coloured all around the screen, things are still visible.
i am fairly sure it isn't dead pixels as my main monitor is very new, and when i play my xbox 360 through it, it doesnt seem to occur, i have uninstalled and reinstalled different video drivers and it has had no affect.
my specs are as follows.. xp sp2 evga nvidia 7900gt/ko acer 22'widescreen and if you need any other specs dont mind asking.
