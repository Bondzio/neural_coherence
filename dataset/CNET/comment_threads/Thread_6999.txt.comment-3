It's a marriage arrangement, that they have to be in par with each other for optimum output.
If you can find a Geforce with increased ram of 128 or better of the same type video card, that's your best chance.
YES, you will need to increase the system speed(cpu) to keep up with one of the newer cards.
However, you can throttle down a new video card with its setup s/w for a less demanding but certainly better than old output.
Check their support website for details.
Also, newer AGP video may outstrip(added connection) the power supply as now they require 30W+ where as older units are 20-25W range, take that into condiration.
good luck -----Willy
