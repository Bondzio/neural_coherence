1.1.1	Hi , last week I findally had time to assemble my pc like I did it in school before , to be sure I also checked my mainboard manual , when I press the on/off switch on my power supply on the back of my computer and then I press the powerswitch in front of my case , nothing happends , only the leds are burning , the first time when I did this , I heard the air coming out in the back of my pc , but it went out after 1 min , and now I never getted that again and nothing happends except for the leds burning My leds are working so I do n't think my mainboard is fried and my dad thinks there is something wrong with the power supply , it 's 350 watt btw .	St
1.1.2	Anybody got an idea ?	Ques
1.1.3	De computer -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Amd Sempron 2600+ K8N Neo3 ( agr slot+pci-e en pci slots ) 512 MB Ram pc 3200 corsair 120 gb hd maxtor Sapphire Radeon 9600 pro DvD Writer van Benq	St
1.2.1	Is this your motherboard : MSI K8N Neo3-F ?	Ques
1.2.2	If so , there are two problematic areas noted in RED .	St
1.2.3	RED ITEM ONE : What is the voltage rating on the memory module ( MSI says 2.5V is compatible ) ?	Ques
1.2.4	What voltage setting does the BIOS have for the memory ?	Ques
1.2.5	RED ITEM TWO : Although the MSI compatibility list for the AGR slot is probably incomplete , the Sapphire 9600 Pro is not on the list of tested compatible cards .	St
1.2.6	If you can , I would consider returning that board for one that is known to support your card or has a standard AGP slot .	St
1.2.7	Maybe get a motherboard that has less issues in general .	St
1.3.1	Remove all HD and CD drives , use only the floppy for now .	St
1.3.2	Have a bootable floppy and upon booting enter the bios and be suree no CD & HD present , save and exit out .	St
1.3.3	Reboot and try to boot from FD .	St
1.3.4	If it actually boots , you have power issues , your psu is too weak or lacking .	St
1.3.5	Further , repelace with a decent namebrand and be at least 400W+ or better .	St
1.3.6	Of course recheck all connections , ect .	St
1.3.7	and teardown to see that no shorts are present , DO N'T TAKE ANYTHING for granted .	St
1.3.8	Reseat all cables/harnesses/wiring and be 100 % sure that 's where it goes .	St
1.3.9	Also , you you see any video display at any time during boot-up , even before the problem came up ?	Ques

1.5.1	I have no fdd , and it does n't give any power at all , I used a voltmeter and it gave zero 's .	St
1.6.1	No voltage , then how are the LEDs lit ?	Ques
1.6.2	It seems some of the psu 's voltages are kaput , replace .	St
1.6.3	But , please reduce the system as I explained in the previous message .	Sug
1.6.4	You can always add the devices later .	St
1.6.5	Since , this is a new build , again recheck the work and make sure no standoffs are shorting the mtrbd .	St
1.6.6	backside , etc..	St
1.6.7	If you checked the psu w/o the mtrbd .	St
1.6.8	attached , understand the psu needs a & quot ; load & quot ; in order to turn-ON .	St
1.6.9	There are ATX psu simple testers yes/no condition .	St

1.8.1	Is psu the same as cpu ?	Ques
1.8.2	My cpu is given in my first post .	St
1.9.1	I 've tried your tip and it did n't work , my mainboard says also a minimum from 350watt and not 400 , ( using 350 now ) .	St
1.9.2	I 'm just going back to the shop saturday , I still have 2 years of warranty .	St
1.10.1	& quot ; If you checked the psu w/o the mtrbd .	St
1.10.2	attached , understand the psu needs a & quot ; load & quot ; in order to turn-ON .	St
1.10.3	There are ATX psu simple testers yes/no condition. & quot ; What you mean by this ?	Ques
1.10.4	It needs a load ?	Ques
1.10.5	And how I do that .	St
1.11.1	The psu is a & quot ; switching power supply & quot ; , the load is simply the mtrbd .	St
1.11.2	attached .	St
1.11.3	If you test with no mtrbd .	St
1.11.4	or no load attached , the psu is n't capable to turn-ON .	St
1.11.5	I usggested an ATX type tester as it 's safe to use .	St
1.11.6	There is a trick , but I wo n't do that for a novice , safety issue IMHO .	St
1.11.7	But google for such if you like , up to you .	St
