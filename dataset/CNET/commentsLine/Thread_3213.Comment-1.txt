hi, before i start asking questions, here is what i am currently working with: -------------------------------- 800 mhz powerpc g4 (powermac4,5) ---- no airport or any wireless hardware installed os: 10.4.5 -------------------------------- however, to make things more complicated, within the next month or so i will also be running a lenovo thinkpad laptop (not exactly sure which model).
my problem is, i find it almost necessary to upgrade from my current comcast cable internet to wi-fi.
in the fall i will be going away to college and i'll be going back and forth between campus (which has wi-fi) and my house.
i will be doing all of my work on my laptop since my powermac will be staying home with my family while i live on campus, so i need a convenient way to also work online here at home on my laptop.
but, i am completely clueless on how to.
i've read the forums and seen a lot of talk about airport.
do i need to buy this?
can't i just be like everyone else (*cough*windowsusers*cough*) and go to best buy and buy a wireless router?
(such as  ) my point is, i want to make this as easy as possible while still maintaining a decent connection between both computers.
i could probably just unhook my mac from the cable modem and connect my laptop to it, but i don't feel like doing that everyday, i don't want to have to go through comcast tech support and software installation, and i don't want to be stuck in my home office with no work space.
sorry if i confused anyone, but i really need help before i go out and purchase anything.
any suggestions would be appreciated p.s.
: whatever the solution may be, i need to be able to access the internet from at least 1 story above where i am now
