My apologies, here are my system specs: Operating system: Windows XP Professional sp2 Motherboard: MSI 865PE Neo2-P (2004) BIOS (as per original, not updated) Hard disk: Seagate Barracuda 80G SATA (2004) Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 80G SATA (2005) Quantum Fireball 20G IDE (2002) I am now running on the IDE HDD because basically it is the only drive detectable by my pc.
