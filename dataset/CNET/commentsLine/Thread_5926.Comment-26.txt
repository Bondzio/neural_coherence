have handled the 40 conductor ribbon cable recently you may not note the difference.
they both use the 40 pin connector.
they added 40 ground wires spaced between the signal wires to approximate a ground plane.
this is to reduce noise, crosstalk and reflections due to the faster rates that data moves to and from these drives.
the individual wires in the ribbon cable are obviously smaller in diameter ids the 80 conductor.
trying the ribbon may be worth a try.
i had heard reports that some of the round ones are not as good as the ribbons with the fast drives.
i have a friend that was having problems, and changed back from round to ribbon and the problems seemed to have gone away [they had been intermittent bad data].
