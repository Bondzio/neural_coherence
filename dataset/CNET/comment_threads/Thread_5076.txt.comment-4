That XP knows nothing about SATA drives or drives larger than 127GB (until SP1.)
There are very long discussions about that and it matters about the PC make, model, SATA drivers and more.
The details are missing in your post so try filling in the missing details.
There is also a BIOS setting the matters but let's NOT change that until you know you can recover from a disk wipe out.
