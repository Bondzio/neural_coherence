<s> I am planning to buy this netgear router NETGEAR N600 Wireless Dual Band Router WNDR3400 the description of this route says i can get a combined thruput of 300 + 300 because it is a dual band Now my laptop has got an intel centrino Advanced-N 6200 wi-fi adapter. </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com/products/wirele...6200/index.htm the description of adapter says it works in dual band and will give me 300 max throughput. </s>
<s> Question: Can I configure this adapter in laptop to work in dual band and get 300+300 max throughput ? </s>
<s> I have yet to find anyone achieve this since all the adapters or on 2.4 or the other band. </s>
<s> Not both at the same time. </s>

<s> In my laptop, I can see there is an option to set my intel wireless adapter to either 2.4 or 5 or multi-band If I were to change to multi band and use this router, shudnt i get 300 + 300 ? </s>
<s> But why not try and convince yourself? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I've seen such seek one or the other but I fear you think it will do both at the same time. </s>
<s> A short course in the design would be needed to explain why, beyond the simple answers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It doesn't really matter because you won't even get the 300 in the first place. </s>
<s> Besides the fact that no home user has 300m internet wireless technology is half duplex. </s>
<s> So to your question, there is no standard defined for the bonding of 2.4 and 5 channels into a single stream. </s>
<s> This means if this ability even existed it would a be a proprietary thing which would mean both your nic and your router would have to come from the same vendor. </s>
<s> If you want to write your own drivers and firmware it is technically possible I suppose. </s>
<s> You could in theory also get 2 completely separate lan connections up if your PC nic allows this, the router more than likely does. </s>
<s> But now you have the larger issue of how to use 2 lan connection at the same time. </s>
<s> This is the how do I run 2 internet connections question that there is no good answer for. </s>
<s> The radio is on one band or another. </s>
<s> Not both. </s>
<s> At least that's what the spec sheet said. </s>
