i've gotten a new motherboard, but i'm concerned the damage on the video card may damage the agp slot on the new board.
any idea if that would occur?
the agp card does obviously have issues.
it runs stable (for whatever reason) in a board, i'm just concerned of possible overheating/further damage being caused by the card.
the original damage was caused by the board.
