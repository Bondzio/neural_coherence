9121	0	536679	5180361	NR	Shea6892	8/4/11 9:27 AM	1.31245002E12	Upgrading Video card	So I am currently running a Dell XPS 410 desktop with these specs: --Intel&#174; Core&#8482;2 Quad CPU Q6600 @ 2.40GHz --4 GB RAM --NVIDIA GeForce 7300 LE --OCZ Vertex 2 / 500GB HDD -- Everything else is stock. I want to upgrade my video card because it is realllly outdated. I was wondering what is a decent video card that will fit and not break the bank to hard. Thanks to anyone who can help.

These factors all come into play in selecting a video card. For general help about upgrading, I suggest visiting this site which has lots of helpful information and links: http://www.upgradevideocards.com/ One of its pages specifically addresses the items to consider in choosing a video card: http://www.upgradevideocards.com/criteria.html But the other pages should be helpful too. If you are looking for a quick solution, check out the article at THG that lists the best video cards at different budget levels, including a brief characterization of its performance, and links to its reviews: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2964.html The HD 5670 recommendation by Bob B is a good choice in its budget range. Note that he is consiedering your PSU which is an effective upper limit on how powerful a card your system will handle. With your 375w PSU, you can also handle a little more power - and more expensive card - like the GTX 560 - if your budget will handle $175: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130660 Here is a review that descibes the card and provides benchmarks that will show you its performance. Note that the page on power usage shows it - the total system - using 295w for video card based on the standard reference design and 325w when overclocked - which is about all you would want to put on a 375w PSU. http://www.anandtech.com/show/4344/nvidias-geforce-gtx-560-top-to-bottom-overclock/10 But answer the above questions and people here can provide more specific advice.

For a budget I am thinking around $100. There may be a little wiggle room but probably no more than $120. My monitors resolution is 1680 x 1050. Thanks by the way.

9121	6	536679	5180931	5180727	R. Proffitt	8/5/11 8:37 AM	1.31253342E12	That's a tough one. Here's what I've been doing.	Since stating a minimum PSU never is a good spec I use a 20 buck Watt Meter. I put the machine up on the Watt Meter and look at the readings at idle on the Windows screen then a few games. Then I can figure out if we are in trouble. Most PSU's are about 80% efficient so we know the Watts on the AC is that far off. To see if we are in trouble I use 50% of the PSU's rating and don't want the Watt meter to exceed that. This gives the PSU some head room. ONE LAST CHECK is the Amperes on the PSU rail check. You find the video card's amperes and make sure the PSU rails can support that. Here's the problem. Most techs and owners don't want to do this work. Bob

Then, if you consider the common advise and buy a better PSU to begin with, money better spend. As techs already know the cure is a better PSU, it's passed on to the user. Now, it's up to the user. IMO, working with budget minded users tends to bog the decision too much on cost alone. But that is where it falls. Plus, if the box says, you need X-watts to run the GPU, you need X-watts. tada -----Willy

I think I could fit upgrading to a slightly bigger PSU and a new Video card such as the GTX560 into my budget but then will I have to upgrade the cooling in my computer? I just have the stock fans in there but as of now it stays very cool. Also wondering if there is a limit on power supply wattage on the motherboard. Thanks guys for the help by the way.

9121	12	536679	5198286	5198225	R. Proffitt	9/5/11 3:33 PM	1.31523678E12	I can see where folk are confused.	I have yet to see a 6pin associated with the motherboard. This is usually a power supply lead with a &quot;6pin&quot; power plug. In theory and so far I can put PCIe 1.0 into 2.0 slots and vice versa. Sorry that they don't explain that well. Bob

Cos it says that my motherboard is PCI-E 1 and that card requires PCI-E 2.0 or 2.1.Thanks.
