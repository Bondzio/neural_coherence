1.1.1	Hi .	St
1.1.2	I have an HP Pavilion zd8000 , and all the specs I could find on the Internet indicate that it should have a Dual Layer DVD-RW drive , but no site indicates whether it 's optional or standard for the computer ( I assume optional ) .	St
1.1.3	I seem to remember getting mine with a Dual Layer DVD-RW , but I just stuck in a DL disc and it could n't read it .	St
1.1.4	Is there any way to figure out whether it 's a DL DVD-RW or just a normal DVD-RW ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Get the model number of the DVD drive from DEVICE MANAGER and Google it .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	I also have a zd8000 , and there 's a really easy way to tell .	St
1.4.2	If you look on the side of the computer with drive ( should be the left-hand side ) , there should be 3 icons on the drive door .	St
1.4.3	The first one ( towards the back of the computer ) should be the DVD symbol , the middle one should be the CD symbol ( says & quot ; disc & quot ; ) , and the one towards the front should say & quot ; RW & quot ; .	St
1.4.4	Underneath the very front one , it will say & quot ; DVD+R DL & quot ; in very small letters if you have a double-layer drive .	St
1.4.5	I believe it came standard on all zd8000 's , but I 'm not sure .	St
1.5.1	Found it !	St
1.5.2	Thanks .	Polite
