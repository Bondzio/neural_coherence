the odds of an external hard drive failing when the hard drive you need to reinstall your backed up data to has failed is so remote that it shouldn't be a concern.
run your external hard drive until it fails or shows signs of failure.
then replace it and do an immediate back-up.
best of all situations is when you have a desktop and a laptop that you use.
i update each computer from the other by flash drive.
then at back-up time i back-up one, then restore from back-up the other.
which leaves me with three identical drives.
if one of your computers has a second hard drive then before i do a back-up i use the old back-up to place an older back-up on that extra hard drive.
then overwrite the external hard drive with the new back-up.
that way i have three copies of my data plus an older version on that extra internal drive just in case something has recently corrupted my data.
the time between back-ups should be enough time to discover if my data has become corrupted.
one thing i do for further protection is to keep my external hard drive in a fire safe.
for the paranoid a second external hard drive with alternating with one kept in a safe deposit box at your bank should satisfy the most paranoid.
but even with that i cannot see any value in replacing a hard drive before it has failed or shows signs of failure.
