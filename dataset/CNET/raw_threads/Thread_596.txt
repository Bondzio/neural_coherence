His mother purchased a Dell notebook a few months ago and it would not start this morning. She rang Dell CS number and was answered by a person with Indian accent. He was talking fast and hard to understand. After a few minutes, he told the lady to get a screw driver and open the case and see if we can work things out. What is Dell thinking?

They overnighted the drive to me and I replaced it the next day. Imagine how much time if I didn't have the option. Cheers, Bob
