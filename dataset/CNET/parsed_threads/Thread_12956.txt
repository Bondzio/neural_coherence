<s> Hi guys, My drive gets corrupted and unreadable repeatedly and it's driving me nuts. </s>
<s> I was never able to format this hard disk successfully through disk management or the command prompt window. </s>
<s> So i ran the HITACHI Drive Fitness Test (disk in good condition), had the disk erased, and used Maxtor's Maxblast to partition and format. </s>
<s> But now whatever files i transfer into this particular drive gets corrupted instantly. </s>
<s> It either doesn't play or open fully. </s>
<s> And after moving some files into the drive and restarting a couple of times, either of the follow messages shows when i attempt to access the drive: - The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable - The disk structure is corrupted and unreadable I'm not worried about recovering the data now... i just want the damn drive to stop getting corrupted/unreadable/unstructured. </s>
<s> Anyone know what's wrong? </s>
<s> How old is the PC and the MB BIOS ? </s>
<s> How big is the HDD ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Oh tks for reminding me to check my bios mate! </s>
<s> Turns out the cause of it was an outdated bios... really appreciate the help man. </s>
<s> Have a nice day ^^ </s>
<s> feedback, we'd never have any idea of the outcome. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
