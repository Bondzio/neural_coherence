<s> A window appears stating that the printer can not communicate with the computer...ALL OF A SUDDEN!!!!! </s>
<s> last printed from a file 2 days ago now this. </s>
<s> Contacted Lexmark for 1 1/2 hours today and they could not fix. </s>
<s> Told me my printer was not compatible with Windows 7. </s>
<s> Why all of a sudden? </s>

<s> Can not afford a new printer. </s>
<s> Please be specific!! </s>

<s> Did you system restore to the day it worked? </s>
