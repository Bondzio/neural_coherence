I just got a new Dell XPS 410 with the E6600 Processor, 2 GB RAM, Nvidia 7900GS Video Card, etc...Has anyone added another 7900GS successfully without changing the power supply? What exactly is needed to run an SLI set up. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Also, would the performance increase warrant doing this upgrade? Thanks!

If there is no mention don't expect to become one later. You need to visit the Dell support website and look up your model or S/N#, enter it and see what your order was fulfilled as. Again, no SLI mentioned, not SLI ready. SLI, needs extra power and the similar dual gpu cards to have SLI operation. Of course the mtrbd. must support all this.

So far the Geforce one says my card is compatible, but need to find out if the mb and power supply are. If anyone else has some experience using SLI on their XPS 410, please let me know! Thanks

Alternatively you cold open the box and check for PCIe slots...if there aren't two...Sli won't be an option for further consideration regardless of the PSU issue. VAPCMD

8307	6	228332	2422885	2374385	VAPCMD	3/6/07 7:19 PM	1.17320874E12	If you looked at the system docs BEFORE buying	you'd have realized the XPS 410 has only one PCIe 16X slot, one PCIe 4X slot and one PCIe 1X slot. All things considered, it's not what I'd call a good host or candidate for SLi. The message is . . . . read before buying. Much easier to read before buying and avoid the wrong purchase, than to buy and regret. These docs are just too readily available and accessible to make such errors. VAPCMD

I have a dell dimension 410 and have upgraded the psu to a 500W, you have to find a dell compatible one though and they are sold through pc power and cooling (a subsidary of ocz) here http://www.pcpower.com/products/power_supplies/dell/
