1.1.1	i got an old Pentium 4 hyperthreaded, and when i run any of the three standard torture tests in prime95, my cpu processing tends to stay at approximately %50.	St
1.1.2	it jumps higher for a millisecond or so once in a while, but it tends to stay at 50. shouldn't it be at %100?	St
1.1.3	ive noticed this tendency in other applications as well.	St
1.2.1	You can run 2 instances to make it go to 100.	St
1.3.1	if i try to do that it automatically closes the new one	St
1.4.1	read this for an explanation: http://www.playtool.com/pages/prime95/prime95.html with a hyper-threaded p4, you SHOULD NOT run two instances of prime95 since you don't have 2 cpus.	St
1.5.1	I used to do that with the old SETI program on my HT and it worked fine with more results per hour.	St
1.5.2	I guess prime95 is a different beast.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	prime95 is.	St
1.6.2	launch 2 of them on an HT p4 and it will be next-to-unusable.	St
1.7.1	The idea was to get it to max out the CPUs and since I was not at the machine, just what I wanted.	St
