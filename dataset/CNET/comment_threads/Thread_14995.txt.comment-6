Thanks.
I had searched but not found the answer to my specific question.
My needs are low and they'll stay low - I'm not a user who'll be wanting to install fancy graphics cards or high-power items.
Pretty much the basics will be installed and that'll be it.
As long as having more &quot;just in case&quot; isn't going to result in wasted power, I may end up getting a higher wattage unit, but I didn't want to get it if all I was doing was getting a power hog for probably no benefit.
