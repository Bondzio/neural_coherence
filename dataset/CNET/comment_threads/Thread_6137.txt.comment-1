hi, i am thinking of getting a new buffalo router with the options of 3 wi-fi networks however i was wondering would this add alot to the internet traffic more than a single network.
i will have 4 computers on this router 1 on 1 network 1 on another network and 2 on the last network how will this affect my traffic if altall ?
