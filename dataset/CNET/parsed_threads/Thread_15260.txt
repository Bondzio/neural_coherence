<s> I am writing about my mother's computer. </s>
<s> I don't know the specific model number, but I know it's an HP Pavilion desktop. </s>
<s> She has the in-home warranty with Best Buy/The Geek Squad. </s>
<s> Well, her internet went out, and The Geek Squad determined that her network card is bad and needs to be replaced. </s>
<s> Of course, they ordered the wrong part and he's coming back this Saturday to replace the network card. </s>
<s> My mom asked if there was any way to access the internet in the mean time, and he told her to purchase a USB wireless adapter for that purpose. </s>
<s> Well, she purchased one, I attempted to install it, but we are not having any luck. </s>
<s> My question is: is it possible for this USB wireless adapter to create an internet connection if her network card is not working properly? </s>
<s> I'm under the impression that this adapter is to connect a computer to an already existing wireless network, not to create an internet connection on one computer where no internet connection is available. </s>
<s> I'm very confused. </s>
<s> We are only talking about one computer; there is no network, no laptop, no other desktop, etc. </s>
<s> We have a Linksys router that we used years ago to set up a network when I had a laptop and still lived at home. </s>
<s> They have a new computer now, and the router is not hooked up. </s>
<s> Is there any way the router can be used to access the internet? </s>
<s> Can someone please help me understand? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> you had a cable/DLS modem and connected a wireless capable router to it, the USB wireless adapter would be of use to you. </s>
<s> She has a cable modem, and I have it hooked to the wireless capable Linksys router, but the router is not picking anything up, thus the adapter is not either. </s>
<s> I don't understand how the two can create an internet connection. </s>
<s> On the router, everything is lighting up that should except the &quot;internet&quot; part. </s>
<s> Well, that's obviously because she has no internet connection due to a bad network card. </s>
<s> The adapter installed just like the book said it should, but it's still not creating an internet connection like we were told it would. </s>
<s> Am I overthinking this thing or what? </s>
<s> The wireless feature may be disabled on the router. </s>
<s> You will need to login to the router's admin page and look over the settings. </s>
<s> Visit the Networking and Wireless forum to read the forum sticky. </s>
<s> It's the one at the top. </s>
<s> Set up your router according to its instructions. </s>
