<s> i recently bought 1GB of RAM to install in my PC. </s>
<s> i wasn't noticing any difference in the system performance after installing. </s>
<s> so i decided to check and verify that the PC was seeing the newly installed RAM. </s>
<s> when i checked, it showed that the only installed RAM was the original 512mb. </s>
<s> i ran a few tests, one having just the new RAM stick installed and taking out the others. </s>
<s> when the PC started, it just kept making a beeping noise and nothing came up on the monitor. </s>
<s> when i check the BIOS (i think that's what it is called)it shows the 2-256mb sticks installed but not the 1GB stick. </s>
<s> is this just a case of a bad RAM stick or is there a way i can fix it. </s>
<s> (also, i already check to verify i have the correct type of RAM) </s>
<s> all the RAM sticks must be the same. </s>
<s> Make, model of the parts involved please. </s>
<s> Plus what BIOS version so we can check if that was updated to add more memory support. </s>
<s> Here's the info I have (and hopefully it's correctly type out here). </s>
<s> I have a widescreen monitor and parts of words were cut off, so I hope everything makes sense. </s>
<s> PC - HP Pavilion a630n BIOS Version - 3.04 07/05/04 Core Version - 8.00.10 Memory Bank 0 - 256 mb Memory Bank 1 - Not Installed Memory Bank 2 - 256 mb Memory Bank 3 - Not Installed I installed the new RAM in Bank 3. </s>
<s> As I mentioned also, I had installed it in Bank 0 and tooke out the 2-256 mb RMA and got a beeping noise when I started my PC. </s>
<s> 2 - 256 mb RAM preinstalled on computer by manufacture 1 - 1 gb RAM PNY DIMM RAM PC3200 184 pin Let me know if there is any other info you would need. </s>

<s> Hp and others release these to add support for ram and more. </s>
<s> http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Pavilion+a630n notes DDR PC3200 memory. </s>
<s> So while you have that spec covered lets hope this bios helps. </s>
<s> Be sure to double check if I found the right and latest version for your machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Okay. </s>
<s> I updated the BIOS. </s>
<s> But still no go. </s>
<s> It does not see the 1GB stick. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>
<s> They get calls like this and will reveal if your machine can use this stick. </s>
<s> I didn't comment about some that can't get the stick installed proper. </s>
<s> Have someone try it for you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I'm gonna try and install it on another PC and see if it works. </s>
<s> If it fails there, you want to get it exchanged. </s>
<s> Check the specs and/or manual to see just what ram amounts can be installed. </s>
<s> After all that's what its for. </s>
<s> The manual may show just how the memory can be installed or mixed ram using memory map. </s>
<s> Your 256'ers are being as DDR slots and then placing a single ram stick just isn'y working, though it may if the ram map is followed or using yet another 1gb stick of ram to make a &quot;pair&quot;. </s>

<s> I have a similar problem to the original post in this thread. </s>
<s> I have a DELL XPS 400, purchased oct. 05 with 2 memory cards, 512mb each, in Dimm1 and Dimm 3. </s>
<s> [XP 2000, UltraSmart monitor, nvidia geforce 6800, 32bit OS] Today, I installed 2 PNY DDR2-667-533-400 memory sticks in Dimm 2 and Dimm3. </s>
<s> Total memory after installation: 3 gigs. </s>
<s> [3,0024 mb] I reconnected all cables and booted up. </s>
<s> The computer sounded an &quot;alarm&quot; sound: 2 &quot;beeps&quot;, pause, 2 &quot;beeps&quot;, pause, 2 &quot;beeps&quot;. </s>
<s> The monitor powered up, but no image. </s>
<s> I pushed the status buttons on the bottom of the monitor and received a prompt message saying: No Input Signal Detected&quot;---- or words to that effect, or a message that says: &quot;In Power saving Mode. </s>
<s> Move mouse or hit any key to activate.&quot; Moving the mouse or hitting any key does nothing. </s>
<s> The computer sounds like it is functioning as normal, except for the alarm beeps at the beginning of the boot. </s>
<s> I removed the PNY sticks and rebooted. </s>
<s> Same problem: 6 alarm sounds and no monitor input. </s>
<s> I've listened closely to the alarm sounds, and they appear to be coming from the usb ports in the back [5 in back...2 in front], but I can't confirm that. </s>
<s> Further research indicates that what I am hearing are &quot;BIOS alarm codes&quot;. </s>
<s> I've double checked and re-checked all my hook-ups. </s>
<s> The monitor cable is correct. </s>
<s> All peripherial cables are in usb ports correctly. </s>
<s> any advice or insight to my problem will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> Reseat your video and other cards. </s>
<s> Have someone else that has worked on PCs look too. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Here's what I did: I disconnected the computer. </s>
<s> I removed ALL memory sticks, old and new. </s>
<s> I restarted the computer without the memory sticks installed. </s>
<s> I immediately turned the computer off. </s>
<s> Disconnected the computer. </s>
<s> I installed then new memory sticks into the Dimm slots where the old memory sticks were. </s>
<s> Booted up fine, then. </s>
<s> No beeps. </s>
<s> Monitor works. </s>
<s> Everything [so far] seems to be running just great. </s>
<s> Apparently, my computer will not allow two different kinds of memory installed....despite what the Geek Squad down at my local Best Buy told me. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> &quot;Apparently, my computer will not allow two different kinds of memory installed....despite what the Geek Squad down at my local Best Buy told me.&quot; My hunch is Geek Squad told you technically correct. </s>
<s> Technically-correct vs. reality are sometimes different. </s>
<s> There's some low-level tweaking to be done. </s>
<s> In your case, I'd think sticking with 2 GB what's working is a good approach. </s>
<s> Alright, I took it to my work and put it into one of our PC's and it worked fine. </s>
<s> So I took the 1GB stick out of that PC and put it into my PC at home. </s>
<s> Everything's fine now. </s>
<s> For some reason, that RAM stick just didn't want to work in my PC and I'm not sure why. </s>
<s> They get calls about this hourly. </s>
<s> They know if there is an issue. </s>
<s> I never called PNY. </s>
<s> Since it worked in the other PC and I just switched the sticks, my problem was solved. </s>
<s> It may not have the the right way to get the solution, but it was the one I chose. </s>
<s> If it worked before and only ram was changed and now no video, then return old ram into system. </s>
<s> if the problem persists then somehow the video got disconnected, inspect closely. </s>
<s> Once that's resolved, return new ram back in. </s>
<s> Yes, the beeps refer to a bios error code, find out wht it means to your system, but since no video it pretty much narrows it down. </s>
<s> if the ram you brought was the proper type&class for your system, then it should work once installed properly. </s>
<s> Though you mentioned that you rehecked your work, sometimes the little things do get by, &quot;don't take anything for granted&quot;. </s>
