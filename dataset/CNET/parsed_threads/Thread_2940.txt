<s> of the location, I get the little icon on the RHS corner of my screen informing me that the default network has been detected. </s>
<s> The only place this doesn't happen in at my office since the notebook detects the office wireless connection. </s>
<s> I have netstumbler loaded and it too first detects the network but then disconnects soon after. </s>
<s> Any ideas why this could be happening ? </s>

<s> I found a similar situation with my WiFi laptop. </s>
<s> I had been to another person's house to help her set up some wireless equipment - Linksys in this case. </s>
<s> The Linky equipment comes from the factory with &quot;Linksys&quot; as the default SSID, so we had to work with that long enough to get to the administration pages and change it to something more secure. </s>
<s> However, my WinXP system &quot;remembers&quot; having been to an access point named &quot;Linksys&quot; in case it ever has to associate with it again. </s>
<s> Back at home, there is no such access point, never was (I don't have any Linky WiFi stuff, but that's a different discussion), and none of my nearby neighbors either. </s>
<s> But whenever I take down my primary WiFi network and put up a substitute (for testing and other reasons), the dialog boxes of the wireless zero configuration utility on my WinXP system always include opportunities to re-establish contact with that non-existent &quot;Linksys&quot; access point. </s>
<s> I suppose I could do some down deep and dirty editing of the registry to find and delete that little devil, but it hardly seems worth the risk of turning a working system into a boat anchor. </s>
