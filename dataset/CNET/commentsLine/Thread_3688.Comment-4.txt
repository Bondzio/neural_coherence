would work with your laptop (if your laptop has a wireless adapter) instead of a physical cable (ethernet) connection.
the troublesome statement is: &quot;i had ethernet for quite a while and it suddenly stopped working.
my isp (mediacom) and i troubleshot.
we ended up trying different ethernet cards, different cables, different modems and different pci slots to no avail.
when we switched to the usb it connected right away.&quot; this indicates a problem within either the computers networking hardware/software or the modem.
the prevalent cause of lost connections is some type of viral/spyware/malware infection which if not cleaned off will eventually come back to haunt you.
