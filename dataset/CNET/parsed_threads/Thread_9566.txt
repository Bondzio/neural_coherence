<s> I've been having some trouble with my wlan lately so I try to upgrade the firmware on my DI-524 I've downloaded the new version off dlink marked march 2009, when I apply it my router claims upgrade was successful and restarts but I still have the old firmware marked april 2006. </s>
<s> Anyone have any idea what's wrong? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I found out, seems they made two versions of the 524, on named b and one named g, I used the wrong firmware, fixed now. </s>
<s> Tks for reading. </s>
