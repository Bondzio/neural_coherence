1.1.2	Computer: Gigabyte MB, P4 3.0Ghz, 1x 512MB PC3200 DDR, 128 MB Radeon 9600 graphics card, 400 Watt Pwr Sply With a cold machine, from start-up, the system goes through the bios configuration checks, and begins loading the O/S from the HD, it then simply shuts off!	St
1.1.3	Sometimes when it is running, the system would just freeze, and I have to do a hard restart to turn it off, and then the shorting-out ensues.	St
1.1.4	There are no error beeps when the system is turned on, I checked the MB battery (just checking everything) it was fine, the system is not overheating I've kept the case open and even blew a house fan into it (system temps were mild also), as far as I can see, the MB does not have direct contact with the case that would cause a short.	St

1.3.2	My greatest suspect is the power supply, so I'll replace that first, if not the issue, onto the MB, if not the issue, onto the....	St
1.3.3	I mean, I'm up to suggestions on how to trouble-shoot it before I completely re-build it.	St
1.4.1	The first one is about picking a wattage size.	St
