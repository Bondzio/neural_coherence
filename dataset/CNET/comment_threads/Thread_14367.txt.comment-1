Hello -- I really want to upgrade my old PIII 700mhz dell computer.
I know that most I can jack it up to is 1ghz, but that's fine.
My issue is that my computer uses a 100 FSB, and the 100fsb model of the processor is more rare (and expensive) than the 133mhz.
Can I put a different FSB-speed CPU in my computer?
?
