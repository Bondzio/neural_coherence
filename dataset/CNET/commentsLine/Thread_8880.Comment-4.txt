i read these forums regularly and don't see an extraordinary number of complaints or failures on hp machines....regardless of platform.
most of what i read here is people writing about upgrading the video card or ram in their hps.
so what is your basis for saying ...'their hardware reliability is absolutely horrible.'
?
how many hps have you had ?
aren't a fair number of the hp motherboards made by asus ?
