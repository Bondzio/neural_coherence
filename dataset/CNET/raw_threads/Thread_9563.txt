I'm going to attempt to build a pc, and have gotten some advice so far from friends, but want to make sure i buy the right things, ect. I wanted to stay under $400, and I after adding it all up, i came to $293, which is much easier atm, and leaves room to buy a better graphics card later to replace the onboard one. Plz tell me what u think. Case: Power Up 5511 ATX Mid-tower case w/450watt power supply $50 CPU: Intel Pent Dual-Core E5200/2.5GHz w/fan and heatsink $83 MOBO: Intel DG35EC mobo w/onboard sound and video $80 HD: Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 SATA 80GB hard drive $35 MEM: Kingston 2GB (2x1gb) 240pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 (PC2 6400) Dual Channel Kit Desktop mem. $20 CD Drive: Lite-on PLDS 52x DC-RW/16x DVD-ROM combo drive $25 TOTAL: $293 (all prices are from newegg or tigerdirect) I will use my current monitor until i can afford to upgrade it. I have a 300gb external HD that I keep most files on. I have a decent keyboard/mouse. 90% of this computers usage will be for MMOgaming. Am i forgetting anything or is there anything that is incompatible? Ty for your help =)
