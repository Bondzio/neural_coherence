On opening up it was obvious that one end of the connecting wire to the slim flourescent light tube has broken off. The local Epson Agents refuse to supply me with a spare and instead want the price I can buy a new printer, to do what they call a repair job. Anyone know where I can source a new light at a reasonable cost?

Some revolt against this but there is a second hand parts market on ebay for those that want to try replacing a part. Do not bother asking the makers for parts on printers under a few hundred bucks. You'll waste your time. Bob
