I'm trying to download Smart Script Gold (U.S VERSION) and It tells me I have to buy winzip (30 bucks I don't have at the moment.) Is there any way I can get winzip for free or is there any other way I can download this program completly free ? Thanx

Just the options to unzip or close and when I click unzip it's says &quot;winzip is not found on you computer.&quot; Do you think I'll just have to go head and cough up the money for winzip or what ? Thanx
