1.1.1	Is there a way to boost a wireless signal?	St
1.1.2	My wife and I are living in a basement apartment and our landlady has Clearwire.	St
1.1.3	There is no problem with the computers upstairs accessing the internet wirelessly, but we cant in our place downstairs.	St
1.1.4	I dont know which routers she is using, but I believe that they are connected to her main computer.	St
1.1.5	Also, Im interested in boosting the signal because Im getting the Nintendo Wii system and I know that I can access the internet thru the Wii.	St
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=wifi+range+expander&btnG=Search	St
1.3.1	From my experience with Wifi its not always the range and signal strength that is is problem.	St
1.3.2	I have installed a few wifi networks for family member and found in each case that the house has &quot;dead&quot; zones, where even though I can see the network the data flow between the client and rounter is too 'interrupted' and access becomes very flaky.	St
1.3.3	After looking into these &quot;dead&quot; zones further I found an envronmental problem in each case, for example 1 pc was on the 2nd floor directly above a base unit for a cordless phone, unplug the power from the phone and the network was fine.	St
1.3.4	Another example was where the wifi laptop worked fine in the house but not out in the garden, turns out that the house is rendered brick which means the whole house is wrapped in wire mesh and concrete, no signal is getting through that.	St
1.3.5	You may be better off running a hard wire into your floor then sending the wifi from that point on.	St
1.4.1	There are both repeaters and hi-gain antennas available for many wireless networks.	St
