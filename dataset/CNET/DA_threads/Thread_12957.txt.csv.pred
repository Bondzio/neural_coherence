1.1.1	I 'm in the process of updating my iPad 1 with something newer ; possible an android tablet .	St
1.1.2	I just received my new Kindle Fire 8.9 HD today BUT am returning it unopened ASAP .	St
1.1.3	Made the mistake of reading the reviews after I placed my order .	St
1.1.4	As much as I did n't want to spend the money on an iPad 4 , it looks like I 'll have to spend nearly as much for an Android such as the Google Nexus 10 or Asus TF500T .	St
1.1.5	I 'm so confused ! ! !	St
1.1.6	One has 2 GB of ram vs. 1 , another has expandable card memory vs. none , and there 's a number of processors available ... duel core vs. quad core etc , etc .	St
1.1.7	My iPad just recently started hanging up/shutting off unannounced so I 'm not looking to repeat that experience again .	St
1.1.8	I read where that 's common with both the Androids as well as some iPad 4s .	St
1.1.9	I 'm retired , do n't play games , seldom read ebooks , and am definitely not a power user .	St
1.1.10	What I do is surf the net , check my email , read my Facebook account from time to time , listen to iTunes , watch/listen to YouTube , verify/research facts , and occasionally watch a movie on Netflix .	St
1.1.11	Now I 've read a lot of reviews and since they often conflict with one another , I still do n't know what to buy !	St
1.1.12	Can someone help ?	Ques
1.1.13	So , if I 'm looking for something more utilitarian than the Kindle Fire 8.9 HD , is there a reliable Android tablet out there that does n't cost over $ 500 ? ?	Ques
1.1.14	Should I bite the bullet and wait for the iPad 5 to come out , get my $ 700- $ 800 out , and pretend to be somewhere else when I pay for it ?	Ques
1.1.15	?	Ques
1.2.1	I have the Nexut 7 and a tf300 with dock handy .	St
1.2.2	The GB of RAM is rarely an issue for most .	St
1.2.3	Some do n't like the Nexus because of no card slot , and the tf300 with the dock gets an very long battery time ( over 14 hours ? )	Ques
1.2.4	so the thing you have to consider is YouTube is very different from an Apple/Windows laptop experience .	St
1.2.5	I 'll keep it short .	St
1.2.6	Not everything is shown in the YouTube app .	St
1.2.7	Yes you can find and install some apps to help but I find more and more folk just want to use the thing .	St
1.2.8	Why not a laptop ?	Ques
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your speedy reply I 'm afraid that a good laptop would put me way over my spending limit .	St
1.3.2	I already have a desktop computer so the tablet was more of a convenience .	St
1.3.3	Might a netbook be a good option ?	Ques
1.3.4	The TF700 sounds like a possibility .	St
1.3.5	Unfortunately , if you add the keyboard , it becomes quite expensive .	St
1.3.6	I 'd be more interested in the tablet alone .	St
1.3.7	Also , since I had a stroke my left hand shakes badly .	St
1.3.8	I can no longer touch type like I did during my teaching days ( I was a school teacher before I retired ) .	St
1.3.9	I 'm now a courageous , one-finger typist .	St
1.3.10	LOL As long as the tablet keyboard is responsive , an optional keyboard might be an unnecessary expense .	St
1.3.11	You did n't mention much about the Google Nexus 10 .	St
1.3.12	How does it compare to the TF700 ?	Ques
1.3.13	Since I enjoy listening to music , tablet sound quality ( speakers ) are also important to me .	St
1.3.14	How do the two tablets compare in that respect ?	Ques
1.3.15	This was one of the reasons I was initially drawn to the Kindle Fire 8.9 HD .	St
1.3.16	I use the headphones but after a while they hurt my ears .	St
1.3.17	Finally , I 'm not clear on your reference to YouTube .	St
1.3.18	I did n't mean to judge a tablet based upon how many YouTube apps were available for it .	St
1.3.19	I also do n't use it for tablet app evaluations ; just listening to music or watching the occasional video clip .	St
1.3.20	Again , thanks for helping me !	Polite
1.4.1	And we spent that much on the transformer and dock .	St
1.4.2	The office picked up a Windows 8 laptop Asus K55N for 380 so I ca n't tell what the tablet attraction is here .	St
1.4.3	OK , at home we have a Kindle Fire HD 7 as well and it does great at playing HD on the big screen and the sound is really good .	St
1.4.4	My comment about YouTube is that it 's not the same as the PC .	St
1.4.5	Google has moved to monetize the tablet experience and you might not see some content on the phone or tablets .	St
1.4.6	Some folk get really upset over that .	St
1.4.7	Sorry but as the Nexus 7 is about the same , I thought it was close enough .	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
