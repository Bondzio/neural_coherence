<s> I have an Asus A7N8X-X mobo that I got to set up as a breadboard just to test things. </s>
<s> According to the manual the BIOS offers ten different possible items to boot from. </s>
<s> It allows selecting three, and then the option Boot Other. </s>
<s> My thoughts would be that the other would only include the 7 unselected ones. </s>
<s> None of the ten are USB. </s>
<s> I guess I'll give the list in the event that someone may want it: floppy, LS120, HDD 1, 2, 3, SCSI, CDROM, LAN. </s>
<s> I have a 1 GB sandisk mini cruzer to use. </s>
<s> Might want to run things such as Memtest from it. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Doesn't Windows have to load the USB drivers before the ports can be used? </s>
<s> I think it does. </s>
<s> Jack </s>
<s> I don't really want to have a hard drive on the bread board. </s>
<s> So even if I put a small op sys on the keychain drive, I guess that I could put a version of DOS on it, and the Win 98 type boot floppy programs, I still have a problem. </s>
<s> But Tucson, think about a mobo where it allows booting from USB. </s>
<s> It seems that Windows doesn't get involved during the inital boot. </s>
<s> [I realize that this mobo doesn't mention booting from USB]. </s>
<s> I'll check to see if there is a BIOS update. </s>
<s> I haven't got the CPU for the breadboard yet, really surprised how well the prices on the older AMD XP CPU's has stayed up. </s>
<s> Thanx for your interest. </s>
<s> that I may have to add a floppy to the bread board. </s>
<s> I have seen USB devices that were detected in the startup. </s>
<s> There were several machines with AOpen boards and a SATA RAID controller that could not have any usb device with memory pluged into it, not even a label printer or it would look at it first before the PCI RAID card. </s>
<s> If it can happen accidently, then it is only a matter of time before the it can be repeated </s>
<s> Ray, two items Never tried booting from a USB device. </s>
<s> From my understanding if the M/B supports this feature and the USB device is properly formated the system will boot. </s>
<s> Second what type of CPU (socket/speed) do you need? </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> AMD XP 2600+ 333 MHz for $71.00, thanx anyway. </s>
<s> Using pricewatch, the price range of the AMD XP's, at least, are wild, the minimum price for much slower ones are much higher, and then a higher speed one will be lower. </s>
<s> In most cases the very lowest price was from vendors that had a very poor rating, so I bought from one with a very high rating. </s>
<s> {hopefully]. </s>
<s> I did find a link to an HP site from which one can download the code to make a keychain drive bootable. </s>
<s> Posted the link to a guy in this same forum that wants to convert his IDE drive to USB [have no idea why]. </s>
<s> The article that led me to the HP one was by a guy that used the HP software on a Sandisk Mini Cruzer which is what I have. </s>
<s> However, my mobo's BIOS doesn't mention booting from USB. </s>
<s> However another older MS article regarding the need for the industry to develop othe bootable devices, along with another article, seems to say that at power on &quot;all?&quot; systems look for any device that has int 13h &quot;mentioned&quot; on it. </s>
<s> Of course MS talks only about booting into MS Op Systems. </s>
<s> I want the keychain drive to actually run the computer with a small DOS like utility or two. </s>
<s> Hope that things are still going well with you and your shop. </s>
