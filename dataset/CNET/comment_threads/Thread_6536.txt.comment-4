The AGP has a special power circuit and more.
If I wanted to cut the costs for a special lowball PC, I'd not put those parts on or... recycle a goofed AGP board into such a machine rather than scrap the run.
No one I've met in 30 years of PC design (and I'm around my engineering friends) has ever done this.
