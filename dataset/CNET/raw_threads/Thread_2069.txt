It came with a 10GB HD, so for obvious reasons, I'm looking to increase the storage. I have found a 300 GB ATA/133 that I am interested in, but I don't know if my machine can handle it. Are there maximums for a machine's HD size? Also, before I buy a hard drive, I want to make sure it has a compatible interface. I know my machine works with ATA drives, and this drive says it uses parallel ATA. Is this the same thing? My machine is a HP Pavillion 6630. Thanks in advance! Trish

You should be good to go with the 300gb, but to make sure: What OS are you using? And you are putting the 300GB on the NTFS file type, correct? Sometimes old OS's won't allow or won't recognize the full size of the hard drive. ~Ibrahim

You also need an operating system that supports large HS's. References: http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/capacity/index.html http://www.48bitlba.com/

Some media cameras, mp3 players want USB 2.0 or you will need alot of patience. Read some of your media apps requirements they also may want a bigger system. I have 2 desktops that are 400 mhz they are great for the kids to surf the net and play older games. I won't upgrade the computers. I bought myself a new Computer and they have the older ones.
