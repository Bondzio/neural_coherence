I would check that the BIOS is current, and see what the manual notes for jumpers (if any.)
The usual is that the settings are incorrect.
Since there was no make/model supplied, then you just need to read the manual on what to set for this CPU.
An out of date BIOS will mis-report the CPU so if you have such an issue, fix it.
