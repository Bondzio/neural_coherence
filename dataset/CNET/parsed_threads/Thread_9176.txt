<s> I currently have an HP computer with Pentium 4 2.8 Ghz processor and 1 GB Ram. </s>
<s> I'm looking at this computer - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=5981364&CatId=5138 Can someone tell me if will be faster? </s>
<s> I know the processor speed is 2.5 instead of 2.8 but it is quad core. </s>
<s> I don't want to purchase this if I'm not going to notice a difference in speed. </s>
<s> Thank you, Linda </s>
<s> I have the HP d4999t but with 4.0GB RAM, some Nvidia GT240 video card and well, it's very nice on Windows 7. </s>
<s> This looks to be twice the RAM and a few steps back on the NVIDIA GeForce G210 but that's quite a nice machine to have. </s>
<s> Just ONE NOTE. </s>
<s> Be sure to create those Recovery DVDs as many forget and later they discover why we need those. </s>

<s> So even though the processor speed is lower since it quad-core it should seem noticeably faster than what I currently have? </s>
<s> I am not a gamer and am not concerned about the video card, too much. </s>
<s> I've never had anything except integrated graphics (chip) and only have one program that I think would benefit from a better graphic card. </s>
<s> My d4999t boots and does everything faster than my Pentium 4 dual core machines. </s>
<s> Which are being cycled out. </s>
<s> This new machine should run The Sims 3 just dandy. </s>
