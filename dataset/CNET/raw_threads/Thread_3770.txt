Sorry I missed the printer part.	http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=293378 &quot;A List of Printer Drivers That Are Included in Windows XP (Article 2 of 5) [snip] Epson Stylus Photo 1200 ESC/P 2&quot; As such, you won't &quot;find&quot; a printer driver. Go native. Bob

Can you tell me what the &quot;ESC/P 2&quot; stands for. When I tried to print with this driver through 2000, it also failed to print. I will try again with XP. -Dino
