i have a decision to make soon, in fact before my grandson comes up for the summer.
right now i do alot of genealogy, some desk publishing (business cards and brochures for my small business), manipulate photos with photoshop 5.5. i have a toshiba laptop 1805 and it does the job, except i have to hook up a cd burner whenever i want to cut a cd.
i am set up wireless with a 5mb line from charter cable.
the toshiba is getting old, had to reload it twice since xmas, but i like xp because this is easy to do.
now for the problems: 1. i am a former main-frame programmer, who is frustrated by pc's and all the choices you have to make.
2. i kind of like to sit on my couch and multi-task while working on the internet.
3. my grandson is coming up for a few months, and since he can't bring his ps/3, he wants to play that wow game here.
question: do i really need to get a desktop to satisfy both our needs?
and which machine would you suggest?
i talked to dell because i used to have one, and like the onsite repair they offer.
he recommended a laptop, something about xps, or 1505 for about $1300 + and a desktop for a few hundred dollars less.
i really hate to spend that much at this time, any ideas.
my daughter in texas bought a emachine at comp usa for a few hundred dollars, and is going to add wireless card, new video card and more memory or ram, since i am not that technically inclined and live in a small town in mi, i am not that adventurous .
appreciate any ideas or suggestions, jq
