1.1.1	I currently own a Linksys WPC54G wireless router .	St
1.1.2	I do n't use wireless for my desktop , but I have 2 other laptops in house that use wireless .	St
1.1.3	The router works pretty well , although I occasionaly have to bypass it because a download will freeze up .	St
1.1.4	I assume the speed for my 2 laptops will increase if I upgrade to a 802.11N router , but will see an increase in speed on my desktop since my signal runs through the router ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	If your wireless performance seems acceptable and ISP 's supply is slower than present router 's max ( 802.11g claims 54mbps ) would you expect an improvement ?	Ques
