What happened was I had two different models of the GTX460... An MSI cyclone and a PNY XLR8 (both 1 gig) The PNY one tended to be quite audible vs the MSI due to its heatsink design being different, as well as the heat lvls being a little bit higher, so thats why I decided to change the paste.
It was absolutely caked on both of them, probably more then 4X more than needed when I removed the sinks so it was definately in my interest to do so especially since I use MX4 paste which is pretty good quality vs what the manufacturers use I'm sure
