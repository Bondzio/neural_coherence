It boots perfect wihout the USB drive. The F1 setup has the boot order as; 1. CD DVD 2. HD 3. Floppy 4. Network If the USB is not in the list why does the PC hang? What can be changed to have it bootup with the USB drive left in the USB slot at all times?

Open the USB controllers and find the drive. This from memory, navigate around the Properties and find the interrupt assigned. Change it.

It does not list the USB flash drive, even removing and re-inserting it. The USB flash drive gets its volts from the MB. Could that be a problem? The Ext Usb HD has its own power suply. Thanks.
