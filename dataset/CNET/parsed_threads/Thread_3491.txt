<s> I have a 60GB Maxtor HDD with 2 partitions and ~6GB unallocated space. </s>
<s> One of the partition is running Windows XP Pro, while the other one is empty. </s>
<s> Then I have a 6GB Western Digital HDD with Windows 2000 Pro installed. </s>
<s> This HDD is running out of space - just under 1G left. </s>
<s> Now what should I do if I want that old 6GB HDD to be copied entirely without losing ANYthing, into the 2nd partition of the *new* 60GB HDD? </s>
<s> Is it possible? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> But the OS will no longer function. </s>
<s> I decline to duplicate web content about why this is so but you need the Windows 2000 CD to have any hope of repairing the OS after such a move. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> Even though the new HDD is on the same computer? </s>
<s> Does it apply to Windows 2000 only or just ANY Windows versions? </s>
<s> And should the copying be cloning or imaging? </s>
<s> I'll be very glad if you can recommend me to a freeware or no-restriction shareware of doing that. </s>
<s> Copy, clone, image, etc. </s>
<s> All result in a non-operational OS but at least you didn't lose any files. </s>
<s> Some may demand that the OS work after such but I decline to duplicate all the web pages why Windows fails after such a move. </s>
<s> For your research type CHANGE MOTHERBOARD SAVE WINDOWS at google.com Bob </s>
