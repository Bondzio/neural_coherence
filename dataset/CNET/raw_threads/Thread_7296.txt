It turned out to be a problem in the registry caused by Adaptec Easy Cd Creator. I found the solution (thanks again Bob) and then both drives worked fine- until I installed the update to the Adaptec program so it would recognize my cdr again. Okay, so now the cdr works, but the DVD doesn't. I'm not even getting an error code- the DVD drive doesn't show at all in Hardware Manager. I tried the Hardware Install Wizard- nothing. I tried the same regedit that worked before- nothing. I just watched a movie on the thing, I'm pretty sure its not broken. It is a one year old Sony. Any ideas?

I did nothing to the pc except turn it off for the night...I just turned it on for the first time and the DVD player is working despite being identified as a cd drive in My Computer. THe misbehavior of the dvd drive persisted through many reboots, maybe it just needed a goodnights rest. I wish everything would fix itself. Bob- you mentioned that Adaptect software may be a problem. I know you can't advertise here, but is there a program you would recommend?
