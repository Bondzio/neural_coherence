Does it matter? I know the price difference is insignificant. I am currently using a 8 yr old HP Pavillion with upgraded XP 850 Mhz 256 MB I had ME and it was a complete disaster! I do not want to go through it again with Vista. I guess I need reassurance that it's a good OS or stay with my trusty XP. Any advice?

If you want Vista, get it, if not and far more stable use XP. As for the dual optical drive, you can always add that later, even Vista should you need to provided you went with the XP system. The difference isn't that great and IMHO, you'll be more happy with XP based system. Dell, is also having some problems with Vista itself for whatever reason as least it seems so. tada -----Willy

You may find my posts about &quot;Vista is the new Windows ME&quot; which is turning out to be true for those that have old gear. If you don't have the old baggage then it's usually OK with just a few tweaks (and 2GB RAM!) Bob
