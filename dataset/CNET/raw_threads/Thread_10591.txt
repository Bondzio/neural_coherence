Does anyone have any idea what this is that I am seeing? To my eyes, it appears as a small criss cross pattern that really is noticeable to me. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Make sure you have at least a 600:1 contrast ratio. You'll spend between $300 - $550. There are cheaper ones out there but not for games. and life goes on... Jack ps..Look at CNET reviews for the best ones.

The faster the response rate, the less pixelation and smearing you will see. Aim for 16ms or less. You will pay more for the faster rate. Look at display reviews on gaming websites.
