<s> Already installed latest drivers but still isnt working. </s>
<s> In some systems if we forget to install drivers that does happen. </s>
<s> Also if we install Nero, Roxio and such can cause the drive to vanish (this was not mentioned so it's not that.) </s>

<s> To make sure i did this right i went in to device manger right cliked on my cd/dvd drive and went to teh driver section and clicked on teh update driver button. </s>
<s> If there a different way please let me know. </s>
