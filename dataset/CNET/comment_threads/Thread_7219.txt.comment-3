I just did.
There's scads of support and contact options.
Re transform and lighting for a new card, simply call their sales department.
You can usually con one of them to find the answer for you.
I have always found them to go out of their way to help.
Of course, one cannot start by yelling at them and telling them their stuff is junk as I suspect some others have done, then they complain here about the lack of support.
Not implying that about you in any way.
