i'm buying my pc from singapore, and the cheapest dell xps 8100 costs around usd 1000 (from  and it doesn't even include a monitor.
currently the best deal i found is a dell inspiron 545s, which includes the following specs for a price of around usd 870: intel(r) core(tm) 2 duo processor e8500 (3.16ghz, 1333mhz, 6mb) genuine windows(r) 7 home premium 64bit (english) dell(tm) st2210 21.5 full hd widescreen monitor 4gb (4x1gb) ddr2 sdram 800mhz memory 16x dvd+/-rw with dual layer write capabilities nvidia geforce g310 512mb ddr3 1 yr ltd hardware warranty, inhome service after remote diagnosis integrated 10/100 fast ethernet 750gb serial ata hard drive (7200rpm) w/databurst cache(tm) which is quite reasonable but i'm still looking for options from acer or gateway.
i'll try to consult the local retailers if they can provide me with a quotation for other pcs.
the gateway desktop for cnet's editor choice feb 2010 looks great, but it lacks a discrete gpu (so my question, does a discrete gpu make much difference when playing hd video compared to an integrated gpu?)
and a monitor.
i'm still looking for the best bang for the buck.
