<s> My family owns 2 MacBooks plus XP desk top and Vista laptop. </s>
<s> Wireless setup is provided with an older linksys a/b/g router and Comcast Cable Modem. </s>
<s> The 2 MacBooks have frequent problems printing to the Brother 5250 DN printer, with connect fails. </s>
<s> I have to reset the IP addresss frequently to get the printers to work with the wireless side of the network. </s>
<s> The Windows OS PC's don't experience this problem. </s>
<s> I am at a loss as to why the Macs have this IP problems. </s>
<s> Any hints or solutions would be appreciated from the forum. </s>

<s> For &quot;servers&quot; and printers I suggest these are kept at fixed IP addresses. </s>
<s> could explain further the term fixed IP address. </s>
<s> How do I establish the fixed IP for the Macs???? </s>
<s> thedrifter </s>
<s> Bob was suggesting that Printers and &quot;Servers&quot; have a constant address. </s>
<s> The computers on your network do not really need a static IP address. </s>
<s> However, if you have one computer that all the others share files from, then it would be beneficial for that computer to have a Static IP address. </s>
<s> An address that remains constant makes it easier to find on the network. </s>
<s> System preferences &gt; Network &gt; Built-in Ethernet and select Static for the IP address. </s>
<s> You would then enter an IP address into the required fields and hit Apply. </s>
<s> Make sure that the IP address that you allocated to the computer is outside the range that the DHCP server, usually in the router, will be assigning. </s>

<s> ...crud wireless on the Crudbooks, at least partly. </s>
<s> It's only recently I've started using a new black Crudbook intensively, but I've been a Crudbook Pro user since release and generally speaking, wireless across the entire Apple range seems to lean on the sucky side with the Crudbook Air being the worst I've had to date, but with all the Crudbook Pros I've had following a close second. </s>
<s> Fixed IP addresses on wireless set on the Mac itself as advised above is kind of a pain if you're moving around a lot. </s>
<s> You have to define locations and if you've forgotten to switch back from fixed to DHCP or vice versa it can take a few seconds for you to realise why you're not getting Internet. </s>
<s> Instead, most routers allow the setting of a static IP address by MAC address. </s>
<s> This means you don't need to set a static address on your Mac, but it will be assigned a static address by the router. </s>
<s> A MAC address is an (almost) unique identifier for each network card that your device has. </s>
<s> So a Crudbook would have three MAC addresses - one for the Bluetooth, one for the wireless and one for the Ethernet. </s>
<s> The MAC addresses are listed in the battery compartment or in System Profiler. </s>
<s> To set this, look somewhere in the DHCP Server Setting of your Linksys router. </s>
<s> You should be able to see a setting for 'DHCP Reservation'. </s>
<s> In that screen, you should be able to assign addresses to specific MAC addresses. </s>
<s> where the OP was advised to assign static IP addresses to any of his computers, other than the Printers and whatever he may be using as Servers. </s>

<s> ... clearer for the Windows side, but I assumed the resource sharing was across all machines. </s>
<s> In either case, for the laptop machines, for the reasons I said a static address set on the PC/Mac is less versatile than a DHCP reservation. </s>
<s> While Windows machines play better on networks like this, the same applies to make them readily findable by the Macs as well by giving the Windows machine a DHCP reservation. </s>
<s> The last thing? </s>
<s> Keeping track of static addresses set on printer servers (such as on the Brother) can be a pain, because you'll have to look it up on the machine or write down all the static addresses being used to make sure you know what device is using what address. </s>
<s> In this situation it makes quite a lot of sense to have all the major resources and even clients on his network on static addresses, as well as collect it up in one place and dish out static IP's automatically - that's what DHCP reservations do. </s>
