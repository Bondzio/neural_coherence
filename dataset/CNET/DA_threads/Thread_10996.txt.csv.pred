1.1.1	Okay so I just got a new sound card from creative and put it into my Lenovo motherboard via pci express and when I plug in my optical cable the light is on but when I plug it into my receiver, nothing I am trying to get 5.1 and on my computer when I set the optical to default it says it's outputting sound, I cannot get it to make any sound for the life of me.

1.1.2	The analog works.	St
1.2.1	I can answer any questions to help you help me	St
1.3.1	But for me it's clear the settings are incorrect if sound is coming out on the analog ports.	St
1.3.2	Since I don't own this I can't share how to set it up but your comments tell me it's not set right.	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
