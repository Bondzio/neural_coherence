Santa brought a new dvd drive for christmas.
He got a OEM from newegg.
All that came was the drive and that was all.
Santa's helper (me) installed it.
It must need drivers because it will not play a dvd movie.
The drive is a ''NEC DVD_RW ND-3550A.
I went on google to look for NEC but didn't find what I was looking for.
Please help!
