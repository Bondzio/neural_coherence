<s> I have a Dell A940 printer and recently it started acting up. </s>
<s> After completing a print job, I can look at the print job status and it will show the job as deleting but it will not complete the process. </s>
<s> I have to go into Task Manager (Windows XP) and manually end the process. </s>
<s> I've reinstalled the most recent printer driver to no avail. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Dell has it's own support armada. </s>
<s> Use them. </s>
<s> If you aren't happy, ask for the unit to be exchanged or ask for a refund to go get another printer. </s>
