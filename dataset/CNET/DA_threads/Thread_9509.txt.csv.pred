1.1.1	I have a non-branded PC that my brother-in-law put together for himself and the passed it over to me.	St
1.1.2	It has a AMD x52 chip and runs on XP Pro.	St
1.1.3	I have a constant problem of where it boot's up everyday mysteriously.	St
1.1.4	I always shut it down completely in the evening.	St
1.1.5	Without fail in the morning it is running.	St
1.1.6	I have the Mcafee virus and spyware scan but doesn't seem to pick up anything.	St
1.1.7	If I shut the main switch behind, then it does not start up on it's own.	St
1.1.8	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	1.	St
1.2.2	Other people.	St
1.2.3	2.	St
1.2.4	Wake on LAN, Modem, etc settings.	St
1.2.5	3.	St
1.2.6	The BIOS has that feature to wake at a scheduled time.	St
1.3.1	It sounds like the BIOS has a startup timer in it.	St
1.3.2	Just disable it.	St
1.4.1	A dumb question.	St
1.4.2	How do i get into the bios.	St
1.4.3	Is that at startup?	St
1.5.1	To get into the BIOS, you have to do it before the Windows startup screen.	St
1.5.2	It is the screen that you see where it says 'press [a key] to enter CMOS, or BIOS'.	St
1.5.3	This (key) is probably [delete], [F1], or whatever else it says.	St
1.5.4	After you press the correct key, you should be taken to a blue or gray screen.	St
1.5.5	Just look through there (don't tamper with anything that you don't know what it is) and find something to the effect of a 'timer'.	St
1.5.6	When you find the timer just disable it.	St
1.5.7	(Oh, and the BIOS is controlled with the keyboard, there is no mouse.	St
1.5.8	And be sure when you find and disable the timer, save the settings.	St
1.5.9	To save it, it is usually the [F10] key, if not, it should say how at the bottom of the BIOS screen)	St
1.6.1	Everything except the &quot;PME Event Wakeup&quot; was enabled&quot; I am going to disable that and try it.	St
1.7.1	That's probably it, because 'PME' stands for &quot;Power Management Event&quot;.	St
