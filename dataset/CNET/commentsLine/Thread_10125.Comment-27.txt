some cases have fans with a little switch for fan speed, rather than having it controlled by software.
open up your case and see if your fans have any of these switches, and put them all up a notch.
i've also heard that it's a good idea to have more fans blowing out than in.
the fans blowing out will also pull in fresh air from the front.
while we are focusing on airflow through the case itself, don't forget about airflow through your whole room.
if you have windows on opposite sides of the room (or as opposite eachother as possible), open them both up.
if you get a flow of air through your room, that will cool your room and therefore cool your box.
