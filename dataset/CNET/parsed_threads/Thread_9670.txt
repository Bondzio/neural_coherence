<s> Have a G5 with a Samsung LCD monitor. </s>
<s> Has worked fine until the other day when the monitor turned black and blinks with a white box in the top left corner. </s>
<s> Can also see the desktop sometimes during the blinking. </s>
<s> I hooked up another working monitor (same brand/model) and an older monitor to the G5 and had the same problem. </s>
<s> Changed cables and still nothing. </s>
<s> I am able to get the monitor to work if I restart in safe mode (extensions off). </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Have you installed something new lately? </s>
<s> Starting in Safe Mode, as you know, turns off extensions. </s>
<s> If the graphics card works with extensions off, then the problem is obviously software. </s>
<s> Think back on what you have installed lately. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> We installed CS4 package about a month ago so maybe something in that is causing a conflict. </s>
<s> Will uninstall and see if that works. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I think you have gotten your solution to the problem you were facing. </s>
