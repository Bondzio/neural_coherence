whenever i try to access a my tablet pc running windows vista 32-bit from my desktop running windows 7 64-bit i get a password prompt, however i cannot login with the login used on my tablet or my desktop.
i get the same problem if i try to access the desktop from my pc.
they are in the same workgroup and password protected sharing is off, what else could be causing this problem?
