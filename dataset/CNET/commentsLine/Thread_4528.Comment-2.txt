goto to dell and allow them to check your &quot;system status&quot; for an upgrade.
more than likely you need an ide type hd.
many are on sale or online starting in the 120gb or more range.
it a real drop-in upgrade and make sure it has the help guide with purchase or get online at the hd makers support website.
go there now bwforwhand and look into what you're getting in to.
plus, at dell support they shoul also explain the process to add a 2nd hd to the system, though it maybe generic in nature it covers the topic well.
