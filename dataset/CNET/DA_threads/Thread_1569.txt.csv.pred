1.1.3	What if i upgrade my ram to 8Gb by adding 2 more 2Gb ram sticks ?	Ques
1.1.4	Will having unused ram decrease my pc performance ?	Ques
1.1.5	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Upgrading to 3GB I 'm told ( I use XP ) should be plenty for Vista .	St
1.2.2	Anything after that would not be recognized by your computer once fully booted up , but it can still be used ; you 'll see it if you go into your BIOS .	St
1.2.3	Extra RAM will never decrease your performance .	St
1.3.1	although your pc can handle 8gb , vista 32bit will only be able to address 4gb and only 3gb or so will be useable .	St
1.3.2	slow startup is usually caused by crapware or uneeded apps .	St
1.3.3	run windows defender and use its & quot ; software explorer & quot ; feature to see what 's running currently and what runs automatically at startup .	St
1.3.4	get rid of software you do n't use and do n't allow products like quicktime and acrobat to put their 'helpers ' in the startup group .	Sug
1.3.5	read this posting for more info : http : //blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/ ? p=429 & tag=nl.e539	Ques
1.4.1	startup performance .	St
1.4.2	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	That 's not the problem .	St
1.5.2	2G is more than enough memory for a bootup .	St
1.5.3	If the bootup is slow , look for some other cause like running processes .	St
1.5.4	Turn off quiktime , real player , printer programs that load on startup , etc .	St
