hey matt you mentioned xp sp3 above; i am afraid that i have gotten so used to vista, that i am unable to recall what the latest xp 64bit service pack is.
what version of os are you on, and is it 64bit?
as for the game itself, what is the exact version that you are trying to install?
as silly as this may sound, i would recommend checking to make sure it is not an expansion pack, but the full game.
on a similar note, i was wondering if you are running antivirus software.
if so, disable it and try the install.
i looked up install issues with aoe; thought you might find this link helpful, as it sounds like they are having the same issues as you are:  .
hope that helps.
let me know how it goes.
