<s> what other kind of software any suggestions oh and would i need the video card for tv tuner or should i use the one that comes with it? </s>
<s> To watch TV or record, you need a special card, either a combined videocard/tuner, or separate tuner. </s>
<s> A good combined videocard/tuner would be the All-in-wonder ATI X800XL or just the ATI All in WOnder. </s>
<s> It should come with software when you buy the card. </s>
