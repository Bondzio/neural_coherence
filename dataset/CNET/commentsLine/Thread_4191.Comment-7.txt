slow ram does not cause memory issues because the motherboard chooses the proper divider.
it will autoconfigure itself for any standard speed: ddr2-533, ddr2-667, ddr2-800 and some handle ddr2-1066.
slower ram can result in a more stable system since it doesn't push the mch hardware to its limit.
this is why many small business servers still come with ddr2-667 as the base memory option.
