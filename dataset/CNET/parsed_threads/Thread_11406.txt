<s> Ok, recently bought a desktop from a recommended small computer shop (computer was built on site) and now am unsure of whether I got a good deal or not. </s>
<s> The owner is totally willing to make changes to the system if I decide to. </s>
<s> I spent $870 so far and am able to go up to $1000. </s>
<s> Here are the parts: AMD Athlon 64 bit 3000+ 754 socket ASUS K8S-MX Mother Board Lite-on 16 X DVD+/- R/RW, double layer Maxtor SIS 120 GB Hard Drive 512 MB DDR RAM Network Card Integrated sound and video card 17&quot;Aopen 757JS LCD Monitor- blurry ATX Case with fan, blue lights Want it for email, word processing, surfing the web, downloading, and burning movies and music. </s>
<s> Might watch some dvds on it, not really into games yet. </s>
<s> Should I make any upgrades or changes or should I just return the whole thing and start over? </s>
<s> As you may tell, not really advanced with computers. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> that seems ok for what you need. </s>
<s> of course, you could have went with socket 939 with pci express, but it doesn't look like you will need that since your computer needs are basic. </s>

<s> Not a good sign. </s>
<s> This needs to be addressed while the sytem is new and under warranty. </s>
<s> When you say integrated sound and video do you mean they are already on the motherboard? </s>
<s> You shouldn't need the network card. </s>
<s> The ASUS has one built in. </s>
<s> If you are going to watch movies you might want a PCIe video card. </s>
<s> Something with 128mb of memrory will work fine. </s>
<s> The on board sound should be fine. </s>
<s> As stated in another post, you do need to resolve the monitor issue. </s>
<s> Trade it for a 19in flat screen. </s>
<s> They're cheaper and still have great quality. </s>
<s> You should have room for it. </s>
<s> The only downside to the system is that you only have 2 PCI expansion slots. </s>
<s> You'd better make sure you're not going to want to add a lot of stuff to it. </s>
<s> You will be glad you have the 8 USB2 ports. </s>
<s> Later on you might want to consider a faster SATA hard drive. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
