hello, i read the cnet.com review on this hard drive and it seems a good choice for my daughter to take to college.
she'll be using an apple macbook pro with snow leopard, but will sometimes be on a windows platform while at the library.
my question is related to the optional cables that can be purchased and which are required.
their adverts say 'can be upgraded to firewire 800', well i have a firewire 800 cable that's compatible with her macbook; so can it be plugged to the seagate from her macbook and that's all i would need?
thanks much.
