my external recently died and idk if theres a problem with the wiring or the actual hd and when i plug it into my comp, everything works fine, the usb recognizes that its plugged it, the lights on my external go off, and it makes the same sound it does when running.
however, the external hd does not come up under my computer and my computer acts like its not there.
i was thinking of buying a new enclosure and transfering the hd to see if that would work, but i wanted to check to make sure the hd is not fried before i did that, so is there anyway i could put the hd from the external into an old computer (replace the hd, i don't care for lost data on either hd) to see if the hd is fried or not?
what other choices do i have in terms of saving and being able to use the hd, because its fairly new and i didnt want to have to buy another one :/
