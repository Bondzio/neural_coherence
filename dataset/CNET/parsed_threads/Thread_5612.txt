<s> My computer reported an error in writing to the c: drive (I have my drive partitioned) while working/surfing/ (on known sites) on it. </s>
<s> I did a restart of the computer, and came up with a black screen, nothing else. </s>
<s> I put in another backup drive and got the computer running. </s>
<s> The main C: drive is blank, empty 0 free space, 0 space. </s>
<s> It needs to be formated? </s>
<s> huh? </s>
<s> What happened? </s>
<s> I have tried to use several free hardrive recovery programs with no luck(not seeing anything)? </s>
<s> What is going on here? </s>
<s> How can i recover from this? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance... </s>
<s> Hoe old is this hard drive? </s>
<s> Did you try setting the jumper on the failing drive to slave put in the PC and see if you axcess anything? </s>
<s> When it is installed as a slave see if you can run scandsk on it. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> see anything on the partitions of that original drive? </s>
<s> If so, try salvaging whatever you can off the partitions to a cd (or copy everything over to the current drive you are using). </s>
<s> Once you have salvaged what you can try putting the drive back in a the Master C: drive to boot with, and use your bootdisk to get to the A: prompt....then see if a FDISK /MBR command will put things back right. </s>
<s> (this is assuming it's anything other than XP as other things might need to be done to see if the drive can be recovered). </s>
<s> Which free recovery programs did you use before and how were they used? </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> I can see the other partitions!! </s>
<s> Just my first partition with my windows, programs, etc on is GONE! </s>
<s> I mean there is nothing there. </s>
<s> Running 2000. </s>
<s> Will the bootdisk FDISK/MBR command work without deleting the data on the other partitions? </s>
<s> I was thinking of trying to repair the disk (quick fix?) </s>
<s> by inserting the windows CD. </s>
<s> And seeing if It would repair the partition. </s>
<s> I have reformatted many harddrives before(with the boot disks), and i know that you can repair them as well(instead of the full install), and in doing that you just rewrite the windows files. </s>
<s> I know the easiest way is just to reinstall a fresh copy, but i would like to get it back instead of this option.. </s>
<s> Virtual lab, Get data back, and Data recovery insurance program - were used. </s>
<s> They came up with minimal results.. </s>
<s> Writing to a possibly corrupt drive may make matters worse. </s>
<s> BEFORE YOU DO ANY REPAIR ask yourself if you have recovered what you can at this point. </s>
<s> I've seen people reach a point where they could have scrapped their files off, but didn't. </s>
<s> They proceeded with repair (that should have been safe) and lost it all. </s>
<s> Don't do what Johny does.... Bob </s>
<s> Then backup you data before you do anything else! </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> Any chance you got a bomb type worm? </s>
<s> I've had three client computers in my shop in the last two weeks, same thing as you, well similar, one was a NTldr missing but same idea. </s>
<s> These worms go in and demo your MFT. </s>
<s> Normally used for specific targets though. </s>
