<s> I have bought an HP C3180 &quot;all-in-one&quot; (scanner/printer/copier). </s>
<s> But when I try to install it, it is not even detected by the system. </s>
<s> I booted under Linux and ran the 'lsusb' program to detect USB devices; it isn't even there. </s>
<s> Searching has found that this printer needs an &quot;USB 2.0 cable&quot;. </s>
<s> Can someone confirm this? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Send it back. </s>
<s> I find the old USB 1.1 cable to be fine even at this but then again that FRONT USB port wiring issue is why I test with rear USB ports. </s>
<s> As to USB 2.0 cables, I gifted all my old cables away and replaced them with the 99 cent USB 2.0 cables from geeks.com or newegg.com I see no reason to keep the old cables and any issues they harbor. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> I got a C3180 when I bought my new IMAC...When I installed it It VERY definately states when to connect to my Mac with a USB cable...My problen is that it identified itse lf as a 3100 series..gave a different serial number..when I got to the part of a setup assistant..It told its name(that I couldn't change) and then congradulated me on a success ful set up!!!!!!!! </s>
<s> !One of the other windows is suppose to give name and something else and installable options..after about a minute it says that it is a empty selection...all of them. </s>
<s> As far as I can tell..it works ok...prints copies haven't scanned yet. </s>
<s> So what is wrongand how do I fix it? </s>
<s> Thanks everybody......this newbie, Michele 20&quot; intel mac 2.16 Ghz core duo, Tiger 10.0408, 2gb memory, </s>
<s> It didn't work out of the box so return it. </s>
