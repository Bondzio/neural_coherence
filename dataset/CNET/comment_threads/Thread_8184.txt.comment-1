Hi there: I've got a question to ask about my internet set up.
currently, my wireless router is connected to my modem, what I'd like to know is, is it possible to connect my modem to a switch then the wireless router to the switch and still keep everything working?
If I connect one computer to the switch through LAN cable and another computer to the wireless router through WiFi, will both computer be able to go onto the internet?
Sorry about the long question, but it's just that the logistics of the rooms and stuff makes things difficult.
Cheers
