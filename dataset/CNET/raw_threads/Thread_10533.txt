There are only two bays for the hard drives. There is enough space for the third one, though. Does anyone know what kind of brackets I could use to install the third drive? Is there a site I can purchase a bay for one drive or some kind of hardware which will hold the drive in place? Thanks a lot. Alex.

Seems that if you have space, mounting should just take some kind of a kludge. Of course getting the ribbon cable to it with another drive on the cable may be a real challenge.
