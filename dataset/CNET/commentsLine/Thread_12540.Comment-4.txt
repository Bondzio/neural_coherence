i'm pretty sure it's ddr2-400.
i bought it over two years ago.
as for what i use the pc for, i usually use it for school work and some games.
i used to play america's army, before it got too intense for the integrated video.
same thing with war rock.
i'm really looking for something that i can play some games and have enough.
oh and get out of vista basic hell!
i have a laptop that has a geforce 6150. that has actually made it like night and day when switching back and forth.
so i'm hoping a 7600 will be even better.
