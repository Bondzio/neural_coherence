I will start with a brief overview of our network: Cable router to netgear wireless router to (4) wired connections. The problem I'm having is with the Levitron Keystore jacks for cat5e. I have wired these in 568B format. The wiring was installed by the contractor. All lines terminate in a closet along with telephone and cable. The ends of the cat5 in the closet I have terminated with male plugs to connect to the Netgear router. The other ends are in varies wall plugs in the building. I connected (2) yesterday according to the label for 568B. I can't connect on either of these plugs. I have also wired them in 568A and Crossover just to try. I removed one of the keystones and put a male plug on to test connection. This worked without an issue. I have tried (3) plugs out of the package of (10). I'm only removing the outer sheath, untisting 1/2&quot;, leaving the individual wire sheathing, and using a 110 punch tool to install in the keystone. I'm sorry this is long winded but I wanted to try to answer any basic questions up front. Does anyone have any idea what the issue could be?

I had been wiring all day when this issue came up and I chose to walk away as I was getting fustrated. You may very well be right about that. Thanks for the quick reply.
