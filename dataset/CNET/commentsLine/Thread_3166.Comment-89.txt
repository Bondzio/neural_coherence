i had an external usb hard drive crap out after 2 years.
however, i heard a whine (like you hear when a camera flash is charging) so i figured a capacitor was bad.
it turned out that the circuit board that connects the ide to usb was blown.
i unplugged the drive from that board and made it an internal hard drive by plugging it in as a slave drive.
i got all my info back, and it has been running fine ever since.
