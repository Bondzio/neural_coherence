it was sometime in the mid-90s, when we started to use computers in schools.
at first, i hated computers with a passion.
i got frustrated very easily and never wanted to use one again.
a few months afterwards, my parents purchased a packard bell machine, and i began playing with it more.
i still find it funny that i at first despised computers, and now cannot live without them!
