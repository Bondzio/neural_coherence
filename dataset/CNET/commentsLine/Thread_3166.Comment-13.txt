according to a+ course work (and personal experience), the magnetic bit strength of any hard drive has a half-life of around 5 years.
that means the strength of the magnetic particles on the surface of a hard drive have lost 50% of their field strength in 5 years time.
not to mention the fact most external hard drives get much less cooling than the hard drive in a typical computer.
if you ask me, i would say it's time to get a new external hard drive, keep using the old one till it dies, but begin making back-ups of your back-ups using another external now, in case the old one does fail.
most hard drives i've seen that don't fail in the first year, fail after about 5 years.
good luck and remember, keep backing up!
