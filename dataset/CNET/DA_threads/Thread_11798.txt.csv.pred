1.1.1	I have a MacBook 2.4 GHz intel Core Duo 2GB Ram running 10.6.2 I have connected it to my new Sony Bravia KDL-26S55 TV using a standard cable with an Apple adaptor , to watch streamed tv content from the BBC iPlayer ( British tv ) .	St
1.1.2	I use a wi-fi link to connect to my broadband .	St
1.1.3	It plays ok except that there are frequent 4-5 second breaks when the tv screen says 'no signal 1024 X 768 ' but the content continues playing on the Mac screen , then it all starts to work again .	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions how I can resolve this ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	... according to a quick google .	St
1.2.2	Your owners manual may also mention other video resolutions that it will support .	Sug
1.2.3	You need to try and match the video resolution output of your computer to what the TV will best accept .	Sug
1.2.4	You can choose the best video output by going to System Preferences & gt ; Hardware & gt ; Displays ... then select the resolution best handled by your TV .	St
