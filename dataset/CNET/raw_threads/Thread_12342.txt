My PS/2 mouse is dead so I've bought a cheap PS/2 to USB adapter off of Amazon and plugged my USB mouse into it. Upon system boot, the mouse will turn on and then turn off after about two seconds. There's nothing I can do to turn it back on and it's being to get me annoyed. I know the mouse works fine since I just tried it on a netbook and it worked upon plug in. Does anyone have advice to offer?

The PS/2 mouse is now unresponsive when playing games. I was just in TF2 when the mouse wheel would act on it's own and then the entire mouse will not respond for thirty seconds after. Not to mention how it will randomly stop responding mid turn in other games. It's a iMicro MO-5013P PS/2 mouse. I was thinking of a driver update, but the iMicro site provides none. Should I try the Basic Optical Mouse drivers from Microsoft?
