1.1.1	i am connecting my laptop pc to my hdtv via a wireless gizmo .	St
1.1.2	the gizmo has a dongle transmitter connected to the pc via the hdmi port and the usb port for power , on the receiver hdtv end the receiver box connects to the hdtv through the hdtv hdmi port and to the a/c power on the wall , all this is to replace a hdmi to hdmi cable connection .	St
1.1.3	i hope i , m clear so far .	St
1.1.4	now i want to clone my pc screen to my hdtv screen i.e .	St
1.1.5	i want to see the exact same image or video on both my pc screen and on my hdtv screen and here lies my problem , as i stated in my original post , i am unable to do so using the fn/f8 keys or the microsoft key/p options i have on my pc keyboard .	St
1.1.6	using these keys i can see a video on either the pc laptop screen or on the hdtv screen but not on both at the same time which is what cloning or duplicating means ?	Ques
1.1.7	the internet posts related to this issue recommend using my nvidia control panel to achieve cloning , i have also tried that approach with no sucess because when i go there , i do not have choice for cloning , it seems it doesnt recognize or detect a second monitor ?	Ques
1.1.8	graphic card is nvidia ion	St
1.2.1	Since the laptop display is not the same as the HDTV , this should be a dead end .	St
1.2.2	Why ca n't you use the usual extended display ?	Ques
1.2.3	Why must it be a clone job ?	Ques
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Proffitt Lots of posts on net where ppl connected laptop to HDTV successfully !	St
1.3.2	Not sure what u mean by & quot ; makes sense & quot ; ? ?	Ques
1.3.3	I also tried extend screen w negative results '	St
1.4.1	Let 's take my netbook which has 1024 x 600 pixels .	St
1.4.2	That 's nothing my HDTV will display so cloning that display should result in a dead end .	St
1.4.3	It makes sense to me .	St
1.4.4	As to those other folk they may not have your netbook .	St
1.4.5	On top of that you elected to not share make and model .	St
1.4.6	The extended display does work here as long as I set it to something compatible .	St
1.4.7	- & gt ; I do n't want to upset you but why the lack of make , models , cables used , settings and what that USB to HDMI thing is ?	Ques
1.4.8	The USB to HDTV link I know of required some driver install and setup yet your post is so light on details that I ca n't see where it went wrong .	St
1.4.9	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanx for your help !	St
1.5.2	I am not upset at all .	St
1.5.3	Just want to solve problem .	St
1.5.4	My laptop is Asus Eee the only info I have on graphics card is Nvidia Ion .	St
1.5.5	The wireless is nyrius Aries .	St
1.5.6	It consists of a transmitter and a receiver .	St
1.5.7	The transmitter is a dongle that attaches to laptop with a HDMI male to laptop female and also to the USB INPUT on the laptop for power .	St
1.5.8	The receiver is a box that attaches to the HDTV via a male HDMI Cable and to the wall A/C outlet .	St
1.5.9	Perhaps you can find it on google under Nyrius Aries HDMI wireless connection .	St
1.5.10	That 's where I bought it .	St
1.5.11	I send them an email but they have not replied !	St
1.6.1	Before you use the wireless HDMI did you get it working with just a HDMI cable ?	Ques
1.6.2	I have one of those HDMI wireless things but mine is the Philips SWW1890/27 Wireless HD Net Connect .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	yes i started that way with a hdmi to hdmi cable and i had the same result as with the wireless connection !	St
1.7.2	!	St
1.8.1	That 's a problem with troubles like this .	St
1.8.2	If it did n't work with just the HDMI then adding this wireless HDMI only muddies the conversation .	St
1.8.3	I 'd head back to wired and see if we can find the user 's manual fort this computer .	St
1.8.4	You look too .	St
1.8.5	I 'll be back later .	St

1.9.1	Support For Eee Family Eee PC 1215N Change Your Model Add to My Favorite Register Knowledge Download Specification Warranty Policy Bob , I found this on Asus support for my laptop Eee PC 1215N : Optimus support HDMI 1.4a 3D display specification so display ca n't support clone mode .	St
1.9.2	Page Tools Solution The LCD and CRT display output from Intel GPU .	St
1.9.3	The HDMI display output from Nvidia GPU .	St
1.9.4	Because the Nvidia GPU ca n't sync intel display data for calpella platform , So that is Nvidia GPU limitation for this architecture .	St
1.10.1	Clone mode is pretty much a non-starter since this Netbook 's display is 1024 x 600 and you have found a second reason .	St
1.10.2	I 'd focus on the extended desktop method now .	St
