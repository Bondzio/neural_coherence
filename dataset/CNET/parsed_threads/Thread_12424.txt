<s> Thanks in advance for the help. </s>
<s> I have already read some other posts and think the folks on this Forum are prettyinsightful and helpful. </s>
<s> Anyway, I am buying a PC for my mother. </s>
<s> Looking for a good PC that will meet her needs without over buying. </s>
<s> I would categorize her as about the lightest PC user possible today - I anticipate her mainly using it for internet, some light applications (Quicken, Word etc.) </s>
<s> and not really needing tons of hard drive space or extra features. </s>
<s> She MAY get a digital camera in the future and will want some extra hard drive space for that, but even then would not need tons or GBs. </s>
<s> After about 3-4 days of internet searching, the best deal (I think) I have found is on this HP system. </s>
<s> I THINK a very good Processor and RAM, with a trade off that I again did not end up with a huge Hard drive or anything more than a CD Rom Drive (which is all she would need for now). </s>
<s> As noted below price also includes a 17 in' moitor and a basic printer For $521 total (including tax, shipping (which is free) everything)I get: Processor Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 519J (3.06GHz, 533MHz Memory FREE Upgrade from 256 to 512 MB PC2 3200 (2 DIMM) Operating System Microsoft(R) Windows(R) XP Home Edition with SP2 Hard Drive 40GB 7200 rpm SATA Hard Drive Primary CD/DVD Drive 48X Max. </s>
<s> CD-ROM Drive Front Productivity Ports 2 USB 2.0, 1 Firewire ports + WinDVD Creator Monitor HP Pavilion v72c 17&quot; CRT Monitor Graphics Card Integrated Intel(R) Graphics Media Accelerator 900 Sound Card Integrated Intel(R) High Definition Audio Speakers HP Stereo Speakers Keyboard and Mouse HP Multimedia Keyboard, HP Scroller Mouse Productivity Software Microsoft(R) Works 8.0/Money 2005/MSN Encarta Plus Printers HP Deskjet 3845 Printer edit Is this a good deal???? </s>
<s> OR... For about $30 more I can get a Dell with the only differences really being I get a P4 w/ HT Tech (the 3GHZ 800) but do not get the printer. </s>
<s> Are these good deals? </s>
<s> I assume they would more than cover my mother's needs? </s>
<s> Is $520-$550 a good deal for the mid-range P4's??? </s>
<s> Any preference between Dell and HP?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> emachines t6212 for $599. </s>
<s> AMD 64 3200+ 512 MB PC3200 160 GB DVD+_RW CD-ROM PCI-Express slot Monitor Speaker Keyboard Wheel Mouse </s>
<s> They're both terrific deals. </s>
<s> Her needs would definitely be be met, but neither is a &quot;stripped down&quot; system. </s>
<s> I would go with the HP, if only because I keep reading more and more gripes about Dell service. </s>
<s> And she'll enjoy the printer. </s>
<s> After I posted the first message, I saw various emails about that very model, espeically in regards to the $550 deal Best Buy and I think Circuit City had last week or so (just missed it). </s>
<s> I can also get for virtually the same $520 price the following from HP (see below). </s>
<s> It also has the 64 bit processor, but is the AMD Athlon 64 3300+ 2.4 GHz (one step up). </s>
<s> Please note I do not need the 160 gb HD or the CD/DVD Drive, but could also add both for another $80.00, bringing my total to $600. </s>
<s> As I think I stated in the prev post I get a discount from my work of about $40-$50 off the standard price from HP. </s>
<s> This price is w/ shipping, tax etc. </s>
<s> so is this below a better deal due to the 64 technology or other reasons? </s>
<s> again, I can get for virrtually the same $520 or so price then my previous post for the HP P4 3.0 machine. </s>
<s> also, includes monitor and printer. </s>
<s> OR I can get the AMD Athlon 3200+ 2.2GHz for $20.00 less at about $500(so I was going to spluge on the extra $20 and get the better processor) here is is for $520: Processor AMD Athlon(TM) 64 3300+ operating at 2.4GHz Memory FREE Upgrade from 256 to 512 MB PC3200 (1 DIMM) edit Operating System Microsoft(R) Windows(R) XP Home Edition with SP2 Hard Drive 40GB 7200 rpm SATA Hard Drive Primary CD/DVD Drive 48X Max. </s>

<s> i would get the emachines as its the better deal if it comes with a printer. </s>
<s> Wait a while then check circuitcity, compusa, and best buy. </s>
<s> The emachines has a bigger hard drive, 120 gb bigger, and a dvd writer drive. </s>
<s> Today, some software require dvd drives cuz the software takes up more space. </s>
<s> Also, the graphics is better on the emachines. </s>
<s> Imo, the sis graphics is junker than the intel integrated graphics. </s>
<s> ALso, the emachines is better for future upgrades. </s>
<s> But again, its your choice. </s>
<s> But i think the hp is more expensive in price for less the value. </s>
<s> ALthough the higher processor. </s>
<s> Wont really make a difference. </s>
<s> SO shop around and if emachines t6212 is available with printer and the entire package, i would get that instead of the hp. </s>
<s> I'm looking into the T6212 as well... but for approx the same price range I found an offer from dell, I want 160 HD, 512 MB and a DVD burner...dell offers a 2 yr service warranty as well,any feedback on this would be greatly appreciated as I am a novice computer buyer! </s>
<s> Buying a budget &quot;value&quot; computer My advice is to wait for package deals from Best Buy, Circuit City, and CompUSA, checking those of HP, Gateway, and Emachines. </s>
<s> Occasionally Wal-Mart and Costco may have a good buy. </s>
<s> So far the best for the money IMO has been the emachine T6212 with a monitor and printer for $550, and if mom, dad, daughter, son, or wife wanted a 'value' computer I would wait it out for that deal to surely come again as has been noted of trends in the past. </s>
<s> A garage (yard) sale or ad in local daily/weekly paper for the not wanted monitor/printer would further reduce the cost. </s>
<s> I myself have three computers (bought at excellent prices), keeping the monitors and giving away the printers. </s>
<s> For this week at Best Buy it looks like the T3090 for $329.97: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=98742&messageID=1132066&tag= Some things to keep in mind about selecting a &quot;value&quot; (low cost) computer: If you will notice many (most all) retail sellers of computers, just don't tell enough about the graphics. </s>
<s> Especially when their is Integrated (on board) graphics like Intel Extreme, SIS Mirage2, Intel Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA 900) or the latest ATI Radeon Xpress 200. </s>
<s> Integrated graphics is fine for most applications/software/business except for current high end games and future games. </s>
<s> Factory assemblers can get motherboards/chipsets at a cheaper rate if it has Integrated graphics. </s>
<s> It cost just a little more to add an AGP or PCI-Express x16 slot. </s>
<s> So, some assembly factory's will get a motherboard/chipset with integrated graphics and a slot for upgrading the graphics to a video card, but will not sell the computer with the video card to save $$. </s>
<s> Mom and Dad who play some mild games will not be affected with Integrated graphics. </s>
<s> For computers that have only Integrated Graphics, a &quot;PCI&quot; (not PIC-Express) video card can be added but is not as powerful as AGP/PCI-E and is limited as to how high a card that you can buy...currently at GeForce 5700LE. </s>
<s> If you have a kid, say 9 on up to a teenager, he will not think much of your computer having &quot;Integrated Graphics&quot;. </s>
<s> (I'm 73 years old and know from the grandkids who play on my 3 computers.) </s>
<s> For AMD computers: The Athlon 64 has 64-bit support for the coming future. </s>
<s> Look for the AMD64 with the &quot;better&quot; socket 939 over the socket 754 or socket A, for performance enhancements and the future. </s>
<s> The Athlon 64 3300 processor seems to be a special make for low cost HP computers. </s>
<s> It is not listed with AMD and seems to be the only AMD Athlon 64 computer that has less than 512kb of L2 cache. </s>
<s> I would select the AMD Athlon 64 3200 processor (listed with AMD) over the 3300. </s>
<s> Since the Athlon 64 can now be had in &quot;value&quot; computers at a low price, I would avoid the Athlon XP and AMD &quot;Sempron&quot; unless at a 'good deal'. </s>
<s> AMD computers at the low cost end usually have Integrated graphics, but also usually have a slot for upgrading to a AGP or PCI-Express x16 video card. </s>
<s> Intel computers: Since Intel introduced the 64-bit (EM64T) support in January, OEM/Retailers, are still unloading their non-64-bit computers. </s>
<s> Dell & Gateway have come out with the EM64T on their more expensive computers and eventually all Intel computers will have the EM64T. </s>
<s> Those non-EM64T computers are still great, and IMO the 64-bit programs/applications are still rare and in the future, and will affect business users, but not good basic home users. </s>
<s> There is talk of distant future high end games having some 64-bit applications. </s>
<s> So, to tell if a computer has the 64-bit tech, look right after the ad that has &quot;Pentium 4&quot; a number in the &quot;6xx&quot; series. </s>
<s> If that number is in the &quot;5xx&quot; series, it is non 64-bit. </s>
<s> Intel (Pentium/Celeron etc) computers at the &quot;value&quot; low cost end will almost always have Integrated graphics and retailers seem to hide any knowledge on if there is an AGP/PCI-E slot available for upgrade (which they usually don't have). </s>
<s> I would suggest digging in to find out, and the best way: See in the ad listings if AGP/PCI-E is listed as a expansion slot not used & available. </s>
<s> Research with the retail factory on the motherboard or chipset, then go to the mobo or Intel site and it will tell you. </s>
<s> I suggest waiting for the $550 printer/monitor T6212 sale to appear again, or like some others check out the CompUSA sale for the T6212 with monitor, no printer for $599.98. </s>
<s> http://tinyurl.com/dzvv3 Regards, </s>
<s> Thanks for all that info. </s>
<s> Here are a few things I can add based on my last day or so of research: 1) Stopped by Circuit City today and asked about the $550 deal. </s>
<s> The guy did say he expects they will run that special agin in a few weeks. </s>
<s> He was just one of the saleman, so not sure if he really has any insider info or not, but at least he did say they were expecting to run it again 2) If you just can't wait... CompUSA is selling it for $599 but it DOES have a monitor. </s>
<s> Site says delivery only, but it does only have Penny shipping. </s>
<s> You MAY not have to pay tax either, so if you donlt need a printer by the time you factor in tax from Best Buy or Circuit City etc then you may only be $10-$20 difference (and again no printer): http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=21939&pfp=41705sale 3) HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT - I ended up getting a Dell today. </s>
<s> On the Employee Purchase Website through my company for $465 Total shipping, tax etc)I got the following: Dell 3000 Pentiuum 4 530 HT - 3GHz, 800 FSB 512MB Ram 400MHz 80 GB HD 17&quot; monitor (not flat screen) Printer CD Rom Drive I will say for MY MOM this was a great deal. </s>
<s> A Pentium 4 HT with at least 1/2 decent RAM with monitor and printer (both of which she needed) for UNDER $470. </s>
<s> So for me (I think) GREAT DEAL BUT... </s>
<s> I would also say of anyone was looking for anything more than this I am not sure Dell is always the way to go. </s>
<s> First, i did get a huge discount through my work, so if you are not in a company that has employee discounts like this may be hard to get the same deal. </s>
<s> Got the same 20% off they have on normal site, PLUS another 12% plus a $50.00 coupon. </s>
<s> Plus they had free shipping today for all Deminsion systems (usually only have it for ones over $499 base price). </s>
<s> PLUS I found that if I did start adding/upgrading the componants were higher than some of the other sites I saw. </s>
<s> For example, just to jump to a CD RW was $50.00 (not dvd, just cd), 80 to 160 HD was $90 etc. </s>
<s> Plus not sure the motehrboard is as expandable as others like the emachine would be. </s>
<s> Again - FINE FOR MY MOM, but may not be for others. </s>
<s> PLUS I do not see my mom exactly jumping into the need for 64 bit echnology (she is still running Windows 95 with dial up for example) It did finally come down to the fact that $465 would give her more than enough PC for her needs, and the eMachine did have a much better HD, had the R/W DVD drive etc, but once tax came in the picture it would be another $120 or so. </s>
<s> Not worth it for her, but I would say it WOULD be worth it for the majority of folks. </s>
<s> just my thoughts. </s>
<s> Hope she likes the Dell. </s>
<s> again, for $465 for Pentium 4 530, monitor, printer etc seemed like a deal. </s>
<s> One last NICE thing about the Dell employee purchase plan - called a US number, dealt with US folks. </s>
<s> very very helpful. </s>
<s> I will cross my fingers and hope all goes well and I don't have to deal with the India tech support later... ONE LAST COMMENT - if you ARE looking to buy a PC and work for a larger compant, you should always check to see fi they have employee discounts with some of these places. </s>
<s> I did save about $80-90 more (or about 20% due to this at Dell. </s>
<s> Plus HP site had great deals. </s>
<s> at least check it out as an option </s>
<s> you have no idea how much your posting helped..I think I'm definately going to wait for the AMD T6212! </s>
<s> sb909 - I think I am right with you - I am also leaning heavily towards the eMachine T6212. </s>
<s> I think either that one or some of the custom built HP's (the 1030s) - they look really good. </s>
<s> The nice thing about HP is you can have them upgrade/customize right then and there and get exactly what you want (either upgrades for memory, video or sound cards) or if for some reason you need to take options away (lower HD etc.) </s>
<s> BUT by the end of the day, I think eMachine comes in slightly lower, especially if you DO need the monitor and printer. </s>
<s> About a month ago, I ordered a DELL Dimension 8400 with the base 3.0 Ghz 630 Intel Pentium 4 Processor. </s>
<s> The &quot;system information&quot; tab says my processor is x86 Family 15 Model 4 Stepping 3 GeniunieIntel~2992 Mhz. </s>
<s> Is this enough info to tell what I got? </s>
<s> A &quot;friend&quot; (who thinks DELLS are over-rated and may just be trying to make me feel like I got ripped off) tells me my processor was obsolete the day it was shipped and it is not 64 bit and 2MB of L2 cache like it should be. </s>
<s> The thing sure runs plenty fast but I am not a super heavy duty user. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I suspect your friend is jealous . </s>
<s> Assume you have Dell paperwork that shows it shipped a 630 processor. </s>
<s> I did a research on X86 some time ago, and just logged it out of my mind. </s>
<s> It concerns the industry standard on the design of a processor system and its compatibility. </s>
<s> For detailed info on your computer, I would suggest downloading the free small program from Belarc and printing out a copy http://www.belarc.com/Download.html Intel announced in February (this year) that they are now shipping four new processors in the Intel Pent 4 Processor 6xx sequence that support the 64-bit tech (EM64T). </s>
<s> Quote from Intel: &quot; Intel plans to ship EM64T on versions of every newly introduced Intel desktop processor including the company's Intel Celeron D processor lines later this year. </s>
<s> The new processors will support the upcoming Microsoft* Windows XP Professional x64 Edition operating system and will enable users to experience the benefits of 64-bit computing.&quot; Intel indicates for a Pent4 630 you have: 3.0GHz clock speed 800MHz Front Side Bus (FSB) 2MB of L2 cache 90nm LGA 775 Architechure So, this should be your processor: http://processorfinder.intel.com/scripts/details.asp?sSpec=SL7Z9&ProcFam=483&PkgType=ALL&SysBusSpd=ALL&CorSpd=ALL Note it includes the 64-bit (EM64T) </s>
<s> You are correct. </s>
<s> I got what I paid for. </s>
<s> I had seen a ZDnet forum where you explained &quot;The main difference is that the Pent4 6xx series has the 64-bit support technology (EM64T) and 2MB of L2 cache, whereas the 5xx series does not have the the 64-bit and has up to 1MB of L2 cache. </s>
<s> The 6xx series also has the PCI-Express bus along with introducing the Enhanced Intel Speedstep Technology (EIST) on desktop processors.&quot; I had &quot;copied & pasted&quot; that onto a WORD document. </s>
<s> The Belarc link you provided told me that I had the 2MB of L2 cache (it did not mention the 64 bit technology) but I think I can safely assume I got what I paid for based on the L2 cache size. </s>
<s> I appreciate your help. </s>
<s> Further, I enjoy following what you write because I am not a computer geek and appreciate the way you can put things in layman's terms. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> This link shows that the Extended Memory 64 Technology (EM64T)is with these Intel Desktop Processors: Pent Extreme Edition 840 Pent 4 Extreme Edition 3.73GHz Pent 4 Processors 630, 640, 650, 660 http://indigo.intel.com/compare_cpu/default.aspx?familyID=1 </s>
