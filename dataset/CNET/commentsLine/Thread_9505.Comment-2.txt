here:  there is a dvi output port.
from apple, you can get  which allows and rca (yellow-video equivalent) or s-video connection out to a tv/monitor...  which allows you to connect a dvi cable - if your monitor/tv can use that connection...  which allows a vga connection more commonly found on computer monitors but finding its way onto many of the better flat-screen lcd and plasma panels.
audio will be a different cable... 1/8&quot; (3.5mm) stereo male out to whatever you want... lots of sources for that, but here is an example  though this is only 1/8&quot;-1/8&quot; male-male... if there is a nearby radioshack, they will have what you need... no worries on not using the technical terms - it was enough for me to understand - at least you didn't say &quot;that thingy&quot;...
