1.1.1	I recently bought a Seagate 160 GB external HD to use as a backup.	St
1.1.2	Prior to this I would save any documents on floppies but now with digitial photos and program disks missing (not lost just temporarily misplaced), I wanted to be able to do a full backup.	St
1.1.3	When I used the XP Backup Wizard I received an error stating that I could not create a file lager than 4GB due to FAT32 formatting on the external drive.	St
1.1.4	My question is there someway around this in Backup; do I have to reformat the external drive in NTFS or do I have to buy 3rd party software?	St
1.1.5	Thanks, Rick	St
1.2.1	What feature does MSBACKUP have that is worthy?	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	I assume that if a virus struck my computer, that I could just reformat the hard drive, drag and drop back from my external drive and everything would work OK.	St
1.3.2	I thought that MSBACKUP would compress everything and simplify the restore process.	St
1.3.3	Rick	St
1.4.1	MSBACKUP can't restore to a blank drive.	St
1.4.2	At least with simpler copy methods, all your files are saved.	St
1.4.3	-&gt; Maybe a solution like ACRONIS should be explored?	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
