This is good info.
I'm in the market for a new system, and Ibuypower is one I looked at.
Good prices, but not if they sell garbage.
cyberpowerpc.com has a very similar interface and look.
Are they the same company, or is this just the way several online computer companies look?
Also, does anyone know what's the deal with &quot;professional wiring&quot; costing extra?
If you don't pay do they let their preschooler wire your box??
?
