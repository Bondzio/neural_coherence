this can be done as the mb will have 2 ide channels.
depending on how the new system is configured you should have one ide port open.
attach the ide drive to the open ide port, on boot access the bios primary boot device setting.
make sure that the sata hdd is the primary boot drive.
the issue may be xp not recognizing the drive and its data properly.
you say the drive went splat .... meaning?
