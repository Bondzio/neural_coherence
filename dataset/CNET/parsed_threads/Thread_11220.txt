<s> I have a wireless router in my house. </s>
<s> I have a dog kennel located about 110' from my house. </s>
<s> I am using a Logitech Security camera to monitor the kennel. </s>
<s> As the camera uses the electrical system as the antenna, I have run an extension cord from the house to the kennel, which has its own electrical system, as an interim option. </s>
<s> However, I would like ro find a way that I can plug the camera and soon to be multiple cameras inti the kennel electric. </s>
<s> However they need to be plugged into the same electrical system that the router is on, which is the house. </s>
<s> How can I overcome this obstacle without needing a second IP for the kennel? </s>
<s> Look into using a wireless access point at the location. </s>
<s> So, ethernet cable to the kennel with a second router there? </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply and the clarification. </s>
