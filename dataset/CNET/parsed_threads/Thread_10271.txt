<s> Hello, I'm having a heck of a time trying to find myself a UDMA mode-6 enabled motherboard to run SSD. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I cannot find the UDMA mode listed on many motherboard specification sheets. </s>
<s> Asus recommened that I check out the P9X79 motherboard. </s>
<s> Currently, I am running a Asus P7P55D-E LX which is listed as having 2x 6/Gbs SATA ports. </s>
<s> However, UDMA 6 enabled SSD's are only being run @ UDMA 5... Any tips on UDMA mode-6 motherboards would be great. </s>
<s> I am willing to go with AMD or Intel (preferably Intel) CPUs along with it. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> So it appears UDMA 6 or ATA133 is legacy. </s>
<s> That is, you catch that where you can but it's gone. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Not sure I'm following you on this one Proffitt </s>
<s> You lead off with UDMA 6 or ATA-133 which is about IDE ports. </s>
<s> Since new boards may not have said port, trouble. </s>
<s> Why can't you use the newer SATA ports and get a SSD on SATA connections? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Given that a BIOS can emulate IDE (the drive is still SATA) folk may elect to use this emulation and get lost trying to up the UDMA mode when it's all an emulation. </s>
<s> Skip all this and set the SATA to AHCI without the emulation and we can chat about SATA speeds. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The issue is that a 6.0 Gb/s SATA port is &quot;supposed&quot; to read @ 400+ mb/s. </s>
<s> If I'm not mistaken, when the SSD is running in UDMA 5-mode, the read/write speed is not testing @ it's full ability. </s>
<s> I follow you on this, unfortunately, when AHCI mode is enabled, the PC gets on an endless cycle of boot and reboot while BSODIng on the windows logo </s>
<s> Enabled AHCI mode, computer booted up fine, read/write speeds seem to still be &quot;slower&quot; than advertised </s>
<s> I found SSD to be treacherous in that not only the drive firmware must be current, but many machines require Intel's RST app to hit full steam. </s>
<s> Then again, the SSD maker can change the software to be more safe at the cost of some speed. </s>
<s> And finally we have the problem of laboratory conditions. </s>
<s> One poor soul had that CRACKED WINDOWS 7 and never could fix it. </s>
<s> Our theory is the crack wrecked havoc with the system. </s>
<s> And since we could get full speed from our install they were pissed at everyone about &quot;what carp is this, why can't you fix my system?&quot; They were treated as nicely as possible but that OS meant we could never tackle that system. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Many forget the extra bytes in the packets flying around. </s>
<s> This is why you want to talk to the maker's support of your machine and see what they think. </s>
