of seagate, maxtor and wd, only seagate drives have never given me any trouble.
my maxtors (4 in all) had a habit of playing up when they got too warm - probably because the circuit board just sat on a set of contacts and flexed with the heat.
my wd's have had about a 30% failure rate.
seagates?
no failures.
most of these drives are in use 24 hours a day, and i've even had seagate 500gb and 750gb drives in those fan-free external usb cases with no problem at all.
