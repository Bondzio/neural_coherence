Very little has been added - a file sharing program of course. It ran pretty fast out of the box, but is now slow - even opening the control panel is slow. I don't think a celeron should run slow like this, but who knows. We have defragmented, all windows updates are current and same for Norton Anti-Virus. Anyone have any tips for speeding this thing up?

Each has been used by many (just check in the Security Forum) with little to no loss besides the pests. The list is one that is very safe to use with the supplied defaults.
