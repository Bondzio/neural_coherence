1.1.1	I formated , then istalled Windows Me in a computer .	St
1.1.2	Now I ca n't get the modem working .	St
1.1.3	It is an AMBIENT DATA FAX VOICE ( md-cn5614ch ) .	St
1.1.4	I 've tryed quite a few drivers already .	St
1.1.5	While intalling the modem a message appears , & quot ; Confix has caused and error in Kernel32 ... & quot ; .	St
1.1.6	I 've tryed it in Windows 98se too already , and it does the same thing .	St
1.1.7	If I go to control panel - modems - diagnostics - select modem - more information , after a while a message appears with something like this .	St
1.1.8	If it is an external modem , make sure it is connected and turned on .	St
1.1.9	If it is an internal modem make sure the interupt port is properly set .	St
1.1.10	If I check the interupt port , there are on conflicts , neither can I change it .	St
1.1.11	Also if I check the & quot ; diagnostics - more information & quot ; I can hear the modem making a few short and very silent & quot ; chirps & quot ; ( sounds ) .	St
1.1.12	Can you help me figure it out ?	Ques
1.2.1	Before I expect the modem to play nice , the OS 's you 've listed do n't install MOTHERBOARD drivers for you and I see no mention of that step .	St
1.2.2	Many motherboards have IRQ Routing issues that the motherboard drivers supply support for .	St
1.2.3	Microsoft will NOT install these for you by clicking of Windows Update or Driver Update .	Sug
1.2.4	Then you have the possibility the modem is just DOA .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	How can I find the model no .	St
1.3.2	for the mother board so I can find the drivers .	St
1.3.3	I know it 's form the Intel company .	St
1.3.4	Will they have all software for the motherboard for download , what are my options ?	Ques
1.4.1	Many Intel boards are used in HP , Dell and other makes of machines .	St
1.4.2	Please follow the TIP instructions to help people help you : & quot ; If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem , please be sure to include all the necessary information ( ie : operating system , model number , hardware , software , etc ) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. & quot ; Bob	Sug
1.5.1	It is a PC of hardware somebody must have picked up here and there .	St
1.5.2	No model number , Pentium III , 95 mb ram , about 2.2 gb hard drive .	St
1.5.3	Whole system seems odd .	St
1.5.4	Supposed to be an Alaska , but ... Now only Windows Me and some drivers .	St
1.6.1	You could try opening the case to read model numbers off parts and boards then sharing here .	Sug
1.6.2	Why not ?	Ques
1.6.3	Do you own this machine ?	Ques
1.6.4	Or are you the & quot ; tech of the day ? & quot ; Bob	Ques
1.7.1	No I do n't own the machine , I try to it for my dad 's friend .	St
1.7.2	( We do n't live near real techs . )	St
1.7.3	I opened the machine but I ca n't figure out which is the model no .	St
1.7.4	for the mother board .	St
1.7.5	But I have some numbers of the mother board that might help .	St
1.7.6	Intel 810 , Intel 82801AA , Intel 82810AA .	St
1.7.7	The model no .	Res
1.7.8	of the modem is MD-CN5614CH .	St
1.7.9	The model no .	Res
1.7.10	of the sound card is CT4750 or MM-CT4751 .	St
1.7.11	Sincerely , & quot ; The tech of the day & quot ;	St
1.8.1	The Intel 82801aa can be an onboard sound chip and is paired with that 82810 as you can read in posts for people looking for drivers from http : //www.google.com/search ? num=20 & hl=en & lr= & ie=UTF-8 & oe=UTF-8 & q=82801AA & btnG=Google+Search You 'll want to look for names on the motherboard or if the OS is somewhat functional try Belarc 's Free Advisor and post the results here .	St
1.8.2	http : //www.belarc.com/free_download.html At the heart of your problems is identifying the make/model of said boards .	St
1.8.3	Or you could just load Linux since the latest distributions seems to carry more drivers than I ever imagined .	St
1.8.4	I will also write that Windows ME is a poor choice for hardware you ca n't identify since of Windows 95 , 98 and ME , Windows ME has the lowest number of natively supported hardware ( ie .	St
1.8.5	drivers . )	St
1.8.6	You have to work the hardest to install that version .	St
