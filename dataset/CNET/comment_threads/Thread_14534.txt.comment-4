Roger, are you saying they told you the motherboard costs $18 or did I misunderstand.
The tech support lady I spoke with says the motherboards cost about $350.
Both prices seem out of whack to me but then again, I don't know that much about computers.
John: Thanks for your input.
The more and more I think about it the more I want to just return the pc and get a new one, this time from a local vendor so if there's a problem I can just bring it back.
