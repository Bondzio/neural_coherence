my floppy drive was working and all i did was uninstall word 2003 and now the floppy drive does not detect my disks nor does it format them the operating system is windows xp pro.
when i look in my computer it shows that it is there and when i look at device manager it says it is working.
why does it not detect i have a floppy disk in it and why does it say it is working when it does not work i can not save anything on a floppy now that it does not work can some one tell me what to do to check to make sure that it truly is working i have tried several floppy disks and still nothing even brand new floppy disks
