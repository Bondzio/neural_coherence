hi, i have an oldish linksys befsr41 router.
however it keeps killing the connection to all computers, requiring power down of modem and router (plugging the modem right into my computer works fine).
i've tried troubleshooting the router and i'm fed up, its time for a new networking solution.
i've been using wired but i'm wondering if i should change to wireless?
how reliable are the wireless routers, and the wireless cards i presumably would have to buy for each desktop i want to give an internet connection?
any recommendations?
thanks!
