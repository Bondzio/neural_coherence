that's 25 users per hot spot.
as you know that wifi is half duplex, shared access and some waps don't work well with high user counts (high user count by my definition is) over handful, you need to be very clear that reliability is not going to be given for the wireless connections.
wired is still king for reliability.
if you want to open your company to possible lawsuits and a bad future with a client, go ahead and make wifi reliability claims.
the office i work with would never sign up for that area.
