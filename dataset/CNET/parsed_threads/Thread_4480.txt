<s> Hello I have Intel's D845HV mother board and P4 2GHz CPU. </s>
<s> I know its old! </s>
<s> but I need the best graphic card that works with that board. </s>
<s> I currently have nVidia GeForce 4 4800 Ti which is damaged somehow so I need to change it. </s>
<s> I want best graphic card which suites this board. </s>
<s> thank you Info about my board can be found here: http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d845hv/ </s>

<s> ...you consider the output of your power supply before purchasing a new card. </s>
<s> Most require 300W+. </s>
<s> The output of the 12V rail is also important. </s>
<s> Thanks for the replay. </s>
<s> How can I know that a certain graphic card is compatible with my mainboard? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Inside your case, on the mainboard, you will notice several slots that are white, and one that is brown, the brown slot being above the white slots. </s>
<s> The brown slot is your AGP slot. </s>
<s> This is where you want to install your AGP graphics card. </s>
<s> Go to a site such as Newegg, and search Video Cards -&gt; AGP X4/X8. </s>
<s> Although you're mainboard will only produce X4 AGP speeds, installing a card that supports X8 is okay. </s>
<s> Is this a custom built PC, or an OEM bought from Dell, HP, eMachines, etc. </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> The AGP slot is keyed to keep you from plugging in one that's incompatible so all I ever need to do (besides check the power supply) is to look at the slot and the card. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you all for replaying It is custom built PC. </s>
<s> I'm going to check what is available on the market and install it. </s>
<s> I'll report back when I'm done. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Do not overlook the power supply. </s>
<s> Inside your case, on the power supply, you should see a label with several, perhaps confusing, numerical values. </s>
<s> You want to find the value that represents the Total Watt Output - or something like that. </s>
<s> If it is below 300W, I would consider replacing the power supply as well. </s>
<s> The good news is that your case is probably standard ATX. </s>
<s> You should be able to install a good 500W + power supply without problems - if you need to. </s>
<s> It is AOpen case.. </s>
<s> I think its standard case, can't say for sure. </s>
<s> The power supply doesn't show any number or table. </s>
<s> I can't find anaything written on it. </s>
<s> So I don't know the power output. </s>
<s> There is only small label on the power supply written on it, QC pass ese 016316 then a table of number, and number 4 is ticked. </s>
<s> Try unscrewing the power supply from the case (if you haven't already), and search the areas &quot;hidden&quot; due to the case. </s>
<s> Honestly, given the age of your mainboard and graphics card, you're probably ready for a new power supply. </s>
<s> Use Newegg, or you're favorite retailer, and find something with at least 450W. </s>
<s> Good brands include PC Power & Cooling, OCZ, Antec, and a few others. </s>
<s> Newegg.com's (no, I don't work for them, they just happen to be the best, in my opinion) customer reviews happen to be very reliable. </s>
<s> When purchasing hardware, I often pay close attention to what others are saying about products I'm interested in. </s>
<s> You may find the reviews to be helpful. </s>
<s> Happy Hunting! </s>
<s> Michael </s>
<s> I would like to know what you bought finally because I'm looking for a replacement to same old card you have. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
