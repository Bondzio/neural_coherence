elevate the rear of the laptop away from the surface anyway you deem necessary.
most cooling pads are generic or universal fit, but are better than nothing and proactive in thier task.
i agree with the other posters in thier suggestions.
one simple thing i do when possible, is use a 6in.
personal ac type desk fan and simply blow across or directly underneath the laptop.
the noise level of the fan is very tolerable and in a office enviroment, hardly noticable.
good luck -----willy
