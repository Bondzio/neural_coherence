<s> I am using Windows XP and I am the administrator and have my son set up as one of the users. </s>
<s> I'd like to know if it's possible to set up or require a password if someone wanted to send something to the printer. </s>
<s> My printer software does not allow this option, so I wondered if there was something that could be done on the XP side of things or on user settings. </s>
<s> The only thing I found and changed was the times the printer could be accessed so I just set it for 1 min from midnight to 1 min after that since my son would not be up to use the printer at that time so I'm safe The only thing is, I am then limited to only those times if I want to print......so requiring a password would be easier. </s>

<s> Find the Security Tab on your printer. </s>

<s> I dont have an NTFS volume so I dont have a security tab. </s>
<s> Do I have any other options that your aware of? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Do you have XP Home or Pro? </s>
<s> If Pro, it should partition as NTFS by default. </s>
<s> Right click on the HD and check Properties. </s>
<s> Under the &quot;General&quot; tab, it should show your file system and it will be FAT32 or NTFS. </s>
<s> If FAT32, it can be converted to NTFS. </s>
<s> If NTFS, Bob is correct about unchecking simple file sharing. </s>
<s> Now, if you have XP Home, it basically uses simple file sharing and you cannot change that anywhere. </s>
<s> However, you can set permissions for users by starting in &quot;Safe Mode&quot;. </s>
<s> I have not tried this with printers, however, so you would need to check this yourself. </s>
<s> You would want permission granted to yourself and administrators only. </s>
<s> You would make sure no one not authorized such permissions was given them by user name or group. </s>
<s> You may post back your finding if more specific instruction is needed. </s>
