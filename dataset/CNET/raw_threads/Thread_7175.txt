On my keyboard pack it says that most users will experience around 6 months of battery life but i realise that when playing fps games you send out a craplot more signals since your fingers are almost always pressed on 2 mor more keys (WASD kinda stuff) so i would expect the battery life to decrease... Has anybody had any experience with microsoft keyboards? And if so care to share? ThanksYou =]

Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop &quot;The company claims that the mouse and keyboard can last a whopping six months on just two standard, AA batteries and three months on just one battery.&quot;
