<s> I'm looking for the right approach on adding some devices to my home network. </s>
<s> I have a dual band NETGEAR WNDR3700 router running both g and n. That router is downstairs but my son has his laptop, xbox and new desktop in his bedroom with no wired ethernet. </s>
<s> At first I was just going to buy a wireless n adaptor for his desktop but then thought we'd be better off with a wireless access point and then connect each of his three devices to it with gigabit ethernet. </s>
<s> Does that seem like the right solution? </s>
<s> If so what access points support n and gigbit ethernet? </s>
<s> If that is not viable then which Netgear wireless adaptor will give the best performance? </s>
<s> Seems like a PCI card will give better performance than a USB adaptor? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> After some research I figured what I'm looking for is a wireless bridge. </s>
<s> I'd prefer a netgear bridge because intuitively I feel like it will just &quot;work better&quot; than another brand with my netgear wireless router. </s>
<s> However, the netgear WN2000RPT is only single band N and 100Mb ethernet while the LINKSYS WET610N and the D-Link DAP-1522 are both dual band N and 1Gb ethernet. </s>
<s> Having 1Gb ethernet is preferable so I can blast files between the two computers connected to the bridge. </s>
<s> Which do you think is a better solution? </s>
<s> Any ideas welcome. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I am going to assume you are running g on 2.4 and n on 5 on your dual band router. </s>
<s> Although you can set the 2.4 to g and n it will not really run both at the same time. </s>
<s> That is part of the reason to run 2 radios and separate the N and G. Although you can run 2 band on only N if all your equipment supports it. </s>
<s> Your best bet is to get rid of all your g stuff or make sure all your equipment that is going to run N can run at 5g which almost always means it is dual band. </s>
<s> Be careful what you buy a bridge is just that it converts the ethernet port to wireless and allows it to connect to another router. </s>
<s> They in general do not allow wireless client PC to connect to them. </s>
<s> You could place a second router behind. </s>
<s> There are things called wireless extenders that are wireless in and out. </s>
<s> They tend to be a challenge to setup because of all the radio bands and WPA keys. </s>
<s> If you are transferring wireless to wireless do not expect any great performance. </s>
<s> Having a gig port does not mean a lot when you look at N running 300m. </s>
<s> The 300m number is some lab thing that nobody gets. </s>
<s> Then if both machines are on the same frequency the 300m is divided by 2 since the it is shared so you are down to 150m. </s>
<s> Even then it is nowhere close to 150m. </s>
<s> The only way to get wireless to wireless speed is to transfer one machine on 5g and another on 2.4 and then in a lab you might get 300m. </s>
<s> Gig ports are mostly just marketing garbage on consumer routers. </s>
<s> Even if you go Ethernet to Ethernet with cable you will get nowhere near 1G. </s>
<s> You have to use a feature called jumbo frames to make it work which is not supported on most consumer routers. </s>
<s> Also the gig port in most PC's is built into the chipsets and have a limit of 400m. </s>
<s> You need a motherboard than is designed with a port to really run gig and these are mostly used for servers. </s>
