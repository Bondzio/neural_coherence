ok You see, what I'm trying to create is the ultimate gaming machine for myself.
I've got a good idea to what is going to have, but I'm just contemplating how to cool it and make it quite, flexability of over clocking, etc.
This is what I was kinda thinking of: Stuff it with loads of water cooling tubes which are being fed with realy cold water.
Use some custom components like a radiator that emits cool air, some taps to controll the flow of water to the different components, and a realy big slow rotating fan to keep the air moving inside the comp.
I want to completely enclose it to stop my cat's hair getting inside of it.
(loads of it keeps gathering on the metal grid at the intake) Some good software/hardware that measures the heat levels in the comp.
