hey.
i also am encountering the problem with the hp pavilion f1703.
i have read most of this forum and am sure that my tft has the same old problem.
it goes to black in a few seconds until a new screen turns up and shows that for 2 seconds and then goes black again.
when i use a bright flashlight i can see that the tft is showing something but way to dark.
so this way i'm sure i am dealing with the problem many people are facing.
the point is, i am dutch and find it hard to understand the names in english of the objects that need to be repaired or re-soldered.
also am i not quite sure of what needs to be soldered to what.
i mean, are there things that need to be soldered together or just back in place?
there are these silver linings on the the green board (how professional does that sound ) and i find it hard to see or understand if the soldering should be attached to that or not.
hopefully someone can help me and is this topic not yet out-dated.
looking forwards to your reactions.
greets jasonvoorhees13
