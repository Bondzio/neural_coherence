When you boot up the computer is the harddrive showing on the black and white bootscreen?
How do you know the harddrive isn't seen anymore?
What happens if you use the windows bootdisk and you get to the A: drive.......can you change to the C: drive?
If you can, then the drive is seen and you can install Windows as long as your bootdisk gave you cdrom support.
Need more info, please... TONI
