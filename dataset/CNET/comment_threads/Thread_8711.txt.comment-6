This update is in relation to any tv monitor hdmi dvi vga dsub that you can connect to a pc now depending on what ops sys you are using they should work in the same way and to function correctly you may also have to update your monitor driver and the firmware update for your tv which may require you to use some kind of usb memory stick the same applys to blu ray and dvd players but do not confuse this with dvd rom player devices as windows does this for you automatically i hope this helps Yours robjlee64
