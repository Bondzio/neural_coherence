ok.. so i got home from work today.. and took another look inside my dimension 9100... it doesn't look like the pic for the dell adaptor show.... it doesn't split the power in half.. in fact it appears to be all one input like an atx... now i'm really confused... can i cange the power suppy?
do i need that adaptor?
will an new atx just fir right in?
