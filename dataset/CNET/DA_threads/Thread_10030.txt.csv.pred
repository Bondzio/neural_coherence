1.1.1	I'm looking at purchasing an external hard drive that connects via firewire(IEEE 1394).	St
1.1.2	It seems there are two kinds, 4 and 6 wire.	St
1.1.3	I have a PCI firewire card that I know accepts the 4 wire variety .	St
1.1.4	What is the 6 wire used for?	St
1.1.5	and will my card accept both?	St
1.2.1	In short, the 6 wire can carry power to the device.	St
1.2.2	In a nutshell, a 4 wire device can be wired to a 6 wire port but not always the opposite.	St
