I work for a company that does the same thing (chipco computers) but we are the fraction of the size of systemax. I would love to pick up the business, but there is nobody to turn talk to with all of these online resellers. Just curious on who these customer that have been with systemax for 25+ years are going to rely on for computers. we have recieved a couple calls, but i figured there would be a panic. Not seeming that way.

I have a buddy that was (and still is!) in the custom desktop PC biz and it's sad to see how small his business has shrunk. He eeks out a meager living but it looks to be a single digit per cent of what he did just a decade ago. Desktops are not a place to explore for new business for most folk. Bob

I just feel that there are enough enthusiast out there to keep the pc alive. while the facebook stalkers and the news readers love the ease and convenience of tablets and phones. I do think that there is a nitch for those who want to see there windows score at 7.9, boot in 8 seconds, stare at there 4 monitors, and fill there 8 terabytes that you can never max out with a pc. Also, it is hard to play the new call of duty that is coming out on a tablet. Lastly the though i have sold hundreds of laptops and tablets to elementary schools for 7 year olds all the way up to universities, i feel that the computer lab needs to stick around as well as the desktops in business. the better way to put this, is though i know desktops are diminishing, i do not see them going away. With this being said is there a place for custom whitebox builders or are we going to throw in the towel to dell, hp, and lenovo. Because frankly they are often not competitive, they use the same parts, does the name DELL really make people feel that warm and cozy

Further, these are more customize able compared to anything else out there. Laptops and tablets are becoming the connectivity leaders but they lack any real meaty attitude unless you make it that way. But, if that's what users want and cost is reasonable thre you have it. But, it doesn't matter to me as I fix anything and some old stuff still comes in for repair as that what the customer wants, no ifs, ands, or buts, just make it go again. tada -----Willy
