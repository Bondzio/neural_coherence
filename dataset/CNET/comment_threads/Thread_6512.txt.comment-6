...how do you know they are running efficiently, as well as effectively?
If you are as clueless as I am, you might want to download SpeedFan (its available on CNet at http://www.download.com/SpeedFan/3000-2094_4-10516200.html?tag=lst-0-1 ).
SpeedFan will both monitor your fan speeds and allow you to tweak them based on temperature.
I've used it for a few months now with no problems.
My off-the-shelf system came with two internal fans, and I can tell that it runs much more quietly--more often--than it used to.
When the CPU and HDD get active, so do the fans; when the computer is idle, the noise factor is negligible.
I don't know if post-OEM fans come with similar software, but if not, you can save on noise pollution, wear-and-tear, and maybe even a little money on your electric bill for free!
