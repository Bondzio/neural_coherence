One feature about an AMD processor is that it sits low in the Ziff socket.
The edge of the Ziff socket is slightly higher than the CPU chip surface.
The AMD Fan/Heatsink combo has a indented cut edge that allows the surface of the heatsink to touch the CPU surface.
If you reverse this heatsink, then the surfaces do not mate.
I have seen a half dozen motherboards that had the heatsink reversed and powered down because of inadequate cooling.
(The CPU Heat Diode worked).
Reversing the heatsink so that the cut edge fits over the Ziff socket raised edge solved the problem in every case.
Also you cannot use a Pentium Fan/heatsink on an AMD because it has no cut edge.
