i have seen various wd external drives which will fail to connect to one computer but work perfectly with another.
in fact, i have one.
used to work fine with my desktop machine but now is not recognized on any usb port.
however, it works fine on several of my notebook computers.
i suspect it is a usb driver problem on the desktop.
be sure to try another computer before taking it apart for a new interface or using any special disk software!
