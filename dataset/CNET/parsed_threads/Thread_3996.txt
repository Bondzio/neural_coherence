<s> A co-worker of mine is having problems with a noisy hard drive. </s>
<s> The HD appears to be &quot;working&quot; (HD light flashing along with the noisy &quot;clicking&quot; coming from the HD itself), but it will do this continuously, even when she is not using her computer. </s>
<s> She is running WinXP. </s>
<s> The only thing I've found on the matter so far is that the HD is preparing to crash, but this machine is new (about 2 months old) and I have read that crashing is a problem of older noisy drives. </s>
<s> What could or would be causing the noise? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help. </s>
<s> Two months old? </s>
<s> Backup all important files IMMEDIATELY. </s>
<s> Make it a warranty issue. </s>
<s> Did it come with the computer or was it purchased separately? </s>
<s> HD model number? </s>
<s> I don't know the HD model number (I posted yesterday, she is out today). </s>
<s> I am inclined to agree that the HD is faulty, but our latest suspicion is that the computer may not actually be ''new.'' </s>
<s> When she received the machine, the case had a few dings on the front, and then the side panel (which you would remove to service it) fell off. </s>
<s> We were able to put it right back on, but it probably would not have been loose if someone hadn't been inside it to begin with (just suspicions). </s>
<s> She saves all her work to the server, so she doesn't necessarily risk losing her work, but we are still worried about it. </s>
<s> And we're VERY skeptical about the legitimacy of the computer itself. </s>
