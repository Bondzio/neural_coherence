<s> Current wireless situation: Modem has recently been moved along with wireless router to accommodate future streaming video to Toshiba HDTV. </s>
<s> (mistake Blue-ray is wrong model for streaming video). </s>
<s> This leaves my printer in another location, no longer connected to the wireless router I can no longer print from anywhere. </s>
<s> The printer is located near another broadband connection and is an All-in-one that connects with USB (has Ethernet option). </s>
<s> Though the cable is live, it is now presently unused. </s>
<s> Between the two wants: 1. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I went both VGA and HDMI from my laptop and it's working fine. </s>
<s> Sadly I find many challenged by this setup. </s>
<s> Another member pointed out this new Dell box -&gt; http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/inspiron-zino-hd?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19 NOT a bad idea. </s>
<s> Sorry I don't own one as I use a laptop for that position. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I just picked up a HP C4780 wifi printer and yes it works and yes it was a PAIN IN THE NET to set up. </s>
<s> YES I got it working but after 4 hours I was about to pack it up until I thought it over one more time. </s>
<s> It appears it was having trouble with the 802.11n router. </s>
<s> I guessed and set the router to 802.11g mode and now it's ok. </s>
<s> But there's a new lesson here. </s>

<s> Thank you for the quick response. </s>
<s> Does your laptop have a HDMI connection or is there a cable that runs between VGA and HDMI? </s>
<s> My VGA signal is not recognized by the TV. </s>
<s> I have a request for information out there to Toshiba -- I'm using a VGA cable (15 pin, male both ends, to connect the two). </s>
<s> So far no response. </s>
<s> The printer is not something I do not want to replace, got a great deal on it and it is more heavy duty (small business vs home use). </s>
<s> I'd rather move all equipment back if I could find an alternate way to stream movies (more important to my husband than me-- I need the office capability). </s>
<s> I'm taking a serious look at the Dell you sent the link for, thanks again. </s>

<s> Today, it's connected with the HDMI connection. </s>
<s> I can use VGA but because the HDMI pipes audio it's a cleaner solution. </s>
<s> 2, My VGA signal is not recognized by the TV. </s>
<s> I have a request for information out there to Toshiba -- I'm using a VGA cable (15 pin, male both ends, to connect the two). </s>
<s> So far no response. </s>
<s> Yes it's troublesome for some to setup. </s>
<s> I used the clone display option. </s>
<s> Some have not played with dual displays or it just doesn't work for some. </s>
<s> Let's just say I futz with it and so far I usually get it to work unless it's some OS the owner loaded and there is a missing driver or bum OS install. </s>

<s> There are small print server boxes galore out there. </s>
<s> From 25 to much higher prices. </s>
<s> But the problem I see is some of them falter on features. </s>
<s> Such as my wifi HP C4780 lets me scan from any machine. </s>
<s> 4, I'm taking a serious look at the Dell you sent the link for, thanks again. </s>
<s> RAMARC, a member posted that. </s>
<s> Nice find. </s>
<s> I had missed that one. </s>

<s> Ha! </s>
<s> I picked the same printer up the Monday after Thanksgiving when Staples had a sale, buy a new laptop, get the printer for $40. </s>
<s> When I tried to connect the printer to the router it would not connect after repeated tries, wouldn't even turn on. </s>
<s> The next day I boxed it up and returned it to Staples. </s>
<s> They swapped it for another one, same model. </s>
<s> The replacement one worked perfectly. </s>
