<s> Hi all, I recently purchased some new RAM for my computer from Staples, at the same time as I purchased the new computer that I bought. </s>
<s> At Staples they assured me that the RAM was compatible with my computer. </s>
<s> However, after installing the RAM myself I have found that my computer is not recognizing that there is any RAM. </s>
<s> I was wondering if anyone could help me. </s>
<s> I already had 4GB of RAM installed, and I installed another 4GB of RAM. </s>
<s> I am using Ubuntu x64 so it will recognize more RAM, and I checked in my BIOS to make sure. </s>
<s> Only 4GB is showing up. </s>
<s> The RAM is pushed in &quot;all the way&quot;, and I know that my RAM port is working. </s>
<s> My computer is a HP Pavilion g6-2235. </s>
<s> The RAM that I purchased has the information below. </s>
<s> I am somewhat of a beginner and do not know what all of the data below is for, but if you can make sense of it then let me know. </s>
<s> L/4G-DDR3-1066 SODIM 4GB PC8500 DDR3 1066 MHZ 9857462 I read online doing BIOS updates maybe, but I don't know how to do a BIOS update (or how it would be useful). </s>
<s> Let me know if any of you can help me! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Pavilion%20g6-2235us&Cat=RAM That seems to say what you bought is not supported ram. </s>
<s> Also note that section in red about matched pairs. </s>
<s> The quickest test for ram is remove the current ram and replace with new. </s>
<s> If the new ram works OK, alone then you have mismatched or improper combo. </s>
<s> If it doesn't work, you have a probable bad or true unrecognized ram which the bios won't allow. </s>
<s> In some cases, updating the bios should get the most of many ram setups, BUT not all. </s>
<s> if the bios is done and the new ram works, then you have your fix, install the other ram. </s>
<s> As the other poster offered, if the ram is NOT as required, that too will fail. </s>
<s> Here's what I do in many cases. </s>
<s> I installed PCWizard 2012, to check the ram status. </s>
<s> The ram status will show what your current ram is. </s>
<s> Then you match that against any newly brought ram or compatible types. </s>
<s> Understand faster ram may work, only if the bios allows it and part of its current standing. </s>
<s> If there too much difference, it should fail as its suppose to. </s>
<s> -OR- Return ram and have them explain why it didn't work when their sales people said it would. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
