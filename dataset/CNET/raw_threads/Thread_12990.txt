(Two months ago) Yesterday I was rearranging my computer room, after getting everything where I wanted it and hooking everything back up, my 1TB hd is not recognized by the computer and when I turn it on, the blue light blinks and it continually beeps. Running win XP Pro, P-4, 2.53, 2 G ram. any suggestions? Thanks, Bill

I then disconnected everything in order to start again. I found that I had two identical input power cords, I changed the two and everything is working fine. Thanks, Bill
