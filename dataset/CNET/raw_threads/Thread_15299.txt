I own a Medion computer, running XP home, with P4 2.8 gh proccessor, a gig of ram, a 128mb Nvidia fx 5700 vidio card, and an internal 100ish Gb hard drive&gt; I am not sure of what the power supply is. My problem is that, occationally, the computer just won't start. When I push the power button, the computer begins startup, and goes all the way to the screen where it, I think, is listing the hardware, and has a big Energy- or Eco-Star logo. As the computer starts up, it makes a bit of noise, which is normal, but when it gets about halfway through this page, the sound slowly dies away, and it stops. I have tried pressing the &quot;DEL&quot; or &quot;F1&quot; key, or what ever it is, to enter BIOS, but all it does it make a beeping sound whenever I hit the key. This prolem seems to occer after we have neglected to run Ad-Aware Se Personal for a while, and when we run it, we normally find about seven critical objects, but nothing to indicate a virus. We have a windows firewall as well, and also have the PC-Cillian antivirus program. We try to run Ad-Aware Se Personal and Spybot Search and Destroy regularly, but whenever we forget, we have to problem. We normally fix the problem by just turning the computer on and off several times, or occationally we can get into the BIOS and start the computer. We have tried many different things, and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions
