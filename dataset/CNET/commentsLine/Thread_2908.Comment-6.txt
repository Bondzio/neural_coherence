that's a video card.
if this video card has sata connections, my turkey came with 4 legs.
sorry but i thought the question was about if you can use any sata connection.
so far i've found it can matter.
so you can try if you like but it would be nice if the make, model of what sata drive controller is being used so we can check our notes.
