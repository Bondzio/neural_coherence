<s> I need to know how to connect back my front panel I/O pins in my Dell Dimension 4600 (Dell F4491 or N2828 MotherBoard). </s>
<s> I have no idea on how to connect back my Switch On/Off, Power LED wires. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>

<s> Yes, I have checked the system docs, but the document doesnt have enough detail. </s>
<s> The Dell site also proved to be useless. </s>
<s> With the power out I find the block that has the usual pins for HDD light, power LED and the power on switch. </s>
<s> I take a &quot;pop jumper&quot; (see http://media.digikey.com/photos/FCI%20Photos/71363-102LF,%2071363-202LF.jpg for a big image) or other such item and test for which pair turns on the machine. </s>
<s> Then I know the pair for the power on jumper. </s>
<s> Now I can use an LED for the other functions. </s>
<s> I made no effort to look for documentation. </s>
<s> I leave that to you but will share the old school way. </s>

<s> That is the connection for use in a Dell case. </s>
<s> The Dell case uses a connection that needs no documentation so they didn't create it. </s>
<s> Maybe you need to research the documentation for the Dell case next time as that MIGHT have the wiring or pin out since it's not needed for the main board. </s>

<s> not visible in the PIC you provided ... you might ask one of the MODERATORs to move this thread to the DELL FORUM. </s>
<s> I looked on the Dell site and I wasn't able to find anything re the pin outs for that JUMPER BLOCK. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> But I can guess now what the issue is. </s>
<s> The OP likely obtained a Dell motherboard or moved a Dell motherboard from a Dell case to a generic case. </s>
<s> That explains why they couldn't just plug it in. </s>
