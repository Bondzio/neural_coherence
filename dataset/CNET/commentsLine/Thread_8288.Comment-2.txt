if i install ubuntu it will ask me where to install and what boot loader to use.
at no time am i partitioning or formatting ahead of the install.
those that do such tend to blow up there installed os.
bob step 4 of  shows this.
again i have to wonder why so many want to make this harder than it needs to be.
