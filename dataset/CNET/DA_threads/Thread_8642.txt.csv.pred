1.1.1	Hi I 'll explain what I want to do : I have a laptop running Windows XP that has a wireless card inside .	St
1.1.2	I have a Single Board Computer ( SBC ) running Linux that has an 'wireless access point ' connected to one of it 's Ethernet ports .	St
1.1.3	I want to be able to transfer data between the laptop and the SBC wirelessly ( cabling is not an option ) How do I achieve this ?	Ques
1.1.4	I think most of the work will be involved configuring the wireless point and the SBC running Linux ( Fedora ) .	St
1.1.5	The 'wireless access point ' I am using is the EnGenius EOC5611P - it can be configured for : 1 .	St
1.1.6	Access Point 2 .	St
1.1.7	Client Bridge 3 .	St
1.1.8	WDS Bridge 4 .	St
1.1.9	Client Router I do n't know which one of these I need , so working that out would be a good start !	St
1.1.10	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	You have quiet a few options that will work .	St
1.2.2	I would set it up as a access point so that if you ever want more wireless stuff to hook up it will be all set .	St
1.2.3	This is also the simplest to setup .	St
1.2.4	Still just to get started I would cable you pc to you other machine to get all the file sharing stuff working before you add a wireless layer to it .	St
