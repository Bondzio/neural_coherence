This might be a dumb question, but here goes.
I have a GeForce FX 5500 video card that fit in my old motherboard's AGP slot.
Now my new motherboard doesn't have a AGP slot only, PCI and PCI Express.
The problem is that the FX5500 doesn't physically fit into the PCI slots, it's too long.
I planning on buying a new video card for the new motherboard, but how will I know what card will physically fit into the slots?
