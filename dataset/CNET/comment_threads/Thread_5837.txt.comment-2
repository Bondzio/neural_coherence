When you cleaned it, did you carefully pull the lable back to expose the shaft and place a small drop of oil on it.
WD-40, 3-in-1, or Marvel Mystery oil all works.
This will help the noise, My question to you is: Do you have another fan for the case and does the power supply fan exhaust out the back.
Heat raises and if the only fan you have is the PS then all the heat will be going into your PS and slowly over time heat it up.
