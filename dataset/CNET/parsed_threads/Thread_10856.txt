<s> Hi all - My XPS410 (WinXP, 4gB ram) began having startup problems this morning. </s>
<s> Upon power up, it gets to the Windows XP startup screen, the blue dots scroll back and forth for about 20-30 seconds, then the monitor goes blank. </s>
<s> I can start the computer in safe mode OK. </s>
<s> I used system restore to go backwards a couple of days, but no luck with that either. </s>
<s> What am I missing here?? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> While in safe mode, set the video mode to 800 by 600. </s>
<s> Ok your way out and then click, Start, shutdown, restart. </s>
<s> I did try that with no luck - thanks for the suggestion. </s>
<s> I have noticed that when the Windows startup screen goes blank, I then hear the hard drive spin down. </s>
<s> I have disabled all the services and startup entries in MSCONFIG, that made no difference. </s>
<s> I have removed RAM sticks one pair at a time, as well as individually, also with no change. </s>
<s> That tidbit would have changed my advice. </s>
<s> In this case I would head back to safe mode and research all items in MSCONFIG and see what I could disable. </s>
<s> Remember I would not leave any any entry enabled unless I knew why. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
