The connecting cable consists of a large multi-pin connector at the printer end (possibly an 'IEEE 1284'?
), and what is definitely a usb (with usb 'trident' symbol on plug) connector on the PC end.
Somewhere along the way in the investigations, I read that you would sometimes need to 'set up' or install something for the type of connection -- as maybe this hadn't all been settled as of the birth of this printer circa 2ooo.
Anyway, the cable is what came with the LaserJet, as I recall, and it's also in good condition.
And the front panel of the printer says LaserJet 2100M, for what that's worth.
(keep wondering if either usb or networking basics weren't as plug-&-play back then ?
and how to reconfigure ?)
As mentioned, this feels very close to possible, but there is some bottleneck somewhere..... thanks
