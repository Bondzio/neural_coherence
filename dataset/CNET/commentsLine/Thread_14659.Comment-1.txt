i want to know what is the best graphics card and power supply i can get for my dell inspiron 580. here are my current specs.
operating system: windows 7 home premium 64-bit processor: intel(r) core(tm) i5 cpu 760 @ 2.80ghz (4 cpus), ~2.8ghz memory: 8192mb ram card name: ati radeon hd 5450 wattage: 300 w (i have a 500 w power supple someone gave me if i can match a good graphics card that can run games like skyrim at top settings that can run on 500 w that would be ideal, if not i have no problem upgrading) as stated, my intentions for the pc is being able to play games like skyrim at top settings, and if possible be able to record games without it causing too much fps lose.
my spending limit would probably be 500, not much more than that.
i know i will not be able to get top of the line graphics card, but i am not looking for top of the line, but the top of the line i can get for 500 (in combination with a power supply, and if need be a new case)
