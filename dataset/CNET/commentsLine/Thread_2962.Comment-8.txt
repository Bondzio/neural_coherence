while you need to check your work (cmos clear jumpers and such) there is some that run into this dead system where the cpu and motherboard are good but doesn't boot.
i made that mistake last week with a new socket 775 system.
in the end i had to hit the maker's web site and my 775 dual core cpu wasn't on the list.
details are missing so no one but you can check this out.
