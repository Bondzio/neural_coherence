I have Sony VAIO VGC-RC210G it comes with an ATI X300 PCI-e. Needless to say it's a bit low on the gaming scale.
So I was looking to upgrade to say an ATI 1900 xtx, or Similar.
I was wondering if any one with a RC210G has upgraded there graphics card and to what, ATI, Nvidia?
Also how well it works for you?
