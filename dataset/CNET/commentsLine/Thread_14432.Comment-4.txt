as for what product to recommend, i can not recommend any product... but i use linksys wireless router 54g, and i also have two mac laptop in my network, they work as it should... by the way, i also use airport express as my repeater/range expander.
fastest and cheapest??
speed will be determine by the current standard, which is 54mbps, (line of sight and interference around it, can decrease the speed and range) prize are almost the same (but, please note that, apple product are more expensive than non apple product)
