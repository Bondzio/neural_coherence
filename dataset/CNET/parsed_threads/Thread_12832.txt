<s> I work in a public school and I want to network a printer that I have. </s>
<s> I was wondering what is the best way to do that? </s>
<s> Could I use a slightly older spare computer and set that up as a print server? </s>
<s> Or should I just use an external printer server like an HPJetDirect print server? </s>
<s> If I was going to use a spare computer as a printer server, can anyone give me some direction as to how to set it up? </s>
<s> &quot;Could I use a slightly older spare computer and set that up as a print server?&quot; Absolutely. </s>
<s> Remember that depending on how reliable it is, people will be be pestering you to fix it whenever and wherever you are. </s>
<s> &quot;Or should I just use an external printer server like an HPJetDirect print server?&quot; I like those. </s>
<s> When they work (99.999% do just fine), they just work and never need a reboot. </s>
<s> &quot;If I was going to use a spare computer as a printer server, can anyone give me some direction as to how to set it up?&quot; If I was going to do this, I'd load up Linux and make this a SMB Printer Share. </s>
<s> Fine books and web sites abound on the internet, but your choice here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My wife is tech coordinator in a small parocial school and, lucky me, I get to give volunteer time with the hardware. </s>
<s> We've done it both ways and the print server is better especially if you have multiple OSs on your PCs there. </s>
<s> The saved space is also a plus. </s>
<s> They're not that hard to set up and the newer JetAdmin software HP uses is much improved over the old. </s>
<s> A jet direct or other device will work best for several reasons. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Cost. </s>
<s> I just purcahsed three Intel Netexpress Print servers for about 15 dollars each. </s>
<s> Each has three ports. </s>
<s> How much would a low end PC cost? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Ease of setup. </s>
<s> The Jet direct or net express or any of them really, usually have a nice and simple set up. </s>
<s> Windows 2000 and up can usually set these up as ip ports or the device may even mimic an SMB server. </s>
<s> In any case, they are diffrent, but still easy to set up. </s>
<s> How long will it take to set up a system devoted to being a prin server. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Space and Location. </s>
<s> A print server device is usually small, has minimal power requirements, never needs to be rebooted, and is in most cases invisible and silent. </s>
<s> I mount mine underneath tables, and you would never know they were there. </s>
<s> Pc....not silent nor small. </s>
<s> And lots more cables needed. </s>
<s> ************************************************ I could go on and on, but I WOULD use a PC based print server to manage access and the spooler in medium or larger (over 15) user envirnments. </s>
<s> Even then it would really be acting as a hub for print server devices. </s>
