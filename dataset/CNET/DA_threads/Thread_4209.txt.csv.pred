1.1.1	Hello Maybe I am asking for the impossible .	St
1.1.2	But I would like to know any third party manufacturer that makes wireless network cards and corresponding drivers/software/hardwork hookup ( if needed ) for a mac g4 desktop system .	St
1.1.3	Optimally it would communicate with a linksys wrt54gs wireless router through a cable modem on a small internet network with two other & quot ; OS & quot ; systems , ( win XP and win98 ) .	St
1.1.4	Mac manufacturer 's seem to have an & quot ; airport & quot ; card or similar device and make it very unclear if there is any other hardware that can be used .	St
1.1.5	this makes it very hard to know what I can use that will work in my situation .	St
1.1.6	If anybody can help me out on this issue I would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.2.1	I get the Apple product .	St
1.2.2	It will work fine with other wifi networks .	St
1.2.3	Why jump ship ?	Ques
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	wireless network adaptor ( i.e .	St
1.3.2	wusb54g ) , did n't have the drivers for apple.. once your apple have the apple card.. you can connect to other devices ( wrt54gs , etc . )	St
1.3.3	I do n't really know the reasons , why all those manufacturers did n't have the drivers for apple computers .	St
1.4.1	The money .	St
1.4.2	Drivers are expensive to make .	St
1.4.3	With Apple still in the single digit market share that would plague the product with a 10X higher cost per unit for just the driver .	St
1.4.4	Add more dollars for your tech support lines and many manufacturers will just pass .	St
1.4.5	It 's simple to understand once you 're told .	St
