6232	0	199627	2144465	NR	donniall	8/19/06 6:32 AM	1.15596912E12	Wireless networking	Hi, I recently installed a BT Wiress DSL router. I have created a security enabled wiress network (WPA) but notice only one of my two PC's can be connected to the network at a given time? I dont appear to be have the two machines internet-connected at the same time? I pretty sure it's something trivial ..... Any ideas? Note: Network Authentication = WPA-PSK; Data Encyption = AES; Network key is same for both PC's (is this correct?) Help greatly appreciated. Don-

I used to install wireless equipment for a large retail, did hundreds of them. From my experience DSL modems also have a built in DHCP server just like the router. When they both try to assign IP's it is possible to get a duplicate and cause a conflict. If they both have DHCP, turn the DHCP off on one of the two. Also check the IP address of both the modem and the router, these cannot be the same but by default they could be. Let us know if that works.
