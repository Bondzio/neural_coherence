Was getting a similar problem - except that the printer worked fine after just starting the PC - but after a short while - nothing, with the same error message.
If yours is the same problem I dont think it has anything to do with cables.
Instead, check if the USB port to which your printer connected does not automatically power off.
If it does, the virtual printer port associated with USB001 port is disconnected.
To fix this, open 'Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Device Manager' - then open 'Universal Serial Bus controllers' - find the usb port to which the printer is connected (probably one of the 'USB Root Hub' connections - rt-click &gt; Properties - then on the 'Power Management' tab - de-select &quot;Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power&quot;.
Assuming yours is the same problem as I had - this should fix the problem.
Good luck to you.
