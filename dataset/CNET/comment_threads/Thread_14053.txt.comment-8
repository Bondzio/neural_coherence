Hey Konny, Thanks for your input.
Is Gateway's tech support also outsourced to India like Dell and HP or do you actually speak to someone right here in the US?
At first, when I started reading the forums and people were complaining about Indian tech support I thought they were a bunch of racists.
Now that I've had to do the same, and I'm no racist, I can understand their frustration because it can be difficult to understand someone with a strong accent, regardless of where he/she is from, especially over the phone.
When I was at Best Buy and they were pushing a Gateway pc they told me that Gateway's tech support &quot;sucked&quot;.
Of course they were trying to sell me the BB service plan so I don't know if thi statement held any truth.
I guess I'll have to do more research.
