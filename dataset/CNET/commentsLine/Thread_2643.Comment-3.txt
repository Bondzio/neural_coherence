the retail versions of gateways are technically not as good as those offered direct from gateway.
the retail pcs use more low-end components (lower rated power supplies, ddr2-533 vs ddr2-667 ram, i945 instead of i965 chipset, etc.)
but the prices of the retail units are hard-to-beat: $749 for a core2duo, 2gb ram, and 320gb hd.
