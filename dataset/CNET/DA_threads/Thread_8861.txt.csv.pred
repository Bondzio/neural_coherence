1.1.1	I will be buying a netbook and need to install msoffice for reports .	St
1.1.2	Is there a way to do this without also purchasing an external CD/DVD drive ?	Ques
1.1.3	I appreciate any information about how to do this , if there is a way .	St
1.1.4	Thank you , Cathy	St
1.2.1	You need some USB DVDRW eventually to create the restore media .	St
1.2.2	Your choice here but reading the forums today 's owners seem upset when the OS becomes corrupt and they did n't make the media .	St
1.2.3	Back on point .	St
1.2.4	I tried this - & gt ; I copied the Office 2003 CD to some USB memory stick and installed from that .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	thank you for the input .	Polite
1.3.2	How likely is it for the OS to become corrupt ?	Ques
1.3.3	Also , where could I find out how to copy msoffice to a memory stick ?	Ques
1.3.4	This is probably very elementary knowledge but I am not a techie .	St
1.3.5	Thanks again , Cathy	St
1.4.1	That 's the first accessory we bought and I 'm glad we did .	St
1.4.2	Have no doubt that , when talking about hardware/software failure , it 's not a matter of & quot ; if & quot ; but & quot ; when & quot ; .	St
1.4.3	Even the USB drive is going to fail at some point .	St
1.4.4	You can get external CD/DVD drives ( almost all are burners too ) for 50 bucks or under .	St
1.4.5	The difference in cost to you will the drive minus the price of the flash drive .	St
1.4.6	Many ... if not most ... netbooks come with a backup utility that can burn rescue media to such drives .	St
1.4.7	Reconsider , if you can .	St
1.5.1	Sorry but there is nothing new here .	St
1.5.2	Just copy and paste from one to another place .	St
1.6.1	you may use pen drive or external hard disk .	St
1.6.2	You may use USB port for this .	St
1.7.1	You might consider installing Open Office which is free and available via download .	St
1.7.2	The only drawback that I can see is that there is no application like MS Outlook in Open Office .	St
1.8.1	Is open office compatible with msoffice ?	Ques
1.8.2	I have msoffice on my desktop and I will need to save reports made on the netbook to my desktop .	St
1.8.3	Would I be able to save the reports made with open office on the msoffice files ?	Ques
1.8.4	Thanks for any information on this .	St
1.9.1	In a word : NO .	St
1.9.2	Yes , Open Office can open MS Office files through Office 2003 , the version that I have installed on my desktop , but it can not keep the formatting ; therefore , it is NOT compatible .	St
1.9.3	If the formatting is not important to you , then there 's no reason not to try Open Office on your netbook .	St
1.9.4	It 's similar to MS Office , but not identical , so if you 're familiar with MS Office and do n't want to learn new routines , you will be disappointed .	St
1.9.5	If you do n't mind learning new routines , then it may be just what you need and want .	St
1.9.6	Whatever works for you and whatever you like is good , better , and best for you .	St
1.9.7	I you have MS Office 2007 , forget Open Office altogether .	St
1.9.8	I have that on my netbook running Windows 7 Ultimate RC1 .	St
1.9.9	Works perfectly .	St
1.9.10	No problem whatsoever .	St
1.10.1	Look on the MS site for a 60 day trial download of the version of office you are buying and install it .	St
1.10.2	Enter the licence code from your 'purchased ' MS Office .	St
1.10.3	Simple !	St
1.11.1	Thanks for the input regarding open office and msoffice 07 .	St
1.11.2	I am leaning towards getting an external drive .	St
1.11.3	Does it matter what brand external dvd drive or are they all basically the same ?	Ques
1.11.4	Best Buy is offering the ASUS netbook at a good price , though the external dvd drive is $ 89 .	St
1.11.5	But they also recommend getting their initial 'tune-up'which enhances performance , removes things , etc. , for $ 49 Is this tune-up a worthwhile thing to do/invest in for best functioning ?	Ques
1.11.6	Thanks again for any feedback .	St
1.12.1	Are you in the USA ?	Ques
1.12.2	Try http : //www.geeks.com/products_sc.asp ? cat=348 I see new units under 50 .	St
1.12.3	More at newegg.com , amazon , etc .	St
1.12.4	As to the tuneup .	St
1.12.5	Fine way to pay for them to mess up your machine .	St
1.12.6	Bob	St
1.13.1	I like Open Office .	St
1.13.2	I really do n't , however , think & quot ; I do n't have a DVD drive & quot ; is a good reason to switch to it .	St
1.13.3	Switch if you support open computing , or think MS Office is a bloated poopy product , or cuz you wan na stick it to the man , or you 're cheap .	St
1.13.4	I find it not too difficult to switch between MS Office , Star office/open office , iWork .	St
1.13.5	It 's easier nowadays than it ever used to be .	St
1.13.6	Choose & quot ; Save As ... & quot ; and it 's an easy double-click to open as you switch from system to system .	St
1.13.7	But for most people , one office suite is enough .	St
1.13.8	If it were me , I 'd use the interwebs to download install files for MS Office ( trymicrosoftoffice.com ) .	St
1.13.9	It 'll take a while , but it 's not like you have to watch the progress bar the whole time .	St
1.13.10	The tune-up from Best Buy is really quite good on regular laptops .	St
1.13.11	They 'll get it set up , do a lot of the initial chores for less than what I consider a reasonable cost for the time it saves me , and they do a better job than most users are capable to do .	St
1.13.12	I feel the same way about my local garage who changes my oil for about the same price .	St
1.13.13	On netbooks , Best Buy charges more for set-ups but does a lot less , so I 'd not recommend it unless you ca n't manage it yourself .	St
1.13.14	On a netbook with XP , you really just need antivirus and you 're ready to go .	St
1.13.15	Pricewise , if you shop around you 'll save on an external dvd .	St
1.13.16	Big box retailers ca n't make money on netbooks , but they have to pay for those helpful folks , local brick-n-mortar , free interest financing , etc .	St
1.13.17	So accessories are more $ $ there compared to mail-order .	St
