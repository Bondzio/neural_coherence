totally agree in regards to buying ram directly from apple.
it is similar to the mark up of printer ink cartridges.
put your money into the cpu upgrade and increase the ram as needed by buying it elsewhere on the net or even ebay (where you can often find name brands used by apple of 1 gig for less than $20 and 2 gigs for around $60.)
