<s> I have a desktop computer with an Intel Celeron processor, but is just 1.8ghz, so i'm thinking in buying an Intel Celeron Dual Core 2.2ghz (Is just and everyday computer, but I want to play Spore Galactic Adventures and with 1.8ghz I can't) so I found one at great price. </s>
<s> But I wonder, Do I need to buy another heatsink and fan to my desktop, or the ones from my old Celeron work just fine? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your replies. </s>
<s> come with a HS Fan and a 3 year warranty. </s>

<s> Oh, I didn't knew that. </s>
<s> Thanks and sorry to bother again, but, does it comes with the thermal compound/grease? </s>
<s> I recommend you get a small tube of thermal grease just in case you have a problem and need to reapply the grease. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thanks I will. </s>
