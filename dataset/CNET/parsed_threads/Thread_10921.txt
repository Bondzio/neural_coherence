<s> Hello, Like the topic says all my folders on 2 external HD's are shortcuts and when I try and open them I get this error: Windows can't find L:\RECYCLER\68c1039.exe I have run MalwareBytes full scan on all drives in safe mode and nothing has changed. </s>
<s> I'm pretty much out of options at this point, so any help or suggestions would be great! </s>

<s> I don't think so, I have AVG, Ad-Aware and Auto Run Eater running and I do regular weekly scans. </s>
<s> Everything was working fine then suddenly this happened. </s>
<s> Also I'm running Windows 7 x64. </s>
<s> Time to see what Grif's advice finds. </s>
<s> Then Please Try This.. - CNET Spyware, viruses, &amp; security Forums </s>
<s> The virus seems to be still infecting my external HD after I followed all those steps. </s>

<s> So my registry doesn't have the folder directories listed so do I just paste his code into a .txt and save it as a .reg file? </s>
<s> Let's see if others can help you avoid reinstalling the OS. </s>
<s> My view is that registry editing is best done by those that do such. </s>
<s> I can't help you damage the machine further. </s>
