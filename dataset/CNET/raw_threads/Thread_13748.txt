I'm building a new comp strictly for gaming and i cant decide on a CRT or an LCD.. ive read good things about some LCD's such as the Samsung 226BW but i just am not sure if this is what i want to get. I've always played with my resolutions in the past at 1024x768 and I'm worried that an LCD with a big resolution is going to be way to different for me. If someone could advise me on whether to purchase an LCD or a CRT it would be greatly appreciated. By the way i will be running this monitor on an 8800GT, thanks.

If you look at your average 19inch CRT wattage and your LCD even at 20+ inches you find it's less than 1/2 the power. At the office this is enough to pay the difference off in less than a year. Bob

Like i said ive always used 1024x768 and the 226BW's native resolution is like 1600 by something..

What I did. I have a 19&quot; wide screen. I found a 22&quot; wide screen. When I got it home I found out that my Intel graphics card supported about a gazillion resolutions. But not the one specific to the new 22&quot;. Specifically, it supported resolutions above and below the new LCD, but not the exact one. Bummer. I took it back.

Intel has some technical googly **** on their site about issues with hardware/firmware/software compatibility and offers a non-standard driver which won't install on most laptops, including Centrino platforms! Why can't Intel and ATI make video products with simple user customizable driver modes like Nvidia's? I didn't return my 1680x1050 22&quot;. I just dumped Intel and ATI and switched to Nvidia.

I also know that most are only owners and won't know about this. Said file does not come from ATI or Intel but the display maker. Bob

8695	9	273018	2638324	2637585	samkh	11/25/07 9:56 AM	1.19598456E12	I take it back (about Intel & ATI)	Not for the reason that monitor infs help, but because my dock doesn't support non-standard rez. Monitor infs can't fix what's not in the adapter infs; they only serve to hide the modes that a monitor cannot display and therefore eliminate issue of overdriving.
