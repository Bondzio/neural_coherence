But, I forgot which one I bought with the computer. Does anybody know how to check which graphics card you have? -thank you for your time

Start &gt; Ctrl Panel &gt; Display &gt; Advanced &gt; Adapter if you just goto Settings it sometimes does not list the actual adapter, especially if it's not using it's own drivers also, if you need an upgrade suggestion please list what your possibly needing to upgrade for... but w/o even looking at it, i'd suggest the GeForce 6600 AGP (not the GT)
