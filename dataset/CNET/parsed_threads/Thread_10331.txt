<s> I am thinking about upgrading from my 5-year old 19&quot; LCD monitor to something that would be better for both simple photo editing and also as my primary screen for watching DVD movies (no jokes please!). </s>
<s> Is there any reason why I shouldn't choose a 26&quot; or 32&quot; LCD television instead of a PC monitor? </s>
<s> And would a graphics card do anything for me? </s>
<s> I am not a PC gamer but notice that DVD scenes with motion can look choppy on my current monitor and I am not sure if it is the monitor's fault or the PC's built-in graphics card. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> If your DVD watching is producing noticeable choppiness, then it could be several reasons. </s>
<s> It could be the video card, motherboard, CPU, or OS. </s>
<s> Or even a combination of these. </s>
<s> It might be the monitor if the refresh rate is too slow or the response speed of the monitor is too low. </s>
<s> Changing to a TV for a monitor would only make it worse if the system is at fault. </s>
<s> Inexpensive TVs won't have the color range or accuracy of a good 22&quot; or 24&quot; monitor ($300 - $400). </s>
<s> They'll also have a lower resolution (1366x768 or 1280x720 vs 1680x1050 or 1920x1200). </s>
<s> If you'd also like to watch high def TV, consider this viewsonic with an HD tuner and high resolution: http://www.viewsonic.com/products/lcdtv/NX2232w/ Choppy DVD playback could be due to a slow (by current standards) CPU. </s>
<s> Most new video cards offer decoding assist to help the CPU so they may help you in that respect. </s>
<s> This is really a no brainer a LCD is much better that a moniter. </s>
<s> Video card if your a gamer and like to watch movies on your computer [ I DO ] upgrade it if you can afford it. </s>
<s> RThe newer VC's are so much better you wont believe your eye's how much more detailed your games and movies will be. </s>
<s> One more thing get a good sound card to make the expierance a whole lot better. </s>
<s> I have a sound blaster X-FI high fidality extreme music with creative 5.1 surround sound and love it. </s>
<s> /just a thought\ tregister2 </s>
<s> My newest upgrade - a dell 24in monitor. </s>
<s> powered by an asus x1900xtx video care (512mb) I have an asus p5w dh mobo w/2g ram and a digiwave cable tv card. </s>
<s> tv never looked this good on my tube 32in. </s>
<s> same with dvd's. </s>
<s> if you can afford the 32 lcd - go for it. </s>
<s> you will need a good video card that has HDMI output to get best pic. </s>

<s> I bought this superb 'LG M228WA 22&quot; TFT Monitor with HD TV yesterday from Comet for 229.99. </s>
<s> The idea really was just intended as an upgrade from my 19&quot; Acer Monitor (which was perfectly good anyway), I just felt it would be nice to have a bigger screen, but in all honesty I have just spent the last 11 hours glued to this thing with no squinting problems what-so-ever, I would normally by now be rubbing my eyes after spending that length of time on any computer. </s>
<s> Clearly without any question of doubt in my mind 'it is an absolutely fabulous monitor, it really is an amazing piece of kit, also functioning as an HD Television. </s>
<s> Also very useful it has an enormous array of inputs and outputs, I can and will highly recommend this unit, it's certainly as good as, any dedicated monitor...FIVE STAR Rating to LG. </s>
<s> For both photo editing and DVD watching you want good CONTRAST & color accuracy. </s>
<s> For photos you probably want high resolution--I assume your current monitor if not wide screen is probably 1280x1024, so 720p is like a shortened version of that at 1280x720 (or many TVs are 1366x768). </s>
<s> You can judge for yourself how much resolution you need but also keep in mind the same resolution on a larger screen will be more pixelated (at the same viewing distance). </s>
<s> Personally I would get a 24&quot; widescreen monitor, which is big enough to be good for movies in a small/medium room, and has a resolution of 1920x1200 which is like a slightly taller version of 1080p and is a pretty huge computer resolution. </s>
<s> If you get a TV you may be less comfortable sitting close to it for normal computer use, and unless it's 1080p the resolution might be limiting. </s>
<s> As for your graphics card, it would probably be a good idea to upgrade it but I would have to know more about your system to tell if that's what's causing the choppiness. </s>
