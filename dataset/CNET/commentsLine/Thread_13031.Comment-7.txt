i guess i should have been more specific.
i want an e-reader like a kindle, also i want something i can put my music on and never do it again, like a zune with a hard drive.
so, this will cost me about $500 and i have two devices to carry around.
is there something out there that will do both?
i already have a laptop and a desktop so i don't need to have internet on this new device, i just want to download books and music on this new device and be done with it.
