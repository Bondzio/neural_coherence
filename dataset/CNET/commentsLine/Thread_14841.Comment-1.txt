i was wondering what the risks were of flashing my bios.
i bought a new stick of ram that isn't working and i've narrowed down the problem to an out-of-date bios.
when booting up with the new ram i get the error message: failure initialising configmg: windows protection error.
you must restart your computer.
850mhz duron 256 mb ram (existing) gigabyte ga-7ixe4 windows 98se i'd be glad to hear any ideas.
thanks adam
