<s> I am going to buy a DVD burner this week. </s>
<s> I see that both Sony and Plextor make a DVD+-R drive. </s>

<s> Can you fellows give any advice? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> OfficeMax sold me an all-format DVD writer for 79 bucks. </s>
<s> Let's see what's in the box. </s>
<s> Sorry, have to go get it downstairs... </s>
<s> It's just some Top-G made in China DVD all format recorder with: - Passable install manual. </s>
<s> - IDE cable - Audio cable (generic) - Mounting screws - Roxio's Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 - PowerDVD (a DVD player software) - Roxio's PhotoSuite 5 - one DVD+R/W media For 79 bucks, this seems to be an easy choice. </s>
