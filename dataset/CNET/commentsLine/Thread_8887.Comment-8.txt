is now enabled in both machines.
i tried to print from the dell (which does not have a printer hooked up and kept getting message that said &quot;file to print was deleted&quot;?
is there a way where i can see the other computer...went to my computer and didn't see anything either... maybe i'm looking in all thew wrong places.
although i feel i'm getting some where.
thanks
