in another post (sorry i forget where) someone said that is was not a good idea to use packet writing.
i rely on directcd for backing up critical files to cd.
it has always been quirky and i often have trouble reading the disks on other computers but i have finally gotten it to work smoothly on the two computers that are most important to me (home and work).
am i making a mistake here?
what is the best way to back up to cd?
thanks.
