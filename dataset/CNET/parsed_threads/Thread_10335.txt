<s> I would like to perform a &quot;spring clearing&quot; for my 2 years old DELL Dimension E520 via DELL PC Restore. </s>
<s> I have added a new hardware i.e PCI NVIDIA VGA Card and wonder whether I should uninstall the card before I perform the PC Restore task. </s>
<s> Can anyone advise me here? </s>
<s> Appreciate your help and feedback. </s>
<s> to get it out and use your default connection on the motherboard during the restore. </s>
<s> Then put it in again and install the drivers like you did sometime in the last 2 years. </s>
