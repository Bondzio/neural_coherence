I am going to take and amd athlon socketA out of a bad motherboard and replace it into a new socket A motherboard.
MY question is that there is the gel between the cooling fan and the chip.
I have read that it is to be removed or cleaned off.
A website i visited said to use carborator cleaner to clean it off.
Is this true?
Does anybody know of a good site to help me with this job.
I searched google but after reading about the guy saying to use carborator cleaner i want to be sure to get some known good information.
Thanks.
