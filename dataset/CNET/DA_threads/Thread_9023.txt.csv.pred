1.1.1	Hi , Thanks for any advice about buying a new computer ( just the CPU ) under $ 1,000 that is , first and foremost -- - QUIET .	St
1.1.2	Things I want : - Good DVD viewing - Good You Tube viewing - Internet browsing - Word Processing - Possibly TV tuner Things I dont need : - Gaming - High-end audio-visuals	St
1.2.1	I noticed you said you are only looking for a CPU ?	Ques
1.2.2	I 'm not sure if you actually mean what CPU is an abbreviation for , which would be Central Processing Unit .	St
1.2.3	In case you did , then a great CPU out right now would be the Intel E5200 Dual-Core Processor .	St
1.2.4	You can get it for about $ 75.00 .	St
1.2.5	It clocks in at 2.5Ghz .	St
1.2.6	As far as noise goes , it 's virtually silent .	St
1.3.1	Hi , thanks for making the distinction about the CPU .	Polite
1.3.2	I should have used the term & quot ; console & quot ; or & quot ; just the computer without peripherals. & quot ; I know about some quiet computers , e.g. , Dell & quot ; Hybrid. & quot ; And & quot ; endpcnoise & quot ; makes quiet computers .	St
1.3.3	And thanks for the info about the quiet CPU ( Dual-Core ) .	Polite
1.3.4	I 'll add that to my list of specs .	St
1.4.1	Given the price you certainly can beat the price with almost any of the 599 buck or less machines being able to do what you listed .	St
1.4.2	However if it was my money I 'd skip Vista and wait for Windows 7 .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	You can do all that for a price of around $ 500 *CPU : Athlon X2 BE-2350 , OEM since we 'll use a quieter HSF cheap , cool and can handle all the stuff you listed *HSF : Thermaltake A4017-01 quiet , never used it myself , but I have seen good reviews *Mobo : Anything with 780G northbridge this is why I chose AMD , the 780g has a Radeon HD 3200 which is one of the best IGP 's out there *RAM : 2gigs of DDR2 ( any speed , recommend keeping it under 5-5-5-15 latency ) *Case : Antec Sonata III Case w/500 watt PSU quiet case , used before and it is really good *PSU : the one that came with the case Hard drives , DVD drives ... : choose quiet ones , ca n't really recommend one , there are so many	St
1.6.1	Hi Bob , just briefly : i do n't like laptops , and do like PCs with the separate keyboard , big screen , mouse , etc .	St
1.6.2	Tell me more about Win 7 .	St
1.6.3	In a brief search for reviews , there are a few beta reviews , but nothing really too substantial yet .	St
1.6.4	Do you think it will be ( a ) as good as , or better than , XP ; and/or ( b ) fix all the bugs / better than Vista ?	Ques
1.6.5	Thanks for any info .	St
1.7.1	Thanks for the great list of specs !	St
1.7.2	Good idea to build it myself , but I do n't feel i am up to speed on building a computer , but may take your specs to a shop in the neighborhood to see if they will do it .	St
1.7.3	One of my main concerns is having good tech support , and someone close-by could be good .	St
1.8.1	http : //www.SILENTPCREVIEW.COM http : //www.google.com/search ? q=silentpc & ie=utf-8 & oe=utf-8 & aq=t & rls=org.mozilla : en-US : official & client=firefox-a VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	Sorry , never going to happen .	St
1.9.2	The market dictates you take a product to market when the bugs are below a certain threshold .	St
1.9.3	You wo n't found bug free Windows any time soon .	St
1.9.4	But Vista feels like Microsoft 's Windows ME disaster .	St
1.9.5	And I did the Windows 7 beta and it 's impressive .	St
1.9.6	Even in beta form it seems to beat Vista on key talking points .	St
1.9.7	I 'd wait it out and skip Vista if you can .	St
1.9.8	And about XP .	St
1.9.9	It does n't support USB 2.0 out of the box , drives over 127GB and SATA until service packs and even then SATA can be problematic .	St
1.9.10	It 's age is showing .	St
1.9.11	Bob	St
