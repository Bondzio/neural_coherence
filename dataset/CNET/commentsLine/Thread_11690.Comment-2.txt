you're going to want to know which security method you will be using.
it appears that today's thinking is that wpa2 is desired as the minimum.
some of the bargain/closeout devices seem to offer wpa but not wpa2.
you could also go usb as these are portable.
there are mixed reviews as to whether a fixed card or usb device works best.
i've used both without serious issues.
