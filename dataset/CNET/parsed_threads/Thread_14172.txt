<s> I have an Epson Perfection 1670 Scanner that (appears) to work fine BUT I always get the same Error message when I attempt to scan anything --- cannot find a document on the Scanner. </s>
<s> I wiped all the software off my PC, cleaned the Registry and performed a new install but that did not help. </s>
<s> I then went through the full install procedure on a MAC and there too got the same error message. </s>
<s> Does anyone have an idea as to WHY the scanner wont acknowledge that there IS something on the Scanner and display that image? </s>
<s> tube (light) may either be out of adjustment or it's bad. </s>
<s> Time for the shop. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Many thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Your response was so much better that Epson Tech Support. </s>
