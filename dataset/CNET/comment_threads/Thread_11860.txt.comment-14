I have never owned a laptop, but I am currently looking to buy.
I am confused on the difference between Wi-Fi and Wireless Internet.
If I buy a computer that says it has 802.11g, is that just good for Wi-Fi at a Starbucks or some other &quot;hotspot&quot;, or will 802.11g work for Wireless with a phone provider like Alltel for wireless internet access?
Maybe I should also ask if 802.11g is a card built into a laptop?
