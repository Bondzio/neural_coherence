1.1.1	What r the things to look for when matching speakers and amps ? ?	Ques
1.1.2	?	Ques
1.2.1	Most PC speakers have a dedicated preamp input to control volume and EQ on the subwoofer and they 're almost always unique for different manufacturers .	St
1.2.2	Most of the time these preamps are hard wired , or at least integrated into the enclosures of the speaker system , and ca n't be removed .	St
1.2.3	Assuming that you have a system in mind that has a dedicated preamp ( I know Logitech and Bose have some models with dedicated preamps ) you 'll have to make sure that your speakers connect to your amp .	St
1.2.4	Also , many newer systems use digital inputs on the preamp and may not be compatible with certain amplifiers .	St
1.2.5	Most speakers use standard speaker wire and a 3.5mm mini jack to connect with the amp , but not all .	St
1.2.6	If you 're really serious about using different components instead of a mass produced system , I 'd suggest a self powered subwoofer ( or invest in a component sub and plate amp ) , home theater style receiver , and speakers of your choice .	St
1.2.7	Even car speakers/subwoofers will work assuming you want to build enclosures for them .	St
