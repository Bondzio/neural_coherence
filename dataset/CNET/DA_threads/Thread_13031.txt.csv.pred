1.1.2	So, I'm thinking to get something with a hard drive that I can read books and have all my music on.	St
1.1.3	Any suggestions?	St

1.7.1	I guess I should have been more specific.	St
1.7.2	I want an e-reader like a kindle, also I want something I can put my music on and never do it again, like a Zune with a hard drive.	St
1.7.3	So, this will cost me about $500 and I have two devices to carry around.	St
1.7.4	Is there something out there that will do both?	St
1.7.5	I already have a laptop and a desktop so I don't need to have internet on this new device, I just want to download books and music on this new device and be done with it.	St
1.8.1	There are tablet form laptops but at 3 to 4 times that price.	St
