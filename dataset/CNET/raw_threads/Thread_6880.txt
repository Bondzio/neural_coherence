It is connected to every computer in the house and is constantly being changed. I was just thinking the other day that if this drive goes down, we're pretty much screwed, so I got a backup drive, a seagate goflex desk (works through usb, which is also connected to router). After the initial copy paste of files from one to the other, how can I set these two up so that if you copy files to one, it will also automatically be copied to the other?? Thanks in advance! -I work on both mac and pc

More safer methods are: 1. establish RAID(such as RAID 5) with multiple hard drives in your Network Attached Storage, so one hard drive failure of all hard drives won't destory your data. 2. Scheduly backup your important data to another location. I use Total Backup & Recovery( http://www.farstone.com/software/totalrecovery-pro.php ) to do this job.

Total Recovery Pro( http://www.farstone.com/software/totalrecovery-pro.php ) has a function called Offsite copy can help you avoid disasters of local site. The function uses FTP to upload your backup images to remote FTP site; so you can get back your data from that site. Another way is using Online Backup. Online Backup will backup files/folders to Internet, but it may take you some money by calculating the data size.
