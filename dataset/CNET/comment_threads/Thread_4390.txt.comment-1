About a year ago I bought and tried a variety of wireless interface &quot;devices&quot; for my desktop, including a Netgear WG111 USB adaptor, and lately an inexpensive D-Link PCI card with antenna.
Even with one wall between the desktop and the router, with a total space of about 20 ft., my connection would occasionally cut out and be generally unreliable.
I just moved my desktop within line-of-sight of the router with the Netgear adaptor from about 50ft away and I can only manage 36-48Mbps.
I've also tried different routers with similar results.
What's more frustrating is my laptop with onboard wireless never loses the signal no matter where I am.
So my question is would it be worth it to spend more money on higher quality network hardware?
I've held off because it seems like most of the claims on the boxes of the $100 routers and $75 desktop cards are dubious at best.
Or if I'm going through walls am I out of luck regardless of the product?
thx
