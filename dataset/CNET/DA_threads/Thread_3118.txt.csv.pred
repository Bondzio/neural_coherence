1.1.1	Hi I 'm looking for a way to set up my home networking so that I can set up a DNS service to mask my IP so that I look like I 'm hitting the internet from the US ( I 'm in Canada ) .	St
1.1.2	Basically this service gives me 2 DNS entries that I enter on my router and the service is running .	St
1.1.3	However , for security reasons , I do n't want my & quot ; work/personal & quot ; data flowing through these DNS entries in case they are packet sniffing for passwords , logins etc .	St
1.1.4	Would it be possible to set up 2 different routers ... 1 for all my personal data to flow through and the other for the media streaming ?	Ques
1.1.5	I have 1 router/modem ( Cisco DPC3825 ) and 2 wireless routers ( trendnet tew652 and linksys E3000 ) at my disposal to set this up .	St
1.1.6	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	Let 's start with the DNS .	St
1.2.2	1 .	St
1.2.3	If I tell my PC to use a DNS , that step is done on my PC and that DNS ( server ) and we are done .	St
1.2.4	Case closed .	St
1.2.5	2 .	St
1.2.6	& quot ; a DNS service to mask my IP & quot ; On the other side of your modem-router-wifi box from your other discussion , the IP there is assigned from the ISP and if you hid your public IP then no traffic would make it back to your location .	St
1.2.7	In your other discussion and possibly here you want no other router or maybe the ISP to see the traffic .	St
1.2.8	That is not possible .	St
1.2.9	Hiding the DNS lookups is also not possible .	St
1.2.10	Hiding the public IPs is not possible .	St
1.2.11	And if you use a VPN , then the VPN knows all .	St
1.2.12	It has to !	St
1.2.13	-- & gt ; Let 's define & quot ; they & quot ; as the ISP and government .	St
1.2.14	Sorry , there is no way to hide such traffic .	St
1.2.15	Anyone that claims this is possible is not up to speed yet .	St
1.2.16	3 .	St
1.2.17	& quot ; Would it be possible to set up 2 different routers ... 1 for all my personal data to flow through and the other for the media streaming ? & quot ; That 's an entirely different issue than DNS lookups and hiding IPs .	St
1.2.18	But as some router must be connected to your internet connection , ALL traffic flows through that router so to get this to work you would have to get TWO internet connections and finally you would achieve what you asked about flow .	St
1.2.19	Most folk wo n't because of the cost .	St
1.2.20	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the explanation bob .	St
1.3.2	I 'll assume this is impossible to do with 1 internet connection or that I did n't do a good job explaining what I 'm hoping to achieve and you do n't get what I 'm trying to do .	St
1.4.1	But if you are trying to hide the IP 's , the DNS service wo n't help there .	St
1.4.2	My background includes writing early router code back in the early 90 's so I 'm an old hand at networking .	St
1.4.3	I do n't mind discussing topics and must take folk 's word on this and that .	St
1.4.4	If someone tells me they are using a DNS service then I nod , file that and proceed with what that does .	St
1.4.5	If someone meant they use a Proxy or VPN instead , I ca n't guess that and should n't because VPN , Proxy , DNS are all very different things .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	That 's why most companies have a sales department or a customer relations department in front of the IT/tech department .	St
1.5.2	So that they can take requirements from those who do n't know the lingo ( like me ) and relay it to those who do .	St
1.5.3	I think throughout both of my posts , I did a great job explaining what I was trying to accomplish from a non-technical point of view .	St
1.5.4	If I knew all the terminology , I 'd most likely know how to do this , which means I would n't be on this forum .	St
1.5.5	Thanks again bob for taking the time to respond ...	St
1.5.6	I 'll keep on searching	St
1.6.1	I design electronics and write embedded and more apps .	St
1.6.2	If you lead off by telling me that you are signing up with a DNS service , I have to take that as fact .	St
1.6.3	Then I work with that .	St
1.6.4	If you lead off by & quot ; I want to hide or spoof my location & quot ; then I can guess you want a proxy or VPN service .	St
1.6.5	But BEWARE those services as they really do n't hide your IP .	St
1.6.6	You reveal your IP to that service and in Canada/USA and most other countries it 's required to let the gov/justice departments to listen in on the traffic .	St
1.6.7	This is why you see folk that say you can hide your IP get a little beat up .	St
1.6.8	( or a lot . )	St
1.6.9	-- & gt ; Then you have the Russian Proxy scandal .	St
1.6.10	Here 's the recent article .	St
1.6.11	http : //www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/russian-mastermind-behind-backdoorproxybox As you can imagine , those that want to hide often fall victim to this .	St
1.6.12	Bob	St
1.7.1	Bob makes some good comments .	St
1.7.2	DNS does n't provide any masking services .	St
1.7.3	All DNS does is reconcile IP addresses to domain/host names .	St
1.7.4	If your goal is to secure your home network , then you should physically secure any unused ports , not use wireless , and not connect to the internet .	St
1.7.5	However , if you need to use the internet to link remote sites ( say youer home office to your work office ) , then I would suggest you set up a vpn/tunnel .	Sug
1.7.6	The tunnel connects the two sites that you control .	St
1.7.7	With a vpn you get all of the encryption and authentication that you will probably need , unless you 're James Bond .	St
1.7.8	The literature for the routers will tell you if they have this capability , and you will need one on each end of the link , unless you opt for client software .	St
1.7.9	Anything sniffed off a properly configured vpn tunnel looks like gibberish .	St
1.7.10	But , if you are just looking at the internet itself and not a fixed site on the other end , then you are out of luck with vpn .	St
1.7.11	If you are just looking at any old internet sites , then you can not mask your IP , though your router/modem most likely is translating your local IP anyway .	St
1.7.12	A good and updated antivirus package and properly configured firewall settings on your router can mitigate quite a bit on your LAN , but , once the data goes onto your ISP 's equipment , who knows what will happen .	St
1.7.13	The point is that there is only so much that you can control when you go onto the internet .	St
1.7.14	If you control both ends , then you can tunnel fairly securely over the internet .	St
1.7.15	If you only control your end , then all of the path beyond where your end stops is out of your control .	St
1.7.16	Strong passwords that are changed periodically , updated antivirus software , and appropriate firewall settings are the most overlooked steps each individual can take .	St
