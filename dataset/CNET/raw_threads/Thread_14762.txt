That's all I can offer. I also have some Linksys WAP and another DLink WAP and those units underperformed until the FIRMWARE was updated. In closing, make sure that the WAP and your Client are on the same RF Channel. And I won't know how to do this since there is NO STANDARD as to the user interface. Bob

I have to say setup was very easy, and when I as far away from the access point, I was still getting a good signal. Are you using a Netgear adapter? I know, from what I've read, that sometimes if you use a different manufacturer's adapter, things go wrong. And, as Bob said, there is a firmware upgrade. I really like this router, but too slow for my needs, as I'm always accessing my other computers, so I'm returning it. Otherwise, it was great just surfing the net.
