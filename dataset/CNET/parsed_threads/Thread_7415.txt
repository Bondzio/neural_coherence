<s> http://www.3cbsi.com/solutions/forms/us/dealclose_c/email.html I'm anything but a networking guru but have always liked 3Com products in that arena. </s>
<s> They price above Linksys, Netgear, et. </s>
<s> all but below Cisco. </s>
<s> I still have a box full of old 3Com 3C905 NICs harvested from older PCs that I still use when running into problems with other such devices. </s>
<s> They just always work right from the get go. </s>
<s> Some of the ones I have actually say &quot;Made in USA&quot;, if you can believe that. </s>
<s> Some are made in Ireland. </s>
<s> My home network uses 3Com Office Connect products which all stack neatly together. </s>
<s> These include a router and wireless AP that never lock up...though your mileage may vary. </s>
<s> Interestingly, I have an HP Office Connect print server designed similarly to my 3Com Office connect products and stacks with these as well. </s>
<s> I suspect 3Com made the print server and maybe have partnered with HP in the past for networking products. </s>
<s> 3Com seems to have lost some popularity as home networking has exploded and lower priced networking products have taken over. </s>
<s> HP makes decent printers but I know nothing about their ProCurve networking line...just hope they won't steal 3Com's name and turn out junk. </s>
<s> buy it to enter the consumer space but to compete with Cisco in enterprise. </s>
<s> Should be an interesting contest to watch. </s>
<s> If you can help it (money?) </s>
<s> don't buy consumer grade IT products from any maker. </s>
<s> Buy their commercial/small-business/enterprise stuff and you should be ok. Not fancy or pretty, but functional and durable. </s>
<s> I've no formal training but have worked in electronics, communications and medical devices as a hobby or for pay since I was old enough to rip apart an old tube type radio. </s>
<s> In spare time now, I provide support in a small school. </s>
<s> While I love doing that, I don't love spending too much time there. </s>
<s> My wife is the tech coordinator there and we've insisted that the school let us pick out hardware and vendors. </s>
<s> This means custom built PCs with hardware of our choosing. </s>
<s> I could build these myself but not as inexpensively and don't want to be responsible for warranty repair. </s>
<s> For the school network, I personally was involved in pulling all the cable, wiring the cabinet and selecting switches and such. </s>
<s> All are 3Com including a POE switch for the 3Com access points placed in the school. </s>
<s> I've never had a failure of a 3Com device there and operation has been smooth and trouble free. </s>
<s> That's how I like my volunteer job to go. </s>
<s> We've had our share of good hearted people wanting to donate their old PCs, printers, and such. </s>
<s> Most have been a headache and just something we need to find a nice way to thank them for the donation and discreetly dispose of their junk . </s>
<s> I agree with you. </s>
<s> Start off with good quality stuff. </s>
<s> Your wallet may be lighter but you won't need to spend half your life in these forums trying to get your gear to work. </s>
