I currently have a situation with my 7-year-old Dell XP computer for which, until recently, adding new RDRAM (Rambus) cost about $250 and it was not worth so doing since a new computer was in the near future -- so I do not want to be in that situation again. That said, methinks 4GB of a different RAM should be fine. My thanks for your reply.....miki
