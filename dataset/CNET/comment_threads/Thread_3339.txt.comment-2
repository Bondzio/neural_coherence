I am not one to recommend all in one units unless that is the only way you can go with a puter.
They are just laptops on steroids and if it needs to be serviced after warranty it is going to cost you more.
That is a good price for what your getting but you could very well lose the money your going to save if it has problems after the warranty expires.
Did you read the reviews, they were all one stars.
I would keep looking.
