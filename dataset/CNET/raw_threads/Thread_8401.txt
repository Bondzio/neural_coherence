It is fairly new, about 6 months old. Tonight I started scanning photos for my next video project. The first few were great. Then all of a sudden each photo went onto my computer with red streaks, and when imported into Elements it looked like the scan was reading the whole document table and not just the photo (the photo would be sitting at the top of the scanned image with colored lines streaming down from the photo, as if bleeding; rest of scanned image is while background). I got out my manual and tried all the troubleshooting recommendations. None helped. I doubt it is a defective product because it was just working beautifully! (The only thing I did that was different was place a colored sheet of paper behind multiple photos to scan multiples simultaneously into Photoshop Elements. I abandoned that for unrelated reasons.) If you can offer suggestions or possible websites for me to study, I will be so grateful. (Sorry for length of message).

I updated the driver, and the problem (red streaky lines like a special effect) is still there. I scanned a white sheet of paper and the image did not have red streaky lines, but instead had a very thin blotchy green coloration. My next question, somewhat hopeful: Does this sound like it could be a coloration problem? Or is it looking even more like equipment failure? Your thoughts much appreciated.

Some don't want to hear this and slip into denial mode, but your words are true to what you see when the scanner is on it's last day. The downside is that repair can exceed the price of a new scanner. Bob
3230	4	110063	1256199	1252174	Marie Boyer	6/21/05 7:06 PM	1.11938076E12	Bob, you were right, of course!	My scanner was dead. Best Buy replaced it tonight, no questions asked. Mind if I ask a newbie follow-up question? The new scanner identical to the old with the same software. I had recently updated the drivers on the old one. Can I just plug the new one in and run it on the old software or do I have to uninstall the old software and install the new?
