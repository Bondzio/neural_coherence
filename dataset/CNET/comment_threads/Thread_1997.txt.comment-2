I assume these are true AP and not routers.
This would mean that each device would pass its own mac address up the path.
First I would check the firewall logs to make sure you are not getting anything denied via rule.
Since I assume your wired PC work I doubt this is the problem.
Just a guess but I would suspect a port security setting on the switch.
One of the many option in cisco is to allow only a single mac on a port.
The switch should produce error messages into the log.
You can also do a show mac-address command on the ports you are having issues with.
You should see multiple macs assigned to that port.
