<s> Does anyone know if its possible to install programs on a USB flash drive? </s>
<s> I know there is Portable Firefox and Thunderbird, but I was just wondering if there are any others. </s>
<s> Or if there is anyway to put programs on flash drives through another method, that would be helpful as well. </s>
<s> There are far too many programs out there. </s>
<s> Why not narrow it down to what you need? </s>

<s> Check out the Kingston USB Flash Drive ''Migo Edition''. </s>
<s> Their ads say it comes with ''productivity software'' </s>
<s> Could you use the Kingston Migo say (100 gb) to act like an external hard drive? </s>
<s> Back up software from one pc and open the drive up with another? </s>
<s> The ability to copy off WINDOWS software declined to new lows in 1995 when a new version arrived. </s>
<s> -&gt; Rarely works. </s>
