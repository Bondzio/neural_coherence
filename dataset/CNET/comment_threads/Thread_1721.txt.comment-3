JToks, If youre receiving low signal it can mean a range of things.
It can be your computer, the weather, something new might be blocking the equipment (meaning it has to penetrate an extra layer).
Trying to trouble shoot everything would consume time.
Since you are utilizing a free connection.
I would suggest you purchase a high-powered Wireless to USB adapter.
The cost is minimal and it would fix your problems.
Hope this Help NWC
