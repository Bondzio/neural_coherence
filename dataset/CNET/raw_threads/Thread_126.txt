I am actually trying to extend the signal pretty far (let's say 200yds). I want to reach the garage and I get a signal 3/4 of the way there then nothing. Is this possible? I have been reading up on repeaters and it sounds like I could place a repeater compatible with my netgear wireless router at the edge of my signal and extend it. Is this so? and if it is how far will it actually extend? Someone recommeded Netgear WGXB102 54Mbps Wall-Plugged Wireless Range Extender Kit but will this work for extending the signal outdoors?
