Next, check under the system mgr. and see if any &quot;?&quot; is next to the line item for CD drives. If yes, check to see if any error # is present. If yes again, then look-up by googling for what that error # is and what it means. You can then proceed to fix by googling further for known fixes on such an error #. Otherwise, since you offered no info on CD make, OS, etc., you pretty leave us in the dark. tada -----Willy
