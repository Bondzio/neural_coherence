something got lost in translation.
the what's are connected to what?
let me share that the most common setup is... dsl or cable modem -&gt; router (with wifi option?)
-&gt; pcs wired and wireless.
your post wrote &quot;internet access is thru the pc&quot; which sounds as if you have a very funky setup.
can you tell more or just supply a quick diagram?
