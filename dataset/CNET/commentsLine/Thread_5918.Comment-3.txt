update: i hooked up the s-video cable from the nvidia geforce fx 5200 video card to the s-video on the television.
i am able to view my desktop on the television, but the quality is poor.
what settings do i need to fix?
please advise.
in addition, when i view a dvd on my television, how do i set it up to fill the entire screen, at this point, it only shows the movie in widescreen?
how do find out if i have the most up to date drivers, software, etc., to be sure i receive the best quality?
what is forceware, i keep seeing on the site?
if you need additional information, please let me know.
