Hi, I got a mid range psu originaly, today after i wrote my original post i opened it up and it smelt of burnt electronics.
'Theres my problem' - or so i thought.
I have since been to the store and bought a new psu of a different make (still mid range), i have hooked it up to the mobo, cpu & ram and i still have the same problem.
The ram LED is lighting up on the mobo, so power must be getting through to it.
Is it possible for the mobo to die and kill the original power supply on its way out?
Is there a way for me to test the mobo?
I have also inspected the other components and there is no smell/damage.
Thanks Cat
