Thanks for the quick reply.
I haven't used an AMD processor since I built a 486!.
I've used Intels since then, so I am unaware of &quot;that AMD burnout problem&quot;.
So the heat builds up so fast that it will power down in one second?
Would that explain why the T-Bird powered down after 5 seconds repeatedly, but the Athlon-XP only runs for one second.
More power / heat in the XP?
Do you think there is contact between the aluminum heat sink and the actual chip face when there is no transfer tape?
I see four rubber pads that might keep the two faces apart.
