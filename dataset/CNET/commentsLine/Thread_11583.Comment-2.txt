your best bet is the maker's manual for technical repairs, shecmatics and such.
since, you didn't mention even the product, well alot is not known.
i can only assume the eprom is special or rated for certain usage and pins are cut or made w/o them in order to fulfill its mission.
but, it maybe a generic(you find one, then clip pins) eprom done in this matter only because the oem wants it that way.
