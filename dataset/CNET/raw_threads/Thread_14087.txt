How the hell does Cache play a role in CPU performance. i know there is L1 L2 and L3 (i think) and one is bigger than the other because its faster to search a small amount of memory. but i don't fully understand it. can someone give me either an overview, or if you can be bothered, an in depth explanation of Cache. i tried googling it but all i got was the above. Thanks in Advanced.

That's where I'd go ... and	further to places like http:\\www.Tomshardware.com http:\\www. anandtech.com Bottom line...if the CPU can cache commands or data...then it doesn't have to go off die to slower system RAM, or to disk.

555	4	346803	3065906	3065819	bob b	6/21/09 3:57 PM	1.24559982E12	My view of the world.	The cpu wants data. If that data is in the cache it's only a few feet away. If that data is in the ram it's a 1000 miles away. Think time. Think supply chain. If the cpu goes idle while waiting for data your perf falls out of bed. If your looking for an in-depth analysis on how cpu cache works....magic....black box...data in/data out.

You have a row of filing cabinets right behind your table, this being RAM that stores frequently used programs and some files. No desk, a table instead, where you keep what your working on &quot;now&quot; this is CPU cache storage. (Still a little clunky but closer. RAM and some hard drives also have caches.) Why all this? I CPU can not wait, if it waits, you wait. I hate to wait. Do you hate to wait? Better yet, why wait?
