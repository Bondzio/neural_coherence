if your new card is working, then enjoy it.
if you must have a &quot;clean&quot; device manager, i'd have to visit the machine.
by forum its tough since some will do odd things that i don't know about.
i did write that i don't uninstall the old drivers, but some try anyway and that's where the items will show on i810 based systems.
ati makes instructions that work for 98% or better of the machines out there.
for you, you need better.
hope this helps, bob
