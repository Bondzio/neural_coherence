I am biulding a pc that is mostly going to be for gaming so i wanted to know if the dual core processor is worth the money since they are significantly more expensive. I am choosing between the http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103537 and the http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103562 . Thank you for your help in advance.

Let me say this first as an early indicator to get the argument flowing : no games currently use more than 1 core! It's easy to check too. http://tomshardware.co.uk/cpu/charts.html?modelx=33&model1=237&chart=69&model2=247 Doom 3 1024 Winner = Single by 1.5fps (99 vs 97.5) Doom 3 1280 Winner = Single by 0.7fps (81.5 80.8) FarCry Winner = Single by 7.4fps (176.5 vs 169.1) Quake 3 TA Winner = Single by 8.5fps (227.8 vs 219.3) Unreal 2004 Winner = Single by 5.9fps (142.8 vs 136.9) Wolfenstein Winner = Single by 6fps (170.9 vs 164.9) Soooooo!!!! Single core CPU's are still fastest for tasks (read : games) that only use one core, it's simple really! Add in that the Single costs a massive $204 dollars less, and that would/could buy you a mighty graphics card upgrade (or even faster single core CPU), making it a far more powerful gaming platform. GeeBee.

I went with the ASUS M2N32-SLI Deluxe AM2 motherboard, the AMD 64 X2 4200+ CPU and 2Gb of Corsair DDR2 800 RAM. I put a EVGA 7900 GT CO video card in it and it just screams. If you aren't going to do SLI, you might get a lower-end motherboard. Make sure you get at least a 500W PS if you are going for SLI. Good luck, it is fun putting one together. I took weeks spec'ing out all the parts and only a couple evenings putting it all together. Now I need some good games to &quot;challenge&quot; the hardware.

So they probably weren't running anti-virus software, etc. which alone provides a substantial hit to performance. In the real world, you're going to have that running, especially with online gaming... My point is, sure, in a vacuum, a single may narrowly outperform a dual, but most people don't shut down the (sometimes dozens of) processes that aren't absolutely necessary to run the desired application...

It will do all that you ask it to do. Be sure to get a really good processor fan with it. I don't know how Newegg does it, but Tiger Direct offers the right fan match down below the indicated CPU. Everybody is going to start telling you about the CONROE now. Wait until it comes out. First off, it is not consumer battle tested - second: I researched it for 2 days. It's a glorified Pentium D. Intel is just trying to figure out how they are going to make their processors run cooler. I don't that they will - it's the nature of the beast. My next door neighbor has a 940 D in his system. I have a 640 P4. We set up both systems in my work shop and ran them as hard as we could. There was no diffrence (that we could see) in performance. Actually, my P4 never bogged down once (when we performed heavy multitasking) and his 940 D did - twice!!! We both run 2 Gigs. Also: More money spent does not mean more performance. Do your homework and shop around. You can get what you want and not spend as much as you think.

This is not even close to being a scientific experiment thus your conclusions mean nothing. You don't bother to mention other components besides the ram - what about the motherboard? Graphics? Hard drives? How much stuff is on those hard drives? Were they defragged right before the &quot;tests&quot;? What about the OS? Then there's the fact that not all ram is made equal... not even close. What else is running at the same time? Same system utilities and plug ins? Did you both do sweeps for things that might slow down your systems, like spyware? And &quot;that we could see&quot; ?! Performance is objective, not subjective! You need to be running benchmarks and timing how long it takes to complete certain functions, not looking at the computer screen and saying, &quot;well, doesn't seem any faster...&quot;

Load enough background tasks (firewall / anti-virus / chat programs / e-mail checkers / browser / torrent servers / iChoons %) etc.) and you eventually remove the benchmark from being a fair and unbiased single task. Going the other way we could say : &quot;it's not fair comparing the single core running 3 tasks, unless the dual core runs six!&quot; . Being unfair swings both ways! But for the sake of argument, and if we were to widen the original question to include firewall impact (anti-virus has 0% CPU impact until an attack takes place) and online gaming, it doesn't look much better : http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,662,00.asp Only the 3 worst performing of the 9 tested firewalls could provide a big enough drain (it's not &quot;significant&quot; by any means) to allow a dual core to shunt that load onto the second core, and let it squeek into a marginal win for gaming online. All the other firewalls would still leave it trailing. Comparing the costs it's even more obvious which is the best gaming PC platform : AMD Athlon 64 3000+ Venice = $93 (marginal winner) ASUS EA X1900XT = $370 (atmospheric winner) Total = $463 AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ Manchester = $297 Sapphire X850XT = $164 Total = $461 Prices were found on NewEgg.com Now come on, no one could argue the single core and blazing graphics card would not completely blitz the dual core system in any current game for virtually the same money!

No, I don't think that anyone (rational :)) would argue that, but the OP only asked if it was worth the extra money. Considering that my last two PCs both have dual cores, my answer is undoubtedly ''yes!'' Now, if he/she would have said, I have X dollars, should I get a single with a great GPU or a dual with an average GPU, I would certainly advise to go with the single. ''anti-virus has 0% CPU impact until an attack takes place'' 1) I see a 200+ point drop in my PCMark 05 score without my AV protection snoozed. 2) Dude! That article is from 2002!

If game programming begins supporting the dual cores then you would have to think down the road this may prove to be the wiser investment considering the other cooresponding hardware. Ultimatley it usually proves out the more money you spend now extends the life cycle of the system itself considering future short term upgrade abilitys. The mother board ultimatley is the core of the future abilites. As hardware is in a never ending state of expansion I would put more weight in the upgrade possibilites of what ever system you choose. Just remember as the software (particularly gaming)improves you will be back to the point you are now. The big question is how long from now?

Look for games that have the logos, &quot;Runs best on Intel P4 HT&quot;. Though this means that they may work better on HT or dual-core systems, so this suggests that they are psosibly optimized to a degree, to multicores.
6015	15	188186	2051877	2042564	Themisive	7/7/06 6:38 AM	1.15225428E12	It's all very well	To talk about 64 bit dual core, but as most will point out, a single 64 bit single core will suffice for the time being. As most games are based on 32 bit architecture, they will run happily on the 64 bit single core. There are reasons for the dual core type, but as yet they are not numerous enough to worry about. Save cash and go for the 64 bit single core option (the difference is around the 200 mark!).

The athlong64+x1900xt would be for games rather than desktop work. The other one is more for desktop use, though i don't like the X800 series as it dwells on previous technology rather than the X1900's. (X800 series have version 2.1 shaders than the X1900 that has 3.0, this will be more of a compatibility thing with games in the near future).

I spent about $139 for a 3200+ basic 64 processor whereas the dual core AMD runs around $359 (more than twice the price for a 4200). I can upgrade later to the dual core when the price comes down and the programs need it. I invested the money saved in a sweet video card. The system has never bogged down. Just a thought, research your motherboards to get the most bang for the buck, look for future upgradeability. You'll find that you will spend less money over the long haul on the processor wars but then you can spend the extra money to buy a great video card that can last you for awhile.

Personally, I would not pay extra for a dual-core processor right now, especially since other factors affect performance more, such as how much memory you have and what kind of graphics card you use. I have always used Celerons and Durons and with a decent graphics card, these machines will run games or other applications just as well as the &quot;premium&quot; processors, at a fraction of the cost. You would be better off buying a motherboard that has a good upgrade path (meaning that it supports more advanced processors) but purchasing the &quot;value&quot; processor right now. For example, for Intel-based systems, there are a lot of motherboards that support Celeron D, Pentium 4, and Pentium D, so you could theoretically purchase a cheap Celeron processor right now, and then if/when new software doesn't work well on that processor, THEN you can upgrade to a dual-core CPU.
6015	24	188186	2052964	2051929	GeeBee	7/7/06 12:53 PM	1.15227678E12	That'll teach me	...to get involved! %) The original question was : ''biulding a pc that is mostly going to be for gaming so i wanted to know if the dual core processor is worth the money since they are significantly more expensive. So we have ''gaming'' and ''expense'', as the considerations. Of the two setups I showed, for the same expense, the single core with the bleeding edge graphics card is a huge gaming winner! Inclusions such as 'online gaming' and 'anti-virus load during play' , don't really have any impact (sorry Whyfi, but they don't) but now I've got to contend with ''desktop work'' (multi-processing benchmarks already on the Tomshardware link show dual core CPU's easily win) and ''games in the near future''? Are you kidding me? Let's all adopt an ominous echoing voice now : '' IN THE FUTURE!!! '' When games finally arrive that can use multi core (Unreal 3 / Unreal Tournament 2007 etc.) power, according to AMD's roadmap we may also have CPU's with more than two cores (2007 for those too). So that expensive dual core CPU with no game support now, might effectively be old / cheap / slow technology by the time the multi-core games do appear. GeeBee.

I think the real question here is, &quot;What kind of games are you going to be playing?&quot; A lot of the people who have posted in this thread have tossed around a lot of data, model numbers and comparisons. That's cool to be hardcore (gamers... we are a fanatical bunch!) but it's all relative to what games you're playing, or expect to be playing over the next few years. Since I'd guess a hardcore gamer would (a) know exactly what they want to buy, and (b) not particular care about a budget, just so as long as they got what they wanted, I'm guessing you're a casual gamer who wants a quality rig at a good price. If you're just wanting to play some games like World of Warcraft or Quake 4 and don't want to break the bank, I'd recommend going with a solo core, and invest the savings in plenty of RAM and a great video card, which is really what counts when you're playing games. For RAM, get a minimum of 1GB of quality memory, preferrably with heatsinks. Get more if you can afford it--there's no such thing as &quot;too much RAM&quot;. For a video card, buy the newest thing you can afford and you'll be set. Just make sure it's compatible with your motherboard, and that you have an adequate power supply to push it. Best of luck!

I just switched to a Asus EN7900gt video card and 2 gigs of Corsair ram. My 64bit 3500+ could not handle the faster speed and would cause Fear-Quake4-BF2 to stutter.

If you're an insane multi-tasker (gaming while downloading 4 things in the background while encoding video and burning DVDs), then the second core would come in handy.

I'm taking the Pentium D 805 chip (2.66 Ghz) and overclocking that bad boy to 4.1 (it has been tested to run stable there with a liquid cooler such as thermaltake's Bigwater 745).. I'm currently running a 3.4 with HT... so hopefully this 2.66 Dual core overclocked to 4.1 will smoke it... What are your thoughts on my dilemma? Keep my Intel P4 550 (3.4 Ghz HT) or upgrade to the P D 805 (Dual core 2.66 - but overclocked to 4.1) ??? I'm also upgrading to DDR2-667 PC5300 Memory (2G) from my current crap that I'm running... Do video card coolers make a difference in battlefield 2? I'm running the ATI X800XL... going to add a cooler just to see if it helps.. your thoughts?

Upgrade to the P4-D 805 (Dual core 2.66 - but overclocked to 4.1) Deffinatly , If your a P-4 lover ? *** AMD Sued Intel over that Chip + LOST !

How is that not having any impact? 4.47% in competition is nothing?! Consider that in the 2004 Olympics, Men's 100M finals, Justin Gatlin won with a time of 9.85, the last-place finisher had a time of 10.10, or a performance roughly 2.5% worse. ''The original question was : ''biulding a pc that is mostly going to be for gaming so i wanted to know if the dual core processor is worth the money since they are significantly more expensive. ''So we have ''gaming'' and ''expense'', as the considerations. ''Of the two setups I showed, for the same expense, the single core with the bleeding edge graphics card is a huge gaming winner!'' And I hate to be a stickler, but the poster only asked about the CPU and the expense relative to the CPU, not a CPU/GPU combo. How do you know that the OP didn't already have x dollars budgeted towards a top-of-the-line GPU? You're assuming that the OP is working within a specific budget for the total build, which was neither stated nor implied.

Meanwhile Tomshardware benchmarks showed the average gaming frame rates (I'll round it up for the sake of sanity) of the single core an average of 5fps faster, or 3.333% (one digit more you'll notice!). You suggested that if TomsHardware had run anti-virus during online gaming, your ''significant power drain'' would allow the dual core CPU to win. With an average security load of 4.47%, and TomsHardware benchmarks showing single core gaming ahead by only 3.33%, the dual core system is the winner by an average of 1.14%, or 1.5fps per game if you prefer. I appreciate there are those who would actually consider this to be significant, but that being the case they might also be using better than average security software (I'm just lucky I lose less than 1% to security measures I guess), and the single core would be winning again, but by an even slimmer margain. Looks like we're even there, let's call it a draw then eh? I'll do anything to avoid maths and Olympic analogies! %) There's a saying about stones and glass houses, which is always a problem for sticklers! I can see your point that changing the original question could make it look good or bad for one hardware platform or the other. But (anti-stickler mode : on) you added anti-virus software running during online gaming (neither of those were in the original question, or inferred either!) first , and only then did I counter with an inclusion : the money saved buying the cheaper of the original two CPU choices, could have allowed the OP to put it towards something which would have a far more dynamic impact on gaming. Let's shake hands, and call that another draw shall we? GB.

The problem is that new motherboards sometimes will require a fresh install of your windows disk. When the system boots up, is there a message that says load disk{or system disk}. I had that problem before and reinstalled windows, took care of problem. Just make sure you set the cdrom in bios as your first boot device, hope this helps.
