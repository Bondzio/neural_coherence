<s> I've searched through various posts and other sites for reviews and tips on what tablet to get, but I'm still lost. </s>
<s> I figured by posting here I'd get a better idea of what I need. </s>
<s> Here's pretty much what I'm looking for.... </s>
<s> These are the most important requirements: 1. </s>
<s> I am looking for a tablet with no less than 8.9&quot; screen. </s>
<s> I looked at the google nexus 7 and it seems great, but the screen is too small for what I'm looking to do. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I will be using the tablet for business while on travel, so I'd like it to be able to open office documents - mostly word, excel, and power point. </s>
<s> I don't care if I have to pay to get an app that will do this. </s>
<s> I just need to have the capability. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I'd like decent battery life. </s>
<s> I will be traveling a bit and if I'm taking a flight from coast to coast, I'd like to be able to watch a full length movie without the battery dying. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> It needs to have a reliable wi-fi signal. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> I'd like to watch movies with good video resolution. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> The device doesn't need to have a lot of storage space, but it does need to have the capability to access services like google drive, or some kind of online file storage. </s>
<s> I typically have a lot of smaller files on a USB thumb drive that I carry with me, but I know most tablets don't have the capability to read them. </s>
<s> So, regardless of what tablet I get, I'm prepared to make the switch to using some sort of online file storage service to access my files. </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> The typing and note-taking needs to be smooth. </s>
<s> I currently have a Motorola razr phone and I use evernote and a couple other note taking apps. </s>
<s> The typing is very sluggish and it's pretty annoying. </s>
<s> If I'm going to be using a tablet for typing, I want the response time to be as if I'm typing on a computer. </s>
<s> 8. </s>
<s> The tablet should have the option for an external keyboard - whether it's connected directly or via bluetooth doesn't matter to me. </s>
<s> 9. </s>
<s> I will be browsing the internet with the tablet. </s>
<s> I've heard the ipad doesn't support flash, but I'm not sure how big of a problem that will be for me. </s>
<s> I do watch youtube videos and also show video files for business presentations. </s>
<s> The videos are mostly .avi, .mpeg, .wmv, .mov, etc. </s>
<s> 10. </s>
<s> I'd like to switch my current magazine subscriptions like popular science, forbes, etc so i can view them on the tablet. </s>
<s> The tablet needs to have some way of viewing these. </s>
<s> 11. </s>
<s> I'd like to store and view photos. </s>
<s> - mostly jpg 12. </s>
<s> Processor speed... </s>
<s> Since I will be multitasking, I'd like seamless transition between opening apps, etc. </s>
<s> Somewhat important but not a deal breaker: 1. </s>
<s> It'd be nice if there was a way to hook up a USB thumb drive or an external hard drive to the device. </s>
<s> Whether or not it's a direct connect or maybe a wireless hard drive it doesn't matter to me. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> It'd be nice to multi-task. </s>
<s> I like how you can view several files at once with the Samsung Galaxy devices. </s>
<s> Things that don't matter 1. </s>
<s> The speakers don't have to be great. </s>
<s> If I'm going to listen to music with this device, it'll be with headphones or hooking up some external speakers. </s>
<s> So, the sound quality doesn't need to be fantastic. </s>
<s> In regards to price, I'm willing to pay somewhere between 400-500 dollars. </s>
<s> I keep hearing that the iPad is the best tablet, but I really have no idea if it's the best for what I need. </s>
<s> Since there are countless android tablets, I don't know enough about them either. </s>
<s> Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> That's the only known system that hits all your marks. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> While there are loyal Android users, I don't know any that have also used Apple devices (it seems once an Apple user, always an Apple user). </s>
<s> After looking through your list it seems like an iPad is the way to go. </s>
<s> IMO if you go with something else you're either going to disappointed, or you're not going to be aware of what you're missing. </s>
<s> Make sure you pick up a nice, solid case for your new tablet too. </s>
<s> Cheers, Chase </s>
<s> When that happens then a big item in their list will be covered. </s>
<s> For now the few that demand full Word and Excel compatibility get to look at Windows 7/8/9 Pro tablets. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> Why do you think the iPad is better in this case? </s>
<s> The only apple device I have is an iPod. </s>
<s> My phone runs android and I'm pretty used to the google products. </s>
<s> The only thing I dislike about my android phone is it's inability to keep up with my typing. </s>
<s> I purchased an iPad 3 for my dad this weekend and had a chance to look at it. </s>
<s> It seems pretty simple and easy to figure out, which is nice. </s>
<s> But, I've read that they can't be customized like the android tablets can. </s>
<s> The one thing I like about some of the Asus tablets is the ability to dock with an external keyboard which has USB and memory card expansion. </s>
<s> That's kind of a nice feature. </s>
<s> Does the iPad have that capability? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> But it fails some items on your list. </s>
<s> It could be you were spec happy and didn't really mean what you wrote but I'm left to guess. </s>
<s> As to the customizing of one tablet over the over, the Windows 8 Pro tablet wins that round. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Which particular items on the list doesn't it meet? </s>
<s> I think the windows 8 pro tablet will be outside of my price range. </s>
<s> Also, someone at work has the asus tablet with windows RT and hasn't had a lot of great things to say about it. </s>
<s> The hardware is nice, but they said that windows RT is pretty limited. </s>
<s> So, I'm somewhat skeptical about the windows tablets. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I have the Asus model and almost all documents open. </s>
<s> We have a few that didn't and for that, we're back to a Windows laptop or tablet. </s>
<s> Frankly Windows 8 RT is so restrictive that we can't go near that at the office. </s>
<s> Lighten up Microsoft and maybe we'll look at it again. </s>
<s> Windows 8 RT is nice that you get Office. </s>
<s> These tablets are not cheaper than a laptop so I wonder why you are looking at them. </s>
<s> What's the attraction? </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/Transformer-TF201-B1-GR-10-1-Inch-Tablet-Amethyst/dp/B0067PLM5E lists out the tablet and dock for just under 1,000. </s>
