Did you try going to control panel, system, device manager, click on display adapter, highlite the intel graphics controller click properties uncheck the box that says exists in all profiles?
Try that or highlite the intel graphics controller and click remove.
Try to update your driver from the nVidia web site.
I believe the new driver is 56.04.
If not it will tell you the latest driver.
You might have a conflict problem running both devices.
Good luck hope I was able to help.
