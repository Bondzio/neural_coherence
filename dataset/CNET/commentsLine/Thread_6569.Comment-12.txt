i hope this is my last post for questions... now... how do i configure my laptop?
it will recognise the wireless, i'll type in the right password, and it will try to connect for ages and eventually give me an...... yes... a automatic private address!
is this because dchp is disabled on the wireless?
do i need to manually issue an ip that my router will recognise?
why is it that my psp will connect just fine?
same password and everything, it gets an ip just fine!!!
(why is a $250 sony device better than a $1k hp pc??)
do any of you know of a router that supports wireless, and offers the phone-input for internet?
(something where they are all built-in and i don't even have to worry about cross-patching routers?)
my actiontec (prim router) does support their own wireless cards, but only up to b, not g, so it would be way to slow.
is wifi always this much of a pain?
i mean, i know it's slow, succeptable to interference, and has shortages and deadspots, but honestly all i want is a way to get internet in my room without running a wire through rooms... my room doesn't have a modem port (phone), so i'd have to wire a 100ft ethernet cable... i have a special-needs child, so the cable would not be a great idea for medical reasons...
guys!?
thanks, you all.
i owe you all a beer....
