Hello.
Well I plan to upgrade my standard 17'' monitor to a bigger one and im considering buying a TV for the job.
But here comes the issue, i don't know if it is the best solution out there, i mean, i want to watch TV and use my computer and for the lack of space in my room I think this is the answer but im guessing here.
So if buying a TV is the best option what TV (around $800-#1000) is the one for me?
Ive read many reviews but none get me to a clear answer...
Thanks By the way i have a Radeon 9200 128MGs as Video Card (which supports S-VIDEO output), 512 DDR RAM and a Pentium 4 1.72Ghz, Windows XP PRO
