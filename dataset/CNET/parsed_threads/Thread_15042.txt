<s> The green led of the power and the yellow of the battery flashes continuesly. </s>
<s> I have pulled all the parts out and put every part one by one and nothing helped. </s>
<s> So i pulled the CPU out and placed this after 8 hours again. </s>
<s> I cleaned the cpu-cooler with air. </s>
<s> all the dust went out. </s>
<s> After putting all the parts the notebook starts working again, when i press the power-button. </s>
<s> Only the screen went sometimes black when i moved it open. </s>
<s> So i thought the connector went off or didn't put in well. </s>
<s> I opened it again and opened LCD screen too. </s>
<s> Put all the connectors in. </s>
<s> Now the notebook is not working again. </s>
<s> The led's are flashing. </s>
<s> Oo, i forget to mention this. </s>
<s> My wife has find out how to start the notebook. </s>

<s> Only power button does not help to start it. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what is this with my notebook? </s>
