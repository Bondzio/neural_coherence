I am using an HP photosmart 2610 Printer. When using XP I had the option of printing both sides Manually, I do not have this option with Vista. Has anyone else had this problem?

In word I can print the odd pages then re-insert the sheets and then the even sheets. -&gt; Yes, you have to ask HP if they dropped double sided printing. They have done so many times before. Or there is another reason like Office 97 on Vista. Bob

After many calls to HP I was told they have no plans on fixing the problem. My neighbor bought a new HP computer and printer and it wouldn't print two sided, so it appears that HP has totally dropped double sided printing just as Bob said. Wayne
