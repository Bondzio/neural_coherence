Ok I'm new at this and after debating for a while I want to upgrade my Dell XPS 420 (that's a few years old), I'm looking to put some money into it. Right now everything is stock, Intel Quad Q6600 2.4ghz CPU, 500GB HD, 3GB RAM, 375W PSU w/ dual 12v rails @ 18a each, and a Radeon HD 2400 Pro (32-bit Vista). I found out that I have a Dell OTP406 Mainboard/Motherboard with X38 chipset. I'd like to OC my CPU to about 3.0-3.2ghz, but I think my BIOS is locked, is an over-clock even necessary? So far my plan's are to reformat the HD and install Windows 7 (32-bit or 64-bit) Home Premium, add 1GB stick ram, put in a Corsair TX650 Watt PSU that has a single 12v rail @ 53a and decide on a mid-range GPU (MSI 560TI?). I ultimately want to connect this PC to my 40&quot; 1080p LCD TV via HDMI, will a screen that big cause problems running a proper resolution @ X1080? I'd like to be able to play game's such as Skyrim, BF3, Crisis etc...with possible mods on high-ultra. Will this work? I want to try and keep this Mobo/CPU. Any input/advice is greatly appreciated, this is my first attempt at a PC hardware build/upgrade any help is huge, thank you in advance.
