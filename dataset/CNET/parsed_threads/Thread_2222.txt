<s> As most of us know, Dell cannot recommend third-party options for upgrading any hardware - thus the hardware that comes with it remains... </s>
<s> However, I have heard that you can replace the existing PSU (Power Supply Unit) with a third-party one (such as a Thermaltake, Antec, etc). </s>
<s> However, I have also heard that such PSU's are not compatible with the Dell motherboard. </s>
<s> Which of these are true? </s>
<s> I don't want to ruin my system - thanks. </s>
<s> btw, I have a Dell XPS 410 </s>
<s> They offer some PSUs for Dells. </s>

<s> NOT YOURS!!! </s>
<s> So I'm sharing I can use ATX PSUs with the 24 pin adaptor or in my case the standard 20 pin ATX without issue. </s>
<s> Mind you I've done my homework so I have zero issues here. </s>

<s> So R. Proffitt; just to clarify, you can use a third-patry ATX power supply on your Dell BTX motherboard? </s>
<s> The key is &quot;Dell&quot; because some of their parts are proprietary from what I heard. </s>
<s> Okay, so just to clarify, you have a Dell? </s>
<s> Just another BTX. </s>
<s> BTX is a standard so I know I could use the ATX supplies however you must do the work to see if the dimensions work for your Dell case. </s>
