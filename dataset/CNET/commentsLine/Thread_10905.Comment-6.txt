you need to install a better firewall.
try zonealarm to help find your culprit.
zonealarm when installed has a learning mode.
it tells about every program in your computer that accesses the net.
when a new program tries to access the net, you get a popup window with the name of the program, a link for more info and the action you want to take (allow or block access).
also spybot has advanced tools that show whats run at startup and allows you to turn things off.
it also includes the path of where the program starts from.
anything started from a temp directory is suspect.
happy hunting.
