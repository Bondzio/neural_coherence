Hi , I have a Philips external Hard drive ( usb 2.0 ) using a usb hub ( alimented ) No problems in 4 month .
Yesterday when i shut down my PC it woudn't show in ,,my computer,, anymore.
I hear that ,,beep,, sound every 5-10 seconds and the led on the HD blinks but it doesn't show in ,,my computer,, .
I try it all - restrat , changed cables , changed AC power .
Nothing , i also have a external DVD but that works fine ...
In my device manager it shows the ,,!,, sign after 5-10 sec seems to diseapera then reaper ( in synchronization with the ,,beep,, / led ) I really don't know what to do , it drives me insane ( i have a lot of important stuff there ) .
Any solutions ?
Thanks in advance bye
