<s> I notice the security news that FireWire could be used to bypass your login password because it accesses your RAM. </s>
<s> That got me to thinking: Can you use FireWire to read/write the RAM of the 'puter next to you and could you use this &quot;feature&quot; to turn that RAM into a RAM disk for fast access? </s>
<s> Usually run at elevated privileges. </s>
<s> I'm going to stop short of a dissertation on OS security but note the ONE BIG THING. </s>
<s> If you give me physical access to a machine, I'm in. </s>
<s> As to RAM DISKS, that's something of an non-solution in Unix based OSes. </s>
<s> Please look for a RAM DISK for your OS if you must. </s>

<s> That's true. </s>
<s> For somebody who knows what they are doing, physical access is all it takes. </s>
<s> That's why Consoles keep getting hacked to play backup versions of their games. </s>
<s> Even Unix would benefit from a fast RAM disk used to store frequently used programs, so I don't know why you claim it's not a solution. </s>
<s> If my idea would work, it's a great idea to turn older computers into RAM disks over FireWire to serve your main computer. </s>
<s> Just swap out your 512 RAM and pop in 4x2GB = 8GB RAM disk. </s>
<s> Get two cheap computers and a FireWire RAID card and you'll get around 200MB/s bandwidth from that solution! </s>
<s> A similar idea is the Gigabyte i-RAM, but they don't make those anymore so you have to be creative! </s>
<s> &quot;Even Unix would benefit from a fast RAM disk used to store frequently used programs, so I don't know why you claim it's not a solution&quot; I refuse to go there. </s>
<s> Please dive into the old discussions about this. </s>
<s> By you dismissing this OS's cache system you may be showing you haven't been under the hood. </s>
