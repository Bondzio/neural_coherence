Man thats bad.
Depending on how fast you get money, some of your stuff your upgrading now will become useless!
Save it for a while and build a nice new pc.
Check out the &quot;new computer ~1500$ budget&quot; Thread.
There's some nice desktop specs for a new PC in there for under 1500$.
It's not worth upgrading little by little.
