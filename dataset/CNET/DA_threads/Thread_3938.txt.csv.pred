1.1.1	Alright, I've heard differing answers to this, and I've never upgraded a processor, so I'm in need of an answer.	St
1.1.2	On a Windows PC, do you have to reinstall Windows if you upgrade the processor?	St
1.2.1	A good example is when we go from single core to dual core CPUs.	St
1.2.2	There are articles to check if Windows is set proper for that change but as you can imagine Windows is rather dumbfounded at this change.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Like it has been said it depends on how big of change you is made.	St
1.3.2	Going from a P4 2.8 to a 3.0 probably wouldn't effect it.	St
1.3.3	Going from a P4 to a PD or more could.	St
1.3.4	Windows XP knows what your hardware is and when to big of change happens it doesn't like it.	St
1.3.5	Usually this has more to do with graphics, but the processor could be effective.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I've got a friend who wanted me to do a few updates to his eMachines computer.	St
1.5.2	It currently has a Celeron D processor, and he bought a Pentium D 805.	St
1.5.3	They're both LGA 775, so that's not a worry, and I believe the mobo can handle the upgrade without a BIOS update.	St
1.5.4	However, he doesn't have a copy of Windows XP, and I wasn't sure if he would need to buy one or not just to upgrade his processor.	St
1.5.5	I've already done a few things to the computer, like upgrading the power supply and installing a different graphics card.	St
1.5.6	I was just hoping I could install the processor without reinstalling XP.	St
1.5.7	Here's a question: if I swapped the processors out, and it didn't like the upgrade, couldn't I just put the Celeron back in without any problems?	St
