<s> That seems simple: 1. </s>
<s> You send it from u1 to u3 in stead of to u2 2. </s>
<s> You receive it in u3 3. </s>
<s> You process it in u3 4. </s>
<s> You send it from u3 to u2 What's the problem here? </s>

<s> u1 sending packet to u2 the router R should forward that packet to u3 which is destined to u2 </s>
<s> This it's broke or misconfigured. </s>
<s> Seems simple still. </s>

<s> &quot;The router R should forward that packet to u3 which is destined to u2&quot;, but only if it's a packet from u1! </s>
<s> Otherwise the packet from u3 is sent back to u3 in stead of going to it's destination u2. </s>
<s> So your question is: how to tell that to the router? </s>
<s> That might depend on the specific router. </s>
<s> Did you check the user manual? </s>
<s> Maybe some form of port forwarding is the solution. </s>
