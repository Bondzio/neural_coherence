i think i've done everything i can do here.
i removed the primary cd and connected the cd-rw in it's place.
still no go.
will read some things, but not others.
mostly will not read anything it has written and only reads other cd's occasionally.
fortunately, it's under warranty.
i'll post the final resolution.
thanks for the help.
