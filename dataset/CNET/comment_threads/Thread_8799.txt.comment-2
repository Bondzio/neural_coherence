My own experience has been that PCI is better.
Possibly the card can use more power because it's installed straight into the motherboard -- and cooling issues don't usually arise.
Can have traditional PCI installation annoyances.
Many instances of USB wireless adapters overheating -- and the wireless seems less effective.
Usually foolproof to install.
