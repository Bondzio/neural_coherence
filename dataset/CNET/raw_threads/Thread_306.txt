I just bought a Dual G5 with all of the goodies however, am having trouble getting the Airport to work seamlessly with my LinkSys Wireless G router which runs two other systems in my home. As soon as I log onto the internet, I find that accessing web pages and so forth takes a very long time, almost as if I were connected via a dial up modem. I am able to see another wireless access point in my wireless icon at the top of the screen and when I click on it, IT SCREAMS!! So, this is obviously my neighbors wireless system which I don't wish to use. I am upset however, that mine is so darn slow. It is slow whether or not my other computers are on using the wireless router. Does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks!!

You must have some setting in the wrong place but without seeing it, everyone will be shooting blind. You do not mention if the other two systems are having speed issues. Try setting it up again, this time exactly as it say in the instructions. Or, your could ask your neighbor to explain exactly how he has set his up. P

I'm also using a linksys wireless router. It only runs my home network. My download and general usage speeds are horrendously low on the mac. The pc laptop is much better. Any suggestions? Do I need to get one of those airport express or airport extreme routers and scrap linksys?
