Hello, I realize my question is going to be a bit vague, but I have a computer, windows XP SP3, that has a main HD (C:) and a storage drive (G:).
There's nothing on the storage drive other than misc.
stuff like pictures taken, pdf files, work stuff etc.
(no installed software).
If I were to remove this, can I just as easily reinsert it and have it work as before or do I need to do something special to ensure the G: drive is read again?
