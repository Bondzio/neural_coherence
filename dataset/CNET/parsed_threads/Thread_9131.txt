<s> I have been using the HP 215 for about four years. </s>
<s> It works just fine for me, with one exception. </s>
<s> The batteries go dead very quickly. </s>
<s> They advise not to use rechargeable batteries, but the cost for replacement batteries, after a while becomes prohibitive. </s>
<s> Any suggestions as to a unit with more battery life? </s>
<s> Thanks, Bill </s>
<s> My Kodak dx6490 went about 8 days without charging. </s>
<s> Since it's a rechargeable battery my battery costs are zero. </s>
