it'll be hard to find, but look for a full copy of windows, not oem.
oem licenses can't legally be transfered to another computer, and generally won't move for technical reasons.
they get tied to the specific machine they are first installed on, and that generally happens at the factory.
rarely, but it happens, oem windows can cause a problem when being reinstalled on it's mother machine.
fiddling with criptic license keys.
and you will need to format and rebuild your system.
