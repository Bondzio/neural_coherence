<s> if you just want a good everyday pc for internet use, office software, lite photo/video use, a laptop is a great choice. </s>
<s> dual core laptops are plenty powerful, self-contained, and take up little space. </s>
<s> both gateway and dell have laptops for less than $1000 that should meet your needs. </s>
<s> it appears you might be getting further into the weeds than necessary unless perhaps your intended use is materially different and greater than indicated. </s>
<s> You'd probably be better off going to Dell, Gateway and any other vendor of choice and specing out systems. </s>
<s> Then repost the proposed configurations (specific make and model number) here and ask for suggestions/comments. </s>
<s> Make sure you specify the PCs proposed use as that will help readers make recommendations on components you site. </s>
<s> Consider a system with: 64 bit CPU 19&quot; LCD monitor 1GB RAM Video card with 128MB RAM onboard 7,200 RPM HDD CD-DVD DL Writer Floppy disk drive Any other periperhals needed for specific tasks. </s>
<s> WinXP Pro Operating System Warranty ...to match your need for tech support. </s>
<s> Hope this helps 4X Grandpa </s>
