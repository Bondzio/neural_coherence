Hi, I'm looking for an new graphic car which must run all the new games such as GTA IV, Crysis2, BF3, .... and some upcoming games like GTA V. I asked for a rewiev on some other forums and they all recommend me Sapphire HD 6870 or Sapphire HD 7770. Which one do you recommend for me? MY PC Specs. are: i5 2500K 4GB RAM 1333MHz 1TB 550W
