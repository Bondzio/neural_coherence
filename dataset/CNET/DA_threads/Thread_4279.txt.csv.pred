1.1.1	So , I 'm needing to update my bios for my new cpu ( AMD FX 8350 4.0 Ghz ) to be able to run fully .	St
1.1.2	The problem is , When i go to the website to download an update , I just get a .cap file .	St
1.1.3	I 've tried updating it with that file but EZ Flash says no .	St
1.1.4	So i was on the look out for a .cap to .rom converter , turns out that is what i needed and they gave a list to all of their converters but none was for my model of MOBO ( which is a M5A99X EVO R2.0 ) Please help with this , I 've been at it for at least 4 hours and i have had no luck with any other forums .	St
1.1.5	Thank you in advance .	St
1.2.1	I rarely help with such but if you give a link to your board I 'll look .	St
1.2.2	These sort of updates are treacherous so I rarely write how to do them .	St
1.2.3	I must defer to the maker .	St
1.2.4	I will quote the maker 's instructions but in this case , please supply a link so I can check it out and see if there is more .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks !	St
1.3.2	here is a link to my mobo http : //www.asus.com/Motherboards/M5A99X_EVO_R20/ I really hope i figure this out soon , I 've been searching all day .	St
1.3.3	I updated a motherboard 2 or 3 years ago and there was none of this & quot ; .cap file & quot ; stuff .	St
1.3.4	Also , I 'm running windows 64 bit , that probably does n't make a difference though .	St
1.4.1	Under BIOS Tools I found at that link is a tool that reads : & quot ; Bios Renamer for USB BIOS Flashback 1.Put Bios file and Bios renamer in same folder 2.Execute the Utility 3.Use new Bios file for USB BIOS Flashback. & quot ;	St
1.5.1	Thanks !	St
1.5.2	i think i found it !	St
1.5.3	do i just create a new folder , But the file and the renamer in it , then transfer the folder to my flash drive ?	Ques
1.5.4	Do i take the renamer out of the folder after i execute it ?	Ques
1.5.5	Again , Thank you !	St
1.5.6	i think we 're on to something here !	St
1.5.7	I was confused because on the flash back tutorial they have , they did n't give me a link for my specific motherboard .	St
1.6.1	One more thing , This link right here : ( http : //event.asus.com/2012/mb/USB_BIOS_Flashback_GUIDE/ ) that has tutorial on how to use the flash back , They also link a .Cap to .Rom converter for those specific boards , Why does n't mine have one ?	Ques
1.6.2	Or does it even need one ?	Ques
1.7.1	But I usually leave everything in place until I get the job done .	St
1.7.2	Remember I ca n't help anyone do anything not documented and I hope you are not offended about that .	St
1.7.3	Hope there tool fixed it up and you can move forward .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	After decades of seeing poor documentation I 've grown a little accustomed to the lack of clarity .	St
1.8.2	Right or wrong part of this has to do with how competitive the market is .	St
1.8.3	It 's all about price so for the price ?	Ques
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	If you look in your manual they explain how to use the flash back feature .	St
1.9.2	They tell you what to rename the file to .	St
1.9.3	It looks like .	St
1.9.4	Download the bios file ... ..zipped .	St
1.9.5	Unzip the file .	St
1.9.6	Rename the file .	St
1.9.7	Copy the file to a usb stick ... ..note the restrictions about fat and partitions .	St
1.9.8	Insert the usb stick in the proper port .	St
1.9.9	Push the button .	St
1.10.1	This is probably a stupid question , But where exactly is the flashback button ?	Ques
1.10.2	On a video they have , it shows it 's on a the back plate , but i can not find it .	St
1.10.3	https : //mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/ ? ui=2 & ik=12d3a42412 & view=att & th=13d7a5796e5fdd18 & attid=0.1 & disp=inline & safe=1 & zw & saduie=AG9B_P84eUp1_OLIZOTqDmvpUP_k & sadet=1363557372765 & sads=dk4vCVabzySMoQoVGafJMS0RXj4 & sadssc=1	St
1.11.1	And some folk that build their own do n't install such things .	St
1.12.1	Sorry about that , i usually do use photobucket , But i forgot my acount info and such , Anyway what do you mean ?	Ques
1.12.2	I have the flash back usb port , and there does n't even seem to be a place for the button in the back panel .	St
1.12.3	I 've also tried using EZ flash but no dice .	St
1.12.4	( sigh ) Here 's a working link : http : //i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o750/Eyrl/photo_zpsa7054380.jpg	St
1.13.1	Can you see it at http : //www.asus.com/websites/global/products/vpgO4EUfg3UTZsnh/overview.jpg ?	Ques
1.14.1	ahhh i did n't see that !	St
1.14.2	So it 's inside , i was just going off the other models that supported flashback !	St
1.15.1	At they say , a second pair or eyes and hands can really make little jobs go much smoother .	St
1.15.2	Now get out of my kitchen .	St
1.15.3	Bob	St
1.16.1	So i opened up the case to press down the Flashback button , But the light blinks off and on ( green ) and then turns stable after two or three blinks , Anything i 'm doing wrong ?	Ques
1.16.2	i do n't have the file in a folder on my drive and i do n't have any other files on it .	St
1.16.3	What am i doing wrong ?	Ques
1.17.1	Another thing , I 'm going from revision number 04xx ( ca n't remember the full number at the moment . )	St
1.17.2	to 1503 .	St
1.17.3	Does skipping all the other updates affect anything ?	Ques
1.18.1	That question is one that has been asked many times .	St
1.18.2	While it 's good to ask , be sure we are not repeating what thousands have asked before .	St
1.18.3	So , my answer is - & gt ; Install any version you want .	St
1.18.4	It does not matter .	St
1.18.5	Bob	St
1.19.1	About about the light turning stable after only 2 or 3 flashes ?	Ques
1.19.2	I 've tried everything , Even formatting it again to FAT32 .	St
1.19.3	I 've also tried doing it with a different update , I really wish i could save $ 15 and not have to buy another bios chip , Then have to pay someone to put it in ( because i have no idea how to ) but that is looking like the route i 'm forced to take .	St
1.20.1	But I do n't own this model .	St
1.20.2	My replies are using what I 've learned over the years and decoding too many incomplete pages of information .	St
1.20.3	I 've never had to buy a BIOS chip in 2 decades so that would be a first .	St
1.20.4	About the only thing I can add about USB updates is that we should always have a 1 or 2GB stick laying around for such work .	St
1.20.5	Bob	St
1.21.1	Even if i do n't get this working , Thank you , You have been a huge help .	St
1.21.2	I really do hope i get this working soon .	St
1.21.3	Maybe i 'll contact customer support sometime this week .	Sug
1.21.4	Again , Thank you very much for your time .	St
1.21.5	These forums are such a help in times like these .	St
