you got the situation correct.
i am currently using a linksys wireless routher, a linksys wireless printer server with the upstairs printer, and a epson printer.
the system works great.
i just want to expand my capabilitie to the downstars printer.
i have a epson r300 down.
how would i hook this up?
would i use another linksys print server hooked to the epson r300 as a stand alone print server?
mike thanks
