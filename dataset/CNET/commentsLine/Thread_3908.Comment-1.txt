i just bought a usb 2.0 pci host card to upgrade from 1.1. when i booted up after i plugged it in, my computer locked-up after about 20-30 seconds.
it seems to be at the very end of the boot-up, right after i get the &quot;new hardware found&quot; message.
the card is generic (i think), with an nec chip.
i have windows xp home, which i updated fully through ms website, but problem occurs the same.
problem goes away, with no side effects, when card is removed and re-booted.
i have a p4 2.2 with 512m ram.
lock-up occurs with card plugged in each of my open slots (to cover my bases).
any ideas/suggestions would be much appreciated.
thanks.
