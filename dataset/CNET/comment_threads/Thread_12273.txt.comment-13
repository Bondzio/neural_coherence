It's not to be removed but a jumper block placed over it, the machine powered up, then down then remove the jumper block then power up and set the CMOS settings and hope they hold.
These models were built for a purpose to avoid adding what folk were gripping about back then and had a 10 or so built in life span.
As I noted, the socket was unusual to find because that's added cost so again, not much for me to add here.
Your replies tell me that you must have inherited or found this old gear.
I'm sure there are socket 7 boards for sale out there.
But more current machines are under 99 bucks now so it's rare to see anyone try to save such an old PC.
