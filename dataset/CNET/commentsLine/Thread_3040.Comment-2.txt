but you said bios shows 502mb and windows as 912mb.
is this just a typo or what you see?
if you created 2 partitions, you should see 2 different drive letters.
is that the case?
if you have more than one partition, your bios is still only going to report the hd full size and not that of the partitions windows sees.
perhaps you did create a 912mb partition on the 502gb drive.
