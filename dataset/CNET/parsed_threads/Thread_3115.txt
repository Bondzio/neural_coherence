<s> Hello All, I would like to upgrade my Gateway FX4710 speakers to M-Audio 2.0 AV40's. </s>
<s> In order to appreciate these speakers, do I need to upgrade over the existing integrated sound card? </s>
<s> Can this be done with PCI Express x1? </s>
<s> If so, any sound card recommendations? </s>
<s> Thanks, gymIII </s>
<s> with the integrated sound. </s>
<s> your pc should have 1 pci slot open but if you want to use an x1 slot here are some choices: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010360057+1102631935&Configurator=&Subcategory=57&description=&Ntk=&SpeTabStoreType=&srchInDesc= </s>
<s> Thanks for your fast response ramarc. </s>
<s> I enjoy quality sound reproduction. </s>
<s> However, I'm not familiar with pc sound cards, slot configurations, etc. </s>
