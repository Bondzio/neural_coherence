yes i do have a core 2 duo running on it right now but i've only gotten two helpful replies and both are different answers(yes and no).
can i run the quad core?
i need a for-sure answer and if i cant can i get suggestions on what type of motherboard i should buy?
(psu, cooling and such i can deal with myself)
