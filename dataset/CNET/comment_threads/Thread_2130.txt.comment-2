It's not free so tack 100 to 200 on the list so that leaves us 400 to build a machine to run Crysis.
We know that we'll want a dual core CPU and 2GB RAM so that's a bare minimum.
Now blow the rest of the budget on the video card from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2064.html Please get as much video card as you can as Cysis is going to use it all.
