1.1.1	I use stereo headphones , and almost all HD movies seem to have low volume on my PC at max volume settings.. Actually even not-bluray movies with 2 channels audio are kinda low too but still A LOT better then the 5.1 channel videos , So what exactly is the problem ?	Ques
1.1.2	Do i need a Dolby headphones ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Laboratories dives in and there are more than 5 Dolby technologies but if the audio levels are low then you head to some Mixer app or control panel to set the mix as you wish .	St
