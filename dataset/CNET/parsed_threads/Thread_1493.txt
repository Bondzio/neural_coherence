<s> I HAVE JUST RECENTLY BUILT A PC, EPOX MB,INTEL P4-1.8 G 512 MB PC2100 RAM, . </s>
<s> THE POWER SUPPLY SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE AND NO PROBLEMS BOOTING OR RUNNING. </s>
<s> HOWEVER I HAVE NOTICED THAT EVEN WHEN THE PC I SHUTDOWN THE CASE SEEM WARM WHERE THE POWER SUPPLY IS LOCATED. </s>
<s> I HAVE BUILT SEVERAL OTHER PC BEFORE BUT HAVE NOTICED THE HEAT BUILD UP. </s>
<s> ANY IDEAS </s>
<s> First, check your caps lock. </s>
<s> All capitals is considered screaming. </s>
<s> Any way, you didn't say what power supply you have. </s>
<s> Even now, case makers put an undersized 300w unit in most cases. </s>
<s> Even worse, they are rated at 300w, they usually actually far below that.For a modern machine, 400w is considered as a desirable minimum if you want to avoid heat problems and lock-ups associated with them. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> Let me see if I understand. </s>
<s> You run the machine for some period of time and then you shut it down. </s>
<s> Then you run your hand on the case and find the psu area of the case to be warmer than the rest of the case. </s>
<s> I would think that is normal the psu is putting out some serious heat and it has to go somewhere. </s>
<s> I have not taken the power supply out yet to look at it, I will take a look it is suppose to be a 350 watt power supply, The actual concern is, I can have the computer off all night and in the morning the area where the power supply is is still warm. </s>
<s> thanks for the feed back so far. </s>
<s> The ATX supply can power a LAN card, keyboard, mouse or other circuits to effect a startup on such. </s>
<s> As such, the power supply will produce some heat. </s>
<s> Nothing's really wrong yet. </s>
<s> Tell more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the feed back. </s>
<s> I thought that might be the case, although my 2 other machines do not feel warm. </s>
<s> That takes care of this one Thanks again, out </s>
