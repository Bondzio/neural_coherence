ATI 5870 x2 rampage extreme iii 12g ram intel I7 940 the electricity went out and came back on right away, after that when i turn on my computer, the fans and motherboard is working and lights on. but my monitor shows no signal. many says the power supply maybe broken buz of the power went down and back. is there any other possibilities that the video card nor the CPU r broken ? this is not the first time power went off and back on? but it is the first time the computer fail to restart when this happens?

Just because you've been able to reboot before doesn't always mean you can on a constant basis. Sooner or later losing power will bite you. While the PSU just may fix the boot problem you can try to swap parts into another PC check results. Using the monitor elsewhere and/or video card is far quicker test that replacing PSU, if you can. You may think the mtrbd. working, but you got no boot-up. Further, there are various power voltages from the PSU, so at least you know the 12V is up and running, what about the others. That's when a meter helps. Any unusual beeps during boot? Does your mtrbd. provide any diags. to look for, check manual/docs. tada -----Willy
