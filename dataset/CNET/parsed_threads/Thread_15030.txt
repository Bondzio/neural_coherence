<s> Why does my WD800JD not show as Sata. </s>
<s> Device manager shows only Intel 82801EB ultra ATA storage controllers When I loaded XP and pressed F6 and tried to load Abit Sata Installation Disk V1.33 (didnt get a floppy with the board) Xp wouldnt load it. </s>
<s> I read (at http://forum.abit-usa.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=77346 ) I didnt need to load any drivers because the motherboard uses ICH5 not ICH5-R. </s>
<s> In the bios I have the onChip ide controller enabled and set to auto and the onChip Serial ATA set to enhanced (also tried auto and sata only). </s>
<s> In this configuration the Sata 1 is to serve as IDE-3 master with controller 1 and 2 enabled and the hdd does show as 3. </s>
<s> Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2 (build 2600) 2.80 gigahertz Intel Pentium 4 Board: Abit IS7(Intel i865-ICH5) Bus Clock: 200 megahertz (onboard 2 channels SATA 150 mb/s with raid function via ICH5R south bridge BIOS: Phoenix Technologies, LTD 6.00 PG 11/23/2004 WDC WD800JD [Hard drive] (80.02 GB) -- drive 0- running dma 5 512 Megabytes Installed Memory Intel(R) 82801EB Ultra ATA Storage Controllers </s>
<s> The SATA drives will show as SCSI drives if you have an Intel ICH5-R and you load the Intel RAID drivers by pressing F6 during Windows install. </s>
<s> These drivers are for running RAID Arrays and will not work with the ICH5 because it does not support this feature. </s>
<s> The drives will show as Intel 82801EB ultra ATA and run at DMA 5 which is normal because these are the drivers that Intel/Microsoft supplies with the OS (remember that SATA came out after Windows Xp and most other OS's). </s>
<s> Also most SATA I drives are just PATA (IDE) drives with an SATA interface added to them (basically like adding a PATA to SATA adapter to an IDE hard drive and connecting it to the SATA connector on the MB). </s>
<s> edit: from abit forum </s>
