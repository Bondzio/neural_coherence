Thanks but now I have a new problem.
I am getting a Stop error message.
A blue screen I can't get passed when the computer starts up.
It will not even let me go into the safe mode.
Now I am really.
What would cause this happen?
I never seen a computer with so much problems.
My others are HP's and even though they are not perfect they are next to this.
Help.
