<s> Which is better? </s>
<s> I have spoken with Dell and HP and they say the Intel has a dual core with 3.2 gig and AMD they say only goes up to 2.6. </s>
<s> They also say that AMD is still comparable in speed because the cache is built into the processor. </s>
<s> I am going to have a computer built and I am not sure which processors to go with. </s>
<s> I will be using my computer for gaming mostly. </s>
<s> Compare them. </s>
<s> Google: TomsHardware.com CPU charts Looks like the Athlon 64 X2 4800+ has better gaming scores than the Pentium D 950; however, there is a price difference. </s>
<s> Do you have a price range for the CPU? </s>
<s> Are you looking to compare particular models? </s>
<s> they both seemed to be priced pretty close to each other. </s>
<s> I wanted to know which can handle the most during gaming, and is the fastest. </s>
<s> I think you are referring to total system price and not just the CPU price if you were building it yourself. </s>
<s> Of the two I mentioned earlier, the AMD CPU costs about twice as much as the Intel CPU. </s>
<s> Care to share any details on the systems? </s>
<s> System model name CPU model Video card model Amount of RAM HINT: Nobody can tell you which is the ''fastest'' for gaming until you tell us the specific CPU model name. </s>
<s> AMD and Intel make MANY dual core processors. </s>
<s> HINT HINT: Video card model usually has more to say about how good a gaming machine it will be. </s>
<s> If so then check out the Intel Core Duo Extreme Edition while for AMD look at the Athlon FX. </s>
<s> If though you do have a bit of a budget then that can be ratcheted down to just the Core Duo for Intel and Athlon 64 X2 for AMD that can also be pretty good. </s>
<s> Another factor is to look at the requirements for the games you want to play on it. </s>
<s> What kind of requirements do they have and do you want to do any overclocking on this system? </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
