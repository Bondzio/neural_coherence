I had no problem connecting the printer to my pc (Dell XPS 200,Intel pentium D,3GB RAM,running XP sp2)via a usb connection or wirelessly. I connect through Att 2wire gateway. I have no problem using the internet with my mac but it doesnt detect my printer.I've read of others having problems with connecting a printer wirelessly with a mac but havent been able to get mine figured out. Any help/advice greatly appreciated. Holly

I had the same problem with my Lexmark Wireless. I could connect directly but could not use the scan functions. New drivers sorted the problem but it was still a pain using the printer directly as a print server. Have you got your printer connected to your router?
