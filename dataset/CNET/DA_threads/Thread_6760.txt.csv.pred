1.1.1	The Situation : I need to print to 640 printers on a single network .	St
1.1.2	I need to add these printers to my computer , and then print to them .	St
1.1.3	The printing should be as simultaneous as possible .	St
1.1.4	Doing this by hand would obviously take forever , so I am open to third party apps ( cheap ) , vbscripts ( with instruction please ) , command prompts , or anything else that will work .	St
1.1.5	I 've found programs to facilitate the & quot ; printing & quot ; part , I really am looking for suggestions on the & quot ; adding & quot ; .	St
1.1.6	All of the printers are TCP/IP .	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions are greatly appreciated .	Polite

1.4.1	Intelliscribe might be what you 're looking for .	St
1.4.2	Not exactly cheap , but for a small business it might be worth looking into .	St
1.4.3	http : //download.cnet.com/Intelliscribe/3000-2088_4-10021520.html You could also try doing a search for & quot ; broadcast printing & quot ; for possible hits .	Sug
1.5.1	Intelliscribe is fine for distribution , but its adding the printers to my machine that I 'm hung up on .	St
1.5.2	Thanks though	St
1.6.1	Go with what you have .	St
1.6.2	When faced with such limits and no staff I find the best course of action is to use what you know and have .	St
1.6.3	I do know there are command line methods but these will only confuse most as not only it 's the command line but the setup will be taxing .	St
