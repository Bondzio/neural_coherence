newegg [great outfit].
they state exact replacement only, however, call the 800 number, talk to their customer support, they'll work with you.
they won't do a direct exchange however will give full credit when they get the part back and inspect that they got all of the pieces back.
meanwhile place a new order for what you want.
you'll have to pay then but you will get the refund when they get the part back.
i've done this with newegg a number of times.
