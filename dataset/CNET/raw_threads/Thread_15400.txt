For my work I use illustrator, dreamweaver, photoshop, premiere pro and after effects. The Satellite is fine, but it is slow, it gets stuck and its Intel HD Graphics is not enough for me, and I want a better graphics card. I think the best solution is to buy a decent desktop computer for the video editing and graphic design, and another little and portable laptop for the programming with enough power to work with photoshop and illustrator. Can you recommend on good computers as specified above? Thanks &lt;/div&gt;

Places such as Office Depot or Staples would be good starting points. The new I-5 or I-7 7 Intel or the AMD quad core processor would do the job coupled with enough ram, 8 GB's or more, basic onboard graphics should be good enough, if not most have slots to input a stand alone video cards, should that be needed.

I suppose a high end AMD would also function......think cores. Why the video card? The editing progs will try to shift some of the work to the gpu.

Many of them are 'customizable' and offer optional video cards, bigger faster HDDs, etc., How much RAM do you have in the Toshiba ? VAPCMD
