the integrated graphics use the processor or cpu of your computer, and usually brand systems like hp don't have powerful processors,so you will experience troubles n graphic demanding applications like games, if gpu or the video is not integrated it relive the cpu from managing all graphic information, even from the normal use of whatever is on the screen or monitor, so i will recommend to search for any computer with no integrated graphics, usually this ones have better mother boards to, that handle better the computing processes, and the same 256mb of video, same cpu and same ram, will function a lot better.
