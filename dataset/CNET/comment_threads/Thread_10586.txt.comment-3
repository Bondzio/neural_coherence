Yes, I found I had posted in the wrong place, but could not see how to delete the first one.
I have used other Logitech devices and was satisfied.
Will the camera come with software so that if I bought two I could connect with my daughter, or will we have to use Messenger, ICQ, Yahoo etc.?
If so, which one of those should I use?
