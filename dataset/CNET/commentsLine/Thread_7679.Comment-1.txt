i have a friend that has office buildings and appt buildings all within a 30 mile radius, he offered me to be the exclusive provider for phone and internet in his buildings, is it worth it to undergo this venture.
and is their anything that current isp and voip providers are not doing that would benefit the customers experience or make it even harder for them not to stitch to our service (features etc.)
keep in mind i would have to compete with the tenants current service providers such as at&t, verizon, idt, so i would have to offer very low prices ps.
do you think this product would be the way to go if i where to deploy such a service     thank you, shimi
