1.
When the pump is on, something is expanding in volume a little.
NORMAL for plastics and tubing.

Water is not compressible (let's accept that for a moment) but there is some note from you that it's almost bubble free so any bubble can be compressed.
Are you fretting over this a bit too much?
I mean, does it work?
