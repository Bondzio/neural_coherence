I currently own an ATI All-in-Wonder 9600XT and I recently bought a Magnavox 51&quot; supposed &quot;HD&quot; but it only has YPbPr(RGB) and S-Video connectors.
Anyway, I hooked my PC to it with an S-Video cable but it's pretty blurry.
Video looks terrific but anything else in Windows is terrible.
Is there anything I can do to drastically improve quality?
Is there a software to increase the quality or will my quality increase at all if I connect through YPbPr?
if it will could you give me a link for a cheap yet good VGA &gt; YPbPR converter.
Thanks, Maynard
