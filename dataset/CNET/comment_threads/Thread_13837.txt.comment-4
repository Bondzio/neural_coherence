I think you mean that the new computer has a 250GB Serial ATA (SATA) drive, and your old 160GB drive is Parallel ATA (PATA).
Keep the 160GB drive jumpered as a slave.
Find the cable that the CD/DVD drive is on.
Insert the middle connector of that cable into the back of the 160GB drive.
Insert a power connector into the back of the 160GB drive.
Power on and test....
