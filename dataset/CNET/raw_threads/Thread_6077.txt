When you hit a key the keyboard sends a representative &quot;scan code&quot; to the computer that is interpreted for use by the operating system. If you are not getting what you typed then the scan codes are being sent erroneously. One of two things: 1) your keyboard is too dirty and the only way to clean it is to remove the keys. You might try compressed air or electronic cleaner spray (unplug from computer please). Or,2)your keyboard hsa expired and needs to be replaced. They.re pretty cheap. and life goes on... Jack
