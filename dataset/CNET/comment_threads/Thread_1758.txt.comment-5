If you plan to &quot;re-use anything&quot; then you keep it because for the most part if it isn't a P4 and above, toss it.
I recycle all the time and truly strip it down.
I cut wire for copper, teardown HDs for aluminium and metals and I keep the magnets, all other drives get tossed for iron metal.
Large plastic is trash canned.
PSU are stripped for metals and copper wire, etc.. Now, if you want museum pieces that's what you have.
HDs that old just aren't woth keeping unless *you* have a need for them.
