1.1.2	I have done a reasonable amount of research , though I am somewhat of a noob The computer is to be used primarily for gaming , but also for graphic design & video production .	St
1.1.3	I 'm not really interested in overclocking anything .	St
1.1.4	I am in Australia and I 'm planning to order all parts from Australia .	St
1.1.5	My preferred website to order from is PCCaseGear .	St
1.1.6	Sadly , parts are not cheap over here , and shipping from overseas is expensive .	St
1.1.7	I 'm not interested in overclocking .	St
1.1.8	My budget is approx .	St
1.1.9	$ 5000 USD ( $ 5500 Aussie dollars ) .	St
1.1.10	Case - CoolerMaster CM Storm Sniper Black Edition I 'm open to any suggestions here .	St
1.1.11	I just want a case that offers excellent airflow and cooling .	St
1.1.12	CPU - Intel i7 980X I 'm fixed on getting this .	St
1.1.13	GPU - 2 x EVGA nVidia GeForce GTX 480 ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.14	OK , this is something I need advice on .	St
1.1.15	I absolutely want to run 3 x 24 & quot ; monitors , and be able to spread both games , and my windows desktop over the three monitors .	St
1.1.16	So I need 2 GPUs .	St
1.1.17	I want to be able to run each monitor at 1900x1200 , with current games on max settings ( do n't care if I 'm out of date in 6 months from now ) .	St
1.1.18	Is two 480s overkill ?	Ques
1.1.19	I 'm a bit skeptical about brand new GPUs .	St
1.1.20	Perhaps two slightly older ATIs is a better idea ?	Ques
1.1.21	I want to avoid over-heating , but I do n't want to resort to water cooling .	St
1.1.22	I 'm not interested in 3D .	St
1.1.23	Memory - G.Skill 8GB ( 2x4GB ) DDR3 Dual channel vs triple channel ?	Ques
1.1.24	I do n't understand the difference , but I want at least 8GB .	St
1.1.25	If I go triple channel , I will have to go up to 12GB wo n't I ?	Ques
1.1.26	As far as I can tell , you ca n't get 3GB sticks .	St
1.1.27	If I buy a motherboard that supports triple channel is it bad to only use dual channel on it ?	Ques
1.1.28	I did some research and the general consensus seems to be that G.Skill or Corsair are the way to go .	St
1.1.29	Motherboard - ASUS Rampage III Extreme ( Intel X58 ) It 's brand new , supports the i7 980X , both ATI Crossfire or nVidia SLI , and up to 24GB RAM .	St
1.1.30	Seems like a solid choice ?	Ques
1.1.31	Power Supply - CoolerMaster Silent Pro M1000 1000W - Would this handle two GTX480s along with everything else in the computer ?	Ques
1.1.32	From what I 've read elsewhere 1000W should be sufficient .	St
1.1.33	Hard Drive - Seagate Barracuda 1.5TB ST31500341AS Seagate or Western Digital ?	Ques
1.1.34	I 've scanned a few forums and most posts seemed to indicate that Seagate are now slightly better ?	Ques
1.1.35	Monitors - 2 x BenQ 24 & quot ; E2420HD ( +my old Dell 24 & quot ; ) I 'm not fussed about getting the latest greatest monitor , I 'd rather save money .	St
1.1.36	As long as it 's 24 & quot ; and it works .	St
1.1.37	It 's not a problem mixing 2 different brands is it ?	Ques
1.1.38	The Dell will sit in the middle to make the setup symmetrical .	St
1.1.39	And the rest Logitech Cordless Keyboard Microsoft SideWinder X8 Mouse ASUS Optical Drive ( all optical drives are pretty much the same no ? )	Ques
1.1.40	Windows 7 Premium So what 's your opinion guys ?	Ques
1.1.41	Is anything here overkill , or are there any bad bottlenecks ?	Ques
1.1.42	Any brands that I 've mentioned that should be avoided ?	Ques
1.1.43	All suggestions are welcome Thanks for taking the time to read this !	Polite
1.1.44	Cheers guys , Dave .	St
1.2.1	hd 5970 handles most any game well in multi-monitor setup with ati eyefinity .	St
1.2.2	this hardocp article tests two crossfired hd 5870s ( hd 5970 is basically two hd 5870s in one package ) with 3 monitors .	St
1.2.3	also , the x58 chipset is optimized for triple channel memory so for best performance you 'll need 3 memory dimms ( 3x2gb or 3x4gb ) .	St
1.2.4	this hothardware roundup of 1tb and 2tb drives has the wd caviar black and seagate barracuda xt trading blows for best drive .	St
1.2.5	if you get a seagate , make sure it 's an new xt model since older 7200.xx models had firmware issues that made them generally slower than other wd and hitachi drives .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.3.2	What do you think about 2 x 5870s with eyefinity ?	Ques
1.3.3	Surely this card is new enough such that having two of them will allow me maximum gaming performance with current games ?	Ques
1.3.4	It will save me a lot of money .	St
1.3.5	Thanks for the hard drive info too .	St
1.4.1	that has just been released by EVGA http : //www.evga.com/articles/00537/ might be a bit 'overkill ' - will run with either dual X58 or dual XEON CPU 's ( and up to 48GB of RAM ) .	St
1.5.1	hd 5970 is two hd 5870 in a single package .	St
1.6.1	Heat is more distributed , each chip get full x16 on the slots , rather than x8 when on 5970 .	St
1.6.2	Make sense ?	Ques
1.6.3	I 'm willing to spend the extra money .	St
