The pink sticker (this was a built computer, so the various parts have pink stickers labeling them) says it's PC266 32x64 256MB DDR RAM. I was wondering... could I possibly use this in conjunction with my PC3200 512MB DDR RAM? I checked out the slot with the 256 stick, and it'd fit in there if I put it in, but I don't know if it's compatible with the motherboard, or maybe with the other RAM. Two other things about the 512 stick - it's Kingston, and it's 184 pin (the 256 probably is 184, too, because it fits). My new motherboard is an ASUS K8N motherboard, AMD processor, etc. More info needed, please ask. Thanks, -Christopher

Just my two cents, but I'd ditch the 266 in favor of the 512 mb of pc 3200. 512 mb is enough memory for almost any operation in xp. You'll get better overall performance. If your a gamer, you can add more ram later.

I know that 512's enough, I was just wondering if it was worth it to use the extra stick of RAM, but I kind of figured that the overall performance would be better without the slower stick, as Stan said, though I knew there'd be no harm in asking. Thanks again, good day to you all. -Christopher
