hello, i always use acronis true image [  to create an exact image of my internal hdd, this backup i keep on my external hdd, in case of crash or other damage, i'll be able to easily restore all my data, apps and even os, as it were on my internal hdd.
also i create a bootable cd, wich allows to boot and restore my backup, even if it's unable to boot windows.
highly recommend, as convenient and tried solution.
