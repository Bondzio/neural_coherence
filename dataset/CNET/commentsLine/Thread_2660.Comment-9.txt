those are great sites with a lot of info.
there is actually a program there made just for msi motherboard monitoring.
only problem it won't work on oem motherboards ie hp,dell, gateway etc.
i took the side off of the computer, started it back up and let it run while doing a few things and the heatsink around the fan on the video card is just bareley warm so i guess i won't worry about the video card being too hot.
i loaded mother board monitor on my 2nd computer and it works great.
thanks again.
