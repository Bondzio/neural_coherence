i opened my box as you suggested, and then decided that increasing the virtual memory at the same time would not tell me whether it's a heat problem.
but not before i opened photoshop and did some work (i forgot i'd changed it).
when i put the memory down to what it's been at, photoshop hung.
no crashes, but i could barely get out of ps.
so then the question is, for a memory-intensive program like photoshop (or running several different things like computer protection, skype, firefox, etc., is 2000 mb too little?
could that be the problem?
