The signal stregnth is poor, about 35% usually, and the computer will stutter from time to time, but its the entire computer. The mouse will stop moving and nothing can be done for about 2 seconds. If you're playing music for instance the music will play like a broken record, and whatever you're typing will not be seen on screen, just what you type after the stutter is done. Any thoughts solutions? any help would be appreciated. I have windows XP pro. 1.6hz 256 ram.

Do the three finger click, ctrl-alt-del and see what's running. Look at the Applications and the Processes tab. Applications are what are running that you specifically start like IE or email. Processes are started at boot up. If you find something that looks suspicious, go to Start, Run, and type msconfig and look at the Startup tab. Start unchecking unfamiliar items and reboot.

I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image. - - Stephen W. Hawking
