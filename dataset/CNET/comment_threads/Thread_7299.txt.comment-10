The access point is separate unit from the router... both have DHCP functionality.. that is why I disabled the one in Access point.
Cable Modem -&gt; Router --&gt; (AP + Laptop + Desktop) The Router is configured as 'default' .. 192.168.1.1 and dhcp enabled.
The point is that Network is working fine with that setup .. and the new laptop is in default configuration ...
I'm going to a friend house (different network layout) and try to see what happened there... back in about 6 hours .. till then ..
Thank You
