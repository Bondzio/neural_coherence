<s> I have this old MB and I'm not sure if it is working. </s>
<s> I am wondering - if I remove everything that is attached to it (HDD, RAM, CPU) but the Power supply and I turn it on, what will happen? </s>
<s> Is it going to turn on in some way? </s>
<s> Will it show something on the display? </s>
<s> Is it going to be enough to see if it is working or not? </s>
<s> But for years we used a board with no CPU or anything as a quick way to power up a PSU and provide a small load. </s>
<s> The board we used was dead so it served a purpose (basic PSU function test.) </s>
<s> If you add a CPU+HeatSink and speaker then that gets us up to the BEEP test. </s>
<s> There will be NO DISPLAY without this plus RAM and video card. </s>
<s> I'll stop here. </s>

<s> Having the mtrbd. </s>
<s> connected to PSU will provide a load and basically that's it. </s>
<s> Depending on the mtrbd. </s>
<s> with speaker attached, it can beep away in protest or not. </s>
<s> If cpu attached with speaker it should beep to some error code. </s>
<s> You're not really testing the mtrbd. </s>
<s> in any meaningful way, so I leave it at that. </s>
<s> Oh yeah, if you have access to those &quot;diagnostic slot card&quot;, I find those of no use, especially if the mtrbd. </s>
<s> itself is at fault. </s>
<s> As for display, you still need to attach or activate the video port. </s>
<s> A bad mtrbd. </s>
<s> can cause no display as it drags the video port down but again it could be the video itself, so having a problem requires some effort to resolve. </s>
<s> It boils down to the time and effort to fix a mtrbd., you can buy another one, so how much is your time worth? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> http://www.directron.com/mot.html locate the mtrbd. </s>
<s> button -----Willy </s>
<s> Thank you guys. </s>
<s> That was quite useful piece of information. </s>
<s> I have the time to try different things, because I will do it at work. </s>
<s> And even if that was not the case, I don't get that much of a salary. </s>
<s> 2 days to make it work will cost me less than a new MB . </s>
<s> I'm 100% sure that the beeping and the CPU work fine so I'll try the beeping test . </s>
<s> Ok, there are many beep codes so I will give you the most common. </s>
<s> The beep codes come in groups of three, so 1-1-4 would be 1 long beep, 1 long beep and 4 short beeps. </s>
<s> So:- 1 Short beep from loudspeaker System board passed ok ( Display adapter, memory etc connected. </s>
<s> Usual from a fully operational system ) No Beeps Dead system, check power supply, CPU,clock oscillator. </s>
<s> CPU fan turns, very litte else happening, check CPU. </s>
<s> Keyboard lights flickered: If the keyboard lights flicker then go out but the computer does not boot, check cpu ic. </s>
<s> If they always flicker, turn off then wait 30 seconds, then on again. </s>
<s> There may have been a power-onsequence error or glitch at turn on. </s>
<s> 1-1-3 cmos ram error One continuous beep Check ram slots for ram inserted wrong or no ram ( known to happen when building boards) Sometimes error message on screen 1-2-2 Display error, bad display adaptor, adaptor needs re-seating. </s>
<s> Turn off before any adjustments. </s>
<s> Requirements: Power supply, display adapter (if not onboard) monitor, cd-rom just connected to power lead (as load ) and power on switch to activate psu. </s>
<s> As have said, these are the most common codes that I use, there are many more. </s>
<s> Hope this snippet helps someone out there. </s>
<s> Terry from Dover, Kent. </s>
<s> You said you had an old MB but it still has HDD, RAM and CPU attached to it? </s>
<s> Or do you mean an Old PC. </s>
<s> I say you just power it all up with all the peripherals without dismantling them. </s>
<s> That's better </s>
