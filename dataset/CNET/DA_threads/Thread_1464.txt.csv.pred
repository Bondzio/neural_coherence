1.1.1	Hello all , Yeterday I bought a Thoshiba StorE art 3 1TB external hard drive .	St
1.1.2	It had some drivers inside ( 200MB ) and when I checked the available space , it was showning 931GB .	St
1.1.3	I checked with the vendor and he said & quot ; the acutul and the available capacities are always different and moreover it is having some space reserved for backup & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	I do not have the access to the 1024-931=93GBs and the moment and I feel confused .	St
1.1.5	I can see two partitions /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb1 but only one is accessible to me .	St
1.1.6	Also I am using Fedora 13 and the speed I am getting is 1MB/s which is very low .	St
1.1.7	Pls advice ... .	St
1.1.8	Thanks in advance|adarsh	St
1.2.1	Seems OK .	St
1.2.2	There are 2 definitions of GB .	St
1.2.3	They differ by 7 % .	St
1.2.4	When selling a disk generally the one giving the largest number is used .	St
1.2.5	In the OS usually the other .	St
1.2.6	Nothing wrong with that .	St
1.2.7	Do n't know why it 's so slow ( unless it 's connected to a USB 1 port ) .	St
1.2.8	Kees	St
1.3.1	Hi ... Can you please clarify in & quot ; There are 2 definitions of GB & quot ; ?	Ques
1.3.2	Also , is Thoshiba the one holding the most space than other manufacturers ?	Ques
1.3.3	If yes who is the most efficient ?	Ques
1.3.4	Is 7 % a standard rate ?	Ques
1.4.1	We have decimal bytes and binary bytes .	St
1.4.2	A megaton is ONE MILLION TONS .	St
1.4.3	A computer MegaByte is 1048576 .	St
1.4.4	We 're nearly 5 per cent off already .	St
1.4.5	IMAGINE if you converted 1 Billion bytes to TeraBytes ?	Ques
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	HD makers rate capacity based on one K-byte equals 1000 bytes .	St
1.5.2	An OS ... .such as Windows ... rates capacity based on one K-byte equals 1024 bytes .	St
1.5.3	If you think about that for a moment ... ..and then get out paper and pencil and expand it to one T-byte ... ..a whole bunch of space is going to vanish .	St
1.6.1	Already tried and sobbed about the ~90 GBs .	St
1.6.2	If it is a case of 1000mB to 1GB , then it around 7 % .	St
1.6.3	You are right .	Res
1.6.4	But still searching for a way to make it faster .	St
1.6.5	On windows I get 55KB/s .	St
1.6.6	In linux it literally slept..	St
1.6.7	But will find a way for sure	St
1.7.1	For example the host PC make , model , where connected .	St
1.7.2	So here it is , some front USB ports fall back to USB 1.0 speed and while it is well discussed why , after years I found one person to fix it .	St
1.7.3	This means my advice is to use the rear ports .	St
1.7.4	But without make and model , how can I give that advice ?	Ques
1.7.5	About Fedora .	St
1.7.6	Nice but I 'd try Ubuntu next .	St
1.7.7	I find its hardware support to be a little better .	St
1.7.8	Bob	St
1.8.1	It is a vaio VPCEB12EN .	St
1.8.2	It does not have USB ports on the back , but three on the right side and one usb/eSATA port on left , whcih can also used as a USB port ( I did not try on that one ) .	St
1.8.3	And also with windows I can see the transfer rate upto 57MB/s with the ports on the right .	St
1.8.4	Yes I agree with that .	Res
1.8.5	Ubuntu has better support and also easy too , than Fedora .	St
1.8.6	But I love fedora !	St
1.8.7	! .	St
1.9.1	site : forums.fedoraforum.org Fedora sony slow usb on google finds folk talking about that .	St
1.9.2	Sorry but I do n't write on work on Fedora ( just some embedded Linux ) so let 's let Fedora folk address that OS .	St
1.9.3	http : //forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php ? t=261015 seems to echo your post here .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	Yes .	St
1.10.2	That is my post only .	St
1.10.3	Posted it yesterday .	St
1.10.4	I am afraid it is not a problem with sony , because I am getting reasonably good speed while on windows .	St
1.10.5	Seems like some driver issue in fedora .	St
