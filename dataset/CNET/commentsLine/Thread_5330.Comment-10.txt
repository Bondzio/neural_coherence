hello again thank you for replying and trying to help me.
i have only once, ever, seen a ups here which had a serial sort of port to be hooked up with a computer, and that ups did cost more than my computer.
the only connectors that mine (both!)
have are four electricity outlets, of which two are three-prong and two are two-prong, all four are backed up by the battery and have a surge protection.
further there are phone - line in and line out, which provides a surge protection as well.
and that's it.
no other means of connecting it to the computer, and no setup program whatsoever.
when i go to the power options as suggested, it will ask for the serial port in use - narda, don't have that.
this ups is supposed to simply switch to battery power in the moment the ac goes, and it does that - for every device except the bloody computer.
i think i am ready to give up on the whole issue and just thread is at a surge protection - better than nothing since once i had a psu go up in smoke when they operated major welding machines at a neighbouring construction site, which luckily has become a finished apartment building meantime.
with kind regards...... your thanh
