Looking at reviews from CNet both Belkin Pre N and the Netgear RangMax WPN824 both have excellent ratings. My computers have regular g cards in them, and my laptop (Dell Inspiron 700m) has a built in Intel Pro 2200 b/g card in it. It is the main focus for connection since its what i use most. The reason i want to go with such great range routers is that on some days of the week i need connection in an area that is 150-200 feet away. Any help or advice would be appreciated! Thanks, Chandan

I use the Belkin preN and have had no problems with it other than interferrence with like-frequency wireless phones. That was an easy problem to take care of. Range with the Belkin preN is very good and yes, it does support older/non-preN cards, however if you want to maximize your range and speed, then use preN cards with the router. Ben

The CSR suggested Linksys and I bought one. They are pricey, but the support is good in my experience. I got the WRT 54GS. and added a couple of antennae from freeantenns.com .
