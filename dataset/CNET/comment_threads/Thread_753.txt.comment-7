If the drive won't spin, then it is beyond any amateur efforts.
There are professional data recovery services that can retrieve any data that is not totally lost, sometimes they can even recover &quot;written over&quot; data!
Unfortunately, data recover services are costly, and there is no guarantee that all files will be recovered.
Your friend is going to have to decide if those files are worth the cost of professional retrieval.
As others have noted, this as a good hard lesson in the need to back up files.
A tape backup or a 2nd hard drive with automatic backup software is a heck of a lot cheaper than professional data recovery.
