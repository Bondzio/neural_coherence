o yes, generally a wired connection works by just plugging in.
if that doesn't work it's most likely a driver problem.
given what you did, that could be motherboard drivers.
didn't there come something like a &quot;driver and utilities cd&quot; with the laptop?
i'm afraid your on your own with regard to selecting the right drivers from the manufacturers site.
i once managed it for a lenovo t30 rather satisfactorily, because everything seems to work except the 'help'-key.
