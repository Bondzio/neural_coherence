worked with another on a school network without problems but that network was not complex.
i don't know how yours was set up but we used static addressing rather dhcp.
the print server needs a fixed address and that address must also be configured on the tcp/ip port that was created on each pc.
i presume this was done.
however, we later had a similar problem with another network printer that installed and configured ok but wouldn't print.
it turned out to be a tcp/ip address conflict and xp didn't warn us about it.
i wonder if you are using dhcp and the print server's address isn't in a reserved range.
