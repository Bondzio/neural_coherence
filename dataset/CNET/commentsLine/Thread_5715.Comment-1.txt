my computer one day decided not to boot.
it hangs right after the bad quality bitmap &quot;loading windows 2000&quot; screen and instead of jumping to a login prompt just sits at a blank screen.
to make a long story short, i ran three versions of the manufacturers utility and none of them found bad sectors on the drive.
so when i dropped the drive into a working windows 2000 box and tried to chkdsk it says the following... c:\documents and settings\administrator&gt;chkdsk h: the type of the file system is ntfs.
unable to determine volume version and state.
chkdsk aborted.
what can i do to fix this?
i've searched high and low and well i haven't been able to find much of anything.
