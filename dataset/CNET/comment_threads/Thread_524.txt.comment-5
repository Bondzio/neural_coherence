I have yet to get a 100% or reliable recovery rate with any s/w.
No amount of playing gets it all done, though some files may have been recovered it seems its never the one critial one the user needs.
Below is a google webpage: http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1_____enUS373US374&aq=f&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=data+recovery+s/w http://www.pctools.com/file-recover/download/?ref=google_fr&gclid=CM2aw9y-w6QCFSExiQod8Ai2kQ Robert, usually has a small listing he always posts, but I have no direct CNET link to it.
I suggest you search here on forum for it, as data recovery is a hot topic too often associated with ext.
HDs.
The lesson here is also store data on CD/DVD discs as well for critial data as yet another storage source.
