I was cleaning up the older hard drive, and deleted some old files. All of a sudden a window pops up and says &quot;Windows Explore has stopped working&quot;. It then tells me that windows explorer is restarting. Every time I try to get in that external hard drive I keep getting the same thing. I wound up restoring the deleted files and it seemed to work again, I moved some files over to my other external hard drive only no for it to happen to both of them. Funny thing is that my computer still see and read those hard drives. My windows media player still plays the music on them. I at one time disconnected all my usb devices and just plugged in 1 of the hard drives and it worked for a bit. I figured that i needed a powered USB hub. I plugged that in and I got then got the same thing happen again any 1 have any idea how I can fix this or what is going on????
