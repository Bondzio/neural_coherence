here is what everst home tells me about the mb: id 04/27/2007-mcp61m-am-6a61ke11c-00 cpuz tells me: acer em61sm/em61pm chipset nvidia mcp61 rev.
a1 southbridge nvidia mcp61 sensor ite 8726 any of that information help?
now i can see where the processor voltage is 1.8v and i am guessing logic would say that the memory voltage should/is probably 1.8v as well...?
i only plan on putting 3gb of memory in each system though i do have xp 64bit available.
i don't use an actual dual boot but rather two seperate hdd's and just use the bios set up to turn one on one off and switch back and forth between xp and vista.
next time i need to do a clean reinstall on the xp hdd maybe i will put the xp 64 bit but no real plans on needing 4gb of memory.
thanks for your help.
