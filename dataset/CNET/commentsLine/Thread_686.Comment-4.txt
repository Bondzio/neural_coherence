&quot;the dos version is required if installing a hard drive in a new system without existing operating system support.&quot; we can use that since you might have vista 64 bit (do you?)
you may have to change a bios setting to enable booting from cd or even emulate ide over sata but this is their test tool.
shows this version.
there is also some confusion where a person does not try the windows version on vista 32 bit.
i found that to work fine.
