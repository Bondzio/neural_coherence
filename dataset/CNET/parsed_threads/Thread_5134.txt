<s> I have been trying to connect to the internet and to the other computers that are both on the LAN. </s>
<s> I get the following messages on the two frequently used computers on the LAN: Status: Limited or no connectivity You might not be able to access the Internet or some network resources. </s>
<s> This problem occurred because the network did not assign a network adress to the computer. </s>
<s> If clicking Repair does not restore connectivity, the problem might be with the network, not with this computer&quot; I tried to repair and this was unsuccessful. </s>
<s> I updated my Lavasoft Ad-Aware SE Professional ref. </s>
<s> file (23.03.2005) recently and i read something about some people having network problems after. </s>
<s> I am using an IBM ThinkPad (XP Professional SP 2, Intel Pentium M 1400MHz 598 MHz. </s>
<s> 256 MB of RAM). </s>
<s> I had to connect to internet via 56k Modem. </s>
<s> I just updated ref. </s>
<s> file (11.04.2005) on this IBM and i am now up-to-date on Windows Update. </s>
<s> The other computer is a &quot;clone&quot; (correct term?) </s>
<s> running XP Home SP 2, Pentium 4,...) The LAN was running perfect 2 days ago up to now and i checked all cables. </s>
<s> DSL modem says all go. </s>
<s> Is there any other information u need? </s>
<s> I need my internet back! </s>
<s> I can only share that this is not a hardware issue some 90% plus of the time. </s>
<s> Usually a driver the person who installed or they didn't know to install. </s>
<s> Today I'm finding too many that think all they need is on the Microsoft CD or &quot;driver update.&quot; Think again. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> when i did a search for &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot; it took me straight to PC Hardware. </s>
<s> So dats the only reason why i specifically put it here. </s>
<s> I noted that many new Windows installers thought Microsoft would fetch drivers for us. </s>
<s> -&gt; This has never been true. </s>
<s> The burden is entirely on the owner/user/installer. </s>
<s> The magic button &quot;Update Drivers&quot; is nothing but a demo. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Is your LAN onboard?.... </s>
<s> I have this SAME problem I will once I have the money go buy a PCI one.... </s>
<s> I think your card is kind of saying good bye. </s>
<s> If you play games via LAN you might notice the computer hosting the server can't run a server properly..... </s>
<s> I think if you plug your DSL modem into your other PC and share it that way it'll work..... still I'd buy a new one. </s>
