i was part of the management team for the equestrian portion of the 1984 summer olympics, held at the santa anita race track.
i was assigned the task of producing a scenario for the dressage competition so all the volunteers knew (to the minute)when each horse was to leave the barn, enter the warm-up areas, moved to the holding area, get their equipment checked and enter the competition arena.
i was led to the track offices, sat in front of an ibm computer and asked if there were any questions.
&quot;uh,um&quot; i replied brilliantly, looking at the large, dark, intimidating screen.
&quot;how do i turn it on?&quot; it only took a few quick instructions and i was typing away.
my first computer experience.
i was hooked!!
i could backtrack, correct, add things in, move whole paragraphs, proofread and then print it out.
wow!!
by the end of the competition i could turn it on, type, save, copy, save, paste, save, print, save to a floppy and turn it off.
i was computer literate!!
the week after the olympics i was the proud owner of an ibm 8088, the one with the double disk drive.
in another week i had a 10 meg hard drive installed.
wow!
look at all that room.
a few months later i upgraded to the new 286 with a 40 meg drive.
it was so big i knew i would never fill it up.
plus, it was so fast it had to have stepdowns, from 12 mghz to 10 and 8, so the older programs could run.
then came the 486 with the 120 meg drive and a new laser printer as big as a house with a price tag of almost $3,000 but it printed at 300 dpi!!!
then... well, you know how it went from there.
