I have an AMD 64 socket 754 system and my random reboots ended when I moved some USB things off the onboard USB connections.
That was my clue a driver wasn't quite right.
Oddly the PCI USB 2.0 card that I moved them to worked fine.
OK, how to identify the motherboard.
You have the visual method and you can try BELARC ADVISOR and the free version of EVEREST.
