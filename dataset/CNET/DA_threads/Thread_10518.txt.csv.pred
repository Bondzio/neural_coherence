1.1.1	Hi, I have an 06' Dell b110 and it came with a god-awful integrated graphics card.	St
1.1.2	I wanted to upgrade it, no big deal just dissable the old one right?	St
1.1.3	I called into dell and the guy said that a new graphics card could never be installed.	St
1.1.4	That sounded ridiculous to me.	St
1.1.5	Does anyone know why my computer would not be upgradable?	Ques
1.1.6	given I will probably have to upgrade my power supply as well (250wt)	St
1.2.1	What slots on the motherboard would support that new card?	St
1.2.2	There isn't an AGP or PCI-E slot I think based on a little Googling I did about that Dell model.	St
1.2.3	Why would you assume there is such a slot in on entry level system?	St
1.2.4	Regards, JB	St
1.3.1	so I can't do anything shy of a new motheroard?	St
1.3.2	how feasable is that as opposed to a new computer thanks for the help	St
1.4.1	Yes, though if you get a new motherboard then you have to see what can be transferred over as well as the limits of the case as some cards are known for being rather big.	St
1.4.2	My suggestion would be to consider getting a new computer that can be easily upgraded.	St
1.4.3	Regards, JB	St
1.5.1	While you won't be playing Bioshock, there are still fx5200 and better PCI cards.	St
1.5.2	See newegg.com Bob	St
1.6.1	ok, that was really my question.	St
1.6.2	the guy made it sound like there was no way without buying a new computer.	St
1.6.3	thanks a million	Polite
1.7.1	how expensive would a pci card be vs. how much better would it be than my integrated?	St
1.8.1	I thought I noted a link where such could be found.	St
1.8.2	Is that showing or not?	St
1.8.3	If not, please tell us so I can report a forum bug.	Sug
1.8.4	Bob	St
