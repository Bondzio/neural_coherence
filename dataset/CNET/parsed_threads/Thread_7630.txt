<s> Problem: No Audio device recognised by windows multimedia control panel. </s>
<s> Soundmax Integrated Digital Audio Device recognised by device manager & driver OK (reinstalled numerous times) - On Compaq Presario Laptop V4000 (new feb '06) Sounds simple but all my audio software that can choose anything other than the windows default device work fine. </s>
<s> Nothing that automatically needs the windows default device will work (Skype, WinMP 9 or 10, Quicktime, Guitar Pro, Picasa Videos). </s>
<s> Situation: Tried uninstalling/reinstalling all drivers video & audio Tried uninstalling all media players becuase of possibly conflicts Sofware Device enumerator seems to be running OK (how to reinstall this??) </s>
<s> PNP services all running Win Audio services all running No option in BIOS for enabling/disabling internal sound card (enabled in windows anyway) I'm being driven nuts by this because I feel like I should be able to fix the problem without reinstalling my OS. </s>
<s> Thanks for any suggestions. </s>
