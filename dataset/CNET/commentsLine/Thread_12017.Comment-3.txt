since the ssd will be the boot drive that dictates where it has to go, 1st device or link to be booted.
you just treat it like any other hd out there.
fyi- don't try to use the ssd too intensity it becomes harder and harder for the ssd to maintain its level of keeping all in order as unlike a std.
hd it tends to have the problem of frequent area of media becoming unable to clear media for use, thus the trim cmd.
is required.
all is done to help maintain the storage media doesn't over use same media area and maybe rendered unable to store/clear itself.
which defeats the purpose of any storage media.
google for trim to understand what its trying to do.
i offer this as what you plan to use it as gaming, that it isn't at some time become inoperable as it can't recover from frequent use.
some ssd just up and die, giving no warning.
yes, some ssd are better than others, so if compared you'll noticed a price difference for similar rated storage do vary.
