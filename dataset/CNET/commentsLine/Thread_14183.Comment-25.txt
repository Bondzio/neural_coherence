as i posted later in the forum, my first three computers were an apple iie, a dos-based tandy 2500sx/20 built in 1992 and a 1996 panasonic toughbook cf-25.
the cheapest cell phone available today has more available brainpower than all three computers combined!!!
also, i played around with basic for some things, but have never really needed it since my first experience with windows 9x/me (which was in high school, in 1999, a full four years after windows 95 launched).
