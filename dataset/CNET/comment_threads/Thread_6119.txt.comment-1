Greetings; I need a new graphics card with an HDMI port.
have a refurbished lenovo with: Pentium E2140 1.6 GHz processor Lenovo MB - LPCIO; chipset: Intel 946PL/GZ southboard: 82801 GB Bios: 2QKT22AUS graphics: Intel 946GZ DDR2 memory - 2gb None of this really means anything to me!
But I'm reasonably confident I can install a new card .
.
.
took computer data from CPU-Z software - recommended somewhere here I'm only going to watch internet video (TV networks and Netflix) with this computer - connected to a 1080 hd samsung TV.
that's it!
Don't need anything special; but have no idea how to find a graphics card that's compatible with MB thanks in advance Let me know if I forgot some spec you need Happy Holidays!
Kelly
