<s> I have a Western Digital 80gb drive that i was using as an external drive. </s>
<s> I took the drive off for a bit and I believe I even placed some of my friends files on there so that I can back up his drive. </s>
<s> WEELLL now that I have placed the drive back into the casing to make it a external hard drive again, nothing picks up, i made sure all the jumpers where in place correctly and nothing. </s>
<s> when placing the drive into my pc as a slave this is what i see WDC$WD84VFB-04CEA6 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 17.47W17 and then my machine will not boot up. </s>
<s> I take the drive off and i am able to get into my computer. </s>
<s> I have alot of pics on that drive including of my late mother that just recently passed away and some of my exfiance, yeah i know shes my ex but I still like too see her pics and I have other personal pics on there. </s>
<s> Is there ANYTHING that can be done???? </s>
<s> Please let me know </s>
<s> WD drives are jumpered differently than most other Mfr's drives. </s>
<s> Ive Actually tried every jumper, trial by error, and the jumper has been on a slave for months now never changed it. </s>
<s> This is killing me lol </s>
<s> That is how WD drives get set as Master with no other drive on the cable. </s>
<s> However I'm not sure of whether the USB case actually uses the jumpering. </s>
<s> For Master only WD puts the jumper horizontally ONLY for the purposes of providing a jumper for future use. </s>
<s> be fine, so don't do anything radical. </s>
<s> Possibly using it at both locations changed or corrupted something re the MBR or such. </s>
<s> Worse comes to worse get a Knoppix CD and put the drive into a computer as Master [the only drive in the computer at the time and see if the Knppix CD gives access to the data. </s>
<s> Robert Proffitt, a Moderator here, and a few others are experts on use of the Knoppix CD. </s>
<s> I have two and have never even tried one. </s>
<s> Actually yeah, and with the external casing the drive has to be placed with a jumper dont know why, but its been on as a slave for about a year or a year and half now. </s>
<s> Ive never had a problem until now with the drive, maybe the ide board on the hd went. </s>
