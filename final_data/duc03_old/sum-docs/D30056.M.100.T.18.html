Chechen authorities found the remains of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village in the breakaway region in southern Russia.
British officials said they had not received any ransom demand for the missing men.
An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kms west of Grozny, the Chechen capital.
A Foreign Office minister said Monday that the British phone company whose four employees were kidnapped in Chechnya at the weekend was specifically warned to withdraw from Russia's breakaway region, but ignored the advice.
