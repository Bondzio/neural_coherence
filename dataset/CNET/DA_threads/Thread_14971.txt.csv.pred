1.3.1	Low cost entry 32-bit mass market offering?	St
1.4.1	To add to what other posters mentioned, let me say in layman's term, &quot;the VW of cpus&quot; It gets you from A to Z, w/o fancy overhead but don't expect a geewhiz factor, it just gets the job done on the cheap.	St

1.5.1	CPUs on the low cost.	St
1.5.2	Basicaly Semprons are the older 32 bit socket A Athlons with a new lable.	St

1.5.6	Two years ago I built a PC with a AMD Athlon 2400+.	St
1.5.7	A few months ago I did another one for a friend who wanted to keep the cost low, used a Sempron 2400+.	St
