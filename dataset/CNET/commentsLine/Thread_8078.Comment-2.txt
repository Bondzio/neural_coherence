wide screen can be helpful if you are multitasking.
the images are not 'distorted' becuase wide screens should be set to wide dimensions.
a set number of pixels such as 1600x900.
since an image is always the same number pixels across, as long as you are using the correct resolution its fine.
the slide show will be fine.
if it isn't just disable stretch to fit in the screen saver settings.
