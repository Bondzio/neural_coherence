<s> Hello I've been gifted a mitsumi cd r/rw drive by a mate who has replaced it with a dvd writer on his machine. </s>
<s> I now want to use the cd r/rw to replace the cd rom drive that I've got in my machine (HP Pavilion 7910 running windows ME). </s>
<s> Plugging it in seemed to work Ok and I've downloaded the driver from the MITSUMI website. </s>
<s> But the drive seems to think it is still a CD ROM and not a CD R/rw drive, (although it did recognise the drive was a different make to the old one). </s>
<s> So I can't write anything! </s>
<s> I've looked in the device manager and it does not seem to give an option for installing a cd r/rw; it only lists a cd rom. </s>
<s> What am I missing here? </s>
<s> How do I get the PC to recognise that I've got a cd writer installed? </s>
<s> Cheers for any help </s>
<s> But you could install CD recording software such as http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ and use the drive. </s>

<s> Thanks for the help - it worked perfectly. </s>
<s> Much appeciated. </s>
<s> regards Graham </s>
<s> Definitely something I use a lot. </s>
