1.1.1	hi, i am thinking of getting a new buffalo router with the options of 3 wi-fi networks however i was wondering would this add alot to the internet traffic more than a single network.	St
1.1.2	i will have 4 computers on this router 1 on 1 network 1 on another network and 2 on the last network how will this affect my traffic if altall ?	Ques
1.2.1	You'll divide your available internet bandwidth among the devices using it at any one time.	St
1.2.2	It's that simple.	St
1.2.3	If you're only using one device, you'll have all available bandwidth at your disposal.	St
1.2.4	If you're downloading one one or more connected devices and surfing the web on another, you may experience some slowness depending on your broadband connection speed.	St
1.3.1	at the moment i have 10mb with 3 computers on 1 network this will change to 4 computers over 3 networks so any trouble or will it b fine ?	Ques
1.4.1	to where only your 4 computers can be on at once, there shouldn't be a noticeable difference.	St
1.4.2	But, frankly, I don't see what's to gain by creating 3 separate networks with only 4 computers.	St
1.5.1	i will be add more computers (friends) to differnt netowrks for sharing data then family then another guest for family friends and thank you for your information	St
1.6.1	Going from 3 to 4 potential users won't make much difference.	St
1.6.2	Adding more to the system of networks to accommodate more users has to potential to cause serious bottlenecks depending on how much and what all these folks download from the internet.	St
1.6.3	It's streaming video and movie downloads that tie up bandwidth.	St
1.6.4	General surfing uses much less.	St
1.6.5	This sounds like a generous move on your part.	St
1.7.1	so over all there would b little impact on the internet traffic.	St
1.7.2	the 3 users at the moment use file sharing programs, skype etc.	St
1.7.3	and it is fine with no problems and the only need for networks are file sharing and parental control regulations.	St
1.7.4	thank you for the above reply	Polite
