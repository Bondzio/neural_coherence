1.1.1	Hey , everybody .	St
1.1.2	I was wondering if someone could help me out with this problem .	St
1.1.3	I bought a brand-new Samsung ML-2010 laser printer from Buy.com about a month and a half ago , and I 've been having this recurring issue with it .	St
1.1.4	The printer worked like a charm for the first few weeks , but now its useless .	St
1.1.5	The problem used to pop up here and there , but now I cant print anything at all .	St
1.1.6	Basically , every time I turn on the printer , it warms up ( or attempts to ) and after a few seconds , the red error light starts blinking .	St
1.1.7	If I try to print a document , I get a message saying that theres been a fuser error .	St
1.1.8	I dont know what that is , and Samsungs troubleshooting utility did n't give me anything beyond the ol Turn it off , wait 10 seconds , then turn it back on .	St
1.1.9	If that doesnt work , contact a service representative method .	St
1.1.10	I havent been able to find any solutions on Samsungs support site , and nothing helpful came up when I googled the terms Samsung fuser error ( or variants ) .	St
1.1.11	If anyone has any useful information at all , Id really appreciate it .	St
1.1.12	Thanks in advance !	St
1.1.13	FYI , Im using : Toshiba Satellite A55-S326 notebook Intel Pentium M 1.6 GHz 512 MB RAM ( shared video memory ) Windows XP Home SP2 USB 2.0 connection to printer starter toner cartridge ( it came with the printer )	St
1.2.1	A fuser problem is serious but since this is a new printer , use the warranty now .	St
1.2.2	Do n't play with it as more than likely you ca n't recover and you *MAY VOID* the warranty in any attempts , so use the warranty .	St
1.2.3	You should have returned it immediately once the problem cropped-up to be within the quicker satifaction settlement period , you may now have to deal with a warranty center if not the vendor themselves for repair , but start the process .	St
1.2.4	Plus , document this as well , cal , s letters , etc .	St
1.2.5	to best serve yourself if any other problems arise .	St
1.2.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I had the same issue , but right after the warranty ran out .	St
1.3.2	My Mac can see the printer , but nothing prints , and the two front-panel lights blink in unison .	St
1.3.3	Talked to a sales rep for a mail-order place and she chuckled and implied that this is all-too-common with this series .	St
1.3.4	She suggested an HP as a replacement .	St
1.3.5	So much for Samsung ...	St
1.4.1	I do n't know if parts are readily available for fixing the ML .	St
1.4.2	The good news is the 2010 is so darn cheap its just as good to buy new as any repair costs .	St
1.4.3	The same for HP , especially low end models .	St
1.4.4	I believe the ML-2010 is under $ 100 online maybe better to google away for a source .	St
1.4.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	I have had more than 7 of these printers.. bought on sale at buy.com and staples ... and given to family members and friends..	St
1.5.2	Sadly the story is always the same .	St
1.5.3	At first they work fine.. but in as little as a week or two you either get fuser error which is the kiss of death ... or the paper jam light as the paper goes halfway in and then just stops .	St
1.5.4	Now I 've spoken to Samsung about this and they just stonewall you ! !	St
1.5.5	Exactly what I mean by that is any solution generally costs more than what you paid for the printer new !	St
1.5.6	I had the fuser error after no more than 30 prints total on the machine and since it was a NEW MACHINE but had been sitting unopened in the box for over a year SAMSUNG WOULD DO NOTHNIG EXCEPT talk in circles telling me to PAY MORE THAN IT COST NEW ! !	St
1.5.7	REMEMBER ... this was after only 30 prints total on the machine ! ! ! !	St
1.5.8	I think there should be a public YOUTUBE video session of people taking Samsung products and throwing them out the window , smashing below , .. to the music/soundtrack of their customer support giving useless excuses that cost more than the product did in the first place .	St
1.5.9	I 've written to three different addresses for higher up help at Samsung and they have never got back to me .	St
1.5.10	Samsung USA is managed by Korean transplants who SEEM NOT TO CARE the way you might expect an executive from a US firm would .	St
1.5.11	Their corporate culture apparently is aloof and unresponsive to consumer sentiments .	St
