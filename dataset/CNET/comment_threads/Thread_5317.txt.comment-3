IMHO, you're better off getting a new system or DIY with new parts.
Why?
Because the cost of the upgrade parts will help pay for new but also be even more capable of win7 usage and longevity.
You have a dated system and other than adding more ram should consider leaving it.
But, if you have access to used or reasonably cheap parts go for it.
Checkout eBay, Craigslist and/or shop online at www.shopgoodwill.com for parts and cost.
For new parts cost to place in old system which may not be transferable to a newer system when the time arrives.
Think what best suits you.
