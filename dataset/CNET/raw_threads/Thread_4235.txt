The past week I have noticed my montor will flicker and then make all my windows have this huge distorted look similar to a &quot;pulled taffy&quot; wide effect. Sometimes it will flicker back to normal 800x600 but lately it has been staying stuck at that wide window look. I have tried the manual controls, doing a windows update and applying 800x600 again in Control Panel but nothing brings permanent solutions. Before I shell out $$ for a new monitor (which comes at a bad time after spending $ on textbooks.) Is there something I am overlooking or is it time to chuck it? I have a 6 year old Comp USA 17&quot; CRT. My destop is brand new, almost a year old. Thanks.
