1.1.1	I am needing a new desktop pc .	St
1.1.2	mine is just very sluggish and there are missing files such where i cant defrag and a few other things .	St
1.1.3	my current machine is 3 years old , it was custom built at a local shop , though i ve had a lot of issues with this one .	St
1.1.4	its Pentium 2.67gh dual core , 2G of Ram .	St
1.1.5	my problem is i run alot of programs at once .	St
1.1.6	my business is online , i have several websites so i have alot of different software applications open at once , i use firefox with 12+ tabs open at once and i know its a resource hog , jing , excel , word , outlook , money anda few others always open at once .	St
1.1.7	i know i can probably shut alot down but i dont so i need a computer to handle this .	St
1.1.8	i just waste too much time in a day with the slowness of this thing .	St
1.1.9	i say all this bc the last time i told the guy what i did , he said , oh thats nothing , this is what you need and yes , it was fine for awhile but as i started to use more programs and add more stuff to my computer it would start to get slower .	St
1.1.10	its nothing like i want it .	St
1.1.11	i have a new laptop and that runs great but obviuosly it doesnt have all the stuff i have on my pc but that type of speed is what i want in a new desktop and need to know what i need to meet it .	St
1.1.12	so a few questiosn i have are.. 1 - since i do a lot of multi-tasking , would a quad core be beneficial to me ?	Ques
1.1.13	i researched the forums on here for this issue and a bit confused , i hear its good for multi tasking but then i hear most software today wont utilize this yet .	St
1.1.14	so thats why i listed what i use my computer for to see if i would benefit from a quad .	St
1.1.15	2 - also confused on processors and processing speeds .	St
1.1.16	i see the AMD PhenomX4 but the ones i am looking at are 1.8 to 2.2gh with 4GB of Ram but these are all quad core while some others i looked at were 2.8 Intel duo core , and another triple core at 2.1gh AMD PhenomX3 , both with 6GB of ram .	St
1.1.17	so which would be giving me the best performance of what i need ?	Ques
1.1.18	bottom line is just trying to find something where i can multitask and not have to worry about shutting down programs everytime i want to open up a new one just so the machine doesnt get sluggish .	St
1.1.19	this time i decided to get some advice instead of taking recommendations from a salesman .	St
1.1.20	thanks in advance chris	Polite
1.2.1	look for phenom IIs , as the older phenoms by amd were n't that great .	St
1.2.2	4GB of ram and greater should be good .	St
1.2.3	HP currently has 25 % bing cashback , maybe you can configure a system there for cheap .	St
1.3.1	if your pc is sluggish , you 're probably running low on ram or have some crapware/malware .	St
1.3.2	the apps you mention can consume a lot of ram , but they are not cpu intensive .	St
1.3.3	i suggest you do delete any apps you do n't use , do a reinstall of the os , and add another 1gb of ram .	Sug
1.3.4	if you must get a new pc , the low end phenoms you 're looking at wo n't be much of an improvement since they 're clocked slower than your existing pc .	St
1.3.5	a pc with & gt ; 4gb and either a 2.8ghz phenom ii or a 2.6 ghz core2quad should make you happy for the next few years .	St
