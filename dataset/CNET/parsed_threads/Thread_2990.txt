<s> After upgrading to iTunes 8, my CD drive (TEAC DW-224E-B) has stopped recognizing cds. </s>
<s> The drive is showing up on &quot;My Computer&quot;, where it seems to be working properly and is showing up on Device manager, where, there are no errors. </s>
<s> Uninstalling and reinstalling iTunes has not helped. </s>
<s> iTunes was giving an error message, which said that registry values for importing and burning cds are missing and that iTunes needs to be reinstalled. </s>
<s> However, that message went away when I changed the UpperFilters value to GEARAspiWDM (with carriage return). </s>
<s> CD drive drivers seem to be working. </s>
<s> I also tried booting the computer in safe mode. </s>
<s> Once again the drive showed up in My Computer, but failed to recognize cds. </s>
<s> As the computer boots, it tries to access the CD drive, fails, and gives up after a while. </s>
<s> Could someone help me fix the problem? </s>
<s> System info: Fujitsu S6231, Windows XP SP 3. </s>
<s> check to see if the imapi and helper service has been stopped also, try a less bloated alternative to itunes- It's called songbird (has a look and feel of ituned) and is compatible with ipod syncing </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestion. </s>
<s> I think I have a faulty drive. </s>
<s> I tried booting with an xp installation cd, and the drive failed to locate it. </s>
<s> That should mean that the drive is not working even outside windows. </s>
