but i'm getting ahead of myself here.
this is not an answer to how to get vpn to work across routers that don't do vpn but what i see companies do for the mobile troops.
ready?
they put what is needed up on a web server with a  interface.
secure http is the next step and your company moves from vpn to web interfaces for the workflow.
