I want to help you out but try the forum sticky post and those settings first.
With so many needing help this gets the usual out of the way.
If you need personal service then pay for it.
This is free so help others by using the sticky so we get to help more folk.
There are a few that consider this rude but I can't imagine why.
Do tell!
Bob
