Good question; dumb answer, ahtoi.
I've wondered about this myself: if I want 'noise-cancelling' head/earphones, I want the really annoying noise cancelled, which is as often as not the very transient phenomena that 'cancellation' handles poorly: apple/carrot snackers, far-ters, toe-tappers, finger drummers, drivel-talkers, knuckle-crackers, too-loud earphone brain-damaged music listeners.
I remember one reviewer saying some headphones worked great on a plane to cancel internal jet-noise, but there was a mysterious clicking/popping sound in the phones; the passenger next to him was bopping along to some earphone music with mouth-click/pop accompaniment.
I gathered the plane noise would have been preferable masking of this idiocy than the useless 'cancellation': the most annoying noise was coming through front and center.
