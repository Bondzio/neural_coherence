ugh my friend had the same problem until he &quot;smashed&quot; his motherboard &quot;intel&quot; (sorry but from what i have seen now and heard so much about some intel board just don't work well for nvidia and over clocking.
plus it could have been the fact that it only cost him 40$ for the what i think was an already broken board from another friend at work.
)and decided to get a asus mother board what board do you have?
i have had no problems like this as i have an asus but i have been having a long boot up time lately all.
the thing is i just have redone my gpu, mb chipset 648 and my cpu intel p4 3000mhz all with arctic 5 series sliver thermal paste.
the thing is ever since i have done this it &quot;seems&quot; to take a longer while to boot up to detect the screen and come on you to the test screen.
the fans all race but i'm suspecting that this might be from it just detecting everything.
if anyone has any advice that could help much appreciated and thanks.
