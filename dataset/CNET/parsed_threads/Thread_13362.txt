<s> If you are looking for the future, I still prefer Intel, that performs excellent with games only slightly being beaten by AMD in various setups. </s>
<s> People who have AMD, and the young gamers with less expensive AMD chipsets will naturally favor AMD. </s>
<s> In the professional area Intel has the advantage over AMD. </s>
<s> Later info from Tomshardware in a November 15, 2004 article. </s>
<s> A quote from their conclusion: &quot;If games are your main interest, AMD is still impossible to beat. </s>
<s> However, the more you move into the professional area with applications such as A/V encoding or rendering, the more attractive the P4 will be. </s>
<s> Increased support for the SSE3 instruction set will only add on top of Intel's advantage here; this is an area that still needs to be addressed by AMD.&quot; http://www17.tomshardware.com/cpu/20041115/index.html We have recently seen the advent of dual Video cards in home use computers, re the ASUS A8N-SLI Deluxe motherboard. </s>
<s> Before long there will be dual core CPU's in home computers to complement the dual video cards, CPU systems similar to the server Opteron System and Xeon System. </s>
<s> The Front Side Bus (FSB) has recently jumped from 800 to 1066 and Intel has introduced their 925XE chipset to support it. </s>
