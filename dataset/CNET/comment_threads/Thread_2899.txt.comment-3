Yeah, the casual gaming is mostly World of Warcraft- It eats up some time, but I'm definitely not too hardcore.
Thankfully Blizzard had the insight to make WOW playable on some lower-end machines.
If I could get a machine- no moniter, I have a 17&quot; LCD which I love- for 800 bucks or less, that would be super.
(Don't laugh- I know its possible.)
Any ideas here?
The cheaper the better- I just don't want garbage, either.
