not getting it deposited inside of the 30 days of recieving it is NOT their fault, it is YOUR fault thir statement to reissue it is rather good, and in reality I don't think you have any right to complain given that YOU did not deposit the check inside of the MONTH THAT YOU HAD TO DO SO so, please don't complain at them for your mistake
