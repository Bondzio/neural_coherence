1.1.1	I have an tripplite omnismart 1400 ( 5 batteries , 6v 12ah ) .	St
1.1.2	I am trying to replace the batteries .	St
1.1.3	I neglected writing down how they were installed prior to removal ( BIG mistake ! ) .	St
1.1.4	Now I am trying to re-install them but it does not look right .	St
1.1.5	It currently look like : Black - to ups electronics red - red black - black red - black red - black red - to ups electronics .	St
1.1.6	I do not think this is correct even though the wires all fit .	St
1.1.7	Any help would really be appreciated - thanks ... ... ... ... ..	Polite
1.2.1	1111 W. 35th Street Chicago , IL 60609 USA Customer Support : ( 773 ) 869-1234 www.tripplite.com I had one of their UPS and when it came time to replace the batteries I found it cheaper to buy a new UPS because of the cost of batteries and S & H fees .	St
1.3.1	I emailed tripplite and explained the problem .	St
1.3.2	They emailed me back and told me that I would need to hire a journeyman electrician ( really ! ) .	St
1.3.3	I have the new batteries ( cost 48.00 - the 1400 is worth 350.00 ) .	St
1.3.4	All I can say that I would not recommend ANYBODY buy a tripplite UPS as their technical is n't just bad , not even a joke - its non-existant !	St
1.3.5	It would have been incredibly easy for them to simply supply the wiring diagram for daisy chaining the batteries - instead they want me to hire an electrician !	St
1.3.6	The rules for this are pretty simple , actually .	St
1.3.7	To bump the voltage I should go + to + and - to - .	St
1.3.8	To bump the amps I should got + to - , etc .	St
1.3.9	My problem is that I ended up with mixed wires and I do not think that can be right , even though everything fits - hence my query .	St
1.3.10	My concern is that if I do it wrong I will destroy the ups .	St
1.3.11	Thanks for the reply ... ... ... ...	Polite
1.4.1	Given the reply you got from their tech support I agree with you .	St
1.4.2	See site http : //www.zbattery.com/seriesparallel.html for info on hooking batteries in series and parallel , I think you may have it backwards .	St
1.4.3	Triplite site says that your model uses http : //www.tripplite.com/products/product.cfm ? productID=2544 & quot ; UPS Replacement Battery Cartridge , Model # : RBC53 .	St
1.4.4	This cartridge contains three 12V batteries .	St
1.4.5	You said you have five 6V batteries .	St
1.4.6	Which of these are the right batteries ?	Ques
1.4.7	I 'm not sure what to say .	Res
1.4.8	Is your model older and nolonger listed ?	Ques
1.4.9	Well as I said in the subject I 'm not sure what to say .	St
1.4.10	How about good luck .	Polite
1.4.11	Maybe you can find someone with the same model and open it up and draw a diagram of how to wire in your batteries .	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.5.2	I know about the specs for the unit .	St
1.5.3	I did an internet search and found that the number of betteries , etc .	St
1.5.4	is a moving target ( even on the tripplite site ) .	St
1.5.5	I bought this unit from Tripplite so I have to believe they sent it out right .	St
1.5.6	An interesting thing is that there is room for 6 batteries but they only put 5 in and the space , for the 6th , is taken up with a piece of foam .	St
1.5.7	The more I think about all the problems I am having , the lack of real response from tripplite and the fact that this unit seems to have any number of battery configurations simply reinforces my believe that this is just not a company a person wants to do business with .	St
1.5.8	The unit , incidentally , has worked well for well over a year but given the current problems I would never do it again .	St
1.6.1	You were right .	Res
1.6.2	I had it exactly wrong .	St
1.6.3	I decided to go guts and hook everything in series .	St
1.6.4	Nothing smoked , the voltages were correct ( 120v ) and I will borrow an amp probe to make sure of the amps although without a load I am not sure it would be accurate ( its been a while since I did electrical stuff ( different from building computers ) ) .	St
1.6.5	Again - thanks for the reply .	Polite
1.6.6	If this is wrong I will post that later .	St
1.7.1	I know this is an old post , but this info from Tripp Lite is the answer : http : //m.tripplite.com/en/model.cfm ? txtModelID=18 It says the DC is 36v which means you were right .	St
1.7.2	The batteries are in series !	St
1.7.3	!	St
