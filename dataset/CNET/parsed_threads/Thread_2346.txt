<s> I'll explain my layout: I have DSL internet and 2 computers. </s>
<s> One computer has 2 network cards, the other has one. </s>
<s> I have the DSL modem going into one of the network cards on computer A. </s>
<s> The 2nd card on computer A is hooked up to a 5 port switch. </s>
<s> Computer B is also hooked up to the switch. </s>
<s> Before I had broadband i used dialup. </s>
<s> This set up worked fine for dial up, but for some reason the internet wont work at all if i try to network the 2 computers using this method. </s>
<s> Please help me! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> to the mix. </s>
<s> For as little as $20, you get a device which will service the Internet connection as well as provide the infrastructure for a local area network. </s>
<s> ICS works fine until some software incapatibility wrecks the networking ability of XP. </s>
<s> A hardware solution is best. </s>
<s> Add the router, get rid of one of the NICs. </s>
<s> Connect the PCs to the router. </s>
<s> Done. </s>
<s> Is the 5 port swith a router also? </s>
<s> If is it then you won't have to buy a round and you would disregard the second nic card and connect the dsl directly to the switch and run ur network and share the internet thru that if now,then I would suggest buying a rounter to make things simple. </s>
<s> You can also set the net on PC A then run the XP network wizard on PC a with internet sharing then run the network wizard on PC B telling it to get NET access from PC A. </s>
<s> *** Do not foget on to distinguish the NIC cards on PC A properly 1 would be for the net and the other for the network with internet sharing enabled. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
