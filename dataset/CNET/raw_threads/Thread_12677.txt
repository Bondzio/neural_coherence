I used to be able to, but i think ever since i reinstalled my operating system, win xp pro, i can't access it anymore. they don't have wep or anything like that, but you do need some sort of certificate to go onto the internet and such, but you are able to access the network when you connect to download it. but the problem is that when i try connecting i can't get past the router, it recognizes it but it won't connect me. any advice?

I have a Linksys DWL-G630 and it's the worst of all the cards we have at the office. If this is yours (you didn't tell!), the I'd exchange it for any other make/model. 2. &quot; I used to be able to, but i think ever since i reinstalled my operating system, win xp pro, i can't access it anymore&quot; Installing an OS on a machine is not enough. You'll need motherboard, system drivers and more drivers before such PC-Cards will work. It's either a balky card or your OS install is incomplete. Bob
