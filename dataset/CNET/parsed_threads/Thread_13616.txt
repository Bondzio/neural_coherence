<s> Just over a year ago I purchased a Maxtor Shared Storage II NAS drive. </s>
<s> My needs were basic; all I wanted to do was serve MP3 files to my Sonos streaming music system. </s>
<s> Problem was, only after I bought the drive did I find out about it's record of unreliability, and sure enough after 6 months it started to play up. </s>
<s> A few tips off the web plus a few hours talking to Maxtor did get it up and running, but I still didn't trust it so backed up my crucial files to DVD. </s>
<s> That proved wise; almost the day it went out of warranty it's failed completely, so now I'm in the market another solution. </s>
<s> My needs have changed slightly though... - Serve content to my Sonos as before (I only have a measly 15gb of music right now, though); - Provide a reliable backup solution for the two laptops my partner and I use (I think that means I need RAID 1 config, correct? </s>
<s> ); - In future, serve HD video content to my main TV. </s>
<s> The backup piece is probably the most important thing for me now - I've just bought a new digital SLR and have a baby on the way, so I need to be able to backup my files safely, reliably and with the minimum of fuss. </s>
<s> Speed is not so crucial - as long as it can keep up with pushing 720p content down a wired link to the TV, that should be good enough. </s>
<s> I've taken a look online, but have become rather confused by the options on offer. </s>
<s> What would people suggest? </s>
<s> I have up to 300 to spend on the right solution. </s>
<s> I'm a technology lover, but not a techie - I'm not against buying a NAS cage and installing drives if that's the most reliable option, but I don't want to spend hour after frustrating hour setting it up only to get unreliable performance. </s>
<s> As a result I like the look of the Buffalo Linkstation Pro Duo, but don't know much about it - are the drives possible to replace if one fails? </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be much appreciated - frankly I'm surprised at how few of the consumer targetted NAS solutions get a good writeup! </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Matt </s>
<s> No suggestions from anyone? </s>
<s> Would be much appreciated...thanks! </s>
<s> Matt </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas on this one? </s>
<s> Thanks, Matt </s>
<s> I'd consider the Apple Time Machine. </s>
