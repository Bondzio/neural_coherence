seeing browsing the web myself looking for upgrades(don't quote me, only going by memory): case: get full tower, you'll need it for cooling power supply: anywear from 750-1000 cpu: I've been looking at them myself (I have a 64x2 4400).
The 6000 can use up to 140w itself.
with the 2gpu's and 6000 the psu should probably be closer to 1000 to be on the safe side.
