you write:&quot;my pc has 2 wd wide scsi hard drives, each 9.1 gb.
i want to replace them with 2 bigger eide hard drives of 40gb each.
my motherboard supports both scsi and eide interfaces, and also there is a raid slot( not in use).
my question is if it is possible to do and how do i go about doing it?
i would greatly appreciate your support on this one guys.
thanks&quot; temu, you didn't state if date needed to be moved so this will be easy.
just use a nice 80 conductor ide cable, set both drives to cable select and plug the drive pair into a primary ide channel.
you may need to set the bios to autodetect the drives and a bios update might be required if the drives are beyond the supported size.
install your os, pull your files from backup and store the scsi stuff for a rainy day if you want to recover some forgotten file.
