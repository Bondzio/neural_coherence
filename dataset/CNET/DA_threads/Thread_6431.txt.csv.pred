1.1.1	Hi Guys/Gals , My wireless connection is not working and i can not log on to it , I have connected a Netgear WGT624 V3 Wireless Router to my Motorola SurfBoard SB5101E Modem which is connected to Telewest Cable Broadband ( internet works fine if i access directly through the modem ) , on the router the power light is lit and also the internet light flashes rapidly but the wireless light comes on for a couple of seconds and then goes out - i think this is the problem ?	Ques
1.1.2	I have tried logging on to the router to check the wireless settings but can not access it , i have also tried connecting directly via LAN but can not get this to work either although i am not sure if i have connected it correctly ?	Ques

1.3.1	What computer make & model ?	Ques
1.3.2	What computer OS ?	Ques
1.3.3	If XP , is it SP2 and fully updated ?	Ques
1.3.4	Use a working Internet connection to download and install ALL the latest drivers from the PC maker 's website .	St
1.3.5	If you purchased the wireless adapter separately , download and install the wireless adapter drivers from the adapter maker 's website .	St
1.3.6	Make a wired connection to a numbered port on the back of the router .	St
1.3.7	Can you log in to the routers admin page now ?	Ques
1.3.8	* * * * * Ultimately , you need to follow the procedure to install the latest firmware on the router : http : //kbserver.netgear.com/products/WGT624v3.asp The REFERENCE MANUAL is there , too .	St
1.4.1	I have exactly the same problem as this and is connected in the same way , i have a degree in Networking , and cant resolve this problem , Im thinking it must be a fault with the product and will have to contact netgear .	St
1.4.2	Before this however , I will try to login using a different Ip address ; 192.168.0.1 as opposed to the 192.168.0.2 as it says in the manual .	St
1.4.3	If anyone else had this problem can you tell me what you did to resolve it ? ?	Ques

1.5.1	Hi mate , Well it is now sorted , what i did is connect the router to the modem as stated ( make sure your modem is on when you power it back up as some go in to standby ) .	St
1.5.2	Then i connected a LAN cable to the modem and logged in to it that way , then i ran the wizard and hey presto it works ! !	St
1.5.3	Maybe this will work for you as well !	St
1.5.4	Regards , BigG ... ..	St
1.6.1	Login is http : //www.routerlogin.net/ The manual for me Netgear WGR614v6 says http : //192.168.1.1/basicsetting.htm But I use http : //www.routerlogin.com/basicsetting.htm I would try these and see if you can login .	St
1.6.2	Probably the last one will work .	St

1.7.1	I bought a refurbished router .	St
1.7.2	Netgear indicated that the installation guide and software can be downloaded from their website , but I could only find firmware .	St
1.7.3	Anyone know where I can find installation software ?	Ques
1.8.1	ftp : //downloads.netgear.com/files/wgt624_install_guide.zip But I do n't see it tell us to use any install software .	St
1.8.2	Go figure why since it 's a web browser interface ?	Ques
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	Here is the manual http : //kbserver.netgear.com/pdf/wgt624v3_ref_manual_25Apr05.pdf Follow the instructions .	St
1.9.2	Rick	St
1.10.1	Okay , I 'm having pretty much the same problem , with the exception that I have no Wireless or Internet light activity .	St
1.10.2	All computers connected to the router still have internet , but I ca n't log into the router at all with routerlogin or IP Addresses .	St
1.10.3	And I ca n't connect to the router wirelessly at all .	St
1.10.4	Any suggestions ?	Ques

1.12.1	Unfortunately I do n't have ZoneAlarm so that did n't help at all , but thanks for trying .	St
1.13.1	I 'm reading reports of it breaking Norton and more .	St
1.13.2	Since I do n't see what you use , uninstall the KB noted at http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html ? forumID=5 & threadID=300621 & messageID=2808407	St
1.14.1	Have your computer connect .	St
1.14.2	Start , run or hit the Windows Key and the R key at the same time .	St
1.14.3	typr cmd hit enter type ipconfig /all ( space between the g and / ) hit enter look for the default gateway .	St
1.14.4	Might look something like 192.168.1.1 What ever the default gateway is , Open your browser and type the default gateway in the browser .	St
1.14.5	It will then prompt you for your username and password .	St
1.14.6	Hope this helps .	St
1.14.7	Rick	St
1.15.1	You should know that if router is not set up to allow wireless login then it will deny you .	St
1.15.2	Try to login to the router by directly connecting your computer ( preferably the one you used on initial setup ) to it .	St
1.15.3	Normally , as others have pointed out , you just type in 192.168.1.1 to connect to the router via a web browser .	St
1.15.4	If this fails then you may have to reset the router so that you can login using the default username & password .	St
1.15.5	Netgear 's official support page : http : //kbserver.netgear.com/products/WGT624v3.asp	St
1.16.1	Set computer to DHCP and let it get IP from switch Based on PudgyOne 's response I flashed on the fact I hard set my laptop 's IP to 192.168.1.2 which should have worked just fine with 198.162.1.1 but the web page would not load .	St
1.16.2	Setting the laptop to DHCP it got the same Ip ! 92.168.1.2 from the netgear switch but the page loaded .	St
1.16.3	what a wonderful way to kill a day so much fun .	St
1.16.4	I consider this a bug as the ipconfig /all returned the same thing for my setting whether I hard set the IP mask and gateway or I let DHCP do it .	St
1.16.5	Yet one works and one does n't .	St
1.17.1	I mistyped the ip in the post should have typed I hard set my laptop 's IP to 192.168.1.2 which should have worked just fine with 198.168.1.1 but the web page would not load .	St
