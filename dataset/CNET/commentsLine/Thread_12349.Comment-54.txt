i have the netgear wgt634u and i use it with vonage service.
this router is awesome.
i have a 60gb external usb 2.0 hard drive hooked up to the back of it.
i found that it has much better signal strength then the linksys wrt54gs which i took back to fry's because i thought it sucked!
also let it be known that there is a univeral hack for linksys routers becuase of their populairity.
go with the netgear you would be much better off.
i also liked the netgears interface much better then the linksys.
i found it to be cleaner and better organized.
