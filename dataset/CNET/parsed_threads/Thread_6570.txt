<s> Just as the title says. </s>
<s> Here are my problems: 1) USB devices: My computer won't boot if there's a USB device plugged in. </s>
<s> It just stays frozen at the POST stage. </s>
<s> I can't reboot with ctrl-alt-delete; I need to turn it off using the power button. </s>
<s> Also, if I plug a USB device (iPod Nano) in after Windoze loads, I get a message in the taskbar saying that &quot;this device can perform faster&quot; if I had a USB 2.0 port. </s>
<s> This is strange because all my USB ports, on the back of my motherboard, and on the side of the case, are USB 2.0. </s>
<s> 2) Hard drive: My SATA150 hard drive is being recognized as an ATA133 drive in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Also, in my taskbar I have the Safely Remove Hardware icon. </s>
<s> When I click on it, it gives me the option to safely remove the C drive. </s>
<s> I don't know if this could be called a problem; it's just a little worrying to have the option to &quot;safely remove&quot; my hard drive. </s>
<s> 3) DVD: When I try to play a DVD using Windows Media Player, I get a message saying, &quot;Windows Media Player cannot play the DVD because a compatible DVD decoder is not installed on your computer.&quot; Here are my system specs: DFI nF4-DAGF motherboard Athlon 64 3700+ socket 939 2*512MB generic DDR400 ASUS X600 Western Digital 250GB SATA DVD drive DVD-R burner Thermaltake TR2 430 watt power supply Cooler Master Cavalier case Windows XP Home Thanks in advance for any help that anyone can provide. </s>
<s> and reinstalled XP. </s>
<s> What else are you not telling us? </s>
<s> 1.) </s>
<s> Typical behavior if the USB-2 drivers have not been installed. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> Same on the hard drive drivers. </s>
<s> Have you reinstalled all the motherboard drivers? </s>
<s> 3.) </s>
<s> WMP does not come with codecs for DVDs. </s>
<s> You need DVD player software. </s>
<s> ...about 2 weeks ago and I reinstalled Windows. </s>
<s> The first thing that I did after Windows insatlled was to install the USB, chipset, and network drivers that came with the motherboard. </s>
<s> Hard drive drivers? </s>
<s> I thought that Windows XP had a built-in hard drive driver? </s>
<s> Anyway, my hard drive is an OEM drive; it didn't come with any CDs or anything like that. </s>
<s> Installing Windows is not easy. </s>
<s> But you had it proper before. </s>
<s> Just repeat what you did the first time or check the install directions for your system. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...it asked me if I need to install a 3rd party SSCI or RAID driver, which I did not. </s>
<s> The only drivers that came with the motherboard are an SATA RAID driver and drivers for the chipset, USB and onboard LAN. </s>
<s> All of these problems started happening after I installed this motherboard and CPU; before I was using a P4 and an HP motherboard. </s>
<s> My PC was originally an HP, and that's why I don't have any documentation or anything for the hard drive. </s>
<s> And maybe I should mention that I'm using XP Home with SP2 and all the latest updates. </s>
<s> USB: Have you installed the latest nForce4 ADM drivers? </s>
<s> http://www.nvidia.com/object/nforce_nf4_winxp32_x16_6.85 Also, make sure BIOS-&gt;Integrated Peripherals-&gt;OnChip USB is set to V1.1+V2.0. </s>
<s> HD: SATA drives are typically exposed as ATA devices by the mobo unless you turn on RAID. </s>
<s> As for your C: being removable, make sure its write policy is &quot;optimized for performance.&quot; I'll do some more checking to see how to tell Windows its not removable. </s>
<s> DVD: XP doesn't come with a DVD decoder. </s>
<s> You need a third party product like Nero (full version), PowerDVD, WinDVD, etc. </s>
<s> in order to watch DVDs. </s>
<s> There's probably a decoder on your HP software CDs but with the new hardware, it may not think it's an HP PC. </s>
<s> ...it was the first thing I did after I installed WIndows. </s>
<s> I don't have any CDs that originally came with the computer; it was a refurb. </s>
<s> I'll download PowerDVD later today and tell what happens. </s>
<s> are you using front or rear usb ports? </s>
<s> if it still complains about faster operation with the rear ports, something's wrong with the setup. </s>
<s> if it only complains with front ports, then they may not be usb 2.0 compliant. </s>
<s> (don't know what the diff is but my front's only work at 1.1). </s>
<s> The USB ports on the back of the motherboard are USB 2.0, along with the ports on the side of the case. </s>
<s> I get the same message if I plug the device into either port. </s>
<s> BTW, the difference between USB 1.1 and 2.0 is the speed; I can't remember them off-hand, but USB 2.0 is a LOT faster than 1.1. </s>
