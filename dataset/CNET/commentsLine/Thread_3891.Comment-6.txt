i was trying anything... i just added the usb and for some reason the &quot;link&quot; or internet cable light stayed on.....before that, when i followed the disk with the netgear router it would cut off....i live in a small louisiana town but i was able to find 3 computer fixer companies that will come out and take a look.
since cox cable do not tech support netgear...
