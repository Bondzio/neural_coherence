what i want is a small pc running xp pro.
when it boots no one logs on to the pc, but the drive on the pc is shared to the network.
the other 3 computers running xp pro need to access this shared drive.
this is in a peer-to-peer network so there is no server involved.
i'm trying to do this without having to put a client server environment in this really small office.
they don't need the security.
i was planning on not hooking a monitor to the pc and remoting in from one of the other pcs to administer the box if necessary.
does this help?
