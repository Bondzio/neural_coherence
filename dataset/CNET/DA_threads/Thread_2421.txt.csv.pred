1.2.4	While the OS could reveal where the off switch for the floppy can be , I 'll note that in most versions of TWEAKUI , you can hide drive letters in Explorer with TWEAKUI .	St
1.2.5	The test for this one is to open a command prompt , stick a diskette into A : and type ... DIR A : Bob	St
1.3.1	I am unable to Boot from the Floppy .	St
1.3.2	I do n't have TWEAKUI but I tried the Command Promt thing you mentioned and it reflects the items on Diskettes .	St

1.5.1	I am using Windows ME , Gateway Performance 800 Desktop , and Generic Floppy Disk Drive .	St
1.5.2	I downloaded TWEAKUI from two sources ( MS and Annoyances.org . )	St
1.5.3	In each case the install process was supposed to provide a shortcut in the Control Panel but did not .	St
1.5.4	When I attempt to open the tweakui.cpl nothing happens .	St
1.5.5	The .inf file is Greak to me .	St
1.5.6	And the tweakui.hlp file dose n't seem to mention anything about this problem .	St
1.5.7	Any guidence on this matter ?	Ques
1.5.8	Thanks , caktus	St
1.6.1	That was a problem about this version of Tweakui .	St
1.6.2	Once you read how to install TWEAKUI , proceed to the panel that allows you to show/hide drive letters and make sure all are allowed .	St
1.6.3	TWEAKUI installs by a right-click on the .INF and then selecting install .	St
1.6.4	Maybe you tried that , but did n't write you did .	St
1.6.5	Always elaborate as much as possible .	St

1.8.3	I see TWEAKUI has alot of little goodies .	St
1.8.4	It appears now I can sometimes tweak w/o being afraid of the messing up the registry .	St
1.8.5	Thanks for your help .	Polite
