1.1.1	My configuration: PSU: 400W CPU: Intel Celeron 1.7GHz (256kB cache) MB: Asus P4P800-X RAM: 256MB Kingston 333MHz PC2700 DDR HDDs: Maxtor 40GB + 80GB 2.700rpm VGA: Asus Nvidia N6600 256MB VRAM In the last two years I've got a really hard time playing videogames, even if I changed the video card one year ago.	St
1.1.2	Currently, I'm short of cash, so I can't change my PC, but if I start saving now, for jan/feb probably I'll have the money to buy a new PC.	St
1.1.3	But since I'm an impatient person, I'm considering upgrading as an alternative to replacing.	St
1.1.4	I'll like to know your opinion about this: Will replacing my Celeron with a P4 3/3.2GHz HT and putting two DDR 400MHz modules (in dual channel configuration) allow me to play decently for the next couple of years?	St
1.1.5	How much memory do you think I'll need?	St
1.1.6	(I plan to buy used stuff in case of an upgrade) I'm not interested in playing at the maximum detail level, I simply want a stable frame rate.	St
1.1.7	Looking forward to your opinions, thx!	St
1.2.1	http://www.viperlair.com/articles/archive/benchmark/index.shtml Specifically this graph -&gt; http://www.viperlair.com/images/articles/archive/benchmark/ss1600na.gif Notice that the FPS swings widely about?	St
1.2.2	I've yet to find any setup that offers &quot;stable&quot; frame rates.	St
1.2.3	Yes, a P4 would be nice as well as 512MB RAM.	St
1.2.4	Your choice here.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well, that's true.	St
1.3.2	But my current setup goes near to a stable frame rate!	St
1.3.3	:P But unfortunately that rate doesn't allow to play games decently!	St
1.4.1	First off, research what your system can support.	St
1.4.2	if it can support the new 3.2ghz cpu and what newer ram, then go for it.	St
1.4.3	But, lets be practical, you need at least 1gb of ram and the cpu HSF *MUST* be able to properly cool itself.	St
1.4.4	If you buy some other fan setup, make sure its rated for that cpu or better.	St
1.4.5	On top of all this, the whole system has to be well cooled and air circultaion is the key for that.	St
1.4.6	The better the airflow through the case from frt-&gt;back makes for a cooler system.	St
1.4.7	Once all that is done, then find what is the most stable frame rate and all that.	St
1.4.8	You are pushing the system to the max.	St
1.4.9	when you want higher game levels as *ALL* of the system is stressed out to deliver the goods on a constant hi-level output so *ANY WEAK LINK* of the system will bring it to its knees if not addressed.	St
1.4.10	In other words all compoments should be of the best vendor/make and not something just to get you there but keep you there at sustained levels.	St
1.4.11	The good stuff.	Polite
1.4.12	Also, remember what games can be played now could easily be outstripped by newer games as they &quot;demand&quot; more from a system, which is pretty much what I think you're facing now and the upgardes continue.	St
1.4.13	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	but the cpu & ram upgrade would definitely help A LOT!	St
1.5.2	stick with ddr-333 since double the ram will help much more than a speed bump.	St
1.6.1	No game in particular, almost every game I tried had a very low and unstable frame rate.	St
1.6.2	I tried Far Cry, Warcraft 3, UT 2004, World Of Warcraft, Battlefiel Vietnam, are the first names which comes to my mind... Do you think that simply doubling the memory would be enough.	St
1.6.3	I think 512MB are not enough to play modern games...	St
1.7.1	I must admit I didn't consider your point of view of the problem.	St
1.7.2	Do you think that if I change CPU and memory I might have serious issues with cooling or the power supply?	St
1.7.3	(I won't change my mobo, so the top CPU I can afford to install is a P4 for a 478 socket)	St
1.8.1	Unless the case is stuffed full with 4 hard disks, 2 CD/DVD drives, max RAM and more.	St
1.8.2	The P4 3GHz HT tops out at about 100 Watts Max (much less really) so it is unlikely you'll tax that supply too hard.	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	A higher Ghz cpu will generate more heat.	St
1.9.2	If you don't buy the &quot;OEM cpu kit&quot; that Intel provides, you need to select some fan setup to match what the cpu in order to be best cooled.	St
1.9.3	If you get the kit, the fan is already provided and top of that you get a better warranty period.	St
1.9.4	Adding more ram will cause again more heat to build with multiple ram modules.	St
1.9.5	It may not be too great but it si never-the-less something else that has to taken care of.	St
1.9.6	Generally, if you cool the case overall well, all those componets(ALL) will be treated the same.	St
1.9.7	Cooling is such a typical problem but an extra fan or two usually handles the extra heat.	St
1.9.8	But at the same time, some users complain about the noise level of extra fans.	St
1.9.9	Again, quality matters, so a well made fan and a larger one helps in this regard.	St
1.9.10	Once you change something in the system, a chain effect takes place, so consider what any upgrade does.	St
1.9.11	For more info, check with any &quot;modding websites&quot;, just google for them and read the reviews, tips, hints or posts offered.	Sug
1.9.12	tada -----Willy	St
