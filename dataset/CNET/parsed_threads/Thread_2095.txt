<s> Is there a security appliance available that provides anti-malware protection, firewall, content filtering, etc, AND has no subscription or maintainance fee (or optional fees)? </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> There are a lot that you can run on the PC itself but once you get to wanting to run them on a router/appliance everyone wants money. </s>
<s> If you are not looking for a business grade solution what works is to take a router that you can load the user written firmware like tomato on. </s>
<s> You can then force the DNS server to use OPENDNS site. </s>
<s> This site has a free content filter...mostly. </s>
<s> Their are many firewall and IDP options in the user firmware releases. </s>
<s> Of course this does not stop someone who knows how host files work. </s>
