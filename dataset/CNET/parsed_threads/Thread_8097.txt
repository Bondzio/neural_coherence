<s> Does anyone know if it is necessary to press the power button on the Samsung SyncMaster PX2370 monitor, to COMPLETELY shut it off? </s>
<s> If I power down my PC, the monitor goes off/dark on its own. </s>
<s> When I restart the PC, the monitor comes on without touching the power button. </s>
<s> If I shut off the PX2370 BEFORE I shut off the PC, the PX2370 won't come on again the next time I restart- I have to push the power button. </s>
<s> The power switch at the bottom of the screen is the touch sensitive type. </s>
<s> Is the power completely off or is it using power in the first example? </s>
<s> I could find nothing in the manual about this topic. </s>
<s> Thanks for any info! </s>
<s> The VGA connection might let the monitor sleep. </s>
<s> If the monitor turns on when you start the pc then I'll take a guess the monitor is in some sort of standby mode. </s>
<s> Power usage......about a1/2w. </s>
<s> If you want zero power usage......push the off switch. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info R.Proffitt and bob b! </s>
