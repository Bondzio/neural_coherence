i figured out a bit more about my problem.
it almost has to be a problem stemming from a large electrical storm that happened yesterday, which i'm certain damaged my previous router, which i've since replaced with a new wnr2000.
the old router and surge protector is gone, but i still cannot connect via wired or wireless.
perhaps this sheds more light on the problem.
