systems using PC Chips mobos.
They didn't beep.
The case that I used supplied a little device that was the speaker.
It had the four pin connectors with two wires.
The mobo shows a function for three of the four mobo pins [Vcc, common, and signal] I tried all combinations with two wires.
Wasn't smart enough to try it without video to see if it beeped then.
Seems that the Beep would be a BIOS function.
So pull your video card out and see if you get lots of beeps [and let us know.
LOL]
