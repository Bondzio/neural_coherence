I'm planning on buying a desktop because I'm useless at the whole building thing and I REALLY want a pretty good gaming rig but don't want to spend a rediculous amount of money on it... no more than $3000-$5000... $3000 is better so i still have electricity to run it. suggestions for companies, configurations, and/or specs are greatly appreciated. **at least 3.0 GHz procesor and a good amount of HD space are ideal.

Today you can pop in a nice 2.0GHz Core 2 Duo and that CPU will fly past the old P4. I strongly suggest some reading over at tomshardware.com and then consider cloning something there if you like it.

2126	2	247264	2484365	2484153	novicebuilder	5/11/07 2:36 PM	1.17889416E12	hey there. welcome to the club	hey buddy. let me start off by saying &quot;DON'T BUY IT. BUILD IT !!!&quot; (are u still reading !!) Here's why: 1) You'll get the exact configuration you want for your needs 2) It's probably gonna be cheaper than pre-built PCs 3) It'll be easier to upgrade in the future since you know EXACTLY what you put in there and what it is compatible with 4) There is a ton of information and resources available on the web to instruct you on how to do it. You don't need to be a computer engineer or a technician. You just have to follow a logical sequence of steps. 5) It is EASY and FUN !!! youtube.com videos and computer.howstuffworks.com have tons of info on building a PC. here's a good page that explains the basic steps (once you read this, you'll change your mind and then look for more detailed info) : http://computer.howstuffworks.com/build-a-computer.htm Note that I'm new to system building too. 3 months ago, the very thought of building a PC sent shivers down my spine. But I have done a lot of research over the past few months about comp parts and technologies. Now, I am armed with so much information that I'd feel stupid buying a pre-built PC. Assuming that you will consider my advice and think about building your PC, here's some relevant info: NOTE - i'm planning to build a high-end machine for gaming, just like you are, so I think that you might find my few cents on this helpful. First let's start with the &quot;Where to buy&quot; - Undoubtedly, newegg.com. Overwhelming variety of computer parts and accessories, and from the reviews i've read, great cust. service and super-fast shipping. Motherboard - I have read that ASUS and EVGA are good. - Processor: You probably want Intel Core 2 Duo or Core 2 Extreme (Extreme is available in Dual and Quad core) - RAM: about 4 GB DDR2 800 Dual channel (Patriot, Corsair, or G-Skill brand) - Hard drives: Seagate 7200.10 SATA drives how much ever space u need. (these have become pretty cheap) - Graphics: EVGA 8800 GTX 768 MB PCI-E x16 graphics card. - A good Power supply unit (probably &gt; 700W power output) - A good case that has room for all this and whatever else you need. These are the most important components. The rest are relatively trivial - optical drives (DVD burners, card readers, etc) Finally, I want to include the specs I've decided on for my computer, which will be an all-in-one work/gaming/home-theater system: You can use this as an example or a guide. You probably want something similar. Please read and look these up on newegg.com. I hope you'll change your mind after reading this. Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit OS on the following hardware: - Intel Core 2 Extreme QX 6800 2.93 Ghz 1066 Mhz processor - ASUS P5N32-E SLI nForce 680i SLI ATX Motherboard - NZXT Zero ATX Full Tower case w/ 7 x 120 mm fans, 1 x 80 mm fan, 7 expansion slots, 6 internal 3.5&quot;, 5 external 5.25&quot;, 2 external 3.5&quot; - Patriot PDC24G6400ELK 8GB (4 x 2GB) DDR2 800 Dual Channel RAM 5-5-5-12 EPP Ready - Thermaltake ATX12V 1000W Power supply w/ SLI support, Active PFC - EVGA 8800 Ultra 768MB graphics card - Creative Soundblaster X-fi Fatal1ty FPS sound card - Dell UltraSharp 2407WFP 1920x1200 Widescreen monitor DVI/VGA/S-Video/Component inputs 6ms 1000:1 - Creative GigaWorks S750 700W 7.1 speakers - ATI 100-715331 TV Wonder 650 HDTV Tuner/PVR PCI card - Seagate Barracuda HDD SATA 7200.10 ST3500630AS 500GB 16MB Cache - Seagate Barracuda HDD SATA 7200.10 ST3250620AS 250GB 16MB Cache (no RAID) - 2 Samsung SATA SH-S183L Lightscribe DVD burners - Logitech G15 gaming keyboard w/ Programmable G-keys and LCD display - Logitech G5 Laser gaming mouse with adjustable weight Total cost: about $4500 but you can remove or change what you don't need and cut it down to maybe 3500 or 4000.

2126	6	247264	2484468	2484418	novicebuilder	5/11/07 5:42 PM	1.17890532E12	now we're talkin !	hey man. first of all, if you know all your parts well and know the basic steps, I don't see the hardware part of the installation taking more than 2 hours. The software part really depends on how many cards and other devices you have in there. First there is the OS - that's about maybe 30 minutes. Then there's the drivers for each of your devices (they will most probably come with driver CDs) Lastly, you might have to change a few BIOS settings like RAM timing, voltage, etc, depending on your hardware. But none of this is rocket science. Regarding tech support, well no one's gonna come to your house to fix anything for free(unless you have a techie friend, or pay GeekSquad), but each manufacturer has its own tech support and online forums. In most cases when something fails to work, they'll send you a replacement if it's still under warranty. Unless you physically damage something yourself, you're covered. This is the only partial downside to building it yourself. Newegg is very good when it comes to RMA (returned merchandise auth) so don't stress out too much about this part. Now, coming to the case: In order to figure out if it'll hold everything you need, you just need to have a checklist of all your components and go about checking each component against the case and marking them off one by one. Here are some things you should know: - Internal CD/DVD/Blu Ray Burners (a.k.a. optical drives) require External 5.25&quot; drive bays - Internal Floppy drives require External 3.5&quot; drive bays - Most Internal media card readers also require 3.5&quot; bays (but maybe 5.25&quot;) - Internal Hard drives require Internal 3.5&quot; bays or racks. The 7 expansion slots refer to either PCI or PCI-express slots on the Motherboard which will hold your graphics card, sound card, network card, Tv tuner or similar cards. Just add up the number of slots for these also. My specs require 2 PCI and 1 PCI-Express slots (1 PCI sound card, 1 PCI TV Tuner, and 1 PCI-Express graphics card) So for each of these components, just add up the total number of drive bays/racks they need. For example, I have (in my specs) 2 Seagate SATA Hard drives and 2 Optical drives (DVD burners). This means I need 2 Internal 3.5&quot; bays and 2 External 5.25&quot; bays. If I put a Floppy drive in, I will also need an External 3.5&quot; bay. Make sense ? Yes, the case you selected is a good case, and should fit everything I listed. The only thing that I'm not 100% sure about is the EVGA 8800 GTX card because it is 10.5 inches in length. Read reviews about the case and find out if anyone was able (or not able) to put the 8800 GTX card in. I think this case has enough fans already, but if you feel it's getting hot in there, you can always put more fans in later. ATX refers to the form factor (size) of the motherboard. If your motherboard is ATX (which it most probably will be), you're fine. I hope all this makes sense. Feel free to ask more questions if you happen to have any. ciao

Everything that is offered to you here is going to be IA32/x86 chip or AMD64/x86_64 chip. (Intel was cloned by AMD and later Intel cloned AMD's 64 bit system. There is very little the manufacturer has to do with the processor type.) What operating system are you going to use? This will tell you the amount of RAM you need. Minix3 and Plan9 can be run on 32 megabytes of RAM, sometimes even 16. The more processes that are running, the more memory that you will need. A cluttered desktop and multiple programs running- which are not actively nor passively being used- is wasting valuable memory. How much control do you have over the way the system runs? Your hardware has to be compatible. Are you planning on home use, gaming, SOHO, server, pbx, file server, or web server? It is important that only the drivers you need are loaded into the kernel to prevent bloating. If you cannot find the driver, one can be written or modified. How much disk space and what is the layout? RAID may be a safe idea if you have a home office or a file server. Do you have a lot of traffic coming in and out, such as clients? Are you going to run through ethernet, firewire, or usb for this? Will you have a graphical or non graphical environment? All of these are important questions that you should ask. You don't buy a &quot;Dell&quot; or &quot;Gateway&quot; or &quot;Mac&quot; computer. The architectures are the same. Apple has switched over to the IA32 and AMD64 architectures. You buy- and I repeat this- an x86 or AMD 64. And what if it is duo core? here. duo core means two processors. If each processor is 32bit then your system is really 32 bit. If each processor is 64bit then your system is 64bit. Some of the older SPARC based workstations had two chips in it. Never ask anyone that has only used one architecture to suggest a computer to you. And never ask anyone who has only used one operating system. A brand name is not important if you know what you are doing.

2126	9	247264	2486409	2485799	welrdelr	5/14/07 1:29 AM	1.17910614E12	yes	I use Linux and FreeBSD which is a UNIX variant. I also use Minix and Plan9, both are UNIX variants also. Again, no manufacturer makes Windows, they install it. I only know of IBM, Sun, and HP as being both manufacturers and devlopers of software systems; and, even then, the machines have to have the system installed. The article points to Linux using this feature since 2000.The feature is not new.
