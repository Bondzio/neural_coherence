<s> Hello everybody, need your help to find a good solution to my problem (i have already found some bad ones) Lets start with basics: I have a MSI Z77A-GD65 motherboard On this i have 2x Sata and 4x Sata3 (and two i cant seem to be able to use?) </s>
<s> I have one 120G SSD for OS and most programs, DVD, 2 HDD for media and 2 HDD in Raid 1 for safe storage. </s>
<s> So i run BIOS in Raid as this is the way as i know it to handle the Raid 1 setup. </s>
<s> I only use one PCI express slots for my GEFORCE GTX 670 at the moment. </s>
<s> Problem: BF4 is coming to town and i only have 17G free on my SSD. </s>
<s> I really want to have theses games on a SSD as i have latency in games and when its loading a new game. </s>
<s> My plan is to get a new 250G SSD to have all games and SW and only keep the OS (more or less) on the old SSD. </s>
<s> The problem is that i have no more Free Sata slots!!! </s>
<s> Solution: I have looked at several controller cards as that seems to be a possible way to go, if possible a Sata6 version. </s>
<s> But as i have understood now it might not be possible to get any speed from this controllers? </s>
<s> Example Asus U3S6 Have also read something about not being able to use BIOS in RAID mode when using this cards? </s>
<s> how do i setup my Raid 1 in that case. </s>
<s> Hope you can come up with some suitable solutions for me (without replacing the MB) /Joshen </s>
<s> HDDs with more disk space ? </s>

<s> You could buy an expansion card with a SATA port and connect your DVD drive to that. </s>
<s> That frees up one mobo SATA port. </s>
<s> You could also buy an SSD big enough to hold both your OS and games. </s>
<s> That frees up another SATA port. </s>
<s> Since you have your OS and games on an SSD, what are you using RAID for? </s>
<s> Backup? </s>
<s> If so, get hold of a good 3rd party backup program like Easeus Todo Backup Free which you can download from http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm . </s>
<s> You can set it up to do automatic backups at the time and frequency of your choice. </s>
<s> Then you could back up to an external hard drive, freeing up at least one more SATA port. </s>
<s> There've been a lot of posts on the 'net about why RAID is problem prone, so avoiding it is a good idea in any event. </s>
<s> ` Good luck. </s>
<s> Yes, the raid is for backup. </s>
<s> Have two additional external backups of witch one is off site as well (Photos (150Gb), documents and other important stuff) I have been thinking about only having one of them internally and making a mirror to the external one every night instead. </s>
<s> (and this would let me change one of them to something quieter as well, not a completely bad solution) I'm getting a new 250Gb SSD so yes, keeping that one as an external &quot;extra&quot; unit is one way to do it as i have an empty USB3 external case lying around. </s>
<s> That would be a fast one, but not that large The other HDD are 2 and 3TB so replacing them with something bigger is not much of an idea. </s>
<s> Connecting the DVD to the extension card have been on my mind as that is the one i use the least (but i use it every other week ) So far moving one of them externally and giving up the Raid is looking like the best way to go. </s>
<s> I think i will need to make a check of the raided HDD to check the helth of them. </s>
<s> Can any of you recommend a good program to do that, i haven't had a lot of good results with that previously. </s>
<s> (i have a HDD on my desk that i have replaced get the OK from the check programs but sounds like a grinder from time to time) </s>
<s> something bigger is not much of an idea&quot;...it was a good, logical idea considering you made no mention of the existing disk sizes. </s>

<s> You can run chkdsk and let it identify and attempt repair of any bad sectors. </s>
<s> You can also download disk diagnostics from Western Digital and Seagate. </s>
<s> There is a Windows 7 Control Panel tool called Performance Information and Tools which will check a lot of things including your hard drive's SMART data and disk performance information. </s>
<s> There is a Windows 7 Control Panel tool called Performance Information and Tools which will check a lot of things including your hard drive's SMART data Perhaps I'm blind but where on that screen do you see Smart data? </s>
<s> Click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Performance Information and Tools -&gt; Advanced Tools -&gt; Generate a System Health Report. </s>
<s> It will take 60 seconds to collect the data, then another minute to generate a report. </s>
<s> Then look in the Basic System Tests and click the + next to Disks, and voila there it is. </s>
<s> Then below there you can click the little down arrow to the far right of where it says Disks and again where it says Disk Totals and Physical Disks there's a bunch more info. </s>
<s> No doubt it is a bit cryptic to get to it, but persistence pays. </s>
<s> It is a bit cryptic to get 'there' and when you do finally get 'there' it does not tell you much. </s>
<s> I think I'll stick with this tool. </s>
<s> http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/disk_smart_view.html Seems a bit quicker and easier to use. </s>
