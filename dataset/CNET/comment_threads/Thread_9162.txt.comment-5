alright the largest performance boost you can give to a computer in a single part is the graphics card upgrading your memory would be very smart (XP decreased your performance over ME...sorry bud) i would suggest getting your memory up from 128MB to at least 256MB, if it will support 512MB (or even 1024MB) go for that if the best you can do is 384MB, still do it if the best you can do is 256MB, still do it 1GB is currently what most gaming PC's (Any credible gaming PC that is) use, or super fast 512MB RAM (but that is usually more common in overclocker machines) i would suggest the memory upgrade and the next step is graphics as for 5400RPM to 7200RPM it's pointless to worry about it, as it doesn't really improve performance 5400RPM is fast enough for average use and even light gaming a 7200RPM is what you want if your getting a new disk, but if you have a 5400RPM, just leave it now if it's a 4200RPM or slower, i'd consider an upgrade (mainly because 90% of disks that are 4200RPM are 10GB or smaller)
