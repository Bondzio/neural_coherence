well yes and no.
you could get a second internal hd, with your system 120gb would be as big as you should go.
move your pictures and music to the new hd.
umm, maybe a bigger psu.
your usb is only 1.1 so sending to an external hd would take a while to do.
i assume that you have the istall cd for xp, you can get cpu mb combos from fry's and tirgerdirect for $70~100.
new psu for $40~50.
512mb of memory $40 after rebate.
even a new video card $50.
all of this would be $200~250 and be 4 times faster than your current pc.
