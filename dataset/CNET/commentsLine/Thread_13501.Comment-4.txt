hello i am having the same problem with my mp3 player - it is a small usb hitachi &quot;ebay&quot; purchase.
it worked fine for 6 months and i can copy files from it to the pc but nothing from the pc to it.
i recently installed itunes for my wife and wondered if this had anything to do with it?
any help out there appreciated
