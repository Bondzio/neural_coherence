i've had to go with the flow about what a router is.
if i were to take my 1970's networking (yes we had networks back then) i would not be able to talk to today's owners as i would be constantly correcting them that a linksys wifi router is not a &quot;router&quot; but has many networking components inside that enclosure.
you've found the right 2009 definition and i think you should go with that and finish your definitions today.
