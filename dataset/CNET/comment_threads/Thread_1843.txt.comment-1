i really know nothing about the &quot;mechanics&quot; of my computer, it is about 5 years old, and does need updating but still works fast enough for browsing the internet.
the other day when i went to turn it on, there were sparks and smoke came out of the tower, where the fan is on the back.
i opened it up to see if i could tell what got fried.
i can only tell that the box inside that houses the faN, on -off switch and where i plug the tower into the wall, smells heavily like the smoke.
nothing else &quot;looks&quot; damaged.
is this power box replacable?can it be changed out?
?it seems like it would be faily easy to unscrew it from the tower and put a new one in , but my computer is custom built, the company that made it is out of buisness now.
i just dont know if its worth it to take it to someone for 100 bucks an hour if im going to need a whole new computer anyway.
obviously there are things on the hard drive id like to get off, and pictures.. i just wanted some help deciding whats best to do.
