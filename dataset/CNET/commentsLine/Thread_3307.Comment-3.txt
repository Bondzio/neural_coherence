i also had the same concern with my hp pavillion a 6500f not too long ago, and i decided it was time to get a replacement for my hd.
i bought a western digital re3 wd5002abys-01b1b0 from here it has been working wonders for me!
its a similar spec as the samsung, but personally think wd is more reliable than samsung's in the hd market.
