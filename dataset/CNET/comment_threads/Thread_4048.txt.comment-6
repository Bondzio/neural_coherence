This is where you need to have RAM..
I would hope you have at least 512 MB's of RAM.. ..
When you do your START-UP..do not connect the HDD/ Just start the LAPTOP..let it reach its Desktop/ RUN DSKCLEANUP..and Defragmentor../ .. Now Plug the USB in.. ..
If that doesn't work..I would check my PIN-assignments.. be sure the HDD is useing CABLE-Select[CS].. which means you need to OPEN the External Enclosure.. and view the rear of the DRIVE for the PIN-assignments.. .. You may want to visit the SEAGATE website..... and read some INFO on your Drive.
