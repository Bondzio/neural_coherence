1.1.1	Can anyone provide some information on wireless cable modems ?	Ques
1.1.2	Do they eliminate the need for a wireless router between the modem and the computer ?	Ques
1.1.3	Any recommendations on a model .	St
1.1.4	I 've seen different reports on Motorola 's SBG900 and SBG1000 .	St
1.1.5	I need to hook up my existing modem via USB rather than Ethernet .	St
1.1.6	Is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router .	St
1.1.7	Thanks Steve Rehmann	St
1.2.1	is a USB connected modem , then you may want to change to the combo if it offers an ethernet interface rather then trying to add a stand only router .	St
1.2.2	The built in router if a & quot ; G & quot ; type will run at close to 54mbps .	St
1.2.3	Add a wireless & quot ; B & quot ; device and the speeds drop to 11mbps .	St
1.2.4	Not having to run CAT5 cable is the main advantage in going 802.11x .	St
1.2.5	& quot ; Is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router. & quot ; I would think not .	St
1.3.1	Michael : Thanks for the response .	St
1.3.2	Let me see if I follow .	St
1.3.3	I am stuck with the USB connection to my desktop .	St
1.3.4	I had ethernet for quite a while and it suddenly stopped working .	St
1.3.5	My ISP ( Mediacom ) and I troubleshot .	St
1.3.6	We ended up trying different ethernet cards , different cables , different modems and different PCI slots to no avail .	St
1.3.7	When we switched to the USB it connected right away .	St
1.3.8	I am not disapointed with the speed or performance .	St
1.3.9	I would guess there is a setting or failure of some type at the computer as I can get the signal to the modem but not to the computer on the ethernet side .	St
1.3.10	Are you saying that a wireless cable modem & quot ; combo & quot ; would be a route to go if it has an ethernet side for a laptop .	St
1.3.11	I am looking at a Motorola SBG900 wireless modem .	St
1.3.12	It says it has a 802.11g wireless access point .	St
1.3.13	My thoughts were that I could keep the desktop cabled to the modem as it has a USB connection on the rear .	St
1.3.14	I thought that would eliminate the need for a wireless USB adaptor between the desktop and modem .	St
1.3.15	I would then add the notebook as a wireless connection to the ethernet side of the modem .	St
1.3.16	I 'd end up with a physical cable connection from the modem to the desktop ( USB ) and a wireless connection from the laptop to the modem ( ethernet ? ? )	Ques
1.3.17	Am I on the right track .	St
1.3.18	Steve Rehmann	St
1.4.1	would work with your laptop ( if your laptop has a wireless adapter ) instead of a physical cable ( ethernet ) connection .	Sug
1.4.2	The troublesome statement is : & quot ; I had ethernet for quite a while and it suddenly stopped working .	St
1.4.3	My ISP ( Mediacom ) and I troubleshot .	St
1.4.4	We ended up trying different ethernet cards , different cables , different modems and different PCI slots to no avail .	St
1.4.5	When we switched to the USB it connected right away. & quot ; This indicates a problem within either the computers networking hardware/software or the modem .	St
1.4.6	The prevalent cause of lost connections is some type of viral/spyware/malware infection which if not cleaned off will eventually come back to haunt you .	St
1.5.1	Michael : I regularly run Ad-aware and Spybot and often have very few items to remove .	St
1.5.2	Will also use Registry Mechanic to clean registry .	St
1.5.3	I am running XP SP2 , 512 RAM , AMD Athlon XP 1.47G .	St
1.5.4	Harware includes a Motorola SB4200 modem , logitech wireless mouse and keyboard , Xtasy 9200SE 128MB video card , Audixy SX USB sound card , Creative TV card , and a Pinnicle video capture card .	St
1.5.5	I have 5 USB ports in the rear and all are full .	St
1.5.6	2 up front are used infrequently .	St
1.5.7	2 firewire ports are on the same PCI card that has the 3 USB ports .	St
1.5.8	Ehternet card is a D-Link DFE-530TX+ So what we are running into is even though there is something wrong with the ethernet connection on the desktop I would be able to keep the wired USB connection and add a wireless laptop via ethernet through the wireless modem ? ?	Ques
1.5.9	Thanks	Polite
1.6.1	& quot ; I would be able to keep the wired USB connection and add a wireless laptop via ethernet through the wireless modem ?	Ques
1.6.2	? & quot ; You should be good to go , except for the statement that the wireless laptop will connect via ethernet .	Ques
1.6.3	The ethernet standard ( 802.3 ) is primarily used with CAT5 cabling , while a wireless connection ( 802.11 ) is just that .	St
1.6.4	PS : Try following the advice laid out here ( http : //forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php ? t=35407 ) for a more precise scan .	St
