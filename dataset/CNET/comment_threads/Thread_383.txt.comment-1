I'm trying to decide between getting a 23/24in.
widescreen (probably the dell 2405FPW) or dual 19in lcd's.
I know the picture quality should be better on the widescreen, but I can get the 19in monitors for less (although I'd want a new graphics card that had 2 digital outputs).
Any thoughts, feelings, advice or suggestions would be welcome.
