I just bought a Maxtor OneTouch 4 Plus (external harddrive) for my iBook G4.
I'm running OSX 10.4.l0, and the drive mounts fine, and I can drag files on to it and everything.
However, the one-touch feature does not seem to work.
Maxtor Manager opens, but when I click &quot;Backup Now&quot;, nothing happens.
How can I fix this?
