thats the model number.
it is currently running firmware version 1.00.6. when going to the linksys site they have 5-6 different &quot;versions&quot; of my router.
how do i know which version i have?
i tried putting a 0 in under the idle time, but must be greater than 1. i am thinking the losing of the connection must be someting to with the internet because the wireless signal usually remains at a constant 54 mbps without dropping.
