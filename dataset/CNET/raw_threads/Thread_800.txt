I need help with HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4242N Combo drive.I just got a trouble with my drive. it worked fine. then i installed PES 6 (a pc game), and my cdrom didnt work anymore. its icon hasnt appeared in my computer. I tried to uninstall PES 6, but it still didnt work. Lately, i found out that my cdrom driver was corrupted or something like that. does anyone know how to fix that problem. or where can i find the driver for my combo drive.i need to use it urgently.thanks p/s: i asked a guy about it.he said it might be cause by Starforce protection ( this game software protection) or any similar protection.but he doesnt know how to fix it.

Look up REMOVE UPPERFILTERS LOWERFILTERS on google.com and you'll find the usual XP fix. But I don't know if that's the OS in use. Also, be sure to try another drive since they die often. Bob
