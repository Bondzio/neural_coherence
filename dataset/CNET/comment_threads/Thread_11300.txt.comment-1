Just reformatted and reinstalled XP home.
Problems in original install of XP probably caused by wrong drivers for hardware.
Doing GOOGLE for CanoScan drivers for XP home, find there are at least 3 versions of &quot;LATEST&quot; drivers for CanoScan FB630U.
Hoping to avoid messing up XP again, how can I determine which of the 3 drivers I found would work best on XP home?
Thanks Ben
