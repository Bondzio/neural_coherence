If you install the video card in with your known healthy psu, you will see benefits. As for the Prem. OS, it will only provide some better OS options that has nothing to do with game play, other than DX10(if required). If you're running Vista now, then expect similar OS results. You can boost the ram beyond 2gb, IMHO would be better. For far better or intense deep info, then find a gaming forums, etc. or modding websites that provide links for same and see what they have to say. tada -----Willy

At least until the end of the year. I assume you want to play games. The 8600 isn't that great of card. I would get at least a 8800 320 card if you can. (I got one). This would have more long term use. If you get Vista Home, Then you have a nice new OS, but you wouldn't get the full experince with it. It probably would run slow anyways and you would regret doing it. I would get a 8800 320 now (you can find rebates for it all over). Get ready to build a whole new computer and then get Vista then. (Build the computer to support vista). The other guy suggested more RAM. But you could only go up to like 3.2gb total of ram with 32 bit OS. So I don't see that being worth it now.

I'd look for the 8600 online, should be able to be had for around $110-$130, other considerations, graphics card wise: Radeon HD 2600Pro Radeon HD 2600XT GeForce 8600GTS they're all in roughly the same performance arena, all DX10, the reason I bring up the Radeons is because of HIS and MSI (board vendors) putting two slot cooling solutions on those boards, while the 8600 series is generally regarded as faster (by a few % here and there) than the HD 2600 series, the HD 2600 series is available with better stock cooling, which is always a plus (and it doesnt add $20-$30 to the price like aftermarket would add to an 8600)

And for what it's worth...whatever $$ you spend on the GPU you can carry forward to a new system...not so with more RAM or better CPU. Your RIG is OK but weak for gaming because of the GPU. Go to Tomshardware.com and see what fits your need and your budget. VAPCMD
