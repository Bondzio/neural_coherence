1.1.1	As I am sure you know , part of the regular maintenance of a computer is to clean out the dust in it every so often .	St
1.1.2	I leave my desktop computer on the floor to have more room on my desk , so it accumulates lots of dust .	St
1.1.3	I was going to use my small , portable vacuum cleaner to clean my computer but was told by a friend not to use it because it may cause static or & quot ; shoot & quot ; something into the computer .	St
1.1.4	When I use the small compressed air cans , it often seems like they do n't have sufficient power to thoroughly clean my computer .	St
1.1.5	1 ) What is the best way to clean out the dust and debris in a computer ?	Ques

1.2.1	i do n't think I would ever put a vacuum into the computer , maybe parts like in the front where some dust might collect I would n't be running it over all the parts in the computer .	St
1.2.2	I do n't know what Air you are buying but all the time I have used Air it is way powerful enough to lean anything I need out of the computer .	St
1.2.3	After the Can of Air has been used for a while the presure does go down .	St
1.2.4	A Can of Air costs like $ 2.00 at Wal-Mart .	St
1.2.5	That is what I have always used .	St
1.3.1	a vac and a small brush for years ... works fine .	St
1.3.2	Do n't get & quot ; ham handed & quot ; with the vac .	St
1.3.3	I can clean most of the innards without touching anything with the vac ... just get it close .	St
1.3.4	Heatsinks/fans/stubborn stuff..use the small brush and then bring the vac close .	St
1.3.5	There may be no right or wrong way to do this .	St
1.3.6	Heck ... one forum member uses 409 and a garden hose .	St
1.4.1	I use my Campbell-Hausfeld 80 gallon compressor set at 80 pounds .	St
1.4.2	Really .	St
1.4.3	I take the case into the garage and blow it out .	St
1.4.4	Using a vacuum can cause a problem .	St
1.4.5	Air moving through the plastic hose generates static electricity .	St
1.4.6	Really .	St
1.4.7	Using plastic brushes will conduct static electricity .	St
1.4.8	Really .	St
1.4.9	Static electricity and ICs do n't mix .	St
1.4.10	Before you have a stroke , remember this .	St
1.4.11	Anything in the PC that can be damaged by compressed air does n't belong there .	St
1.4.12	Wayne There are 10 types of people who understand binary ; those that do and those that do n't .	St
1.4.13	Click here to see the CNet faces , learn a little about analog and digital data , internet connections , spyware removal , and download free software .	St
1.5.1	I suggest anyone using compressed/canned air in any form , beware of not blowing too hard ( spinning ) any fans .	St
1.5.2	The & quot ; geewiz & quot ; factor of blowing a fan into untold RPMs is n't good and can easily damage them .	St
1.5.3	Further , any jumpers need be noted in case they are blown out/off .	St
1.5.4	tada -- -- -Willy	St
