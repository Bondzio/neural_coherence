.... i want to have access to my network, specifically, my mass storage, from the internet without running through a computer... without running through a computer ?
what do you mean ?
''access''+''network''+''mass storage''+''internet''.....points to computers !
solution: setup your own mass storage network in your own compound -that means computers, high capacity storage devices, backup systems, etc., and use windows' remote access .
employ the appropriate security measures.
(did i misunderstood you ? )
