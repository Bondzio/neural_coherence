building my new pc, i have most of the parts already picked out, but i need help deciding on which ati video card would best suit me.
i have my eye on the aiw 9800 pro and the aiw x600 pro.
the 9800 has 128 mb ram and is 8x agp, and the x600 has 256 mb ram and is pci express.
how do these two compare in performance?
are the new x... line of cards comprable the the previous line?
(e.g.
: x600 = 9600?)
