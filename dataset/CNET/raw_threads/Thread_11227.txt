This card requires a 250 watt power supply but all I have is a Delta electronics micro atx 90 watt with a 124 watt max output. My question is can I damage my card without the proper wattage. If I were to upgrade to a higher wattage power supply would I notice any performance increase. I believe with a micro atx all that is available is up to 180 watt. Is this true? or could I find a 250watt micro atx power supply.

It runs, but I have experienced glitching and stuttering in games. The point is this: You likely won't damage anything by running your upgraded system with a small power supply, but you may experience glitching and crashing. Just buy a new power supply, you can get a decent one pretty cheap.
