The shielding and RF performance is different.
You don't want to know the number of times I see some complaint about a USB 2.0 device not running at full speed and the line goes silent when you ask &quot;Are you using 2.0 cables.&quot; Given that such a cable is not a premium price (note the price is $1.19 at http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=USB2-10-AB ) I'm unsure what &quot;extra&quot; price people pay for this.
Seems not much could be saved.
