<s> I've been using a Linksys wireless g broadband router, which works good depending on my location in the house, as good as one would expect. </s>
<s> I also have connected devices (PVR's) at different points in my house that are connected via the 4 ports of the router. </s>
<s> I recently came upon a spare wireless b access point, linksys as well, that I was planning to connect to the network through one of the cat 5s that was being used by a PVR. </s>
<s> Is this possible ? </s>
<s> I did try connecting it, and the signal is excellent in that area, but I do not have internet access with that connection. </s>
<s> (it's listed as a seperate possible connection point) Might it be because the 1st wireless device has WEP? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> and configure it with the same IP range.. and use it as repeater/range expander.. place it in between your main AP and your PC location. </s>
<s> But, as you said it is a B type.. so you will get the B speed (11mbps). </s>
