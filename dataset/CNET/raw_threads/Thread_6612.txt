My TV is already set up w/built-in wifi and I'd like to bring it all together somehow if possible. I came up with the following but I stand to borrow some knowledge on this subject. All help on this question is highly appreciated. My configuration: 1. Warpia Wireless USB PC to TV Audio / Video Display Adapter ($115) 2. 15 HD/New DB/15 VGA/SVGA KVM Gender Changer Adapter Male to Male M-M ($2) 3. Possibly VMware Fusion 4, (for Mac OS X) ESD ($50) Am I on the right track here? I'd like the quality to be as optimal as possible given the types of connections the Dell 2300MP offers. Any thoughts?
