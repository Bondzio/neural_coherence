<s> Hello Friends, I would like to know the difference between the preamble in Capability and Barker mode premable in ERP IE. </s>
<s> I dont know why 11g has added Barker mode preamble in ERP IE. </s>
<s> Is it redundant??? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance.. </s>

<s> The link is fine!!! </s>
<s> But.... </s>
<s> Scenario: short preamble option in capability = 1 Barker mode in ERP IE = 1 As i understand the barker mode preamble is set if currently long preamble has to be used in BSS and the short preamble option if usage of short is allowed. </s>
<s> This would mean that AP uses long preambles while sending frames and ERP STAs being able to decode the ERP IE can also start using long preambles. </s>
<s> But the question is how 11b STA already using short preamble come to know that they have to start using long preamble when the short preamble option is still 1!! </s>

<s> At the consumer level this is all done, done and done. </s>
<s> Your post doesn't reveal the problem you are trying to solve and you can use google.com to research your engineering needs. </s>
<s> Besides your first post was a bit off in reference to Barker mode and code. </s>
