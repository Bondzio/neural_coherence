<s> Hello all, I am looking for opinions from everyone, that will influence the purchase of a new computer for my grandma. </s>
<s> What we're looking for, is something along the lines of an internet appliance. </s>
<s> Ive been searching the web for weeks now (too late for a christmas present), and can only seem to find reference to discontinued models from years ago. </s>
<s> Current options i can find include the &quot;icebox&quot; the very intriguing &quot;AMD PIC&quot;, and also many of the &quot;webtv&quot; options. </s>
<s> i think the Personal internet communicator looks great, and seems absolutely perfect for the situation. </s>
<s> The icebox is &quot;cool&quot; however, rather expensive. </s>
<s> Were looking for anything that will do the trick... simply internet/email surfing, with the optional abilities of viewing digital photos, and possibly playing back videos. </s>
<s> Additional features such as USB ports for optional CD ROM drives or, flash card readers would be nice as well. </s>
<s> Overall, im just looking for some direction towards the newer models out there, as well as purchasing information, and peoples thoughts towards them (good and BAD!). </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated, so thanks (in advance) for any and all submissions! </s>

<s> OK, since this is an internet computer, the budget range is $400-700.I'd reccomend an Emachines: http://www.e4me.com/products/products.html?prod=eMachines_T6524 This PC will go through any site concievable, or any that is meant to be viewed. </s>
<s> It is actually a little overkill. </s>
<s> The only other company that will not do too much overkill is Dell. </s>
<s> This companies gets down and dirty. </s>
<s> http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/featured_basdt?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs I'd reccomend the basic highend, it even comes with a 17&quot; monitor. </s>

<s> nah, full blown PC's are too hard to deal with. </s>
<s> we need something totally simple, stylish, compact... something different. </s>
<s> The emachine is a great deal, my girlfriend and i have one ourselves. </s>
<s> It, and any other regular PC works fine for someone who knows how to use them, however what we want to find is something that grandma can't screw up, and wont have to call tech support ((or us)) every second day, in order to use the thing. </s>
<s> There's gotta be something out there?! </s>

<s> where you can never screw up on. </s>
<s> All computers use the same parts and have the same problems. </s>
<s> Your grandma is not a child; all you need to do for a pc is to turn it on and it works. </s>
<s> Emachines and other budget desktops are the most simplest desktops out there because they don't come with high end graphics card or an other junk she[grandmother] will not need. </s>
<s> If you don't want an emachines or any other budget desktop then you are out of options. </s>
<s> MIT is soon going to roll out $100 laptops which they will distribute to children in developing nations. </s>
<s> That is as ''simple'' as you will get. </s>
<s> I know that there are't any infalable PC desktop computers out there, but what I've been interested in getting help on is something different. </s>
<s> Maybe there really isnt such a thing as a net/web appliance anymore, all references that i can find are to past models, and seemed to have been discountinued. </s>
<s> The Personal Internet Communicator, made by AMD looks perfect, im just not exactly sure where to get one (radio shack is the only place ive found them online). </s>
<s> The &quot;icebox&quot; was another interesting option as well, however, at the price i would prefer a Mac Mini. </s>
<s> All else aside, a regular PC is not what i had in mind. </s>
<s> I know ive seen basic notebook style or basic desktop contraptions before, but they now seem to be extinct. </s>
<s> Nothing more than basic internet and email software capabilities are needed, with everything else being &quot;just gravy&quot;. </s>

<s> Hi , I know what you mean. </s>
<s> I just bought a nokia 770, it's a bit small- about the same size as a PDA- but I think it's perfect for what you're talking about. </s>
<s> It's a very robust solid state machine. </s>
<s> $379 at CompUSA. </s>
<s> Check this out as well, I don't know too much about it but I think it's kind of like WebTV, wherer you use your tv to browse the inernet: http://www.msntv.com/pc/ And finally the only other thing I saw online is the pepper pad. </s>
<s> I don't know too much about it but it sounds like something you may interested in. </s>
<s> It's around $800 after rebate. </s>
<s> Here's the link: http://www.pepper.com/ Hope this helps, good luck. </s>
<s> Now I get what you were saying in your beginning post. </s>
<s> I was so confused, an icebox? </s>
<s> lol. </s>
<s> You want something that is limited in computing, something that the sole purpose is just to browse the internet. </s>
<s> I think, maybe, you could buy a regular PC and put a program that restricts access to everything BUT the internet? </s>
<s> But I do know what you mean. </s>
<s> Kind of like those PC's they have in the Times Square Help place, just for browsing the internet. </s>
<s> I think the pcs you are talking about have kind of lost their flare and are dead now...Sorry. </s>
<s> But you could maybe do something with the idea of a program restricting access. </s>
<s> I found one while searching through download.com http://www.download.com/iProtectYou/3000-2132_4-10137322.html?tag=lst-0-2 Sorry I couldn't be of more help. </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim </s>
<s> the suggestions of the second last post were great. </s>
<s> both the pepper and the nokia options are exactly what i had in mind. </s>
<s> Anything simple. </s>
<s> The pepper is a little more expensive, but has a much larger display. </s>
<s> And for the price, the nokia is incredible... if i could only test drive the ting, i would be able to know if the screen would be big enough. </s>
<s> Now that my intentions are better known, perhaps some more ideas will start flowin' in. </s>
<s> (still no comments on the PIC itself, is it actually even available??) </s>
<s> Thanks all! </s>
