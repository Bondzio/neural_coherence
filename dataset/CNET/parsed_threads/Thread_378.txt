<s> I formated, then istalled Windows Me in a computer. </s>
<s> Now I can't get the modem working. </s>
<s> It is an AMBIENT DATA FAX VOICE (md-cn5614ch). </s>
<s> I've tryed quite a few drivers already. </s>
<s> While intalling the modem a message appears, &quot;Confix has caused and error in Kernel32...&quot;. </s>
<s> I've tryed it in Windows 98se too already, and it does the same thing. </s>
<s> If I go to control panel - modems - diagnostics - select modem - more information, after a while a message appears with something like this. </s>
<s> If it is an external modem, make sure it is connected and turned on. </s>
<s> If it is an internal modem make sure the interupt port is properly set. </s>
<s> If I check the interupt port, there are on conflicts, neither can I change it. </s>
<s> Also if I check the &quot;diagnostics - more information&quot; I can hear the modem making a few short and very silent &quot;chirps&quot; (sounds). </s>
<s> Can you help me figure it out? </s>
<s> Before I expect the modem to play nice, the OS's you've listed don't install MOTHERBOARD drivers for you and I see no mention of that step. </s>
<s> Many motherboards have IRQ Routing issues that the motherboard drivers supply support for. </s>
<s> Microsoft will NOT install these for you by clicking of Windows Update or Driver Update. </s>
<s> Then you have the possibility the modem is just DOA. </s>

<s> How can I find the model no. </s>
<s> for the mother board so I can find the drivers. </s>
<s> I know it's form the Intel company. </s>
<s> Will they have all software for the motherboard for download, what are my options? </s>
<s> Many Intel boards are used in HP, Dell and other makes of machines. </s>
<s> Please follow the TIP instructions to help people help you: &quot;If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> It is a PC of hardware somebody must have picked up here and there. </s>
<s> No model number, Pentium III, 95 mb ram, about 2.2 gb hard drive. </s>
<s> Whole system seems odd. </s>
<s> Supposed to be an Alaska, but... Now only Windows Me and some drivers. </s>
<s> You could try opening the case to read model numbers off parts and boards then sharing here. </s>
<s> Why not? </s>
<s> Do you own this machine? </s>
<s> Or are you the &quot;tech of the day?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> No I don't own the machine, I try to it for my dad's friend. </s>
<s> (We don't live near real techs.) </s>
<s> I opened the machine but I can't figure out which is the model no. </s>
<s> for the mother board. </s>
<s> But I have some numbers of the mother board that might help. </s>
<s> Intel 810, Intel 82801AA, Intel 82810AA. </s>
<s> The model no. </s>
<s> of the modem is MD-CN5614CH. </s>
<s> The model no. </s>
<s> of the sound card is CT4750 or MM-CT4751. </s>
<s> Sincerely, &quot;The tech of the day&quot; </s>
<s> The Intel 82801aa can be an onboard sound chip and is paired with that 82810 as you can read in posts for people looking for drivers from http://www.google.com/search?num=20&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=82801AA&btnG=Google+Search You'll want to look for names on the motherboard or if the OS is somewhat functional try Belarc's Free Advisor and post the results here. </s>
<s> http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html At the heart of your problems is identifying the make/model of said boards. </s>
<s> Or you could just load Linux since the latest distributions seems to carry more drivers than I ever imagined. </s>
<s> I will also write that Windows ME is a poor choice for hardware you can't identify since of Windows 95, 98 and ME, Windows ME has the lowest number of natively supported hardware (ie. </s>
<s> drivers.) </s>
<s> You have to work the hardest to install that version. </s>
