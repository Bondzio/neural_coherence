difficult and time consuming to perform...and you won't do it.
Nothing I hate more than spending time looking for CDs, product keys, installing the OS, the drivers, the APPs, setting preferences and all the rest when if I backed I could have simply restored the OS and the apps in less than 15 minutes from an image.

You've got a great 64-bit CPU which when coupled with a 64-bit OS (Vista) and 64-bit APPs (soon to follow .
.
.
some 64-bit games already here I'm told)and that makes things just go faster.
