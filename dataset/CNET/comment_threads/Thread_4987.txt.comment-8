Your price is the same for server or not.
I see Vista Media Center laptops for not much over 1K so we won't have a GAMING SYSTEM but once we hit gaming systems we almost must have an unlimited budget since even the nosebleed 10K buck system still drags when you run Crysis at full glory settings.
The good thing about a drobo is it keeps the owners fingers out of the file system.
