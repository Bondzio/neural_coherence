i have purchased 5 computer systems for myself and family in the past 2 years from kevin  and have never had one single problem.
would suggest you go to resellerratings.com and look at the store reviews.
you tell kevin what you want to use system for and how much you want to spend and he will hold your hand.
he is very patient with newbies and will spend as much time as necessary for you to be satisfied.
by all means, stay away from gateway.
lots of luck.
