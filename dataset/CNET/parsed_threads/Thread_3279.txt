<s> Hi everyone I've been looking for a tv tuner card the past couple weeks and would like a little feedback on what you think or like. </s>
<s> My preference would be a internal pci card. </s>
<s> I've checked reviews and opinions at a few sites, but you either love it or hate it. </s>
<s> Theres two card in particular I've been looking at Wintv-250 and LEADTEK TV2000 XP DELUXE. </s>
<s> Pretty big difference between them ( price performance encoding ect... )I don't mind spending the money if it's good but I just don't really know? </s>
<s> One more question, DVD compatibility.They have a list at http://www.hauppauge.com/dvdplayers/ Why would there be a defference between cd-r and cd-rw media? </s>
<s> I don't understand why for example the Sony DVPs 525D will only play cd-rw DVD's and not cd-r DVD's that would burned? </s>
<s> Any comments or suggestions welcomed. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> I use the 49 dollar PCI TV Hauppauge cards. </s>
<s> I've unsure about spending more, but do make DVD and S/VCD content from recordings from that card and it's capture software. </s>
<s> My last 8X DVD Plus and Minus DVD recorder was 99 bucks so as prices go, this is cheap compared to last year. </s>
