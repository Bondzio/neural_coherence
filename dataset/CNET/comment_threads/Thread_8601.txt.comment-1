Where do you find what CPU's are compatible with an ASUS board?
I know on the ASUS website but where?
Anyway I'm just trying to find out if a Pentium D925 is compatible with an ASUS P5WD2 Premium.
I think it is but I'm not 100%.
Plus what do you think about that processor as an upgrade for that board as from a single core.
I would also like to find out what the maximum processor is that I can put in there is, within financial reason.
Of course that changes with time so I would like to find the list of all the processors that go in there so I can watch as the prices drop.
Thanks JW
