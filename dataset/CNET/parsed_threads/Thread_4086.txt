<s> Hello everybody! </s>
<s> I thought I would be moving on up after I bought an Asus P4S533-MX motherboard with a Pentium 4 1.7 GHZ processor and 512 MB PC2100 DDR RAM on an auction website, but instead I am moving on down. </s>
<s> lol I installed it in my computer case and it worked great for a week. </s>
<s> I was running Vista on it and everything was going well until it started giving me errors and the blue screen of death and it kept restarting. </s>
<s> Then I thought maybe the operating system isn't agreeing with the motherboard or some hardware connected to my motherboard so I took out my old Windows XP cd and tried installing that. </s>
<s> As it was installing, that is when an error occurred and it would restart my computer. </s>
<s> Then I thought maybe my hard drive is going bad, but it wasn't going bad when I put my old motherboard back in. </s>
<s> Now I think I have a memory problem. </s>
<s> I can't pinpoint if there's a problem with the 512 MB PC2100 DDR RAM or a problem with the memory slots. </s>
<s> My motherboard can take both DDR or SDRAM. </s>
<s> I took out the DDR and put some working SDRAM in. </s>
<s> I turned on my computer and it kept beeping at me. </s>
<s> Nothing was showing up on my monitor screen. </s>
<s> Do you think I need to set something in the bios or on the motherboard to make it realize I am using SDRAM or do you think I have a memory slot problem? </s>
<s> When I put the DDR back in, it starts up perfectly. </s>
<s> I took the bios off of quick boot and it ran a test ont he meory and it said that the memory failed. </s>
<s> So now I think I have bad DDR RAM. </s>
<s> So how can I get this motherboard to see my good SDRAM? </s>
<s> If you all think my memory slots have gone capooey, do you all think I should get another motherboard or is there a way of saving this motherboard? </s>
<s> I almost forgot to tell you that I have the latest bios for this motherboard. </s>
<s> It is 1006. </s>
<s> I can't wait to see what solutions you have for me. </s>
<s> Thank you for reading this! </s>
<s> I had many jumpers to move. </s>
<s> It was not automatic. </s>
<s> Time to read the motherboard manual. </s>
<s> I found out that I have a jumperfree motherboard so there's no way of setting a jumper on my motherboard to recognize the sdram. </s>
<s> I ran across something as I was googling. </s>
<s> A person was told by an Asus vendor that the sdram controllers on this motherboard aren't stable. </s>
<s> I have a feeling there's no way of making them stable. </s>
<s> I think I'll be buying a new motherboard. </s>
<s> I often run into this but it's very rare. </s>
<s> Most &quot;bum&quot; boards are blown out of the market fast so you don't find them at newegg.com or such. </s>
