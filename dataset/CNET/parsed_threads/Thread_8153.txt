<s> A friend of mine, has been checking out my HP Compaq and he says that my hard drive is fried. </s>
<s> He took my hard drive out and exchanged it for another which worked fine. </s>
<s> Now it looks like I either need a new computer or a new hard drive. </s>
<s> I don't really want a new computer; I love this one. </s>
<s> But my friend says that if I get a new hard drive I will have to replace my OS with another Windows XP. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> Why can't I use my replacement disc's on a new hard drive? </s>
<s> You can replace a hard drive and install your original copy of Windows XP on the new hard drive. </s>
<s> All you need is the original Windows XP installation disk (or system restore disks from the computer mfg). </s>
<s> Hi, also if you have such problem appears rather often, it better to use hard drive backup software . </s>
<s> Create full image of HDD and keep it on DVD/CD or external HDD (in your case it will be very usefull). </s>
<s> And whenever you need, you could easily and fast restore system as ity was before. </s>
<s> Really recommend, I always use this way to be sure that all my important data is safe (including OS and all apps). </s>
