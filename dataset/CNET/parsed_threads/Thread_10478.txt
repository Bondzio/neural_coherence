<s> Hello, I'm not sure if anyone has ever heard of this problem, but I'll still give it a shot. </s>
<s> I will try to explain it as much as I can. </s>
<s> Say I connected to my network, but then, if I turn off the router without turning off the wireless on my laptop, and then I turn the router back on again, my laptop wont connect to the network again -- it can't even find any access points! </s>
<s> (I got two access points in my house) -- (I have to restart my laptop to fix it) But, I wont have any issues if I turn off the wireless on my laptop before turning off the router. </s>
<s> It would connect again with no problem. </s>
<s> Does anyone think it could be a service that I disabled or put on manual? </s>
<s> Any help greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank You! </s>
<s> We have a note on what to change in our forum sticky. </s>
<s> I'm sorry, but I can't seem to find anything in the sticky that may solve my issue. </s>
<s> Care to tell me which post is it? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Meanwhile, I'll keep searching for it! </s>
