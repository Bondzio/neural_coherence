<s> I'm not sure if this is a hardware or software question; I'll start here: (please read the whole thing before replying - I've already done some research, so there's a decent chance I've already tried - or can't try - the basic suggestions) I'm in the process of building a new PC. </s>
<s> Because my old one died, I'm moving the hard drive from the old one to the new one. </s>
<s> Everything else in the new PC is new, so Windows XP will properly see that the PC's &quot;signature&quot; has changed. </s>
<s> Here's the part that I screwed up: When I saw that the hard drive worked in the new PC, I got so excited that I tried to go into Windows XP. </s>
<s> I know now that it was a Really Bad Idea. </s>
<s> I saw the bootstrap (white bar across the bottom) screen, then a blue error screen flash very quickly - I couldn't read anything on it, then the PC rebooted itself. </s>
<s> My bottom line question will be: How can this Windows XP (Pro w/SP2) be saved? </s>
<s> But first, some additional info: This is NOT an OEM copy of XP, and it's not a cloned drive. </s>
<s> This is a legal copy of XP and a legal move of the drive. </s>
<s> I have the original XP installation CD (without SP2; it might be SP1). </s>
<s> The drive is a dual boot - I can successfully get into Win 98 (SE). </s>
<s> When I try now to get into XP, it tells me that the last attempt to load Windows failed (possible to due to a hardware change, which is correct), and that I should try Safe Mode. </s>
<s> Safe mode doesn't work either - same reboot issue. </s>
<s> Same thing with Last Known Good Configuration. </s>
<s> It never asks me for anything, including an activation code. </s>
<s> I think that's everything. </s>
<s> So - help! </s>
<s> TIA. </s>
