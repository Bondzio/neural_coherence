The bios settings are set to default, except gigabyte by default enables RAM &quot;turbo&quot; mode.
So I set it to off.
So everything in Bios is set to defaults, no overclocking.
I have read on several forums about cold boot issues with gigabyte boards and commonly Corsair RAM.
Like I said before, I got &quot;approved&quot; RAM coming.
Followup Question- If it were the motherboard, wouldn't it not work at all?
Can it be intermittent?
