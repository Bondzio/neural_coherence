<s> I have a Seagate FreeAgent Go. </s>
<s> Have had it since January, and initially had the default settings. </s>
<s> I made sure my pictures, music, and movie files were backed up, then deleted certain ones from my computer. </s>
<s> When trying to access a certain picture file, it isn't there. </s>
<s> The other files are, as is my music, etc. </s>
<s> If the EHD had been 'synced', is it possible since the files were no longer on my computer that the EHD deleted them as well? </s>
<s> I'm using a Sony Vaio for what it's worth. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I use SYNCBACK. </s>
<s> If we explore the settings we can have the sync software delete or add among other choices. </s>
<s> However I find many won't explore such settings for reasons I can't fathom here. </s>
<s> But Sync software usually can do that and more. </s>
<s> It's your choice as to the settings. </s>
<s> -&gt; Since it's a backup copy, nothing lost. </s>
<s> That's why we backup. </s>
