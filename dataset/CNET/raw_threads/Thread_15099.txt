If saving money and getting more for your money was your main concerns, what would be better, building your own PC from the ground up or buying a pre-configured one??? I have a good source to build one, but I don't know if I want all the hassle that goes along with that. I've had a PC built for me before by a family friend and it was just too much hassle to take it over and see if he had the time to fix it etc. But I don't want to pay huge inflated prices for a pre-config'd system either, but have any repairs be easier. The one I'm considering has a few extended warranties built into the price already. I'm not a gamer, video editor-type, just a basic surfer, who does a little business on my system.

If I price out the parts for a PC and a monitor and software I can't come close to what I can buy a package deal for. But that assumes that all the parts of a pkg deal are of any value to you. I'm not looking to buy a new machine but every so often I visit Dell's bargain shop.....nice stuff....yesterdays model....cheap. There is a benefit to building your own. You gain a certain amount of knowledge about how the parts fit together and when it does not work quite right 'you' just go in an fix it.
