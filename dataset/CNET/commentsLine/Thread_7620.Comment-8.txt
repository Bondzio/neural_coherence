question, why would you have to set 100 clients if you only have 5 computers in your network?.
i have 6 pc's in my house and i have 6 licenses assigned and i've had no problems whatsoever.
also, how are these computers (desktops) wired to the router?
are they in the same room?
if so, i wouldn't use the usb adapters, you're just asking for more things to diagnose in case you have problems.
if the pc's are all together, then simply plug them into the router directly, you'll save yourself a headache and the pc's will have a faster connection as opposed to having an up to 11mbps, you'll have up to 100mbps.
as far as the addresses are concerned, you can have any ip address you want withing a class, with a c class address being the most common one (192.168.1.1), the router won't really care what you assign the addresses to be.
try this, build a table with assigned mac addresses, so that the pc's in your network don't have problems connecting to the router.
not only will it allow only those pc's to your network but it'll give you an extra layer of security.
