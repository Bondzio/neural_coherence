<s> My neighbor had never downloaded updates to his Win XP - SP2 system. </s>
<s> On my advice, he went through the routine to let Microsoft push updates onto his system. </s>
<s> When it was all over, he not only found his system has gone remarkably slower, but also found that he had lost access to Internet using IE v6. </s>
<s> His system has a direct Internet connection to a cable modem from Optimum Online. </s>
<s> I peeked into his system and found that the typical icons for Local Networking and Wireless Networking have disappeared from the Network. </s>
<s> - Using my laptop connected directly to his cable modem, I was able to get to Internet without problems, but not using his desktop. </s>
<s> - I cannot even get IPCONFIG to release and renew and reset the IP address. </s>
<s> - There are no icons in the system toolbar on bottom right to look at the TCP/IP properties settings. </s>
<s> - I tried a system restore to a restore point prior to the update. </s>
<s> It did not help. </s>
<s> - I reinstalled the NIC card driver and even replaced with another brand new one. </s>
<s> It did not help. </s>
<s> Does any one have ideas on how to restore the networking icons and just connect with Internet? </s>
<s> I certainly do not want to format and reinstall the whole darned system all over again. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the help. </s>
<s> After checking the physical connection, try pinging the localhost or 127.0.0.1 to confirm TCP/IP is installed/configured. </s>
<s> Does it return 4 packets? </s>
<s> If not, use the reset command, netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt. </s>
<s> Try recreating the connection with the Internet Connection Wizard. </s>
<s> If there is no other way to fix the problem you could use the system restore utility included in XP to restore the computer to a point before the updates were installed. </s>
<s> A restore point should have been created when the updates were installed if it is enabled. </s>
<s> This would eliminate the need to reformat or reinstall XP. </s>
<s> Re-installing IE 6 SP1 may also be an optoin. </s>
