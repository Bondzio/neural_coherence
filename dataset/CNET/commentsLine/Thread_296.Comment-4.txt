frankzxcv: check in device manager to see if the version of the driver that is installed is the most current.
assuming that you have the latest drivers, you may want to try uninstalling from device manager, then reboot, letting xp reinstall the hardware.
i've had to do this with other hardware in the past.
somehow drivers sometimes don't install properly.
