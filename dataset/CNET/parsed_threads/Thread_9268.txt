<s> I have a Netgear WGR614v3, and ever since I've set it up, the connection drops every few hours (sometimes more than that). </s>
<s> Restarting the router does the trick, but it's a big problem. </s>
<s> I have a Comcast cable connection, and there's no problem when the modem and computer are directly connected. </s>
<s> My main computer is connected to the router via ethernet, and then about 3 or 4 of my housemates connect over the wireless. </s>
<s> I've updated the firmware, enabled WPA, broadcast the SSID. </s>
<s> Any idea what's causing the constant disconnections? </s>
<s> Is this an interference problem? </s>
<s> Something to do with IP addresses? </s>
<s> Or is Netgear just unreliable? </s>
<s> You didn't reveal that so my bet is some external 2.4GHz interference. </s>
<s> But my instinct is P2P use. </s>
<s> It's written about widely. </s>

<s> The connection problems continue even when all P2P programs are shut down (and no one else is on the network). </s>
<s> If the interference is due to a microwave or something like that, is there anything that can be done? </s>
<s> Or should I just switch to one of the different wireless bandwidths? </s>
<s> Thanks for your speedy reply! </s>
<s> After the loss, stopping the P2P program will not restore the router. </s>
<s> You have to wait 5 days! </s>
<s> I'm not kidding. </s>
<s> Read http://forums.extremeoverclocking.com/t254852.html The links at the bottom lead you to possible fixes. </s>
<s> But this is not the router to have if you use P2P. </s>
