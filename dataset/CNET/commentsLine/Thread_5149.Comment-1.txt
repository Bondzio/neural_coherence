i have accidentally lifted the lever seating my cpu while working on my pc.
i put the lever back down.
will i need to properly seat my cpu again with thermal paste or will it be ok. everything seems to be working fine but i can't help thinking it is a little slower or am i just being paranoid!?
idle core temp is 52 deg c 125f on an amd 64 3000+ with standard heatsink and fan on an msi k8n neo motherboard.
don't know what the temp was before.
sorry.
