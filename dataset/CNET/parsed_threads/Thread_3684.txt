<s> I have been doing a littel upgrading on my 2nd (older) PC. </s>
<s> I still play some games on it. </s>
<s> Already added more memory and was thinking about upgrading the video card. </s>
<s> The motherboard only has a 4X AGP slot and most cards I'm interested in are 8X. </s>
<s> If I put in an 8X will I run into any problems? </s>
<s> It's a confusing area but if the card plugs in then it's ok. Bob </s>
<s> and it's not easy to buy a 8X-AGP card now </s>
<s> newegg.com and geeks.com But I still prefer cards from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/12/03/best_graphics_card/ Keep in mind the repeating issue I see is not AGP motherboard issues but the weakling power supplies. </s>

<s> Thanks everyone! </s>
<s> I had the power supply take a crap a while back. </s>
<s> I replaced it with a 450w one. </s>
<s> As far as AGP cards. </s>
<s> I have found them all over the place. </s>
<s> As long as an 8x cards works in a 4x slot I'm good. </s>
<s> The market could not support such a card so we never found one. </s>
