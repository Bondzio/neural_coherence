I too found out that the majority of Intel and ATI adapters don't support non-standard modes.
Intel has some technical googly **** on their site about issues with hardware/firmware/software compatibility and offers a non-standard driver which won't install on most laptops, including Centrino platforms!
Why can't Intel and ATI make video products with simple user customizable driver modes like Nvidia's?
I didn't return my 1680x1050 22&quot;.
I just dumped Intel and ATI and switched to Nvidia.
