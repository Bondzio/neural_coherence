I can't get the lights to light up on the ports. Only the WAN lights come on. We have cable broadband through charter communications. The cable modem has a place for an ethernet cable and a USB cable, although the end that goes into the cable modem is more squared. I've tried everything to get this thing to work but still can't. I called the linksys support number and some lady on the other line wasn't any help. She was clearly reading off of a screen basic stuff I found on the linksys website that wasn't any help. I think their tech support is outsourced overseas. Not sure. In any event my parents told me that the router worked before when they used it. They stopped using it for awhile but now I was trying to hook it back up but to no avail. The 2 computers i'm trying to hook up are a desktop and a laptop, both running windows xp home edition. The laptop is an sp1 release.
