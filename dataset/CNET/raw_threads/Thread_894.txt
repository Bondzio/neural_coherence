Lego Star Wras runs for 30 minutes then stops with message teklling me that I need a graphics card compatible with Pixel Shader 1.1. I cannot find anything about pixel shading in the ATI help nor spot anything on the ATI Control Center. I thought my graphics card was reasonably up-to-date. Am I missing something? Details Intel Pentium 4 3.06ghz- XP Pro SP2 (Media Center 2004). 512 mbRam - 256 mb graphics card memory. Thanks in advance
