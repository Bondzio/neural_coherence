8073	0	540615	5198910	NR	Darby	9/6/11 5:36 PM	1.31533056E12	How do I replace a bad Eithernet port on Dell Inspiron 530S	The built in eithernet port on my mom's Dell Inspiron 530S is not working. It was probably damaged by a power surge. I was told that this is connected to the mother board and it would be expensive to replace the original port. Instead I was told to buy a NIC card. I purchased a PCI card which I was told is the same thing, but it was the wrong size. Apparently, I have a low profile desktop. Can someone tell me the correct part to use?
