I'm considering the Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 or the Belkin N, but I don't know if I need to spend over a hundred dollars on a router is worth it for an apartment.

I'd go with a wireless-g router from Linksys, D-Link, Netgear, etc. for under $50 and maybe under $30 if you find a special. Pre-n/MIMO routers usually aren't worth the cost for smaller spaces (apartments) that just share Internet service and the occasional file or printer. Note that every computer that needs to make a wireless connection will need a wireless adapter if it doesn't already have one. That adds to the cost.
