Wow, Grif really laid that out.
Long instruction set but I think I can recover some hard disk space by deleting some of the &quot;detritis&quot; that builds up over time.
Let me just make sure of something...based on what Grif wrote...my HistoryKill software doesn't kill all those file fragments and temp file stuff when I run it each time?
Thanks again Bob, Ken
