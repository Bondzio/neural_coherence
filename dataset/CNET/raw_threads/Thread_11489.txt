I found this on Craig's List (Yes, I know...)I am wondering if you fine people could advise me on whether or not this would be worth the $360. It's custom: AMD athlon 64x2 6000+ 3.0ghz dual core processor 2x2gb DDR2 1066mhz Ram by gskill EVGA nvidia 9500gt 512mb video card with dual monitor support 80gb 7200rpm Sata 2 3.0gbs HD LG DVD burner w silent run tech. Gigabyte Mid tower black light gloss case Antec tricool 120mm rear exhaust fan with 3 speed switch ECS 8200a motherboard with HDMI Antec smartpower power supply rated at 400w Here is where I found it: http://worcester.craigslist.org/sys/1034367509.html Any help would be greatly appreciated. Also, I was informed the graphics card is about mid-level? as far as cards go. And the psu isn't very good. I am not big time gamer, but I would like to get into it a little. Would it be worth buying this, and then buying a new graphics card/psu? I also have a 19&quot; hd monitor and 160 gb hdd that I can throw into it.

I'd like to figure out a way to build a decent enough pc within the range of... $500? That would be nice. Something that can handle good games.

13974	3	330934	2982697	2982670	incogneato	2/18/09 6:54 AM	1.23494004E12	...	thanks for the reply. I recently bought an... Emachine. Yes, garbage. Anyway, this is what I have on this pc: CPU: AMD Athlon 64 Processor 2650e 64-bit processor with AMD64 technology (1.6GHz, 512KB L2 cache) Operating System: Genuine Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition SP3 Display: eMachines 19&quot; widescreen LCD display (E19T6W) 1440 900 (native and maximum) Chipset: NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE Memory: 1024MB DDR2 (1 1024MB) Expandable to 4GB 2 DDR2 slots total, 1 DDR2 slot available Hard Drive: 160GB SATA II (7200rpm, 8MB cache)1 Optical Drives: 18x DVDR/RW SuperMulti drive featuring Labelflash technology2 Up to 8.5GB with dual-layer media Write max: 18x DVDR, 6x DVD-RW, 8x DVD+RW, 8x DVDR DL, 12x DVD-RAM, 48x CD-R, 32x CD-RW Read max: 16x DVD-ROM, 48x CD-ROM Media Reader: 14-in-1 high-speed3 Compact Flash (Type I and II), CF+ Microdrive, MultiMediaCard (MMC), MMCmobile, Reduced-Size MMC (RS-MMC), Secure Digital (SD) Card, miniSD Card, xDPicture Card, Memory Stick, Memory Stick PRO, Duo, PRO Duo Video: NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE integrated graphics Up to 128MB of shared video memory Audio: 6-channel (5.1) high-definition Communications: 56K ITU v.92-ready fax/modem (RJ-11 port) 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN (RJ-45 port) Peripherals: Standard multifunction keyboard 2-button wheel mouse (PS/2) Amplified stereo speakers (USB powered) Ports/Other: 7 - USB 2.0 (3 front, 4 rear) 1 - VGA 2 - PS/2 (keyboard and mouse) 5 - Audio (rear): center/sub, rear (stereo), line-in/side (stereo), front/headphones (stereo), microphone 2 - Audio (front): headphone (stereo), microphone 1 - RJ-45 Ethernet 1 - RJ-11 modem Dimensions: 10.7&quot; H x 4.2&quot; W x 15&quot; D As you can see, nothing but a halfway decent pc , for your average user. I'd think this would be a nice upgrade for me. But if I have to go out and spend more on a new graphics card, maybe it's not worth it? I am having such a difficult time deciding, lol. I just want to be able to play some good games.

13974	5	330934	2982803	2982697	chickenorfish	2/18/09 9:35 AM	1.2349497E12	the new comp will blow that one out of the water	the new comp will blow that one out of the water. it has a MUCH faster cpu, more ram and way better video card
