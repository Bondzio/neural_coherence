<s> I have used xp Pro for years on my Toshiba satellite 2800-600 notebook. </s>
<s> I have never had any problem too difficult for Norton System Works to resolve --- until about three weeks ago. </s>
<s> I installed Visio 2000 but it would not read a file created on Visio 2003, so I tried to install the Visio viewer. </s>
<s> I got myself tied up in knots but eventually I could read the file. </s>
<s> Just after that, I tried to back up my laptop to an external hard drive, which I have successfully done for years. </s>
<s> After pushing the backup button, the hourglass cursor appeared for about five seconds and then nothing more. </s>
<s> Backup would not load so I was not surprised to find that it did not show up in Task Manager or the task bar. </s>
<s> Everything else seemed to work fine. </s>
<s> However, at day's end when I tried to shut down my computer, a dialog box appeared advising that Backup was not responding. </s>
<s> I had to repeatedly hit 'End Now' to shut down. </s>
<s> I also find that playing music from my hard drive now launches Real Player instead of Windows Media Player. </s>
<s> I have made the latter my default player but music will only play on Real Player. </s>
<s> If I first open Windows Media Player and choose a song, the visuals all work but there is no sound. </s>
<s> I removed Visio 2000 and Visio viewer 2003 and then restored my OS to a date weeks earlier than the original Visio problems. </s>
<s> These actions have not improved my situation. </s>
<s> Media player still will not produce sound, and I cannot backup. </s>
<s> Everything else seems to be 100%. </s>
<s> Can anyone offer advice, please? </s>

<s> Look up the Microsoft Installer Cleanup Utility on google. </s>
<s> That's the only item that comes to mind given your story. </s>
<s> As to the backup button, my only comment is that hard disk based backups do tend to fail at the worse times. </s>

<s> I found out the hard way that restoring will not installl the sound drivers. </s>
<s> You have to do that separately. </s>
<s> I've done that but still don't have all my sound problems worked out. </s>
<s> Good luck to you </s>
<s> Thanks for the info, Bob. </s>
<s> I've read Microsoft's cautions about that utility and it makes me nervous. </s>
<s> By the way, my sound came back after I bought and installed Registry Mechanic. </s>
<s> It found hundreds of errors which have now all been repaired. </s>
<s> I still can't get backup to launch but at least I've got a clean registry and have sound. </s>
<s> It makes me nervous also. </s>
<s> I'll look into the Registry Mechanic to see if it can help. </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestions! </s>
