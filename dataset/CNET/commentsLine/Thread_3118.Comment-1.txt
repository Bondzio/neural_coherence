hi i'm looking for a way to set up my home networking so that i can set up a dns service to mask my ip so that i look like i'm hitting the internet from the us (i'm in canada).
basically this service gives me 2 dns entries that i enter on my router and the service is running.
however, for security reasons, i don't want my &quot;work/personal&quot; data flowing through these dns entries in case they are packet sniffing for passwords, logins etc.
would it be possible to set up 2 different routers... 1 for all my personal data to flow through and the other for the media streaming?
i have 1 router/modem (cisco dpc3825) and 2 wireless routers (trendnet tew652 and linksys e3000) at my disposal to set this up.
thank you.
