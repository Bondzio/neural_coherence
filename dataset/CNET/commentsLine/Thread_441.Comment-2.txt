&quot;her problem is that someone at the school where they were used set them up &quot;kid proof&quot;.
that is every time the system powers up it is the same.
it doesn't matter what you install or delete or any other changes that you make it always comes back the same.
as you can imagine this is somewhat frustrating to the kids as their games and scores are all gone.&quot; such freeze programs are made to be nearly impossible to remove.
so i just wipe the drive and reinstall windows.
