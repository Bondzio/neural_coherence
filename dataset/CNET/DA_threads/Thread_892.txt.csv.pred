1.2.1	The Acer Aspire One with XP, 1GB RAM, 160GB hard disk.	St

1.3.1	along with Linux.	St
1.3.2	There is enough cheap or free software out there for each platform.	St
1.4.1	Do you need an SSD drive?	St
1.5.1	I would prefer one because it won't need to be larger than 16 or 20 GB and I'm more concerned about speed and battery life.	St
1.5.2	Also, this netbook will be in my bookbag, so it may get jarred a bit.	St
1.5.3	If I have a standard HD I won't have to worry so much about scrambled data.	St
1.6.1	I do know that the HP mininote, I think the 2100 version (whichever one is for business) has a metal chassis.	St
1.7.1	The benchmarks I used found them to be much like your common horse race.	St

1.7.3	I went with the 160GB hard disk.	St

1.8.1	So far there are no netbooks that will survive abuse or riding in a backpack with 50 pounds of books crushing the laptop.	Ques
1.8.2	In your case, do not buy anything without insurance for even &quot;abuse.&quot; Bob	St
1.9.1	Well I'll be more careful with the netbook in my bag.	St
1.9.2	I just want something a tad more rugged.	St

1.9.4	http://asuseeehacks.blogspot.com/2008/02/asus-eee-pc-torture-test-french-video.html How is the keyboard on your Acer and how long do you typically use it in a session?	St
1.9.5	What about compared to a full sized keyboard?	St
1.10.1	No complaints here.	St
1.10.2	However I do use the Logitech V450 Nano mouse so I can't tell you if the mouse pad is any good.	St
