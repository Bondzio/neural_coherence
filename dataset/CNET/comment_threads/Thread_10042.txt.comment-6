Use the scheduled tasks to automate computer maintenance and software upgrades for her machine.
The casual computer user (i.e.
email, photos, mp3, websurf-casts, and solitaire) believe their machine to be slower than it used to be, or perhaps slower than the one their friend has, because it is broken or infected.
In fact, most often it needs only to have its scheduled tasks set up to self maintain the HDD, Registry, and Antivirus protocols.
