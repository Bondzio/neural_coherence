i've no practical experience with range extenders so forgive, but it occurs to me that the symptoms you describe are wireless interference.
i think it might be worth re-reading the manual on which channels the extender is best set to in relation to the router.
bear in mind that the frequencies represented by channels can interfere with each other unless separated by 5 channels.
in other words 1, 6, 11 don't interfere.
