<s> Here is my problem - periodically, not all the time, just some days, my internet connector goes down. </s>
<s> However when I click on it it still shows as connected to to local and internet and Windows does not find any problems with it when I check it. </s>
<s> I can receive and send email and even my VPN works, but I can't browse the web and cannot use Skype. </s>
<s> Is this a problem with my computer or with the ISP? </s>
<s> I have a Vista machine with Windows defender sometimes on and the bulky,clumsy McAffee antivirus that came with the computer. </s>
<s> I have adsl with a wifi set up in my house. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what could be going on? </s>
<s> I forgot to say that starting and restarting the computer and connecting and disconnecting the connection sometimes help, sometimes do not. </s>
<s> Today after numerous times doing it finally it worked. </s>
