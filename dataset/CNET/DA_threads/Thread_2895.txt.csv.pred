1.1.1	Recently because of serious system instability , I ran chkdsk to see if the problem was related to bad clusters .	St
1.1.2	Of course Chkdsk found a string of errors , reporting things such as & quot ; deleting corrupt attribute record ... & quot ; , & quot ; deleting index entry ... & quot ; , and so on .	St
1.1.3	After a long wait , the system rebooted , but I found my system even more unstable .	St
1.1.4	Later I found out through the Event Viewer that Chkdsk did 'something ' to numerous files in attempt to repair them .	St
1.1.5	Among those were Windows core system dll 's .	St
1.1.6	When I tried to look for those files , they did not exist anywhere on the hard drive .	St
1.1.7	I am afraid that maybe Chkdsk did n't do a good job repairing the flies .	St
1.1.8	Perhaps what Chkdsk did was just overwriting the bad sectors ?	Ques
1.1.9	I thought at least Chkdsk could move the file segments on that specific sector to another healthy sector to maintain file integrity .	St
1.1.10	I dare not to use Chkdsk again in the future , lest it should delete files by accident , rendering software , personal data , or even Windows useless .	St
1.1.11	My question is : should I expect Chkdsk to repair the hard drive while also maintaining data integrity ?	Ques
1.1.12	Or is there any other way to do exactly the tasks mentioned above ?	Ques
1.2.1	I 'm going to decline writing what CHKDSK does and note it wo n't repair damaged files or a damages OS .	St
1.2.2	For that the tools vary with the OS .	St
1.2.3	Sometimes it 's SFC /SCANNOW and for other OSes it 's something else .	St
1.2.4	With all the malware out there , CHKDSK is only a minor tool in the kit .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Did you run just chkdsk , or did you use chkdsk /f/r ?	Ques
1.3.2	Chkdsk by itself will only check the disk , with /f or /r , or both will move the info to good sectors .	St
1.3.3	Depending on the size of disk it may take awhile .	St
1.3.4	Also it may only happen on a reboot cause it needs exclusive rights to the drive .	St
1.3.5	SFC command will take you to original values , you will need to go to Microsoft update after the sfc was run .	St
1.3.6	Hope this helps .	St
1.4.1	Well , I manually made CHKDSK to run at bootup so that it can have so-called & quot ; exclusive access & quot ; to the harddrive .	St
1.4.2	My OS was not damaged before I ran CHKDSK ; it was just unstable ( which I later found out to be nTune 's fault ) .	St
1.4.3	But AFTER I ran CHKDSK , some core system files were gone , such as msxml3r.dll , etc .	St
1.4.4	And these files were all reported as & quot ; located in bad sector and was repaired & quot ; in CHKDSK 's log .	St
1.4.5	Even SFC /scannow did not totally recover them .	St
1.4.6	I had to copy the dll 's from my original XP cd .	St
1.4.7	What I want to know is whether it 's normal to lose data while disk utilities , such as CHKDSK , are doing their job ?	Ques
1.5.1	It 's all about backup .	St
1.5.2	But let 's tackle MSXML3 since last week I ran into that and it was annoying that REGSVR32 MSXML3.DLL fails but if you download MSXML3.MSI and install that then all is well .	St
1.5.3	Go figure why .	St
1.5.4	Here 's the MSXML3.MSI I used to correct this one .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	It might be worth trying 'system file checker ' .	St
1.6.2	You will need your XP CD handy ( or if on your harddrive as a partition it will find any files itself ) Click Start & gt ; Run & gt ; type CMD press ok .	St
1.6.3	This will bring up a Command Prompt Type in : SFC /scannow ( make sure you have a space after SFC ) Hopefully this should repair or replace any corrupt or missing system files .	St
1.6.4	Tigger	St
1.7.1	Well then I guess it 's prime time for me to make a backup of my drive .	St
1.7.2	It seems that I ca n't totally rely on CHKDSK .	St
1.7.3	Hopefully the bad sectors wo n't spread any faster .	St
1.7.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.8.1	CHKDSK is a little boy sent out to do a big man 's job .	St
1.8.2	There are several utilities that 'claim ' to do this job , but only 1 that I know really does the job .	St
1.8.3	SPINRITE from Steve Gibson http : //www.grc.com	St
1.9.1	& gt ; CHKDSK is a little boy sent out to do a big man 's job .	St
1.9.2	Actually , it 's an old man .	St
1.9.3	It 's been around since the boot-from-floppy days .	St
1.9.4	Someone mentioned the need to do a backup .	St
1.9.5	I do this twice a year ( should do it more often ) and my irreplaceable files , such as the pictures I 've taken , are additionaly backed up onto a dvd and far away in my brother 's safe .	St
1.10.1	Yes , It 's old but it 's been updated for NTFS .	St
1.10.2	And backups are nice but they can be nothing if you get bad copies .	St
1.10.3	I 've had this happen with floppies , tapes , cds and dvds .	St
1.10.4	I make 2 or 3 copies of data files and have not lost data .	St
1.10.5	( YET ! ! ! )	St
1.10.6	But I have had to use all 3 copies to recover data , some files .	St
1.11.1	well lets start off with the basics .	St
1.11.2	the hard drive is a thin mettallic layer of magnetic material .	St
1.11.3	this magnetic material is divided into clusters , pipes , sectors and all that fun jazz .	St
1.11.4	what chkdsk is checking for is imperfections in this magnetic layer , namely the clusters .	St
1.11.5	when chkdsk finds these errors on the platter ( the term for the hard drive ) it will attempt to fix these .	St
1.11.6	it will not go through your files and fix them .	St
1.12.1	'this magnetic material is divided into clusters , pipes , sectors ' Pipes ? ? ?	Ques
1.12.2	I do n't think so !	St
1.12.3	'what chkdsk is checking for is imperfections in this magnetic layer ' Again I do n't think so .	St
1.12.4	One thing it is looking for is & quot ; lost clusters & quot ; , clusters that are marked as in use but they are not .	St
1.12.5	Another thing it is looking at is the & quot ; indexes & quot ; .	St
1.12.6	I could go on but I wo n't .	St
