When we opened up her new computer I found there is a SATA harddrive installed. Is there anyway to use this IDE harddrive on her system without removing her cd drive and dvd writer? If not, can we get an external usb harddrive case for the new harddrive? We are unfamiliar with sata drives. Thanks.

You can also buy SATA to IDE adapters that plug into the IDE drive. Do a google search to find some. They adapt both the power and signal inputs. I have no experience actually using one though.
