<s> The Situation: I need to print to 640 printers on a single network. </s>
<s> I need to add these printers to my computer, and then print to them. </s>
<s> The printing should be as simultaneous as possible. </s>
<s> Doing this by hand would obviously take forever, so I am open to third party apps (cheap), vbscripts (with instruction please), command prompts, or anything else that will work. </s>
<s> I've found programs to facilitate the &quot;printing&quot; part, I really am looking for suggestions on the &quot;adding&quot;. </s>
<s> All of the printers are TCP/IP. </s>
<s> Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> You may be saving a small business! </s>

<s> Do you have a programmer on your staff? </s>
<s> Nope, I'm practically alone. </s>
<s> I have a part time assistant, and there are the ladies in the media center that boot the computers for me in the morning. </s>
<s> Can you say budget cuts? </s>
<s> other options? </s>
<s> Intelliscribe might be what you're looking for. </s>
<s> Not exactly cheap, but for a small business it might be worth looking into. </s>

<s> Intelliscribe is fine for distribution, but its adding the printers to my machine that I'm hung up on. </s>
<s> Thanks though </s>
<s> Go with what you have. </s>
<s> When faced with such limits and no staff I find the best course of action is to use what you know and have. </s>
<s> I do know there are command line methods but these will only confuse most as not only it's the command line but the setup will be taxing. </s>
