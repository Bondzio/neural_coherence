<s> My HP PSC 2410 is on it's last legs. </s>
<s> It makes grinding noises at startup. </s>
<s> I've been to the HP website, chatted with the tech on-line and I refuse to send it in for servicing. </s>
<s> Not worth the money. </s>
<s> The bottom line is I'm looking for a reliable printer. </s>
<s> I don't want an HP. </s>
<s> I no longer need the scan or fax capability. </s>
<s> Color or just B&W would be fine. </s>
<s> Suggestions welcomed.... </s>
<s> If you only need B&W output, then seriously consider a laser printer and yeah HP does good in this area. </s>
<s> There are other makes out there and just about all basic laser printers do fine. </s>
<s> If you still need color and an inkjet, then look at Canon models. </s>
<s> I would not recommend Epson or Lexmark as they're expensive to operate and when an Epson pukes, it does so expensively. </s>
<s> HP still makes a good printer look at other simpler models, maybe one that accepts similar ink carts. </s>
<s> As for a true reliable printer then also look into Okidata, more expensive but real workhorses. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> With printers often being cheaper than replacement ink cartridges it really makes you wonder..... Ive used Lexmark, Brother, Hp and Canon. </s>
<s> I think the canon is the most reliable. </s>
