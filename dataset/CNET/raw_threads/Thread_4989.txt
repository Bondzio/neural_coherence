15352	0	203452	2177287	NR	abanerji	9/4/06 2:51 AM	1.15733826E12	CD eject problem	I have a Compaq Presario Intel-P4 with 256MB-RAM. I have been using a CDwriter-***-DVD combo for several months. I recently updated to XP-SP2 and also patched my system from WinUpdate site. I also just updated Nero6-reloaded packages 1 and 3, without yahoo toolbar. My CDwriter-***-DVD combo drive is suddenly refusing to open the drive, either from pressing the hardware switch on the drive, or right-clicking the drive in MyComputer and selecting eject. I am only able to open the drive by inserting a pin in the front-hole of the drive. Is this a potential hardware issue, or some software conflict (driver, dll, etc.)? Thanks,

Uninstall INCD and delete the upperfilters, lowerfilters as noted http://support.microsoft.com/kb/270008/en-us I did not look up the article listing NERO. You can do that but the fix is the same.
