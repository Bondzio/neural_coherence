1.1.1	I 've always had Epson printers .	St
1.1.2	Generally , I like them , but ... .	St
1.1.3	They have a problem , which is actually mentioned in their manual .	St
1.1.4	You have to use them regularly , or the heads clog up !	St
1.1.5	I want good quality B & W & colour printing .	St
1.1.6	Acceptable photo printing ... . pretty much all the things any home user wants , but what I DO N'T want is to attempt to print something & find the heads are clogged because I did n't use the printer for a month or so .	St
1.1.7	I 've never seen this issue mentioned in printer reviews & was wondering if anyone has ever tested various brands for it ?	Ques
1.1.8	I would love any suggestions as to what printer i could buy that would not require me to use up trees pointlessly , just to keep it running .	Sug
1.2.1	Back when we could n't afford color printers we went to Kinko 's .	St
1.3.1	Hewlett Packard would be my choice , there are many from which to choose.If you want an all in one , the HP 6380 would be a good choice .	St
1.3.2	Good luck !	Polite
1.4.1	When you buy a new inkjet type prtr .	St
1.4.2	stay away from Epson models , they tend to clog all too soon vs. other brands .	St
1.4.3	You should look at Canon or HP models and find what suits you .	St
1.4.4	Whatever , for more $ look into a laser prtr .	St
1.4.5	there are several in the low cost area and will not be effected by clogging issues .	St
1.4.6	Provided its use is basic and general ( home use , right ) it should provide long term usage and overall be cheaper to operate , though initial cost is higher .	St
1.4.7	Even now at this time of the season , you 're bound to find great pricing on lasers .	St
1.4.8	However , if you find ink better because of cost , I did mention , laser .	St

1.4.10	is being at good pricing now , so look around .	St
1.4.11	Remember , cheap is cheap , so beware .	St

1.5.1	Thanks everyone for the advice .	Polite
1.5.2	My personal experience certainly bears out the clogging issues thing with Epsons , so I 'm thinking it 's time for a change .	St
1.5.3	I will certainly check laser prices , but as I said , I do n't print all that often .	St
