just consider that a 4 gig solid state drive, though it might be a little faster and energy efficient, isn't going to hold much data beyond the OS if you run Windows.
If the HD was the only consideration, I'd go with the 120 gb unit in a heartbeat The other hardware on the two products will be fairly comparable.
Price would be a determining factor.
I'd definitely want to pay less for the one with the smaller drive.
