you seem unsure what ide cable type you have.
i know not everyone will be experts under the hood of the pc, but shrug that off and let's go to work.
you questioned me on the color of the ide connections and that was my test and my clue that you likely have the older ide cables.
if so, the setup can torture some owners.
why not get a shiny new 80 conductor ide cable with the black, blue and gray connectors and set the drive to cs (cable select) so we know where we are?
