<s> First, you must excuse me if my terminology is not accurate. </s>
<s> I purchased a house that is wired with 16 ports. </s>
<s> I have a cable modem that sends the signal to the switch which then feeds the house and a wireless router (I believe it is router first and then switch, but not sure). </s>
<s> I would like to be able to hook up my printer to one of the ports and print remotely (from laptop, wireless) or from a desktop computer that is physically connected to one of these ports. </s>
<s> I'm not even sure where to start and I don't want to have to sift through numerous web pages and terminology I don't understand. </s>
<s> Any assistance is much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> If I had a cable modem to my switch and to the house, then not much would work proper. </s>
<s> If I wired my cable modem to the router, then router to switch to the house, then that's the common working setup. </s>
<s> I will not help people with the first setup since that's their choice and their headache. </s>
<s> I hope you understand why. </s>
<s> To place the printer on the proper network, you need a PC that shares the printer or one of Dlink/Linksys's printer sharing boxes. </s>
<s> Your choice. </s>

<s> You may network a printer through a switch. </s>
<s> Now, you mentioned your house having 16 ports. </s>
<s> I must presume you have something like a patch panel which has cabling from it to various places in the home. </s>
<s> Right or wrong? </s>
<s> A switch would be placed near the patch panel...perhaps both in a common rack. </s>
<s> The jacks of the switch would be wired to those of the panel. </s>
<s> This becomes a common network &quot;hub&quot; site. </s>
<s> In this same location you might have a cable or DSL modem. </s>
<s> It would connect to the switch through a router. </s>
<s> The router is the device that connects the &quot;WAN&quot; (wide area network) to the &quot;LAN&quot; (local area network). </s>
<s> In this case, the WAN is the Internet and the LAN is your home network. </s>
<s> A printer can be connected to the switch and be shared across the entire local area network through it. </s>
<s> To do so, you would need a print server (built in to the printer or external) that had a jack similar to those used in the switch. </s>
<s> You can also share the printer (as Bob mentioned) by connecting it physically to one PC and allowing another to access it. </s>
<s> The advantage is this is simple to set up and configure. </s>
<s> The disadvantage is that the PC hosting the printer must also be on to use it remotely. </s>
<s> A printer on a print server can be used by any PC on the network without having the computer hosting it to be turned on first. </s>
<s> If you tell which you desire to use, that would get a better answer as to how to make it work. </s>
