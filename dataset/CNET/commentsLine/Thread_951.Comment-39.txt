there are many other considerations when talking about overall speed of this or that computer system.
serial ata vs. parallel for instance.
also, the main board in your laptop is most assuredly different than your desktop, so the size of your memory buffers, chipsets, type of video card, etc.
all are speed factors.
also, you did not mention whether your desktop and laptop have the same amount of ram, another factor affecting overall speed of the system.
