1.1.1	I have a Vista PC and have attached a samsung ML-1740 ( USB ) laser printer to it .	St
1.1.2	Vista found the device , and installed drivers for it .	St
1.1.3	It completed with no errors , and Vista says it is ready for use .	St
1.1.4	When I try and print to it , it fails to print with no real specific message .	St
1.1.5	Printing a test page from control panel , simply says & quot ; Test page failed to print .	St
1.1.6	Would you like to view the troubleshooter for assistance & quot ; .	St
1.1.7	I have deleted the printer , downloaded newest samsung drivers and installed again ... still no go even though control panel says the printer is & quot ; ready & quot ; .	St
1.1.8	any suggestions would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	I find many PCs with new installs missing drivers and more .	St
1.2.2	Taking a page from the HP printer fiascoes , the usual is we have a firewall installed or a non-administrator account .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the quick response .	St
1.3.2	After I submitted the original post , I tried installing an HP deskjet printer I had lying around .	St
1.3.3	In response to your question , no I never actually did have a local printer attached to USB .	St
1.3.4	So I installed the HP and it works perfectly .	St
1.3.5	I was surprised actually , cause I thought it was a USB issue .	St
1.3.6	The only thing that I can think of , is that I had this Samsung printer on my old XP laptop and this Vista PC was printing to it via workgroup sharing .	St
1.3.7	Maybe now that this same printer was moved locally , vista is n't seeing it as local ... the only problem with this theory is the printer is detected and showing ready .	St
1.3.8	If I remove the usb cable it shows offline too .	St
1.3.9	So there is communications .	St
1.3.10	Also , I am running as administrator , and no firewalls in place .	St
1.3.11	Thanks again .	St
1.4.1	Sorry for the prior typo .	St
1.4.2	As I read your reply it sounds like the old failed printer issue .	Polite
1.4.3	Or if a network the old permissions , accounts issues that I think is covered by the IT staff .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I am sorry , I do n't understand your response .	Polite
1.5.2	Who are the & quot ; IT staff & quot ; in this case ?	Ques
1.5.3	Is there a posted document or something I can look up , on this forum ?	Ques
1.5.4	I do believe you are on the right track with the old permissions or accounts ideas , but can you be more specific on where I could look ?	Ques
1.5.5	thanks .	Polite
1.5.6	Tony	St
1.6.1	just to clarify , the printer is not networked at all .	St
1.6.2	it is directly connected to the Vista PC via USB .	St
1.6.3	It WAS connected to an XP pc and networked and the Vista PC printed to it via network .	St
1.6.4	But now it is directly connected .	St
1.6.5	thanks .	Polite
1.7.1	It could be as simple as .	St
1.7.2	1 .	St
1.7.3	The port is bad .	St
1.7.4	On desktops , use the REAR PORTS first .	St
1.7.5	2 .	St
1.7.6	The USB cable is bad .	St
1.7.7	Try another .	St
1.7.8	I was under the impression that the network was in some office .	St
1.7.9	Offices must have an IT staff .	St
1.7.10	Bob	St
1.8.1	the cable is fine ... as I had mentioned I got another HP printer working fine with both the same cable and the same port ( and others as well ) .	St
1.8.2	The printer is good too ... .tested on another pc altogether .	St
1.8.3	I am sure it is a vista problem , and I have the latest drivers from samsung .	St
1.9.1	Vista on the support list .	St
1.9.2	Ouch .	St
