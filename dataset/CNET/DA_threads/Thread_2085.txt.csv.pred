1.1.1	i've left the computer on several times and two times my drive crashed, and or either froze up, now when i am finish i turn my computer off, thats why our operating systems have a turn off program and our hardware as well.	St
1.1.2	so, turn it off when your done.	St
1.2.1	as far as i understand (somebody correct me if i'm wrong) the computer needs restarts and shutdowns to &quot;cement&quot; in changes to the system over time.	St
1.2.2	resarts and shutdowns also clear up alot of wierd problems that occour, so i always reccomend that people shut down once in awhile just so they get in the habit of using that method as a first response to clear up problems.	St
1.2.3	(this = less headaches for novice users) ;o)	St
1.3.1	Do you leave your car running or shut it off?	St
1.3.2	The Worst thing that you can do to your car is Start it!	St
1.3.3	The worst thing you can do to a diesel engine, is start it.	St
1.3.4	So, do you leave it running?	Sug
1.3.5	Of course not.	St
1.3.6	How long do you want that hard drive to last?	St
1.3.7	Do you like the information you now have on that hard drive?	St
1.3.8	Of course you do.	St
1.3.9	Shut down when you are not using, it is just wise investment!	St
1.3.10	Also, shutting down alows your computer to reconfigure when it starts up.	St
1.3.11	Your computer is not human - it doesn't know whether 24 hours have past or 5 minutes have past by.	St
1.3.12	Sure the clock knows, but it doesn't tell the rest of the system this knowledge.	St
1.3.13	The computer is a machine, pure and simple!	St
1.3.14	The Macintosh computer was made to restart and shut down.	St
1.3.15	So is the PC.	St
1.3.16	Have you ever noticed the people who tell you to leave it on are also people who sell computer parts?	St
1.3.17	humm, wonder if there is any correlation there?	St
1.4.1	The way I've heard it put is, turning the computer on and off wears out the hard drive.	St
1.4.2	And keeping it on all the time wears out the hard drive.	St
1.4.3	So take your pick.	St
1.4.4	I turn mine off when I'm done.	St
1.4.5	It saves electricity.	St
1.4.6	My computers have always lasted for years.	St
1.4.7	So turn it off, but use the proper shutdown procedure to keep the system happy.	St
