<s> I just bought a usb 2.0 pci host card to upgrade from 1.1. </s>
<s> When i booted up after I plugged it in, my computer locked-up after about 20-30 seconds. </s>
<s> It seems to be at the very end of the boot-up, right after I get the &quot;new hardware found&quot; message. </s>
<s> The card is generic (I think), with an NEC chip. </s>
<s> I have Windows XP Home, which I updated fully through MS website, but problem occurs the same. </s>
<s> Problem goes away, with no side effects, when card is removed and re-booted. </s>
<s> I have a P4 2.2 with 512M ram. </s>
<s> Lock-up occurs with card plugged in each of my open slots (to cover my bases). </s>
<s> Any ideas/suggestions would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Sounds like a faulty card or somekind of conflict with XP. </s>
<s> Maybe try the card in another machine and see what happens. </s>

<s> Your post neglected to tell what CHIPSET the motherboard is since the motherboard drivers are often not updated by Microsoft. </s>
<s> This and more at http://www.usbman.com Bob </s>
<s> I apologize for any ignorance on my part. </s>
<s> I am far from an expert on this issue. </s>
<s> I went to your website and downloaded BIOS Agent, which reported my chipset to be: Intel 1A30 rev 4. </s>
<s> I have no idea what this means, but hopefully it is what you were talking about. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>

<s> Where is that board you downloaded from and what utility? </s>
<s> Much like taking a car to a shop, the year, make and model are standard things you may have to reveal. </s>
<s> Your computer might have such names and model numbers so forum members can pitch in and here. </s>
<s> Also with every post is this TIP! </s>

<s> I had the same problem, this is how I fixed it; take the card out, download the cards drivers, then reintall the card. </s>
<s> Check your device manager to see if the card is intalled. </s>
<s> If that doesnt work there should be a number to call the manufacturer. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I'll try it. </s>
