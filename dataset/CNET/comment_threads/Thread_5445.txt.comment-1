I have an ECS P45T-A with E8400 and 4GB Gskill DDR2 800 kit (2x2gb 5-5-5-15 @1.9V) running vista 64 hp sp1.
If I run both sticks of ram in it, it crashes randomly after about 10 min in windows or before boot.
I have troubleshooted using either stick of ram alone and they will run 100% stable for days using only 1 chip in any memory slot.
This sounds like a mb issue to me what do you guys think?
Please let me have some tips, Thanks Brian
