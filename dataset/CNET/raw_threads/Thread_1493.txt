THE POWER SUPPLY SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE AND NO PROBLEMS BOOTING OR RUNNING. HOWEVER I HAVE NOTICED THAT EVEN WHEN THE PC I SHUTDOWN THE CASE SEEM WARM WHERE THE POWER SUPPLY IS LOCATED. I HAVE BUILT SEVERAL OTHER PC BEFORE BUT HAVE NOTICED THE HEAT BUILD UP. ANY IDEAS

Any way, you didn't say what power supply you have. Even now, case makers put an undersized 300w unit in most cases. Even worse, they are rated at 300w, they usually actually far below that.For a modern machine, 400w is considered as a desirable minimum if you want to avoid heat problems and lock-ups associated with them. chuck

Then you run your hand on the case and find the psu area of the case to be warmer than the rest of the case. I would think that is normal the psu is putting out some serious heat and it has to go somewhere.

Proffitt	4/7/04 7:35 AM	1.0813233E12	ATX POWER SUPPLY = Off is not &quot;off!&quot;	The ATX supply can power a LAN card, keyboard, mouse or other circuits to effect a startup on such. As such, the power supply will produce some heat. Nothing's really wrong yet. Tell more. Bob
