<s> Windows XP Home SP3 Internet Explorer 6 =================== This is the first time I have bought an External Hard Drive. </s>
<s> So I do not know how to backup and/or restore the following files: My Documents My Pictures My Music My Computer Favorites (Internet Explorer) The Verbatim User's Manual is very poor. </s>
<s> The only thing it shows is the installation and warranty. </s>
<s> The Verbatim Support thru internet is like wise. </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> The external drive should show up in MY COMPUTER as another drive, E, F or somesuch. </s>
<s> Try this, go to MY DOCUMENTS, pick out a document, RIGHT click on it, a window will appear, one of the items will be SEND TO, click on it, the drive letter (for the external) should be there, click on it, at that point the item should be sent to the drive. </s>
<s> To prove it out, exit docs then go back and open MY COMPUTER, open (click on) the drive letter for the external and your transferred doc should be there. </s>
<s> Once you have that mastered it is easy. </s>
<s> To send items en masse, highlight by holding left mouse button, dragging around and follow same procedure, right click, send to etc. </s>
<s> GOOD LUCK! </s>
<s> Treat the ext. </s>
<s> HD as another storage media. </s>
<s> Use it to store your old data or any new data. </s>
<s> As in new data, you use as the default &quot;save&quot; area of say your documents or any other pgm. </s>
<s> where you can tell it to go to be saved and/or afterwards, do manually. </s>
<s> Now, this doesn't negigate proper back-up procedure for super critial data, save to another media as a safeguard. </s>
<s> Do treat the ext. </s>
<s> HD with due care. </s>
