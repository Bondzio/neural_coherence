<s> Now that I seem to have wiped my (IDE)hard drive with DBAN...I need to get my DVR, to recognize it. </s>
<s> First I need to get a look at it, and try formatting it to NTFS. </s>
<s> So far, its no go, trying straight from DBAN erase, then into the DVR. </s>
<s> I have 2 computers at my disposal. </s>
<s> One is the old computer, the erased drive came from(also IDE plarform) that now has no hard drive or OS. </s>
<s> The other, is a newer working computer(SATA platform). </s>
<s> I am now trying to read the IDE(erased drive) with my SATA computer that is fully functional. </s>
<s> I got a cable that plugs into the USB drive of the SATA computer, and then has a plug to fit the IDE connection on the erased drive. </s>
<s> I then powered the tethered drive, from the old computer power supply beside it. </s>
<s> Ugly, but best I can do under the circumstance. </s>
<s> The drive on the end of the cable runs, and shows up on the SATA computer, under device manager. </s>
<s> It does not show up under &quot;Computer&quot; or in Windows Explorer menu. </s>
<s> I ran HP diagnostics(PC doctor) and notification came up that SATA disc management or something; could not recognize the drive firmware. </s>
<s> It allowed me to run a test from the notification window on the erased drive; and it failed pretty quick. </s>
<s> Perhaps DBAN erased the firmware, and I need to re-instal the firmware? </s>
<s> When I looked under the drive properties in device manager; there was no firmware showing in the box next to firmware. </s>
<s> This is why I am thinking firmware. </s>
<s> I have the discs for the drive I am working with; but nothing seems to want to install anywhere. </s>
<s> Neither the working computer, or the tethered drive. </s>
<s> I went to Western digital sight, searched the drive model number; and can't seem to find anything that looks like a firmware update, or firmware. </s>
<s> I might just be too dumb to figure out the sight. </s>
<s> Maybe I am completely off track here. </s>
<s> Any ideas how to get this erased drive recognized, so I may attempt to format it, and or, scan it. </s>
<s> I suspect if I can get it recognized by my working computer and format it FTSC; I can get the DVR to recognize it. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Any ideas here. </s>
<s> Anyone who has used a tether across platforms like this. </s>
<s> I don't have another IDE computer with drive and operating system; or I would put the erased drive on there. </s>
<s> I am stuck with the old computer drive(IDE) and New computer(SATA). </s>
<s> I don't have another IDE drive to put the OS on, and run the old computer. </s>
<s> Or I would not be working across platforms. </s>
<s> The one other long shot, is trying to put the old DVR hard rive that still seems to work, in with the erased drive I am trying to format; and see if the DVR might erase and format them both. </s>
<s> This probably won't work if firmware is missing either. </s>
<s> Does DBAN wipe the firmware? </s>
<s> Many DVRs don't take a PC formatted drive. </s>
<s> We do that in the service depot or if the DVR accepts drives, it's in a menu. </s>
<s> But all that you put here and you missed the detail that folk can use. </s>
<s> Make, model? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Everything I have read on forums, says it will recognize NTSC standard format, most computers use. </s>
<s> This does not mean it will, but is the assumption going in. </s>
<s> If I could get this erased drive back to useable, and at least be able to see the drive on my good working computer; then I could assume it is a problem with the DVR recognition. </s>
<s> You are probably right with many DVR's, but this one is a bit more open format.... </s>
<s> I think. </s>
<s> I realize I am not going to be able to read stuff off the DVR back to the computer, and don't intend to do any of that. </s>
<s> I just want to be able to run the DVR with a bit more capacity, same as it ran before. </s>
<s> Other's claim to just stick a WD drive up to 320gig in, and off it goes. </s>
<s> I have yet to get a clean formatted drive to offer the DVR. </s>
<s> I nuked the older computer drive with DBAN. </s>
<s> Now I need to get the computer to recognize it, before I even try the DVR again. </s>
<s> Someone mentioned cloning; but I am not sure if I am at that step yet. </s>
<s> Cloning will not do the firmware and format I don't think??? </s>
<s> If I get the drive recognized on the computer, and it still won't take on the DVR; I think then I may try a clone. </s>
<s> The DVR has a format option in its menus; but I have not gotten the menu to come up with the erased drive here.I have not tried putting both drives on a single harness cable(into the DVR) and trying that way. </s>
<s> That might be my next step. </s>
<s> I just need to get this drive back to the way it might come from a store. </s>
<s> Firmware, and formated. </s>
<s> Thank You moderator! </s>
<s> I am open for suggestions here. </s>
<s> Let me tip my hand a little. </s>
<s> I have worked over the years in the design of Surveillance DVRs. </s>
<s> That format is the video format and has little to do with the HDD format. </s>
<s> http://www.ehow.com/how_6320578_upgrade-hard-drive-polaroid-drm_2001g.html It appears you may only need to pop in a new drive but given what I read above I wonder if you set the jumpers on the new drive the same as the old drive. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I did check the jumpers. </s>
<s> They were the same. </s>
<s> I had some other problems. </s>
<s> Apparently the unit had been dropped years ago, and a corner of the power board was cracked, and the dvd carriage was rigged to work, do to a broken tooth on the carriage. </s>
<s> It always worked screwy; and I had to boot from a wall switch, because the on/off did not work. </s>
<s> Anyway, after fixing a dead fan, blown capcitor on the power board, and soldering a jumper across the broken trace. </s>
<s> I got it back the way it should have run. </s>
<s> It now says hello on start up, and the on/off works. </s>
<s> Still took some work getting the new bigger drive, to boot up. </s>
<s> I ended up having to do a hot swap. </s>
<s> On top of the hot swap; it seems the burner has to be plugged in to the board; for the hard drives to boot. </s>
<s> At first I thought my repairs had failed; but when I got desperate and tried to run a movie from disk, just to see if I could get anything to work; the hard drive booted right up. </s>
<s> I then entered the setup menu-did a hot swap for the erased drive I have been trying to install-then erased it; and now it reboots on its own. </s>
<s> No matter which drive I put in; when I pull the burner, then reboot; the menus won't load nor will either hard drive boot. </s>
<s> It took a hot swap, and complete harness hook-up to boot. </s>
<s> I think the hot swap, was key, to get the menus to load; and allow me to erase the other drive I am trying to install. </s>
<s> Once I ran the erase, perhaps it also formatted; because it rebooted after that. </s>
<s> With the original drive completely removed. </s>
<s> Now I have a harness quandary. </s>
<s> It looks like I am going to have to leave the flaky burner in the DVR to get the hard drive to boot, not entirely sure yet. </s>
<s> The IDE ribbons that supply data, to both the hard drive and burner; are different than the standard IDE (master slave) ribbon in most computers. </s>
<s> Unlike the regular computer IDE ribbons; the ribbons feeding the drives in the DVR, have all their pin sockets open for male pins. </s>
<s> The standard master/slave ribbons seem to have the one dead pin socket. </s>
<s> Does anyone know, what to call these ribbon cables in the DVR. </s>
<s> They are exactly the same as the IDE, just no blank pin in the middle. </s>
<s> I need to know what to call it; so I can hunt for them on line. </s>
<s> Thank You. </s>
