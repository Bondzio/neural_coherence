the ssid name for the wireless network must it be the same as the workgroup name?
no.
but what many discover is the wep/wpa doesn't work across vendors.
updated firmware in the router may help, and sometimes does not.
workaround?
none.
what can you do?
either change the router or use mac filtering.
