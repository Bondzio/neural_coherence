Hi!
I have an Elements by WD 400GB external hard drive.
I have a small hard drive in my laptop, so I keep most of my information on this drive.
I'd like to share it off of my desktop computer so I can access my files from anywhere in my house, but don't want the rest of my family messing with my drive.
Is there a free program to secure the drive, or even a Windows utility?
I'm running Windows XP Home SP2 on the desktop and laptop.
Thanks for your help!
Nick
