Unfortunately; I have also Visited this Same Link and the Error Message I received is &quot;Target Not Found&quot;...When I tried to Install the Update? I FIND THIS TO BE INTERESTING, SINCE THIS IS A DIRECT LINK TO A PIONEER WEB PAGE? I did however find a link to a DVR-107D Firmware Update from a European Union web page that (INSTALLED WITHOUT A PROBLEM)! Here is the Link I Found: http://www.techspot.com/drivers/driver/file/mirror/2669/ It beats me why Pioneer Firmware Updates in Europe would be different than those for the US? NOW FOR THE REAL REASON I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO UPDATE THE FIRMWARE ON THIS DRIVE. IT IS ALSO A &quot;BURNER&quot; AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REVIVE IT WITH THE FIRMWARE UPDATE. THE TRUTH IS, THE DRIVE &quot;STILL DOES NOT BURN PROPERLY&quot;? Looks as though No Firmware Update of any kind will revive this drive &quot;For Burning&quot; that is....It works fine for just playing a DVD! Anyway, thats the skinny of it, I found my answer, but I found it in a manner I did not expect! Hope this helps someone else! Sugarbear246

Good luck in finding the firmware but I've found that with each passing year there is less and less support and the files fade away. Try a CD/DVD lens cleaner? Bob
