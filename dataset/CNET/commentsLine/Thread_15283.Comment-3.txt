i originally purchased the nexus 7 and loved every thing about it.
my wife loved it so much, well, she took it from me.
i then purchased the me301 in place of another nexus and prefer the me301 for a few reasons.
the number 1 reason was it's memory expansion capabilities, the second reason was the rear camera.
crazy as it sounds, you don't expect to take pictures with a tablet, but it's a good feature to have when the need arises.
i will admit, i like the comfort of the nexus 7 better, however the new me301, is pretty comfortable for it's size.
last comment, i use the device for personal and business.
the me301 is a better choice when sharing information with friends and or customers.
oh wait, one more note- both these purchases were my first (i mean second) asus purchase - and i am really impressed with the power and capabilities they packed in a low cost device (s).
hope this helps you make a decision.
