because consumer and even commercial wifi gear is designed to meet fcc limits and therefore just so much coverage.
and this coverage is site specific.
if you must do this, plan on an initial setup, test and then app more waps as needed to fill in the dead spots.
and be aware that to design your solution so that it works perfectly the first time means we would spend about 10 times more since we would just fill the space with access points.
