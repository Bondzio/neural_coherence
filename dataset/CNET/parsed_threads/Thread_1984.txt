<s> Opinions? </s>
<s> Total cost so far is a little under 1100 dollars with tax. </s>
<s> Why the cooler? </s>
<s> You could save some $$ and go for a GTX 570 instead? </s>
<s> Similar to the build here for $1000 </s>
<s> I agree Proffitt. </s>
<s> That machine will not be putting out enough heat to warrant a water cooler. </s>
<s> Unless you plan on over clocking both the cpu and the gpu, you won't need it. </s>
<s> That having been said if you do plan on over clocking, keep it, but make sure you have fittings for both gpu/cpu. </s>
<s> Also make sure you use the same hose diameter for the whole system. </s>
<s> No step downs or step ups. </s>
