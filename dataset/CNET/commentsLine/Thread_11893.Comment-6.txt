for instance i see such an error reported with a btc dvd recorder, but you didn't respond to the forum note with make and model of all the parts.
this is not tech support.
this is a place where we team up on your issue.
if you don't want to share then this is very rough.
if you don't know what you have, just say so.
many learn about belarc advisor so they can help themselves.
