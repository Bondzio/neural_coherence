<s> If you don't want to read the full post, I made a summary at the bottom. </s>
<s> I have 2 hard drives in this sytem. </s>
<s> The master is a 20GB drive, and the slave is a 180 GB drive that had 2 partitions, 1 NTFS and the other FAT32. </s>
<s> I was using Windows XP Pro (SP2) just fine; I was booting from the 20 gig and using the 180 to store media (music, video, games, installers, an image of the 20 gig drive, backups, etc). </s>
<s> Because the 20 was upgraded from 98SE to XP and converted to NTFS, it was using 512b clusters, and I wanted the 4kb standard for some reason, so I decided to reformat and reinstall. </s>
<s> After reformatting the 20 gig and doing a clean XP Pro install, I found that the 180 gig drive registered as an unpartitioned 128 gig drive. </s>
<s> I did not format the 180 during installation, though I did notice that it registered as unformatted during installation (at the point where you choose where to install Windows) . </s>
<s> I popped in Knoppix to see if the data was still there. </s>
<s> Knoppix read the data just fine. </s>
<s> How can I make Windows recognize my drive? </s>
<s> SUMMARY: Was working perfectly. </s>
<s> Reformated and reinstalled WinXP on master, slave shows up as unformatted. </s>
<s> Linux can read slave just fine. </s>
<s> How do I make Windows detect my drive and data? </s>
<s> Drives over 127GB get support in SP1 or SP2. </s>
<s> XP won't support this drive. </s>
<s> I have sp2, but the problem is that the drive shows as unformatted. </s>
<s> SP1 or SP2 was installed. </s>
<s> Doing so will corrupt the volume. </s>
<s> Sorry to read about your loss. </s>

<s> I had the original XP CD without the service packs. </s>
<s> I slipstreamed sp2 into the Windows installer then burned it again. </s>
<s> After booting from the CD I pushed &quot;Enter&quot; to do a clean install, as opposed to &quot;R&quot; for a recovery. </s>
<s> At the point where I was to select where to install Windows, I selected the C drive, which had been newly formatted the Maxtor utility. </s>
<s> The installation showed that I had lots of unpartitioned space on the E drive. </s>
<s> I installed windows on the C drive, letting windows format the drive. </s>
<s> When the install was complete, I went to My Computer and found a 128 GB drive that was unformmattted. </s>
<s> I loaded Knoppix, which found all of my data just fine. </s>
<s> Is there a program out there (preferably freeware) that can recreate the file table I am assuming was deleted? </s>
<s> or make Windows read the files on the drive? </s>
<s> You tripped up the XP installer. </s>
<s> XP, and especially with SP2 all slipped in would not need such preparation on the hard disk. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't see why this would affect windows not being able to read the untouched hard drive, unless the XP installer touched it and didn't tell anyone. </s>
<s> (btw, if it matters, i left out a word, it should have been: &quot;which had been newly formatted BY the Maxtor utility&quot;) </s>
<s> How XP's drive table works. </s>
<s> One of the lessons you learn is to not use such tools unless required. </s>

<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> I'm going to buy another HD today and put it in an external housing for backup that does not stay connected to my computer. </s>
<s> Read these forums as members look for help in how to recover files from external &quot;backup&quot; drives. </s>
<s> Great copy method. </s>
<s> Backup? </s>
<s> Doubtful. </s>
