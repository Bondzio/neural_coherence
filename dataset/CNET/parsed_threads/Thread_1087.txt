<s> Hi, I wanna get a USB TV turner that can turn my laptop into a HDTV. </s>
<s> There are quite a lot of them at Newegg.com, such as Hauppauge, Plextor. </s>
<s> Can anyone suggest what to buy? </s>
<s> What is most important to me is that it has to enable subtitle, because I need to record some TV dramas and study American English through the subtitles. </s>
<s> Most of time I may use it with the cable TV signal, so the plug is what I concern. </s>
<s> I notice that the plug is different between Canada and the U.S. </s>
<s> If I want to make it work for both places, what kind of adapter should I get? </s>
<s> the portablity is also my concern because I travel. </s>
<s> So I think USB models are better than those bigger ones. </s>
<s> Regarding the antenna, I heard people saying that the antenna that comes within the package is useless, or not very effective. </s>
<s> I do have a old antenna that belong to my old analogue TV. </s>
<s> The two sticks can stretch out very long. </s>
<s> Can it be of any help to get signals over the air while I am at travel? </s>
<s> Best! </s>

<s> I'd stick with Hauppauge. </s>
<s> Details are at the Hauppauge web site so I will not duplicate that here and address other points in your question. </s>
<s> &quot;I notice that the plug is different between Canada and the U.S. </s>
<s> If I want to make it work for both places, what kind of adapter should I get?&quot; You'll have to supply a little detail. </s>
<s> I lived in Vancouver, BC for over 8 years and the cable was via the same &quot;F type&quot; connection as I have here in Boston, USA. </s>
<s> As to the Antenna. </s>
<s> You must be thinking of the new HDTV antenna. </s>
<s> Just like old analog TV days better antennas do work better. </s>
<s> Since it's not the antenna's fault that you are too far away from the TV transmitter there is nothing to add here from me. </s>
<s> I am encountering folk that were never told how Over The Air (OTA) TV works. </s>
<s> So they ask what could be taken as silly questions. </s>
<s> Your question is not silly at all. </s>
<s> It only brings up that many expect this to all work even when in remote areas of the NT. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> I will probably get a Hauppauge. </s>
<s> But still I still need to know if it can activate the close captioning or not. </s>
<s> As you mentioned the Hauppauge website, I went there but cannot find an answer for this from FAQ. </s>
<s> In terms of the plug, I think it was my mistake. </s>
<s> There is no difference between LA and Toronto, as a friend told me. </s>

<s> Thanks again Bob. </s>
<s> I am reading those threads and it is good to know that at least through some effort, some people can eventually get the CC. </s>
