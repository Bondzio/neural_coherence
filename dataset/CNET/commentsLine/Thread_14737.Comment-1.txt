i am having trouble when trying to adjust color settings from 16 to high color 16. display properties box reporting that there's a irq conflict that prevents me from changing color settings.
any suggestions?
thanks in advance.
p.s.
when i tried to run hardware troubleshooter, a blank window appeared.
