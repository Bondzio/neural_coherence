1.1.1	I have just ordered a MacBook Pro 17&quot; and notice that it has a Firewire 800 connexion.	St
1.1.2	I have a Panasonic GS 400 Camcorder and have been downloading by a Firewire 400 .	St
1.1.3	Will the 800 give me (a) Faster downloading?	St
1.1.4	(b) BETTER downloading results?	St
1.1.5	{I know, of course that I will have to buy the appropriate cable.	St
1.1.6	Will it be &quot;worth it ?}	St
1.2.1	I don't see Firewire 800 support on this camcorder.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	as it is limited to FireWire 400.	St
1.3.2	There aren't many FireWire800 devices out yet... a few hard drives...	St
1.4.1	As usual, thanks to you both for succinct replies.	Polite
1.4.2	I might have guessed it would not be simple !	St
1.4.3	(I had thought it was the apparatus being downloaded TO that was the governing factor).	St
1.5.1	Firewire 800 won't be of much benefit for standard DV (and maybe even HDV) camcorders, because the video isn't often large enough or the storage (on either end) fast enough to break the limits of Firewire 400.	St
1.5.2	You usually see Firewire 800 on very fast external hard drives (ones in RAID arrays) or in professional HD cameras.	St
1.5.3	That said, if you find yourself ever running out of Firewire ports, there are adapters which will let you connect Firewire 400 devices on the 800 port.	St
1.6.1	Thanks, Electronista.	St
1.6.2	Do I take it that, although I would derive no benefit from using the 800 on the MacBook Pro for my video, I COULD use it (with the approriate cable, of course) as a 400?	St
1.7.1	Sonnet Technologies make one for $14.95 and have it in stock Part number is FAD 824 and you can see it if you search their online store.	St
1.7.2	It has a Male 800 connector on one end and a Female 400 connector on the other.	St
1.7.3	Of course, the connection speed will be at the 400 rate.	St
1.7.4	Hope this helps P	St
1.8.1	Hello: I have a PowerBook with a FireWire 800 port.	St
1.8.2	I use it to connect an external hard drive.	St
1.8.3	You may want to add an external drive in order to back up your videos.	St
1.8.4	Using the fastest possible connection for the external drive may gain you some speed.	St
1.8.5	Hard drives with FireWire 800 connections are readily available.	St
