Hi, I know what Tv tuner and graphics card do, but that's about all.
I would like to use my computer (Dell 5150, has a couple of PCI slots) to watch and record TV from cable and also HDTV droadcasts from the air.
Can you recommend a card - I know there are huge quality differences.
Specifiallly, will I get better value if I buy TV tuner and graphics cards separately or will there be problems (such that the TV tuner card wont utilize the graphics card but will use the main processor)?
ALso is there any freesoftware you can recomend for viewing and recording TV prgrams.
Thanks a lot!
Jonni
