<s> I have two monitors and would like to make on portrait style. </s>
<s> Is it best to buy a monitor stand that will hold the monitor in portrait mode or just buy a dedicated portrait style monitor? </s>
<s> What's stopping you from rotating the display as you wish? </s>
<s> If you need a stand, then make or buy as you see fit. </s>
<s> I don't think it will be a requirement for this to work. </s>
<s> My portrait setup on photobucket example is at: http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/desktop2.jpg Bob </s>
