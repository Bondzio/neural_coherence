I'm using Tweaker Portable Speakers for my laptop but would like something a little better which could be powered by the USB port instead of AC or charging a battery like the Tweaker Speakers.

It keeps the laptop cooler and takes the power from USB. Sound is pretty good too (not brilliant).

I called the Acer company but they don't sell external speakers and they couldn't tell me which external speakers would work with my Acer netbook.

I bought some USB powered speakers from Best Buy to use with my HP Lap Top that were suppose to work but it blew my power supply and I had to spend over $100 to get a new one.

So any device suitable for USB power shouldn't have blown the power supply (that's 30W or 40W for the netbook), especially if you dimmed the screen to have that use less power. Maybe they were defective and something short-circuited? Is there anything in the documentation from Acer about maximum power the USB can safely deliver? If not, that's the question to ask their customer service. Then you have the specs for your speakerset. However, the USB power of a laptop generally is less than the USB power of a desktop, especially when they run on battery, making USB powered speakers definitely not the first choice. As I said, any externally powered speakerset should be OK. Kees

It's pretty sad when tech support for Acer couldn't even answer this question.

Acer won't guarantee that any USB-powered stuff they don't sell themselves will work. No maker of any USB-powered stuff will guarantee that it will work with your Acer and not blow it up. Kees

I was wondering if they make an audio cable with 2 ends so that I could have one end hooked to my computer for speakers and one end to plug into my ACER NETBOOK so I could use the Bose as speakeks for my netbook as well.

I don't have the netbook yet to try this.
