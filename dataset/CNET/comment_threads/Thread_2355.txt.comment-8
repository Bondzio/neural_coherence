If my Device Manager lists &quot;Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller&quot; twice, does that mean I have 2 USB 2.0 ports?
Does &quot;Standard OpenHCD USB Host Controller&quot; mean USB 1.0?
What would it say if I had USB 3.0?
I have 6 total USB ports, 4 in the back and 2 in the front.
Is there anyway to tell which are the USB 2.0 ports?
Thanks very much.
