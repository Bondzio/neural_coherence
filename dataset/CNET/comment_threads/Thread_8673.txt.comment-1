I'm building a computer and this just so happens to be the first one I have ever attempted to build.
I was hoping someone could check this out and assure me that it is all compatible before I go ahead and start ordering parts.
I have updated specs from the last one .... MSI K8N Neo4 Platinum nForce4 Ultra (Socket 939) PCI-Express Motherboard Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 Plus NCQ 80GB SATA 8MB Cache Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 Plus NCQ 400GB SATA 8MB Cache Antec SLK3000B Midi Tower Case (Top one) http://www.overclockers.co.uk/acatalog/Antec_Cases.html AMD Athlon 64 3200+ 2.0GHz Socket 939, 512KB Winchester!
Corsair 1GB DDR XMS3200C2 Pro TwinX (2x512MB) CAS2 Antec NeoPower 480W ATX2.0 BFG GeForce 6800 GT OC 256MB DDR3 TV-Out/Dual DVI (PCI-Express) - Retail Vantec Slot Protector Kit - Red Also would this be worth looking at .. http://www.overclockers.co.uk/acatalog/Acoustic_Materials.html I leave my computer on overnight so I'd like it to be quiet, very quiet.
I think that's all I need I already have a DVD R/RW.
Overall it's exsensive so I'll save and save then build my machine!
So I think it's all set all these parts were found on www.overclockers.co.uk Any advice?
