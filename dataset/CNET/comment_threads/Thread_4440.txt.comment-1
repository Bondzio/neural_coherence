I am a victim of sporadic system instability, ranging from blue screens, to desktop hangs to file system/Windows corruption.
I'll fix one thing, and everything will be fine for weeks to months, and then some other problem arises.
I think it's something to do with the IDE bus, because sometimes an IDE device won't be detected during boot, or POST won't get beyond &quot;Detecting IDE devices&quot;.
I've run diagnostics on memory and disk drives, replaced a disc drive (I try to run 2 Western digital 200 GB Caviar drives and a Seagate 200GB Barracuda) and upgraded BIOS on everything I could), just installed a new MoBo (Asus A8N5X), went to an ATX case with 3 fans, and just today I got a blue screen &quot;a process or thread crucial to system operation has unexpectedly exited&quot; when I tried to add the WD drive to a simplified Seagate/HP 840i DVD writer ide chain.
I'm plunking down big $$ to get an Antec 550W powersupply today.
Has anyone ever heard of a defective IDE device ruining another IDE device?
Am I asking for trouble with 4 IDE devices in my box?
- if so, will replacing one IDE drive with a SATA relieve the strain?
