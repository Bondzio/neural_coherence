Hello, I never had this problem before and I can't find any possible settings that would be causing it.
I have a Motorola Surfboard Modem that is connected to my DD-WRT 54G Wireless Router.
If I put in my external IP address in the browser while connected to my wireless network, It directs me to the correct Local IP that I have it set to.
If I try to access it outside my network it just times out and says &quot;Response Error.
Technical Description: 502 Bad Gateway - Response error, a bad response was received from another proxy server or the destination origin server&quot; Any ideas of what I can look for?
Thanks!
