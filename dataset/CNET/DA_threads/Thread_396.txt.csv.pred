1.1.1	In an email in MS Outlook Express ( Windows XP , sp2 ) , when I click on a hyperlink within an email message , one of the folders on my computer shows up instead of launching Internet Explorer and linking to the particular web site .	St
1.1.2	Any suggestions on how do I correct this ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks ,	St
1.2.1	http : //windowsxp.mvps.org/IEFIX.htm notes this but another possibility is the Tools , Options , Security in Outlook Express is set to not allow such .	St
1.2.2	Worth mentioning is that some PESTS ( virus/other ) do this via email so I 'll write it is unsafe to click on links in emails .	St
