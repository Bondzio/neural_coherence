i just want to know the advantages/disadvantages of using either of the two; firewire 400 & usb 2.0 also, very often i read or hear that a person's external storage solution crashed while being used with usb 2.0. i haven't exactly heard the same about firewire 400, anyone experienced similar problems with firewire as well?
