<s> I haven't recently made any changes to my system, connected any new hardware or installed anything short of the new iTunes. </s>
<s> Nonetheless, after logging in this morning my mouse and keyboard (logitech wireless desktop, through USB) didn't respond so that I could log in. </s>
<s> I used an old keyboard to progress past the Logon page (which I put straight into the keyboard plug - the round purple one) however have noticed that every USB device on computer fails to work! </s>
<s> This includes the internet (wireless USB dongle), my printer (through USB) and my printer (USB also). </s>
<s> I tried plugging in my ipod, and while it is able to charge, it is not recognized by my system! </s>
<s> Am currently using my laptop (which the wireless desktop, printer, ipod all work on) and have tried swapping the devices to empty USB ports, but nothing works! </s>
<s> I am currently running Windows XP SP2. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> So, what do I do? </s>
<s> Remove USB branch from HW Mgr and have the PC rediscover the USB ports? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> I removed everything under USB and used Action to find new hardware. </s>
<s> The USB entries returned, but the keyboard, mouse and external hard drive were ''invisible'' to the system. </s>
<s> What would be the next step? </s>
