Sure thing.
Thanks for ths input!
I'll have another look around and see what else will run well.
Most importantly, I need something that can run an i7, can handle 2 gtx 925's in sli and will be a good starting place for overclocking in the future.
I was mostly drawn to the R2E because I heard it made OCing far easier than most mobos.
