But you can put the server PC IP address into the DMZ on the router.
I can't write at length about what is a single sentence and a single router entry.
If you need more about the ROUTER DMZ then you hit the usual search engine as anything I would write is there.
Port forwarding is quite a bit of setup.
I can't teach that here.
The owner must dive in with more research as its setup varies with the router so again, it's back to the owner.
They must be comfortable with doing this since they get to support it.
