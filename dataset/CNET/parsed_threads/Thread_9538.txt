<s> I have two USB ports on the front of a PC that I use for backups. </s>
<s> For no apparent reason they stopped working today. </s>
<s> I plugged my printer into the ports to verify if they work and they did work with the printer. </s>
<s> When I try to do a backup I get a message saying the port/drive does not exist. </s>
<s> I went into the device manager and those two USB ports don't show there either. </s>
<s> HELP...does anyone have any thoughts on what to do next? </s>
<s> About all you can do is check to make sure the connections are good. </s>
<s> You have have wiring from the front ports to the MB header. </s>
<s> Remove the connectors and plug them back in. </s>
<s> Make sure the pins in the connectors are fully seated as well. </s>
<s> Pulled pins are notorious for causing connection failures. </s>
<s> I have had USB ports go bad and I suspect due to static discharge. </s>
<s> When this happened to me, however, the ports didn't disappear but showed as having a problem. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Yes all of the rear ports are working, except when I plug in an external drive of any sort. </s>
<s> I know the connection is good on the front ports as the printer works in them. </s>
<s> I'd look to System Restore to a day ago. </s>
<s> Will this delete any new data added since one day ago? </s>
<s> We only lose what we don't backup. </s>
<s> System Restore is detailed in this next link. </s>
<s> http://windows.microsoft.com/is-is/windows-vista/what-is-system-restore Can I ask why folk don't backup? </s>
<s> I mean, any nasty could arrive and blam. </s>
<s> Where's the backup? </s>

<s> Did a system restore and USB still won't read any mass storage device. </s>
<s> I backup everyday. </s>
<s> Often enough most frt. </s>
<s> USB ports are connected by a cable harness inside the PC to the header on the mtrbd. </s>
<s> With power-OFF, locate and reseat several times the connection and retry for use. </s>
<s> If it still fails, then it very well could have blown the USB chip that's the hub typically runs 2 USB ports. </s>
<s> Unless this is a generic type of port placement, then you have to install a satellite hub using a rear USB port which can add 2-8 new ports, google for such. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> And if there is a hardware issue, I test for that by booting up a Live CD (Ubuntu or other). </s>
<s> No install needed and I can test the hardware. </s>
