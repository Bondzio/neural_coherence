<s> Hi, I understand that the answer depends on how often you use, but anyone has any experience with that model? </s>
<s> The ink is cheap, but how much would the printhead cost, if you have to repplace it? </s>
<s> and how often? </s>
<s> I'm planning to buy this model for my home office. </s>
<s> Any info/advices would help. </s>
<s> Many Thanks </s>
<s> Today's printers are low cost marvels that appear to be 2 year designs. </s>
<s> Before you complain, take a trip back in time 10 years ago and consider what a bargain these printers are. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> According to the Service Manual is the average expected life. </s>
<s> Some will last longer and some less. </s>
<s> If you ever need to replace it I would recommend buying a printer with the same printhead {IP4000} it would be cheaper then buying the printhead alone, plus you get a new set of carts. </s>
<s> Ebay sells the IP4000 pretty cheaply just make sure the include the ink and everything. </s>
<s> Mine lasted about 11 months. </s>
<s> Just got off the phone with Cannon and a replacement is being sent under warranty. </s>
<s> Otherwise cost about $85.00 </s>
