3 1/2 yrs.
is a long time for a burner be happy you got good use from it.
i suggest you blow it out and use a cd cleaner disk to wipe down the insides as best as possible.
that's it, no magic cure, your burner is probably on its last legs and be best to just replace.
i'm sure this is an h/w issue from wear&tear from use.
