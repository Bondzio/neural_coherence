i stress i have no knowledge of this, but your question interested me so i did a little research.
have a look at proxy and the windows hosts file .
it says; &quot;using a remote proxy server which basically does the dns requesting for you does prevent the hosts file from being considered.
in other words ...your browser will route its request through your proxy server before your machine looks up an entry in hosts.&quot; that said, another article seems to say this is a setting in the browser on each machine connected to the server.
look at  then scroll down to section 4, &quot; (4.)
if you have a proxy server: &quot; &quot; in ie - choose tools:internet options:connections and choose your connection.
if you are using a proxy server, make sure the box called &quot;bypass proxy server for local addresses&quot; is checked.
in netscape - go to edit: preferences: advanced: proxies and click the manual setting.
then click on view and type &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; into the exceptions box at the bottom &quot; i think that is saying, check ie on each machine and remove the tick for &quot;bypass proxy server for local addresses&quot;.
and the same for other browser types.
does that help?
