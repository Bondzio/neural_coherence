i have the intel desktop board d915gvwb, would this board support a pentium 4 hyper-threading cpu or better yet maybe one of intels new 6xx cpu for 64bit compatibility.
maybe i should just swap out the motherboard for a aftermarket motherboard with a new cpu.
what 3rd party motherboard would fit inside my emachines t5026 case?
thanks again for all the help.
