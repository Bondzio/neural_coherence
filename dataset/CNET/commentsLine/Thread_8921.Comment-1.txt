i've been out of the hardware game for awhile now...recently bought a new desktop from dell.
they screwed up and i ended up getting two 256 ati 2600 xt's.
i currently have one installed.
i've been reading up on hardware and noticed talk about running two video cards.
did i read that right?
question is ... am i able to install the other one and gain anything from it?
i'm currently using one monitor(42&quot; lcd)...but would soon like to switch to dual 22&quot;s. thanks in advance.
