hello all i'm getting some random system freeze / crash after running any apps.
please advice: hardware: intel quad core q8200 with stock fan/heat sink asus p5ql/epu motherboard kingston 2g ddr-800 x 2 galaxy gtx 260+ video card (896mb vmemory) some 500g hd antec 500w power supply (came with the case) all of them are brand new.
i assembled them myself (third time, first time for myself) symptoms: 1. crash randomly in windows xp 32 bit 2. crashed twice in windows 7 64 bit 3. crash within 5 mins when playing timeshift 4. does not crash that often when playing need for speed carbon 5. when crashing/freezing, either the system reboots itself, or the screen shows weird patterns and stays there forever.
things i've tried: 1. temperatures of the cpu, video card, northbridge don't even go over 60c during summer time.
2. in xp, all drivers are up to date 3. updated motherboard bios, and tried the nvidia stock bios for video card 4. i tried a power consumption calculator.
it told me the expected watts should be around 300.
5. i tried re-wiring everything, i don't think it's connect problem 6. i tried giving nb an extra .1v and problem still persists
