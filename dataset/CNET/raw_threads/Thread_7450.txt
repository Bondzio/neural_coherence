Even though this computer was old and slow, it was perfect for some functions I needed to conduct. I have several laptops for serious processing power. I want to resurrect this box and I was wondering what I could buy to replace the dead HD. It was a 40G IDE drive. Any suggestions are appreciated.

I figure I will spend some $$$ to attempt to get some of the data transferred. Do you have a recommendation on manufacturer, model, etc?

Surely you can find an 80 for not much more at newegg.com or geeks.com As to paying for transfer of the data, why would I do that when I have a cable like http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2020&cat=HDD and free cloning software like G4U? Sorry but this is an area I feel you DIY or pay up. Bob

The question had more to do with I did not know what I could replace the drive with and was looking for recommendations (size, type, manufacturer, etc.) Can I replace an IDE drive with a SATA? As for transferring the data, if the original drive worked, then I would have no problem in transferring data myself. So, I figure if the data is recoverable, then I will happily pay to have the data recovered and transferred. Thank you to everyone who has replied thus far. It has been very helpful.

For the most part the ones that write &quot;I couldn't make it work&quot; are the ones to avoid. -&gt; In closing, currently the hard disk makers are just like getting gas from Texaco, BP or Hess. Maybe there is someone that can write a convincing treatise on why one is preferred over the other. Bob
