it is not fine without the router.
if i plug directly into the cable modem it has the same problem.
could it be some kind of dns problem?
i know i'm not very knowledgable about these things so i apologize if that is a silly question, but when the connection craps out, it seems like it sees the site (if i'm in a browser) but can't manage to resolve it.
it's like it gets tired of doing stuff for me so it takes a break and then it's fine again.
