i didn't expect such a response to my post so i did some temp.
testing.
the cpu is an amd dual core, 95 watts, running at 2.8ghz (not overclocked).
standard fan supplied with cpu upon purchase.
motherboard is a gigabyte ma770-ud3.
os is windows 7 (which has many less background services running compared to vista), bios is award modular bios v.6.0.
cpu warning temp.
is set to lowest 60c/140f.
case side panel is removed, the only other fan in the case is the psu fan.
cpu heatsink fan is blowing (pushing) air down onto heatsink.
thermal paste is used.
room temp.
is 17c and cloudy (not cloudy in the room).
program used to report core temps.
is 'core temp.'
i checked the temp at two points.
core temp.
at idle (no apps running, only normal background services) = 36c.
core temp.
when playing game (dead space) 48c.
not a significant heat increase considering the machine is running a demanding game and well within the warning setting.
turned off machine swapped out fan and heatsink for the reversed airflow fan sucking (pulling) air away/up from the cpu, applied thermal paste same quantity as before.
same test applied.
core temp.
at idle 36c.
core temp when playing game 50c.
a two degree difference, when gaming, between pushing and pulling airflows.
this was on a mild day.
when i recieved warning beeps in the past the room temp.
was 26-27c, a big increase.
this is what led me to use an external/personal fan to aid in the cooling of the cpu and northbridge passive heatsink which on this board really has serious overheating issues.
make of this what you will.
