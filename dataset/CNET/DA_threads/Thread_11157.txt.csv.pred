1.1.1	i just bought this Antec TP-II 380 power supply and i found out that it dont have a -5v at the atx connector.	St
1.1.2	after i connect it up it successfully boot up the system (mainboard using 20 pin atx connector).	St
1.1.3	so i was wondering what was the -5v use for and will it affect the stability my PC.	St
1.1.4	url for the power supply http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=22380	St
1.2.1	The -5V was used in the IBM PC (the 8088 models) to power RAM which at the time needed that supply.	St
1.2.2	Today, it's not used AFAIK.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	another rail that i don't believe has been used in a while is the -12v	St
1.4.1	&quot;The full PCI specification lists 5 Volt, 3.3 Volt, 12 Volt and -12 Volt power rails.&quot; - http://www.ncipher.com/products/faq_universal_pci.html While I can't recall a PCI card that relied on the -12V line, it was also used in older RS232 driver chips that were used at least till the Pentium 1 days.	St
1.4.2	Maybe longer.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	it's only used on the ATX 20-pin and the rail is like .5A or less	St
1.6.1	The common MC1488 needs a separate 12 Volt supply.	St
1.6.2	Both +12 and -12 Volt is required and not optional.	St
1.6.3	This was a defacto standard in PC designs for decades and ... didn't require much power as you noted.	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
