Reason I'm asking is because The Airport in my country normally checks all computers. I don't have anything immoral, only Some pirated software (and the airport here makes issues and fines about that). I simply cannot afford to buy software!! So my plan is to launch DBAN when the authouraties decided to check my computer? Do you think this could work in time? Please advise. Thanks Dean

That in itself would be suspicious and if I were a Customs Official I would begin investigating further if a traveller turned up with a laptop running DBAN or similar. I find your post rather strange. Saying that you have &quot;pirated software which is not immoral&quot; is a matter of opinion. I find it immoral, and offensive. We don't discuss piracy in these forums and such discussions often get locked. But not only that, if you cannot afford to buy the software, then you don't use it. It is that simple. If you cannot afford to buy a car, do you steal it? If so that is a criminal offense in most countries, and to me software piracy is the same. You do realise that DBAN wipes everything? The whole hard disk. Nothing survives. That's it from me but beware, I am tracking this discussion. Any 'workarounds' or otherwise replies that I feel contravene Forum Policy and I will start deleting and will lock the post. Mark

And Yes I also know how DBAN works, All I wanted to know was an average of how long it takes to function. Your argument is useless. First of all if a person can't afford a car there is always public transport. This is not always the case with Software!!! I use many open source and freeware programs but there are still certain programs that I need which are neither of these and this is when I turn to piracy! (and this is not my will, I only use it because my university insists that I use certain programs!!) Secondly.. I did not ask you for any pirated software! WHAT I ASKED is how long a perfectly legal program will take to run. As I said your argument is useless. Well Now Ill just use DBAN myself and see how long it takes rather than wasting the rest of my time arguing with you.

If you want to discuss DBAN, do that to avoid discussion locks. If you want to discuss justifying use of pirated goods then post that in another forum so you can get going on the topics. Bob
