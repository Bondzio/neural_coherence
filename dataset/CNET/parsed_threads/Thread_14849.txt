<s> are you talking about RAM or the hard drive. </s>
<s> I've never seen a memory test take 10 hours. </s>
<s> And are you sure about that link, it doesn't work. </s>
<s> www.memtest86.com yes try that one, its an iso bootable file, and it test the memory and in mine it takes about 10 hours, and not yet finish... i hope you can help.. is there another way how to fix my ram? </s>
<s> yes i already try it, but it takes me 10 hours, im busy so that i can waited that long... is the test can fix my RAM? </s>
<s> or there another way how to fix it? </s>
<s> Sorry, to fix the RAM you replace it with good RAM. </s>
<s> Today's RAM technology doesn't include the concept of being able to repair it. </s>

<s> you system RAM. </s>
<s> But after it's gone through a number of cycles called &quot;PASSES&quot;, it will show a problem or not. </s>
<s> It cannot 'FIX&quot; anything....it can only tell you if the RAM passes or does not pass all the RAM tests in the system it's installed in. </s>
<s> What results do you get from Memtest86+ after three passes ??? </s>

<s> Buy a compatible memory module of 512 or 1024 mb. </s>
<s> (You'll like the 1024) Turn the power off to the computer and open the cover. </s>
<s> Locate the ram and remove the old module by unlatching two small clips. </s>
<s> Once you have the old ram in your hand drift it into the trash. </s>
<s> Now install the new ram, carefully observing it is located properly (only one way it goes in slot). </s>
<s> Reassemble, power up and carry on. </s>
<s> many folks might take &quot;Turn the power off to the computer and open the cover.&quot; as just turning off the PC and we both know that 'power off' doesn't really disconnect power from the PC or MB. </s>
