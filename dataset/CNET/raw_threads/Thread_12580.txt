(Neil Polton) PLEASE HELP	I just ordered this to use with Time Machine on my iMac as a back up drive. I just read on the web it will not work as a back of drive. Can someone please tell me if this is correct or incorrect? I ordered the Neil Polton drive and it is scheduled to arrive in a couple of days. I really hope the info I just read on the web was wrong. Can someone please let me know if this will work as a back up drive using Time Machine or the included software with my iMac.

Good luck and it's about 99% sure it will be fine. Most complaints are simply 'pilot errrr'. Bob
