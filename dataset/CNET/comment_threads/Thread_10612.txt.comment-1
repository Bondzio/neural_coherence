I am looking for something UNDER $80.
I am also looking to have it completely wireless.
I am trying to boost my signal from my bedroom to my living room, so obviously I dont want to have to wire a ethernet cable from on end of my house to another... Do I need a new antenna?
Extender?
Acess Point?
There are so many options!
Please reccomend a SPECIFIC product.
