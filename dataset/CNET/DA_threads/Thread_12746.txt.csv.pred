1.1.1	I am running 10.5.8 on a MacBook Pro , using an HP Photosmart Premium all-in-one .	St
1.1.2	I just scanned a 38-page document - all type , no graphics - and it ended up being 217 mg. Obviously too big to mail or do anything with .	St
1.1.3	I tried to compress it , but it only compressed down to 117 mg. Any idea what I am doing wrong ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	I think you think this is text but it 's all graphics at this point .	St
1.2.2	If you wanted to put it to text you have a few choices .	St
1.2.3	1 .	St
1.2.4	Contact the owner of the document and ask for the word or text file version .	St
1.2.5	2 .	St
1.2.6	Run it through some OCR and correct it as you see fit .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	Sorry , I guess I did n't make myself clear .	St
1.3.2	All I want to do is scan a piece of paper ( doc ) to become a PDF so I can email it .	St
1.3.3	I do n't want to run it through OCR .	St
1.3.4	But for some reason the printer/scanner is scanning at 100MG instead of the typical 78kb .	St
1.3.5	The software for the scan function seems to have hit a glitch .	St
1.3.6	It is also showing the size of the doc as 22x30 & quot ; , not the page setting of 8x11 & quot ; .	St
1.3.7	I just thought someone else might have experienced this abnormality .	St
1.3.8	Thanks anyway .	St
1.4.1	When you scan a document the resulting file is a graphic , not text .	St
1.4.2	If you scan the document using the OCR function , then you get a text file .	St
1.4.3	It sounds like the 38 pages were scanned as a single page , not individual graphics , thus you get one long graphic .	St
1.4.4	I have used my HP multi-function printer to scan documents and have selected either the graphic output , or the text output .	St
1.4.5	If you select PDF output , it is still going to output the pages as graphic captures and not text .	St
1.4.6	The resolution you set for the scan will also affect the size of the output file in bytes and in inches .	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	make sure that your zoom level is at a acceptable aspect ratio in comparison with your screen resolution and the PDF	Sug
1.7.1	HP scanning software often defaults to a 24 bit color mode , even if you 're scanning black and white documents .	St
1.7.2	The scanner and its software ca n't determine what you 're scanning .	St
1.7.3	You have to set the requirements yourself .	St
1.7.4	If you just want to scan black & amp ; white text documents , there should be a setting in your scanning software that is labeled as such i.e. , & quot ; black & amp ; white , & quot ; or just , & quot ; text. & quot ; Avoid settings for , & quot ; 256 shades of gray , & quot ; unless you need it for some kind of black and white image , and avoid the OCR option unless you actually need to attempt text editing on the final document .	St
1.7.5	OCR recognition will only work well if you 're scanning very legible text and it will also add to the file size of the finished document .	St
1.7.6	Most of this should be in the Help menus of scanning software .	St
1.8.1	There should also be a setting in your scanning software to control the page size .	St
1.8.2	It may default to the maximum size of the scanner bed , but you need to tell it the size of your scanned document .	St
1.8.3	Once again , only you would know this .	St
