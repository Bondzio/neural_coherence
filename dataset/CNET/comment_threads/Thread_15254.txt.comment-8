Bob If you're still following this, I put my original question on another board at the same time as cnet.
A responder there wanted me to tell him my gateway IP (I assume he meant my default gateway), which I declined.
If I had sent that, is that enough info for someone to hack my LAN, assuming I wasn't behind my hardware/software firewalls?
Thanks again
