It is on the 2nd floor of my home. I have a device which has always had trouble with wireless connections (it is built in hardware I can't swap out). It does however have an Ethernet port. Is there a way to get a wireless router to receive the wireless signal from my Fios modem/router? I would then hardwire the router to my device so that this device can finally get online. Thanks!

The computers connect to it directly, by wireless. I also have a Cisco Wireless/Ethernet router, and have been wondering if I could get it back in the game by making a wireless connection between it and the DSL modem. Any thoughts on that?
