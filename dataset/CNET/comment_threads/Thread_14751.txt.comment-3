Thanks for the reply.
I did not prepare it as you mentioned.
How do I partition and format the blank drive?
When I plug it in, the PC makes the sound that it recognizes something was plugged in, but no drive appears in the Computer folder.
Thanks again any help is appreciated.
FYI I have a Dell that uses Windows Vista.
