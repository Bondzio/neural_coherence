i was having this same issue.
what i figured out was by using &quot;safely remove hardware&quot;, i was basically turning off that drive.
problem was it didn't come back until i rebooted.
my work around was to skip the &quot;safely remove&quot; and just wait a few minutes for the memory card to finish it's work before removing from the slot.
that took care of the problem.
