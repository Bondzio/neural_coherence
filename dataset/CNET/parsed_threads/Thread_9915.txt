<s> I am looking for a server to back up all my computers and to store all the media files for my HTPC. </s>

<s> I am not interested in building a NAS server, I want a small server to fit on my already cluttered desk. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> I am looking for a server that has at least 4 bays for digital backup of my media that can also run utorrent that is easy to use and setup. </s>
<s> I also followed your advice and found several replies you did stating the same thing over and over again about this not being a storage device. </s>
<s> So next time if you do not have any good advice or suggestion to add for my request for help and please keep it to yourself. </s>
<s> I am looking for assistance not criticism. </s>

<s> Let's try something rather new and lower power. </s>
<s> I picked up the Walmart 228 buck netbook. </s>
<s> When the screen is on, it measures a meager 15 Watts on the Watt meter and 9 Watts when the screen turns off and it is still running. </s>
<s> Now put your torrent on that and add some nice 4 bay drive like http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=4323356&sku=G15-1038&srkey=GMG 4500MGB-4Bay-Raid-Pro NAS Enclosure Of course you don't need the netbook with that. </s>
<s> Here I use the netbook along with a trio of USB drives which run SYNCBACK for safety. </s>

<s> Sorry if I offended you it was not what I wanted to do. </s>
<s> I know you are a moderator and you probably do it on your own time which I am very thankful for. </s>
<s> Now I already own a netbook but I use it way to much to let it become a server. </s>
<s> I have to admit that I never thought of doing that either. </s>
<s> I did some research on some servers like the Acer Easystore uses the same type of processor as my netbook but has more ram and probably uses more watts. </s>
<s> The only server I every used was the one at my work. </s>
<s> I thought it would be a great project to do. </s>
<s> I will look into the GMG 4500 and read the reviews on it. </s>
<s> Thank you for you help. </s>
