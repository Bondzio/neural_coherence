1.1.1	I 've been reading a lot and there is a lot of discussion about what power supply is required to power various components .	St
1.1.2	Can somebody tell me whether the power supply draws power at its rated wattage or whether that is just the maximum and the power used depends on the components .	St
1.1.3	For example , if you have a case that comes supplied with a 430W PSU , but you only need ( say ) a 300W supply to power your components , will you be using more electricity than if you got a 300W PSU , or just the same ?	Ques
1.2.1	While the efficiency of the power supply may play a role in actual power being used , the power consumed will depend on the components that you have installed and what you are doing with them .	St
1.2.2	A power supply rating of 500w versus one rated at 300w is usually a representative of the capability not what it is using .	St
1.2.3	If you are thinking that a smaller rating will save you electricity , then you are looking at the wrong place .	St
1.2.4	In order to save on the power being used , you need to remove components that you are not using ( NOT recommended ) .	St
1.2.5	Do not worry about it .	St
1.2.6	Changing computers internals to save energy is not an acceptable practice by most .	St
1.3.1	Thanks - I am looking at putting a computer together .	St
1.3.2	It will only be relatively low-power , but different cases come with different PSU 's supplied .	St
1.3.3	I did n't want to get one with a higher capacity one if all it was going to do was chew up electricity for no reason , but if it does n't actually use more then it does n't matter so much which case I get .	St
1.4.1	This topic has been discussed before here and elsewhere .	St
1.4.2	The basic conclusion is that for a & quot ; stable & dependable output & quot ; you need a PSU capable of delivering now and later for your needs .	St
1.4.3	You can always buy what you can afford , but sticking too closely for a cheap or very low wattage psu will cost in the end .	St
1.4.4	All too often , when a psu does go poof , it may take other componets/devices with it and/or be the source of a possible electrical fire .	St
1.4.5	So take care in selection and having more wattage than your needs is n't going to hurt as if carrying an extra few $ when going Xmas shopping .	St
1.4.6	There 's a reason for so many PSU 's being offered as std .	St
1.4.7	or typical psu will fail or be & quot ; out-grown & quot ; before system life .	St
1.4.8	Its just a safe bet to get a decent psu more than capable of handling your needs , low-wattage or not .	St
1.4.9	Use the & quot ; forum search mode & quot ; to access the forums for similar topic .	St
1.4.10	enjoy tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.5.1	without PSUs and PSUs without cases .	St
1.5.2	As it pertains to PCs , it always pays to err on the side of quality and power .	St
1.5.3	Poor quality usually means earlier failure , potentially erratic computer behavior and warranty replacement hassles .	St
1.5.4	From this end ... a situation to be avoided whenever and wherever possible .	St
1.5.5	VAPCMD PS ... and do n't overlook PSU efficiency ... the higher the PSU efficiency the less electricity your system will actually use .	St

1.6.1	Thanks .	Polite
1.6.2	I had searched but not found the answer to my specific question .	St
1.6.3	My needs are low and they 'll stay low - I 'm not a user who 'll be wanting to install fancy graphics cards or high-power items .	St
1.6.4	Pretty much the basics will be installed and that 'll be it .	St
1.6.5	As long as having more & quot ; just in case & quot ; is n't going to result in wasted power , I may end up getting a higher wattage unit , but I did n't want to get it if all I was doing was getting a power hog for probably no benefit .	St
1.7.1	But , the separate cases and PSUs seem to work out ( much ) more expensive , and the bundled Antecs at my local suppliers seem to come with the & quot ; Earthwatts & quot ; PSUs but the separate ones do n't seem to be those ones .	St
1.7.2	I wanted to get the Earthwatts one , as I gather they are the energy efficient type .	St
1.7.3	I think I 've pretty much decided what to get ( although I 'll probably change my mind again LOL ) Thanks for the help .	St
1.8.1	Here 's a review you might be interested to read about the Antec Earthwatts EA500 ... looks good .	St
1.8.2	PSU 's like this are n't usually bundled with cases .	St
1.8.3	http : //www.jonnyguru.com/review_details.php ? id=51 Careful and do n't look at the Corsair PSUs ... they 're the new kid on the PSU block made by a major mfg ( Seasonic ) and they 're getting knockout ratings everywhere .	St
1.8.4	.	St
1.8.5	.	St
1.8.6	5 year warranty included on the ones ' I 've seen .	St
1.8.7	BTW ... energy efficient too ... but maybe not as high as the Antec Earthwatt series..80plus .	St
1.9.1	The ones that are bundled will be fine for me - I wo n't even have a separate graphics card , and I 'm looking at getting a low-powered CPU .	St
1.9.2	Thanks for the info .	St
1.10.1	the Antec Earthwatts PSU at the jonnyguru.com website .	St
1.10.2	VAPCMD	St
1.11.1	I use nothing but 500 or more Watt PSUs even in my 20 Watt CPU based server .	St
1.11.2	There is no loss here but it does help it ride out some short AC power losses .	St
1.11.3	Bob	St
1.12.1	Definitely a power consumed depends on it 's rating that 's why it is marked.Look the general power rating is calculated as P=VIcos* , where * is the angle to which voltage or current lags or leads each other.Incase of integrated devices the load depends on the bias of the semi-conductor chip used.Once the component is overloaded forward biased route is replaced by a reverse biased stream and hence excess of electricity used.And as for unwanted components , yes it is to be removed asap .	St
1.13.1	I thought you meant the 500W was n't bundled , because the ones I 've been looking at have the Earthwatts bundled - one has 430W and the other 380W ( I think - the case is the worst thing to pick out )	St
