<s> Hi, I have a desktop with a motherboard that has DDR2 ram on it. </s>
<s> I would like to know if i can mix and match DDR2 and DDR3 ram or will it work if i just switch to DDR3? </s>
<s> All help is GREATLY appreciated! </s>
<s> I don't think so. </s>
<s> DDR3 is so much cheaper. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Very few machines support both on the motherboard at the same time. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, a video or other card may use other types or RAM. </s>

<s> some systems or motherboards that are specifically designed to accept either DDR2 or DDR3... the Biostar TP43E.is one example. </s>
<s> Bottom line it depends on your specific system....but highly highly unlikely for most systems. </s>
