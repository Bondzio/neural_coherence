perhaps not together.
To be sure the motherboard works with processors running at different speed and RAM running at different speeds however, the system is designed to use processors and RAM that go together like for your Athlon 3000 would normally use PC3200/DDR400 ....not DDR266.
If you used a different processor running at a different clock speed .... maybe the system would boot right up.
Even if the system would run with the CPU and RAM combo you have, you'd still lose a lot of performance because of the slower RAM speed.
If able....I'd pick up some DDR400 like the Corsair ValuSelect CAS2.5 at Newegg (link below)...it's about $75.00 plus shipping for a kit containing 2 x 512MBs DIMMs total 1GB to take advantage of the dual channel memory architecture.
