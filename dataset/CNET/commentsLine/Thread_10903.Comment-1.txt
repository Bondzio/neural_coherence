hi.
i want to build a desktop pc.
mostly for word processing and surfing the internet, but one that could handle games in a pinch (but not really for that purpose).
i want to use a intel chip and a motherboard that supports intel chips and i am on a budget.
i don't need the latest super dooper, but i would like a machine that will be viable for maybe four (4) years or so.
also, what recommendations on cases would the forum have.
thank you.
