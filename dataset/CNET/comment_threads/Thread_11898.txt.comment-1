Hey guys,My computer has been working fine, but the other day i opened it up and pulled out the power supply to see what wattage it had (just bought it and curious).
I did not disconnect it to anything else in the computer, just unscrewed it from the back so i could slide it over and see the sticker on the side.
I put it all back but now the power button on the outside of the case you normally use to turn the computer on is not working.
The only way i can turn on the computer right now is by opening it up, and pressing the power button on my motherboard.
Everything else works perfectly.
1) So why is the outside power button not working?
2) what should i do to fix this?
Any help would be thoroughly appreciated -WooDy
