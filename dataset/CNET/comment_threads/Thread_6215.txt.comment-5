Sorry about the late post.
The question was what to do about a failing hard drive.
If it still works get a good backup program (I use one from Paragon Software) and copy the entire drive to a new hard drive.
As long as you use the same machine the seconddrive works perfectly, it is identical to the origional.
Have your old drive in the master of the primary IDE Cable (0 hard drive), put the second on the master of the # Ide Cable (1 Hard Drive).
Then just clone the thing.
If you use Paragon Drive Backup check the setting in the software that for some reason defaults the new drive as a hidden drive.
If you don't change the setting the new drive is invisible to the computer (this is probably for backup securtiy.
Make sure you instruct the software to copy the whole drive and resize as needed.
