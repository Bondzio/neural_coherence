Im sorry, it says &quot;cannot find the operating system&quot;.
I just changed the hard drive, this one is used 10 gig IBM Quantum.
Not sure if it has operating system loaded or not but I would guess so.
I want to reformat and tried to put 2000 pro booting from cd and It went through process and in partition it said to quit.
