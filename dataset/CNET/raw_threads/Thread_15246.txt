Specs: AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4600+2.7ghz Nvidia 7800 SLi 256mb, 2 gb ram, 430 watt PSU, and Windows xp Pro. So my computer has been overheating and freezing for awhile, I had gone through many steps to find out the problem by reinstalling software, reconnecting hardware, cleaning dust (found a bed of dust on heat sink but got rid of it) and bought a new PSU (430 watt) but still to no avail. I just ran a stress test from Prime95 and set it full fft's, and it was running at 100% CPU usage and it's froze within a minute. After, I checked it's temp and it was at 76c, motherboard was fine 40c. All the fans are functioning. It just overheats when using a lot of power, like when burning a cd, playing a graphics intensive game, or simply watching a video. Most times it ends up at 58c from the boot up, to 80c right when you start using a lot of power. is it possibly a hardware failure? Please offer any suggestions on what to do if you can. Thank You
