<s> My computer won't power up and it's likely that the issue is either the power supply or motherboard. </s>
<s> The computer is old and not worth fixing. </s>
<s> My fiance is a classical pianist and all of his performance recordings are on the hard drive (no, I don't know why he didn't have them backed up somewhere else). </s>
<s> I would rather not go through the hassle of installing that hard drive as a secondary hard drive in another computer because of it's age. </s>
<s> Once I have the files off of it, I have no further need of it. </s>
<s> I read someone else's post about a similar issue where they said you could hook the hard drive up to the new computer's CD drive (not an actual &quot;new&quot; computer, just a different computer than the dead one), copy the files and re-install the CD. </s>
<s> This sounds like it should be easier and quicker. </s>
<s> Can anyone confirm if this is a viable method? </s>
<s> Also, are there any other ways to accomplish this task that would work better? </s>
<s> I want to do this as quickly and cheaply as possible. </s>
<s> Thanks so much for all of your help. </s>
<s> The other thing which I want to point out is to look at the jumper setting of the cd-rom drive and set the harddrive the same. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
