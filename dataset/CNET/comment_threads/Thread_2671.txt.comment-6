Plainly put I have no quest to find out what you need to know.
You need to do the legwork in what works using XYZ part with your OEM parts.
Generic cases are flexibe to install typical generic mtrbd.
but OEMs put a slant into thier parts.
They may work they may not, as far I know no one has placed a help guide to say &quot;this OEM&quot; part will work or not in XYZ generic system case.
Also, what may work for some OEM system may not apply to another OEM system of a later date from the same company.
Confusing, you bet.
