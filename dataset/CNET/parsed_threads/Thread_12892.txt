<s> i was wondering which processor is better. </s>
<s> the 64 4000+ or the X2 4200+, if the 4000+ is better then would it be better to get the 64 3800+? </s>
<s> The 4000+ is only a bit cheaper that the 4200+. </s>
<s> The X2 4200 is certainly better than a non-X2 4000. and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> you want to try and get dual core if u can but the x2 4200+ runs very hot i have it in my computer and it works great but it has some major heating issues... this is actually my second 4200+ the first fried from overheating. </s>
<s> Do you have a PC manufactured by Gateway, HP or someother company or have you designed your own system. </s>
<s> I was wondering how these systems were working and if there were any problems. </s>
<s> I'm thinking about purchasing an X2 or Pentium D based system. </s>
<s> I'm also wondering about Sony, HP etc. </s>
<s> After using my Sony Notebook w/PII for over six years with out a problem and My P4 1.5 Sony Desktop for the last 5 years. </s>
<s> I purchased a Compaq Notebook w a 64bit AMD I have nothing against AMD but am not happy with the noteboods quality, ie: the transformer power cord falls out of the back of the computer. </s>
<s> I've also had to replace the transformer after one year. </s>
<s> My Sony notebook never had one problem. </s>
<s> Send me any feedback you can. </s>
<s> ...especially HP. </s>
<s> I've had tons of problems with it overheating and shutting down. </s>
<s> I put it in a new, bigger case with better airflow, and it still shut down randomly. </s>
<s> I gave it to another nerd that I know, and he tried another P4 in it, and had to shut it down because the CPU reached like 200 degrees Farenheit. </s>
<s> He put my chip (P4 540; 3.2GHz) on his motherboard, and it shut down on him as he was reinstalling Windows. </s>
<s> The comptuer was an overstock, so there's no warranty. </s>
<s> So far, I've paid $76 for the case and $60 to the nerd. </s>
<s> I'll probably have to spend about $300 to replace the CPU and motherboard, and another $50 to replace the crappy no-name-brand power supply (if a power supply fails, the system goes; bad). </s>
<s> Lesson learned: $h!t happens, and sometimes you're the one paying for it. </s>
<s> Also, I'm never buying another comptuer; from now on, I'm building my own. </s>
<s> i am going to get the Antec P180 as my case and to cool the CPU a Thermaltake Big Typhoon or mini Typhoon. </s>
<s> Will the Big Typhoon or Mini Typhoon cool the X2 4200+ enough? </s>
<s> i got the temp to go down by replacing the 92 fan in the back with two highpowered 80's </s>
<s> the mini typhoon is getting somewhat so-so reviews (only a bit better cooling than the amd stock hs/fan). </s>
<s> if you want a quieter system, it'll do that; but if you want a quieter and cooler system, look elsewhere. </s>
<s> have you consider arctic cooling's freezer 64 pro? </s>
<s> well i would suggest that if its for gaming get the 4000+ well get the x2 4200+ for mutimedia etc.but u must get a least water cooling if u get the x2 4200+. </s>
<s> ...because I've put it in a new case with an 80mm front fan, and a 120mm rear fan. </s>
<s> i wasnt replying to your post nathan. </s>
<s> i was replying to the one u replyed too. </s>
<s> look at the thread. </s>
<s> I don't think that there is a need for water cooling if a fan can do the job. </s>
<s> It's a waste of money and personally it takes up to much room in the Pc case, and wateer cooling is to fiddly. </s>
<s> Especially with an AMD X2! </s>
<s> AMD features their 'cool 'n' quiet' technology which does indeed keep things cool and quiet. </s>
<s> Unless you're going to lock the multiplier and overclock, etc, there shouldn't be any problems with overheating on the stock HSF, unless you've got some other issues going on. </s>
<s> (Incidentally, I hear that the new HSFs that AMD is sending out with their CPUs are pretty decent and that spending 50 bucks to replace it with an aftermarket HSF is a waste of 50 bucks.) </s>
<s> One of my PCs is an HP with a 4200 X2, an ATI graphics card, a 400W PSU and a little more memory- everything else is stock. </s>
<s> I've had no problems with the system, even with moderate ('very high' settings, not the highest settings) gaming. </s>
