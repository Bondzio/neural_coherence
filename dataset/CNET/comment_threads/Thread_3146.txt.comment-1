Vista has been shoved down our throats after the appetizers of crapware and everything else.
First thing I would do is complete format and clean install of XP on my system or just build my own.
Gateway wanted to charge an additional $49 to &quot;upgrade&quot; from Vista to Windows XP on a new system.
The customer service rep became extremely confused when I asked him why anyone would pay for, and how XP magically became an &quot;upgrade&quot; from Vista as opposed to a down-grade.
It's to the point that it's just almost funny that the pc user and consumer are now considered the lower 1 percent on the intellectual scale!
