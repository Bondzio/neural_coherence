Or do you already have a good monitor or speakers that you wish to add to a computer box that you will build? BTW, congratulations on taking on this challenge. I find it is quite rewarding to build a new machine. I trust you will, also.

I have chosen all of my hardware which includes an AMD X2 processor, Asus motherboard, Western Digital SATA hard drive, Sony DVD-RW etc.. My main concert at the moment is making sure I buy all of the cables I require. The harddrives and optical drives that I have priced up are OEM so I wont recieve the cables like I would in a retail box. Also not sure about the motherboard having cables packaged with it. Does anyone have or know the where about of a checklist of some description that I can use to make sure I have everything I need before I start. I'd hate to of started to find i was missing simple things.

Look carefully at the description of the motherboard. It should say which cables are included.
