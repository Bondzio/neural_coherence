1.1.4	I 've been reading a lot of articles stating that you should go with AMD 64 3800+ for gaming , but also a lot of articles are saying that get an INTEL P4 3.4 , cos they do all of that with easy + they offer DDR 2 memory which is the best according to these web-sites I 've been reading as of late .

1.2.1	I suggest getting an amd , because even with ddr2 , the onboard memory controller , hypertransport with dual-channel ddr pc3200 memory will still beat intel with its ddr2 .	St
1.2.2	Keep in mind nothing 's future proof , amd already has new socket M2 on the drawing boards .	St
