I haven't been able to use it it in about 2 yrs. Is there a tool I can download to have the scanner work on Vista? The disk would not work when I fist got Vista and now I need to use it.

Does this mean below only if 3970 was installed on Vista, which it didn't work on any? System requirements: Recommended: Uninstall any previous software/driver for your scanner

I'm not that computer smart. I just want to download a tool...if it works good, if not well it just doesn't work.

Since you have another scanner, must this scanner be brought back? And also look at what HP offered. It's a &quot;basic&quot; driver so who knows (they don't tell and I don't own this scanner) if they enabled the backlight for the film accessory or not. Maybe this needs a test on another machine or you to learn if System Restore on XP, Vista is functional on your machine. Bob

The last time I tried to use it would not power up, any way to get the power start? I know, but I can use the scanner :)I'm trying to get pictures from some slides with out sending the slide off for a week or two.

I can't tell you exactly what and which part to change to suspect here. Hut with XP and Vista we do have System Restore to fall back on if you want to install that driver. -&gt; But first, Norton and some other antivirus programs or suites can have you do one more thing to get System Restore (SR) to work. Here's a search about that issue -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=NORTON+SYSTEM+RESTORE&aq=f&oq=&aqi= Hope that helps, Bob

If for some reason you did run into a problem after installation, you can always use Windows System Restore to roll your PC back to a time before the installation.

Thanks for reading the post. As always everyone is so helpful....I love coming to this forum, it's the BEST!
