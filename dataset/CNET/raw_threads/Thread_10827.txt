Now my question is has anybody ever hooked up bookshelf spreakers or any other speakers to this system? If so, how did it sound? I have two JBL62 speakers laying around that have a 6&quot; woofer and a 1&quot; tweeter and probably are better than the Klipsch satellites. How well would this work?

I'd rate them as OK but not terrific. My primary speakers are an old pair of JBL L65 Jubals bought in the '70s. They make the 62Ts sound like a budget boom box from Walmart. Believe it or not, I also have a set of Klipsch Promedia 2.1s connected to my PC. I think there is more than one version of these. Mine have a black and orange plastic oval near the bottom that says Klipsch THX. If you have these same speakers, I'd say leave them alone. I wouldn't consider trying to connect them to the satellite wiring. They work well with the sub woofer. I don't see what a couple more small woofers are going to add and I also doubt that the signal from the sub woofer would be properly equalized to power other low frequency speakers. I doubt that's what you're looking for but can't offer much encouragement here.

I'm also finding out that the sub can't take much at anything close to half volume. Am I missing a setting or something? I'm wondering if my JBL 62 speakers can replace the Klipsch speakers so it doesn't distort on me.

If you bought them &quot;as is&quot;, the distortion could be a blown speaker (loose coil), bad volume control potentiometer or something as simple as loose hardware inside. Somethings you can find and fix this. Replacing the satellites is going to mean cutting and splicing some wire and dealing with the volume controls for both the satellites and the sub. You'd have to fabricate some method of doing this. I seriously doubt that you'll get better sound from the old JBLs than from a good working Klipsch outfit. As for the sub woofer volume setting, I run the dial no higher than 9 to 10 oclock or bass tends to get muddy. Most all of these systems will do this. The extra power generated by its amplifier was never intended to allow you max out the volume controls. It's there for damping and such to improve the accuracy of the speaker by controlling its travel. I really like my Klipsch speakers and hope you get your problem resolved.
