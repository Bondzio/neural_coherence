<s> I just purchased a Core i7 gaming pc from Visualdreamers.com. </s>
<s> Right from the start, I received great customer service on what components would work best for me. </s>
<s> The specs on the computer I built are as follows. </s>
<s> Lian Li Full Tower Chassis (HUGE, I didnt realize how big it was) Core i7 920 (overclocked for free to 3.8) 1000w corsair modular power supply Asus Rampage 2 Extreme Aftermarket Fans / Heatsink 6 GB OCZ Reaper 1866 DDR3 Ram Nvidia GTX 295 WD Velociraptor 300gb DVD Burner w/ lightscribe I also had the chassis custom painted Audi Blue. </s>
<s> Its amazing looking, and is very durable. </s>
<s> It only cost 99 bucks, I was expecting it to be cheap paint but its full blown high quality stuff. </s>
<s> I couldnt be happier with my purchase. </s>
<s> Just wanted to give them the thumbs up on a job well done. </s>
<s> Anyone else have any experiences with them ? </s>
<s> SCAM! </s>
<s> This company is a lie and a scam. </s>
<s> The reviewer is fake! </s>
<s> If you want to order game currency.....I mean computers...common guys, use your head. </s>

<s> visualdreamers llc is a properly registered business based in ohio and its address is located in an office park. </s>
<s> from the photo on google streetview, they could indeed be a small custom pc maker. </s>
<s> ohio business filing listing the link you posted is from 2005 but visualdreamers llc was listed in 2007. domain names get bought all the time and all the &quot;bad press&quot; about them stems from that 4 year old post about the domain name. </s>
<s> now i do believe the original post here and many other posts on various forms are self-promotion by the company since they all read about the same and were posted by folks who just joined the forums. </s>
<s> but trying to draw folks to your product and &quot;scam&quot; are two different things. </s>
