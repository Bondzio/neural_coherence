If this is an LCD monitor there are other causes for flickering.
The noted problem of the back-light or its invertor voltage PCB going bad is a prior example.
Some repairs like re-touching the solder area may help due to poor manufacturing.
However, if as Robert stated, costs become too much or gets too involved and depending on your skills, it maybe better just to move on.
You want to play, go ahead.
You could order parts if some PCB or IC, etc., but often enough, the costs of another working 1702 maybe cheaper.
Just my thoughts.... tada -----Willy
