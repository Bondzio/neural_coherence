<s> I have a 64GB microSD. </s>
<s> I try to transfer folders from my PC to the SD card, and it does. </s>
<s> However, when I open a folder, there are no files inside. </s>
<s> I formatted my sd card to fat32. </s>
<s> Many PC card readers are only good to 2GB, then 32GB and beyond that it gets to be a support headache. </s>

<s> I already formatted my micro SD from exFAT to FAT32. </s>
<s> I'll transfer folders to my SD card and from there the majority of files in the folder is not there. </s>
<s> In your first post you write &quot;However, when I open a folder, there are no files inside.&quot; Now you write &quot; the majority of files in the folder is not there.&quot; FAT32 on 64GB cards is not a good idea. </s>
<s> You may be repeating what others have learned. </s>
<s> My example link is where they didn't tell why they did that. </s>

<s> Okay well I re-formatted my micro sd to exFAT. </s>
<s> I'm trying to add about 20gb worth of data onto my SD card. </s>
<s> It'll transfer about 4.10gb but the rest won't get transferred. </s>
<s> I've done chkdsk, and it tells me that nothing is wrong with my card. </s>
<s> I've run into this with deep folders, too many files in the root folder and the old FAT vs NTFS file name issue. </s>
<s> Now that we are back to exFAT that should remove the filename issue. </s>
<s> Reference http://www.ntfs.com/ntfs_vs_fat.htm As it stands it should work baring issues with permissions on the source. </s>
<s> Try SycnBack to copy instead. </s>
<s> It will report what failed to copy and maybe why. </s>
<s> -&gt; Example. </s>
<s> A new user tried to copy C: (all files) to an external. </s>
<s> They were perplexed at the missing files. </s>
<s> For that copy, yes, there is going to be a lot of missing files. </s>
