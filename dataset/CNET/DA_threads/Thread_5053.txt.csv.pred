1.1.1	Hello, I have been trying to play games like call of duty 2 and doom 3 and they run really slow and choppy.	St
1.1.2	I took this system requirements test and my graphics card was the only thing that failed the test.	St
1.1.3	So my question is if I want to upgrade a graphics card, can i just upgrade to any graphics card or does it matter what my pc specs are?	Ques
1.1.4	I have a Pentium 4, 3.06 ghz, 896 RAM, 146 GB hard drive, ATI RADEON EXPRESS 200, and i have a PCI express slot.	St
1.2.1	Get a card with as much RAM as you can afford, and make sure it'll fit/is designed for PCI Express.	St
1.2.2	Do you have an AGP slot?	St
1.2.3	If so, maybe a better choice.	St
1.3.1	but just because it has more doesn't mean it's better.	St
1.3.2	The memory interface is just as important if not more.	St
1.3.3	For example my system came with a 7300LE turbocache card listed as 256MB.	St
1.3.4	It was configured to use 512MB.64bit memory interface.	St
1.3.5	Most half decent cards now are true 256MB cards with a 128bit memory interface.	St
1.3.6	The higher-end cards are 256MB+ with 256bit+ memory interfaces.	St
