i can safely bet that 99 out of 100 systems if i see some pentium e series dual core and find the intel i3 for the same buck the i3 will be the better choice.
not only do you usually get the better ddr3 but the i3 has hyperthreading and shows up as 4 cores which translates into quite a speed gain even for mundane things.
the i3 also is your &quot;green&quot; choice with better energy use.
however i expect the older pentium dual core e series prices to continue to plummet as that model is for the very price sensitive end of the market.
