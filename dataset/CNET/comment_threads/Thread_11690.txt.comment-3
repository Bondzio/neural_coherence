the trendnet router and adapter card both offer WPA2 AND WPA.
I am using WPA because I just couldn't get everything to work when I tried to set up WPA2.
I would however like to have that option with whatever wireless adapter I end up with.
I am assuming that if the router I have is &quot;54Mbps&quot; I would have to get an adapter with the same MBPS?
A higher Mbps would not have an advantage?
Or would I need to know what my service provider is?
