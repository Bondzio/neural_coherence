lhen123, there is no way they should be trying to blame the poor quality on you using a mac and adobe... if anything, you should be getting better results than someone using say office programs since you have more control over your initial file resolution and are likely using vector files also.
unless there are some settings that aren't input correctly, i really don't see how what they are saying could be true.
ask to speak to people higher in the chain on the phone and see if you get a different response.
also try calling a local oki dealer and technician who might be able to help more.
