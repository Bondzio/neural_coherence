1.5.1	since about 1999-2000 is when nVidia and ATi started using DDR 3dfx was just about ready to make the jump , and then ... they folded but the memory on the graphics card does n't affect the system memory as the CPU/chipset is n't controlling the gfx RAM , the gfx card is GeForce FX 5800 and XGI Volari V8 Duo cards use DDR-II and work in SDRAM , RDRAM , and DDR systems and all the newer cards use DDR-3 and it works in SDRAM , RDRAM , DDR and DDR2 systems but most graphics cards still use DDR and it works fine with SDRAM , RDRAM , DDR and DDR2 equipped systems and I can even vouch for it working , I had a Pentium 4 which used SDRAM in the system , and DDR on both an FX 5200 and GeForce4 MX zero issues ( now the system was slower than a dog due to the SDRAM ( SDRAM is horrible for a Pentium4 , it provides it hardly enough memory bandwidth , but the GPU in no way affects this ) )	St
