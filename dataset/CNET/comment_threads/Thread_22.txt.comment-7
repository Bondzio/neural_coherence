Hi, thanks for clarification... i was researching a lot and came to a conclusion that for my needs the P4 will be a better choice.
First treason is that the Buss speed is higher than Xeons (800Mhz compared to 533)the memory is supposed to be better (dual channel), the hard drive is bigger (160GB compared to 36.4 but 10K PRM), and ofcourse the price tag is lower.
So i'm gonna go with XW4100.
But thanks again -Ibrahim.
