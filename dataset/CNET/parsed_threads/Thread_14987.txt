<s> Hi everyone Something odd happened last night. </s>
<s> My PC has been working fine since I built it last Christmas but suddenly got stuck with the cursor stuck on the egg timer icon. </s>
<s> I couldn't get the cursor to move to the start button for a reboot as it would reach the task bar and go no further so I used the windows key to bring up the start menu and rebooted the computer using the keyboard shortcuts. </s>
<s> So far so good, but when the computer restarted the monitor remained blank and after about 20 seconds switched to standby as it wasn't receiving a signal from the PC. </s>
<s> I checked the connections and all seemed to be secure so i tried again but with the same result. </s>
<s> I noticed there was hard disk activity though, but this stopped after a while. </s>
<s> It was as though the computer was booting for some reason the data wasn't reaching the monitor. </s>
<s> I don't have a spare monitor to check this out for myself so before I go to elaborate arrangements to get a lift to a friend's house and check on their monitor, I wodnered if anyone had encountered this before. </s>
<s> I'm only guessing the PC is booting but I really have no idea what's happened. </s>
<s> Can anyone shed any light? </s>
<s> Cliff Athlon 64 processor 512 MB RAM 200 Gig hard drive On-board video and sound Sharp 17&quot; LCD monitor </s>
<s> Power supply? </s>
<s> Too many skimp on the size and pay for it later. </s>
<s> Does the system beep? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It's a 450 watt PSU and there's hardly anything connected to it. </s>
<s> No beeps I'm afraid. </s>
<s> Cliff </s>
<s> Try the bare minimum parts for beeps. </s>
<s> Power supply (450 is a good number, so let's leave that), motherboard, CPU and the speaker. </s>
<s> No other parts are required. </s>
<s> If no beeps, then remove the case and put it on cardboard. </s>
<s> No beeps? </s>
<s> You are looking at the possible bad parts. </s>
<s> Just FYI, the bad part may not be defective. </s>
<s> For instance some machines don't boot when the CMOS battery is dead. </s>
<s> Or if a jumper is in the wrong place. </s>
<s> Or when the CMOS values are wildly off. </s>
<s> Try ... Resetting the BIOS settings with that jumper... Bob </s>
