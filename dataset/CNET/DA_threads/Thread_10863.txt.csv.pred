1.1.1	Hey all, I have (3) 500GB Hard drives.	St
1.1.2	I am trying to find a SATA Controller card that supports Raid 0 (stripping) with a hotspare.	St
1.1.3	If i remember correctly this is Raid 5.	St
1.1.4	Can anyone here reccomend a card that will do this.	St
1.1.5	I can't seem to find one out there.	St
1.1.6	Thank you	St
1.2.1	http://www.tomshardware.com/2004/06/25/cheap_and_reliable_raid_5_storage_compared/page2.html Fast forward to today and the story hasn't changed much.	St
1.2.2	Still the same name and the article covers it all.	St
1.3.1	awesome!	St
1.3.2	Thanks for the reply.	St
1.3.3	By reading some of the articles, it looks like Raid 5 does support 3 disks.	St
1.3.4	I was worried that I would need a minimum of 4.	St
1.3.5	Now I'm going to do some digging and see what one i should buy.	St
1.3.6	They tested a few but Im still not quite sure if all of the controllers out there support only 3 drives for raid 5.	St
1.3.7	Only reason im worried is because the controller thats built onto my mother board doesnt support 3; you have to use 4 drives.	St
