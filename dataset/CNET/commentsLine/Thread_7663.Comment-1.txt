i have had a dell inspiron 1300 notebook for almost a year which i primarily use to surf the web and send and receive emails.
a few days ago i purchased quicken basic 2007 and installed it on the notebook.
at the end of the day when i close out my quicken i'm prompted to back up my data.
i haven't backed it up yet but would like to do so.
on an old desktop pc i used floppies to back up my quicken data.
this dell notebook doesn't have a floppy drive but i could buy an external floppy drive to use to back up the quicken data but are there other ways available to back up the data?
easier; less expensive ways to back up the data?
