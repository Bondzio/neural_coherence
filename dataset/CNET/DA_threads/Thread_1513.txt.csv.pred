1.1.1	Hi all , I 'm going to be upgrading my mobo to an asus A8N SLI PREMIUM NVIDIA .	St
1.1.2	This board seems to fit my needs for gaming , but , I prefer ATI crossfire gpu , my gut feeling is that while both use pcie16 , that nvidia sli ready board wo n't allow the ati card to work properly .	St
1.1.3	Not that Nvidia is n't a great card , it 's really just preference , if I had to , I would use Nvidia .	St
1.1.4	I 'll be running an AMD Athlon 64 x2 4800 with 2 gigs of dual channel ddr2 ram .	St
1.1.5	Any thoughts ...	Polite
1.2.1	It IS possible to run ATI X-Fire on an SLI motherboard , through driver hacks , and the like .	St
1.2.2	Even though it can be done , I would n't attempt it .	St
1.2.3	A single ATI card will work fine on an SLI motheboard , though .	St
1.2.4	If you want X-Fire , why not just get an X-Fire board ?	Ques
1.2.5	Also , I was n't aware that AMD made an X2 4800+ for socket AM2 .	St
1.3.1	Maybe I read it wrong , but the mobo I was looking at was a 939 socket ... now I 'm wondering ...	St
1.4.1	so you 're cool .	Polite
1.4.2	like nathan said , if you want to use 2 radeons faster than x1600pro , then get a crossfire ( ati chipset ) motherboard .	St
1.5.1	I 've always had good luck building from the ground up with asus mobo 's , all the one 's that i 've seen with a 939 socket were sli ready , unless , maybe nathan was right about this , that crossfire ready was only for am2 socket , that 's possible , got ta go to tiger D and check that ...	St
1.6.1	teach me how to wallhack please ^_^	Sug
