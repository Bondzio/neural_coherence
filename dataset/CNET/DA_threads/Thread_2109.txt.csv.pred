1.1.1	I 'm using a Netgear MS2110 network storage unit , said to support hot-swapping of its HDDs .	St
1.1.2	It currently has two 2TB hard drives and is configured as RAID1 .	St
1.1.3	My question is , if I want to upgrade to two 4TB drives ( maintaining the same RAID config ) , is it simply a matter of replacing one of the hard drives with the larger capacity one , and when the data has been mirrored across to that new larger drive , then replacing the other drive , so I end up with the two 4TB drives with all the original data ?	Ques
1.1.4	If this is essentially possible , are there any traps that may result in data being lost in this transfer ?	Ques
1.1.5	Cheers , Brian	St
