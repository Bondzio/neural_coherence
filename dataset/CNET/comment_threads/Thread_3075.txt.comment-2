Thos bigger ones(1mb or better) I've come across haven't failed yet, but most are relativity new, so I can't yes/no on any certain brand.
Lower capacity ones have done quite well and when they do fail, they just do, more than likely because of &quot;static/ESD&quot; damage.
I do find the Kingston brand more to my liking as I've had a 32mb for years and still works, all others have failed, like Memorex and Secure jumpdrives.
Some other &quot;give-aways&quot; when they were 128mb or less didn't make it and died too, but they certainly lasted at least 1-2 yrs.
before biting the dust.
Earlier Cruzer drives had some glitch and I stayed away from them, but it seems they've corrected that(not recongized) or resolved it.
As for any flash drives, I like those that have an easily &quot;recappable&quot; cover for the business end.
