Am I the only one to notice a jump in the Pixel count of digital cameras?
It was not long ago that I bought my first camera with 2mp count.
This was just an entry level device but still considered reasonable.
Upgrading to a 4mp camera was quite expensive but I did eventually do it.
But now when I see cameras advertised the cheapest are 5 to 6mp.
I am sure technology has not accelerated that much in such a short time (measured in months rather than years).Are they using a different measurement for the pixel count now?
Interpolation comes to mind.
