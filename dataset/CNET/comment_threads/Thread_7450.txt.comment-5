Here in the US I paid 60 bucks for a refurb 750GB SATA hard disk.
Surely you can find an 80 for not much more at newegg.com or geeks.com As to paying for transfer of the data, why would I do that when I have a cable like http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2020&cat=HDD and free cloning software like G4U?
Sorry but this is an area I feel you DIY or pay up.
