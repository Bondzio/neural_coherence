<s> I'm on the IT staff at a large school district. </s>
<s> We have a huge number of iBooks that need to have their batteries recalled. </s>
<s> However, one of the instructions is to discharge all of the batteries. </s>
<s> With hundreds of these batteries to send back, it isn't practical to discharge them one by one. </s>
<s> Does anybody know of any battery discharging towers, or other methods to discharge large numbers of Li-Ion batteries? </s>
<s> No one I know bothered with that step. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>

<s> Leaving batteries overnight in a plastic bucket or other non-conductive container filled with salt water will discharge batteries. </s>
<s> You may want to rinse off the batteries before shipping and check them with a voltmeter to be sure that they are fully discharged. </s>
<s> A very simple yet effective method. </s>
<s> A Google search on &quot;Lithium and Water&quot; will yield tidbits like: &quot;Effects of exposure to Lithium: Fire: Flammable. </s>
<s> Many reactions may cause fire or explosion. </s>
<s> Gives off irritating or toxic fumes (or gases) in a fire. </s>
<s> Explosion: Risk of fire and explosion on contact with combustible substances and water.&quot; Recommendations I've received include: Tape off the contacts to prevent inadvertent shorting; the batteries can then be shipped by SURFACE movement...not air shipment. </s>
