I had my mobo replaced just incase and I've put everything back together and its still doing what it was...i switched out the PSU with an older one again and it did the same thing with the new PSU everything on the comp runs EVERYTHING and it shuts off right at the bios page what more can I do my PC is on for 2-5 sec so how can it be a cpu heat problem...
