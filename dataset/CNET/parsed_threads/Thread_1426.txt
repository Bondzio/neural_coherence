<s> what would a small company need to implement a remote working system for its sales staff? </s>
<s> staff would need to check the database for available prices and availability, make travel bookings and complete the sales orders online, working from home. </s>
<s> Wouldn't we put that up on some web server today? </s>
<s> And NEVER EVER build a server in house? </s>

<s> The usual is your biz apps on some server like Godaddy (there are dozens of these out there) and then nothing more than what you want to support is required from the client. </s>
<s> If your developer is good they will be able to access this from most smart phones, pads and the usual laptop or desktop with the web browser. </s>

<s> thanks... i am not an it person and just wanted to check they won't take me for a ride and make me buy lots of extra stuff... so if i provide the sales reps with laptops, smartphones, printers and some voip telephony (something somebody told me but which i am not too sure about) and have a server and a router at the main office i should be fine right?... </s>
<s> thanks so much for making it clearer..cheers </s>
<s> You are about to repeat the same system that requires an in-house IT staffer to care and feed that server. </s>
<s> Well, that's your choice. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
