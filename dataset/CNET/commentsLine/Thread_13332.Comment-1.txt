my laptop says its getting signal from the router, but when i look at the connection status, it shows that its sending but not recieving &quot;packets.&quot; my other laptop's wireless connection works fine.
i think i may have activated the &quot;share internet connection&quot; function by accident, which the help menu says is a no-no.
can someone help me out?
