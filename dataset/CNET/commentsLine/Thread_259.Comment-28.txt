your machine's issue however is one that is common and been solved many times in these forums.
it's sad to see a member struggle over this one and maybe ignore the common fix due to what may be hurt feelings.
i've spent many posts with you trying to ask in a number of ways to describe the issue.
since that seems to be over i'm now going to remove the gloves and be blunt and not sugar coat any further reply.
this is to strike to the heart of the matter and hopefully save you many many hours.
but that's your choice.
i think i've noted one and only one try this!!!
post and now the work is up to you to do the work.
if not, please write back so i know that you are unwilling to try this common fix so i can leave you in the capable (but costly) hands of dell and the geeksquad.
