not quite sure why you are &quot;tinkering&quot; and swapping drives but if that is your style of operation, i have the following suggestions/options: 1. the enclosure is designed to route air from the fans to the various heat generators (cpu, drives etc).
if you keep the enclosure off, you are destroying the designed air flow patterns.
suggest putting the enclosure back in its original configuration even if you use something like ducktape to hold it in place: for quick access.
2. if #1 is not to your liking, then you need an external fan that is blowing toward the open area of your enclosure.
3. you might want to consider using an external drive(s) that is/are either permanently in place or connected as you need the capability.
this would allow you to close the computer, as intended by the design, and give you various disk options.
note: heat is the #1 destroyer of electronics.
you are seeing it relative to the drives but it is very possible that there are other hot spots in the electronics area that are being stressed.
