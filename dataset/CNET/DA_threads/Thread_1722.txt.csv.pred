1.1.1	i recently got a Philips SPD3600CC 20x external usb dvd burner.	St
1.1.2	I enabled nero to show the ACTUAL burn speed instead of the selected burn speed.	St
1.1.3	the burner will get to 9.5x then it will start slowing down and stay at 7.9x.	St
1.1.4	I am using tdk 16x dvd-r media.	St
1.1.5	It takes about 7 minutes for the dvd to burn.	St
1.1.6	Is it just me or is this product defective?	St
1.1.7	Any input appreciated.	St
1.2.1	While the 20X advertising sounds good, all things need to be just right to get it.	St
1.2.2	You need to have NO other activity going on while you burn for one thing.	St
1.2.3	No web surfing or any game playing.	St
1.2.4	Some will say that anti-virus or other memory resident programs can interfere with the burn process also.	St
1.2.5	If you are real concerned with the burn speed, the only way to see if that is the case is to shut down other programs that may want any resouces.	St
1.2.6	Then try again.	Sug
1.3.1	If you were doing a video, how was it being done?	St
1.3.2	Were the files already on the harddrive and the write program just putting it on the DVD?	St
1.3.3	If it was data, then did the writing program have to do anything to the data before it could be written?	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	You took 7 minutes to burn.	St
1.5.2	So my calculation is... 120 / 7 = 17.14 times.	St
1.5.3	Seems like you actually hit the numbers.	St
1.5.4	Bob PS.	St
1.5.5	Try to curb your posts to 1 or 2 forums and wait a day.	St
1.5.6	If no answer then try another.	St
1.5.7	Spamming the forums may be noticed.	St
1.6.1	This is when I am burning a data DVD from my hard drive to the burner.	St
1.6.2	no transcoding is being done before burn or anything, just straight to the disc	St
1.7.1	so, do you think this product is defective?	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	so is this just a case of nero reporting the wrong speed?	St
1.9.2	if i get you right you are saying a 1x burn = 120minutes, correct	St
1.10.1	I defer to content you find out there.	St
1.10.2	I offered one explanation and hope you can do a little more reseach.	St
1.10.3	Try the wikipedia or google and share your findings.	St
1.10.4	Bob	St
1.11.1	so basically, you don't know	St
1.12.1	Moderators are unpaid and each has their own style.	St
1.12.2	One of my quirks is to help you learn to help yourself.	St
1.12.3	That is &quot;fishing lessons&quot; instead of fish.	St
1.12.4	If you feel I don't know, then we'll call it a day.	St
1.12.5	Bob	St
1.13.1	just to let you know, forums are my last resort when looking for information as it is for a lot of people.	St
1.13.2	i am aware of google and wikipedia so quit insulting my intelligence.	St
1.13.3	perhaps people shouldn't answer questions if they dont know the answer, this could lead people in the wrong direction	Sug
1.14.1	Best of luck, hope my simple answer helped you understand it.	St
1.14.2	Bob	St
1.15.1	Ok....I finally found a post on the SPD3600 and I expected the same complaint that I have...but 17x???	St
1.15.2	That's awesome compared to the 0.70x that I am currently getting from this dvd burner.	St
1.15.3	DMA is on, I have 2gig of ram and a Pentium M with 160ghz.	St
1.15.4	Nothing points to an obvious problem (it IS plugged into a USB 2.0 and has the latest firmware).	St
1.15.5	I've used CloneDVD, Nero, Alcohol, ShrinkDVD....you name it I've tried it.	St
1.15.6	Slowness comes on a direct backup of a dvd, burning from the hd, data backup, software backup, EVERYTHING!	St
1.15.7	It's pretty frustrating not even being able to burn at real time!!	St
1.15.8	1x would be good for now!	St
1.15.9	Anyone have any advice?	St
1.15.10	Am I missing something obvious?	St
1.15.11	Anything would be great!	St
1.15.12	Thanks in advance.	St
1.15.13	Cheers!	St
1.16.1	But I'd start a new post since yours is going on page 2 and won't be seen on the first page here.	St
1.16.2	Makes for too much scrolling.	St
1.16.3	As to full details you have some of them but not all.	St
1.16.4	Bob	St
