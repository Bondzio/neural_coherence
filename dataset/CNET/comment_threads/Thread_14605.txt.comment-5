Robert, Thanks, I will try the Creative website for any new drivers they may have for the audio card and then try to make sure my IDE is set to the DMA mode.
That may be the problem.
About flashing the bios...I have heard all kinds of horror stories about doing that.
I can get the exact mother board information with the Fresh Diagnose or Sandra 2004 programs and later find the manufacturer that will give me the bios update...do you think that will provide me a &quot;jump in the juice&quot; and make this old AMD K6 450 &quot;fly right&quot; ??
Thanks
