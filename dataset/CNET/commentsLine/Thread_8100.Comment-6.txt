don't count on the ext.
hd for storage over extended periods of time.
if you review the horror stories on ext.
hds, they do fail and/or become troublesome.
i suggest you consider seriously any true important data get saved/backup/copied/stored on media such as dvd or cd as 1 copy or more.
this needn't be everything but what you consider super critical at least.
further, don't treat your ext.
hd lightly, it can easily become a victim of mishandling or s/w corruption and this is normal mode.
while, i paint a dire picture here, its better to play safe than sorry.
take due care... tada -----willy
