<s> Hi, I need to ask this question because my back-up needs seem to different to the typical long-term archive scenario. </s>
<s> As a translator, I work on documents everyday over a number of days and I also update admin documents to track my work and budget. </s>
<s> Keeping these files safe is crucial but the fact that they change every day, in fact every hour, means that solutions like DVD burning are too final and cumbersome. </s>
<s> I would be grateful for any suggestions on how to keep files safe that are in constant use. </s>
<s> Even once or twice a day back-up would be acceptable. </s>
<s> I currently keep all my non-program files on an external hard-drive, which safeguards against a breakdown of the computer itself. </s>
<s> But that doesn't help if the external HDD dies one day. </s>
<s> I have considered the MyBook Mirror but it seems very expensive and I'm not certain how recovery would work in the case of failure. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> Look at http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=SimpleBackup.jpg where I'm doing a daily or more backup of a project directory using what Windows gives me. </s>
<s> It's just a right click and to a zip file which I can elect to copy off to USB memory stick, other hard disks or other places. </s>
<s> I don't bother trying to backup just this or that. </s>
<s> I get the whole set and am NEVER held hostage by a proprietary backup program. </s>
<s> Try simple. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> That sounds like it works well enough, although the folders that need to be kept backed-up come to about 500 MB, so some kind of synchronisation software would be needed just to 'update' the back-up rather than re-copy all the files everyday. </s>
<s> I looked and the directory I am backing up is 61MB and the zip file is 21MB. </s>
<s> So 500MB at the same may be 170MB? </s>
<s> A 2GB memory stick is under 10 bucks here so that's two weeks of daily backups. </s>
<s> And no proprietary software used, no files ever held hostage. </s>
