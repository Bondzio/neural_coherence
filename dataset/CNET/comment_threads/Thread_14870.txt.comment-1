Howdy, My computer has begun to run very slowly and I just recieved a warning that the vitrual memory is low.
I am trying to figure out how to remedy this.
First let me tell you what I have done to the computer.
I added a plug and play cd rom and storage device.I also have a slave drive running the computer.
I use the plugin device for downloading, but run the programs from the c drive.
Besides that I have basic windows and microsoft word stuff and two video games.
Any good place to start?
What are my virus or otherwise potential?
oh,I have a gateway that is about two years old and run windows xp thank you much steve
