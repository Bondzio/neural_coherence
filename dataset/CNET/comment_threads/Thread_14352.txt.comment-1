I have an ASUS motherboard, M2N-VM DVI.
The processor went bad, an Athlon 64 X2 4600+.
I also have an ASUS M4A785-M, and a MSI 785GTM-E45.
My point and question is this.....what is the difference between an AM3 socket MB and an AM2/AM2+ MB and a MB that will use all 3?
Because I need to replace the processor on my ASUS M2N-VM DVI which is a socket AM2/AM2+.My other 2 motherboards will use all 3 socket type processors.
I just want to get the best processor the board will use.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
