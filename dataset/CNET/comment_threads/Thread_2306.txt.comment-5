but found this driver http://www.vista-driver.org/query/1070/marvell_yukon_88e8056_pci-e_gigabit_ethernet_controller I can't tell if it's in the mentioned family.
Only Yukon can do that.
I have to wonder if you don't have an older pre-Vista system and have run into hardware compatibility issues.
Is that possible?
