<s> I need a new desktop for home use. </s>
<s> I am thinking I want XP media center. </s>

<s> I am close to many electronics stores. </s>

<s> eMachines t6522 if it exists. </s>
<s> If not, get the HP 7150e, with the amd athlon x2 4400+ Roger </s>
<s> Having Media Center usually jacks up the price too much. </s>
<s> Try this: http://www.emachines.com/products/products.html?prod=eMachines_T6520 The X200 graphics is more than enough for light gaming. </s>
<s> However, the sound is weak and you need a TV tuner. </s>
<s> For sound: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16829102162 For the TV: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16815100136 For the monitor: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824116355 Price before rebates:$1217 I admit, the monitor is a little pricy. </s>
<s> If you want to shave off $100 or so, do that with the monitor, as it is $420. </s>
<s> In todays weekly flyer, in not in your newspaper, then get inside of Best Buy, a Gateway (model 840GM) with the new Dual-Core processor, Intel Pent D Processor 830 (3.0GHz), with a 17&quot; LCD Flat-Panel Monitor and color printer. </s>

<s> All for $1229.97 without mail-in rebates. </s>
<s> It has the new Integrated (on board)Intel Graphics Media Accelerator GMA 950, but has a PCI-E x16 slot, so just buy a Geforce 6600GT (around $160)or 6800 for less than $200, and have a excellent high end gaming machine. </s>
<s> it is in the same case as my slightly outdated gateway 820gm. </s>
<s> i mean if mine flys, yours will with dual core! </s>
<s> only dif is the cpu, the ram and hdd is the same. </s>

<s> got a bfg 6600gt from bestbuy today(on sale in ad in newspaper ) and now i get 60fps on all medium settings, it is simply amazing! </s>
<s> it shows you how you can turn a regular oem pc into a top notch gaming pc. </s>

<s> i love it. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> Thanks to all for the replies. </s>
<s> The Gateway looks like a great deal. </s>
<s> The only thing I see missing is the light scribe technology. </s>
<s> I am not very familiar with that. </s>
<s> Is that something I should get? </s>
<s> I do burn a lot of CDs. </s>
<s> Also, the GeForce 6600GT is listed at $250 at best buy. </s>
<s> Where can I find it for $160? </s>
<s> I also saw the SonyRB42G at best buy for $1279 after rebates, $1429 after adding the DVD-ROM, 640 processor and graphics card. </s>
<s> This seems like a good deal also, even though the Gateway has the Pentium D. What are your thoughts on this compared to the Gateway. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Newegg sells for that price. </s>
<s> Lightscibe-marketing bs. </s>
<s> Sony=Overpriced piece of junk </s>
<s> is HP technology and as such may not be available elsewhere yet. </s>
<s> It came on my new HP and it is kind of neat because you can burn labels on CDs and DVDs without the messy labels. </s>
<s> Media runs around $8 for 5 either CD or DVD, but should drop in price eventually. </s>
<s> http://www.lightscribe.com/index.aspx </s>
<s> you can chat online with gateway for free anytime except on weekend, i never liked sony's support. </s>
<s> i have 2 sonys currently and they are good machines. </s>
<s> lightscribe is only if you want to put your own custom graphics/words/titles on to your cd. </s>
<s> most people including me just use sharpies the graphics card was on sale for $180 after rebates. </s>
<s> i would hurry to your store, or check the ad, and buy one because that was one good offer that did NOT disapoint me. </s>
<s> of course there is always newegg i would for sure go for gateway because it has dual core which is the future and it has a great case. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Just now reading your post after waking up from a nap. </s>
<s> I'm not familiar with Light Scribe and it is not on these Sony or Gateway computers. </s>
<s> The ATI Radeon X300 PCI-Express cards are the lowest performer in the PCI-express line up as rated by Tom's Hardware and can be had for $65-$66 at Newegg. </s>
<s> They would however be an improvement over the standard integrated GMA 900 graphics that would come with the Sony's without a video card. </s>
<s> Note, the standard integrated on the Dual-Core Gateway is the newer GMA 950 graphics. </s>
<s> The BFG GeForce 6600GT PCIe graphics card that is on sale at Best Buy this week for $179.99+tax+ after mail-in rebates, is a overclocked version that normally sells for $212+$4.50 shipping at Newegg. </s>
<s> The standard Geforce 6600GT PCIe like the Gigabyte sells for $162 + $3.50 shipping at Newegg. </s>
<s> You should not have any worries with Newegg, get deliverery in about 3 working days, can order over the net indicating to pay by check or Money Order, then immediately call on the phone and give your credit card number (I don't key my CC# on the PC). </s>
<s> http://tinyurl.com/8vnkz The Gateway already has a DVD-ROM. </s>
<s> The Pentium 4, 6xx processor series that Sony is using just came out this past January by Intel, and is an upgrade of the 5xx series by having the 64-bit support (EM64T). </s>
<s> A few months later Intel came out with the Pentium D, 8xx series Dual-Core processor that also has the Extended Memory 64 Technology (EM64T). </s>
<s> If you are unfamiliar with the new Dual-Core technology, you should read up on it. </s>
<s> If going with Intel Pentium computers and comparing these two particular Gateway and Sony computers, there is no doubt in my mind that I would definately choose the Gateway, mainly for the price comparison/dual core tech. </s>
