Desktop connects to router by cable via NIC. Two other laptops connects wirelessly. The Desktop runs Windows XP Pro SP2; laptops runs XP Home SP2...No problems with Internet connection, but have not tried to share files... My question: When one of the computers is playing a video or audio file, can the others share ? If so, how ? Thanks. christy.

If you change all your computer's workgroup name (Besides MSHome) then when you got to My Network Places and into workgroup then you will see their shared folders.
