1.1.1	I want to upgrade my computers RAM from 1 Gig to 3 gigs and I wanted to know whether the new RAM I get should be EXACTLY the same as the factory-installed RAM( as in the Mhz rating, PCxxxx type , and manufacturer) On that note I want to use two video cards and I am want know if you can use 2 different cards( the one in my computer is the ATI X700 and the one I want to use with it is the nVidia 6800 Ultra)	St
1.2.1	why do you need 3 gigs of ram?	Sug
1.2.2	seems like overkill for pretty much every application out there.	St
1.2.3	but to answer your question as i understand things as long as it'll fit into the slot the system will automaticaly configure the memory to operate at the slowest speed... meaning if you have say a stick of ddr 333 and 2 of ddr 400 the ddr 400 will be &quot;underclocked&quot; to operate at the same speed as the 333. and no you cant use 2 different cards.	St
1.2.4	they have to be the same model.	St
1.2.5	ATI and Nvidia use different setups to utilize SLI type technology and boards so no you cant wire them together in a sort of hybred SLI setup.	St
1.2.6	if you're going to go for a dual card setup go with a pair of 6800s; or even better 7800s.	St
1.3.1	simultaneously.	St
1.3.2	Even with 2 pci-express slots.	St
1.3.3	Why need 2?	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	Still 3gb is overkill.	St
1.5.2	Those games are new, but 2gb is good, unless of course you are running a 64+ player server on BF2??	St
1.5.3	And, the Ultra will play each very well.	St
1.6.1	replace the factory installed card with a nVidia model(6800 Ultra is what Im going for)	St
1.7.1	2 GB's of memory is quite enough.	St
1.7.2	If you check benchmarks posted on most games, the system memory is not as much of an issue as the video card.	St
1.7.3	You probably wouldn't even get a 5 FPS boost using 3 GB instead of 2 GB.	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
