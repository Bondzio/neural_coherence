1.1.1	i have a DVD drive that is now only recognised as a CD-ROM when i select & quot ; My Computer & quot ; in Windows XP.It is recognised by Neros disc info tool as a DVD - it says it can play DVD- etc and if i uninstall then reinstall i get a message saying DVD-ROM found.So why isnt it recognised as a DVD , it will play CDs no problem.I have reset the CMOS , uninstalled then reinstalled the secondary IDE in Device Manager but to no avail , any advice how i can get this drive to play DVDs again ?

1.3.1	OK , the motherboard is a pcchips m830lr.I have been to the website for drivers but could only see audio , LAN and AGP drivers .	St
1.4.1	In short , without that chipset driver package its likely you will get reduced functionality .	St
1.4.2	Your board supplier should have given you the CD with the SIS 735 drivers .	St
1.4.3	If not , fish at http : //www.sis.com/products/chipsets/oa/socketa/735.htm Bob	St
1.5.1	This is getting very strange ... .. the DVD drive will now play DVD movies , but will not read DVD-R discs that have been burned on a friends machine ( these DVD-R discs do play on other PCs ok though ) , Nero info tool says it should play them.Now when the DVD and my Samsung SW-252 CD-RW are both connected the Samsung will not work - there is an exclamation mark in Device Manager and it does not show in & quot ; My Computer & quot ; .When it is connected on its own it is fine , but when both are connected the CD wont work.Why wont both work when both connected ?

1.6.1	One must follow the IDE & quot ; rules & quot ; .	St
1.6.2	If not , IDE devices do not work together .	St
1.6.3	As to the DVD-R , not all drives read/play recorded media .	St
1.6.4	Reasons abound , but the most usual is ... the drive is getting old or had dust on the laser lens .	St

1.7.1	The DVD is set to master and the CD is slave ( i have also tried the other way round ) , the IDE cable came with the DVD and was fine before.Oddly when the CD was master and the DVD was slave the CD showed as a & quot ; Local Disc & quot ; in & quot ; My Computer & quot ; and with a big red question mark on it	St
1.8.1	I found that when such do n't play together , one of the drives has failed or just is incompatible with the other drive .	St
1.8.2	But a magic procedure I use is : 1 .	St
1.8.3	Set drives to Cable Select .	St
1.8.4	2 .	St
1.8.5	Use a shiny new 80 conductor cable .	St
1.8.6	3 .	St
1.8.7	Update each CDRW and DVD drive FIRMWARE per the maker 's instructions .	St
1.8.8	For me , this works well .	St
