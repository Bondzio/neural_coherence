1.1.1	One week ago I set up the BELKIN 54Mbps Wireless ROuter as per the instuctions to my home office LAN.	St
1.1.2	It worked perfectly for 3 days, routing both the wired LAN and wirless access to my two laptops - IBM T42 and SONY VIAO 505.	St
1.1.3	Then after 3 days both laptops ceased to be able to access wirelessly [while the wired network continues to work fine].	St
1.1.4	Both laptops recognize the wireless network - they just can't connect to it.	St
1.1.5	The IBM says the signal is too weak - even when I put it right next to the router.	St
1.1.6	The Sony does not give a reason.	St
1.1.7	I have: 1.	St
1.1.8	Replaced the router with a new one from the store and reinstalled it - no help.	St
1.1.9	2.	St
1.1.10	Turned off the IBM automatic access software - no help.	St
1.1.11	3.	St
1.1.12	Tried to reconnect everyway I can think of.	St
1.1.13	I am completely stimied.	St
1.1.14	THanks for reading this.	St
1.1.15	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	firmware on the makers site.	St
1.3.1	In combination with a call to the makers helpline I was able to access the firmware directly on the router and reset the channel.	St
1.3.2	I never had a clue that there were different broadcast channels [like a phone] and of course this makes sense.	St
1.3.3	It fixed the problem so I can connect from my IBM laptop, but my Sony still does not work - It shows the network and connects automatically then disconnects about 2 seconds later.	St
1.3.4	It flips back anf forth, connected -- diconnected every couple of seconds.	St
1.3.5	Any ideas?	St
1.4.1	1.)	St
1.4.2	Upgrade 'firmware' in router if you haven't already and if Sony notebook has 'card' or internal wireless upgrade it's 'firmware' also!	St
1.4.3	2.)	St
1.4.4	Is the Sony located in the vicinity of a telephone that uses 2.4Ghz carrier?	St
1.4.5	I experienced a similar intermittent operation and it was fixed by removing the phone completely.	St
1.4.6	3.)	St
1.4.7	In 'Network Connections', 'Wireless network Connections Properties'(Get to via right click), 'Wireless Networks' be sure &quot;Use Windows to configure my wireless netowrk settings&quot; is checked!!	St
1.4.8	!GB	St
