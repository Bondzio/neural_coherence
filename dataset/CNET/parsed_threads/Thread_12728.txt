<s> I will primarily use it in a home office. </s>
<s> No gaming at all or little use for movies, etc. </s>
<s> Mostly internet with office functionality (quicken, other finacial programs, etc) Maybe some media use. </s>
<s> Looking at the Dell XPS 400 and their 24&quot; widescreen monitor 2405FPW. </s>
<s> I definitely want the monitor so that leaves a max of roughly $1000 for the desktop. </s>
<s> I am very leery of buying refurbished with little warranty. </s>
<s> Dell seems pretty solid. </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> You can get much better components for the same price. </s>
<s> If you are asking if I am willing to physically build one myself, then no. </s>
<s> I have never done that so it would not be prudent to try. </s>
<s> I spend alot of time on the internet (4-6) hours sometimes a day and need reliability.If you are talking about having someone build it for me I am not sure...saving $100 bucks to have someone I don't know from Adam does not seem wise. </s>
<s> In my humble opinion, computers are machines and it is not IF they will break, but when. </s>
<s> What happens at that point is something I have to consider. </s>
<s> That is primarily why I do not want to buy a refurbished that normally comes with a 90 day warranty. </s>
<s> Buying an extended warranty with a company I know nothing about seems like a crazy idea. </s>
<s> I know that Dell is very reputable and that is why they are likely more expensive. </s>
<s> What did you have in mind? </s>
<s> If you decide to build, buy the parts from newegg.com, which is the best place to buy computer parts. </s>
<s> They have low prices and good customer service. </s>
<s> You can even get an extended warranty from newegg when you purchase the item. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you get warranties from the makers of the parts. </s>
<s> I agree with not buying refurb; I've had a bad experience. </s>
<s> Here's an E510 that should meet your needs. </s>
<s> Since the 24&quot; LCD isn't an option in the E510's customization choices, you should give Dell a call to get a final price for the PC and the monitor. </s>
<s> Dell Dimension E510 Series: </s>
<s> i might buy a E510 with all those specs 19inch ultrasharp 2gig ram for 900 </s>
<s> Then you need to go to techbargains.com and search the Dell section for their online coupon codes. </s>
<s> I'm not wild about Dell's customer service (long wait times, mostly under educated), but their systems are not the worst you will find (their customization options are quite extensive). </s>
<s> If you are at all space conscious you could also get a notebook with an external monitor connector; for $1000 dollars you get a lot of notebook these days. </s>
