Okay...I use youtube...I make videos and put them on youtube.
And I need a good converter that can convert flv videos to avi.
It must be free.
Completely free.
I've tried alot of 'em.
It also must have something like &quot;Codec&quot; (It says the video must have a codec for me to import it to Windows Movie Maker) Any Ideas?
