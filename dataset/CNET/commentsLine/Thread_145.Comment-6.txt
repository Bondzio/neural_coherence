managed to find out more info on the gfx card, the modle is gf4mx440se-v64(a8) and can be found at this page:  under apg it says: &quot;agp bus rate : 1x, 2x, 4x&quot; this doesnt tell me that its 1.5v.
so can it be said that its compatable, the keying on the card is done by two slots, in the old motherboard, none?
