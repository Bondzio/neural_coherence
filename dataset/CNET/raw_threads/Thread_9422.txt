There's no simple &quot;on&quot; setting. I don't even know where to begin. Anyone want to help walk me through?
2708	1	513564	5063339	5063332	Coryphaeus	1/12/11 7:15 PM	1.2948597E12	First question . . .	Since I don't research devices, the question would be, does the modem incorporate a router? And does this router contain a wireless radio? If the answer is no to the router, you need to purchase a wireless router to attach to the modem. Connect thus: Modem -&gt; router -&gt; PC. Please answer the first two questions.

But like I mentioned above, there's no &quot;on&quot; setting, there's a whole lot of settings that weren't in any of my previous modems.

In general you access the router (wired), you'll need to find the documentation for the specific IP address used. Generally it will be 192.168.x.x. After you enter the router setup you navigate to the wireless settings. Wireless on should be the default setting. Does your PC have wireless capability? If so have you searched for wireless networks? I'm really not prepared to give the full tutoral for your specific modem/router. It should come with the setup instructions. Not that I don't want to help, but I decline to duplicate any existing documentation.

It is an amazing 41 pages long and, I think, personally written by the techs at 3BTECH. I followed all the instructions. (((Yes my laptop has built in WiFi and a switch on the front to Enable/Disable. The switch is Enabled and I can usually see 2-4 other networks.))) My laptop is a Toshiba Satallite A215, AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core TK-57 1.9 Ghz, 2 GB Ram, Vista Home SP2. And before I go further, I will say that I am a computer expert with very little knowledge of networking but a tad bit of experience with it...trial and error type stuff mostly. When I go to &quot;192.168.1.1&quot; I am redirected to &quot; http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/webcm&quot; and there I log into my modem. I find myself at the HOME page. Across the top are tabs labeled Home, Wizard, Setup, Advanced, Wireless, Tools, Status, and Help. I have played around with some settings under most of these to try and &quot;turn on&quot; the wireless and haven't gotten anywhere. The HOME tab displays basic status information. For this post I will qoute what I currently see. System uptime: 09 hours 58 minutes DSL Status: Connected DSL Speed: 512/3008kbps Wireless RF: Disabled Ethernet: Connected Software Version: 3.6.0C_2N00 SSID: ASUSMATT At the bottom there is two buttons &quot;log out&quot; and &quot;Refresh&quot; Per the instructions in the included manual and of my ISP's (AT&T) particular settings, I went to WIZARD. At the top, under the TABS is the heading: PPoE Connection Setup Protocal: PPPoE VPI: 0 VCI: 35 Username: ***** Password: ***** On Demand: (Not Selected) Idle Timeout: (Greyed out and not an option) Under this is another section/heading labeled Wireless Setup SSID: ASUSMATT Channel B/G: 7 At the bottom are the options to &quot;log out&quot; or &quot;next&quot; When I click &quot;next&quot; the new screen is the warning that I am about to make permanent changes to the system and that if I continue it will be restarted. Obviously, I saved and restarted and was online in seconds through Ethernet. The next TAB is SETUP where I have: (HEADING) LAN Setup LAN Configuration Ethernet Switch (HEADING) WAN Setup New Connection Modem (followed by a green light) Wizard Gamer Log Out The First thing I did was go to New Connection because there wasn't clear instructions concerning the wireless feature in the manual. ...I will continue in a minute...

2708	7	513564	5063913	5063884	Coryphaeus	1/13/11 5:25 PM	1.2949395E12	Also . . .	If this modem/router is supplied by your ISP they can walk you through the setup.
2708	8	513564	5063924	5063903	supermaltese	1/13/11 5:43 PM	1.29494058E12	Wireless RF: Disabled?	Does Wireless RF: Disabled at the Home page mean that my wireless is turned off and not transmitting?
2708	9	513564	5063930	5063924	Coryphaeus	1/13/11 5:54 PM	1.29494124E12	Correct . . .	Go to the Wireless option at the top of the page.
2708	10	513564	5063931	5063913	supermaltese	1/13/11 5:57 PM	1.29494142E12	ISP Provider...	Nope, The modem is a 3rd party buy. I got it for like $20 instead of AT&T's $70 option. In hindsight, maybe next time I'll use there's. If it's the 2wire like I had a couple of years ago, it's so easy to use it's pathetic. lol.
2708	11	513564	5063932	5063912	supermaltese	1/13/11 6:01 PM	1.29494166E12	Wireless RF	Yeah. I wondered about that. I can't figure out how it's disabled or how to turn it on. There's no simple &quot;on&quot; button. http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25323023-Help-setting-up-ASUS-AAM-6020VI-for-WiFi That link is to my zipped Microsoft Word Document containing all the screen shots from every tab and option.
