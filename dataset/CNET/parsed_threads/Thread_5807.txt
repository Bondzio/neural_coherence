<s> I just purchased VoIP service and added their phone port router to my existing network. </s>
<s> Original router is wireless D-Link DI 624 802.11G router. </s>
<s> The VoIP phone router (Linksys RT41P2-AT) is hooked to the cable modem, then to the the wireless router. </s>
<s> The wireless D-Link router broadcasts wireless signal fine, but with it's own static IP range, which is different than the Linksys phone router. </s>
<s> The wired/wireless pc's can't talk to each other. </s>
<s> Also, the hardwire ports on the wireless won't work (just broadcasts) and I have tried an 8 port 3com hub from the phone router and that won't work either! </s>
<s> I was so glad to save money with the VoIP but this has mucked up my network. </s>
<s> I can't pass data between the wireless nodes and the wired. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> I can ping host pc from wireless and connect with Terminal Services but this does not help me with data transfers. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> Thanks, Linksys Phone router: 192.168.15.1 - All IP's are 15.xxx D-Link 802.11G Wireless: 192.168.0.1 - All IP's are 0.xxx </s>
<s> I'm not sure about the VoIP equipment, but I think I would put the VoIp at the end of the line (cable modem, then Wireless router, then VoIP router). </s>
<s> Secondly, you need to match the subnet ID's on both routers, all 192.168.15.xxx OR 192.168.0.xxx. </s>
<s> If you have both 15's and 0's, there isn' any way PC's on separate routers to have two way sharing with you setup. </s>
<s> Example: the VoIP may 'see' the wirelss PC's, but not the other way. </s>
<s> Check out my answer for a similar problem at http://home.comcast.net/~larbel1/ . </s>
<s> You may be able to come up with the solution for your problem. </s>
<s> The CNET forms wouldn't format my simple text drawing correctly, so I did it on my web page. </s>
<s> It will be up for some time. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
