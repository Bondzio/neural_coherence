<s> I have an older computer, running XP, that won't recoginize the mouse or keyboard. </s>
<s> I don't need the computer any more, so I want to take the hard drive out and put it in the new one for more storage. </s>
<s> What is the best way to do the transplant since I can't get into windows or BIOS to try and erase everything on the hard drive??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> You mount the drive in the new machine, connect the Slave connector to the drive and boot up. </s>
<s> This just works if the Cable Select jumpers are set. </s>
<s> Then you wipe/clean as you see fit. </s>
