i assume you run everything through a router (or switch and server (acting as the router)) now the question, are the users local adminstrators, as well as adminstrators of the domain?
sometimes this can be overlooked and is worth asking.
if they are, in fact, local admins, then possibly checking the adapters on the affected computers for the status of ipx/spx protocol and toggling the status would help.
make sure that ipx/spx is either completely enabled on every computer or completely disabled and see if that changes anything.
the way a shared printer should work is when you find it in your network places, double-clicking it should create a connection that is relatively permanent without asking for a username or password.
make sure in the sharing and security settings that the group everyone has full access to the printer.
hope that helps a little.
