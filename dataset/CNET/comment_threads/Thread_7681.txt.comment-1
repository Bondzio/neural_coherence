Hi, I have to reinstall my Windows XP, before y download all to a external drive (from a friend).
But by mistake I reloaded with now mostly useless files my hard drive.
Is there a way to recognize which files are been used and which to get rid?
if possible, if there is a way to delete them not one by one will be grate.
thank for your attention to my question and your knowledge and suggestions.
