<s> Hi, Thanks for any advice about buying a new computer (just the CPU) under $1,000 that is, first and foremost --- QUIET. </s>
<s> Things I want: - Good DVD viewing - Good You Tube viewing - Internet browsing - Word Processing - Possibly TV tuner Things I dont need: - Gaming - High-end audio-visuals </s>
<s> I noticed you said you are only looking for a CPU? </s>
<s> I'm not sure if you actually mean what CPU is an abbreviation for, which would be Central Processing Unit. </s>
<s> In case you did, then a great CPU out right now would be the Intel E5200 Dual-Core Processor. </s>
<s> You can get it for about $75.00. </s>
<s> It clocks in at 2.5Ghz. </s>
<s> As far as noise goes, it's virtually silent. </s>
<s> Hi, thanks for making the distinction about the CPU. </s>
<s> I should have used the term &quot;console&quot; or &quot;just the computer without peripherals.&quot; I know about some quiet computers, e.g., Dell &quot;Hybrid.&quot; And &quot;endpcnoise&quot; makes quiet computers. </s>
<s> And thanks for the info about the quiet CPU (Dual-Core). </s>
<s> I'll add that to my list of specs. </s>
<s> Given the price you certainly can beat the price with almost any of the 599 buck or less machines being able to do what you listed. </s>
<s> However if it was my money I'd skip Vista and wait for Windows 7. </s>

<s> You can do all that for a price of around $500 *CPU: Athlon X2 BE-2350, OEM since we'll use a quieter HSF cheap, cool and can handle all the stuff you listed *HSF: Thermaltake A4017-01 quiet, never used it myself, but I have seen good reviews *Mobo: Anything with 780G northbridge this is why I chose AMD, the 780g has a Radeon HD 3200 which is one of the best IGP's out there *RAM: 2gigs of DDR2 (any speed, recommend keeping it under 5-5-5-15 latency) *Case: Antec Sonata III Case w/500 watt PSU quiet case, used before and it is really good *PSU: the one that came with the case Hard drives, DVD drives...: choose quiet ones, can't really recommend one, there are so many </s>
<s> Hi Bob, just briefly: i don't like laptops, and do like PCs with the separate keyboard, big screen, mouse, etc. </s>
<s> Tell me more about Win 7. </s>
<s> In a brief search for reviews, there are a few beta reviews, but nothing really too substantial yet. </s>
<s> Do you think it will be (a) as good as, or better than, XP; and/or (b) fix all the bugs / better than Vista? </s>
<s> Thanks for any info. </s>
<s> Thanks for the great list of specs! </s>
<s> Good idea to build it myself, but I don't feel i am up to speed on building a computer, but may take your specs to a shop in the neighborhood to see if they will do it. </s>
<s> One of my main concerns is having good tech support, and someone close-by could be good. </s>

<s> Sorry, never going to happen. </s>
<s> The market dictates you take a product to market when the bugs are below a certain threshold. </s>
<s> You won't found bug free Windows any time soon. </s>
<s> But Vista feels like Microsoft's Windows ME disaster. </s>
<s> And I did the Windows 7 beta and it's impressive. </s>
<s> Even in beta form it seems to beat Vista on key talking points. </s>
<s> I'd wait it out and skip Vista if you can. </s>
<s> And about XP. </s>
<s> It doesn't support USB 2.0 out of the box, drives over 127GB and SATA until service packs and even then SATA can be problematic. </s>
<s> It's age is showing. </s>
