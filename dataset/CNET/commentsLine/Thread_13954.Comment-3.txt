unfortunally, the 64-bit blockade will prevent you from using your computer for no more than 2 years unless cpu is 64-bit.
also, windows vista is hardware demanding.
then there's the stupid drm issue.
so it may not work at all, but who knows?
now when you say &quot;use a computer for 10 years&quot;, how do you use it?
i have a 10 year old pc that runs fine for word, but it won't run any of the latest software or games.
but refurbs are a great buy.
