The new 1Tb HD is made by someone.
If WD or Seagate, they provide s/w to help install and prepare and others provide similar(I assume).
That should include any partitioning s/w as well.
Just be darn sure you are addressing that new HD.
Once only the partitioning is done you can access it for Linux as it should see a prepared HD awaiting use and direct the Linux there.
I'm unsure if GParted is capable under Win8 use but it has provided partitioning setups for prior OSes.
http://gparted.sourceforge.net/download.php Before you attempt anything, be sure you have a working back-up or recovery discs made in order to restore you current setup, just in case.
