i use windows xp home edition amd athlon 64 3500+ western digital raptor SATA 74 gb hard drive Anyways lately my hard drive space is so low ( can't seem to keep it under 10 %) that my disk defragger ( diskeeper ) say it is hurting performance No matter how much crap i've deleted last few days: games i no longer play, mpeg videos, etc.
the drive seems to be not getting any better.
next day goes back down to about 7 %.
I've had this pc for about a year now and this just started happening.
I obviously empty the recycle bin i have norton anti Virus and internet security, but dont seem to have norton protected recycle that i can see Please help Ron
