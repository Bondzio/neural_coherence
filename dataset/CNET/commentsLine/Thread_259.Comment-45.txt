kees: i began to work thru the article to which mr. proffitt referred me last night, but by 1 a.m. there was so much tooing and froing that i went to bed.
i have tried to follow all the messages late last night -- i live in the edt zone -- and without much sleep got up and tried to follow again all the messages.
i downloaded guidinghelp last night also.
i had other things to do today -- proffitt ridiculed me for telling him what i had done as he asked me to do -- and i just got back to the computer and i have finally uninstalled nero and roxio.
i didn't realize roxio was named easy suchandsuch.
as i'm writing this, i got a message saying i have another message.
for now, i'm going back to the article.
when i tried this before, proffitt kept writing me saying if i didn't do what he told me to do he wouldn't tell me anymore.
soooooooooooooooooooooo, for now, i'm signing off and going back to the article and when i do all it has told me to do, i'll come back.
honestly, guys, i've been told so much in the last 18 hours that my brain is more scrambled than usual.
