yes, when i started the computer some writing came up on the screen (is this a bios display) saying the memory had changed.
a friend called up to me yesterday (he worked in dell before so i suppose he knows the inside of a computer better than me) and just did the old fashioned thing.
he took out the memory stick and put it back in and its working fine now.
one problem i have now though is when i open ms word it takes longer than it should, like 10 - 15 seconds and sometimes when i right click on a file it takes a while for the options to appear.
i have all my antivirus software up to date and did a full system scan which didnt detect anything.
could the slowdown be due to spyware perhaps or cookies?
