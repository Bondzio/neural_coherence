1.2.1	When my granddaughter was starting to crawl at about six months of age , we rebuilt an old Mac , loaded Baby Banger or something similar , and set it on the floor .	St
1.2.2	By the age of 2 1/2 , she was more computer literate than many of the adults I know .	St
1.2.3	She was surfing the web ( with supervision , of course ) and playing games that would teach her early math and word and shape recognition .	St
1.2.4	She would sit on my lap and video chat with relatives spread out across the country .	St
1.2.5	She is truly a technology baby !	St
1.2.6	= )	St
1.3.1	My daughter is a first grade teacher .	St
1.3.2	This year the class had 3 assignments that required the use of Powerpoint .	St
1.3.3	Apparently the school plans to use more computer time beginning with this group .	St
1.3.4	Several children already knew how to change fonts , colors & print .	St
1.4.1	We had little choice about when to introduce our Grandson to computers : his mother was a web addict and if he was to have any attention at all it had to be in front of the monitor .	St
1.4.2	When we got custody of him he used chatroom language and knew how to do a chat reply even though he had n't a clue what he was doing .	St
1.4.3	We immediately decreed our computers off limits except for one hour weekend days when we explored toddler-to-K learnware with him ( also spent more hours than i want to remember on bubblewrap !	St
1.4.4	gro-oan ! ) .	St
1.4.5	He was about 5 when we got him a computer of his own in order to keep him off of our business use machines ... loaded it with all learnware and draw/paint stuff , NO INTERNET .	St
1.4.6	So we did the ReaderRabbit and Candyland thing til we heard the tunes in our sleep ... and have gradually aged him up .	St
1.4.7	He is 8 now and they are learning proper computer use at school , so now we have set up internet access 1/2 hour on school afternoons and 1 hour on weekends ... only has links to select sites and one of us is within sight of his monitor frequently during his online time .	St
1.4.8	I know we sound like paranoid fuddyduddies , but this seems right for our family .	St
1.4.9	Last weekend he about blew Gramma away when he appeared at her elbow and asked her to show him how to do spreadsheets ... seems he thinks it would help him with math !	St
1.4.10	This is great because for now we want him to see the computer as a tool , not as a social substitute or his mechanical friend .	St
1.5.1	as i mentioned in my response to bob 's question - it was a great experience .	St
1.5.2	my son was almost 3 & had always been in the office with us working so we got some little learning programs ( sesame street , putt-putt , etc ) and set him up in the office with us on an old laptop .	St
1.5.3	in NO time he was absolutely comfortable with the whole thing & does much of his school work on his own laptop ( bought it for him new 5 years ago ) .	St
1.5.4	NOTE : he is not a computer junkie - would rather be outside playing , but since the world now runs on computers , we felt the earlier he got proficient with them , the better .	St
1.6.1	but i got my first pc/laptop was when i was 4 years old but it was only one of those teaching ones .	St
1.6.2	but i first started using a real computer when i was about 6 or 7 , and im 15 now so yer .	St
1.6.3	i would recomend you get your childs first computer/laptop would be around 8 or 9 , just becouse they 'll have a better unerstanding then when there only 5 or 6 , cause they 'll just think its a toy .	St
1.6.4	but thats just my opinion .	St
1.7.1	In our society today our young people must be able to use and understand the computer .	St
1.7.2	I introduced my child at the young age of 6 and today he knows more about the computer as well as networking than I do .	St
1.7.3	If our young people are to stay with the times they must have access to a computer , but please remember this ! ! !	St
1.7.4	As parents we need to monitor their use and where they may go and what they are doing .	St
1.7.5	The computer is a useful tool however the sick have found a way to use it in evil ways .	St
1.7.6	So at the same time our children must learn they also need to be protected from the sick and the evil .	St
1.7.7	If you look computers are becoming a way of school , it is called Cyber school .	St
1.8.1	I have four children , the oldest of whom is now 17 .	St
1.8.2	We introduced him to the computer at the age of 2 - we had some basic children 's freeware on our computer which taught colors and matching skills .	St
1.8.3	My other three children began using our PC at around the same age .	St
1.8.4	They loved having the independence to play games by themselves ( all of which were educational and all of which necessitated some amount of parental involvement and teaching at the beginning ) .	St
1.8.5	We did not allow internet access until they were older and could access it responsibly .	St
1.8.6	My youngest , now 8 years old , is only allowed on sites approved by us and placed on her desktop .	St
1.9.1	I have pictures to prove it .	St
1.9.2	He now has a degree in Electrical Engineering but really loves the system administration aspect of work .	St
1.9.3	His EE is just an attribute to his success .	St
1.9.4	His early computer interests at three spearheaded him to be an expert by eight .	St
1.9.5	While in college he assisted his room mate computer engineering friends in assisting in their studies .	St
1.9.6	The earlier you start them the better , there is much to learn and know and he loves his job at CNET .	St
1.10.1	I am sure that anyone could say that I am NOT a whole lot of things that would make me and expert on the subject , but I believe that once a child is near three years of age , it is time to get some of the GOOD software that young children like and that is educational .	St
1.10.2	I am NOT in favor of pointless , or in any way violent .	St
1.10.3	I had good luck with shopping for VERY GOOD educational software for the kids I have raised , and today they know some things about computers that I need their help with .	St
1.10.4	My experience with computers began in 1969 on a full time basis , so I am not totally ignorant , but there is an endless amount of knowledge a person can acquire using computers .	St
1.10.5	For many years now , I have subscribed to and read one heck of a lot of consumer and professional level publications , and yet I feel that today I am a mere novice when it comes to & quot ; knowing everything about computers. & quot ; Kids learn things I have never done , and sometimes I have to ask .

1.12.1	We bought our kids a computer when the oldest on e was in kindergarten .	St
1.12.2	It was an Apple IIC .	St
1.12.3	When my oldest went to 1st and 2nd grade , there were computers in the classroom , but the teachers did n't know how to use them .	St
1.12.4	I always thought that was funny ( in a not too good of way ) .	St
1.12.5	The school bragged that they had computers in the classroom and were so progressive , but the teachers were not trained and the computers mostly gathered dust in the corner .	St
1.12.6	My son taught his teachers how to use the Apples in the classroom .	St
1.12.7	My son is 28 now , so that was along time ago and the schools and teachers in our school system are much better trained .	St
1.12.8	Everything was new then .	St
1.13.1	I introduced my daughter to the computer in the dark pre-Internet days .	St
1.13.2	Mostly with games , educational software , and paint software .	St
1.13.3	As she grew up , she was building web sites in the 6th grade and her own domain by the time she was in high school .	St
1.13.4	She is completely proficient in Office apps , searching the web , and has installed/uninstalled more apps and games than I remember .	St
1.13.5	Ironically , her interests are in the environment , the computer is a useful tool for her .	St
1.13.6	Whe 's one of the most talented PowerPoint users I have ever seen ( and I teach the subject ) .	St

1.14.2	The Minnesota Educational Computer Consortium set up a lab .	St
1.14.3	in an office building in Roseville MN and many children got their first exposure to simple games , like the Oregon Trail , there .	St
1.14.4	My two boys were regular visitors and enjoyed the experience .	St
1.14.5	Both have gone on to be computer- savvy adults who are n't in the computer industry .	St
1.14.6	See http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_ ( computer_game )	St
1.15.1	My daughter was introduced to computers at age 5 in kindigarten way back in 1980 .	St
1.15.2	That was when I decided I better get some training in computers myself which helped me in job hunting .	St
1.15.3	We did n't have one our self until 1990 .	St

1.18.1	And the result has been great .	St
1.18.2	My children are now 22 and 21 .	St
1.18.3	Non of them have studied computer sciene as myself but use the computer as part of their body .	St
1.18.4	I hardly receive any questions about operation , better , I 'm explained when they do remarkable computer related documents .	St
1.18.5	On the Internet access which they have had irrestricted since children ( I remember ICQ ) , they learnt to deal with spam and porn related subjects to a point in which they filtered automatically all non desired subjects .	St
1.18.6	They 've become great students and I 'm sure the computer has done some work on that matter .	St
1.19.1	Birth ... 2 boys 17 & 13	St
1.20.1	My daughter had just turned two years old .	St
1.20.2	I must say , she was a bit curious as to , what this computer thing Daddy clicked around with , was all about .	St
1.20.3	Let 's be completely honest here .	St
1.20.4	Take into account , my 2 year old had an above average I.Q .	St
1.20.5	and her attention span was rather long for her age , so I decided to give her a chance to learn about my Dell Workstation .	St
1.20.6	I put her in my lap and found that , even though her hand size was fairly large for a two year old , she could n't hold the mouse and click all three buttons .	St
1.20.7	her little hand was just too small for the mouse .	St
1.20.8	To my surprise she solved the problem herself !	St
1.20.9	By turning the mouse sideways and by left clicking with her thumb and right clicking with her index finger above her thumb , she was able to make progress manipulating the mouse .	St
1.20.10	She was thrilled and I must say , I was thrilled also !	St
1.20.11	At first , she would only last 15 or 20 minutes and become bored enough , that Daddy ( me ) could have his magic mouse back for a day .	St
1.20.12	Each day she would come back for another 15 minutes .	St
1.20.13	As time passed that 15 minutes has turned into 2 hours plus !	St
1.20.14	Now I have to be patient and share my PC time with her .	St
1.20.15	By age three , the little tike had started checking my e-mail for me !	St
1.20.16	Now she is 8 years old and she still uses the mouse sideways !	St
1.20.17	She has her own e-mail and plays SimCity 4 game alot , which is probably her favorite sim game on the PC .	St
1.20.18	I have a very hard time believing , a child less than two could become much more envolved than my two year old did .	St
1.20.19	But , I have also had alot of fun reading about everyone 's baby computer geeks .	St
1.20.20	So , thank you everyone for the read .	Polite
1.20.21	Cheers , TheCrybKeeper/funkid	St
1.21.1	I introduced my twin boys to computers when they were about 3 years old .	St
1.21.2	I found a website with a mouse control game called & quot ; fireworks & quot ; , which allowed them to shoot rockets at the cursor , with either a left or right click .	St
1.21.3	They loved it .	Polite
1.21.4	Now I fight my wife ( every week ) to get them ( on average ) an hour each day on the computer ( 30 minutes each at the helm ) .	St
1.21.5	She somehow believes it is destroying their minds , turning them into couch potatoes or depriving them of precious exposure to sunlight .	St
1.21.6	I am sure that I am not the only father who has experienced this phenomenon .	St
1.21.7	( Have you ? )	Ques
1.21.8	Dennis ( American Expat , currently living in Prague , Czech Republic )	St
1.22.1	Not sure on this one , by Oramirez02 .	St
1.22.2	If it is true ; his/her two boys started with MSDos in 1990 .	St
1.22.3	At 3 years old ?	Ques
1.22.4	I 'm sorry to say , This one requires documented evidence , in my opinion .	St
1.22.5	Between two and three by oramirez02 - 5/24/08 11:04 AM	St
1.23.1	by DennHick I am sure that I am not the only father who has experienced this phenomenon .	St
1.23.2	( Have you ? )	Ques
1.23.3	________________________________________ Sorry to bump , but just for the record ; my wife does n't seem to meddle in it much .	St
1.23.4	Only to insure my 8 year old daughter gets her alotted time on-line .	St
1.23.5	Hmmmm , go figure ?	Ques
1.23.6	!	St
1.24.1	Yes Sir , I have an only daughter at home and sometimes I would have wished that she 'd have another sibling with her ! I , however , want her to be on her own.I was asking for some likely programmes that would help with her education yet be fun ? She loves the dressupmix programmes but that 's about all she 's got ! We have a Dell WindowsXP Desktop which we purchased last year !	St
1.25.1	My son started on computers really young - I was still in grad school when he was born , and his mom writes for a living and computers are much a part of our lives .	St
1.25.2	I guess for any kid or adult there 's risk of being too sedintary , but I do n't think computers are particularly the culprit .	St
1.25.3	My son has rationed & quot ; screen time , & quot ; and currently elects to spend it all on computer tasks ( which can be creative , educational , or recreational ) , with the exception of one night every week or two for movie night .	St
1.25.4	Consequently he , by choice , does n't watch TV .	St
1.25.5	Myself , I 'm happy for that .	St
1.25.6	I think the key is not to ration TV time , per se , but ration TV/Xbox/Computer time .	St
1.25.7	He 's 11 , knows his way around a mobo , can change a cpu , has formed his opinions about which OSs he likes for which tasks , .	St
1.25.8	.	St
1.25.9	.	St
1.25.10	It is VERY important that kids not be let online without monitoring or restrictions .	St
1.25.11	With me right there beside him , he 's already been approached for & quot ; hot cyberz & quot ; by some sick perv at a s'posedly safe game spot on-line .	St
1.26.1	NIL	St
1.27.1	My son has been playing with the computer since he was three , he has just turned five and surfs the web , downloads programs , games and can spell and read very well .	St
1.27.2	I would be grateful if there is anyone out there that can advise me if the computer skills he has should and in what manner they should be developed .	Ques
