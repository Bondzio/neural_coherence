and then open the computer's case.
you'd need to determine whether the drive was sata or pata by the rear connectors.
you'd need to attach the drive to an available port on the mb if sata.
if pata, it could be attached by an unused plug on a cable or open ide port on the mb but there may be jumpers to deal with.
it's not that difficult but depends on your own comfort level with trying this.
