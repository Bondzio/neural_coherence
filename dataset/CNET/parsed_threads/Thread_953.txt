<s> Hello, I own an HP Pavilion Elite HPE-400y (Specs) http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsuppor...t.jsp?objectID=c02481314&prodSeriesId=4269972 I have replaced the power supply with a 600w Corsair power supply and an NVIDIA gtx 550 ti I have been having trouble with it overheating to incredibly high temperature. </s>
<s> (GPU at and under 100 degrees and CPU at and around 70 degrees) I need help modifying it in terms of cooling it down as much as possible. </s>
<s> Since I am a novice at computer hardware modifications I figured you guys could give me good advice on what I should do to make it run cooler, whether it be new fans, heat sinks, liquid cooling, a new case, etc. </s>
<s> If you recommend one of the above can you also suggest a replacement part that I might be able to use? </s>
<s> If you need any more information I am more than happy to provide it. </s>
<s> And yes I blow the dust out of the fans regularly. </s>
<s> Thanks a bunch all . </s>

<s> Are those temps in &quot;f&quot; or &quot;c&quot;? </s>
<s> If &quot;f&quot; ........your good. </s>
<s> If &quot;c&quot; .......take the side cover off....test. </s>
<s> Try a different temp monitor. </s>
<s> You could add an exhaust fan like the one here http://www.microcenter.com/product/209741/Case_Exhaust_Fan-Video_Card_Cooler_Fan Not knowing how old this PC is or whether it might need new thermal paste, I can only say that this could be a consideration, expecially if this computer is more than a couple of years old. </s>
<s> ` Good luck. </s>
<s> Celcius. </s>
<s> I will try in a bit. </s>
<s> Ill take it under consideratoin nad i got it in may 2011 sorry for not clariying </s>
<s> be placed, I'd start there. </s>
<s> If you have existing fans that don't remove enough heat....perhaps a more robust or larger fan could be used. </s>
<s> Most of these case fans can connect directly to the PSU and many have adapters too. </s>
<s> Here's the link I used. </s>
<s> If there are no existing/unused case vents, you may have to make (cut) your own. </s>

<s> This is your basic OEM build PC from HP. </s>
<s> 1st the AMD cpu tends to run slightly hotter, but well cooled by most setups. </s>
<s> However, once added &quot;hot air&quot; is thrown in it starts to create heat build-up. </s>
<s> Your new GPU will do that, so be sure its fan or cooling setup is well cared for. </s>
<s> As others suggested, added cooling can greatly improve the situation. </s>
<s> They already covered that so I add, either add more fans or improve(replace) current fan(s) for better RPMs for air exchange. </s>
<s> Make darn sure how that new PSU is working with its fans, some maybe counter to accepted OEM &quot;air flow&quot;, so inspect. </s>
<s> If optional range setting, increase it. </s>
