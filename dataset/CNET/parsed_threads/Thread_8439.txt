<s> I a buying a new pc. </s>
<s> Planning to do a lot of gaming on it. </s>
<s> Is a Creative Audio X-FI PCI card worth $79? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> Though I will not be at my pc for a while and may not respond. </s>
<s> While I didn't hear much difference in the headphones the RECORDING was stellar compared to almost every onboard sound system I've tried. </s>

<s> and in fact I use the X-Fi Fidelity with Creative speakers. </s>
<s> Very satisfied. </s>
<s> Comes with some fairly good software as well. </s>
<s> x-fi has lower cpu usage (which means higher framerates in games) and it sounds much better than built-in sound. </s>
<s> creative's eax implementation is way better than most built-in stuff so you'll hear sounds clearer, with better directional placing, and great environmental effects. </s>
<s> Good Sound Card + cheap speakers = wasted time and effort. </s>
<s> Would it be worth having a 2.1 audio system with it? </s>
<s> If so what would be best for the money? </s>
