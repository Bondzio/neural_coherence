Hi, I'm really new to computers and graphics cards and what not.
What is considered a good framerate.
For instance, I have a P4 3.0ghz with ATI RADEON x600 and I get around 28-30 fps on half life 2, it's played around medium.
There is no lag, but the graphics look awesome anyhow.
Once I get around 25 fps, its starts to lag.
I've never seen a game on HDTV with a high end machine, so I'm wondering, is the difference really noticeable?
