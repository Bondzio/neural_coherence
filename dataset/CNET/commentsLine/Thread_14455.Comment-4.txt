what everyone forgot to mention here was the fact that emachies has a shutdown temp control in the bios and if your cpu gets to hot, it won't boot or function.
replace the cpu fan for fifteen\twenty bucks, it will recognize the fan is going, temp down and it may run again.
i own one so i know, replaced my fan, had same problem.
there is a chance the cpu is dead but i would try it.
good luck, paul
