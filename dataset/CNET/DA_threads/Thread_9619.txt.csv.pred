1.2.1	All computers need a graphic card to work .	St
1.2.2	Your laptop , of course , has one .	St
1.2.3	Now you say your S-Video cable does n't work .	St
1.2.4	Here is the thing .	St
1.2.5	S-Video is not good for Computer-to-TV .	St
1.2.6	Tell me , what is the make/model of your TV ?	Ques
1.2.7	Better yet , what inputs ( holes ) does it have on the back .	St
1.2.8	Does it have a Blue monitor plug ?	Ques
1.2.9	Or DVI ?	Ques

1.2.12	A work-around : This may or may not work .	St
1.2.13	Right-click your desktop , click properties .	St
1.2.14	Click the Settings tab .	St
1.2.15	Look at the slide bar on the right hand side .	St
1.2.16	Drag it all the way to the left .	St
1.2.17	Then plug the cable in again .	St
1.2.18	S-Video is primarily used for TV to DVD player or TV to VCR .	St
1.2.19	S-Video can not display the amount of pixels that your monitor has .	St

1.3.1	I have a Toshiba Satellite also .	St
1.3.2	Any type of copy-protected content ( such as a commercial DVD ) will only display on your laptop 's screen .	St
1.3.3	If it displayed it on your TV , then it could be recorded .	St
1.3.4	( I know , it 's a pain in the butt .	St
1.3.5	When I travel I 'd much rather carry a few DVDs and watch them on the hotel 's TV rather than pay $ 6 for a movie . )	St
1.3.6	There are some hacks for WinDVD that will turn off this feature .	St
1.3.7	You could also rip the DVD to disk and remove the copy protection .	St
1.3.8	But I do n't think we discuss stuff like that in this forum .	St
1.3.9	( google )	St
1.4.1	I always thought if you 'd mirror it as a copy in the settings it 'd have to be a copy of it .	St
1.4.2	Thanks for the info !	St
