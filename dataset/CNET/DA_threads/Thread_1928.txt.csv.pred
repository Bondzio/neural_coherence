1.1.1	Old PC : Dell 8200 , 2 HDD 's ( 1 Maxtor 80GB for OS and apps , 1 WD 80GB for misc files ) , Intel III 1.8GHz , 512KB RAM .	St
1.1.2	Win XP Pro .	St
1.1.3	New PC : eMachines T6212 , 1 HDD ( Seagate Barracuda 160MB ) , AMD 3200+ , 1GB RAM .	St
1.1.4	Win XP Home .	St
1.1.5	I ghosted my Maxtor drive to the Seagate NTFS partition wihtout a problem .	St
1.1.6	However , the Seagate drive shows two partitions with two logical drive letters ( F : ( FAT32 ) and G : ( NTFS ) ) .	St
1.1.7	I tried booting up the new drive in the new machine and I either get a missing hal.dll error or the machine goes straight into the RECOVERY mode ( which is resident on the FAT32 partition ) .	St
1.1.8	When I put the old drive in the new PC , it comes up fine ( BTW : this was after I changed the IDE interface to standard ) .	St
1.1.9	So , I ghosted the FAT partition from the old drive to the FAT ( 32 ) partition of the new drive which would then make everything the same , right ?	Ques
1.1.10	Nope .	St
1.1.11	The new PC says something like & quot ; booting from partition & quot ; or something like that .	St
1.1.12	It does n't make sense to me that the old drive works in the new PC but the new drive does n't work even though they are identical now .	St
1.1.13	I do n't have the original Win XP Pro CD , so I have had to restore the new drive using the emachines restore CD 's and therefore , I am back at square one .	St
1.1.14	I really do n't want to put an older drive in a new machine especially when I should be able to use the new drive which has double the capacity in the new PC .	St
1.1.15	Any ideas on how I can get my OS , apps , settings , and everything from my old drive to the new drive for the new PC ?	Ques
1.1.16	( w/p a Win XP Pro CD ) .	St
1.2.1	Look up ALOHA BOB PC RELOCATOR which does much of what you are after .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Usualy you would use the XP files and transfer wizard to do this , it takes you step by step on how to do this .	St
1.3.2	John	St
1.4.1	Would n't cloning an entire hard drive be better than buying a app transfer utility ?	Ques
1.4.2	Cons with using Aloha Bob ( ref PC Mag ) : Not all apps work after migration , requiring reinstallations .	St
1.5.1	Same thing .	St
1.5.2	Would n't cloning a drive be better than using a file transfer utility ?	Ques
1.5.3	PC MAG on F.A.S.T .	St
1.5.4	Pros : Comes with Windows XP .	St
1.5.5	Transfers Windows and Outlook settings as well as files .	St
1.5.6	Simple and straightforward .	St
1.5.7	Cons : No-frills tool with primitive interface provides limited user control , no reports , no undo capability , no application transfer .	St
1.5.8	Bottom Line : Provides bare-bones migration of essential data files and Windows settings .	St
1.5.9	Good just for basic transfer .	St
1.6.1	You do n't have the full XP to fix what is busted .	St
