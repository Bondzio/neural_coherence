Your BIOS could indeed need updating.
Try that first before accepting what I'm about to say.
That second memory slot is bad.
If it is and you don't want to get a newer motherboard, get a 512 stick and use it until you can get a new motherboard.
Then you can get another 512 and really hum along!
and life goes on... Jack
