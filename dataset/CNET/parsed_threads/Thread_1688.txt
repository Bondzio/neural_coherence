<s> with one of my PCs getting on line. </s>
<s> After a boot it works perfectly and will for hours. </s>
<s> But if I let it sit idle for a while I can't get on line. </s>
<s> A reboot fixes it. </s>
<s> I've tried everything short of a format and reinstall XP Home SP-2. </s>
<s> (See previous thread.) </s>
<s> Changing router ports (broadband connection), Winsock Fix, reinstall networking, everything I can find at Windows Help, nothing fixes it, not even repair connection. </s>
<s> Can someone recommend a little cheap, free utility like some sort of keep alive to ping something every once in a while? </s>
<s> if so, and you have it set to automatically lock after a set time or when the screen saver activates, then you will see a gold or red lock at the bottom, next to clock. </s>
<s> If you right click, then click on engage internet lock or stop all internet activity, it still might not connect. </s>
<s> Try turning off the radio and wait about 10 seconds then enable the radio. </s>
<s> That should work. </s>

<s> You probably have this covered, but just to make sure: Latest router firmware Latest network adapter driver (reinstall if latest) Latest network adapter adapter firmware (if upgradeable, usually pc card adapters)? </s>
<s> Adapter sleep/power save mode is disabled? </s>
<s> DHCP client lease time set in router or none? </s>
<s> What network adapter model? </s>
<s> ZA is set to standard. </s>
<s> I've even disabled it. </s>
<s> What happens is, after I surf, then let the PC sit idle for a while, I click either IE or FF, and the first attempt fails. </s>
<s> Usually a second attempt will get on line, but sometimes not. </s>
<s> It's all so random other than the fact that after it sits, it won't get on line. </s>
<s> A reboot and all is normal, until it sits for a while. </s>
<s> Firmware = current NIC - onboard = latest firmware. </s>
<s> Even removed it and reinstalled it. </s>
<s> Removed and reinstalled Networking. </s>
<s> Adapter power setting is NOT set to allow Windows to power off. </s>
<s> Have set router with DHCP assigned to this specific MAC address, this is my web server. </s>
<s> This started happening after I cloned this drive. </s>
<s> This was wife's PC and had a 20 Gig HD. </s>
<s> Because she was saving a lot of music for her iPod, I cloned an 80 Gig drive using MaxBlast. </s>
<s> The clone went perfectly and have had zero problems. </s>
<s> Except this. </s>
<s> That's why I reinstalled the NIC from the motherboard software. </s>
<s> I've also run sfc, and done an XP repair install. </s>
<s> I disabled the NIC in the BIOS and installed a D-link PCI NIC. </s>
<s> Upon powering up XP went nuts, said I had made major changes to my system and wanted to reactivate. </s>
<s> I said ok but I couldn't get connected. </s>
<s> I removed the NIC, put it back the way I found it, powered up, XP wanted to activate, I said yes, done. </s>
<s> I'm just short of doing a reformat and reinstall. </s>
<s> Unless someone can point me to a keep alive utility. </s>
<s> to put back the 20GB HDD? </s>
<s> Would affirm or refute your suspicion. </s>
<s> That drive is already in another PC. </s>
<s> to turn off the radio when you are not using it. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> It's my web server for my site, it's on 24/7. </s>
<s> I don't surf often, just for updates and such. </s>
<s> But it's a pain to reboot whenever I need to update XP and my Anti-Parasite Suite. </s>
<s> Just a little simple keep alive utility would probably solve my problem. </s>
<s> using an email program and checking your email every 5 or 10 minutes, it would then show that you are activly using the computer. </s>
<s> Rick People had the same problem with AOL a while back. </s>
<s> I can't remember the program that they used. </s>
<s> I Googled: free &quot;ping utility&quot; regular time interval I got a couple links that may be promising. </s>
<s> I have never used this software, so I don't recommend any of these from experience. </s>
<s> Check it out: http://www.vicman.net/lib/continuous/ping Scroll down to FREEping - Server Pinging 2.0 . </s>
<s> Part of the description reads as follows: FREEping is a free ping software utility which will ping all your IP addresses in free-definable intervals. </s>
<s> FREEping automatically pings in the background and shows statistics for each pinged hosts. </s>
<s> Looks promising, thanks. </s>
<s> we'll see what happens. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
