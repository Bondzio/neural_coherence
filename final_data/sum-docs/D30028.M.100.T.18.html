Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to Damascus on Sunday to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey.
The talks come as Turkey has massed forces near the border with Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases in the neighboring country.
The Turkish government, which sent about 10,000 soldiers into northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebels, has said it might send forces into Syria to eradicate guerrilla bases there, according to news reports.
Turkey's incursion into northern Iraq on Friday followed two days of airstrikes against suspected rebel bases, the daily Hurriyet said Saturday.
Syria has reacted angrily to Turkey's blossoming friendship with Israel.
