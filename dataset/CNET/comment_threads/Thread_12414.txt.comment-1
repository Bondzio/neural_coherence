I just bought a toshiba sattelite laptop running win xp home sp2.
i connect using cable modem, wireless router belkin (802.11g).The LAN connection is working but wireless is giving me a headache, it does not see the conection but when i ping it finds the connection.
I have another laptop connected wirelessly without problems.
I need help.
My ISP will not help off course its not their equipment.
Thanks Tande
