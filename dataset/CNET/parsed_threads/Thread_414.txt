<s> Hello my name is Rab from the UK I got my NEC ND-3500A a long long time ago it was intalled for me but I dont know alot about it or hardware for that matter.I use it alot for data backup and making recorded movies into dvds. </s>
<s> I have never had a problem with buying DVD discs until now. </s>
<s> For how long I have had this drive I have not noticed that not every DVD disc is compatible I guess it was just luck I was buying the right type all this time. </s>
<s> Anyway I got myself a pack of sony DVD-R 120min/4.7gb 16x/1x dvd discs to burn some stuff and the DVD dont work with my burning software Nero 7 and Ashampoo Burning Studio 6. </s>
<s> I really dont understand why they dont work when I have used other brands but the same type of discs before like: EMTEC DVD-R 4.7gb 120min and Datawrite 8x DVD-R 4.7gb. </s>
<s> This has only made confusion on the quest to find out what discs to buy in the future. </s>
<s> Well the question to you nice people is: What type of DVD discs are compatible with my NEC ND-3500A? </s>
<s> e.g. </s>
<s> DVD+R What is the difference between DVD-R and DVD+R? </s>
<s> What are the ''good'' brand names of DVDs? </s>
<s> Thanks for reading my topic. </s>
<s> a list of recommended media ...might give that a try. </s>
<s> Or perhaps CDRINFO.COM. </s>
<s> I have a NEC3550A and used CDRs by Imation and DVDs by TDK successfully. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thank you for the tips. </s>
<s> By any chance would you have a link to recommended media? </s>
<s> My aim here is to get my 3 questions answered hopefully. </s>
<s> So if anyone would like to add on to this topic then please do. </s>
<s> I found out this: Media/Mode Supported: DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD0+R, DVD+R9, DVD+RW, DVD-Video, CD-ROM, CD-ROM XA, CD-Audio, CD Extra, CD Text, CD-I Ready, CD-Bridge, Photo-CD, Video-CD, Hybrid-CD Which helps me alot but now I dont understand why my Sony DVD-R discs are not working. </s>
<s> So Should I be using DVD-R or DVD+R? </s>
<s> I found this site telling me recommended media: http://www.sw.nec.co.jp/products/optical/en/ND-3500A/3500Amedia_list_21A.html DVD+R DL(Double Layer) Media & brands! </s>
<s> If anyone out there can recommended discs for NEC ND-3500A please do. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Nevermind I just find the old discs i used. </s>
