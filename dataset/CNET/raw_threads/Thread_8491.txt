Sorry, but this could be a story about a fresh install of an OS and expecting Microsoft to get all the drivers but I can't tell. I know it's a lot of information to ask for but I can't see what's missing from what you've provided. If I had this setup it would work, but I know to install motherboard drivers and more. Bob
