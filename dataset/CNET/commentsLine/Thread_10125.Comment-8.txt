willy; what's your opinion on installing the dual fan hd coolers that attach directly to the hd, and memory stick cool-covers?
i have a really good heat sink cooler and two other 80mm fans (1 front and 1 back)installed already.
sure would like to get your opinion on the cooling devices i mentioned above though.
thanks a bunch!
