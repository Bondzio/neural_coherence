the machine that &quot;serves&quot; up the files would have to have accounts maintained and then we use ntfs permissions to grant or deny each account access to what we see fit.
as there are plenty of web pages on ntfs permissions i must stop at that point.
many go nuts over all the maintenance, the tedius account and if you had xp home the 5 user limit.
that's why businesses usually end up on a server.
