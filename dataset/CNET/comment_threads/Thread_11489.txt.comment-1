I found this on Craig's List (Yes, I know...)I am wondering if you fine people could advise me on whether or not this would be worth the $360.
It's custom: AMD athlon 64x2 6000+ 3.0ghz dual core processor 2x2gb DDR2 1066mhz Ram by gskill EVGA nvidia 9500gt 512mb video card with dual monitor support 80gb 7200rpm Sata 2 3.0gbs HD LG DVD burner w silent run tech.
Gigabyte Mid tower black light gloss case Antec tricool 120mm rear exhaust fan with 3 speed switch ECS 8200a motherboard with HDMI Antec smartpower power supply rated at 400w Here is where I found it: http://worcester.craigslist.org/sys/1034367509.html Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Also, I was informed the graphics card is about mid-level?
as far as cards go.
And the psu isn't very good.
I am not big time gamer, but I would like to get into it a little.
Would it be worth buying this, and then buying a new graphics card/psu?
I also have a 19&quot; hd monitor and 160 gb hdd that I can throw into it.
