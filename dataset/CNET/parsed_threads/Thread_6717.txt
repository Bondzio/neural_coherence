<s> I have an HP Compaq dv7100 Small Form Factor Desktop that I want to upgrade the Processor in. </s>
<s> It is an HP 097Ch Motherboard with and Intel i915G Chipset and an LGA 775 Processor Socket. </s>
<s> It currently has a Prescott Pentium 4 HT 530 3.0Ghz Processor and I am wondering if there is a processor upgrade for this older Desktop that would be worth it. </s>
<s> I know the LGA 775 was used all the way up to the Core 2 Extreme quad-cores, but I would imagine this machine would only be capable of maybe a Pentium D. On the HP website it only shows Pentium 4 and Celeron processors but I do believe that is just what they were sold with </s>

<s> If this is being done as a challenge to see if it can be done it might be interesting but as to whether it is a technically or economically sound upgrade, that I would question. </s>
<s> There are more things to consider than just the processor in such a modification. </s>
<s> 3.0GHz was about the top of the line CPU for that CPU line. </s>
<s> You would do much better to research what else can be changed. </s>
<s> For most folk they are looking to get the video up to speed. </s>
<s> Research if you can pop in one of the 30 to 50 buck ATI 5450 1GB video cards in this machine. </s>
<s> It is one of the best last upgrades that won't have you change the power supply. </s>

<s> This is currently just an old PC that isn't really doing anything but is soon to be turned into mainly just a music computer. </s>
<s> I have already Upgraded RAM to 3.0GB DDR PC3200 (Maximum as I'm currently only running 32-Bit OS), and I just ordered a New Video-Card for the PC. </s>
<s> For me it is mainly the challenge, I enjoy doing this and even if it doesn't show in much in actual performance it's more for the heck of it anyways. </s>
<s> I really haven't had a problem with the P4 HT 3.0 in this system, it's actually a relatively fast Processor, and unitl recently I did not know it was a 64-Bit Capable processor. </s>
<s> Just wondering if there is anything faster that can physically be put into the system. </s>
<s> I have actually already bought a Video card for the system and upgraded the Ram. </s>
<s> I was just wondering if there was any other processor that was better that could be compatible with the board. </s>
<s> I'm more of an AMD guy, so I understand board capabilities and the Processor Sockets better with the AMD's. </s>
<s> The fact the LGA 775 was used for a wide selection of Processors makes it difficult to know which ones are compatible or not. </s>
<s> I know that TDP is one of the main factors, but I see that a lot of the Core 2 Duo's have a TDP of 65W which is far lower than the current Pentium 4 at 84W. </s>
<s> Are the Pentium 4 HT's and the Celeron's the only compatible Processors with this board? </s>
<s> For me it's not a big deal. </s>
<s> This processor is probably more than I'll ever need, but I've been migrating most of my systems to Windows 7 and I was just wondering if there was a plausible upgrade for this system. </s>
<s> I have a few AM2 boards that had low end Semprons that I just upgraded to Athlon Dual-Cores and I was just wondering if there was something similar for this line of LGA 775 Socket. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the info! </s>
<s> Only thing is, this isn't quite my motherboard. </s>
<s> I found the correct one on the HP website later. </s>
<s> Reason being is that this one supports DDR2 Ram, mine only supports DDR. </s>
<s> Thanks anyways. </s>
<s> Here's the hurdle for OEM based systems when considering cpu swaps. </s>
<s> The main issue besides finding a cpu that actually uses the LGA775 is the family and class it has to reside with. </s>
<s> Basically, that's a drop-in and forget. </s>
<s> the other side is the bios support for that cpu and the chipset which in turn can use or allow full access to the cpu abilities. </s>
<s> That in turn is not a given, which again is best found under the family and class of cpu. </s>
<s> I find reviewing the mtrbd. </s>
<s> specs and the chipset will provide much of the basic info. </s>
<s> Since this is an Intel cpu you find it at the support website and check against the tables provided. </s>
<s> Locate yours and notice the specs, now find similar matching specs, which in turn you're looking for a faster one, typically. </s>
<s> Next, locate that the FSB etc. </s>
<s> are supported by that mtrbd. </s>
<s> now you match all this and then find a cpu. </s>
<s> That;'s where the bios comes in, its best to have the latest already installed prior to any cpu swap. </s>
<s> Swap cpu and hope it acknowledges it and allows its use. </s>
<s> Most OEM don't allow you to tweek or tune if at all, it's a accept or reject sort of thing or less than desired install. </s>
<s> You can drop-in a LGA775 cpu but it may not always be a good one, again because of the bios setting needs. </s>
<s> So check and double check before you do this. </s>
<s> Overall, you won't damage the cpu if LGA775 allowable. </s>
<s> Alas, use the &quot;stock number&quot; on the cpu itself for best info and Intel tables once cleaned of paste. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Taken from the HP/Compaq support website: http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11948_div/11948_div.HTML Now clean your cpu of paste locate stock number and then find from that Compaq what can be done or found by comparing specs. </s>
