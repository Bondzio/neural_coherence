Thank you so much for replying Steven Haninger!
I have a wired connection, cable.
Cable plugged into modem and modem plugged into PC.
That's it.
I know there are USB Flash drive-sized wireless ADAPTERS, that pick up wireless from existing access points.
But I would like to know if there's a flash drive-sized router.
Where I can plug it into my wired PC and it will broadcast my internet.
I just want an access point made from my wired connection, but not with something as big as a router.
Thanks again for all your help!
