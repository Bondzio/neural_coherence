<s> Hi, I just added a second hard drive to my Dell Dimention 4550 running Windows XP. </s>
<s> Everything went great. </s>
<s> I set the jumper, installed the new drive and powered the pc. </s>
<s> The hardware wizard came up and detected the new drive. </s>
<s> I then went to Administrative Tools/Computer Management/Disk Management. </s>
<s> My new drive is shown in the lower part of the screen as Disk 1. </s>
<s> I know I need to initialize and format the disk. </s>
<s> I looked over the help which said that this could be done by right clicking the drive on the disk management screen. </s>
<s> The problem is the new drive does not appear in the upper part of the Disk Management display. </s>
<s> How in the heck do you initialize a new hard drive. </s>
<s> I can usually figure this stuff out but I give. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Read &quot;The Manual Initialization Method&quot; where we get to write the &quot;signature&quot; to the drive. </s>
