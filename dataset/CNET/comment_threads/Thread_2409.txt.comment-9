Going to a data recovery firm is a little late, once you have tried to recover and reformatted/partitioned it is extremely unlikely you can get anything back.
I have clients that have paid Ontrack and others to get their data back, and it has been successful, but it has cost $1500-$120000, and getting back data from a RAID array is in the higher priced range because of the complexity involved.
In your case you posted your questions for help too late.
