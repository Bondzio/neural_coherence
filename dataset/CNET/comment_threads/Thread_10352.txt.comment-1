These days, I'm hearing more and more about Alienware--&quot;extremely&quot; good things, and &quot;extremely&quot; bad.
Here are just two examples: http://reviews.cnet.com/Alienware_Aurora_ALX_SLI/4505-3118_7-31232898.html http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7587-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=100155&messageID=1150825 There are countless more.
Now I'd like to ask all of you what you &quot;really think&quot; of this &quot;controversial company&quot;...is it gold, or is it dross?
