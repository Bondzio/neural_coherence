1.1.1	Troughout the past week my computer kept freezing every once in a while when playing World of Warcraft.	St
1.1.2	I would have to restart my computer after the picture froze.	St
1.1.3	Just today I was playing when suddenly the computer just turned off.	St
1.1.4	I went to turn it on again and it will not power up.	St
1.1.5	No lights, no fans, nothing.	St
1.1.6	I figured maybe the power supply was dead, which would have explained the strange freezes I was getting throughout the week.	St
1.1.7	I switched power supplies with an older computer and found the same results.	St
1.1.8	The power supply that I thought was dead was working fine on the older computer, and my newer computer still had nothing.	St
1.1.9	I tried switching the graphics cards with the same results, the graphics card works fine on the other computer.	St
1.1.10	I don't think its the memory because the computer isnt even starting up.	St
1.1.11	Seems like its a power problem, yet the power supply appears to be working fine on other computers.	St
1.1.12	Could my motherboard have died out on me?	St
1.1.13	I'm using an ASUS P5B-E motherboard and have had it for 6 months before these problems started.	St
1.1.14	CPU is a Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz.	St
1.1.15	Anyone have any ideas on how I should go about troubleshooting this?	Ques
1.1.16	Any help would be great.	St
1.1.17	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	Have you checked to see if the CPU Fan is working, could be that the CPU over-heated and shut down, the same could also be true of the memory?	St
1.2.2	Chris	St
1.3.1	Don't discount the RAM.In spite of what you said, the same happened to my computer-just stopped working, would not power up etc.After trying everything, including numerous E-mails and help from HP,I eventually removed one of the Ram modules, and hey presto it worked!	St
1.3.2	!	St
