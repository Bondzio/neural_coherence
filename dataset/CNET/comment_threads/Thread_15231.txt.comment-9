I am wondering if, because the Radeon card has both analog and digital outputs, this might be a factor.
Also, does your monitor have both analog and digital inputs?
If the above are true, I would try some cable swapping and/or input selection from the monitor itself to see if you can get a screen from an alternate boot device.
