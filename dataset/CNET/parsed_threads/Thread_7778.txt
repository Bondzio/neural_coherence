<s> Rick, thanks for your reply, I just finished updating windows (I choose every optional installation) and after a second restart I got the pop up again. </s>
<s> Also downloaded the hp software from hp web page and installed an uninstalled the software Since the pop up appears even without the printer being connected, I believe the problem should be a piece of software that kind of &quot;identifies new hardware&quot; when there is none, as part of the process to install the printer when is part of the wireless network. </s>
<s> Been looking for starting up options and can not find it do have another suggestion? </s>
<s> thanks again for your kindly help, Leo </s>
<s> Device manager and see if you have any yellow exclamation marks. </s>
<s> Right click my computer, left click properties, left click hardware, left click device manager. </s>
<s> I used to get the installation problem when I installed my HP camera on my computer. </s>
<s> It had to do with installing Photo Gallery. </s>
