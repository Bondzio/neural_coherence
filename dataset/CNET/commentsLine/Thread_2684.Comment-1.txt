recently the dvd/cdrw drive on my dell laptop went down.
to save money, i bought an internal dvd burner(yamakawa dvr 7-08 8x dvd+/-rw (r888-1002 )) and a usb 2.0 enclosurer.
i thought it should plug and play, but after i put everything together, the laptop(xp) did not recognize it as a dvd writer.
the windows explorer did add a label to the dvd driver as &quot;dvd-r&quot;, but after i insert a blank dvd+r disk, the label changed to &quot;cd drive&quot;.
i then tried the software(ezburning) came with dell, the software complained that it can not find any dvd writer divice.
any help will be appreciated.
