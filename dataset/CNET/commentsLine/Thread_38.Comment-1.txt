i'd like opinions on the nvidia fx 5900 xt vid cards (specifically chaintech's, if possible.)
i'd like to upgrade from my ti4200; correct me if i'm wrong, but is the fx 5900 xt, just below the &quot;ultra&quot; series?
i'm a gamer, but not a super hardcore one.
i'd just like some better fps, and nicer detail in games like far cry, which i'm currently playing.
the fx 5900's need external power; i have a 450 watt psu, so i don't think powering the card is an issue (also have 2 hdd, 2 optical drives, and a fdd.)
specs for the card can be found here:  my local pc vendor is willing to sell me the card for $178; online prices range from $178-$215, so i'd be getting a good price.
would appreciate input as to how well this card runs from anyone who has it; good gaming card, 3d, fps?
heat issues?.
all input appreciated.
oh, running xp pro w/amd 2000+ chip, 512 ram @ 266 fsb, motherboard supports 8x.
tia!
