<s> Hi, In games such as Half life 2, Rome Total War etc I usually get slowdowns if I turn up the graphics beyond medium level (without anti aliasing - anti aliasing would murder my poor computer). </s>
<s> I was thinking of upgrading my computer to combat this. </s>
<s> I'm not looking for a full upgrade, I want to find out what the slowest part of my computer is. </s>
<s> Hardware: Radeon 9600 Pro - thinking of upgrading to 6600GT AGP 512mb DDR Ram Athlon XP 2600+. </s>
<s> What do you think is causing the slowdown, or do I need to do a full upgrade? </s>
<s> I was hoping for a fix to get me through until 64 bit cpus and Pci Express cards are cheaper. </s>
<s> the 9600pro is the main 'weak point'. </s>
<s> next, upgrade to 1gb to give the games more RAM. </s>
<s> the CPU is OK for the titles you've mentioned but by the end of this year, even entry level CPUs will surpass it. </s>
<s> less than $350 would get you a new PCI express mobo (nforce 4 chipset - $70), a better video card (nvidia geforce 7600gt - $170; or ati radeon x1800gto - $185), and a gig of RAM (2 512MB DDR-400 - $80). </s>
<s> this upgrade would last longer than just a geforce 6600gt agp ($145) or a radeon x1600pro agp ($120). </s>
<s> For a gamer, you're definitely light on RAM. </s>
<s> One gig would be your sweet spot. </s>
<s> (that's just double what you've got now.) </s>
<s> Next, you never did mention the biggest performance hog in your system.....the hard drive. </s>
<s> You can pile on RAM till your Mobo just won't take any more and Windows will still use the hard drive for many operations. </s>
<s> Like reading from the Kernal. </s>
<s> Geting the kernal off of the hard drive is the first step in eliminating that bottleneck. </s>
<s> That's nothing but a Registry Tweak and won't cost you a penny. </s>
<s> Then there's a few more tweaks that will increase performance for you. </s>
<s> Like shutting down all those totally redundant Services that run in the background all the time. </s>
<s> Cleaning up your HD and defragging it regularly will keep it running at peak performance. </s>
<s> Most of what you need to do everything I've mentioned here is listed on my website at: http://theshadow.members.atlantic.net Besides the ram, one huge thing you can do for your PC is add a SATA hard drive. </s>
<s> SATA is many times faster than IDE. </s>
<s> (by a factor of around 10x) If your mobo doesn't support a SATA drive, there are PCI add-on cards that will. </s>
<s> I've used them and they work great. </s>
<s> You can also run your old IDE drive off of a SATA controller card by using a IDE to SATA dongle on the back of your IDE drive and plug it into the SATA controller card, with a SATA data cable. </s>
<s> I've done this too, and my old IDE (60gig Maxtor) runs almost as fast as my 160gig Maxtor SATA drive. </s>
<s> It's all in the data transfer protocol. </s>
<s> SATA is just a lot faster than IDE. </s>
<s> Well, that should keep you busy for a while anyway. </s>
<s> lol Good Luck, The Doctor </s>
<s> Thanks for the help guys. </s>
<s> I know a place that's selling a 6600 gt for 180$ NZD (roughly 100 USD), and I mar be able to get hold of an Athlon 3000+ but I'm not counting on it. </s>
<s> 512MB ram isn't really expensive nowadays either. </s>
<s> How do you tell if your Hard Drive is IDE or SATA? </s>
<s> Check your mobo manual (or website) and see if it supports SATA. </s>
<s> You can also use a system info utility such as Everest: http://www.lavalys.com/products/overview.php?pid=3&lang=en or its predecessor, AIDA32: http://www.sofotex.com/AIDA32-download_L9326.html SATA drives are not 10x faster than IDE (ATA) drives. </s>
<s> Manufacturers fit the same drives with both ATA and SATA interfaces so their performance is very similar. </s>
<s> SATA-2's burst (interface) speed is much higher than ATA (300MB/sec vs. 133MB/sec) but the sustained transfer rate and seek times of ATA/SATA drives with the same platters will be less than 2% apart. </s>
<s> Take a look at these benchmarks which highlight Western Digital 320GB ATA and SATA drives: http://www23.tomshardware.com/storage.html?modelx=33&model1=137&model2=135&chart=34 Even WD Raptors (the fastest non-SCSI drives) don't exceed 90MB/sec so they 'fit' inside the ATA performance envelope. </s>
<s> Next year's drives with perpendicular recording may finally exceed ATA's 133MB/sec limit. </s>
