1.1.1	Hello , everyone .	St
1.1.2	I just bought a new monitor for my computer and I would also like to upgrade the graphics card .	St
1.1.3	I have a Dell Dimension 9150 with the stock GeForce 7300LE graphics card , I have 4 gigs of ram .	St
1.1.4	I 've gone from a dell 19 in monitor to a Dell ST2410 and would like to get your input on what card would be a good replacement for the GeForce .	St
1.1.5	As I'am sure you can see by this , this is not a gaming computer .	St
1.1.6	Thank You all in advance .	St
1.1.7	mightymike	St
1.2.1	how much do you want to spend on a new video card , and what are the main functions of the computer ( eg : what do you use the PC for ... editing videos , CAD , watching some movies , surfing the net , etc . )	St
1.3.1	Hi , Brechan .	St
1.3.2	Well , our needs are fairly low key , do alot of photo shop , no videos , alot of web surfing , no games , our grandson plays alot of games but he 's only 6 so the games he does play are not graphics hogs .	St
1.3.3	No , I would n't assume to get something that could never be put to good use but I seem to get so much conflicting information from the web .	St
1.3.4	If your power supply is lacking , do n't get this card .	St
1.3.5	If you 're looking at this card , you would be better off getting the new generation of this other card .	St
1.3.6	Stuff like that .	St
1.3.7	I do n't want overkill but certainly do n't want to come up short either .	St
1.3.8	Have looked at the GT250 , and the 5670 ( I may be off on these models .	St
1.3.9	I 'm going from memory not knowledge ) but just do n't know enough about this stuff to made a decision .	St
1.3.10	I 've tried to educate myself a little but it seems that there are so many variables that I just get more confused .	St
1.3.11	So , that is why I was hoping one or more of you Brainiacs that understand whats going on could help .	St
1.3.12	I would n't think that this change should cost more than 100 dollars but money is not the problem , getting too much card is .	St
1.3.13	Again , Thanks .	St
1.3.14	mightymike	St
1.4.1	http : //support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim9150/ has what I need to know .	St
1.4.2	1 .	St
1.4.3	PCIe x16 slot .	St
1.4.4	2 .	St
1.4.5	PSU Wattage 375 W I 'm going to share I used a Zotac GT240 1GB fanless card from amazon.com .	St
1.4.6	I mention this because I have it and put it on a Watt meter .	St
1.4.7	The entire HP d4999t with this card barely breaks 120 Watts during a video game .	St
1.4.8	It is under 100 Watts at most other times .	St
1.4.9	This means it wo n't push you into a power supply upgrade .	St
1.4.10	Here 's the link - & gt ; http : //www.amazon.com/ZOTAC-nVidia-GeForce-PCI-Express-ZT-20404-20L/dp/B002X7A6N4/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_0_0 It is under 92 bucks .	St
1.4.11	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the reply Bob .	St
1.5.2	I will look into this and try to educate myself with this info .	St
1.5.3	The power supply is , I would guess is just one of a few factors that would come into play with my request .	St
1.5.4	Thank You .	St
1.5.5	mightymike	St
1.6.1	Hi , everyone .	St
1.6.2	So , I 'll try this with a little bit more to get more response .	St
1.6.3	What if I upgraded to say a 550 or larger psu ?	Ques
1.6.4	I know that my computer is old and only running a Pentium D. Would it make sense to be able to go to a modern graphics card ?	Ques
1.6.5	Or is this just a waste of money in your opinion .	St
1.6.6	I like what Bob had to say about the GT240 but I 'm still a little concerned about power .	St
1.6.7	mightymike	St
1.7.1	And the next model card down .	St
1.7.2	Ran great .	Polite
1.7.3	While you could move to a better video card , I have used that model a few times and since I have a Watt Meter I 've done the tests to show we do n't have to replace the PSU .	Sug
