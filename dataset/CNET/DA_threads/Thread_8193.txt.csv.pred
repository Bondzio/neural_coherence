1.1.1	Is water cooling a good investment for the AMD ATHLON 64 cpu ?	Ques
1.1.2	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	if not , a zalman 90 should do the trick .	Sug
1.3.2	you can still oc pretty good with the zalman 90. wc is for pure oc'ers and people that want a really quiet pc .	St
1.3.3	konny	St
1.4.1	Water cooling is an over kill with a AMD64 they DO NOT RUN HOTeven with some over clocking ! ! !	St
1.4.2	!	St
1.5.1	i do n't do any overclocking on my cpu so there 's no need for water cooling .	St
1.5.2	water cooling may enable a higher overclock but the cpu might not last as long due to the overclocking stress .	St
1.5.3	plus i 'd worry if the water pump all of a sudden decided to fail , and my cpu in its overclocked state stopped receiving a steady stream of cool water	St
1.6.1	Yes , We install water cooled systems in our systems But we only use IT professionals and highest quaility hardware .	St
1.7.1	Having been there and done that , water cooling did help my CPU temps and did wonders for my GPU temps , but decent air cooling ( case with 120mm fans , Zalman or Thermalright heatsink , Zalman VF700-AlCu GPU heatsink , Seasonic S12 series power supply ) will get you quiet without the complexity and additional power consumption from a water pump that you 'll get with water cooling .	St
1.7.2	Well , OK , if you have a reasonably high-powered system and want quiet , air cooling might not cut it .	St
1.7.3	Water works well there .	St
1.7.4	Plan on spending about $ 300 in parts to do it right .	St
1.7.5	See http : //www.dangerden.com and some of the better water cooling forums like http : //forums.overclockers.com.au/forumdisplay.php ? f=24 if you 're serious .	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	I am cooling an AMD 2600 CPU and a NVidia GPU with water for at least 2 years .	St
1.9.2	The water cooling did cost $ 300 and required some case moding but it is absolutely silent .	St
1.9.3	It does require maintenance , adding coolant semiannually .	St
1.9.4	I can hear my CD , DVD , and HDD spinning .	St
1.9.5	The water cooled system is quieter than my laptop , Dell Latitude D600 .	St
1.9.6	Yes , the system has been OC 'd and it was amazing what I could do with it !	St
1.9.7	I 've got 2 AMD 64 systems ( 3000 + 3400 ) running with the retail package fans installed on the CPU and 120mm case fans .	St
1.9.8	Yes , they are hot but not as hot as those 32 bit AMD 2600 .	St
1.9.9	They are very quiet .	St
1.9.10	Save your money and spend it on other hardware .	St
1.10.1	Only if if it is on fire !	St
1.11.1	NIL	St
1.12.1	I have built many pcs and yes i have overclocked a few , though I am not generally in favour of overclocking , but I have never found water colling necessary .	St
1.12.2	I have seen a couple which are older models and overclocked to the max , which get a bit war !	St
1.12.3	but if you are running at standard spped it is absolutely unnesessary	St
1.13.1	The AMD 64 cpu 's were designed to run cooler .	St
1.13.2	And there stupid fast already so no need to overclock them .	St
1.13.3	Of all my buddies with super fast systems only two of them use the water cooled sulutions and they both run overclocked Intel P-4 's .	St
1.13.4	My AMD 64 FX is just as fast and I have no problems with cooling it .	St
1.13.5	Ca n't wait to get my new AMD Athlon 64 X2 processor .	St
