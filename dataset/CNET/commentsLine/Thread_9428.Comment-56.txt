i agree for the most part on what you just said but...i don't where you got your info on amd processors not being socket 939 compatable.
check out the link (and google amd if you want more proof)  not only are they s939 compatable but also even with their dual core processors.
when tring to decide which processor to use you also need to research motherboards to see which processers can be used with which mb and if the mb has a good reputation as well.
although, while going for the newest and biggest may seem like a good idea, it pays to check out any & all info that you can find before buying, so that you don't end up getting a mb & processor and then finding your other parts don't work with them.
reasearch, research, research is the key.
i am in the process of buying the parts to build another computer and have already looked at the so-called ''top of the line'' cpu's and mb's and now i am working my way down.
if i were building it for myself for gaming, maybe, but for someone who justs wants a good compter that will still be fairly fast & up to date in a couple of years, one doesn't need to get that fancy.
