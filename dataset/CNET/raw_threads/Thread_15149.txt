You might consider that basic drivers will be for the A8R series such as chipset, etc. Other features, sound, network, etc. should be available from that manufacturer. You might be able to piece it together that way but a manual isn't something ASUS makes for the retail market in these cases. Good luck.

Either way, the vendor should provide some support in your query if it isn't that old. I suggest you be 100% sure of the model# as well in order to get the right data. tada -----Willy
