I use my Toshiba netbook all the time showing Microsoft Powerpoint presentations.
AND some of those even have linked video files, which play fine.
When connecting to a projector, I have found that netbook running Windows 7 starter edition syncs with the project without a hitch.
I do these presentations on the road a lot, and being able to just carry the lighter weight netbook is great.
Also, the 7+ hours battery life means that I don't need to plug in the netbook's power cord.
Much nicer set up than even my 13&quot; laptop.
