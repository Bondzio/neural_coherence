Hi Dave, I've just read your email re: scratch on your Diamond Pro 900.
I've got a Mitsubishi Diamond Plus 91 with the same problem - an annoying little dent on the screen surface.
What's needed is something which dries in the dent to the same refractive index as the surrounding surface material.
Did you find anything which helped?
Thanks Michael k-s michael.kirk-smith@ntlworld.com
