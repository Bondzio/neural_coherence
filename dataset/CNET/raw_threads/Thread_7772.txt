I am running into an issue and the reason behind me not using it, whenever I try and print I am constantly being told that I do not have any paper in the tray. I can load it with 100 sheets of paper and this happens. I am looking for an all in one similar to the Dell printers where the paper is loaded from the top in. I am not sure how good Dell's printers are, I know their PC's are good. Any suggestions?

If the printer is over 2 years old then try the usual cleaning, read the product manuals for what they say about this (I don't duplicate that here) and then if the printer is 2 or more years old, start shopping. All consumer printers last about 2 to some years. Many can't accept that. Bob

I do prefer laser printers and &quot;Office&quot; printers from HP but consumers generally don't want to go past 99 bucks so those may not be on the list. Bob
