so i just finished building a core 2 duo pc for a friend, and now that everythings in and all, the power switch won't turn it on.
for some reason the power led is on, though faint.
i reconnected all the front panel stuff and made sure they were in the correct places but to no avail.
also, the mobo supports a 24-pin power, but i used a 20-pin.
it said it could use 20-pin too.
also, the 12v connector had 8 slots but i used a p4 cable instead.
these might be the problem, but i'm not sure.
[url= link[/url] [url= link[/url] any ideas?
