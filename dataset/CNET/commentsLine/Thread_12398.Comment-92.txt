well, i don't think anyone has a solid printer choice yet actually!
i would suggest though, that if you have already invested in a lot of new software and you only have 1 client, you might want to outsource your printing until you have more volume.
just a suggestion.
i am going to do a review once i have tested out the phaser 6360. i think the ricoh 811 is supposed to be the best one, but that is a very expensive printer.
i think we all agree that you definitely need color laser for the metallic stocks, and one with the straight pass through tray that can also handle a big range of sizes...(3x5 to letter).
and though many people are rooting for the solid ink printers, it definitely does not adhere to the metallic stocks which is a quality issue that i don't want to deal with.
hopefully we'll have some positive reviews on here soon!
good luck with your business.
