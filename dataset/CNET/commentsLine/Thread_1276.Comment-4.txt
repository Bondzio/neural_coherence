you can purchase wireless-g network adapters that are compatible with usb 2.0 and usb 1.1. the linksys wireless-g usb network adapters are compatible with usb 2.0 and 1.1 (go to linksys.com and look at the ''data sheet'' for the individual usb wireless-g network adapter).
it is my experience that usb wireless network adapters perform equal to or better than pcmcia network adapters.
theoretical max speeds: usb 1.1 = 12mbps usb 2.0 = 480mbps wireless-g = 54mbps typical home internet = less than 10mbps you can see that the drawback of using wireless-g on a usb 1.1 port is that it will limit your connection speed to the local network (12mbps &lt; 54mbps), but not your internet speeds (12mbps &gt; 10mbps).
i recommend purchasing a wireless network adapter that is the same brand as the router to ensure maximum compatibility and one-stop customer support.
if you desire to have usb 2.0 ports in your computer, you can purchase a pcmcia card with usb 2.0 ports.
presently, there are 12 such cards listed on newegg.com .
you can find them online and at at local computer stores, electronics stores, and office supply stores.
