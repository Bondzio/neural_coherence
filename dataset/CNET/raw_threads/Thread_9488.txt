I took out the stock heatsink which was doing the job at an icy 59-65C, 70C when burning a DVD and did my first heatsink installation. Was a little nerve wracking, but everything seems fine, although I don't think my therm. comp. application on the cpu die was as neat and even as it could be. Anyway, system, according to Speedfan, is running at 36-39C now. 1) Are there any warning signs I should look out for indicating a faulty setup? 2) How much more of a temp drop can I expect after the compound (artic silver) has &quot;burnt&quot; in? 3) It's been about 30 mins of running stabably with no temp increase, with the temp going back and forth between 35C and 39C, but should I still take precautionary measures for the next few days? Like setting my temp cutoff in the BIOS to something like 60C? Any advice is much appreciated.
