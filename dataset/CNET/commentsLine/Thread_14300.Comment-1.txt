we have two laptops in our office with the same symptoms.
both have internal wireless cards, one a b one a g. both will function at the respective employee's home.
when at the office both can connect to the local network, see other computers, access files from the server and use the shared printer but can not access the internet.
disabling the internal nic and using a different pcmcia wifi card will allow access to the network and internet.
as far as i can tell all the settings in the properties are the same.
i have tried one of the laptops at a couple of wifi hotspots in town with no problems.
tcp/ip is set for automatic although i have tried assigning addresses but have the same results.
any ideas?
thanks
