<s> I bought a LG dvdwriter on ebay. </s>
<s> I cannot get this thing to show up on my system at all. </s>
<s> My motherboard is all sata devices so I bought a ide to sata connection and nothing. </s>
<s> So I bought a pci card that has the ide connections on it. </s>
<s> Nothing again. </s>
<s> I thought it might be that I needed the drivers but I can't find them anywhere. </s>
<s> LG's website has nothign on it except for tech specs. </s>
<s> How was the drive jumpered ? </s>
<s> What does the resller say ??? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> it is set as a master since it is the only ide controlled item. </s>
<s> I'm using winxp 64bit ed. </s>
<s> the seller will not let me return it. </s>
<s> as far as drivers, i can't find any at all for this burner. </s>
<s> even on lg's website. </s>
<s> Not only must you find motherboard SATA drivers but booting from a SATA CD/DVD only adds more misery. </s>
<s> I'm surprised that anyone would do this. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> This issue is not what it appears to be. </s>
