man your system is a t-bone compared to my hot dog computer.
anyways, your motherboard is a 939 socket which is nice so you can upgrade the processer, and check out the ati x800 all in one its a nice card for overall computing, and just buy an external harddrive, i have seen nice 200-300gb ex hardrives for around $200 dollars.
