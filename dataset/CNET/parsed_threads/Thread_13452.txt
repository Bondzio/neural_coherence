<s> The pool water's 32-34 C ( &gt;90F), so the environment's both HOT and HUMID. </s>
<s> Plus there's the hint of chlorine and/or salt in the air. </s>
<s> Regular PCs don't last long in this environment. </s>
<s> Many have leased premises, so Air Conditioning not an option (besides hot/cold health issues). </s>
<s> Ambient air in summer in mid to high 30s for many (Australia). </s>
<s> Can you advise us on hardware & peripherals that might be effective as well as affordable? </s>
<s> water cooling is a potential idea, assuming you have very large radiators you could use evaporative cooling, except that it won't benefit or work very well in a humid environment OR if they have deep pockets, phase change would handle that fine because it's basically air conditioning to cool the CPU, but your tlaking around $1200 a unit other ideas would be large cases with lots of fans and good heat sinks, and fan filters but your basically describing a computer's worst nightmare </s>
<s> Sometimes, its harder to move the user's thinking and/or habits for best results. </s>
<s> This is an good example, if the user can access some other area or a more controlled enviroment the problem will persist. </s>
<s> The only solution I can think of and it must be a controlled one, is a heated table or surface. </s>
<s> This will dehumind the immediate area and any intake huminity actually helps cool the system/laptop. </s>
<s> When I say heated only slightly like a warmed sunlit exposed table, maybe 10-15deg. </s>
<s> above. </s>
<s> The system/laptop should still have its own acceptable cooling working 100% with any help like bigger fans, etc.. tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Either some serious cooling hardware or some pricey gear designed to handle extremes. </s>
<s> I've stumbled apon a few things: Itronix GoBook VR-1 Laptop &quot; ..is waterproof, vaporproof, and shockproof. </s>
<s> Each PC is put through numerous, strenuous tests, including being dropped 54 times from one meter, baked in an oven, vibrated, chilled, and drenched. </s>
<s> &quot;- Geek.com The VR-1 will be available in November at a base price of $3,329. </s>
<s> The cheaper Hummer versions will be starting at $2,988. </s>
<s> http://www.hummerlaptops.com/ Those both may be overkill for your conditions. </s>
<s> Panasonic has their Toughbooks. </s>
<s> http://www.panasonic.com/business/toughbook/products.asp Which may be a better (cheaper) option. </s>
<s> They are built to meet the same MIL-STD-810F standards as the Itronix systems. </s>
<s> &quot; The Humidity test was performed in accordance with MIL-STD-810F, Method 507.4 (Aggravated). </s>
<s> The test items were tested for operation near the conclusion of the fifth and tenth cycles. </s>
<s> Each cycle was one day (24 hours) and the entire test was performed over ten days.The temperature was cycled between 86 and 140F with the relative humidity at 95% constant. </s>
<s> -From Panasonic.com Prices are laptop reasonable A quick Froogle I'd say go with a toughbook. </s>
<s> Might not be possible, but keep it in a room with a dehumidifier. </s>
<s> Much cheaper than buying extreme enviroment computers. </s>
<s> forgot about those.... those or the extreme environment PC's </s>
