the internal wifi card is in a word &quot;weak.&quot; it fails but i find the owners to not accept this answer.
you must give them time to reload the os a few dozen times and wait for them to search for drivers.
in about 1 to 6 months they finally cave and you can remove the internal wifi card and slip in some wifi pc-card to take over.
