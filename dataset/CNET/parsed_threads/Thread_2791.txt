<s> Have a look at Dell's site for the latest XP software. </s>
<s> you can run a system file checker, even though you have an upgrade disk, it still has all the software required. </s>
<s> Start-&gt;Run sfc /scannow Press Enter Put your XP CD in if it asks. </s>

<s> You can check that by putting a card that is not your wireless adapter in the slot and seeing if anyhting happens. </s>
<s> If not then that is most likely the case and the above solution would be your best choice and the drivers are also located on your computer in a folder named DELL. </s>
