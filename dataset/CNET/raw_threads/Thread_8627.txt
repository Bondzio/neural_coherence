The Drive mounts perfectly when attached to a machine running XP or ME. The case (Travelstar) uses a Genesys GL811E Chipset. When attached to the USB port, the system correctly recognises the presence of the drive. However, when loading the final driver files the system crashes and locks up. I have tried both the driver on the CD supplied with case and a driver I found at ''Driverguide'' listed for the GL811 chipset. The driver files look pretty similar and neither one will load properly. I have tried this on two separate machines running Win98SE. The outcome is the same on both systems - no success. Behavior is the same whether using the onboard USB 1.1 ports or a PCI USB 2.0 port. Can anyone provide any suggestions on how to get this working? Thanks, JIm

I offer no do-this cure but the site I used to figure it out. The crash or lockup is typical when an owner has not installed latest chipset driver packages. Cheers, Bob
