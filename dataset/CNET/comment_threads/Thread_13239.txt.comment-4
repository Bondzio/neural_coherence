http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim3100/en/sm/specs0.htm Personally, I'm not much for 'all-in-ones' ....no matter who makes them.
Much prefer to have more latitude over the case and all the system components...the CPU, RAM, video card, hard disk speed as well as how many HDDs or CD-DVD burners and future upgradability.
Re monitors .... lots of choices available there too...IPS backlit screens with or without the matte finish and varying degrees of tilt, swivel or pivot are the choices I want at my discretion.
And as your children grow older, playing games may become more important and neither machine would be suitable for that.
Let us know how it turns out.
