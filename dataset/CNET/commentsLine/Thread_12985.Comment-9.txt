so far, the solid state memory seems a little slow.
i always thought game cartridges were a good idea and that's what a &quot;thumb drive&quot; amounts to - only a lot more compact.
with variations on dslinux (a complete os w/office and games in under 50mb) available to run from a thumb/pen drive we can now take &quot;our&quot; pc anywhere; school, library or work.
the high schoolers are doing it now and the memory is a geek's &quot;status symbol&quot;; hanging around their neck or in their pocket.
as an &quot;elder geek&quot; (i've got &quot;perspective&quot;!)
i often wonder why sony/phillips decided to spin the cd, rather than scanning the laser.
tv's have used electron scanning technology for quite a few years, but we still use digital &quot;phonographs&quot; (optical or magnetic disks) for our mass storage.
(hmmm - i shoulda patented that; now it's an open source idea.)
