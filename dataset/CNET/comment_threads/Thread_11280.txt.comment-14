Get this.
For some reason now I can not burn CD's, but can burn DVD's fine on the same drives.
I was using Nero 6.6.
Upgraded to 7.0, still doesn't work.
I verified drivers and that DMA is turned on.
The Nero people told me the Intel IAA is causing the problem, but it's only installed for the SATA drives.
Any ideas?
