<s> well i have taken the leap into the wonderfull world of overclocking just to try it out. </s>
<s> heres what i got amd64 venice 3000+ @ 2.20ghz (9x244) system is running rock solid and i am very happy with the performance boost. </s>
<s> now, my idle temp is at about 33c-36c and my load temps are around 39c-47c (cpu-burn for 20mins @ 47c) i did not mess with any voltage settings and actually set my ram to 166 instead of its stock 200 (geil value ram 2gb pc3200 in duel channel mode) but with the overclock its right back up to 199. pci and agp bus is locked at stock speeds. </s>
<s> my question is, is this an acceptable overclock or is there something i have missed or could have done better, remember folks this is my first overclock so be gentle in your replys....i'm sensitive.....( | ) thanks in advance for your suggestions!!! </s>

<s> Why 9 x 244 and not 13 x 166? </s>
<s> OC'ing is OK until something happens. </s>
<s> Common OC'ing only provides a slight edge oevr stock. </s>
<s> If you continue OC you will shorten the &quot;life cycle&quot; of componets any/or all of them. </s>
<s> Further, its even more important that system be cooled at best as possible as if and when cooling decreasing, the likelyhood of quick failure is that much more present, in other words for an AMD cpu, unlike an Intel cpu, won't trottle down, though it should shutdown or try a reboot. </s>
<s> This is done in order to save the cpu. </s>
<s> It becomes more apparent when messing with cpu voltage in order to keep stable but the side effect is greater heat output as well. </s>
<s> I suggest you find the safe and stable level allowed and be happy when reached. </s>
<s> Continue wanting more will prove the above statements, enjoy once you find that maintainable level. </s>
<s> Visit OC websites and see what they do, like http://www.overclockers.com or google similar. </s>
