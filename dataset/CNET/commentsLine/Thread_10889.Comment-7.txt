i went into microcenter here in cambridge, ma and they custom built a beautiful powerful and quiet computer for $870.
i am very happy with my computer with runs vista ulitmate very well.
after further research the lenovo wasn't worth the discount and velocity was overkill.
thank you for all of your input.
and thank you joonil park who really customized my computer to my needs.
it was nice to have an intelligent human touch.
