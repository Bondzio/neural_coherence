1.3.1	Just a few of my own preferences when building a new ( 1st ) computer ; while Samsung is good , Western Digital is better ( and is in the same price range of Samsung ) http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16822136533 .	St
1.3.2	For cooling this monster , since you say you plan on over-clocking ; you may as well try out one ( of many ) 'All-In-One ' liquid coolers that are on the market now http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16835181010 or http : //www.coolitsystems.com/index.php/en/vantage.html If people say that adding liquid coolers ( such as the ones that are linked ) will void your warranty ; as stated by the vendor I bought mine from ' The warranty is only voided , if the cooler leaks and craps out your motherboard/ CPU , it does not void the warranty for using this cooler ' .	St
1.3.3	Besides , over-clocking the motherboard ( and frying all the components ) , will most likely void your warranty first	St
