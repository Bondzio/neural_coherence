i have windows xp which is new and clean and my pc has usb 1.1 standard.
i have discovered that when i plug in flash which is under fat file system, on my monitor autopplay dialog shows and then i can choose action.
when i plug in this usb, with 4 gb memory, which is under fat32 system, this dialog does not appear, so i must go to my computer and then i can go to usb.when i put one usb flash, which belongs to my friend, which is under ntfs, the dialog box automatically appears?
what is the problem?
is the file system in some connection with running flash?
can i use flash under ntsf?
