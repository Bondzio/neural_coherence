<s> When using my laptops in the other end of the building from the present router, the wireless is disconnected, and signal is zero, because of many walls in between. </s>
<s> Rather than spending on wireless extenders, or repeaters, or antennas, I thought of plugging in a second dsl modem into the phone outlet in that other end of the building. </s>
<s> This means I would need to buy a second router for that second setup. </s>
<s> So, is there such a thing as a combo modem/wireless router available, that I can just plug a cable into the phone outlet (like a conventional dsl modem), and then 4 wired connections to computers from the same combo unit, plus getting the wireless capability? </s>
<s> Sorry for this wordy description. </s>
<s> If any info, would appreciate links to some vendors or models. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> My home can accomodate 2 DSL modems and my DSL supplier has that device you ask for. </s>
<s> BUT the charge would be another 39 bucks a month to turn on the second DSL line. </s>
<s> Seems rather steep, but it can be an option for those willing to pay. </s>

<s> You can find a multitude of adsl2 modem/wireless router combos everywhere at very reasonable pricing - or even used/ good working condition on eBay for less than $20. </s>
<s> You are correct in that they can plug directly into your phone jack - dsl filters are only for phones/ faxes where you do not want a dsl on the line, otherwise as stated - no filter in the jack & you have a instant access to dsl which the modem is plugged into. </s>
<s> Word of advice, stay away from 2Wire modems if you can - especially if you're looking to get some range out of the device . </s>

<s> I have heard that Linksys cause some a bit of a headache also when initially setting them up - but there are very good, reasonably priced modem/router combos by D-Link (my favorite, mainly b/c I'm used to the interface), Belkin & am currently looking into a few new ones myself by Zoom (X6 model, for example), etc. </s>
<s> One other thing to make sure of is the compatibility - 802.11b/g should be fine for all computers/ laptops/ netbooks these days & 802.11n has even faster speeds/ range without much interference (i.e. </s>
