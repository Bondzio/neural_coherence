i am trying to recover photos from a damaged maxtor 80 gb hard drive.
i tried slaving it on my other computer, but my system would not start (tried all different variations of jumper settings).
i then placed it in a hard drive enclosure and it is visible under disk drives, but not listed in my computer.
when i go to disk management, it appears as an unknown device and i am prompted to initialize the disk.
will initialization delete the data on the drive?
