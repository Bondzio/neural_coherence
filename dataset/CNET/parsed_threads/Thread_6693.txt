<s> I've been looking up solutions for networked storage. </s>
<s> I want it mainly for my computer, so I just want to mainly put movies on it. </s>
<s> I might do music, but I mainly need all the videos off my desktop. </s>
<s> I've looked at the Western Digital drives, but their network ones have a very low score. </s>
<s> I was just wondering what my best bet would be for this, and I'm looking to spend under $200 for 250+GB, even if I need to use my own hard drive. </s>
<s> Any positive help is useful. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I too faced this issue and discovered that the Seagate Barracuda drives offer a 5 year warranty (parts/labor) whereas all others only offered 3 years max. </s>
<s> This becomes a great indictor of dependability for the drives. </s>
<s> At less than $100.00 for a 500GB drive, add another $30.00 for a USB external case and your problem is solved. </s>
<s> I've got a 320GB WD drive that's about a year old, almost hasn't been used. </s>
<s> And I have an external USB/1394 case somewhere, but I was having issues with it due to not wanting to clear the drive. </s>
<s> Also wanting the networking capability to share family photos over the LAN. </s>
