<s> So last month I had brought a new Seagate hard disk, prepared it and transferred all the data from my old Samsung hard disk (about 4 years old) to it. </s>
<s> The reason for buying a new disk was, while working on my PC (old hard disk) sometimes I would hear a faint ticking noise and the the system used to freeze and then restart after a long time. </s>
<s> Once restarted no hard disk used to be detected and I also used to get disk boot failure error on the second screen after restart. </s>
<s> But after power off and on, the system used to start working again. </s>
<s> This problem troubled me for almost more than a year. </s>
<s> Most people I talked to advised me that the hard disk was going bad and so finally I brought a new disk. </s>
<s> Right now after transferring the all the data to the new drive I ran a hard disk diagnostic tool called &quot;HUTIL&quot; from the Samsung website on my old Samsung SP0802N disk. </s>
<s> After completing the complete diagnostic test I got about 8 errors and the tool advised to run &quot;ERASE HDD&quot;. </s>
<s> I then ran the &quot;Low Level Format&quot; option in the tool. </s>
<s> It gave me some error in the end but I think the process got completed. </s>
<s> Here is a screenshot of current disk management in windows. </s>

<s> Pass! </s>
<s> Check S.M.A.R.T : Testing... Error: S.M.A.R.T Threshold Exceeded. </s>

<s> --- Thats two less read surface scan errors than last time I think. </s>
<s> The disk is no longer under warranty so no point contacting any service centers. </s>
<s> Now although my old disk is not very healthy, it is still usable and I was thinking of using it as a single partition storage drive. </s>
<s> Is there anything more I could do to the disk to remove those errors and make it more healthy. </s>
<s> Or should I just prepare/NTFS-format the drive and start using it. </s>
<s> This is a drive with issues. </s>
<s> I can't count how many try to keep using such and call it proof that they can keep using it. </s>
<s> It's like a bald tire. </s>
<s> It works but is out of spec and you never know when... </s>
<s> So can nothing be done about these errors.. Read DMA : Testing... Error: Sector error Check S.M.A.R.T : Testing... Error: S.M.A.R.T Threshold Exceeded. </s>
<s> Read Surface Scan : Testing... C:1039 H:0 S:962 Error: Ecc error C:1040 H:0 S:797 Error: Ecc error C:1580 H:0 S:1037 Error: Ecc error C:7354 H:0 S: 965 Error: Ecc error In the &quot;Hutil&quot; HDD diagnostic tool apart from &quot;Low Level Format&quot; option there was an &quot;Erase MBR&quot; option too which I haven't run till now since I don't know what it means. </s>
<s> Do you thin running it might help. </s>
<s> Or anything else.. </s>
<s> But just like rebuilding a bald tire it takes specialized gear, a new platter or head assembly. </s>
<s> At today's costs a drive is cheaper to replace than fix. </s>
