i use a q-tip taped to a popsicle stick.
dip the q-tip in isopropal alcohol and insert the q-tip between the read heads and gently scrub in a back and forth motion.
while you are in a cleaning mode, spray a shot of wd-40 on the two micro switches on the lower right and left of the insert slot.
this degunks the plastic fingers of the micro switches that tells your machine what type of media 720/1.44 (right switch looking in), and if it is write protected (left switch).
