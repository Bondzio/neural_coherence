my computer turns on but the monitor will not turn on.
the keyboard flashes randomly and the harddrive does not turn on.
but if i unplug it from the mb it will turn on with just power from the power supply.
the green light is lite on the mother board and the fans are working.
i im thinking its the motherboard or its a virus.
i tried taking out the video card and puting it directly to the mb, still didnt work.
my computer is a 1.8 p4 cpu with a intel desktop board, 512 ddr, and 256 gforge video card, and 160 gig harddrive
