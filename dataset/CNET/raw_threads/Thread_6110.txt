I work in a law office, and we recently moved from paper files to electronic files. Now we scan all of our clients documents onto an external hard drive. The problem is that nobody but me can transfer those docs from the hard drive into the appropriate clients folder. When anyone does, the following message pops up...&quot; &quot;Cannot copy file: Acces is denied. Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.&quot; Is there any way to grant acces to other comps other than mine? Can anyone help me out with this?
