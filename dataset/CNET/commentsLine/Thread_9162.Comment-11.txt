i've always thought ram was the key to performance.
how do i find out more about my particular graphics card, and is it easy to upgrade?
i have an hp pavilion a305w desktop running win xp w/sp2.
i have a xeon celeron processor, 2.7mhz.
i have moderate computer skills, enough to install a second hard drive, but that's all i've done to it hardware-wise.
i have 256mb ram, and would like to upgrade to 512mb.
is there a website i can go to that gives specific (very specific) instructions on how to do that?
i stupidly bought a 512mb thingy that just plugs in, but when i opened the case i realized that that is the wrong kind for my pc.
i didn't know there were different kinds.
my pc uses one of those green cards for the ram.
how do you add to that?
a whole new card?
i also use a program called fast defrag 2.0. it indicates that my total physical memory is 247mb, and i have 37mb of free physical memory.
plus, it also tells me i have 606mb of virtual memory, and 174mb free virtual memory.
that doesn't sound good to me!
what's the difference between physical and virtual memory?
any advice and suggestions appreciated!
