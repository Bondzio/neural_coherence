Plainly put RDRAM was always expensive from the start.
It didn't catch on as vendors hoped and it lost favor.
Now, any RDRAM being produced is in such low production it is further expensive due to limited supplies.
On top of all that, you have to buy in pairs in order to maintain the &quot;continuity&quot; of the ram buss.
All in all darn hard to like RDRAM other than being slightly faster than older other ram types and so has been eclipsed.
Get what you can afford but for the long haul, it maybe best to find another system for the amount of cost put into a RDRAM based system can be instead placed into a newer system.
