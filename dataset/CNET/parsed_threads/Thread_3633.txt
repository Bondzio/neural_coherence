<s> I have 2 dell pcs and 1 sony laptop. </s>
<s> They are all 3-5 years old but fully updated to xp pro. </s>
<s> I juse a linksys 802 b g router. </s>
<s> The laptop uses a linksys card and the pcs connect via ethernet. </s>
<s> I have no problem with any of them except when I am online, every 10 minutes or so I get the Work Offline? </s>
<s> or Try Again? </s>
<s> error message. </s>
<s> Often I get the page not found message when refreshing. </s>
<s> Sometimes I can't connect to the internet at all. </s>
<s> When I hook the cable modem directly to the computer w/o the router, there is no problem. </s>
<s> To fix the problem I go into my network places/network connectons and right click on the network connection icon and click repair. </s>
<s> This fixes the problem every time. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea what the problem is and how I can fix it? </s>
<s> A solution is much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I had exactly the same problem, and my ISP identified it as being a problem with Linksys. </s>
<s> I upgraded firmware, but the problem persisted. </s>
<s> The Linksys router seems to lose your settings, although the settings appear to be there. </s>
<s> So all you need to do is open the linksys settings page, and click on save settings. </s>
<s> Another related problem is if you have more than one network named on the router (eg: 'home' and 'linksys')- I deleted my 'home' network, and run on the default 'linksys' network now, and since then, the problem has not returned. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Also, I think I only have one network name but how do I know? </s>
<s> I can't find anything on my PC that says Linksys. </s>
<s> Nothing in start menu, program files, search...nothing! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Open your network connections, click on properties, then check your preferreed Network list. </s>
<s> I appreciate it but can't figure it out. </s>
<s> I can't find anything on my computer that says Linksys. </s>
