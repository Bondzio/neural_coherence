I know this card is awsome but there is so many programs and it didn't come with any booklet (except one that explained how 2 install it.) My sound card is the &quot;Creative - Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer Sound Card&quot; Here's a link to it http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8014935&type=product&id=1156203598230 (thats just best buy I know but i have no where else to turn... there is very little documentation on how to utilize this audio beast to it's fullest.... I would really appreciate being pointed in the direction of a lengthy guide explaining all it's features if that is not too much to ask. Anyways thanks for taking the time to read.
