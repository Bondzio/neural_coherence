<s> Hi Cnet, Presently I am using a wired router for internet surfing etc. </s>
<s> I am using 2 pc's and both have wireless connection capability. </s>
<s> I can see that there are wireless connections in my area and they are secured connections. </s>
<s> If possible is there a way to connect wirelessly to one of these? </s>
<s> You'll ask the owner of the wireless systems for the password. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Since you appear to already be paying for internet service, the obvious, easiest, and most reliable way would be to buy your own wireless router or add a WAP to your existing system. </s>
<s> Are you wanting to drop your ISP and tap into someone else service? </s>
<s> If so, that may be illegal but is also very unreliable. </s>
<s> I know that some communities have installed wifi that's available to subscribers at a cost that may be more attractive than some ISPs offer. </s>
<s> You could check into that possibility if you wish. </s>
<s> I don't know much about how these work but suspect they may offer less than air tight security. </s>
