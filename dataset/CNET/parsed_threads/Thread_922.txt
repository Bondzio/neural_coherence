<s> I need to know which gadget will be more useful for college, since I'm starting in two months. </s>
<s> I'm choosing between the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and the Acer Aspire v5-413. </s>
<s> Based on productivity and convenience, which should I get? </s>
<s> If it helps, the course I'm taking is BS Accountancy. </s>
<s> Also, I currently own a 3-year old Acer Aspire One d250, although it's not in top condition anymore. </s>
<s> It looks a bit beaten up but still works okay. </s>
<s> What does the college recommend or require? </s>
<s> I can imagine they rely heavily on Excel (for financial calculations), Powerpoint (for presentations) and financial software that only runs on Windows. </s>
