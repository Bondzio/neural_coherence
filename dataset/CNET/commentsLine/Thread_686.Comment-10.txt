nwcdex was the mscdex equivalent from dr-dos.
but now i read it is part of partition magic.
but it had to do with mounting and reading a cd in dos.
so please tell more.
what program do you mean?
what do you want to do with it?
and a link to releevant info (like a manual, if possible) on the internet, please
