ieee, bob recommended a good start.
no manufacturer will want to talk to you unless you have up-to-date bios.
however, since this failure occurred on two seperate new drives, i suspect you have a motherboard failure.
the motherboard should also have more than one sata port on it.
try moving the cables to a different port (plugs on the board itself) and try that.
hopefully you only have a partail failure of your motherboard's sata controllers.
let us know ok?
