hi!
i used b myself for a project last year.
i did not find that g would give me any other significant benefits.
however i would suggest that before you buy any equipment you check the range they provide for.
especially if you use an access point.
make sure you check that the signal strength supported by the cards and the access point covers the distance that you intend to use it over.
also keep in mind that the g version is going to become more and more popular from now on, whereas b may soon be fogotten (i personally don't think that will happen too soon).
if you want to go into the technical details of the issue, g uses a wider frequency band but the same modulation technique as b. g actually reaches the same speeds as version a but there is also version e that's under construction.
hope this helps!
