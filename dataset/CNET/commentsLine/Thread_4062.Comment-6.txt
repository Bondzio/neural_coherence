plastic gives anyone a shot at getting it done.
metal (any type) comes with &quot;extra skill required&quot; but foil gives me a bad feeling as it could fall into the machine.
yes i've headed to the shop to make a new custom bracket when needed.
it's just sheet metal so tin snips and a drill press then some creative bending was all that was ever needed.
plastic could be the easy and safe fix.
