532	0	108365	1234721	NR	Big Steve	6/10/05 2:45 AM	1.1183715E12	Need a budget desktop PC.	Well my HP Deskjet 895 Cse inkjet printer finally died on me yesterday. This August 2005 I would have had the printer for 5 years and it's been a good one. If it was still available or any other good HP inkjet printer which operated on WIN 95 I'd probably go out and buy one tomorrow but no one makes printers now that run on WIN 95. So here's my problem. I've had my sights set on purchasing a new desktop PC from Velocity Micro; their model Vector SX-V but at the moment I can't swing the deal financially so if I went out later today and purchased a new printer of some type which runs on WIN XP I would also need to buy a new desktop PC which will also run on WIN XP since my old PC which will be the next thing to go also runs on WIN 95. I need to purchase a low end budget PC to get me by for a few months; something I can pay cash for and use for a few months until I can purchase the desktop PC which I really want to buy but can't afford right now. I've been told by others to stay away from any new PC which also has a Celeron processor. That would leave me with what? A P4 or an Athlon processor to choose from? Which would be better in a basic no frills desktop PC? I don't need a monitor since I purchased a new KDS 17&quot; flatscreen CRT less than 2 months ago; I just need a new computer and an inkjet printer. Any recommendations from anyone on a good; basic; no frills desktop PC I could go out and buy later today or within the next few days? Something easy to set up and use for a few months and hopefully I won't have to deal with the PC maker's tech support while I own it. Don't bother recommending Dell or HP; I've read both have terrible tech support. To those of you who might ask; no I don't know how to build a new desktop PC from scratch. Any feedback from anyone concerning this subject would certainly be appreciated. Big Steve End Of Message 06/10/05

It's not that hard... ^_^ Celeron is the best choice for tight budget. It is a solid, dependable CPU that's stable, heat tolerant, and if anything, more reliable than Pentiums and AMD processors. The reason most people look down upon Celeron is because it's &quot;poor man's cpu.&quot; The fastest Pentium4 and AMD processors are faster than the fastest Celeron, but cost far more. If you compare a Celeron and Pentium or AMD that cost the same, the Celeron is always faster and more dependable. In any case, the speed difference is only on paper, in the real world, I know it's not true. You can save perhaps $100 or more between the cheaper Celeron cpu and motherboard, as compared to a Pentium or AMD running at the same performance. Anyone who would shun Celeron for a economy PC does not know what he's talking about... Don't get an extra sound card. The onboard processor do just fine. There is no difference in sound quality, at least not any you can tell with human ears. Onboard graphics is fine for surfing. Watching videos should be fine too. If you play any games at all, you may want to get a lower end AGP adapter. A 128MB Radeon 9200SE goes at around $30 these days.

Besides, 512 MB ram is a bit low.
532	7	108365	1236102	1235845	jrmar07	6/10/05 2:12 PM	1.11841272E12	Well you asked for a cheap pc...	Yes, they both have integrated graphics with 64MB shared memory, which is typical equipment for a basic computer. The popular 512MB is not normally found in basic pcs ($500 and under), usually its 256MB like the computer from Bestbuy you linked for $419.00. That computer also has the same integrated graphics and hardrive, but the one I showed you has a faster processor, larger RAM, and a double-layer DVD-RW. All for marginally less money, $79 bucks to be exact. That is a good deal. Find a better OEM computer for less, then I'll agree with you.

Since January we (many of us) have offered our multiple dozens of suggestions for replacement of your 6 year old Win95 computer: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=59692&messageID=708745&tag= and http://cma.zdnet.com/texis/forums/search.html?q=&qt=&p=Big+Steve&a=&b=&fi=&f=1&o=d&m= The suggestions have ranged from the very lowest priced to mid range, and I believe you even mention at one time of going over $1100 which would have paid for that MicroVelocity PC you are not craving. Quite a few times we have mentioned to you the feasibility of the emachine T6212 with a 17&quot; CRT Monitor and printer for $550, or even a emachine for less than $350 with monitor/printer. I believe we have also gone through with you pretty well on Dell, HP, Compaq, emachine, Sony, and MicroVelocity in the past 4-5 months. You continually claim no gaming at all by you so in effect any modern inexpensive computer will work for your requirements. And really, considering the volume of units sold by Dell and HP they have no more problems than any other OEM builders % wise. Even a Yugo and Toyota have some problems (my Maytag dryer broke a belt not long ago & was able to fix myself). . Regards & good luck...

You can get complete systems for $400 if you do your homework. You won't get more than 256 RAM and a basic PC, but you get what you pay for anymore.

532	12	108365	1238866	1236194	jcd	6/12/05 7:05 AM	1.1185599E12	Agreed Steve	With all your posts asking for suggestions and with a multitude of advice, opinions and recomendations you are still non commital. Technology is everchanging. My advice is to write a list of your current needs, future desires and start &quot;googling&quot; for research, products and prices and be done with it so you can start focusing on computing.

Either will work good for you or anyone else, unless someone is a high end gamer with a fat wallet, then they would probably select the AMD Athlon 64 FX55. For regular computing and excellent gaming the Pentium 4 performs very well and who really cares (besides die hard gamers & braggards) if a few fps (frames per second) can be gained with the Athlon 64.
532	14	108365	1239430	1237240	dagger906	6/12/05 1:58 PM	1.11858468E12	RE	Budget PC = Celeron. All other choices are the wrong choices. A 2.8Ghz Celeron is both faster and cheaper than... say, a 2.6Ghz P4. If you build it yourself, you can get a PC capable to easily handle all the most current games at below $600. My computer, running on a 2.6Ghz Celeron, was build a year ago for around $600. That is, including a $250 17&quot; LCD monitor. HL2 runs at a comfortable 30-40 fps. This kind of PC is what you want. These other people only know how to spend money. They don't know what they're talking about... -_-
