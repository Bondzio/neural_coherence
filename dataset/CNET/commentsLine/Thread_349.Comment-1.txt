i have what i think is a tough question to answer.
is it possible to wirelessly link two networks together?
here is the situation: network 1 - 2 desktops & laptop(with wireless) hooked up to a belkin wirelss g router/gateway which is hooked up to comcast internet.
network 2 - 2 desktops hooked up to a netgear wireless g router/gateway.
i would like the two networks to be able to share internet, files, and be able to play games.
the distance between the two networks is at max 50 feet.
but there is absolutely no way to wire the networks together as they are across a hallway.
if this can not be done, some suggestions on how to make the situation better would be greatly appreciated.
also i don't really want to buy wireless cards for the two desktops on network 2. thank you for your help.
