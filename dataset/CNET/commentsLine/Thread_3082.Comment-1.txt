graphics card:  [...] p?gpid=280 i want to find out if i can connect the computer to an (old) tv via the graphics card's dvi i port.
does the the dvi port support: a) component b) dvi-i rgb?
if yes to a) and/or b): the tv is old, 10 years or more.
it has 2 scart ports.
how do i determine whether the scart ports support a) component b) dvi-i rgb?
thanks.
