I would like to share files but with password protection between them. Setting up new users on the computers is undesireable. All computers are on a switch and in the same workgroup. Simple file sharing works fine but I want to put passwords on the folders or allow only specific computers. Simple file share is turned off on computer A and I get a password prompt when I try to access it from computer B, which is what I want. But where do I set up the password in computer A. On a somewhat unrelated note, when I try to &quot;MANAGE MY NETWORK PASSWORDS&quot; in the &quot;USER ACCOUNTS&quot; window, the password never stays the same. I set it up and then try to change the password but I can't, it always says the original password is wrong, even if I use something simple like &quot;password&quot; of just &quot;1&quot;. Any help or links would be appreciated.

I have to decline duplicating books and web content. My point is those that don't want to use what Windows provides will have to create a new paradigm. That's not a bad thing but I wonder why you would do that. Bob

Obviously, I have not found any of the &quot;widely documented&quot; web content. My question is very simple, how do I set up a password protected shared folder in win xp. Win 98 was very simple but I can't figure out xp. I have spent a week surfing the web and finding several decent sites, however, information for setting the password is either nonexistent or requires the complicated creation of another user (2 users on the same computer) for file sharing and access. I have been simple sharing for a while but my new situation has me somewhat vulnerable to easy access by strangers. I can not change this, therefore, I would like to set passwords on the folders I share. Thank you

The shares are made and you adjust the permissions to allow or deny the users you list. It IS widely documented but many will write it's not because at first it seems intimidating. It's simple. Accounts, create shares, adjust permissions. Any other way and you've created something new and your own creation? Bob
