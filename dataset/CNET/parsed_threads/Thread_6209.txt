<s> I replaced the power supply in my computer. </s>
<s> Everything seemed good but, when I plug a thumb drive into either usb port on the front, they don't work and , worse, they disable the mouse and keyboard so I have to do a hard shutdown. </s>
<s> Rebooting re-enables the mouse and keyboard until I try the front ports again. </s>
<s> What have I done wrong? </s>
<s> I found this video and it fixed the problem immediately. </s>
<s> Quick, easy fix! </s>

<s> If everything worked before then properly replacing the PSU shouldn't have caused a problem. </s>
<s> What I suspect is that either your mis-routed the USB harness or it became unseated/misaligned. </s>
<s> Inspect and verify your past work and don't take anything for granted. </s>

<s> That's a physical damage item, though not seen, it's damaged. </s>
<s> If you want to return USB access, install PCI card of USB with an int. </s>
<s> mounting for USB access for the frt.. </s>

<s> USB ports got whacked and not any other USB ports. </s>
<s> The reason the frt. </s>
<s> ports cause remaining USB issues, it that the USB calls for service become bogged down and aren't released fast enough, IMO. </s>
<s> Again related to possible hosed USB hub. </s>
<s> Follow the frt. </s>
<s> USB harness and reset the harness fully, several times. </s>
<s> If the problem persists then damaged hub. </s>

<s> Willy, thank you so much for your help and Rosalynd's. </s>
<s> I opened the case, followed all wires from the front USB ports and made sure all connections were firmly seated. </s>
<s> It didn't feel like anything moved but, I am pleased to say, the front ports now work. </s>
<s> Thank you again for your replies. </s>
