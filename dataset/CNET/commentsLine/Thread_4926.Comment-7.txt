i'd be using ubuntu 10.04 (lucid).
and i believe i would have been reading a very outdated article somewheres online, since i read on wikipedia that full support is available in the kernel, for some versions already, using the ntfs-3g driver, which should be included in most distros by default.
sorry for the confusion i may have created, which could have been prevented if i just researched more carefully.
i just wanted to be sure, though, anyways.
thanks for the help.
