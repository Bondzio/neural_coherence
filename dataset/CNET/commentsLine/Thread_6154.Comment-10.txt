a single +12v rail means you don't need to check into if one or more rails could be overtaxed by your gpu or other choices.
you also don't have to take care for run the one rail to your gpu then the others to drives and such.
that's called balancing the rails, well discussed and most folk burst into flames when they find out about this.
