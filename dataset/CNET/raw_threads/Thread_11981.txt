One day my wifi was working and the next day, after a shut down and reboot, it stopped working. I have the latest driver and management software for my Intel wireless wifi link 4965AGN; and while it sees all the networks and connects, I cannot get online. I checked everything I could think of and finally think I have the problem. The ping test fails every time. Any help on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated. Also, the machine is a Sony Vaio AR520E running Vista Home Premium SP2.

From the run box type &quot;cmd /k ipconfig /all&quot; and then look for your DNS settings they should look something like this DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 208.67.222.222 208.67.220.220 They can and properly will be different; you can use the DNS server above. Give these two things a try and see if you have any luck

Connect your laptop to it. If you have internet connection, then your router (wired portion of it anyway) and your laptop is not the problem. It's only your wireless stuff that's gone kaput.
