I'm using an Iomega 80GB HDD external hard drive for backup.
It's attached to a PC running windows xp.
When it gets full it the backups don't work, and deleting items just sends them to a recycle bin which I can't find an icon for.
Occasionally I'll get a message to the effect that the disk is full, and do I want to empty the recycle bin?
And that frees up enough space to continue the backups.
How do I access the recycle bin without waiting for the 'disk full' message?
If it makes a difference, I just switched from using Iomega's software to attaching the drive as a plug'n'play.
