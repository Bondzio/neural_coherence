Analog only Res: 1280 x 1024 Contrast: 450:1 Response: 16ms $199.99 After Rebate Brightness: 300nit (cd/m) Stereo Speakers How will this do for general computer usage? No gaming, just word processor and internet usage primarily. Any feed back would be appreciated. Thanks

The contrast is good and the response time is also. Their are better but for the price it looks good to me. I would though look up on google.com the model number and read about others experiences with that particular model. It could have a distortion inherent or whatever. Moirre is screwy, again whatever. I am going with a 19&quot; CRT,but mine is for gaming mostly and I don't care about how much space it takes either. Oh and for the same if not lower price btw. Good Luck, SeaninWa
