i'm a seriously hardcore gamer.
but since i've been in university, i haven't got the funds to buy or build a high-end pc.
right now i'm running an athlon xp 3000+ with 512 ddr and a aiw 9800 pro and i can still play doom iii with more than sastifactory graphics.
i know i may get flak for this but somtimes the newest isn't always the best.
