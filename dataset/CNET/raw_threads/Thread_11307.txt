The brutal reality is that in the US even a 200 buck printer may &quot;cost too much to fix&quot; so such diagnostics and tools and even a service manual will never be found. Small parts like ink cartridges are always replacable. The move to a disposable printer grinds some people the wrong way but it explains why nearly nothing is available as to manuals and diagnostics. In closing, even if you found what part you needed, it's not in stock. Cheers, bob
