Alas, the memory advisor on www.crucial.com in an alphabetical list of HP models has nothing between &quot;Presario&quot; and &quot;Professional&quot;.
So no &quot;Probook&quot;.
So you might have to check the manual about what type of memory it has and what's the maximum amount.
Luckily, I understand it now has 4 GB and for most people that's enough.
