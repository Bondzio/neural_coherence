<s> Has anyone put a 6600gt card in either the T6212 or the 827 GM? </s>
<s> They both have the same MoBo. </s>
<s> Emachines and Gateway strongly recommend using an ATI based graphics card stated in their documentation and include a $20 rebate for the ATI Radeon X700 Pro. </s>
<s> Do you think putting in a 6600gt board would create a conflict? </s>
<s> Thanks......................... Tom </s>

<s> Hi Tom, Emachine gives the motherboard part number in this link, as MS-7093 which is the RS480M2-IL motherboard: http://parts.emachines.com/emachines/sys_lookup.asp (Select Model) I have been unable to find a link with Gateway or other creditable sites that gives the motherboard brand/number of the Gateway 827GM. </s>
<s> Can you provide? </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> No link. </s>
<s> I called Gateway and they were no help. </s>
<s> I went to Circuit City and asked the saleman to open the case and saw MS-7093 on the board. </s>

<s> if u get the 6600gt, most likely no conflict. </s>
<s> How would there be? </s>
<s> just disable the ati integrated graphics. </s>
<s> Hey, Well I think when he used that word 'conflict' it was not a good representation. </s>
<s> I could be wrong though. </s>
<s> As they, Nvidia and ATI, are both supported by the PCI-Express slot on both machines. </s>
<s> To the best of my knowledge. </s>
<s> What I would like to know and I think he would too is would it just be better then to use a ATI card x600,x700,x800,x850 etc than to use Nvidia card. </s>
<s> Since the documentation, from what I understand here, supports both but recommends ATI cards. </s>
<s> I have read here also though to get the 6600gt over say the x700pro, since it performs better, evidently regardless of the ATI card recommendation in the documentation. </s>
<s> Is that a fair statement? </s>
<s> I will next week be purchasing one of the two and I am still not sure which. </s>
<s> I am leaning toward the 6600gt now after reading some on it. </s>
<s> But I don't know if any retailer (only 3 I canthink of are Best Buy, Circuit City and CompUSA) in my area carries a 6600gt PCI-E card and I DON'T want to wait I want it all the same day lol. </s>
<s> I have checked online and none of them have them it seems, or are out of stock heh. </s>
<s> Plenty of x700pro's though. </s>
<s> Can't find x700xt's in retail stores though . </s>
<s> Good Luck to us both btw! </s>
<s> x700xt arent really made anymore. </s>
<s> check newegg. </s>
<s> they had 6600gt around $150. </s>
<s> but u said u dont wanna wait If u want ati would not recommend getting the x700. </s>
<s> go for the x800xl as it performs better than 6800 gt but the problem is ati doesnt have the pixel shaders or something supported in the next unrreal tournment game and other games. </s>
<s> dat is y most ppl buy nvidia. </s>
<s> however the ati is faster and would still work with the games just look a little junker or something however, most ppl dont care as the performance for the price of the x800xl is a bargain. </s>
<s> the x800xl also has 16 pixel lines. </s>
<s> 6600GTs are way better than an X700 Pro. </s>
<s> It is always recommended even if you don't have a motherboard based on ati graphics to stick with ati if you have it already on your computer and nvidia if you have that. </s>
<s> Mostly, ATIs are stuck to intel and Nvidia to AMD, the 2 makers have equal shares in apple. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> Just remember that EVGA 6600gt recommends a 350 watt minimum power supply as per their web site. </s>
<s> They can be had for somewhere around $40. </s>
<s> i think u meant $140 maybe. </s>
<s> man i wish there was a 6600 gt around dat price. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
