flash memory could only be a taken as a serious contender to replace hard drives when they can be made as reliable, as cost effective (roughly equal to the cost per mb as say 2 years ago) and capacity equal to that of the hard drive - for instance my pc uses 100gb of hard drive, and it is not unusual to find ones with even higher capacities, data tranfer rates are also a priority, as i understand that the present data transfer rates of flash memory is relatively low compared to that of the hard drive tough this may be able to be overcome partially if motherboards could be fitted with card-reader slots.
a very serious halfway alterntative would be to fit them with both card reader slots in addition to ide or eide connections
