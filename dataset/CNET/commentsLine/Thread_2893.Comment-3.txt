i've ordered dozens of things from amazon, and never had a problem with them, although i can't say how well this device will fit your needs.
if you're looking for convenience, you might find one of the car chargers more suitable.
you plug them into the 12 v power outlet in your car, then plug your devices into the car charger to charge.
` good luck.
