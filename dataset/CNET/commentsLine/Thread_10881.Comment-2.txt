it turned out to be the sound driver.
this one had driven many tech insane as all cds worked as well as mp3s and many dvds.
i will not dive into the gritty details but the theory is the dvd used the 5.1 stereo portion of the audio driver and that is where i guess the flaw was.
finding the latest driver was not easy since it was some oem motherboard by fujitsu-siemans.
but a little sleuthing and we found it.
your issue sounds oh so familiar.
bob ps.
and yes, the microsoft update driver button announced it had the latest drivers.
i wonder if they'll ever fix that.
