whether internal or external, a 320gb hard drive (1gb = 1,000,000 bits by definition) is equal to a 298gb hard drive (gb = 1,073,741,824 bits by definition).
a 320gb hard drive is expected to show as 298gb hard drive in many places in xp.
this is not an issue of the hard drive's own controller, a motherboard controller, or a controller in an external enclosure.
it is a matter counting the total number of bits using different scales.
the total number of bits on the hard drive does not change--the definition of &quot;gb&quot; does change.
