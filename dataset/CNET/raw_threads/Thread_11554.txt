I'm fully permitted to access this signal. I have an HP laptop with internal wireless antennas. I can kind of pick up the wireless signal standing in my parking lot, but once I'm inside my unit, it's completely gone. Today, I went to CompUSA and bought the Hawking Hi-Gain USB Dish Adapter. It works, but only so-so. The signal I'm getting is weak, and I have to leave the dish hanging out of my window. I can't use this permanently. What kind of hardware do you guys recommend for me to get? There has to be something more high-powered than the little desk-top dish that I bought. I'm thinking along the lines of those big RV antennas because they can be left outside in rain, heat, and snow. Is that overkill? Is there a brand or a product you have experience with that you can recommend? Thank you all for any advice you can give! Chris Hall
