<s> I currently have comcast high speed internet (and phone). </s>
<s> I have a netgear wireless router. </s>
<s> I use this combination to provide internet access to 3 laptops and 1 desktop. </s>
<s> The router is dying on me and so I need to replace it but before I do I want to make sure I am doing the right thing wrt/expandibility. </s>
<s> I want to be able to provide access to the following machines/boxes and the preferred method. </s>
<s> Xbox360 Ethernet 1 Desktop Ethernet 4 laptops WiFi Roku for Netflix Ethernet The wireless part seems straight forward enough. </s>
<s> The problem I am having is the ethernet lines. </s>
<s> I don't want to run ethernet through my house. </s>
<s> It is old house, and I would be limited to those rooms I can access through crawl space. </s>
<s> The locations of the ethernet drops are varied in the house, and actually could vary from time to time, for example, if my son takes his XBox and connects it up to the HDTV instead of his current TV. </s>
<s> I have read about the power line network stuff. </s>
<s> Does that really work worth a flip? </s>
<s> My house is old and I don't know that all the outlets i would use are on the same circuit. </s>
<s> Does that matter? </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> E </s>
<s> And yes it must be on the same circuit. </s>
<s> While I could rejigger the wiring in the panel to make it work I imagine many would cringe at that change in the home wiring even if it is trivial. </s>
