Just wondered if anyone had any recommendations on a reliable, good value external hard drive that is at least 1tb in size. I am looking to take all the old files off my laptop and transfer them onto my mac. Thanks Ash

Please don't do that. COPY the files to the drive. Get them on the other machine and never trust these drives. Why? (read this forum)
