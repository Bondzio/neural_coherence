<s> Alright, this may seem like a stupid question, but so far I couldn't find the answer. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what motherboard Dell ships in an XPS 410 if you select a Pentium D processor? </s>
<s> I know the 410 is made for Core 2 Duo and that the 400 was the one with Pentium D, but the 400 is gone now and I don't know the motherboard in either of them. </s>
<s> Help? </s>
<s> Here's the motherboard's specs. </s>
<s> I copied this off of Dell's website: Socket Type Socket - T (LGA 755) CPU Support Pentium 4 from 631(3.0G) upto 661(3.6G) </s>
<s> Thanks a bunch. </s>
<s> I couldn't find it for some reason. </s>
<s> Would you mind posting a link to the page? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> DELL sneaks in their own little assortment of drivers for their motherboards too. </s>
<s> Thos specs aren't etched in stone. </s>
<s> If your thinking &quot;modification&quot;, be ye ever ready. </s>
<s> Went thru it one time - got tricked - wasted some clams. </s>
