i still recommend, testing several kybds.
at larger store or office centers to get a &quot;feel&quot; for what's out there.
this is the only time, you can get the &quot;hands-on&quot; approach to a replacement kybd.
you may find the one you like or get to like.
no amount of surfing will provide that, though i recommend a brand name to at least provide the reliability of a good kybd.
the rest is up to you and that is a preference you'll come to find by &quot;trial and error&quot;, i'm afraid.
fyi- i have come to like the kensington brand kybd.
i now use as it feels good, yet solid and not so readily pushed about when i type.
usually, the only reason i abandon a kybd.
is because i've worn out some keys or gotten so dirty, response is weak at times.
