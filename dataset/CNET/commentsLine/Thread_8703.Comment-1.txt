help!
i make music on my laptop, and use an external hard drive for all the storage.
i have been working on an album for the past year.
i recently had some device i/o errors with my western digital mybook essential 500 gb when trying to access a couple of my song files.
i figured since it was an i/o error it must be a problem with the enclosure.
so i took out the hard drive (3.5&quot; sata) and put it in a new enclosure.
now when i look at the folder with the song files, it shows that it is empty, size 0, size on disc 0, contains 0 folders.
my other folders still have data, just not this one that i was accessing when the i/o errors started happening.
is my data gone forever?
is there a reliable data recovery program?
i'm desperate and would truly appreciate any help.
i signed up to cnet just for this.
thanks.
