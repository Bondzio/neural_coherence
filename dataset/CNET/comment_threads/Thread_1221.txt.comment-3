Both are IDE hard drive.
I have two Hard drive partition, Master drive is Windows XP and other is the windows 7 beta that just released(slave drive).
I wiped out the second hdd with Darik's Boot And Nuke http://www.dban.org/ to stop the dual boot.
It didn't work.
So i right click my computer -&gt; Manage -&gt; device manager -&gt; Disk Drive -&gt; right click -&gt; Uninstall the hdd still didn't stop the dual boot but now i cannot see the 2nd hdd in my computer anymore.
I just want the second Hdd to become the slave and not another dual boot?
