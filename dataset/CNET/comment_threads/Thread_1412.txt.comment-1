I have a old pentium 2 computer with a 3 gig hard drive.
My uncle thought it would be &quot;nice&quot; to format that and then give me windows xp pro along with microsoft office.
I now have about 400 mb of space LEFT( he thought that was soooo funny).
I put in another 3 gig hard drive that has already been formated and is compleatly empty.
my question is what do I now need to do to make everything work, AND transfer some stuff from one to the other.
Or whatever will work the best.
HELP!!!!!
!
