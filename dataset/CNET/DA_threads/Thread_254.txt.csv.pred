1.1.1	I own a philips 107b4 model crt monitor .	St
1.1.2	I 'm satisfied with what i 've bought , but for the past several weeks the picture gets more and more distorted .	St
1.1.3	The distorsion is in an & quot ; eye & quot ; shape , which means the corners of the picture & quot ; move & quot ; toward the mid of the monitor ( upwards and downwards respectably ) .	St
1.1.4	I 've found good reviews on this crt model , but here , in Macedonia , noone knows why the picture gets distorted .	St
1.1.5	What should i do ?	Ques
1.2.1	I suspect you have a monitor issue .	St
1.2.2	Some things to fuss with .	St
1.2.3	Use the degauss feature of the monitor a couple of times ... see if anything changes .	St
1.2.4	Verify the refresh rate and screen res selected are supported by the monitor .	St
1.2.5	Beg/borrow/steal another monitor for a test .	St
1.2.6	Take your monitor to another machine for a test .	St
1.3.1	various monitor controls , such as pincushion and trapezoid ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.2	After the degauss .	St
1.4.1	I 've tried the degaussing already .	St
1.4.2	It did n't work .	St
1.4.3	I 've tried adjusting the convergence , trapezoid , paralelogram and so on ... Several times .	St
1.4.4	My girlfriend has Samsung SyncMaster 997MB .	St
1.4.5	It too has a ErgoFlat tech CRT .	St
1.4.6	I noticed it has the same distortion .	St
1.4.7	I guess that ( distortion ) is something any monitor with this tech has .	St
1.4.8	I 'll try contacting Philips on this issue as well .	St
1.4.9	Thank You , Dejan	St
