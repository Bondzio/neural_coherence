i had some trouble tracking this down.
it is not a vista driver.
i hope this is the brand name/manufacturer for this web cam.
of the few sites that did list some form of driver for it, none said they had a driver for vista.
seek out the manufacturer of this product and see if the driver is available from there web site.
i had the same problem with a web cam and the simplest solution was to get a new one.
also, i have mcafee site advisor on my computer and i don't believe i've ever seen so few sites reviewed or so many yellow warnings then i had on this search.
where did you get that thing?
there certainly in a bad neighborhood.
