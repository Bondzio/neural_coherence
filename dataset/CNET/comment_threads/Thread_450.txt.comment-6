DDR2 Considers to be good because of the FSB but who knows im on SDRAM with a FSB of 133Mhz i'd rather take AMD but the speed of an intel is way better i'll probably try PCI Express instead of AGP want a 500 Watt Power Supply ATI Always dont know which socket to get yet haven't decided on the motherboard yet about the HD's i want a retail version so I want have to search for SATA wires which aren't included with the OEM RAID is mostly used for servers but can still be used for personal use but rather not Cases Ultra, Thermaltake or Aspire or other selections yeah I know about tigerdirect and newegg geforce 7 to expensive rather have an LCD 64-Bit AMD or Intel not much of a gamer so the card doesnt have to be that good at all
