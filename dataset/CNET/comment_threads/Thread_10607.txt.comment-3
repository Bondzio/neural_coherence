I dont see a TV tuner on it.
Tough, the box mentions &quot;TV FEATURES&quot; on it.
Anyways, My Video-IN drivers are now working fine.
The only thing not is &quot;nVIDIA WDM TVTuner&quot;.
The problem i have now, is that I cant recieve a full screen video.
I recieve channels, but not full screen.
I use WINDVD Creator.
What other options do i have?
