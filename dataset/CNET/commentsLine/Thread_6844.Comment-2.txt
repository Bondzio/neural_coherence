it could be how the card came formatted.
i don't know what os your htc runs but windows programs have some limits on file size and the number of files that can be contained in one folder...at least with fat.
as for the read only issue, this might depend on from where the media was copied.
if from cd/dvd, they will be read only files and that attribute goes with their being copied to a new location.
if you've not tried this, you could copy these files to a pc first, remove the read only attribute and then copy them to the sd card.
that should work.
