<s> Hey, I'm looking for a burner that won't stop working on me. </s>
<s> I've purchased 2 burners that broke down in only a couple of uses. </s>
<s> I don't care about the speed and stuff, I just need recommendations of CD-RW drives. </s>
<s> One that can burn hundreds of CDs and not stop burning. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> That is VERY VERY ODD! </s>
<s> The last time we encountered such a thing... 1. </s>
<s> The case was far too hot. </s>
<s> It was cooking the drives. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The power supply was fair too out of spec. </s>
<s> I've used from 9 dollar to 30 dollar CDRW drives for years now and they do very well. </s>
<s> At this price I'm very happy as they go past 2 years old. </s>
<s> My thought here is that something else is wrong. </s>

<s> How do I check if something else is wrong? </s>
<s> My first burner was on my old computer - that one was fairly cheap. </s>
<s> The other one automatically came on my Alienware computer, so I don't know how much that one cost. </s>
<s> I've seen searching on the internet on drives for the burner but that hasn't worked. </s>
<s> Thanks for replying so quick ! </s>
<s> Windows doesn't need such. </s>
<s> However you may need software to record onto CDR or CDRW with. </s>
<s> I use http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ a bit. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I use Ahead Nero. </s>
<s> Also my CD-RW is a Lite-ON LTR-48246S </s>
<s> http://www.cdfreaks.com/drive/48 Also, now that you note that drive model, something does not jive with your claims such died in a few months. </s>
<s> These models were available in the early 2003 timeframe. </s>
<s> This is late 2004 so you may have had this unit for almost 18 months. </s>
<s> Given the prices we pay for CDRW drives you may have to pay out 20 to 40 bucks or less every 1 to 2 years. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I kind of wondered, based on your hundreds of CDs comment, whether you using the deck for a commercial purpose? </s>
<s> Anyway, the 8x DVD-RW dual format burner I bought is down to $49.00 US. </s>
<s> That has a 40x CD burn speed. </s>
<s> Something you might keep in mind. </s>
