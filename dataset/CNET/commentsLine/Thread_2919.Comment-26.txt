i've been buying a new computer about every two years, and so far have had only one major problem, on a hp pavilion.
however, that was not a hard drive, but a total motherboard failure.
as it was still under original warranty, it was fixed free of charge.
about 15 years now with no hard drive problems.
hope this doesn't jinx me.
