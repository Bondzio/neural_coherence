<s> Hi Guys, I come across with very wiered problem...I have a external hard drive with 40GB with two(2) 20GB partitions. </s>
<s> Both partitions are showing only 1GB or 3GB free disk space. </s>
<s> But there is only 4.83GB on first and 1GB of data (normal or hidden) on second partition I can see and rest of the data is invisible. </s>
<s> I have tried Digital Rescue to recover but it didn't help. </s>
<s> Can anyone plz help me sort out this problem as I am unable to understand the real cause...... Also I remember copying some data which is also invisible..... Is there any software which can look for invisible (not deleted) data???? </s>
<s> Any help or comments will be appreciated... </s>
<s> Thanks -- SJunejo </s>
<s> The top of this very forum in the Lost and Found post notes many titles. </s>
<s> But the one I want to give the first nod to is in &quot;The LaCie Miracle.&quot; By booting that CD and without any knowledge of Linux or installing any new software I can look at such drives and often see what is hidden from Windows. </s>
<s> But that does not mean I would delete such. </s>
<s> Many times these are recovery systems. </s>

<s> what is that suppose to mean....??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Hi Bob, I think you mean I should try to connect my drive to a Linux PC ..... Will update you if I get it through.... </s>
<s> But, I don't remember plugging my drive into any Linux machine ever....anyway let's see.... </s>
<s> Regards, -- SJunejo </s>

<s> The LaCie miracle and other posts here note how to boot some Linux from CD and use it without installing. </s>
<s> It also tells you that no Linux knowledge is required. </s>
