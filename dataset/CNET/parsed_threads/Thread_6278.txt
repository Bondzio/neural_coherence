<s> Hello, I have been looking for a netbook that could truly handle streaming vids (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, etc). </s>
<s> I have read many reviews but it seems that nothing on the market can truly nail that one down...is that true? </s>
<s> If not, any recommendations? </s>
<s> The HP Mini 311 appears to be the best one so far? </s>
<s> I have been a mac user for many years so I don't know much about the PC market, or anything IT in general, so pardon my ignorance... E. </s>
<s> The common netbook can't do this unless we keep the video in less than full screen. </s>
<s> The better netbook with the ION VIDEO CHIPSET can do this but then we are in the price range of a normal laptop. </s>
<s> Which begs the question &quot;Why a netbook?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Yeah, I see what you're saying, and that's what I was afraid of...sigh! </s>
