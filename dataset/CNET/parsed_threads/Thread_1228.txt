<s> Maybe I'm a little to novice to ask this question, but I'm curios and would like to learn. </s>
<s> In my opinion, AM, FM, ShortWave, and Ham Radio waves would have more coverage, or a beter signal in case some trees or other obstacles are in the way, than WiFi. </s>
<s> Wouldn't it be possible to modulate and demodulate Wireless Network into an other radio wave? </s>
<s> In other words have a wireless network that transmits in AM, FM, Short Wave, or Ham waves? </s>
<s> Another thought. </s>
<s> What would the results be, or is it possible to connect a GSM or GPRS access point to a network, then catch it with GPRS card on the computer. </s>
<s> Wouldn't that give more coverage. </s>
<s> (more distance) Wouldn't that be a way also to connect with a cell phone, and avoid the cell phone service providers high per/bit transfer rate? </s>
<s> What would be legal? </s>
<s> Would anyone be dangerous? </s>
<s> ETC.... </s>
<s> I will not research what the FCC regs are but you can. </s>
<s> Can you share why you need more than what 802.11a/b/g/n Wifi gives you today? </s>

<s> I'm searching for a way to get WiFi or in other words, any wireless network to my parents house located 2 kilometers form my house. </s>
<s> See pictures and stories. </s>
<s> http://www.usbwifi.orcon.net.nz/ notes 3 to 5 KM so your's is less than that. </s>
<s> The only requirement is LOS. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Those frequencies you mention are relatively low. </s>
<s> Because of this the data transmission will be low. </s>
<s> Higher frequency means higher data speed. </s>
<s> Data can be and is sent within those lower frequencies. </s>
<s> But it's usually slower than dialup. </s>
<s> If you'll dig a little, notice the specific frequencies involved with the b, g, and n ranges and notice the associated data rates. </s>
<s> Is it possable to set up a GSM or GPRS Access Point from ones own network? </s>
<s> Wouldn't that have a high range? </s>
<s> I was under an impression you wanted a 2KM link from your house to theirs. </s>
<s> But that's not it? </s>
<s> There are EVDO ROUTERS that take the usual data card from your telco/cellco and work great for remote locations. </s>
