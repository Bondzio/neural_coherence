<s> Help - my flat monitor screen is now &quot;wavy&quot; whenever I scroll up and down on a page. </s>
<s> I don't know why this started or how to end it. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Redrover, Start with connecting a good old CRT in stead of the LCD to see what happens. </s>
<s> It's an easy swap. </s>
<s> If that's OK I suspect the monitor itself. </s>
<s> If that's wavy either, I suspect the videocard (or the driver, but that's a rather theoretical option, I think). </s>

<s> wavy? </s>
<s> like a narrow large S on the left and right? </s>
<s> or it waves as you scroll, as you said? </s>
<s> This usually means you don't have enough video power, video ram; pics and web pages should also take a bit to load all the way down. </s>
<s> This usually happens with 2mb, maybe 4mb Vram. </s>
<s> Download and use Aida32 utility to check... A flat screen doesn't need more Vram, so the previous idea of another monitor (CRT) is good-quick. </s>
<s> XP? </s>
<s> W98? </s>
<s> DirectX 8.1 or above? </s>
<s> It waves as I scroll up and down on a page. </s>
<s> It's supposed to be smooth. </s>
<s> I have to stop scrolling for the wave to catch up so I can read what's on the page. </s>
<s> I have Windows XP. </s>
<s> redrover, Check drivers first .... Then try to slow down the Hwd acceleration. </s>
<s> Display Properties -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advance Open Troubleshoot tab -&gt; slow down Hwd acceleration slider is in middle of window. </s>
<s> This happened to my main system after upgrade to GeForce2 MX/MX400 video card and third monitor. </s>
<s> The effect was only on this card and attached monitor. </s>
<s> Bill . </s>
<s> I formatted the drive in my sons's Gateway laptop after backing up all data. </s>
<s> After installing XP PRO and Office 2003 and running all updates I discovered the same wavy screen. </s>
<s> The device manager showed the VGA graphics drivers missing. </s>
<s> The correct driver would not download to this workstation. </s>
<s> I downloaded and transferred across the network. </s>
<s> The file extracted. </s>
<s> I then pointed the driver reinstall to the cab files for this download and it installed falwlessly. </s>
<s> No more wavy screen and the device mgr shows the drivers to be intact. </s>
<s> He also runs a second monitor (CRT FLAT SCREEN)and it works fine. </s>
<s> One neat trick is if you do not want the laptop monitor on, crank up the resolution where the laptop monitor cannot perform and it will shutdown. </s>
<s> Now you can use only the CRT external if need be. </s>
<s> I turned the slider all the way to the left and now the scrolling is perfect...Thanx for the fix..MG </s>
