Before connecting a new desktop PC to the internet for the first time using either cable modem or DSL; besides having a very good anti-virus software program installed; what other software should I also have installed before I connect to the internet using a high speed connection for the first time?

Your broadband connection should also connect through a router which has a NAT (hardware) firewall. This is a deterent and not totally secure, however. You will want a decent browser and e-mail handler and the two that come from MS with XP are not on the &quot;good&quot; list. You can also install a software firewall but these may take some tweaking to make them work as you wish. I use the free Sygate product. I don't know if it's ever blocked an attack but that's not what's most important. Lastly, an overlooked defense is ones personal care while surfing. Some would say never jump off a building without a parachute. I say, never jump off a building. Hope that helps.

Hi Big Steve, I see you are concerned about your new computer's security especially since you recently posted the other day: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=62148&messageID=736563 Steven Haninger is an excellent computer tech and has given good advice along with others, but since you have made two different threads showing your concern, may I suggest you post in the Virus & Security Alerts forum. There are many experts there just waiting for someone concerned like you to post. http://reviews.cnet.com/5204-6132-0.html?forumID=32&start=0 As for myself, on my best desktop (WinXP SP2), I have Nortons Systems Works (it has the AntiVirus included along with other great stuff), and two free Spyware detection programs (AdAware & SpyBot), and the new BETA Microsoft Anti-Spyware (currently free until around July). I have the Firewall in WinXP SP2 disabled to use the free Zone Alarm Firewall as it gives coverage on the IN and OUT. On my other computers I use the free Avast antiVirus program instead of the free AVG, free Spyware (AdAware & SpyBot) and the free Zone Alarm Firewall. Regards,
