<s> Hi I recently purchased a canon SD600 digital camera and i also bought the Canon PIXMA printer. </s>
<s> However, I have also noted that Canon makes the Selphy Compact Photo Printer which does cost less than the PIXMA. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me the real difference and which you would recommend? </s>
<s> At this time, I am unable to find reviews on the PIXMA mini260, but the Selphy got great reviews. </s>
<s> Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving!!!!!!!!!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> The printers are very different. </s>
<s> The Pixma mini260 is an inkjet printer, while the Selphys are dye sublimation. </s>
<s> See this review of the mini260 and a comparable HP printer: http://www.behardware.com/articles/636-1/new-canon-and-hp-inkjet-printers-new-technologies.html Also check this: http://www.behardware.com/articles/608-1/survey-twelve-4.html </s>
