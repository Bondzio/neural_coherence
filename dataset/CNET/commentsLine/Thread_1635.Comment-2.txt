just discussed at  your comment of &quot;my first idea was to store on hard drive but last week i dropped one of mine in its external casing and the drive broke (i had almost had everything on backup but i lost a month of recording).
so now i am unsure how i should procede.&quot; is telling me you don't have a backup system.
or even a second copy.
no matter which system you used, without a second copy none will satisfactory.
&quot;i am wondering on wich support to keep that library.&quot; before i comment further, said library must have a backup system.
&quot;one hard drive a year and a copy on another location.&quot; seems to be ok. when one fails you toss it, get new and clone the copy again.
cheap, big storage.
pretty fast but no write protection means that if the user errored or some virus did it in that the same fate awaits the second copy.
where's the write protection?
&quot;copy the mp3 on a dvd.&quot; here's the care, handling document:  here's the lifespan document:  &quot;copy the mp3 on dss (dat) tape.&quot; the only downside here is that dat tape and readers are not widely available.
it's not something i'd consider today.
