i have a question about cat 3 cable.
is it possible to have cat 3 cable run at 100mb?
my company currently has cat 3 cable in some of our buildings at the moment ( there is cat 5e in most of the other buildings).
if it is possible, how stable is it?
and over what distance is it capable of substaining (if possible that is) 100mb.
my company does plan to sometime in the future to replace the cat 3 cable with either cat 5e or cat 6, but for right now, we are trying to determine whether we can run the cat 3 at cat 5 speeds.
thanks for any information you can provide.
