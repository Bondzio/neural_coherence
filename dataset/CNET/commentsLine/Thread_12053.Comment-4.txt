unless you are very rich there is no such thing as a off the shelf 'gaming computer'.
the majority of gamers build their own.
that way you can assemble a computer without spending mega bucks.
as you claim you are not too computer literate start by googling the web for the fastest cpu, the best video cards and the best motherboard.
make a note on the specifications, and price of each component.
this would give you an idea of the cost.
don't get caught up with the 'speed' hype.
a good dual processor will blow the doors off of a quad or even a six cpu.
remember that intel is better than amd.
you also would want to get the best power supply, and ram you can afford along with a good mid size case.
goto all the forums and glean them for information.
this way you will be able to get a good computer without buying a ready made one.
my saying on this is 'get a pc at bestbuy,walmart etc get a computer by building it yourself'.
with modern computer parts it is quite easy to assemble your own.
gone are the days where you had to jumper motherboards and needed an engineering degree to set one up.
good luck.
