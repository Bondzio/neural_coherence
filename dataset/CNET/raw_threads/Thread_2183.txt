I was just going to get one off of a website or something but i really think building one would be fun and make the system hold a sense of ownership. All i really need is a setup that would work with the CPU and GPUs i want i just dont know what else i would need like right size case, cables, and or other stuff like that. pretty much i need everthing else to house a AMD 4000+ CPU and two OCed nvidia 7800 GT graphic cards and a 600watt SLI rdy power supply. This is what i got so far off tigerdirect for bout a grand &gt;AMD Athlon 64 4000+ / 1MB Cache / 2000MHz FSB / Socket 939 / San Diego Core / Processor with Fan &gt;Two (2) XFX GeForce 7800 GT Overclocked 256MB DDR3 PCI Express Video Cards and an Ultra X-Finity 600 Watt Power Supply (comes with 600 power supply) I havnt done this before and im only looking to spend about 1600+ but if there is a way to keep the price down i would like to have a FX53 cpu:) and no dual core stuff plz i know it rocks and i will upgrade later when every game is dual cored thanks

Sorry it won't happen. You said you want the 4000+ and are going to upgrade in the future; I suggested dual-core but we had this conversation already in your previous post. Why would you get a powerful processor like the 4000+ when a cheaper alternative will work just fine? Games aren't heavily depended on the processor, memory and graphics card matter the most in gaming. Here this would be my system build, so that you won't have to spend a whole great deal now and you can upgrade in the future. Processor Case Hard Drive OpticalDrive Motherboard Memory That is about all the parts you need right now. Of course you got your power supply, along with the graphics cards so no problem there. You will need your own copy of the OS. The case I suggested is great because it allows for plenty of airflow, critical for your hot running overclocked graphics cards. Get some Artic Silver thermal compound if you are going to overclock the processor, or in general want a reliable thermal compound. I believe the processor ships with the compound (but that is the cheap kind). You might want more case fans, or a better heatsink; all up to you. The components is the list may tip over $1600 (along with your graphics cards and your power supply), but they are quality products that will last you for a long time.

That motherboard you suggested the GIGABYTE GA-K8NF-9 Socket 939 NVIDIA nForce4-4X can't handle SLI, and also Sharpiessharp doesn't want dual-core processors for some reason, only wants single core processors.
