i work for a charitable outreach that receives, among other things, donated computers.
i perform a lobotomy on them, reinstall windows and a couple other items, and give them away to a family who would otherwise not have access to a computer.
i was given a compaq prosignia 200 which is apparently a server since it has 3 hard drives and different cables and configuration.
i have no interest in using this machine as a server, and i simply want to do the same fdisk and reformat that i normally do.
well, if youve followed this thread this far you know that whatever type of hard drive (scsi?)
that a server uses is not going to let me do the standard pc operations.
is there any way to download a bios or do some kind of mumbo-jumbo that will allow me to turn this baby into a standard pc?
and can i perform some operation on the other two hard drives so that i can use them in old machines?
