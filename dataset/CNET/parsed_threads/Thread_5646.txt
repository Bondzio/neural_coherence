<s> I need help finding the best wireless networking system. </s>
<s> I need it to reach like 500 ft and through maybe 5 walls. </s>
<s> What system has the best range and the best for the price. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> All stock systems have limited and specific power output per FCC regulations. </s>
<s> All the name brands are good, I use D-link. </s>
<s> But extenders are available. </s>
<s> So far I've had to install another WAP where needed when range and walls impede the signal. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I was thinking that maybe the netgear system is good because they have those wall outlet extentions which i could set up all over the house. </s>
<s> Would this work? </s>
<s> Thanks for help </s>
<s> I have a linksys system right now, I tried the N range thing but that didnt work as good as it sounded. </s>
<s> Then I tried the N range and the range expansion from linksys and still that did not work that good. </s>
<s> I would get signal then it would go away then come back. </s>
<s> What I really would like is a strong enough signal for my ps3 which has a built in wifi signal. </s>
<s> I tested it out next to the router and it worked but I want the ps3 in tv room not the computer room. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
