I have windows 98 se, i happen to love it.
My second tower is windows me, i want to use me for storage.
I don't know how to go about connecting the two towers or how to make one primary and other secondary or how to change the slave pins.
If anyone could take the time to explain I would so much appreciate it.
than you
