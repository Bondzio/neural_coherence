Then I click on the name again, and for about 2 seconds it tries to cennect, but then I get the same &quot;Saved, secured with WPA2&quot; and it's not working... On the other hand, when I used a wi-fi hotspot on my Android phone the wi-fi worked just fine. So, any of you know the solution? What should I edit in the router settings? Please help!

Second, I opened the router settings again, and I'll share the pictures to let you see what are the current details: http://puu.sh/43pVt/665ae848b2.png http://puu.sh/43pVT/b12027fd65.png
