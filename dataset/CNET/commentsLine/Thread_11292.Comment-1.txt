i recently had the hd in my ibook g4 crash.
i replaced it with a new one and now while im booting up with the os x cd for os installation, it wont look at the hd to install the os on.
so i went to disk utility and it recognizes the hd but for some reason the hd will not show up for me to select it during os installation.
do i need to go threw an initiallization process to get the hd to show up for that?
