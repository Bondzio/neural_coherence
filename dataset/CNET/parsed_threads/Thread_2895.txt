<s> Recently because of serious system instability, I ran chkdsk to see if the problem was related to bad clusters. </s>
<s> Of course Chkdsk found a string of errors, reporting things such as &quot;deleting corrupt attribute record...&quot;, &quot;deleting index entry...&quot;, and so on. </s>
<s> After a long wait, the system rebooted, but I found my system even more unstable. </s>
<s> Later I found out through the Event Viewer that Chkdsk did 'something' to numerous files in attempt to repair them. </s>
<s> Among those were Windows core system dll's. </s>
<s> When I tried to look for those files, they did not exist anywhere on the hard drive. </s>
<s> I am afraid that maybe Chkdsk didn't do a good job repairing the flies. </s>
<s> Perhaps what Chkdsk did was just overwriting the bad sectors? </s>
<s> I thought at least Chkdsk could move the file segments on that specific sector to another healthy sector to maintain file integrity. </s>
<s> I dare not to use Chkdsk again in the future, lest it should delete files by accident, rendering software, personal data, or even Windows useless. </s>
<s> My question is: should I expect Chkdsk to repair the hard drive while also maintaining data integrity? </s>
<s> Or is there any other way to do exactly the tasks mentioned above? </s>
<s> I'm going to decline writing what CHKDSK does and note it won't repair damaged files or a damages OS. </s>
<s> For that the tools vary with the OS. </s>
<s> Sometimes it's SFC /SCANNOW and for other OSes it's something else. </s>
<s> With all the malware out there, CHKDSK is only a minor tool in the kit. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Did you run just chkdsk, or did you use chkdsk /f/r? </s>
<s> Chkdsk by itself will only check the disk, with /f or /r, or both will move the info to good sectors. </s>
<s> Depending on the size of disk it may take awhile. </s>
<s> Also it may only happen on a reboot cause it needs exclusive rights to the drive. </s>
<s> SFC command will take you to original values, you will need to go to Microsoft update after the sfc was run. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Well, I manually made CHKDSK to run at bootup so that it can have so-called &quot;exclusive access&quot; to the harddrive. </s>
<s> My OS was not damaged before I ran CHKDSK; it was just unstable (which I later found out to be nTune's fault). </s>
<s> But AFTER I ran CHKDSK, some core system files were gone, such as msxml3r.dll, etc. </s>
<s> And these files were all reported as &quot;located in bad sector and was repaired&quot; in CHKDSK's log. </s>
<s> Even SFC /scannow did not totally recover them. </s>
<s> I had to copy the dll's from my original XP cd. </s>
<s> What I want to know is whether it's normal to lose data while disk utilities, such as CHKDSK, are doing their job? </s>
<s> It's all about backup. </s>
<s> But let's tackle MSXML3 since last week I ran into that and it was annoying that REGSVR32 MSXML3.DLL fails but if you download MSXML3.MSI and install that then all is well. </s>
<s> Go figure why. </s>
<s> Here's the MSXML3.MSI I used to correct this one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It might be worth trying 'system file checker'. </s>
<s> You will need your XP CD handy (or if on your harddrive as a partition it will find any files itself) Click Start &gt; Run &gt; type CMD press ok. </s>
<s> This will bring up a Command Prompt Type in: SFC /scannow (make sure you have a space after SFC) Hopefully this should repair or replace any corrupt or missing system files. </s>
<s> Tigger </s>
<s> Well then I guess it's prime time for me to make a backup of my drive. </s>
<s> It seems that I can't totally rely on CHKDSK. </s>
<s> Hopefully the bad sectors won't spread any faster. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> CHKDSK is a little boy sent out to do a big man's job. </s>
<s> There are several utilities that 'claim' to do this job, but only 1 that I know really does the job. </s>
<s> SPINRITE from Steve Gibson http://www.grc.com </s>
<s> &gt; CHKDSK is a little boy sent out to do a big man's job. </s>
<s> Actually, it's an old man. </s>
<s> It's been around since the boot-from-floppy days. </s>
<s> Someone mentioned the need to do a backup. </s>
<s> I do this twice a year (should do it more often) and my irreplaceable files, such as the pictures I've taken, are additionaly backed up onto a dvd and far away in my brother's safe. </s>
<s> Yes, It's old but it's been updated for NTFS. </s>
<s> And backups are nice but they can be nothing if you get bad copies. </s>
<s> I've had this happen with floppies, tapes, cds and dvds. </s>
<s> I make 2 or 3 copies of data files and have not lost data. </s>
<s> (YET!!!) </s>
<s> But I have had to use all 3 copies to recover data, some files. </s>
<s> well lets start off with the basics. </s>
<s> the hard drive is a thin mettallic layer of magnetic material. </s>
<s> this magnetic material is divided into clusters, pipes, sectors and all that fun jazz. </s>
<s> what chkdsk is checking for is imperfections in this magnetic layer, namely the clusters. </s>
<s> when chkdsk finds these errors on the platter (the term for the hard drive) it will attempt to fix these. </s>
<s> it will not go through your files and fix them. </s>
<s> 'this magnetic material is divided into clusters, pipes, sectors' Pipes??? </s>
<s> I don't think so! </s>
<s> 'what chkdsk is checking for is imperfections in this magnetic layer' Again I don't think so. </s>
<s> One thing it is looking for is &quot;lost clusters&quot;, clusters that are marked as in use but they are not. </s>
<s> Another thing it is looking at is the &quot;indexes&quot;. </s>
<s> I could go on but I won't. </s>
