CP / Disk Management shows &quot;C&quot; with 34.18 GB NTFS, and &quot;D&quot; with 40.34 GB NTFS (both show healthy) Note, this is in GB, referring to an 80 GB drive.
I think I found the answer on Google.
Following taken from Google hit... &quot;Because your system reserves 5% for root.
Even when the filesystem is full there is some space to root fix the things.
This extra space can be used only by root.&quot; Thanks Ben p.s.
Just curious... could the 5% space be recovered if wanted?
?
