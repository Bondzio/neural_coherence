1.1.1	Hi Cnet , Presently I am using a wired router for internet surfing etc .	St
1.1.2	I am using 2 pc 's and both have wireless connection capability .	St
1.1.3	I can see that there are wireless connections in my area and they are secured connections .	St
1.1.4	If possible is there a way to connect wirelessly to one of these ?	Ques
1.2.1	You 'll ask the owner of the wireless systems for the password .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Since you appear to already be paying for internet service , the obvious , easiest , and most reliable way would be to buy your own wireless router or add a WAP to your existing system .	St
1.3.2	Are you wanting to drop your ISP and tap into someone else service ?	Ques
1.3.3	If so , that may be illegal but is also very unreliable .	St
1.3.4	I know that some communities have installed wifi that 's available to subscribers at a cost that may be more attractive than some ISPs offer .	St
1.3.5	You could check into that possibility if you wish .	Sug
1.3.6	I do n't know much about how these work but suspect they may offer less than air tight security .	St
