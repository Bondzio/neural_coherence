1.1.1	I have an Intel 2.6Ghz which is working very well .	St
1.1.2	My temperature is ok but I still want it to be cooler .	St
1.1.3	It is always displaying 42 C and I would like to lower it .	St
1.1.4	I have not OC 'd it .	St
1.1.5	I know that 42 C is n't a big deal , but I would like to have a more efficient fan/HS anyway .	St
1.1.6	I have three case fans ( two exhaust fans in the back and one sucking air into the case on the side of the same ) .	St
1.1.7	Does anyone know about a top of the line fan for my processor in order to keep it even cooler ?	Ques
1.1.8	I want a better fan/heatsink ( NOT the thermal paste since I think that means that you ca n't get the HS/Fan off anymore ) for top $ 50 .	St
1.1.9	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	Charlie when you remove heat sink to put on a better one with larger fan/heat sink , the paste is n't a glue .	St
1.2.2	you have to i repeat have to use it to make contact .	St
1.2.3	make sure you remove old and use a quality paste .	Sug
1.2.4	in the shop i work in i use Arctic silver a very thin coating on the heat sink the size of the chip i all thats needed	St
1.3.1	Well if you want to play I doubt that you can go too far wrong with these folks .	St
1.3.2	http : //www.pcpowercooling.com/ Looks like around 20 bucks .	St
1.3.3	I suspect you will still need the thermal paste .	St
1.4.1	After thought .	St
1.4.2	What happens to cpu temp if you take the fan on the side cover ( input ) and turn it around and make it exhaust ?	Ques
1.4.3	A no cost test .	Res
1.5.1	But does that mean that the thermal paste does n't dry ?	Ques
1.5.2	And one more , what would be a good quality paste ?	Ques
1.6.1	nope stays pasty : ) artic silver is good but when you buy new heat sink most come with either a tube with paste or heat sink has a pad which is the transfer medium	St
1.7.1	What do you think about these pastes ?	Ques
1.7.2	Anyone that you would recommend ?	Ques
1.7.3	And then I would like to know if this is a good choice ...	St
