I recently purchased a new computer and I want to put all my music from the old one to the new one.
I was able to get them on the new computer but they won't play.
Media player says that I do not have the licenses, but it plays them on the old computer.
What do I need to do get it to work on the new computer?
Any help would be appreciated.
