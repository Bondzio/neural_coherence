hi, i just bought an external dvd burner, plextor px-716uf i think it's an external version of the px-716a.
but i didn't read properly before i bought it and it seems this drive doesn't burn on '-r' dl dvds only the '+r' dl disks.
i'm thinking of returning it because it is my understanding that '-r' even a '-r dl' disk is more friendly with commercial dvd players... like if i burn something on a dl disk i want to make sure it will work at home not just on my computer.
is this correct?
if so can anyone suggest a burner i can buy when/if i return the plextor px-716uf?
maybe a better burner with more capabilities?
thanks in advance!
ohh, i have a macintish computer so whatever burner i get has to be mac compatible.
