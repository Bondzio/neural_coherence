my only caveat is that you didn't use a &quot;redundant&quot; power server case.
everything else appears ok, too.
as for the case, that psu will do, but here too you may want to have a spare psu.
now, make darn sure all of this is well cooled, which a server case would have provided and have amble room as well.
just check out server cases to get a feel of what i'm suggesting here.
i do like 100% you use a true server mtrbd.. tada -----willy
