<s> Does anyone know if there is a better solution? </s>
<s> Yes, I HATE wires! </s>
<s> :)And I want to be hooked up to my computer AND printer, anywhere in my house. </s>

<s> Thanks for the link. </s>
<s> I purchased a Linksys Print Server recommended to me at Best Buy. </s>
<s> After hours on the phone with Linksys, they tell me that contrary to what Best Buy told me, I cannot use the Print Server on a Multi Function Printer. </s>
<s> Even if they could help me get it working, to use their product, they tell me I'd have to plug and unplug the print server when I want to use anything other than the printer. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, these fancy-dancy multifunction printers cannot be attached to a print server and still retain any functions except plain ol' printing. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> If you want those extra functions, they only work when the device is connected directly to a host computer. </s>

<s> Unfortunately, the only solution that I can think of would be to buy the later model HP PSC multifunction printer which has a wireless card and would allow me to print remotely. </s>
<s> But since my current printer isn;t that old and I love it, I can't see spending $359 for the later model. </s>
<s> Thanks all who wrote here. </s>
<s> is reported to have lots of problems. </s>
<s> Perhaps they are getting better, but still not ready for prime time. </s>
<s> That said, if you have a network and use different machines in various places around the house, printers on a server sure is a good idea. </s>
<s> You don't have to leave the host machine on just to use the printer. </s>
<s> You don't need a printer for every machine. </s>
<s> In your case, perhaps you might leave the multifunction printer hooked up to a host computer for those times when you need all its features or capacity, but get a small quick printer that can sit out there somewhere on a print server for just when its needed. </s>

<s> Emabarassing to say - I have no network, just one laptop, this is for home, and I just wanted the convienience of being anywhere and hitting print . </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I can stop obsessing on this and now start trying to figure out why Windows Taks Manager says I have 60 processes running! </s>
<s> (I think a higher priority problem:)) </s>
