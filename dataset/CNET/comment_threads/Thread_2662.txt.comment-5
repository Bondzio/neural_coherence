Hi Bob, Well, I tried the online virus/worm scan, and my system came up clean.
I also ran chkdsk a few more times, and although it runs and supposedly fixes the errors (although there's no indication from chkdsk that the errors were indeed repaired), the errors remain to varying degrees--each time I check for errors using Norton Utilities, the &quot;Deleting index entry&quot; line changes.
I even went so far as to install Spybot Search & Destroy, thinking it might be spyware or adware screwing things up, and that didn't work either.
&lt;sigh&gt;.
I guess I'll live with it for now.
I appreciate your suggestions, though, and I would welcome any others you might have THANKS AGAIN!
Scott
