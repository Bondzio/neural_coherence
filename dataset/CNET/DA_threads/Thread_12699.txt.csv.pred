1.1.1	Hi , I 'm hoping someone can please get me out of a very frustrating situation !	St
1.1.2	I have an iMac G3 500 Mhz , which I recently upgraded from OS 9.1 to 10.3 and then to 10.3.9 , then installed OS 9.2.2 running in Classic .	St
1.1.3	All running fine .	St
1.1.4	I had earlier bought a ( sound ) 2nd hand Lacie CDRW ( & gt ; 18 mnths old , USB and FW ) but it will only READ pre-burned data CD's/play i-Tunes , not WRITE any disc in either of the OS 's .	St
1.1.5	Toast 5.2.2 and 6.0.6 ( with 'Silverkeeper ' ) are on a Lacie software CD ( also formatted to install other progs in Windows PC 's ) but Toast wo n't show up/load/install anywhere and it did n't do so before I upgraded to 10.3 .	St
1.1.6	I 've not tried FireWire , just USB , because I do n't have a 6 pin-to-6 pin FW cable .	St
1.1.7	The Lacie CDRW , incidentally , has Lite-On innards and I 've seen this mentioned elsewhere as a possible prob .	St
1.1.8	area ) .	St
1.1.9	I bought it because my iMac 's slot-loading Matshita CDRW was becoming unreliable and could n't do burns or sometimes even read pre-burned CD 's .	St
1.1.10	OS 9.2.2 firmware is fully updated ( if that makes any difference ) .	St
1.1.11	Disk Utility shows only Lacie CDRW but no blank media .	St
1.1.12	OS X System Profiler does n't show it either ! !	St
1.1.13	I 've tried Lacie/Roxio websites but ca n't get anywhere .	St
1.1.14	I do n't want to buy an updated/new Toast version in case that solves nothing .	St
1.1.15	Is the Lacie software CD corrupted ? ?	Ques
1.1.16	I 've checked in Disk Utility but any blank CD I install in the CDRW simply shows as read-only .	St
1.1.17	The main reason I bought CDRW rather than DVD/RW is because it was to be a temporary solution to upgrading to 10.3 from 9.1 .	St
1.1.18	Thanks in advance to anyone who can help solve this .	St
1.2.1	I have a LaCie CDRW with Lite on innards and have had no problem with it at all .	St
1.2.2	I connect mine using Firewire and I suggest that you do the same .	St
1.2.3	FIrewire is the connection of choice for the Mac .	St
1.2.4	When you say that Toast 5.2.2 will not & quot ; show up anywhere & quot ; , what do you mean ?	Ques
1.2.5	Does the CD mount on the desktop ?	Ques
1.2.6	Can you find the Toast installer ?	Ques
1.2.7	According to the Roxio website , 5.1 and above is required for 10.3 so you should have no problem there .	St
1.2.8	What happens when you put the CD in your iMac ?	Ques
1.2.9	You should see the CDRW in the System Profiler .	St
1.2.10	It should be reported in the USB section and give you the manufacturer and its type .	St
1.2.11	If I understand you correctly , this device has never functioned as a CDRW , either in OS 9 or OS X .	St
1.2.12	If this device is working correctly , when you insert a blank CD-R , the system should ask you what it is that you want to do .	St
1.2.13	Get a firewire cable and go from there , but I would be concerned that this thing has never worked .	St
1.2.14	P	St
1.3.1	Hi , Since I 've had this ( 3 weeks , 2nd hand ) , it has only read pre-burned CD 's and any blank media inserted will not show on the desktop or in Disk Utility and burning is therefore not enabled .	St
1.3.2	The Lite-On CDRW shows up in left window of Disk Utility .	St
1.3.3	When I insert the Lacie Toast CD , it never shows anywhere - the device makes no sound , flashing light stops and it just sits there , doing nothing !	St
1.3.4	System Profiler shows nothing - just the i-Mac 's Matshita slot-load internal CDRW .	St
1.3.5	Toast can not be found anywhere on my system , simply because it 's never been able to download from this Lacie Toast CD from the start .	St
1.3.6	Last night I tried that CD in the Matshita internal but it just 'whirred ' and would n't open , then ejected it on each attempt ( that 's part of the original problem that led to me buying an external ) .	St
1.3.7	I do n't have a 6 pin to 6 pin FireWire cable ( this CDRW needs that ) and did n't get one in case that solved nothing .	St
1.3.8	I 'm checking the CDRW on a friend 's PC today ( unfortunately not a Mac ) to make sure it 's working fully and I 'll post the result here .	St
1.3.9	All I have at the moment is read-only capabilities .	St
1.3.10	Thanks for your advice - any further thoughts would be very appreciated .	Polite
1.4.1	I 've had this CDRW working today , using USB , on a PC/Windows XP Pro , burnt a CD from Photoshop and had no problems .	St
1.4.2	My OS 10.3 does n't see it as anything other than 'READ ONLY ' .	St
1.4.3	Interestingly , the Lacie install CD ( which has burn progs for Windows on it too ) was n't recognised in Windows , it did n't open , just as it does n't on my Mac ( ie , for installing Toast 5.2.2/6.0.6 ) .	St
1.4.4	This Lacie CD is totally dead .	St
1.4.5	Would getting another Toast CD of this or a later version sort out the problem on my Mac ?	Ques
1.4.6	Lite-On model no .	Res
1.4.7	SOHR 5238S USB + FW Cheers	St
1.5.1	There 's a recurring theme about this if you research it .	St
1.5.2	The last cable I got was only 2 or 3 bucks from geeks.com .	St
1.5.3	If you have a fry 's they may have it or newegg.com Bob	St
1.6.1	Hi , Thanks .	St
1.6.2	The Lacie software CD which came with the CDRW just does n't work on any machine , I now see .	St
1.6.3	My only Fire Wire cable is 4 pin to 6 pin and this CDRW comes with a 6 pin socket , so I 'd need 6 to 6 pin .	St
1.6.4	I 'll try to get a cable that 'll fit ( not that cheap over here in the UK ) but as the CD appears to be useless I 'm not sure if that 's the solution .	St
1.6.5	A new Toast CD may solve the issue ... . ?	Ques
1.6.6	I 'm beginning to think that this SOHR 5238S model is better suited to PC 's - I checked xlr8yourmac.com and it looks that way to me .	St
1.6.7	Patchburn does n't resolve the issue either .	St
1.7.1	Did I mention , Firewire .	St
1.7.2	OK , I went back and reread your original post .	St
1.7.3	I will accept that your Roxio CD , the one with Toast on it , is defective .	St
1.7.4	Your Mac is an older G3 iMac and does not have USB 2.0 ports on it , only USB1 .	St
1.7.5	This really is not fast enough to be burning CD 's with , especially if the burner can burn at a decent speed .	St
1.7.6	There is also the possibility that the Lite-On USB interface is not backwards compatible with USB1 and is therefore not recognised , as a burner , by your Mac .	St
1.7.7	This device will almost certainly work if you purchase a Firewire cable for it .	St
1.7.8	Again , Firewire is the connection of choice with a Mac .	St
1.7.9	If you purchased the device from someone who told you it was working with a Mac , then they almost certainly had it connected with a firewire cable .	St
1.7.10	Please , no waffle about Firewire cables being expensive in the UK .	St
1.7.11	Check this out http : //www.amazon.co.uk/Firewire-Cable-IEEE-1394-1-8M/dp/B000747OIA/ref=pd_sbs_ce_6/026-7118960-6313251 and tell me if you consider ONE PENNY to be expensive .	St
1.7.12	Check out the online stores for other pricing .	St
1.7.13	P	St
1.8.1	In the USB section of System Profiler of 10.3 , it states LaCie d2 Drive USB2 : Manufacturer :	St
1.9.1	Connect with firewire and retest .	St
1.9.2	I can only guess you have n't seen this firewire issue before .	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	Up to 12 Mb/sec	St
1.11.1	Thanks for your advice .	Polite
1.11.2	I 'm getting a new Toast 6 Lite CD and a 6/6 pin FW cable to see if that does the job .	St
1.11.3	To be honest , having never found problems with USB before , I thought it was USB2 , had n't heard about USB1 until more recently ... ..learning curve !	St
1.11.4	I 've only ever used FW for downloading video from a camcorder , with no probs .	St
1.11.5	When I have the 6/6 FireWire cable and CD , I 'll post my results .	St
1.11.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.12.1	I have the FireWire cable and I 've bought a new , unused/sealed Toast 6 Lite CD but this does n't seem to want to install - there is no instruction window opening to do the install .	St
1.12.2	PDF instructions do weird things too .	St
1.12.3	I do n't get the Toast folder on the desktop but the disk shows - when I copy the folders/contents from there to Applications nothing happens when I double click that .	St
1.12.4	10.2 and upwards is printed on the disk .	St
1.12.5	Disk Utility sees the CD and Lacie burner .	St
1.12.6	Is there a conflict here with the built-in Matshita CDRW ?	Ques
1.12.7	This is getting more and more frustrating .	St
1.13.1	but let 's rule if out anyway .	St
1.13.2	Before we do that , let 's try something , just for fits , grins and giggles .	St
1.13.3	Go to the System Preferences Pane and open the CD & DVD pane .	St
1.13.4	In the section that says & quot ; When I insert a blank CD & quot ; choose & quot ; ask me what to do & quot ; .	St
1.13.5	Close the System Prefs .	St
1.13.6	Reboot the Mac with the Firewire cable connected to both the Mac and the LaCie .	St
1.13.7	One rebooted , insert a Blank CD-R into the LaCie .	St
1.13.8	When the System asks you what you want to do , choose Finder .	St
1.13.9	Did the System ask what you wanted to do ?	Ques
1.13.10	Did the blank CD-R appear on the desktop ?	Ques
1.13.11	If the answer to both is NO , move on to the next section .	St
1.13.12	You may have a corrupt OS , which can be fixed .	St
1.13.13	Disconnect the Firewire cable from the Mac .	St
1.13.14	Now the only things you have running will be the hardware that came with the Mac .	St
1.13.15	( built-in ) .	St
1.13.16	Reboot the Mac .	St
1.13.17	Insert the Toast CD after the Mac is booted .	St
1.13.18	It should mount on the Desktop .	St
1.13.19	Double click the disk to open it .	St
1.13.20	You should have a few icons that may , or may not , say & quot ; Drag to the applications folder & quot ; .	St
1.13.21	Do so .	St
1.13.22	Did the Finder give any indication that it was moving items from the CD to the Applications folder ?	Ques
1.13.23	If it did , go to the Applications folder and find the Toast folder .	St
1.13.24	Open it .	St
1.13.25	It should have the application inside it .	St
1.13.26	Double click it .	St
1.13.27	What happened ?	Ques
1.13.28	I do n't think that the Toast app has an actual installation program , at least not on the CD , it is just a drag and drop into the Applications folder installer .	St
1.13.29	Once you double click the actual program in the Applications folder , Toast sets a few things up , asks for a number and installs whatever extra comes with it .	St
1.13.30	Define & quot ; weird things & quot ; in regards to the PDF instructions P	St
1.14.1	Thanks .	Polite
1.14.2	I 've followed your directions except for the one which involves removing FW cable and then inserting Toast .	St
1.14.3	This is because my internal Matshita CDRW would be the only way of inserting CD and it 's simply unreliable - Toast CD , like others , wo n't open in it ( my reason for getting an external CDRW ) .	St
1.14.4	Blank CD 's do n't show on desktop using Lacie CDRW .	St
1.14.5	'Weird ' PDF behaviour earlier involved 'broken ' fonts/text , scattered around page , pages missing ( which were there before ) and freezing screen .	St
1.14.6	I have n't yet seen the command which asks me for the Toast key code and the sealed envelope Toast came in has n't got a 17 digit code , as Roxio state it should be - it 's P/N 210100UN Rev D v6.0.9 .	St
1.14.7	The disk has an 18 digit code underneath , around its centre .	St
1.14.8	I bought this from USA eBay dealer who states it to be genuine , authentic , unused , sealed , etc .	St
1.14.9	and will replace if necessary .	St
1.14.10	The Toast disk , when opened , contains a 'toaster ' icon which does not open when double clicked - there 's a short 'flash ' of a small toaster icon but it does nothing else .	St
1.14.11	Other folders are 1 ) Documentation ( PDF instructions , etc ) , 2 ) Upgrade to 7 Titanium which crashes Toast completely if attempts are made to open this and 3 ) Make copies using Popcorn .	St
1.14.12	Earlier , I dragged a copy of the disk to Applications but this did no more than open a window showing the folders .	St
1.14.13	It does not launch or give options .	St
1.14.14	It 's been suggested to me that Toast 6 does n't work with 10.3 and I should use 7 .	St
1.14.15	Maybe 7 would work OK with the Lacie ?	Ques
1.14.16	Is there a problem between the Matshita CDRW and this CD ?	Ques
1.15.1	OK , Now we get down to the nitty gritty .	St
1.15.2	I think you will need to reinstall the OS and try again .	St
1.15.3	Something in there is broken .	St
1.15.4	Using the OS X installation disk for 10.3 , attempt to boot from it and reinstall the OS using the Archive and Install option .	St
1.15.5	You will need to update from 10.3 to 10.9 on completion .	St
1.15.6	Do you have the disks ?	Ques
1.15.7	P	St
1.16.1	Thanks for your further advice - I 've updated to 10.3.9 already but I 'll follow your suggestion and report back .	St
1.16.2	I really do hope this is the solution !	St
1.17.1	When you do the reinstall , choose the ARCHIVE and INSTALL option .	St
1.17.2	If you do not do that , ALL your data will go away .	St
1.17.3	Archive and install will preserve your data and put it back where it belongs on completion of the install .	St
1.17.4	I realize you are already at 10.3.9 , that 's why I said that you would have to update the OS from 10.3 ( which is the OS that is on the Installation disk ) to 10.3.9 Good luck .	St
1.17.5	P	St
1.18.1	UNDERSTOOD , Cheers .	St
1.18.2	I 'd just like to check another issue before I do this , if that 's OK ... .	St
1.18.3	I bought a 9.2 disk before 10.3 and updated to 9.2.2 via Apple so that Classic would function and it 's been fine .	St
1.18.4	I ca n't start up from 9.2.2 independently ( from CD or otherwise ) and copied its System Folder to Desktop as a Volume so that at least it was running in Classic .	St
1.18.5	If I wish to use 9.2.2 independent of 10.3 , would you suggest I partition them separately ? ?	Ques
1.18.6	when I do the re-install of 10.3 ?	Ques
1.18.7	I 'm still rather 'attatched ' to OS 9 in some ways , even though 10.3 is a great 'breath of fresh air ' , excellent for graphics/illustration work ( which I had been doing in 9 before ) .	St
1.18.8	What 's your preferred choice re this , please ?	Ques
1.19.1	Done the 10.3 reinstall ( using the Matshita internal CDRW ) but no change - the Toast icon still does n't open when double-clicked on the CD or if copied onto my system ! !	St
1.19.2	It showed as an Application icon ( folder with 'A ' motif ) when I tried to open it but has since reverted back to the Toaster icon after another attempt to open .	St
1.19.3	Dodgy CD ?	Ques
1.19.4	There is no command requesting me to register/input key code , etc .	St
1.19.5	Really do n't know what 's going on here .	St
1.19.6	I bought this new disk from a guy in the USA ( Power Seller ) on eBay and I 've written to him about it .	St
1.19.7	It all started with the Lacie D2 ... ..	St
1.20.1	Or even a PC .	St
1.20.2	Why ?	Ques
1.20.3	To test out if the Lacie is working proper .	St
1.20.4	Did we do this ?	Ques
1.20.5	Bob	St
1.21.1	It appears to work correctly when attached to a USB 2.0 port on the Windows machine .	St
1.21.2	P	St
1.22.1	There is no need to partition the hard drive so that you can run Classic .	St
1.22.2	System 9 ( known as Classic when it is running at the same time as OS X ) lives on the same drive as OS X and does NOT need to be copied anywhere for it to work .	St
1.22.3	If you wish to use OS 9.2.2 independently of OS X , then just set the startup disk to System 9 and reboot .	St
1.22.4	To go back to OS X , set the startup control panel back to OS X. Dragging the System Folder onto the desktop does not create a Volume , it is just another folder on the desktop .	St
1.22.5	P	St
1.23.1	The purpose behind the Archive and Install was to rule out the possibility that the OS was corrupt .	St
1.23.2	If all went well , and the install was successful , the next thing to do would be to & quot ; Repair Persmissions & quot ; After that , the next step would be to insert a blank CD-R into the insternal CDRW drive and see what happens .	St
1.23.3	Moving along , do the same with the Firewire connected LaCie drive .	St
1.23.4	After you have dragged Toast to the application folder and double click it , do you get any form of bouncing icon in the dock , no matter how briefly ?	Ques
1.23.5	On the subject of System 9 .	St
1.23.6	What is it that you still need to do in that system that you can not do in OS X ?	Ques
1.23.7	P	St
1.24.1	Since install via Archive/Install , HD has reduced space by 4.5 GB .	St
1.24.2	Sysytem Profiler states OS 10.3 on Partition 3 , OS 9.2 on Part 2 , but I did n't set any partitions .	St
1.24.3	Safari 1.3.2 wo n't work - is still set as default browser but now I ca n't use the tool bar , type in text or access File , Edit , etc commands , use Apple menu when safari open , etc .	St
1.24.4	I 'm using IE 5.2 to send this mssge .	St
1.24.5	Did Repair Permissions on X and all fine .	St
1.24.6	Blank CD in Matshita internal CDRW is spat out - wo n't work and in Disk utility using Lacie external , CD does n't show on desktop or in Disk Util .	St
1.24.7	Bouncing Toast icon in dock - keeps bouncing but nothing opens !	St
1.24.8	!	St
1.25.1	have you updated this system to 10.3.9 yet ?	Ques
1.25.2	How big is the drive ?	Ques
1.25.3	How many Partitions are on it ?	Ques
1.25.4	Why ?	Ques
1.25.5	If 10.3 is on Partition 3 , OS 9.2 on Partition 2 , what is on Partition 1 Your HD will have decreased in size because you now have a Previous Systems folder on it .	St
1.25.6	This contains the old OS that could have been corrupted .	St
1.25.7	I 'm not sure I follow the Disk Utility thing every time you speak of the LaCie .	St
1.25.8	What purpose is the Disk Utility supposed to serve ?	Ques
1.25.9	Does a disk , any disk , appear on the desktop when it is inserted into the LaCie burner ?	Ques
1.25.10	The bouncing icon in the dock usually indicates that something is wrong with the permissions .	St
1.25.11	P	St
1.26.1	Hard drive 40GB ( non-Mac - WDC type ) and I did n't partition it but it may have been partitioned originally by previous owner .	St
1.26.2	It was given to me to increase from the original 20GB HD my i-Mac had .	St
1.26.3	Toast CD worked on a friend 's 10.3 e-Mac today - no problem but I 'm now going to do a clean install of 10.3 as I 've backed up all data on an external HD .	St
1.26.4	Preview was crashing on the Archive/Install I did 2 days ago .	St
1.26.5	Only music CD 's and pre-written data disks show on the computer when using the Lacie .	St
1.26.6	I was using Disk utility to see if there was any sign of blank CD 's I 'd inserted in Lacie but not so .	St
1.26.7	Thanks for your advice so far - I 'll post once I 've reinstalled and see what happens with Lacie , Toast , etc .	St
1.27.1	At the risk of taking over this forum , I 'll let you know what I did next and what 's happened ... . Decided to zero all data on 40GB HD , full re-install of 10.3 ( 3 disks ) , choosing option for OS 9 drivers [ OS 9 not reinstalled on HD , therefore no Classic ] .	St
1.27.2	Updated to 10.3.9 via Apple ... ..	St
1.27.3	Preview does n't read Toast Lite CD 's PDF manual - broken text has many diagonal/jagged lines running through it , some pages empty .	St
1.27.4	Locks up when I try to open other pages of Toast manual .	St
1.27.5	No change if I drag copy of Toast to HD .	St
1.27.6	Have to force quit Toast/Finder .	St
1.27.7	Toast icon wo n't launch from its window but disk shows on desktop/Disk Utility ( using the Lacie ) .	St
1.27.8	Disk Util - 1 Toast volume failed verification - & quot ; invalid key length & quot ; ( ? ?	Ques
1.27.9	ref to the Roxio key code ? ? ? )	Ques
1.27.10	& quot ; needs to be repaired & quot ; .	St
1.27.11	X-Tools CD - Developer pkg launches then crashes immediately , whereas it opened before 10.3 re-install , installing all but two packages .	St
1.27.12	PDF 's ( in Preview ) are empty except for a couple of lines of text .	St
1.27.13	USELESS .	St
1.27.14	Patchburn downloaded but does n't support my Lacie/LiteOn CDRW .	St
1.27.15	I consider buying the Lacie a really bad mistake , getting Toast too ... . Roxio Support gives no clues but I 've been told that Toast 7 works with 10.3 , whereas 6 apparently does n't .	St
1.27.16	Before I did the zero data , Toast CD launched on a friends eMac 10.3 .	St
1.27.17	I do n't have any other 10.3 compatible CD 's to open in Preview in order to check if there 's a fault there .	St
1.27.18	Disk Util finds no problems with HD .	St
1.27.19	Any suggestions as to what 's happening/what to do next would be greatly appreciated !	St
1.28.1	The Lacie D2 has now worked , erased CD disks , burned data , etc via the Toast 6 Lite Disk which has also done what it 's supposed to ... .	St
1.28.2	I decided to try the Lacie with the USB again , not the FireWire cable and suddenly everything began to show up .	St
1.28.3	Could n't believe it .	St
1.28.4	Is it possible that there was a conflict with Classic ( not now installed ) or was FireWire 'too fast ' for it all ?	Ques
1.28.5	Even the Lacie CD which came with the CDRW has opened Toast on my Mac but it would n't do anything before I zeroed HD/reinstalled 10.3 and updated to 10.3.9 .	St
1.28.6	Apart from the odd freeze where Toast only launched after a restart , it 's perfect .	St
1.28.7	Thanks for the advice given .	St
1.29.1	What a journey .	St
1.29.2	I do n't know why this one was so tough to solve .	St
1.29.3	I usually give the nod to the usual items but in your situation it did n't pan out .	St
1.29.4	I can only think of what Marvin the Martian had to say about computers when this happens .	St
1.29.5	Bob	St
1.30.1	I ca n't even begin to speculate as to what the problem was .	St
1.30.2	It seems unlikely that there would be a conflict , of some sort , with Classic as your device should work under OS 9 as well as OS X .	St
1.30.3	It & quot ; might & quot ; be interesting to see if the Firewire connection now works also , but , it may also be better to let sleeping dogs lie .	St
1.30.4	Glad you have a working burner at last , Merry Christmas .	St
1.30.5	P	St
1.31.1	Yes , it 's been quite a journey but I 'm far more aware of how it all works now - took my iMac a little for granted ( it had worked so well ) until this happened .	St
1.31.2	I may try the FireWire to see what happens ...	St
1.31.3	Thanks for the various bits of advice and Best Wishes for 2007 to all of you - good to know there are people who share their knowledge/expertise so readily .	St
1.31.4	Hopefully I can offer some help of my own to someone at some point .	St
1.32.1	How did you install OS 10.3.9 ?	Ques
1.32.2	When I tried to install it on my 350mhz iMac G3 it said this upgrade is not available on this computer or something like that .	St
