I usually recommend besides the beforehand advise, to remove the side cover of the system.
Then if it settles down, you have a heat issue.
Understand any componet besides the cpu could be heat stressed and cause a reboot.
The psu is prone to such and if the cpu reaches a certain hi-temp(bios setting) it's response is to reboot or shutdown, and/or go into alarm(if on).
Weak ram if pushed too much or failing itself can also cause a reboot or lock-up.
Try all this and get back to us.
