1.1.1	Hey , i have bought used Ati Radeon x1900xt .	St
1.1.2	It is in very good condition , it works but when I run gpu intensive tasks such as gaming , or gpu decoding , PC freezes .	St
1.1.3	I thought that it was power problem , as this gpu needs 1x6 pin pci ex connector .	St
1.1.4	I have a Cooler Master Elite Power 460w which has a one pci ex conn. And it works , but as soon as I run the gpu to full capacity , it will freeze .	St
1.1.5	Do you have a solution for this ?	Ques
1.1.6	Cheers , Fema .	St
1.2.1	That used to be a cutting card from over 5 years ago .	St
1.2.2	But at this age it 's uncertain if it 's a good card .	St
1.2.3	The solution is likely to be a new card .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	If this was my card , I 'd get it out and do a few things .	St
1.3.2	1 .	St
1.3.3	Inspect the card for BAD CAPS ( see that on google ) 2 .	St
1.3.4	Pull the heatsink and replace the heatsink compound .	St
1.3.5	3 .	St
1.3.6	Clean the card of all dust and check the fan after I reinstall it .	St
1.3.7	4 .	St
1.3.8	Leave the case cover off the PC and point a fan at the open PC to see if this is heat related .	St
1.3.9	5 .	St
1.3.10	I did n't write about drivers .	St
1.3.11	But check the usual forums to see if folk have a favorite version .	Sug
1.4.1	She lays over here in the closet , so I wanted to see if it could be repaired or something .	St
1.4.2	As Proffitt said , I have done that already , so it is good looking at caps and all that .	St
1.4.3	Replaced thermal compound with Artic Silver 5 .	St
1.4.4	And it 's not heat related , because as soon as I open a game , she freezes .	St
1.4.5	I have a one more card laying here , and that is a HD 4850 , that wo n't show any video .	St
1.4.6	I do n't know what is wrong there either .	St
1.5.1	Link : http : //www.coolermaster.com/product.php ? product_id=6615 I see this has dual 18A 12V supplies .	St
1.5.2	But without knowing the age I 'm going to cut the amperage in half ( 5 year old supply on average does that ) and see if 9 Amperes is enough for either card .	St
1.5.3	That 1900XT called for & quot ; 30 Amps on 12 volt rail recommended & quot ; so even in it 's prime that PSU did n't meet the spec .	St
1.5.4	The 4850 seems to call for 242 Watts or 20+ Amperes so again this PSU missed the mark by miles .	St
1.5.5	Has anyone chatted with you about the need to never go near the limits of a PSU ?	Ques
1.5.6	Why I ask is some PSUs will fail in a catastrophic manner and wipe out anything connected .	St
1.5.7	Bob	St
1.6.1	So I run gtx 275 off it , and it runs great , blasting cool air outside .	St
1.6.2	But I have been searching for solution and I stumped across one post , that says I should bake my card in oven .	St
1.6.3	What do you think about it ?	Ques
1.7.1	I showed that these cards take so many Amperes and even new , http : //www.coolermaster.com/product.php ? product_id=6615 has only 18A on any rail .	St
1.7.2	It appears you are about to learn why many here will write about single rail supplies .	St
1.7.3	If that new PSU had been a single 36A rail rather than a pair of 18A then we may have never had this discussion .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
