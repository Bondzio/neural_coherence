I moved the motherboard of a HP pavilion system from the HP case to a standard ATX case to allow for a larger power supply and better vid card. I had been running it open case with the switch from the old computer becuase I couldnt figure out the plug for the case. Stupid right? Well now, I turned it off last night, and it wont turn on again. I plug it in everything starts humming and moving EVEN IF THE POWER SWITCH ISNT CONNECTED! Am I going to need a new motherboard, and wth happened to her overnight.

The power-ON switch is only a simple contact, find the wire harness that connects to pins that need only connect for a split moment to start system, use a simple split wiring strip to expose and touch the required pins. Check results. If system starts, then you had a short on the backside on some mtrbd. against metal. Some psus aren't really all that good if you brought the cheapest available, even with a higher wattage rating. Too many come with impressive specs but are too good to be true for a real demanding system, so be sure to buy a decent brandname and they're more expensive for sure.
