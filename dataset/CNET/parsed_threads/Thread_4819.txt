<s> I am wondering if that card is compatible because the HD 4870 is made by a different company. </s>
<s> This is why PCI, PCIe and such slots were invented. </s>
<s> So we could install cards compatible with the card slot. </s>
<s> Does your machine have that needed card slot? </s>
<s> Yes my machine has one occupied pci-e slot from which I will remove my old card. </s>
<s> The HD 4870 stats say that it is PCI-e 2.0 Is that something new? </s>
<s> If you look into it, there is no issue here except the usuals. </s>
<s> Such as does your machine have the proper sized power supply, does the card fit mechanically, etc. </s>
<s> I am purchasing a new power supply (600w) which uses the proper connections for the card. </s>
<s> I am not sure about the mechanical fit. </s>
