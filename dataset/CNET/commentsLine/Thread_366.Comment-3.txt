if you have vista and put a higher-end video card in your system 3gb of ram may be useful.
vista handles ram differently.
for example, you upgrade to a 256mb dedicated ram video card.
vista will use up to 1023mb of total system ram for graphics(including the card's 256mb).
so the rest of your system will have up to 768mb less ram for other things excluding graphics.
with ddr2 prices dropping why not?
i put in an extra gb for like $50.00
