my experience is better than the above.
however let me comment i run into machines with missing motherboard drivers as well as malware or the new plague called &quot;registry cleaners&quot; and in the worst case scenario we get to reinstall the os then the drivers but these scanners always start working (except that one that didn't work on any machine.)
