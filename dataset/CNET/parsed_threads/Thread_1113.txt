<s> My 12 yr old has JIA and, since it hurts her hands to try to write all day, I'm trying to find a tablet / laptop that she can carry around all day and use to take her class notes. </s>
<s> It has to be lightweight and if it's a tablet, needs to run an office program that's compatible with a PC office suite. </s>
<s> Her school has PC's and she'll need to turn in written assignments in the doc format. </s>
<s> A netbook would work, but every netbook I've seen hasn't looked sturdy enough hold up to being carried around all day by a 12 year old. </s>
<s> Any suggestions or starting points are welcome! </s>
<s> You said it must run Windows apps and not Pages or a compatible word processor. </s>
<s> This means that for now you'll be looking at Windows 7 Pads. </s>
<s> Here's a few. </s>
