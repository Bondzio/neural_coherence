all routers pretty much have to run nat.
you only have a single real ip address.
you may or may not have multiple machines that need to share this address.
nat is the method used to share the address between machines.
this sharing is the key to why being stupid protects you much like a firewall.
think of nat as what happens if you order something and ups ship it to a large company but don't put the name of the person.
all the people share the same address.
if the mailroom had a list of packages each person was expecting they could deliver it.
if the package was not on the list they don't know who to deliver it to.
so if some bad person sends you a ups package it gets stuck in the mail room.
nat work like that it build a list dynamically of packets to accept.
the devices that do not run nat are called bridges in most cases.... very technically even a router does not always nat but this happens in commercial setting where you have multiple ip assigned to you.
