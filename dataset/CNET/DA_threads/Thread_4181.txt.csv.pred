1.4.1	B .	St
1.4.2	By setting your FSB to 133 it should allow you to recycle your ram .	Sug
1.4.3	And as always your CPU must be on the motherboard 's CPU support list .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	It is supported .	St
1.5.2	XP 2800+ 333 is supported and even 3000+ 333 is .	St
1.5.3	And if I set the board to 5:1 I can use 133 ran and 333 cpu .	St
1.5.4	Or I can set both cpu and ram to 133 .	St
1.5.5	I just do n't want to buy new ram since I already have 1gb .	St
