<s> Hi, I'm having a problem that I would appreciate some help with. </s>
<s> I'm trying to connect to a router that i didnt set up. </s>
<s> Its a vigor2820 I have the ip address (192.168.0.1). </s>
<s> I have confirmed this as the default gateway by running ipconfig/all from the command prompt. </s>
<s> It pings fine. </s>
<s> However, when i type the ip address into my browser it pauses for a while but doesn't load the login screen. </s>
<s> It just searches for a while and comes up with nothing. </s>
<s> I know I am typing the ip address in correctly as i am connecting to other routers fine. </s>
<s> I believe I am on the same subnet also. </s>
<s> As a disclaimer I am bit of a noob so apologies in advance if this is a common issue to which solutions are widely available. </s>
<s> Thanks Jon </s>
<s> It's possible the setup page is not at 192.168.0.1:80 (notice that 80?) </s>
<s> Some folk change the setup page to be at a different port. </s>
<s> Some change it so you can't set it up via WiFi. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> I reset the router to it's factory defaults then start over. </s>
