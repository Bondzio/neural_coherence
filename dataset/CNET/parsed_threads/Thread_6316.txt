<s> Believing that the sector map is used by the operating system to determine where (track & sector) to put a block of data I would suspect that RAID-1 should be able to be moved as the controller was &quot;just&quot; writing each block to two disks at the same time. </s>
<s> Putting either disk in a new system and recreating the mirror should be straight forward. </s>
<s> When it comes to RAID-0 the game gets complicated as there are 'stripe width&quot; issues as well as track & sector assignments to be considered. </s>
<s> Is there standardization among implementations? </s>
<s> Will a 250G 2 disk RAID-0 array from an Intel mobo be readable in an AMD system? </s>
<s> (I'm looking for some lost legal document images on dead systems with on board PATA RAID controllers). </s>
<s> Almost any ON BOARD RAID is a crap shot if the drives will transplant. </s>
<s> In fact it rarely works making a fine business for those in the recovery business. </s>
<s> Given what's at stake, why didn't they make a backup? </s>
<s> Or were they lulled into believing by someone that RAID 1 was a backup? </s>
<s> And I see a mention of RAID 0. </s>
<s> With those I have yet to see but a few transplants over the years. </s>

<s> from 1 computer to another but the likelihood of it working properly so that you can access and read the data.....slim and none. </s>
<s> Is it possible there's a PC with the exact same hardware configuration you could try it in ? </s>

<s> I can't speak for RAID 0 but with RAID 1 it should be easy enough to create an image of the set and restore it to the set once moved. </s>
<s> I've only done this once but had no trouble doing so. </s>
<s> Eventually I moved away from RAID and re-worked my backup plan. </s>
<s> I've had RAID sets break a time or two with or without there being an actually hardware failure. </s>
<s> The reality is that rebuilding these arrays once broken is far more time consuming than using other backup/restore methods. </s>
<s> Another issue is that, if one drive breaks, you're better off buying another pair than trying to find and replace a failed drive. </s>
<s> Newer drives also have some wonderful features that cause them to &quot;recalibrate&quot; themselves and can break your RAID set. </s>
<s> You need to shop for drives designed for RAID use and they'll cost you more. </s>
<s> My opinion is that it's no longer worth the effort. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Thanks to all who posted so promptly. </s>
<s> As I feared a RAID-0 is a &quot;one-off&quot; animal with no similarities to any other array EXCEPT one built by the same RAID Controller chip or board. </s>
<s> It is so true that one broken drive too soon becomes one of a set of broken drives; so best practice is to rebuild onto new hardware. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip about &quot;self-calibrating&quot; drives that become &quot;self-breaking&quot; arrays ... </s>
<s> I didn't see that one coming (better is in the eye of the beholder). </s>
