...got the money, the time and plenty of aspirin...go for it .
it might work and then again it might not.
or it might work initially, but later become unstable and fail.
the thing you cannot tell from the cpu configuration information sited is about the rest of the system configuration .... esp wattage of the power supplys provided with the units... i indicated that previously and it's also been mentioned by others since.
systems with higher performance cpus especially the last generation of cpus require more wattage.
while the cpu may work initially, chances are the system...especially an older one may become unstable and ultimately fail.
let us know what you decide and how it turns out.
