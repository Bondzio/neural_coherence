I'm new to the forums, but have posted two questions in the past and received some excellent (and I might add, ever so grateful) advice-help. Well it seems I'm in need of advice once again. I need to purchase a video card, but my head is spinning from a weird mass of terminology! I do know and understand that it must be AGP. Now my motherboard manual (ASUS P3B-F) states that &quot;AGP bus frequencies above 66MHz exceed the specifications for the AGP interface and are not guaranteed to be stable&quot; I only need a basic, low cost card. So the one I'm looking into is as follows. Would this be a compatible card? Pine SiS 315E Video Card / 32MB / AGP 4X Performance GPU/VPU SiS 315E RAMDAC 375 MHz Maximum Resolution Learn More 2048 x 1536 @ 85Hz Memory Video Memory 32MB Memory Type SDRAM Core Clock 166 MHz Memory Clock 143 MHz Memory Bandwidth 2.7GB/sec.
