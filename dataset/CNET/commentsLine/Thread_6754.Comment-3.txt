can you tell me how to do the things you said in your post for me to do?
i can tell you that when wireless connection goes out that the laptop is in the same room with the wireless router.
i know the router is not the problem as i do not lose my connection with my desktop just my laptop.
i have also spoken with linksys about this and they said if it was the router that the desktop would also lose its connection.
thanks again for trying to help me with this.
the downside to getting a new laptop is having to have vista.
