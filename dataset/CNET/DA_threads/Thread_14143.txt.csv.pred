1.1.1	I'm going to be moving into an apartment in a month or so, which gives me about that much time to decide on some networking solutions.	St
1.1.2	I'm a fairly knowledgable computer science student so feel free to speak on whatever level you'd like.	St
1.1.3	I need to choose a wireless router, with a minimum of the 802.11n standard, as if you can find many without it.	St
1.1.4	I'd prefer n300 or faster.	St
1.1.5	I'd like this router with a usb port, and preferably gigabit ethernet ports.	St
1.1.6	I was wondering whether it would be worth it to splurge on a nicer router for the future of a possibly larger house, possibly even equipped to handle 802.11ac, or whether I should stick with a lower end router.	St
1.1.7	I don't currently own any -ac equipped devices but I'm sure I will in the future.	St
1.1.8	Either way you choose, any specific router recommendations would be lovely.	St
1.1.9	I'd like not to break the bank either.	St
1.1.10	I just want quality hardware.	St
1.1.11	Oh, and most of the devices I run are Apple, but I don't need an apple router unless that's legitimately what you recommend.	St
1.1.12	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	When my old router started giving me problems.	St
1.2.2	I bought a Netgear R6200 which is a AC router even though I don't have any AC devices right now.	St
1.2.3	Am sure I will have later on.	St
1.2.4	The 6200 does have 4 gigabit Ethernet ports as well as a USB port.	St
1.2.5	The range is excellent, better than anything I have ever owned.	St
1.2.6	It streams Netflix to a cheap Samsung wireless Blu-ray player with no buffering and not a flicker from about 60 feet away through 3 walls.	St
1.2.7	I have 2 wired and 4 wireless units on it and when the Grandkids come over add 2 more and it doesn't seem to slow it down a bit.	St
1.2.8	The only knock I have seen on the router is it's size.	St
1.2.9	It is big compared to other routers, 10 inches wide, 8.4 inches high and almost 3 inches deep with stand.	St
1.2.10	It runs very cool so no worry's about over heating like a lot of them I have read about.	St
1.2.11	They are a little pricy, about $150.00 or a little less.	St
