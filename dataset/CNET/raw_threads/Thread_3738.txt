Brand new pc, bought it yesterday from (oh god) PC World, first thing that went wrong, was they gave me a european power cable, when they're a british company, with this building being situated, in none other than britain.. So just been to town today, got my power cords swapped for UK spec, and Ta'Da.. Switch on the pc and i get the following messages flash up [OSD Locked] --- --- --- (short pause) --- --- --- [Power Saving Mode] or the same thing, but saying [OSD Unlocked] ..... Let me just re-state, this is a brand new system, not even connected to the internet yet, and it isn't working.. So please help me so i can get the hell off my mothers crappy notebook
