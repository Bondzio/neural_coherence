Greetings, I bought my 70-year-old mom a MacBook Pro for Christmas 2009 (my sister & I each have one -- and mom wanted one like ours!). Since mom basically uses only facebook, email and a handful of websites, she could have easily survived with just a netbook -- but netbooks are simply too small for an older, limited-vision person who never learned to type! So, she's thrilled with her Mac. The community she lives in provides free WiFi for the residents, so she can sit inside the 'clubhouse' or the clubhouse's patio area and chat away all day. The problem is... when she returns to her home. She receives the clubhouse signal just fine as long as she remains outside on HER patio... but when she goes inside her home... the signal degrades and she cannot stay connected. I realize that she could get cable wired to her home and have perfect internet access, but on a limited budget, she's just not going to do that. And, a single, 70 year old shouldn't be sitting outside by herself at night -- since darkness arrives at about 5 or 6 pm this time of year! The obvious solution is to 'boost' or 'amplify' the clubhouse signal and/or make her Mac more 'receptive' to the signal so it makes it all the way inside her home -- but, what is the best way to do this? I doubt the retirement community she lives in has the latest and greatest technology -- so there's not much to be accomplished from working on that end of the issue -- so, what can I do from her end of the problem to help her connection stay up & running in the evenings? Thanks in advance for help!
