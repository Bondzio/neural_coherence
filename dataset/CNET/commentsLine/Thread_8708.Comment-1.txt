i bought an asus eee 1000 (no h) from craigslist a few days ago.
when i got it only has 7.48 gb on the c: drive and almost all of that is already being used.
i took it to a tech he found a partition under disk management and told me that there is 7 more gigs not being used and created an icon for me under &quot;my computer&quot;.
however moving things over there is not really freeing up much space.
i am running windows xp.
i have done the disk clean up.
nothing... where is all this space being used.
i mean under add/remove programs it's just got the main stuff to run the pc.
no extras at all.
any advice would help.
thanks.
