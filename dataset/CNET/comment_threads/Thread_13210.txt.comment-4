I remember using the computer's name and the find function.
Once the computer I was at found the other computer, I could then do file sharing or whatever I wanted.
Just because the computers don't show up on each other screen doesn't always mean you can't get one computer to find and work with another computer.
I do remember that if one computer didnot find the another computer it was usally caused by the computer being disconnected.
I then rebooted all the computers and then tried again.
