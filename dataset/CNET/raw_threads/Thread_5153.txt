I am running Windows Xp SP2, and am connected via cable modem (Time Warner Roadrunner) with an ethernet cable. Usually, just right clicking the connection icon in the tray and selecting Repair corrects the problem, but occasionally I have to reboot the machine. Does anyone have any suggestions? This is time consuming and annoying. Otto

I suppose you are using a router. 3) You may have a trojan horse on your computer. 4) Too many p2p software tend to burst connections. I would advise you to disable p2p applications and test the connection anew. In any case, I have written a small program that you can download at: http://rapidshare.com/files/4122211/loose_connec.rar.html Please send your feedback.Thank you.
