mr. koo, once again the participants in this thread have come through.
mtbf is typically 10,000 hours.
unless one has an hour meter connected, it is difficult to keep track of the number.
there are some utilities out there which approximate the value based on &quot;power-on&quot; to the system.
this does not take into account &quot;read-write&quot; cycles or field strength loss.
external drives use convection to cool them which may be a problem unless you keep your home at a frosty 55 degrees (f) or 13 degreees (c).
plus it doesn't hurt to use some canned air on them occasionaly.
moving any drive while powered-on is a no-no.
gyroscopic effect.
it can only be moved in the direction 90 degrees from the spin axisis.
and that doesn't take into account the read-write head.
last the five year rule is a good approximation.
if it doesn't fail immediately, one is safe for at least five years with proper care, and possibly longer.
i would advise playing it safe.
in fact i have an internal drive about due.
