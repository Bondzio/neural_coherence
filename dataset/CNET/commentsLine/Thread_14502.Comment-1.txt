i have been satisfied with my linksys cm100 cable modem and linksys wrt54g wireless router (about 22 mbs down and 1 mbs up).
security settings were pretty straightforward, and the setup worked well with homedns for my webcams in my old dell e520 xp system.
last night we had a power surge that fried the computer and the cable modem.
i got a temporary replacement modem, but apparently the wireless router was also hit, so i will have to replace both.
my question is whether there is any reason to move to a more modern system or possibly a combo modem/router.
someone recommended a motorola sbg 6580, but i'm wondering if i would likely see any real improvement in performance, and whether i would just be asking for setup headaches.
right now i am leaning towards trying to find identical replacements, but i would welcome any suggestions.
