<s> I currently own and use 3 separate external hard drives. </s>
<s> At the moment, due to limited desk space they are stacked on top of each other. </s>
<s> These are all pre-bought drives, and I don't want to fiddle with opening them up etc, but I am looking for a &quot;rack&quot; or some kind of storage option to separate them with shelves or something to allow for better cooling. </s>
<s> Ideally, these shelves would have fans in them, similar to a laptop lap cooling device. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of any products like this? </s>
<s> My google searches have failed so far. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Head to the store and buy a small fan. </s>
<s> Set it on the lowest setting and point it at the drives. </s>

<s> ...get metal shelving to help with heat dissipation. </s>
<s> You may find inexpensive solutions at your local office supply stores, Walmart/Target, dollar stores, and large home improvement stores. </s>
<s> I'm thinking of mail/paper slots and desktop organizers. </s>
