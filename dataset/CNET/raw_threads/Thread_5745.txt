He's saying that with his iogear bluetooth adapter he can connect to his basic BG router to get internet. I'm saying this won't work, but he won't belive me. Some how he has gotten it to work before, but I think he was connected to his phone. Can someone help me shead some light on this? If i'm right he has the GBU211 http://www.iogear.com/solutions/networking/?view=110 That one and none of the other adapters have anything to do with wifi. His router is the standard westell wifi router/modem bellsouth gives you for high speed internet.
