1.1.1	My computer has a K7S5A PRO Socket A Main Board.The CPU is an Athlon XP 2000 which I suspect to be defective .	St
1.1.2	The heatsink is held in place by two retentipon clips on either side of the heatsink unit .	St
1.1.3	I ca n't figure how to remove the clips from the socket 462 base so that I can get to the CPU .	St
1.1.4	There must be an easy way to do it , but I ca n't figure how .	St
1.1.5	HELP ! !	St
1.1.6	Thanks , Ray Savage	St

1.3.1	If you look closely one of the clips is & quot ; hinged & quot ; thus it will move away after pushing down on that clip .	St
1.3.2	When free , twist and wingle the heatsink to break free the heatsink itself as the heatsink compounf may have siezed it abit .	Sug
1.3.3	You can now unlock the cpu ZIF handle to remove cpu & quot ; with care & quot ; , denote the ordination should you decide to remove cpu .	St
1.3.4	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite

1.5.2	Your info combined with Bob 's has made this problem simple .	St

1.6.1	I have an AMD athlon chip on my computer and when I took the heat sink of there was no thermal pad but there was thermal grease I cleaned it up and then added more is it bad that I don ; t have a thermal pad ?	Ques
1.7.1	The Thermal paste is just as effective as the thermal tape .	St
1.7.2	I suspect that as the processors got faster and the heat increased , the manufacturers found a quick way of providing heat protection ( Thermal Tape ) , that would not rub off in transit .	St
1.7.3	The Boxed CPUs come with the thermal tape applied so that you do n't forget , however OEM CPUs come naked and you have to buy a fan/sink combo which may or may not come with thermal tape .	St
1.7.4	It is difficult to find thermal tape.If you have to remove the Boxed CPU for any reason , or supply your own fan , a tube of thermal paste/grease is always available at the nearest RadioShack .	St
1.7.5	If you use the Thermal Paste make sure that you apply a thin layer on the Die , rather than let a gob of it get down on the exposed resistors , since some of the paste is made from Zinc metal and may short out your CPU .	St
1.7.6	Remember , all you want to do is fill in any uneven spots on the die and the surface of the heatsink , so that a gas tight fit is achieved between the heatsink and the die .	St
1.7.7	This helps wick away the heat .	St
1.7.8	Norm	St
