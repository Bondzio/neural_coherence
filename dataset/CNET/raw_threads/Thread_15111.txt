If your system isn't acting flaky or rebooting, it probably is alright. What does your temp. monitoring s/w say? Generic, OEM or DIY system build? tada -----Willy

If you really feel that the computer is too hot then you can try to add a fan in it. If you want to see the temp. Get this program: http://www.download.com/SpeedFan/3000-2094_4-10540297.html?tag=lst-4-1 it also lets you increase the fan speed
