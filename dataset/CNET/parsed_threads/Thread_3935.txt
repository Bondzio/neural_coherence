<s> I'd like to get a Nook HD - love the screen resolution and I do a lot of reading. </s>
<s> It seems to have less glare than the nexus 7&quot; tablet. </s>
<s> But, I can't figure out how to get files from my camera onto the Nook without doing it via computer. </s>
<s> When I'm on the road, I don't want to take the computer, I want to take the nook. </s>
<s> The Canon G1X camera uses a regular size SD card, and the Nook HD as a micro sD card reader. </s>
<s> The camera does have a/v out and hdmi, which I could probably hook up to the nook via adapters but I don't know if the nook will be able to read the files or recognize them so I could save them onto the nook. </s>
<s> The nook has a proprietary usb cable which I could hook into a card reader/adapter, but again, I don't know if the software exists on the nook to recognize and manage the files. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> I own a few EyeFi cards and I have a few tablets but not the Nook HD. </s>
<s> Just an older Nook. </s>
<s> My nook color as well as the nook hd have a microsd slot. </s>

<s> Sorry but I don't have the Nook HD so I can't do more here. </s>
<s> -&gt; Parting comment. </s>
<s> If support is that bad they can't answer your questions, why are you considering their product? </s>

<s> and put it in the camera and when your done you can pop the Micro Sd card out and insert it into the Nook Micros Sd Slot. </s>
<s> Yes you can get micro SD adapters, I have a couple of them, I believe I purchased them at FRY'S several years ago. </s>
