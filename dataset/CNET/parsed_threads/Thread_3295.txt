<s> Hi Folks, I have wireless home network comprising of one Desktop running on XP Pro which the Lexmark x1250 is connected to it through a usb port, and I have a HP laptop running Vista Home Premium, they are linked through a Netgear Wireless G Router, They all see each other, I have successfully transfered files between them, the problem is my Lexmark All In One can not print from the remote Vista Laptop, the printer has being installed in the vista laptop, and it status in the printer and fax window is says ready, the problem is when send a file to print, after some time it gives me this error &quot;Communication Not Available&quot; I have tried everything, un-install and reinstall, disconnecting on the print server and connecting back, I have check the printer port on the Remote Vista Laptop, and is correct (\\hostname\sharedprintername) once in-stlled the Vista laptop it automatically becomes the default printer and Vista can access it properties, apart from not being able to printer, it gives same error for all other functions like scanning, photocopying, where i noticed that vista says is ready but the Lexmark icon says not connected, I have disabled firewalls and anti-virus on both systems but still same problem, is there anything else am leaving out here, thanks </s>
<s> were installed in the Laptop using Vista, correct? </s>
<s> You have the Vista drivers for the printer? </s>
<s> Downloaded from here http://www.lexmark.com/lexmark/sequentialem/home/0,6959,204816596_1019285789_0_en,00.html You installed the Lexmark x1250 into the desktop and have it set to be able to share printing. </s>
<s> So what I'm seeing here is the problem that was put in the Forum Sticky , about Printer Sharing on XP Vista Network(post 12). </s>

<s> Thanks, I saw that thread while I was trouble shooting before my post, I tried it, but Vista won't recognize the driver so can't install it as a local printer, so I click install on the driver installation itself, when installing, it asks me for the printer connection type, I click network printer (Peer To Peer), it then ask for the printer server name and shared name (the Printer is shared in the XP Desktop), once I fill in the data it searches for it, finds it and then installs it, after installation, it becomes the default printer on Vista, Vista can access the Printer properties, even says it status is ready but when ever I try to print a test page it won't print, it gives this error &quot;Communication Not Available&quot; After installation Vista status says Printer Ready, but the Lexmark Notification Icon in the Vista taskbar say not connected. </s>
<s> I have tried the Vista drivers downloaded from Lexmark, still the same problem </s>
