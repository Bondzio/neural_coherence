<s> I have a question. </s>
<s> I am thinking of getting a new ssd drive and windows 7, and using my old hard drive for extra storage. </s>
<s> Do I need to reformat it before using it as a second drive, or can it be plugged in after the new install with files and the old operating system still on it? </s>
<s> Yep. </s>
<s> Great, that will make it a lot easier to reformat. </s>
