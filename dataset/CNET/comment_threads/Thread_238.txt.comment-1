im having troubles since i uninstall some of my apps, then when i checked my system registry bunch of junks were left behind by the apps i already uninstall.
is there any way i could clean my registry aside from expensive registry cleaners.
my computer suffers from crash and slow start up.
please give me advice so i can clear up my registry from junks.
thanks for those who will reply.
