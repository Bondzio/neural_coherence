1.1.1	Hi all, I just assembly a new PC with dual processor to run 3DS Max but the render speed is almost the same with my old i5 PC, any idea what go wrong?	St
1.1.2	please see below the specification of both pc: New PC Processor: Dual Xeon E5606 2.13GHz (4 core) Mother board: Asus server board Z8NA-D6 RAM: 6 nos of Kingston DDR 3 PC1333 4GB Graphic: Leadtek Winfast Nvidia Quadro 2000D 1GB Hardisk: Corsair 120GB Sata 3 force solid state (OS) + WD 1TB (data) Power: Seasonic 1050 watts X Series PSU OS: Windows 7 ultimate Programe: 3DS max Render time with 3DS max: 1 hour 37 mins Old PC Processor: i5-2300 2.8GHz (4 core) Mother board: Gigabyte GA81945P-G RAM: 3 nos of Kingston DDR 3 2GB Graphic: Gigabyte Nvidia Geforce GTS 450 1GB Hardisk: WD 1 TB Power: Don't know what model OS: Windows 7 ultimate Programe: 3DS max + other programs Render time with 3DS max: 1 hour 53 mins I can't believe that the difference in render time is only 16 min!!!	St
1.1.3	Any thing go wrong with the hardware?	Sug
1.1.4	Thanks a lot for your help!	St
1.1.5	!	St
1.2.1	Years ago we had two identical machines.	St
1.2.2	One had 512MB RAM and the other 1024MB RAM.	St
1.2.3	Back then the render time was 6 hours on the 512MB RAM.	St
1.2.4	We wondered what would happen if we ran the render on both machines then swapped RAM, did the test again and see the results.	St
1.2.5	The results were identical on both machines with the results tracking the installed RAM.	St
1.2.6	The machine with 512MB RAM rendered the work in 6 hours (almost exactly).	St
1.2.7	The machine with 1024MB RAM finished 5 minutes earlier.	St
1.2.8	For that time or year of the PC this showed the bottleneck was not in the RAM for this render.	St
1.2.9	Fast forward to your machine.	St
1.2.10	The faster machine was 16% faster which shows that the 31 percent faster clock rate wasn't directly affecting or a factor.	St
1.2.11	Remember that I don't want to write that the i5 is only 2 cores with 4 threads dive into computer design.	St
1.2.12	I won't do that here.	St
1.2.13	--&gt; The results are as expected.	St
1.2.14	If you wanted more payback you might have checked out transcoding using the GPU or asked if there was a way to be sure that all cores are at work.	St
1.2.15	BEWARE that many CODECS will crash on multi-core, multi-thread calls so when that happens I can't help you as you must talk to the author/company of the CODEC.	St
1.2.16	My answer?	St
1.2.17	Yes.	St
1.2.18	Seems right to me.	St
1.2.19	In other words, nothing funky with those results.	St
1.2.20	Bob	St
