1.1.1	I have an old Windows Vista system with the C drive capacity of about 76Gb .	St
1.1.2	I have Unallocated space of 5Gb and then next to it the C drive of 70Gb but the Unallocated space is listed before the C drive .	St
1.1.3	Have tried to extend volume from the C drive partition but it 's grayed out .	St
1.1.4	Have tried to make the unallocated space into usable space and then giving it a hard drive name to see if I can then delete it and then see if I can extend the volume at that point but that did n't assist me .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.6	Would appreciate any help	Polite
1.2.1	And if you delete the C partition you wo n't have an OS to boot to .	St
1.2.2	If you have a good backup copy and a backup copy of that you can try GPARTED to move the partition .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	With the size of today 's hard drives , 5 GB is nothing .	St
1.3.2	You 'd likely do more harm than good since that partition was probably put there by your manufacturer for a good reason .	St
1.3.3	It may contain recovery info or it may be used for security or other purposes .	St
1.3.4	Windows provides a disk management tool under the Administrative Tools applet of the Control Panel , but I just remind you that & quot ; if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it & quot ; .	St
1.3.5	Good luck .	Polite
1.4.1	is a pittance and you 'll be back need more in a month or less .	St
1.4.2	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	Such as they have one of those early 10,000 or 15,000 RPM drives and paid dearly for it and want to eek out that last GB .	St

1.5.3	Bob	St
