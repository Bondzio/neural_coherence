I have a wireless Netgear WGR614v5 router, 54Mbps which is approx 6 yrs old.
I also have the high speed cable internet service that provides up to 10 Mbps DL speed.
Since my router still works, is there any reason I should replace it or is it possible it degrades in speed as it ages?
It just seems my internet speed isn't as fast as it used to be, that's why I was curious.
Thanks.
