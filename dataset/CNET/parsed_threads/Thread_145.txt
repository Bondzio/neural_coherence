<s> Ok, ive managed to obtain a cheap pentium 4 2ghz system, to replace the durno 1ghz system at my church. </s>
<s> The current system is used to project the words to the songs so it has two graphics cards (for dula scrren display, one to a monitor, and one to a projector) Here is the spec of the current system Duron 1ghz ECS Elite Group K7S5A Mother Board ( http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Downloads/ProductsDetail_Download.aspx?detailid=74&DetailName=Manual&DetailDesc=K7S5A%20%20 (V1.1)&CategoryID=1&MenuID=82&LanID=0) ATI RV2P-B3 PCI Graphics card DVI, VGA and component out (sorry couldnt find specs) Aopen 02948V1 AGP VGA out (sorry couldnt find any specs) The new system: P4 2ghz MSI MS6526 ver 3 ( http://global.msi.com.tw/index.php?func=downloaddetail&type=manual&maincat_no=1&prod_no=491 ) I dont tink i will need to use the on borad vga of the mother board, or the agp graphics card, as the projector has a dvi connection, but my question is could if needed? </s>
<s> Both have agp 4x slots, but the MSI states that it must be a 1.5v card are all agp 4x cards 1.5 volt? </s>
<s> Thanks Phill </s>
<s> &quot;the MSI states that it must be a 1.5v card are all agp 4x cards 1.5 volt?&quot; No. </s>
<s> When I read this it states that for 4X the card must support 1.5 Volt. </s>
<s> It's very confusing to most that the AGP voltage is not set by the motherboard but by the card you put in. </s>
<s> And there are KEYS in the slots to stop you from plugging in an incompatible card. </s>
<s> Sorry but I decline to re-explain this further. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks bob, the ECS board manual states that the agp slot is 2.0 complient, so could the card be swaped over directly with out finding the spefication of hte card? </s>
<s> Phill </s>
<s> I noted the keys to stop you from plugging in a card that won't be compatible. </s>
<s> What more could we need to know? </s>
<s> just noticed you were my lecturer at wiltshire college :-D yeah? </s>
<s> managed to find out more info on the gfx card, the modle is GF4MX440SE-V64(A8) and can be found at this page: http://global.aopen.com/Museum.aspx under apg it says: &quot;AGP Bus Rate : 1X, 2X, 4X&quot; this doesnt tell me that its 1.5v. </s>
<s> So can it be said that its compatable, the keying on the card is done by two slots, in the old motherboard, none? </s>
