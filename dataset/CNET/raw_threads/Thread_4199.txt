It used to work, or should I say, respond as soon as you wanted anything to print.But since I`ve got things back and running ok the printer takes about 20 mins to print anything off. It says it`s printing when I check the status but I can`t wait that long for stuff, seeing as it WAS ok before hand. I have downloaded Hp software, drivers and stuff to make it as it was but still no luck.. ANY IDEAS??? I`m desperate.. The disc I have with the software doesn`t make any difference. Both inks are LOW and in need of refilling, will that make it slow down? Or is it another issue? Please help Wolfey

Also, when on the system, do its own test pattern output, is it OK? Besides the reloading of the OS, etc, plus all drivers, have you updated the OS as well to include DX, etc., any updates fromt he MS update service? Of course the printer should be at its best, if under its test pattern it mentiones, low ink, replace. tada -----Willy

I do suggest make a simple text test page using notepad and then print it out, if it prints OK but feeds more than required, then you may have a problem with the system rather the printer. What are the results? tada -----Willy

I have tried to update with MS but to no avail.I`m in need of some major help. When I installed it the process said I should use the LTP1 port is that right? or should I have it set for something else.I`ve never rebooted a system before and didn`t look at all the settings for stuff before we cleaned everything off.I`m at a loss as to why it was ok and now it`s a slow as the preverbial SNAIL!

If not, change it and save it before exiting. Plus, you should at least redo the setting to &quot;defaults&quot;, try a print, if its OK, great if not then verify what the changes should be made. Very possible the print area of the media is smaller than it should be and/or an &quot;autofeed&quot; is proper for to be ready for next print job. The reason I mentioned a simple print test for output. Also, if you have footer cmds. remove them, these are the items &quot;page 1&quot; or &quot;file123.txt&quot; that get printed out along with the next, default them or blank(no cmd.). tada -----Willy
