<s> I recently had a system start wiping out keyboards (sure there's a problem that requires euthanasia). </s>
<s> I decided the best bet was to swap the hard drive into another old system to get back up and running ASAP. </s>
<s> The first time I started up with the two drives in the second unit, I got the warning the CMOS battery was critically low. </s>
<s> I worked on the system getting everything right and shut down. </s>
<s> I added more RAM (have since removed the extra RAM after the problem) but now I can't get the second system even to POST. </s>
<s> I removed everything back to its original setup, changed the CMOS battery for a brand new one and still nothing. </s>
<s> I am at a loss and am limited to what I have started as fixes. </s>
<s> Any help? </s>
<s> The additional RAM must have messed with original, swapped the RAM out, puter works with smiles. </s>
