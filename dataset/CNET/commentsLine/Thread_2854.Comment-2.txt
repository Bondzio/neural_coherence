roxio is notorious for this issue.
try... 1. deleting the upperfilters and lowerfilters you find in articles about this and roxio from the registry that you search about such on google.com 2. the eject bug was cured in a roxio update but many forget about that.
my workaround was never to use directcd.
ever.
