1.1.1	I just bought 1G ( 2x512 MB ) of Corsair TWINX PC-3200 DDR RAM and installed it successfully after I removed my old RAM and set the settings in my BIOS manually to CAS 2-3-3-6 .	St
1.1.2	I want to be able to use my old RAM ( 512 MB ( 2x256 ) of OCZ PC-3200 DDR RAM ) in my computer at the same time , but every time I install it , my computer gets past the BIOS diagnostics , but just wo n't load into windows .	St
1.1.3	I have an ABIT IS7 mother board which is compatible with both types of RAM , it just seems like my CAS settings are not good enough for my OCZ RAM .	St
1.1.4	I just learned what CAS settings are today , after having a really hard time getting my new RAM installed BTW , so I 'm totaly new at this .	St
1.1.5	On the OCZ website the CAS settings are 2-3-3-7 .	St
1.1.6	I tried changing my BIOS to those settings with just my Corsair RAM installed , to see if it would load windows , and it does .	St
1.1.7	But as soon as I add my OCZ RAM back in , Windows wo n't load anymore .	St
1.1.8	Does anyone have any suggestions as to what my CAS settings should be to work for both types of RAM ?	Ques
1.1.9	I 'm so new at this and I really do n't want my OCZ RAM to go to waste .	St
1.1.10	Thanks in advance !	St
1.2.1	In the end they re-read the manual and found only certain combinations would work .	St
