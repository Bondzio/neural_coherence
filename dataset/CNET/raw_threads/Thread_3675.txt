I turn on my AVR, then push the power button on cpu case. What happened, the power LED only blink and the PC don't open/power on. The first time this happen, I opened my case and look for the suspected culprit. I detached my psu and have it check by qualified technician to see if it is bad or damaged. It wasn't (use tester, it's good; did some switching on pins and got no problem!). So I put back psu, and for other suspected culprit, this time: check the wires connecting my SW to power button. I pull and replugged the pins/connector thinking it just need some &quot;refreshing&quot; and it will be good again. Then, I turn on my PC again pushing the power button on the case. It start my PC! But the next morning, the same fate happened. I've gone again to the same ordeal, repeating what I did the past day... And these have been my practice every morning since then.. Until, I got tired of doing it over and over again. So, while my AVR is turn on i just let it sit there (perhaps 3-5 minutes) and out of disgust I pushed on the power AND my PC start again! So every morning, I let my AVR turn on for several minutes (5 minutes) or even more before pushing my power button. Sometimes, successful sometimes NOT. I also observed that during COOL temperature (e.g when rain down poured the past night) I have this problem, but not on a HOT temperature (e.g. no rain the past night). I don't know what's exactly the culprit. Please help me on this. Suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Here's my PC's specs: Pentium 4, 3.06Ghz Mobo: Foxconn 865G7MF series Total Physical Memory (RAM): 1,024.00 MB OS: MS Windows XP Pro, version 5.1.2600 SP3 Build 2600 HDD: 2 (Hitachi, 80g; Fujitsu 6g) Optical: CDROM generic FDD: generic psu: 600watts generic avr: 500watts generic Thanks in advance guys!

Next, while the PSU was tested, I believe it was simple voltage &quot;LEDs&quot; on small tester rather than a full-blown power test. Some PSUs can appear OK on the little tester but fail as when a real power demand is required not just the presence as the &quot;pumff&quot; to get things going isn't there. They too suffer from bad caps as well as caps are everywhere in electronics. If your system case isn't well cooled, a PSU can falter over time on that alone. Switches are tricky, they can work and not if of cheap make-up or faulty, period. Though, switches are rarely a cause of problems, simple as they, only an ohm meter can verify that. tada -----Willy

One more info, power outage is a regular occurrence in my place. I believe this can damage electronic equipment, but I'm still not that aware of which equipment will be easily affected by this power outage. Thank you Robert and Willy! I'll go check my capacitors.

I suggest besides a simple surge protector(a good one), the likes of a decent UPS(orderly shutdown) plus a &quot;line conditioner&quot;. This all costs, but it can be worth the value if it reduces or eliminates much of AC problems which in turn can cause PC issues. FYI- I use solo AC surge protectors for each line and placed on a surge protected strip which in turn in plugged-in to a surge outlet socket at wall. Sensitive devices are routed to a line conditioner which is also plugged-in to a surge protected outlet. Why, all this protection, because I live in a wooded area where &quot;lighting hits&quot; are common. I do unplug everything when things get hairy when home. I've been saved more than once just replace the surge protection that got hit. tada -----Willy
