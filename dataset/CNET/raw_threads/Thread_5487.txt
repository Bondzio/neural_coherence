On my Perc 6i controller I have 2 virtual disks made up of 6 physical disks (4 on connector 0 and 2 on connector 1). Disk 0 and Disk 1 both 136.12gb making up virtual disk 0. Virtual disk 0 is RAID 1. This is my OS system drive in windows. Disk 2 3 4 and 5 all 278.88gb making up virtual disk 1. Virtual disk 1 is RAID 5. This is my data drive in windows. These are my issues. I have no hot spare. The virtual disk 1, my data drive (RAID 5) is 836.61gb and has just 40gb of data rattling around in it. I have no spares to slot in should disaster happen. Now I personally think the RAID 5 is overkill for my data drive because its backed up daily and I have weekly acronis images of it. My main concern is my system drive (I have an acronis image of this too) because as I dont have any spares I dont have anything to restore my image to if both disks fell over. I also do not have any means of testing the image works. I'm worried that if both disks corrupted I'll have to sit and rebuild the server from scratch. Now this is the important bit. My options. The system drive will remain as it is. All the following relates to my Data drive where all the company files sit. What I want to do is remove the RAID 5 and simply have normal standalone disks NON RAID or RAID 1. This would mean I would have 4 disks to distribute as follows. Without RAID configured on the Data drive = 1 hot spare, 1 data drive, 2 spares for emergencies. With RAID 1 Configured on the Data Drive = 2 disks for the RAID, one global hot spare and one spare for emergencies. - does that sound feasible? - if I go with the NON RAID option do I need to change the disks over to the SCSI connection or do they stay under the Perc connector? - do I need to format all disks after i've removed the RAID 5? - How do I go about removing the RAID 5 and reconfiguring the system back to working order i.e. I boot up and peopel work as they do now accessing a D:\Data drive for their files? Any advice much appreciated. I need to get rid of the RAID 5 asap so I can get the disks configured the new way and set up the hot spare/spare emergency disks. Thanks Dan

If you get the SERVICE TAG off the machine you can go to dell.com and put that in and see if the manuals for your machine cover this. What you propose should be in the manuals. That is, it was the last time I read them for another Dell server. In short, we pulled out the raid 5 set noting where they all were and the RAID BIOS settings. We slipped in the new drive and used the manual on how to configure the RAID BIOS for just a data set. Bob
