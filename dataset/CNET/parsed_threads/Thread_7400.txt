<s> Has anyone used DBAN, how long does it take to wipe your hardrive? </s>
<s> (please specify capacity etc). </s>
<s> Reason I'm asking is because The Airport in my country normally checks all computers. </s>
<s> I don't have anything immoral, only Some pirated software (and the airport here makes issues and fines about that). </s>
<s> I simply cannot afford to buy software!! </s>
<s> So my plan is to launch DBAN when the authouraties decided to check my computer? </s>
<s> Do you think this could work in time? </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> Thanks Dean </s>
<s> DBAN is not a 'quick solution' and if you're waiting at Customs at the airport expecting to be checked, you will not finish the process in time. </s>
<s> That in itself would be suspicious and if I were a Customs Official I would begin investigating further if a traveller turned up with a laptop running DBAN or similar. </s>
<s> I find your post rather strange. </s>
<s> Saying that you have &quot;pirated software which is not immoral&quot; is a matter of opinion. </s>
<s> I find it immoral, and offensive. </s>
<s> We don't discuss piracy in these forums and such discussions often get locked. </s>
<s> But not only that, if you cannot afford to buy the software, then you don't use it. </s>
<s> It is that simple. </s>
<s> If you cannot afford to buy a car, do you steal it? </s>
<s> If so that is a criminal offense in most countries, and to me software piracy is the same. </s>
<s> You do realise that DBAN wipes everything? </s>
<s> The whole hard disk. </s>
<s> Nothing survives. </s>
<s> That's it from me but beware, I am tracking this discussion. </s>
<s> Any 'workarounds' or otherwise replies that I feel contravene Forum Policy and I will start deleting and will lock the post. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> Being a part time computer and network tecnician as well as a systems administrator I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT PIRACY IS! </s>
<s> And Yes I also know how DBAN works, All I wanted to know was an average of how long it takes to function. </s>
<s> Your argument is useless. </s>
<s> First of all if a person can't afford a car there is always public transport. </s>
<s> This is not always the case with Software!!! </s>
<s> I use many open source and freeware programs but there are still certain programs that I need which are neither of these and this is when I turn to piracy! </s>
<s> (and this is not my will, I only use it because my university insists that I use certain programs!!) </s>
<s> Secondly.. </s>
<s> I did not ask you for any pirated software! </s>
<s> WHAT I ASKED is how long a perfectly legal program will take to run. </s>
<s> As I said your argument is useless. </s>
<s> Well Now Ill just use DBAN myself and see how long it takes rather than wasting the rest of my time arguing with you. </s>
<s> As we can't discuss pirated software, this discussion is now closed. </s>
<s> If you want to discuss DBAN, do that to avoid discussion locks. </s>
<s> If you want to discuss justifying use of pirated goods then post that in another forum so you can get going on the topics. </s>
