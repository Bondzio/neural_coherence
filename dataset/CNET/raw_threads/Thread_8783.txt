From reading various posts on this site as well as the PC mag &quot;Games for Windows&quot; (12/06), I saw many reccomendations calling for upgraded PSUs in light of higher spec requirements with Vista and Directx 10 in the near future. I was not even considering the possibility of upgrading the PSU until this AM when my computer went to &quot;stand by&quot; mode while playing GTA SA 2nd edition (which is full of bugs to begin with). My computer has sometimes crashed to the windows screen before, but never to stand by mode. So, I am guessing I may need a new PSU. But I do not have the first clue on how to choose one that matches my system. There was a very informative article, http://www.firingsquad.com/guides/power_supply/page3.asp that I read, but I am now more confused than ever. I guess I assumed that more watts would be better. I would really appreciate it if someone could tell me first of all is a new PSU needed? And if so, which one would be right for my system? I really hate Gateway and I am scared that a PSU bought online won't fit their case or match their motherboard etc. It would help too if you can explain it to me in really simple terms too. I really don't want to take to a dealer. I was hoping to make a high end gaming machine out of my PC while I take a break from console gaming (plan to re-visit the PS3 vs Xbox360 war again in a year or 2.) Thanks again for any help/info you can provide. Gateway GT 5056 AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Processor 3800+ 2.00 Ghz, 3 Gig DDR PC32000 RAM Radeon x1900 (was expecting to upgrade next year when Vista and directx10 arrives) Gateway FPD2185w monitor HP Officejet Pro K550 Series printer gateway mouse Logitech gamepad w/dual controllers (which I have unplugged for the moment; I think they're part of the problem) I can provide more info on specs if needed. Thanks again...James

The question is whether you can use a generic PSU or something proprietary to GATEWAY. Here's one of the BEST PSU mfgs made...it doesn't list GATEWAY as a mfg but I'm sure they can tell you if they make a unit that works with your PC as configured. It's definitely worth a call.

It said that particular card requires &quot; a 400 Watt power supply or greater, 25 AMPs, 12 volt rail reccomended (assumes fully loaded system); For CrossfireTM 550 watt power supply or greater, 38 AMPS, 12 volt rail&quot; I don't know if I should be feeling really angry or really stupid. I mean when I bought the system at Best Buy last summer, the BB employee and I must have talked for an hour or so about getting a &quot;high end gaming machine&quot; and it was he who suggested that card be bought with the system. And it alone is 100 volts over the Gateway PSU's 300 watt supply?! I will admit I do not know much about technology/electronics, but how have I been using the PC all this time with relatively few problems? I don't know if I should blame Best Buy or Gateway. I feel like I would have never known to even ask about the PC's internal power supply specs and whether or not it would be compatible with the system they sold to me. It just makes me mad. I think you should get what you are told you are buying. But at least I have learned a little more and know what to ask in future. I will call PC Power & Cooling tomorrow abnd see what can be done. I hope they will have good news as I have invested so much $$$$ already. Thanks again...James

I'd say it's the salesperson at BB. Not so much for suggesting the upgrade card but for not telling you about the additional power requirement and affect if any on the system warranty. If it's any comfort ...you're not alone. This happens often as people buy PCs off the shelf and afterwards start adding stuff. At some point the system starts showing signs of instability or spontaneous reboots, etc., Let us know how it works out. VAPCMD

Unfortunatley, they did not have a model for my Gateway PC. I did contat Gateway who sell a series of Startech PSUs ranging from about 300 to 550 watts. If I remember right the 550w startech was about 68-69$ (seems kinda of budget/low end to me). The tech at gateway assures me that these PSUs will work with the PC I got. But I thought I would try to enlist some help before I buy. So far I have not found any pages to find a review of startech although I am still looking. If you need to see the specs, this is the link to the PSUs that gateway sells/reccomends: http://accessories.gateway.com/AccessoryStore/PC+Accessories_316441/PC+Components_316805/Power+Supplies_316811/Default.htm Thanks for any help you can give...James

Based on the info from GATEWAY, here's what I located on the 550 PRO and before I forget .. the GATEWAY price is as good as any I've seen. Looks like this is the Startech SKU ATX2PW550PRO and here's the web site. Not sure what the warranty is from GATEWAY but warranty thru retail chains is 3 years.
