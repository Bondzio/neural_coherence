i am planning for an upgrade (a cheap upgrade, at least).
these are recent specs: intel pentium d 2.66 ghz (see it here  ) ddr 400 (1gb) 2 hdd: western digital (320gb,sata) and samsung (40gb,ide) internal video card (32mb) windows xp sp2 i need advices on what hardware/software should i put in to keep it fast.
i also have plans of playing high spec games like call of duty 4, left for dead, xmen origins, etc., but i was worrying about the bus speed of my motherboard.
i still use ddrs (which has 400mhz transfer rate), meaning i use an old motherboard (i forgot the brand, sorry!)
if i reached (at least minimum) specs of these games, can i still play these games smoothly under these bus speeds?
thanks!
