If I want to see how much 'Memory' my PC can handle, I can browse to Crucial.com and run their scanner - this will tell me the maximum amount that my PC can hold and exactly what type to buy. How can I do the same to find a PATA 'Internal Hard Drive' for my PC? I am unemployed so I can't afford to waste money buying a HDD that my PC can't handle. For example:- XP can handle 2 Terra-bits but my old Dell Dimension 3000 can only run a Max HDD size of 160 Gigs. I have older PCs and need to increase their HDD size - but can't get the info from the manufacturer on Max HDD size. I am already running the most up-to-date BIOS upgrade that their web site holds. Some BIOS's can only handle 40 Gigs, others can handle 137 Gigs - but how can I tell without 'Trial and Error'? This is not a storage issue, I already have an External USB drive for that. I just need the Largest and Fastest INTERNAL PATA HDD that my old PC will run. Is there a scanner out there that can do the job? Many thanks - Mike

Don't pass up posting the important details since the discussion fills with &quot;What is it?&quot; Ok, go look at http://www.48bitlba.ocm for articles and tools. Here's the fast IDE drive I used on a cheap box -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?InvtId=ST3400832A-NDW-R&cpc=SUGG I chose that one because of size and seek time. Sorry but no checking of in or out of stock as this is a world forum so you get to search for such drives in your country. Bob

One way around an old or outdated system BIOS... is a hard disk controller with a BIOS that allows large HDDs. That circumvents the HW problem ... you still need to address the OS limitations. Re a utility that tells you exactly what's the largest HDD you can install in any system (and access all the space), there isn't one that I know of. VAPCMD

PC - RM Window Box M/B - Micro-star International. 2003. SiS 650GL-6A6IXM4LC-00 BIOS - Phoenix Award BIOS v6.00PG. UK date 29-01-2003 OS - Windows XP Pro - Service Pack 3, fully updated. RM usually customise their Award BIOS's Have located the HDD you recommended for around 35 (UK) but I'm guessing that neither of my PCs will recognise them. Somebody must have a way of finding the max size for each machine. My Dell is only 2006 but can't read more than 160 Gigs... sigh....! Glad to see that you are using the same type of Dyslectic Keyboard as me - my .com always comes out as .ocm as well - but appart from that, they are good keyboards. -------------------------- Thanks VAPCMD The HDD controller you mention.. would that be a PCI plug-in type...? Seems like a good alternative. Many thanks - Mike

Here's a listing of some PCIs made for IDE. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010150410%201193212548&name=IDE They also have them that handle both DIE and SATA which might give you even greater drive choices and options. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010150410%201193216733&name=SATA%20%2f%20IDE When you boot up...or go into the BIOS, what does the setup screen show for the hard disk drive size ? I'm asking because I've never heard of a system limit of 160GBs. If you had an MSI MB...here's the kind of info should see the MB and BIOS.... http://www.msi.com/index.php?func=downloaddetail&type=bios&maincat_no=1&prod_no=559 VAPCMD
