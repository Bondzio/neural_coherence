As long as there's no power failure during the update, you shouldn't have a problem.
Just make sure you do it on a sunny day when there're no thunderstorms because if there's a blink of the power during an update, your motherboard's reduced to a door stop.
There are ways to recover, but the ounce of prevention certainly outweighs the pound of cure.
It only takes a few seconds to do the update, and I have to say I've never had a problem doing it (knock, knock!
), but I always check the weather channel and use a UPS (aka battery backup) just in case.
With a UPS, you've got to be somewhere around 99.999% safe, and it's a good thing to have in any event.
Good luck.
