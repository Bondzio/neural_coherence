1.2.1	The recommended screensize depends on the viewing distance and the quality ( HD or SD ) of the movie .	St
1.2.2	That 's not different from the recommendations for the screensize of a regular TV .	St
1.2.3	See , for example , http : //www.crutchfield.com/S-F4sOk5z2Zjk/Learn/learningcenter/home/TV_placement.html You would n't like how a SD movie on a 27 & quot ; LCD looks when viewed from the normal distance when you do word processing on a desktop ( some 15 & quot ; , I think ) .	St
1.2.4	There 's no need for any special graphics card .	St
1.2.5	Any standard one that will support the default resolution of your monitor ( choose one that has exactly the number of pixels corresponding with the SD or HD movies you 're going to play , that 's 1280x720 for 720p and 1920x1080 for 1080i and 1080p .	St
1.2.6	No need to have more pixels on your screen when viewing a movie than the source has .	St
1.2.7	You did n't specify your requirements for sound quality .	St
1.2.8	But I can imagine you would want better quality than the small speakers integrated in the usual monitor .	St
1.2.9	Even the most modest motherboard nowadays support 5.1 sound .	St
1.2.10	So support for that wo n't make your PC very expensive .	St
