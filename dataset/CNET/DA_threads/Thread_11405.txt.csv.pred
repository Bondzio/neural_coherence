1.1.1	I think Samsung has an 8 & quot ; tablet coming out soon .	St
1.1.2	I want to buy a tablet but have been wavering between a 7 & quot ; for its compact size and 10 & quot ; because it would be easier to read .	St
1.1.3	I would n't be doing anything serious on it - maybe surfing and photos , solitaire , emails .	St
1.1.4	I have an ereader now I have to have the print on medium/large so 7 & quot ; might be hard to read ( I 'm a senior ) .	St
1.1.5	I 'm wondering if anyone has used both a 7 & quot ; and 10 & quot ; and if they think an 8 & quot ; would be a good compromise .	St
1.1.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	I 'm a senior , but I can read my 7 & quot ; Kindle Fire just fine .	St
1.2.2	Just because you 're a senior does n't mean your eyes are n't any good ( I did have to have cataracts removed 3 years ago ) .	St
1.2.3	I 'd say that how much you 're going to travel and how much it would bother you to have something take more space , not to mention cost would be factors to consider .	St
1.2.4	You should consider battery life .	St
1.2.5	Another thing is typing .	St
1.2.6	The onscreen keyboard on my Kindle leaves a lot to be desired , and some web sites that require sign-ons are really difficult to position so that you can get your ID and password in .	St
1.2.7	Personally I travel very little and will take my nice 15 & quot ; laptop 95 % of the time over a tablet .	St
1.2.8	Only you can weigh how these factors stack up for you though .	St
1.2.9	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	what will be it 's special feature other than having today 's tablets ?	Ques
1.4.1	Both are the good and everyone have a different choice its totally depend upon your personal will and choice .	St
