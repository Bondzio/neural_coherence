<s> ok first i am srry if i am posting in the wrong section because this is my first time on the CNET boards. </s>
<s> i proble is as follows: i have 1 80 gb HDD and 1 40 GB hdd. </s>
<s> i want to make 3 total partions (each 40gb) for a seperate OS install. </s>
<s> if i use a boot loader, can i still boot the the 2ed 40 gb HDD? </s>
<s> or do all the partions need to be on the intial 80 GB HDD so i can boot to them? </s>
<s> Thank You. </s>
<s> It does make a difference. </s>
<s> Also if you are willing to buy a boot manager or not. </s>

<s> i will have 2 win xp pro copies, 1 win server 2003 copy and maybe a linux (unknown distro at this time) down the road. </s>
<s> as for buying the boot manager, if is ts affordable (under 50-60 american. </s>
<s> In that case, the XP and 2003 boot manager will be OK. </s>
<s> When you get a current Linux Distro, a new boot manager (most likely GRUB) will handle the boot management. </s>
<s> If you get some old Linux distro, then you have to deal with it. </s>
