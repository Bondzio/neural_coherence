i have a non-branded pc that my brother-in-law put together for himself and the passed it over to me.
it has a amd x52 chip and runs on xp pro.
i have a constant problem of where it boot's up everyday mysteriously.
i always shut it down completely in the evening.
without fail in the morning it is running.
i have the mcafee virus and spyware scan but doesn't seem to pick up anything.
if i shut the main switch behind, then it does not start up on it's own.
any ideas?
