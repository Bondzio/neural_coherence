Processor: Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.40GHz Memory (RAM): 256 MB Hard drive: 80 GB (in reality, 74.49...) Video card: 128 DDR ATI Radeon 9700 TX w/TV-Out Interestingly, I had no problem playing Splinter Cell 3 on this machine. However, when I tried to play Far Cry, the game loaded fine (slowly albeit) but the colors and shapes were...well, crazy; hard to explain. The colors were fine, but it was like looking through a kaleidoscope. Am I making any sense? I think I am going to up my memory to 512 MB. Can I upgrade my graphics card? Will either of these upgrades void my warranty? When I purchased the computer, I settled on the extended warranty, and I still have 280 some days left before it runs out. Any insight is greatly appreciated, Thank you in advance!

The new hardware will not be covered, but if you have a problem, you can restore the original configuration to have the unit serviced. (Put the old video card back in & remove the new memory.) As for upgrading the memory, I hope you have deep pockets because the Dimension 8250 used RDRAM which is very expensive. RDRAM memory sticks must be installed in matching pairs and 2 sticks of 256MB is currently running between $200 and $250. Good Luck.

It looks as though I might just hold off on upgrading and go ahead with building my own system after all. Again, many thanks for your help!
