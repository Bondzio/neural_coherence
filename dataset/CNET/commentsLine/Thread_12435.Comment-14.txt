if you can, change out the power supply, or take any one of your clicking hard drives out and put it into another working pc.
although it's possible you can have four bad drives, it stretches the imagination more than a bit.
i once had a similar problem and it turned out the culprit was a defective power supply that was putting out bogus 12vdc and 5vdc levels.
worth a try, anyway.
