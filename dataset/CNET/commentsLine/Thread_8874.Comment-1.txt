i am haivng a problem with my dvd +rw burner.
it is rosewell with a firmwire of a060 wrotes at 48x ect.
my system is a general off the shelf systme form compusa running windows xp using an amd athalon 2600+ w/ 512 meg of ram and an ati x800 pro video card but here is my problem.
this is my first &quot;install it yourself&quot; job and i cannot find the drivers for this thing.
when ever i pop in a dvd it suddenly thinks it is a cd drive not a dvd drive.
i have the correct firmwire (as far as i know) but am not sure aobut the drivers or why the drive is having self esteem problems when i give it a dvd to read.
it will read audio cds fine and data cds are slower than in my cd combo drive.
anyone have a solution to my dvd drive woes?
