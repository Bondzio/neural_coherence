<s> I have a gtx 295 co-op, it is two 295 gpus in one card. </s>
<s> http://www.evga.com/articles/00478/ Now here is my question. </s>
<s> I beleive it is a 680 watt minimum. </s>
<s> So if I get a 700w power supply will my computer be okay? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182173 </s>
<s> Here are my specs. </s>
<s> Amd 2 x4 750gb hard drive 8gigs of ram </s>
<s> Not with that psu. </s>
<s> That card is looking for 46 amps on a single rail. </s>
<s> Maybe this might be a better fit. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139021 </s>
<s> so the sli-ready is probably fine since 12w will come off the pci-e board connection and the other two connectors only need lesss than 20w each. </s>
<s> a single rail high voltage psu will feed power to both pci-e connectors from the single rail, but others will feed it from two rails. </s>
<s> if you're still worried, this sli certified one will definitely fit the bill for $90 since each 12v rail is rated at 25w: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371026 </s>
<s> After fixing too many multiple rail systems (re-jigger power connections) I am now a fan of the single rail PSU when ever possible. </s>
<s> One less thing for the builder to get wrong. </s>
<s> And half the work in those jobs was to give a short course in power supplies. </s>
<s> I don't know which was harder, the machine repair or explaining why we didn't replace parts and why. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
