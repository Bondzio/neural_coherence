I'm a little taken aback with the prices you listed.
My recent upgrade was a Netgear WPNT-834 for 69 bucks refurb from geeks.com.
I found a Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 for 49 bucks on sale at Best Buy which is doing a stint running a Linux based router firmware since I wanted to do that for some time.
The gigabit wifi router is a nice touch since I doubt you'll replace that any day soon.
