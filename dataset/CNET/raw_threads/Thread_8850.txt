I have an external drive enclosure w/USB 2.0 connection and am considering an 80+G hard drive. Seeing as I have never done this and I cannot open the comp w/o breaking the &quot;lock screw&quot; installed to detect this, I am getting an external. I already have an external DVD burner. I asked GATEWAY about this and all they replied with was a sales pitch for a 250G hard drive. I have a GATEWAY e2300 w/ WINXP HOME w/SP2 and a 2.66GHz processor. Can anyone enlighten me as to what I need to do?

Let XP find it. Done. In XP open Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Computer Management, on the left click Disk Management, on the right, activate the drive if necessary, format the drive. Done. It's really that simple. Wayne There are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't.

I do appreciate the post though. Thanx. Maybe next time I will look into it a little more before I put my foot in my mouth.
