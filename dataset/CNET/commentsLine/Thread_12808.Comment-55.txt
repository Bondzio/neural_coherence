i chose other becaause i interpret the other choices as being built for me.
i prefer to build my own because i am qualified to do so.
(that's my conceit) really, it's because i am constantly upgrading to meet current needs for &quot;others&quot;.
most folk i deal with don't want to anticipate their future needs.
new comers often only want to do the r-mail thing or to write letters.
if they associate with other pc users, it isn't long before they want to do more than their pc is really designed for.
they oftem experience unnecessary frustration trying to do what they really can't.
another problem, especially with some cheaper brand names is that they are harder to upgrade without major parts replacement.
let's face it, if it's cheap there is a reason - and it's not a good one!
hope this helps someone aviod a pitfall - norm smith
