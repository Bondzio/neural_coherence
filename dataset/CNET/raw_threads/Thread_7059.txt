Are they currently hardware &quot;up to date&quot; or lagging well behind? I'm making two important points here for those that might understand.

The weakness of an all-in-one is (just like a laptop) is that what you got is what you got. If you buy a game and your machine doesn't have enough graphic punch to run it, you're stuck. If you are dead set on getting an all-in-one, the dell xps one for $1800 is probably your best bet.
