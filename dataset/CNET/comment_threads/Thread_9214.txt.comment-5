Bob, Thanks for the suggestions.
Unfortunately, none of these issues is of concern (they have all already been addressed).
Since it is only this one computer that is inaccessible at times, I lean towards something having changed on it - like a Windows Update or ZoneAlarm update which is aggravating things.
Pain in the butt.
