1.1.1	hello everyone i am new to this field.. so i am asking a rather simple qestion but seriously i could n't find the answer anywhere .	St
1.1.2	for a device to communicate with another device it sends the information with specific radio frequency .	St
1.1.3	now my question is why do organizations like FCC , etc allocate the bandwidth in the first place through auctioning and stuff like that .	St
1.1.4	i mean there is no LIMIT on the EM spectrum to be used right .	St
1.1.5	Can you please tell me the exact specifics of why actually allocation is needed and what happens if it is not allocated .	Sug
1.1.6	I also want to know why specific frequency is allocated to specific radio channel .	St
1.1.7	why cant a radio channel use any other frequency .	St
1.1.8	I am kind of new so this may seem absurd but please help even any links or books explaining these concepts are also fine for me and sorry if i posted in the wrong area cuz this is wer i found appropriate .	St
1.1.9	Edit/Delete Message	St
1.2.1	Well physically there is a limit on microwave and wireless frequencies , they do n't range from 1 to infinity , and Governments have always parcelled out frequency bandwidth to providers .	St
1.2.2	A very simple case in point .	St
1.2.3	Governments restrict the public use of radio frequencies used by emergency services on FM , short range , or LW , long wave .	St
1.2.4	If they did not , the emergency services would n't work as public use would constantly cause interference .	St
1.2.5	Another example .	St
1.2.6	TV transmission over the airways used up an enormous range of frequencies for each channel .	St
1.2.7	If Governments did not allocate channel bandwidth and prevent pirate stations from operating , we would not have received the programs we expected .	St
1.2.8	We would have seen pirated stations , or just static interference .	St
1.2.9	That said , developed nations have now , largely , moved on from 'over the air ' analog transmission in favor of over the air digital transmission which can pack more data in , and the processors in TVs and set-top boxes are able to de-compress the data and process it into the hundreds of channels we now get .	St
1.2.10	But no organisation can legally begin transmitting data , be it radio , TV , cell phone or walkie talkie on just any frequency .	St
1.2.11	They have to have ownership of that frequency and that is where allocation comes in .	St
1.2.12	You may be thinking that , even so , the range of frequencies from Microwave to radio wave is immense , and that is right , but modern technology is not yet at the stage where broadcasters and receivers can use 1 single Hz or 1 decimal point of a Hz without interference and bleeding into other frequencies .	St
1.2.13	That sort of precision technology does n't yet exist , if it ever will .	St
1.2.14	I hope that helps .	St
1.2.15	Mark	St
1.3.1	That was helpful thanks a lot .	Polite
1.3.2	But still I have a few more doubts .	St
1.3.3	Just to be clear ... . 1 ) Suppose I have at my home a transmitter and a receiver with me .	St
1.3.4	Now i am transmitting a signal at a frequency of say 'X ' hz with the data being modulated from the transmitter in FM manner .	St
1.3.5	And say that there is a radio station with same frequency ( X FM ) .	St
1.3.6	Now , will I be able to transmit the data or not .	St
1.3.7	Technically I should n't because that particular frequency is allocated to that channel right .	St
1.3.8	2 ) Secondly , if there is a radio station at say X FM .	St
1.3.9	Will I be able to access that same radio channel , by turning the knob of my radio to that particular frequency , from anywhere in the world .	St
1.3.10	Because it has been allocated that channel , so technically I must be able to access it anywhere because the organization would n't have allocated it to anyone else except that channel company .	St
1.3.11	Thanks again for the above answer , it was helpful .	St
1.4.1	and just one more thing ... What about different countries .	St
1.4.2	If a channel is allocated a specific frequency , will that frequency be not available for any other country as well .	St
1.4.3	This was just an extension of my previous post but if the question was n't clear this is it .	St
1.4.4	Also I tried to catch a radio channel which is there in some other state , but I could n't from where I stay .	St
1.5.1	1 ] No , not if that channel has been allocated to that radio station .	St
1.5.2	2 ] Yes , but probably not everywhere around the world .	St
1.5.3	FM is , I believe , short range .	St
1.5.4	The physical range depends on the amount of power the station can use and other factors like height of the transmitter .	St
1.5.5	If they could use unlimited power , they would still need to be mindful of bleeding into frequencies of nearby , ( FM range ) stations .	St
1.5.6	But of course this all depends on where you live .	St
1.5.7	I have no idea if all nations allocate and control microwave and wireless frequencies .	St
1.5.8	For all I know , some nations may have a 'free for all ' .	St
1.5.9	Your other question below .	St
1.5.10	Yes it may be available in other countries .	St
1.5.11	Different countries allocate frequencies for their own purpose .	St
1.5.12	There may be an international agreement about certain frequencies but apart form that nations have their own free will .	St
1.5.13	Mark	St
1.6.1	1 .	St
1.6.2	Yes , technically you can .	St
1.6.3	But it 's not allowed and there 's a good change you 'll see the police in a short time .	St
1.6.4	How short a time depends on what others use that same frequency .	St
1.6.5	If it happens to be the Army for its very secret and very secure communications it wo n't take long .	St
1.6.6	Same for air traffic control after a few planes crashed because they could n't receive the instructions .	St
1.6.7	If it 's the very popular local radio that other people ca n't receive now , it wo n't take very long either if enough of your fellow citizens complain .	St
1.6.8	Compare it with driving on the right side of the road in the UK .	St
1.6.9	Technically you can .	St
1.6.10	But it 's not adviced to do it for some good reason .	St
1.6.11	2 .	St
1.6.12	If you 're inside the receiving range ( distance ) : yes .	St
1.6.13	Otherwise : no .	Res
1.6.14	Only so called 'short wave ' is really nearly world-wide .	St
1.6.15	Kees	St
