The laptop started having problems with overheating so, between locking up and blue screens of death, I downloaded all my work information, pictures and everything that I felt was nessessary to the Maxtor. The Compaq has gotten so bad that I have purchase a new Gateway laptop running windows xp media center edition. When I plugged in the USB the pc recognized everything and stated that my new hardware was ready for use. However the Maxtor does not show up in My Computer. I have gotten back into the Compaq and put the driver folder on a Flash drive and transfered that to the new pc. It still will not show up. Can anyone help me?
