It would draw selection rectangles and right click and left click. I disconnected the network, but it continued. AVG and Panda were unable to detect viruses, and Windows Defender and Ad-Aware failed to find spyware. I swapped mice, and noticed when I installed my backup mouse with the original drivers that there was a second mouse installed on my system in Device Manager. It was a generic driver for a &quot;HID-compliant mouse&quot;. When I disabled this device the mouse stopped moving on its own. I tried uninstalling it but it came back. I don't know if it will stay disabled. Has anyone ever heard of this happening before?

But if you have an optical mouse, there isn't any ball to drag on a mouse pad. Just a laser light. So if you pick up your optical mouse off the optical surface it will move on its own. Almost feeling like someone else is using it. Could that be it?
