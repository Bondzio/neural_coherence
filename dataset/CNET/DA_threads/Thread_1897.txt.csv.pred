1.1.1	I am building a P4 pc.	St
1.1.2	I am no expert but I built a 1GHZ pentium years ago after I blew up my old one.	St
1.1.3	I purchased an ASUS p4S8x MB off ebay.	St
1.1.4	I also purchased a P4 2.6 ghz 533mhz processor.	St
1.1.5	Well the problem is the proocessor turned out to be a 800 mhz processor.	St
1.1.6	I guess it was listed wrong or I was just screwed by some seller.	St
1.1.7	My question is will this processor work on this board?	St
1.1.8	Any help will be greatly appreciated.	St
1.2.1	There is an 800MHz FSB P4 which is a good thing.	St
1.2.2	I wonder if you have some P4 with the better 800MHz FSB?	St

1.3.1	http://www.hothardware.com/viewarticle.aspx?articleid=61&catid=3 Might be best to buy PC 3200 [DDR 400] memory because the chipset seems to POSSIBLY support DDR 400.	St
1.3.2	If not it will simply run at DDR 333.	St
1.4.1	You are correct.	St
1.4.2	Let me clarify what I ment It is a 2.6/512/800 p4 processor.	St
1.5.1	Intel used what was called &quot;quad clocking&quot;, and thus a 200 MHz DDR which clocks on both leading and trailing edge is called DDR 400 [200 times 2] and quad clocked gives the FSB of 800 MHz.	St
1.5.2	[200 times quad, which is 4 thus 800].	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
