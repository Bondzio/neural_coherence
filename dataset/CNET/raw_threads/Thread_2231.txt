The correct question is: What is the native resolution of your display to have the expected picture quality? It is recommendable to use always the native resulution of the display instead of an induvidual setting. Before you purchase a display you have the chance to select the preferable resolution and screen size based on the performance of your video card. Also here you will find out soon that the variety will be limited.

Such displays are expensive but the compfort of work is extreme, especially if you are a professional designer, programmer or you worh with many open windows. I'm really unhappy if I'm forced to work on a smaller display or lower resolution.

So, the maximun resolution offered by the monitor should be used. The monitor's aspect ratio is important here. For gaming and watching HD movies, an aspect ratio of 16:9 is prefered. For general PC usage, a 8:5 (16:10) aspect ratio is better. The resolution used for gaming also depends on the power of the GPU. Putting all these into consideration, a 24 inch monitor with an aspect ratio of 8:5 used at a resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels is a good choice for general usage, gaming and watching HD movies..

I don't want too high a resolution because I'm afraid everything will be too small and lower resolution means I can't fit as much on the screen. Unfortunately newer laptops don't seem to offer this resolution anymore.

Indeed, but when it comes to monitors the best resolution will always be the one native to your display (in my case 1920x1080). There are some exceptions such as system resource heavy games. If you don't have a powerful enough setup (Modern GPU, atleast 4GB memory etc.) The game will perform much better if you lower the res., while keeping the same aspect ratio. Other than that, always set to native resolution.

It's in my kitchen and also makes a great space-saving TV with a minimum of extra wiring, boxes, etc. It was also one of the few that just barely fit under my kitchen cabinets. Very happy with it, although, the built-in speakers are barely adequate. I suspect that most of the &quot;other&quot; votes were also 1920 x 1080, as this seems to be the most common offering these days. You can get a 22 to 24 incher sometimes less than $150. I couldn't even find a 1280 x 1024 to replace my old 19&quot; when it died. For those who intentionally set the resolution lower than the native resolution so that they can see text and icons better, Windows does allow you to increase the text and icon sizes without lowering the resolution, giving you the best of both worlds. It doesn't always yield ideal results, but is worth trying.
