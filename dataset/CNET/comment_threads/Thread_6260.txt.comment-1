My computer can't run games very well, like for example: Fable 3, Skyrim, Star Wars TFU2, Call of duty etc.
I really want to play games like that.
Here is my PC http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02743406&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=5090668#N74 I have a 250watt power supply, do I have to get a new power supply to get a new graphics card since mine is kind of low?
Somebody recommended this video card because it doesn't require a very big power supply.
Will this card run those games good?
If not, what should I get?
