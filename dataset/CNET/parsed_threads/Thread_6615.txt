<s> My friend told me that this is a good printer. </s>
<s> It is now on promotion for $59.99. </s>
<s> Is there anyone here use it before? </s>
<s> At 60 bucks for the printer the cart could run 54 bucks. </s>
<s> Some may be upset at that. </s>
<s> Read reviews at http://www.amazon.com/Brother-HL2240D-Monochrome-Printer/dp/B004A16L2Q and other sites. </s>

<s> If you're a home use or small business it may fit the bill. </s>
<s> Don't expect this printer to do too much as in printing reams of paper output. </s>
<s> It does well, but as stated to you, brother gets it's hand again with toner costs. </s>
<s> This is common for low-end or less expensive printers. </s>
<s> Plus, the 1st initial toner provided, may just be a &quot;starter&quot; toner cart, so once gain it'll be time to buy. </s>
<s> However, I consider this a good bargain, but it seems if you wait or look around, other laser printers as just as cheap or available. </s>
<s> It boils down to your needs as in what you expect from the printer, like connectivity, network, ease, costs, or paper selections, etc.. tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Yes, it is a good printer. </s>
<s> We've been using a Brother printer for about three years now. </s>
<s> We haven't had any problems with it. </s>
<s> Also read the manual and try to set its settings to produce your desired output. </s>
<s> And do maintenance regularly. </s>
<s> It will do good for the machine. </s>
