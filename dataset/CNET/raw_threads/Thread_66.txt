Basically all I want is to be able to play most games without slowdown and the like. I currently have an eMachines E4028, and was wondering what sort of upgrades would be suitable. I have tried looking at graphics cards, but I just get confused. Someone has offered me an 'XFX PV-T34K-NAHG 5200 NVIDIA AGP' graphics card, but apparently I already have 128mb in onboard graphics? Oh, and I am on a budget, being a student! If anyone could help I'd seriously appreciate it. Cheers, James
