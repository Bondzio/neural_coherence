<s> I put a DVD-player that I don't use any more in an old P2 as well as a DVD-CDRW-combo. </s>
<s> Both of these drives are running fine but I can't get any sound on either drive of any CDs or any MP3s. </s>
<s> I havn't got any music on the HD as I have just set-up new on that one, so I havn't tried if I could play (and hear) it. </s>
<s> I'm running Win 2000 Pro on it. </s>
<s> The second problem I'm having is, I conected a 56k USB-modem on this PC. </s>
<s> Plug and play detects the new hardware every time I start up. </s>
<s> If I try to connect to the net, it says: no modem found. </s>
<s> I also noticed, that the power-light on the modem is not on. </s>
<s> I tried to install the drivers of the CD that came with it, no luck. </s>
<s> When I connect it to my XP-machine then the power-light comes on. </s>
<s> Any recomendations would be gratly apreciated thanks. </s>

<s> I got an old Pentium 2 that still runs fine. </s>
<s> Now I'm giving it to a friend that's just starting and wants to use it just for some Office-work and play some music on it. </s>
<s> My problem now is, when I put a CD in either drive I can't hear any music. </s>
<s> So I tried just about everything like changing cables, using just one drive etc. </s>
<s> A DVD movie is just starting and playing fine but without any sound. </s>
<s> So my last guess is, that the sound card is no good anymore. </s>
<s> I can't check for new drivers cause I don't know the make and model of it. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help Andreas </s>
