<s> (windows XP)recently the cdrom/ floppydrive and cdr stopped working properly. </s>
<s> when i insert a cd and try to open it i get this error message: D or A:\ is not accessible. </s>
<s> Incorrect function. </s>
<s> But if i restart the computer and leave the disc in the drive, after restarting it will read the disc properly. </s>
<s> For some reason the disc needs to be in the computer when it boots up for it to recognize it. </s>
<s> i was going to reinstall the drivers, but this wouldnt make sense considering it's the three different devices doing the same thing. </s>
<s> the only thing differently ive done to the computer lately is i installed a usb smartmedia card reader, which said it was not tested to run with XP, i installed anyway and it worked at first, then it would not and so i removed it. </s>
<s> But my usb mouse still functions properly, so i doubt this is the cause. </s>
<s> i also got the service pack2 to from microsoft to update windows XP. </s>
<s> and i got new antivirus software as well as adaware and spysubtract. </s>
<s> These shouldnt have an effect but theyre the only things ive done differently on the computer recently any help would be great, i dont know too much but am learning through each new problem, and just need some direction as to what things to check out. </s>
<s> Select Start/Run and type MSCONFIG Go the STARTUP tab and uncheck any items related to Anti virus, spyware or Adware. </s>
<s> In fact, try removing any software that you recognize in the list that isn't part of Windows itself. </s>
<s> Reboot and see if that resolves the problem, if it does you can restore the items a few at a time until the problem occurs again, and you can narrow down the cause. </s>
<s> I have either installed or had clients install SP2 on a few hundred systems and not run into the problem even similar to what you describe. </s>
<s> System Works or AV or NIS which have all been noted to cause this error message. </s>
<s> In a few instances AVG and McAffee have also been noted as culprits. </s>
<s> Go here http://www.symantec.com/techsupp/nav/nav_2005_tasks.html and search for not accessible. </s>
<s> Incorrect function. </s>
<s> with the &quot;All knowledgebases&quot; radio button checked. </s>
<s> So too has Roxio and Nero's InCD Also you might try this: Right-Click on the drive w/ the problem Properties Recording Tab and then check the &quot;Enable CD Recording On This Drive&quot; box. </s>
<s> (just opposite of what is recommended for DVD) http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;826510 </s>
<s> you were right, it's norton but their instructions to fix it dont seem accurate: Change the service startup timing To change the startup timing 1. </s>
<s> Start Symantec AntiVirus. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> On the Configure menu, click Filesystem Auto-Protect. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> In the right pane,click Advanced. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Under Startup Options, select Symantec AntiVirus Start. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Click OK until you see Filesystem Auto-Protect, and thenclick Exit. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Restart the computer. </s>
<s> when i open the antivirus software, there's no configure option, but if i go to options it has the Filesystem Auto-Protect. </s>
<s> and the advanced button is not in the right pane but is a drop down menu below Filesystem Auto-Protect. </s>
<s> and then after that there is no startup options, or any of the other stuff they say is there. </s>
<s> It only says what activates to monitor when using floppy and then has two options 1.scan all removable media for boot viruses every time it is mounted 2.scan floppy disk in A:for boot viruses when shutting down am i not looking in the right configuration area (it's definately not the same as they are describing), is there somewhere deeper in the program i need to go? </s>
<s> iwould have emailed norton with this next issue but they make you work to find an email address on their site. </s>
<s> Thank you so much for all your help, almost there </s>
