i have been doing development for a few years now and i have always used the same laptop, i think that it is only if you want to get into rendering high end graphics really quickly that you will need a good graphics card, i would recommend: -medium spec graphics card (512mb nvidia) -2gb of ram -good cooler for those long nights error solving -reasonable hard drive -32-bit operating system because 64bit isn't very widely used yet -2ghz+ processor -good keyboard (they wear down quickly !!!)
-doesn't matter about the mouse -clear monitor and your set for a very long time, have fun, odd_job
