1.1.1	i bought a brand new HP mini notebook around a year ago and i 've had it hooked to the AC supply permanently and have been using it for long periods of time that exceeds 7 hours per day , just like when one would use a desktop .	St
1.1.2	frankly i 've never had a desktop in my life except from years ago and i 've always borrowed my friend 's pc since i 'm crashing in his place , but ever since i got my laptop i 've been sitting infront of it for many hours everyday and i 've been doing this for 4 months , so i 'm wondering if i 've been exposed to large amounts of laptop radiation since laptops are only supposed to be powered on for 4 hours until the battery dies out , but now i basically had it on 24/7 on hard power supply on the dinner table and uses it for long durations just like a desktop without those professional laptop shield .	St
1.1.3	granted i did n't put it in my lap and i just sat with the laptop on the table proper so no worries about my genitals being affected and i always made sure the laptop itself is always half an arm 's length away from me but i 'm still worried about getting cancer sooner because after googling for awhile it seems laptop radiations do n't always meet safety standards , maybe its time i get a proper desktop for good .	St
1.1.4	well share your thoughts with me i 'd like to know what you folks think , chao !	St
1.2.1	While CRTs could emit X rays , LCDs do n't .	St
1.2.2	But there are a few that are sensitive to even the slightest of EM so you must be gentle with them and hope they 'll ask their doctors .	St
1.2.3	Frankly , the worry is up to you as there is no X ray radiation source in laptops .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Who knows what they will find tomorrow .	St
1.3.2	Personally I wish they would add a device to cell phones so that if you used it while operating a motor vehicle you would get a highly aggressive form of brain cancer and be dead within 24 hrs .	St
1.4.1	so some people are more sensitive to these electro magnetic waves than others , i was born prematurely so i guess i could have problems down the road , i never got a desktop these past 7 years because i move around too frequently and i ca n't afford to to put too many of my stuff in storage .	St
1.4.2	thanks for letting me know !	Polite
1.5.1	The only good news I see is that laptops emit a minuscule percentage of EM that desktops and CRTs did .	St
1.5.2	I can only imagine how bad some felt using desktops .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Normally , the radiation emitted by netbooks are very minimal and I do n't think that it would be enough to cause cancer .	St
1.7.1	From where does a laptop emit .	St
1.7.2	.	St
1.7.3	.	St
1.7.4	uh , oh !	St
1.7.5	You mean the wireless radio emits radiation ?	Ques
1.7.6	As in just like a cell phone ?	Ques
1.7.7	OMG ! !	St
1.7.8	A radio transmitter radiating ! ! !	St
1.7.9	Youtor .	St
1.7.10	Do n't be paranoid .	St
1.8.1	You have EM from the power circuits , RF from the wifi and other stuff .	St
1.8.2	While most of us think nothing of it , a few folk believe what they believe .	St
1.8.3	Given what the old CRTs threw out , you 'd think the sensitive ones would have died out by now .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	Maybe youtor is already affected .	St
1.9.2	And do n't forget the nuclear fallout from Japan , wafting it 's way across the Pacific to North America .	St
1.10.1	NIL	St
1.11.1	A lot of people have been bothered by the radiation scare , although , there is some truth to the idea , it still depends on the vulnerability of the person .	St
1.11.2	Definitely , a healthy individual will not be affected easily and likewise a person with an impaired immunity will be harmed at a minimal exposure .	St
1.12.1	From Cathode Ray Tubes to today 's LCD .	St
1.12.2	If they feel it from LCD , imagine what happens when they are near a CRT !	St
