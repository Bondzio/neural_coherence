1.1.1	I have a new Dell 4600 computer with the SoundMax integrated audio card , ADI 198x .	St
1.1.2	While attempting to upgrade to a Soundblaster card the sound devices got switched to the soundblaster devices .	St
1.1.3	Due to hardware conflicts I had to uninstall the software and remove the soundblaster card .	St
1.1.4	When the computer rebooted , and identified the integrated soundcard all drivers were installed .	St
1.1.5	However , none of the devices was picked up in the active device boxes on the sounds and audio devices menus in my control panel .	St
1.1.6	The volume tab shows & quot ; no audio device & quot ; .	St
1.1.7	The audio and voice tabs show & quot ; no devices & quot ; in the drop down menus , and all those sections are grayed out so they ca n't be changed .	St
1.1.8	But , on the hardware tap all the audio components show as working properly , and enabled , but not activated .	St
1.1.9	I have downloaded and zapped the chipset , refreshed the Windows XP operating system , installed the updated driver for the audio card , and have been on the phone , and in email contact with Dell Tech Support for almost a week .	St
1.1.10	Nobody seems to have the slightest idea how to restore the volume control mixer so that it 's functional , and nobody seems to know how to restore the system to factory defaults .	St
1.1.11	I 'd appreciate any help .	Polite
1.2.1	I read through this and see no hardware issue .	St
1.2.2	Maybe drivers or how to install the OS from scratch .	St
1.2.3	You also did n't reveal if you were ready to return the machine to its factory setup which Dell will know how to guide you .	St
1.2.4	As to the volume control , you may be nonplused to find out that if system restore fails or other items fail that your average support will have you wipe the disk and reinstall from scatch .	St
1.2.5	This does work , but you did n't reveal if you ca n't do this .	St
