It seems like most of the LCD's out there have been there since early 2005 (e.g. Samsung 244, 214). Are there any new announced ones worth waiting for ? I'm tempted to get the Dell 2407. I know a few customers have had some issues with them but it seems like Dell has addressed some of the banding issues in firmware updates. Otherwise, it's enough cheaper that it would have to have pretty major issues to want to spend the extra money for a different model and even then, I haven't seen reviews saying there's anything dramatically better. Thanks, Ben
