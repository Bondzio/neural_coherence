I know it has built-in storage capabilities but whenever I attempt to download anything to store, a message appears saying that I must insert a CD. Why won't the unit simply use it's built-in storage? What kind of CD must I buy? I bought the unit mostly for surfing the web but once in a while, I find an interesting article or image that I want to save. I am not computer savvy so I am probably doing something wrong.

But I can tell you WHAT to do in your browser. And that's setting the default folder to store the downloaded files to something else than the CD-drive. Some people download everyting to the desktop. Others prefer to have a dedicated folder on the hard disk. It's your own choice. But a CD-drive is rather unpractical indeed. If I were you, I should change that setting. Kees
