<s> Think I've boiled it down to these two for the upgrade of my Dell C521 with 4GB 32-bit 280 Watt Any ideas..it's for tv wacthing and gaming (GTA4,Oblivion,Far Cry2) Thanks again for the help </s>
<s> Ok, those are two of the best cards around. </s>
<s> I personally have a Geforce 9800 512 MB and it runs great, I play CODWAW, Simcity Socitites, Age of Empires III, and many other graphic heavy games and i can run all my games on max quality with no lag. </s>
<s> (Mind you that I custom build my machine and i run 64 bit windows 7 rc) However i think that the Geforce 9500 1 GB card might be better because it has more dedicated graphics memory, and it should be able to play games for many more years to come. </s>
<s> The 9800 is the winner here. </s>
<s> It may need a big power supply but given these 2 choices, the gamer should pick the 9800. </s>
<s> Again. </s>
<s> That POWER SUPPLY will have to be upgraded. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Shouldn't the 9500 1 GB card be better as it has more dedicated graphics memory than the 9800 512 MB card. </s>
<s> Just a thought. </s>
<s> Also, he is right on the power supply, it will probably need to be upgraded also but their not that expensive. </s>
<s> You can research this at tomshardware.com. </s>
<s> But either should be too taxing for the 280 Watt power supply. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Both cards are pretty good however from the info on tigerdirect.com the 9800 card is much better. </s>
<s> However with that said it is about 50 bucks (US) more. </s>
<s> Read the info below. </s>
