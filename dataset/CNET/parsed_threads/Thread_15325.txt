<s> I've been looking at Mac hardware for the last few weeks and am preparing to make the switch from PC. </s>
<s> Basically, the only reason I'm interested in a Mac is Final Cut Pro. </s>
<s> I've narrowed my choice down to the I Mac 20&quot; and the PowerMac 2GHz. </s>
<s> What I want to know is how much of a difference the dual processor makes? </s>
<s> The Power Mac is about $350 more with less features ao I'm assuming that's the big reason for the price difference. </s>
<s> Also, if anyone has any experience with Final Cut, is the dual display capability of the Power Mac worth the extra money or is the single screen sufficient? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help </s>
<s> I've seen these aplenty in video editing sweatshops. </s>
<s> It's not so much the editing that presses the CPU(s), but any effects or encoding. </s>
<s> Simple editing and you can skimp on the CPU. </s>
<s> Can I ask why your Apple contact can't discuss this? </s>
<s> Most are far more knowledgable than your usual PC dispenser. </s>

<s> Lampie is correct, two screens are going to make life much easier for you. </s>
<s> To do that you will have to get the PowerMac G5 as the iMac does not support two monitors except in mirror mode. </s>
<s> Dual Processors will churn through the work, especially with Final Cut. </s>
<s> THis is one of those programs, made by Apple, that take advantage of the OS, the hardware and the dual processors. </s>
<s> However, you will have to purchase a couple of decent monitors to do your work on. </s>
<s> If I were spending your money, two 30&quot; Apple LCD's would be superb. </s>
<s> As I'm not, you might want to look for a 30&quot; Apple and a 17&quot; something else. </s>
<s> Digital of course. </s>
<s> The other big price difference is probably due to the G5 processor and the logic board in the tower allow for a faster speed than the same processor on the iMac board. </s>
