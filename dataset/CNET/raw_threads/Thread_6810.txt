Does anyone know what works best? Is the XP pro X64 a good choice because I am using a the E8400? Thanks in advance for your assistance!

Does your application that use the IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE in the process header? Bob

The 4 gigs is to run games smoother, I hope it helps. Although 4 gigs has gotten pretty cheap, only paying about $120 on newegg.

I have seen a little payoff on just 2 games so far from 1 to 2 and those are Crysis and Bioshock. Nothing else seems to care past 2.0GB. However the number of machines going out with 4GB is phenomenal. You just wonder when the questions will stop (where's my ram?) Bob

I see what your saying though. There must be a memory ceiling and being someone who doesnt readily through money out the window, I probably wont go past 4gigs in the near future.
