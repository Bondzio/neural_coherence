<s> selling a used PC and the OS disk separately might get you more money. </s>
<s> This would only work if the disk was such as a Windows XP retail as you cannot legally sell an OEM copy for re-use. </s>

<s> unfortunately, new systems are cheap and any i5 based system will match the performance of your system. </s>
<s> add a $90 graphics card to a new $500 PC and it's better than your old PC and includes a warranty. </s>
<s> best to sell to an acquaintance (not a friend otherwise you become their tech support) who wants what you've got. </s>
