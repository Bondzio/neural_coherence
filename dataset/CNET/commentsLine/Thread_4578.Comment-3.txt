i agree with bob.
you can, as you mentioned, disable dhcp on the tplink.
connect routers lan to lan (not wan to lan).
adjust the dhcp range on the actiontec and set manual ips on 192.168.0.x but outside the dhcp range on the devices that need it.
all devices will then be on the same 192.168.0.x subnet.
should be a straightforward setup with no new equipment if that's what you're after.
