Because you are using the WAN port on the DLink, you are putting your home network devices on a separate subnet from the PS3 and STBs.
You'll need to use only the switch function on the DLink by using the LAN ports only and disabling DHCP.
IPs should be served from the Cellpipe.
I don't believe the LAN port on the STB is designed to allow you to attach devices in this manner, but if you are able to get the PS3 working this way, great!
