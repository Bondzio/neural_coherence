i've had several external drives fail, once it was a blown diode in the power section, another it was an ic on the driver board.
both times i was able to pull the actual drive and install in another case, which was very inexpensive.
remember to never unplug a powered up drive by pulling the end of the power adapter that connects to the drive, pull the 120vac side first.
there's a voltage spike when the field collapses in a inductor, etc, that can create a spike that can fail something down stream,(talking external drives that are powered with a 120vac adapter).
