I have one gig of ram memory (250 hard drive) and since my son has lots of games on it I'd like to purchase more memory. Of course he says I should buy Geil or Cosair-extreme memory. Here are two choices I found. Any advise... Corsair Memory Product Name Value Select 512MB DDR2 SDRAM Memory Technical Information Memory Size 512MB DDR2 SDRAM Number of Modules 2 x 256MB Memory Speed 533MHz DDR2-533/PC2-4200 Module Configuration 32M x 64 Error Checking Non-ECC CAS Latency CL4 Manufacturer PNY Technologies.

It says that there is 229 gb (182gb-80% free space)NTFS I don't think that more hard disk space is nessasary with all that free space. Running XP Home He has these games on. Desert Combat Battle Field 2 Call of Duty 2 Postal 2 Delta Force Black Hawlk Down I have a NVIDIA Ge Force 6800. The system gets slow some times when he is doing online gaming etc. I thought that the extra memory to juggle with might help. I don't really know anything about computers so maybe I'm wrong.

About your hard disk. 500GB MaXLine Pro 500 SATA 3.0Gb Internal Hard Drive Internal hard drive with 500GB capacity, 7200rpm spindle speed, 16MB cache buffer, 8.5ms average seek time. Beats the one you have on seek time and if your board supports it has twice the transfer rate in bursts. Bob
