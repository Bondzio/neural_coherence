NOT YOUR MODEL.
It is unsupported, unsupportable and you may not find a good answer.
For me I'd do my research on google.com To let you know how my install played out, I had to edit the BIOS (not trivial) and find drivers from another laptop model by the same maker.
While it worked out, there was NO INCREASE IN RANGE.
But I did get 802.11g capability.
The old card was 802.11b only.
I don't think such changes are for just anyone.
For example, if they complain they are not getting helped, then they should go try a PC-Card.
