<s> I just recently bought a new video card, an ATI Radeon 9250 256mb AGP card. </s>
<s> My old card was an ATI Radeon 7200 64mb AGP card. </s>
<s> When I went to switch them out my computer didn't recognize the new one yet it still runs fine with the old one. </s>
<s> Basically my monitor never recieves a signal and it gives me the error sound of a long beep followed by 2 short beeps. </s>
<s> I hooked the card up to another older computer running a Nvidia GeForce PCI card and it booted up fine. </s>
<s> The old computer is 5 years older than mine. </s>
<s> I've tried everything I can think of and I'm stumped. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> perhaps you have a mobo that can't accept an agp 4x/8x card. </s>
<s> I have an Aopen MX34 motherboard. </s>
<s> I ran some checks and looked on the site and it said the AGP port was 1x 2x and 4x. </s>
<s> This is not a problem. </s>
<s> What is a problem is, &quot;You haven't installed the new card&quot;. </s>
<s> You can't until you UNinstall the old one. </s>
<s> Open &quot;Device Manager&quot; and remove old card, go to Control Panel, Add/Remove and remove software for old card. </s>
<s> Shut down. </s>
<s> Then you can remove old card and install new card. </s>
<s> XP (or any other OS) will then see new card when you boot up. </s>
<s> A piece of advice, I have noticed on a lot of hardware (even newer stuff) will not install from XP &quot;Autorun&quot;. </s>
<s> My ATI 9250 card is one of them. </s>
<s> When you put the disc in, stop Autorun and open disc manually. </s>
<s> First read the instructions (may be README file). </s>
<s> Important. </s>
<s> Sometimes things have to installed in a certain order, and some things may not be necessary for your computer. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> When you installed the new card in the old PC and it booted up OK, were you using the same monitor or a different one? </s>
<s> It's very rare that a video card and monitor have a compatibility issue (with a particular motherboard) but I have encountered such things on very rare occasions. </s>
<s> Try a different monitor if you have one (this would be the easiest first step to trouble-shoot the problem). </s>
<s> If this doesn't work, check to see if your motherboard bios is the latest revision available. </s>
<s> If not, update and try again. </s>
<s> Does your system bios have options for AGP? </s>
<s> If so, make sure you select the right compatibility mode for your new configuration. </s>
<s> Hope this helps... Cindy </s>
<s> try booting the pc without any video card (new or old). </s>
<s> did you get the same number/sequence of beeps? </s>
<s> if so, the mobo isn't happy with the card. </s>
<s> try clearing the cmos (page 13 of your manual) using the procedure below. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Turn off the system and unplug the AC power. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Remove ATX power cable from connector PWR2. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Locate JP14 and short pins 2-3 for a few seconds. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Return JP14 to its normal setting by shorting pins 1-2. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Connect ATX power cable back to connector PWR2. </s>
<s> now try booting with the new card. </s>
<s> hope this helps. </s>
