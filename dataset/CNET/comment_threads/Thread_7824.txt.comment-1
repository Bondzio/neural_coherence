I have a Compaq Presario SR1000 and I am looking to upgrade the graphics card, but I have two questions about the one I am hoping to purchase.
1.
Will it be able to fit in/work on my computer?
2.
Will it be able to smoothly run games like CS:Source and Guild Wars.
I have already upgraded the RAM so that isn't a problem.
The graphics card is: NVIDIA GeForce 8400 GS 256MB DDR2 HDTV/DVI (PCI-Express) A link to it: http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_8400_features.html
