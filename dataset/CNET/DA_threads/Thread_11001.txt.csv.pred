1.1.1	I need to know which processor is better for gaming and overclocking because they are almost the same price and speed .	St
1.1.2	I also would like to know what the best fan/heat sink under $ 50.00 for this AM2 setup is .	St
1.2.1	the 7850 will be a bit faster , but when compared to current core2duo/quad and phenom IIs , it 's still a low-end CPU .	St
1.2.2	the 7000 series is just a dual-core k10 and the phenom ( k10 ) architecture is n't that much faster when compared to the original x2 ( k8 ) .	St
1.2.3	http : //www.hexus.net/content/item.php ? item=16614 & page=7 as for a heatsink/fan , get a boxed cpu and stick with the stock cooler .	St
1.2.4	if you want to send another $ 40 or $ 50 , do n't waste it on a cooler ... get a faster CPU like a phenom ii x3 710 .	St
