<s> I need suggestions and recommendation on what type of equipment and make/model numbers of what works well. </s>
<s> I want to set up a hime network for the following: Toshiba 42LX177 HDTV (built in RJ45 port) XBox 360 Directv HR20 HD-DVR HP Laptop with MS Vista & Intel 4965AGN Network & Bluetooth enabled Canon Pixma MP610 Printer Sirius Stiletto 100 Portable Sateliite Radio Player I do not have any service yet, but will be signing up for my local DSL service real soon. </s>
<s> The TV, Xbox 360, and DVR are all in the same entertainment center. </s>
<s> I don't mind having the DSL modem right there too when I get it, so everything could be hardwired to a router and then to the DSL modem. </s>
<s> However, I want the freedom to have wifi for the laptop so I can be in various rooms in my house to surf the web, etc... and to use my Stiletto 100 in wifi mode to listen to Sirius radio over the internet. </s>
<s> Also, I want the freedom of not having to connect the printer to the laptop directly. </s>
<s> I could use Bluetooth between the printer and laptop but I hear that Bluetooth is not as good as wifi because of range and speed issues. </s>
<s> What router(s) and other pieces of equipment do I need for my configuration. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Verizon and others are now fielding a combo DSL Modem and Wifi router so there would be no need to get another router. </s>
