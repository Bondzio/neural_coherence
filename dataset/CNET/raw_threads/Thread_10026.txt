I have seen external hard drive enclosures out there but I am not sure what to look for. Basically I want to be able to take my 3.5&quot; Maxtor 100gb drive and make it an external drive that any of my 6 computers on my network can access for backup and storage of music etc. Can someone help me with what I should look for? What do you suggest?
