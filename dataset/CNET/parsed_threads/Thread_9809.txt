<s> I want to build a PC but I have no experience with hardware. </s>
<s> I've watched tutorials on how to build a PC and done some research on hardware and this is the build I came up with. </s>
<s> I'd appreciate some feedback before I spend $900. </s>
<s> I want to be able to play games like Skyrim on at least high settings with a ton of mods. </s>
<s> This may not quite pull that off due to budget issues (or will it?). </s>
<s> Could you rate my build 1-10 for how well it should work for that? </s>
<s> Motherboard CPU GPU HDD RAM DVD PSU Case OS $861 + shipping. </s>
<s> How does this look? </s>
<s> Am I missing anything (besides monitor/mouse/keyboard)? </s>
<s> That's nine web pages to pull up. </s>
<s> I pulled just one and it was the PSU. </s>
<s> I would not buy that today. </s>
<s> I want a SINGLE 12V RAIL to avoid having to balance the rails or even having to know to do that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ram. </s>
<s> native support is 1333......don't handicap it with slow ram. </s>
<s> Psu. </s>
<s> You can get that tri-rail thing if you want. </s>
<s> I'd be looking for a single rail......600w. </s>
<s> Corsair or Pc power+cooling have some nice units. </s>
<s> Sorry, don't know how to put it all in one link. </s>
<s> What do you think of these? </s>
<s> RAM PSU </s>
<s> I have that case. </s>
<s> It's simple and sturdy but only two fans come with it. </s>
<s> I added variable speed fans in the front and keep all fans at a fairly low RPM. </s>
<s> Quiet is what I like. </s>
<s> Look here http://www.asrock.com/mb/memory.asp?Model=Z68%20Extreme3%20Gen3 I try to check a MB manufacturer's list of compatible RAM first. </s>
<s> If I can't find what's on the list, I go to Crucial dot com to see if they have the RAM known to be compatible with the board I have. </s>
<s> My budget's just about maxed out and I don't know anything about fans or how much room I'll have for one. </s>
<s> so you're going to generate heat. </s>
<s> I'm fairly certain the CPU won't overclock so that won't be an issue. </s>
<s> I don't game but I do have extra hard drives and use the 10k RPM type. </s>
<s> As well, I went with a passive cooled video card as those with fans can be noisier and need more in the way of maintenance. </s>
<s> Such are of my reasons for adding fans to the front panel. </s>
<s> It's up to you but gaming adds a different dimension. </s>
<s> You're video card will toss hot air into the case and that hot air needs to be removed. </s>
<s> You can try it without extra fans and see how it works. </s>
<s> My two extra fans cost about 30 bucks for both. </s>
<s> Psu looks fine. </s>

<s> Should work......if not look here. </s>
