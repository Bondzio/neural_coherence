And this is the second UPS! The first one was a &quot;Orbit&quot; 600 VA model, and now i have a new &quot;Street Line&quot; 1000 VA one. Both of them show precisely the same strange behaviour. When my PC is on, and the power goes out, the PC goes off too! The UPS won't back up as it is supposed to do. When i turn the UPS then off and on again, it won't start - just beeps short and stays off. If i unplug the computer (!), i can start the UPS! I can then even plug the computer back in, and boot it - so the battery in the UPS is fine and has certainly enough power to keep the computer going for more than half an hour. I tested it with several other electrical devices - all of them stay on when i simulate a power failure by switching off the breaker. I tried with a fan, my home stereo, a small washing machine (600 watts) and my 21&quot; CRT television plus satellite receiver. All of these devices nicely stay on when the power goes. So why doesn't the computer??? My computer consists of a 365 watts ENERMAX PSU which is only about a year old, a ASUS A7A-133 MoBo, ATHLON XP 1800+ CPU, 2 HDD's, 2 CD drives, every PCI slot used etc and a 17&quot; LCD monitor which is just 2 months old. The computer itself works absolutely perfect, no power problems whatsoever. I apreciate any help i can get, because i can;t just keep buying UPS's until i find one that does the job - i already have two that work just perfect with everything except my PC, and i can't refund those because they, well, work. The fault must be with the computer - somehow. Kind regards..... Thanh

Some of the early UPS's simply made a somewhat square wave, the newer [better?] ones make something that more closely approximates a sine wave. Never heard of the two brands that you mention. Maybe try one by APC, or go to their website to read up on the subject.

One is always using the battery to power the output while the battery is constantly being float charged. The other actually transfers from one to the other. If this transfer is the problem, it may be possible to go into the PC's BIOS and change the Power Management settings. Maybe set it so that the power off button has to be held in for 4 secs before it will turn the system off. One thing about an ATX system is that if you shut it off, you must wait a short time [maybe 10 or so seconds] before you can turn it on. Has to do with the discharge of capacitors in the power control circuits. Possibly the UPS causes it to momentarily shut off and then the voltage comes back before the turn on logic will work properly. Of course, this still means a reboot which is not at all what the purpose the UPS is supposed to do.

Hello, and thanks for all replies Since my PSU is rather new and of a renowned brand (Enermax) i suppose it is a good one? I don't know about wave forms tough.......... what can be done in that regards? About the &quot;handover&quot;, both of my UPS units are of the type that switches to battery when the AC power goes, you can hear the relays clicking when that happens. And all of the outlets (there are only four of them) are battery covered, yes. I describe the problem a bit more exact: If the AC power goes out (failure, or i switch the breaker) while the computer is on, the UPS along with all connected devices shuts off - it bvriefly beeps and clicks, and then dies as if the battery was empty. It will then refuse to start again, exactly as if the battery was flat - when i turn the UPS switch off and on again. However when i unplug the computer (only the machine, not monitor, printer or anything else that's on the UPS) i CAN switch the UPS back on! And once it's on i can even connect the PC again, it will stay on (this is while AC power is still off). I can then proceed to start the PC, boot normally and keep it going for quite some time before the battery REALLY goes flat. If there are other devices connected to the UPS, such as a TV, a stereo or even a rather power-hungry small washing machine, these devices will stay on (along with the UPS) when AC goes off. So it's definitely only the actual PC that's causing this UPS shutdown. And i have two different UPS's which show exactly the same behaviour, despite being of different brands and different power ratings. The issue with the &quot;wave form&quot; sounds logical to me, but what can i do about it? Shield the wires somehow? Add grounding? (my apartment has no grounding, as most electrical outlets in Bangkok are fed by only two wires). I appreciate any help i can get Kind regards..... your Thanh

That should be on a wall plug on a different circuit than your electronics if possible. The TV, stereo, etc should be on the surge-only side. The PC and anything that will lose data or be harmed by suddenly being shut off should be on one of the battery-protected plugs. If you do this and still have the same problem, I would say you may have a battery that's not taking a charge. chuck

However you didn't read it all.... - UPS has only four outlets, and all are battery-backed. No surge-only outlets available. - Washing machine is small, portable model - 600 watts only. - Washing machine, TV, stereo and fan were connected only for testing purpose, one at a time, to see if the UPS would work with them. - Battery is perfectly ok, after diconnecting computer i can restart UPS, then reconnect computer, and use as if normal. Normally connected to the UPS are computer, monitor, printer and power adaptor for external DSL modem. Problem occurs even when computer is alone connected - so problem MUST be with the computer. Kind regards.... Thanh

I'll take your word since you are looking at it. That being said, Sgt brought up an important issue. Did you run the set-up program that came with UPS? Unless you did, the computer is not tied to the UPS and will act as it has. Good luck. chuck
9046	9	172730	1913381	1912053	Thanh-BKK	5/3/06 6:24 AM	1.14663744E12	Power options? Setup program???	Hello Again thank you for replying and trying to help me. I have only once, EVER, seen a UPS here which had a serial sort of port to be hooked up with a computer, and that UPS did cost more than my computer. The only connectors that mine (both!) have are four electricity outlets, of which two are three-prong and two are two-prong, all four are backed up by the battery and have a surge protection. Further there are phone - line in and line out, which provides a surge protection as well. And that's it. No other means of connecting it to the computer, and no setup program whatsoever. When i go to the power options as suggested, it will ask for the serial port in use - narda, don't have that. This UPS is supposed to simply switch to battery power in the moment the AC goes, and it DOES that - for every device except the bloody computer. I think i am ready to give up on the whole issue and just thread is at a surge protection - better than nothing since once i had a PSU go up in smoke when they operated major welding machines at a neighbouring construction site, which luckily has become a finished apartment building meantime. With kind regards...... your Thanh

In other words, you may need a 8 millisecond rate to keep the computer going but the UPS is only switching at 10 millisecond. (these rates are not actual, just used as example) I would suspect you will find your problem there.
