have you found a solution?
i'm trying to use mine as a media center to no avail.
i've spent time on the phone with apple support and traveled 60 miles to the nearest apple store only to have it work on their small 22&quot; hdtv.
i figured it had to be an issue with the resolution.
i tried it on other tvs, and found that it connected fine on a 27&quot; and 32&quot;, but not on a 42&quot; or 47&quot;...
