I have an HP Slimline s3700y, with 2.60 GHz dual core processor, 3.00 GB RAM and running Windows 7 Home Premium (32-bit). My desktop is hard-wired to internet through Comcast high speed modem (DPC3000), which I just checked for connection speed (download 35.55 Mbps / upload 6.43 Mbps). I'm currently using a 5-year old WRT54G v5 Linksys wireless router (802.11g) for my home network which I use only for peripherals (laptop). My question is whether or not I need to upgrade my router? Would this improve wireless internet connection for my laptop. I've also got an iPad(WiFi) on the way. Is my current router sufficient for this device?

If your laptop has a N nic card then it would help to get an N router.They are all backward compatible to B and G also. I too have Comcast and was using the same router you have. I upgraded my speed and had to buy a SB6120 DOCSIS 3.0 modem for the speed tier I am on. I tried using my laptop with the old Linksys router and could not get near the speed I should. My laptop has a N nic card so I bought a Netgear 3500 N router and my laptop speeds more than doubled. Not only the speed but the distance from the router has increased considerably with a 5 bar signal. So I guess it depends on on what NIC card is in your laptop. I don't know about the ipad wifi and how that works. A word of caution, If you do get a N router stay away from Linksys. I had two of them before the Netgear and had to take them both back because I was having to re-boot them every day or the speed would go down to almost dial up speeds. I have had the Netgear for 6 weeks without any problems.
