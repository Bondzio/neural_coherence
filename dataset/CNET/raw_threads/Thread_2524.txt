I have 2GB of 400 MHz Patriot DDR RAM. If I decide to switch to Intel's new Core 2 Duo processors and, accordingly, replace my motherboard to an Intel-compatible one, would I need to buy new DDR2 RAM for the new motherboard? Or can I use my DDR RAM in the DDR2-standard motherboard? It just seems like a waste of a lot of good, fast RAM. Thank you.

As always ... read the SPECs carefully before buying ..esp the part about ...will your DDR RAM work with the new MB. VAPCMD
