I built a micro-ATX machine for my wife, all moderate components. I researched their power requirements and figured a 150-watt Antec power supply should do the job. After installing Win 2K, I always install chipset drivers first, then ZoneAlarm, then Norton AV and hit the 'Net for updates. When I tried to open IE, spontaneous crash & reboot. Hmmm. After several repeats, I booted into Safe Mode, all was well, but when I booted normally and tried to run an app the crashes returned. Figuring the machine was underpowered, I schlepped off to Fry's to get a 350W ATX PSU. After shoehorning it into the case, imagine my surprise when the same incident occurred. I had purchased the mobo with the CPU installed and figured the assembler might have messed up the install, but before I went to that extreme (there was a piece of tape saying Warranty Void if Removed) I re-traced my steps and realized my problems started when I installed NAV. I re-booted into Safe Mode, removed Norton, and voila! Problem solved. I re-installed Norton and updated, machine ran SiSoft Sandra's burn-in routine with no problems. I guess there was some conflict between ZoneAlarm and Norton, or just a bad software install, for whatever reason. I've heard of bad drivers, bad PSUs & bad CPU installation causing this problem, never a bad install of software. Keep this info in the back of your head for the future. Anyone wanna buy a PSU?
