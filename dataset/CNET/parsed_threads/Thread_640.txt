<s> I want to use my new pc to record tv shows, burn cd's and dvd's, digital photography and eventually video. </s>
<s> I'm seriuously considering buying this package (17'' LCD, Canon printer)which doesn't have a TV tuner/remote for $999: GTW 835GM Pentium D processor 820 Dual-core processing 1024MB of DDR2 RAM 250GB 7200RPM hard drive Dual DVD drives Windows XP Media Center or for $1229 I could get this one (same bundle) with the TV tuner/remote: Gateway - 830 Media Center Desktop 840GM Intel Pentium D processor 830; DL DVDRW/CD-RW and DVD-ROM drives; 250GB hard drive; 1GB PC4200 DDR2 memory; Windows XP Media Center 2005; TV tuner; 8-in-1 media manager My question is would it be cheaper and easy enough for an intermediate pc user like myself to buy and install a tv tuner card? </s>
<s> Are the USB tuners an easier option? </s>
<s> What about the remote? </s>
<s> Can I buy that too? </s>
<s> I realize the processor is slightly faster but I doubt I would notice the difference. </s>
<s> The tv-tuner one. </s>
<s> Because 830=2x3.0ghz and 820=2x2.8ghz. </s>
<s> But i do believe that both contains a tv-tuner. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> yes. </s>
<s> it will include a remote and the IR connector. </s>
<s> go the 830gm. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> I was actually at Best Buy the other day and asked why the 840GM was $200 more and the salesman told me because of the slightly newer/faster processor and because it had the TV tuner card where the 835GM did not (he even turned the thing around and checked). </s>
<s> I thought this was totally retarded for a thousand dollar ''media pc'' to not have the card already. </s>
<s> After all, isn't being able to watch and record TV the biggest feature of using XP Media Center? </s>
<s> Just get the emachines t6522 than, it includes one. </s>
<s> Only downside is lack of dual-core and btx chassis. </s>
<s> If you really want, suggest getting the 835GM, because a better tv-tuner card such as the all-in-wonder x600pro pci-express card can be had for less than the difference of $200. </s>

<s> Thanks for the links, masta. </s>
<s> I just got back from BB (I hate that place. </s>
<s> Third time there, third bad experience with sales help.) </s>
<s> So I was gonna shell out the extra $200 for the 840GM and I realized they jacked up the price to $1399! </s>
<s> It was on sale for $1229 on Wednesday and the tag said sale price good thru 08/13. </s>
<s> I even got the sales guy to confirm this and I told him I'd be back to buy it this weekend. </s>
<s> The guy today tells me their sale always ends on Saturday and a new one begins on Sunday. </s>
<s> Whatever! </s>
<s> While I was waiting for some help I actually took a peak at an HP with Media Center and I really didn't like the way it works anyway. </s>
<s> All those giant icons and step by step instructions on how to do stuff like play a CD or look at your digital photos. </s>
<s> It's like they designed MC for complete retards! </s>
<s> I guess it was a blessing in disguise that the sale ended. </s>
<s> I'm gonna start re-shopping for another pc with XP home and just buy a tuner card. </s>
<s> Thanks again for the links! </s>
