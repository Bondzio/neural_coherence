I have an Adelphia cable modem. I am able to access the internet with all three pc's now. BUT, I am unable to receive email using Outlook express or Outlook, I always used both O. Express and Outlook before, but now I can only send using them. I am still able to receive emails if I go to Adelphia's website, and I put my emails forwarded to my gmail account, and I can receive my email thru gmail as well as my gmail, I just cannot receive thru OE or Outlook. I get a failed error mess. {Protocol POP3, Port-995, Secure (SSL) no, Socket error 10060, error #0X800CCCOE} message. No setting with OE or Outlook were changed. Gmail was forwarded to OE, and will not receive there either. Neither Linsys cust. serv. nor Netgear were able to help, and Adelphia won't.

There are many discussions about this on google, but 1492 seems to be needed for this to work. -&gt; Please supply what you've tried so that I'll know to not duplicate your efforts. If you firewalled it off, installed an email virus scanner or more, this has not been shared so I have not mentioned any solution that involved those products. Bob

If I remember right, I also increased it. I still had no luck. This was several weeks ago, then I got busy again with work, and had no time to work on it, just worked around the issue, thus I found out that I could forward to my gmail account and receive my Adelphia account emails there. I really like using Outlook and O Express tho, and would like to go back to using them, not to mention it makes me crazy trying to figure this out. I have AVG installed on all three pc's, and use Sygate for my firewalls. I have tried shutting everything off even, but didn't make a differance.

I'll keep asking for the revision number you're at if you don't mind since it matters. -&gt; What revision firmware is in the router? Review http://www.tiscali.co.uk/help/email/oe_errors_0x800ccc0e.html on how to telnet to your email server to see if that works. Bob

Decided to update firmware again (just in case I didn't last time, tho I thought I did.) The Lynksys tech's had me doing a lot of differant things. I downloaded the firmware file (1.46.2) , but when I try to upgrade, it begins to load, then stops, and tells me {upgrade action is not finished. Upgrade file pattern error}. It then gives me the option to browse for the d/l firmware file again. Could this be because I already upgraded the firware a few weeks ago? Also, went to the link you provided regarding the OE error. After typing in the telnet pop.tiscali.co.uk 110 and clicking enter, it says connecting to telnet pop.tiscali.co.uk 110, and then it says {Couldn't open connection to the host or port, 23: Connect Failed. Using my xp pc, I tried resetting the TCP/IP stack, but that didn't do anything either. Thanks for any help you have given so far, or that you may still give. Diane

Proffitt	8/31/05 2:34 PM	1.12549884E12	I think the telnet was flubbed.	http://www.yccc.org/Resources/DXCluster/images/telnet3.gif shows how to run telnet and get that port number but 23 is incorrect and that effort needs a retry. As it stands I'm not convinced it's your machine at issue. My question is what firmware is in your BEFRS11. Which I may have missed your answer. Can you tell me again? -&gt; As to resetting the TCPIP stack, that's not a feature of XP. However WINSOCKXPFIX does help recover from some malware. But given I haven't seen the last 2 items completed, it's a hit or miss whether that would help. Cheers, Bob

How would I go about finding out what firmware is in my BEFSR11 now? As I said, I tried to upgrade to 1.46.2 since I was unsure if I had already done that when Linsys's tech's were trying to help me. I don't know what firmware is there currently, nor do I know how to go about finding out. Diane

11337	12	123000	1395565	1395382	mrshacksaw	8/31/05 6:55 PM	1.1255145E12	got as far as the password!	When I type in the password, I get ERR no domain specified or invalid domain specified. Does this mean that possibly my password has become corrupt?
11337	13	123000	1396796	1395565	mrshacksaw	9/1/05 1:58 PM	1.12558308E12	was it something I said?	humm????lol

Cheers on getting to the password but since you didn't get past that, I'm of the mind the issue is not with OL/OE quite yet. Have your ISP reset your password for that account. Bob
11337	15	123000	1397306	1397118	mrshacksaw	9/1/05 8:35 PM	1.1256069E12	You have to work??	What!, they don't pay you for all your hard work and advice here? lol. Just kidding with you. I will have my ISP reset my password, tho it probably won't be till this weekend or so. I too have to work and make money, to buy Gas for my auto, or course. Diane
