ok so ... i got my router installed and working!
here is my review with the experience so far.
delivery- came fast and easy.. i ordered from amazon.com and the cost after rebate was a little over $200.00 !
$386.94 plus tax with a $200 rebate!
installation- i had my local stereo store install it under my seat for $50!
they told me it took about 30 min!
performance- first off.. one thing i learned that the autonet router does that i didn't know it could do is the system actually manages the data for you as well as the connection to the towers, lets say you are moving down the highway ...uploading a document and you lose connection to the tower...... autonet will put the upload on pause.. and resume once you re-establish connection.
this means you won't lose the data you are transmitting or send half of a document .. possibly corrupting a database.
amazing!
i would say autonet is pretty spot on with what they claim.
it seems to work seemlessly while in motion.... much better than my cell card did.
i am able to stream pandora without choppyness or lag ... i will say that every now and then you may get a second of hiccup but it's not enough to annoy you.... like once every 30 minutes.
video streaming also works pretty good... granted it's still a 3g connection so the loading can be a little combersome but once it's starts streaming i have noticed very little hiccuping.
it's for sure better than a cell card.
range-autonetmobile claims you can use it up to 150 ft from the vehicle and i would say this is accurate.
i didn't bust out a tape measure but i was about 120-140 ft away with no problems.
all in all i would say i feel really good about the price and the performance... in the long run it will save me money for sure ... my cell card was costing me about $80 per month on average and autonet is $29 flat rate.
no taxes, no overages, no roaming.
i am definitely excited to road trip it up now!!!
