<s> We just built a brand new system about two months ago...specs as follows: Gigabyte GA-M55SLI-S4 Motherboard AMD Athlon 64 3800+ W/512KB Cache PQI DII800 RAM (2 sticks @ 1 GIG each) PSU Rosewill RP550V2-D-SL 550 Watt Power supply VGA EVGA GF 7600GS Video Card 300GB SATA Drive from Seagate DVD +/-RW NEC DVD burner I run Windows XP and Office 2003 Professional with Contact manager (Actually use the SQL Server) My system locks-up on average of once per day. </s>
<s> This means every thing freezes completely. </s>
<s> Mouse doesn't work , can't warm boot...nothing. </s>
<s> The only thing that works is a hard reset. </s>
<s> When this happens if I've been on line, the entire history of what I've been doing is gone. </s>
<s> For example, if I was doing a search online, if I start to reenter the web address of where I was before the lock-up, it won't have any record in history. </s>
<s> Very strange! </s>
<s> Lately, it's getting a little more elaborate. </s>
<s> It may actually completely reboot itself out of the blue. </s>
<s> It will just shutdown in the middle of what I'm doing, by suddenly blanking out the screen and completely rebooting the entire system (as if I were rebooting after installing new software). </s>
<s> Yesterday, the system went down in the middle of my work and when the system tried to reboot, it froze at the start-up screen. </s>
<s> We tried shutting it completely down and restarting several times but it just stopped at the start-up screen (never checked memory or anything). </s>
<s> Finally we shut the power off from the back and when we tried another cold boot it finally worked. </s>
<s> It crashed once again after that. </s>
<s> This is serious...I work from home and this is my work computer...this has got to stop!!! </s>

<s> Are you getting a blue screen? </s>
<s> Please post the hexadecimal code reported on the blue screen. </s>
<s> It seems like a software/hardware conflict. </s>
<s> Also, right click on My Computer|Manage|Device Manager; check to make sure that no device is reporting an error. </s>

<s> Make sure heatsink is properly seated and fan is running. </s>
<s> And that there is good thermal compound. </s>
<s> Right after this happens, you should reboot and go into your BIOS. </s>
<s> Somewhere in there there will be a heath monitor, check the temp. </s>
<s> levels. </s>
<s> Another way is to simply look at all your fans inside your case, in particular, your northbridge fan. </s>
<s> I've seen numerous systems have very strange problems, reboots, and lockups due to a faulty northbridge fan. </s>
