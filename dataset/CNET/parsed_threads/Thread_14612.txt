<s> We had a power outage last week and our desktop computer no longer powers on. </s>
<s> We have since bought a new laptop and would like to see if we can recover the data off the old Desktop internal hard drive. </s>
<s> (I am assuming that there is no problem with the old drive). </s>
<s> What is the easiest way to retreive that old data from old computer? </s>
<s> Is there a way to make the old drive a USB drive? </s>
<s> Maybe make it a slave drive? </s>
<s> (not sure if that is right terminology.... Any easy suggestions would be helpful! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
