at least here in england some companies offer loads of extrs (like family tree maker) but ask yourself are you really going to get much joy from them?
many software titles are old programs that you are likely to get at a shop's bargain section anyway - or almost an identical one from a rival company.
only look at bundled package if you are deciding between two equally good computers!!
if you are buying a ready-made computer, you can usually expect an operating system.
other ''standard'' software packages usually include a trial periods of isp and virus checker.
some better software packages may offer an office suite, such as ms works and ready installed free firewall and anti-spam/spyware programs (free or trial versions)so you are protected from malware straight away.
a pc bundle might even contain ''free'' scanner and printer, but ultimately you are paying for it.
it might seem to work out cheaper than the cost of scanner and printer separately, but check that you are happy with the quality and running cost - bundled hardware is often either flimsy, printer are results poor or buying ink is very expensive, or both, or in case of, say cameras, the resolution is so very poor - don't expect any (useful) manuals!
somewhere the manufacturer has to cut corners!
