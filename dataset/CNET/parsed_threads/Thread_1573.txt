<s> http://www.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-tab-2-7-0 seems to have a lot of folk asking questions today. </s>
<s> My question is &quot;What is steel capture?&quot; As to the video watching, playback apps are widely available now so if one player does not do what you want, why not try another? </s>

<s> i just missed out...i means many of samsung phone dosnt have the zoominf facility while video recording and the time of image capture..dats y im asking 4...it has d facility or nt? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Sorry but with the misspellings and typographic errors I can barely guess what the questions are. </s>
<s> Tablets do not substitute for a camera or camcorder. </s>
<s> But keep in mind that any &quot;app&quot; can be replaced so if the supplied app does not do &quot;steel capture&quot; why would we not look for a replacement for better captures of steel images? </s>
<s> As of my posting there are 10 more hours on that sale and they were not sold out. </s>

<s> u r not entering into my point .....i just asked u dat the camera has the zooming facility or not?? </s>
<s> u can simply tell yes or no... </s>
<s> the(d)...dnt get confused on that.. </s>
<s> You are using shortened words such as u instead of YOU and then &quot;dat&quot; and &quot;steel capture&quot; without correcting your posts. </s>
<s> I can't enter into your point if you don't use English or correct your posts. </s>
<s> But if you are asking if the camera has zoom, it's clear from the specifications at http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxytab2/7.0/spec.html?type=find that it does not have zoom or compare with any digital camera or camcorder. </s>
