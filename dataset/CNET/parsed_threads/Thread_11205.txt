<s> Without switching out my MOBO, Im looking to get the most out of the upgrade potential for my current Socket 939 system. </s>
<s> By the middle of next year, I will build a new system around an AMD AM2 board or Intel Core Duo CPU, but I dont want to jump into that until then. </s>
<s> In the meantime, again, Im looking to figure out the best upgrade options for my current system. </s>
<s> My main priority is to get the most gaming potential from my current system as possible: I play BF2, COD/COD2, Oblivion, Red Orchestra, Day of Defeat mostly FPS games. </s>
<s> For my job I also multi-task quite a bit with internet browsers and the Office suite (I dont really do any DVD/CD burning or anything like that). </s>
<s> With the fall of the AMD 64 X2 prices, my immediate reaction was to grab a 3800+ X2 (or higher) and another gig of ram. </s>
<s> However, Im unsure about the performance gain Ill get from the new CPU and Ive heard that if I fill up all four of my memory slots that my system will only run my RAM at 333 rather than 400 (is this true). </s>
<s> So, Im wondering if I can get a significant performance gain by 1. </s>
<s> and see what that shows about the CPU options and their performance with ganes and other apps. </s>
<s> 2GBs DDR400 is fairly cheap if the games in question load and run faster with 2GB vs 1 GB. </s>
<s> The other thing is there are some 'transition' MB ..like the one from ASRock VSTA (see review at Anandtech.com) that allows you to run a Conroe with DDR, DDR2, AGP or PCIe. </s>
<s> And it's very modestly priced. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Hello, I just upgraded from a 3000+ to a 4000+ & it is a substantial improvement. </s>
<s> It's like a new computer. </s>
<s> Not that it wasn't fast before, it's just noticeably faster now. </s>
<s> I got the San Diego core from NewEgg for 135. </s>
<s> 2.4GHz tooling along at 2.7Ghz & it's not even breaking a sweat. </s>
<s> I didn't opt for a dual-core. </s>
<s> I just don't think there are enough applications out there to support it yet. </s>
<s> I believe multicore is the way of the future, but the benefits don't justify the cost, at this time. </s>
<s> Your memory is fine, for now. </s>
<s> Take the extra money & put it towards a new video card. </s>
<s> You can use a video card in your next PC. </s>
<s> Look into the 7600GT, 7900GT or a X1900XT. </s>
<s> My PC games like never before. </s>
<s> Enjoy! </s>
<s> athlon 64 x2 4200+, $199 inc. shipping (zipzoomfly) radeon x1900gt, $202 inc. shipping (newegg) if you prefer nvidia, an xfx 7900gt is $240 inc. shipping after rebate now. </s>
<s> if you wait a week or two, the 7950gt will be out and the 7900gt should drop to $210 or lower. </s>
<s> both the x1900gt and 7900gt will be faster than dual 7600gt. </s>

<s> If you don't want to wait, then that X1900GT is good; this X1800XT is a little better: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814195019 </s>
