My cable modem is on a DHCP network. I have plugged my laptop directly into the modem and can surf fine. However, once I connect the router back up, it will only stay connected for 5 minutes. At first I thought it was the connection between my laptop and the router, but when I connected via a cable I had the same issue. I then tried to log into the router itself via wireless and sure enough I was able to. I have changed out the cable with a known working one, and that didn't solve the problem. Any ideas why the router would be dropping the connection after about 5 minutes? David
