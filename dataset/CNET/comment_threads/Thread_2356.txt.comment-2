When you get a failure can you access the router from your hardwire PC.
If you cannot get into the management screens then the router has a large issue.
If you can get in you need to dig around and see if there are any interesting messages in the log or if any of the tables look overloaded.
Things like getting the NAT table full or DHCP errors.
If it was only your wireless then I would look at different stuff.
Even though you have a N router if you connect B or G devices the router will slow down.
Some routers will attempt to switch back and forth and get locked up but they fixed that with firmware on the model I know did that.
Still you should lock your router to the slowest device you intend to support.
To use N you need to upgrade everything and lock it to N only.
