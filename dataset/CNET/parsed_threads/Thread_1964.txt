<s> I ahve a wireless network in my house which has two laptops on it, and on desktop wired to it. </s>
<s> The router is a Microsoft MN-700. </s>
<s> One of the laptops connects easily, automatically, and consistently. </s>
<s> The other laptop, a gateway, is running Windows XP Pro and it cannot connect. </s>
<s> It has an Intel Pro/Wireless LAN 2100 3B mini PCI adapter. </s>
<s> It is built-in, as that laptop has a centrino chip package. </s>
<s> A ballon pops up saying that &quot;One or more wirelss networks ar available.&quot; I can actually pick up my own network and my neighbor's. </s>
<s> After clicking on mine, it reverts back to the ballon popping up. </s>
<s> Using this same method, i can connect to my neighbor's, but i would prefer using my own network. </s>
<s> I know i have the WEP correct, but i do not know what else to do. </s>
<s> I have tried to ping my router, but it fails. </s>
<s> What else should I try? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help Michael </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> I know how to change channels on the router, but how can I make the laptop search on only one specific channel? </s>
