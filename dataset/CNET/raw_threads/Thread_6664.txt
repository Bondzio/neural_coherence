If you use firewire on on your pc you may want to get one with that it is suppose to be faster. However I use a usb external case and it works fine. If you look around you will probably get a full kit with a hard drive for the price of a hard drive alone. There are great benifits to having one of these kicking around.

Some of the more expensive cases will have better cooling features. So think about how long you will want to run one. They can get quite warm. I put a fan beside mine when I use them. Can't hurt.
