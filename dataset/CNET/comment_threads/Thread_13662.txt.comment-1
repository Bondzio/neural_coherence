Hi I have a toshiba tablet laptop and lost my software modem (agere).
It intially had com3 but wasn't working working after loading (I think) bluetooth stacking software so I thought I would just uninstall and delete the modem for it to auto find itself again.
No such luck.
I downloaded the modem software with drivers from toshiba-used their delete program and reinstalled.
Still no modem.
I tried to add 56k standard modem but there were no com ports in the dialog box.
I have a usb printer on com4 that works fine.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Alan
