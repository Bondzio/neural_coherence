my mickey mouse phone company (citizen's telecom/frontier communications) wants an arm and a leg to &quot;rent&quot; their 356k dsl wireless modem each month.
but they say i can buy one from a third party, & they'll hook it up for $25.
i'd like to be able to buy & intall one myself, but i'm not sure which type i'll need, which manufacturer is best.
gateway, 2 wire, or whichever company can provide the cheapest that will do the job.
i am a senior citizen, running mac osx10.4.11.
can anyone advise me?
every penny counts.
thanx
