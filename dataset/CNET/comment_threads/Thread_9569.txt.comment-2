Dollars to donuts that it's heat related.
Heat has probably weakened some part on it.
Keyboard may just have dirt or crumbs in it, give it a good upside down shaking, or vacuum it, or none of that exist there, use a straw and blow.
When it fails to boot does it power off, or just freeze while fan on cpu continues to blow?
If you replace the laptop, get something low power that can take a hot climate.
