i purchased a dell studio 1555 laptop with windows vista home premium sp1 in october.
after few days whenever i hibernated the system it automatically booted up after 1 or 2 hrs.
when i called the dell support for help they told that this is occuring because of hard disk failure and they will replace the hard disk.
the present hard disk contains the factory created system image which i want to migrate to my new hard disk but i have no idea on how to do that.
i tried using the windows backup and resstore utility but it didn't helped as it was not backing up some of the vital files.
please help as soon as possible as the dell technician to replace the hard disk will be coming in 3-4 days.
