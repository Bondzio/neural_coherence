Unlike the Mac, the PC is fun as you find all the drivers for motherboard, network card that Microsoft does not supply.
DO NOT use Microsoft as a source for the drivers.

There can be a power save setting in the USB and network card.
Set it to &quot;disable.&quot; In closing, I only guide and never supply step by step instructions.
