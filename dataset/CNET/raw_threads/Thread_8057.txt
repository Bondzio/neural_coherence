Anyone know of a blu-ray (bd/dvd/cd of course) player that is just a reader and does not have any writer capabilities? my company is going to be implementing a policy soon where no devices that can store (write) data can be connected to our computers. A bunch of us watch movies or tv episodes from a disc during lunch so this is going to be a problem to find a solution (can't do streaming from netflix, hulu, cloud, u.v., etc. either). An internal which i could slip into an enclosure would work too but haven't seen one. the new company policy is a knee jerk reaction to a former employee who dumped a large portion of one of our network drives a long time ago, and also a doomsday fear of some malware/virus running a muck. it's being driven by someone from HR who is very excessively unsavy with regards to IT and the like. even our system administrator is not thrilled having this implemented hehe. Oh well, thanks for any info/advice in advance.

I'm going to shortchange you here as you can find/vet/read the specs. http://www.amazon.com/LITE-ON-IHOS104-06-Blu-Ray-Buffer-Memory/dp/B005HN1F8G Case? Too many out there. http://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-5-25-Inch-Drive-Enclosure-EC-ST5B/dp/B002MALMRG to start And NO Blu-Ray player software is included. Due to licensing and more there is no free software player yet. Bob
