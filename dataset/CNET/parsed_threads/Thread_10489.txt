<s> I've got a 1GB HP PAV Processor and am supposed to have 128MB of SDRAM only 92 MB show up on the Performance Tab. </s>
<s> Any ideas where my memory has gotten to? </s>
<s> I've tried shutting down down drivers one at a time to find a change.....no dice. </s>
<s> Do you have a separate video card or is this on your MB. </s>
<s> If the later, your RAM might be shared with video and your system will not report that portion. </s>
<s> Your system probably uses build-in video which uses system ram for its own reserved use. </s>
<s> In some cases you can +/- that value to suit your needs. </s>
<s> It then either uses some vendor utility or the setting value in the bios. </s>
<s> You can't defeat it, if you continue to use the build-in video. </s>
<s> Otherwise, if capable get a video card that directly installs and uses it own ram. </s>
<s> You needn't woryy about it and you add more ram if you have available ram slots open -OR- swap out the ram for a larger mb size in its place. </s>
<s> Hope this helps... good luck -----Willy </s>
