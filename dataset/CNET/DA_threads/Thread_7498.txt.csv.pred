1.1.1	I have a total of four Maxtor hard drives ( all are Ultra DMA 133 ) that I am trying to decide which one to use as my main drive .	St
1.1.2	The others will be used as storage drives .	St
1.1.3	My main uses of the computer are web browsing , games and video editing .	St
1.1.4	I have an MSI K8N Neo2 Platinum mainboard , Athlon 64 3500 cpu , 1 GB memory and am using a BFG 6800 GT video card ( nVidia ) .	St
1.1.5	All of this is running Windows XP .	St
1.1.6	My four choices ( actually only three since one drive is a Maxtor External , 300 GB Firewire/USB drive ) are : - 80 GB Maxtor D740X ( Model 6L080J4 ) 2 MB cache , 7200 rpm , & lt ; 8ms seek time - 160 GB Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 ( 6Y160P0 ) 8 MB cache , 7200 rpm , 9.3 ms seek time - 250 GB Maxtor Maxline Plus II ( 7Y250P0 ) 8 MB cache , 7200 rpm , 9 ms seek time Any opinions are welcome !	St
1.2.1	I would use the 250 GB as your main drive due to the large volume requirements needed for games & video editing .	St
1.3.1	My preference is to use the smaller drive for the OS and applications .	St
1.3.2	80gigs will hold a ton of these .	Sug
1.3.3	Your 80gig shows quicker specs but I am not certain that is correct with a 2meg cache , however .	St
1.3.4	You do want your main drive to perform well .	St
1.3.5	The larger drives are well suited for storage and can be used as backups for other data .	St
1.3.6	I have mine done this way and use imaging software to backup my entire hard drive as a compressed image on larger secondary drives as part of my distaster recovery scheme .	St
1.3.7	In the end , however , your opinion and needs outweigh all outside advice .	St
1.3.8	Good luck with your project .	Polite
1.4.1	Can you recommend any software benchmark programs that are available to actually test these and get real test info ?	Ques
1.5.1	I do n't use them .	St
1.5.2	A bullet at 2500fps and one at 2550fps are both faster than my eyes can blink .	St
1.5.3	I believe some use one called SiSandra which may have a free version .	St
1.5.4	I will let you do the Google search .	Sug
1.5.5	Good luck .	Polite
