i recently had the same problem with a toshiba 640gb drive.
tried all of the recovery software outthere, some found my data, and some did not.
what i did do and restored my data was something that you already own.
it is chkdsk.
as a last resort i before spent any money i tried chkdsk, which is part of all versions of windows.
first make sure you are logged in a the administrator.
then click on the start button, for windows 7 type in cmd in the search program and files window.
this will bring you to the command prompt.
then type chkdsk ?:.
the ?
represents the drive letter.
use the last known drive letter used.
if the program runs and returns alot of data about the drive, then run it again with the /f switch.
chkdsk ?
: /f.
it will then fix the problem and you will now be able to see your files.
good luck!
