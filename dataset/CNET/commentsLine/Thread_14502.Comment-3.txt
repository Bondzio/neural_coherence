first question would be does your isp use or plan to use docsis3.
you fried modem does not support this.
of course you also have to ask if they charge extra to use this feature.
if all your equipment is g band then you will see little difference in any of the linksys routers you mention.
the primary difference is if you need wired gig (streaming hd video inside your house would be a example) , or if you need to run on the 5ghz band (your pc would need a wireless card that was compatible).
do you buy a combo router/modem is a tougher question.
it will generally be cheaper to buy a combo but your selection of feature and brands is somewhat limited.
you also of course would need to replace the unit if you changed technology say to dsl,fios,uverse.
since the amount of money is not huge i would go for separate units since you can pick the features that meet your needs the best.
