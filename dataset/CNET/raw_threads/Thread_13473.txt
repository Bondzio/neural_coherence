1064	0	178095	1953164	NR	marcherr	5/22/06 2:21 PM	1.14830766E12	PC Rebuild	I am in the process of rebuilding my PC. I have a new Asrock K7S41GX motherboard; 400W Power supply unit; 512MB DDR 333Mhz & 256Mb PC2100 & an 80GB HDD. I am fairly comfortable with building PCs from scratch as I have successfully done quite a number previous in the past. However, this time around, I am having difficulties. The problem I am encountering is that, when I switch the PC on, it just kicks in and the powers off. If I press the power button again, it does not respond - it's just dead. If I pull out the mains power supply cable off the case completely and replug, it restarts and powers off again. I have checked all my connections according to the manual and am certain it's all correct. This has left me baffled hence the SOS. Anybody with an antidote will be welcome. Cheers

Then try to boot. See if it stays on ( you should get a continuos beep for no memory) If it doesn't stay on, it's either the power supply, switch on the case, or the motherboard. There is also a chance that the motherboard is touching the metal of your case, so take the board out of the case. Be careful to set it on a non conductive surface and try it again. If you get the same results, its either one of the above. Get a power supply tester from your local computer shop to test the power supply. If it does stay powered on with a repeatitive beep, add one thing at a tme until you get the probelm reproduced. Hope this helps!

I've had the same problem 2 times with separate asrock mobo but always was the power supply the issue. I discovered that if I left the on button pushed for 5 seconds and then pushed again I can recreate kick off problem (the computer powers on briefly and the shut down).

Appararently, my CPU fan was inadequate, the processor over-heated and cut-off. Once again, thanks for the suggestions. I am sure they will come handy one day. Cheers.
