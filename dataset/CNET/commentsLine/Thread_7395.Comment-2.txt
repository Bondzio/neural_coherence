numbered either slot/bank or whatever as 0[zero].
the first digit of all number systems is zero, however we humans tend to start with one, and some mobo mfr's mark the first slot as one.
as to whether it will make a meaningful difference, i would doubt it.
might depend on the size of the cpu's onboard cache.
