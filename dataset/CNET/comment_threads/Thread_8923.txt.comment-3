Could I use Acronis Disk Director to copy disk to an external?
and then what do I do install both drives and then set it u via the bios?
Also how do I restore the system copy from the external at that point.
I am pretty nervous.
Also how do I find If I have the right drivers installed?
and wouldn't those be on the motherboard?
Thanks.
