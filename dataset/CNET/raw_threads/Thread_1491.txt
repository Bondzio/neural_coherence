15307	0	357625	3119402	NR	Edgar Nelson	9/4/09 10:05 AM	1.2520587E12	Canon printer problem	Yesterday when I tried to print something, I got a message that the printer was not responding. The amber screen on the printer was telling me to &quot;Insert Cartridge&quot;. I have tried several things, up to and including changing all the print cartridges. No change. I tried to print and the printer driver returned the error message &quot;Install Print Head&quot;. I did not remove anything. I suspect that what is generating the errors is a malfunction on the part of the printer and is not user serviceable. A quick search of the web turns up nothing specific to my printer (Pixma MP780), but some web posts do talk about replacing the print head. How easy is this? Is the printer worth taking in for service? 2009 iMac 20&quot; OSX 10.5.8 Thanks

If you've expended all the usuals, read the fine manual then my advice is to make ONE call to Canon's repair center to ask how much. If it exceeds that of a new printer, then it's a much easier decision. If the printer is 24 months or older, I also say replace it. Bob

Since I posted my query, I was able to locate and remove the print head. I am not sure if I have it in properly, but I doubt the problem was the print head becoming &quot;unshipped&quot;. There is no change in the printer's error message. It's amazing how regardless of use or cost, they never seem to last more than three years. Thanks

It's not a sure thing so the problem I run into is &quot;do you feel lucky?&quot; That is, how much is that print head and is it worth the risk. I think you agreed the printer was over 2 years so even if that was it, what's next? Bob
