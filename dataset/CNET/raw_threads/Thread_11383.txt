I plan to upgrade the following components as my 670 gtx is perfectly fine: i7 920 ===&gt; i5 3570k ASUS P6T ===&gt; ASUS P8Z77-V PRO Windows 7 premium 64 ===&gt; Windows 8 Do you think there is a need right now if my primary purpose is gaming (Planetside 2 for example)? My i7 920 is stock and overclocking on air is not an option where I live especially during summer.

I doubt it will much. W7&gt;W8......No......Let the dust settle with W8. Get enough ram that the swap file stays quiet while your gaming. If your games are hammering your HD for data......think about a SSD or a hybrid.

I'm sure you read this.	&quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. &quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html A long time ago tests changing motherboards yielded single digit performance changes. Rarely pays off. The same thing with OS changes but 7 does have an edge on compatibility for now. Bob
