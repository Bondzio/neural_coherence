I do not want the autorun option menus to come up, just the program to launch. I need it to do this for any computer it is attached to. Is that possible?

When I try to set this up, Windows doesn't just run the program. It gives a list of options, one of which is to run the program. I want it to just go directly to setup.exe when the drive is inserted.
