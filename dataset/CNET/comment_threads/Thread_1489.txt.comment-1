My current system (custom build that started out as an upgrade) Core 2 Duo E6750 2.66 (wanted a quad but the budget rules) Gigabyte G31MX-S2 2 GB Corsair DDR2 667MHz Nividia GeForce 8600GT 256MB DDR3 memory Hard Drives - 1x500GB SATA 2x250GB SATA 1x320GB SATA 1x80GB EIDE Windows Vista Home Premium 32 bit Hi All This is my first post here at CNET Forums and I would first of all,like to say thank you to all the posters here for all the great information.Now to get to my question.I was thinking about running SLi or Crossfire but I would need to upgrade my present motherboard due to the fact that it has only 1 PCI-e x16 slot.I was inquiring about it at a local computer shop,and the tech there said he didn`t recommend it or suggest it due to the fact that its not all that its is made out to be.He went further and said it had something to do with the 2 PCI-e x16 slots are not able to run at the same speed.WEhat he suggests to do is just buy a really good GPU,something with lots of DDR3 memory.Now what I don`t know is if he is just giving me his view or is there something out there to merit what he is telling me.If someone can give me some input on this I would be very greatful.Thanks and happy computing.
