Problem is that they are a different region as the US. This wouldn't be such a problem but it seems like everything is equipped with these lame region restrictions. The most problematic at this time is my DVD-RW drive. Apparently you can only change it's region a limited number of times and I have reached the limit. My question for all the geekier people out there than myself is what can I do to beat the region problem? below is link to a screen shot of the driver region status for the DVD-RW which is basically saying I'm screwed. BTW I have a eMachines T6410 (I know it's lame) Any help or advice at all would be greatly appreciated! Thanks, Paul http://lh3.ggpht.com/Pkr8ch/SAqgLXsb9nI/AAAAAAAAAM0/x_JHFrhOgj0/s400/screwed.jpg

That's why I was looking for a permanent solution to the problem that would allow me to basically forget that there was a such thing as different region codes.
