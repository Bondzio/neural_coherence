<s> I want to know what is the best graphics card and power supply I can get for my Dell Inspiron 580. </s>
<s> Here are my current specs. </s>
<s> Operating System: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU 760 @ 2.80GHz (4 CPUs), ~2.8GHz Memory: 8192MB RAM Card name: ATI Radeon HD 5450 Wattage: 300 W (I have a 500 W power supple someone gave me if I can match a good graphics card that can run games like Skyrim at top settings that can run on 500 W that would be ideal, if not I have no problem upgrading) As stated, my intentions for the PC is being able to play games like Skyrim at top settings, and if possible be able to record games without it causing too much FPS lose. </s>
<s> My spending limit would probably be 500, not much more than that. </s>
<s> I know I will not be able to get top of the line Graphics card, but I am not looking for top of the line, but the top of the line I can get for 500 (In combination with a power supply, and if need be a new case) </s>
<s> I'd have to know what amperage the +12V is rated for then I'd look at this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html As to recording games, I'm going to shortchange you. </s>
<s> This is well discussed and as long as your host is doing the recording you will be repeating all that has been discussed to date. </s>
<s> The answer is no. </s>

<s> The PSU I have that is 500 Watt is a Antec Basiq BP500U 500W ATX12V V2.3 80MM Quiet Fan ATX Active PFC Power Supply. </s>
<s> The stock one is not good enough for an higher graphics card I already know that much. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371004 shows two +12V rails at 18 Amperes. </s>
<s> This means you have to go to the list, pick a video card then off to reviews to sniff out how much power the card draws from the PSU. </s>
<s> Since we want to use half the rating for this that's 9 Amperes at 12 Volts or 108 Watts. </s>
<s> There's a lot of cards that exceed this and most cards do not supply this value which is why we are checking reviews. </s>
<s> Good hunting. </s>
<s> Too bad that wasn't a single rail PSU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Fit it in the machine and test with what you have. </s>
<s> If everything works go shopping for a hd 7750. </s>
<s> It will be quite a bump from what you have. </s>
<s> Will it run games at max settings?........doubtful. </s>
<s> Like I said, I am in the market for both Power Supply and Graphics card if need be. </s>
<s> What would you recommend for a PSU and GC combo that would fit in a 500 (Or in that close proximity) </s>
<s> That tops out at about 320 Watts in the reviews and while there are cards beyond this one, it's the holy grail of GPUs today. </s>
<s> And that 500 Watt PSU might have eeked by if it was a single rail since at 320 Watts that's about 27 Amperes and that 500 could have been 36 Amperes on the 12V rail but it was not. </s>
<s> http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2415630,00.asp covers other high end cards. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> As much as I would love to have a Titan, that is a bit much. </s>
<s> I need a Graphics Card and a GPU that can handle it in the price range of 500 or less. </s>
<s> &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;One of my friends says his card can run pretty much every game on top settings, he has a Radeon HD 6870. </s>
<s> &lt;span&gt;(Link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150561 ) &lt;span&gt;My question is, would it, and if it could, what PSU could I fit into my current case that can handle that card? </s>
<s> And here's how I pick a PSU. </s>
<s> I find a review on the card I want to fit then I look for where they measure the amount of Watts it tops out at. </s>
<s> Now if I want to have a stable machine for years (some can't do that and will settle for a 1 year lease) I will take the Watts and divide by 6. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Well we want to find the 50% mark for the +12V rail amperage so you could divide by 12 then multiply by 2 or just use 6. </s>
<s> Now off to find a suitable supply that has that or more Amperes on the +12V rail and meets the Watts the card calls out. </s>
<s> This is usually all it takes. </s>
<s> Not hard at all? </s>
<s> http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/540?vs=680 seems to call it out at 255 Watts so I see I want 42.5 Amperes on the +12 Rail to get a nice stable PC. </s>
<s> That's definitely in the 500+ Watt range so at http://www.newegg.com/Power-Supplies/Category/ID-32 I see the first 500+ Watt PSU with a single rail is this one. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151088 It has 54 Ampere rail and meets the other spec so all that would be left to to look for others and check the fit in the case. </s>
