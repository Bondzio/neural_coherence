Did you install any mfg supplied drivers when installing WinXP (F6)?
See if you have an AHCI device in Device Manager; check your BIOS and see if AHCI or hot-swapping is enabled.
If your drives are configured to allow hot swapping, they'll appear in the &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; list just like a USB drive.
When I first installed an SATA drive, I installed the cable backwards.
One end just has a plug, but the other has a plug and a clip/lock.
The cable works either way but is loose if reversed.
Perhaps you did the same thing?
