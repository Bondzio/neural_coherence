8187	0	63983	759517	NR	Kelster	2/12/05 11:14 AM	1.10820684E12	Video card fan problems	I have a GeForce 5200 128mb video card, and the fan has become very noisy, especially on startup. It is about a year old, but I can't find any warrenty information on it (manufacturer is Interage, purchased at Sam's Club). My gaming consists of Madden and other sports games. What can I do with this? My brother suggests unplugging the fan, but that doesn't sound like a good option to me. Any information is appreciated.
