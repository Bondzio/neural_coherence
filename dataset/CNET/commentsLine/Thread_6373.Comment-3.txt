a lot of drives have a small hole in the front just big enough for a paper clip wire.
that's exactly what the hole if for...to manually open the drive.
you do so by pushing straight in the hole with enough force to lift the heads up and start the door to open.
i might guess the drive belt that operates the door is damaged or off the pulley.
when this happens you hear the drive try but it just cannot open.
