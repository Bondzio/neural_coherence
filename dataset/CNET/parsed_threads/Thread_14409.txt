<s> I have already read other messages regarding to this problem. </s>
<s> I am thinking to buy a new Graphic Card or only the cooling fan. </s>
<s> My Graphic Card is Win Fast 128 MB PX 6600GT TDH (AMD Athlon 64 2.21 GHz and 3 GB RAM, Windows XP Pro SP 2 with all the latest updates)it was very noisy so I disconnected the cooling fan. </s>
<s> I am requesting advice about this disconnection and the possible problems I may have. </s>
<s> Sounds like an expensive solution to this issue. </s>
<s> The fan when disconnected should cause the device it was cooling to overheat and age quickly. </s>
<s> There is no standard on this cooling area so you may have to be handy with small power tools and look at quiet replacements such as http://www.zalman.co.kr/eng/product/view.asp?idx=149 There are dozens of such devices. </s>
