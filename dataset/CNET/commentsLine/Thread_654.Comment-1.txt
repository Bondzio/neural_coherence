i bought a ati radeon video card x1300 256mb with a need for 350 watts.
i bought a 400 watt power supply but some of the parts from the new power supply don't fit nor work with me old computer.
i can install the video card perfectly but the power supply doesnt work.
i have looked at other poer supplies and they all work the same.
could i only plug in my new power supply to the video card and use the odl one for the rest of my computer, and somehow power my video card and only my video card with that seperate power supply.
if theirs something you don't understand please ask me to clarify it.
i hope this is understandable.
thanks in advance.
