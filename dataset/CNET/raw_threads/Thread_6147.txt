Lattice & Adam have Pixel-Qi screens, and while I was hesitating between one and the other, I found that neither do the job, as they are also both glossy, with the Adam using some protective matte thing (not real matte screen). So, I want a tablet for reading, and I want it to have an OS (like Android) to do some other work; what do you suggest? A side question: is that screen protective that some use on Ipad a good one just like a matte screen?
