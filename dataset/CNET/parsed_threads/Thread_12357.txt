<s> I have a Dell dimension desktop and I wanted to put a TV tuner card in it. </s>
<s> I don't want to replace the video card just add a tuner. </s>
<s> I would like it to have an FM tuner, decent software, and be in the 30~70 dollar range. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I like the Hauppauge line because of the better software. </s>
<s> I have an ATI and a Asus also, but the software sucks. </s>
<s> difficult to install and there is no &quot;on top view&quot; that lets you view in a separate window on top of your Computing. </s>
<s> The Hauppage Win TV analog, I have had for five years and works well in Win98 and WinXP. </s>
<s> See http://www.hauppauge.com/html/products.htm for some Ideas. </s>
