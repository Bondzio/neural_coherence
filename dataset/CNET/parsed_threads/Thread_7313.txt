<s> I just bought this video card: http://www.bfgtech.com/bfgr85256gte.aspx Works great for my purposes, but the fan is way too loud! </s>
<s> Can anyone point me to a nice, quiet fan? </s>
<s> I'm not sure what I'd be looking for exactly and I could really use someone's help. </s>
<s> Also, I noticed the stock fan can be 'slid' out from the silver Heatsink, so would I need to get a fan that can also 'slide' in? </s>
<s> I'm guessing that's not going to be easy to find and that I'll need a completely new heatsink/fan product? </s>
<s> Did you look at replacement heatsink and fans at newegg.com and geeks.com? </s>
<s> I'm fitting this one on a Nvidia I own -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=A1655 </s>
<s> I think that's a little over the top in terms of how much cooling I need for the card, no? </s>
<s> I was looking for something a little simpler... Also, the current heatsink is &quot;glued&quot; on to the card I guess with some special heat-absorbent glue or something? </s>
<s> Would I need to buy that kind of glue? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835119080 Would something like this fit? </s>
<s> Are the push-pin locations standard across all VGA cards? </s>
<s> Is there a better solution? </s>
<s> See if there are others at newegg and the usual places. </s>
<s> I chose this one so I don't have to revisit it next year or so. </s>
<s> My bet is that even if the fan failed the passive cooling might be enough. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Make it fanless. </s>
<s> The Accelero S2 provides better cooling than some fan-based stock heatsinks and is zero noise. </s>
<s> The only caveat is that your case needs good airflow. </s>
<s> And since you're probably going to hang onto the card for a while - what's $8 extra really? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186017 </s>
<s> That is a good suggestion and ideally I would do that, however, I have a stock Dell E521 machine and I don't think there is enough air-flow in the whole tower for a solution like this to work... but I'm not positive... </s>
<s> You need to visit overclocking and/or modding websites to help better with cooling replacements and/or tips/clues. </s>
<s> Just google away for possible websites to visit. </s>
<s> Once, you find such sites, they explain or direct you to possible fixes, replacements, etc., don't expect too simple a solution as you mentioned you have a glued on heatsink. </s>
<s> If you can, simply return the video card and get one that better suits your needs. </s>
<s> A quick note, to remove any glued on heatsink, you &quot;freeze&quot; and snap off as the sticking glue may not hold. </s>
<s> However, you do this at your own risk. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Shouldn't be a problem. </s>
<s> In fact, the cooler will face up so it might even perform better. </s>
<s> The only issue I can see on the E521 is clearance between the cooler when installed and the CPU HSF shroud. </s>
<s> Dimensions should be up on the Arctic website, so double-check before buying. </s>
<s> ... and I'm sure you're aware of this, but as far as I'm aware the third-party fan invalidates the BFG lifetime warranty. </s>
<s> It's normally not a big deal but just, like, warning you </s>
<s> ... actually, maybe not. </s>
<s> I've realised the PCI backplate for the Accelero wouldn't fit since you have no blanking plates above the GPU slot. </s>
<s> Hmmm. </s>
<s> What you'll need is an 'over and under' passive cooler. </s>
<s> I'll get back to you. </s>
<s> Not noisy at all now. </s>
<s> But I did have the hacksaw off a small corner since a heatsink on the motherboard was in the same area. </s>
<s> This heatsink looks like it will do fine without the fan in this system but we'll see how it runs later. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ah, I see, thanks for the heads up and thanks for looking into this for me. </s>
<s> I really appreciate it. </s>
<s> So, maybe a fan-based solution is best after all? </s>
<s> Let me know... </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> ... and also, what are my options to avoid voiding the warranty, if possible? </s>
<s> Why isn't this a warranty issue? </s>
<s> What do you mean? </s>
<s> What do you guys think of this fan? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835226018 Is there anything cheaper for around the same noise level? </s>
<s> You can't fix it without voiding the warranty so it's back to dealing with the company to fix it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It's the Video card that I just bought which works but has a very loud fan IMO. </s>
<s> Others might be able to deal with it, but I find it very high-pitched and irritating after a while, so I would like to replace it with a quieter fan. </s>
<s> I don't think it's necessarily 'broken'. </s>
<s> It's warranty is over. </s>
<s> Is that not worth doing? </s>
<s> If any of my previous BFG's are anything to go by, silence is not their game. </s>
<s> I don't think they attach their HSF's to any sort of speed control. </s>
<s> There's a similarly priced Gigabyte, but all rely on an 80mm fan to move air - the same as your choice. </s>
<s> I'm out of ideas for a fanless solution. </s>
