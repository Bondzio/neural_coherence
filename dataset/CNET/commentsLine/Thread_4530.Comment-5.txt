vista has uncovered how lazy/immobile creative and many other vendors are.
and such as ms's bad press these days that it becomes their fault.
as the second reply to your post points out, the audio subsystem received a major overhaul (mostly for the better) in vista, yet the vast majority of the vendors still don't support it properly.
it is a major job to be sure but they've known about the changes for ages.
suffice it to say that older soundcards won't be supported with vista from virtually anyone, and expect only whatever was available just before vista launch to be supported.
you should be pretty safe with x-fi cards as far as driver support in vista is concerned.
it's not complete now, but they should have it sorted out in a while.
