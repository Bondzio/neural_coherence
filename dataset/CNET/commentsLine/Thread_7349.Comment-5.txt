my load temp on both air and cooling is 61c 2which is hot for a phenom ii.
i am using an ocz hydroflow cpublock, a swiftech 120mm fan, and my pump is a dangerden cpx pro.
my old air cooler was a coolermaster hyper 212 plus.
i don't think it is the connection to the waterblock because it feels hot which would imply that heat is being transferred.
