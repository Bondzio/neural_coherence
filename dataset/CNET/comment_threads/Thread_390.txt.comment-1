Just had a new computer built (not by me) with an Asus A8N-E motherboard which has up to 10 USB2 ports.
However my machine reports through Device Manager that the USB mass storage device will function at reduced speed and I need to add a high speed USB host controller.
Si Soft Sandra reports the speeds as varying from 1.5 to 12 Mbps.
XP SP2 Professional What is going on please and how do I sort it out?
Thanks
