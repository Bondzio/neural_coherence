Hello.
Have you looked for a small black square box on the mainboard?
It is an integrated real time clock / battery used on some motherboards.
An example is one that has the brand Dallas Semiconductors and has a drawing of a clock on it.
I am surprised the Cmos battery is depleted on a recent tablet like the hh3.
