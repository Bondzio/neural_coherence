My Network adapters are Broadcom 440x 10/100 Integrated controller, and Broadcom 802.11g Network Adaptor. I connected to the internet, and connection status shows &quot;unidentified network access: local only&quot; but when I surfed using IE browser, it gives me this &quot;The address is not valid, most likely causes: there might be a typing error in the address; if you clicked on a link, it may be out of data&quot;, and &quot;what you can try: retype the address; go back to the previous page&quot; What should I do at this point? your inputs are highly appreciated. Have a great weekend guys!
