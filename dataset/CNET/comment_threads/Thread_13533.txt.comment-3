Earlier versions of Windows don't support hard drives greater than 137 GB, but Windows 2000 (Service Pack 4) and Windows XP (Service Pack 1) do.
Please note that for both OSes, the service packs are necessary.
If you have SP2 (XP), you're in great shape, but if you don't have even SP1, you need to upgrade.
Windows 2000 needs SP4 to support more than 137.
Actually, you could get a 200GB HDD and use it with any version of Windows, you'd just be limited to 137GB, and the rest of the HDD would just sit there, not being used.
