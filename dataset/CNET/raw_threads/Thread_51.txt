I know the replacements are online but what I was hopping was to buy something better than the original. Like Penabled Tablet Pc Eraser Pen here http://www.amazon.com/Penabled-Tablet-Pc-Eraser-Pen/dp/B000085BDB/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top So what i was wondering was if anyone had any recommendations or knew a good stylus that would work with my tablet. A million thanks in advance.

While the other pens seem to work, they stick out or don't fit. Bob
