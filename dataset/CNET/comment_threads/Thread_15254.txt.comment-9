The LAN information is non-routable so without any stress I can share my LAN's IP address range, NETMASK and Gateway.
This one didn't need that and while your experts can add a route I hope you understand I can't in good conscious do that for folk.
If I did and they didn't understand how it works then later they would not be able to fix it.
So as you can see, the printer needed to be on the LAN which you did and it's much easier to fix and maintain now.
