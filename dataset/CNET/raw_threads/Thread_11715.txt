However, I can't seem to find a way how to play it. So I have a few questions: First, how do I go to the PS2 in the first place? Do I access it from TV? Is there supposed to be a special channel? Second, I don't have a cable or tv antenna connected; do I need to have one connected to play the ps2? Third, I have Windows SP1. Do I really need SP2 to play on the ps2?

So lets say RF set PS2 to channel 3, connect a RF cable from the PS2 RF out to channel 3 the ATI tuner input and tune it to channel 3. John
