would turn me off totally.
i can buy a whole laptop for that.
cost consideration alone, if a 512gb drive were that much, would turn me off!
you can get a terrabyte drive for less than fifty bucks.
it's just not worth it.
systems now are so fast, including the huge standard drives, that speed is not noticeable.
i can see using an ssd in a portable device, or for long term backup where it's critical, that's it.
i'd never use one in a standard system for the os or anything else.
that said, my 10 year old xp system with a crt monitor does fine for me, so maybe i'm unusual.
can't stand the new flatscreens, nor win vista, 7, or 8 either.
and when this system finally dies, if i need a desktop, i'll probably build my own and put linux on it anyway, therefore configuring the whole thing just the way i want it, not only hardware but software!
as to the votes/comments not loading, it's most likely due to a cross-site scripting problem.
many sites allow dangerous cross-site scripting, and/or require it for certain functions to work, and newer browsers may turn some of these sites off, such as cbsi.com by default.
i have noscript installed and have to temporarily allow certain sites every time i go to many pages, including this one and facebook, which now requires the use some foreign site called something like achmed.com, so i certainly don't go there much!
