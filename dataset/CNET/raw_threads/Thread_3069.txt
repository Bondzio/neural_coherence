I had a problem with 2.4 GHz phones causing my wireless connection to drop given they work at near identical frequency of the router. Wireless network uses Netgear Rangemax and Netgear USB. Even though computer signal was strong the 2.4 GHzphones would kick it out whenever a wireless 2.4 GHz was anwered. It didn't matter if the phone was not even near the router or USB. I have 4 wireless phones throughout the house now on 5.8 GHz including one near (&lt;8 ft.) to the router and another within a foot of the USB. No problems at all now with phone interference either for the router or the phones. I believe (I may be wrong) 5.8 GHz phones may have more range than other phones so your interference may relate to other phones in your area. Jim

We frequently get the question of ''Why does my wireless connection to the internet disappear whenever I answer my (2.4GHz) cordless phone,'' but I've never seen asked ''Why does my cordless phone go dead/have burst of static whenever I send an email from my wireless laptop.'' It seems whenever there is a conflict, the microwave ovens and cordless phones always win. Adding to that, your problematic phone is a 5.8GHz model. That's a completely different frequency band. If there is a radio signal conflict, it should be with a device on the same band, not the 2.4GHz band - unless there is a defect in the radio emitter of one or another specific device that is spilling a whole spectrum of garbage frequencies into the air, but that's a different kettle of fish. Shifting now to troubleshooting mode - what happens when you turn off your wifi equipment (all of it - router and computer(s))? Do you still get the static on the phone? What happens if you put the 5.8GHz unit downstairs and the 2.4GHz unit upstairs? Do you still get the static? Can you take the problematic set to a friend's house, plug it in there, and make a call? Is there still static? Just some ideas to narrow down whether the unit is bum, or the location you are using it in is bum. I don't think there is interference from your wifi, it is something else. dw

You sound like you might know a thing or two about cordless phones. The only additional information I can give you in addition to the following not is that I am currently using a 5.8 GHz cordless. I STILL GET STATIC. It is so annoying!! ''Although it's not really a computer or network question, I'd like to know what your subscribers think the best cordless phone is. I've had bad luck and the expensive sets don't seem to be any better than the cheap ones. They all wind up having static breaking in on my conversations. It's very annoying. I keep them charged up, should I be letting them run down? The only really good cordless phone set I have ever used belonged to a friend. It was a Seimens. By the time I could afford to get it...I saved for quite a while...they were no longer available anywhere. Phones with cords don't even seem to be much better. ''So, would you consider helping me out here? ''Could you ask the readers what they think for me, please? ''Or if you have some good info...I need some. ''Thanks a million! ''Kitty Ichelson'' If this gets to you and you can give me some insight...brands, prices, GHz's, nothing seems to make a difference. Except I never heard static on my friend's phone, the Seimens and they can't be found anymore. Do ham set interfer? CB radios? PASSING AIRPLANES???? I can't figure it out. Kitty
