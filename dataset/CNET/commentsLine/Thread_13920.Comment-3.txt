lay it on a piece of cardboard with ony cpu/hsf, memory.
plug the supply in and use the tip of a small slot screwdriver to momentarily short the two power on pins on the mobo togeter.
the power supply should turn on and stay on, until you short the pins again, possibly for 4 or 5 seconds.
btw way, this should work with a brand new mobo with nothing added.
should work right out of the box.
