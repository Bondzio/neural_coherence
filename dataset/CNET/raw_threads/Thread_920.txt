Reading http://seclists.org/lists/bugtraq/2004/Jun/0116.html is interesting in that it could have a security issue. Bring that up when you call in for RMA. Tip: Be nice, but firm on the phone. No threats, growls or such. If in warranty, good. If not, use that security issue to make your point it should be exchanged. Tip 2: Accept a replacement of another model if it does the same job. Observation. OfficeMax had a belkin router for 10 to 15 bucks. I have no use for another one, but the problem is that shipping can run as much as replacement. This makes a mess out of repair options.. Bob
