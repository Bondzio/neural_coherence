I had an Athlon XP 3200+.
I had the same problem when running even simple games, I ran some tests on it and found that the CPU was getting very hot.
Upon further research I found that this whole line of CPU's runs notoriously hot.
I'd recommend downloading a program to check your temp.
If its too hot, try buying some better thermal grease (I use Arctic Silver.)
Apply that to your Athlon and give it a try.
I had to do it a couple times to get the right amount, too much = too hot, too little = too hot.
That should fix the problem, your comp is doing exactly what mine did.
