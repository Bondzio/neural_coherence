I have a Hitachi external hard drive that worked fine one morning and stopped working when I came back from college. It simply does not power on at all, as if the power cable is not even connected. I have tried it on two different computers the unit is definitely not receiving power So my question is, would buying a new enclosure save my data? I use my external hard drive to stream music and video from my Nintendo Wii and it's imperative that I save it. A new enclosure would have to conform to the specs of 3.5&quot; and 2TB. I can't afford data recovery and I want to save my approaching 1TB worth of content. This is it and thanks for any help I've had trouble finding answers. http://www.hitachigst.com/external-drives/desktop/hitachi-xl-desk

If you take the unit to a Radio Shack or someone who has a volt ohm meter handy this is a very easy thing to check., there is a pretty good chance that the drive itself is fine.
