hello i have a very weird problem here, concerning my ups.
and this is the second ups!
the first one was a &quot;orbit&quot; 600 va model, and now i have a new &quot;street line&quot; 1000 va one.
both of them show precisely the same strange behaviour.
when my pc is on, and the power goes out, the pc goes off too!
the ups won't back up as it is supposed to do.
when i turn the ups then off and on again, it won't start - just beeps short and stays off.
if i unplug the computer (!
), i can start the ups!
i can then even plug the computer back in, and boot it - so the battery in the ups is fine and has certainly enough power to keep the computer going for more than half an hour.
i tested it with several other electrical devices - all of them stay on when i simulate a power failure by switching off the breaker.
i tried with a fan, my home stereo, a small washing machine (600 watts) and my 21&quot; crt television plus satellite receiver.
all of these devices nicely stay on when the power goes.
so why doesn't the computer???
my computer consists of a 365 watts enermax psu which is only about a year old, a asus a7a-133 mobo, athlon xp 1800+ cpu, 2 hdd's, 2 cd drives, every pci slot used etc and a 17&quot; lcd monitor which is just 2 months old.
the computer itself works absolutely perfect, no power problems whatsoever.
i apreciate any help i can get, because i can;t just keep buying ups's until i find one that does the job - i already have two that work just perfect with everything except my pc, and i can't refund those because they, well, work.
the fault must be with the computer - somehow.
kind regards..... thanh
