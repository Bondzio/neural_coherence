Alternatively, you could download and run a program like CPU-Z to learn the name of you motherboard model. Google the model and you will learn a lot about what slots you have. A picture, here you go: http://www.abcd.com.au/v/agp_slot.htm How did I find that? I went to Google.com and typed in AGP SLOTS. Tell us the computer manufasturer & model so we can help you find a compatible card. Moterboard manufacturer and model name helps, too.

The voltage is set by the AGP card and the AGP slot obliges. That area causes far too much confusion. Another confuser is the bad writing about 8X voltages. The tech writer's coffee priviledges should be revoked. Bob

Fortunately, I didn't force it in nor did i remove that piece in the slot. But if that looks like yours you can find out when you go to the site. The memory was correct but the AGP Vid was not, it has one notch and not two.
