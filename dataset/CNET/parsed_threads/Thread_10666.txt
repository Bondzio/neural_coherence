<s> Hey, I'm planning to build a new computer. </s>
<s> I have a budget of $1500. </s>
<s> I just need some advise on what to put in it, especially the motherboard, I know nothing about motherboards. </s>
<s> I was thinking to put in: Thermaltake III Xaser CASE Aopen AX4SPE MOTHERBOARD Intel Celeron 3.06 Ghz w/HP PROCESSOR twinx1024 3200LL MEMORY Maxtor 250 GB - 7200 RPM HARDDRIVE ATI Radeon 9800 XT 128mb GRAPHICS CARD Creative Labs Audigy 2-Platinum SOUND CAR DVD-RW/CD-RW combo + DVD-ROM DRIVE that comes up to about 1450 buxx. </s>
<s> i can go over my budget by about 100-200 dollars maximum. </s>
<s> If you think i should replace any of these parts just tell me. </s>
<s> or if you know a better motherboard. </s>
<s> Im also interested in a dual-processor motherboard but i havent been ableto find enough info. </s>
<s> all advice is welcome, thank you </s>
<s> I wouldn't do this. </s>
<s> This year may see the 64-bit changeover and if you sink too much into this machine, you may get a little upset over the 64-bit new machines. </s>
<s> Why not just get some few hundred dollar nice machine and wait it out? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i would wait if i could, but my budget has a time limit. </s>
<s> i had sort of a grant that has to be used for that purpose within this time, or else i would so what u suggested, thanks though </s>
<s> Then go 64-bit now. </s>
<s> http://reviews-zdnet.cbsi.com/4520-3000-5079609.html notes a few suppliers and at 1,500 USD http://www.polywell.com/us/onlinestore/poly900VF1.asp starts at under 999. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> yeah, thats a good idea, i think ill do just that. </s>
<s> So basically the only change i need to make is an AMD Athlon 64bit (of course) processer and a motherboard to go with it? </s>
<s> all the rest can stay, right? </s>
<s> thanks max </s>

<s> thanks oh and the second link, i have to build my own, as in get the parts and throw the things together, not get it custom made by sum other company, thanks though max </s>
<s> When you build it yourself, there are risks. </s>
<s> New builders often do odd things like bolt the motherboard to the case without the standoffs and then take a grinder to the case to make the cards fit. </s>
<s> Even seasoned builders will often pick an undersized power supply and the machine will not boot or will develop problems shortly. </s>
<s> Are you really ready for all this? </s>
<s> Are you willing to replace a bum blown board or two? </s>
<s> It happens... Bob </s>
<s> I have a couple of friends and connections close to where i live that could give me a hand if i dropped them an email. </s>
<s> i understand the risk of making a small mistake and frying anything on it. </s>
<s> another question, ok so i use a 64bit AMD, right? </s>
<s> can i get 2 and put them on a nice dual processor motherboard? </s>
<s> do u kno a place where i CAN get a dual processor motherboard? </s>
<s> &quot;Today&quot; in Intel-land, that's the XEON, Itanium or you have to move back in time to the P3. </s>
<s> The P4 is not dual-cpu capable. </s>
<s> &quot;Today&quot; in AMD-land the duals are the Athlon-MP series. </s>
<s> I've seen a few, but remember that you often see them fitted with 600+ Watt power supplies and cooling systems that are often too noisy to be in an office space. </s>
<s> While I still have my old dual Pentium Pro with Overdrive's, it was a lot more money than a faster CPU of next year. </s>
<s> In fact, I could have a single faster CPU that year and bought a new machine the following year at twice the speed with the same money. </s>
