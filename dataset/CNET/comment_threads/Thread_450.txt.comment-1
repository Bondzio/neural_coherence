Hi everybody i've got a question for builting computers although im very computer literate but oh well here goes What im wondering is it best to rather buy DDR RAM or DDR2 RAM because more programs are better off with newer technology because it will run more Efficiently sense the FSB is faster then the older DDR RAM im thinking about gettin at least 1GB or 2GB for the RAM of course heres another question i've heard intel has a lot of overheating issues so perhaps I will stick with AMD for it's performance and reliable it has but intel is quicker so the anything will start up faster but is it best off to get a water cooling system if I were to buy an intel?
or stick with the heatsinks and fans would it be better off with seagates hd or western digital I rather buy retail then oem I just want a quieter drive not much of a fan for big drives don't really store important infomation or play pc games on it just looking for a fast computer I just need more then one opinion on this questions thanks TuneUp
