1.1.2	I have a desktop and a notebook &quot;connected&quot; in a wireless home network.	St

1.1.4	I used to be able to access the wireless network from the notebook, but suddenly now I seem to be not allowed to access it anymore!	St
1.1.5	The shared internet connection does not work in the notebook anymore, and if I try to access the shared folders of the desktop, I keep on getting the following error message in the notebook: &quot;(network place) is not accessible.	St
1.1.6	You might not have permission to access this network resource.	St
1.1.7	Contact the administrator blah blah.	St
1.1.8	The Network path was not found.&quot; WHAT CAN I DO to access my own network?	St
1.1.9	I already tried connecting from the &quot;wireless network connection - properties&quot; dialog box, but no success.	St
1.1.10	Thanks a lot in advance	St
1.2.1	Time to check if your IP and Subnet addresses are in the same ballpark.	St
1.2.2	Look into your network properties page for this info.	St
1.2.3	You did not say whether a router is involved.	St
