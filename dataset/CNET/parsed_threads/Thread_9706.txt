<s> ok I got my Motorola s805 headphones today and I figuired out to connect it to my iPod Touch but what about my computer I have a HP pavilion tx2500z and I bought a bluetooth usb dongle. </s>
<s> I don't know why it won't work. </s>
<s> please help! </s>
<s> But when I researched how to get audio from a PC to blue tooth headsets I found the Skype articles to help the most. </s>
<s> Do you have the bluetooth stack in your system? </s>
<s> Likely the issue, would show in DEVICE Manager. </s>
<s> If you don't I think there is a download from BROADCOMfor that purpose. </s>
<s> Thanks guys but I figuired it out. </s>
<s> Working with Bluesoleil version 2 was slightly vague on somethings and I finally figuired it out. </s>
