so I still havent bought my cpu, mobo or video card.
The more I keep reading the more ppl keep bringing up the 64bits that are scheduled to come out.
Anyone know the price range that these babies will be in when they come out?
I ask because if its something that will be in the $200-300 range for a cpu -then I will wait and get that but if they are going to be $500+ chips then id rather just spend the $200 and get my 3.0P4 now and think about going 64bit next year or later.
