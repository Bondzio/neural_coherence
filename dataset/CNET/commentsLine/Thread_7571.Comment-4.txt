what will happen when you format the drives as 146gb is that you will have your extra 8gb on the side.
i believe that if you wanted you could actually use that extra 8gb as storage; but that is dependent on the controller and i dont know which adaptec you're using.
once again; yes, if you repartition your 154gb array to 146gb and use your 3rd hdd as a hotspare; it will work!
write-cache is a feature that will enable you to get better performance from your drives; once again, how this works is dependent on your controller, but for the most part it is based in the controllers ram.
what it does is it stores the read write operations for the disks in the ram until it can more effeciently do that operation.
hence; if you want better performance off your raid; i assume you do, then go ahead and enable it.
