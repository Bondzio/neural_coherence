yes started getting windows system warning messages my harddrive was failing, and to backup critical files immediately (or something to that effect) i ignored it for about a week & then started to worry - i consulted my brother-in-law, a retired hp guru - well long & short i followed the advise he'd been giving me for years and installed a second harddrive in the pc - created a ghost (norton ghost 2003) image on the new harddrive, and boot to that drive now - scrapped the old drive.
now doing ghost image back-ups on all pc's in the house kids, wife's no worries.
