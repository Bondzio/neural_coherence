I have an old Dell desktop (XPS T500, Pentium 3 500MHz, 384 memory) that I would like to do some video work with (edit family vacation videos, etc).
My system came with a DVD player (not a burner), and I have added a CD burner to an available bay.
I wanted to get one of the newer dual layer lightscribe burners, like the one from HP, but it appears that the system requirements call for a minimum of 800 MHz processor.
Will it still work, albeit a little slower than desired, or will it not work at all?
I am running Windows XP on the system if that is an issue...any suggestions?
