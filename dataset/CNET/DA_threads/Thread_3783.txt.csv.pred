1.1.1	I formerly had an HP PSC 1300 series printer on my home network.	St
1.1.2	It has since been removed, but I can't seem to delete it from my computer.	St
1.1.3	It has one pending print job that can't be deleted.	St
1.1.4	Additionally, whenever I change the default printer, it will soon revert back to the HP PSC 1300.	St
1.1.5	Also, it whenever I restart the computer, add any other printer, turn any printer on, or insert a cd or flash drive, the printer reinstalls on the computer.	St
1.1.6	I've done multiple virus and spyware scans, so that shouldn't be the issue.	St
1.1.7	I would guess if I could delete the print job, then I could delete the printer, and the problem would cease.	Sug
1.1.8	However, I can't seem to do that.	St
1.1.9	Any suggestions?	St
