For work I'm using a Dell Precision M90 notebook with a NVIDIA Quadro FX 2500m video card, and they just gave me a plug and play Acer V223W 22&quot; LCD monitor to use with it.
In the display settings, the max 16:10 widescreen resolution is 1680x1050, with 1440x900 being the next step down.
When I set the resolution to 1440x900, the display fits on the entire screen and is not distorted, but I want better resolution.
When I switch to 1680x1050, the display fits vertically, but I lose some off the right edge of the monitor (the clock plus 1 tray icon).
When I move the cursor over there, it slides into view, but pushes the left side of the display off the screen (so I can't see the &quot;start&quot; button).
I've messed with the display settings in both the Windows interface and the NVIDIA controls, but I can't get it to fit.
Why would two resolutions with the same aspect ratio (16:10) produce different results?
Is there anything I haven't tried to adjust it?
