<s> all I could see were a lot of opinions, that gave me no idea who is right or wrong, infact i could not read all, a lot of stuff. </s>
<s> may be wanted some spoon feeding. </s>
<s> No answer. </s>
<s> While you could run the defragmenter once a year or month and easily say that's better than none at all, beyond that the analysis gets tangled up in how the PC is used and more. </s>
<s> There is no right answer here. </s>
<s> Once you figure that out, you cand run defrag once a month and forget about it. </s>
