1.1.1	Hi: Two weeks ago my ZIP 100 disk died a sudden death.	St
1.1.2	I use an external ZIP 100 drive on my Dell laptop.	St
1.1.3	I used ZIP storeage on my older computer so when I got this computer six months ago I bought a new Iomega ZIP 100 disk drive.	St
1.1.4	The disk is bad, not the drive.	St
1.1.5	I put other ZIP disks in to the drive and it works well on those ZIP disks.	St
1.1.6	I saved all of my data since a year ago on this disk.	St
1.1.7	I mean ALL of my data.	St
1.1.8	I saved to that ZIP drive instead of my hard drive.	St
1.1.9	I lost all of it That is the simplest way to put it.	St
1.1.10	Can anyone help me by giving me suggestions on how to recover the data on this disk?	Ques
1.1.11	I took it to two computer shops near where I live and both said the disk is toast.	St
1.1.12	Also, what would have caused the disk to crash like that?	Ques
1.1.13	Could a cell phone near it do it when the phone rings?	St

1.3.1	I have to wonder if your original ZIP drive pertains here.	St
1.3.2	http://kb.iu.edu/data/ahhd.html This is old news and resulted in a class action law suit a while back.	St
1.3.3	The suggestions is the drives themselves were destroying the disks making the date unrecoverable.	St
1.4.1	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=zip+data+recovery finds recovery houses.	St

1.5.1	How did you save every byte of your data on a single Zip disk?	St
1.5.2	100 MB isn't much.	St
1.6.1	If you go down to &quot;what I can't lose&quot; it gets to be very small.	St
1.6.2	When the Tsunami is coming in, it's all the data I'll need to save.	St
