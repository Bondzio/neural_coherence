First, my computer had BSOD every time i start up my computer so i reset the cmos but after my computer didnt power up at all, no fan, no sound, nothing other then the green light on the mobo when everything is plugged in.
I try turning on the computer with another PSU that i had but still nothing.
Anyone has any idea what is wrong or what i can do?
