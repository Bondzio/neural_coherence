<s> I need help upgrading my desktop pc which i bought 3 years ago. </s>
<s> I run xp professional sp2. </s>
<s> My hardware specfications are pentium 4 1.7Ghz,256 mb RAM, 32MB graphics card.Need help upgrading my hardware and what are the recommended upgrades </s>
<s> As it stands, why upgrade? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What computer make & model? </s>
<s> If a home build, what motherboard make & model? </s>
<s> What video card model? </s>
<s> What do you want to do with the computer? </s>
<s> If gaming, buy a new one. </s>
<s> Otherwise, upgrade system RAM to at least 512MB (or possibly up to 1GB). </s>
<s> Maybe get a better video card, but that depends on the computer model and what you want to spend. </s>
<s> You need to discover if it can take an AGP 4X/8X video card or just a PCI video card (PCI Express is not an option for a computer that old). </s>
<s> BOTTOM LINE: If you do only one thing, upgrade the system RAM. </s>
<s> Windows XP likes at least 512MB, and you will notice the difference. </s>
<s> I don't like the idea of dumping too much money into that older system, especially since nice new systems are inexpensive. </s>
<s> I would upgrade RAM, then video(replace) and finally the cpu in that order. </s>
<s> Just getting more ram for a XP based system in practical terms is 512mb for good operation with 1gb for best overall. </s>
<s> The other upgrades depending on your wallet should be considered but can wait provided you're happy with the ram upgrade alone. </s>
<s> IMHO, that is the route I would go. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> My computer is assembled at a shop.My mother board is Intel D850GB.My Video card is Trident video accleator cyberblade xp 32MB.My mother board has 3 free Pci slots. </s>
<s> It does not support pci express.It only supports AGP 2/4X 1.5V graphic cards. </s>
<s> Also My usb is 1.1 is ther any way to convert it to hi-speed 2.1 </s>
<s> The USB 1.1 ports can't be upgraded, but the PCI card will provide additional USB ports that are version 2.0. </s>
<s> You will see a BIG improvement when you upgrade the ram from 512mb to 1GB. </s>
<s> Next big improvement would be to upgrade your graphic card to one that has at least 128mb memory. </s>
