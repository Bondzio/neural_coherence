<s> Recently bought a new psu and discovered that I didn't need it. </s>
<s> Still the new one offers more power and ventilation than the old so..... </s>
<s> I've tried to use the old psu to test case fans and such but only get a short power up when connected to a mobo. </s>
<s> Without a mobo involved I get nothing. </s>
<s> Is there a jumper needed in the mobo connector or what? </s>
<s> How to power up an ATX power supply? </s>
<s> Thanx. </s>
<s> Will check it out. </s>
<s> Why I didn't think of it????? </s>
