The myth started a few years ago.
Manufacturer/Vendors sold external cases that specifically stated 500GB.
Some were 1 Terrabyte.
The end user did not either read the specification, or failed to verify at the manufacturer's site the information.
To this day, there are Vendor's that market external cases with only 1 Terrabyte specs.
Today, the most well-known online vendors do an adequate job with specifications.
Links to the manufacturer's site, and buyer reviews can sometimes answer lingering questions.
