If I am attaching a mini ipod to my pc computer, will it transfer the music even though the music does not exist in the itunes music library folder. Thanks for any help.

This is by design. To get music into the iPod (the Apple way) you import such into iTunes and have it convert them and put them into the iPod. Bob

Is that correct? And if it is then it sounds like the quickest solution is to open itunes and add the filles back into it again except this time make sure the option &quot;copy into itunes folder when adding to the library&quot; is checked in the advanced settings. Is this correct? Thanks for the help
