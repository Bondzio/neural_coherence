good show, well done.
i wish i has access to such if anything to be 100% sure it was what i thought.
usually, i dump these systems when it fails to respond to typical fixes and i know better to even try an &quot;old soldering job, etc.&quot; because as i stated before the reward is hardly worth it when i know another is in the tubes, sorta speak.
good luck -----willy
