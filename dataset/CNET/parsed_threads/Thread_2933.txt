<s> Suddenly my bios stopped working! </s>
<s> it will let me into the boot menu, but not the bios. </s>
<s> has anyone experienced this problem? </s>
<s> How can i fix it? </s>
<s> to help much, check the info you should give when posting for help. </s>
<s> I think i have an energy star bios because whenever the information screen pops up, you can see the logo, but it stays there for less then a second, so I can't read the rest of it. </s>
<s> The problem is I can't get into the bios. </s>
<s> It says press &lt;F1&gt; for setup, and it won't let me in. </s>
<s> I have tried other common buttons (delete, esc) and they don't work. </s>
<s> I am reall concerned that somthing may be wrong, and if that's the case, i'm kind of screwed. </s>
<s> energy star is NOT a BIOS, just that it is compliant with the rules. </s>
<s> IF &lt;&lt;F1&gt;&gt; doesn't allow you in, try swapping keyboards, I think that if the sibnals are bad, it won't get them to the computer </s>
