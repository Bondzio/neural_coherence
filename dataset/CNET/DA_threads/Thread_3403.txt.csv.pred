1.1.1	I can see from the post that this is a complicated area for most folks , but I did n't find specific answers to my questions .	St
1.1.2	I have a Dell Latitude laptop running 2000 Pro .	St
1.1.3	I purchased a Linksys Wireless G Network USB adapter .	St
1.1.4	I have installed the software .	St
1.1.5	Now I wish to access the network at my church office ( for one ) and utilize other access points i.e .	St
1.1.6	when traveling .	St
1.1.7	Do I have the right equipment to access the internet only ?	Ques
1.1.8	Are there setting and configurations I must account for ?	Ques
1.1.9	If more info is needed please let me know ?	Ques
1.1.10	I am totally unfamiliar with this stuff some explain as simple as possible .	St
1.1.11	Thanks , Joe	St
1.2.1	and no malware running to muck things up , when you get in range of an open access point you should be offered the oppurtunity to connect .	St
1.2.2	Only experimentation will tell .	St
1.3.1	Yes , is should work , but are there any settings , or configurations that must be set in windows ?	Ques
1.3.2	I tired it once and I got not signal ?	Ques
1.3.3	Do n't no if it is my error or whatever ?	Ques
1.3.4	Joe	St
1.4.1	at your plight ... WindowsXP is pretty robust at detecting wireless signals in the air around it and then proposing a dialog box where you can fill in any missing details about the connection , and then it usually takes care of itself .	St
1.4.2	But you said you have W2k .	St
1.4.3	That OS predated the wifi craze and so it requires the device manufacturer to provide a client interface .	St
1.4.4	What does that mean for you ?	Ques
1.4.5	It means you need to learn how the utility operates as well as obtain from the hotspot owner/manager ( e.g. , whoever in your church is responsible for maintaining the wireless network ) any relevant information , such as access point name , channel , encryption keys , whatever .	St
1.4.6	Then you open the utility and manually establish a new profile for that location .	St
1.4.7	If the profile is correctly set ( i.e. , no typos ) then your system should connect .	St
1.4.8	You would only need to do this once , as the profile will be saved ; but you might need to open the utility to tell it which profile in the list to use when at church and which other profile to use wherever else you might go .	St
1.4.9	HTH dw	St
1.5.1	Do I understand that with XP all of the stuff you mentioned wo n't benecessary .	St
1.5.2	It should auto detect and pick up the signal and be usable ?	Ques
1.5.3	Joe	St
1.6.1	Most places where a wireless network is running & quot ; in the air , & quot ; you 'll still need to have the right information in your possession ( and then program that into the connection profile ) in order to connect .	St
1.6.2	That 's what wireless security is all about .	St
1.6.3	XP stays on top of the changing environment a little better when you are walking around from one hotspot to another with an open laptop , but only after it has been trained what to do when the airwaves shift .	St
1.6.4	But you still need to put the necessary information into a profile .	St
1.6.5	Some of the manufacturers have tried very hard to create client manager interfaces that are just as easy to deal with as the one built into XP .	St
1.6.6	But wireless networking is not like a cell phone .	St
1.6.7	Most of the time , you do n't just walk into the room anywhere , open your computer , and start & quot ; talking & quot ; .	St
1.6.8	You have to obtain a password or perhaps the network administrator will register your adapter 's MAC serial number as an authorized user .	St
1.6.9	Now , that said , there are places that do n't mind if any stranger were to walk in , open their laptop , and hit the internet .	St
1.6.10	Some places even invite and encourage the public to come in and use the wireless access as a means of encouraging customer sales ( e.g. , coffee shops ) and sometimes it is free and sometimes you have to pay a nominal fee ( i.e , you have to buy today 's password in order to log in ) .	St
1.6.11	Then there are also people ( idiots , in my opinion ) who do n't bother or do n't have a clue how to restrict strangers from walking in and using their home or business internet connection .	Ques
1.6.12	Read the news yesterday and today about the guy in Florida charged with a felony-3 for sitting on the street in his car logged into an open network inside some guy 's apartment .	St
1.6.13	Best Buy and HomeDepot have both had their sales terminals hacked from out in the parking lot .	St
1.6.14	If you anticipate needing to use wireless to access the internet at your church or other various places you might travel , you should become more familiar with the client manager for your new card so that you can get on without too much trouble .	St
1.6.15	dw	St
1.7.1	I have amuch better understanding of this stuff now .	St
1.7.2	I appreciate you taking the time to explain it better .	Polite
1.7.3	These forums have been so helpful .	St
