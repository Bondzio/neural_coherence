1.1.1	I have an Asus A7N8X-X mobo that I got to set up as a breadboard just to test things.	St
1.1.2	According to the manual the BIOS offers ten different possible items to boot from.	St
1.1.3	It allows selecting three, and then the option Boot Other.	St
1.1.4	My thoughts would be that the other would only include the 7 unselected ones.	Polite
1.1.5	None of the ten are USB.	St
1.1.6	I guess I'll give the list in the event that someone may want it: floppy, LS120, HDD 1, 2, 3, SCSI, CDROM, LAN.	St
1.1.7	I have a 1 GB sandisk mini cruzer to use.	St
1.1.8	Might want to run things such as Memtest from it.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Doesn't Windows have to load the USB drivers before the ports can be used?	St
1.3.2	I think it does.	St
1.3.3	Jack	St
1.4.1	I don't really want to have a hard drive on the bread board.	St
1.4.2	So even if I put a small op sys on the keychain drive, I guess that I could put a version of DOS on it, and the Win 98 type boot floppy programs, I still have a problem.	St
1.4.3	But Tucson, think about a mobo where it allows booting from USB.	St
1.4.4	It seems that Windows doesn't get involved during the inital boot.	St
1.4.5	[I realize that this mobo doesn't mention booting from USB].	St
1.4.6	I'll check to see if there is a BIOS update.	Sug
1.4.7	I haven't got the CPU for the breadboard yet, really surprised how well the prices on the older AMD XP CPU's has stayed up.	St
1.4.8	Thanx for your interest.	St
1.5.1	that I may have to add a floppy to the bread board.	St
1.6.1	I have seen USB devices that were detected in the startup.	St
1.6.2	There were several machines with AOpen boards and a SATA RAID controller that could not have any usb device with memory pluged into it, not even a label printer or it would look at it first before the PCI RAID card.	St
1.6.3	If it can happen accidently, then it is only a matter of time before the it can be repeated	St
1.7.1	Ray, two items Never tried booting from a USB device.	St
1.7.2	From my understanding if the M/B supports this feature and the USB device is properly formated the system will boot.	St
1.7.3	Second what type of CPU (socket/speed) do you need?	St
1.7.4	Bill	St
1.8.1	AMD XP 2600+ 333 MHz for $71.00, thanx anyway.	St
1.8.2	Using pricewatch, the price range of the AMD XP's, at least, are wild, the minimum price for much slower ones are much higher, and then a higher speed one will be lower.	St
1.8.3	In most cases the very lowest price was from vendors that had a very poor rating, so I bought from one with a very high rating.	St
1.8.4	{hopefully].	St
1.8.5	I did find a link to an HP site from which one can download the code to make a keychain drive bootable.	St
1.8.6	Posted the link to a guy in this same forum that wants to convert his IDE drive to USB [have no idea why].	St
1.8.7	The article that led me to the HP one was by a guy that used the HP software on a Sandisk Mini Cruzer which is what I have.	St
1.8.8	However, my mobo's BIOS doesn't mention booting from USB.	St
1.8.9	However another older MS article regarding the need for the industry to develop othe bootable devices, along with another article, seems to say that at power on &quot;all?&quot; systems look for any device that has int 13h &quot;mentioned&quot; on it.	St
1.8.10	Of course MS talks only about booting into MS Op Systems.	St
1.8.11	I want the keychain drive to actually run the computer with a small DOS like utility or two.	St
1.8.12	Hope that things are still going well with you and your shop.	St
