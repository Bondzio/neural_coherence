1.2.1	Sadly , if the ports are dead and other PS2 and USB keyboards fail then I look to transfering what parts I can into a new box with another compatible motherboard .	St
1.2.2	It 's out of stock , but 423 socket boards can be cheap .	St
1.2.3	http : //www.compgeeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=D850GBACNR-R Then you get a new case and start moving it .	St
1.2.4	The OS hopefully will run on worst case will have to be obtained and installed .	St
1.2.5	Do some checks to see what Sony wants for repair and then how much for motherboard , case/powersupply and maybe an operating system .	St
1.2.6	Best of luck , bob	Polite
1.3.1	hey r. proffitt ... .Sony wants 400 $ just for the motherboard ... .i ca n't deal with that ... are you sure its a 423 socket board for this computer ?	Ques
1.3.2	cause im planning to just buy a motherboard like sony 's PCV-RX model and just use all the other parts like processor and such from sony on the new board ... .	St
1.4.1	You can use google.com to research what a 423 socket CPU looks like as well as a 478 socket CPU .	St
1.4.2	Then you can answer that question .	St
1.4.3	You post is all I know of your machine 's failure .	St
1.4.4	Since you 've tried the other ports with known good keyboards ... 400 is far too much for this repair .	St
1.4.5	You can find boards galore for 99 bucks .	St
1.4.6	I would n't do this .	St
1.4.7	400 gets a new box ... with XP ... http : //www.compgeeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=CMHP552W-R & cat=SYS there are many more out there like this and frankly that repair price is a _____ ( pick a word ) .	St
