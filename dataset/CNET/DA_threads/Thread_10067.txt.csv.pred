1.4.1	Recheck your work again , do n't take anything for granted .	St
1.4.2	Next time it starts to boot , enter the bios section , verify *all* setting and if it can do that alone , very probable the psu is OK , however keep that in mind .	St
1.4.3	Once you verified or reset any bios setting , save upon exit and reboot .	St
1.4.4	It should error or not and hopefully finish the boot process .	St
1.4.5	If th problem returns , replace the bios/CMOS battery .	St
1.4.6	After replacing the battery , follow the above instructions again , what are the results now .	St
1.4.7	If it boots , great you had a bad battery .	St
1.4.8	If not , reduce the psu strain and make the system as simple as possible .	St
1.4.9	If it appears it boots with no HD or CD drives attached then suspect the psu is weak or failing , replace with better one .	St
1.4.10	Check results after replacing psu .	St
1.4.11	Some of the common reboot reasons is power safe feature in bios set to reboot upon error or a heat setting reached .	St
1.4.12	Check those values under whatever name they have , disable or uncheck them , retry for results .	St
1.4.13	Look into areas ... tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	here i would like to add one more thing which i forget that i had pluged off my cd -rom as it is not working properly ... so as i mentioned that i also pluged off my hardisk drive 160 gb sata 2 ... so i think psu must hv enough volatge/current atleast to handle single mobo and graphic card ... . no i am on the same pc which is having prob since 3 hours but there is no prob yet but i can expect as it suddenly comes with out expecting ... . one more thing the red led light of case which i think used for hardisk and blinks on/off as the busy work of hrdisk ... now keeps on glow how ever hardisk drive is connected or not ... but it keeps on glowing ... can i say its some short circuit prob in mobo ?	Ques
1.6.1	Upon disconnecting any device it must be 100 % , fully unplugged .	St
1.6.2	Then refresh the bios of that new status .	St
1.6.3	If the LED glow continues it maybe a problem , but I would n't jump on that alone .	St
1.6.4	If all proves fruitless , then you may have a bad mtrbd.. Its possible to remove from system and test ( cardboard surface ) on the old kitchen table and see what gives .	St
1.6.5	If problem persists then basically , you 've done all you can , new parts ?	Ques
1.6.6	You say you tried another psu , that psu must be equal or even better than old one .	St
1.6.7	Do n't suspect because it worked elsewhere , review what specs it provides , again do n't take anything for granted .	St
1.6.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	You did n't share what you used .	St
1.7.2	Also , tell us what you did to research every BIOS setting .	St
1.7.3	I was not happy to learn on a few boards you had to change the RAM supply voltage manually .	St
1.7.4	But then again it 's something a home builder would expect .	St

1.8.1	i am inspecting my pc oon trial basis since last night and it was working all fine but today morning it again starts restarting again and again ... now what i did is taken out my mobo from case and re-asemble it on the non electrolytic sheet and make it ON ... . things are looking fine ... still observing ... . i think it might be a prob of some over heating inside my mobo ... . as here summer is arrived ... with in a week i will face humid weather .	St
1.8.2	since 3 hours ... no such restarting prob accur but i am still expecting but i pray if it dont happened again ... by the way what if i upgrade my bios software ?	Ques
