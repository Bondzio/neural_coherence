<s> Where do you locate the Network Key for a wireless router. </s>
<s> I am trying to establish a wireless internet connection with a 2Wire wireless router connected to the host computer. </s>
<s> The second computer recongines the 2wire network but because the network is locked I can not access it. </s>
<s> It asks for the Network Key which can either be 5-13 ascii characters or 10-26 hexadecimal characters and 40 or 104 bits depending on the network configuration. </s>
<s> Please help, Thank you. </s>
<s> contact the routers manufacturer for this information. </s>
<s> FAQs and there forums might help as well. </s>
<s> Keys usually come on the box it came in or are on a label on the disk. </s>
<s> This might be an IP problem if your running them at the same time. </s>
<s> You may need a second connection/line. </s>
<s> See the routers support site first then contact your IP. </s>
<s> Let me know the results, report back, please. </s>
<s> You will find that on the router. </s>
<s> Access the router program and go to it's wireless or security section. </s>
<s> There you will find it set to WEP or WPA and a list of keys. </s>
<s> While in the router program make a record of it's SSID, channel setting, and the Key. </s>
<s> Key size is dependent on which encryption is used. </s>
<s> You will need to enter all that data into your wireless connection on the computer. </s>
<s> You should create your own router password and encryption keys. </s>
<s> Don't use any defaults as these are as good as public knowledge to those who want to access the device. </s>
<s> So, don't leave any of them as is. </s>
<s> You can generally create what's called a &quot;passphrase&quot; which will convert to a numeric key. </s>
<s> The passphrase can be some short bit of text you can remember easier than a long string of numbers. </s>
