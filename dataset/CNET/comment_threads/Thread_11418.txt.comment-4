Life span is about 2 years till you may need repairs or an expensive part.
I know of no hidden running costs.
All the printers I looked at years ago gave expected pages for the drum, fuser and such.
HOWEVER the real costs soar when folk do full page color prints.
Most of the page counts are for 5% coverage.
You can do the math if you move to 100% coverage.
