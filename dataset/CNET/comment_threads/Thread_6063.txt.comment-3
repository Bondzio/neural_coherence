Very basic copiers exist, try looking at Canon or Xerox models for &quot;stand alone&quot; operation.
However, you mention $200 and that really is too low, maybe more into the $400 range if you're lucky.
You best bet is to check any decent office outlet center or go online even those same office centers.
Of course, you look into a rental/lease for a month or more and see if that's possible but have all your ducks in a row in order to make the best use out of it.
