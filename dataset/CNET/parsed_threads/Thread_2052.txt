<s> I am almost sure this is a hardware compatability issue but someone let me know what they think. </s>
<s> I bought a barebone kit( ecs motherboard, duron 1.3). </s>
<s> When i first tried to load windows 2k it finished but had missing files(IE and others). </s>
<s> Since i cannot get the setup to finish. </s>
<s> Always get message #### file missing cannot complete setup.(ex. </s>
<s> inf file txtsetup.sif corrupt or missing) sometimes i get an I/O error 0010101. </s>
<s> Anyway, I have tried diff. </s>
<s> os's and boot disk etc. </s>
<s> but linux loads and runs fine. </s>
<s> My main question is how can i check the hardware compatibility with windows? </s>
<s> Any other suggestions are welcome as i have been trying to get this machine working for over a month. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help </s>
<s> not clear from your message, is this the only win2k disk you're using? </s>
<s> if so, perhaps it is damaged and some files are corrupted. </s>
<s> did you try a reformat and clean reinstall? </s>
<s> my next guess would be a faulty CD drive, but if linux is loading, that seems unlikely. </s>

<s> All dance around CD copies, dodgey CDROM drives, overtaxed power supplies and more. </s>
<s> You must have up to date BIOS and such to load Windows 2000. </s>
<s> Linux is a sign the hardware is ready for Linux and means that you are close, but not ready for 2000. </s>
