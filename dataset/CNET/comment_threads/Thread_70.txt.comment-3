I have moved the computer to a much cooler location in an air conditioned room.
In addition to cooling it off with a fan, would vacuuming the inside of it help get rid of any dust it might have??
I tried to re-install the operating system, and it says that the hard drive can't be formatted, so the hard drive is really messed up.
I looked at the prices of a replacement, and also possibly a new operating system, and both of these prices are reasonable, I am just worried that installing a new hard drive on the affected computer system might possibly damage the new hard drive or something.
