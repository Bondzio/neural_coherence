but in almost every case, i make a boot diskette (  ), place the awbflash.exe (fake name, you use what they tell you) and the nubios.bin file (again fake, use what they supply) and then boot that diskette the method is so simple that i never read the instructions more than once.
either you do a awbflash nubios.bin on the command line or you type awbflash and answer it with the nubios.bin answer and off you go.
if you cut power to the board before it's done, then the board may never work again.
so don't do that.
---------------------- part 2. be aware that not all board makers resolved that i/o error.
in that case, you replace the motherboard.
