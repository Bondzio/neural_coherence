need to go study how ip addresses really work, it is a fundamental design feature to solve this issue.
the subnet mask is key.
all devices know based on subnet masks which ip addresses reside on which networks.
no matter what you change the isp router still knows.
even if you did some hacking and managed to send data with a ip that is not yours the ( ie ipspoofing) most isp would detect this and drop those packets before anyone else sees them.
