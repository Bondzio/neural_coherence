I've connected it to my computer via USB, and it worked flawlessly. However, when I try connecting it via Firewire, I generally get the connected hardware sound, then nothing happens for a while, and then it might eventually turn up in my computer as &quot;Local Disk: H&quot; or something, but when I try opening it, I get an I/O error. When I open up device manager, it's under disk drives as: &quot;WD My Book IEEE 1394 SBP2 Device&quot;, with a yellow exclamation mark next to it. In properties it says something like &quot;This device is unable to start&quot; or something similar, and the location is &quot;LUN 0&quot;. I'd really appreciate it if you could help me get it working with Firewire, as the only reason I bought it was for the Firewire connection.

Where firewire connectivity comes into play and is a necessity, is with camcorder input. Bob is right with Windows being iffy with FW. Mac on the other hand seems to book right along.

Hi....what happens if you unplug the Firewire cable (are you using 1394a or 1394b) for about 5 seconds and then plug it back in. Another attempt would be to try Updating the driver from Device Manager...just right click on the listing with the Yellow bang and select Update Driver. Let us know what happens.

617	5	331965	2990559	2988225	thecite	2/27/09 9:50 PM	1.2357714E12	Yep, connected fine on my Mac.	Well, I plugged it into my old G3 iMac and it connected within a few seconds. So obviously the problem is with Windows, any suggestions?
