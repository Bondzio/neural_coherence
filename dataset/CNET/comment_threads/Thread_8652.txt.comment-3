stechmagnet I am deleting your posts.
The two links you provide have nothing to do with the discussions you are posting in ad that makes it spam.
We delete spam posts routinely.
In addition, those links you gave each show a red warning from WOT, my browser web security add-on.
You will want to sort that out.
