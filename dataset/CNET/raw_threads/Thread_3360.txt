They are connected wirelessly. They will both connect to the internet, however, only the A205-one will print on (new) HP7280 printer. In Control panel Network and Sharing page, the settings are identical on both computers. I also have an older HP desktop, which runs XP and is connected to the router with an ethernet cable.. it will also print wirelessly on the printer. I don't understand why!! What do I do??? HELP
