<s> My ATI 9600 256mb sapphire atlantis is running a lot slower than it is supposed to. </s>
<s> So i check out Catalyst Control center to see what my AGP speed is set at for my motherboard. </s>
<s> it is currently set at off. </s>
<s> so i try to change it to x8 which it is built for. </s>
<s> but, my system deems the change unsafe and sets it back to off. </s>
<s> is this a hardware problem or somthing i can do with software. </s>
<s> (i need to change the AGP speed to x8) please help </s>
<s> I remember stories like that with some older motherboards and there was no cure since the board maker never released a new BIOS or patch to get the 8X slot to 8x. </s>
<s> Could be &quot;one of those.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> yeah it is an older Asus that i bought off ebay. </s>
<s> um the model is P4S800. </s>

<s> Hello, Latest BIOS? </s>
<s> 8X AGP activated in BIOS? </s>
<s> Latest MB Chipset drivers? </s>
<s> Latest Video Card drivers & DirectX? </s>
<s> Drivers properly installed? </s>
<s> If all this is done, try in a different computer. </s>
<s> If all the drivers are current & the problem still exists, your looking at a hardware issue. </s>
<s> Good luck & keep us informed. </s>
