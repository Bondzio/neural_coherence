This is normal.... XP does not accept this type off Hwd change.
The real problem is that E-Machine uses Ghost to create the recovery disk, an exact copy of your old Hwd and at this point they are worthless.... Slave your existing install to another system and back-up your existing files.
Purchase a copy of XP upgrade, boot from the disk.
Follow the prompts to delete the existing partition and re-install XP.
Any drivers that you will need can be found on -machines web site.
Do Not Format the existing copy of XP as the upgrade disk will not work.
