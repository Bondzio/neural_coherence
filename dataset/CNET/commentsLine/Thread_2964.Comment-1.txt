hello all, i use dual samsung 245bw syncmaster monitors and i've recently noticed that one of them displays a slight yellow or off-white hue.
i use the exact same display settings on both monitors.
additionally, i tried playing with the settings on the suspect monitor and it doesn't seem to help the problem at all.
below are links to two pictures of the problem.
these aren't the best photos in the world, but hopefully they help.
the monitor in question is the one on the right.
thanks!
troy
