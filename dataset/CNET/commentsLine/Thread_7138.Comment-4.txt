what willy said makes the most sense.
i also figured the reason canon also uses color for black text is to ensure the color nozzles do not dry out and clog while the printhead is moving left and right while printing documents.
there is also a black cartridge only setting in the driver option which i think is meant to be only when you have depleted your color cartridge and have no time to replace one.
that means even if the printhead on the color tank clogs it's no big deal as you're going to replace it anyway.
i simply refill my cartridges and find that this way, the overall cost of running this thing is quite low.
and the good thing is, if the printhead wears out, simply buy a new cartridge, you get a new printhead and ink to go with it.
