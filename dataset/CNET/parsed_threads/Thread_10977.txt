<s> Dose anyone know of a program that lets you share hardware? </s>
<s> Doesn't make much sense to share one mouse with 3 people at the same time. </s>
<s> Or do you mean something else? </s>

<s> Years ago and even today you see attempts to share &quot;expensive&quot; PCs. </s>
<s> After too many of these that cost more than a PC, why would we do that? </s>
<s> Or were you asking about something else? </s>

<s> hardware like graphic cards and motherboards </s>
<s> When my graphic card is displaying on the screen, more than one person can see the output. </s>
<s> It's shared! </s>
<s> When my computer's motherboard is working, I might share a folder on the network. </s>

<s> I think there is no such a software that shares the hardware.We can't share same hardware with the other system.But there are some hardware such as printer we can share with different systems connected with the same LAN. </s>
<s> the processing capacity (motherboard) is used by all clients. </s>
<s> We all share the motherboards that google has when executing a search. </s>
<s> All you need is a multi-user OS and a way to connect multiple clients. </s>
<s> An average mainframe 15 years ago shared it's processing capacity between 100'ers of simultaneous interactive users. </s>
<s> Windows Vista doesn't really support that. </s>
<s> Windows Server version fare much better, running things like your database (SQL Server), mail (Exchange Server) and documents (Sharepoint server). </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Programs running on the server with the results shown on your own screen. </s>
<s> So effectively you share the processing power (motherboard) of that server. </s>
<s> That's commonly used in businesses. </s>
<s> But it's very uncommon for home use. </s>
