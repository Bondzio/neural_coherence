<s> Yes, I have the Linksys WTR54GS I just got yesterday and when I plug the router into the outlet(regular home outlet), my laptop sees the router and IP of the router and all of that but It wil connect to the internet. </s>
<s> I get the full 54Mbps but no internet. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> does your Internet come? </s>
<s> Free wireless Internet is beginning to appear in some large cities, all others will pay a cable or DSL provider. </s>
<s> I have DSL at home. </s>
<s> But I thought thats what the mobile wireless router was for? </s>
<s> For you to hook up the router in any place you have a outlet,and create a small wirleless network? </s>
<s> the modem's ethernet port to the router's WAN (Internet) port via CAT5 cabling. </s>
<s> If this is your setup I would refer to the router's manual for more concise instructions. </s>
<s> then the wireless device (laptop etc.) </s>
<s> can be anywhere within the range. </s>
<s> The back of the box that it came in said that if you wanted to use it just as a router you would have to hook it up with the DSL line (picture on back of the box) then the modem to the internet link port. </s>
<s> But beside that picture it said &quot;OR&quot; just plug the mobile router in, and you can get a wirless connection. </s>
<s> I will try the DSL line today. </s>
<s> 'as a router you would have to hook it up with the DSL line' OR 'plug the mobile router in...' Meaning, Plug it in to the DSL line... NOT just any line. </s>
<s> that WRT54GS can be use as a router only or as a wireless access point.. OR as a repeater. </s>
