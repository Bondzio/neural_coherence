First: In two NIC and ICS running, usually there is a configuration for each NIC (in IE, Tools, Internet Options, Connections, LAN Setting) one for file sharing and the other for internet access...You have to know which NIC for each.
Second: prior to windows XP days, you might have to uninstall and reinstall ICS and remove and add TCP/IP protocol.
Third: Check your TCP/IP binding.. (in windows ME, tcp/ip should be 'binding' to client microsoft network and file and printer sharing)-- (in stand alone win 9x/me, this should be unbind).
Again its only a few thought...
