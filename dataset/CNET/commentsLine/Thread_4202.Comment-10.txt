yep, it's out of the case and on the cardboard.
i only have memory, graphics and floppy on the board and the start switch and speaker connected.
i'm not sure what you mean by your post, i didn't mention windows in my last post??
because i didn't have the keyboard connected i got a keyboard error and the cmos checksum error-defaults loaded error, but satisfied that it started i just shut it down to try and restart it again so i didn't get it to boot from the floppy, then, of course, it wouldn't restart.
i have always been able to start it the first time from either a boot disk or normally into windows.
either way i have never been able to restart it again until hourrrrrrrs later.
