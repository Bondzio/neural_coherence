so everything will work the same with my network?
the only difference is that instead of haveing a modem that gets a signal from my cable line i will have a modem that gets a signal from my phone line, right?
i wont have to worry about having a computer establish some sort of connection so that the rest of the computers can get online right?
thanks for your help.
