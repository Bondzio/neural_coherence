Changed from Comcast to ATT/Yahoo DSL but it still has Comcast on the top of the browser window....&quot;Microsoft Internet Explorer presented by Comcast&quot;.
I've searched files and folders and everything is deleted that I had from Comcast.
Why is it still on there?
I'm confused!
Any suggestions?
Thanks!
Lucy
