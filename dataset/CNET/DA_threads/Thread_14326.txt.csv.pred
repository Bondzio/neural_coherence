1.1.1	Hello am looking for help on expanding the range of my network .	St
1.1.2	To put in simple & quot ; What options does anybody have when trying to expand their network in general ? ?	Ques
1.1.3	And more specially My home network does not seem to reach my room which is also another smaller house in the backyard of my home .	St
1.1.4	I those & quot ; Range Expanders or Repeaters & quot ; still dont work what other options exsit ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.5	I think i may have a clue as to what products i would need i just wont understand how the setup would be exactly ? ?	Ques
1.1.6	Am thinking & quot ; Access Points & quot ; or & quot ; Bridges & quot ; but on still not exactly sure what the functions of these two devices are , what are they supposed to do ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thank you very much	St
1.2.1	It sounds as if you 're speaking specifically in terms of wireless but a combination of wired and wireless might be your best solution .	St
1.2.2	Not knowing how far your room is from the main house , I still have to wonder if you could use wire .	St
1.2.3	You 'd want a product rated for under ground use and you 'd have to trench that distance .	St
1.2.4	It would give you the best possible connection .	St
1.2.5	As for bridges versus access points .	St
1.2.6	A wireless bridge would be used to connect two physical networks when wire is n't practical .	St
1.2.7	In a sense , it would be like connecting two Ethernet hubs or switches together to expand the size of the network .	St
1.2.8	An access point will connect multiple wireless devices to a network .	St
1.2.9	A wireless router is sort of an access point with the added ability to act as a DHCP server ( regular access points do n't do that ) and connect to the WAN ( wide area network ) which is your internet connection .	St
1.3.1	Yes I should have been more clear about what type of network i want to expand .	St
1.3.2	Its Striclty Wireless so my question earlier was what options do have when trying to expand my home wirless network ? ?	Ques
1.3.3	Or what options exsit in general for anybody trying to expand a wirless network ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.4	So i definitly dont have the option of just running wire because that would defeat the purpose of having my laptop , i want to be able to use my laptop wirlessly anywhere in my house area and outside as well without having to plug it into an Ethernet cable that ive ran from the main rounter .	St
1.3.5	So then i understand that a wireless brigde is only to connect two pyscial networks together so i would not be able to use that then right ?	Ques
1.3.6	since i dont need to connect two networks together i just want to expand the range of my wireless network so that the signal can to broacast further .	Sug
1.3.7	Like for example how to campus building make there entire campus wireless what do they use ? ?	Ques
1.3.8	And office building make their entire building wireless which are many , many floors i dont think they all pay for satellite techology because wouldnt that type of internet access only allow for certain computers accepting the signal like a cell phone ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.9	It doesnt just broadcast a big wireless signal to everybody at the building or campus location ? ?	Ques
1.3.10	Also are you saying that i could use an access point to expand my wirless network ? ?	Ques
1.3.11	Or what are my options then for expanding the signal of my wireless network if those repeaters or range expanders still dont reach ? ?	Ques
1.3.12	?	Ques
1.4.1	We have the powerline wifi expander from the usual makers and for real cheap we have POST # 17 of our forum sticky .	St
1.4.2	There 's always a way .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	You would use a combination of wire and wireless devices .	St
1.5.2	You could get a wired router and a number of access points .	Sug
1.5.3	You 'd set up the access points identically except maybe for their broadcast channel .	St
1.5.4	Range expanders are an option but I 've no personal experience with these .	St
1.5.5	My own home has two available access points and one wired router .	St
1.5.6	It 's a 4 level split and one AP is on the first level and the other on the 4th .	St
1.5.7	I ran cable from the basement up into the attic , dropped the wire into a wall and installed a jack for an Ethernet cable .	St
1.5.8	The upstairs AP plugs into that or I can unplug it and go wired for higher LAN speed .	St
1.5.9	Everything works fine .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	i am staying in such a house where there is no signal for mobile or for any data card.so what can i do to increase signal atleast for data card inside my room	St
1.8.1	As there is no signal , there is no booster that would help .	St
1.8.2	You ca n't boost zero .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
