so, you are currently running windows xp professional on a computer with a pentium iii processor (cpu) and 256mb of ram (memory).
what is the mfg.
and model name of the computer?
many pentium iii computers were shipped with windows 98, so any drivers on the original cds from the computer mfg.
will likely have windows 98 drivers that may not work with xp.
you usually can go to the computer mfg.
website to download the latest drivers and save them to some disk (cd-r, usb flash drive, floppy, etc.)
before the hd format and installation of windows.
make sure you have the windows xp pro product key.
if you are using an upgrade version of windows xp pro, make sure you have the product key for windows 98. also, before you format the drive and install windows, it would be a good time to check the mfg.
for a bios update that you can download and install.
as always, the first thing to do is backup important files.
