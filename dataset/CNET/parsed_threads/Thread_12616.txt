<s> For some reason, whenever I start up my computer the motherboard intones (in yes, a feminine voice,) &quot;Your keyboard and mouse may have a problem&quot;. </s>
<s> Now, my keyboard and mouse do not have a problem. </s>
<s> They work just fine. </s>
<s> The only other time my motherboard ever spoke to me was when I installed RAM that wasn't compatible. </s>
<s> Then it said: &quot;Your memory may have a problem.&quot; Except, last time there WAS a problem- the memory didn't work. </s>
<s> This time there ISN'T a problem- I&quot;m using the keyboard and mouse now with no issue. </s>
<s> Any idea how to make that thing stop talking? </s>
<s> Typical female...hmmm I think I'll stop there before I get myself in trouble. </s>
<s> I suspect the msg your getting is because the bios probe is finding something it does not like about the mouse and keyboard. </s>
<s> Did this ever work? </s>
<s> If so what has changed? </s>
<s> Enter your system &quot;bios&quot; and check the setting. </s>
<s> Usually within the 1st page, there's a setting for error procedure, if kybd. </s>
<s> does it stop, etc. </s>
<s> Hit F1 to continue. </s>
<s> As for the voice, again there's some setting to disable &quot;voice&quot; though it should report an error via some text message. </s>
<s> It should be explained in your mtrbd. </s>
<s> or system manual. </s>
<s> If none, goto the support website and get one for your model# mtrbd./system and download it for reference. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> How cool! </s>
<s> but i guess it can get annoying like a mom. </s>
<s> Just more bells and whistles that you can live without. </s>
<s> You didn't have it before and really its of no real benefit for many. </s>
<s> Like the seat belt buzzer when not connected, drove people nuts, now now buzzer in new cars at least a more friendly &quot;ding&quot;. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> My AOpen motherboard has the same exact error messages. </s>
<s> As Willy wrote, check the BIOS settings. </s>
<s> Also make sure the kbd and mouse don't have stuck buttons. </s>
<s> Unplug them and replug them into the ports and then start your computer. </s>
<s> If USB, try different ports. </s>
<s> On my Asus MoBo it has that talking crap too, but it comes with a CD to install a program that monitors that. </s>
<s> Maybe someone else (or you) changed the bootup message to the &quot;somethings wrong with the keyboard message&quot; and there really is nothing wrong with your stuff. </s>
<s> I changed my bootup message to MC Hammer saying &quot;U can't touch this&quot;. </s>
<s> ~BreNt </s>
<s> most asus mobo have spoken POST codes insted of that reg beep on most mobo's </s>
<s> most asus mobo have spoken POST codes insteed on that reg beep id keep it on for in case coming goes wrong </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> It may be an Asus board, but not necessarily. </s>
<s> Many mfgs use the same components for such things. </s>
<s> This is not exclusive to Asus. </s>
<s> how do I get into BIOS? </s>
<s> Is that like entering Startup- just hit F-something until it gives you a menu instead of windows? </s>
<s> At startup, just after the PC is turned on, the monitor often displays a message like 'Hit Del or F2 to enter BIOS.Setup If you don't see that message...try it anyway. </s>
<s> If neither works check your system or motherboard manual. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> &quot;halt on all, but keyboard&quot; (which I suspect is grammatically incorrect.) </s>
<s> that is the selected option. </s>
<s> There is also: &quot;all errors&quot;, &quot;no errors&quot;, &quot;all but, diskette,&quot; &quot;all but diskette and keyboard.&quot; I have no idea what they are halting. </s>
<s> Should I choose &quot;all errors&quot;? </s>
<s> I also noted that &quot;box genie&quot; is turned on, which is the voice, I suppose, (but who's ever heard of a female genie?) </s>
<s> I dont want to turn off the voice, I just want to stop it from reporting an error when there is none. </s>
<s> I tried unplugging and replugging the mouse and keyboard, and it didn't help. </s>
<s> Anything else I should look for in BIOS? </s>
<s> And if the voice bothers you...just turn it off too...the only time I've ever heard is is at bootup and it doesn't affect your sound otherwise. </s>
<s> You can always turn it back on if desired. </s>
<s> Just keep in mind if you have to troubleshoot the system...you may want to turn these features back on temporarily. </s>
<s> Good to hear you found it. </s>
