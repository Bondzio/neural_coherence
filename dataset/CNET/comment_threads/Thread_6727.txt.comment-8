I went into a local electronics store and tried to type on the MacBook keyboard.
It wasn't pretty.
My hands are too large.
The MB Pro keyboard looks identical but I had a much better experience typing on it, fewer errors and overall just a better feel.
Before you decide on which computer to buy you should go to the store and demo all of them.
Good luck!
