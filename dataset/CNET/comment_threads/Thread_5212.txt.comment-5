Strange, but I popped in my Stargate Blu-Ray disc today and it plays fine.
Willy Wonka used to play fine, too, but now my system can't see the disk.
Why would it see other Blu-Ray discs, but not a disc that had played once with ease?
If I can't get a workable answer, I'll have to buy a fifty dollar LG disc player.
