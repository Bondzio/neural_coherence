<s> Looking for a &quot;possible&quot; CPU upgrade. </s>
<s> I'm running a EPOX EP-9NDA3J with a Athlon XP 4000 64bit along with 2 gigs of OCS ram and a XF 7800 GS. </s>
<s> I'm heavily into gaming. </s>
<s> So now, if I purchase a Athlon XP 64 x2 3800, would I benefit at all or would I loose power. </s>
<s> If not the 3800, what about the 4200, 4400 or 4800-which is rare, and prices are through the roof for socket 939 boards. </s>
<s> Any advice would help. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> The games mostly run on single cores so that extra core will assume duties for the OS. </s>
<s> The results I see is better gameplay. </s>
<s> But since you are not increasing the core's speed the payoff here is minimal. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> your athlon 64 4000+ runs at 2.4ghz. </s>
<s> you'd need to get an x2 4600+ to match your single-threaded performance. </s>
<s> the only socket 939 x2s readily available are x2 3800+ and x2 4200+ which would both be slower in most games than your current CPU. </s>
<s> So I'd have to either get the dual proc 4600 or 4800 to match the current sing proc 4000. </s>
<s> And getting the dual 4200 would't be enough to see a difference. </s>
<s> So I'm pretty much stuck with my current CPU. </s>
<s> I was trying to hold out on the major upgrade. </s>
<s> I'd love a x2 4800 but prices are outrageous! </s>
<s> $350 plus! </s>
<s> For instance the time rendering a DVD is nearly cut in half when I use such am upgraded machine. </s>
<s> You should get some boost since you'll have at least one core's full attention to the game and the other would be handling the OS chores. </s>
<s> That's my experience so far. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> They offer a number of dual core processors that you could look at...the 165, 170, 175, 180 and 185( see links below...don't think you'll be disappointed) http://www.amdcompare.com/us-en/opteron/ Readily available at Newegg...the 185 is $235 http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2+50001028+40000343+1050706979+1051707439+1302820275&name=Dual-Core </s>
