thanks for replying.
i guess wifi isn't relevant, sorry.
i connect my drive to the mm player via usb.
i think i threw the manunal out.
i thought about experimenting and testing that out once i get back, i'm currently not home.
i'll have to wait till sunday evening.
i'll post the results then!
and thanks again!
