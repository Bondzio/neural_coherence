i want to have access to my network, specifically, my mass storage, from the internet without running through a computer.
mirra makes a mass storage device wit a couple of usb2 outlets which will allow me to add stand alone hard drives or other devices to it, and then allow me to access it from the internet, but their system is propietary, in that i have to log on to their website to use it.
what if they go out of business, or their server is down, or if someone hacks into their system and finds a way into my network?
what if they decide to charge for this service in the future?
i don't trust the concept they offer... i want a peice of hardware that will act as an internet porthole through which i can access my network.
any ideas?
thanks!
