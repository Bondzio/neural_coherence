but it sounds like you're going to have to reset the netgear router and start over.
set it up like the forum sticky suggests.
basically, you'll find that the setup wizard should work.
after reset, everything is lost and gets reset back to factory settings.
you can configure manually, if you'd like.
(  ) login  updating the firmware in the wireless router.
broadcast ssid(change this.
it will make it easier to connect) using wpa-psk(tkip) security.
most wireless devices work best with this type of security.
mixed b and g mode(n if available) use channels 1, 6 or 11. most wireless devices work best on these channels.
save and exit.
power everything off.
wait 30 seconds and then power everything on.
try and connect.
everything should connect.
