i have a main desktop computer as well as a laptop.
i also have an hp printer connected to the desktop via usb.
i would like to be able to print wirelessly from the laptop using the same printer.
the printer is also able to connect via &quot;built-in networking to connect to 10base-t/100base-tx networks.&quot; i'm not sure what that means, but there is an ethernet port on the back of the printer as well (or maybe lan??
i don't know the difference).
so, how can i accomplish this?
let me know if you need computer info.
thanks!
