the moderator of the iomega zip forum says catagorically that only usb will work with vista.iomega claims all their zips will work with vista and true to the rip-offs they are, continue to sell disks and drives as though that were true.my 250 atapi will not work with vista or windows 7 even when i try to emulate hard drives,floppies, etc.
they are as dishonest as the day is long.
