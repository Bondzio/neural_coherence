<s> well, we are not sure what you need this pc for. </s>
<s> if it's basic tasks like email and using the internet, that isn't a bad pc. </s>
<s> but since you come here asking for upgrades, maybe you are gaming or just want a faster pc. </s>
<s> what i would do is just buy a whole new pc. </s>
<s> trust me, it won't be worth it to upgrade that pc (depending on what you use it for). </s>
<s> everything is near out of date. </s>
<s> i would buy a new mobo (socket 939) 1GB of ddr400 memory &lt;200GB hard drive a nvidia 6600 graphics card (PCIe) an amd 64 3200+ cpu (s939) new case psu antec, ocz, enermax make great psus, &lt;400w the rest is up to you. </s>
<s> i can't really recomend upgrades since i don't know what you are looking forward to. </s>
<s> i just named parts that would bring you into the current generation of pc components. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> Unless you have some higher demands that system should be fine for many years, except for bragging purposes. </s>
<s> More memory will not likely help at all. </s>
<s> It uses PC 2100, thus I am assuming [yes I know what that means LOL], that the mobo doesn't support anything faster than PC2100. </s>
<s> ill just buy a brand new computher, by buy i mean ill buy the part sepratly and reable it myself hehe </s>
<s> carefully remove side cover from pc, then also very carefully remove old ram, and aslo beware of static electricity! </s>
<s> take ram with you to say best buy circuit city etc, and tell them i need more of this! </s>
<s> all the info needed to get correct ram will be on the ram stick u removed! </s>
