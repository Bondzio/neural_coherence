From Dong Ngo's review (November 7, 2008): &quot;If you plan to have a wireless network in a neighborhood that doesn't already have too many wireless signals, we would recommend the Belkin N+ over any other wireless-N routers.&quot; http://reviews.cnet.com/routers/belkin-n-wireless-router/4505-3319_7-33361546.html?tag=mncol;lst But... How can you know how many wireless signals are in the neighborhood?
And how many are too many?
