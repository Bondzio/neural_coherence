Hello, I have a computer with a graphics card which allows for hdmi and DVI outputs, there is no vga port on it.
However, on my motherboard there is a VGA port which has a cover blocking it (placed by the Manufacturer, HP).
I have tried simply connecting a monitor to this port but it is not recognized.
I cant find any settings on the computer to use this on board port.
is there something I am missing, or is it simply not possible.
I am trying to be able to have dual screen monitors, without having to use the HDMI port.
Thanks.
