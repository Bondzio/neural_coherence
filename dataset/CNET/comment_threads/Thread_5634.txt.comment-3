Thanks for your input.
These are the model #'s i briefly tested.
Looks like I would have to step up to the Belkin N600 for wireless printing support according to website.
Most likely the printer will be hardwired to the router though.
Just didn't have time to get that far and might not make it back to vacation home for another 3 months which is beyond walle return.
Next time i'm down there I will buy both the Belkin n600 and cisco equivalent to the 2 I've tested already.
See which one fits the bill.
Just wasn't sure if a laptop would be able to print to the printer even if the printer was hardwired.
Wish i would have had more time to test.
