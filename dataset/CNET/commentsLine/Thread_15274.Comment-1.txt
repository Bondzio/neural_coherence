i'm on a free wifi provided by the community, so i shouldn't complain.
but i will anyway, i just need some ammunition.
when i go to  i usually get 4,000 kbps down, 1,000 kbps up, or so.
when i'm actually trying to * use * the internet, things get tricky.
i get hung browser, page not found, no connectivity, etc.
a page either loads rapidly, or not at all, with no rhyme or reason.
is there a utility that i can use to check the * reliability * of my connection?
something that i can create a log, and send to the network people and embarrass them.
or, is it possible i have configuration problems?
i'm using windows vista home premium, with a dell 1395 wireless card.
thanx.
dave
