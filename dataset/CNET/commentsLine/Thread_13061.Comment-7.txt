i can see where you may have thought your pc could have ht by looking at this link indicating ht tech suported the 533mhz system bus: 3.06mhz.
however, scrolling down, your 915gv chipset is not listed as one of those with ht.
they list these intel desktop chipsets with 533/400 mhz as having ht: 910gl, 865p, 850e, 845pe, 845ge, 845gv, 845e, 845g i also note your pent 4 processor number 519 is not listed with those that have ht support.
