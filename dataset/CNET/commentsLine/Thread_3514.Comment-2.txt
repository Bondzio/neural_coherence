isn't upgradable, really.
a new motherboard and processor are needed as a bundle, then you'll need ram to match.
i just rebuilt my web server and got an elitegroup k8m800-m2 motherboard with onboard sound, video, and lan, an amd sempron 1.6 ghz processor, 512 meg of kingston ram.
the board cost $79.99, the processor cost $59.99, and the ram cost $59.99.
i kept the hd and optical drive.
the board also has 6 usb-2 ports.
i found an oem copy of wp home here  i installed everything in about a day.
runs like a top.
