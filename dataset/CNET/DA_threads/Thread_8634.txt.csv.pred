1.1.1	COMP : 3.0 Intel 2GB Ram GeForce 6800 19 & quot ; WideScreen LCD PC/TV 19 & quot ; LCD Moniter -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Ok on to the problem i 'm having..	St
1.1.2	I do n't know much about computer hardware so its been hard trying to figure this one out .	St
1.1.3	I am trying to get my display shown on two moniters but I do n't really want the extended desktop .	St
1.1.4	Just want one moniter to show exactly whats on the other one..	St
1.1.5	Both Moniters support DVI cables and VGA cables and I was wondering is there a possible way to hook up one as VGA and one as DVI or what do i have to do to solve this problem ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thank you	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	which software ?	Ques
1.4.1	your GeForce 6800 should come with an Nvdia software for just that purpose -- output on multi-monitor .	St
1.4.2	some vga cards are smart enough to detect if there are two ( or 3 ) monitors connected to it .	St
1.4.3	it would automatically configure itself when you boot .	St
1.4.4	if not , then.. right click on your desktop & gt ; properties & gt ; settings .	St
1.4.5	here you can configure you monitors ' physical setup and extend your desktop .	St
1.4.6	but since you do n't want to extend your desktop ( i belive ''clone '' is what prefer ) , click on advanced , then the GeForce tab .	St
1.4.7	look for a button you can use to enable nView .	St
1.4.8	after enabling it you should look for a tab where you can set the monitors to span or clone .	St
1.4.9	I 'm sorry if i ca n't be more specific since there a some variations on VGA software GUIs .	St
1.4.10	there might be an easier way than this though , lets just wait for the others to look at your problem .	St
1.4.11	but do n't you worry , if there 's anyone who can make your comoputing life easier , its the forum guys here .	St
1.4.12	life is good	St
1.5.1	Thanks.. well I did get it to work and its perfect.. thank you for the help but now i realized new problems .	St
1.5.2	First is playing games or full screen applications .	St
1.5.3	How can I maybe temporarily disable the mouse and put it into a hotkey from going to the other screen ?	Ques
1.5.4	That way i can play the game but when I want to move back to the other screen i enable the mouse to move there again so it can work .	St
1.5.5	Seeing as how many games need you to maybe turn around or scroll the map it becomes annoying with the mouse constantly moving to the other side .	St
1.5.6	Also how do i keep a full screen app from minimizing when something else is activated ?	Ques
1.5.7	Thank you again !	St
1.6.1	i 'm not so sure what you really want to do , but let 's give it a shot .	St
1.6.2	if you cloned your desktop , your mouse pointer should n't pop-out on the other mnonitor .	St
1.6.3	sound like you decided to span your desktop instead ?	Ques
1.6.4	anyway , most games would lock your mouse to the primary monitor when full-screened .	St
1.6.5	that way theres no chance of your mouse moving all the way to the secondary monitor .	St
1.6.6	the only way you can play a game and work at the same time is if you open a game in window-mode .	St
1.6.7	also , active windows should n't minimize automatically even if you activate another one on the other monitor .	Sug
1.6.8	life is good	St
