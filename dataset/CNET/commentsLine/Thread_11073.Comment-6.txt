it's an outstanding monitor.
i have 2 of them.
you will be very happy.
use the 1280x768 setting.
if you are making the jump from crt 800x600 it will take a little getting used to, but well worth it.
in 30 days someone will need a gun to take it away from you.
nice looking white monitor with a sharp, bright, colorful picture!
if you've never run a widescreen, you're in for a real treat.
