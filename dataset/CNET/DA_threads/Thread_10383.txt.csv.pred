1.1.1	I recently installed an additional hard drive to my computer, I used the CS jumpers in my &quot;master&quot; &quot;slave&quot; drives&quot;; when I rebooted my computer I went into the BIOS and selected Auto to configure my drives.	St
1.1.2	the second driuve was not recognized immediatoly so I installed the driver that came with my Maxtor drive.	St
1.1.3	after I installed the driver, the computer recognized the drive and assigned new drive letters but aqt the same time it does not recognizes my dvd drive that I had installed a few weeks earlier (using the IDE connector cable for the original CD drive ) using the CS configuration.	St
1.1.4	Prior to installing my new hard drive I had the following: C:\Hard drive D:\ CD drive E:\DVD burner now, it shows: C:\ 1st hard drive D:\ 2d hard drive E&quot;\ CD drive HELP!	St

1.2.1	For your hard disks CS is likely PROPER on the proper 80 conductor cables.	St
1.2.2	But most CD and such in stock computers use the older 40 conductor cables you use the MASTER and SLAVE settings.	St

1.3.1	Bob, I did the changes that you suggested, set my cdrom drive to master and DVD burner to slave, and now my computer is recognizing all my drives.	St
1.3.2	Thank you very much.	St
