1.1.2	I need some help and explanation on HDTV tuners for computers .	St
1.1.3	I 've had friends that have had HDTVs and they just use regular over the air antenna 's the picture is nice and clear except for some mild lag sometimes .	St
1.1.4	My tuner right now is old and analog ... it looks like this http : //www.flickr.com/photos/14405843 @ N06/1466646422/ ? addedcomment=1 # comment72157602216062912 when I have bad reception .	St
1.1.5	If I get an HDTV Tuner for my computer will it still look like that or would it be nice and clear ... even when using an ordinary over the air antenna and not satelitte or cable ( cause I 'm not getting that any time soon ) .	St
1.1.6	Also recommendations for a Tuner would be nice and here are my computer specs ... 3.2 GHz Intel P4 HT CPU x800GTO 256MB PCI-E VideoCard Dual monitors one being a 24 & quot ; SyncMaster 245BW and other being the Sync Master 712 ( I 'd only watch probably on my 24 & quot ; ... would this tuner match to the WideScreen aspect that my monitor gives ? )	Ques
1.1.7	1 GB RAM P.S .	St
1.1.8	In the future if I get a 360 or a PS3 would I be able to connect these and be able to play from the tuner or my computer ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks a lot fot the help .	St
1.2.1	the PS3/Xbox360 would look crystal clear on the HDTV tuner , as long as you set the output resolution correctly and set the tuner 's software up correctly ( really is easier to do than it is to type that ) however , over the air always can incur interference , and HD wo n't save you from that , although it might help some to have a higher quality tuner onboard ( it might cut the interference down a little bit , just because the hardware is better quality ) , I 'd go with an HDTV tuner , look at Hauppage first , Leadtek and ATi second , its basically going to be the best type of tuner you can get , because its the current buzz-word product , so you wo n't get anything better than said tuner , although that does n't gurantee flawless signal	St
