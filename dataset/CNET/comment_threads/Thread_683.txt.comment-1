If 1ghz is 1000mhz how come the basic computer I use is five years old and a cpu speed test give s result of 1973.2MHz.
(nearly 2GHz?)
I am looking to buy a new PC, (Intel Core2 Duo Processor E6550) but speeds only appear to be 2.33 GHz.
Thats hardly any faster after all these years.
Am I missing something?
TIA.
