you should be able to see the mac address associated with the ip.
when i see a mac that i don't recognize, i copy and paste into a site like this one .
sometimes it doesn't return a straightforward result, but it might give you a clue to which device it belongs.
i also keep a list of all mac addresses for devices i own for future reference.
