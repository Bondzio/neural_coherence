http://reviews.cnet.com/external-hard-drives/synology-disk-station-ds/4505-3190_7-32987447.html All i really need here is a storage device for my external hardrives, that i can connect to over my home network.
I also need to be able to connect to this device from my xbox 360, as i'd like to stream media to it.
Hopefully someone can suggest a product that would be best for both my needs and my budget.
thank you, sam
