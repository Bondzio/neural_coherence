i recently purchased the epson c120.
the print quality is excellent.
the ink does not smear.
it handles 80 lb cover stock beautifully, but the 100 lb cover stock jams.
i have completed 3 small jobs and my ink is half empty.
although is isn't the perfect printer, i still plan to keep it.
it only cost $79.99.
