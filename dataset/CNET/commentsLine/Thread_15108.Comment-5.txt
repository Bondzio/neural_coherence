great!
thanks for the fast answer....now, i'm looking to install a 500w power supply in my dell 9100 to make the x1950pro video card i already picked up work.... do you know of anything else i'll need to make that power supply or video card work?
will any atx power supply fit in my dell with that adaptor?
will raising the power suppy risk damaging my board or anything else?
thanks!
i've been googling forever.. with no for sure answer... so i thought i would just go ahead and ask!
