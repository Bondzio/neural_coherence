PCPS is a nice tool but it's only a tool.
I just ran it and it says my vid perf is 145% of SIMILAR,,,,What does similar mean??
Keep in mind their running a 2d test, not much value in a gamers world.
If you want to play with this go here.
www.passmark.com Get their perf test, 5.0 I think, and then a big piece of paper and a pencil as you test vid drivers, mobo drivers, bios settings and build a chart.
It's GREAT fun.
