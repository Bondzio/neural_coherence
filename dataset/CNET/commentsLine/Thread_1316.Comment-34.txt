there are so many advantages to having your computer set up as the control centre for your home entertainment system but you must start with the proper equipment.
should you be looking at purchasing a computer then make sure it is designed for entertainment with a built in digital tv tuner, 7:1 surround speaker system, blue ray disc player/recorder, wireless connectivity, remote control and enhanced graphics just to name a few.
most people have a friend that is a computer wizard so take him/her with you and please realize that it may cost a little more right now but the benefits down the road will be incredible.
you are future proofing your system.
if you already have a computer then realize that you can either upgrade or purchase external hookup equipment that will do the job just fine.
when completed you will be able to watch/record television, videos, photography, movies, use your telephone or any form of digital entertainment all on your large lcd/plasma television with complete surround sound.
and yes, when completed properly it can be used throughout your entire home.
there are cost savings when done properly.
you will not require to purchase a seperate dvd player/recorder for you television, eliminate or reduce your phone bill and with the built in digital television tuner and the proper antenna you can eliminate your cable or satelite system with it's monthly bill.
if you find this way above your head then either get a friend to help or make friends with one of the computer geeks.
many a time i have walked into a computer store and asked the staff who their most knowledgeable co-worker is and then asked if i may speak to them.
if you can not put out the total amount for the system all at once then either take advatage of the low or 0% interest rate many retail stores offer or start saving each week by tucking x number of dollars away.
the future is coming quicker than you think so be wise and don't send a boy on a man's errand.
future proof now!
