Why not append to your original post http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=324572&messageID=2948821#2948821 That would give this question a little bit of the necessary background. Things we would like to know: - your OS (Marks link says it's for NT Server only) - what exactly you changed in the registry, and if it works - what the same registry keys contain after the reboot - what mouse and mouse software you use - and why you don't do it via the mouse software or control panel (see http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=325579&messageID=2954164#2954164 ) Not to forget: what do you mean with mouse speed 0. In the normal use of the word, speed 0 = standing still. So may I assume you can't move your mouse pointer at all? I'm locking this thread here.
