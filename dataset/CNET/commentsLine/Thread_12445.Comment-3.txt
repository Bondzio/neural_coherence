thanks for the useful recommendation.
j&r had a three speaker pairs in that range and a bit higher for their cyber monday sale that sounded promising (harmon multimedia jbl duet, altec lansing v52420 and logitech 980-000023 s-220), but i couldn't determine, from the descriptions or from reviews of them from cnet , whether they fulfilled the specs you mentioned.
i'm just not familiar with the terms, as described, so though at least two of those brought enthusiastic reviews, overall, i think i ought to follow your guidance.
getting something that didn't work would be a real pain, and as you say, my needs are simple: hearing what the computer is transmitting, watching a movie, perhaps, or listening to some music but not requiring anything super in the transmission.
(i can always use my stereo if i want to satisfy my urge for high-quality sound.)
i'm not even sure that my computer is up to producing anything worthy of more expensive speakers or those with more pleasing sound.
so, when i get a chance, i shall trot off to radio shack (there's one near me) and get a pair of the speakers.
thanks again, so much.
