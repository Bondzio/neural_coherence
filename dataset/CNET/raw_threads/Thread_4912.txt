I would chose any AGP card from this link -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/12/03/best_graphics_card/ &quot;With the 7600 GS at $100, it's a little too close to the much better performing 2600 XT, so we're dropping that card in favor of the extremely cheap Radeon X1650 PRO. Yes, it's a DDR2 card, but it's only $65, and would make a decent upgrade for an AGP system&quot; The only other item I'd check is the power supply rating. I'd like to see it north of 400 Watts. Bob

I decline to duplicate web content on this subject and will stand on my prior answers. Bob
