WOW!
Sounds great, also take a look at what GIGABYTE and MSI have to offer for MB'S, just for drill.
As far as DDR-2 VS -3, up to you, many of newer boards will support either but is it really worth the extra bucks, again, up to you.
Sounds as if you will have a really good set up.
Have fun and good luck!
