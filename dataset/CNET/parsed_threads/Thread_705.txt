<s> Hi, I want to be able to view and listen to videos (no games)from my pc to my 50 in. </s>
<s> plasma tv via hdmi. </s>
<s> I want to continue to use my current card for my computer monitor and just install an additional card in the pci-e slot. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> The only thing we know of right now is to actually replace your video card with one that supports HDMI out. </s>
<s> Don't know of any PCIEx cards that do this yet. </s>

<s> I have this one http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121259 but Im having a lot of trouble with it, especially the audio. </s>
<s> I want one that will install easily with no more hassles. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> The problem may be with tour card specs... </s>
<s> When choosing a video card you cannot just look at MBs You need it to be 128bit or better for more demanding applications. </s>
