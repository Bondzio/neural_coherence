Peter, I happened to be in a secondhand (recycle) shop last Saturday, and there lay a pile of diskette drives, $ (Euro in fact, but that's no big difference) 1.50 each.
It might be a good investment.
But a new one isn't very expensive either.
However, first open the case (you need to open it anyway if you buy a replacement) and check if the cable is well inserted.
