I use VPN access on the wired computer with a cable connection directly to the company computer and that works fine. I want to run the wired connection thru my router but I do not have administrator priveleges on the company desktop. Without Admin Priveleges, I cannot install the Dlink software on the company machine. As far as setting up a wireless connection via the router and company computer, I guess there is nothing I can do?
