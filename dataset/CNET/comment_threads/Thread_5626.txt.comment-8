It's a common issue, but many don't like that we have to scan and remove the pests with some 5 tools.
Some want a single piece of software to fix it.
Sorry, we don't have that technology yet (unless it's Linux?)
The short list is: Adaware, Spybot, Cwshredder, Housecall and BHODEMON.
BHODEMON appeared a short while ago and I've found it usefull to list the BHOs and to remove the ones I don't want.
Another issue is Internet Explorer.
Doxdesk explains it's danger.
It's such an issue that I advise to use any other non-IE browser when possible.
