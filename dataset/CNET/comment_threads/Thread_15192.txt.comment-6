My husband swears (because of what some guy at Office Depot told him) that we need a card that is 512 MB instead of 256.
He was told that since 256 was the minimum requirement for his game that it would not run as well with a 256 MB card and would be &quot;jerky&quot;.
Any advice on this?
Also, just for my info, what is the difference between a Radeon 1950 and 1650?
?
