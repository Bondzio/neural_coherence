<s> I purchased and installed a WD hard drive a couple weeks ago, and ever since, I've been getting the &quot;SMART Failure Predicted on Primary Slave&quot; message on each startup. </s>
<s> Also, each time I restart, I receive a &quot;Disk Boot Failure, Insert System Disk and Press Enter&quot; message. </s>
<s> From this point I must shut down and reboot. </s>
<s> The drive appears to work, and I'm able to store data on it, but I constantly get the above errors. </s>
<s> I ran Norton's Disk Doctor, but it always froze while it reallocated bad sectors. </s>
<s> I realize something is wrong, but I'm not sure what. </s>
<s> Has anyone experienced this type of problem before? </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> Is it possible that my hard drive is simply bad right out of the package? </s>
<s> Or could there be another problem such as bad connections, software installation problem, etc? </s>
<s> I'm not too familiar with BIOS, etc, so any tips catered to a novice would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> For the record, I'm running a 900mhz P3 with Windows ME. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> &quot;Has anyone experienced this type of problem before? </s>
<s> &quot; Yes. </s>
<s> WD has a drive fitness test (goodbye data on said drive!) </s>
<s> to test if there is an issue. </s>
<s> And they'll replace the drive if it fails (under warranty.) </s>
<s> There were some badly implemented BIOS that would give a false indication, but that is rare in the population of PCs. </s>
<s> You've received your warning, so no one will give much sympathy if the drive now fails and takes with it some files you can't lose. </s>
<s> I'd get the drive fitness test done and check for BIOS updates. </s>
