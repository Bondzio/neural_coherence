here's why.
installing a motherboard and &quot;fixing&quot; xp rarely works.
no one will help you fix this issue.
it's either a total wipeout and proper install of the os or you get lucky and move the card or you dive in and remove devices in the device manager and let windows redetect and you add drivers again.
you would also remove the software and reinstall it.
it's unlikely sony will help you in os issues.
