all possible media types?
there is no detail about your &quot;copy a dvd&quot; as to the source dvd so i can't guess what's wrong.
cnet gives us the steps to copy some dvds at this link -&gt;  but i decline to expound on how that helps.
you have to read the article and see if that sort of copy is usuable.
