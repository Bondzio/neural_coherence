I've read that CD/DVD labels aren't good for discs so I've stopped using them. Sharpie seems to be the way to go, so I do use it for some of my stuff. I can't seem to find much info on inkjet printing onto discs. Will the ink degrade the DVDs? Or is it likely to be made of similar stuff as sharpies and be just as safe?

Read http://www.supermediastore.com/how-to-dvd-cd-labeling-guide.html and you find that you want the ones for CD media. The other labeling methods are covered nicely in the same article. What am I using? 1. Sharpie but writing in the small clear area and 2. Lightscribe.
