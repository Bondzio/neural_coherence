1.3.2	I was told by a computer savvy friend that the HD has sort of crashed or the operating system part of it anyway .	St
1.3.3	So now it wont load up anything .	St
1.3.4	It gets to the windows loading screen , flicks then reboots again but very very slowly the does that same thing .	St
1.3.5	It is a 4 year old HP which up until now no similar problems .	St
1.4.1	If it 'll boot in SM , the problem is probably fixable .	St
1.5.1	Boot with a bootable floppy or cd and try using windows to access the drive .	St
1.5.2	There may be a way to put the IDE drive into your new computer with a connector card .	St
1.5.3	Take a look at CompUSA or Best Buy stores in your area for such devices .	St
1.6.1	I have tried in safe mode but still does the same thing	St
1.7.1	I dont have a bootable disk , is there a website or link where I can get it from on another computer then put this disk in mine & try that .	St

1.8.1	Hp 's have a recovery partition that gives you the option to re-pair or re-install Windows .	St
1.8.2	Generally using the F10 or 12 key allows access .	St
1.8.3	Also some Hp 's have the Recovery Consul installed .	St
1.8.4	On boot watch for boot optioin menu .	St
1.8.5	If it is their select Recovery Consul via arrow keys and press enter .	St
1.8.6	At prompt to select OS # 1 ( not the correct wording , but you will understand when you see the prompt ) , press enter .	St

1.8.8	At the prompt type chkdsk /p /r .	St
