1.1.1	I am having a problem with my desktop computer, I have a problem getting on the internet.	St
1.1.2	Every time I try to get online the page doesn't load, so I opened the Networking part in Device manager and it shows the Intel Ethernet adapter &quot;not functioning&quot;, it says it has a error and then it says (Code 10)....I googled it and I see a lot of people seem to have the same problem as me, some have it with their USB devices and some with their wireless cards.

1.1.3	Now is there a way to fix this, does anyone know, or should I go out and buy a new Ethernet card, or will I get the same problem again.	Ques
1.1.4	I connect my Ethernet cable into the motherboards Ethernet input, I don't have a separate PCI card for it, the internet worked perfectly on this before and I turned off the PC and then a hour later I turned it on again and it stopped working, I have no clue whats going on.	St
1.1.5	Please help!	St
