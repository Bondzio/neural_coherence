i am running win-xp-sp2 os.
i have a lg model gsa-h55n 16x dvd reader/writer.
when i burn some movie files, i get &quot;break-ups&quot; during the last 2-3 minutes when i play it back on my home dvd players (plays ok on my pc).
i have tried nero, imgburn, dvd shrink,magic dvd copier burning software, but still have this problem (not on every file burned).
i use good quality media (memorex,magnavox,hp, etc).
i burn at slow speeds (2.5x).
i just can't figure out what is wrong.
my burner hardware is less than a year old.
i would appreciate your comments and/or suggestions.
