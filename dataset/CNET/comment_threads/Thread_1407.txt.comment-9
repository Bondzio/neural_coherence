&quot;Your machine is indeed running a web server.It's time to take back control of the machine.
Dig in and disable that web server&quot; Not sure what it means that I am running a web server.
The entry appears to be connected with NVIDIA and I am therefore uncetain as to whether or not this is needed for some reason.
In any case - I don't know how to disable it!
&quot;research why you have that DNS entry as well as perform the disable of the indexing service and the XP DMA TRICK&quot;.
Not sure what a DNS entry is nor do I know how to perform the XP DMA trick!
I have stopped the indexing as this was all I was confident about!
