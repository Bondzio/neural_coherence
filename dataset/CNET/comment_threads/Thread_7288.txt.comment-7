I installed the chipset drivers, quickset, and several other drivers, and I'm still having the same problem.
The computer says that no wireless adapter has been installed.
When I install the wireless driver, it begins to detect it, but then the computer crashes.
Is it possible that the wireless adapter was damaged somehow?
