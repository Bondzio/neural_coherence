My Windows laptop still happily connects to the internet via my TimeCapsule. However, the iMac now won't connect. On the iMac, when I select my network from the list of available networks from the Airport icon in the top menu bar, I get a dialogue box that asks for my WPA password (which the Mac used to just remember for me). When I enter it and click OK, it tries to connect for a few seconds and then gives me a &quot;Connection timeout&quot; message. When I open AirPort Utility on the iMac, it says it can't find any wireless devices. I have tried shutting off everything (modem, TimeCapsule, Mac), waiting, and then switching everything back on. What else can I do?

Went into airport settings, and wireless At Radio Channel Selection - changed from auto to manual. Manually changed the radio frequencies to channels 161 and 5. Hit ok, then update and once the TC rebooted, everyone is getting along fine again!
