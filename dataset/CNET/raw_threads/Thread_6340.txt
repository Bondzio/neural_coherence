One of them (which I want to use as my server) is running Vista. The other is running xp. I plugged everything in and to my suprise they were all talking and things were great. After I installed a few things: -Avast free version -Microsoft office -All the windows updates for both computers -And I changed the users on both to one admin with a password and one restricted guest with a password. Now I cannot log onto the vista machine from the xp machine. It sees the computer in the workgroup list but the box just blinks when I type in the user and pass and press ok On the other end, the Vista machine sees the xp, but when I click on the icon it says that windows cannot access..., check the spelling etc. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks
