I own a Dell Dimension 8300.
It had 512MB RAM until I formatted the C drive and now its saying it only has 256MB RAM.
I use a Studio Max and need all the memory I can get.
Can anyone help me?
O ya, I have an 875P Motherboard if thats of any use.
Finally as Im new to this forum I was wondering can you get direct replies to you email address?
