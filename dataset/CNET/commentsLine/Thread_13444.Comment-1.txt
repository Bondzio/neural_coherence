has anyone on the forum bought or used the toshiba thrive?
i have been waiting for a tablet that has usb2, hdmi and a sd slot and it appears the thrive has them all plus a replaceable battery.
before i retired i worked for a toshiba dealer, but that was key telephones and pbx systems and those systems were excellent... that is the reason my laptop is a toshiba, just because of the name.
i plan on going to bestbuy tomorrow as they now have them in stock and i can get a hands on one, but would like to get some thoughts if anyone has used one.
thanks wayne
