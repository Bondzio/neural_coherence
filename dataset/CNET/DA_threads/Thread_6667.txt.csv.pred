1.1.1	Two years ago , I bought this ( obsolete ) card new , solely because I believed that I needed a Decoder to work in conjunction with a USB 5.1 Sound Card .	St
1.1.2	I was not aware that this card was part of a complete sound system , including the DVD drive .	St
1.1.3	My computer is a COMPAQ Presario 6000 series , with which I use an NEC DVD ND-3520 ( in external enclosure ) My question is ; can I make any use of the CT7230 , to my advantage , even only to improve my current graphics ?	Ques
1.1.4	I down-loaded the User Guide for the PC-DVD Encore 6x Dxr3 card from Creative 's excellent web-site , but this refers to a complete installation of the system .	St
1.1.5	Is it worth the effort to install the card in my PC and if so , what leads would I need and what would be the procedure ?	Ques
1.2.1	All models of the DV6000 desktops I see can render DVD content without such a thing .	St
1.2.2	I 'd sell that thing since it 's far too hard on today 's owners and is best for those that want DVD play on a Pentium 2 machine .	St
