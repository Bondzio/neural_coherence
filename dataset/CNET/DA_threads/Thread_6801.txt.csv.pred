1.1.6	When I start the computer I first press ESC to se the Compaq logo and the text below on the screen & quot ; Press F10 for Setup & quot ; I do , then I read somewhere that you should wait untill a cursor flash in the left upper corner and then press F10 .	St
1.1.7	Despite all this there is no access to BIOS , XP starts almost immediate !	St
1.1.8	I need to access the BIOS si I can uppgrade the memory .	St
1.1.9	I appreciate if someone know more about this and could help me ?	Ques
1.1.10	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	It sounds like you are waiting for the cursor before pressing F10 .	St
1.2.2	You should press F10 as soon as you see the Compaq logo and text .	St
1.3.1	Try faster or just the F10 key .	St
1.3.2	But I run into this and make sure I have spare USB and PS2 keyboards to try when a machine does this .	St
