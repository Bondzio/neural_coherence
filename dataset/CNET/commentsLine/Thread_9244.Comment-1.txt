i have windows xp home installed.
my dvd player/burner doesn't want to recognize ant disk i put in which includes dvd+r dvd-r dvd-rw dvd+rw and cds.
i can burn a dvd in the unit using nero but after burning it won't open on this player.it will open on another pc's dvd player.
i can burn cd's on it but can't run the cd.
i can run it on my cd player.i always get the same message.
&quot;please insert a disk into drive h&quot; is there anything i can do?
