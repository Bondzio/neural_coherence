Couldn't find anything regarding forwards compatibility of ram I assumed it would work, but at this point I'm thinking it doesn't and I'm going to have to buy some new ram. It's my first real build although I've been switching out components for years. I definitely did everything correctly on the inside but at POST it makes the same 3 beeps it makes with no ram with the 553. Its an AMI BIOS and according to this http://www.bioscentral.com/beepcodes/amibeep.htm 3 beeps is supposed to be a ram problem.

The components are: MSI G31TM-P21 EVGA GeForce GTX 260 216 Pentium Dual-Core E6700 3.2Ghz G.SKILL 4GB DDR2-800 Creative X-Fi XG Built this pc for my bro, tried to recycle some parts from my old pc that died, but ended up replacing everything but the case and sound card. I was hoping the old ram would work, it was $80 for the new one. I have a better one with an i7, 8gb ram, ATI 5770, and Xonar Essence ST myself. I was too impatient when my old pc died I went for a pre-built from my local Best Buy.
