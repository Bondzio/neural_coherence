USB drivers would be proper (or should be) so let's leave those as-is, whereis.
As to Drive Management, it's the tool that comes with XP to look at and manage drives.
It's one of my first stops when I go looking for a missing drive.
I don't write about it in any detail since if not in Start, Help and Support we have GOOGLE to read up about this tool.
