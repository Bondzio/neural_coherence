It is a 3 GHz Pentium 4 w/HT, 2 gigs of RAM, 160 gig hard drive, 256 megabyte Nvidia GeForce FX 6600 and external Creative Labs Sound Blaster Live! USB sound card. Alltogether, ot works, well, kinda ok. The problem is, it only has a 112 watt power supply. It can switch to 212 watts ( i think thats what the switch said, it is a sliding switch and reveals what power usage is selected when u move the switch), but when I try to start the computer when the switch is on 212 Watts, it doesnt start. It powers on, but doesn't boot. So, since it runs with such low power supply, the graphice card doesnt seem to run very well, causing severe tearing and shearing of the graphics. Very anoying. Does anyone know how I can run my computer on 212 watts instead of the measly 112 watts? Again, it powers on, I hear the fans spin, but it doesnt boot. What can I do? Pls help.

That is the switch to select voltage level when outside the USA power grid. Don't DO THAT if you're part of the USA electrical grid, Canada, OK too, keep at 115V. If you remove the computer side cover and look at your psu, some decal or sticker will explain what your psu is capable of in wattage. tada -----Willy

In games such as Half-Life 2 and Battlefield 2, I start the game just fine, play on a server, and then when the server chanegs levels, the graphice become all torn-up, and some of the textures are missing, like, lets say there is a couch in the game. In some cases, a piece of the couch is totaly gone, and even when I shoot the missing part of the couch, there is a bullet mark on that part of the couch. Sometimes, the texture will be black, and sometimes is it has lines through it and it flashes. in Batlefield 2, there will be parts of the sky, ground, and sometimes a part of the aircraft that has missing, black, or flickering textures, but only after the server chanegs maps, or if I switch to the menu or cntrl+alt+delete. very anoying and im yet to find a fix.

12695	5	172663	1904354	1903904	Willy	4/28/06 8:43 AM	1.14621378E12	Some ideas...	Don't worry, the world needs idiots too. As VPMCMD mentioned, you may need a newer video driver as a cure. I do suggest, you check in the video &quot;properties&quot; and be sure the video card is reported as XYZ123(what your card is), etc. and then the drivers are XYZver. 9999 or whatever, then find the latest and greatest. Also find out what it states is your monitor/LCD is as well. Under Nvida, they usually have tweeking tools, so use them by start at defaults. Last, while 330W is decent, having the biggest psu you can afford, is a plus. A decent generic cheapie psu of 500W+ is good if cost is a concern. But, a namebrand of 400W+ is good too. Remember, wattage must be stable for the longrun, keep that in mind if you get other weird problems down the road, as 330W is &quot;iffy&quot; IMHO. tada -----Willy

It isnt the RAM, as I bought new RAM to see if that would help, but it didnt help. I cant afford a new video card, and Im sure there is a fix seeing as I cant be the only person to have had this trouble.

12695	8	172663	1905990	1905787	lacsr	4/29/06 4:17 AM	1.14628422E12	Nvidia drivers	Here are what I found as the newest for Nvidia cards and yours is listed as approved also. http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_84.21.html I was having a similar problem with a lower qualitty video card than yours but when I loaded this new driver, the problem cleared up. See if this will help

12695	12	172663	1909034	1908259	sgtdisturbed47	5/1/06 12:30 AM	1.1464434E12	I already did that	I reinstalled the video card by first using device manager to remove all drivers and uninstall it, then I removed the video card from the machine, put it back in, and reinstalled the video card. It does not have onboard video, it has to have a video card. I thought I fixed the problem by turning down the video card clock speed, but it happened again. Need more help, as Nvidia wont help and both game manufacturers dont help.
