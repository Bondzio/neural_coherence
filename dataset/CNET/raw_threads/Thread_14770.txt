But there are a few that are sensitive to even the slightest of EM so you must be gentle with them and hope they'll ask their doctors. Frankly, the worry is up to you as there is no X ray radiation source in laptops. Bob

Personally I wish they would add a device to cell phones so that if you used it while operating a motor vehicle you would get a highly aggressive form of brain cancer and be dead within 24 hrs.

While most of us think nothing of it, a few folk believe what they believe. Given what the old CRTs threw out, you'd think the sensitive ones would have died out by now. Bob

Definitely, a healthy individual will not be affected easily and likewise a person with an impaired immunity will be harmed at a minimal exposure.
