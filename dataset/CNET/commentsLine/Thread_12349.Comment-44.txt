range for me is in excess of 300 feet with no concrete obstructions between.
taken outside with no obstructions at all and i hit 400 very well.
it definitely does not like concrete buildings.
my next step is to put a wireless card in the desktop and see what happens when the router is placed next to a window.
it is currently set in the middle of the apartment.
