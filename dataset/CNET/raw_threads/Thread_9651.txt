External Hard Disk *	Hiya Guys I am Dan anyway i have a new hard disk that i got about 3 to 4 weeks ago it is a &quot;imation sohot expert 2.5&quot; 320gb which i got from HK. When i 1st used it, it worked perfectly fine but then my computer had computer problems (ISQL no more or equal) so i had to reformat it so i put all my stuff on to this hard disk for back up (mistake) and i have also pluged it into other computers to add stuff onto it aswell and it worked However after i reformated i pluged my hard disk in and it did not work, so i thought it was just because i didn't have usb 2.0 installed or something but since then my hard disk hasn't worked at all it doesn't work on any computers, there is still a light on my HD so its not dead i just think there is something i need to do.... I have tried going onto Disk management its not there i have looked in BIOS to see if it is connected and i cant find anything It doesnt show on device manager I downloaded programs to detect any extra HD but it doesnt I cannot find any drivers to install for it and i cannot take it back to the shop because i am in england PLEASE HELP i have important documents on there for my uni Thanks for your time guys

This forum is full of folk that forgot to backup. It appears that this lesson is learned but never can be taught. Bob

You may not want to read what backup is but the moment you have &quot;one copy&quot; then you are not in a state of backup. Try 3 copies. As to the drive, data recovery is beyond the DIY methods so now you look to places that do this. Bob
