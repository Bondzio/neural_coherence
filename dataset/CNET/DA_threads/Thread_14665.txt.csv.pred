1.1.1	I've read accounts of various household items (microwaves and 2.4 ghz cordless phones) interfering with wireless networks.	St
1.1.2	Can this be avoided by implementing a 5.8 ghz phone instead?	St
1.2.1	I have my CyberGenie and it's on the 2.4 GHz &quot;band&quot; and shows no sign of interference.	St
1.2.2	This is one of those areas that you can't tell till you have it set up.	St

1.3.1	For this problem you may try to change the channel of your network(router) to Channel 1,9 or 11.this will more likely solves the problem even if they are running the same frequency.	St
1.4.1	2.4 Gigahertz is used by 802.11b/g, phones, microwaves and bluetooth devices.	St
1.4.2	5.4 Gigahertz is used by 802.11a and chordless phones labled as 5.4ghz	St
1.5.1	Does a cordless phone have to be in use to be interferring with the network?	St
1.5.2	If it is simply plugged in without recieving or being used to make a call could it still cause interference with your 802.11g network?	St
1.6.1	If it would interfere I find that often it will show up when the phone rings and the handset is not in the cradle.	St
1.6.2	Be aware that not all cordless units interfere so you have to test for the issue.	St

1.8.1	Hi FYI I bought a fairly expensive 5.8ghz phone (Panasonic KX-TG5423) with two satellite handsets.	St
1.8.2	Have wireless cable modem in house, plenty of bluetooth devices.	St
1.8.3	Despite all that the phone worked great until about two weeks ago when unbrearable static crept in.	St
1.8.4	All the doc says is to move the base away from other electrical devices.	St
1.8.5	That's no fix and still searching for source of problem.	St
1.8.6	Read post on another forum that said that while the base transmits at 5.8ghz the handsets transmit at 2.4ghz.	St
1.8.7	Anyone know if this is true ?	Ques
1.8.8	Off to try swapping channels on cable modem again...	St
