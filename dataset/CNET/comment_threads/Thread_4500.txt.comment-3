...however, it was the high-end previous generation card.
The X1300/X1600 are current generation cards; the X1300 is the low-end card, and the X1600 is the mid-range card.
The high-end current generation cards are the X1800 and X1900.
You'll notice that the card names all have suffixes, such as the ATI Radeon X1900XTX.
I won't get too deep into the suffixes; I'll tell you that XT is better than pro, and GTO is better than GT.
I could also get into the CrossFire dual video card stuff, but I don't feel like it.
