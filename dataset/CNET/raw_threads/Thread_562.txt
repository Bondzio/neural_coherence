My external hard drives decided to work fine after the reformat. However, today, I experienced a CMOS error after a nasty hard reboot and when I loaded Windows again, it was very unstable. Now, my external hard drives aren't detected by Windows, and load forever when I click them, and when I unplug them, a message stating that they need to be formatted pops up. When I try to open them, it says the parameter is incorrect. Also, when trying to view them in Disk Manager, the window freezes up, not changing until I unplug the device. The strange thing is that they work perfectly fine on my XP laptop. System: Windows 7 Professional x64 EVGA 790i Ultra SLI Motherboard 1TB Western Digital MyBook External 500GB Western Digital MyBook External Thanks.

I can't explain why folk invite trouble like that. Again, just sharing what the last ten calls found. It doesn't mean that's what's going on here. What does the machine's maker have to say about the errors? Bob
