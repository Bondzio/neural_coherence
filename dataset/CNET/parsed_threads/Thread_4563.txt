<s> I am having a problem with this burner. </s>
<s> I'm using DVDFab 6 to burn movies, the drive reads the movie just fine but when it gets to the stage of burning the temp file the drive won't recognize the blank media. </s>
<s> It's a Dual Layer and I've tried Ridata and Maxell discs but still no recognition. </s>
<s> Can anyone shed some light on this. </s>
<s> I'm using AMD Athlon 3000, 2.1 GHz, Windows XP. </s>
<s> You tried other new drives? </s>
<s> I think it's the dvdfab6 problem. </s>
<s> Go download IMGBURN here on cnet and give it a try. </s>
<s> I see there are discussions about this if I use google. </s>
<s> http://forum.dvdfab.com/showthread.php?t=4036 notes an easy thing to try and a fine example of how folk want easy friendly answers. </s>

<s> It's not the DVDFab software. </s>
<s> I have a laptop with an external drive that does just great with DVDFab. </s>
<s> There's some other reason the NEC Drive isn't reading the discs. </s>
<s> I went to the NEC website to check for compatibility and they gave two other brands, Fuji and Phillips. </s>
<s> I guess I'll try those and if they don't work either I'll need more feedback on this issue. </s>
<s> it a one way of trouble shooting the problem. </s>
<s> If you don't think it's the software then it must be the hardware (and burner are not that expensive). </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
