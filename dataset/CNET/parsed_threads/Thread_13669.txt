<s> I'm having a strange problem. </s>
<s> The other day we lost TCP printing on our entire network. </s>
<s> Most of our printers use HP Jetdirect cards. </s>
<s> We cannot ping any of them, but we can ping computers just fine. </s>
<s> We have a Windows based workgroup. </s>
<s> All printers have static IPs. </s>
<s> We have a DHCP server, and it looks fine, too. </s>
<s> I'm sorry if this is not enough info, but I am not sure what info would be useful. </s>
<s> Your IT staffer would look over the IP plan, traceroute to the printer and sort it out. </s>
<s> You didn't share details so I can't comment where the failure occured. </s>
