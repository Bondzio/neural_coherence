here's why.
most p4's and specifically the 3.0ghz unit draws 70 to 90 watts just for the cpu alone.
the micro-atx case is not suitable for most p4s since the case can't exhaust that much heat.
-&gt; may i suggest you abandon this upgrade and focus on optimising what you have now.
-&gt; yes there are a few 300 watt micro-atx power supplies, but in light of the case is not designed for this much heat removal, you would be foolish to do this.
