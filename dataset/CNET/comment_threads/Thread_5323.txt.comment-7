Willy, Does the &quot;security&quot; feature come installed on the Lexar Secure model?
I don't remember seeing on Lexar's website a downloadable security application.
I'm wondering IF you need to reformat a Secure drive, won't that wipe out the Security Feature and you have no way to download it to put it back?
