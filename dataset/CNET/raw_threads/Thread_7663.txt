I have had a Dell Inspiron 1300 notebook for almost a year which I primarily use to surf the web and send and receive emails. A few days ago I purchased Quicken Basic 2007 and installed it on the notebook. At the end of the day when I close out my Quicken I'm prompted to back up my data. I haven't backed it up yet but would like to do so. On an old desktop PC I used floppies to back up my Quicken data. This Dell notebook doesn't have a floppy drive but I could buy an external floppy drive to use to back up the Quicken data but are there other ways available to back up the data? Easier; less expensive ways to back up the data? Big Steve Biloxi, Mississippi 01/13/07

Nobody is willing to offer me any advice on how best to go about backing up Quicken data or any data on a notebook? If this isn't the correct forum to post such a question advise which forum is. I guess I should post this one in the &quot;Computer Newbies&quot; forum. Big Steve Biloxi, Mississippi 01/14/07

How did you make out with that? I have XP so needless to say, I have learned the hard way, that simply backing up on a CD like we did in the 'old' days, by selecting A Drive and backing up on a floppy just isn't possible! According to Microsoft, in order for Quicken to write a back up file directly to the CD-R or CD-RW, the compact disc must first be formatted and support 'packet writing'. The Windows XP CD recording program does not support packet writing and does not contain a feature to format a recordable CD. So, I have an external hard drive backing it up but I still long for a way to format the re-writable CD's. I know some people are using a staging area saving method which, again, is just too complicated. Any suggestions? Thanks, Archer.....
