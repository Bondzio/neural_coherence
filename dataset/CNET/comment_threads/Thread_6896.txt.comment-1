Hello, I am doing my very first computer build as i am into 3d design and video editing and all of the ready made ones are far too expensive!
As this is my first time I am having trouble working out which parts are compatible with eachother and I decided to come here for help!
Here is my list of parts MOBO Gigabyte GA-970A-DS3 Socket AM3+ 7.1 Channel Audio ATX Motherboard CPU AMD Bulldozer FX-8 8120 3.1Ghz Socket AM3+ 8MB L3 Cache Retail Boxed Processo CASE NZXT Phantom Black Full Tower Case CD DRIVE Samsung SH-222BB SATA DVD Optical Drive | OEM HARD DRIVE Seagate 500GB Barracuda Hard Drive WIFI TP-Link TL-WN727N Wireless-N150 USB Adapter GPU &lt;div&gt; Sapphire HD 5450 1GB DDR3 HDMI DVI VGA Out PCI-E Low Profile Graphics Card PSU CIT 700W Black Edition PSU 12cm Fan Dual 12v Rail 20+4pin 2x SATA RAM &lt;/div&gt; Corsair 8GB DDR3 1600MHz Vengeance Memory Could someone please tell me if these parts are compatible and if they would be good enough for 3d design.
Also, I was wondering what I would have to do if this computer broke, only the individual parts would have a warranty and i may not know what is broken and what needs to be sent back to ebuyer.
Thanks a lot in advance, Alistair
