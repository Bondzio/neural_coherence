i live in egypt and i intend to make my home the first wireless wi-fi network to be in egypt, my situation is ; 1)we live in buildings made of brick, and i intend to make the connection between me and a couple of my friends in the opposite building which is about 60 meters away.
does the signal will pass through brick !!!!
2) in winter, we have a rainy weather, does it will affect the signal between us!!!
3) my isp uses alcatel modems or router, what is the router that will support working with such modems !!!
i have read on the internet that d-link xtremeg and netgear 108mbps don't function properly with alcatel dsl modems for some new sensors in the ports of both d-link and netgear routers !!!!......
4) my isp will provide me with an adsl connection, not a dsl one, so what is the dsl router that will support this!!!!
see, i have a 4 point situation, and the router i am looking for should meet these points, i guess.... so could you help me please find such router, please ???
a very important point is that the wireless routers is very new thing that isn't sold in the stores in egypt so i have to buy from the us and the same time supporting requirments here for adsl connections, this is my biggest confusion is buying a router from the us fitting the requirments in egypt, but these requirments are summerized in my 4 points, specialy the last 2 points, they are the most important that we can't miss .... by the way, i was thinking of buffalo airstation g-54 and microsoft mn-700, i know there are many differences between them as i read thier detailed reviews, but does anyone of them can meet my 4 points, specially the adsl connection and the alcatel routers support??
?, because these 2 things i can't avoid !!!.....
i hope to hear from you so soon, and many thanks in advance for helping me.....
