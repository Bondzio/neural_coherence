netbooks are intended to be portable companions to desktops and/or full-sized laptops, not as a primary (only) computer.
that's part of the reason they lack the optical drive, it's assumed that the owner of the netbook has another machine with an optical drive.
all you have to do is copy anything from a disc on your regular machine, then transfer it to a flash drive or external hard drive.
plug the drive into the usb port on the netbook and install from there!
