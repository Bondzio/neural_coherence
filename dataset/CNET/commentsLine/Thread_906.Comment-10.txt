a word of caution on the iomega storcenter 1 tb network drive - i've had one of these drives for over a year now formatted in a striped 0+1 configuration and have experienced two instances of data losses due to power issues with the unit and am currently struggling to retrieve my data from it without having to spend some big bucks at a data recovery service.
the first was before placing it on a ups unit, but the 2nd happened when it's $30 external power supply faulted.
seems if you spike the drive controller card it will loose communication with the drives and show them as off line - and there is now way to get them back on line without going through a re-format of the drive (thereby losing all data on it) that i have found or iomega can provide.
their solution would be to replace the drive if it were in warranty?
there is a repair utility on the discovery software utility, but no one at iomega can tell me what will happen if you use this and a couple of their tech's even suggested it may just start a re-format on it's own?
anyone out there ever experienced this or have a solution?
