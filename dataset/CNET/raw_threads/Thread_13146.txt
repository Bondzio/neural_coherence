My Computer labels it as a CD-Rom, I'll have to try and find some software for it and see if that works. Though somebody gave me this site, http://forum.rpc1.org/dl_firmware.php?download_id=319, I don't know what to get from it.

Proffitt	1/15/06 4:10 PM	1.1373414E12	My Computer labels it as a CD-Rom, (is proper)	That's fine and how I see many working drives. &quot;My Computer labels it as a CD-Rom, I'll have to try and find some software for it and see if that works. Though somebody gave me this site,&quot; I don't see how that applies. If you want to play a DVD, you'll need DVD player software such as WinDVD, PowerDVD. Bob
