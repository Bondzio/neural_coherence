there is better out there.
emachines t6520 package for $669.97 after rebates +better cpu with 64 bit capability +more ram +larger harddrive +pci express x16 for upgrades +better ati xpress 200 chipset with 128mb of shared memory for integrated graphics.
+15 in.
lcd monitor however i would reccomend the emachines t6522 for $689.97 after rebates.
+better cpu with 64 bit capability +larger harddrive than the dell and t6420 +more ram than the dell +has a tv tuner unlike the t6520 and your dell 3000 +pci express x16 for upgradability +socket 939 motherboard however if you were willing to spend close to a grand without rebates then you could go dual-core.
these systems are more then your 3000 with the free printer and extended waranty.
however, you get so much more for only a $100 difference.
better deal.
