<s> My external hard drive is not recognized by my computer. </s>
<s> Currently running Windows 7. </s>
<s> Message said couldn't find the drivers, does anyone have an idea where I can find the drivers or how to fix the problem. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for your assistance. </s>
<s> See if it works on other machines. </s>
<s> I can tell you that most external hard drives that are USB will be recognized by Windows 7. </s>
<s> I have an old SimpleTech external harddrive (100 Gig - Yes that old, it was huge when I bought it) and it is still recognized by my Gateway windows 7 computer bought about a year and half ago to replace the PC my wife was using. </s>
<s> You can try the SimpleTech site but most USB hardware either holds its own basic drivers in a bit of flash memory the system treats like a usb stick or windows has them itself. </s>
