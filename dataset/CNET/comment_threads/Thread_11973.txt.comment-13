In an ideal world Fast writes support is a great thing to have Ticked it allows the CPU to send data to the Graphics card without having to go through RAM, making it a far more optimal approach.
That said in reality most benchmarks done on this have shown it to be of little actual benefit, in some cases performing slower, not mention on other systems it causes stability problems.
As a result you might want to run a few benchmarks before choosing whether or not to leave this enabled or not.
When Grayed out Fast-writes support will be automatically determined, though should you wish to force it be sure to Tick this option & be sure you have set 4X AGP & enabled Fast Writes in your BIOS.
NOTE On some systems this can cause stability problems.
the fast writes and vsync suggestions came from other forums.
