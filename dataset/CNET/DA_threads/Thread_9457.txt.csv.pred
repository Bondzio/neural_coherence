1.1.1	I 'm a teacher and need to be able to use a keyboard while presenting information on the projector .	St
1.1.2	Sitting at a desk is stupid and impractical for me ( I 've got middle schoolers , folks !	St
1.1.3	) , and I was wondering what the effective range for wireless keyboards are .	St
1.1.4	More than likely I would go for a USB , but if a Bluetooth has better range ( which common sense is telling it would ) , I could go that route .	St
1.1.5	Thank you for any and all input !	St
1.1.6	Regards , Darren Aho	St
1.2.1	I need a minimum of 30 feet of range , but the more the better !	St
1.3.1	30ft is about the maximum range usually stated by RF wireless keyboards ( my own Logitech can easily beat 20ft , and through walls ! ) .	St
1.3.2	Mice RF range is far less ( mine begins to get lost in the maze at about 8ft ) though .	St
1.3.3	The main problem here is that Bluetooth range is n't any better with an effective range of ... .wait for it ... 32ft Which maybe means a careful and extended central position for the receiver would be required for either ( oh , the logicalness of it all !	St
1.3.4	; ) so you could walk around it , without going near either of the effective limits .	St
1.3.5	GeeBee .	St
1.4.1	That 's good news !	St
1.4.2	Thank you	St
