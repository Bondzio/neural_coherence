<s> [README] by exobrute - 3/23/09 5:53 PM Alright now i am soooo frusterated right now. </s>
<s> I dont what to get. </s>
<s> I am getting a new computer for my 16th birthday for sure but idk which one. </s>
<s> My parents are willing to spend about $1200, not much more. </s>
<s> At first i was going to get a refurb aluminum unibody macbook pro 2.4ghz for $1600 but i would have to spend $400 of my own money, i was very set on this until my friend said i should build my own custom pc. </s>
<s> I really really love the look of the macbook pro which is why i was gonna buy it. </s>
<s> I also really love portability. </s>
<s> But the macbook pro isnt very powerful and for $1200 i can get a custom built pc from ibuypower.com. </s>
<s> This is its specs which i would buy: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Case- Nzxt Tempest Gaming Tower Case Case Lighting- Cold Cathode Neon Light Blue Power Supply- 800 Watt -- Power Supply quad SLI Ready Processor- Intel Core i7 Processor 920 4x 2.66GHz/8MB L3 Cache Processor Cooling- iBUYPOWER Napoleon CPU Cooling Fan System Kit Motherboard- Asus P6T Intel X58 Chipset CrossFire and SLI Supported w/7.1 Sound, Triple-Channel DDR3, Gb LAN, S-ATA Raid, USB 2.0, 3-Way SLI PCI-E MB 3-Way SLI ) Memory- 3 GB [1 GB X3] DDR3-1333 Triple Memory Module Corsair Value Video Card- NVIDIA GeForce GTS 250 1GB w/DVI + TV Out Video Hard Drive- 320 GB HARD DRIVE Serial-ATA-II, 3Gb, 7200 RPM, 16M Cache CD-RW/DVD-RW Drive- LG 20X Dual Format/Double Layer DVDR/RW + CD-R/RW Drive Black ) Sound Card- 3D Premium Surround Sound Onboard Network Card- Onboard LAN Network Gb or 10/100 Flash Media- Reader/Writer 12-In-1 Internal Flash Media Card Reader/Writer Black Operating System- Microsoft Windows Vista Home Basic 64bit Warranty Warranty- Service Standard 3-Year Limited Warranty + Lifetime Technical Support ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Now the specs of the macbook pro are like a 2.4ghz core 2 duo, nvidia 9600GT and 2gb ram. </s>
<s> Now i know the pc specs blow away the macbook pro. </s>
<s> But like i said i love the portability of laptops, now ive had a desktop for ever but occasionally use my dads crap laptop. </s>
<s> So i dont know how much id use it portable but im sure i wuld. </s>
<s> Also the macbook pro is amazing looking. </s>
<s> So which do you think i should get? </s>
<s> Please leave all your thoughts, Thanks </s>
<s> Hi I bought I gaming laptop (2.6GHz Dual core AMD with Nvidia 7900GTX GO -17.1&quot;) graphics and was happy for a short space of time...the reason, when I wanted more performance after a year, there was nothing I could do except to get faster ram, bigger hard drive and re-install Windows. </s>
<s> It cost me 1600 and I regret it up to this day. </s>
<s> Recently I spend 1450 on building my own core i7 PC (my first build) and it was really easy - I have a large 24&quot; monitor, 920 i7 processor, 4870 1GB ATi card, 1TB HDD, 12GB DDR3 ram, Asus P6T Deluxe motherboard, coolermaster M850, Thermaltake Armour case, Creative Titanium X-Fi sound card, Compro Dual DVB-T tv card and Windows Vista 64 bit. </s>
<s> The processor can be overclocked with ease whenever I want to (Although, it's not currently necessary to do so as it is able to run everything well) and I have no problems - when I need more power, I can always upgrade components one at a time at a later stage. </s>
<s> At the end of the day, it depends on your needs - do you want a computer that you can take everywhere, or do you want something with performance that can serve you for many, many years with upgrades? </s>
<s> Since, you are 16, you probably need a computer that you can carry around to do all of your academic studies and some light gaming (not sure about MACs for gaming -never used one before), but this is the rationale that you should use when trying to make a decision - good luck with the choice and remember, whatever you get will only be regarded as the 'best choice' if it is able to serve all of your needs/requirements - hope this helps. </s>
<s> Thanks for the response! </s>
<s> If i may ask where did you purchase your core i7 machine or did you build it yourself? </s>
<s> Also what would be a good Windows laptop thats as good as the macbook pro but cheaper? </s>
<s> Hi - I purchased all the components for my build from 3 retailers in the UK (scan.co.uk / overclockers.co.uk/ tekheads.co.uk) and yes I built the system myself - it was really very easy and there's a wealth of knowledge on the internet should you have problems - and it's cheaper than buying a pre-built system. </s>
<s> A good Windows laptop will be something like Alienware's Area 51-m15x - it's great for portability and has plenty of oomph to play some decent games - If you don't want to buy from Alienware, try MSI or Novatech etc. </s>
<s> - you should find something similar. </s>
<s> You can get a better card: NVIDIA GTX 260- $170 @ newegg EVGA GTX 260 Superclocked- $175 @ newegg + a better RAM config: Patriot Viper 6GB (2x3) DDR 3 1600- $85 w/ mail in rebate @ Newegg save some $$$? </s>
<s> maybe a intel i7 920 2.66 Ghz @ buy.com if u want help just ask </s>
