1.1.1	I would like to know if this device (wireless N bridge) will help to access my games and blue ray player that are sometimes out of range from my wireless router?	St
1.1.2	These devices are part of my home entertainment center that is in the basement rec room ; away from my router in the upstairs office.	St
1.2.1	All the blue ray content is DRM (see google) and is locked up tightly so let's just say no.	St
1.2.2	As to the game, you didn't tell enough.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thankyou for replying Bob!	St
1.3.2	I have a wireless router (D-Link Dir615) for my network and everything is connecting OK most of the time, but my Wii and Sony blu ray need to connect for firmware updates.	St
1.3.3	I have the ability to go online with the Wii but also need a method of hooking up the blu ray.	St
1.3.4	It would complete my system if there was better range to work between floors in my home!	St
1.3.5	-Both have web accessability.	St
1.3.6	Wii has USB but I believe Sony uses RJ45.	St
1.3.7	My connection isn't always present.	Polite

1.4.1	I read your first post and it reads as if you want to access your blu ray from other places, same about the games.	St
1.4.2	This is a no go area or rather all the copy protections and more mean we can't use our blu ray and games from other places in the house with any reliable, published, you and I can set it up with stuff I bought at the usual store solution.	St
1.4.3	Your reply however seems to have the usual question about how to get the internet to these devices.	St
1.4.4	That's been done many many times.	St
1.4.5	-&gt; Since wifi seems to fail you and we know N promises more but doesn't always deliver why not the usual power line HD bridge?	St
1.4.6	EXAMPLE at http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-PowerLine-Ethernet-Starter-DHP-301/dp/B000RPXI02 Bob	St
1.5.1	Hello again!	St
1.5.2	I did some online research and have decided to purchase a bridge to create a wireless access point for my ent.	St
1.5.3	ctr.	St
1.5.4	My D-Link router will comunicate with the D-Link DAP 1522 bridge (extending the range)and I will hook up all my hardware w/CAT5 computer wiring.	St
1.5.5	This will enable my devices to go on line.	St
1.5.6	Sorry for the misunderstanding; and thanks again for your help... Tom	Polite
1.6.1	I have the Netgear wps606 which I was so happy with I bought a second one.	St
1.6.2	This type of device is really great.	St
1.6.3	I paid 25 for it refurb and know why.	St
1.6.4	The setup instructions would cause most to return it but you can imagine I worked with it and it was just the thing for my kid's 360 and PC bridge.	St
1.6.5	The xbox 360 wifi runs 99 bucks.	St
1.6.6	For much less I got the PC and 360 on the air.	St
