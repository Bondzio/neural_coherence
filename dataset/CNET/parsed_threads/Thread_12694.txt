<s> I have PC with configuration of Pantium D processor and 512 MB RAM.It was working fine until i replace 512 RAM with 1 GB RAM. </s>
<s> Now mkv video or any high quality video is not playing continuously and CPU used is more than 90%. </s>
<s> Even if i switched back to 512 MB RAM , Problem is there. </s>
<s> Could anybody suggest anything please? </s>
<s> Go into taskmanager and tell us the top-5-processes after sorting on CPU usage. </s>
<s> Also tell about your graphic card. </s>

<s> That makes me wonder if there is TORRENT software or other VIDEO PLAYERS that came from a TORRENT on this machine. </s>
<s> I'm losing count how often a machine gets slammed when the owners begin to use torrents. </s>

<s> System Idle Process explorer.exe firefox.exe utorrent.exe system Graphics Memory is 96 MB. </s>
<s> about torrents. </s>
<s> And it's a pity you didn't tell the percentage of each process. </s>
<s> Normally, system idle (the system doing nothing) should be above 80% if all you do is looking video, I think. </s>
<s> The video program shouldn't need more than 20%. </s>
<s> But I don't see any video viewing program in the list. </s>
<s> Remarkable: with system idle on top of the list it's nearly impossible that the CPU is being used for more than 90% by other processes. </s>
<s> That leaves less than 10% for system idle, and it's hardly imaginable it's on the top of the list than. </s>
<s> Maybe tell more? </s>
<s> What I should do: - switch the hard disk you're reading the video-file from from DMA to PIO mode, reboot, switch it back again to DMA-mode and reboot again. </s>
<s> That's done in Device Manager. </s>
<s> If that doesn't help: - clean install of the OS - try again to view a video you already have on your harddisk (copy it to USB-stick first, because the clean install will format the hard disk); disconnect from Internet until then - stay away from torrents in the future Kees </s>
