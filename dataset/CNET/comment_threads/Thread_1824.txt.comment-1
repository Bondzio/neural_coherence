I have an Nvidia Geforce 6200 with TurboCache graphic card.
The TurboCache feature shares some memory from the RAM memory to increase the Video card memory.
I have just upgraded my PC RAM from 256 MB to 1GB.
Now i want to adjust the Nvidia GPU 's TurboCahce to share more memory from my new RAM.
Can i adjust the TurboCache settings and how.
Or does it get Automatically resized according the RAM upgradation ?
