I contacted NEC and was told that the DVD Codec I needed was available from (intervideo) WinDVD or other such sources. I installedd the 30 day trial version and the player worked as it should. I immediately purchased the full version once I was confidant that my issue was resolved. You can go to Intervideo's site and download the trial version to see if that helps. http://www.intervideo.com/jsp/Home.jsp

Any suggestions on software besides Nero, i have tried that and it didnt work, i spent 4 hours as it was doing something, then when it was finished doing what ever it was doing, it ejected my BLANK DVD and asked for a blank DVD.

But there is no story here so I can't offer any other suggestion than CDBURNERXP. I can't tell if this will do what you want since you didn't tell much. Bob
