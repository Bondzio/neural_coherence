an external drive is a nice way to move large amounts of data between pc's that aren't networked.
and it's useful as a quick (but preferably not your only) backup medium.
it's never a good idea to store information on only one place, be it an internal or an external disk.
if you read through two pages of this forum, moreover, you'll note that quite a few posts are about &quot;i can't access my external disk anymore&quot;, while hardly any is about &quot;my internal hard disk failed&quot;.
so it can be considered a proven fact of life that external disks are more unreliable than internal disks.
your data, music, documents, text files, photos etc indeed are kept safe from computer problems.
alas, they are not kept safe from problems with the drive itself.
and such problems for an external disk are more common than computer problems that damage data on the internal disk.
and that's where your idea (and that of most people you know) fails.
having a backup (preferably: 2 backups, on different media at different places) is the preferred way to keep your data safe.
sorry, but that's the way it is.
