there's nothing wrong with building a computer in this manner; as for compatibility, amd makes this choice easy, as all am2+ and am3 motherboards will fit a very wide variety of processors.
intel on the other hand limits the processors you choose to the socket you decide to go with.
for example; if you choose an lga 775 motherboard you're limited to (at most) a core 2 extreme, if you choose the (newer) lga 1156 motherboard you're limited to only p55 processors, and, if you choose to go with an lga 1366 motherboard then you're limited to only running with an x58 processor.
when choosing a motherboard (if you're planning on any decent gaming or photo editing); choose a board without integrated graphics, and then purchase a good video card later ( i read somewhere that it is better to have one excellent video card, than going sli or crossfire with two or more lower-end video cards).
-a cnet forum discussion on integrated vs. dedicated graphics  spend a few extra $$ (doesn't have to break the bank) for an after-market cpu cooler, usually the stock coolers don't hold up very well under heavy loads (such as gaming).
when buying a new case to hold all your new components; this is pretty much up to you, but bear in mind that you don't want your 1st build to be a nightmare (because it's too tight a fit to get everything inside, and/ or that it just doesn't cool all your components well enough).
we all started out at the same level that you are now; i wish i had known about such forums (as the ones here), when i built my 1st (gaming) computer.
we're here to help as needed
