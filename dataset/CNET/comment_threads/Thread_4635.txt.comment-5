Well, Newegg does *not* sell any 533MHz FSB w/ 512kb cache..
I'm looking through some combo deals, none too appealing.
The deals are okay, look at Newegg, then on the left click &quot;Newegg Specials&quot; Look here, maybe, try to chat with someone at Monarch, maybe they could help... http://www.monarchcomputer.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=M&Category_Code=INTELC ~Ibrahim~
