My sound card is a Creative Audigy live. My graphics card is an ATI All In Wonder 7500. I have downloaded all the latest drivers and updates for all my hardware and the operating system Here is my problem and it is driving me crazy!!! When I play the TV on the computer the video and sound are out of sink (the sound and video play at different times like a poorly dubbed karate movie). The graphics card uses the sound cards input to play sound through a cable connecting both cards. Another weird thing is that my system keeps muting the input volume by itself as though resetting itself. I hope it is just a configuration issue but I am clueless.
