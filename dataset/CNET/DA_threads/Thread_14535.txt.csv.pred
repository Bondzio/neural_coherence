1.1.1	Three weeks ago I purchased a 19 inch widescreen monitor model # S199WFP from Dell .	St
1.1.2	Starting last week from time to time a thin purplish vertical line appears in the left quarter of the screen at various times and then disappears , sometimes for a few hours at a time but it always returns .	St
1.1.3	Tech support at Dell has been very poor , they requiring I keep a journal for a week to note every time the problem occurs and what I 'm doing at the time , despite the fact it came with a three year warranty and I 'm to call them at the end of that week if the problem continues .	St
1.1.4	My question is could it possibly be the video card causing the problem and not the monitor ?	Ques
1.1.5	My system is a Dell Inspiron 530s which I bought five weeks ago .	St
1.1.6	Or could it be something else I 'm doing ?	Ques
1.1.7	I would rather not have to deal with the rude tech support from Dell of India .	St
1.1.8	Anyone else have issues with Dell Tech Support or is this just an isolated case ?	Ques
1.1.9	Any help appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	It 's their problem and not yours .	St
1.2.2	Whatever you do or try , be careful not to do such that Dell might consider it as voiding your warranty .	St
1.2.3	About all you can get away with is to swap the monitor onto another PC or try another monitor on yours so see what happens .	St
1.2.4	I ca n't think of a connection issue that would cause this .	St
1.2.5	Do make sure you 're using the native resolution of the monitor and defaults for the video card as far as refresh rates .	Sug
1.3.1	The & quot ; 3yr .	St
1.3.2	warranty & quot ; is just another product they sell .	St
1.3.3	You have a problem , they should address it and since monitor is relatively new , go for the replacement .	St
1.3.4	Understand , you may not get a brand new monitor ( you could ) but one certified for use as & quot ; refurb/rebuild/tested & quot ; but will be fine for use .	St
1.3.5	Anyways , also you may want to get a & quot ; monitor test pgm & quot ; or similar o disaply test patterns to get tests done .	St
1.3.6	Your video driver pgm .	St
1.3.7	if ATI or nVidea should also do some testing .	St
1.3.8	The DX9 or DX10 can have similar test , type at run [ dxdiag ] no brackets , press enter check into all that , what are your results , act accordingly .	St

1.4.1	geofos , In your other comment ( http : //www.news.com/5208-10784_3-0.html ? forumID=1 & threadID=36256 & messageID=391105 & start=0 ) I offered to help you get the monitor replaced .	St
1.4.2	I just found this thread and wanted to reply here as well to make sure you saw .	St
1.4.3	From what you describe it sounds to me like the problem is with the monitor itself .	St
1.4.4	Steven Haninger 's suggestion to try the monitor on another computer and/or another monitor on your computer would help confirm whether the problem was the monitor or not ( if the problem follows the monitor then the monitor is the problem ) .	Sug
1.4.5	If you still need help getting it replaced please contact me ( customer_advocate @ dell.com ) and I 'll be happy to help you .	St

1.5.1	Larry the Dell Customer Advocate who responded to my post took care of the problem quickly ; I received the replacement monitor today .	St
1.5.2	It does n't show well for Dell that to get help I had to start a thread on CNET , but Larry exemplified great customer service .	St
1.5.3	Thanks Larry	St
1.6.1	I 'm glad I could help get things with your monitor properly taken care of .	St
1.6.2	I agree that things could ( and should ) have been taken care of better before this , however , I have passed on feedback about what happened so we can take steps to try and improve things .	St
