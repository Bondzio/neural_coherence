i just don't know what to say...chrome plated??
i gotta see this!!
where'd you find a chrome plated mouse??
or did you buy a generic and send it out to your local machine shop for chroming.. i could have to real fun with this but... maybe you could transfer the chrome??
is the shiny side up or down?
i mean..what can i say??
this proves a point (i never made)..even chrome plated mice are subject to failure and must climb the chrome stairway to heaven.
and life goes on...(except for chrome plated mice) jack
