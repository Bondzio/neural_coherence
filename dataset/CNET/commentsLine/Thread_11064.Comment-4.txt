since nat is a natural firewall, all inbound connections get dropped without any work from me.
so to stop all the twiddling i turn off the new router firewall feature to send it back to about early 2011 when i see they started to turn this on and create more support issues.
not one seems to be very configurable so it's just another item to disable.
