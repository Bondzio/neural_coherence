<s> I have a Windows Me system with plenty of RAM & harddrive space. </s>
<s> I just recently had a SONY CD-ROM drive installed because mine crashed. </s>
<s> I'm using software called &quot;Ashampoo Recording Suite 4&quot;. </s>
<s> The program will let me burn a new CD but will not let me burn an existing CD. </s>
<s> It wants me to select a CD writer form the drop-down list but there are none in the menu to select! </s>
<s> What can I do to fix this? </s>
<s> &quot;existing CD&quot; do you mean a CD/RW or a CD that was created before you installed the Sony? </s>
<s> If it was a CD/RW, how you &quot;closed&quot; it would have a lot to do with your ability to &quot;append&quot; data to it. </s>
<s> If all you want to do is reuse it, then you will have to re-initialize and/or re-format it. </s>
<s> Your software's help file will show you how. </s>
<s> If you're talking about a CD with data already on it then you won't be able to write to it. </s>
<s> It's a one-time deal. </s>
<s> If it's something other then please provide a detailed description of the problem and what you have already tried. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
