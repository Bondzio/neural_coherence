1.1.1	Hi all .	St
1.1.2	i have an issue with a GX620 , Pent D 3GHz small form factor , WXP machine .	St
1.1.3	It stopped booting into windows .	St
1.1.4	I can get to the setup and exit when accessing all options except the SATA information where it hangs ( SATA HD connected ) .	St
1.1.5	Pulled the cmos battery and on restart bios says & quot ; previous fan failure..and..low cmos battery & quot ; but nothing in setup-maintenance-event log .	St
1.1.6	I do n't know of any fan issue .	St
1.1.7	The power supply fan and system fans both spin .	St
1.1.8	I swapped the memory , pulled the dvd rom and floppy drives .	St
1.1.9	Moved the usb mouse and keyboard to other ports with no success .	St
1.1.10	When I try to boot from Dell utilities dvd , w98 boot diskette , or winpe I only get so far ( eg .	St
1.1.11	w98 boot disk_stops at writing virutal disk c : ... .winpe and W7 install cd stops at writing drive F : 'extcd001 ' unit 0 ... ... .at this point the numbers on the front indicate 1 3,4 which seems like it could indicate a memory issue .	St
1.1.12	I have swapped modules , kept only one at a time in , etc but i never get any new result .	St
1.1.13	I 'd like to know if there is some diskette bootable memory socket and module test or if anyone has any ideas how to move forward .	St
1.1.14	tnx in advance !	St
1.2.1	XP knows nothing about SATA .	St
1.2.2	7 may not be supported ( we have a few at the office that can only run XP/Vista . )	St
1.2.3	Look in the BIOS options for SATA AHCI , IDE emulation and try changing that .	St
1.2.4	As I have no link to the BIOS manual from you I 'll stop here with the areas I change .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Tnx..new info : when i try to boot into anything , the pc hangs .	St
1.3.2	i 'm not sure what it tries to do and fail but i suspect it needs to write to RAM and ca n't .	St
1.3.3	When booting from a Ubuntu CD , the GUI shows for a bit then it tries to fully boot into the system and it then goes to a flashing cursor and black screen hang .	St
1.3.4	W98 boot diskette , wxp install cd , dell utility cd ... .the bootup process either hangs or when I select a boot option the system reverts right back into POST like in a loop .	St
1.3.5	I 've swapped mem modules ... not sure what this could be .	St
1.4.1	All that proves is the machine needs repairs .	St
1.4.2	It could be as simple as setting bios to defaults to as much as cleaning the machine and replacing all heat sink compounds and dead fans .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	tnx for the suggestion .	St
1.5.2	actually a person on a dell forum mentioned ; The Dell Optiplex 745s , 270s , 280s and others from that same time period have this problem .	St
1.5.3	www.ccl-la.com/ ... /dell-optiplex-gx620-motherboard-repair So I 'm going to assume that is the problem as i have had similar issues with a past dell model and capacitors .	St
1.5.4	These are a bit bulged .	St
1.6.1	When it comes to inspection criteria for those BAD CAPS , only PERFECTION passes the test .	St
1.6.2	Google BAD CAPS for what happened as well as finding out about millions of dead PCs and now HDTVs .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
