man, people don't cut much slack for an honest mistake, do they?
i use mostly seagate.
i think between my two computers, i've got three seagates and two western digitals ranging in size from 40 gb to 250 gb.
i've had trouble only with one of the wd's, but that only after 5+ years.
so i guess i'm a fan of seagate and western digital.
