<s> My C: drive has 74Gb NTFS but has only 15 GB left, but my D: drive has 55GB free out of 65GB. </s>
<s> What do I need to do to utilise all my disk space and still access my files as if they were on C:? </s>
<s> Vista 32 bit laptop. </s>
<s> You can't access files on d: exactly as file on c:, because the drive-letter is different. </s>
<s> So you would have to go to another drive. </s>
<s> It's transparent if you move a folder like My Documents (via its right click properties) that you don't access via a drive-letter. </s>
<s> But for all other files - after moving the folder - you'll notice the drive they are on is different. </s>
<s> But that's only a minor difference. </s>
<s> Don't move files from - the root folder - program files - windows - other folders than My Documents in your profile Kees Kees </s>
<s> Two methods: swap files over/transfer -OR- buy a larger HD. </s>
<s> Save your data to any media(CD/DVD) of installed pgms. </s>
<s> besides the OS and its default pgms. </s>
<s> Once done and proper, de-install pgms., reboot and then re-install in drive &quot;D&quot;. </s>
<s> You can then swap data to the new location, etc.. Once done, you've free-up space. </s>
<s> However, just buying a new HD that say 250GB, to replace your drive &quot;C&quot;. </s>
<s> Then use its own manufacturer's provided s/w can transfer the whole old to new HD, then remove old HD entirely. </s>
<s> You gain more space and the system is more capable. </s>
<s> In fact, get a real large HD and replace both old drives, as a 250gb and larger is very common now, easily outstrips a 80 or 70gb old drive. </s>
<s> Buying a new HD is pretty simple with manufacturer's s/w involved and using the instructions. </s>
<s> Review them at support websites to see what's involved. </s>

<s> Thanks guys. </s>
<s> I've moved my documents, but no progs or windows stuff to D: and it appears ok, but I accept the point about getting a bigger disk. </s>
<s> PC Magazine had released an utility called &quot;COA32 (Change of Address/32)&quot; by Neil J. Rubenking. </s>
<s> It does what needs to be done to move the location of installed files in Win XP. </s>
<s> Have been using it for years without any problem. </s>
