<s> I'm shopping for an online backup service for my Mac. </s>
<s> I'm currently trying Carbonite but I'm reading good things about Crashplan also. </s>
<s> Any recommendations? </s>
<s> I'll be backing up around 50 GB of data and once the initial upload is done, the incremental backups will be pretty small. </s>
<s> I have cable internet with pretty good upload speeds. </s>

<s> I ditched Carbonite for CrashPlan last night and so far it's a big improvement. </s>
<s> In 14 hours CrashPlan has already uploaded more data than Carbonite did in twice the time. </s>
<s> I'll keep researching though, especially in terms of the security of my data. </s>
