1.1.1	I have two USB ports on the front of a PC that I use for backups .	St
1.1.2	For no apparent reason they stopped working today .	St
1.1.3	I plugged my printer into the ports to verify if they work and they did work with the printer .	St
1.1.4	When I try to do a backup I get a message saying the port/drive does not exist .	St
1.1.5	I went into the device manager and those two USB ports do n't show there either .	St
1.1.6	HELP ... does anyone have any thoughts on what to do next ?	Ques
1.2.1	About all you can do is check to make sure the connections are good .	St
1.2.2	You have have wiring from the front ports to the MB header .	St
1.2.3	Remove the connectors and plug them back in .	St
1.2.4	Make sure the pins in the connectors are fully seated as well .	St
1.2.5	Pulled pins are notorious for causing connection failures .	St
1.2.6	I have had USB ports go bad and I suspect due to static discharge .	St
1.2.7	When this happened to me , however , the ports did n't disappear but showed as having a problem .	St
1.2.8	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	Yes all of the rear ports are working , except when I plug in an external drive of any sort .	St
1.3.2	I know the connection is good on the front ports as the printer works in them .	St
1.4.1	I 'd look to System Restore to a day ago .	St
1.5.1	Will this delete any new data added since one day ago ?	Ques
1.6.1	We only lose what we do n't backup .	St
1.6.2	System Restore is detailed in this next link .	St
1.6.3	http : //windows.microsoft.com/is-is/windows-vista/what-is-system-restore Can I ask why folk do n't backup ?	Ques
1.6.4	I mean , any nasty could arrive and blam .	St
1.6.5	Where 's the backup ?	Ques
1.6.6	Bob	St
1.7.1	Did a system restore and USB still wo n't read any mass storage device .	St
1.8.1	I backup everyday .	St
1.9.1	Often enough most frt .	St
1.9.2	USB ports are connected by a cable harness inside the PC to the header on the mtrbd .	St
1.9.3	With power-OFF , locate and reseat several times the connection and retry for use .	St
1.9.4	If it still fails , then it very well could have blown the USB chip that 's the hub typically runs 2 USB ports .	St
1.9.5	Unless this is a generic type of port placement , then you have to install a satellite hub using a rear USB port which can add 2-8 new ports , google for such .	St
1.9.6	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
1.10.1	And if there is a hardware issue , I test for that by booting up a Live CD ( Ubuntu or other ) .	St
1.10.2	No install needed and I can test the hardware .	St
1.10.3	Bob	St
