Heya people i was just wondering how much better is this router than the other routers supplied by netgear?
I am going to get a wireless router but i just want to know is this wireless connection stable and fast enough for gaming, i will only have a 2MB connection (or 1MB if someone else using it too) and the router will be downstairs going upstairs through 2-3 walls and it would be about 10m max range from router to laptop.
Will be using a dell xps m170 fuly specced with the normal wireless card inside it.
Can you get the specialised wireless card for the netgear max put into an XPS?
Let me know guys!
cheers.
Jonno ^_^
