I've got a 6yr old Presario,Windows 98.
Over the years I've installed 'TurboTax' software programs for taxes.
Ever year the newer program I install pulls information from the previous years program.
Its now time for me to get a new computer and I want to install last years tax program onto the newer computer when I get it.
I've seen these portable storage drive things that are about the size of a lighter advertised at 'Staples'.....reasonably priced @ $30 area.
I assume it plugs into my USB port.
Does anyone have experiance with these or know if these things would hold my whole tax program?
I'm open to other solutions.
thanks.
