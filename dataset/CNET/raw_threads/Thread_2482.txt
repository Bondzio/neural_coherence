7257	0	115323	1310126	NR	Alan Copeland	7/20/05 1:44 PM	1.12186704E12	System Restore partition	I have a new HP Pavilion which has a system restore partition. I have already made my recovery Tools CD and System Restore DVDs. Is there any reason to keep the partition? And, conversely, is there any reason not to?

It's a repair tool which you may need at some future time. Although you could reinstall it from the recovery cd's, you would have to format the drive and reinstall everything. Best to live with it in it's present form.
