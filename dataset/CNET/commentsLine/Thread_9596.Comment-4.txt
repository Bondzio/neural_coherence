then remove the cmos battery for 10min.
and then replace it and go from there.
again, while you're doing that, install new battery.
if the problem persists, use the &quot;clearing cmos pins&quot; to go to basics.
if you boot-up then even with an error, do so.
then reboot, enter the bios and correct for proper setting.
checksum is a sign something has changed and doesn't match what was saved in the last correct bios post.
if you're using a usb kybd.
take it out, repeat the above steps with a plain ps/2 kybd.. if that corrects it, then return usb kybd.
usage as last step.
