11674	0	275269	2650999	NR	FlubFlav31	12/10/07 2:29 PM	1.19729694E12	Can you connect a computer to the Panasonic TH-50PX77U?	This TV does not have a computer input (inputs it does have listed below), so is it at all possible to connect a computer to this plasma TV? I'm looking to buy a new desktop, and if possible, watch HD-DVDs from my computer on this plasma. Any help would be appreciated. TH-50PX77U Inputs: 2 x HDMI ( 19 pin HDMI Type A ) - Rear, 2 x Audio line-in ( RCA phono ) - Rear, 2 x Component video input ( RCA phono x 3 ) - Rear, 1 x Composite video output ( RCA phono x 3 ) - Rear, 2 x Audio line-in - Rear, 1 x Audio line-out ( RCA phono ) - Rear
