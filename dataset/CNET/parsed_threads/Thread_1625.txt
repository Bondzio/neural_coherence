<s> My HP 5650 Printer has the ink cartridges jammed at the right side. </s>
<s> The platform that supports the ink cartridges is stuck in the up position which prevents the cartridges from being removed or printing. </s>
<s> Does anyone have an idea on how to fix this? </s>
<s> The printer is less than a year old. </s>
<s> Your best bet with power off is to remove the covers in order to directly work on the area. </s>
<s> Any slight of hand, twiddling from the side with covers on may work, but frustration comes quickly. </s>
<s> More important, you may break or find a broken part. </s>
<s> More than likely the ink cart got unseated then jammed. </s>
<s> Also, if left for a longtime, any excessive ink may have dried the parking cup/seal and got stuck. </s>
<s> -OR- the belt broke, etc. </s>
<s> a direct view is best to see what has to be done. </s>
<s> HP parts surfer offers a detailed view of items to see what you're dealing with, use that as a guide, though it does tell you how to remove covers, use common sense. </s>

<s> HP parts surfer &quot;DOESN't&quot; tell you how to remove covers. </s>
<s> I tried to unjam the platform but dried ink from the cartridge is not the problem. </s>
<s> I have heard of the other HP platforms jamming. </s>
<s> Anyone else have any other suggestions? </s>
<s> Hate to junk the printer! </s>
<s> I have the same prblrm with my 5650. </s>
<s> The power light comes on for about a second after connection to the mains then goes off. </s>
<s> It does not come on again when pressed. </s>
<s> The printer status light is continually on even after replacing the cartridges. </s>
<s> The platform does not move and of course the printer will not print. </s>
<s> Yes, I get the same thing with my lights. </s>
<s> Do you have a solution to this problem? </s>
