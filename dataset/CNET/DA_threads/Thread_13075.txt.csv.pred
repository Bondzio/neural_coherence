1.1.1	I am building a computer for the first time and i have a few questions .	St
1.1.2	Will an Antec 350w case with ps be enough to power an amd 64 3000+ , dvdrw drive , geforce fx 5200 ?	Ques
1.1.3	Which would be easier to set up ide or sata hd .	St
1.1.4	If i had just the dvdrw on its own channel would i set it to slave or master and if i decided to go with an ide hd would i put the two on the same channel or on different ones and if they were on the same which would be slave and master ?	Ques
1.2.1	& quot ; will a 350w ps be enough to power an amd 64 3000+ , dvdrw drive , geforce fx 5200 ? & quot ; yes & quot ; which would be easier to set up ide or sata ? & quot ; ide & quot ; If i had just the dvdrw on its own channel would i set it to slave or master ? & quot ; master & quot ; if i decided to go with an ide hd would i put the two on the same channel or on different ones ? & quot ; different ones with the hd as primary master and the dvdrw drive as secondary master & quot ; if they were on the same which would be slave and master ? & quot ; hd = master and dvdrw = slave	St
1.3.1	thanks man , isnt the whole cablin setup of a sata drive easier though ?	Polite
1.3.2	Like do u set a master and slave on sata ?	Ques
1.3.3	Is the recognization of sata drives a little quirkier than it is with ide drives ?	Ques
1.4.1	While that will be a big enough power supply to start the install , you may install hardware that will require a lot more than that in the near future .	St
1.4.2	Get a 400-450W power supply , do n't settle for only 350W .	St
1.5.1	see im lookin at an antec solution series case with a 350w ps or a case from liteon with a 400w ps .	St
1.5.2	Is going with the better company with lower wattage a good idea ?	Ques
1.6.1	In my experience , cases that come with power supplies often times like to rip you off and give you crap .	St
1.6.2	Antec I would trust , and lite-on , yeah maybe I 'd trust them too .	St
1.6.3	But an alternate solution would be to buy a case without a PSU , take the money you save on that , and buy a PSU of your choice .	Sug
1.6.4	That 's how I always do it .	St
1.6.5	and the 350 watts is kinda low for your hardware .	St
1.6.6	Definetly go higher , it never hurts .	St
1.6.7	Hehe , if you can get an xp 3000 i dont think an extra 50-60 will hurt ?	Ques
1.6.8	then again maybe im wrong .	St
