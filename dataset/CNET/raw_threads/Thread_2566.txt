My understanding is that everyone has one if you are on the internet. If I run Belarc advisor, it reports these IP addresses: 1394 Net Adapter NVIDIA nForce Networking Controller primary Auto IP Address: 192.168.1.102 / 24

Unless you pay for it you will only get a single IP from your ISP. That is your 71.56.46.184 address. Since there is only 1 ip address the device you plug into the modem or other device the ISP uses gets this IP. If you run without a router your PC will directly get the ip. When you use a router the router pretends all the machines at your location come from the same address. In effect your machine has 2 addresses. The 192.168.1.102 is your &quot;fake&quot; address. These are actually called private addresses and are used to reduce the actual number of ip used.

But not that I'm adding to the topic at hand; I would take that private information off the web. It may open you up to spam or other personal privacy invasion. Just a little warning.
