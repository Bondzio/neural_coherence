is there a known issue with the belkin n+ router and too many networks in the neighborhood.
i live in an apartment building and my laptop can easily pick up 10-15 wireless networks.
i recently installed a belkin n+ router.
i am using an hp pavillion notebook running windows vista.
if the laptop is fairly close to the belkin router, i get fairly quick webpage downloads.
if i move the laptop to a different room, maybe 30-40 feet away from the router, i have very slow connection and frequent network drops.
i have already tried changing channels.
i am beginning to wonder if i purchased the wrong router.
any thoughts?
thanks
