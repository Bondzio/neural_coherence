A failing PSU will cause error beeps; but if the PSU is indeed bad (or on its last legs), your computer wouldn't post at all, let alone give you error beeps.
I don't understand why you wouldn't trust error code beeps from your computer in first place, as these errors are coming directly from the source...your motherboard.
And if you can't trust what your motherboard is trying to convey to you, I really don't have a solution for you.
