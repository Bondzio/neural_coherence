1.1.1	I am thinking about buying a Pentium 4 3.0 800mhz and a AIW radeon 9800,for my shuttle sb65g2, but i am unsure if it will handle the heat output.	St
1.1.2	Could anyone please tell me if the SB65G2 will handle the heat or will it overheat?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks Chris	Polite
1.2.1	When installing a hi-end video card which will generate heat plus any from system itself will tend to stress the innards.	St
1.2.2	You need to be sure you can exhaust any heat build-up.	St
1.2.3	Plus, depending on case size added attention for exhaust is a must and/or air circulation of intake to outtake.	St
1.2.4	If possible install more vents or forced air exhaust(s).	St
1.2.5	hope this helps... good luck -----Willy	Polite
