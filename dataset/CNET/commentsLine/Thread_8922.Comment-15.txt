now, i'm totally puzzled.
hooked up the pingplotter to the modem and it's significantly worse.
right now, loss of a packet every 30 - 60 minutes - not significant, at the modem level, losing packets every 2-3 minutes - pretty significant.
same with the dsl.
so two different connections both with the same issues, would suggest a wiring issue coming into the house...at least i think.
how can it be worse on the modem than the router, is the router 'cleaning up' the signal?
workign through this in my head, the problem is before modem, after modem or in modem.
i've ruled out after modem (switch, router ok) isp has ruled out modem and before modem remotely.
any ideas?
