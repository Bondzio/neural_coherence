how much do you think my computer is worth?
well i mean i know how much i paid for it back in december 25, 2004 but i'm just curious if it has lost much value as of yet.
thanks in advance compaq presario desktop windows xp home edition 3000+ amd sempron processor 512 mb pc2700 ddr sdram memory 120gb 7200rpm ultra dma hard drive cd-rw/dvd-rom combo drive 48x32x16x48x max speed processor speed 2.00ghz 512mb l2 cache 333mhz front side bus built in front access 9-in-1 memory card reader, usb 2.0 and firewire ports 17inch flat pannel crt moniter jbl platinum series speakers standard keyboard and mouse (  ) just a curiousty question of course.
and while i'm here i was just curious when should i upgrade my computer to add more memory (expandable to 2gb (looked at it from specs from website) ) not worried about harddrive cause i use this for my ipod mini and just regular aol instant messenging and internet, microsoft office and such.
also, when it does come time, is it easier to buy a new computer or upgrade the cpu?
(for instance for 64bit) as in time and cost wise.
thanks in advance again.
