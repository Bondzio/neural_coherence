Any of you guys heard about intellipaper? They have information stored on a paper that goes into your USB drive. They have a website but it doesn't show much of what the USB is capable of holding on it. Has anyone out there used it?

Such posts are considered spam and are cleaned off without notice. There is nothing new going on here. Just someone trying the old SEO ploy. Bob

Crazy the things people do on here. Thanks for the update though. I still want to know whats up with this intellipaper deal! If i could have business cards that had information on it to plug into a USB i'd totally get it for my biz!
