<s> Hi all, My question is pretty simple but I just can't seem to figure it out. </s>

<s> How can I access these shared folders across my network? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> any particulars about your system, such as your OS, all I can recommend is for you to check your firewall settings and if the computers have the same network name. </s>

<s> and run the network setup wizard on both PCs, making sure the Network name is the same such as MSHOME or HOME, or whatever you want to name your network. </s>
<s> If not you will not be able to share files. </s>
<s> Have you tried using (add network place) listed at the top left of the Net Work Places? </s>
<s> Im running three Dells, using XP, and sometime need to use the process after adding a shaired file. </s>
<s> Go into My Network Place, then under Network Task (to the left) click on Add a network place. </s>
<s> Welcome will come up, just click NEXT. </s>
<s> Go down to (Choose another network location) and click.Then click NEXT. </s>
<s> You can now check that both of your PC are listed, and the files you are shairing are listed, when you click on the down arrow,or use the BROWSE Entire Network. </s>
