1.1.1	My grandson installed a new graghics card in his computer and his LCD monitor wouldn't work right.	St
1.1.2	After doing the calculations and going to the Antec website to verify the numbers it turns out he needs to upgrade his power supply.	St
1.1.3	There are so many brands out there, which is the best brand?	St
1.1.4	He wants to stay in the $100 or below range.	St
1.1.5	We are going to put in either a 500 or 550 watt unit (he has a 300watt now) and am looking at the Antec or Thermaltake brand.	St
1.1.6	Is there any difference dependability wise of these two brands or are there better ones.	St
1.1.7	Any advise would be appreciated.	St
1.1.8	Wayne	St
1.2.1	Why?	St
1.2.2	The Thermaltake's could be fine but I find SLEEVE BEARING FANS in much of their gear with the better ball bearing fans in the Antec's.	St
1.2.3	Why bother?	St
1.2.4	The sleeve bearing fans tend to last about 2 years here.	St

1.3.1	The two you mentioned are decent brands.	St
1.3.2	Some users *may* complain of noise levels but even with good brands, there are so many models it does get confusing.	St
1.3.3	I suggest besides using a wattage calculator buy the biggest hunking psu and brandname and provide for a stable system.	St
1.3.4	The better the psu the more the cost, but cost does pay back in a stable system.	St
1.3.5	Take into acct.	St
1.3.6	if it fails it may take other devices/components with it.	St
1.3.7	As for noise, look for the dB levels as part of the specs.,, however as stated so many psus out there check at these websites and others: http://www.geeks.com http://www.newegg.com httpp://www.cyberguys.com for cost comparisons.	St
1.3.8	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	I had a little more time to research power supplies and have decieded to get the Antec NEOHE 550 watt power supply.	St
1.4.2	It does go over his $100 buget, but I will make up the difference as this looks like a very good supply from the reviews.	St
1.4.3	They have it at Circuit City here in town, so we don't have to worry about the shipping.	St
1.4.4	Thanks again.	Polite
1.4.5	Wayne	St
1.5.1	they've gotten bad reviews.	Polite
1.5.2	the antec basiq 500w ($50 at circuit city) is probably the best $50 power supply.	St
1.5.3	here are some other suggestions: coolermaster extreme 550w ($55) and coolermaster extreme 600w ($70) (good budget choices but somewhat noisy) enermax liberty 500w antec neo-he 550w ($88) but it's difficult to recommend any over the basiq for most PCs.	St
1.6.1	Thanks for those links.	St
1.6.2	I just picked up the Antec neo-he 550 and we are going to put it in the computer tomorrow AM.	St
1.6.3	That should take care of the problem.	Sug
1.6.4	Thanks again.	Polite
