1.1.1	ive currently got a computer in which i am looking to upgrade the ram and motherboard .	St
1.1.2	my specs are : motherboard-intel g43 chipset cpu-intel core2 quad [ 2.5 ghz ] gpu-nvidea gt610 1gb ram-6gb ddr2 psu-220w os-win7 64 bit i would like to upgrade my ram because i use programs like c4d as well as many games in which i feel restricted because of my ram .	St
1.1.3	i occasionaly get an & quot ; out of memory & quot ; pop up when rendering high poly objects in c4d .	St
1.1.4	i am hoping to get new ram of ddr3 2133mhz quality or higher .	St
1.1.5	i need to upgrade the motherboard aswell because it is only compatible with ddr3 1066mhz max .	St
1.1.6	heres what im thinking ... if i were to go ahead and upgrade motherboard as well one that is both compatible with my cpu and higher end ram speeds is non existant .	Ques
1.1.7	i would also need to upgrade my cpu .	St
1.1.8	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx ? ItemList=Combo.1199688 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx ? ItemList=Combo.1199687 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx ? ItemList=Combo.1173352 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx ? ItemList=Combo.1198972 these are my choices for a cpu-mb upgrade .	Ques
1.1.9	if there is a way to get 2k speed ram without upgrading my cpu that would be great .	St
1.1.10	also what is better as far as the intel i3 vs the A10 posted above as far as preformance .	St
1.1.11	okay , this is the last stuff .	St
1.1.12	im also going to upgrade my case .	St
1.1.13	i just though i would throw that in there incase you had a comment on it .	St
1.1.14	here are links for the ram i wish to achieve and also the case .	St
1.1.15	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820231476 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16811146070 i know its long but thanks for reading all the way to here .	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	No matter what you do your going to need a psu and a gpu ... ... .that 's a given .	St
1.3.2	No machine will support 2000+ ram unless you overclock ... ... .do n't go there .	St
1.3.3	Your cpu is not great but it is not bad .	St
1.3.4	Lets try to keep this as cheap as possible ... ... .unless bucks do n't matter ?	Ques
1.3.5	Post a link to your mobo .	St
1.4.1	its being used primarily for gaming but also for 3d graphics programs	St
1.5.1	i am hoping to keep the upgrade under $ 300 [ not including the case ] when you say i am going to need a psu/gpu does that mean a new one or are you just saying that in general .	St
1.5.2	also what would be acceptable ram speeds for a gaming pc .	St
1.5.3	i am pretty new to pc upgrades so im not quite in tune to the speeds that would run it well .	St
1.5.4	the reason i put the 2k ram is because i new they had it and also higher ram speeds so i just threw that out there as an assumption that it was a resonable upgrade ... apparently not .	St
1.6.1	You can not game with your gpu ... ... unless your talking about playing hearts or checkers .	St
1.6.2	You can not upgrade your gpu with that small psu .	St
1.6.3	So ... ..the psu has to be made bigger and then a better gpu can be fitted .	St
1.6.4	Again ... ... .Post a link to your mobo or your machines make and model .	St
1.6.5	Let 's see what were working with .	St
1.7.1	well first off i just got my gpu so im not upgrading already and second off i already do game with it .	St
1.7.2	i posted my specs above and also i dont need to know about my psu .	St
1.7.3	please just answer the questions i asked .	St
1.7.4	im not trying to make a god computer i just want to upgrade it a little bit	St
1.8.1	Benchmark wise the combo with the A10 wins .	St
1.8.2	Good luck with your build .	Polite
