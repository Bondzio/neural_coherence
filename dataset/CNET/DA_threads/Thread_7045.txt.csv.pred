1.1.1	Hello !	St
1.1.2	I have a WD external hard drive .	St
1.1.3	It works well all the time .	St
1.1.4	However , to my surprise , I could not open it yesterday .	St
1.1.5	It only displayed this message : & quot ; The drive is not formatted .	St
1.1.6	Do you want to format it ? & quot ; I do n't know what is going on here .	St
1.1.7	Is it failed or corrupted ?	Ques
1.1.8	Is it still possible for me to access the contained pictures , videos and documents ?	Ques
1.1.9	I know I should have backed up all of them .	St
1.1.10	But , this drive is my backup drive .	St
1.1.11	Help please !	St
1.2.1	Please goto the & quot ; Storage forum & quot ; find the sticky post .	St
1.2.2	The uppermost post on that forum has much info and required details in *possible* rescue of your data .	St
1.2.3	understand , any attempts may further reduce recovery of data , the choice is yours .	St
1.2.4	Also , I like to part that any critical data should be saved to CD/DVD/BD discs as a more safe storage method .	St
1.2.5	Practically all ext .	St
1.2.6	storage media will fail in some way sooner or later , even if yours is a back-up it should n't be the sole backup , you now understand why .	Sug
1.2.7	good luck http : //forums.cnet.com/storage-forum/ tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.3.1	data available elsewhere , then you should be able to format the external and later copy the DATA to it .	St
1.3.2	Otherwise I 'd have to say data on the EXTERNAL was n't BACKUP .	St
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	I am sorry !	Polite
1.4.2	I am not sure whether it is failed because of your poor information .	St
1.4.3	But , that also indicates that your drive and inner data may be still recoverable .	St
1.4.4	In fact , & quot ; not formatted error & quot ; message is often caused by many reasons , such as hard drive damages , virus attack and even computer operating system problems , etc .	St
1.4.5	So , I hope your problem is not so serious .	St
1.4.6	Plunge this SD card to your computer and download a data recovery program to take a chance .	St
1.4.7	Nowadays , many data recovery programs are designed for the user to process their inaccessible data recovery programs .	St
1.4.8	So , you also could select some faithful drive data recovery freeware , such as Recuva , TestDisk and iCare Data Recovery Free , etc .	St
1.4.9	Just search on the internet and download a free one .	St
1.4.10	Note : Before you begin to restore your data , you 'd batter not save anything new on this drive in case of data loss .	St
1.4.11	After data recovery process , you should back up your retrieved data on another computer and format this drive to make it work again .	St
1.5.1	Thank you for your replies .	Polite
