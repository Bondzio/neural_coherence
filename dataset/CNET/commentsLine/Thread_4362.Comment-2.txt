this is discussed in the forum sticky but.
the lazy way to do this is to use your new router as a switch/ap.
hook a cable between lan ports on both your new and old router.
all your devices will use 192.168.36.0. you should still be able to use all the wireless capability just none of the router functions.
mostly it would be firewall and content filter type stuff.
the other way is to run the dual nat configuration.
you would put your new router on the dsl and then plug the wan interface of the security router to a lan port of the new router.
the main disadvantage to doing this is if you need to map ports from the internet to a device in your security area you have to map the ip though both routers.
it is also much more troublesome to make machines talk between the 2 networks than if they were on the same subnet.
