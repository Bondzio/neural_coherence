i have read absolutly horrible user reviews for dell, alienware, hp but have not seen many negitive on gateway.
the editors reviews read very positive for gateway except little room for expansion and sloppy wiring.
is there a source of reviews of the reviews?
is there any reviewers that buy the units they test not get them direct from manufacturer?
for around $3,000.00 for a new gaming pc i don't want to get stuck with bad product or service.
