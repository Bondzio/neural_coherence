Hi I am going to purchase a new desktop to replace current six-year-old Dell Dimension 8250. I am a senior and this will probably be my last comuter. I am only a general user but want the most &quot;bang for the buck&quot; PC. I am strongly considering an Acer Aspire X3200-ED5600A or Acer Aspire X1700-U3700A(I think these are almost the same machine but believe I can purchase the 3200 a little cheaper-it looks as though the major differences are the Graphics Controllers: the 3200 uses the NVIDIAGeForce8200 and the 1700 uses the NVIDIA GeForce G100 and the Processors: the 3200 uses AMD Athlon X2 5600+ 2.9 GHz dual core and the 1700 uses the Intel Pentium Dual Core E5200 2.4 GHz Any significant differences? Common Components Storage Controller: Serial ATA-300 Op. Storage: DVD RW/DVD-RAM Ram: 4 GB DDR2 SDRAM Cache Mem.: 1 MB L2 Cache Small Form Factor OS: Vista Home Premium 64 bit Hard Drive: 640 GB Audio Output: 5.1 channel surround The 3200 would cost about $415 online with free shipping and the 1700 would cost about $480 Thoughts on Acer/configuration? The compact space of these is a factor and I do not upgrade components so the lack of upgradeability is not a factor. Regards Ronhawk

Too much heat in too small a space and not many ways to efficiently eliminate it. SFF severely limits HW options ...HS Fans, GPUs, PSUs, etc., in the event of component failure beyond warranty. VAPCMD PS...I'm not far behind you age wise but wouldn't consider SFF unless I needed portability. The smallest I buy for anything is a mid tower with plenty of drives bays for drive spacing/separation, cooling and ease of access in the event I need to repair or replace a component.

I do like the idea of the tower sitting on top of the desk instead of underneath it but can see your point in minimizing potential problems. Can you give me some examples of mid-towers to get me started? I did see a full-size desktop that seemed to have everything I would want-Gateway DX 4720-03, NVIDIA GeForce7100, DVDRW/DVD-RAM w/Labelflash, 4GB RAM(8GB max)DDR2-800MHz PC2-6400, Vista Home Premium 64 bit, Pen. Dual Core E5200 2.5 GHz, 640 HDD, Fax/Modem-56Kbps, 7.1 channel surround. Opinion? Dell is also having some good prices on their budget pc's. Ronhawk
