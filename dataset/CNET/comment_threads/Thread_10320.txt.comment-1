My husband's cousin came over and messed with our Netgear wireless router's settings, and to make a long story short, now our Dell laptop cannot connect to the wireless network.
He doesn't remember what he did, so now we are stuck.
Before we call Netgear and pay per minute for service, is there anything we can try?
The wireless network shows up when you view the Network Connections, but we are unable to successfully connect to it.
Can anyone help?
Thanks in advance, Jen
