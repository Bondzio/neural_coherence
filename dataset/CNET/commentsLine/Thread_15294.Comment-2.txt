just recently i used my droid, easythether, a windows 7 netbook, ics and a router to do this.
i must decline all the details since to do this you must be able to take the clues i offered and run with it or it's not a solution for you.
i bet something similar could be rigged up using your laptop and a common router but again unless you have a firm grasp on networking this is not a solution.
try this.
goto 3grouter.com and see if that is what you want.
