I'm looking for an external hard drive with around 120 GBs to back up files from my G4 Powerbook.
There seems to be lots of options and just as many opinions about them.
In particular, lots of firewire vs. USB issues.
Is there one company or machine that is known to reliable and well-suited for Macs?
Is there a reason I should use firewire vs. USB 2.0?
Many thanks.
