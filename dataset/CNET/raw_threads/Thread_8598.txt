I have a home network set up with a cable modem and router. Can I set up something that is password protected so I am not exposing my system to every hacker in the universe? My Linksys router has the capability to set up a DMZ outside the firewall, but that seems risky to me. It seems as though there must be a simple way to accomplish all this, but I haven't found it yet!

It has 256-bit encryption, built in antivirus software, and lets you share files of any type - not just pictures. Another bonus for you is that it can work through firewalls and routers without any special configuration. http://www.laplink.com/products/sharedirect/overview.asp
