1.1.1	This is a pretty noob type question , and you 'd think this would be a common question with tons of information on the net.. but god knows I cant find it .	St
1.1.2	Anyway I 'm wondering in medium-to-high end gaming and average desktop applications what is the real-world difference between dual and single core processor ( s ) ?	Ques
1.1.3	And why does an intel dual core at 3.0 ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16819116212 ) cost nearly the same an AMD dual core 2.0 ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16819103562 ) I 'm sure there is some obvious answer I 'm not aware of.. so someone educate me !	St
1.2.1	corporation than AMD and is almost in a life and death struggle since the AMD 's so badly outperformed the Intel P4 's .	St
1.2.2	However , be certain , that Intel is working on recovering their reputation , thus they [ as well as AMD ] will be bringing out new versions of their Dual Cores post haste .	St
1.2.3	IMHO , rather than learn all the details of the inner workings of the present version , I would wait about three months until they come out with their next generation Dual Cores [ not the half arsed thing that Intel just came out with , it did n't even have the thermal protection diode and circuit in it so they could get it out in a hurry ] .	St
1.2.4	Then when the AMD 's support DDR2 [ or they may go directly to DDR3 ] and Intel has the two cores with a decent means of communication between the two cores , and have some chance of being kept cool , then study the details at places such as tomshardware , anandtech , and other such places .	St
1.2.5	Seems that many are totally disenchanted with DDR 2 as not really providing the bandwidth expected with their increased latency .	St
1.2.6	Somehow DDR3 with even higher latency , seems to provide substantially more bandwidth than DDR 2 .	St
1.2.7	Again IMHO , allow the Dual Wars to shake out for a while .	St
1.3.1	... AMD makes better performing single and dual core CPU 's than Intel .	St
1.3.2	The Intels win a couple benchmarks , but the AMD 's pwn them in gaming , and most other benchmarks .	St
1.3.3	Here 's the best CPU comparison chart ; you can choose two CPU 's and directly compare them in real world and synthetic benchmarks .	St
1.3.4	http : //www23.tomshardware.com/cpu.html	St
1.4.1	to the original poster .	St
1.4.2	Twas an excellent post by you .	St
1.4.3	Or put the name of the person that you are referring to in the subject line .	St
1.5.1	Ah good advice .	Polite
1.5.2	That 's pretty much what I expected- currently I 'm sure tryin to decide what kinda of a mobo to buy so down the road when I can afford a new processor I 'm compatible with the best options..	St
1.6.1	that 's excellent- thank you sir !	Polite
1.7.1	new socket type that AMD MUST go to in order to support DDR2 or DDR3 or whatever they finally choose .	St
1.8.1	... you 're welcome ?	Ques
1.8.2	My P4 said bye bye , so now I 'm trying to decide which A64 and board I 'm going to get .	St
1.8.3	I 'm probably going to get the 3700+ , but I 'm undecided about the motherboard .	St
1.9.1	Is anyone taking into concideration that there 's not a lot of software out there to fully take advantage of the dual core 's features and processing powers ?	Ques
1.9.2	It 's new ... let it sit for a while and let software catch up before you dish out some money due to hype and vibe .	St
1.9.3	The way i see it a dual core system is a PlayStation2 when it first came out .	St
1.9.4	And everyone 's playing PS1 games on it thinking they 're modern and in the loop .	St
1.9.5	well imagine how much better when there are more PS2 games designed to run on the PS2 .	St
1.9.6	But hey that 's just me	St
1.10.1	... Heavy multitaskers who use Photoshop and Flash at the same time as they have documents , spreadsheets , and browser windows open .	St
1.11.1	I ( like about 20 million other kids ) am dying to update my system to get Oblivion running well.. so the wait could kill me ... heh Let me put it to you this way- if you were going to buy a board now- givin what you know ( and it should probably be nvidia and AMD friendly ) what would you do ?	Ques
1.12.1	This is a topic that lots of people will have differnt things to suggest .	St
1.12.2	People out there , wanting to upgrade , or build a new system now , sometimes ca n't wait ( my intel system just crashed ) and with all the newly developing options and outlooks make things more confusing than ever .	St
1.12.3	As for what was said about waiting for the newer AMD board , supporting faster memory , in most situations todays memory should be good enough ... right ?	Ques
1.12.4	The question burning me up right now , is what current specs will be needed for future developments ( OS , Dual Core , 64bit , meory speed ) , and what will be optional/benificial .	St
1.13.1	I think you might be getting confused with 64-bit .	St
1.13.2	As long as the operating system deals with dual-core processors correctly , the applications do n't need to do anything extra to support them .	St
1.13.3	Win XP Pro can take two threads of a normal application and run them through seperate cores .	St
1.13.4	Mac OS X does the same thing .	St
1.13.5	The Linux SMP kernel does it too .	St
1.13.6	Some programs might crash if run on a multi-core machine on a system which supports it , but that 's something different .	Sug
1.13.7	64-bit support , on the other hand , needs to be coded into applications .	St
1.13.8	-- -- -- -- -- - May I just add that dual-core processors are good for thin-client situations ?	Ques
1.13.9	On Linux , you can have all tasks performed by a server , and have many thin clients which just transmit key presses and mouse movements , and recieve screen image in return ( well , it 's not actually a screen image , but that 's just the easiest way to describe it ) .	St
1.13.10	A multiple-core processor works wonders in these servers , as programs can then run in each core .	St
