well... call me dumb but !!!
I'm damn confused !!!
HELP big time...
I'm scared, i might Ruin the card, if i do some blunder !!!
i got a AGP card FX 6800... now i don't know how to connect.... apparently it has one connector (on AGP card) from where &quot;two Molex connectors branch out&quot; (does that means... i need to use two molex connectiors, from my power supply ?)
Am i to connect one Molex connector... or Two ?
help... Gsoul
