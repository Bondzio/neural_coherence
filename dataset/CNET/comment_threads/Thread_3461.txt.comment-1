I was wondering if any one would be able to help me: I recently bought a new MOBO: GIGABYTE GA-7N400 PRO2.
I also bought a new case (which is no probs), a new power supply: Q-TEC 450W, new RAM: Kingston 512MB DDR Pc3200, and a new processor: AMD 3200+.
I kept my old graphics card: Nvidia 64MB Ti-4200.
I connected all the items to the MOBO and did what it said in quick set up, but when I turn the computer on it doesnt even do a P.O.S.T, no bios beeps nothing, all the fans come on but nothing else no monitor response nothing.
I just wondered if someone could help me!!!
THANK YOU
