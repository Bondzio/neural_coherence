1.2.1	The whole purposes of any & quot ; system/bios updates & quot ; is to correct known glitches or make it more compatible .	St
1.2.2	If you 're doing all you need to do and happy doing it , leave well enough alone .	St
1.2.3	Just keep in mind should a problem arise the potential is there at a system fix level may have been in the works all the time .	St
1.2.4	As a good rule of thumb , when building a new system , I install all bios and h/w updates plus the OS ones then proceed with the apps , etc .	St
1.2.5	to do the tasks required .	St
1.2.6	Even those may ask or require they be updated for best operation .	St
1.2.7	But , again if things are working and stable just accept it .	St
