1.1.1	Help !	St
1.1.2	No Monitor Signal / AGP slot Here is what I Started out with .	St
1.1.3	Asus A7N8X Deluxe Socket A Motherboard AMD Athlon XP 3000+ CPU 333FSB Barton Retail w/Fan Seagate 80GB Serial ATA HD 7200/8MB/S-ATA-150 Albatron GeForceFX 5200 128MB 8X AGP w/TV Out/DVI PNY 512MB PC3200 DDR 400MHz ( x2=1024MB ) Sony DVD Burner So then , I was installing a new power supply ( because of the old PS fan wouldnt spin correctly causing it to smoke issue ) ( BUT STILL FULLY WORKING PRIOR TO INSTALLING NEW PS AND HD ) and I also installed a new secondary SATA 250 GB hard drive .	St
1.1.4	In addition I cleaned out the case with a can of air and I let that dry .	St
1.1.5	I power it up and all the fans are running but I am getting ZERO signal to the monitor !	St
1.1.6	I got a couple beeps the first time / Was n't paying attention to the beeps though .	St
1.1.7	I ruled out the monitor by hooking it up to my laptop .	St
1.1.8	I have a video card in the AGP slot ( as opposed to PCI slot ) and so i thought it was the video card ... well at this time I run out to Walmart at midnight and buy a new AGP video card for 100 bucks ! !	St
1.1.9	Get it home and it still did n't work .	St
1.1.10	( Will be taking that back today ) !	St
1.1.11	So do you have any ideas as to why the signal is not getting to the monitor ?	Ques
1.1.12	Should I try a PCI video card ... Everything was fine before I installed that new power supply and hard drive ... and I was grounded for static electricity as well ... P.S .	St
1.1.13	I do remember removing one of my 512MB sticks to get the hard drive in the rack .	St
1.1.14	Then I put it right back .	St
1.1.15	Would memory affect this ?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	I must have reseated the video card 1000 times already ! !	St
1.3.2	Plus bought another one !	St
