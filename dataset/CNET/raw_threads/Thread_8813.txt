I think my other one has had it and so does the guy at the computer store. If I'm going to upgrade, then I'd like something that fits my needs. I want a motherboard that will stand up to programs such as editing software including AVID, Photoshop, Illustrator, Aftereffects...to run simultaneously. I currently have two gigs of ram (DDR2) that I purchased which my current motherboard cannot handle. So it would need to support those. It needs to be fast. I'm assuming Intel 4 Dual Core Processor...but what do I know? I would like a pretty decent graphics card...at least to support guitar hero!! It also should have at least 4 slots for additional cards. Any suggestions would be much appreciated?? Obviously want it as cheap as possible, but able to support what I have listed...Thanks. Andy

I currently have a Pentium D processor. I was just curious to know how this compares to what you suggested, and if its worth me purchasing another one?

The power supply that I have is a Retail Plus 465 Watt with a dual fan. I just want to make sure this will be fine to power my new hardware. The guy at the store mentioned that I would need something at least 500 watts. Just wanted to know your thought. Thanks
