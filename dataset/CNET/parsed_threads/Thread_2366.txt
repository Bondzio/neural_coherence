<s> I just replaced all the ink cartridges and did all the various check-ups (head alignment, head cleaning, nozzle check) but the quality of the printouts are poor and there are many streaks throughout the page. </s>
<s> I keep redoing all the tests but nothing seems to fix the problems. </s>
<s> I just brought it home from college and it worked perfectly fine there. </s>
<s> I'm not sure how transporting it could have affected it but is that a possibility? </s>
<s> I've had this printer for two years and have moved a couple of time since and never had this problem before. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> i am having the exact same problem with my 5200. </s>
<s> I called tech support and since i was no longer on the warranty, they wanted to charge me 10.00 to try and troubleshoot my problem. </s>
<s> He basically went thru everything on the website to clean the heads. </s>
<s> After 1 hr on he phone the tech support said that the unit needed to be serviced. </s>
<s> The unit is on barely 3 yrs old and used occasionally. </s>
<s> I went out and bought a HP. </s>
<s> It seems that the print head is a major issue with epsons. </s>
<s> I still have a HP 660cse deskjet 1o yrs old and still printing. </s>
<s> Many berate the printer companies for printers that only last a few years, but the prices have come a long way so some slack is needed. </s>
<s> Do we really need to return to 1,000 dollar printers so you can get 10 years of use? </s>
<s> -&gt; About your ink on the paper issue. </s>
<s> It's this simple. </s>
<s> Some ink is on a roller, guide or another part along the paper path. </s>
<s> If you can't clean it up, then you buy a new printer. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I had this problem more than one time. </s>
<s> The first time I paid $40 to EPSON repair center and they cleaned it, but also said they did not find anything wrong with it! </s>
<s> The second time I was frustrated and left it sit in a corner CONNECTED TO POWER BUT TURNED OFF. </s>
<s> After two weeks I turned it on and it worked perfectly until I had to change the yellow color. </s>
<s> It does not print yellow ever since, and I've been trough two cartridges so far. </s>
<s> It shows that the yellow ink level is going down but in reality it's not spitting it out. </s>
<s> So let it sit a bit. </s>
<s> I will not pay another $40 to save it. </s>
<s> It odes not do anything to superlative. </s>
<s> Abandoning Epson is not a solution if you look for top quality prints at a reasonable price. </s>
<s> The cheapest to operate seems to be Canon, and most expensive HP. </s>
<s> Epson is the middle - price wise, but best in print quality. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
