My wife got a new laptop with wireless card. She wants a wireless conection. How can I come off of my switch to turn one port into wireless? I looked for a wireless switch can find nothing but commercial stuff. I was under the impression that if you added a router it would confuse the other router up stream or vise versa. ANY IDEAS WOULD BE GREAT!! THANKS

I won't start a row here over which brand and model is best, you can research that easily enough. When you get one, just substitute it for your existing wired router. Be aware that nearly all the wireless routers in fact have the usual complement of four wired ethernet ports on the back too, so it will be a one-for-one swap of devices with your current router. First you'll need to configure it for your particular ISP service, and then SECURE IT. Securing your router is important, but often ignored. dw

I prefer replacing the old router with a wireless router. Makes life simpler and often is less expensive than a WAP. Look at your local computer stores, electronics stores, and office supply stores for the major small office/home office brands (Linksys, D-Link, Netgear, Belkin).

I know this sounds crazy but the network is already sensitive enough, lol, i would rather add downstream. I am on my 2nd router in 3 years and about every 3 or 4 days it seems I have to reboot the router for unknow reasons. I starting to wonder if its my ISP doing that somehow. I know they would rather me pay an extra 10 bucks a month per IP address.. ThANKS AGAIN

Many consider it a good idea to use the same brand of hardware to reduce problems and make any tech support calls a one-stop affair. Sensitive network hardware? I have seen such. As to flaky routers and other network hardware, using the latest firmware upgrade usually solves the problem. Spyware infestations have also become a common cause for when good connections go bad.
