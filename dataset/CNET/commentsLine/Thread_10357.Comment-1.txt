hello everyone, which application can i use to create bootable files for usb flash drive?
my old board supports usb but its award bios 4.51 did not include usb in its boot sequence.
boot options are: lz/zip, scsi, cdrom, a, c, d, and all logical drives no usb boot but the mobo supports it.
which software can i use to create usb bootable files to replace sluggish floppy disk or replace the zip option?
