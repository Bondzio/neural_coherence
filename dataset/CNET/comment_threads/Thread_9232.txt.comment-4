In most cases like yours, swapping out the PSU is the best resource to do.
Further, since you mentioned it, I would have a pro look at your electrical AC outlets.
No telling what could be happening there to include possible safety issues.
I suggest that strongly because I have found either due to a old house or improper wiring that either the new or past homeowner had made changes that compromised the electrical circuits in some fashion.
If you don't already, use a surge protector and/or AC line conditioner if you have poor power in your region, like brown outs, etc.. Last, don't settle for &quot;cheap&quot; anything you'll know the value of cheap far too often when they fail or less desirable when they don't do the job they're suppose to.
A UPS offer a simple surge protection but these are mainly to power down a system in a controlled manner if lost of power NOT to be the main protection from electrical problems other than shutdown.
An ext.
surge strip and similar at AC cord connector itself an help further than singular strops, etc.. good luck tada -----Willy
