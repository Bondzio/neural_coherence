After playing with the Nook Color I decided as a BN Nook I wasn't going to get much use from it. I went to http://mrm3.net/nook-color-how-to-gingerbread-guide/ and turned it into an Android tablet. I installed Amazon's Kindle reader than thought &quot;This Nook Color is a very nice Kindle Reader.&quot; Bob

But, just read your &quot;price is not an issue&quot; again.... so you may want to just up for the iPad if you got the cash.
