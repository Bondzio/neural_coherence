One major problem with OEM systems like Dell, Gateway, etc., is when you decide to replace the mtrbd.
The physical size and location of mountings may not be proper or outright not compatible as a direct replacement.
What this means is you have to verify any replacement mtrbd.
is rated or designed to be one for your Dell system, otherwise don't expect an easy drop-in and proceed forward w/o extra effort.
I suppose you were trying to re-use the Dell case?
If not and plan to buy or have access to a generic of DYI case source, then you're OK. Last, don't expect the OS to be transferable, it may but it may not.
The OEM supplied OS is prone to work only what it was sold with, however Dell is more flexible than others, but again, I can't say for your model, 100% sure.
