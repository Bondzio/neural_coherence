<s> When I put my computer on stand by the fan continues to run. </s>
<s> Is this normal, or should it stop? </s>
<s> I have windows X P </s>
<s> No details I can find to start a discussion but since &quot;XP&quot; knows nothing about what to do with the fan (that's a driver thing) what you asked can be answered with &quot;sounds proper for XP.&quot; If you want to look into if such is possible we'd have to see if the unit has fan controls. </s>
<s> Most desktops didn't have such. </s>

<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> Do you know how I find out if the unit has fan control Anne </s>
<s> And XP is the version released back in 2000. </s>
<s> It didn't do much without the service packs and drivers. </s>
<s> Until more is known about this machine, it could be working properly. </s>

<s> I will have to contact the Guy I bought it from, as it's not a recognised brand. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply </s>
<s> The fans are connected to the computer's power supply. </s>
<s> In standby by this power supply is &quot;on&quot; and since the fans are connected to that supply the fans are &quot;on&quot; as well. </s>
<s> This is why nothing may be wrong. </s>
