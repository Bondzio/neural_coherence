I had 2 DDR 512mb ram pc3200 bars A year ago I installed 2 more 512mb DDR pc3200 modules, and it read in bios it is 1gb of ram but I managed to solve it somehow. A week ago I changed their places, but restored everything as it was before I started &quot;solving&quot; another problem. The two old bars are double sided and new ones are single, both 400mhz. When everything was ok, double where placed on green slots and single on purple. Every module works fine on its own, and 2 double or one single & one double or 2 single also work fine. Motherboard is MSI K8N Neo4. What to do?

The fact that each pair works on its own is interesting but does not mean that both pairs can work at the same time. It's very technical and I will not write the long answer anymore. But to fix this I'll order the sticks from Crucial.com Bob
