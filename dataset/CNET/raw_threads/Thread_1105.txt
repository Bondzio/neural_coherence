My wife and I recently moved from the U.S. to France and are now looking to get a multifunction printer/scanner to assist us with out work. Since we are only here for two-years, we were hoping to get one that has a Universal Power Supply, so that we can bring it back to the States with us. Sadly, I may be using the wrong search criteria on the internet, since I cannot find any info on these. Or, maybe they just don't exist. Any input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

From what I know that is universal (actually terrestrial Earth) so you may only need to look at the AC adapters and not the printers. Bob
