I have an emachines T6212 desktop that is hardly adequate for the tasks I want to use my computer for. Therefore, I am seriously looking at an upgrade. If possible, I am hoping to be able to use the existing case and PSU, just upgrading the motherboard, CPU, and RAM. Is this a realistic dream? Or will I need to also get a new power supply, and if so, how powerful of a PSU do I need? Here are the details: Current Computer: emachines T6212 desktop AMD Athlon 64 3200+ 2.0GHz single core, 512 K L2 Cache 120 GB Western Digital IDE hard drive upgraded to 2.5 GB DDR RAM micro-ATX motherboard (no specified manufacturer), model # MS-7093, ATI Xpress 200 chipset 180W PSU New components (or what I hope to have): sub-$100 micro-ATX motherboard, likely an MSI 880GM-E43 AMD Phenom II X4 955 processor hope to eventually have all 4 RAM slots full Thank you all

Newer ones are in the entry level and offered at $400 or less. While you may need to wait when a deal pops-up, now is a good time as the &quot;school sales&quot; are happening. You can get your hands on decent systems, mutli-core cpu, std. ram, large HD, and warranty woo to include the Win7 OS. That's a good bargain in my book for those looking for a deal. Compared to building an &quot;upgraded PC&quot; you may find the costs similar but compare anyways. tada -----Willy

Seeing how as I plan on using this new computer for moderately intense gaming, as well as 3D design, I am trying to get as much power as I can possibly get for my money, and the components I have mentioned in my original post cost less than $250 total. Even if I did need a new case and PSU, that would still be below $300. Thanks for the suggestion, though

Cpu...........100 bucks mobo.........100 bucks Gpu...........100 bucks.........since you mentioned gaming. Psu............100 bucks.........maybe you can use the old one. Ram...........100 bucks If the new mobo won't support pata. HD +optical ..........100 bucks Now you've got a bunch of parts that you have to assemble and hope they work. Then you get to install some old OS on this new hardware........that can be a joke/chore. Your call.

5915	5	538610	5189865	5189446	Willy	8/21/11 6:45 AM	1.3139091E12	Realistic builds	Let's be fair, you didn't mention gaming and 3D usage. So, basically you're trying to build a cheap PC that may fulfill the bottom end of what you plan to see. You mentioned $250 for those components, but I'm very sure you will be above that. Because, the video alone will push it higher getting a better one at least $100-150 or more. Plus, as already posted here, if use of an OEM OS, you will need to replace that as well. You see where this is all going. I suggest you save some more get whatever you really need and then match as best as possible. Building too cheaply will cost you sooner or later if you plan to really get into gaming and 3D usage. Also, a decent PSU that's aname brand is roughly $100+ or more. I offer at least 500w unit may do, but its not uncommon now for 600W or even 700W PSU's to get the nod. This is all about building a tough yet stable PC that will last and hopefully endure long play with proper cooling. tada ------Willy

Again, this computer will be used for only a light to moderate amount of gaming and 3D modeling, mainly to get me started on a more high-performing computer setup. Tell me what you think, and thanks again for all the advice.

5915	8	538610	5191241	5190874	GooglePlexGigahertz	8/23/11 4:52 PM	1.31411832E12	Revision	If indeed that memory kit will not work with that motherboard, I will probably go for the Patriot 8GB Dual G2 series ($53) or Corsair 8GB XMS3 Dual Channel kit ($60).
