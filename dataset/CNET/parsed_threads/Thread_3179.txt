<s> I'm hoping some of you can help me. </s>
<s> I currently have a Logitech MX Revolution mouse and I'm about to throw it through a wall! </s>
<s> It constantly stutters and freezes while I'm playing simple computer games. </s>
<s> I've tried uninstalling the software to see if that helps and the problem still persists. </s>
<s> I've done a lot of research and I'm at a loss at what mouse I should try next. </s>
<s> I really like the ergonomics of the Revolution which I think means I prefer a palm grip. </s>
<s> I also like the cordless factor but I'm not completely opposed to a corded. </s>
<s> I've been looking at gaming mice like the X8 sidewinder, the Logitech G5 & G9, Microsoft Habu and the Razer Death Adder but I'm not sure if the gaming mice would be overkill for me. </s>
<s> The Sidewinder seems like it may be too big for me (I'm a woman) from reviews, but I like the wireless aspect. </s>
<s> The Razer Mamba is the only one I can find that can switch from wired to wireless but paying over $100 for a mouse that has a lot of features I'll never use seems silly to me. </s>
<s> I do not play any hard core games but I would like to get through a game of Luxor without slamming my mouse out of frustration. </s>
<s> I have been looking at mice using a laser tracking system because I don't like to use a mouse pad and use it directly on my desk (wood) - another reason the Sidewinder seemed like a good choice due to the blue track system, but I am afraid of the size. </s>
<s> Does the DPI or wireless capability have anything to do with the problems I'm having or is it just the mouse? </s>
<s> I would really like a mouse with the same ergonomic build that doesn't have the problems I've mentioned. </s>
<s> I have a new computer with plenty of RAM, large hard drive and dual processors so the computer is not the problem. </s>
<s> Any advice would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Hmmm, I would HIGHLY recommend using a mouse pad and specifically a WOW pad, they are designed for use with optical and Laser units. </s>
<s> Some of the issues you have been having could be created by the surface and light refractivity. </s>
<s> I would also recommended using a mousepad that is designed for the type of mouse you get. </s>
<s> Some are only good for optical and some are only good for laser. </s>
<s> Aside from that, I do have some expertise in the mouse division. </s>
<s> If you like the Revolution, you will probably like the similarly-shaped Logitech G5. </s>
<s> It's a solid mouse with plenty of features. </s>
<s> DPI switching is great, and the weight cartridge is a little gimicky, but is great if you're picky about weight. </s>
<s> If you want something really cool, the G500 will be coming out, which is basically a super G5. </s>
<s> Note that just because you like the Revolutions grip, you do not necessarily have a &quot;palm&quot; grip. </s>
<s> You know you have a palm grip when you don't even squeeze the sides of the mouse with your fingers to move it because your palm is on top of it. </s>
<s> If you DO have a palm grip, you can probably use one of the SideWinder mice. </s>
<s> It's not really that much bigger than the G5 length-wise, but people feel like it is because of the height on the back. </s>
<s> If you rest your whole palm on top of the mouse, you will be fine... unless your fingers are child-like small. </s>
<s> It sounds like you don't need a lot of slick macro features and rediculously high DPI engines, so I would recommend the G5. </s>
<s> Mice have changed alot in a few yrs. </s>
<s> Because of that, they too are becoming another task the system has to service. </s>
<s> A std. </s>
<s> PS2 mouse just didn't have so many problems. </s>
<s> Now add IF or wifi and batteries, etc., you get the picture. </s>
<s> As others suggested, get the required pad for better operation. </s>
<s> Understand that during gaming, intense PC usage is at hand even for simple games, that's fact. </s>
<s> Your mouse being yet another device may falter under such conditions. </s>
<s> A simple USB may help as being physically connected loses many of the IF or wifi issues. </s>
<s> Further, they're cheaper and/or tend to work in all aspects of what many users want just being cabled is the holdout. </s>
<s> Now decide....... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thank you to those who replied. </s>
<s> I got the WOW pad today and I cannot even believe it - my mouse is working perfectly! </s>
<s> *knocks on wood* Love this pad b/c it is super thin. </s>
<s> I don't particularly like using a mouse pad to begin with but with this one it is so thin and large that I hardly notice it (except the mouse glides much easier on it than on the desk). </s>
<s> I never even thought that would be a problem b/c I was under the impression that laser mice worked on any surface except glass. </s>
<s> I have a wood grain desk and thought that would be fine. </s>
<s> I also went to Best Buy to try out some mice and the Logitech G5 was my favorite fit, next was the G9. </s>
<s> Did not like the Razer mice - way too flat for me. </s>
<s> They did not have the Sidewinder to try and they also did not have the mice out of the packages so I had to feel them in the plastic. </s>
<s> Staples had them out but had none of the mice I was interested in. </s>
<s> I probably don't even need a new mouse now thanks to your great advice, but if I do I will probably stay with Logitech. </s>
<s> Perhaps I'll wait for that new one that was mentioned to come out to have a good corded mouse on hand should anything happen in the future As far as the palm vs claw grip: I did some research on what each is and mostly hold my mouse in a palm grip but I did notice that for some games that need greater/more precise movement, I pull my palm up slightly and use my fingers more. </s>
<s> I see they call that the fingertip grip. </s>
<s> I suppose I actually use both grips, depending on what I'm doing and I do not use the claw grip at all (although I also found some people consider the fingertip grip and claw grips to be essentially the same thing - my fingers stay pretty flat which is why I think it's probably not considered a claw). </s>
<s> Well, thanks again everybody. </s>
<s> Your help was greatly appreciated! </s>
