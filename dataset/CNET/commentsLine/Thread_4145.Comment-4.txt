make sure you take michael's advice and call your isp.
usually shaky internet service is a problem on the isp end (a bad server/blade/bank).
on more than one occasion over the years, the isp has replaced my modem because its firmware just can't get the job done.
dhcp: make sure you have only one dhcp server enabled.
if your modem is a combo device (modem-router), try keeping its dhcp server enabled, but disable the dhcp server on the other router.
if using wireless, try changing the router/access point to a different channel to avoid interference.
(try channels 1, 6, or 11 in the usa and canada).
spyware scans with at least 2 programs on each computer may reveal a culprit.
