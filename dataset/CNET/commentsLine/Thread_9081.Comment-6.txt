i don't understand this issue of transfer timings.
i've heard of people running hard drives through powered usb hubs all the time.
i just didn't know about an unpowered hub.
what if i use a usb y cable?
it says if the peripheral needs more power than one usb port can give then it has another plug to put into another port so it pulls power from both usb ports.
i can plug the main usb into the port on my pi and the auxillary power one into an adapter?
