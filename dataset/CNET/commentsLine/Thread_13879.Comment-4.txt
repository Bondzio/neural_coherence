tonyreedo, thank you so much for letting us know what worked for you.
i'm in nearly the exact same situation.
only, my hardrive now mounts in disk utility (as an unformatted drive) but it won't show up in disk warrior.
so i'm unable to rebuild the drive.
i'm running the techtoolpro 4/tests/volumes on the drive right now but am unclear on what you did next.
you said &quot;funny, after i ran that then i hit the play button again (running the volume structures test again to rebuild the drive)&quot;.
do you mean you just ran the same test again then quit then opened disk warrior and was able to rebuild?
thanks for your help!
