There is nothing on them that I need, but I would like to see if there is anything that I might want. (previous versions of drafts, unedited copies of older photos etc). What are the chances of me being able to physically take the actual disk out and putting it into a working HD?

Unless you have the equipment ... working spare parts and use of a 'clean room' to perform the disassembly and reassembly .... you're chances of getting them working never mind data accessing the data would appear poor at best.
