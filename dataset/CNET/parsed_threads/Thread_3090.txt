<s> I have an old Dlink DI-604 that I'd like to configure to work as a switch. </s>
<s> I think this is possible but not sure how to do it. </s>
<s> Switches are cheap but if I could save a few bucks with some tweaking I'd prefer that. </s>
<s> Plus I figure I'd learn a bit about networking. </s>
<s> Dlinks site on the DI-604: http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=62 My main problem is I have Uverse and I'm out of wired ports on the Residential Gateway. </s>
<s> I would like 2 more ports to network my PC and NAS, so my laptop and Xbox can access their files. </s>
<s> I'd configure it as WAP. </s>
<s> I see no reason to use any other method even if this has no wifi. </s>
<s> I'd use the same instructions. </s>
<s> Google this -&gt; How to configure a router as a WAP. </s>

<s> I'll give it a go. </s>
<s> How about this tutorial, looks detailed enough but I have never done this before and don't have a lot of networking experience. </s>
<s> http://www.speedguide.net/articles/how-to-set-a-wireless-router-as-an-access-point-2556 </s>
<s> I know it's a little difficult but the idea is to play along with those instructions as if it's a wifi router. </s>
<s> Just skip over any wifi areas and it should work. </s>

<s> I have to be honest, I don't 100% understand what I did and it took a bit but I got it working. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
