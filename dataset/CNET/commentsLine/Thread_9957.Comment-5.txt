thank you mrmacfixit, i have installed the external hard drive as well as 10.5.4 on it not too bad it was simpler than i had thought.
i thank you very much.
i heard of problems in the past running maya 8.0 or 8.5 on mac 10.5 so i didn't want to take the chance, thats why i wanted to keep the 10.4. i now realize that the maya does work just as good on the 10.5 mac osx and i didn't even have to re-install it (beautiful thing).
zbrush 3 dose not run on mac 10.4 thats why i got the external hard drive to put 10.5 on to be able to run zbrush 3.12. in the end it all worked out and i dont even need the 10.4 now.
so i can now use the external as a back up yay.
do you use these graphics programs?
you seen very knowledgeable about them.
if you do theres another great tool out now its called unity 3d.
pretty awesome program if you ever want to check it out?
its my whole purpose of using these programs.
you can even create games for the iphone, mac, pc, wii, and all of they above.
now if i could only afford the zbrush lol thanks alot have a great day and happy holidays.
sincerely, michael
