My computer will have these specs: AMD Sempron 3300+ 2GHZ 512MB DDR PC2100 RAM GeForce Verto FX 6200 256MB graphics card. DVD drive. Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 Asrock K7S41 Motherboard. Will I be able to play Far Cry, Half Life 2, and Doom 3 with these specs? And run them smoothly? I've read reviews on both my processor and graphics card and they seem to run pretty well. What do you think? Thanks for your help.
