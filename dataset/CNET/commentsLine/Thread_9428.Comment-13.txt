accept that and buy what you want today.
if you keep your computers for several years most of the parts will be different/incompatible regardless of whether you wait a bit.
if you want a faster socket am2 cpu in a year or two you'll probably want a new motherboard with the latest chipset to go with it, along with higher-grade ram that'll be much cheaper by then.
i'd get an athlon 64 x2 cpu, 1gb or 2gb of ram, preferably a nvidia chipset (gateway's new retail store machines look interesting), and should integrated graphics prove inadequate drop in a geforce 7600 pcie card in a month or two when they come out (should be a good midrange card, or go straight to the 7900 if your power supply can handle it).
get a good 19&quot; or larger lcd monitor.
gateway's 21&quot; widescreen lcd looks very interesting.
if you ever buy a hdtv tuner, or even just play dvds, you'll appreciate widescreens.
that will be enough for 64-bit windows vista late this year (2gb ram preferably, ram is cheap, easy to upgrade later though).
you'll want the dualcore x2 cpu.
there's a lot to be said for custom-building your own pc but these days it's cheaper to buy a prebuilt machine at the big box retailers when they're on sale.
i custom build because i'm constantly upgrading components.
ymmv.
