I just purchased an Acer Aspire M3300-U1332 computer.
The specs include AMD Phenom II X4 810 2.60GHz processor 6GB DDR3 1066 memory 1 TB SATA hard drive integrated ATI Radeon HD 3200 graphics card VGA and HDMI monitor ports two 5.25 inch bays three 3.5 inch bays Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit OS one DVDRW optical drive 300 watt PSU I bought this on the spur of the moment because I thought I was getting a good deal at $500 with no tax and free shipping.
However, no disks came with it.
So my question is &quot;Do you think this really is a good deal or should I exchange it before the 30-day period expires for something with a better reputation for quality, reliability and customer service.&quot; Thank you.
