that thing is from 2001. wally-mart...400 bucks....10x the machine.
if the user insist on keeping the machine.
consider a ram upgrade.
waste of money in my opinion...but it might make the user happy.
hp says that machine comes with 128mb of ram with a max of 768mb.
if the user is running w98 bump the ram to 256. if the user is running xp bump the ram to the max.
