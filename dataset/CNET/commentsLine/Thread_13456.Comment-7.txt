since you are looking at motherboards to go with, also look at what gigabyte has to offer, i don't have a problem with amd processors in desktop builds, though i prefer intel.
you didn't mention whether you were going to go with for a psu, that is definitely a consideration, dvd drive shouldn't be an issue and hopefully neither should the vid ram.
the other basics, ram, etc.
should be at least adequate for your intended purposes.
