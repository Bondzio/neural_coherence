i have exactly the same problem as this and is connected in the same way, i have a degree in networking, and cant resolve this problem, im thinking it must be a fault with the product and will have to contact netgear.
before this however, i will try to login using a different ip address; 192.168.0.1 as opposed to the 192.168.0.2 as it says in the manual.
if anyone else had this problem can you tell me what you did to resolve it??
