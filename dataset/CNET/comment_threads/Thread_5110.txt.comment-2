I am no pro by a long shot.
But I think it would just be the sensible thing to do to shut down during the night.
I run mine all day partly because I use System Mechanic for many things and it runs in the background or when I am away from the PC...it checks the registry, drivers etc.etc.
and I seldom have problems.
Also I don't open a lot of different programs at once only what I need for whatever I am working on at the time.
