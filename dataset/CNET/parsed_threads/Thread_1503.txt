<s> I have 2 computers running Windows XP. </s>
<s> One is Pro, one is home. </s>
<s> Trying to set up your usual file / printer sharing...simple nothing advanced... they are on the same network..at&t uverse router.... the problem I am having is that they simply do not see each other... </s>
<s> I have enabled sharing on both computers, I have set them on the same Workgroup, firewalls are off, and I used the network setup wizard to setup both with the same options. </s>
<s> Now usually this has worked for me on just about every computer I have worked on in the past.. for some reason, it won't work on these 2. when I go to &quot;add network place&quot; and input the local IP's, it just says &quot;the folder you entered does not appear to be valid. </s>
<s> please choose another&quot;. </s>
<s> when I navigate to the workgroup in my network places, neither computer sees the other one. </s>
<s> I am able to ping them through CMD.. so I know it is not a hardware problem... </s>
<s> It was working fine until I sent one of the computers out to have some spyware removed, when it got back I started having this issue... Could it be that something was deleted along with the spyware, which is keeping that computer from having the ability to be on a network? </s>
<s> any ideas? </s>

<s> First thing to do is to make sure they see each other on the same workgroup. </s>
<s> I'm assuming you pinged both ways. </s>
<s> Try changing to another workgroup name. </s>
<s> If they still can't see each other, I would reinstall the nic drivers and fix tcpip-- http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811259 . </s>
<s> Try this first on the computer that is suspect. </s>
<s> the following commands fixed my problem; Reset TCP/IP stack to installation defaults, type: netsh int ip reset reset.log Reset WINSOCK entries to installation defaults, type: netsh winsock reset catalog thank you for your help </s>
<s> Nice work! </s>
