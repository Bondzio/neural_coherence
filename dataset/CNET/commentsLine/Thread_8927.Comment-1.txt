my crt monitor just died; i've read that crt's are better for gaming in general because of color, resolution etc, and that there can be a lot of pixilation/shadows when playing fast paced games on an lcd.
i don't really play first person shooters or games that have a ton of fast movement; i do really love a lush, detailed picture with great resolution.
iwould get another crt, but the choices seem small in the larger (20 in or more) category.
if i got an lcd, would i be disappointed?
i'm willing to pay lcd prices if its worth it- sabine
