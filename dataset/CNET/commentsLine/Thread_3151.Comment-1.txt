some sage thoughts, please.
i have been looking at upgrading my pc.
it runs bioshock ok but jerks slightly, say, when doors open or characters appear on screen for duelling.
i upgraded to 2gb ram which was a marked improvement (wish i'd plumped for 1gb sticks instead of 4x512) and bought a second gpu for sli...which wasn't a marked improvement.
the pc is only a year old and i am dismayed at how fast the pace has moved on...939 board, 3200 ddr2...it will only be 'minimum requirement' for the upcoming crysis.
anyway...my research tells me that an amd 64 fx 57 is a pretty good chip (but is not dual core) and the asus site says that my mobo is compatible.
however fx 57 chips are as rare as hens teeth...and very expensive when tracked down.
the mobo is also amd x2 (dual core) compatible but my research tells me these chips run no better that 2.2ghz and are more suited to multi-tasking, not gaming.
is installing a new chip as straight forward as it seems?
am i getting my thoughts on this all wrong?
would even more ram speed things up?
should i consider clocking (i don't do this)?
is it time to buy that xbox 360 :-/ cooperm4n xp home amd athlon 64 (939) 3700 san diego (2.2ghz equivalent) 1mb cache asus a8n-sli se (sli enabled) dual ddr 2gb corsair ddr400 3200 160gb western bell sata hdd nvidia 7600gs 256mb pcie nvidia 7600gs 256mb pcie 500w pcu 120mm fan
