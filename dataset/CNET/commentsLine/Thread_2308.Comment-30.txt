well i don't have a usb keyboard and my motherboard has no ps/2 slots so i went to fry's electronics and purchased a female ps/2 to male usb adapter so that i could use my ps/2 keyboard with my machine via usb.
but when i plug it into the usb slot and press 'y' nothing happens.
num lock, caps lock, & scroll lock do not display their lit up led's so i'm assuming the machine isn't detecting the keyboard.
why is it not working?
