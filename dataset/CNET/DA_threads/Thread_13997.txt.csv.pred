1.1.1	Hello All I'm looking to purchase a 500 GB external hard drive to do backups.	St
1.1.2	My computer is Win XP SP3 with USB 2.0 ports.	St
1.1.3	I have Norton Ghost v 15.	St
1.1.4	I've researched and have seen both good and bad for both Seagate and WD drives.	St
1.1.5	Realizing individuals wants/needs/opinions are specific to an individual, I would like some feedback on what people think of the above manufacturers and the various drives they produce.	St
1.1.6	I'm leaning towards a Desktop external rather than a portable, just for the sake of the Desktop having a connection to a power supply that's not the computer.	St
1.1.7	This drive would be used once a week, explicitly for backing up the internal drive.	St
1.1.8	However, I am not adverse to purchasing 2 drives and doing a 'double' backup every week.	St
1.1.9	Any comments are appreciated.	Polite
1.1.10	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Given the choice of either Seagate or WD, I would choose WD every time without hesitation.	St
1.2.2	All three Seagate external drives I had failed within 9 months &amp; started behaving erratically well before that.	St
1.2.3	By contrast, my WD replacements have given me no trouble at all.	St
1.3.1	I have a WD Elements which I was suppose to use as a backup but got lazy and used it twice when visiting my brother in another state who would put movies etc on it.	St
1.3.2	Found on a the second trip I could not drag or copy anything off it.	St
1.3.3	Had I/O error had it checked and told it was not going to work.	St
1.3.4	My brother is advising me to get a 1t seagate passport as he thinks WD's are rubbish but I see the consensus is divided.	St
1.3.5	I have been looking at the WD My Book Elite 1t but I am so confused what to get.	St
1.3.6	I am not tech savvy just want to back pics and family history records.	St
1.3.7	thanks appreciate any advise	Polite
1.4.1	Maybe it's time to have one of each make?	St
