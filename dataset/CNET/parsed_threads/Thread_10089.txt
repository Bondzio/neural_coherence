<s> Pioneer DVR-107D v1.22 Firmware and &quot;Kernel&quot; Downloads? </s>
<s> by sugarbear246 - 8/25/10 10:51 PM I have a Pioneer DVD-RW DVR-107D--(DVD/CD Rom Drive) (Burner). </s>
<s> I AM TRYING TO UPDATE THE (FIRMWARE TO THE LATEST VERSION V1.22) I successfully downloaded the (Firmware) and KNOW THE COMMAND TO RUN AT THE:&quot;COMMAND PROMPT&quot;, AND I HAVE THE FIRMWARE DOWNLOADED AND INSTALLED IN THE (PROPER DIRECTORY TO RECEIVE MY COMMAND)! </s>
<s> GOT ONE PROBLEM THOUGH, THE COMMAND PROMPT TELL ME (I NEED THE &quot;KERNEL&quot; THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE FIRMWARE UPDATE, BUT I'LL BE DARNED IF I CAN FIND (&quot;WHERE TO DOWNLOAD (DVR-107d V.122 &quot;KERNEL&quot;? </s>
<s> Anybody out there got any ideas? </s>
<s> Boy what a Bummer! </s>
<s> Thanks; Sugarbear246 </s>
<s> But what's the goal here? </s>
<s> Reading posts like http://club.myce.com/f87/pioneer-dvr-107d-model-firmware-update-not-working-154907/ I wonder if you are trying the HACK THE DRIVE or just trying to save an old dead drive. </s>

<s> Thanks for your Reply! </s>
<s> Unfortunately; I have also Visited this Same Link and the Error Message I received is &quot;Target Not Found&quot;...When I tried to Install the Update? </s>
<s> I FIND THIS TO BE INTERESTING, SINCE THIS IS A DIRECT LINK TO A PIONEER WEB PAGE? </s>
<s> I did however find a link to a DVR-107D Firmware Update from a European Union web page that (INSTALLED WITHOUT A PROBLEM)! </s>
<s> Here is the Link I Found: http://www.techspot.com/drivers/driver/file/mirror/2669/ It beats me why Pioneer Firmware Updates in Europe would be different than those for the US? </s>
<s> NOW FOR THE REAL REASON I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO UPDATE THE FIRMWARE ON THIS DRIVE. </s>
<s> IT IS ALSO A &quot;BURNER&quot; AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REVIVE IT WITH THE FIRMWARE UPDATE. </s>
<s> THE TRUTH IS, THE DRIVE &quot;STILL DOES NOT BURN PROPERLY&quot;? </s>
<s> Looks as though No Firmware Update of any kind will revive this drive &quot;For Burning&quot; that is....It works fine for just playing a DVD! </s>
<s> Anyway, thats the skinny of it, I found my answer, but I found it in a manner I did not expect! </s>
<s> Hope this helps someone else! </s>

<s> I've watched folk try to revive dead burners with firmware. </s>
<s> The results seem to fade with each year the drive ages. </s>
<s> Good luck in finding the firmware but I've found that with each passing year there is less and less support and the files fade away. </s>
<s> Try a CD/DVD lens cleaner? </s>
