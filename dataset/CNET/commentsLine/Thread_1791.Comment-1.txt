i'm getting a new sata hd.
it is going to be my master.
what i want to know is that if i connect my older ide hd which has xp and my files on it, will i get any error from having two hd's with xp on it connected to the motherboard.
also will i have any problems transferring the files to my master sata.
thank you.
