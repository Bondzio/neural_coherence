a static discharge to the case should not cause this problem.
the hardware is obviously not installed correctly.
there shouldn't be any metal screws on the front of the case, but even so, it shouldn't cause this problem, unless something, the mb, is not installed properly.
i use the case to discharge static electricity all the time, without any problems.
take it back.
