just a quick update..... i bought new ram and installed it.
the computer is still rebooting.
i've been trying to avoid messing with the bios, but i guess i now have no choice.. here are the instructions on updating the bios from iwill's site, does that look right to you??
the last thing i want to do is mess up during the update and make matters worse.
thanks again!
