The iMac is connected wirelessly to my Airport Extreme. The macbook will be wireless as well. don't feel the Time Capsule is worth buying since I already have the Airport and don't want to pay for another router. Can I connect an external hard drive to the Airport and use it to backup both computers wirelessly? If so, would I need to partition an external drive to back up each one separately? Or are there ready-made options for backing up multiple computers wirelessly in this fashion? Thanks

All hard disks require at least one partition and if you want more or required more this would be dictated by the backup software and optional otherwise. Since you didn't share what backup software was being considered it's unlikely we can discuss this further. Bob

SuperDuper was recommended as a good backup program. But I'm not sure if I need to hardwire each computer to an external drive separately or if there is a good way to take advantage of my wirelss Airport network in backing up both computers to a single backup unit. It was suggested I would need to partition an external drive to backup the iMac and macbook separately on a single unit. I have approx 100MB of videos, pics, tunes and documents that I need to backup. Thanks for any advice.
