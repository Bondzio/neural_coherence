<s> I am running XP Professional on my Dell PC. </s>
<s> It's only a year old, and have recently downloaded the netscape 8 browser. </s>
<s> Every time I turn my PC on, I get lot's of pop-ups, and have been told by many friends to turn off internet explorer, because it does not have the pop up blockers built in like Netscape 8 , and the Firefox browsers. </s>
<s> Please Help!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> the newest version does, so i dont think its related to that. </s>
<s> download ad aware and scan for ad ware and do virus scans. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> or make netscape default? </s>
<s> if either of these are what your going for just ask and as for turning of IE, it's built into Windows you can't &quot;turn it off&quot; but you should do spyware scans if your getting a lot of pop-ups and ads </s>
<s> What you describe is exactly what can happen with Messenger. </s>
<s> Out of the blue, even with no browsers open, you will get pop-ups on your screen. </s>
<s> Go to my site below, scroll down to the Free Software link, and download one or both of two Messenger utilities. </s>
<s> One will disable messenger &quot;Mesenger Disable&quot;, the other will uninstall it, &quot;Shoot the Messenger&quot;. </s>
<s> If you like Messenger (I hate it) just disable it as it can be reenabled later. </s>
<s> I recommend uninstalling it. </s>

<s> Ok, Thanks for your help. </s>
