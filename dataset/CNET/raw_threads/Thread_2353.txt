I live in college apartment where the building provides internet access with one network jack in every room. In the living room we set up a Netgear wireless access point with DHCP turned on so all the hosts on that network have a private IP address (IE 192.168.1.5 ect... with a subnet of 255.255.255.0) In the bedroom we have a Netgear gigabit switch which has no web interface, it simply splits the bedrooms private IP address assigned by the apartment into 3 IP address (IE 172.17.105.68 for my roommates computer, 172.17.105.162 for my computer and 172.17.105.59 for my HP printer. They are on the subnet 255.255.252.0 ) The 172.17.105.___ is the block that my apartment uses. My problem is that I am trying to access the files on my PC in my room on the switch using my Mac in the living room with the wireless access point. How can I go about accessing these files without putting them online and being able to print from the wireless to the hosts on the switch? Thanks for any help.

You would need to learn a lot more about TCP/IP routing but the simple answer is no. But look up GOTOMYPC and similar for solutions that avoid learning about networking. Bob
