Here are the particulars: Main computer - HP using Vista Ultimate Cable modem from Comcast Linksys Router I've isolated the problem to the main computer, I can't get it to hook up to the internet at all. I can hook a second computer direct to the cable modem and it works fine. Even with the same ethernet wire, the main computer will not get the internet. I've tried all of the wizard fixes multiple times. It tells me I have limited connectivity only. Is it possible the ethernet card blew out? My other guess is something in the software will no longer recongnize networks. I'm basically at a loss. Any help much appreciated.

Option 2 Start in Safe Mode with &quot;Last Known Good Configuration&quot;. Your desktop will appear &quot;oversize&quot; on screen. That's normal. After everything is loaded - shut down your computer and restart normally (i.e. don't press &quot;F8 Key&quot;). Option 3 Start in Safe Mode with &quot;Networking&quot;. Your desktop will appear &quot;oversize&quot; on screen. That's normal. After everything is loaded - shut down your computer and restart normally (i.e. don't press &quot;F8 Key&quot;). NOTE FOR OPTIONS 2 & 3: To get into the Windows Vista Safe mode, as the computer is booting press and hold your &quot;F8 Key&quot; which should bring up the &quot;Windows Advanced Options Menu&quot;. If press and hold of your &quot;F8 Key&quot; doesn't work - start over and this time continue &quot;Tapping&quot; your &quot;F8 Key&quot; as the computer is booting which should bring up the &quot;Windows Advanced Options Menu&quot; Start Windows &quot;Normally&quot; is the default in this menu. Use your arrow keys to select the appropriate option and press enter.
