I found a bunch of stuff on how to install the drivers.
It looks pretty complicated though.
Not stuff I'm familiar with.
I'm going to give it a try in a few days.
It's a pain in the butt having to pull my graphics card out each time I want to boot Ubuntu.
Otherwise the system hangs up on boot.
I'm a single dad with 2 toddlers and my littlest one was diagnosed with pnuemonia today so I'm gonna just spend time with him and come back to it when he's healthy.
thank you.
sincerely, Steve
