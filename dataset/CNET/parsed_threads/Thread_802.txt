<s> A year ago, I tried upgrading RAM in my son's system, which has an EPOX 8KDA3J motherboard and an AMD64 processor, from .5GB to 1GB. </s>
<s> I called Kingston memory, and they gave me the number of a product they said would work. </s>
<s> However, when I installed it, the memory speed dropped from 200MHz to 166MHz. </s>
<s> I called Kingston again, and this time they said this motherboard can only handle 3 ranks of memory (aka ''sides'' or ''banks'') without problems, and they don't make anything larger than 256K in single rank. </s>
<s> I could not find any other manufacturers who did, although finding out is pretty hard since most manufacturers don't list this information in easy-to-find places. </s>
<s> I contacted EPOX, but they were not very helpful. </s>
<s> I decided to wait and see if more single-rank memory came on the market. </s>
<s> Finally, this past June, I decided to contact EPOX again and ask what memory they recommend to bring this board up to its advertised capacity of 3GB. </s>
<s> After a month of runaround, (e.g., ''check with Kingston and Crucial'' -- Kingston's largest is still 256K, and Crucial said they don't make any! </s>
<s> ), I sent EPOX a somewhat different reply. </s>
<s> Apparently they designed the motherboard around a memory format that does not exist. </s>
<s> I suggested that ethically they have an obligation to make sure their motherboards realistically work as advertised. </s>
<s> This could be by posting the names and model numbers of 1GB single-rank memory modules (the maximum the board's user manual says it can handle), by upgrading the bios and chipset, by swapping for a board that does not require single-rank memory, by giving instructions for overclocking, or anything else that makes the board work as advertised with memory that's actually on the market. </s>
<s> This was over two weeks ago, and so far EPOX has ignored my reply. </s>
<s> My son will be starting college next month. </s>
<s> Before he leaves I would really like to be confident his computer is working properly. </s>
<s> Can anyone advise me what I should do? </s>
<s> If I go to crucial and plug the above into their mem finder I seem to come up with more than a few choices. </s>
<s> Is their something unique about the mobo you have...like maybe a specific version number? </s>
<s> The Kingston site has 1GB sticsk that are compatible with your motherboard. </s>
<s> 1GB should be sufficient for your son's needs for a year or so. </s>
<s> Also, its not unusual for mobos to drop ddr-400 to ddr-333 speeds when completely filled. </s>
<s> (Usually its when 4 slots are filled, but since you only have 3 slots...) As for your mobo being designed for memory that doesn't exist... that's not unusual either. </s>
<s> the ddr-400 spec was really late -- it was finalized after ddr-400 sticks were already on the market. </s>
<s> also mobo manufacturers often try to anticipate future tech but the tech world changes so fast some of those predictions don't pan out. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tips. </s>
<s> Both Kingston and Crucial list their memory as being compatible, but (unless things have changed in the past week or two) both are double rank. </s>
<s> This means they will lower the speed. </s>
<s> EPOX won't even say this is to be expected but acceptable. </s>
<s> EPOX only says that the motherboard needs single-rank memory (three ranks max) to work properly with more than one stick. </s>
<s> If I understand ramarc's comment, he's implying that slowing down the memory is normal and I should not worry about it. </s>
<s> The system will just work at less than optimal performance, but since ''optimal'' is defined in relation to non-existant memory, this slower preformance is the real, rather than theoretical, optimum. </s>
<s> Is this correct? </s>
<s> Should I worry about using 4 ranks if I'm willing to accept slower speeds? </s>
<s> Is there any way to get a board such as this to perform at speeds comparable to its original design but using 4 ranks? </s>

<s> VAPCMD PS...Probably ought to make sure the MB BIOS is up to date too ... that often reduces RAM incompatability issues. </s>
