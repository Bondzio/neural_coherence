booting off the ubuntu live cd, it looks like i don't have any room to grow the partition.
i think the partition resizing process died right before the filesystem could be grown to fill the partition.
the screenshot above shows that gparted says the partition is 62.5 gib, but the system monitor says the file system is only 44.5 gb.
should i do something to grow the filesystem?
i'll be out of town for a week without access to the internet.
i'll get back on this when i'm back.
thanks again for the help so far, bob!
