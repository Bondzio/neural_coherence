first risk, if you install the wrong bios and don't recover in the same session, you are in for a major hassle of having someone redo the bios chip for you, (2 weeks, $50) during which time your motherboard will be non-functional two, if the power goes out in the middle of the process you are screwed a la risk #1. power failure, how likely?
not much.
just make sure you have the correct bios for your machine, and read the installation instructions very carefully .

my mistake on my first bios flash: when i typed in the dos commands i forget to put the .bin extension on the bios filename .

kept getting error messages til i figured it out.
