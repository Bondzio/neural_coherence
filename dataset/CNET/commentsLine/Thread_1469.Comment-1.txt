pc, xp pro sp 3 ethernet.
hp laptop w/intel pro wireless adapter working properly according to device manager.
the router has worked fine but now does not show any signs of working on the wireless side.
ethernet conncection works fine.
have posted on netgear website forum with no success.
have changed wireless settings per their suggestions.
i.e.
b&g mode, wpa/wpa2 encryption, or no encryption.
windows firewall enabled and using avast security.
again, the wireless has worked with all of the above.
all indicators on the unit show all is ok. is there a way to test the wireless function of the router?
also cannot connect from itouch.
thanks in advance.
