If you note in the upper left of the forum page the is a blank box with the word search next to it. Simply type in one of the phrases that Robert listed and click the search button.

11437	8	120675	1369279	1369147	R. Proffitt	8/18/05 7:59 PM	1.12439514E12	Yup.	With almost every forum there is a search box. Your question is a good one, but has been asked far too many times. To get fast answers, do try the forum search, look down the page at the very least and of course try google.com In closing, it's mostly caused by spyware damage. I wish your machine a speedy recovery. Bob
