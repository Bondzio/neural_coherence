3024	0	189252	2051374	NR	penny green	7/6/06 9:28 PM	1.15222128E12	Type of video card	Ordered a Desk top from Dell (dimension E310) and would like to upgrade the video card (to play battlefield 2). Does anyone know how I would find out what type of card I need or how to find out what type this PC needs? AGP or PCI? Short of opening the back and looking inside. The game requires as a minimum a NVIDIA GeForce FX 5700 or ATI Radeon 8500 or greater. My PC more than meets all the minimum requirements for the game, but not the video card

3024	2	189252	2052505	2051374	logger99	7/7/06 10:05 AM	1.1522667E12	uh, oh......................................	The E310 is an entry level type PC. Definitely not a gamer. Too little amount of RAM (only 512MB....XP needs that much, the integrated video is 128 SHARED memory), a midrange speed CPU and &quot;NO&quot; AGP or PCI Express 16x slot for a better graphics card. You'll have to find a PCI or an even more rare PCIe 1x graphics card for the system. You are restricted to the integrated ( Intel GMA 950 graphics of the 915G chipset) to the chip on the mobo.

3024	4	189252	2053873	2052746	penny green	7/7/06 10:41 PM	1.15231206E12	PCIe cards	The game calls for a ATI Radeon 8500 or greater. Is the Radeon X1300 512MB HyperMemory a &quot;greater&quot; card? Not up to speed on the video cards.
3024	5	189252	2054230	2053873	nathanpsz2	7/8/06 6:45 AM	1.1523411E12	The X1300 is greater but...	...you still won't be able to play at a high resolution with all the details turned on. Your best bet is to send the PC back and get one with a PCIe x16 slot, or build your own.
3024	6	189252	2065758	2051374	BradPois	7/12/06 4:52 PM	1.15272312E12	Hmm	I would recomend AGP or PCI-E but I have been hearing that your computer does not support AGP or PCI-E. I would say then to get the newest PCI card from either ATI or Nvidia or get an AGP card turned to PCI.
