<s> I'm looking to get a printer for my home, I know to get an inkjet printer. </s>
<s> I just don't know if I should get a printer with seperate color cartridges or an all in one. </s>
<s> And if I get an all in one, when one color goes out do I have to replace the whole thing? </s>
<s> I just want to know which would be the most cost effective. </s>
<s> Since I noticed some of the cartridges cost almost as much as the unit itself! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Have you ever heard about the marketing of razors and blades? </s>
<s> Same thing happens in printers. </s>
<s> But I prefer the separate colors. </s>

<s> I'm so very, very green. </s>
<s> I've had my lap top * days...there's just so much information out there. </s>
<s> It seems like the more I research The more confused I ge! </s>
<s> So If I get the seperate cartridges is there a way that I can refill them myself? </s>
<s> Ok, without the make, model of the printer I can't answer about color carts. </s>
<s> But in a nutshell just look at the offerings. </s>
<s> It will sink in quickly. </s>
<s> Refills? </s>
<s> Sorry, 2 decades of watching others try and I decided to never do that myself. </s>
<s> Instead I only print what I really really really (times infinity) need. </s>
<s> Big savings. </s>

<s> Thank-you..I'm off to Best Buy...Hopefully one day I might know more than where the keyboard is.. </s>
