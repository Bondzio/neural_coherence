And it looks amazing. The screen rotates 180degrees, the colour is really nice and it has a stylus as well. But what I want to know is - Is it a good laptop for a young business professional? And how much is it for? Any information on this laptop would be really helpful. Thanks

While I'm sure there is a market for tablet PCs that market has been attempted some dozen times with too many dead bodies of company to say that it's finally here. Initial reviews often write &quot;clunky&quot; when you see Windows Icon Mouse Pointer (WIMP) interfaces. For tablets it's different enough that you don't want WIMP. Bob
