1.1.1	Hi !	St
1.1.2	We have 2 Macs : an iBook G4 & an iMac G5 , both with PowerPC processors , and an Hp running Windows XP .	St
1.1.3	We have realized we need to backup information on all three computers , which is probably 300ish GB of storage ( not exactly sure ) .	St
1.1.4	Is it possible to use a single external hard drive to backup all three ?	Ques
1.1.5	We do n't have lots of time to spend and we want the process to be as simple and problem-free as possible so that we can easily update the hard drive with new files and get those files all easily off of the hard drive when we have problems .	St
1.1.6	Could someone please recommend a hard drive that might be a good choice for us ?	Ques
1.1.7	And what kind of software would you suggest we buy ( if it does n't come with the hard drive ) that will easily update the hard drive with new files ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Your answer may be 2 drives .	St
1.2.2	One for Mac and the other for the PC .	St
1.2.3	Let me state that most external drives fail the basic tests for backup on these 2 points .	St
1.2.4	1 .	St
1.2.5	Write protect switch .	St
1.2.6	Most drives do not have a switch that turns the drive into a read only device .	St
1.2.7	2 .	St
1.2.8	The second copy ( and third ) copy of the backup .	St
1.2.9	Since most will have just one drive and will be writing to it there is no assurance that the virus or worm wo n't wipe it all out .	St
