After sitting for and hour, the computer let me boot into Safe Mode.
It boots up, let me uninstall the drive, and I thought it would work, however, it didn't reinstall the drive when I booted into Windows.
Here is the answer to you questions: 1.
Yes.
That is how I knew the drive model, make, etc.
2.
I don't remember if it did.
I don't think it did.
I might just wait to get the thing fixed when we get a new computer.
