system, specifically the motherboard, is designed to run at max efficiency in the DUAL CHANNEL or 128bit mode.
You indicate having only 1 8GB DIMM which means your system is running in the slower 64bit, single channel mode.
To make the system work in the DUAL CHANNEL MODE....you need matching DIMMs, 2x4, 2x8, 4x4, 4x8 ....all same speed, same timing, same capacity, same mfg....usually a kit containing 2 or 4 matched DIMMs.
Personally I'd check that too to make sure the system is optimized too.
Re the GTX 760...I'd check with the mfg's tech support to see what they have to say too.
