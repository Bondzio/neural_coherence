<s> I want to edit my (boring) vacation and other VHS camcorder tapes into something more interesting and I'm going to buy a new computer and need to know, aside from a large hard drive and lots of ram what other features and software I need. </s>
<s> Not trying to be a pro, just have a little fun. </s>
<s> You will need some form of video capture device to transfer and convert the analog tapes into digital format. </s>
<s> Then some software to edit it. </s>
<s> Lots of choices out there, just type &quot;video capture&quot; into a google search. </s>
<s> Here's some combo that works. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The Haupaugge TV PCI capture card. </s>
<s> http://www.hauppauge.com/html/products.htm#pci The Go product is Mono, but does not matter since capture is from your audio card. </s>
<s> You can use it's capture software to get the first step done. </s>
<s> Less that 50 dollars. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> A DVD recorder with bundled software. </s>
<s> MANY out there, but a multi-format unit with Plus and Minus media support and DVD creation software (light video editing too) http://www.compgeeks.com/products.asp?cat=DVD#DVD%20ReWriters%20-%20Internal starts at 113 dollars. </s>
<s> Maybe a trip to Radio Shack for a cable, but unlikely. </s>
<s> The host machine for a 2 hour video will have about 20GB free during the work and even my older P3-600 with 256 MB or RAM could do the DVD creation overnight. </s>
<s> Even with more RAM and many more GHz of CPU, you still have to be patient. </s>
<s> Bottomline? </s>
<s> This is getting a lot cheaper. </s>

<s> Basically any TV-Tuner card will let you will let you hook up your VHS-VCR and import your home video into your PC. </s>
<s> I've used the ATI TV-Wonder PCI card to do this successfully. </s>
<s> Once you have the files you can open them in Windows Movie Maker 2 (free D/L from MS) and use it to edit and add special effects, add sound and music to create a fun and professional movie. </s>

<s> as I understand it I need 1. something to convert my VHS tape to a digital format to be understood by my computer. </s>
<s> One solution is the card mentioned ATI TV Wonder pci. </s>
<s> Another solution would be a converter like the one from Dazzle . </s>

<s> moderately priced computer would not come with such a card but might be purchased as an option. </s>
<s> Is Firewire needed for this connection? </s>
<s> The Dazzle 150 would need USB 2.0 which new machines note as Hi-Speed or USB 2.0. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I need software to edit the digitized home movie. </s>
<s> This may or may not come with a moderately priced ($1400) computer. </s>
<s> Is this software part of WindowsXP capabilities? </s>
<s> I don't care for the supplied Windows Movie Maker. </s>

<s> I need a DVD writer to put the digitized home movie on a DVD. </s>
<s> YES. </s>
<s> Just back from OfficeMax with a Multi-Format DVD record that will be 79USD after rebates. </s>
<s> Very good deal. </s>
<s> Haven't seen what software is bundled, but it will put out a DVD that will play on the common players. </s>
<s> So the price is down to: 118 USD. </s>

<s> Try something like the SONY VRD-VC10. </s>
<s> It's an MPEG2 encoder and DVD+-RW burner built-in. </s>
<s> All you need to do is hook up your VCR to it, and then put a DVD+R disc into the unit and start converting with the push of a button. </s>
<s> If you want to do edits, you can still use this unit (or the hundreds of others that can also dump your movie onto a computer), do your edits (I recommend VideoReDo, videoredo.com), then burn using a DVD burner or that same VRD-VC10 for example. </s>
<s> Alternatively, you can have your movies converted professionally. </s>
<s> There are many conversion shops to choose from. </s>
<s> http://www.homedvd.ca/ for example Cheers </s>
<s> My answer has changed as the Dazzle is not around anymore. </s>
<s> Why reply to such an old post? </s>
<s> Because this post is indexed in google and many people may be searching for tips on VHS to DVD conversion and hit an old thread with outdated info Happy? </s>
<s> Replying to very old threads usually elicits &quot;why?&quot; Other forums are indexed via google, so take care with randome replies. </s>

<s> I just purchased a video conversion device from altoedge.com and I am loving it. </s>
<s> I thought I would just add my 2 cents. </s>
