longhorn will require more than 512mb of ram.
i have never had &quot;any&quot; version of windows run smoothly with the minimum recommended ram.
i think ms must base their calculations on the premise that windows will be the &quot;only&quot; program installed on your computer.
-jdm (*btw, the people i've talked to about longhorn say that most of the good stuff will be under the hood.
that's nice to know, but it will be a tough sell for ms...people like what they can see.)
