<s> I'm a teacher and need to be able to use a keyboard while presenting information on the projector. </s>
<s> Sitting at a desk is stupid and impractical for me (I've got middle schoolers, folks! </s>
<s> ), and I was wondering what the effective range for wireless keyboards are. </s>
<s> More than likely I would go for a USB, but if a Bluetooth has better range (which common sense is telling it would), I could go that route. </s>
<s> Thank you for any and all input! </s>
<s> Regards, Darren Aho </s>
<s> I need a minimum of 30 feet of range, but the more the better! </s>
<s> 30ft is about the maximum range usually stated by RF wireless keyboards (my own Logitech can easily beat 20ft, and through walls!). </s>
<s> Mice RF range is far less (mine begins to get lost in the maze at about 8ft) though. </s>
<s> The main problem here is that Bluetooth range isn't any better with an effective range of....wait for it...32ft Which maybe means a careful and extended central position for the receiver would be required for either (oh, the logicalness of it all! </s>
<s> ; ) so you could walk around it, without going near either of the effective limits. </s>
<s> GeeBee. </s>
<s> That's good news! </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
