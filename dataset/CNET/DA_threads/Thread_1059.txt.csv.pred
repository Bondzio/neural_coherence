1.1.7	IPs it gives out to the devices connected to it are 192.168.1.xx .	St
1.1.8	The IP address of the DLINK is 192.168.0.1 and the range it gives out to devices are 192.168.0.xxx Is there a way to configure the routers and/or the devices to all exist on the same network ?	Ques

1.1.11	Thanks David	St
1.2.1	I would not have used the WAN port of the second router but you can google how by the following phrase .	St
1.2.2	& quot ; How to use a router as a WAP ? & quot ; Bob	Ques
1.3.1	Hi Bob , thanks for your reply .	Polite
1.3.2	I actually fixed it by doing what you said .	St
1.3.3	I unplugged the WAN port connection on the Dlink and put it in one of the LAN ports .	St
1.3.4	Now everything is talking together and on the same IP address range .	St
1.3.5	Thanks !	St
1.3.6	David	St
1.4.1	It 's a common network setup ( some call it a trick . )	St
1.4.2	But it 's something you keep on hand for those special setups .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Hi all I do n't suppose it is possible to do this via a wireless connection ?	Ques
1.5.2	I have a similar issue where I have my modem downstairs which is connected to the internet and also to the sky box via ethernet .	St
1.5.3	My laptop and phone are connected via wireless .	St
1.5.4	I also have a modem with an external hard drive plugged into the usb port upstairs which may also connect to my bluray player via ethernet .	St
1.5.5	Basically I want to be able to connect my wireless devices to the modem upstairs which in turn speaks to the modem downstairs so I can access the internet .	St
1.5.6	Is this possible ?	Ques
1.5.7	If someone could point me towards a tutorial that would be amazing , as you can see , my terminology is n't up to spec enough to know what to search for !	St
1.6.1	I would start a new post .	St
1.6.2	And how I solved that was to add a powerline network bridge and setup the other router as a WAP .	St
1.6.3	No new tech involved .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Ok , I 'll start it in a new thread , thanks for the advice	Polite
