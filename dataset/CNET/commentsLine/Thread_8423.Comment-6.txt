i have an usb floppy drive i carry just for such installs.
the issue of the needed floppy is well documented on many sites.
here's the words to find the answers on google.com how to install xp to a sata hard disk.
when you read a few of those you see answers from &quot;get the drive&quot; to &quot;slipstreaming sata drivers.&quot; this is not a bug in xp but just signs of aging.
