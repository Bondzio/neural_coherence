1.1.1	Hi , I am trying to install an old hard drive into my PC and every time I do the computer acts funny , it caused the battery in the motherboard to fail , and it stops other hard drives from working .	St
1.1.2	But when I uninstall it the computer returns to normal .	St
1.1.3	This hard drive has data on it that belongs to my dad , so I want to return it to him , but do n't want to cause serious damage to his PC .	St
1.1.4	The drive was put into an enclosure a while back , but it got damaged .	St
1.1.5	what I have tried I have changed the jumper settings to & quot ; Cable Select & quot ; which stopped the drive from interfering with my hard drive .	St
1.1.6	But this caused the battery on the motherboard to fail .	St
1.1.7	I tried changing the jumpers to & quot ; Slave & quot ; but the same issue continued .	St
1.1.8	The hard drive is a PATA drive , and the details for the drive are as follows : Manufacturer : ExcelStor Model : T880 I found details on the manufacturers website which advised on how to change the settings to the above stated .	St
1.1.9	As my dad wants the drive back and I ca n't currently afford a new enclosure I 'm hoping someone can give me some advice on what to try .	St
1.1.10	An important thing I forgot to mention is the drive had been installed in my old PC of which my dad now owns , the drive was set as master but it was n't set to boot as it 's just for storage not for the operating system .	St
1.2.1	Some NEVER work with other drives .	St
1.2.2	Since you ca n't afford an enclosure then why not use the second channel on the motherboard and forget about the CD/DVD drive until you get the files out ?	Ques
1.3.1	Hi , Thanks for that great idea , but unfortunately it did n't work , instead a screen came up telling me about what hardware is installed in my PC and the system halts .	St
1.3.2	Could there be a possibility that this issue is down to my PC rather than the drive , just like RAM working in one machine but not another ?	Ques
1.3.3	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	from the motherboard and try the drive in question by itself ... jumper as Cable Select .	St
1.4.2	You are using 80 wire 40 pin cable ... right ?	Ques
1.4.3	Is your CMOS battery fresh or is it old ?	Ques
1.4.4	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	Sorry but I only have the details you gave .	St
1.5.2	ANOTHER IDEA .	St
1.5.3	Put the drive back into the machine where it works and copy the files over your network .	St

1.6.1	Since you state the enclosure that this HD was installed in was damaged , then it suggest the HD could be damaged as well .	St
1.6.2	Not knowing what damage , you maybe seeing the result , causing other working PC to NOT be proper with it installed .	St
1.6.3	You know its doing something negative here .	St
1.6.4	I use AD-2020 adapter setup ( or others ) in order to test various drives w/o an enclose and if it does n't work , then I know any further attempts usually are n't going to be fruitful .	St
1.6.5	It appears your old HD is a goner or close to it provided everything is setup correctly .	St
1.6.6	Checkout : What happens when that HD is installed alone , then use the Ubuntu bootable Linux disc to then access it ?	Ques
1.6.7	Get the Ubuntu s/w .ISO file to make a bootable disc to test with .	St
1.6.8	This allows the CD drive to boot the current PC and then access the now & quot ; solo trouble HD & quot ; if at all possible .	St
1.6.9	If it does't boot or finding the HD did n't mount , suggest serious issues .	St
1.6.10	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
1.7.1	As to old PC install : Re-reading the post , I caught the last line of post .	St
1.7.2	The HD is & quot ; master & quot ; on what IDE Ch . ?	Ques
1.7.3	Plus , how can this boot as under normal setup , master is the boot device expected on primary Ch..	St
1.7.4	If on secondary Ch .	St
1.7.5	that too rises a ? , if it never was cleared of the OS , then the PC sees possibility 2 OSes installed , it maybe trying or already changed the & quot ; boot menu & quot ; and when installed elsewhere causing an issue .	St
1.7.6	All this on top of what I already posted plus what others have will pin-point the cause of problem ( s ) or fault .	St

1.8.1	http : //www.excelstor.com/uploadfile/PS9J001 % 20Rev % 20H % 20HDD % 20IG.pdf The above file should provide info on all or general info of 3.5 int .	St
1.8.2	PATA ( ATA ) drives , EIDE type .	St
1.8.3	FYI- This was abit harder to narrow support for , and its not as popular for int .	St
1.8.4	drives alone .	St
1.8.5	In other words , this maybe a PITA to fix or resolve .	St
1.8.6	You may want to cut losses short .	St
