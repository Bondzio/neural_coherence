<s> I have a USB 2.5&quot; extrnal case with a 120G Notebook Hard Disk, and powered from the USB port. </s>
<s> Intended for Notebooks/Laptops, are these external HDs suitable for use with a Desktop ? </s>
<s> They seem to work well. </s>
<s> There are 3.5&quot; models intended for the Desktop and these are powered off the wall socket. </s>
<s> I suppose these can be used for Notebooks/Laptops as well. </s>
<s> These external cases seems interchangeable for Laptop and Desktop. </s>
<s> Since both are being produced and sold, should a 2.5&quot; case only be used for Laptops and 3.5&quot; for Desktops only ? </s>
<s> What are the pros and cons of using these external drives for Desktops and laptops, apart from size and power source (portability) ? </s>
<s> Are there any other considerations, e.g. </s>
<s> safety (data loss, heat/fire, ) for chosing one over the other ? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> But as to data safety the one thing is it's a hard disk. </s>
<s> It's not permanent storage but a fine copy. </s>
<s> You'll see many posts here about lost data and the recurring lesson about backup. </s>

<s> The external drive (2.5&quot; case) draws its power from the USB port. </s>
<s> If your laptop is very low on battery power, there may be a problem during data transfer (loss of data), unless you are using a &quot;powered USB hub&quot;, or you are using power off a wall socket. </s>
