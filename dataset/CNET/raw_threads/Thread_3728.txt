The only battery that I'm aware of on a pc is the cmos battery on the motherboard. It's the shiny round object,about the size of a quarter, usually held in by some type of spring, on the motherboard. Carefully remove the old battery, being careful not to bend or damage the spring or clip. Take it to your nearest computer store, (Best Buy, Circuit City, or other) to get a replacement.

Before doing so, enter the bios area and make notes of what the setting are. Check your manual or upon boot-up if displayed what the &quot;bios key sequence&quot; is required to enter the bios area. Understand, once you replace the battery in all likeyhood, the bios will reset to default values, thus the reason note down what the previous values were. It should make sense once you delve into this. good luck -----Willy
