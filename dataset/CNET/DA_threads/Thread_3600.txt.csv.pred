1.1.1	I'm looking to upgrade my AMD processor but I am confused about what is compatible with this Motherboard.	St
1.1.2	Here is what I have: Compaq Presario SR1703WM Name AMD Sempron 3200+ Codename Palermo Specification AMD Sempron(tm) Processor 3200+ Package Socket 939 Chip set: Northbridge ATI Xpress 200 (RS480) rev.	St
1.1.3	10 Southbridge ATI SB400 rev.	St
1.1.4	00 Motherboard: Mainboard Model Amberine M (0x390 - 0x1DB08328) Can any point me in the right direction for a tool to help or recommend some AMD processors that I can use?	St
1.1.5	Thanks, Ken	St
1.2.1	Sadly there are very few 939 chips around.	St
1.2.2	Since you didn't reveal your country, research what 939 AMD chips you can obtain and then supply a list here.	St
1.2.3	NO DUAL CORE UNITS!	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the info.	St
1.3.2	I live in the USA.	St
1.3.3	Are you saying that any socket 939 will work on that Motherboard?	St
1.3.4	I did find one processor AMD-Athlon 64 Single Core 3500+ Processor-2.2GHz-34p1044 from a vendor.	St
1.3.5	It is a step up but if I can get a faster one that is compatible I'm open to that too.	St
1.3.6	This is a hand-me-down computer that I thought might make a good DVR but I do need at least 2.2 GHz to do the job from what Hauppage says.	St
1.3.7	Ken	St
1.4.1	That you should search for non-dual core socket 939s, put the list here for members to shoot down or give a thumbs up.	Sug
1.4.2	Sorry if I was unclear.	St
1.4.3	As to DVR, my old 1.0GHz Via C3 based computer does that work.	St
1.4.4	Why would I need more horsepower than that?	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Bob, OK I will search for the processors.	St
1.5.2	As to the DVR I was looking at the Hauppauge HVR 1250 card to process the cable signal and the tech said this: &quot;If that is a single core system then it is recommended to have a 2.2 GHz or higher anything lower can cause issues such as stuttering video.	St
1.5.3	If you have a good video card to pull some of the strain off the CPU then it could possibly work in that system but if not you will most likely experience some issues.&quot; This is digital and analog capable, but I could go down to just analog since I will be recording off my cable.	St
1.5.4	Compaq has integrated video processor which is crap.	St
1.5.5	I'm all ears if you have a better plan.	St
1.5.6	Thanks again, Ken	St
1.6.1	OK, here is a list I was able to compile.	St
1.6.2	Does it matter if I upgrade to Athlon and not Sempron?	St
1.6.3	AMD Athlon 64 3800+ 2.40GHz Processor $30 AMD Athlon 64 4000+ 2.6GHz 512KB L2 Cache Socket AM2 62W Single-Core Processor AMD Athlon LE-1600 (ADH1600DHBOX) 2.2GHz AMD Athlon LE-1620 (ADH1620DHBOX) 2.4GHz $53 AMD Sempron LE-1300 (SDH1300DPBOX)2.3GHz $39 AMD Sempron LE-1250 (SDH1250DPBOX)2.2GHZ $29 AMD Athlon LE-1640 (ADH1640DPBOX) 2.6GHz $38 I think these are all 939 sockets but they also call them AMD2 sockets?	St
1.6.4	I hope you all have some answers for me.	St
1.6.5	Thanks, Ken	St
1.7.1	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_939 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_AM2 Strip your list to just 939 single core units.	St
1.7.2	Bob	St
1.8.1	your mind is made up on getting the 1250, why shop for a CPU before you have tried it in your PC?	St
1.8.2	Some things in life are better when serialized.	St
1.9.1	I agree.	St
1.9.2	TRY the 1250 before you decide a new CPU is required.	St
1.9.3	Most of my DVR speed is all about the hard disk and not the CPU.	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	Good point.	St
1.10.2	That is what I most likely will do, try the HVR 1250 first but at least I have some idea of what processor upgrade I can use if needed and they don't seem to be expensive.	St
1.10.3	The options are not a big jump in speed either 2.2 or 2.4 GHz.	St
1.10.4	What is confusing is socket 939 vs what the AMD site lists sockets AM, AM2 and another one.	St
1.10.5	I wish terms were consistant across the board.	St
1.10.6	Thanks again for the advice.	St
1.10.7	I've bookmarked the wiki links you provided and I will read more.	St
1.10.8	Ken	St
