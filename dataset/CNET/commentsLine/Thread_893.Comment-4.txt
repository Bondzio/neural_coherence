i find that a benchmark that isn't exactly for one card may be close enough.
can't help but comment that after comparing some thousand cards over the years i've learned to take the 512mb numbers when there are no 1gb numbers.
it will be close enough to help the decision.
since you didn't share the benchmarks all i can write is that either are fine choices.
better than the card i used and i was happy with that one.
remember these are all volunteer forums so supply details when you can.
