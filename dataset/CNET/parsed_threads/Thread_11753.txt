<s> Does anyone on this site have any news about Windows8 mobile devices (phones or tablets) coming to market anytime soon? </s>
<s> I recently started a software development company, in partnership with my brother and father. </s>
<s> We primarily develop Windows Apps. </s>
<s> We are currently looking into the possibility of moving towards being able to offer our potential clients mobile apps. </s>
<s> As such, we are exploring which mobile platform will be most beneficial for us to learn how to develop in.So, our question is, which mobile platform (iOS, Android, Windows) will grow the most in the next twelve months?Also, would it truly be easier to integrate a Windows (desktop) app with a Windows (mobile) counterpart (as common sense would dictate), or would it be just as difficult an integration process, regardless of the mobile platform we choose?Any insight or advice on this issue would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance. </s>
<s> Windows 8 is NOT for phones... </s>
<s> If you want to program in similar way, use Windows Phone 7.5. </s>
<s> Win8 is only for tablets or computers (it works without touchscreen too!). </s>
<s> No phone would support it... it needs 1 GB of RAM and A LOT of memory (it's not much for PCs, but it's huge amounts for phones). </s>
<s> And also, metro style applications for Windows 8 require big resolution to run, i think it's 1024x768 or something like that... (also not big for PCs but huge for phones) For growing... Now Android is growing faster than any onther OS, but i think when Windows 8 will be released, the Metro Style will become more popular and people will start buying Windows Phone, especially older people because it'll be easier to learn how to use it if you have a PC with win8. </s>
<s> And if you develop games, iOS is the best platform for that That's my advice it's your choice </s>
<s> will be the fastest growing since it is new and hold 0% of the market since it's not released yet. </s>
<s> The best is to develop in Android, IOS and Windows 8 then you get all markets. </s>
