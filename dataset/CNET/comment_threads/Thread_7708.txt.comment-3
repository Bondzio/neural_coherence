As the other poster listed, get KILLDISK from thier website.
http://www.killdisk.com Use the &quot;free&quot; floppy or .ISO version to burn to CD.
Once done, use it and it does 1 pass removal, run again as a final pass(you have to reload it again) and you're done.
You can reformat before its usage if you care to but not required.
Read thier webpage info, its interesting if anything and it does the job, simple and easy, no thoughts about it.
