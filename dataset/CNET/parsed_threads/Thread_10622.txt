<s> I accidentally posted this question in another thread and didn't know I had to create a new thread. </s>
<s> Sorry! </s>
<s> Anyways.....I have some basic questions concerning the WGR614v6. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> On the Netgear router, is the internet symbol supposed to be on all the time and not flashing? </s>
<s> Im not really having any issues getting online, but I noticed that this symbol blinks rapidly all the time and does not stay constantly on. </s>
<s> Also, I just noticed my wireless logo is going in and out but Im still connected and have not been dropped. </s>
<s> It stays on when Im not online, but when I open a web page it flickers as well. </s>
<s> Also another annoyance which the support people could not figure out is that Im constantly at a Good 60% connection. </s>
<s> When I move around or switch rooms my signal does not move up or down the 60% connection. </s>
<s> I can be inches away or yards away and it stays at the 60% mark. </s>
<s> I have no cordless phones but I do have a baby monitor. </s>
<s> However, I turned that off and Im still at 60%. </s>
<s> Again I dont have any drop issues but would like to have the best possible connection. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> I use Comcast and a D-Link modem. </s>

<s> when you go to any website, the lights will blink on the router, this is normal. </s>
<s> Second thing, the wireless router you have, go to their website and download and install the latest firmware. </s>
<s> Most routers come with out dated firmware. </s>
<s> The latest firmware helps to keep you connected. </s>
<s> Third thing, set up WPA security for your wireless router. </s>
<s> This also helps to keep you connected and keeps leaches off your internet connection. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I have the latest firmware My security is set up and pass protected Just curious on how I can achieve a 100% strong signal. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> It's dead Jim. </s>
<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=242736&messageID=2457489 Or you can skip to the end and read my advice. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Use WPA 2. </s>
<s> NEVER disable SSID broadcast. </s>
<s> About 100% links. </s>
<s> So far there is no technology that does that except wired connections. </s>
<s> It is normal to get less than 100%. </s>
