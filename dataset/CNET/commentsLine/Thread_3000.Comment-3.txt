i think you answered you're own question, &quot;a new cheap x-link internal 56k modem&quot;.
if it has no speaker then the drivers or the vendors s/w has to route any sound output to the system.
the at cmds.
apply to the physical modem and usually not to the system.
you need to find some s/w from some 3rd party(i don't know of any) if any as an solution.
but since this is new, return to the vendor and get a different one w/speaker.
if you haven't already, check the x-link support website for hints/tips in that regard.
to be honest, i never heard of x-link brand, but then many a vendor comes along &quot;rebranding&quot; a popular chipset and sell as thier own.
that maybe a hint in following the chipset and see if a cure if available.
