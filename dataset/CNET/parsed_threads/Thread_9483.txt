<s> I have a portable hard drive that I would like to change from Fat 32 to NTFS. </s>
<s> Can this be done.It is a Passport Western Digital 160GB but unfortunately has pre installed software for synchronising with OS. </s>
<s> Windows XP and Vista offer such conversion and there are other free sync softwares like SYNCBACK available. </s>
<s> Be sure this is not your only backup copy. </s>
<s> The forum is littered with questions about how to restore from such backups. </s>
