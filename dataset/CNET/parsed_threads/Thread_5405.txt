<s> I have a VCR/DVD with a hard drive built in. </s>
<s> I would like to clone the original to a larger hard drive and don't think this can be done from a computer. </s>
<s> Is there cloning devices that will work outside the computer such as a power source with the cables for transfering info? </s>
<s> Thanks, Steve </s>
<s> Most systems like that use a hard disk &quot;saint&quot; procedure that is specific to the make/model of the HD based recorder. </s>
<s> Since you didn't name the make/model you disabled us from looking to see if such a procedure was known. </s>

<s> The machine I have (VHS/DVD/Hard Drive)is a JVC DR-MX1, I have not opened it yet to find out what kind of hard drive it has. </s>
<s> If need be, I will open the case. </s>
<s> Just let me know. </s>
<s> You'll have to decide if you want to take a chance. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Until I open the case, is there any inexpensive ways to clone a hard drive outside the computer?? </s>
<s> Steve </s>
<s> But remember that my definition of inexpensive is a PC and google.com information. </s>
<s> Expensive is paying someone to do all that. </s>
