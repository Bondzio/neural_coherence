I just recently bought a new video card, an ATI Radeon 9250 256mb AGP card.
My old card was an ATI Radeon 7200 64mb AGP card.
When I went to switch them out my computer didn't recognize the new one yet it still runs fine with the old one.
Basically my monitor never recieves a signal and it gives me the error sound of a long beep followed by 2 short beeps.
I hooked the card up to another older computer running a Nvidia GeForce PCI card and it booted up fine.
The old computer is 5 years older than mine.
I've tried everything I can think of and I'm stumped.
Any help would be appreciated.
