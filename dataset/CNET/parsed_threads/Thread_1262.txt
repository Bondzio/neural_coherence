<s> If this doesn't belong here, I guess it can always be moved. </s>
<s> Anyway, my question is about the durability of disc, at least the ability to withstand extreme temperature. </s>
<s> I get discs from an online rental service and when some, I put them in the mailbox overnight in order not the miss the mail carrier when they come. </s>
<s> Now since I live in the middle of nowhere, theft is not an issue. </s>
<s> My concern is with temperature. </s>
<s> Here in the south, it can get down to about 40 degrees at night. </s>
<s> Is this safe for these discs sitting in a standard US mailbox? </s>
<s> And without condensation it is considered just fine. </s>
<s> There is an aging issue but I won't dive into that here. </s>
