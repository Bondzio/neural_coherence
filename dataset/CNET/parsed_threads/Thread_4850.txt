<s> I used a CD disc cleaner,the ones with the little brush on the underside,and now it will not read any CD's whatsoever,but it will still play DVD's?PLEASE HELP </s>
<s> Seen such... We swap the drive out and move that unit to the pile of the dead. </s>
<s> I'm seeing DVD all format recorders fall to under 50 bucks so it's not that big a repair bill. </s>

<s> The use of CD drive cleaners are not encouraged. </s>
<s> During the cleaning process, that one small plastic or cloth strip (that breaks in multiple strips after use) pushes the lens reader of the CD drive. </s>
<s> In such process, there are times that the strip mis-aligns the lens alignment, hence, you will get a disc reading problem. </s>
<s> Lens alignment is expensive and it could only be done by using a lens alignment/lens distance measuring device. </s>
<s> The lens does not get so much dirt (unless you are working in a fabric company that some fabrics go into the lens) since it does not touch anything during the reading process. </s>
<s> Only the IR LED does the reading. </s>
