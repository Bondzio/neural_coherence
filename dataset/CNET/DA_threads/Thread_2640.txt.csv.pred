1.1.1	Sharing a broadband connection?	St
1.1.2	Suppose my Win XP pc is connected to ADSL broadband.	St
1.1.3	My wife buys a laptop and wishes to share the connection, but is not intrested in a home network.	St
1.1.4	I am aware that each machine could be configured to this ISP, and could take turns at using the broadband service by simply disconnecting one from the modem, and connecting the other in its place.	St
1.1.5	Is it possible to obtain an additional IP address from the ISP, so that the laptop, using a separate modem, could be used simultaneously, from a splitter in the ADSL copper line?	St
1.1.6	I know how to use a router or Win ICS and a ''gateway'', but this a theoretical question with the object of avoiding additional hardware purchase.	St
1.2.1	Just get the router and don't tell anyone it's a network.	St
1.2.2	Heck, I don't even tell some that the Internet is a network.	St
1.2.3	Ok, I lied a little.	St
1.2.4	At my home, there are 2 DSL lines.	St
1.2.5	They do that in newer tracts for the future.	Ques
1.2.6	You can activate both here and connect a DSL modem to each.	St
1.2.7	It runs 2X the price of one line.	St
1.2.8	And believe it or not is a network connection to the Internet.	St

1.3.1	Bob, I actually have a home network using a Cat5 crossover, and using MS ICS, and this does all I require.	St
1.3.2	It is a friend who recently connected to broadband, and her husband complains that she now hogs their computer.	St
1.3.3	So he asked me, if he buys a laptop, could he share the ADSL connection, using a simple splitter, and without buying more hardware.	St
1.3.4	I told him that I had heard of additional IP addresses provided by some ISPs, probably not free.	St
1.4.1	You've hit the nail on the head - every computer connected to the internet must have a unique IP address, sort of like your home address - without your own house number and street (or rural box), the postal carrier wouldn't know where to deliver your advertisements and bills (now wouldn't that be nice;-) ).	St
1.4.2	The notion of a simple split cable (or plug-together connector) does not work for internet service.	St
1.4.3	There has to be some means of issuing and controlling unique addresses for each computer.	St
1.4.4	Typically that is managed either by a broadband router device installed immediately behind the cable or ADSL modem, with all the internal computers connected to it; or by software running on the first computer connected to the modem with all the other internal computers connected to that first one (such as your configuration with MS ICS).	St
1.4.5	Note that some newer ADSL modems have routing capability built into them so the modem by itself can logically support numerous internal computers using just the one public IP address issued by the ISP, but the got'cha is that the modem manufacturers don't put more than one output jack on the back of the modem so you can only connect one physical device to it.	St
1.4.6	The way around that is to buy a simple 4-port ethernet switch ($20) and then the modem connects to one of the switch ports leaving three available physical connections for computers.	St
1.4.7	However, before getting too excited about this simple solution, you must be certain that your friend's ADSL modem is capable of this - if you aren't sure how to diagnose this in the field, just get us the exact brand and model number of the modem and the name of the ISP and somebody here can look up the specs on the manufacturer's website and tell you if that modem is a likely candidate.	St
1.4.8	If not, then the next best solution is a common broadband router.	St
