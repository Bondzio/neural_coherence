<s> I don't know what the proper terminology is, but the router is &quot;sending&quot; multiple MAC addresses to my ISP. </s>
<s> Let me explain: I can log only one MAC address at time. </s>
<s> So I changed my MAC address of the router to match that of the computer so that the ISP connection would be 'fooled' into thinking it was the same machine. </s>
<s> However, after I use the internet through the router for a few minutes, my connection is terminating because my 'port has multiple MAC addresses.' </s>
<s> I can try using it as an access point, but i have trouble establishing an IP. </s>
<s> (the ISP already has DCHP) Help!! </s>
<s> This is weird.... </s>
<s> of the MAC address. </s>
<s> If not you should turn it off. </s>
<s> could having duplicate MACs cause things to run askew? </s>
<s> had the same name and street address, where would your mail go? </s>
<s> haha nice metaphor!! </s>
<s> I'm going to try it, i thought you are right, i never thought of it that way....thanks a lot! </s>
