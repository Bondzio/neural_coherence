If you show 2, HT is enabled and recognized. ASUS boards come with a nice manual. They have several pages on BIOS configuration. The book should contain this. If you have not manual, they can be found and downloaded on the ASUS site. On my ASUS board, the HT setting is under Advanced/CPU configuration. See if you have anything like this.

If you have a HT enabled CPU, and have either XP pro or XP home with sp1 slippstreamed into the distorbution media, then HT worked fine for me. I got in a older HP media cenetr PC that was stripped except for the cpu and MoBo. Three finger csalute the machine and see how many CPUs taskmanager sees. If that doesn't work I will look in the Bios.
