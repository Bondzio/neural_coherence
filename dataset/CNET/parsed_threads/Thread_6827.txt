<s> Hi, Can someone explain to me in very layman terms what IPv6 is and how I can use/get it? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> It's going to be a long time to get this out. </s>
<s> Here's the article about it but for most folk, it's a non-starter as no common internet service uses it. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6 So unless you are doing research and willing to setup your own server and lose months of time, I suggest you forget about it. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob... </s>
<s> In the article it doesn't say if it will be any faster. </s>
<s> Will it? </s>
<s> I guess if you want to be very picky it will be slower since you must transfer more bytes to obtain the same information. </s>
<s> The best way to think of this is that it is just a different name for your computer. </s>
<s> It does not have any affect at all on the way data is sent between machines or the way applications process the data. </s>
<s> The key benefit to IPV6 is that there are more internet routable IP addresses. </s>
<s> The key reason that not much has happened with IPV6 is that the vast majority of people do not even need the one IP address their ISP gives them now. </s>
<s> NAT along with the ability of servers to share IP with DNS tricks has kept IPV6 on the sidelines so far. </s>
