Hi Everybody, I have got a bluetooth print server (Nortek, BT 500).
The user manual doesn't contain pairing code.
(The serial number or the MAC address doesn't work!
The manufacturer's WEB page also doesn't work: www.nortekonline.com ) I've tried the following codes: BT500 NORTEK 1A N44066-00054 (serial number) N44066-000541A (serial number end two past char at the box) 0000 00000 00054 44066 N44066 0003C9 72BA1C (MAC address) 0003C9 72BA1C 0003C972BA1C 12345 ADMIN etc.
Any idea?
Thanks, Sandorh
