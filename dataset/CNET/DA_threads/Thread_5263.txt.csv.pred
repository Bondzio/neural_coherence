1.1.1	I 'm running XP SP2 on a hp pavilion .	St
1.1.2	I have recently upgraded the RAM from 256MHz to 1GHz .	St
1.1.3	Since I have done this I occasionaly ( but regular enough to be now getting on my nerves ) find XP shutting down , restarting and filing an error report as & quot ; the system has recovered from a serious error & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	Microsoft reports that it is a device driver that has caused the problem but can be no more specific about which one .	St
1.1.5	As the only hardware I have changed recently is the RAM , I can only assume this is the cause .	St
1.1.6	To complicate things a little the replacement RAM is 2nd hand but is in good working order ( PC2100 266DDR ) .	St
1.1.7	It is by the same manufacturer as the original , but I do n't know who that is ! !	St
1.1.8	The logo is a rounded letter M circled by a planet-style ring .	St
1.1.9	1 ) Does RAM require a driver ?	Ques
1.1.10	2 ) Who is the manufacturer of my RAM ?	Ques
1.1.11	3 ) Am I barking up the wrong tree ?	Ques
1.1.12	I have n't lost any work yet , but it ca n't be long .	St
1.1.13	Any advice would be much appreciated .	Polite
1.1.14	nossy	St
1.2.1	First , you said you upgraded from 256Mb to 1Gb , but you did n't state the configuration of the modules ie .	St
1.2.2	1x512 and 2x256 .	St
1.2.3	You also stated that the ram is in good working order .	St
1.2.4	At this stage I 'm not entirely sure we can make that determination .	St
1.2.5	You 're problemis definitely symtomatic of bad ram , but do n't panic yet , it may just be an installation problem .	St
1.2.6	The first thing to try , is to reseat the ram ( assuming of course you feel competent enough to do this , and making sure you 're grounded from static by touching the chasis of the computer while it 's plugged into the wall and not running ) often newly installed ram can be seated a little off and cause problems due to a poor connection , it happens to the best of us .	St
1.2.7	The other thing to try is to switch dimm slots on the board if you reseat in the original slot and the problem persists .	St
1.2.8	It may just be that slot does n't like that chip but would work fine with other chips .	St
1.2.9	It 's a pavillion , so it does n't have a high end motherboard in it .	St
1.2.10	Last but not least , to test the memory , go to http : //www.memtest86.com/ and download the floppy of bootable cd version of this free tool ( the standard in the industry amongst techs ) and it 'll run when you boot the computer with the disk in .	St
1.2.11	Most of it may look like greek to you , but what you 're looking for is in the bottom potion of the left hand side of the screen ... badmem= ( hex value here ) hex value being an address on one or more of the modules you have installed .	St
1.2.12	Note : If you have more than one module installed , I recommend testing each one individually to determine the culprit if the initial test shows bad memory addresses .	St
1.2.13	To answer your question ... no ram does n't need drivers , no you 're not barking up the wrong tree , and please post back if the bios is correctly identifying the amount of installed ram .	St
1.2.14	Have a great day !	St
1.3.1	Your last question was who manufactured the ram ... ... ... http : //www.micron.com/	St
1.4.1	An easy and fast test is to remove the new ram you just installed and find out if the problem is still there.As you said this issue started after the upgrade .	St
1.5.1	Remove the new ram and see if things settle down .	St
1.5.2	If they do , it suggest one of two areas to look into : the power may not be enough to run all ram -OR- the ram is defective .	St
1.5.3	You can also , remove the old ram and install the new alone and see how the system reacts .	St
1.5.4	If it seems OK , install the old ram *after* the new ram in the slots .	St
1.5.5	Last , sometimes , some mtrbds .	St
1.5.6	just do n't like all slots populated , it may offer a reason under its specs sheet , but consider that the CAS rating do n't match .	St
1.5.7	Offhand , your logo does n't ring a bell at the moment .	St
1.5.8	Google for this pgm .	St
1.5.9	Everest Home Edition by Lavalys .	St
1.5.10	Its system status report pgm .	St
1.5.11	that shows what you really got and for you what ram sticks report as .	St
1.5.12	If they differ too much not a good match , but if your system allows you to tweak the ram setting , go for a safe or lower setting for now and see how it reacts .	St
1.5.13	Otherwise , the ram maybe good but not a good match for your system with *all & quot ; ram present .	St
1.5.14	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	The RAM is 2 X 512MB .	St
1.6.2	I 've gone straight for swaping the slots and being as sure as I can be that they are seated properly .	St
1.6.3	I 'll leave it a couple of days to see if the problem manifests itself again .	St
1.6.4	I 've also obtained the memtest86 boot floppy you suggest in case I need it .	St
1.6.5	I 'll use it anyway to see what it does .	St
1.6.6	Thanks for your advice , and I 'll let you know if it works .	St
1.7.1	Will do if initial steps are not successful .	St
1.8.1	Thanks for your suggestions .	Polite
1.8.2	Will be trying them if initial steps do n't work out .	St
1.8.3	I downloaded Everest Home Edition , looks useful , and it is identifying 2 slots occuppied by 512MB SDRAM .	St
1.8.4	So that 's promising at the moment .	St
