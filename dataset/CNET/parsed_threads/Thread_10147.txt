<s> Now my new motherboard doesn't have a AGP slot only, PCI and PCI Express. </s>
<s> The problem is that the FX5500 doesn't physically fit into the PCI slots, it's too long. </s>
<s> I planning on buying a new video card for the new motherboard, but how will I know what card will physically fit into the slots? </s>
<s> why not buy a PCI express video card? </s>
<s> There are numerous to choose from. </s>
<s> That's what I was plannin on getting, but will all PCIe cards fit in all PCIe slots? </s>
<s> just make sure it is pci express x16 gfx card. </s>
<s> there are some that can fit in pci express x1 made by matrox. </s>
<s> If you could tell us that, we could get you a perfect match for your motherboard.. </s>
