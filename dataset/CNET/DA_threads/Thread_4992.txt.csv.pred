1.1.1	Hi I would like to know what is WD40 , sorry I am from Mexico maybe it is aproduct i do n't know .	St
1.2.1	Can get it in any hardware store .	St
1.2.2	A very common product .	St
1.3.1	The 40 is how many attempts they tried before this final formula .	St
1.3.2	True fact .	St
1.3.3	I forget what the WD stands for .	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	WD40 , is an oil based product commonly used to prevent rust or simple lubrication like hindges , bolts , sliding parts , etc..	St
1.5.2	Similar products are LPV , Marvel oil , CRC , or Liquid Wrench .	St
1.5.3	FYI -Orginally used to prevent rust on Atlas rockets/parts in storage .	St
1.5.4	Hope this helps ... -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	I am sorry my friend , but WD40 does not prevent rusts but it does help in slowing down rust formation .	St
1.6.2	Metals by nature rusts , especially iron .	St
1.6.3	WD40 adheres to the surface but not within ( deep penetration action ) .	St
1.6.4	The surface may not have rust on it , but how about the inside .	St
1.6.5	WD40 in layman 's term is a lubricant , especially created or manufactured through research to remove the squeaking sound ( but not always ) from stucked or rusted door hinges or any assembly thereto .	St
1.6.6	It also helps in un-bolting stucked bolts and nuts , helps dries up wet car distributors , etc.. WD40 became so popular that many car owners and people fond of doing some fixing have it .	St
1.6.7	There is one brand though better than WD40 , and they claim that they are the only ones approved by NASA in lubricating the Space Shuttle program carrier though more expensive .	St
1.6.8	I do not want to name the brand though else , I might be mistaken for advertising .	St
1.7.1	I stand by my orginal post ... Long before became WD40 popular it was used as a rust preventor or & quot ; inhibiter & quot ; on stored rocket parts .	St
1.7.2	Since these parts were and since usually a one time use , it became important to maintain thier integerty .	St
1.7.3	It also did n't attack common componets at the time and upon evaporating its reside was n't harmful or became a problem .	St
1.7.4	It 's use became so popular amongest the engineers it was later developed as it has become known for private use .	St
1.7.5	Its orginal use was n't as a lubricant but as I stated .	St
1.7.6	Of course it has became a multi-purpose use since , whether it orginal chemical makeup is the same as that used for rocket protection I 'm unsure of .	St
1.7.7	-- -- -Willy	St
1.8.1	http : //www.wd40.com/AboutUs/our_history.html In conjunction with my earlier post and this link should explain things far better than I from memory .	St
1.8.2	Hope this helps -- -- -Willy	St
1.9.1	Got your point .	St
1.9.2	You are absolutely correct .	Res
1.9.3	Thanks !	St
1.10.1	what brand name is approved by NASA and better than WD-40 .	St
1.10.2	You wo n't be spamming or advertising unless you are employed by the company and then that will be debatable used in the context of this discussion .	St
1.10.3	I have heard and could it be a product from the X-IR corporation that produces also a gun lub/cleaner , or the VCI Vapor corrosion inhibitor with their numerour spray types labeled NOX-RUST , or perhaps Bullfrog ( Bullrog ) Rust Blocker approved by the Navy and used by the Military and NASA ?	Ques
1.10.4	Please tell us .	Sug
1.11.1	Liquid Wrench , and WD-40 .	St
1.11.2	A absolute honest true story : Years ago when I had a 1940 's era auto , the right front tire rod ( ball socket connected to steering of right front wheel ) fell off dragging on the ground .	St
1.11.3	Came to a halt as just could n't steer properly with one wheel .	St
1.11.4	Well , fished around in the trunk and found a coathanger .	St
1.11.5	Mind you now , this was before Duct Tape was invented .	St
1.11.6	Used the coathanger to wrap around and hold the socket in long enough to drive 20 miles home then next day 20 miles back into town to the auto dealer to get replaced .	St
1.11.7	The mechanic could hardly believe I could have made it with that coathanger .	St
1.11.8	Even today , I always have a coathanger and Duct Tape in my trunk .	St
1.11.9	JR	St
1.12.1	Ca n't remember the brand , just saw it in TV shopping , I will tell you when I see it again , could be X-1R 's , did n't try it though , as I said , they claim to be better than any lubricating brand in the market , but a claim is a claim and an advertisement is an advertisement .	St
1.12.2	I am still using WD40 though and they had been used by NASA too .	St
1.12.3	There are many new lubricant brands being advertised now , even X-1R 's is a new product ( correct me if i am wrong ) and history will judge for their effectiveness .	St
1.12.4	LOL .	St
1.13.1	Western Digital 40 GB Hard Drive .	St
1.14.1	Finally , something I can talk about .	St
1.14.2	WD-40 is used today as a liquid or spray un-seizing agent for loosening up Rusted or stuck hardware .	St
1.14.3	I use it all the time on the Studebaker Automobiles I drive .	St
1.14.4	However , I was told that the original use for this product goes back to the 1950 's .	St
1.14.5	The formula comes from an early US Army missile project .	St
1.14.6	The contractor created the liquid to help prevent cracks & chipping on missile nose cones .	St
1.14.7	I hope this answers your question .	St
1.15.1	It stands for Water Displacement - 40 th attempt .	St
1.15.2	That 's the name straight out of the lab book used by the chemist who developed WD-40 back in 1953 .	St
1.15.3	The chemist , Norm Larsen , was attempting to concoct a formula to prevent corrosion -- a task which is done by displacing water .	St
1.15.4	Norm 's persistence paid off when he perfected the formula on his 40th try .	St
1.16.1	And if any 1 is more curious about it check http : //www.wd40.com/	St
1.17.1	The inventor of WD 40 shortened Water Displacement 40 to WD 40	St
1.18.1	And its good for relieving the pain of arthritis .	St
1.19.1	I know of a product called WD40 which stands for Water Displacement - 40th attempt .	St
1.19.2	As its name states , it removes water from metal parts to prevent corrosion or loosen corroded parts .	St
1.19.3	Hope this answer helps .	St
1.20.1	wd 40 was shown on a english tv programe called tomorrows world where it was sprayed on to a electric drill and then emersed in water switched on and running it was then taken out with bear hands and used ( DONT TRY THIS AT HOME ) bryan allen	St
1.21.1	As far as I am aware , WD40 was invented in britain during the Second World War ( in 1940 ) , by the War Department for use with any mechanical lubrication .	St
1.21.2	Thus the name stands for War Department 40 ( of 1940 ) , the application made into an aerosol came later - about 1950 .	St
1.22.1	I would n't call WD-40 a wonder drug .	St
1.22.2	While it is a wonder product , it is certainly not call it a drug .	St
1.22.3	WD-40 has been around since 1953 it is a Spray Lubricant/Penetrating Lubricant/Water Dispersant for mechanical parts it can be used to loosen rusted bolts and nuts .	St
1.22.4	It can be used in some electronic components like Volume controls when they make noise while adjusting volume .	St
1.22.5	There are other brand products like CRC-556 that do the same job , I hope this was helpful , visit www.wd40.com to find out more .	St
1.22.6	Keith	St
1.23.1	WD stands for & quot ; Water Dispersant & quot ;	St
1.24.1	I have n't seen a connection to & quot ; PC Hardware & quot ; in the thread , so here is one .	St
1.24.2	Back in the ancient days of dot matrix printers , the ink ribbon could be rejuvenated by spraying with WD-40 .	St
1.24.3	The ribbon would last at least 3 times as long .	St
1.25.1	WD Stands for Water Dispersant/Water Displacement	St
1.26.1	If you like WD40 then you should try PB Blaster .	Sug
1.26.2	PB Blaster takes rust busting to a new level .	St
1.26.3	I have not found any stuck/rusty part that this ca n't break loose , whereas WD40 does not penetrate rusted/stuck parts as well .	St
1.26.4	I used to use WD 40 for years but now I only use PB Blaster .	St
1.26.5	Mark	St
1.27.1	OK , we 've heard how WD40 relates to PC 's , but how about around the home and garden ?	Ques
1.27.2	This one was given to me by my son-in-law .	St
1.27.3	I had a problem with a bee 's nest and was out of the 'Wasp and Hornet ' spray ( you know , the kind of stuff that kills them instantly from 20 ' away ) .	St
1.27.4	My son-in-law told me that WD40 did the same job .	St
1.27.5	So I tried it on a wasp nest .	St
1.27.6	Wow !	St
1.27.7	they curled up instantly .	St
1.27.8	I guess it displaces the moisture in their bodies so fast they do n't know what hit 'em .	St
1.27.9	Way to go WD40 !	St
1.28.1	Racko I heard tell it was to lube the print heads .	St
1.28.2	Bill .	St
1.29.1	hi halvaro , wd-40 is a spray on lubricant , contained in an aerosol can , I believe it also has non conductive properties , so is safe to use on low voltage equipment , you probably have the equivalent product in mexico .	St
1.29.2	hope this helps .	Polite
1.29.3	asta la vista mi amigo .	St
1.30.1	Britain ? ?	Ques
1.30.2	San Diego is not in Britain !	St
1.30.3	Maybe it was the Russians .	St
1.30.4	Back then they claimed to have invented everything .	St
1.30.5	Or possibly it was Al Gore , the well known inventor of the internet .	St
1.31.1	Courtesy the WD-40 website : In 1953 , a fledgling company called Rocket Chemical Company and its staff of three set out to create a line of rust-prevention solvents and degreasers for use in the aerospace industry , in a small lab in San Diego , California .	St
1.31.2	It took them 40 attempts to get the water displacing formula worked out .	St
1.31.3	But they must have been really good , because the original secret formula for WD-40which stands for Water Displacement perfected on the 40th tryis still in use today .	St
1.31.4	Convair , an aerospace contractor , first used WD-40 to protect the outer skin of the Atlas Missile from rust and corrosion .	St
1.31.5	The product actually worked so well that several employees snuck some WD-40 cans out of the plant to use at home .	St
1.31.6	A few years following WD-40 's first industrial use , Rocket Chemical Company founder Norm Larsen experimented with putting WD-40 into aerosol cans , reasoning that consumers might find a use for the product at home as some of the employees had .	St
1.31.7	The product made its first appearance on store shelves in San Diego in 1958 .	St
1.31.8	In 1960 the company nearly doubled in size , growing to seven people , who sold an average of 45 cases per day from the trunk of their cars to hardware and sporting goods stores in the San Diego area .	St
1.31.9	In 1961 the first full truckload order for WD-40 was filled when employees came in on a Saturday to produce additional concentrate to meet the disaster needs of the victims of hurricane Carla along the U.S. Gulf coast .	St
1.31.10	WD-40 was used to recondition flood and rain damaged vehicles and equipment .	St
1.31.11	In 1969 the company was renamed after its only product , WD-40 .	St
1.31.12	WD-40 Company , Inc. , went public in 1973 and was listed Over-The-Counter .	St
1.31.13	The stock price increased by 61 % on the first day of listing .	St
1.31.14	Since that time , WD-40 has grown by leaps and bounds , and is now virtually a household name , used in numerous consumer and industrial markets such as automotive , manufacturing , sporting goods , aviation , hardware and home improvement , construction , and farming .	St
1.31.15	In 1983 , WD-40 Company sales reached $ 50.2 million .	St
1.31.16	Many companies attempted to introduce imitation products , going so far as to copy the distinctive blue , yellow and red colors of the WD-40 can .	St
1.31.17	In 1993 , WD-40 Company celebrated its 40th anniversary by breaking the $ 100 million sales mark .	St
1.31.18	That year the company was also listed among the Top Ten Most Profitable companies on the NASDAQ exchange .	St
1.31.19	Not bad for a company with only one product !	St
1.31.20	WD-40 was found to be in 4 out of 5 American households ( it seems everyone has a can or two ) and was used by 81 percent of professionals at work .	St
1.31.21	Sales had grown to more than one million cans each week .	St
1.31.22	The most interesting piece of WD-40 's history is the uses for the product , now numbering in the thousands .	St
1.31.23	The uses include everything from silencing squeaky hinges and removing road tar from automobiles to protecting tools from rust and removing adhesive labels .	St
1.31.24	But they get a lot crazier than that .	St
1.31.25	Over the years , thousands of WD-40 users have written testimonial letters to the company sharing their often unique , if sometimes just plain weird , uses for the productmany of which are shared in other parts of this Web site .	St
1.31.26	Some of the most interesting stories include the bus driver in Asia who used WD-40 to remove a python snake which had coiled itself around the undercarriage of his bus .	St
1.31.27	Or when police officers used WD-40 to remove a naked burglar trapped in an air conditioning vent .	St
1.31.28	Very few brands will ever match the popularity of WD-40 .	St
1.31.29	In fact , the variety and uniqueness of uses for WD-40 proved so popular that The WD-40 Book , ( Bad Dog Press 1997 ) featuring many user testimonials and the wacky humor of the Duct Tape Guys , was published in 1997 .	St
1.31.30	But WD-40 's literary legend does n't end there .	St
1.31.31	The familiar blue and yellow can has been featured in other books ranging from The Big Damn Book of Sheer Manliness ( General Publishing 1997 ) , Polish Your Furniture With Panty Hose ( Hyperion 1995 ) , WD-40 for the Soul : The Guide to Fixing Everything ( TV Books 1999 ) , and Talking Dirty With the Queen of Clean ( Pocket Books , 1998 ) to college textbooks .	St
1.32.1	There 's been some great tips in this discussion about what can be done with WD-40 - but here 's the definitive list of uses ... http : //www.twbc.org/wd40.htm Now go out and spray something ! !	St
1.32.2	!	St
1.33.1	WD - Water Displacement 40 - 40th Formulation	St
1.34.1	this is a spray created for water displacement , the author tried 40 times to get to the right formula .	St
1.34.2	it is used to take humidity out of many things like carburators of cars or relys etc..	St
1.35.1	That could be the model number of the 40 GB hard drive made by Western Digital company .	St
1.36.1	Sorry , you are wrong .	St
1.36.2	WD-40 is a light oil in an aerosol ( spray can ) but it is not primarily meant for lubrication .	St
1.36.3	It is a Water Displacing fluid ie .	St
1.36.4	dries out electrics , hence the WD .	St
1.36.5	The 40 stands for the number of efforts to get the formula correct .	St
1.36.6	It does dry out and hence is really no good as a long term lubricant but is great for the electrics on your car , boat etc .	St
1.37.1	Bill , Actually , it acted more as a non-volatile solvent .	St
1.37.2	It dissolved and redistributed the ink and it did n't dissolve quickly .	St
1.37.3	It did n't have any noticeable affect on the print heads .	St
1.38.1	You Dang Dipstick !	St
1.38.2	!	St
1.39.1	NIL	St
1.40.1	WD-40 is a lubricant commonly usede on door hinges , etc .	St
1.41.1	Halvaro , WD40-Water Displacemant 40- is a a clear lubricant .	St
1.41.2	You can use WD40 to loosen rusted nuts and bolts , removing permanent marker off the carpet , lubricate squeaky doors etc ...	St
1.41.3	There are 40 uses and counting for this remarkable product .	St
1.41.4	And as the name implies , the main purpose is to displace water .	St
1.41.5	Sjahman	St
1.42.1	It is one of 2 things or in a wild way both .	St
1.42.2	1 .	St
1.42.3	WD40 is a spray oil , penetrating oil .	St
1.42.4	Used for rustproofing exposed metal , lubricating hinges , soaking frozen nuts and bolts that have gotten rusted so that you could loosen them .	St
1.42.5	2 .	St
1.42.6	WD could stand for Western Digital , 40 could stand for a 40 gig , so WD40 could most likely mean Western Digital 40 Gig hard drive .	St
1.42.7	Hope this was of some help .	St
1.42.8	Robert	St
1.43.1	WD 40 is another of those space age materials that every good man has in his tool box .	St
1.43.2	Originally it was created for the electrical industry as its initials signify -- W water -- D dispersal 40 .	St
1.43.3	It was soon to be taken over as the do it all light lubricant .	St
1.43.4	It however is short lived as a lubricant as it was made to evaporate .	St
1.43.5	If I recall it is made of a solvent and kerosene and when sprayed on a surface would cause the wate to lift and float on the film and be wiped or washed away with the WD40	St
1.44.1	Here in Central Oregon , 'TRI-FLOW -- Superior Lubricant ' is the favourite .	St
1.44.2	It is made by Sherwin-Williams Company , Cleveland , Ohio 44115 .	St
1.44.3	WD-40 tends to wear-off , it seems to me , and I really like TRI-FLOW .	St
1.44.4	However , it ought not to be applied to the body or inhaled overmuch ; I do not know if WD-40 , which has been popular at least 35 years , is more body-friendly , and I never heard of using it for arthritis -- it does contain liquid silicon lubricant .	St
1.45.1	Here in Australia WD-40 has been available for many years .	St
1.45.2	The product is available in aerosol container for ease of use .	St
1.45.3	It 's uses are many : - 1. waterproofing car electrics eg distributor leads 2. spraying onto rusted bolts and nuts to facilitate the breaking down of the rusted joint 3. using it as a lubricant on screw threads etc..	St

1.47.2	I read a little more than half of the replies .	St
1.47.3	Nice history lessons and mode of action and applications , but nothing about the composition that answers the question & quot ; what is WD40 ... & quot ; Give this a read : Newsgroups : sci.chem Subject : Re : WD 40 Ingredients From : B.Hamilton @ irl.cri.nz ( Bruce Hamilton ) Date : Fri , 13 Jun 1997 10:18:38 +12 Well , I 'll be a little crass and add to my post .	St
1.47.4	In article & lt ; ... & gt ; B.Hamilton @ irl.cri.nz ( Bruce Hamilton ) writes : & gt ; The WD stands for Water Displacing .	St
1.47.5	I have n't analysed it , ( not commonly sold here ) but somebody ( Professor Toraki ?	Ques
1.47.6	) squirted some down a GC/MS and confirmed the solvent was boiling around 150-200C and only contained a minor % of aromatics , which means it is either a narrow boiling range kerosine fraction , or a special narrow boiling range solvent like low aromatics white spirits .	St
1.47.7	It is listed as Stoddard Solvent - which is actually a low aromatics White Spirit .	St
1.47.8	It would have a boiling range between 150C - 200C and an aromatics content below 20 % .	St
1.47.9	According to various sources , the typical liquid product contains : - 70 % low aromatic white spirits ( stoddard solvent ) ~20 % lubricant base grade ( solvent de-waxed , paraffinic type ) 10 % of corrosion inhibitor ( some formulations use 2 inhibitors , normally they would only be present at low concentrations , so it 's possible that the inhibitor could be something crude like an oil that produces a hard film with synthetic additives ) 5 % of wetting agent ( probably quite low concentration , other the formulation would emulsify some water which could affect theprotective film 's durability and performance ) & lt ; 5 % of fragrance .	St
1.47.10	The aerosol versions adds 25 % of LPG as propellant to the above ( probably with less of the wetting agent to minimise foam ) My earlier suggestions are n't too different from the above .	St
1.47.11	Bruce Hamilton =============================	St
1.48.1	WD-40 WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR WATER DISPLACMENT .	St
1.48.2	IT CAN BE USED ON ANYTHING ELECTRICAL BECAUSE IT IS NOT A CONDUCTOR .	St
1.48.3	WD-40 CAN BE USED ON LIVE CIRCUITS THAT ARE CORRODED OR DIRTY , WHILE ALSO PROTECTING FROM ANY FURTHER CORROSION .	St
1.48.4	WD-40 IS ALSO USED FOR A GENERAL LUBRICATE THAT IS GOOD FOR LOOSENING RUSTY BOLTS , OILING DOOR HINGES OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN THINK OFF .	St
1.48.5	WD-40 IS ALSO CONBUSTIBLE .	St
1.48.6	IT SHOULD NOT BE USED NEAR ANY OPEN FLAMES , SPARKS OR HOT ITEMS .	St

1.51.1	Hi Halvaro .	St
1.51.2	Remember to wear eye protection .	St
1.51.3	WD-40 is a solvent and is used as a lubricant in some applications .	St
1.51.4	It can be sprayed into a lock cylinder to get it working again ; used on rusty hinges to reduce or eliminate squeak ; used on rusty bolts/hardware to help loosen them ; sprayed on the surface of metal that you may need to drill through-it keeps the drill bit cool and lubricated and helps to maintain a sharp point , etc .	St
1.51.5	There are many other uses .	St
1.51.6	It can be purchased at just about any hardware store or home center such as Lowe 's or Home Depot .	St
1.51.7	I 've even used to keep honing stones lubricated in automotive work for brakes and engine blocks .	St
1.51.8	Please be sure to follow the manufacturers recomendations for safe use of the product .	Sug
1.51.9	It is petroleum based and toxic and may even contain some graphite .	St
1.51.10	Good luck .	Polite
1.52.1	I think your original question has been answered 50 times over , but no one has mentioned my favorite use for WD40 : removing those nasty price stickers and product labels from things I buy .	St
1.52.2	Just spray the sticker with WD40 , let it sit a few minutes , and voila !	St
1.52.3	The sticker comes right off .	St
1.52.4	If you do n't want the WD40 residue on the product , just wipe it off with a paper towel and a little alcohol .	St

1.54.1	NIL	St
1.55.1	Well the subject is WD-40 .	St
1.55.2	I guess they needed something to loosen up their thoughts .	St
1.56.1	WD-40 is a chemical used to displace water ( Water Displacement ) on parts exposed to excess moisture and condesation .	St
1.56.2	The & quot ; 40 & quot ; means it works down to -40 degrees Farenheit .	St
1.56.3	Some folks use it as a lubricant but it 's not intended for that purpose .	St
1.57.1	There is a factory near me which cans the product and many people whom work there use it for just that purpose .	St
1.57.2	They spray it on the joints of thier fingures and rub it in .	St
1.57.3	They claim it helps .	St
1.58.1	Well it 's good I think , kinda shows there are people who read this form .	St

1.62.1	When WD-40 did become popular , many people found other uses for it .	St
1.62.2	In fact , an old advertisement for it listed over a hundred situations where it has been used in .	St
1.62.3	Being a brass musician , I find it useful to get the tuning slide moving again .	St

1.66.1	WD 40 is a lubricating oil mixture .	St
1.66.2	Sold in a spray can and used as an anti-rust deterrent .	St
1.66.3	Part Oil and part parafin mix	St
1.67.1	As related to computer use , with a dot matrix printer , this is a useful item .	St
1.67.2	Dot matrix is old tech , but for draft papers , when you need to use NCR forms or just when a cheap print out is required , they are still great .	St
1.67.3	For single non-business letters , my 24 pin printer is still my main unit .	St
1.67.4	Anyway , a dot matrix printer uses an ink ribbon ; a print head physically strikes the paper though an inked ribbon in a dot pattern .	St
1.67.5	The dots are close enough to each other and often overlap , so that our human brain sees the dots as readable characters .	St
1.67.6	The area of impact is only in the middle , so the print gets lighter as you use it .	St
1.67.7	You can open the printer ribbon and give a VERY LIGHT spray of WD-40 .	St
1.67.8	This will desolve some of the ink from the top , unused part of the ribbon , and make it print fine for a while longer .	St
1.68.1	WD-40 literally stands for Water Displacement , 40th attempt .	St
1.68.2	That 's the name straight out of the lab book used by the chemist who developed WD-40 back in 1953 .	St
1.68.3	The chemist , Norm Larsen , was attempting to concoct a formula to prevent corrosion -- a task which is done by displacing water .	St
1.68.4	Norm 's persistence paid off when he perfected the formula on his 40th try .	St

1.70.1	WD40 is a fluid that is used to dry out and isolate electrical circuits .	St
1.70.2	& quot ; WD & quot ; stands for & quot ; water displacing & quot ; and the & quot ; 40 & quot ; is the number of times the experiment to produce it was carried out before the product finally worked .	St
1.70.3	Some people mistakenly think it is used as a lubricant .	St
1.70.4	It is quite good for that in the short term - it will free seized nuts and bolts etc .	St
1.70.5	The trouble is it tends to dry out .	St
1.70.6	So using it , say on a lock or window runner will result in the problem reappearing after a while .	St
1.70.7	Tis good stuff for vehicle electrics .	St
1.70.8	It is available in aerosol and drip/oil can formats .	St
1.71.1	Here in UK I use WD40 at work , & we need to recieve a product Data sheet with an order .	St
1.71.2	It stated it was composed of Oil & White spirit .	St
1.71.3	There is certainly more , as you state , Bruce , as you can smell the perfume , and the wetting agent is probably soap .	St
1.71.4	( these would not need to be stated . )	St
1.71.5	You could make , very simply , a good substitute at home , out of things in the workshop .	St
1.71.6	When I worked as a Radio & T/V repair man , we used to make it in this fashion if we ran out of switch cleaner .	St
1.71.7	( Remember this ?	Ques
1.71.8	) In fact to reduce the risk of corrosion a lot if items , ( Soft greases oils etc ) were mixed with parrafin substances , as when they were painted on the surface , the solvent dried out , leaving the greasy coating to exclude the air , so preserving it .	St
1.71.9	That said , Its very handy in aerosol form .	St
1.71.10	I bought a second hand gas cooker of a lady that had altered the kitchen so it didnt fit .	St
1.71.11	She picked up a can to spray & clean the grease of it before I took it !	St

1.72.4	WD-40 was created in 1953 by three technicians at the San Diego Rocket Chemical Company .	St
1.72.5	It 's name comes from the project that was to find a & quot ; water displacement & quot ; compound .	St
1.72.6	They were successful with the fortieth formulation , thus WD-40 .	St
1.72.7	The Corvair Company bought it in bulk to protect their Atlas missile parts .	St
1.72.8	The workers were so pleased with the product , they began smuggling ( also known as & quot ; shrinkage & quot ; or & quot ; stealing & quot ; ) it out to use at home .	St
1.72.9	The executives decided there might be a consumer market for it and put it in aerosol cans .	St
1.72.10	The rest , as they say , is history .	St
1.72.11	It is a carefully guarded recipe known only to four people .	St
1.72.12	Only one of them is the & quot ; brew master. & quot ; There are about 2.5 million gallons of the stuff manufactured each year .	St
1.72.13	It gets it 's distinctive smell from a fragrance that is added to the brew .	St
1.72.14	Ken East says there is nothing in WD-40 that would hurt you .	St

1.86.1	Hi Halvaro , WD 40 is a lubricant for lubricating mechanical parts of a m/c .	St
1.86.2	It should never be used on elctronic compnents or where there is a mix of electronic & mechanical .	St
1.86.3	Many years ago when I worked for IBM we were advised not to use WD40 due to poblems caused by inhaling the fumes .	St
1.86.4	Good computing .	St

1.95.25	Keep in mind though , using some chemical laced baits or lures for fishing are not allowed in some states .	St
1.95.26	& gt ; Use it for fire ant bites It takes the sting away immediately , and stops the itch .	St
1.95.27	& gt ; WD-40 is great for removing crayon from walls .	St
1.95.28	Spray on the mark and wipe with a clean rag .	St
1.95.29	& gt ; Also , if you 've discovered that your teenage daughter has washed and dried a tube of lipstick with a load of laundry , saturate the lipstick spots with WD-40 and rewash .	St
1.95.30	Presto !	St
1.95.31	Lipstick is gone !	St
1.95.32	& gt ; If you sprayed WD-40 on the distributor cap , it would displace the moisture and allow the car to start .	St
1.95.33	( If I knew what a distributor cap was , it might help ) & gt ; WD-40 , long known for its ability to remove leftover tape mung ( sticky label tape ) , is also a lovely perfume and air freshener !	St
1.95.34	Sprayed liberally on every hinge in the house , it leaves that distinctive clean fresh scent for up to two days !	St
1.95.35	& gt ; Seriously though , it removes black scuff marks from the kitchen floor !	St
1.95.36	& gt ; Use WD-40 for those nasty tar and scuff marks on flooring .	St
1.95.37	It does n't seem to harm the finish and you wo n't have to scrub nearly as hard to get them off .	St
1.95.38	& gt ; Just remember to open some windows if you have a lot of marks .	St
1.95.39	& gt ; Bug guts will eat away the finish on your car if not removed quickly !	St
1.95.40	& gt ; Use WD-40 !	St
1.95.41	& gt ; & gt ; The applications appear to be endless e-mail I recieved from my friend	St
1.96.1	Hello WD40 is usually an aerosol based cleaner / lubricant that penetrates and lubricates delicate or not so delicate items .	St
1.96.2	It can also be used for freeing up nuts and bolts and works well on cooling fan bearings on cpu 's	St
1.97.1	WD-40 is indeed a wonderful product .	Polite
1.97.2	A better penetrating product for purposes of loosening frozen bolts or breaking down rust , is Kano 's Sili-Kroil .	St
1.97.3	It is also an excellent cutting oil .	St
1.97.4	Manufactured by Kano Laboratories in Nashville , TN .	St
1.98.1	WD stands for water displacement	St
1.99.1	A fine vintage of penetrating oil used for loosening rusted nuts ( ? ) .	St
1.99.2	An ingredient in my Kickapoo Joyjuice .	St
1.100.1	According to the WD-40 Company : & quot ; WD-40 literally stands for Water Displacement , 40th attempt .	St
1.100.2	That 's the name straight out of the lab book used by the chemist who developed WD-40 back in 1953 .	St
1.100.3	The chemist , Norm Larsen , was attempting to concoct a formula to prevent corrosion - a task which is done by displacing water .	St
1.100.4	Norm 's persistence paid off when he perfected the formula on his 40th try. & quot ; WD-40 was invented in 1953 , by the three members of the Rocket Chemical Company of San Diego , California .	St
1.100.5	They were working on a line of industrial rust-prevention solvents and degreasers for use in the aerospace industry .	St
1.100.6	WD-40 was first used to protect the outer skin of the Atlas Missile from rust and corrosion .	St
1.100.7	Norm Larsen then repackaged WD-40 into aerosol cans for consumer use and the product was first sold to the general public in 1958 .	St
1.100.8	In 1969 , the Rocket Chemical Company was renamed after its only product , WD-40 .	St
1.101.1	WD40 may be fine for certain uses on computer systems but , the items must remain in an environment that is as low in humidity as you can get .	St
1.101.2	Otherwise , the humidity will allow rust to reapear on the cleaned surface .	St
1.101.3	In other words , it might work great in Arizona but , do n't plan on the same results here , in South Alabama !	St
1.101.4	Being an avid hunter , I tried it when it became popular to use on firearms and paid the price for not keeping constant check on them .	St
1.101.5	For it 's quality to loosen rested , frozen bolts/screws , it is easily surpassed but B'Laster , found in Wal Mart and most automotive parts stores .	St
1.101.6	IF you desire fast work on rusted or sticking parts and a remaining thin coat of lubricant , this should be your & quot ; weapon of choice & quot ; .	St
1.101.7	It 's accomplishments read like a & quot ; Jack of All Trades & quot ; product .	St
1.101.8	BUT ... .this is my automotive and sports related background speaking ... .not that of my limied computer experience .	St
1.101.9	My suggestion : Read the labels on each product , check their corresponding web sites for their products usage , get a small can of each and evaluate them yourself ... .for your personal usage .	Sug
1.101.10	What works for one , does not always satisfy the other .	St
1.101.11	Have a good day ... .just my personal opinion .	St
1.102.1	Does the same thing for earwigs , which I find a lot more offensive than wasps ...	St
1.103.1	I entirely missed this most important point that was discovered by many older sufferers of Arthritis ... .believe it or not ... .when a light coat is sprayed on certain joints , inflamed with Arthritis , the pain , in many instances , is reduced tremendously .	St
1.103.2	Since I have been so unlucky to have become problemed with this physical ailment , I have to attest to the fact thay they were right !	St
1.103.3	It might not help your computer but , it could aid in the reduction of pain in the Arthritic fingers and hands , during an extensive round on the keyboard .	Sug
1.103.4	Just a passing thought that might help you when you get older .	St
1.103.5	It 's much cheaper than some of the meds but , it does have an odor that some do n't like .	St
1.103.6	Just remember , getting old does n't mean you are supposed to get stupid , too .	St
1.104.1	I found a different product once some years ago .	St
1.104.2	I wo n't say it 's better than WD-40 ( I do n't think anything can be ... ) .	St
1.104.3	This stuff was just a penetrating oil for loosening rusted-on nuts and such .	St
1.104.4	I 've kept the can ever since , just because I got a chuckle from the name ... it was called & quot ; Nuts Off & quot ; .	St
1.104.5	For a practical joke type of person , the possibilities are endless .	St
1.105.1	Originally formulated for use on the circuitry in the Saturn Rockets - that goes back a bit .	St
1.105.2	NEVER use it on computer fans and Printer parts ... .	St
1.105.3	It works OK on the day but then dries to a sticky black gunk and jams everything up .	St
1.105.4	Water displacement on cars and rusty bolts is fine but keep it away from PCs and Printers .	St
1.106.1	WD-40 is very useful stuff when used carefully and in the correct application .	St
1.106.2	Most of the good properties come from the fact it is based on solvents , which will react with things then evaporate and thus remove them .	St
1.106.3	This is particularly noticeable is applications involving Hydrocarbons , most notably in crude oil derived substances such as lubricating oils , cooking oils , greases and various fuels .	St
1.106.4	This is why it is so good at many cleaning applications , particularly in the kitchen , as the polarity of the solvent will break down the bonds .	St
1.106.5	The polarity is also responsible for the water displacement , as the water will also evaporate in the same fashion .	St
1.106.6	But enough of chemistry .	St
1.106.7	It should not be seen as a genuine lubricant .	St
1.106.8	Yes it does help things to slide past each other in the short term , but once the solvents have evaporated residues are left behind which can actually cause problems in itself , so by solving one problem you can cause another .	St
1.106.9	I work for a major petrochemicals company in the lubricants division and I 'm not going to name it , but from my work it is very obvious to me that there are very few lubricant products that are suitable for every task , you would n't cook with the oil that you put in your car and so the same principles should be applied to the use of WD-40 .	St
1.106.10	Having said all that , it is good at a lot of things , but you must always bear in mind it does evaporate so will often be a short term solution and lubricating oils or greases should be considered in most applications , there are many oils around which arent black and thick and gloopy like that which you put into your car and the technology around is such that there are many oils/grease designed for the specific application which whilst costing slightly more than WD-40 would do will do the job better and for longer .	St
1.107.1	WD-40 : A friend sent this to me , and when I read the & quot ; shower door & quot ; part I tried it .	St
1.107.2	It 's the first thing that has ever cleaned that spotty shower door .	St
1.107.3	Mine is plastic , not glass and it 's a miracle !	St
1.107.4	Then I tried my stove top ... . it 's now shinier than it 's ever been .	St
1.107.5	I 'm amazed .	St
1.107.6	The product began from a search for a rust preventative solvent and de-greaser to protect missile parts .	St
1.107.7	WD-40 was created in 1953 by three technicians at the San Diego Rocket Chemical Company .	St
1.107.8	It 's name comes from the project that was to find a & quot ; Water Displacement & quot ; compound .	St
1.107.9	They were successful with the fortieth formulation , thus WD-40 .	St
1.107.10	The Corvair Company bought it in bulk to protect their Atlas missile parts .	St
1.107.11	The workers were so pleased with the product , they began smuggling ( also known as & quot ; shrinkage & quot ; or & quot ; stealing & quot ; ) it out to use at home .	St
1.107.12	The executives decided there might be a consumer market for it and put it in aerosol cans .	St
1.107.13	The rest - is history .	St
1.107.14	It is a carefully guarded recipe known only to four people .	St
1.107.15	Only one of them is the & quot ; brew master. & quot ; There are about 2.5 million gallons of the stuff manufactured each year .	St
1.107.16	It gets it 's distinctive smell from a fragrance that is added to the brew .	St
1.107.17	Ken East says there is nothing in WD-40 that would hurt you .	St
1.107.18	Here are some of the uses :	St
1.108.1	Halvaro , the man who invented WD 40 named the product .	St
1.108.2	He developed the final product after the 40th attempt .	St
1.108.3	The WD stands for & quot ; Water Displacement & quot ; .	St
1.108.4	Frank	St
1.109.1	Ahhhhhh WD 40 what a smell .	St
1.109.2	I remember when I was an apprentice motor mechanic working at Brook Hire in Garston we used to spray it all over the spark plug leads and the dizzy cap when a car would n't start because it was damp .	St
1.109.3	We used to go thru A LARGE number of cans because it smelt so good .	St
1.109.4	Not a & quot ; getting you high & quot ; smell but a & quot ; coal tar & quot ; type smell .	St
1.109.5	Really really nice .	Polite
1.110.1	being so this is a pc hardware forum i would guess that the wd40 you are referring to is western digital 40 gig hard drive , but thats just my guess .	St
1.111.1	Well , it might just be the Product , used to lubricate things -- - & gt ; http : //www.wd40.com/ Or it may be a Western Digital hard drive	St
1.112.1	Works great as water displacer and as long term lube .	St
1.112.2	They used to ( maybe still do ) sell it much cheaper ( per unit cost ) in gallons .	St
1.112.3	They also sell a refillable hand operated sprayer ( at high cost ) so I used leftover sprayers from household cleaners .	St
1.112.4	They worked well for only about a day or two .	St
1.112.5	The company tech support explained that WD40 causes plastic parts to swell , and kills the spraying action .	St
1.112.6	they had to make a very special sprayer to work with WD40 .	St
1.112.7	So be careful when using around plastics .	St
1.112.8	The effect may not be good .	St
1.112.9	( They do n't seem to supply this warning ) .	St
1.113.1	WD-40 is a anti sieze spray to loosen rusted bolts .	St
1.113.2	Sometimes used to dry wet circuit boards .	St
1.114.1	NOW ... .it seems that we might be getting somewhere .	St
1.114.2	I might be very close to being & quot ; computer illiterate & quot ; but , I was n't seeing a very close relationship between my computer and a can of WD 40 .	St
1.114.3	Now the smoke is beginning to clear .	St
1.114.4	Thanks ... .	Polite
1.115.1	Substance is sprayed on mechanisms and dirt sticks to it .	St
1.115.2	Mechanisms gum-up , wear out and break down .	St
1.116.1	WD 40 comes in a spray can and it is used to spray on such things as door hinges so you can open the door without any noise or sticking .	St
1.116.2	In other words , it is kind of like oil on sewing machine parts , it makes them work better and keeps friction to a minimum .	St
1.117.1	Wd-40 is a wonder lubricant in an aerosol can .	St
1.117.2	I believe it has over one million uses !	St
1.118.1	Too fuss for nothing you knucklehead !	St

1.121.1	Hey , Not sure about WD40 in the computer/tech world , but generally WD40 is a spray lubricant , like oil for engines , door hinges , bicycle chains , etc .	St
1.121.2	Hope this helps .	St
1.122.1	I can recall the icon of my grand mother .	St
1.122.2	Every night before going to bed , she used to rub her knees with some warm portion of kerosene that she took from the tank of the lamp .	St
1.122.3	Growing older , I met a few people making use of vaseline for the same purpose -- soothing the pain from arthritis .	St
1.122.4	Being a kid I remember every time I caught a cold my mother used to rub my body with kerosene mixed with alcohol .	St
1.122.5	I was not able to find a study relevant , but I believe there must be a connection with arthritis since the main part of WD-40 comes from distilled petroleum	St
1.123.1	Sorry did't mean to start another WAR , keep on beathing it , take a bath in it if you wish , if you want to work with it for 20 years be my guest.If zed cared for his workers he would n't let his workers breath it for to long.Wo n't say another word .	St
1.124.1	My dear Jinks , I am afraid you did not get it AT ALL , and you appear to be the know-all man .	St
1.124.2	Whoever asks for proof and evidence is rather unlike to ask for a war .	St
1.124.3	Moreover , indirect provoking of the style & quot ; take a bath in it if you wish & quot ; or & quot ; ... be my guest & quot ; do not contribute to a proper discussion on the basis of qood will .	St
1.124.4	Anyway , WHO is zed , in what way was he informed ( I mean , did they provided him with evidence and proof of what they claimed ? )	Ques
1.124.5	or was is an over-reaction ?	Ques
1.124.6	We , too , have workers and we do care about them AT LEAST AS MUCH as zed does .	St
1.124.7	We , too , want them to use WD-40 under adequate ventilation but this does not have to do with Ca but with possible temporary respiratory problems that may evolve under prolonged usage	St
1.125.1	P.S .	St
1.125.2	I DID NOT SAY IT CAUSED CANCER I SAID IT CANTAINED CARCINOGINS ! !	St
1.125.3	!	St
1.126.1	Dear papgas , I am not a & quot ; know it all person by far & quot ; but your response to my & quot ; warning & quot ; did provoke my nasty reply , having a conversation one on one might have been better .	St
1.126.2	At the place were i worked , any substance that contained a known carcinogins was replaced ( no matter the amount ) .WD 40 was replaced and it 's not hysteria.I was not out to cut the product down .	St
1.127.1	Actually , WD40 is a 40GB Western Digital Drive See Here : http : //www.compuplus.com/insidepage.php3 ? id=531 as this is in the PC Hardware section , I think that 's what he 's looking for .	St
1.128.1	WD-40 is not going to leave anything black by itself , but it will become sticky enough to capture dirt and dust , making it black - so you have a dirt problem , which WD-40 can help clean , but only temporarily .	St
1.128.2	I use WD-40 and similar products to clean the stains ( tobacco and other ) off some computer equipment parts , ( and remove labels , ) off some electric and electronic parts , very carefully ( slight sprays , clean with q-tip or towel , etc . )	St
1.128.3	Then I clean contacts with contact cleaner to remove possible coatings left behind , other cleaners if needed on other parts , not just WD-40 .	St
1.129.1	Possibly the answer is there in the 129 answers but it 's one I know- WD40 stands for Water Displacement- the 40'th trial .	St
1.129.2	Now the material is used for many , many other uses- but it is nice to know if you ever went through a water puddle and your car engine stalled- just spray WD-40 around your spark plugs .	St
1.130.1	WD-40 is a product often used to displace water , and rumor would have it the name is derrived from & quot ; Water Displacement Formula # 40 & quot ; .	St
1.130.2	It is available in spray cans and as a bulk liquid in one gallon cans ( 3.73 liters ) .	St
1.130.3	The contents , according to their material data safety sheets are approximately 45 -50 % stoddard cleaning solution ( aka dry cleaning solvent ) and 50 - 55 % mineral oil , plus a tiny bit of perfume/scent marker .	St
1.130.4	You can find more about their product lines at www.wd40.com , or the spanish-language site at www.wd40.es Cheers =-= The CyberPoet	St
1.131.1	You are right my gandmother used to rub it on her knees and wrap them at bed time , to help her arthritis.She said it was the only thing tat worked .	St
1.132.1	Well , unless there 's actually a software with that name , WD40 is a lubricant .	St
1.132.2	It comes in a spray can .	St
1.132.3	You use it on old squeeky ( possibly rusted ) door hinges , screws and whatever needs lubrication ( no sex jokes ) such as your Swiss army knife .	St

1.134.1	WD-40 is a lubricant and surface protector for metal .	St
1.134.2	It 's been around for many years .	St
1.134.3	I remember using it more than 20 years ago .	St
1.134.4	The & quot ; WD & quot ; refers to water displacement .	St
1.134.5	The & quot ; 40 & quot ; refers to the 40th test number that was finally approved for use .	St
1.134.6	It is sold in spray cans and by the gallon can that you can use in their own sprayer ( works like a Windex spray bottle ) .	St
1.134.7	You can not use it in any sprayer other that the one that is labelled & quot ; WD-40 & quot ; , because the product attacks the rubber parts of the sprayer .	St
1.134.8	The sprayer will leak where the 0-rings are located , causing leaks and an inoperative sprayer .	St
1.134.9	The container is blue and yellow .	St
1.134.10	It 's a good product .	Polite
1.134.11	The only problem I 've had using it on my boat 's engine surface , was that once the solvents evaporate , a gummy coating was left behind .	St
1.134.12	It was protecting the metal from the salt air .	St
1.134.13	It is/was used by gun owners too , to protect the metal surface .	St
1.134.14	I 've used a product that was called & quot ; CRC-556 & quot ; .	St
1.134.15	It did n't leave the residue .	St
1.134.16	It was marketed by the CRC Company .	St
1.134.17	I believe it is not sold any longer .	St
1.134.18	Now I 've been using a product called & quot ; TKX & quot ; .	St
1.134.19	It works much better than all the spray lubes , rust busters , metal protectors , etc .	St
1.134.20	I 've used it on metal parts that are frozen together , waited a sufficient amount of time , which could be a few minutes to hours , and the parts come apart .	St
1.134.21	I work in an oil refinery where we use & quot ; Liquid Wrench & quot ; and used & quot ; WD-40 & quot ; for many years .	St
1.134.22	We still use LW , but all of the mechanics raved on the quality of & quot ; TKX & quot ; We get it in spray cans .	St
1.134.23	It is a fantastic product .	St
1.134.24	I 've personally love it and haved saved a lot of valves that were frozen solid .	St
1.134.25	I applied the product , waited , and worked the bolts/ threads , etc .	St
1.134.26	and have operated them without having to replace/break them .	St
1.134.27	If you can locate it , TRY IT !	St
1.134.28	The can is multi-colored with blue-green , red , black , and white colors .	St
1.134.29	Made by LPS I just looked at a can .	St
1.134.30	Their website is & quot ; www.lpslabs.com & quot ; Thought I 'd throw my two cents in the pot !	St
1.134.31	Hope this info is what you were looking for .	St
1.135.1	Directly from the MSDS for WD-40 : & quot ; The componenets in this mixture have been found to be noncarcinogenic by NTP , IARC and OSHA. & quot ; You can read it for yourself right here .	St

1.136.1	I made a similar reply earlier .	St
1.136.2	It is good to see that others also remember .	St
1.136.3	For those who doubt that there are & quot ; many & quot ; uses for certain products , they should take a small can to someone who has arthritis and ask them to try it .	St
1.136.4	Given the time span , for those who now have these problems , it is quite likely that the person has already heard of the use of WD 40 by some arthritis victims .	St
1.136.5	Nothing is better than verification from a previous & quot ; doubter & quot ; .	St
1.136.6	Given that there is more than one & quot ; type & quot ; of arthritis , the results are going to vary .	St
1.136.7	Area climate will also cause a variation in results .	St
1.136.8	The higher the humidity , the more noticable the effects .	St
1.136.9	GOSH , maybe it has something to do with the moisture consumption of WD 40 ... .who knows , for sure ?	Ques
1.136.10	One thing is for sure , though ... .it is definitely cheaper than the meds that are used for & quot ; pain reduction & quot ; caused by the disease .	St
1.136.11	Until you are directly effected by arthritis , you will never appreciate a can of WD 40 , as much as you will then .	St
1.136.12	It is n't an & quot ; Old Wife 's Tale & quot ; , that 's for sure !	St
1.136.13	In fact , I think I 'll get me an extra can in town this afternoon .	St
1.136.14	Until then , just use it on the other meaningless places .	St
1.137.1	This is a light penetrating oil which is concocted from light oil fractions .	St
1.137.2	It has the ability to creep into threads etc and so release seized bolts and nuts .	St
1.137.3	It is also claimed to combat rust .	St

1.140.22	WD 40 is , no doubt , a good product and does the majority of what it claims .	St
1.140.23	But , IF we 're going to eat what we eat and smoke what we smoke ( including putting up with eating next to a & quot ; tobacco addict & quot ; at most meals ) then ... why in the world worry about a propellant with a possible cancer causing agent in it ?	Ques
1.140.24	The same person will probably be more effected by the smoke that was blown into it 's face , as a toddler , by one or both of it 's parents , who knew of the bad effects but just did n't give a -- -- .	St

1.140.26	Basically , what I am trying to say is : if it serves the purpose ... .use it .	St
1.140.27	Our great caring government does n't really care what happens to you anyway , as long as you pay your taxes and do n't accuse them of doing any wrong .	St
1.140.28	Their real interest , regardless of political party , is what will produce the most money and keep the sheeple satisfied .	St
1.140.29	As mentioned by another poster ... .it probably is n't even the & quot ; liquid & quot ; WD 40 that was initially being questioned anyway .	St

1.141.10	I ended up having to use a cup brush on a grinder to get it out of the gel-coat and the glue it down so it would stick .	St

1.149.10	When you can show that you used Asbestos years ago , they just usually pay you because they know that the stuff caused the long-term lung problems claimed by its victims .	St
1.149.11	Of course , they can fight it like they did the man who invented delay-windshield wipers , and pretty much try to let you die first or settle for pennies on the dollar with their big-time lawyers !	St

1.156.3	Thanks , A L Amar	St
1.157.1	Of all the explanations to what WD-40 is I can say that this one is very accurate and the Water Displacement # 40 is the correct meaning of WD-40 name .	St
1.157.2	I know this because I work for a company that produces WD-40 and if you are a member of the WD-40 family you know the history behind the product .	St
1.158.1	WD-40 ===== I have a can in front of me .	St
1.158.2	It is not clear where it is manufactured , I have to assume it was in China because of the Label .	St
1.158.3	( I have lived in this region for over 30 years ) .	St
1.158.4	WD40 is a product for & quot ; mechanical & quot ; application .	St
1.158.5	It is to be used ONCE on or at the mechanical item .	St
1.158.6	Then the item has to be cleaned , including removal of all traces of WD40 and lubricated according to the instructions of the manufacturers .	St
1.158.7	Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should it be used in or in any part of a Computer .	St
1.158.8	WD40 is a cheap chemical with the ability to supplement lubricants for a very limited time .	St
1.158.9	It changes its chemical properties very rapidly and can be very harmful even to fairly heavy gear .	St
1.158.10	It should never be used for bearings of any kind , unless such bearings will be replaced immediately with the right lubricant .	St
1.158.11	WD40 destroys lubricants , it does not replace them .	St
1.158.12	TO REPEAT : WD40 IS THE DEATH OF ANY PC SIMPLY DUE TO ITS CHEMICAL COMPOSITION .	St
1.158.13	I have an MS in Applied Engineering and a second one in High Precision Engineering ( below 1/10.000th mm ) ; Nowadays called Nano-Technology .	St
1.158.14	WD40 and a PC MUST be 5 meters apart .	St
1.158.15	Best regards , Harm	St
1.159.1	Goto : http : //www.wd40.com for details/info on the product .	St
1.159.2	The real world fact is , WD40 is very much a practical and useful product .	St
1.159.3	Its improper use maybe more for a quick fix or just to get over the hump sorta speak .	St
1.159.4	Its a penetrant and protective sheen for many items and as a lubricant ( a very light one ) it not intended to replace the orginal lube/oil of the item being used on , just a quick fix until repairs or proper attention is given .	St
1.159.5	In fact : WD40 was never intended to a lube spray but a & quot ; protective coat for rocket parts & quot ; in storage .	St
1.159.6	Added usage came later and still very few products does as it did in the beginning .	St
1.159.7	As for PC usage , try not using it in the jungles of the world , besides keeping the innards free of bugs it also helps keep moisture from preventing mildew or similar .	St
1.159.8	In the Artic , it too helps free parts for quick release in a PC and lessens frost build-up on innards of PC but only in short duration .	St
1.159.9	Yeah , I did it and only an old tech shown me that .	St

1.160.1	eluminating , I hope everyone takes the time to read this and come to thier own conclusion.When i became a member of the JH & SC WD 40 was not in use , the reason was because it contained carcinogens there was no reason to question it.Again my aplogies to all ( should have looked for my brain and dipped my tongue into it before i opened my mouth . )	St

1.167.2	It is an oil product and works great .	St
1.168.1	WD40 is a solvent .	St
1.168.2	The & quot ; WD & quot ; stands for & quot ; Water Displacement & quot ; .	St
1.168.3	From what I understand , the & quot ; 40 & quot ; is a number to indicate the formula used .	St
1.168.4	When I was in the U.S. Navy in the early 1970 's , its use was forbidden on Navy ships because it caused the water to dissipate and removed any protective oil on the surfaces that it came in contact with , allowing rapid corrosion .	St
1.168.5	I do not personally use it for anything except priming a diesel engine , as needed .	St
1.168.6	It has no other uses for me .	St
1.168.7	If I need a lubricant or penetrant , there are many other fine products available .	St
1.168.8	Hope this helps .	St
1.169.1	I 'm with you , Ernie .	St

1.174.2	I can only imagine that you are somewhere in Mexico , totally confused , trying to figure out where and how to install this can of WD40 into your computer case .	St
1.174.3	LOL Although , most ca n't imagine why you would ask this question in a pc hardware forum , everyone was eager to answer .	St
1.174.4	If you 're still wondering what is this WD40 , it could be your Western Digital 40 gb hard drive .	St
1.174.5	I hope that covers all the bases and this post can RIP .	St
1.175.1	WD 40 does n't contain what you 'd think of as oil .	St
1.175.2	Also in the UK I did some background study of WD 40 before using it in damp sticky piano mechanisms .	St
1.175.3	I had a letter from the manufacturers of the patented product when they were owned by Cadulac Chemicals in the 1970s They informed me that the product contained Animal Waxes ( that is Tallow ) Petroleum based waxes ( rather like Vaseline ) All borne up in a 3 to 1 concentration of White Spirit .	St
1.175.4	This is like a turpentine substitute .	St
1.175.5	The turps does most of the Surfactant work displacing water and the waxes do the lubrication .	St
1.175.6	It was safe to use in Piano actions , on wood , cloth and brass pivot pins and did n't dissolve any of the old fashioned Scotch Glue , or Animal Glue .	St
1.175.7	The company said I should be careful to make sure I did n't use it on any Cold-moulded plastics and there are n't any of those used even in modern pianos .	St
1.175.8	The lubricant was used to free up sticky components that the wooden parts had swollen with moist air or damp conditions .	St
1.175.9	It was very effective and had no long term side effects .	St
1.175.10	So I just thought I 'd put in my two penny worth to let you know it does n't contain oil .	St
1.175.11	Or at least it did n't when the inventors started making it .	St
1.175.12	I think the US Navy invented it and they had 40 attempts at the right formula hence Water Displacer 40 Hope that does n't all sound smug but I thought the record needed straightening .	St
