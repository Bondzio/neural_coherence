<s> So I got an Antec Nine Hundred case for xmas and I am trying to put my rosewill card reader into one of it's bays. </s>
<s> I have the bay grill cut-out part and the 3.5&quot; mount adapter but I cant see how to attach it to the case itself. </s>
<s> Could anyone provide any help to my problem please? </s>
<s> Case: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811129021 Card Reader: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820223113 </s>
<s> I've either used the floppy drive bay, some 3.5 inch adapter or in a pinch put it into some 5 inch bay by drilling a few mounting holes then crafting a plate to fill in the void. </s>
<s> I doubt there is any web page or manual for this. </s>

<s> I do have the 3.5 inch adapter that came with the case. </s>
<s> http://i117.photobucket.com/albums/o79/idrumcrazy/35_bay_adapter.png and the grill cut-out, to fit it in there. </s>
<s> http://i117.photobucket.com/albums/o79/idrumcrazy/grill_cutout.png but there are no holes I can use to mount it in. </s>
<s> do you suggest I just drill in my own? </s>
<s> But why would we not drill when we see such an issue? </s>
<s> My only advice is to do such when the case is empty so you can be sure any metal chips don't get into your other gear. </s>

<s> the &quot;1 x 5.25&quot; to 3.5&quot; adapter&quot; and the 3.5&quot; face plate. </s>
<s> or buy this... http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817991009 or buy this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811993007 VAPCMD </s>
<s> VAPCMD, I just posted photobucket links to the adapters I already have that came with it. </s>
<s> I just don't think the adapter will work properly with the card reader I have. </s>
<s> The adapter doesnt canter the card reader in the bay so it lines up with the grill cut-out part. </s>
<s> tray/face plate that came with the case don't line up ( and they should line up and mount properly ).....then try one of the other adapters. </s>
<s> Like you, I have a smartcard reader that would fit in a 3.5 floppy drive but I chose to put it into a 3.5&quot; to 5.25&quot; adapter tray (second link above) and it fits and installs exactly as intended. </s>
<s> Let us know how it works out. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Threat the 3.5in. </s>
<s> card reader like a floppy drive, they're practically the same size. </s>
<s> Any adapter for possible 3.5-to-5.25 bay opening is also possible. </s>
<s> Your case, may need to be disassembled for ease of access for both items for final assembly. </s>
<s> Also, I have found removing the card reader frt. </s>
<s> panel may help(most clip-in). </s>
<s> return when done. </s>
<s> I don't what is causing your problem unless you have an unique situation. </s>
<s> If the grill cut-out you mention is suppose to mount, it probably requires a flat surface or direct to be flush as in left alone. </s>
<s> The case may &quot;surround&quot; it but it should seat in the case itself, flush to the outside of bay. </s>
<s> -OR- that face plate is 5.25 mounting to surround the card reader as in extra venting. </s>
<s> But, if not in 5.25 bay, it becomes extra part. </s>
<s> Unless, you provide direct install pictures and not part links, maybe it could explain better. </s>
<s> From what you've provided it isn't clear yet, other than what I explained maybe the problem. </s>
