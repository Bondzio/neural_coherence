and the problem is still there (although the scanned image is back to the proper size--it still has the red, streaky lines).
I updated the driver, and the problem (red streaky lines like a special effect) is still there.
I scanned a white sheet of paper and the image did not have red streaky lines, but instead had a very thin blotchy green coloration.
My next question, somewhat hopeful: Does this sound like it could be a coloration problem?
Or is it looking even more like equipment failure?
Your thoughts much appreciated.
