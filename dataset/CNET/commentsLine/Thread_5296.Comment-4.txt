there is a lot more to consider besides the amount of ram dedicated to integrated graphics.
most onboard gpu's would not make good gaming machines.
be sure that the machine you buy has a dedicated slot for an add-on card.
if you find the onboard graphics are not up to snuff it is a simple matter of adding a dedicated card and disabling the onboard graphics.
most newer motherboards will see the new card, if not you may have to go to the bios and disable there.
i would recommend at least 512 megs of ram for a dedicated card and doing a bit of research.
the biggest makers are ati and nvidia.
both have good lower priced cards but nvidia drivers seems to support games developed with open gl better than ati so this is something to consider.
