1.1.1	Hello CNet , I recently purchased an XPS M1710 from Dell ( CNet 's review and user comments helped me decide to purchase it , and I 've been rather satisfied so far ) and have suddenly gotten the wireless network bug .	St
1.1.2	Now , at my house I have 3 computers .	St
1.1.3	The new XPS M1710 that I am typing on , a computer next to me that , unfortunately I dont have very complete specs on , as it was built from scratch by my brother-in-law ( It is his computer ) and my ancient Dell Desktop , Dimension 8100 , which has been continuously upgraded over the years .	St
1.1.4	My brother-in-law and I are both real big gamers , so when he visits on the weekends we like to waste a night on the LAN , so to date have used a Belkin F5D5231-4 ( Wired ? )	Ques
1.1.5	Router to service the series of tubes to both my old Dell Desktop and his custom rig .	St
1.1.6	However , now that I have a mobile laptop ( Notebook , whatever ) , I am interested in having the wireless option for the M1710 should I choose to move about my house .	St
1.1.7	I mentioned this to my brother-in-law , however he seemed rather opposed to a wireless router .	St
1.1.8	Both his custom PC and my old Dimension 8100 would need those network cards , ( Which equals more money , he tends to be very stingy with his cash ) , whatever , but my main concern is he claimed that Wireless Routers are inferior at transmitting my internet access .	St
1.1.9	Now I can certainly see merit behind that , but I still believed that in today 's fast-paced tech world there much be SOME sort of wireless router that can do the job .	St
1.1.10	However , a light bit of research seems to prove that general point- wireless routers are often restricted by how much Ted Stevens they can handle at once .	St
1.1.11	I did see mention of Routers that had both ports for the Wired Ethernet , as well as Wireless capability .	St
1.1.12	My question is : Is it possible to find a Router that would both have enough ports for at least the 3 wired connections to all 3 of my computers ( Including the M1710 Laptop ) , AND provide wireless internet to my M1710 when I choose to move about my house without the wired connection ?	Ques
1.1.13	Would switching between these two services be a nightmare ?	Ques
1.1.14	Or hassle-free ?	Ques
1.1.15	If this would be possible , where could I find a good router that provides both wired internet access as well as the option of wireless access for my M1710 , while not limiting my 3meg internet service , and how much would it cost ?	Ques
1.1.16	Anything over $ 100 is a bit pricey , but exceptions can be made .	St
1.1.17	My brother-in-law is an awesome gaming companion , but can be stubborn and hard to convince .	St
1.1.18	Is there any technological compromise to be had here ?	Ques
1.1.19	Sorry for the long-winded question , and thanks in advance .	Polite
1.1.20	P.S .	St
1.1.21	-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- If you need any more specs on the computers I will do my best to list them in a reply , but I did not want to make the initial request any more wordy than necessary .	St
1.1.22	I also apologize for any technically errors or mistakes I may make , as I am still a teenager and constantly trying to improve my understanding of the latest and greatest tools at our disposal .	St
1.2.1	The wired connection is some 100 megabit and even with every card updated that 108 megabit wireless connection is only theory and must be shared with all other wireless traffic .	St
1.2.2	Some gamers wo n't do this .	St
1.2.3	On the other hand no one I know has 100 megabit connections to the internet so all that bandwidth is just buffer from here to there and wo n't really be felt ( except by the most rabid gamers . )	St
1.2.4	I have no correct answer here but the kid connects over 802.11g ( just 54 megabit ) to a 20 buck di-524 from Dlink .	St
1.2.5	Yes they play online games but they do n't complain .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Almost every wireless router on the open market ( DLink , NetGear , Linksys , Belkin , etc . )	St
1.3.2	have four wired ports in addition to the wireless , so you should n't have to buy any extra cards .	St
1.3.3	Prices vary but are somewhere in the range of 40 to 70 USDollars .	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the replies , I appreciate it .	Polite
1.4.2	I 've tried searching around a bit more and hopefully found one that will work well : The Netgear WGT624 : http : //netgear.com/Products/RoutersandGateways/SuperGWirelessRouters/WGT624.aspx ( Not sure if I 'm supposed to do that , if not , my apologies ) Correct me if I 'm wrong , but it seems to have : 4 ports for wired Ethernet , so the Dimension 8100 and the custom rig can stay plugged in at all times , and the XPS M1710 can physically plug in when I 'm not up and about my house .	St
1.4.3	A 108mbps speed , or at least I gathered that , And the wireless network option for & quot ; standard 802.11g connections & quot ; .	St
1.4.4	-- -- - Now , the XPS M1710 , as far as I can tell , has & quot ; an Intel PRO/Wireless 3945 card , supporting A , B , and G bands & quot ; .	St
1.4.5	I 'm assuming that this is good news , but since I have zippo experience with wireless networks , I 'm taking tiny baby steps .	St
1.4.6	Now my only questions are : Was I correct in assuming this example router will correctly work with the XPS M1710 when it is operating wirelessly ?	Ques
1.4.7	And should I choose to use the physical ethernet cable ( and it will spend most of its life in this state , being a desktop replacement ) will it encounter any issues switching between being connected with the cable and then going wireless and back ?	Ques
1.4.8	Would this ... & quot ; confuse & quot ; either the router or the system ?	Ques
1.4.9	And would this router inhibit the capabilities of the physical ethernet connections in any negative way ?	Ques
1.4.10	My brother-in-law lives in a sort of & quot ; internet dead zone & quot ; where the only connection the ISPs have available to him is what amounts to a good old fashioned 28.8k modem , so he considers any loss in my 3 meg service to be a huge sin .	St
1.4.11	And finally , if anyone familiar with a Netgear router like this one ( or heck , any router situation similar to mine ) how would you rate the difficulties of setting it up ?	Ques
1.4.12	I 'm hoping for the better , but its good to be informed .	St
1.4.13	If any of these questions can be answered I would be most grateful , and I apologize for any lapses in my knowledge and/or manners .	St
1.4.14	( On a side note I managed to spell & quot ; technical & quot ; in my first post & quot ; technically & quot ; .	St
1.4.15	Golden star for me )	St
1.5.1	I do n't see any issues .	St
1.5.2	The Netgear router is the newer model of the one I am currently using .	St
1.5.3	Additionally , I switch between wired and wireless on my laptop and have never experienced any issues , including the other two laptops also .	St
1.5.4	One is a Gateway , one is a Toshiba , the other an Acer .	St
1.5.5	As far as setup goes , After going thru the learning curve , I find it somewhat moderate to set up .	St
1.5.6	The biggest issue is making too many changes at one time .	St
1.5.7	So my advice would be to take it one step at a time , make sure the last step implemented works properly , then proceed to the next step .	St
1.5.8	If all else fails , post here and you will get an abundance of great help to point you in the right direction .	St
1.5.9	Do n't get discouraged or frustrated , most of us have been there , done that , and will gladly help you out as best we can .	St
