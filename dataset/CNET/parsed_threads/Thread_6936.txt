<s> I am looking for the decent USB external soundcard for my Laptop with Logitech G51 that can perform well in my movie and music needs. </s>
<s> so far I am interested with these two: 1. </s>
<s> Creative Audigy 2 NX USB http://reviews.cnet.com/external-audio-ada...7-30580579.html 2. </s>
<s> Creative USB Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 http://asia.creative.com/products/product....9&product=17751 </s>
<s> If your machine runs an OS that is supported, I like the Turtle Beach units too. </s>
<s> near one of their showrooms, creative usually have them on demo. </s>
<s> Good stuff (especially the x-Fi) though it's quite awhile since they were out. </s>
