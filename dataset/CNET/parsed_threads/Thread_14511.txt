<s> I have an oldie-goldie PC on my network that is pre-PS2, uses a giant round Amphenol multi-pin connector for the keyboard. </s>
<s> I threw out the old kb when I went to USB, now, after a power failure, I find the CMOS battery is low and the checksum is bad, the BIOS asks me to &quot;press F2 to load defaults&quot; and of course it does not detect the USB kb. </s>
<s> Replacing the battery won't help. </s>
<s> Any workaround? </s>
<s> You don't!!! </s>
<s> Can you borrow a keyboad from some one??? </s>
<s> Does your USB keyboard have an adapter to convert it to PS/2 mini din? </s>
<s> If so them a adapter to conver it the 5 pin din might work, guess you should have keep the old keyboard. </s>
<s> Have fun, John </s>
<s> It's the old PC or AT connection and keyboards or covertors are still out there for you to use. </s>
<s> Your choice if it's worth the 5 bucks to bring the machine back. </s>

<s> I have a couple adapters, neither works, I remember having issues with this in the past, i.e., if the adapter doesn't come with the keyboard (or mouse for serial mice), it doesn't seem to work. </s>
<s> Worry not...it was time to decommission the old girl anyway, I have a spare PC. </s>
<s> Always fun building a new spare, thanks all. </s>
<s> Tony </s>
<s> Keypunch machine complete with sorter, Bob probably has one of them as well. </s>
<s> Teletype and punched tape. </s>
<s> Most of that went away a long time ago since I'm trying to give up on my packrat ways. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob's the only guy I can ask for help when the pilot light goes out on my server! </s>
<s> No problem I still have some blank IBM punch cards. </s>
