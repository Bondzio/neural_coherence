I like to listen to music while I work, so can I buy a $50-$60 2.1 Desktop speaker set and just plug the audio cord into the headphone jack of my laptop, before I buy some $80-$100 portable notebook speakers (probably the Altec Lansing XT1's)

I have all of Jimmy Buffett's CDs on my laptop, and a twenty buck set of speakers (powered, of course). Sounds awesome.

I just wondered if the audio cord on desktop speakers works if placed in the headphone jack on a laptop, since i don't have the typical audio inputs on my laptop.

The speakers have to be powered from from somewhere (takes energy to produce sound). It will either come from the headphone connection, from a wall outlet to the speakers, or batteries in the speakers. You need self-powered (wall outlet or battery) speakers because the headphone port does not provide enough juice to power standard external speakers.
