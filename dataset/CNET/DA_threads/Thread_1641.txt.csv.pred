1.1.1	Running a broadband wireless network with Netgear modem/router, two desktops, and one laptop.	St
1.1.2	Routine run of Spybot S&D today zapped my connectivity, and after three system restore operations, the problem is still there.	St

1.1.4	Indeed, running ipconfig shows the IP address and Subnet Mask as zeros.	St

1.16.1	After I restarted my pc (commanded from winsoxkfix.exe) It KILLED my Eset Smart Security 4 and it made my LAN and WLAN connection even worst, i thought this was suppose to fix the assigning network address thingy.	St
1.16.2	Luckily my pc had made a restore point so i restored it to a previous state.	St

1.18.5	Story: Last night I wanted to watch 'The Prisoner' on amctv.com, however, I live in the uk so could not watch it.	St
1.18.6	I downloaded AnchorFree's Hotspot Shield to hide my real IP so that I could watch it.	St
1.18.7	[When I installed it, my pc appeared to re-discover my wireless connection, although maybe that was supposed to happen].	St
1.18.8	When I quit Hotspot Shield, my computer said I was still fully connected to the network and internet, however no pages were loading, or email, msn etc.	St
1.18.9	This morning I reset my network and modem to try and fix this issue.	St
1.18.10	The 2 Macs connected back fine instantly, but my pc showed the &quot;network did not assign a network address&quot; error.	St
1.18.11	I have done countless reboots, ran Winsock XP Fix, ran ResetTCPIP.msi, set up my network again, and I must say I am stumped I called my ISP and they said they cant do anything if its just 1 computer on the network that isnt working, fair enough.	St
1.18.12	TCP/IP properties set to automatic.	St
1.18.13	DHCP is enabled.	St
1.18.14	Auto-configuration is enabled.	St
1.18.15	When I repair the connection and it fails, I go to status and get this: IP: 169.254.71.9 Subnet Mask: 255.255.0 Default Gateway: 169.254.71.9 DNS: [Blank] WINS: [Blank] From the help section on my ISP's website I found that the 169 in my IP address means that my pc failed to contact the DHCP server.	St
1.18.16	It has worked fine up until now.	St
1.18.17	This has been driving me nuts all day, any help will be greatly appreciated.	St
1.19.1	Well I disabled my network password.	St
1.19.2	And now I can connect.	St
1.19.3	Although when I enable the password I am get the good-old &quot;network did not assign a network address&quot; error.	St
1.19.4	This is with the correct password entered as well, as when a wrong password in entered it doesn't connect to the network at all like normal.	St
1.19.5	Anyone got any idea why I can only connect when I have no password?	St
1.19.6	Im not too happy about using an insecure network....	St
1.20.1	Thanks a billion Gakada for the Winsock Fix suggestion!	St
