I learned from HP tech support one call, that all HP printers have the drum as part of the toner cartridge (meaning that you don't ever have to shell out $150 for a drum, it gets replaced automatically).
But how about other brands?
Is this the way it is with all laser printers now, or do some manufacturers still make printers with drums that need replacing?
