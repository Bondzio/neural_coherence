1.1.1	I can get more details tonight , but I thought I might see if anyone has a clue as too what is happening .	St
1.1.2	I have a case with 8 HD 's in it ( for storing HDTV files ) .	St
1.1.3	A few nights ago I was looking at one of the drives from another PC using Remote Desktop and when I clicked on one of the folders , it said it was n't there ( do n't remember the exact error ) or that was not accessible .	St
1.1.4	So I went into the computer itself and looked , same error .	St
1.1.5	So when I restarted , it wanted to run Scan disk ( I think thats the DOS disk utility ) at startup .	St
1.1.6	SO it ran over night and when I went to look at it in the morning , the drive was empty !	St
1.1.7	It had 200GB of data on it .	St
1.1.8	This has happened to two other drives in the last few months .	St
1.1.9	I can get computer details later to help figure out the problem .	St
1.1.10	But I though some ideas might be on the top of someones head .	St
1.1.11	I wonder if it 's a power issue , cable issue , etc ?	Ques
1.1.12	I also have this computer in a & quot ; closet & quot ; with my cable modem , WAP and Router .	St
1.1.13	It 's also in the same closet as the water meter ( I think that 's what it 's called , where the water comes into the house . )	St
1.1.14	I wonder if it has some magnetic field that 's effecting the PC ?	Ques
1.1.15	Thanks , Jeff	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Many of the hard disk testing utilities are data destructive .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	Are you using a damage resistant file system .	St
1.2.5	If it 's FAT32 or such , loss is not unheard of .	St
1.2.6	3 .	St
1.2.7	Are you using a more reliable OS like Linux ?	Ques
1.2.8	4 .	St
1.2.9	Why could n't you reveal enough information so the forum can take a guess at a proper sized power supply ?	Ques
1.2.10	5 .	St
1.2.11	8 drives at about 20 watts each is 160 Watts .	St
1.2.12	Since most power supplies FIB about capacity , I 'd fit something about 4 times that value plus beyond reason ventilation .	St
1.2.13	6 .	St
1.2.14	IDE cables will be an issue in such an electrically noisy box .	St
1.2.15	I would only accept 80 conductor IDE cables if these are IDE .	St

1.3.1	Since hard disks are temporary storage space , you may want to review what the backup system is and how it failed .	St
1.3.2	Can you share why the backup system failed you ?	Ques
1.3.3	Others can learn from this backup failure .	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	I am using NTFS OS is Windows XP Pro My Power Supply is an Allied AL-A400ATX 400Watt All IDe cables are PCToys 80wire ATA133 cables .	St
1.4.2	Does that help ?	Ques
1.5.1	What kind of backup system can I used with almost 2 terabytes of data ?	Ques
1.5.2	I am in the process of backing up to DVD 's .	St
1.5.3	But that is gong to take forever .	St
1.5.4	I am considering a NEC 8X DVD drive for backups .	St
1.5.5	But I hear the 8X are not as reliable as 2x and 4x ?	Ques
1.5.6	But I will probably use it anyway .	St
1.6.1	But from your writing , you may just be revealing that you have no concerns about data retention ?	Ques
1.6.2	Bob	St
1.7.1	Along with what I read about your backup plan ( none ? )	Ques
1.7.2	it appears you have work to do .	St
1.7.3	Best of luck , Bob	Polite
1.8.1	No , I do .	St
1.8.2	I just had this happen before I can get the data backed up to DVD 's .	St
1.8.3	It will take a while with that much data to get it all on DVD 's .	St
1.9.1	Your choice on the backup scheme , but DVD seems like a poor choice since you may need some 40 or 50 disks to hold 2 TB .	St
1.9.2	Time to look at DLT .	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
