oh..i see... 1 more thing.
i read somewhere just now that the &quot;msconfig&quot; u could set the max memory or somethign like that.but when i try to set mine to 3gb, the maximum is only 2gb(2048mb).it wont let me go higher.
here's a picture of what im taking about,  and another question,=d,my computer actually can support window xp 64bit, should i format to 64bit?
does it affect my ram problem?
and from the link &quot;  &quot; it says that it doesn't really affect because 32bit can support up to 4gb while 64bit can support up to 128gb.so what do you recommend??
=)
