i purchased an hp pavilion a6110n which has 2.0gb of ddr2 sdram, and 320gb 7200-rpmsata hard drive.
i called hp support on another issue, and was told i would have problems with my new pavillion because the hard drive/sdram ratio was incorrect.
it should be 1.0gb of sdram to every 100gb +/- of hard drive.
is this true?
should i return the pavillion i have for something with a better ratio?
