1.1.1	While I'm waiting for a bluetooth adapter (BU-20) for my Canon printer to arrive, I've been reading up on &quot;making a bluetooth connection&quot;.	St
1.1.2	It mentions...&quot;A Bluetooth passkey (PIN code) is required for you to connect to the printer.	St
1.1.3	Please make a note of your Bluetooth passkey before you start the set-up process.&quot; Question: Will this &quot;passkey (PIN code)&quot; come with the BU-20 adapter?	Sug
1.1.4	Then is states: &quot;If you are connecting to the printer for the first time, enter the passkey for the device from the [Bluetooth Passkey (PIN Code)] window, and then click on the [OK] button.&quot; This sounds like a window will pop up with the &quot;passkey pin code&quot;.	St
1.1.5	If this is the case, why did they state &quot;make a note of the passkey pin code BEFORE starting the set up process?	St
1.2.1	If you want to use 12345 then that's your choice.	St
1.2.2	Here I use something else I made up.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	this will be my first time using a bluetooth device.	St
1.3.2	Is the &quot;passkey code&quot; limited to numbers only or can one use a combination of alph/numeric values?	St
1.4.1	It's just like a password you create on your accounts.	St
