<s> Hi I still have the 40 Gb hard drive that came with the Dimension 2400, however I have upgraded RAM to 1Gb and video card to Fx5200. </s>
<s> I read around and there seem to be a lot of things to consider such as different types of hard disks and maybe I am short on power supply and that the Dimension 2400 only has one power source for hard disk. </s>
<s> There is a lot more than that as well it seems. </s>

<s> A hard disk of around 100 Gb would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot in advance. </s>
<s> Google this: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=SUPPORTED+Hard+Drive+SIZES+Dimension+2400 finds this on the first page: http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/dimen_2400 It notes 160GB drives so with Dell's latest BIOS it seems you can support 160GB drives without further research. </s>
<s> If you need another power connection, there are Y connectors at the stores. </s>

<s> I'd upgrade your BIOS to the most recent and check to see if it mentions LBA 48 (48-bit Logical Block Addressing)? </s>
<s> If it supports that then you can get any drive you want. </s>
<s> Just buy one and hook it up as slave and see if your bios id's it as the correct size? </s>
<s> If it does your off and running. </s>
<s> If not buy this. </s>
