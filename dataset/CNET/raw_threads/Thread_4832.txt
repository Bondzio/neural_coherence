I've got a 2 month old 320GB Transcend Storejet mobile [one of those drop tested, unopenable ones]. Was working fine all this while, but I got a new motherboard fixed over the weekend and it stopped working ever since i connected it to the front USB drive. I got a 'problem with the USB drive error - malfunction - please try reconnecting or change device'. I tried using it in my laptop, but it does not get recognized anymore. I can feel the HDD starting and spinning as I connect it, but nothing else happens - the LED blinks for a fraction of a second when i connect it but thats all. I opened the comp up and found out that the guy had installed my front USBs with the +5V and GND interchanged. My other USB stuff work fine now, but I really need the data on my disk. Is there any way I can get it to work? I'd really like an idea please. Finney I

I wouldn't mind opening the casing to get the data but I'm afraid of losing both data and warranty on it... Do manufacturers help get data back if replaced under warranty?
