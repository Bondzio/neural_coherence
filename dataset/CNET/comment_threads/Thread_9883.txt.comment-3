I've looked into possibly getting a CMS product for my laptop.
Comes with their software program plus the back up hardware is a drive in itself, copying &quot;everything&quot; I have on my computer including programs and not just data.
Priced at close to $200....My T43 is 80GB but could get the portable back up system sized at 80, 100 & 120 - 80GB about $176, 100 and 120 not too significantly higher in price.
I'm a realtor and need to have a complete reliance on &quot;no loss of my work&quot; which has been years saved on this laptop; I'm virtually unemployed if this system goes down or I cannot retrieve and use it 24/7!
Is there another recommendation you could make for a better product around the same price range, CMS already pricey; CMS though seems very reputable...three year warranty with technical help should I need any.
Their retail outlets charge a little less, but only a one year warranty and may not be too much above something refurbished.
CAN YOU SUGGEST ANOTHER PRODUCT EQUALLY AS GOOD, or a better alternative than CMS?
