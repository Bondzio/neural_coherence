hi got unreal tournament 3 for christmas bin workin fine up untill today when i got a blue screen error i think the error was nv4_display.
manually rebooted , xp loads but when desktop loads this screen appears: [img= i installed the latest drivers for my graphics card the day of the crash.
think this might be the problem but can not get on to desktop to sort it out.
any ideas on a solution?
cheers system spec: xp sp2 intel pentium d 2.8ghz (dual core) geforce 7600 gs 256mb driver number 169.28 from  1gb corsair ram asus motherboard
