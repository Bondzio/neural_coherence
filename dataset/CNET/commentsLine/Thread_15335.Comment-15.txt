i understand what you are saying but i do not beleive your problem can be the &quot;extras&quot;.
i had a hard drive crash (after only 2 1/2 years)and needed to start over.
one thing i found was a faster computer because all of &quot;my junk&quot; was gone.
didn't have all the left overs from uninstalled programs, non used programs and the &quot;i am afraid to delete this for fear i will need later&quot; stuff.
with the install of the operating system again, witht the &quot;extras&quot;, i was still faster than when it crashed.
i actually bless the crash for cleaning my computer.
