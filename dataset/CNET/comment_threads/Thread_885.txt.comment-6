The fans are all running and I haven't made any recent upgardes for my PC.
There's nothing before or after the blank screen.
A couple of my buddies also told me that the problem might be the power supply but I'm not sure.
Logically speaking, if the power supply is not working properly then the whole PC wouldn't start would it?
