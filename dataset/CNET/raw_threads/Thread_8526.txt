Why?	http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?cc=us&lc=en&dlc=en&product=4232383 and the first thing is how to check for a chip defect. The ACER is the atypical XP netbook that has no redeeming features. With the intel GMA you find it can't play video full screen and well, why this unit is attractive must be on price alone. Bob
