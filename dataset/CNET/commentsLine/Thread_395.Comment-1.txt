hi guys, let's suppose i'm connected to a network whose admin asked in a friendly way not to download anything but certain things he specified.
he never came to my machine or setup any kind of client to it.
the question now is, is there any chance he knows what i download???
does he know the name and the extension of the file i download if i use utorrent and magnet links???
thanks for your help in advance
