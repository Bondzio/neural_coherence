from dell's support website:  maximum memory: 2 gb or 8 gb note: see &quot;addressing memory configurations&quot; to verify the amount of memory available to the operating system.
if using a 32-bit operating system such as microsoft windows xp, your computer will support a maximum of 2 gb of memory .
if you are using a 64-bit operating system, your computer will support a maximum of 8 gb (2-gb dimms in each of the four slots) of memory.
sorry, but you max out at 2gb.
