My video card is ATI Rage Pro, The computer is a Pentium 3 600mhz running on windows XP. I just need to increase the cards memory from 8Mb(approximatly) to 16 Mb to run Rise of Nations. Do ATI cards support these adjustments?

No.	A 64MB card is less than the game in question at http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=MX400SDR-64MB or about 35 dollars. You'll have to decide if its worth it. Bob
