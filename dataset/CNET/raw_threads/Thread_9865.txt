My friend has a wireless network configuration of a MAC being the main rig on the network connected to their printer (using DualBoot with Windows XP), but they just got a new laptop running Windows Vista and are trying to set up wireless printing over the network. Now, I've set up many wireless printing connections before, but this one just isn't working quite the way it should, and I'm inclined to believe that it's because the communication is being lost somewhere between the Laptop and the MAC. I enabled the printer for sharing on the MAC, named it, and everything. I then attempted to access the printer from the laptop, and it wouldn't pull up at all. Has anyone ever gotten a network configuration like this to work? Thanks for any help in advance.

While the usual gaffe is accounts, firewalls and more, the Vista train wreck is the need for the LLTD responder we note in our forum sticky. Without that you may need to publish some LPR server from your Mac (vs. MAC!) The other gaff is called CLIENT ISOLATION or AP ISOLATION (google that.) Hope this gives you some leads. Bob
