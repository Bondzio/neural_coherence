1.1.1	I am buying a new Dell 9100 from a reputable seller on Ebay .	St
1.1.2	It is loaded with everything I want except two things .	St
1.1.3	Sound card and IEEE 1394 port .	St
1.1.4	It comes with a intergrated 7.1 dolby sound card .	St
1.1.5	Is that going to be a problem running with some games or programs ?	Ques
1.1.6	Also is it easy to install a IEEE 1394 port ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thank you	St
1.2.1	The sound should be decent .	St
1.2.2	As for the firwire port , you can pick up a pci card for this , around $ 20 to $ 30 bucks .	St
1.2.3	Just be sure the machine has a few extra pci slots , in case you want to install a sound card or other upgrade at a later date .	St
1.3.1	but buying a soundcard and disabling your onboard audio will save your cpu power for the game ( you will get more fps ) .	St
1.3.2	as for firewire , most creative soundcards come with a firewire port , the Audigy 2 series so you get a fire wire port and a nice soundcard for the same pci slot .	St
1.3.3	konny	St
