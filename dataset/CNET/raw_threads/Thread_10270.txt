Can anyone tell me whether the speed of the more expensive on would be appreciable? The only thing they appear to lack is a Line out for connecting to a HIFI via a quality phono lead. If I connected a Toshiba Multimedia Center sound card would this be okay to connect to my amp and speakers (I have 2 good quality speakers, not surround sound) Thanks
