short answer: google away on this topic, its difficult at times.. long answer: the best install is starting to have a partitioned(virtual) hd or phyical hds ready to accept the oses.
you install the oldest released os, in your case xp, then vista.
but you have the added problem of a oem version vista.
usually that implies it wants to go where it *wants* to go and may not be redirected elsewhere.
thus, you need true full retail oses release for best install with least hassles.
i exclude any special or other needed s/w to make it easier or seemily so, but it does help for beginners.
it has been done, the google answers such.
