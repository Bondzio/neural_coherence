i had the same experience with one of my wd externals.
it worked fine on my new windows 7 desktop for a year.
then about three months ago my desktop started taking an extremely long time recognizing the wd, and eventually stopped recognizing it altogether.
i plugged it into my linux computer and it recognized the drive no problem.
there was nothing wrong with any of the data, so i've continued to use the drive on the linux computer.
i'm going to get another hard drive to back-up everything on the wd just in case this is an early sign of failure.
but i think the next usb drive i purchase won't be a wd.
