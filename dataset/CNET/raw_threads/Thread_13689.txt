CDBurnerXP pro offers 3 files systems, namely Joliet, ISO-level 1 and ISO-level 2. I found from Wikipedia that Joliet is Microsoft endorsed file system but if I am making DVD back-ups which file system I should go for? that will run on PC, Mac as well as Linux. Many thanks

If so, you should keep the same filesystem. However for a new DVD (recordable media) if you want it to be read in Windows XP, all the types listed do work. You'll discover very fast about filename limitations in ISO 1 and 2. But all will work just fine for file backup. There are some that will overanalyze but those are best shown the link to google.com Bob

So the major difference in all these file systems is only possibility of long file names, nothing else? or nothing else 'major' that I should be worrying about, right?? Just making myself sure!! Thanks

When you selected ISO 1, and then added files you would have learned quickly the limitations. But some want to know ahead of time. Be aware I avoid duplicating ready and easy to find web content. I will not tell you what these limitations are but that if you had tried you would have found them without having to record on the media. Bob
