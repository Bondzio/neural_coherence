i have long supported the use of western digital hard drives even when quantum drives were the most popular.
wd do have problems, i have replaced many , one the other day that had a mechanism failure after three years.
i have had a long run out of my ibm deskstar four years now and still going.
more recently i have purchased a hitachi 80gb that is quiet and fast.
a major problem with ibm deskstar drives about four years ago was due to internal condensation.
this has been fixed.
hitachi deskstar drives are good.
a local dealer stands by samsung drives with low return rates.
most local dealers promote wd drives.
