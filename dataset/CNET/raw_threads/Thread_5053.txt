I took this system requirements test and my graphics card was the only thing that failed the test. So my question is if I want to upgrade a graphics card, can i just upgrade to any graphics card or does it matter what my pc specs are? I have a Pentium 4, 3.06 ghz, 896 RAM, 146 GB hard drive, ATI RADEON EXPRESS 200, and i have a PCI express slot.

For example my system came with a 7300LE turbocache card listed as 256MB. It was configured to use 512MB.64bit memory interface. Most half decent cards now are true 256MB cards with a 128bit memory interface. The higher-end cards are 256MB+ with 256bit+ memory interfaces.
