I have an HP w2207h and a computer without VGA or HDMI.
The monitor only has those two hookups and my computer only has DVI-D.
I bought a DVI-D to HDMI converter and it doesn't really work sometimes.
When I start the computer, the signal is inactive.
I turn off my computer and try connecting to my previous monitor that had a DVI-D hookup.
The signal is there.
Then I hookup the conveter to the HP, and the signal is there.
What's up with this?
