Only big requirement is two sided printing ( i think this is called autoduplexing?). Would like wireless/network capability for two or three users, but not a must have. Thanks.

It has Ethernet and not wireless. Brother makes one with auto-duplexing and is wireless. I don't have the model # but it runs less than the HP. Keep in mind that, in the long run, it's toner that will cost your more. It's still far cheaper than inkjet cartridges. Good luck.
