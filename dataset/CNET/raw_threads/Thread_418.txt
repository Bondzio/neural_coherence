WinXP all updates dell latitude I have a wired LAN and a wireless network both can be active at the same time. Is there a way to tell a program which one to use, becasue sometimes the speed on one may be more than the other. Specifically i want my browser (opera) to exclusively use the wireless and other browser (IE) to use the cable LAN (but i think it already does that on its own) So the main question is, how to set opera to use the wireless all the time?

Your knowledge of the routing table and how to manipulate is key here. I won't discuss this until I know you're ready. Sorry, there is no easy button on this one. Bob

Such a topic is too big for this small space but detailed &quot;on many web pages&quot; and find books. There is no &quot;easy button&quot; for what you ask today. Bob
