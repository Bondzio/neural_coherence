They simply were getting too big too fast for a small company. The custom builder was great as long as the attention to detail was followed. However, once HP got into the picture, the sales numbers had to keep up and while the systems in general are good, they've become nothing more than warmed over off-the-shelf systems, just like everybody else. Looks mean nothing when you really got to the guts to get things done or remain stable. I can only recommend you check specs and your wants&needs before buying any system. There are custom cases that fit the gee whiz flavor of a hot system, but that's ones taste. tada -----Willy

I'd check out other boutiques like Velocity Micro.

Yes, building is cheaper, but boutiques don't rip you off.
