The fact that it can run win7 is a good sign that the system has some more life in it, but it has limited or will reach its end soon enough for a 5yr.
old system.
If possible add more ram, but that's about it.
A new system, plainly said, will have the latest goodies and continue to work as time marches on, so be happy with what you got until you decide to buy new.
That decision is more to what you feel you need for now, but while you mentioned it, you are really using the old system in a heavy way.
IMHO.
