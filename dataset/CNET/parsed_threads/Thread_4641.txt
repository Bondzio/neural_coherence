<s> I have a HP 2110 pcs all in one printer. </s>
<s> It was working fine. </s>
<s> Last week one of my kids was playing around on my chair that &quot;goes around&quot; and started to fall and used the printer to catch himself. </s>
<s> I thought everything looked ok and I am pretty sure I have used it since that happened but maybe not. </s>
<s> My printer works if you use it without the computer (tried that) did all the possible checks I could. </s>
<s> It has a error message that keeps coming up &quot;POWER SURGE ON HUB PORT&quot; &quot;USB has exceeded the power limits of the hub port&quot; My computer is working. </s>
<s> I checked the ports I figured when my son fell against the printer it broke the USB port in the back. </s>
<s> It does seem a little loose or something. </s>
<s> But I check the ports and the signal switches from one port to another. </s>
<s> I only have two things hooked up on USB ports. </s>
<s> I unhooked the camera, the camera works fine. </s>
<s> On the system try the printer picture is there and it says ready, but when you go into the dialog boxes it comes up disconnected. </s>
<s> So obviously I think I damaged the USB port into the printer? </s>
<s> If this is so is it something one can install on their own. </s>
<s> I'm not huge computer wiz but have fixed quite a few things on my own. </s>
<s> Is this an expensive problem? </s>
<s> Has this error done damage to my computer that I can't see at this point? </s>
<s> It's not burning out the motherboard is it? </s>
<s> Mine never made and sounds when I unplugged it and plugged it back in. </s>
<s> I've restarted, reset things, tried to reset the ports not happening. </s>
<s> I was just wondering if it is only the USB port on the printer itself if it was a situation I could handle myself? </s>
<s> Any advice or experise on this printer. </s>
<s> Oh yeah! </s>
<s> My computer is a HP Pavilion 503n and I'm running XP on it. </s>
<s> THe printer is an HP 2110 psc all in one. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help! </s>
<s> If I can save money and do it myself please let me know. </s>

<s> If you may notice, a too similar discussion at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7590-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=49633&messageID=642727 (in fact was top of my list here) noted a way to turn that off. </s>
<s> As to the ports, not enough detail for me since I can't open your PC and inspect for damage. </s>
