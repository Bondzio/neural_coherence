I have 3 hard drives in the system (2 SATA and 1 IDE slaved) I noticed the IDE drive was taking a long time to access so i restarted the pc and got a Floppy COntroller Failure error. I finially got past that screen but as the systemm was powering up i noticed the power button LED had started blinking. It would blink once quickly and not blink again for around 30 seconds or longer. Sometimes it would blink once and then twice very quickly. I disconnected the IDE drive and started up the PC again and still got the floppy error. This continued for about 2 weeks (with no help from Gateway because I'm out of warranty). During those 2 weeks the power led was still blinking but soon after i noticed 3 sets of blinkning. It would blink once, stay steady for around 10 seconds, blink 3 times, then right after 2 times real quickly. Gateway refuses to tell me what the blinking could mean, if its the motheboard, power supply, cpu or cpu fan. I deccided to try a few suggestionns i found after searching online, pulled all connections, bios battery and ram, blow out any dust in fans and coonected components one by one. When it came to connecting the IDE drive no floppy error, connected the second SATA (w/o the OS) no error, connected with OS error. Disconneccted and connected the IDE again it gave me error and so did the other SATA now. Inn the midst of doing all of this noticed the CPU fan slowinng downn, speeding up real fast on a cycle and all i was doing was connecting parts. I'm at my end here, Gateway cannt even do me the courtesy to tell me waht blinkning means (they suggestedd i do a factory recovery or replace the hard drive). When i get passt the Floppy Failure screen the pc is slow, sometimes it hangs when i move the mouse or open IE or a folder. Im thinking its the motherboard, but cant be sure. My SATA hard drives are brand new only 6 months old. I'd really appreciate any help, sorry this is so long. GATEWAY GT 5622 Windows Vista 3 GB Ram 1TB SATA 500GB SATA 500GB IDE

I'd move it back to stock or 1 hard drive since the power supply sounds to be under strain of the added drives. The floppy error is something I'd disable in the BIOS. Here we copied off all the floppy material to a 2GB memory stick then pulled all the floppy drives out of the office since support was killing our budget. We don't let the staff know we keep some USB floppy drive around just in case someone turns up with that dead medium. Bob

I've watched folk chase down error after error and it all lead back to the power supply. I'd pull the machine back to stock (one hard drive) and disable, remove the floppy drive. Bob

Some BIOSes will issue an error if we have the floppy set to some type and in another page have the floppy controller disabled. Bob
713	7	386665	3267708	3267141	sensibility	3/14/10 12:43 AM	1.26852738E12	i concur on the PSU	sounds like you have about 350-400 watts and may be pushing it to hard. go back back to stock configuration or upgrade power supply BUT check to make sure you do not have a proprietary PSU.. MANY off the &quot;shelf&quot; machines are powered just enough to run as they are designed. with about 20% to spare for usb or what ever. in other words for the most part they are almost maxed out right from the start. sounds like you have a corrupt file system or even virus. as for floppy get into bios and on basic settings many times where you set clock, disable floppy or remove. save and exit.

Still the LED blinking and pc sluggish. I even noticed that after defaulting the bios, i saw the audion controller was shut off. Can all of these problems be because of the motherboard? I dont see why defautling the bios would shut off audio controller. Is there any way to be sure it the MB? What are my options here? FYI: Power supply is 300 watts. Sound card integrated Video intergrated.

I have same config except for 500GB IDE drive (yes, I also installed a 1TB SATA drive) I recently replaced my CPU fan as the old fan was making a loud noise and I could hear the fan speed fluctuating too much. The first 2 weeks with the new fan was fine and now this issue of &quot;floppy error&quot; while booting up. Probably I have to start-shut the computer 10 times before one of the attempts results in it booting up. Also my on switch LED light no longer stays on. Last 2 days I am afraid to shut my computer down. Have you found the optimum bios settings or did you have to change power supply as someone above suggests. I really appreciate your reply. Thanks in advance
