1.1.1	I was naive in thinking my new computer would come with a firewire port - it did n't .	St
1.1.2	I also was unaware that even with a firewire port , I would need digital video , not analog .	St
1.1.3	SO , my question is , without replacing what I consider to be a very good graphics card , are there any good dedicated video capture cards out there that can stream analog video from a VCR or Analog video camera to my computer ?	Ques
1.1.4	I need the best quality I can get on a budget ( less than $ 100 preferred ) , because I already spent a load on the system I bought !	St
1.1.5	I look at ratings on Amazon and epinions , but most budget cards do n't seem to rate that high .	St
1.1.6	I would like to preserve my home videos in the best quality I can afford .	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.8	TIA !	St

1.3.1	Take a look at this one .	Sug
1.3.2	They offer more advanced models , but this one gives a lot of bang for just a few bucks .	St

1.5.1	I was checking out Ernies suggestion but was n't able to find anything about capturing streaming ANALOG video for conversion to DIGITAL .	St
1.5.2	This is why I suggested the other device .	St
1.5.3	I ca n't tell if that card has RCA in ports , which is what my camera had coming out of it .	St
1.5.4	I do n't have any other cable ports from my camera so I had to use the RCA to USB that VIDEOH offers .	St
1.5.5	After saying all of this , I may be incorrect about Ernies idea .	St
1.5.6	It may be just what you need .	St
