<s> I recently had problems with lightning which resulted in me having to have a new cable modem and ethernet card for my PC. </s>
<s> After both of these were replaced, I can no longer get a internet connection through my router. </s>
<s> If the cable is just hooked up to the PC, it works fine. </s>
<s> But if I hook it up to my router, I don't have a connection. </s>
<s> I have replaced the router and am still having this problem. </s>
<s> The modem cable modem is working properly, and all my connections to the router are correct. </s>
<s> Right now, I'm running on a Belkin Wireless G Router. </s>
<s> I also have a Linksys Wireless G router as well. </s>
<s> I am running on Windows XP. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what could be causing this? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> ON COMPUTER: Delete/remove the stored wireless profiles for connecting with the particular SSID name. </s>
<s> ON ROUTER: Turn on SSID broadcast on the router. </s>
<s> Turn off all encryption. </s>
<s> Turn off MAC filtering. </s>

<s> Results? </s>
<s> Wireless network adapter is wireless-g? </s>
<s> Wireless router is set to wireless-g? </s>
