I just built a new PC (Asus A8N, Athlon 64 3200, Corsair Value Ram, Msi NX 6600GT and my old 200Gb Maxtor). Already while installing, I encountered problems : the &quot; Error loading operating system&quot; message was resolved by switching translation method used to access the hard drive from the default setting &quot;Auto&quot; to &quot;Large&quot;. After that, I installed XP, without problems. Even though I was able to restart that install, as soon as I changed anything in XP (drivers, added SP1, ...), and was unable to reboot the OS: the message &quot; Windows XP could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM&quot;. This apparently means that the registry is corrupt. If http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307545 explains how to repair windows, it is useless, since there is something causing the corruption of the reg (I formatted and installed XP 3 times). But what ? Apparently, there is an issue with the HDD (see problem 1), which is a partitioned (50 Gb &quot;system&quot;, and 150 Gb &quot;files&quot;, NTFS). At the first install, windows sait that it had to check the files on the HDD, which lasted maybe 15 min (some where corrupt), something which I had never seen... (no probs with old PC) Another little issue is the 12 V supply which goes under normal value (at 11.45, in red in BIOS, which sometines causes the PC to stop at boot). Supply is 380 Watt Asus, which should suffice. I checked many forums about that 2nd error message; but no one seems to have an idea where it comes from (virus, spyware, memora issues, MB issues, ...). I already spent many hours on that machine, and I'd appreciate if anybody could help... Thanks a lot, Claus

Maybe remove the old, clear out that partition, do a new install and Windows Product Activiation. The new mobo certainly uses the 12 volts to supply power to the CPU's onboard regulators [the old one may have used 3.3 or 5 volts for that]. Does your PS have two separate plus 12 volt rails or just one? I would like a +/- 3% tolerance [0.360 volts], so going below 11.64 may not be too good. What tolerance does the supply show on its nameplate???

That 200Gb will be quite the troublemaker with an original XP (no SP1/SP2) CD. If you partitioned the drive before installing XP, it will likely just hang somewhere down the road. -&gt; Fix? Go make a XP SP2 slipstreamed CD to get the hard disk properly supported. Bob

The weird thing is that once I installed the OS, everything seemed to work, untill I rebooted. I'll try to borrow a friend's vesion. By the way, I cleared the old XP before I started install. About the Power supply: I'm not at home currently. I'll post the values tomorrow. Thanks all, Claus
