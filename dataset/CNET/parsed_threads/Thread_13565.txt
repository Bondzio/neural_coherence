<s> My computer has 2 optical drives (DVD burner and DVD ROM drive along with 2 SATA drives. </s>
<s> When I upgraded my video card to a NVidia 8800, the computer started shutting down intermittently. </s>
<s> My power supply was around 350W at the time. </s>
<s> So I hustled down to Fry's and picked up a no-name 500W PS that seem to handle the operation most of the time. </s>
<s> To be truthful, I did get a couple of shut-downs over a period of 6 months or so. </s>
<s> I almost never use the burner, but yesterday I tried to use it and shortly after starting the burn, the computer shut down. </s>
<s> Today I tried it again with the same results. </s>
<s> Once again, I'm thinking PS and perhaps trying one of the 600W-700W units out there. </s>
<s> My first question is &quot;Do you think a bigger PS will correct this problem?&quot; My second question is &quot;What model number should I get?&quot; While I would like to keep the cost down to under $50-$75, I would rather spend more money for a dependable PS. </s>
<s> I don't think my no-name 500W really pulls that much power. </s>
<s> Any input on this matter would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Some get fixated on CPU temp but I just leave the cover off for the test run. </s>

<s> Here's the issue with PSU, is that not only supplying the power but at a stable level. </s>
<s> Some suppose that voltage rails are also at risk as they cen supply only so much for all given devices attached, thus dual rails are mentioned. </s>
<s> The main thrust of a good psu is brandname and stable output because it is a brandname, dependable as it were. </s>
<s> If you don't buy a brandname then buy the largest wattage generic PSU to at least get lower wattage demands seemly supplied at stable level. </s>
<s> Your video card is very demanding and usually on the box it came in, suggest you have at least 350W(good PSU) to be usable. </s>
<s> But, as you see it does matter what PSU you get. </s>
<s> These brands are often mentioned, Antec, Enermax, Thermalake and Coolmaster. </s>
<s> But, really sometimes a high wattage unit is a good start, in 500W+ range. </s>
<s> The absolute best are from PCPower&Cooling, check their website. </s>
<s> Here's a help guide for selecting a PSU: http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/topic/66076/ Last, good(great) cooling helps maintain power levels as they do fluctuate under heat stress. </s>

<s> I tried that with no help. </s>
<s> I THINK I may have stumbled across the solution while I had the cover off the case. </s>
<s> My computer is plugged into a battery backup which always seemed to run fine. </s>
<s> When we loss the power, the backup gives me about 5 minutes to go through a normal shutdown. </s>
<s> If I'm not here, it shuts down the computer normally a couple of minutes before the battery dies. </s>
<s> Instead of using the battery backup, I plugged the computer directly into the household current. </s>
<s> When I was plugged into the battery backup, the computer would &quot;die&quot; after only getting about .2% into the burn process. </s>
<s> Plugged into the wall, I'm now over 10% of the way in the burn process and the computer is humming along, so I'm thinking the battery backup is NOT providing stable voltage when the computer is using most of it's hardware. </s>
<s> I'm also wondering if this is a common problem with battery backup systems? </s>
<s> If the burn is successful, I'm going to have to consider getting a bigger battery backup and I DO like that protection when running my system. </s>
