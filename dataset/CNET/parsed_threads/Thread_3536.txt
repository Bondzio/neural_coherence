<s> I have an old Dell and the sound card (Creative) went to the rainbow bridge. </s>
<s> I bought a Xonar DG after reading a lot of reviews, installed it, hooked into my 4.1 system, and everything worked great and sound great. </s>
<s> But I normally change back and forth between speakers and headphones for late night. </s>
<s> The Dell case has a proprietary front panel with a 10-pin straight line connector to a small board in the front panel. </s>
<s> The Xonar has a 9-pin headphone out, but now it's a bridge to nowhere. </s>
<s> I tried one of the typical 9-pin connectors with the screws on the side but it didn't fit. </s>
<s> Is it possible to (if I can find the right connector) just run a line to the 9-pin out to the front of the case with a 3.5 stereo female for the headphones? </s>
<s> Unfortunately, to plug the headphones into the back of the card, it is necessary to unplug the speakers. </s>
<s> Nowhere on the Xonar box is there a comment saying it's either/or, but such seems to be the situation. </s>
<s> Any suggestions short of putting my headphone away for good? </s>
<s> I suggest this -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Manhattan-Speaker-Headset-Audio-Switch/dp/B000K8PH8C Getting front plugs to operate is troublesome on a good day. </s>
