i was wondering if someone could give me the idea of the life of a typical , run off the mill dvd writer .
i have been using lg dvd writers since a long time on customer's pcs .
they have been good .
but recently i have seen that the dvd writers go bad after burning 20-25 dvds .
the model of the lg dvd writer is gh22ns50 .
now these writers are used on different pcs at different locations .
so i think i can eliminated bad power supply as the culprit .
also all the time the dvds were burnt at 8x or lower speeds .
any suggestions ?
thanks sam ps : specs of the pcs pentium dual core or core 2 duo asus motherboard with g31 or g41 chipsets 2 gb of ddr2 or ddr3 ram 450 watts smps
