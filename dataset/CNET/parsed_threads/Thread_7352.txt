<s> Have just finished putting together my new PC!!! </s>
<s> 4.3g 2g RAM 300g hdd 512mb graphics!!! </s>
<s> 2x 19&quot;widescreen tfts, 1x dvd rom 1x dvd writer drives, 520w case btw! </s>
<s> Last night all was fine (had yet to install dvd writer and fdd) new moniters running sweet! </s>
<s> popped the lid and connected dvdrw, fdd. </s>
<s> booted her up and it loads up went to my comp no cd drives (drong'go me hadnt set new drive to slave) did that whilst i was in there i also connected the silly temp probes from the cast up to the cpu hdd graphics, turned it on and 1st screen fine 2nd screen...1/2 way thru, power gone, turned its self off! </s>
<s> tried agen turned of slightly differnt place. </s>
<s> first i tried disconnecting dvd (both) fdd case fans etc to cut down on power - result, same next i had my NAS box 2xmoniters and comp on a 4 socket extention so i put the comp on its own - result, same i have also tried to disconnect everything the reconnect - result, same </s>
<s> and DO NOT reconnect. </s>
<s> Make the minimum possible assembly, check that it works and then add one item. </s>
<s> The best minimumm is with the mobo on a sheet of cardboard, but likely you won't go back to that. </s>
<s> You either have a hardware problem or the CPU is getting too hot. </s>
<s> Be advised that the mobo's power control circuit works even if the is no CPU/HSF, no memory etc. </s>
<s> Thus stip all things external to the mobo, Keep the front panel connections to the mobo. </s>
<s> Hit the front panel power switch and see if the power supply stays on as noted by seeing that its fan keeps rotating [assuming that the CPU/HSF is not plugged in. </s>
<s> Can't get past this point don't waste time trying to add anything, it won't help. </s>
<s> Solve this problem first. </s>
<s> Be aware that an ATX power supply puts the 5 volt standby voltage on the mobo any time that the supply is plugged into a hot AC plug [if switch on rear of supply is on]. </s>
<s> This power is what allows the mobo's power control circuit to work sans anything else. </s>
<s> cheers i will give this a try. </s>
<s> i have a sneaking suspicion it is the psu ist self which will mean after i have added x many things it will trip any way lol </s>
<s> in advance, often leads to poor troubleshooting technique, thus missing key info. </s>
<s> Best of luck.. </s>
<s> yeah i know this is the reason why i have asked the question on afew forums. </s>
<s> any problems in windows etc i can pretty much solve (spent 2hours reconfiging the GPOs in server 2003 on fri lol). </s>
<s> but am rusty with messing arround with hardware cheers </s>
