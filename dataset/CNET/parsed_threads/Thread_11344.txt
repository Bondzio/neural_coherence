<s> I am buying a notebook and I can't decide whats better? </s>
<s> The ATI Mobility RADEON 9550 or NVIDIA GeForce4 440 Go. </s>
<s> I will be playing a couple of games. </s>
<s> Based on what I've read in these forums, I go with Nvidia. </s>
<s> I see far too many posts about ATI drivers causing issues with Windows or simply performing poorly. </s>
<s> Nvidia seems to be more Windows friendly. </s>
<s> Best of Luck </s>
<s> Take it from a long time gamer, A+ technician, and computer business owner, if you want to game on a laptop, go with the Nvidia. </s>
<s> Unless you want to pay for a &quot;gaming&quot; laptop, you'll never get the same screaming performance out of a mobile graphics processor that you would out of an independant AGP or PCI-e card, but for the money, Nvidia is a gamers card, ATI's are for the Graphics and video editing guys. </s>
<s> The CineFX technology in the new Nvidia cards for pixel shading and the sort is second to none if you ask me. </s>
<s> Honestly, ther are those in this forum that will strongly disagree, very pro ATI people, but I personally, being a gamer, wouldn't use ATI to game with if you paid me. </s>
<s> I've lost count of how many people ignored my advice, and I ended up changing their cards to Nvidia because their games lagged on the ATI. </s>
<s> attempt to play all the top end games (off line). </s>
<s> Some of my grandkids do better than me. </s>
