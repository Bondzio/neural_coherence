It works. Now I have tried to install the software and driver that came along with the card. I get a message to install win xp sp1 before I can go any further. I am not able to upgrade my win xp to sp1. So what can I do? Appreciate any suggestions. M$

You can howver install SP2. If you can't do that then again, you're stuck. Unless you had problems in the past with the SP1 install, then no reason why not to proceed if on to SP2 as well. Its really needed into the many small improvements as those needed to better secure the system of the latest attacks out there now. Its prudent action to update provided you have orginal OS. tada -----Willy

The only way for USB 2.0 to be almost perfect is in SP2. Why not make a new post in the XP Forum and see if you can get help to get up to SP2? Bob
