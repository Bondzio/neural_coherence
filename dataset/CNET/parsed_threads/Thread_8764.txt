<s> - What password do you mean? </s>
<s> - Please give a link to a page discussing easy and hard reset of storage, because it's not clear what you mean. </s>

<s> http://www.ehow.com/how_2012292_reset-axim.html this is the link for the soft and hard reset . </s>
<s> The password that i wont to reset is for the EMC Navisphere Express . </s>
<s> The Dell Axim the link you give refers to is Pocket PC (PDA); pics on http://www.google.com/search?q=dell+axim+x30 for example. </s>
<s> The EMC Navisphere Express is a NAS-device from EMC2. </s>
<s> That's quite something else and your link isn't applicable to that at all. </s>
<s> I assume such a professional device came with a manual and a support contract. </s>
<s> So all I can say at the moment: read the manual and call your support company. </s>
