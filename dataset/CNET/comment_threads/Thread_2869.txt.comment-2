I hooked the Maxtor up to my Dell laptop, copied that archive, then hooked it up to my Desktop.
I am running XP-Pro on a Pentium with C: drive and 2 DVD drives (D: and E:).
The system found it and labelled it as F: ..so far, so good...
Created an archive directory, copied 4 folders, then had to wander off.
When restarted, the desktop can no longer find Drive F:, the Maxtor.
..bummer!...
Oh yeah, if I power up with the Maxtor attached to a USB port, the system hangs in POST..double bummer!!...
Have you TOO been thinking about getting an archival portable drive..?
