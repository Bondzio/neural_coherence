I'm wanting to add 1GB in addition to my current 512MB ram in my desktop...but my computer only has 2 slots for ram and both are filled with 256MB DIMMS.
Is there something &quot;out there&quot; that can combine both DIMMS into one DIMM slot so that I can add the additional 1GB I want into the other DIMM slot?
By the way, my memory is the PC2100 kind.
