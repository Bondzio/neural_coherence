my asus p4p800-se mb has four memory slots.
i purchased a gig of kingston hyperx(2x512) for the blue slots.
i received a gig of crucial ballistic ram for xmas for the other two slots.(2x512).
the computer seems to run fine most of the time except for a few little annoyances sometimes.
lately i have noticed that it takes for ever for my machine to post.
( i'm talking around 90 sec.
or more just to count the ram)!
at first i thought it was hung on the asus/intel splash screen because i have to press tab or del to see what is going on behind it, which usually doesn't work.
come to find out, i just wasn't waiting long enough.
it never does give the post beep btw.
then it goes into windows xp pro sp2 just fine.
i happened to run checkit diagnostics and found that there are &quot;memory allocation errors&quot;.
the only way i can get rid of the errors is to remove the second 2 sticks.
i've swapped the sticks around and i even tried a gig of generic ram but i still get the error if the second pair of sticks are installed.
what does this mean and will it cause any problems or can i just ignore it and use all 2 gigs of hotrod (ie expensive) ram?
thanks: mark mb- asus p4p800-se, processor-p4 3.2 gig windows xp pro sp2 memory- 2 sticks crucial ballistic(2x512) and 2 sticks of kingston hyperx (2x512) to fill all slots.
