1.2.1	The BIOS or the OS ?	Ques
1.2.2	The BIOS would not recognise any partitions in a hard drive .	St
1.2.3	If the OS can see the 8GB partition then it should be able to see the other partition , and how the drive is hooked up would n't change that .	St
1.2.4	Which OS ?	Ques
1.3.1	Partitions have no concept as to master and slave so that 's not a factor here .	St
1.3.2	There are old partition schemes that are incompatible with such moves ( to other machines ) so let 's pick from this forum 's top post and try the Ubuntu boot CD ( which requires no installation or learning of Linux . )	St

1.4.1	its running vista home and the hard drive does not show up in bios but 8 gig of the 40 show up as the j drive	St
