2998	0	54671	651859	NR	Kozman	1/2/05 11:19 AM	1.10466474E12	Processor Upgrade	Hello, I have an HP Vectra VL 400 desktop running a PIII 866Mhz Socket 370 with 133 FSB on an Intel 815 chipset. Can I upgrade to a PIII 1Ghz socket 370 with 133 FSB? Are there any compatibility issues and will I need to upgrade anything else (Bios...) Thank You
