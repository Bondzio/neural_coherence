Under the bios, verify the setting is set to 'AUTO' to best handle CD or DVD drives.
Verify that the DVD is master/slave jumpered, same as old drive.
If it presists, try another i/o cable.
Next, you can try doing a bios update as a last resort if the above doesn't work.
If you seem to have problems burning if you get that far, make sure you sue good quality blank media.
