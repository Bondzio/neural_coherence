That is the problem.
There is no contact info.
The Manual just says &quot;Contact your sales reprsentative&quot; Another statement it makes is &quot;Some computers may need special UPS monitoring software.
Contact your dealer for details on the various interface kits&quot;.
I bought this new from a discount store and was wondering if anyone here had any knowledge on this model of UPS.
I have see quite a few on sale.
Power Sentry 2200VA with an RS-232 interface.
