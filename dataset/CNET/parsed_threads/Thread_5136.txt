<s> Ok I am having a weird problem. </s>
<s> I've never needed to boot from my cdrom but I have Windows 7 on a boot disk (I'm pretty sure it's burned correctly and it looks to contain everything needed when I browse it). </s>
<s> When I go into the bios of my mobo to set the boot priority for the cdrom first it does not appear in the list. </s>
<s> What is even more odd is that there is a floppy drive on the list although my pc doesn't contain one. </s>
<s> Is this normal or did I manage to connect something wrong and therefore it thinks its a floppy? </s>
<s> The drive works perfectly when in windows vista so I am not sure what the problem could be. </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> Disc drive: Lite-On DH-4B1S Motherboard: Biostar something or other I am running Vista x64 SP2 currently and would like to upgrade asap lol ask if any other specs are needed. </s>
<s> (I built it myself so I very well could have made a wrong connection when installing the drive but I don't know) </s>
<s> But the model does look like a BD. </s>
<s> Since you paid for 7, ask for the factory made media. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Is the Win 7 an original disc or a copy ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Well, you mentioned you have a &quot;bootable Win7 disc&quot;, that suggests it was made by you. </s>
<s> if so, then if this isn't a factory or retail supplied disc, there lays your problem. </s>
<s> While, i certainly hope you tried the disc elsewhere to prove it works. </s>
<s> For Win7 install, you do need at least a DVD capable drive. </s>
<s> Yours is BD and should have worked. </s>
<s> At the same time, re-verify the boot order and if it doesn't see any CD(any type) then the bios got hosed. </s>
<s> While a FD in the boot order is OK provided it is part of the sequence, it need not be the only access to boot from. </s>
<s> Alas, if this Win7 disc is a full or OEM type disc, then again that may well an issue. </s>
<s> It either was done wrong or your PC is too picky. </s>
<s> Until, you provide the source or the means of how the Win7 was gotten, your support ends in similar matter. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Some specs: LiteOn's second generation of Blu-ray burners is the new DH-4B1S. </s>
<s> Its manufacturers call it &quot;Triple Writer&quot;, meaning that it can burn all types of optical storage media currently available (except for DVD-RAM). </s>
<s> BD-R burning speed is set at 4X which is a good speed - although not the best that you can find on the market.The drive can be connected to any PC using a Serial-ATA interface, ensuring that data transfer will never slow down the process of BD reading/playback. </s>
<s> The drive can burn BD-RE media at 2X, DVD+/-R media at 12X, DVD+/-R DL at 8X, DVD+RW at 8X, DVD-RW at 6X, CD-R at 40X and CD-RW at 24X. </s>
<s> Reading speeds are also set high, with the DH-4B1S being able to read BD-ROM media at 4X, DVD-ROM media at 12X and CD-R/RW media at 40X. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I have worked on PCs with BIOS that had some limit on the number of devices it would show in the boot order. </s>
<s> I had to disable the ones I didn't want in order to get others to show up. </s>
<s> Go figure...I couldn't. </s>
<s> As for the mysterious floppy drive, I suspect your BIOS isn't set up properly. </s>
<s> There may be an option to show whether one is present or not. </s>
<s> If it shows as present and you don't have the &quot;floppy seek on boot&quot; turned on, you may not get the usually floppy drive error. </s>
<s> In any event, see if your BIOS shows the floppy as present or enabled and change to not present/disabled. </s>
