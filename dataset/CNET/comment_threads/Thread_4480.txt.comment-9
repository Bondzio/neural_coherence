It is AOpen case..
I think its standard case, can't say for sure.
The power supply doesn't show any number or table.
I can't find anaything written on it.
So I don't know the power output.
There is only small label on the power supply written on it, QC pass ese 016316 then a table of number, and number 4 is ticked.
