<s> Three weeks ago I purchased a 19 inch widescreen monitor model #S199WFP from Dell. </s>
<s> Starting last week from time to time a thin purplish vertical line appears in the left quarter of the screen at various times and then disappears, sometimes for a few hours at a time but it always returns. </s>
<s> Tech support at Dell has been very poor, they requiring I keep a journal for a week to note every time the problem occurs and what I'm doing at the time, despite the fact it came with a three year warranty and I'm to call them at the end of that week if the problem continues. </s>
<s> My question is could it possibly be the video card causing the problem and not the monitor? </s>
<s> My system is a Dell Inspiron 530s which I bought five weeks ago. </s>
<s> Or could it be something else I'm doing? </s>
<s> I would rather not have to deal with the rude tech support from Dell of India. </s>
<s> Anyone else have issues with Dell Tech Support or is this just an isolated case? </s>
<s> Any help appreciated. </s>
<s> It's their problem and not yours. </s>
<s> Whatever you do or try, be careful not to do such that Dell might consider it as voiding your warranty. </s>
<s> About all you can get away with is to swap the monitor onto another PC or try another monitor on yours so see what happens. </s>
<s> I can't think of a connection issue that would cause this. </s>
<s> Do make sure you're using the native resolution of the monitor and defaults for the video card as far as refresh rates. </s>
<s> The &quot;3yr. </s>
<s> warranty&quot; is just another product they sell. </s>
<s> You have a problem, they should address it and since monitor is relatively new, go for the replacement. </s>
<s> Understand, you may not get a brand new monitor(you could) but one certified for use as &quot;refurb/rebuild/tested&quot; but will be fine for use. </s>
<s> Anyways, also you may want to get a &quot;monitor test pgm&quot; or similar o disaply test patterns to get tests done. </s>
<s> Your video driver pgm. </s>
<s> if ATI or nVidea should also do some testing. </s>
<s> The DX9 or DX10 can have similar test, type at run [dxdiag] no brackets, press enter check into all that, what are your results, act accordingly. </s>

<s> geofos, In your other comment ( http://www.news.com/5208-10784_3-0.html?forumID=1&threadID=36256&messageID=391105&start=0 ) I offered to help you get the monitor replaced. </s>
<s> I just found this thread and wanted to reply here as well to make sure you saw. </s>
<s> From what you describe it sounds to me like the problem is with the monitor itself. </s>
<s> Steven Haninger's suggestion to try the monitor on another computer and/or another monitor on your computer would help confirm whether the problem was the monitor or not (if the problem follows the monitor then the monitor is the problem). </s>
<s> If you still need help getting it replaced please contact me (customer_advocate@dell.com) and I'll be happy to help you. </s>

<s> Larry the Dell Customer Advocate who responded to my post took care of the problem quickly; I received the replacement monitor today. </s>
<s> It doesn't show well for Dell that to get help I had to start a thread on CNET, but Larry exemplified great customer service. </s>
<s> Thanks Larry </s>
<s> I'm glad I could help get things with your monitor properly taken care of. </s>
<s> I agree that things could (and should) have been taken care of better before this, however, I have passed on feedback about what happened so we can take steps to try and improve things. </s>
