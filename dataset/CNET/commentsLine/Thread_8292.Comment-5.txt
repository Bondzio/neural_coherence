i feel it would depend on your line of work.
if you work in the corporate world, then i would suggest getting a laptop from dell or hp or some other company.
if your line of work is more informal or more personal, like you work by yourself or use the laptop as more of a personal computer while doing some work on it, i would suggest the apple laptop.
it doesnt really matter about the software running on the computer anymore, unless its a very complicated software, more software is able to run on both types of laptops.
all computers can run windows now, but in the corporate world, its better to have a windows based pc.
an apple based pc is more simple and personal, but can also dualboot to windows for running additional programs.
