i think that is why it is still a mind set for some techs.
windows nt x32 bit used to be limited to 32 gbs of addressable hard drive space.
i don't think that was true anymore for xp past sp3, but i could be wrong.
i swear, i never had a problem with my 250 gb internal ide storage drive, on xp home w\sp3, anyway.
