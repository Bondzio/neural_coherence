i downloaded my osx on free bsd because i was following written instructions and missed something.i want to load it onto my hard drive where it belongs but don't know what to do or how to do it.i have all files backed up but don't really care about if they have to go to do this right.i saw a message on this site about macs and initializing the hard drive before installing osx.evidently i'm not alone in missing this step or not realizing it was even there.i am a complete novice and need step by step instruction as to how to proceed.any help will be greatly appreciated as the way things are now i never know what's going to screw up next.i do have an account at a on line poker site i'd like to keep but most of what i do i back up right away.
