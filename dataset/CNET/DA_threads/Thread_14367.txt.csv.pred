1.1.1	Hello -- I really want to upgrade my old PIII 700mhz dell computer.	St
1.1.2	I know that most I can jack it up to is 1ghz, but that's fine.	St
1.1.3	My issue is that my computer uses a 100 FSB, and the 100fsb model of the processor is more rare (and expensive) than the 133mhz.	St
1.1.4	Can I put a different FSB-speed CPU in my computer?	St
1.1.5	?	Ques
1.2.1	might as well save up for a new pc	St
1.3.1	Don't, as the above says time for a new PC.	St
