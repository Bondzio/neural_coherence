<s> I have a Gateway GT5622 and I am planning on setting up a home network and using the desktop as a file server/media streamer. </s>
<s> I have a realtek ethernet attached to the motherboard. </s>
<s> According to the specs on the Gateway website and on the specs for my motherboard it is 10/100, but in my device manager it says gigabit. </s>
<s> How can I tell if I have gigabit or not? </s>
<s> Would a PCI networking card give me better network performance? </s>
<s> Do you have a Gigabit router? </s>
<s> Is your network going to be all wired with all computers having Gigabit NIC cards and using cat5e or cat6 wire to network them. </s>
<s> If the answer to the above is yes,then there will be a improvement over the 10/100 setup. </s>
<s> The Gateway website shows your computer as having 10/100, but the PCI Gagabit cards are pretty cheap and easy to install. </s>
<s> Everything is going to be wired with a gigabit router. </s>
<s> The reason I'm not sure about the computer is that even though the motherboard says it only supports 10/100, in the device manager it says I have &quot;Realtek RTL8168B/8111B family PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC (NDIS 6.0)&quot;. </s>
<s> I know that it is built on to the motherboard. </s>
<s> Just checked my sons HP computer that I know is 10/100 and it too shows Gigabit in the device manager. </s>
<s> I can go into control panel-network-show status and it shows 100. </s>
<s> I can do the same on my Dell that I know is Gigabit all the way through and it shows 1.0Gbps. </s>
<s> As I said on my previous post, PCI 10/100/1000 NIC cards are pretty cheap and are almost plug and play. </s>
<s> I would definitely go that route because you will know everything is Gigabit and no gray areas. </s>
<s> I believe I paid $22.00 or $23.00 for the last one I bought at Staples. </s>
<s> You can actually get them cheaper online, but have to worry about the shipping cost as well as the time. </s>
<s> I just checked the network status and it also shows up 100. </s>
<s> That's what I wanted to know. </s>
<s> Glad your question has been answered and thanks for posting back. </s>
