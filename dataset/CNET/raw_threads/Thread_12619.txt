On the install screen it says nothing is attached (and it is) if I try to install printer all I get is the little screen saying &quot;updating hardware database&quot; but it is NOT RESPONDING........... I just don't know what to do, can ayone advise me. I'm not a computer buff so no fancy language, plain simple english :o) I'm using windows ME

It's a bug in Windoctor that was never corrected by Symantec. Here's when I first reported it some 4 years ago. http://www.bugnet.com/alerts/bugalert_010110.html Links about the issue are provided, but if you wait long enough the dialog box finishes and the device will install.
