1.1.1	I have a problem that I've assumed was with my Internet service provider, but I'm beginning to believe that it's the result of a problem with my Netgear WGR614 (v6) WiFi/wired router.	St
1.1.2	After rebooting the cable modem, the router, and the PC, I get the advertised 4000Kbps download speed.	St
1.1.3	After half an hour or so, it's down to 2000Kbps.	St
1.1.4	Within hours, the speed is less than 100Kbps (no, I'm not missing a zero there) and sometimes is as low as 30Kbps.	St
1.1.5	The results of restarting individual components have been inconclusive at best, as have searches for trouble reports regarding the router.	St
1.1.6	If others have seen this problem or know either that it does exist (or that it doesn't) that information would be helpful as I wrestle with my ISP.	St
1.1.7	I'd like to pin the problem on the actual cause of the problem and fix it.	St
1.1.8	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	All of these had a LEECH using their wifi system.	St
1.2.2	To fix it we first disable the WIFI and get wired.	St
1.2.3	For wifi there is some issue with P2P apps so to fix that we get wired.	St
1.2.4	For the other issues we enable SSID broadcast and use WPA.	St
1.2.5	Sorry if this is so much to swallow in so few words but I can't write novels for each post like this.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks, Bob.	St
1.3.2	I'm fairly certain there's no leech involved here.	St
1.3.3	* Currently I'm testing a direct connection to the cable modem.	St
1.3.4	This will either confirm or refute my original theory that the problem is the cable modem or the ISP.	St
1.3.5	Once I get past that, if it's not the cable modem or the ISP, I'll need to start looking for local causes.	St
1.3.6	*I have reasons for thinking this, including the fact that the neighborhood is made up of people older than I am, and I'm old enough to remember when dirt was in beta test.	St
1.4.1	Would be used by any compromised windows machine since there is no security.	St
1.4.2	It seems I'm teaching more about security today that doing any real repairs.	St
1.4.3	Remember, it's not people I'm finding to be the leech... Bob	St
1.5.1	Bob, I know that out of the box the security is crap.	St
1.5.2	I've fixed that.	St
1.5.3	There is no leech here.	St
1.5.4	Although Ive thought that the problem was not within the LAN, Ive had this back-of-my-mind suspicion that maybe it wasnt Wide Open West.	St
1.5.5	Maybe it was the router.	St
1.5.6	I disconnected the router, connected the desktop system to the cable modem and At 3:37 pm on Saturday, July 21, 2007, immediately after rebooting the modem and the computer and after taking the router out of the picture, I saw 4309Kbps.	St
1.5.7	This makes it look like it might be the router after all.	St
1.5.8	But less than half an hour later (with the desktop computer still connected directly to the cable modem) my downlink speed is a quarter of what it was.	St
1.5.9	Eight minutes later, the speed dropped to 684Kbps (this is still a direct connection to the cable modem -- no WiFi; no leech.)	St
1.5.10	So I withdraw my question.	St
1.5.11	The problem is clearly not with the router.	St
1.5.12	Not with a leech.	St
1.5.13	The problem is squarely in my ISP's court.	St
1.6.1	Just a note.	St
1.6.2	- New!	St
1.6.3	by R. Proffitt Moderator - 7/21/07 2:07 PM In reply to: It's not a security issue by pebkac179 Unless you share what security settings you used I can't drop that area.	St
1.6.4	I'll share a link where I reveal WEP and MAC filtering is dead.	St
1.6.5	Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=242736&messageID=2457489 I've also used the 614 so unless you have one with ancient firmware or it's busted I don't think the error is there.	St
1.6.6	To summarize use WPA and broadcast the SSID.	Sug
1.6.7	Some find the speed or connection drops if they disable the SSID broadcast.	St
1.6.8	Eight minutes later, the speed dropped to 684Kbps Is this some P2P app?	St
1.6.9	Some are unaware about ISPs that do bandwidth shaping.	St
1.6.10	Sorry if this seems nosy but it's something you might want to know about.	St
1.6.11	Here's a link that notes a few ISPs that do this -&gt; http://www.azureuswiki.com/index.php/Main_Page See the article on Traffic Shaping.	St
1.6.12	http://www.azureuswiki.com/index.php/Bad_ISPs Is your ISP on this list?	St
1.6.13	Bob	St
1.7.1	and I updated the firmware http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/wgr614v6.asp Broadcast SSID WPA security do NOT use Mac address filtering I have elcheapo DSL.	St
1.7.2	I connect at 54.0 Mbps on the router and my download speed is aroung 90 Kbps.	St
1.7.3	Did you update the firmware and follow Bob's advice?	St
1.7.4	Rick	St
1.8.1	Maybe I'm not being clear here: WiFi is NOT in the picture at this point.	St
1.8.2	The router is not connected to anything.	St
1.8.3	The computer is connected directly to the ISP's cable modem and I'm seeing the same degradation I saw when the router was in the picture.	St
1.8.4	The means (at least to my feeble mind) that the router isn't involved.	St
1.8.5	Wide Open West (aka &quot;Wowway&quot;) provides http://www.dslreports.com/ as a place to check uplink and downlink speeds.	St
1.8.6	Wow may not be the sharpest ISP in the tool kit, but it doesn't show up on the AzureusWiki list.	St
1.9.1	for the firmware for you isp's cable modem.	St
1.9.2	Rick	St
1.10.1	The desktop computer is connected directly to the cable modem.	St
1.10.2	The router is out of the picture.	St
1.10.3	Disconnected.	St
1.10.4	Not turned off, but it might as well be because nothing is connected to it.	St
1.10.5	Nothing at all.	St
1.10.6	Would updating the firmware of a router that's not connected to anything have any effect?	St
1.11.1	If there is some P2P software in use.	St
1.11.2	That is where most are complaining since many ISPs are adding shaping.	Ques
1.11.3	Bob	St
1.12.1	Sorry.	St
1.12.2	I missed &quot;If there is some P2P software in use.	St
1.12.3	That is where most are complaining since many ISPs are adding shaping.?	Ques
1.12.4	No P2P.	St
1.13.1	NIL	St
1.14.1	I measure speed using the tool that Wide Open West provides to their clients.	St
1.14.2	I provided the link in an earlier post.	St
1.14.3	Here it is again.	St
1.14.4	It's a fairly standard speed test: http://www.dslreports.com/	St
1.15.1	This is not a good format to hold all the info so if I miss a detail or you don't answer a question then I ask.	St
1.15.2	It appears to be something between you and your ISP to work out at this point.	St
1.15.3	Bob	St
1.16.1	And that's the direction I'm headed.	St
1.16.2	Wow had sent &quot;technicians&quot; to diagnose the problem, but they claimed it was my router.	St
1.16.3	Today when I took the router entirely out of the picture, I revealed their lies for what they are.	St
1.16.4	With a direct connection (no router involved) my current connection speed is below dial-up speed (32Kbps).	St
1.16.5	I've attracted the attention of some Wow corporate folks, so I'm hoping that they'll actually fix the problem now, not just lie about it.	St
1.16.6	Thanks for the help and the thoughts.	St
