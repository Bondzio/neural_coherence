One is to share resources and the other to share an internet connection.
The &quot;best way&quot; depends on what your goal or plan is in this regard.
First, however, you need to connect all devices to a switch for them to work together and a router to get to the internet.
Most routers contain switch ports...generally 4 of them.
When you have laptops, you need to know how portable they need to be within your home as this determines whether you can use them as hard wired (which is best) or wireless.
So first you decide what you want the network to do and then you get the necessary hardware and make all the connections.
The fun part comes next...getting them all to cooperate with you.
