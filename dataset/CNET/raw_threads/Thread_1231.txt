As those files were not important, I chose to format the HDD. After either &quot;Quick format&quot; or Normal format, the HDD now shows there's no files, but still a 128MB used on the HDD. What is this 128MB used, and how can I get rid of it? I thought if they're some system files, it'll be just a few MB used? Thanks, Ctmap
