1.4.1	Overclocking can boost your computer 's performance in a huge way .	St
1.4.2	But you need to study up on your computer and see what you should expect out of your hardware .	Sug
1.4.3	Although there is a great benefit from overclocking , at the same time there is a risk of damaging your hardware if not done properly .	St
1.4.4	Good Luck ! !	St
1.4.5	!	St
1.5.1	Yeah , that would be where you would overclock .	St
1.5.2	A few more settings , but that is the beef of it .	St
1.5.3	Now , you want faster games , right ?	Ques
1.5.4	Then mainly focus on overclocking your GPU , which is much more simpler and will give you the larger benefit .	St
1.5.5	Bumping the CPU will help some , as it is a probable bottleneck , but do the GPU first .	St
1.5.6	If it is n't what you are looking for , try the CPU .	St
1.5.7	But please , do n't just go into the BIOS and start changing settings .	Sug
1.5.8	Please read the *many* guides on the internet .	Sug
1.5.9	They 'll show you how in a few minutes .	St
