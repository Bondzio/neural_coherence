first off my system specs- &lt;span&gt; 8gb kingston, hyperx x2 grey ddr3 ram &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; xfx, radeon hd 6950 1gb gpu &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; samsung 1tb spinpoint sata &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; lite-on, blue-ray disk combo drive &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; msi h67ma-e45 mobo &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; thermaltake tr2 standard 500w power supply- 24 pin &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; intel core i7-2600 quad core 3.4ghz &lt;span&gt; now for my problem- (i don't know a ton about computers, but i'll try to describe it to the best of my ability) a few weeks ago, my pc started cutting off without warning- then it would boot back up and either run fine or cut off again within 10-30 mins.
i set my computer to not cut off if it encountered a problem with the ram, instead it would show the blue error screen- haven't seen it yet, so i'm assuming it's not that.
i've also heard that software issues can cause a system to fail, so i'm booted into safe-mode at the moment.
should i just do a full re-install of windows and see if that helps?
a few hours ago, my pc cut off and attempted to reboot and cut off a few seconds into it.
then repeat.
i had to flip the power switch in the rear to stop the process.
is it safe to continue using or should i leave it be until i can figure out the problem?
i've heard that power supplies in general can be prone to failing after short periods of time, i've only had this build for about 4-5 months.
any help would be great, i'm pretty lost at the moment.
