1.1.1	OS : Windows XP Professional Drive : Standard 48x/16x/48x CD RW drive ALthough the LED lights on the outside of the drive are on , which means that is recieving power , when I push the eject button the cd draw does n't eject , instead the drive just makes a buzzng noise .	St

1.2.1	This is frequently due to the gears inside getting jammed or off track .	St
1.2.2	In the front of the drive is a very small hole , big enough to put in a straigtened paperclip .	St
1.2.3	Put one in and it will push the drawer out and open .	St
1.2.4	Sometimes opening and reclosing it will fix the problem with it ejecting , other times you just trash it and buy a replacement ... since they are in the $ 25 range these days .	St
1.3.1	Thanks a lot !	St
1.3.2	This sorted the problem right away .	St
1.3.3	No replacement needed !	St
