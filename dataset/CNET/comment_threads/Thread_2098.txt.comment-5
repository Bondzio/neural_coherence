Exactly what i was thinking.
can i change the bios to read the new cpu?
If so can you tell me how?
And as to the fan thing i dont have a clue why it doesnt fit the old system was a alu block mounted to the cpu with the fan mounted to the casing.
The new systems clamps are completly different to the old.
