I have a Netgear WPN824 wireless router and three laptops.
The newest laptop is about 2 years old.
I know that the recommendation when enabling wireless network security is to not use WEP because it is too easily broken.
Assuming that I am using a router that supports higher protocols, how can I tell if my wireless devices support the higher protocols as well?
If not, is it just a matter of upgrading firmware or would I have to replace the device?
