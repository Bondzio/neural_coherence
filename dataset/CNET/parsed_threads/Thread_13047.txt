<s> I have a 'husband' built system... </s>
<s> I'm running Vista Ultimate, SP1, on a AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4600+ 2.4 GHz. </s>
<s> I have 2 GB of memory, 32-bit OS. </s>
<s> I have 2 HD's (250 GB each), and for Christmas, my husband picked me up a 1.5 TB WD Hard Drive. </s>
<s> He hooked it up (in the case) and then told me how to add it, going into Computer Management, formating it, etc. </s>
<s> The problem? </s>
<s> It's been stuck at 73% for HOURS... </s>
<s> I started the formating last night, around 10pm.... it's almost 9pm here, and it's STILL formatting. </s>
<s> I've shut down everything, and it's STILL Formating. </s>
<s> I did the full format, (not the simple), per his instructions. </s>
<s> Anyone have any suggestions? </s>
<s> If I do such a thing I do the quick format but then again I'll remove the partitions, create it and then the quick format. </s>
<s> But that's how I run my show. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What did he say ? </s>
<s> Think I'd try Bob's suggestion. </s>
<s> Shut it down completely, Restart it, go to Computer Mgmt, Disk Mgmt, Delete the existing partition, recreate the partition, and then quick format. </s>
<s> VAPCMD If you have any further problems with the WD drive .... download WD's Diagnostic SW and test the drive to make sure it's OK. </s>
