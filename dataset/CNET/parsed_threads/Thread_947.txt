<s> I am trying to find a laptop for my sister who wants a laptop to type things up, watch movies, and burn cds and dvds. </s>
<s> My budget is around $1300 and I think I found a good deal on this dell laptop http://ecomm.dell.com/dellstore/popups/popup_sys_details.aspx?itemtype=&s=dhs&l=en&cs=19&c=us&item=361635ff-6f7a-4e54-a89b-b5e5aa751463&cart=MySavedItems (if for some reason the above link does not work, here is a pic of the specs) http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/7562/laptopbe6.png My questions are: will this dell draft n wireless card work with any wireless router? </s>
<s> And is there any other laptop that would be better considering the criteria? </s>
<s> Or is this laptop good to go? </s>
<s> 802.11b and 802.11g routers. </s>
<s> You can always find a router it won't work with which is a non-issue since I've experienced that with 802.11b/b cards too. </s>
<s> Usually a firmware update to the router is the fix. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
