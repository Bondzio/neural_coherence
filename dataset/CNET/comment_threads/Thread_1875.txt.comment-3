Sorry, the correct model number is F5D9230-4, Ver 3100.
What is weird (at least to this novice) is that when I set up the router, it stopped letting me connect through the normal DSL connection at all.
It seems to now connect through the local area connection.
As I write this, I am connected to the internet, but my PPPoE connection says disconnected.
The only connection working right now is the local area connection.
