i am wondering if anybody has heard anything about what i am trying to do here, or if you think it would even be possible.
my cell phone (nokia 6010) has the normal handsfree jack (1/8&quot; slot), and i was thinking that since a handsfree accessory has the normal send and receive plugs that it might be possible to splice that into a rj11 jack so i could use the cell phone for data via my modem.
i have unlimited minutes, but the data transfer costs money.
if i could use my cell phone just like i would a normal home phone line with a rj11 input then i would in essance be cheating the system.
all the phone company would see would me be on a voice call.
from there i could either try and have the computer dail an isp (probably not possible) or manually dial the phone and then connect that way.
is this even possible?
or am i going to blow up my phone in the process?
thanks for your help and advice, brandon
