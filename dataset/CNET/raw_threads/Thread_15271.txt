The length of wire [printed circuitry limits what speed a signal can be sent and arrive at the other end and still be useable]. Inside the CPU the wire length is close to zero] The wiring on the mob is much longer thus the speed is severely limited In general they use the memory clock to talk to the CPU, but inside the CPU they multiply that clock by a factor to get the internal clock speed that the CPU runs at. Regarding using speed as an indicator of performance you get into the issues of comparing Intel CPU's versus AMD CPU's where much lower clock speed AMD CPUs outperform the faster clock speed Intel P4's. The performance is determined by the total architecture design of the CPU and the supporting chipset, clock speed in only one of the many parameters.

In order to get good processing performance they had to increase the clock speed. This increase comes at the expense of power consumption [heat generation]. The temp problems got so bad that they could not combine the top speed P4's into a Dual Core because there was no way to cool it other than water cooling. Intel when they went from 130 NM cores to 90 NM cores acheived zero power reduction. Intel is in the throes of redesigning their entire line to shorter pipelines lower clock speeds to get the temps under control. They just came out with an interim 65 NM device, an obvious half baked interim solution [read about it in tomshardware] they didn't include any temp prtection which was their hall mark, will add it in a few months. It reduced the power by 10% the AMD's are another 25 % lower. If Intel wasn't such a huge/rich company they would be in trouble. The new line will be somewhat based on the Pentium M which for notebooks was an excellent low power consumption design. AMD went to SOI [silcon on insulator chips] when they went from 130 NM to 90 NM, reduced their power from 86 watts to 68 Watts. The insulator reduced leakage currents greatly.

387	7	150184	1673227	1672813	Nuclearwasteland	1/15/06 3:26 PM	1.13733876E12	You can buy it	Variety online sites have it such as newegg have it; need to check if Aalienware offers it.
387	8	150184	1673231	1673227	Ray Harinec	1/15/06 3:29 PM	1.13733894E12	Oh, when you were edddie	fromalienware, I thought that you worked for them and would know their products.
