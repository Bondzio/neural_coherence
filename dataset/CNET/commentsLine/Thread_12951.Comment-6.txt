start here....  and decide which card(s) you like based on the specs, the user reviews, your budget, etc., and then go to  at tomshardware.com you can compare how these cards perform on some of the same games.
from there...well, that's up to you but i don't ever buy my hardware at ebay.
it's hard to be sure you end up getting what you thought you bought.
not so with a good internet vendor like newegg.
