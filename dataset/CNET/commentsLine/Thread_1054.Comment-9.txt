that seems to be an odd modem---why a modem---you should have a wifi router and a wifi interface nic....voice wireless gateway?
maybe if you are running voice applications mixed with data but why for a pc that you just want wlan interrace connectiviity--is this on your pc?
a modem--who runs a modem?
you need your wic/nic cards to assure 802.11t o4 n= modem should not be involved unless you are running dial up?
on high speed wifi?
confusing the crap out of me...
