Bob, what I am doing simply is as following: I have a software and thru it I call thirdparty exe file named ECCENTER.exe that is BT setting application in my VAIO laptop.
in ECCENTER app there is an option called Application path that we can enter another exe/app-file to be run automaytically after connecting to a BT device, what i am trying to achieve is that I insert the exe/app-file in application path dynamically inside my software and then call ECCENTER.
