<s> I'm not sure whether I should upgrade my computer or just buy a new one because they are so cheap these days. </s>
<s> Please help me decide! </s>
<s> I'm looking to upgrade it probably for gaming purposes. </s>
<s> What would you suggest? </s>
<s> I'm looking to be fairly frugal as well. </s>
<s> It's an Acer Aspire E360 (with windows vista ultimate). </s>
<s> I've added 512mg(total 1.5g) of ram and thats the only upgrade I've done so far. </s>
<s> CPU is a AMD Athlon 64x2 3800+ The video card is a radeon x600 (I know crappy) Here is a link to a picture of my PSU http://img247.imageshack.us/my.php?image=nashvilleandrandom070lq6.jpg Here is a link to just about the exact same computer. </s>

<s> Please ask if you need any more info! </s>
<s> you'd probably need a new psu. </s>
<s> I think you have dual +12V rails, but max output is only 300w. </s>
<s> Maybe add another 512mb ram as you're using vista. </s>
<s> you will have to find a low profile graphic card for you have a small form factor case. </s>
<s> A normal size card will not fit! </s>
<s> A low profile card? </s>
<s> Oh man that blows, I've never even heard of one of those. </s>
<s> Thanks for the feedback guys. </s>
<s> Please keep it coming. </s>
<s> I looked up the machine and I stand corrected. </s>
<s> It will take a standard graphic card! </s>
<s> Just make sure (as posted before) you get a good power supply. </s>
<s> About a 500 or 600 watt would do it. </s>
