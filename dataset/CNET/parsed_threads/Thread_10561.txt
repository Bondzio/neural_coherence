<s> After I built a new computer for myself, my brother's old computer has been acting up a few times. </s>
<s> He has an old built computer with an ASUS TUV4X motherboard and two Quantum 20GB hard drives. </s>
<s> One drive is named the &quot;C&quot; drive where Windows is located; the other drive is the &quot;D&quot; drive. </s>
<s> He recently got the Trojan.Vundo virus (for the second time) and got rid of it after two days of cleaning. </s>
<s> After that, upon starting Windows XP, the &quot;D&quot; drive would simply not show up in the &quot;My Computer&quot; directory. </s>
<s> Sometimes it does, other times it does not. </s>
<s> I took the computer apart, dusted it, replaced the IDE cable and still no luck. </s>
<s> Actually, I don't really know what to do. </s>
<s> He just wants this computer to last him until he gets a new laptop in July 2006. </s>
<s> (He thinks that after removing some quarantined files that the virus was responsible for could have caused the problem because trojan.vundo is rooted in certain Windows files. </s>
<s> Is this a possibility?) </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I have no idea about the virus thing. </s>
<s> On this machine when I boot I get a couple of bios screens that show the hd's the bios found. </s>
<s> So... if you get those sort of screens you might want to watch them close and verify that the bios is not missing the &quot;D&quot; hd during it's probe. </s>
<s> I suspect that if the bios is missing the hd then the OS will have a problem. </s>
<s> I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you said. </s>
<s> What is the BIOS' probe? </s>
<s> When you start the machine there are some THINGS that happen before you load the OS/WINDOWS. </s>
<s> These THINGS are a function of the BIOS&gt;basic input output system. </s>
<s> Look at it like a machine startup pkg, not to be confused with loading an OS/WINDOWS that's the next level up. </s>
<s> One of the things the bios does is look to see what devices the machine has, that's the probe. </s>
<s> If it does not see the &quot;D&quot; drive then when you load Windows I doubt that Windows will see it either. </s>
<s> Unplug the &quot;C&quot; drive, power the machine on, you'll see a few screens of info appear on the monitor. </s>
<s> Where did it come from? </s>
<s> It's not from Windows, the &quot;C&quot; drive is unplugged. </s>
<s> That's the BIOS running. </s>
