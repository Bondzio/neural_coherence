It worked OK for about two years, and I made hundreds of pictures using it. Quality is quite adequate for an amatuer. Professional photographers would not use it, probably. PH-160 paper kits allowed to keep price per print to be around 28 cents. Then it broke. Customer service was not real good... They also told me it is discontinued... Now I need a dye sublimation printer replacement. Is there anything like printer 500 on the market, please? I expect the price to be around $200 or so. Thank you. Post 1 of 2 | Back to top

For under 200 I see six models at http://store.kodak.com/store/ekconsus/en_US/list/All-in-One_Printers/categoryID.28889300 Again, you may feel burned up about 2 year printers but that is about what these last for. Repair is not possible since the new one costs less than repairs. Bob
