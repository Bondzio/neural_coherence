we woke up one morning to find that our computer wouldn't go past the hp screen.
an internet search revealed the problem was probably a bad hard drive.
so we bought a new one from a computer store and i installed it.
i couldn't get into bios to tell it to locate the new drive, though.
afterwards, i went to use the system recovery discs purchased from hp, but it's not working.
i've gotten two errors: 0xc00000e9, and 0xe0ef0003.
on a couple of occasions, i got to the hp recovery disc option screen, and first tried choosing to &quot;restore to factory&quot; and then, when that failed, tried telling it to check the computer.
it responded that i needed to put in the first recovery disc (the one it was operating off of!
), so i removed it and reinserted it, but it refused to recognize it and the drive door became unresponsive until i'd restarted the computer.
now, i can't even get to the hp recovery screen options - the error messages shut things down.
my husband and i are both students - we need this computer for our classes, and i'm completely out of ideas.
i'm not an expert - this was my first shot at even installing a hard drive (i used the hp whitepaper on it, and am pretty sure things went ok with that - although this failure is demoralizing).
is there anyone out there who can give me a heads up on what to do?
i read after installing the hd that hp puts a secret partition so only hard drives bought from them will boot with recovery discs - is that the problem?
arrgh!!
