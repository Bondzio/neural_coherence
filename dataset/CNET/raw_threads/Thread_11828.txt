I tried using the sata to ide adaptors but to no avail. I since went ahead and bought a sata HD, but how can I retrieve all my precious data from the old IDE drives and apply to my new system? HELP PLEASE!!! I run Windows XP with AMD Athalon 64X2 Core Processor 5200+, 271 GHz and 3.25 gigs of ram, ATI Radeon HD 3600 Video Card, Tascam FW-1082 WDM Audio Interface, with a Gigabyte MoBo

I've used this with great success: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2020D&cpc=SCH You can use that or similar and access your data via the USB port. tada -----Willy

Once that's done, you can then more easily copy data from old source to new under XP. Otherwise, with XP it can get sticky, so don't try to defeat this if you plan to install on new HD. Once, you're happy, you can reformat the old HD and use as an ext. HD for backup or whatever. -----Willy
