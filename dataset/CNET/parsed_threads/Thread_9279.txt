<s> I am wondering of what projector would be good to have for my laptop. </s>
<s> I need a projector that is small and runs off a battery. </s>
<s> I don't want an adapter of VGA to anything. </s>
<s> &quot;I don't want an adapter of VGA to anything.&quot; Since you don't allow the adapter or use of VGA to anything then how would you propose the video from the laptop get to the projector? </s>

<s> I meant that i did not want to get an adapter that would go on the VGA connector of my computer to something like composite or component. </s>
<s> I hope this clarifies my question. </s>
