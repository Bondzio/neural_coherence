<s> Hi, I recently bought an Acer Aspire Notebook. </s>
<s> When I plugged a gadget in the USB drive (tried all 3 drives) it says that the USB drive is low-powered. </s>
<s> I have tried a usb hub with a y-cable, a usb hub with external power and a usb 2.0 pcmcia card and it doesn't work. </s>
<s> I checked and the usb port is 2.0. </s>
<s> Is there anything I can do to make it high-powered? </s>
<s> Can I change the USB Controller? </s>
<s> Any advice greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> question and make a suggestion: 1. </s>
<s> What does Acer have to say about this? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If it's not fixed then use the warranty and exchange it. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> duh! </s>
<s> Acer support were the first people I turned to for help. </s>
<s> They said there was nothing wrong with the machine and therefore, no exchange allowed. </s>
<s> Other techies I spoke to lectured me at length for wasting money on an Acer. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22the+USB+drive+is+low-powered%22 finds that along with others, I've never seen that message. </s>
<s> There are low speed messages and a power message but not a message as presented. </s>
<s> Sorry, but something is a little off here and it helps to use the same words as the message. </s>

<s> already contacted Acer in your first post. </s>
<s> You'd be surprised how many users haven't done that yet. </s>
<s> Bob's suggestion is a good one. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Hi, I posted a reply yesterday but it appears to be lost in cyber space! </s>
<s> The message when I plugged in the gadget was &quot;You have a low powered USB machine. </s>
<s> Please contact your technician for assistance&quot;. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any assistance you can give. </s>
<s> Frankly I can only guess that some new programmer stuck it into a driver. </s>
<s> http://www.usbman.com may want to hear about this since it's a new message. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks, Bob. </s>
<s> I think I'll just sell the darn machine, esp. </s>
<s> since I have a buyer who is aware of the problem and for some strange reason, is still eager to buy the Acer. </s>
<s> My next machine will definitely not be an Acer! </s>
