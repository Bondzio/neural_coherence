1.1.1	ive wrote about it before i was trying to decide what to get a antec case with a 350w ps or a liteon casewith generic 400w ps .	St
1.1.2	People said that i should try gettin a ps seperately from the case but i dont know if ill have enough money .	St
1.1.3	Can someone suggest one of these cases or if possible find a good case - ps combo on newegg for like under 70 bucks if possible ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I would like to make a more direct suggestion here but I ca n't .	St
1.2.2	It would help a lot if you provide some specs for the cases or a link to the cases .	St
1.2.3	Given that generic power supplies can be purchases for less than $ 30 and decents cases that provide good cooling solution and space and be purchased for less than $ 40 , purchasis the P/S and chassis seperate might be the best way to go .	St
1.2.4	It really depends a lot on the parts that you will be installing in the case .	St
1.2.5	Antecs usually provide better cooling .	St
1.2.6	I have n't heard much about Liteon cases and to be honest I did n't Liteon made CASES .	St
1.2.7	If you get a P/S with more than 350 watts then you will have more room to work with on future upgrades .	St
1.3.1	I picked these based on my preference since you did n't indicate your preferences .	St
1.3.2	http : //www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp ? description=11-199-005 & depa=1 This particular case does not come with fans for cooling but at $ 26 for the case and 430Watt you can afford fans .	St
1.3.3	It takes up to 4 fans to keep your mainstream products at a optimal temperature .	St
1.3.4	I have an IT classmate that has 1 of these cases with a P4 installed .	St
1.3.5	http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp ? description=11-195-004 & DEPA=1 This case is for gamers who like a flashly looky cases to show off .	St
1.3.6	It comes with 430 watt P/S and 1 fan .	St
1.3.7	You can install 2 extra 80 mm fans in the rear .	St
1.3.8	http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp ? description=11-144-035 & DEPA=1 I picked this 1 as an option because it comes with a P/S ( 420 Watt ) and its a professional looking entry-level server case .	St
1.3.9	And best of all , unlike to other cases , its aluminum when means dissipate heat better .	St
1.3.10	It only comes with 1 fan but you get another 80mm fan and still make your $ 70 budget .	St
1.3.11	However with the $ 10 shipping fee , you will spend a little more than intended .	St
1.3.12	http : //www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp ? description=11-154-013 & depa=1 This is just another professional looking case that would make a good option .	St
1.3.13	I hope that this gives you some idea of what you can get .	St
1.3.14	For a $ 70 budget the options are almost countless , especially if you 're enthusiastic about it .	St
1.3.15	All of these came from Newegg.com .	St
1.3.16	Just take a look on there .	Sug
1.3.17	In the future , you will get a lot more useful help if you provide some indication of how the parts will be used , as in , for gaming , home entertainment , or office or server use .	St
1.3.18	Oh yeah , I kind of figured that the Antec Case that you were considering is the Antec Solution Series Mid-Tower Case w/350 W PS .	St
1.3.19	For the price of that case I do n't see anything special .	St
1.3.20	It 's a basic case .	St
1.3.21	Its made out of steel .	St
1.3.22	It does not come with fans ( I have 1 system with this case . )	St
1.3.23	And lastly , 350 W is rather limited when you add future upgrades as a factor .	St
1.3.24	Its a decent case but would be better if it came with a larger PS and was aluminum .	St
1.3.25	Thats my opinion of it but I 'm a semi-gamer and I like to loaded systems .	St
1.3.26	Good Luck .	St
1.4.1	Better system cases are sold w/o power supplies .	St
1.4.2	End-users can then install the desired p/s unit , usually what they consider best .	St
1.4.3	The whole point is , if you skip on cost for a decent p/s , you 'll pay for it later , especially in a stuffed system .	St
1.4.4	While generic p/s will do fine upto a point , basically they drop down considerably under stressful conditions while a quality unit tends to maintain its wattage levels for longer periods and at stable outputs .	St
1.4.5	If you 've a simple system , get the 350W for now and upgrade later .	St
1.4.6	When you check on pricing for p/s , you can see a wide difference besides the bells and whistles .	St
1.4.7	If you want your system to be as problem free from the start and you know you 'll be putting high wattage demands , then start on the right footing , get the best p/s unit you can afford , of course a decent case with a good p/s just makes it all better .	St
1.4.8	Think , & quot ; long term & quot ; .	St
1.4.9	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
