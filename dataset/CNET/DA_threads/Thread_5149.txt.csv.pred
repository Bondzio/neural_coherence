1.1.1	i have accidentally lifted the lever seating my cpu while working on my pc.	St
1.1.2	I put the lever back down.	St
1.1.3	Will i need to properly seat my cpu again with thermal paste or will it be ok. everything seems to be working fine but i can't help thinking it is a little slower or am i just being paranoid!?	Ques
1.1.4	Idle core temp is 52 deg c 125F on an AMD 64 3000+ with standard heatsink and fan on an MSI K8N Neo motherboard.	St
1.1.5	Don't know what the temp was before.	St
1.1.6	Sorry.	St
1.2.1	Think of it as a sandwich with the CPU on the bottom.	St
1.2.2	fan - heatsink - cpu The thermal paste is between the cpu and the heatsink (think mayo).	St
1.2.3	When the lever is down, the socket clamps snugly on the processor pins.	St
1.2.4	When you lift the lever, it unclamps the pins, and does not necessarily shift the heatsink with respect to the cpu.	St
1.2.5	So, unless there was movement, you don't need to replace the mayo...er, uh, thermal paste.	St
1.2.6	The ultimate test is as you implied; if the cpu temp is too high, then replace it.	St
1.2.7	Also, check your fan speed.	Sug
1.2.8	CPU temp is also a relative thing.	St
1.2.9	if your system temp is 30*C, 52*C (resting) might be a little high, but if your system temp is &gt; 40*C, 52*C is not unreasonable.	St
1.3.1	Thanks man.	St
1.3.2	you've put my mind at rest.	St
1.4.1	I like that comparison!!!	St
1.4.2	If you do have to repalce the paste, go easy on the Mayo.	St
1.4.3	John	St
