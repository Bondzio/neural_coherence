Now I get a black screen every time I try and turn on my computer. I don't get the usual boot up screen either. I can boot up when I connect to the motherboard, but not when I use my graphics card. Is there any way to fix this without connecting to a monitor which can handle the set screen resolution?

All the PCs I've used for years show a splash screen and could get the BIOS even with the Windows video setting being incorrect. SAFE MODE seems to elude new users of Windows. Let's try this again. Tell me how you tried to get to Windows SAFE MODE? Bob

It now looks like a PC that needs repair. As to the &quot;done something to the graphics card? could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat?&quot; I have yet to encounter that as a cause of a card failure. Most failures are because of inadequate cooling, failed fan or a bad power supply. Since there is no BIOS, splash or other screens the machine should be treated like a dead PC and we begin the repairs by replacing the parts we suspect first. Bob

I was thinking that maybe changing the resolution could affect the splash screen. If not, then I definitely destroyed the card. I did mess with the card when it stopped working, and I do have a network card which partially obstructs the airflow from the card's fan. I probably screwed it up. Crud.

Since the card stops the machine cold I'd keep that card out of the machine before it fries something in the PC. Check the card warranty and you may get lucky, Bob
