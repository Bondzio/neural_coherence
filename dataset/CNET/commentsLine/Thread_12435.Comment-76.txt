we all know that lacie is trying to sell it software from prosoft engineering.
this marketing method is unacceptable and unethical.
here is what their support replied to me after after i asked them for a solution to this seamminly common problem of lacie drive suddedly disapearing from window xp and mac computers &quot;it is possible that your drive has experienced some data corruption.
the best suggestion to retrieve that data is to try data rescue which should be able to scavenge the missing files and copy them to a different volume.
it doesn't make any changes to the drive at all, so if it fails, a professional data recovery service can still easily retrieve the data.
you can download a demo of it from prosoft engineering's website to see if it will work for you.
single licence $129.00/ it licence $249.00 and universal(?)
$349.00 get a life lacie and stop milking your customers!!!
however i found a solution to this problem (looking at blogs, it seems that 1000's of lacie customers are having this problem.
so here a free solution at $0.00 cost, thanks to the open source community (you rock) -&gt; download free testdisk from  unzip, run [testdisk_win.exe] select the external usb drive, select [proceed ] select [ intel ] intel/pc partition -&gt;{enter} select [ analyze ] analyze current partition structure and search for lost partitions -&gt;{enter} next screen just press -&gt; {enter} next screen select [write] -&gt; {enter} disconnect usb hd, power down usb hd reconnect and power up that's it !!!!!!!
