I purchased what was affordable at the time and now have 512 mb of PC400 DDR ram.
My motherboard has 2 DDR sockets and 2 SD sockets so you can use one or the other but not both.
Also I built this machine from the board up so I know a lot more then the casual user.
And it's been fun because I am always pottering around with it and upgrading things here and there.
