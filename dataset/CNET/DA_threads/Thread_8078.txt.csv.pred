1.1.1	I just do n't understand why the new monitors are mostly widescreen ones .	St
1.1.2	I can see that if you are using the monitor to watch a movie , widescreen would be nice .	St
1.1.3	But for general home computing ; word processing , simple spreadsheet , internet surfing , email , etc .	St
1.1.4	is the widescreen format of any benefit at all ?	Ques
1.1.5	I happen to enjoy using my screensaver function to display our vacation photos .	St
1.1.6	If I purchase a widescreen monitor will my photos be stretched such that people all look short and fat ?	Ques
1.1.7	Or will the photos appear in normal dimensions ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanx for any info .	St
1.1.9	Glenn	St
1.2.1	Wide screen can be helpful if you are multitasking .	St
1.2.2	The images are not 'distorted ' becuase wide screens should be set to wide dimensions .	St
1.2.3	A set number of pixels such as 1600x900 .	St
1.2.4	Since an image is always the same number pixels across , as long as you are using the correct resolution its fine .	St
1.2.5	The slide show will be fine .	St
1.2.6	If it is n't just disable stretch to fit in the screen saver settings .	St
1.3.1	It 's all economics .	St
1.3.2	If you were around when PCs came into being you would know why we ended up with the old aspect ratio .	St
1.3.3	Today it 's for the same reason .	St
1.3.4	There is no mystery here .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	I was going to start a thread like this , not about & quot ; why & quot ; , but & quot ; where & quot ; .	St
1.4.2	Really dislike the widescreen for everything I use my computer for .	St
1.4.3	I DO own a TV for movie watching , really hate the black lines on the sides of monitors with most programs/games I have and/or missing parts of my wallpapers ( most of which come from my camera and fit perfectly ) .	St
1.4.4	Where are the best sources for buying 22 & quot ; and up 4x3 computer monitors , or the best models ?	Ques
1.4.5	?	Ques
1.5.1	I can not understand the wide-screen mindset for computers or for TV .	St
1.5.2	People are taller than they are wide ( most are anyway ) .	St
1.5.3	Spreadsheet and text papers are taller than they are wide .	St
1.5.4	Everything that we use a computer for or watch on TV is generally vertically oriented .	St
1.5.5	Then everybody , programmers and crapware distributors as well , want to add toolbars to shorten an already too short vertical space on the screen .	St
1.5.6	Now they want to squeeze more vertical space away from us with a & quot ; wide-screen & quot ; aspect ratio .	St
1.5.7	Are we down to about 3 lines of text without scrolling now ?	Ques
1.5.8	Very silly and counter-productive to me .	St
1.6.1	I have the same doubt as you as to why some monitors are made wide screened .	St
1.6.2	A normal person angle of vision is 120 degrees and unless the wide screen monitor is placed farther away from the eyes , I find it rather streneous as the eyes have to move from left to right .	St
1.6.3	Personally , I find that it is only good for viewing multi pages and spreadsheets .	St
1.6.4	Perhaps , the reason for manufacturers to produce wide screen monitor is to follow the trend of wide screen TVs .	St
1.6.5	But again , wide screen TV is viewed at a further distance as compared to a wide screen computer monitor .	St
1.7.1	I have a wide screen digital 1680 x 1050 and the the right of that my older analog 1280 x 1024 .	St
1.7.2	I run several websites and this enables me to have two main documents open side by side on the main screen and various stickies , images , address books and calendars open on the secondary display .	St
1.7.3	This is very easy to set up and documents can be slid seamlessly from one monitor to the other as though it were a single screen .	St
1.7.4	If I had a third monitor I would add that too if I could find a graphics card to handle it .	St
1.7.5	My present on is NVidia GS 7600 .	St
1.7.6	If you are used to working with your Windows at full screen , you have to change that habit , but after that it gets better and better .	St
1.8.1	abovepar , I can certainly understand where a widescreen monitor could be preferred for a number of types of tasks and by some people .	St
1.8.2	Like the tasks you describe .	St
1.8.3	None of which I would ever do .	St
1.9.1	I totally agree with John3347 !	St
1.9.2	Many websites are also setup for a widescreen format which means you have to scroll back & forth as well as up & down to read a page .	St
1.9.3	Very irritating !	St
1.9.4	Makes me think of formal written documents printed the longways on standard 8X11 paper !	St
1.9.5	Not proper protocol !	St
1.9.6	And as for TV , I also hate the new & quot ; short-screen & quot ; format .	St
1.9.7	New TVs in widescreen size look lopped off , like where 's the top half !	St
1.9.8	I wo n't watch anything that 's not broadcast in standard screen size format .	St
1.9.9	The standard camera snapshot also went & quot ; wide & quot ; some years ago .	St
1.9.10	However , I see most people holding their cameras vertically to capture individual photos .	St
1.9.11	THE WIDE FORMAT IS ONLY GOOD FOR PANARAMAS !	St
1.9.12	If there are so many people who really like this new widescreen then somebody needs to invent some way to provide an option for TV screens , i.e. , standard or widescreen !	St
1.9.13	Without losing quality for either size .	St
1.9.14	GrannyCin	St
1.10.1	monitors from some manufacturers .	St
1.10.2	Not as cheap as 16:9/10 because mass production nowadays are in wide formats .	St
1.10.3	Why ?	Ques
1.10.4	Small screens , ie .	St
1.10.5	for computers , are sidebars for glass mfrs .	St
1.10.6	TVs are the main customers so monitors get cheaper in wide formats .	St
1.10.7	Why wide TV ?	Ques
1.10.8	Because movie theatre screens are that way .	St
1.10.9	Just got ta roll with the punches but it 's OK to whine .	St
1.10.10	Lots in these forums .	St
1.11.1	After much research and varied usage we have found the top monitors are as follows : # 1 Samsung model 226CW # 2 Sony 19 & quot ; 4x3 model SDM HS95P analog/digital -- best for graphics # 3 Sony 19-20 ' model SDM HS94P analog/digital -- best overall usage # 4 HP NEW 22 & quot ; # 5 Viewsonic 20-22 & quot ; many models analog/digital -- watch carefully !	St
1.11.2	CAN VIEW AT & gt ; http : //techbuyer.spaces.live.com Hoping this helps and contact at above site if you need more assistance .	St
1.12.1	I also do not like wide screen , even the TV , I just hate it .the trouble is we do not have a say .	St
1.12.2	well none of my screens are wide and it will stay that way and also I would sooner watch VHS 8 hour than DVD , they last a lot longer , some of my VHS tapes must be 30 year old and still going strong .once the DVD gets a scratch on the record paper is done with not so with a VHS just snip and stick .so lets hope that not all screens will be wide , let the people have a say .	St
1.12.3	Cheers John	St
1.13.1	I also dislike the widescreen formats of most new monitors , and would like to stop all the scrolling that is needed to read most pages .	St
1.13.2	I was going to buy the widest screen I could afford , as long as it had rotating capabilities , and rotate the screen so it 's tall , eliminate alot of scrolling , ,any thoughts how this might work in the long run , or would it be just as frustrating side scrolling ?	Ques
1.14.1	& gt ; I can not understand the wide-screen mindset for computers or for & gt ; TV .	St
1.14.2	People are taller than they are wide ( most are anyway ) .	St
1.14.3	But your field of vision is wider than it is high .	St
1.14.4	You see wide , even without periferal vision .	St
1.14.5	You also naturaly look to your left and right , but not your up .	St
1.14.6	Nor your down , unless you 're moving , which I raely do when I 'm sitting .	St
1.15.1	From someone who just went from a Dell UltraSharp 18.1 & quot ; 1280x1024 LCD monitor to a Samsung SyncMaster 220wm 22 & quot ; 1680x1050 widescreen ( ws ) monitor , I definately see what you 're getting at .	St
1.15.2	However , I do n't quite agree with you completely .	St
1.15.3	You also need to factor in other things too .	St
1.15.4	1 ) people do n't upgrade just for the widescreen aspect .	Sug
1.15.5	For most people , I 'd like to think if they 're gon na upgrade their 17 & quot ; LCD monitors , they 're not just going to get a 17 & quot ; ws monitor instead .	St
1.15.6	They 're gon na get something bigger AND in ws , like a 20 & quot ; ws monitor .	St
1.15.7	Case in point , with me , I set my old Dell UltraSharp on 1024x768 ( one setting below the monitor 's native and max res ) since that makes things easier for me to view while lounging back in my chair .	St
1.15.8	I set my new Samsung SyncMaster to 1280x1024 .	St
1.15.9	I 'm still getting more vertical viewing area while having excellent sized images that I do n't need to squint at even while wearing glasses .	St
1.15.10	To note , ideally , I 'd like to set my new ws monitor to 1440x900 to get the best tradeoff of lots of pixels and easier to see images , withOUT having the black bars all around the viewable image area , but that 's another topic ( esp .	St
1.15.11	for ATI tech supp ) 2 ) people like having 2 windows side by side for comparisons .	St
1.15.12	Whether if it 's spreadsheets , documents , images , code , contracts , or whatever , it 's easier to do that on 16:9 ws monitor than the std 4:3 aspect ratio .	St
1.15.13	For the latter , the monitor would have to be bigger to compete with the ws 3 ) Many PC games support ws What one poster said about humans seeing more range in side-to-side than up-and-down is true .	St
1.15.14	I believe that 's at least one of the reasons the motion picture industry uses the 16:9 aspect ratio .	St
1.15.15	You get the maximum amount of picture that most people can handle at once without it being too much .	St
1.15.16	I KNOW that 's the reason Nintendo made their handheld gaming system , the GameBoy Advance ( GBA ) widescreen ( it was mentioned in the first issue of Nintendo Power Advance , Nintendo Power 's 'specialty magzine issues ' dedicated to the then brand new GBA handheld ) .	St
1.15.17	If you recall , the previous gameboys ( Gameboy , Gameboy Color ) were practically square screens ( 160x144 on 2.6 & quot ; size ) .	St
1.15.18	By contrast , the GBA is 240x160 on a 2.9 & quot ; screen .	St
1.15.19	I thoroughly enjoyed the orig GB and also enjoyed the GBA , but I 'd say among other things , Nin definately did themselves good by making the GBA widescreen b/c the GBA is the top selling gaming handheld behind its orig GB line .	St
1.15.20	PSP also followed suit with its 4.3 & quot ; widescreen at 480x272 pixels .	St
1.15.21	Console gaming may have eaten away at some of the supporters for PC gaming , but there 's still a sizeable # of PC gaming players out there .	St
1.15.22	I 'm talking about those who play games like Call Of Duty , Doom3 , other first person shooters , various sports games , and RPGs .	St
1.15.23	Not those who play online flash games like Bejeweled .	St
1.15.24	Those that do more & quot ; hard core & quot ; PC games get the maximum effect from ws monitors 4 ) Some LCD monitors let you pivot the screen Reach out to turn the monitor 90 degrees , change a setting in your video card , and now you 've got ALOT of vertical viewing area , just like a book .	St
1.15.25	While you can do this with certain non-ws monitors as well , being able to pivot at ws monitor gives you an ideal viewing experience for long winded documents and articles If you 're interested in this feature , note that the monitor will likely have to have a stand of higher height to allow clearance for it to pivot like you see in here http : //computers.pricegrabber.com/flat-panel-lcd-monitors/m/13468534/ 5 ) even if you square-ish screens do have noticeable advantages , by design ( dunno if it 's really cheaper for manuf to produce ws over non-ws ) or by what the manfuacturs produce ( to keep up for the consumers overall preferance for ws ) , ws appear to be cheaper than their square-ish counterparts .	St
1.15.26	Those points being said , I still have my old LCD standing by .	St
1.15.27	It 's collecting dust , but at a moment 's notice , it can be dusted off and swapped back .	St
1.15.28	However , assuming the black bars at 1440x900 resolution does n't get fixed , at the very least , I 'll keep the res at 1280x1024 and change it to 1680x1050 when I need a HUGE area .	St
1.15.29	To be honest tho , a larger 4:3 LCD monitor was on my radar .	St
1.15.30	I got my new monitor only b/c it was only $ 200 at a huge sale , so for me , price was more of an issues .	St
1.15.31	Of my points above , # 1 , # 2 , and # 5 are what made my ws purchase most desirable .	St
1.15.32	I 've alr gone into detail for # 1 .	St
1.15.33	# 2 is n't required for any work related activity , but it is nice but not necessary to have .	St
1.15.34	# 5 came up when a big sale occurred .	St
1.15.35	# 3 I get with a freeware board game thjat 's nice to have all those pixels , and widescreen helps for some setups , but for & quot ; real & quot ; PC games , it would 've have been fully worth it since I 'd probably wan na upgrade my vid card first .	St
1.15.36	If you 're still into the 4:3 , consider getting a 22 & quot ; monitor at 1600x1200 resoltuion or someth like that .	St
1.15.37	Be forewarned tho , my quick searches return those at $ 500+ .	St
1.15.38	Others on the otherhand will FLAT OUT REFUSE to use a square screen , some of it directed at handhelds , while others at computers .	St
1.15.39	The choice is yours .	St
1.16.1	Please help !	St
1.16.2	I just got this Dell wide screen monitor 19 & quot ; and it is doing what everyone is complaining about.. making all pictures too wide !	St
1.16.3	How do you adjust the monitor to correct this distortion ?	Ques
1.16.4	I use my computer for creating web pages with clinical photos of faces to shoe pre and post operative changes , and this distortion is impossible to work with .	St
1.16.5	Please help !	St
1.16.6	Thank you !	St
1.17.1	Supply me your SYSTEM INFO ... as to Operating System , Memory , and Video then watch for my reply as to how to make setup relative to video adjustments .	St
1.18.1	right click on the desktop - & gt ; Properties - & gt ; Settings and change the resolution to your monitor 's native resolution ( usually the last one ) .	St
