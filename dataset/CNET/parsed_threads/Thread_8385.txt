<s> Strange but true... </s>
<s> I cannot open the &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot;. </s>
<s> I go to Control Panel and double-click the &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot; icon and get no response at all... other than the cursor turning into an hourglass for about half a second. </s>
<s> When I open &quot;Network Connections&quot;, I get a warning that &quot;The Network Connections Folder was unable to retrieve the list of network adapters on your machine. </s>
<s> Make sure that the Network Connections service is enabled and running&quot;. </s>

<s> At the time that I went wireless with the desktop, I remember going through and changing several settings in order to ease my mind concerning security issues... </s>
<s> I turned off the file sharing, etc., as I only had the one computer. </s>
<s> I recently purchased a laptop and was trying to set up file sharing between it and the desktop through the router and it seems that I need access to either the &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot; or at least be able to see the current network connection in order to change the settings and allow the desktop to communicate with the laptop. </s>
<s> I've tried searching for files with &quot;network wizard&quot;, &quot;file sharing&quot; and &quot;tcpip&quot; in them and have found nothing helpful. </s>
<s> I have looked through the event files after having tried to open the Network Setup Wizard. </s>
<s> I don't really know what to look for, but I was hoping that something would stand out to where I could tell what the problem is. </s>
<s> I had some components replaced on the desktop motherboard a couple years ago and the tech didn't return my recovery disc. </s>
<s> He has since closed up shop and I have no idea how to contact him. </s>
<s> I would be happy to provide more info if it would help. </s>
<s> Any constructive thoughts would be appreciated </s>
