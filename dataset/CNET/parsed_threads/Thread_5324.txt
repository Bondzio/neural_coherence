<s> At school he is on their high speed network with an ethernet cable. </s>
<s> My home boxes run XP, he has media center edition. </s>
<s> We're stumped. </s>
<s> What box? </s>
<s> Are you referring to the router, or the external modem? </s>
<s> All students at my son's U. have to have a program called Aegis on their hd. </s>
