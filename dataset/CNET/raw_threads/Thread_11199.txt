I came with a Fujitsu 60G ATA-100 hard drive which I quickly filled up to capacity. I purchased a new Western Digital 160G drive from newegg which is ATA-6. I used a hard drive clone device to copy my smaller drive and then pulled out the old caddy and replaced the drive. Upon start-up, I received an error message that the new drive was no bootable. Is this due to the difference between ATA-6 and ATA-100? Thats the only discernable difference. The new drive has ~40 pins and the old drive has like a bar type connection. If that is the case, is there anything I can do to use the ATA-6 drive or am I screwed?
