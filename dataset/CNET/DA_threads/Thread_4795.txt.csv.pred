1.1.1	I put this request under & quot ; Desktops & quot ; but think I had it in the wrong place , mods please feel free to delete it .	St
1.1.2	Thanks Issues as follows : I have a 4 year old HP running XP .	St
1.1.3	Today , it would not post , and seems to be the motherboard .	St
1.1.4	Took it to a PC shop .	St
1.1.5	They are telling me that if the replace the motherboard , they have to wipe the hard drive as the new MB would have a different chip set .	St
1.1.6	I told them that was OK , as I have a backup drive running ACRONIS TRUE IMAGE that I can restore from .	St
1.1.7	Again , he said that would reinstall the prior chip set drivers .	St
1.1.8	Is this correct ?	Ques
1.1.9	So is there nothing I can do to get back my hard drive info from the backup drive when a MB is replaced ?	Ques
1.1.10	Somehow this does n't sound quite right .	St
1.1.11	appreciate thoughts and help .	Polite
1.2.1	Go ahead and restore some HDD with the image .	St
1.2.2	But it will not boot because of a few things .	St
1.2.3	Yes the drivers are one thing but the HP usually has a Windows locked to the HP motherboard so ( again we are duplicating prior discussions ! )	St
1.2.4	Windows will not run because it 's locked to that maker 's board or boards .	St
1.2.5	The common fix is to restore the backup to one HDD and then install the OS to your BOOT HDD then after the new OS is working , add the HDD with the restore and fish out your files .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	But the most pressing will be that if the drive is wiped out just because of a chipset , that just means different drivers .	St
1.3.2	Depending on the version of True Image , they also claim to be able to make just a change with & quot ; Acronis True Image ?	Ques
1.3.3	Home 2011 Plus Pack is an add-on module for Acronis True Image ?	Ques
1.3.4	Home 2011 featuring enhancements for advanced home users .	St
1.3.5	It includes the flexibility to restore files , applications and an operating system to dissimilar hardware. & quot ; If you have the WinXP install disk , then it is just a matter of doing a & quot ; repair install & quot ; instead of a clean install as the PC Guy says he wants to do .	St
1.3.6	If it was me , I would research a motherboard closer to what is there , if not an exact replacement .	St
1.3.7	If the PC Guy will not do that for some reason , then look elsewhere .	St
1.3.8	BTW : If the motherboard change requires a reinstall of the OS , the OEM WinXP will not activate , which will mean a new OS license .	St
