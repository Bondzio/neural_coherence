I need a good machine to run CAD as well as Quickbooks and other business related programs but also want my flt sim 2004 to have good graphics. If I upgrade the video card it seems like it should be a good unit. But how would it compare to a name brand like HP or Sony? I am willing to pay a bit more for cutting edge now for upgrading for the next couple years as well. Is there anything I should be afraid of? propietary parts or anything like that? thanks in advance for any input! Tim

The graphics is ATI Radeon Xpress 200 (PCIe) which is Integrated on board shared graphics, something like Intel Integrated on board shared graphics. I do not recall anyone saying how it performs in games and the flight simulators. The motherboard has, however a PCI-Express x16 slot for upgrade to a graphics card. I would suggest a PCIe card in Nvidia GeForce 6600, 6600GT, 6800, or ATI Radeon X700 or higher depending on how much you want to spend. To see how the cards perform, scroll through the different games test by Tom's Hardware: http://graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20050524/vga_charts-03.html

This is the reason for investigating the eMachine as well as upgrading the video card. Thanks for your input so far! Pilotim

Right now the recently released Nvidia 7800GTX is reported to be on top. ATI is supposed to release their R520 this fall, and then Nvidia is expected to also release another high end card. Surely you are not interested in those $600 cards that cost as much as your PC. Assume you will read or look at all the different test in that Tom's Hardware link. I yield to Ozos for having more knowledge on ATI video cards: In one of his posts: ''..Radeon X does not have SM3.0, meaning games in 2006 won't even run correctly/on anything but the lowest settings'' Some other comments from Ozos in another thread in this Hardware Forum: ''......and if you'd really like to get into the ATi/nVidia battle ATi does lack features, which make it the #2 part in terms of future use, and performance ATi lacks Shader Model 3.0 (which is the requirement that keeps ATi from having a DirectX 9.0c Certified Part (currently only nVidia has a DX 9.0c Cert. part)) the lack of SM3.0, and the fact that Radeon X still uses FP24, and not the new FP32 (FP between 24 and 32 isn't such a big deal, and won't be for another year-ish, which is probably why ATi didn't go FP32 (nVidia is notorious for advancing things beyond what the time requires, SM3.0 however is something that is required now) ATi's Radeon 9 series of cards have issues with FarCry, and in some cases flat out won't play the game Radeon 9 is already known to be un-supportive of the Half-Life 2 expansion, due to it's amazingly inferior technology (GeForce FX isn't much better honestly) Radeon X is going to support the Half-Life 2 expansion, yet it's not going to support it at 100% GeForce 6's only issue is going to be does it have the power, and current estimates say YES GeForce 7 will have no issues, it has more than enough power and all the features of GeForce 6 + some more do not sit there and say ATi and nVidia are equals ATi usually nets higher benchmark scores, and usually nets better acceptance in the performance crowd due to various RMA Policies adapted by them and a few of their OEM's (no question asked RMA's are very nice when you've just fried a $550 card OC'ing it, and you can get a new one for free sans postage) nVidia always has had higher tech features, and supported newer games with older hardware...it's how they put 3dfx out of business for god's sake consider, 3dfx supported nothing higher than 16-bit color until VSA-100, nVidia had had 32-bit for 2-3 yrs by that time, had refined it, and had also refined Direct3D support (something which 3dfx also had issues with) nVidia runs ahead of the pack in terms of technolgy, and currently in terms of performance if you want to waste your money on a Radeon 9 or Radeon X that is A) already outdated and B) will require replacement by christmas to play any game; go for it.....''

I will stop in at the store and see which video card they suggested, about $200. Again, he said it would be good for both Computer Aided Design (CAD) as well as gaming, but I'm leary of sales people. I'm mostly into the Flt Sim but dream of more free time to just play... PilotTim

T6520 seemed slow to me after set-up so I ran free tests at PCPITSTOP.com which confirmed some software might be a drag on the system. After uninstall of supplied anti-virus and spyware and new install of Zone Alarm Suite and Ad-aware, & Spybot reran Pitstop and results confirmed major improvement in speed. 2. Upgraded memory to 2 sticks of 1GB via Newegg.com, Kingston memory, for a good price. Seems to run some apps faster now. 3. Called e-machines about issue of upgrading Power Supply (ATX 300 watt is installed), they said it would void warranty. Most PCI-E high end cards say 400 watt PSU is recommended. Still thinking about this. 4. Looked into installing a second hard drive maybe SATA, but emachines says a SATA controller card needed and I read somewhere that without a direct connect to the motherboard SATA would run at the slower EIDE speed so this should be confirmed before going in this direction. 5. Replaced factory CD-RW with Pioneer A109 burner easy install thanks to Windows OS. The factory DVD-RW drive in mine appears to be made by LG. I found new firmware updates for this drive somewhere on the LG website and they installed with no problem. 6. Misc. My old Dell 8200 was pretty quiet the fans in the T6520 seem much louder to me. But given the attrative price of this PC I can live with it. So far no crashes or major problems. Found Best Buy Geek Squad was more knowledgable than the e-machine phone or on-line chat mode support. Glad I got the extended warranty. Hope this info is helpful to anyone considering this PC.

I also immediately removed included Norton and MacAfee software which has improved performance (Symantec is of course, parasitic and I had to use THEIR removal tool to get rid of it). eMachine's phone support and on-line chat leave MUCH to be desired. Unless you're certified, I'd suggest you contact them (and only if you have to) TWICE before doing anything they say-just to make sure the suggestions are consistent (I have the chat log where to remove Symantec, I only needed to delete the folders!!). Unit does not seem noisy to me. I have the DVD burner and a plain CD (not sure where Trion32's CD-RW comes from-my drives are Lite On). Was told power supply only 250 watts. Whether 250 or 300, it seems low ball especially when everyone (else) sees a new video card install. Sound is fine by me, but you only have jacks for speakers and a mic although system supposedly supports Dolby 6.1 (? isn't there normally a woofer type jack). Could they have put a balance control in? Not sure either about &quot;Media Center PC&quot; since you need a card for that-so what did I get. If you're not service hungry, still seems like a great buy.

That's an oldie, and flight sim X is rather demanding, so I'm not confident you'll get satisfactory performance without basically replacing the whole computer. But check which slot types you have. That age there were PCI-express, but it'd be good to check the format before you buy a card for it.
