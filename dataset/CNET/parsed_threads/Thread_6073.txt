<s> Like i said any feedback would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Let's say you hook up to your HDTV and receiver. </s>
<s> Did you know the sound card is unused? </s>
<s> Why get a sound card today? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You have a mid tower case. </s>
<s> Why use a micro mobo? </s>
<s> That thing might give you a headache when you start fitting in parts. </s>
<s> Think clearance around stuff. </s>
<s> Shop for an atx mobo. </s>
<s> HDD - Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB/Western Digital Caviar Blue 500GB Not sure if that means your going to get one or two.....but anyway do some reading about this style unit. </s>

<s> I use mostly flac files for my music, gaming off course much clearer on the ATH-M30. </s>
<s> the reciever will be hooked to the sound card. </s>
<s> The reaon for a micro is that i will need only 1 GPU and 1 pci-e and just 2 memory stics, i don't think i need other features except those. </s>
<s> And the 500 will be for the OS, the 2T for all the files. </s>
<s> Analog links and sound cards are pretty old ideas. </s>
<s> Hi BellusDeus, I agree with Bob about the motherboard size. </s>
<s> In addition to his point about clearance, I'd say ventilation/heat may become another issue in the long term. </s>
<s> Your CPU, GPU will run hot, especially when playing games. </s>
<s> The more space for ventilation you have the better... </s>
<s> Note, the CoolerMaster Hyper 212 EVO will help cooling the CPU, but it's large in size and won't do much for your GPU. </s>
<s> Plus, when thinking of all the internal cables (i.e. </s>
<s> SATA), power cables (both the PSU and GPU) it will get tight in there... </s>
<s> The Case you're buying has tons of room, and it comes with 3 fans, I suggest getting 2 more...to ensure you get max ventilation. </s>
<s> Good luck Sam </s>
<s> Just buy an ssd or Western digital caviar green hardisk it will boost your pc performance </s>
