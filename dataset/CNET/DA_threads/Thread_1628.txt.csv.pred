1.1.1	I was thinking aboutgetting something like the D-link DSM-320 or Hauppauge MediaMVP , but neither have very good reviews either because they acted inconsistently w/ different file types or streamed low-quality media .	St
1.1.2	the Turtle Beach AudioTron got rave reviews , but it only deals with audio files ( albeit very well ) .	St
1.1.3	If anyone can point me to a good device that can stream both audio and video from an external hard drive , I 'd greatly appreciate it !	St
1.2.1	I 'm in the same boat .	St
1.2.2	Was looking at PRISMIQ 's Media Player .	St
1.2.3	Have you looked at it .	St
1.2.4	I 've seen it rated fairly high .	St
