does anyone have any great ideas about how to get data off of my ext hd?
the hard drive (used successfully less than 1 month) is definitely bad, and wd support says &quot;well if possible, move all data off the drive.
at this point, you will need to have the drive replace.&quot; running winxp, ext hd is western digital passport 160gb.
have tried connecting ext hd to a desktop, just in case problem was with my laptop - no good.
when i connect ext hd, all is good.
then once i start to actually use the thing, it eventually stops responding so i disconnect ext hd, reconnect, and resume.
generally, can copy a few files over to laptop before it stops, but with over 40gb already on there, i could be at this all year.
anyone have any ideas?
i am furious about the cavalier attitude that wd is taking about my data!
