with real thin/sharp test leads, you can probe the voltages from the rear of the molex connector on the mobo from the power supply.
The voltages of interest are the Main 5 volts, the 3.3 volts, and the +12 volts.
The minus voltages are of no interest.
The 5 volt standby voltage should be there anytime that the power supply is plugged into a live outlet [and the switch on the rear of the supply is on].
This voltage is what allows the logic circuits to turn on the main voltages by a momentary contact power switch.
I'm accusing you of being a human being, LOL and 30 plus years of troubleshooting taught me that 95% of the time the trouble was caused by a human being having been working inside the equipment.
First simply recheck evcery possible connection et al that might have gotten disturbed whether intended or not.
BTW, I include myself as a human being that can screw things up unintentionally.
