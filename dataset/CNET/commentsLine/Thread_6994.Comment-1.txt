i have a pc, running xp, that has a dual head s-vga video card.
it came with a cable which splits it to two vga outs.
so i comfortably run two monitirs at a decent relolution.
one goes to a projector, the other to my monitor.
cool beans.
now i have a need for an additional s-video out (carrying the same signal as the projector), which goes to a video switcher, and ultimately to a dvd recorder.
what is the simplest way to accomplish this?
i have an older all-in-wonder card that could be installed at no cost, but will xp allow that?
