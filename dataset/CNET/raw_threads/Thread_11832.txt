My needs are simple: use the notebook to access my LAN and the Internet (cable modem to desktop). That's it. I want to take full advantage of the capabilities of the notebook's card, but I don't need the sun, the moon and the stars. I don't do gaming or watch films through the router. The max distance involved is probably less than 100 feet. I've noticed that user comments on CNET always rate routers lower than the CNET reviews, which isn't very helpful. I also want one that has better documentation and support than that provided by D-Link.

A while back I got a Linksys (read Cisco) WRT-350N. Worked until it didn't, the wireless died. Before that I had a D-link something else until it died. I had the Linksys repaired (under warranty). While I was waiting on it I got a D-link DIR-655. Both the latest Linksys and D-link are gigabit wired and wireless N. The D-link is now running and the repaired Linksys is still in the box. Long story short, what's the best? Ford or Chevy. It's hard to say which one is better. I get good wired speeds and the wireless is powerful. In reality, I have found by experience that D-link has better documentation and support. When I sent questions to each one, only D-link replied in a timely manor. I even got a phone call from an email question. Not saying Linksys is bad, they just took too long to reply. Maybe a fluke. Just get a name brand. And remember this for wireless. As distance increases, speed decreases.
