at least you can give it a test before you decide.
can i share an observation here?
a few get upset over the lack of drivers as the years roll by.
while i can explain why this is so what i want to write is this -&gt; many get so upset they write &quot;i'll never buy from them again.&quot; here's my observation.
this issue is not limited to just a few makers.
i've seen this happen with every product over the years from each maker.
however i have had good luck with windows 7 xp mode where i use an old outdated no driver will ever be found usb microscope.
this device has been very nice to capture pictures of stuff i need to document.
it would be a shame to work that hard and for some there is that cost to upgrade to windows 7 pro or higher so vuescan is likely the cheap exit unless there is a new all in one that is cheaper than vuescan.
