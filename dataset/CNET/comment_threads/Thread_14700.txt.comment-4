You can't imagine the hoops I see our software jump through all because the CPU didn't do 64 bit integer math.
But for 99.9999% of users at this time that does not mean the end of 32-bit.
In fact, my PDA is 16 bit.
Since OS and such are still available for 8 bitters today, you may have to alter your question a bit to exclude non-Mac or PCs in general.
