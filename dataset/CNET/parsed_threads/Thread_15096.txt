<s> Hi, we've just got a new MacBook and have been trying for days to get it to connect to our router. </s>
<s> Here are the details: It's a Netgear DG834Gv3 with the latest V4.01.40 firmware. </s>
<s> We've tried (amongst others) WPA-PSK with a network key composed of 19 letters/numbers. </s>
<s> We've tried broadcasting it on channels 09, 11 and 06. </s>
<s> &quot;Enable Wireless Access Point&quot;, &quot;Allow Broadcast of Name (SSID)&quot; are checked and &quot;Wireless Isolation&quot; is unchecked. </s>
<s> It is set to mode &quot;g & b&quot;. </s>
<s> The Wireless Station Access list is turned off so anyone can join the network, provided they have the passphrase. </s>
<s> The MacBook is the latest 2.1 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo with OS X 10.5.6. </s>
<s> It has been serviced. </s>
<s> The MacBook will connect to other wireless networks and our Netgear will connect to all our other devises but not the MacBook. </s>
<s> It insists that the password is invalid when we select our network - either that or it just says &quot;connection timeout&quot;. </s>
<s> We've tried disabling the Netgear security altogether but the MacBook just asks for a WEP password. </s>
<s> Please, can anyone help us? </s>
<s> I have no idea why it won't connect. </s>
<s> Why I ask is someone did that and promptly began asking questions not unlike yours. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There is no firewall set on the MacBook, that I know of. </s>
<s> The security settings preference pane is set to &quot;Allow all incoming connections&quot;. </s>
<s> http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.4/en/mh1042.html Also try our Mac OS Forum since we have someone that is very Apple there. </s>
<s> Sadly I'd call the router maker and lodge your complaint fast. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> but sadly that's not an option, Netgear have nightmare callcentres - Indian phone operators, premium call costs, long holds, making one set up an account so that they can send you promotional e-mails - the works. </s>
<s> I think it would cost more than the price of the Router. </s>
<s> My calls have been not so bad. </s>
<s> Here, everything works fine but I don't have that model of router. </s>
<s> Shame. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This is a regular complaint -- but the upside is that their user forum at www.netgear.com has to be pretty good and one of the moderators uses Macs. </s>
<s> Incidentally I've had problems connecting a friend's Mac laptop and desktop to two different routers (Zoom 802.11B, D-Link 802.11G). </s>
<s> The laptop would connect to the Zoom but not the DLink and the Desktop would only connect to the DLink. </s>
<s> Maybe something to do with WEP vs WPA -- we spent a week on this and gave up on the laptop. </s>
<s> I suspect Apple want you to buy their router. </s>
<s> Oh my God, I may actually have the answer to this one (one of the 7 signs I think). </s>
<s> I recently set up a Netgear wireless with my MacBook and was having the same issue... </s>
<s> I was told to set the VPI# to 0 (zero) VCI# to 32 BAM it was working. </s>
<s> Just a thought. </s>
<s> Hope this is right. </s>
<s> CJG </s>
<s> I haven't tried connecting the MacBook to it, but when I applied your settings the computer the Netgear is wired to could not load any Web pages. </s>
<s> The original setting are: Multiplexing Method: VC-BASED VPI: 0 VCI: 38 DSL Mode: Auto (Multi-mode) Are these alright? </s>
<s> I have a similar issue with an ibook g3 not connecting or accepting my wpa password for my wireless network. </s>
<s> All other computers in my home accept it but this one and I have other macs. </s>
<s> I am not familiar with VPI & VCI could you be a little clearer for me and walk me through what you are suggesting so I can try to fix? </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Like I said, it was kind of a miracle that I had that much of an answer, I think it will take a call to Netgear to get you the rest of the way, sorry. </s>
<s> Problem seemed familiar so tossed out what solved it for me. </s>
