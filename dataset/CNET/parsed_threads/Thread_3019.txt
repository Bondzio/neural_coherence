<s> I have a Toshiba Satellite M115-S3094 with the below specs. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade to a larger drive. </s>
<s> How much more performance am i likely to get from a 7200RPM drive vs. another 5400? </s>
<s> How much will it effect the heat and the battery of the system? </s>
<s> Cost is not a significant factor and i will probably get a Seagate. </s>
<s> I am going to post this in the storage, peripherals, and BOL, please if you answer only answer once not in all three unless you have something different to say. </s>
<s> I value ya'lls i9mput, thanx, Bill 1.6GHz, due, Intel T2050 1GB RAM 533MHz FSB 80GB 5400RPM internal SATA </s>
<s> To avoid the heat and battery problems use a 5400 RPM drive. </s>
<s> To avoid compatibility problem use the hard drive brand that is currently installed. </s>
<s> What are you really after here more speed or more hard drive storage? </s>
<s> Choose one or add a second item to your post. </s>
<s> I clocked my old 4200 boot time at just over 4 minutes on the old 4200 RPM and the clone copy onto a spiffy new 5400 clocked just under 2 minutes. </s>
<s> But don't expect that to happen from 5400 to 7200. </s>
<s> Also if your laptop has any heat issues, don't go faster... </s>
