I've been looking for better cooling for my CPU lately.
While browsing newegg I bumped into this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835118223 It says it comes with a heatsink but I don't see it.
It has great reviews but I don't see how something like that can be effective.
Can anyone point out what I'm not seeing in this (Besides the fact that its a Zalman.
I know they have a good reputation.
)?
