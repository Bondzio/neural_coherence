<s> I was wondering if anyone could tell me how many amps this power supply has? </s>
<s> http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=23844&vpn=RP-500-PCAR&manufacture=COOLERMASTER I feel foolish but i dont know the symbol for amps :S (i would assume it would be an A...) The ati shopping site reccomends atleast 30 amps on your power supply for the x1950, does this mean i shouldnt buy anything without that or is that just to be safe? </s>
<s> (if i misunderstand then let me know :D) Thanks </s>

<s> Your link states that it is a model RP-500-PCAR. </s>
<s> Odd--the Cooler Master link doesn't show the amps in the specifications list: http://www.coolermaster-usa.com/Products.aspx?pid=1238 However, if you click on the pictures, you will see a table showing all the amp ratings. </s>
<s> There are three key voltages used by computer components. </s>
<s> 12 volts, 3.3 Volts, and 5 volts. </s>
<s> If the card needs 30 amps on the 5 volt line, having 30 amps on the 12 volt line won't help a bit if the 5 amp only has 10 amp capabiliy. </s>
<s> Another reply told you how to see the specs for each of the voltages. </s>
<s> Convert each to watts and then read more, the supply normally cannot supply the sum of the three wattages, thus they also post a specification about the maximum total power for the combination of two or three. </s>
