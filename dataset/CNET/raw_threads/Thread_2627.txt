I need to get a new flat screen monitor and also was wanting to have a TV in my office. Can't I combine the two? I was thinking about getting one of those LCD monitors that are thin and lightweight for convenience. What specifications would my computer hardware and new monitor need? I have a video card with Dual DVI-I, HDTV/Video out on it. I want to to be able to watch my satelite tv on it. Any help on what I should look for would be greatly appreciated. Chris

TV to try it out))
