software cpu cooling can be very helpfull.
allowing the cpu to cool durring all those unused cycles.
it works expecially well on my athlon xp 1700+ which went from 115f to 97f normal temp.
with cpuidle extreme.
also big fans, my 120mm keeps my two hds at just a hair above room temperture most of the time.
