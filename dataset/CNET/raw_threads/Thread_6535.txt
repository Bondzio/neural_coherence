We work mostly with files 1 to 10mb and sometimes with larger files (up to 300 - 400mb). We are moving files over the network from workstations to server and backwards (we have a file check out system on the server). At this time we are 4 desingers, but I need a solution that works up to 8 / 10 peole. We are moving from our office to a new location, and I'm thinking to install only a WLAN network but I don't know if the speed would be good for me. At this time we are working ok on a 100mbps wired network. I heard that 802.11n have speeds up to 300mbps (that's 3 times faster), but I don't know if that's only in theory or if in practice it will work at that speed. So I have the next questions: 1) The 300mbps of 802.11n are true on practice or only on theory on &quot;ideal&quot; situations? 2) If we connect 3 users at the same time, what will happen with the speed? we have to split the total speed between all the users connected? 3) Is there any problem right now with security and availability for WLANs? 4) I'm considering Linksys WRVS4400N router. It's good or there are better routers for this? 5) What would be a nice configuration for me? (router, access point, switch... I don't know what I need) Thanks a lot! Nacho

If you get a n router and don't replace the wireless cards in the computers, then they can only use the g parft of the router, which in case connect at 54.0 Mbps LAN would be the fastest. Rick

I'm not 100% positive whether it is the router or the WPC4400n cards. You will have to get N cards or as a previous respondent indicated, you will only connect at g speeds. One security note, since you are using this in a business environment, I presume you will be using WPA-Enterprise. If so, you will want to use WZC and not Linksys Network Monitor to configure the cards. The reason for this is that LNM does not give you the option of validating the server certificate, and this would leave you vulnerable to a type of man in the middle attack referred to as a validation failure attack. While this attack rather sophisticated, and is quite hard to mount, it is a concern nonetheless. I hpe this helps. Rob
