the dw-u18a see discussions like this... &quot;only use discs that the writer does like.
the solution here is to stop using the dvd-r discs that don't work.
a firmware update probably will not help you because your current firmware is not old enough to be significantly improved upon by a firmware update.&quot; 1. are you using dvd-r?
2. did it ever work?
3. with what make/type media?
4.  looks like you are not alone.
i'd get another model, but do try dvd+rw or dvd-rw until you sort it out.
have you been talking to the supplier?
