I have a winsows xp pro bootable cd and a backup dvd from compaq, i hear that sata is the fastest technology around so i thought i should switch to sata since its really cheap nowadays, i was just making sure that i have sata ports in my motherboard and btw i don't have any motherboard cd from compaq all they gave me was a cpu and some manuals.
i hope it will help me during the switch.
THX FOR THE HELP.
Moreover UDMA is the wierdest technology i mean i never see a UDMA harddrive in a staples store or a tech website.
