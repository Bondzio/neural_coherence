1.1.1	Hi all , Here is the senario , Planing to share a 1MB ADSL line with 4 neighbours at least 100mts apart from each others VIA wireless .	St
1.1.2	I was designing the network with a Linksys WAG200G ADSL Router and 3 Linksys Access-Points .	St
1.1.3	Would the above idea be a good choice for the routers and the access-points .	St
1.1.4	Are there better routers with excellent distance of coverage .	St
1.1.5	For a 1MB ADSL line will the Linksys WAG200G Router be enough ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	You may find that signal strength is poor at that range .	St
1.2.2	These are not very strong signal transmitters , and distance , walls , and other dvices on the 2.4GHz waveband can interfere with the reception .	St
1.2.3	A better solution would be wire to the other houses .	Sug
