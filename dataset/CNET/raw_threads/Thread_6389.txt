I have only seen 1 review for it so far. I need some USB drives to backup important Word, Excel files and to backup the programs I download from the Internet for my Palm. I am backing up programs, but I will not be running the programs from the USB drive. Storage is all that I'm looking for. I ask about this particular drive 'cause it's on sale at a good price. Thanks for any help/advise Regards Fritzmom

But I was disappointed to find out that you can not reuse it when you try to delete old files from the USB and replace it with another file, a message will pop up that says you can not store anymore because there is no enough space. when I checked the general preference the capacity showed USED: 7.69 GB on disk (7,685,210,112 bytes), where in fact the only data stored left is (Micro USB quick start up guide) only. Unlike my other USB which is of course another brand, I can always delete old movie files and replace it with new ones. But I will appreciate if anyone can tell me if there is a way to reuse the drive. By the way I am using MAC. Thank You

Just too many issues arises and all the requests for help can't always be fixed. You still need to store the most precious of your data to discs as a more safer place. That doesn't mean you can't use flash drives, just don't don't store them there indefinitely. As for flash drives sales, they come and go. There will always be another one either at brick fronts or online stores on sale. In my experience, I've used Toshiba and Kingston drives with good results. HOWEVER, don;t fall for super cheap drive like A-Data, etc or any that seem to pop-up on sale often. tada -----Willy
