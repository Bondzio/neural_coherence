12693	0	287794	2729264	NR	hikergirl	3/14/08 1:18 PM	1.20550068E12	I have jammed the disc drive door on my HP CPU.	I have an HP e-pc 40 and, if it matters, I'm running Windows XP Pro SP2. Some time ago, I tripped over the open disc drive door (it's a vertical operation) and one of the trim guides came off. As long as I'm careful, I have had no problem, until today. The last time I inserted a photo CD, the tray went in with a little bit of resistance. Now, when I push the eject button, it clicks. Something has become jammed. I unplugged everything and tried to pry the door open, but without success. I am not financially able to send this out to get the door released. Does anyone have any simple instructions for someone who is not computer literate? Any help you can give would be gratefully accepted and appreciated. Thanks.

Its there exactly for that reason. Unfortunately some drives may not have it, but most do. Using that pin hole place a straighten paper clip and push in with some care. This will mechanically unleash the door. Once all this is done, you should more carefully review what is making this stick, it will only happen again sooner or later. There's also the chance the track that drives the door open/close is cracked or broken, so take into acct. if replacement becomes necessary as you can't repair it(usually). tada -----Willy

Make sure you're hitting the release mechanism, you may have to play it. Make sure, system if OFF. Otherwise, you will need to crack open case, dismount the CD drive. Once in hand repeat the above steps. If you do this. correct any possible physical bezel problems. Also, if yours does this, the bezel on the actual door itself can be removed, IF!!! this isn't part of the fancy system case itself. Once in hand, you'll see what I mean. The door cover/bezel can snap or unclip off. If none of this works, then you have more than likely a broken track or physical damage, replace CD drive for continued hassle free operation. The decal on the CD drive will denote what model# it is should you order from HP or other source. tada -----Willy

Last night, a friend who is a mechanical engineer and used to rebuild jet engines and worked at TVA, called to thank me for something. I happened to think maybe he could help. He just left my house (3/15 @ 4pm) and was able to disassemble the CD-ROM drive, get the door open, straighten the guides, and reassemble everything. The drive loads and plays, the door opens and closes. I am a happy woman. Thanks again everyone.
