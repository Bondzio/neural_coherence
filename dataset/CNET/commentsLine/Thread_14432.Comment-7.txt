my entire house is apple.
at first i wanted to go &quot;cheap&quot; , dont try that, trust me.
we bought a linksys wireless router at first, but it was terrible, the reception was poor and several times a day it would freeze.
my inlaws who use pc's have the same problem.
we returned the equipment and decided to cough up the money on the apple airport extreme router.
the best money we have ever spent.
the reception is great and not only that, it will support pc's too.
our house is 3500 sq ft and it works great, except for one of our bathrooms.
for a while.
i just recently purchaced the airport express and basicaly set it up to where it acts as a repeater so it expanded my coverage to where it works all over my back yard and now the upstairs bathroom gets full signal.
i only bought it so the kids and i could use a printer upstairs instead of printing and runing downstairs to get our print out.
another cool thing about the express is that it has a port on the side to plug your stereo into it and wirelesly stream your music from any computer to your stereo.
if you have a new laptop, chances are that you already have a wireless card, if you are unsure just click on the apple icon in the top left and select &quot;about this mac&quot; then click on &quot;more info&quot; and select airport card.
trust me, you need to use an apple product, you wont be disapointed.
