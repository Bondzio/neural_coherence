It also has a Hercules Prophet 8500LE, A 20GB Maxtor and it's in A modded case. Basically everytime the PC is booted up, it crashes on the XP splash screen, I think it's at the Hardware detection part (Where the optical mouse and keyboard flash). It used to require turn off from the plug, and after restart would load windows normally, but now it does it twice, allways following the Same pattern, I have tried re-installing windows many times but to no avail, what shall I do, Most parts of the PC are 5+ Years old so I would not be suprised if something is not working, But what?

The power supplies had to be updated. An aging supply could be the cause. Since it's under the 1GHz mark, any 350 Watt supply will do. Could be under 20 bucks to remove this from the issues list. Bob

Bad capacitors, the large ones located in the vicinity of the CPU, look for puffed up ones or leaky goo around the bottom of the caps. The vintage of your machine is a candidate for this one. Power Supply going bad.

No leaks capacitors e.t.c

My bet is they were all 300 or less Watts. In closing, you need to run this memory test. http://www.memtest86.com What failures do you find? Bob

Run Memory test provided and reduce to one chip. Un-plug all devices and remove cards. Check BIOS for up-date. Run Mnf diagonstic on HDD. &quot;I have tried re-installing windows many times but to no avail, what shall I do,&quot; you can do this till the cows come home... won't do you any good till the bad hardware is found.

There's no place to plug in the 4 pin 12 volt connector.
