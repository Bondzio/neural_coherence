This happened to my laptop and desktop when I was burning dvds. I thought that maybe the drives broke so today I went out and bought an external sony dvd drive and guess what same thing. I have uninstalled the drivers, windows and just about everything else and in out of ideas so please help!

WinXP natively recognizes and will burn CD but when it comes to DVD, I'd describe WinXP as 'DVD' unaware. I don't think a CD-DVD burner under WinXP will be recognized as DVD without some DVD SW loaded. VAPCMD

It's there software. If this doesn't fix the problem you might need a new CD/DVD drive driver. What brand is it? See device management in your OS for this information. Post it here. Technologies do change and drivers do need up dating from time to time. I check all my drivers in device manager every 6-9 months. Just right click on an item and choose update driver. Sometimes this doesn't work and you have to search them down. eSupport.com has a tool that might help.

It can't calculate anything about blank CDs or DVDs. It doesn't know what kind of disk is in the drive at all. I presume it defaults to CD because they've been around longer. Only your DVD software can look at the drive to see if it's DVD capable and attempt to access the disk. If nothing's on it, it cannot view it.
