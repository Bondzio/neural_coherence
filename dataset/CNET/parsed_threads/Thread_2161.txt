<s> Hi built a new system but things are a bit touch and go. </s>
<s> The whole computer cuts out when i try to play gtlegends or after playing Call of Duty 2 for a while. </s>
<s> And i guess it will be the same for any other resource heavy program. </s>
<s> I bought a 600w PSU for a bit more than 15 and i take it that means its that not being able to hold a stable enough voltage or something like that? </s>
<s> Thanjs for any help, i'd really like to sort this out. </s>
<s> Two issues are prone to a demanding system; heat a stable power. </s>
<s> While a crappy psu can cause problems it is further compounded by the fact, the psu also is the 2ndary exhaust port for build-up not only of the psu but the system case as well. </s>
<s> If the system case is &quot;hot&quot; then expect the psu to be that much hotter. </s>
<s> The hotter it gets the less stable the psu, crappy or not. </s>
<s> Sooner or later it crops up. </s>
<s> On top of all that, a gamin system is far more demanding of its componets than typical home use. </s>
<s> All in all, gaming is pushing whatever you have to it limits, especially if tweeked to do so, as I've yet seen any gamer not have hi-end options for a game NOT tuened on. </s>
<s> if the game itself isn't causing a problem, then expect the componets to less than desired. </s>
<s> Otherwise, more cooling and attention to a DYI build system to overcome, heat, improper assemby, weak componets, and/or lousy cooling. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Hi Vimesey, Wouldn't rule out the power supply, but it could also be either a config problem or a cooling problem. </s>
<s> How does your computer 'cut'? </s>
<s> Are we talking about a bluescreen, a sudden reboot, or does the thing just power off? </s>
<s> In the case of the two first symptoms, it may well be that something's up with your BIOS config. </s>
<s> I had a misconfigured PC reboot on me without any warning once when I tried installing McAfee enterprise... </s>
<s> Took a while to figure out that it was a setting for the graphic card that was triggering it! </s>
<s> If the computer just powers off, it could be in order to prevent overheating. </s>
<s> Granted, this is usually more frequent with laptops; however, I wouldn't discard that possibility. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Red. </s>
<s> I forgot to say its these specs: Gigabyte DS3 Mobo Intel core 2 duo e6300 Ati x1900GT 2GB Crucial Ballistix DDR2 667MHz And my cooling, apart from the psu, is a 12cm fan for the exhaust, 12cm fan at the front for intake, and a 25cm side intake fan. </s>
<s> As to your question, there is no blue screen or anything, it just suddenly turns off and reboots. </s>
<s> Any idea what bios etting could cause this? </s>
<s> Mmmh, can't be too sure... </s>
<s> It had to do with the graphics card, some advanced setting of some sort. </s>
<s> I could remember it if I saw it but apart from that, not sure. </s>
<s> Silly question: can you confirm that both fans are working? </s>
<s> Take care, Red. </s>
<s> For a test run, leave the cover off. </s>
<s> If it works fine then you've found the cause. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I usually recommend besides the beforehand advise, to remove the side cover of the system. </s>
<s> Then if it settles down, you have a heat issue. </s>
<s> Understand any componet besides the cpu could be heat stressed and cause a reboot. </s>
<s> The psu is prone to such and if the cpu reaches a certain hi-temp(bios setting) it's response is to reboot or shutdown, and/or go into alarm(if on). </s>
<s> Weak ram if pushed too much or failing itself can also cause a reboot or lock-up. </s>
<s> Try all this and get back to us. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I bought a 600w PSU for a bit more than 15 and i take it that means its that not being able to hold a stable enough voltage or something like that? </s>
<s> Exactly. </s>
<s> NEVER cheap out on the PSU; it's what's powering your whole system. </s>
<s> If it's not stable, then your computer's not stable. </s>
<s> If it dies, then your computer (or at least parts of it) die. </s>
<s> Turned out i didn't see BSOD because my computer was set to not show me. </s>
<s> Now i've seen the BSOD i'm convinced my power supply is fine. </s>
<s> The BSOD reports the problem to be one of two things, some times it is a &quot;Page fault in non paged area&quot;, and others it is something to do with &quot;ati3duag.dll&quot;. </s>
<s> Could a driver fix fix this? </s>
<s> Also new, when playing call of duty 2, it sometimes now just closes after a while instead of the whole computer dying. </s>
<s> The PC gives the usual sorry this had to close error, and if i try to play it again, as soon as i start an actual game, it repeats this closing immediatley. </s>
<s> By the way, its a SANSUN 600W. </s>
<s> Thanks very much for helping me try ans solve this, any more ideas? </s>
<s> ATI3DUAG.dll is part of your video driver library, get the latest drivers or at least reload the current video drivers. </s>
<s> It appears that error is known, so google for other corrective actions if so warranted. </s>
<s> Also, if your video ram gets too hot, that too can be at fault, as a weak ram chip peteers out, so swap if possible or try another video card. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Firslty, i looked at other forums with people with this problem, and i havn't seen one good solution found. </s>
<s> I don't know where to find a newer driver, windows can't find one, my version is 6.14.10.0425. </s>
<s> This is really getting me down, i thought building a pc would be easy enough, but mine is pretty useless, its so frustrating. </s>
<s> I might try running memtest86 or MS memory diagnostic to test things. </s>
<s> Would that be a good idea? </s>
<s> If so, what kind of result would i be looking for? </s>
