for college dorm.
I have a Canon PIxma 1700 but it appears that this prints text as composite color, I can't seem to see where it will just print black from black cartridge..?
I really hate it when printer manufacturers make it so you have to buy a new color cartridge because one color runs out -- when you are basically only printing text.
Are there any HP printers that work well and use black cartridge for text, that are under $100?
Or any other suggestions?
THANKS
