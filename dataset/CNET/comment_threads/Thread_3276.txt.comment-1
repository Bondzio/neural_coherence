I have been considering to buy a netbook for basic applications like -web browsing -downloading stuff(download a lot of movies) -watching movies and listening to music -typing and editing documents I am considering Dell Mini,Sony Vaoi VPCM126AG/P and HP Mini 210series My prime concerns are: -Would a netbook be able to pull maximum internet speeds?
I am currently using a broadband internet connection of 1Mbps.
-How much of multitasking can it handle?
For instance how comfortably can it pull web browsing (with multiple tabs on), editing documents,a download in progress while a movie is running simultaneously?
-Could you name a few softwares that are likely to bringdown its performance, the ones I better steer clear of..
Please help me decide if netbook is a good choice at all Thanks a ton!
