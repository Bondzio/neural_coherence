<s> Is there any software available, other than HP, that will do simple scans with the HP ScanJet 4850 scanner with DESCREEN ability? </s>
<s> When I installed the software that came with the scanner, it installed 10 separate software packages, and neither do a simple scan. </s>
<s> All are so complicated it is hard even to know which one to scan with. </s>
<s> I want to use PaperPort and it will use the scanner, but the DESCREEN capability is not there. </s>
<s> It only appears in HP Essential software, and to use it, the scanner makes 4 separate scans. </s>
<s> It does not seem possible to save any scan settings that include DESCREEN. </s>
<s> When I asked HP on-line help, I was told the answer would cost $25. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Aren't there options in the software load? </s>
<s> Should be FULL or CUSTOM, generally you have some options. </s>
<s> Browse the disk and see if there might not be a way to do what you want to do. </s>
<s> Many times if you load the FULL software package you will wind up with a lot of superfluous stuff you may never use. </s>
<s> I am NOT sure with HP units, Mustek and some other scanners have many options from which to choose but I would browse the disk and see what you might be able to do. </s>
<s> I'll look, but if it loads more than the 10 it has already loaded, I'll have to get a larger hard drive !! </s>
<s> I am trying a couple of generic scanner programs, &quot;Art-Copy&quot; and &quot;Pro-Vue&quot;. </s>
<s> Both run the scanner fine, and both say they will descreen, but having rpoblems finding that feature. </s>
<s> Probably have to buy before it works. </s>
<s> Thanks Jim West </s>
<s> I got to thinking about your issue, DESCREENING. </s>
<s> Generally that feature is part of a software package such as Adobe Photoshop and may not be packaged with basic software provided with a scanner. </s>
<s> You can probably download a generic version from the net. </s>
<s> Good luck!! </s>
