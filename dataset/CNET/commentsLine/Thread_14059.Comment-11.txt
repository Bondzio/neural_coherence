the issue is simple.
since xp (no sp1 or 2 on the cd) does not support over 127gb boot drives i have to issue a warning when &quot;xp&quot; is noted.
imagine the poor soul that uses clone software and expands the c drive to over 127gb then they need to repair the os.
you can imagine what happens next.
the xp cd can't touch that drive and we have no way to add over 127gb support to said cd.
yes there is that slipstreaming method but for most that's the deep end of the pool where the crocs live.
