I have a Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3L motherboard running an Intel Core 2 Duo E4400 @ 2.00GHz. I currently have (2) 1 gig sticks of OCZ PC2 6400 800 mhz Dual CH ram. The timing on those sticks is listed as 4-4-4-15. I couldn't pass up a good deal that I got online for (2) more 1 gig sticks for only $19.99 (after rebate). They area also OCZ PC2 6400 800 mhz Dual CH ram. I didn't realize when I purchased it that they have a different timing of 5-5-5. When I put all 4 in windows XP professional crashes. I understand that with the 32 bit version I will never see all 4 gigs, but 3 would be nice. My motherboard does have the ability to manually set the ram timing. I tried that and I am still getting crashes. I also took out the old ram and just booted off the new stuff to make sure I didn't get a bad stick. It worked fine. Does anyone have any idea how to get this working. This is the first computer that I have ever built. If I can't get it working it looks like these sticks are going on eBay. Thanks!

While you have very similar type you don't have true matched pairs and you see the result. If you have tweaked the ram at all, return or reduce ram demands abit in order to lessen speed, hopefully it can recover. You can play with the setting but start at more safe level then tweak up. Further, you have the OS limits and that may come into play. Then on top of that, the mtrbd. may need a bios update, see if one is available for such a cure and &quot;what it does&quot;. What happens when only 3 sticks are installed? Try with the new sticks alone, what happens? tada -----Willy

It crashed in about 5 minutes. 3 gigs were showing up at that time. I also tried just putting in the brand new sticks and taking out the old sticks. The computer booted fine with just the new ones.
