seems there may be a problem with 780g type motherboards.
i've sent some questions to gigabyte, hoping for an answer soon.
i'm wondering if the motherboard needs mounting in the case so that can provide a grounding plane for it.
the screw points have contacts at them, and wondering if maybe those need the screws to there to complete some of the circuits.
if so that would be a first to me, but about ready to entertain any such strange ideas.
same test setup, same problem.
this time i bench tested it on top of it's own box.
hooked onboard vga to monitor, plugged in a ps/2 standard keyboard, installed athlon 64x2 4200 using 65w power with it's approved hsf plugged to motherboard.
put in one stick of memory in slot 1. hooked up 575w psu to both the 24 pin and the 4 pin plugs on mobo.
short across the power pins and psu turns on, cpu's fan runs and still no post, no video to the monitor.
i've tried a pci card for video, swapped memory chips (different speed and maker!).
only thing i've not changed between both boards was trying a different cpu.
i've shorted the cmos pins, i even removed the battery and shorted across those terminals for awhile to make sure cmos chip would reset the bios.
nothing seems to work.
there's never been any heat detected from the cpu area, but then it's not been accessed either since it won't post.
i wanted this board for the solid capacitors, but right now i'd welcome the riskier electrolytic main capacitors just to have a motherboard that will benchtest easy and provide the gaming experience i know my youngest would appreciate.
right now i'm facing getting a different motherboard (probably a biostar) that will take the memory and processor i have and then mess around with gigabyte on getting something that works, since i've already done an rma with the vendor and not anxious to go that route again.
daughter's birthday is in a month and i want to finish it up now, not be left hanging on it till then.
