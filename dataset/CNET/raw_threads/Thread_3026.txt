Wouldn't put one of those in my PC. Re the TECH and overbuying wattage.......clear he doesn't know what he's talking about. Sure your X700 even has an PCIe power connector on it ? Last ATI X700 Pro I saw didn't. VAPCMD

VAPCMD..	in addition to the question of the psu fitting into the computer, sapphire says that they recommend at least 12v@25a for a mid level card. i think i have almost to much information for my own good. at this point, i'll spend what i need to for a psu that fits the bill. i know you gave me a recommendation for the FSP brand. are there others you would recommend as well? ones with steady voltage. or is that FSP sufficent for me? havent done volts and amps since jr. high. i would love for my search to finally end. thanks so much for all your help so far.

No PSU's to my knowledge have fans on the top (as you mention, this would place it right against the top plate of a case, and utterly useless). The picture shows the PSU's bottom because it has the fan, as the top of the unit is a blank plate, and is of no interest. I bet we're all glad they don't take pictures of PSU's standing on their end's and sides now! GB.

This is totally unscientific, but my cohorts and I have seen an abnormally high number of failures with Ultra PSUs, some of them catastrophic, ie- taking the whole rig down with them when they blow. In addition, many demanding systems just haven't been able to boot with Ultras, 'specially the V-series ( V alue?) Yeah, TigerDirect sells a lot of Ultra stuff - cases, power supplies, RAM, HSFs - but that doesn't mean that it's top-notch gear. The RAM - sucks. I got suckered in to it by a ton of rebates. Latencies are horrible and they don't overclock for squat. Only worth it if you get the huge rebates AND you don't have a demanding rig or plan on OCing.
