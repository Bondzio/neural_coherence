<s> Purchased a DVI cable from Newegg back in August 2006 for my NEC Multisync flat panel monitor, which worked fine. </s>
<s> Recently, I had to disassemble everything as we were having some work done around the house. </s>
<s> Now, I go to put everything back together and, low and behold, the DVI cable is missing. </s>
<s> As best as I can recall, my monitor has a female port (in case that matters in terms of what kind of cable I purchase). </s>
<s> I'd buy the same one, but it's been so long, Newegg doesn't carry it anymore. </s>
<s> Does it matter which DVI cable I purchase? </s>
<s> What should I be looking for? </s>
<s> Any suggestions on where/what to look at? </s>
<s> I'm looking to resolve this ASAP as I have no computer access while this issue lingers. </s>
