<s> I was hoping somebody could give me any kind of insight or solution to this. </s>
<s> I bought my original emachine in May, 2 weeks later it starts freezing up not matter when. </s>
<s> So I take it in and 2 more weeks later they tell me my motherboard is bad and need to replace and because its still rather new they were having trouble getting a serial number for it. </s>
<s> So they opted to exchange mine for the floor model they had there. </s>
<s> Well everything was fine until about a week after I had it, it started freezing up , not as bad as the first machine but the fact that it does is annoying. </s>
<s> so any help on the situation would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> what software did you install on it? </s>
<s> what's the temp of it? </s>
<s> did you add anything to it, e.g. </s>
<s> a soundcard, graphics card, etc.? </s>
<s> konny </s>

<s> I added Norton internet security, winamp, bitcomet, ccleaner,spysweeper, trillian, firefox. </s>
<s> the temp is set at a max of 65 and min of 55. </s>
<s> The only card i put in was a netgear wireless card. </s>
