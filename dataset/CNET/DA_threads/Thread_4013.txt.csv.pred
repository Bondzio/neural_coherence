1.1.1	& quot ; Mommy , there 's a monster in my computer. & quot ; was the first thing that popped into my head .	St
1.1.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814121213 This guy ( in the review ) has 2 of them in SLI .	St
1.1.3	I 'm going to pass out .	St
1.1.4	Imagine the power needed and the heat .	St
1.2.1	i wish i had 1400 to drop right now id rock 2 in no time .	St
1.2.2	; )	St
1.3.1	At almost $ 1800 for the two cards , you could build a decent gaming machine instead .	St
1.3.2	Although that is pretty awesome , there is no way I can ever afford something like that .	St
1.4.1	Wow what a card you showed .	St
1.4.2	These are some monsters I came across Check this card out : http : //www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp ? ProductCode=326030 And this one : http : //www.maximumpc.com/2005/10/gigabyte_gv-3d1_1.html	St
1.5.1	But you ca n't SLI the card you mentioned , cause it does n't have an SLI Bridge connector .	St
1.5.2	I think you mean only one ... .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	need a sli bridge connector anymore	St
1.8.1	I never knew that newer nvidia cards do n't need an SLI bridge .	St
1.8.2	Are you sure about this ?	Ques
1.8.3	Then how will the cards get connected to form SLI ?	Ques
1.8.4	throught the motherboard ?	Ques
1.9.1	I guess the reviewer was bluffing so it was deleted .	St
1.9.2	A & quot ; Real & quot ; Nvidia employee who had the card , said ; & quot ; Pros : This a very good selection however the poster above obviously does not have this card ( I DO ) and he is lying about working for NVIDIA because ( I DO ) it is importaint to know that this card runs in SLI ... on its OWN PCB board NOT 2 CARDS togeather similar to the 3D1 cards by GIGABYTE this card is just not AS limited as those others motherboard wise , what this board does is eliminate the space that hampers two seperate cards by mateing the two on one board wich gives it the advantage of the ( to be exact ) 27,203 score in 3dmark05 the score with a single core enabled is ( 11,138 ) you can not run quad cores YET ! ! ! ! !	St
1.9.3	and I think that it is wrong that people are lead to believe you can so the review was not written by a owner of this card so if you are a hard core gamer stick with two 7800GTX 's or GT 's they are the best choice right now for a two card SLI setup Cons : Have to use the drivers it comes with because until an update comes thats all you can use , This card is rather LARGE because of each core has 256mb DDR3 around it , it is double wide it comes out almos ... More t to the window to my case ( TT XASER3 ) thats it besides you CANT RUN QUAD CORES YET !	St
1.9.4	IT 'S HYPE & quot ;	St
1.10.1	http : //www.tomshardware.com/2005/12/14/sneak_preview_of_the_nvidia_quad_gpu_setup/index.html	St
1.11.1	Is that even possible ?	Ques
1.11.2	What I 'm saying is ; Is there a game that can take advantage of this power ?	Ques
1.11.3	I think this is more for bragging rights than actual use .	St
1.11.4	Hurray for conspicuous consumption .	St
1.11.5	^_^	St
