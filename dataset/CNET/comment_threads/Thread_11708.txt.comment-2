without knowing what you can afford, it's hard to make good suggestions.
for your cpu, the 6850 is a no-brainer... cheaper and faster than the 6700. forget the 8800gtx/768mb and 8800gts/640mb.
the only cards you should be looking at are the 8800gts/512mb and 8800gt/512mb.
The 8800gts/512 ($370) is almost as fast as an 8800gtx and $100 cheaper while the 8800gt/512 ($280) is faster than an 8800gts/640.
if the soyo hdtv is 1366x768, then an 8800gt/512 would be able to handle it.

if not, just get the p5k deluxe.
don't pay for features you won't use (firewire, wifi, dual gigabit ethernet, etc).
there's no difference between ddr2/ddr3 at the same speed.
ddr3 won't make a real performance difference (10%) until speeds greater ddr3-1500 come about and ddr3's price drops by 50%.
(is another 4fps really worth $250?).
so stick with low latency (cl3) ddr2-800 or a good ddr2-1066 kit.
both will OC to ddr2-1333 levels if you want.
