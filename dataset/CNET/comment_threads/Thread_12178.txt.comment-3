HDD..
The SYSTEM DRIVE(C:)should be ready for installation right out of the box..Empty..but ready for a Operateing System INSTALL..
If you want to CREATE a second HDD..for FILES/FOLDERS.. You need to set the PINS to CABLE SELECT[CS]or even SLAVE.. .. a SATA HDD..is no differant than your Standard HDD[IDE]ATA.. what SATA has offered is the USE of Multiple HDD's..and eliminateng the FLAT-DATA-Cable..useing the NEW----SATA Cable....this eliminates the Interference......of the FLAT-cable between the two DRIVES.. .. SATA-cables are hooked directly to the Motherboard..via the SATA-cable..I have 4-Connectors for SATA on my Intel D915GAG Mobo.... ..
Check the manufacturers website for INFO..
I use one SATA[System]and 4-Ext.HDD.. ..
The thing is its difficult to remember exactly what I set the PINS/its been running for over a year..
So you need to visit the WebSite for your Drive.
