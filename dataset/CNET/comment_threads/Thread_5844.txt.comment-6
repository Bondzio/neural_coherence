i used memtest86+ and there were no errors found.
I recently found out that I am running a DDR2 1066 533 Mhz but my motherboard only runs DDR2 1366+ so the RAM that I am using is incompatible with the motherboard.
Could this be the reason that my computer is doing all this?
should I swap my RAM for another one immediantly?
