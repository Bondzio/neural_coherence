we have an older computer made 2000-2001 probably, are master drive work by its self and so does the slave drive when the jumper is set to normal.
Also, the screen is acting up because it doesn't start from the beginning but when it says welcome the screen turns on,but when the master and slave are connected the don't turn on the screen.
Please help I can't figure it out
