1.1.1	I have an old dell dimension 2400 that i'm trying to get up and running.	St
1.1.2	I installed win xp with service pack 3 on it, and everything seems to work fine, except when i try to play a dvd or cd.	St
1.1.3	(BTW it has 1 gig of memory) I don't think it is hardware related.	St
1.1.4	When i try to play a dvd the sound is almost inaudible and along with the video it starts and stops.	St
1.1.5	The sound sometimes is almost ok but sounds like theres an echo.	St
1.1.6	The cd player is the same way, it plays the cd but starts and stops.	St
1.1.7	I can take both players out and install in another computer and they work just fine.	St
1.1.8	I worked on this for 3 or 4 days off and on and am about to get tired of messing with it.	St
1.1.9	I have run dell diagnostics and installed and reinstalled drivers and checked everything i know of but nothing seems to help.Anyone can help with this i'd sure appreciate it.....thanks	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	1.	St
1.3.2	Starts and stops has me think about the old XP DMA issue.	St
1.3.3	Link follows.	St
1.3.4	http://winhlp.com/node/10 2.	St
1.3.5	Echo.	St
1.3.6	I'm finding folk to not know their machine and I turn off sound effects like reverb in the sound control panels.	St
1.3.7	No, I can't tell you exactly where since this area is not standardized.	St
1.3.8	3.	St
1.3.9	Always try VLC PLAYER for Video DVD playback.	St
1.3.10	Bob	St
1.4.1	thanks for your reply, i had already tried the dma thing and tried it again today but seems to make no difference.	Polite
1.4.2	Using the vlc player also does nothing.	St
1.4.3	I just don;t get it, sound and videos play fine on everything except the dvd and cd players.	St
1.4.4	I can play videos on youtube and everything is good.	St
1.5.1	Swap drives and use one of those USB 3 dollar audio solutions to sniff out where the issue is.	St
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	what exactly is a (USB 3 dollar audio solution)	St
1.7.1	http://www.amazon.com/External-Sound-Adapter-Desktop-Notebook/dp/B000BUDHNQ/ This and a few others are under 3 so it's something you carry around to figure it out.	St
1.7.2	Bob	St
1.8.1	thanks for the info Bob, i've orsered one of these, but still don't understand how it can help with a audio and video problem while playing a cd or dvd from either player.	St
1.8.2	One is a Pioneer dvd rw and the other is a samsung cdrw drive.	St
1.8.3	But like i said i can put these in another computer and they work fine--thanks	St
1.9.1	When dealing with old gear you may have a failed sound card.	St
1.9.2	But I'm unsure how to convey that optical drives over 2 years old are iffy.	St
1.9.3	Some owners dig in their heels and you can't get them to change out an old drive.	St
1.9.4	So you let them be until they are serious about fixing the machine.	St
1.9.5	Bob	St
