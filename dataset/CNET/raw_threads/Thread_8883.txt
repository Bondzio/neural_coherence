In IE 7.0, everytime I use &lt;ctrl&gt; left click of mouse, it opens a new window. How do I set it so I may use the procedure to select mulitple items in a menu? 2. I am shopping for an internal CD/DVD RW. However in using newegg or tigerdirect, they give the connections but I have no idea which one is right for my computer. Nor can I find it in the specs of my manual. I have a Dell Dimension 4600 with Windows XP, Intel P4 2.4 GHz. Which connection is right? Thanks.
