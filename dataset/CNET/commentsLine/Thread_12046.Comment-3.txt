when i boot this machine with my win 98 startup disk i first get an error message about drive positions have been changed which makes sense because i removed two of the three hard drives.
but i left the top hd (the master?)
connected to the mobo.
i press f1 to continue bootup from error message and eventually get to windows 98 has detected that drive c does not contain a valid fat or fat32 partition...blah, blah, blah, no surprises here.
machine sees the startup floppy in a and gives me a normal a prompt.
i type in fdisk and get no fixed disks present.
does this have something to do with the jumpers?
these hard drives dont have the standard jumper choices ma, sl, cs that im used to.
rather, they have 6 choices: led, res, bit3, bit2, bit1, bit0.
which one(s) do i jump?
and to further confuse me, there appears to be another set of jumpers on the front of the hd which have choices: te, ds, me, wp, pd, res, tp, tp.
none are currently jumped.
im obviously dealing with a different animal here.
