I have the CD supplied with the motherboard - and don't know if the guy who built it used it or downloaded drivers!
Is it likely that this will be the driver package you refer to and in which case do I simply load it and see what happens.
Any likelihood of screwing things up as I am not competent in this area?
Thanks
