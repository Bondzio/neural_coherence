i found information about the x64 print server:  .
my vista x64 has a new local port added to the printer, as does the local printer on my xp x86 (same port name).
there may be an x64/x86 issue here, according to one poster.
on the xp machine, right click on the vista printer seen on the network and clicking on properties required a printer driver install first with a window which allowed me to select the already installed printer driver, but connecting to the printer still requests the driver without giving the option to select an installed driver (and only allows browsing the disk for drivers which it will not accept.
