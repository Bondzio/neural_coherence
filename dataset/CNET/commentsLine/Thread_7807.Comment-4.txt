is where you rma boards and change make, models till you get a good one.
today those that pick boards may find things that don't work, arrive with out of date bios or other issues.
the &quot;sellers&quot; are often just dispensers for the boxes and not support.
i do not have your hardware to play with but share the comment fix.
