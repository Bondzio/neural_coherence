I installed some new software and connectd a new device to the serial port (to update the GPS database of an Origin B2). The computer froze up, and all attempts at restarting freeze at the Windows 2000 logo screen, with the progress bar at zero. I have tried safe mode, last good configuration and booting from floppy disc set (the 2000 CD appears to be non bootable). All freeze at 'starting windows 2000'. So I swapped the hard disc for one from an old computer, with windows 98. This booted up, though there are some compatibility problems with the motherboard. I then attempted to upgrade this old disc from 98 to 2000. This appeared to be working, until it restarted and froze at the 'setup is starting windows 2000' point. This disc now gives the choice of starting either 98 or 2000, but only 98 actually boots up. So both hard discs stop a exactly the same point. I suspect a component failure on the motherboard, but cannot think why this would only affect the 2000 boot up. Any ideas? Thanks in advance, Richard
