i have an hp system and highly recommend them, but i would never buy a system with an integrated card because they suck, even though you dont play games regularly it would be best if you can get a computer that at least has the option of upgrading the seperate card!!!
but this is what i would do friend, only you can know what is best suited to the things you are going to use it for!!
