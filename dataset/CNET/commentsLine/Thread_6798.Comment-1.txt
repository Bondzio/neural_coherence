hi, i just recently purchased two western digital 10k rpm 74 gig raptor drives and set them up on my asus sk8v mobo... they show up in the via raid tool and i configured them for riad 0 which the &quot;via raid tool&quot; acknowledges... however i cannot access their storage.
i'm used to going to &quot;my computer&quot; and double clicking on a regular ide drive and being able to access its storage, however these drives are not located in the &quot;my computer&quot; area.
also when i restart my computer i get the &quot;promise fast track 378&quot; message that says &quot;no controller detected by fast track, the bios is not installed.&quot; or something very similar, my memory isn't the greatest right now.
so basically i'd like to know what you think i may have to do in order to access the 148 gigs of memory i have in these two drives.
because right now they're just hanging out in my rig doing nothing.
any help is appreciated... thanks for your time
