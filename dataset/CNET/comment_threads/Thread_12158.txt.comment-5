Thanks!
But money's not the problem.
I just want it to be portable and a snap to set up.
I once got such a thing for the Wii Nintendo system.
It's as small as a USB flash drive, you simply plug it into a computer that has a wired connection and it will broadcast that connection to become an access point.
But it only works for nintendo products.
