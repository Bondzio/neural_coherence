here's one for $750 with dual core cpu that meets your specs: http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/HP-Pavilion-17-Widescreen-Notebook-PC-DV-9410-US/sem/rpsm/oid/184835/catOid/-12963/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do it's pretty hard to build your own cheaper than the $400 specials.
the windows OS is $100 so $300 barely covers the hardware.
http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Acer-Aspire-Desktop-PC-AST180-UD400A/sem/rpsm/oid/184840/catOid/-12962/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do if you're going to build your own, definitely go to newegg.com, zipzoomfly.com, tigerdirect.com, etc.
i buy from ebay frequently but no ebay seller can beat the prices of the websites i mentioned for the same new hardware.
