At mobos you can select mfr'd CPU, et al and then search for those that fit your criteria. I'm a gigabyte fan [they usually cost more]. One thing to check for re the RAID controller. Find out if the RAID ports can only be used for RAID or can they be used for ATA and also ATAPI drives. Some only support RAID, some RAID, and ATA, and others all three. The ITE [gigaRAID] supports all 3. May have to go to tomshardware and or anandtech to read the articles that they have on mobos.
