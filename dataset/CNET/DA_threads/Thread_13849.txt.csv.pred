1.1.1	I 'm planning on building a gaming PC within the next two weeks .	St
1.1.2	I do n't want to spend too much money ( $ 1000 limit ) .	St
1.1.3	I configured one on newegg with Socket 939 and it came to about $ 900 .	St
1.1.4	I configured another with Socket AM2 for about $ 1000 .	St
1.1.5	Is it worth $ 100 more to go with AM2 ?	Ques
1.1.6	I heard it 's only 1 % faster .	St
1.2.1	actually , the socket 939 configuration came to $ 950	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	New technology always costs more especially after release .	St
1.4.2	Besides the AM2 is going to be the future of cpus from AMD , so really get it if you can .	St
1.4.3	HOWEVER , if you wait just a little longer the & quot ; older & quot ; stuff will come down in cost for sure , maybe in 30days or so .	St
1.4.4	You should already see some lessing of pricing of older cpus , etc.. tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	The only advantage with AM2 at the moment is the support of ddr2 ram ( which is also more expensive )	St
