1.1.1	I have a 20.1&quot; DELL monitor that I use with my notebook in my office when I'm not traveling.	St
1.1.2	My setup used to be that the monitor on my notebook had a different resolution (1024 x 768) than the external Dell monitor (1680 x 1050).	St
1.1.3	Something happened and now I don't have that 1680 x 1050 resolution as an option, and the external monitor and laptop monitor are now set the same.	St
1.1.4	I redownloaded the drivers from the Dell CD that came with the monitor, but I still can't set the resolution correctly.	St
1.1.5	HELP!	St
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	I use dual monitors as well, but as a clone.	St
1.2.2	How does yours work?	St
1.2.3	Right click the desktop and click properties.	St
1.2.4	Go over to the settings tab, and click your monitor, the 20 inch.	St
1.2.5	Try changing then.	St
1.2.6	I know you somehow turn off the Laptops monitor, I have a Dell Laptop and you press Ctrl Alt F3 to switch the onboard monitor on and off.	St
1.2.7	~Ibrahim~	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your post.	St
1.3.2	When I go to the settings tab, the Dell isn't even an option.	St
1.3.3	When I go into advanced, it is there but it doesn't seem to register anywhere else?	St
