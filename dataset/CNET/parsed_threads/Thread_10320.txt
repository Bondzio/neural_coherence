<s> My husband's cousin came over and messed with our Netgear wireless router's settings, and to make a long story short, now our Dell laptop cannot connect to the wireless network. </s>
<s> He doesn't remember what he did, so now we are stuck. </s>
<s> Before we call Netgear and pay per minute for service, is there anything we can try? </s>
<s> The wireless network shows up when you view the Network Connections, but we are unable to successfully connect to it. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>

<s> log into the Netgear router and use the settings like the Forum Sticky suggests. </s>
<s> Make sure NOT to use Mac Address filtering with those settings. </s>
