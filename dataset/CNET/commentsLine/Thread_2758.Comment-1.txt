this is a dell dimension 8200 with 256 ram.
it has a 30gb drive that was pre-installed, a maxtor 120gb drive that i installed, a liteon dvdrom ltd163, and a hl-dt-st cd-rw gce-8400b cd drive.
i turned off the computer, took out the 120 gb drive, restarted the computer, used it a few times, and noticed that the cd drives were not working: they showed up in device manager as having damaged configurations in the registry.
i tried uninstalling the drivers, but that didn't work.
what should i do?
