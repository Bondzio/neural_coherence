I have a motherboard that has 4 sata ports and 3 IDE ports for a total of 10 drives.
In order to power 10 drives I would want another power supply and a HUGE case.
I am thinking that making my own case would be the best option.
Any ideas on what I would need?
I need a material that is easy to work with and easy to assemble, as well as cheap and sturdy.
I was thinking of wood sanded with 2000 grit, wet clothed down to remove dust.
However the grounding properties of wood are non existant, this doesnt seem to be too much of an issue since I have seen cases of Lucite wich is also non cunductive.
I am confident wood isnt very 'static chargy' but want to make sure.
BTW, the dimensions of the case interior needs to be at least 40cm wide X 75cm tall X 50cm deep
