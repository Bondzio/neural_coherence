your info regatrding voltage levels around the world???
Simply do a google search for &quot;country voltages&quot; and you may find that your info is incorrect.
Also regarding the difference between 50 HZ and 60 HZ, while for devices with iron/ferrite cores the transformer losses vary somewhat, there are very few things for which it makes a failure condition.
Yes I know that many years ago when California went from 50 HZ to 60 HZ, they saved enough in power meter losses to pay for the conversion.
