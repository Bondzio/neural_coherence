I think the only issue might be some longer cable may be need (you will get that solution when you get to that point). I like Antec stuffs..Good building.

Picking out a computer case for a new build (or as an addition) is strictly a personal choice; however, with new technology comes more problems in regards to heat management, and making sure there is ample room for the newer video cards, etc. The Antec 1200 is a nice case (20.2 x 8.4 x 22.9 inches); the Corsair Obsidian 800D is only $40 more than the 1200 (24.0 x 9.0 x 24.0 inches), offering more room, better airflow, better cable management http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811139001
