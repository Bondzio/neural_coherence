i have a 500 gig seagate external hard drive which i use to back up pictures of my son and friends and whatnot from my recently purchased dell laptop with windows vista.
i also back up on disc.
i took the external drive to a friends and hooked it up to his mac.
it worked fine for a while as i put a few of his music files on it, then i walked away from it for about an hour and came back to find it showing the disc space as being full but not having any files.
then the panic sets in.
so i got a new external and have spent days taking pics off discs and transfering to the new one, but i have many discs that are old and don't read and now realize that i have lost a good chunk of my sons childhood pictures, and many of my friends', despite my best efforts to back everything up twice.
so does anyone know if the seagate being hooked up to a mac could have done some random reformatting or if it sounds like a virus from the music files?
should i try scanning it or send it to data doctors to pay a bunch and probably not get anything back?
i don't know!
any help would be appreciate greatly!
