I connected it to my Asus M3A motherboard and when I turned it on, sparks came out of that motherboard. The motherboard is wasted, and I was told that something with CPU voltages went wrong, I don't really understand, but anyhow, I need to get a new motherboard. I want it to either be compatible with the 550W PSU and my Athlon 64 X2 dual core 6400+ (because somehow, that's where it went wrong). OR If you say it's silly to buy a new motherboard and not a new CPU, which ones should I buy, that are compatible with eachother, my PSU, my memory (I really don't have a clue what type or RAM it is, I could check if you want). I really need some help with this, I want to avoid another &quot;fireworks party&quot;, and need my PC up and running again soon.

Second will be the drives. Sparks that you gotten would probably be and unwanted plugging in of a line to the plug which is actually not meant for power (but rather a peripheral). Any new board will have a manual to guide you on which plug really needs to be plugged, especially, ensuring the main 16/20 pin is completely plugged.

I can't buy the same motherboard as I had, because that would probably give the same weird problem, and fireworks.
