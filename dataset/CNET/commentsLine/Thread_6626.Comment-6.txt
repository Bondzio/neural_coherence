i have found that it depends upon which directory you send the info to.
i keep all my data in my documents and just copy the whole file to my external hard drive.
when i copy new data to the file it tells me thier is already a file with this name etc.
if i just paste the whole file it asks should i copy the old date just copying the whole file will update the file in your back up .
