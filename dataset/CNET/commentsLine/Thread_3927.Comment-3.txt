if so i would like to ask you a few questions.
you see i have an oppurtunity where i'm looking to purchase a macbook.
i have been a windows person my enitre life, and i'm about as close as you can get to being certified by microsoft without actually being certified.
however for the past few years apple and it's products have really impressed me, and i am very curious to see what their products are all about.
i would never give up windows this is for sure.
but i would like to explore mac, however i am a little concerned about making the change, even though it is only from a laptop standpoint.
if you do have a mac pc, first off do you like the pc?
is it better or equal to windows?
does it have all the finctionality that windows offer?
is it a quality laptop for an it person like myself?
again i know these are questions i can research however i would like to get an opinion from an actual user, not to mention when researching you get locked into the battle between windows and mac.
thanks
