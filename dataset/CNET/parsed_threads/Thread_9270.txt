<s> Helo, Can any one of you suggest me some free software which can burn the commercial DVD's !!!. </s>
<s> I bought a MadDog CD -R/Rw drive. </s>
<s> How do you rate this product !!! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You need to DEFINE what a &quot;commercial DVD&quot; is. </s>
<s> I'm guessing you mean the SILVER CDs or DVDs that you buy with music or video content. </s>
<s> If so, then you may want to know that such are not &quot;burned&quot; but are &quot;pressed&quot;. </s>
<s> Does that help? </s>
<s> As to the Mad Dog. </s>
<s> It's a value unit that should last a year or two but isn't very expensive. </s>

<s> Thanks a lot for the quick reply. </s>
<s> I want to copy the movie DVD's which are in a different language and my wedding DVD's which I want to copy. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I use DVDSHRINK to copy DVDs since it makes it so easy. </s>
<s> Given the nature of the program, I will only note you find it with google.com and will not write any more about it. </s>

<s> Hi Proffitt, Thanks a lot for your reply. </s>
<s> I will install and try this. </s>
