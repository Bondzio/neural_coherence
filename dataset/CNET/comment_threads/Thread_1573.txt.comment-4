Sorry but with the misspellings and typographic errors I can barely guess what the questions are.
Tablets do not substitute for a camera or camcorder.
But keep in mind that any &quot;app&quot; can be replaced so if the supplied app does not do &quot;steel capture&quot; why would we not look for a replacement for better captures of steel images?
As of my posting there are 10 more hours on that sale and they were not sold out.
