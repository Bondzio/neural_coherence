<s> Hey, I recently picked up some new RAM. </s>
<s> I started off with 1GB of Corsair PC3200 (1 stick). </s>
<s> Initially, I bought 2 sticks of 512 MB Kingston PC3200. </s>
<s> When I installed this with the corsair stick, my PC wouldn't boot. </s>
<s> I checked the motherboard's manual, and it turns out that it will not boot any configuration of 3 sticks. </s>
<s> Fine, so I go buy another 1 GB stick of Corsair to match my first stick. </s>
<s> Now, with all 4 sticks in, totally 3 GB, the system boots, but BIOS only recognizes 2GB. </s>
<s> I know the Kingston works, I was using it without the Corsair while I was waiting for the second Corsair to come. </s>
<s> Obviously, the Corsair works too. </s>
<s> So why does the Kingston stop working alongside the Corsair? </s>
<s> I know its iffy to mix ram, but these sticks are exactly the same type and speed, all PC 3200. </s>
<s> It looks to me like the chips are laid out the same way too. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? </s>
<s> I am using Vista 64-bit edition now too, so it shouldn't be an addressability issue right? </s>
<s> Even if it was, the motherboard should still be able to recognize all 3 GB. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> I read your post three times and couldn't find the make, model, version and the BIOS version of the machine or motherboard. </s>
<s> Put it in bold so it stands out for me. </s>
<s> It's a Gigabyte K8NF-9 Ultra motherboard. </s>
<s> Can I determine the BIOS version from windows, or will I need to restart to find it? </s>
<s> I found my BIOS version in the registry. </s>
<s> Key: SystemBiosVersion Value: Nvidia - 42302e31 Award Modular BIOS v6.00PG </s>
<s> Version F11 is the last issued in 2006 at http://tw.giga-byte.com/Products/Motherboard/Products_Overview.aspx?ProductID=1860 http://tw.giga-byte.com/Support/Motherboard/FAQ_Model.aspx?FAQID=2415 notes issues with more than 2 sticks of RAM. </s>
<s> It's not a good board to go with more than 2 sticks and I'm finding people are having issues. </s>
<s> Seems you need to check with your ram supplier directly to see how to get the ram exchanged for sticks for your board. </s>
<s> The speed reduction issue is not the problem I'm encountering though. </s>
<s> I'm aware of that issue, and it is a CPU limitation anyway. </s>
<s> Is that the only issue you found related to using 4 sticks? </s>
<s> The BIOS version is interesting. </s>
<s> Mine is F2, so it's definitely out of date. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I'm having problems updating it. </s>
<s> @BIOS is giving write errrors every time when trying to update the flash memory with the new bios version. </s>
<s> I tried V11 and V3, neither worked. </s>
<s> Not sure how to proceed from here. </s>
<s> Sorry, what I found was not fun and more than the links I gave. </s>
<s> I decline to write long passages with links backing up every assertion. </s>
<s> For that you usually have to get to a support forum (usually pay) and not a discussion forum. </s>
<s> -&gt; F2 BIOS could be a problem. </s>
<s> That's very old so check the board for flash bios write protect jumpers next time and you may get lucky. </s>
<s> Part of those bios updates are to correct memory controller settings and more. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
