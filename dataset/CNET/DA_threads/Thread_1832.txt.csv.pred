1.1.1	I'm looking at getting a Core i7 920 and I wondering if anybody has already purchased one and if they could tell how well the stock heatsink/fan work.	St
1.1.2	I've heard that they are terrible, so I am just wondering.	St
1.2.1	Have been the best over the years.	St
1.2.2	I think I've replaced a few Intel fans where as all the others are a daily replacement in the shop.	St

1.3.1	Typical supplied OEM fans tend to work well as they don't want the warranty to kick-in within normal use.	St
1.3.2	If you plan to &quot;overclock&quot; then consider a higher rated or suitable replaceable fan that's rated for such use.	St
1.3.3	In most cases, just trust the supplied fan that came with the cpu.	St
1.3.4	tada -----Willy	St
