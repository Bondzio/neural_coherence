Does anyone here have any clue as to its release date? I heard it had a parallel release with the Conroe line (released to manufacturers Thurs July 27th). The retail release for the Conroe E6600 and above is August 7th, I believe. But I have yet to see a definitive release date on the nForce 590 Intel board.

I am hoping to build MAximum PC's Dream Machine 2006 and will need an nForce 590 SLI Intel Edition motherboard that can accommodate the Intel Core 2 Extreme X6800 CPU. If I hear anything I will try to post.
