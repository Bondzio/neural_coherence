<s> Which is better? </s>
<s> A PC with a fast Processor but small RAM capacity? </s>
<s> or A PC with a large RAM capacity but slow Processor? </s>
<s> I know Its better to have both Processor and RAM maximized but I'm just curios with the answer... </s>
<s> This really depends on a lot of little things, but the main one is the Size of the program. </s>
<s> For example, with Windows XP A Faster Processor and Small Ram is Okay because Windows XP can run on &quot;smaller&quot; ram. </s>
<s> But with Vista I would get More RAM then a Faster Processor. </s>
<s> The same would hold true for other applications. </s>
<s> A Virus Scanning program would probably work better with a Faster processor. </s>
<s> But a Video game probably would work better with more RAM. </s>
<s> In the end More RAM is the better way to go because more is stored in Ram which can be retrieved faster by the CPU. </s>
<s> 1) How are you determining better? </s>
<s> Is it frames per second in a game or some other metric? </s>
<s> 2) How extreme a set are you doing here? </s>
<s> IOW, what is small and slow compared to fast and large? </s>
<s> Actually it isn't necessarily better to have both maximized unless one plans on substantially overpaying for things as in some cases a machine may not utilize all that power in the case of RAM and in the case of the processor you would likely be paying big bucks on something that will be cheaper soon if you look at historical CPU prices. </s>
<s> There are mid-range values that are likely good assuming the interval of values is reasonable, e.g. </s>
<s> for RAM capacity large is 4GB or so on a 32 bit system while small is 512MB these days. </s>

<s> I have a 1.66gHz Processor running in a 384 PC333 RAM. </s>
<s> I often use it for video and photo editing. </s>
<s> It also has a norton 2003 antivirus installed in it. </s>
<s> Sometimes programs take too long to start and sometimes it crashes. </s>
<s> Would I need a greater RAM? </s>
<s> or A faster processor? </s>
<s> A quad-core CPU on a motherboard with a faster FSB would be my suggestion to speed things up. </s>
<s> I think in the video editing, upgrading the processor is a good idea though I'd likely think that a quad core processor would be better than simply trying to get the fastest for the socket that you are running. </s>
<s> As for the photo editing, my guess would be this is where the bus and amount of RAM are factors in things so more RAM will help here but a faster bus may also be a big help I'd think. </s>
