I just bought an HP f1905b (along with their HP Media Center bundle) and this is a great display.
The fonts and images are very crisp and the colors are vibrant.
It is by far one of the best image quality I have seen on the market so far.
Great buy for those who are looking for a 19 inch display.
I recommend it.
