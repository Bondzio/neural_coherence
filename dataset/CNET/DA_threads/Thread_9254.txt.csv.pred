1.1.1	I just recently got an ACER Aspire E380, and I noticed that the sytem makes a clicking noise almost as loud as an old type-writer.	St
1.1.2	I was wondering if anyone knew whether this is a system flaw or does there happen to be a setting to turn it off.	St
1.1.3	I'm more of a power user, but never encountered this type of issue before.	St
1.1.4	Any and all help would be awesome.	St
1.1.5	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	A wire or cable has slid over and the fan was hitting it.	St
1.2.2	It was a snap to correct.	St
1.2.3	Have you opened it up to find it?	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
