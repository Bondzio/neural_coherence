hi to everybody, just got my pc parts from newegg, but encountered a problem with this mobo; in the users guide that came with it, chapter2:hardware setup 1.jumper setting: set the cpu external clock, frequency ratio and the cpu voltage according to the instruction printed on the manual or silkscreen printed on the mainboard.
now, i read all the guide carefully but didnt find anything mentioning where and how to setup jumpers for any cpu.
does that mean that the mobo is jumperless?
(on the mobo i found only 4 jumpers(jp1(cmos clear), jp2(cpu fan),jp3&jp4(both 3 and 4 are power on by usb) i m just afraid im missing something here.
thanks
