yeah thanks for that mr proffitt; i can't help noticing that on most of your replies to peoples questions (including mine) you treat them as imbeciles when all they are doing is asking for a little help.
maybe it's time for you to hang up your keyboard and do something less stressful as your highly paid/high pressure job seems to be taking its toll, hahaha!
&quot;i've shared what i would do and you have to decide...i leave you to figure it out.&quot; cheers
