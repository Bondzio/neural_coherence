1.1.1	Hi , I own a Toshiba Satellite 1135 - S125 Laptop and there are three USB ports on the computer .	St
1.1.2	2 are located on the back and 1 is located on the right side .	St
1.1.3	I have been having difficulties with plugging hardware into them and my computer not acknowledging them .	St
1.1.4	I 'm not the smartest when it comes to how to fix computers but my computer crashed a while back and my younger brother fixed it the best he could for me .	St
1.1.5	It runs and I can open all of my programs and what not but the USB ports tend to not work .	St
1.1.6	I can plug my mouse into any of the ports and restart my computer and it will work fine , but if I unplug it and plug it back in , it does n't work again until I restart my computer .	St
1.1.7	My mouse is n't my problem though , it 's my Flash drive .	St
1.1.8	I have a Lexar 256MB Flash drive and no matter what I do , my computer does not acknowledge that I have plugged in my Flash drive .	St
1.1.9	The same thing happens when I plug in my MP3 player also .	St
1.1.10	None of the LED lights flash or come on and my MP3 library says that my & quot ; Creative player is not detected & quot ; .	St
1.1.11	I just bought my MP3 player yesterday and this was when I realized this problem .	St
1.1.12	Is there any way I can fix my USB ports so that I can plug and unplug any of my USB hardware and it will acknowledge it ?	Ques
1.1.13	Please let me know what I have to do to fix this .	Sug
1.1.14	Thank you , B. Hoffman	St
1.2.1	Someone installed XP improperly or it took some heavy damage .	St
1.2.2	It 's time to find those restore CDs and reload the machine .	St
1.2.3	For most of us we never lose anything since we keep backups of what we ca n't lose .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks , I 'll go talk to my brother about the CD 's because I bought it from his old boss a while back and like I said earlier , I 'm not to Tech savvy when it comes to computers .	St
1.3.2	I 'm sure the guy I bought it from will have the CD 's somewhere .	St
1.3.3	If not I 'll get him to maybe try reinstalling XP on ym computer .	St
1.3.4	Thanks again , B. Hoffman	St
1.4.1	Reload the USB drivers either from the makers CD and/or try their support website .	St
1.4.2	Laptop USB ports can fail and/or proceed to have issues as power is an int .	St
1.4.3	cause of such or flaky contacts .	St
1.4.4	Also , be sure the USB ports are & quot ; enabled & quot ; under bios .	St
1.4.5	If you have a lot of ESD ( static ) this can cause problems and/or blow-out the USB ports .	St
1.4.6	Finally , that same cause can render USB devices as well to fail .	St
1.4.7	Test elsewhere any such questionable devices .	St
1.4.8	If push comes to shove , then reload the OS and start over from scratch , just have the restore/recovery CDs or know what the vendor has provided in such cases , like a hidden HD partition .	St
1.4.9	Of course back-up any data before doing that last resort step .	St
1.4.10	if after this and USB ports still remain & quot ; iffy & quot ; you have a true h/w fault , laptop repair ? ? ?	Ques
1.4.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
