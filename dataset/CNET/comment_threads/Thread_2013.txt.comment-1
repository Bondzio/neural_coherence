Hi - I just got a Seagate FreeAgent Go 120 GB External Hard Drive.
Even after plugging in both (yes both) USB cables into my Mac Mini, the disk will spin and the light turn on, but it does not appear on my desktop.
I have found out that I need to format the hard drive using disk utility, but the drive does not appear on the desktop or on disk utility.
Here are my specs (as many as I can think of - I've only had a Mac a week now): Mac Mini Intel Core 2 Duo 1.83 GHz OSX.4.10 80 GB Internal HD 120 GB Seagate External Free Agent Go HD Any ideas?
