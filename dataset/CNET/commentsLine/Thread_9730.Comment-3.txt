ask yourself this....what do i/others need and want to do with this computer then choose components to meet these needs/wants.
how about future needs and wants?
both of these sites allow you to customize for your needs and wants.
both sell pretty good computers.
i like hp myself but i would buy a dell.
dell:  hp:  you might also want to see some reviews:  i'd suggest a desktop....avoiding mini towers, mid towers, and laptops.
when it comes to computing it's all about speed and power.
these other systems lack speed and power in differing ways.
only choose a laptop if you need portability.
you want a work horse not a center piece.
when you get your choices narrowed down to two or three i'd check out the motherboard on them.
this component will determine how much you can upgrade the system in the future.
hope this helps.
good luck.
