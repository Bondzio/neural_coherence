The system never gets to the point of the beep codes. I have to kill the power to the machine and then restart the system. Sometimes it will start then but often I have to redo this up to 5 times. If I restart the system after it has been running, it starts up just fine. I don't mind going through these steps but my real worry is, the time is coming that it isn't going to start at all. This has been going on for about a year, I would say I'm a pretty patient person. I would appreciate any thoughts on this issue.

I searched for Capacitors and this seems to be a common problem particularly with Socket A mother boards. I now have a project because I would guess that I am really on borrowed time with this. Thanks again.
