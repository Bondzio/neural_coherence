<s> Hello I have 2 monitors connected to my ATI Radeon 9500 graphics card. </s>
<s> Monitor 2 is for media content, as it is at the other end of the room near my chair. </s>
<s> I would like to be able to watch CNET LIVE on it each Thursday, but when I drag the FireFox 3 window across to monitor two, and click the fullscreen button, it shows on Monitor One, even though the Firefox window was on montior two. </s>
<s> Does anybody know how to configure it to show fullscreen video on the second monitor? </s>
<s> I have looked in my Graphics Card software (its the most recent of the catalyst control center), and there not an option. </s>
<s> Please help me with this - it is causing me major problems having to sit up to the desk to stream CNET TV content. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22full+screen+on+second+monitor%22+WINDOWS+SOLVED&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&oq= The cause and reasons are in those discussions. </s>
<s> The solution varies with each machine. </s>
<s> Hello, After taking a look at those discussions, none of them match my problem. </s>
<s> I dont think my problem is actually a &quot;problem&quot; with the computer, just the fact that Flash does not know which screen to play the video on, it knows just to play it on the first screen. </s>
<s> Is there an option to set Flash 9 to put fullscreen video on 2nd monitor, or a hack to do that? </s>
<s> I have been experiementing with some different ones. </s>
<s> If I drag a YouTube firefox window over to monitor 2, and hit fullscreen, it quit happily fullscreens on monitor two, but if I drag a CNET TV window over to monitor two, and hit fullscreen it shows up on monitor one? </s>
<s> Can somebody help me please? </s>
<s> You shouldn't find an exact match in the searches. </s>
<s> This is not CNET TV support here and you can try the CNET TV forum at http://forums.cnet.com/5204-12547_102-0.html?forumID=135&tag=forum.fd I know the issue but no cure as it can be site specific. </s>
<s> The reasons are again well known but there is no do this cure. </s>
<s> This may upset some but this is how it is today. </s>
<s> Where do we find support? </s>
<s> Even if we were going to pay for it, this one may not be fixable unless CNET TV alters their code. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Do you know of a flash player that can take the CNET live stream, and put it on the second screen? </s>
<s> Kinda like an FLV streaming player, but I need to know the CNET live flv file for that. </s>
<s> I know the issue, why it happens but have no do this cure for everyone. </s>
<s> I know (as you should have found in the discussions) that reducing video acceleration to none can cure some sites. </s>
<s> But that is unacceptable to some users. </s>
<s> Remember this is not CNET TV tech support. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have posted the issue in CNET TV tech support, and i'll try your idea now </s>
<s> For other users' information, it does not work I will stop posting on this topic now, I have created a CNET TV forum post here: http://forums.cnet.com/5208-12547_102-0.html?forumID=135&threadID=306148&messageID=2842743 . </s>
<s> This is why I wrote I don't have a do this cure. </s>
<s> The site and what it does and the player it uses can thwart common cures. </s>
<s> CNET TV has been a source of player trouble for some time. </s>
<s> It's likely to be a NIH ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here ) syndrome as there are many that love to create new ways of doing the same old thing. </s>
<s> Good luck and I hope you find a cure. </s>
<s> Is it possible to swap which display is &quot;primary&quot;? </s>
<s> I can do that on desktops. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hey, I can do that, never really thought of it. </s>
<s> My ATI catalyst software will also create profiles for how I want it, which makes it super easy! </s>
<s> Thanks for your help, that will sure work </s>
