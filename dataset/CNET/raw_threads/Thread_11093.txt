I figure you're probably having issues with a missing (updated) video driver, so here is the link: http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx Just input click on 'motherboard', socket, model #, then click on what O/S you're using, this will take you to their 'download' page for everything (including BIOS, drivers, manuals, etc.)

Did you check to see if it's disabled. Drivers won't cause beeps as these are hardware failures. Do make sure you are correct about the beep codes. Bad RAM is another common cause of beeps.

But, if it just beeps immediately, you won't get that far. If you can enter the BIOS, you need to look for the the option regarding on board devices. I can't tell you exactly where they are. If it is the video chip, these have sometimes been known to have solder connections go bad. There isn't much you can do about that unless you can find the bad connections (need magnification) and are very good with your soldering skills. If it is the video chipset, you can just get an add in video card. Bad RAM or the CPU can cause beep codes but you'd need a listing of those for your BIOS to narrow down the probable causes. Good luck.

2806	7	389056	3281190	3281109	Steven Haninger	4/4/10 5:13 PM	1.27040118E12	If you're sure it's a video device error	than trying a video card appears to be your only option. Hopefully the store will take it back if this doesn't work out but even a lower end graphics display card will offer video improvements over what you've become accustomed to.

This beep code consists of a single long beep followed by two short beeps. Any other beeps are probably a RAM (Random Access Memory) problems. &quot; This quote comes directly from Phoenix Technologies-Post Beep Codes
