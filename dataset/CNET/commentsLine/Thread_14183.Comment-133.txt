in february 1988 my first pc arrived purchased through a frend who was a senior exec at a small company.
i received that company's corporate discount price...and a small virus that came in shrink-wrapped (obviously opened and re-shrink-wrapped) software.
the virus started affecting the performance of one program and then it spread throughout and affected other programs.
finally, it put up an anti-capitalist message when i tried to start up my financial software.
i had norton (or something like it) on this ast desktop (or was it another brand..i've had so many pcs and laptops).
the anti-viral techs worked with me by phone but nothing removed this virus.
i worked for a law firm at the time and i hired the firm's computer security consultant privately.
sitting side-by-side, going through code, we found where the virus code was.
it resisted all attempts to delete it as it seemed to protect itself.
the consultant called norton (or whomever) and we all worked together to no avail.
we were asked to copy this area of code and send it in to the anti-viral company's hq in silicon valley (i was in new orleans at the time).
we did send it in before we wiped my hard drive.
after that i had problems with the bios and some other hardware problems.
i had worked on mini-frames at a firm on wall street and loved computers.
but my experience at home with my first computer was a nightmare.
i finally gave up on it and bought another pc, different brand.
