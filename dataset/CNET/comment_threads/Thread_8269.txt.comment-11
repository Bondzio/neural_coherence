Well, I guess waiting has paid off.
I just read at cnet about the Samsung Galaxy that is coming out ?
and priced ?
I like the Flash capabilities, the camera and also the smaller size.
My e-reader is the same profile and it's super lightweight and easy-peasy to carry around.
I'll check out the other two manufacturers that you suggested, too.
