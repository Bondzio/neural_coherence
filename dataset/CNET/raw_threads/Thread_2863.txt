I installed them both, but my computer wouldn't start. After the BIOS screen windows never starts to load. My computer works fine with 3GB, but as soon as I install the final stick of ram... same thing every time, comp won't start. Any ideas? I'm using 32 bit vista.

As well, with the 3 GBs installed does the OS show all of it? MB and RAM specs might help get a better answer.

I am not sure of MB atm , just got the comp.

I also bought 4 pieces of Corsair 1Ghz FSB speed memory and it turned out a piece was bad. And of course, my computer is a 64 bit machine that was running XP/64 and even though 4Gig is there, the computer will only tell you that there's 3Gig on the My Computer/System Properties/General Tab

Until you go to 64-Vista it's going to be limited to 3 to 3.5 Gigs. http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/64bit.mspx does write the 64-bit is in the box but many OEM installs are... the 32 bit version due to driver issues.

When the physical RAM in the system exceeds 16 GB and the /3GB switch is used, the operating system will ignore the additional RAM until the /3GB switch is removed. This is because of the increased size of the kernel required to support more Page Table Entries. The assumption is made that the administrator would rather not lose the /3GB functionality silently and automatically; therefore, this requires the administrator to explicitly change this setting. The /3GB switch allocates 3 GB of virtual address space to an application that uses IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE in the process header. This switch allows applications to address 1 GB of additional virtual address space above 2 GB. The virtual address space of processes and applications is still limited to 2 GB, unless the /3GB switch is used in the Boot.ini file. The following example shows how to add the /3GB parameter in the Boot.ini file to enable application memory tuning:

I would blue screen constantly after anywhere from 5-30 minutes of playing Counter-Strike. I was able to get my computer to start ONCE with all four sticks of RAM, and you are correct, it was maxed out at 3.5 GB. After I restarted, my computer wouldn't start again so I removed a stick of RAM and it worked again. I updated my BIOS and im using the beta version of NVIDIA's forceware drivers now, which seem to work much better than the ones I was using. I haven't had a blue screen since I pulled out the crappy piece of ram and updated bios and video card drivers. I think it also might be because I have 2 sticks of nice Corsair ram, and the other 2 sticks are K-BYTE cheap ass ram..
