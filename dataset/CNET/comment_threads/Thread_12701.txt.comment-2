About a year ago I wrote about this name.
http://forums.cnet.com/7723-19686_102-550244/imito-am801-8-inch-android-2-3-pc-tablet-legit/ It is a no support tablet so try what you read about resetting it at http://www.magicmum.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=208&t=384593&start=144&sid=11a6a92b9cbcdaf22faa104b05e8742a&view=print Again, and I can't stress this enough.
This is a &quot;training tablet.&quot; That is, a model that folk get to figure out if they like tablets.
It's cheaper than most for many reasons such as no support.
Good luck, Bob
