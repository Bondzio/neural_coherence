1.2.1	Run TWEAKUI and see if any drive letters are hidden.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	TweakUI shows no drive is hidden.	St
1.3.2	Also if the drive is hidden by windows, then why did my old CD-Rom drive worked?	St
1.4.1	So far you've only noted EXPLORER is hiding it.	St
1.4.2	Try this.	St
1.4.3	If you think it's E:, put in a CD with data on it and open the command prompt....	St
1.4.4	Type DIR E: press enter and tell what happens.	St
1.4.5	Try D:, F: etc... Bob	St
1.5.1	Any softwares that access the drive with a letter won't see it.	St
1.5.2	DVD Shrink, etc.... Only Nero can.	St
1.5.3	Nero access the drive directly.	St
1.5.4	Any other ideas?	St
1.5.5	Thanks.	St
1.6.1	As it stands I can't tell if you tried the DOS commands.	St
1.6.2	Many will not do this since they are fearful of the command line.	St
1.6.3	As such, you get to take it to the repair shop.	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
