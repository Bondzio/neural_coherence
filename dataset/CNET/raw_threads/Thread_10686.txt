I have changed computers 2 in a week because the mother board has &quot;fried&quot; (acording to a tech)and have to do a complete reinstalation and keep it on, since turning it off will force a complete reisntalation. Icons will be erased from the desktop. ?????????? Am I the only one with this problem?
