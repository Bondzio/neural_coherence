3820	0	21346	230709	NR	yaotomkin	4/30/04 6:05 AM	1.0833051E12	No Video	I was using my HP Pavillion 7955 and all of a sudden the screen went black. I don't think it is a power supply problem because the fan is still running and the monitor was plugged into another computer and it is working fine. I think it is a problem with the video card. I had some work done on the computer recently and the technician said that the video failed on boot up and he needed to re-seat the video card. Does that mean that he pulled the video card out and then put it back in? Could this be the solution to the problem that I am experiencing? How do I prevent this from happening again in the future? Thanks.

I agree.	&quot;Does that mean that he pulled the video card out and then put it back in?&quot; While we can't tell, my guess is YES! &quot;Could this be the solution to the problem that I am experiencing?&quot; Yes. &quot;How do I prevent this from happening again in the future?&quot; The current design of your PC uses some connector, cards that slide into said connector and there's a design limitation or flaw there. To prevent it from happening, you would have to look over the area of the design and see if you can fix it without impacting cooling or other aspects of the design. Bob
