even the radeon hd 6670 at the near 100 buck mark is quite the upgrade here.
and it pulls about 124 total system watts as noted at  to see if you need a new power supply i'd use a p3 watt meter to see what your system draws now (that's about 20 bucks if you don't own one) then you can see if you can skip the psu upgrade.
