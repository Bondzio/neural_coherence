thanks for the articles, i skimmed and they were very interesting.
unfortunately, everything seems to have power.
i disconnected everything except the hd and it still is not seen by bios.
i even ran the dell diognstic cd and it ran tests on the hd and declared it fine!
and flashed bios.
it just does not detect the hd.
i've used different hds, too.
therefore i assume i have a faulty motherboard.
oh well, thanks for the help.
any other thoughts are welcome before i call dell and order the thing
