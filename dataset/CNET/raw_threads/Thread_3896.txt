6207	0	34184	394235	NR	Clueless76	8/23/04 3:24 PM	1.09327464E12	Need to know if I can upgrade	I was given an HP 9600 Pavilion desktop comp as a hand-me down. It currently runs Win98, but I would like to upgrade to WinXP if possible, since that is what I use on my main comp in another room. Can this be done without any major issues? I have never had to upgrade a comp before, so please address this issue in as simplistic terms as possible. Thank you.
