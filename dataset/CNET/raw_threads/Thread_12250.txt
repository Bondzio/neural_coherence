Of course if you're worried about other people seeing what's currently on it, you could always use something like DBAN. If you do use something like DBAN, you'll need to follow Kees' advice and put a partition on it, format it, and assign a drive letter to it. ` Good luck.

That might not be what he wants. That's why I asked what program he would be using. Formatting would be fine before using it as a backup. But he asked about wiping, which usually means more. Kees
