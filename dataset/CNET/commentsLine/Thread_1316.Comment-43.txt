my windows 98 is dual monitor between its own monitor and my tv.
it used to be connected to my stereo system, but i took all the music off of it so i could reboot it, so there really was no longer a point.
also, i do not yet have an hdtv and as far as i know thats the only way to get a good quality signal without screen distortion.
my vista which i got last november is connected to my stereo system right now.
i probably have no intentions of connecting it to my entertainment center, as its really uncomfortable when controlling your computer anywhere other from a desk, but this is just my personal preference.
