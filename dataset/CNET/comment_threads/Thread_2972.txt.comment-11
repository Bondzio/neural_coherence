Toni or Bob, Very nice program.
I have installed it on one machine and received the following info: Windows 98 Build 4.10.1998 Bios: Award 4.51 PG 07/17/98 Model: Pionex Processor: 267 Mhz Cyrix GXm 16 KB Cache Board: GXm-Cx5520 Bus Clock: 64 Mhz Is this enough?
Second machine processor heat sink fan is bad so need to replace before I run Belarc.
