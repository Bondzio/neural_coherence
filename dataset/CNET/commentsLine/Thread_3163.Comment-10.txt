installing a secondary partition on a 64 system with a 64 bit os already in place.
because of the difficulty the op would have had in this task, it would have been better had you all just said, it's probably not something you want to do or would probably be something you shouldn't consider because of...... instead ya'll are still throwing out solutions that won't work.
partition magic may work to help create the secondary partition, however, back to the op's desired outcome, they wanted to install a secondary os, which because xp64 is the end os, as the rule of thumb goes, the lower os needs to be installed first so that the boot sector can be created correctly.
