So, I do not know what the problem might be. I do want to use ftp from the internet to connect to the PC 192.168.1.150 What I know is that the FTP server is working locally if i do ftp 192.168.1.150 but it is not working when I use the router's static ip address. Any idea? Thanks

Let's dive in. 1, I see you list port 21 but what did you do for port 20? 2, Can you SET PASV I know some don't want to dive in and get technical but this technical. Sorry if this upsets you but all kinds of folk come here. If I make it too simple the advanced user flames about being treated like a newbie. If I use the terms I use with my office workers on a newbie they might feel slighted. Sorry if I don't get that right. Bob
