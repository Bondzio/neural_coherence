1.2.1	are excepted on the Exceptions tab of Windows Firewall of the unseen PC .	St
1.3.1	you mention : 'I have the workgroup name of my desktop same as that of the wireless ESSID name . '	St
1.3.2	... your workgroup name is supposed to be the same name with your laptop workgroup name .. not with your ESSID ( ? )	Ques
1.3.3	Although you might give your ESSID name identical to your workgroup name .	St
1.4.1	The laptops are laptops from my work so they are part of the company 's domains .	St
1.4.2	I can not change them to my desktop 's workgroup .	St
1.4.3	I tried conencting one of my laptops through wired connection and tried to ping to it through the other laptop which is connected through wireless and i am able to connect to either of them without anyproblem .	St
1.4.4	Both the laptops were in different domains but still they were able to conenct to each other .	St
1.4.5	I have file and printer sharing enabled on my desktop .	St
1.4.6	I dont have any antivirus software on my machine .	St
1.4.7	Can this problem be because of some virus attack or something .	St
1.4.8	Thanks Nirmala	St
1.5.1	& quot ; the company 's domains .	St
1.5.2	I can not change them to my desktop 's workgroup. & quot ; Then it will never work proper .	St
1.5.3	It 's not an attack , just a bad setup .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	do you think this is a possible solution .	St
1.6.2	http : //www.netswitcher.com/	St
1.7.1	While netswitcher is nice , if they ca n't change it now ( no admin access I bet ) then netswitcher wo n't work .	St
1.7.2	Bob	St
1.8.1	Change your desktop domain name to match with your work laptop .	St
1.9.1	The two laptops i have are on different domains .	St
1.9.2	One is my husbands work laptop which has his company 's domain and i have mine which has my company 's domain name .	St
1.9.3	But they are able to connect to each other and i am able to access all the shared folders on my husband 's laptop .	St
1.9.4	I tried renaming the workgroup of the desktop to one of the laptop 's domain names but with no success .	St
1.9.5	The net switcher that you suggested looks more suitable for wireless networks than for desktop PCs .	St
1.9.6	Correct me if i am wrong .	St
1.9.7	Please let me know if anyone needs more info to solve my problem .	Sug
1.9.8	Thanks Nirmala	St
