nearly 100% of the time i find a firewall in place.
it's working and the disable in zonealarm doesn't turn it off.
then you have ifc to contend with as well.
notes some other points.
best of luck, and i can network just fine with windows 98/me/2000/xp and linux, so it's not these oses that are the issue.
