<s> I was wondering if anyone could tell me how much of a performance gap there is between the T7200 (2GHz, 4MB L2 Cache, 667MHz FSB) and the T5600 (1.83GHz, 2MB L2 Cache, 667MHz FSB). </s>
<s> How noticable would the difference be in gaming and application performance? </s>
<s> I'm thinking of getting a Dell Inspiron 1505 and am debating whether or not to spend the extra cash ($75) to get the upgraded processor (I've already put all the other highest end components available on it). </s>
<s> ^its an E1505 </s>
<s> 10% clock boost and 3-4% boost for the added cache. </s>
<s> Do you think this boost in performance justifies an additional $75? </s>
<s> Will the increase be noticable in gaming? </s>
<s> but for gaming, the next higher video card will always give you a bigger performance boost. </s>
<s> so if $75 buys a better video card, then that's where you should spend your cash. </s>
<s> I would...but the E1505 only offers the ATI Mobility Radeon X1400 and the Nvidia GeForce Go 7300. </s>
<s> Although the Nvidia costs $30 more in the config, I've read and seen benchmark scores that support the ATI being the better GPU. </s>
<s> I've also since read educated opinions that suggest the 2GHz processor will have a very minimal effect on gaming, especially considering I can only put a middle of the road GPU in. </s>
