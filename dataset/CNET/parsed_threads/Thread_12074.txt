<s> I have a desktop and three laptops. </s>
<s> There is a router theat takes the internet signal and puts it out to the desktop then out to another router that has my printer and three laptops going through the second router. </s>
<s> I set up a network and all four of the computers are part of the same workgroup. </s>
<s> The three laptops can see and access the desktop but nothing can access any of the laptops. </s>
<s> I don't know how to solve this. </s>
<s> All consumer grade routers have 2 sides, LAN & WAN. </s>
<s> The LAN side is typically a 4 port switch with a virtual IP address that applies to all switch ports. </s>
<s> This interface also acts as a DHCP server. </s>
<s> The WAN side gets the Public IP address from the ISP using PPPoE or DHCP typically. </s>
<s> The WAN interface runs NAT (Network address translation). </s>
<s> It convrts your LAN addresses into the one public IP address and keeps track of the sessions. </s>
<s> NAT is what allows you to share the internet connection with multiple computers. </s>
<s> One side effect of NAT is security. </s>
<s> The NAT implemented in consumer routers is referred to as Many to one NAT. </s>
<s> Outbound from the LAN has no issues. </s>
<s> But incomming traffic can only return to the proper computer if an outbound session was already created. </s>
<s> If I try to connect to your network then my session will terminate on your router. </s>
<s> Your router has no idea where to forward the traffic. </s>
<s> You could direct FTP traffic to a specific machine or Telnet traffic but this is good for only one PC. </s>
<s> If you can turn off NAT you may get this to work. </s>
<s> or replace the router with a switch if you can. </s>
<s> SKrall </s>
<s> So my second router that is atatched to the three laptops is a router/switch. </s>
<s> you think that is I switched this with the one accepting the internet signal and directing to the desktop that it would solve my problem. </s>
<s> when using two routers to link multiple devices, would be to enable one as the DHCP server and disable DHCP on the other. </s>
<s> In this scenario the router connecting to the Internet is the DHCP server. </s>
<s> Many will trip over firewalls not set to allow LAN sharing. </s>
<s> When this happens, I will turn them off to verify sharing can happen and then reconfigure them. </s>
<s> You should have just got the one router and then an Access point for the laptops to connect through, or a combined wired/wireless router. </s>
<s> You only need one Ethernet connection on the back of the wireless router, then just add a hub/switch if you need more ethernet connections for more wired computers on your network. </s>
