I terminate the test after 15 minutes of no errors.
I still have to configure this machine for a friend.
I also used Burnin test in the OS to test RAM and CPU functions.
The Burnin Test finds issues with the RAM in the OS within 15 minutes.
The issue has now presumably become where the issue actually is.
The RAM or the Mobo?
We will find out soon enough, I have the New Ram coming and if that flunks, I will RMA the board.
