I have a Lacie d2 Quadra hard-drive that I've been using on a Mac computer for several years.
The Mac computer that the drive was connected to is pretty much dead (Held out for 8 years though!)
and I need to transfer the files from the hard drive to a PC computer.
I can plug the drive into a Mac and it just mounts on its own, but nothing happens when I plug it into a PC.
I read the manual and it says to format the drive as NTFS and it will appear in my Computer folder.
However, I am worried that formatting the drive will erase everything on it and I will loose all my data.
Does anyone have any experience with this?
I've formatting smaller things like flash drives etc and I know that always erases the data, so I'd rather be sure about this before I do something stupid and erase every song and media file I've ever owned... Any input would be great
