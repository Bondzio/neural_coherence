I'm new to the whole buying thing...
I used to have a buddy build them but he moved.
I'm planning on buying a desktop because I'm useless at the whole building thing and I REALLY want a pretty good gaming rig but don't want to spend a rediculous amount of money on it... no more than $3000-$5000... $3000 is better so i still have electricity to run it.
suggestions for companies, configurations, and/or specs are greatly appreciated.
**at least 3.0 GHz procesor and a good amount of HD space are ideal.
