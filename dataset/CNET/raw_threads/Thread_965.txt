Mostly what I would like are parallel, serial, PS2, and 6+ USB hubs, with power. I have heard there are items like this out there, just wondering if anybody could recommend a brand. Thanks!

I've yet to see one with more. It connects to an USB 2.0 port so I'm unsure if you would call it a docking device but it saves me a few connections. Bob

But basically, I wanted something with its own power to plug my computer in to the aforementioned ports, but with extra USB's so that I don't have to buy 2 different devices. Does that make sense?
