it just stops installing at the 51 percent mark.
task manager shows it as running.
and i can click the cancel button.
i tried clicking on the start bar and it didn't have anything pop up at me.
it just stops at the same picture each time.
with a trade market and text about trading in the game.
usually is the same bunch of files.
arialni.ttf i notice the cd drive will rev down.
and the led will stop blinking, almost as if the drive stopped reading information.
i know this hardware will run it because i installed aoe2 once before with vista.
i guess i could try installing it to my external hard drive.
but i don't think that would work.
i haven't tried the ram yet.
i figure i might as well.
darned if i know what it is.
