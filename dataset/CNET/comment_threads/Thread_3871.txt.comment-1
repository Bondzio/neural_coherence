Hi, I currently have a Fujitsu-Siemens Scaleo P, with a motherboard model GA-8I848PM.
I have 1 x 512 DDR RAM installed, and am looking to upgrade this.
I believe that the RAM i have installed at the moment is PCR 2700, although I can't be sure.
I need to know whether I should add another 512 RAM, another 1GB, or take the existing RAM out and replace it with 1GB.
I am not sure whether there will be a great difference between these 3 options, and was hoping someone would help me out with making a decision.
I know that my computer does not support duel-channel memory.
Another website suggested that I buy a stick of RAM PCR 2300, but I'm not sure whether this will be different to buying another PCR 2700 as I have no idea what that actually means.
Can anyone help out?
Thanks.
