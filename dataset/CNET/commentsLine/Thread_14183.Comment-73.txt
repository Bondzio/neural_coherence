i never experienced a computer with out a display except in the automobile.
it took a second when you said vax.
out of mass.
this company made many mini computers.
when i worked at the health department we pulled the old 911 emergency services computer out of the warehouse and setup a patient tracking system using mumps.
the storage was the old disk packs.
4 or 6 plates to a pack, with i believe about 250 megs of storage.
the environment was a raised floor room with its own environmental control.
