the mac address is a unique serial number assigned to every network adapter of any type by its manufacturer.
the ip address is the &quot;street address&quot; on the internet information highway that your connection must have in order for data packets to be delivered to the proper recipient under the rules of tcp/ip networking protocols.
mac address filtering is when the owner of a wireless access point sets up a list of the mac numbers of wireless adapters that will be authorized to use the services of that access point.
if the mac number of your wireless card is not on the list, that access point simply won't do any business with you.
assignment of an ip address is something which a dhcp server will do whenever a system enters a tcp/ip network.
your isp issues one to your cable modem when you turn it on.
your router will issue one to your computer when it boots.
but if the router is a secured wireless one, an unauthorized intruder will not be given an ip address and no data will be passed.
the intruder will get that &quot;no ip address assigned&quot; message in their wireless client manager dialog.
