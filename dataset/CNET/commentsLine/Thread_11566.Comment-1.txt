i have a lan with windows 2000 server and windows 2000 xp and windows 2000 professional workstations.
i am not able to browse the network from my network places to pick shared items.
suprisingly, i am able to ping all machines in the network, internet connection sharing is working perfectly and emails as well.
any help?
