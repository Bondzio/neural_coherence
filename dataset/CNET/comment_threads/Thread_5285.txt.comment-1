Which is better?
I have spoken with Dell and HP and they say the Intel has a dual core with 3.2 gig and AMD they say only goes up to 2.6.
They also say that AMD is still comparable in speed because the cache is built into the processor.
I am going to have a computer built and I am not sure which processors to go with.
I will be using my computer for gaming mostly.
