I truly agree with you Bob 100% cause I have a Emachine 633IDS with the bio's upgraded to a HP logo on boot & a Intel Celeron 1.1 Ghz cpu with 512 megs of ram (still want to see if it will accept over that 768 or 1 gig) & it's still going strong & it's an old system.
A friend gave me this machine & I rebuilt it back up & installed a 1394 IEEE pci card & a 10/100/1000 ghz ethernet card.
Those AMD boards are not as good as a Intel board.
My wife is using a Emachine W3080 3000+ AMD board & it's had some problem's but still going strong.
She's going to be real upset if that mobo ever goes out.
I guess i'll wait to see if he has another board availible & install it & if that doesn't work then I will purchase a new board with a fast Intel base setup.
Thank's for your comments.
David
