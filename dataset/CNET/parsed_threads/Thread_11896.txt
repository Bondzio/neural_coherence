<s> I am pulling my hair out with starting up my 1st build. </s>
<s> Here's the list: MS XP PRO OS CoolerMaster ATX Case W/80 AND 120 FANS Foxconn 754 MOTHER BD NFK8AB-RS AMD 754 3200 ANTHLON PROCESSOR OCZ 1024M D400 MEMORY 1 STICK POWER SUPPLY ATOP KY-600ATX 500 WATTS HD 300G MAXTOR MX 7200 16M ATA133 6L300RO +HD COOLER MONITOR ROSEWILL 19''LCD 8ms R910P ChainTech GEForce 6600 256MB PCI express LOGITECH KEYBOARD AND OPTICAL MOUSE MODEM LITEON SOHW-1693S DVD R/W Foxconn left out their driver CD and a 40 pin cable. </s>
<s> I had to download their drivers. </s>
<s> My problem at this point is that I loaded the NVIDIA driver from the included cd but it won't run due to a CODE 10 error. </s>
<s> I also loaded a driver from the NVIDIA website and it just killed the signal to my monitor when I booted it in. </s>
<s> My display comes up with the motherboard WINFAST screen and has lines in groups of 4 or 5 running vertically down the screen a couple of inches apart and very splotchy texture. </s>
<s> As soon as windows kicks in It smoothes out mostly. </s>
<s> The display is very unstable as it will occasionally leave red pixels in a path behind my mouse movements. </s>
<s> I have also had the display just slowly corrupt into garbage and lose signal. </s>
<s> Not being able to run the NVIDIA driver is killing me after 2 days of tinkering. </s>
<s> I wanna see a game run!!! </s>
<s> I am really suspicious of the motherboard. </s>
<s> Am I right in assuming that the WINFAST screen that first comes up is a signal coming straight from the motherboard? </s>
<s> I think I shoulda bought the ASUS or MSI. </s>
<s> If anyone has any ideas I'd greatly appreciate it. </s>
<s> Getting that motherboard is a bad idea. </s>
<s> Try downloading the nvidia drivers from the chaintech website? </s>
<s> Are you sure you downloaded the drivers for the motherboard right? </s>
<s> If the motherboard did not have the driver cd, return it. </s>
<s> It could be because you ordered the oem version that&#347; why. </s>
<s> when you should have gotten the retai. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> Actually it was retail. </s>
<s> It was my first build so I tried to use it knowing that I could download the drivers from their site. </s>
<s> I let New Egg know what I thought about Foxconn tho. </s>
<s> I'm leaning towards going with an ASUS board. </s>
<s> Thanks for the feedback. </s>
