i ended up putting everything i had to have on thumb drives.
out of curiosity i formatted the wd external hard drive and found the backup software on the hp web site and loaded it to the drive.
i can now run the tests and everything passes?
i put it back on my computer and everything seems to be fine, but for how long?
beings it's 3 years old i will watch it very close and when it fails again, i will pick up a new on.
thanks for that information vapcmd and willy.
