<s> I recently bought an Asus CM1730 Windows 7 desktop. </s>
<s> It came with an 'Installation Disk' -- the retailer created a set of 'Recovery Disks' for it. </s>
<s> What is the difference between them? </s>
<s> When would I use each of them? </s>
<s> Do either contain Windows? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> My guess would be the ASUS disk would be what is called a &quot;BOOT &quot; disk and what the store created were the OS disks. </s>
<s> You would use these for system failures and ONLY then. </s>
<s> The store disks (usually 2 or 3 DVD'S) would/should contain the total operating system and would restore the system back to &quot;as new&quot; . </s>
<s> The boot disk would be used IF the system failed to boot and would/could recover the system from within the system (OS). </s>
<s> ONLY use these IF you need to, store them in a safe location as a just in case. </s>
<s> Thank you - your reply clarified my quandary a lot. </s>
<s> Not to beleaguer it - but - wouldn't the OS disks include the boot in?? </s>
<s> If (and I hope I never do) need the boot disc -- wouldn't I need to follow it with the OS discs? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
