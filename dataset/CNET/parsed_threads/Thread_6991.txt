<s> I have an internal IDE Memorex DVD-RW 16 double layer drive that doesn't recognize DVD disks or CD disks. </s>
<s> I first noticed this the other day when I tried to install a new program. </s>
<s> Last time I used it (it has been several months)I didn't have a problem. </s>
<s> When disks are inserted the drive light flashes but when I try to check the drive contents in my computer it tells me to insert a disk. </s>
<s> I have tested the drive in &quot;safe mode&quot; - sames issues I have uninstalled the drive in Device Manager and allowed Windows XP to reinstall - same issues. </s>
<s> The drive is recognized in device manager and it is not flagged. </s>
<s> I can open the drive door from my computer. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas on how I can get the drive working again? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Here's the test I use. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I see if I can boot a CD from that drive. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If that fails I swap in a new DVDRW. </s>
<s> There has never been one case where we would repair the 20 dollar DVDRW drives. </s>
<s> It costs too much to repair them. </s>

<s> Again, thanks for the input! </s>

<s> Thanks and keep in mind that test. </s>
<s> It's my acid test for such drives because it removed any OS issues. </s>
<s> Those 20 buck drives last 2 or so years and found at Fry's, newegg.com, geeks.com, etc. </s>
