Any URLs that I can read up on? TIA, Sanjay.

Look at these current Intel motherboards to see typical names: http://www.intel.com/products/motherboard/index.htm?iid=HMPAGE+Header_2_Product_MB

P4D 945 3.4GHz 800MHz 2x2MB $163 (now $316) P4D 915 2.8GHz 800MHz 2x2MB $133 (now $169) P4D 820 2.8GHz 800MHz 2x1MB $113 (now $169) P4D 805 2.66GHz 533MHz 2x1MB $93 (now $115)

I got back to the vendor, who says it is original Intel D102 motherboard. Does that help? I would like to know the performance of this mbd, and whether there are any known bugs for which patches are available / not available. Thanks again, Sanjay.

My purchase decision gets postponed till end July / first week of August! Which motherboard will suit the PIV Duals best, btw? And, is there anything better than Transcend RAMs? How is the performance of these Transcend memories? Any inputs on these are highly appreciated. TIA, Sanjay.

The board is very small-- microATX size, so it is not very expandable. Look for a full ATX motherboard if you plan to make this a gaming, media center, or a computer for some use that might require many add-in cards (sound card, 56K modem, TV tuner, PhysX card, etc.).

It only 2 RAM slots, so I'd recommend filling them with 2GB. if you just want a good, inexpensive PC now, then get a motherboard based on the 945g chipset. here are 2 suggestions: biostar, $93: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=246442 asus, $115: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=247080

I guess I will go in for the 945 series motherboard that 'ramarc' has recommended in this thread. Thanks for your tips; much appreciated. Regards, Sanjay.
