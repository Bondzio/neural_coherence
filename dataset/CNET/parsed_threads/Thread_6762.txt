<s> Hello, this is my first post on this site so forgive me if I sound stupid but anyway; I have a fairly old pc that i have digged out because its actually more powerful than the cheap pc i am currently using (intergrated gpu). </s>
<s> It has an AGP slot and I have a gigabtye 6800 gt graphics card installed. </s>
<s> The problem is, its been so long since I've done any tinkering, I've become confused. </s>
<s> The card fits into the agp slot now problem. </s>
<s> But there is a 4-pin connector on board (the type for hard drives and disk drives, molex I think?). </s>
<s> When I opened the case, there was no connector plugged in. </s>
<s> Everytime I turn pc on it gives this continuous beeping sound like an alarm. </s>
<s> Is this because the graphics card needs the power connector plugged in? </s>
<s> I know it sounds silly but I don't want to plug in something wrongly and damage it. </s>
<s> When I take the card out, theres no beeping alarm sound. </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice and help anyone can give me. </s>
<s> of the card requires an additional power connection. </s>
<s> So find an additional lead from the power supply and plug it in. </s>
<s> Then try to turn the computer on again. </s>
<s> The beeping sound is called a beep code, so if it still does that, make a note of the sequence, if any, and then report back as to the make and model of this PC. </s>
<s> Or you can search for the beep code but you need to know the make and model of the motherboard to start. </s>
<s> Hello, thanks for the help. </s>
<s> At the moment it is just one continuous alarm beep type sound-have also read elsewhere that other people have experienced this and did what you said-hopefully will resolve the issue, i hope so because I don't really have the money to upgrade at the moment and i remember my system running games like far cry, half life 2, doom 3 and call of duty all very well, so gonna plug in the molex and pray for the best! </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
