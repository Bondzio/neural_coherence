re: &quot;what do you mean by configured higher?&quot; the hp a850e can be configered to a athlon 64 3700 whereas the compaq sr 1010z only goes as high as athlon 64 3300. note the chart here at amd:  yes, amd does not list the 3300, so it is a unlisted special built with a 512kb l2 cache, a different processor from the 3400, and apparently less expensive.
i would go for the athlon 64 3400 with 1mb of l2 cache with the hp a850e, as apparently that series stays away from the (*******..not amd recognized) 3300 model.
ps...also in comparison the hp would reduce cost even less if you got the monitor.
