they are new and it's time to call the maker to make good on the machines.
that's why some don't build their own machines... -&gt; if you are on the hook to fix it, dive into the event viewer for clues.
a recent fix found there was an audio driver that was from the supplied cd.
updated that and no more random boot.
makes you wonder why they pack a defective driver on the cd?
