this has happened twice already.
i managed to get the storage drive back when i did a system restore.
now it's down again and the computer doesn't detect the drive at all.
i was using my easy cd creator file to create a data disk when it shut down both times.
i think that file has been corrupted.
i can't even get the disk out of the drive now.
