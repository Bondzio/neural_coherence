1.1.1	Hello , I 've just bought a new DELL Dimension 8400 with CD-RW and DVD-RW drives .	St
1.1.2	I 'm having a problem with playing back audio on the CD-drive .	St
1.1.3	Data recording/playback works well on both drives .	St
1.1.4	Dell Tech support are not much use so I thought I 'd seek other opinions .	St
1.1.5	I 'm an PC amateur , but I think my PC is configured with a single IDE cable from the motherboard which goes to the CD ( middle connector ) and DVD ( end connector ) .	St
1.1.6	My CD sound is choppy in this configuration .	St
1.1.7	I tried swapping the cables round and found that the DVD sound was choppy .	St
1.1.8	So whichever device is connected to the 'middle ' cable connector gives poor sound .	St
1.1.9	It 's identified as '2 ' on the cable .	St
1.1.10	My simple brain told me that there 's probably a problem with the IDE cable - so I ordered a new one from DELL .	St
1.1.11	However , when I searched the net I found all sorts of confusing stuff about Slaves/Masters/Cable select - so I 'm starting to wonder if it is the cable or whether something is set up incorrectly with my system ( bear in mind it 's less than a month old - and you 'd have thought ( ! )	St
1.1.12	that DELL would have set it up correctly ) .	St
1.1.13	If anyone has any insights into this problem I 'd been very grateful - the DELL tech support guys seem little more qualified than me !	St
1.1.14	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Sounds as if you may have sniffed it out .	St
1.2.2	Try the new cable , then post back the results .	St
1.2.3	Best of Luck	St
1.3.1	hi , i hav the same problem as you , i have just bought a new dell computer , and the sound quality on the dvd drive is very poor .	St
1.3.2	if you find out what the problem is can you please tell me so i can fix it .	St
1.3.3	thanks , mike	Polite
1.4.1	This is not Dell 's repair center .	St
1.4.2	Do give it to them to fix it .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
