Choosing most of the specs have been very simple for me: Here's what I've lined up so far CPU: AMD64 Venice 3200+ Mobo: Gigabyte K8N Pro-SLI Mem: 1G Kingston DDR2 HDD: Maxtor 16M SATA 250G Drive1: Benq DW-1640 Gigabyte 16x DVD-RW Drive2: CD-RW/DVD Combo At the moment my system totals around $900+ Australian including setup My current dilemma is what Graphics card to put with it. I had initially settled for a 256mb Gigabyte 9550 for $80 or so dollars to put into AGP, but as I've read more and more into it I've found that AGP is being rendered Obsolete by PCI-E. My question is, is there any sense shelling out $200-300 for a PCI-E card with the same RAM as opposed to sticking with AGP? And with the aforementioned specs, are there any graphics cards that you could recommend that are within the low to medium budget range? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! If it helps I am interested in using the PC/Graphics card for gaming, 3D rendering on the side and also photoshop work.

If you don't want to spend alot on a video card go with a 6600 series card minimum, and check out the 6800GS too. Either of those would handle what you want to do fairly well.

I think you meant you have to determine whether to go with an ATI Radeon or an nVidia GeForce video card. The gamers will tell you to go with nVidia cards.

So you could get almost any of the nVidia based graphics cards from the 6600 LE and up, depending on how much money you want to spend.

Besides, nVidia currently has the best graphics card in the market, the 7800gtx. In my opinion get the nVidia 7800gt, which isn't as good as the 7800gtx, but is close and you save alot more $$$ going with the 7800gt. Also if you want, you can put the 7800gt in an SLI configuration later; to help with your photoshop, your 3-d gaming, etc.
