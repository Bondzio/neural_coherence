Hi Bob, Thanks for your reply.
Having that many clients access the drive to copy files off doesn't raise any speed issues but I can imagine it would if we were using it to share internet access.
It seems fair enough to limit the number of clients to 16 to 32, unfortunately our classes average 25 so the 20 limit is a little annoying!
A near miss.
I'll contact Apple directly and see if I can get to the bottom of the specs for the Time Capsule in question.
I'll post the results for anyone else who finds this thread.
Thanks again for your help and interest.
Caspar
