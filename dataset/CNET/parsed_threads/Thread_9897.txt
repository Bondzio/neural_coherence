<s> I have a Windows XP SP3 PC with the Generic BT 5.1.26 Radio Driver and the same version. </s>
<s> Windows BT enumerator I am having no trouble adding an Android device ( HTC Evo ) however, there is no connection held after the successful password matching....... Is there a newer driver that will help this connection error? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The Bluetooth dongle on the PC is a Cambridge Silicon Radio. </s>
<s> It does PAIR ok, but after the passphrase exchange is successful, the connection fails. </s>
<s> I am assuming this can be fixed with a driver update, which I have had no luck finding after a pretty exhaustive search. </s>
<s> But I found it cheap enough at 5 or so bucks to toss (actually I give the ones I don't like away) it and replace it with units that don't need more than the native Microsoft Bluetooth drivers and stack. </s>
<s> Since you have the packaging you stand a better chance of finding the maker's web site than most. </s>
