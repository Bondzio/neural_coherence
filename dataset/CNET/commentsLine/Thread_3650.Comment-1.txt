i have an epson rx500 that's just over a year old.
meaning, just out of warranty.
i've now got a hardware problem that appears to be related to the print head location/movement.
the error message simply reads &quot;printer error - see your documentation and call service if necessary&quot; very helpful, not!
since its out of warranty, i'm torn between paying to fix it, or just trashing it altogether.
the local best buy wants $50 just to look at it, plus parts and labor on top of that.
the repair cost could easily eclipse the cost of a new multifunction unit.
i just hate to have to throw out what was a decent, relatively new printer!
what would you do?
