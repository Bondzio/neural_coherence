10846	3	511100	5052429	5052435	R. Proffitt	12/24/10 3:17 PM	1.29320382E12	Sorry.	I would be guessing if this is just another PC power supply. I had hope you could tell more. I know, I know that some folk want to replace with the exact models but in your common PCs we have some standards. If you would share a bit more then I could see if a stock supply will do. There are some hundreds on newegg.com that would do but if you would tell more such as the dimensions and connections it would go a long way. Bob

Finding a similar one with be fairly easy as most vendors offer this at 500W unit. Just be sure the connections offered(basic) are what you need and added connections are provided as well though you may not need them, they cause no harm. Again, look for typical generic ATX-12V type PSU. USAe Robert's link for any specs and/or pictorial help. tada -----Willy

There must be some thousands of models that will work in it's place. -&gt; BUT let me add that BEFORE YOU REPLACE IT, inspect the motherboard for BAD CAPS as your parts are in the time frame of the BAD CAPS days. Google BAD CAPS for the pictures and stories. Finally, add 100 more Watts so we're sure there is more reserve and you won't be replacing it in a few months. Bob
