as i said, i use registry mechanic, and system mechanic pro vers 7, on a regular basis.
both are top notch programs to help straighten out a 'puter.
sys pro has a new feature that allows me to set the repair of several items to auto-repair, and it auto-repairs when the program starts.
i have installed some programs: roboform, ms office, pc study bible, spyware doctor.
files are organized in my docs, and machine is regularly cleaned.
the machine works in top shape.
i just want the option to install or not install all the junk that comes on computers nowdays.
i build'em, repair'em, sell'em, trade'em.
i maintain'em by cleaning'em.
i network'em, i upgrade'em.
and i love it, but i hate junk on a 'puter!
every buyer should be able to have a 'puter designed and setup after his/her own desires, w/o having to fight the crap.
mike dell is greedy, consumers know it and don't like it --- ergo his problems today with his company.
junk collectors want junk but 'puter lovers don't!
