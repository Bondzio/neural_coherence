<s> Another question for those in the know. </s>
<s> I presently have a new desktop PC which is connected to basic dial-up. </s>
<s> My father has now decided he wants a new computer. </s>
<s> My ISP is Bell South and Bell South tells me to have 2 PC's in the same house using basic dial-up for internet service would require 2 separate phone lines in the house; each phone line having it's own basic dial-up account. </s>
<s> Bell South did tell me another choice that I would have is to keep just one phone line and I could connect both computers to that one phone line and use Bell South's DSL high speed internet service. </s>
<s> Since there would be two computers on one phone line sharing the DSL Bell South recommended that I go with their mid level DSL service at $34.95 a month. </s>
<s> Now here's where things start to get confusing; Bell South says I'd benefit from joining their home networking plan for an additional $5.00 a month but if I did I'd also have to purchase a DSL modem; a router; and either a router adapter or a DSL adapter which would be connected to the second computer in the house. </s>
<s> My question is this. </s>
<s> Would it be more feasable for me to go with 2 separate phone lines having basic dial-up service on each phone line or to go as Bell South has recommended; stay with one phone line; go with their mid-level DSL plan which both computers could share after purchasing all of the required DSL equipment from Bell South to make everything work? </s>
<s> Which way should I consider going? </s>
<s> Feedback would certainly be appreciated on this one. </s>

<s> Twice the headaches in my book. </s>
<s> The common setup is DSL/Cable modem with the router and it's done millions of times all over. </s>
<s> No magic and documented for those that need it at dlink.com linksys.com and netgear.com Cost? </s>
<s> From 20 bucks and up for the wifi router. </s>

<s> You would be much better off with the DSL. </s>
<s> You can get a router which allows you to share that boradband you have with up to 4 pcs. </s>
<s> Say if the pc's are close, you can share the broadband via an ethernet cable hooked to your router. </s>
<s> There are no additional monthly fees when you do use a router. </s>
<s> You can get a wireless router which allows you to share the broadband to any computer in the house WIRELESSLY, this also allows laptops to connect wirlessly also. </s>
<s> Problem is with a wireless router, it has a range on how far it can go. </s>
<s> You can get a MIMO router for about $100.00. </s>
<s> In addition if you do get a wirless router, your computers will need a wireless adapter. </s>
<s> A wirless adapter can go for about $35-$40. </s>
<s> You should get the same make as the maker of your router. </s>
<s> The wirless adapter allows you to take the wirless signals coming from your router and allowing you to connect to the internet. </s>
<s> Wireless adapters can either be plugged via usb, or a cheaper alternative be installed into a desktop via pc slot. </s>
<s> If you do get a wirless router, get the belkin pre-n wirless router, I have seen it go for $100. </s>
<s> This router is extremelty powerful, and has a very long range, and incorporates tomorrows technology. </s>
<s> Remember your computers can be hooked up to a wireless router with an ethernet cord. </s>
<s> I have DSL with the modem hooked up to the first PC. </s>
<s> I have added a new PC (both are XPSP2) in an office in another building(same phone line). </s>
<s> I would like to connect to the Internet on the new PC and was told by ISP to use a router. </s>
<s> I bought a Linksys Etherfast Cable/DSL Routher with 4-Port Switch, but cannot get connected. </s>
<s> The phone line works, but as soon as I connect the phone cord from the filter that houses both phone and dsl, into the router, no phone and no connection. </s>
<s> When I manually set the IP address on the new PC it says connected but IE says not connected when I try different websites. </s>
<s> Any help would be so much appreciated! </s>
