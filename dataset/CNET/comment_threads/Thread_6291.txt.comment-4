Based on the Acer lcd I'm looking at.
If I disconnect the monitor from the pc and then power the monitor on I see the Acer logo.
If I use the OSD....on screen display buttons I can view and play with stuff.
If I did not get a logo and the OSD did not function I'd take a guess the monitor is &quot;borked&quot;.
