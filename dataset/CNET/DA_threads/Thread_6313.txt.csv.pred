1.1.1	ok - i would think this may be something that is solely about what a user wants ... ..but my question is this .	St
1.1.2	Currently i have a cdrw burner and a dvd burner installed on my desktop , is this set up better than saying having just a dvdcdr combo burner ?	Ques
1.1.3	in other words , which is best , one burner or two ?	Ques
1.2.1	I put in a pair of DVDRW drives .	St
1.2.2	The only reason for CDRW is if it 's leftovers or & quot ; free. & quot ; Bob	St
1.3.1	two drives come in handy .	St
1.3.2	i also like to have 2 drives so i can leave my current favorite game cd/dvd loaded and always ready to play .	Sug
1.3.3	cheap dvd burners are n't really that much more expensive than their read-only counterparts .	St
1.4.1	I have two DVD-RW 's and a CD-RW which covers most eventualities .	St
1.4.2	and I get to burn 2 disks at a time .	St
1.4.3	but I 'd definitely go for two seperate ones it makes burning a lot faster in some modes and if one gives up you still have the second till you get a replacement .	St
1.5.1	Definately two Dvd burners I use 2 and have done for a long time it is just easier to manage your burning jobs , I use Pioneer because i was told that they were the best by a technician at my local computer shop this is just a personnel choice now , i also like that getting updated drivers is easy from the pioneer site .	St
1.6.1	I have an internal DVD-RW burner plus an external same .	St
1.6.2	It 's always good practice to have a backup .	St
