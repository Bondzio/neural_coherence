I am going to be building a new PC sometime this summer, and am looking at the Q9450 with the hope of OC'ing to somewhere in the 3.3-3.5Ghz range, using a Noctua cooler.
Is this possible, and if so, how feasible (reasonable temps even on air cooling, stability, etc.
), and what accompanying RAM overclock is required?
Secondly, will DDR2-800 RAM be sufficient (assuming I will have to OC it to at least somewhat)?
(I saw DDR-800 here since I have seen a few discussions that seem to say that RAM with stock speeds above 800 are sometimes unstable.
Any input is appreciated.
If it matters, I will be using some flavor of Asus P5Q motherboard most likely.
