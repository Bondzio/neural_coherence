hopefully, this may help someone before its too late.
you're more than welcome to correct or add suggestions, but heck it works for me.
cooling tips now that summer(or anytime) is here and that added heat is certainly present, cooling is ever more important.
while, i can say for certain my system isn't in an a/c'ed room, it still does its job.
why, you ask, because i follow common sense and a little knowledge goes a long ways.
your situation maybe different but could use the information, i'm passing on, though repeated many times elsewhere.
1) clean the system case insides as best as possible 2) route wire harness and cables to better airflow(rounded cables?)
3) if possible mount hds apart from each other to reduce &quot;hot spot&quot; between them 4) use quality componets like bigger cpu fan/heatsink, extra case fan(s) 5) use your system away from direct sunlight or at least shield it 6) use system away from floor or place higher/elevate from floor blowholes, a handmade top of case hole to mount fan/or none to vent &quot;rising airflow&quot;.
most cases if dual fans, one in front(in) and one in back(out) for airflow, mount extra fans to follow that convention, unless otherwise directed.
replace power supply besides added wattage, using a dual fan setup itself.
seriously consider removing the old hd if less than 10gb, maybe 20gb as your new hd is 60-200gb now.
you're old hd did its job maybe for years and then you stuff a new hd on top or below it creates a hot spot, i practially guarantee the old hd will fail or cause the new one to become flaky within 3 months.
by all means if you can cool the room to a lower temperature that the air being sucked in into the case will benefit, also called &quot;ambinent&quot; temperature.
