<s> I just bought an HP f1905b (along with their HP Media Center bundle) and this is a great display. </s>
<s> The fonts and images are very crisp and the colors are vibrant. </s>
<s> It is by far one of the best image quality I have seen on the market so far. </s>
<s> Great buy for those who are looking for a 19 inch display. </s>
<s> I recommend it. </s>
<s> I recently bought an HP Media Center PC that comes bundled with the f2105 21&quot; LCD monitor. </s>
<s> It is fantastic. </s>
<s> In addition to being a PC monitor, it is also HDTV ready. </s>
<s> I got a Comcast HD cable box and hooked it up to the monitor. </s>
<s> FANTASTIC! </s>
<s> I think I spend more time watching HDTV then working on the PC. </s>
<s> The only problem I find with this monitor is that it doesn't have any vidio inputs (S-Video, Component Video) for connecting a DVD player or other components. </s>
<s> Otherwise, I highly recommend this monitor. </s>
<s> I have had the 1905 for 4 months.....wait til you play a game like Doom 3....wife loves the digital pics we take on it. </s>
<s> This is a great monitor, however, if you live in the States, you should be prepared to spend about $1500.00 to get one because you must buy it as part of a computer package. </s>
<s> I approached HP about buying one and was told that they could not help me. </s>
<s> It seems strange for them to be so unhelpful, but nobody (and I talked to at least 6 people) could tell me where to buy one of these. </s>
<s> It is available as a stand alone product in Canada www.futureshop.com. </s>
<s> I was just about to give up when I found one on eBay. </s>
<s> I love it and would by a couple more if they were available here. </s>
<s> In my area this monitor is available at almost every single one of my electronic retail stores (Best Buy, Circuit City, Office Depot, CompUSA, Microcenter). </s>
<s> The cheapest price ive seen it is $641.99 on amazon. </s>
<s> I dont know what you are talking about. </s>
<s> I got mine around 3 weeks ago at Circuit City for 380.00 after 50.00 rebate and they still have that price and yes the monitor great </s>
<s> Well, I bought 2x of these HP F1905b. </s>
<s> Overall, they are not bad of a monitors. </s>
<s> The first thing I noticed is that they are ultra-bright, meaning they hurt my eyes. </s>
<s> When you remov a bit of contrast and brightness the image becomes dull and lifeless. </s>
<s> The optimal settings seem to be the factory ones. </s>
<s> The second thing is that one of them came with a dead pixel! </s>
<s> The third, I think these panels are 6bits instead of being 8bits, so the color reproduction isn't that great. </s>
<s> You can see color interpolation being done to your images. </s>
<s> The fourth is that, it is not true that it has an anti-reflective surface, quite the opposite. </s>
<s> It is VERY reflective, to the point of being distracting. </s>
<s> Anywas, I personaly would give it a 7/10. </s>
<s> It is good if the only thing you do is office work. </s>
<s> Your first 2 'points' are flawed. </s>
<s> First off, all monitors are set to be super high brightness because they are in displays at stores that use lots of strong fluorescent lights. </s>
<s> So to make it stand out, they are factory set the highest brightness. </s>
<s> And turning any monitors brightness and contrast down makes the image look dull. </s>
<s> Thats the definition of a dull image: low contrast and brightness. </s>
<s> Second, the 1 dead pixel thing is expected. </s>
<s> If you have less than 3 dead pixels, its not worth ranting about. </s>
<s> Its not covered on either dells or HPs guarentee. </s>
<s> and, is EXPECTED. </s>
<s> I honestly expect to have 2 dead pixels when I buy an LCD, any more, and I would try to do something about it (especially if they are in a cluster) If they dont have any dead pixels, great, but thats the norm: 2 dead pix on a 19&quot; display. </s>
<s> As for your last two points... i dont know if its 6bit reporduction, but couldnt find anything to hint that. </s>
<s> But yes, your final point, the monitor is extremely reflective, no argument. </s>
<s> Use it in a room where the lighting isnt behind it... best you can do. </s>
<s> Nevertheless, this is one of the best 19&quot; out there. </s>
<s> Xeno, tell me something, did you lower the brightness down and the contrast? </s>
<s> what are your settings? </s>
<s> I also noticed then when the screen is set to 100% black, there is some light bleeding from the background around the edges, do you have the same problem too? </s>
<s> what about video playback? </s>
<s> on mine when I played my Seinfeld DVD it looked all grainy. </s>
<s> Does your do the same thing as well? </s>
<s> Now, don't get me wrong, I really find this monitor way above average, but this is my first LCD, so that is I am being a bit more critical about it. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I opened my second box of the second HP1905B, and yet to discover again another quality issue. </s>
<s> There is a large of what seems to be a dust particle stuck behind the LCD membrane and it is in the middle of the screen. </s>
<s> Baiscally whenever there is white, you see a gray dot of dust that cannot be removed. </s>
<s> Needless to say, the two monitors I have are returning to the store. </s>
<s> I will get two HP F1905B though, just to give them a last chance. </s>
<s> I like the clarity of the image, and it is a shame that I had QA issues 2/2. </s>
<s> I will keep you posted. </s>
<s> k, here goes, i'll try to answer all of those! </s>
<s> : Brightness/Contrast I didnt change at all. </s>
<s> I have my computer in an extremely bright room. </s>
<s> And I like brightscreens :P As for the screen being slightly bright when brightness is set down to 0, that is because of the LCDs backlight. </s>
<s> All LCDs have total black issues, and are noticable when gaming in dark maps... Thats where Plasmas have the upper hand. </s>
<s> But that isnt an option really for a PC monitor Video playback shouldnt be grainy. </s>
<s> I havent noticed that... Could it be the quality of the video source? </s>
<s> If not then your screen has issues. </s>
<s> One more thing though you might want to check is that you are running at native resolution. </s>
<s> Thats 1280*1024 for the F1905. </s>
<s> Due to the nature of LCDs, they have seperate pixels that dont scale when you change the resolution, simply the image or video feed is scaled to that resolution. </s>
<s> So lets say you are running 1600*1200 on it, you will have blurry pixels and such, due to that resolution being scaled down to 1280*1024. </s>
<s> Also if you found a peice of dust between the membrane and the backlight, that means your screen was a bad build, for sure return it. </s>
<s> I hope you dont run into anything thats unexpected with your new monitor. </s>
