Qucik checks... Verify in the bios that 1394 port(s) are ON/enabled.
Under the device mgr.
in h/w that if any red/yellow flag next to 1394 port it needs attention.
If error posted, google the error for a fix.
What Robert suggests pretty much covers the rest of your problem.
While there maybe a s/w glitch, it could quite possibility be the result of ESD damage.
the handling of ext.
devices then to ext.
port can blowout the port(static discharge).
