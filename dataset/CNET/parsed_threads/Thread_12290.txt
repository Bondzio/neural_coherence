<s> Hi there, I have a wireless network using a DI-624 router and DSL internet. </s>
<s> I have the desktop wired to the router, and the laptop has wireless access. </s>
<s> All was fine until a few months ago when we kept losing our laptop connection sporadically. </s>
<s> Come to find out that others were honing in on our connection because I didn't have it encrypted. </s>
<s> Then I couldn't get the laptop to connect to the network at all. </s>
<s> I've now got the laptop connecting to the network, but can't get an internet connection with it. </s>
<s> The desktop works fine with the internet but the laptop sees nothing. </s>
<s> I get the DNS error. </s>
<s> The network settings are: WEP enabled, using HEX key Channel 4 Any suggestions? </s>
<s> You should be using channel 1, 6 or 11. </s>
<s> Even though there are 11 channels to choose from in the USA, only 3 are non-overlapping. </s>
<s> SKrall </s>
