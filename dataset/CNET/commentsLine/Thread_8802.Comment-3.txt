i've read where putting the hd into the freezer and cooling it down temporarily gets it to work sometimes long enough to get data off of it.
the freezing cold changes the metal size and allows the stuck platter to spin again, so i assume.
good luck!
it is at least worth a try since nothing else is allowing it to be recognized at this point.
