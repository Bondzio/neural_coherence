1.1.1	so one day my pc froze and I turned it off with the power on/off button, than i tried to turn it back on, but it wont properly start.	St
1.1.2	there`s the first image that says HP events or smth, than a black screen with a white '' - '' glowing on the edge of the screen.	St
1.1.3	Btw i`ve tried booting it from a cd and usb flash - nothing.	St
1.1.4	- Ive got an HP pavillion dv2000	St
1.2.1	Be sure to unplug all USB things and try again.	St
1.2.2	No go?	St
1.2.3	Try the generic reset.	St
1.2.4	Power off, remove AC, the battery, press hold the power button for 60 seconds, release, slip in the battery, apply AC and try again.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	still nothing.	St
1.4.1	HP support website has a t/s routine that you can do.	St
1.4.2	Goto the HP website and enter your model# and look for it.	St
1.4.3	I believe the user needs to hit F1 or F10(depends on bios level), or some key(instructions on website) then follow repairs.	St
1.4.4	If a recent bios update or system upgrade and/or power status change, it could generate your problem.	St
1.4.5	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	Go get the service manual and power off, remove ac and battery (that's in the service manual) then remove the hard drive.	St
1.5.2	At this point, if it's the usual failed HDD the boot from USB and CD should work.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	so i actually got it to boot from usb, but startup repair couldnt fix it and when i tried to re-install vista an error showed up.	St
1.7.1	That might be interesting.	St
1.7.2	What error?	St
1.7.3	And what did you use as a source to reinstall it?	Ques
1.7.4	Usually Windows Vista doesn't come on flash.	St
1.7.5	Kees	St
1.8.1	start up error or atleast smth like this.	St
1.8.2	: &lt;div&gt;Problem Event Name: StartupRepairV2Problem Signature 01: AutoFailoverProblem Signature 02: 6.0.6000.16386.6.0.6000.16386Problem Signature 03: 6Problem Signature 04: 1507351Problem Signature 05: CorruptFileProblem Signature 06: CorruptFileProblem Signature 07: 3221226017Problem Signature 08: 1Problem Signature 09: WrpRepairProblem Signature 10: 0OS Version: 6.0.6000.2.0.0.256.1Locale ID: 1033 &lt;/div&gt; vista re-install error.	St
1.8.3	: Windows cannot open the file required C:\Sources\install.wim.	St
1.8.4	The file does not exist.	St
1.8.5	Make suure all files required for installation are available and restart the installation.	St
1.8.6	Error Code: 0x80070002.	St
1.8.7	well yeah, i downloaded vista recovery cd.	St
1.9.1	If you can't install from an original OEM System Recovery disk or an original Microsoft holographed Vista install DVD after a total erase of the hard disk (use free DBAN for that) something is wrong with the hardware.	St
1.9.2	Better have that repaired.	St
1.9.3	If you install from a non-original copy, there's a good chance something is wrong with the copy.	St
1.9.4	In that case, contact HP and order that recovery disk.	St
1.9.5	Kees	St
1.10.1	the recovery cd isnt original - its downloaded from the internet.	St
1.10.2	how do i contact hp.	Ques
1.10.3	?	Ques
1.11.1	How to reach their customer service should be in the documentation that came with the machine.	St
1.11.2	If you can't find it, go to www.hp.com and find it for your country.	St
1.11.3	Should be possible.	St
1.11.4	Kees	St
1.12.1	they dont send to my country.	St
1.13.1	It's a pity they don't send to your country.	St
1.13.2	Maybe the shop where you bought this machine help you to find something that works.	St
1.13.3	There might be a recovery partition on the hard disk.	St
1.13.4	If no help from the shop or the local tech, see if http://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;Sources\install.wim&quot; leads to a solution.	St
1.13.5	If not, better buy an original DVD.	St
1.13.6	be sure you have or can download from hp.com all needed drivers for the OS you choose.	St
1.13.7	That might be difficult.	St
1.13.8	Kees	St
1.14.1	Many of those don't work.	St
1.14.2	If I needed to install an OS and get my machine up on the net today I'd look again at UBUNTU (see google) Bob	St
1.15.1	HP offers from their support website to order the recovery/restore disc(s).	St
1.15.2	They are for a small cost though but definitively cheaper than anything else and made for your PC.	St
1.15.3	Just goto the HP website, find support, enter your model# and check for the ordering hyperlink.	St
1.15.4	Provided they still have Vista available, its worth the wait.	St
1.15.5	As for any recovery via the WWW source, they usually is only for minor recovery possibilities.	St
1.15.6	Its a generic source of recovery so it won;t be capable to fix either true h/w faults or anything other than the basic Vista OS footprint.	St
1.15.7	I would also do this from disc rather than a flash drive if I assume you got the .ISO file.	St
1.15.8	good luck tada -----Willy	Polite
