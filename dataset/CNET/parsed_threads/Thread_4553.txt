<s> I'm totally new to wireless networking so forgive me for my ignorance. </s>
<s> I've come a long way in the past 2 weeks thanks to you guys. </s>
<s> Although i still have fears about security i'm sure they will subside as i become more knowlegdable. </s>
<s> When i set up my wireless router i had belkin walk me through it without using the setup disk so i probably didn't learn anything. </s>
<s> Put my trust in them. </s>
<s> So i honestly don't know where to begin to check my router settings although i was told, by belkin, that they set my security to the highest level. </s>
<s> O.k,so i just bought the canon pixma mx860 and set it up myself with the setup disk and manual. </s>
<s> Everything went smoothly, plugged in the usb just in time, and install went fine. </s>
<s> Learning. </s>
<s> My question is when i came to the part about wpa or wpa2. </s>
<s> I chose wpa. </s>
<s> Should i worry? </s>
<s> TIA </s>
<s> At the top we give those suggestions. </s>
<s> Some hardware has issues with WPA2 so if you can use it without issue that's super. </s>
<s> If not, just WPA is fine too. </s>

<s> These are all new devices sony laptop, belkin router, and canon printer. </s>
<s> Should i research on how they deal with wpa2 level of encryption? </s>
<s> Tired tonight, will spend some time in the next few days on how, where, and which device to change this setting if neccessary for better security. </s>
<s> Live in a condo development and i see several users some secure, some not. </s>
<s> No expert at this stuff. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
