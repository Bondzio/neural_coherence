<s> Hello, Have an older Dell laptop. </s>
<s> The monitor went dark, smelled that characteristic toasted hardware smell coming from location near the power button (top, middle area) and soon after shut itself down. </s>
<s> When I reboot, the screen lights up and after it boots fully the screen goes dark and it shuts down again after a few minutes. </s>
<s> What could be the issue? </s>
<s> There's nothing that can be done without taking it apart and probably not much buy the user anyway. </s>
<s> You'll need to take it to a shop for a diagnosis and estimate. </s>
<s> Since you said it's an older Dell, I'd say consider it gone. </s>
<s> You may still be able to remove the hard drive, put that in an external enclosure and retrieve you data. </s>
<s> That toasted smell is really a harbringer of things to come. </s>
<s> The priority here is your data. </s>
<s> External enclosures are indeed easier to come by than opening everything up. </s>
