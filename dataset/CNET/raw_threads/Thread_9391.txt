A white screen will take on a purple tint, then green, then white, then off-white, ec. I've been looking on newegg for a new monitor, and I'm wondering if maybe I should give her my monitor (ViewSonic E70 - LOVE it), and get the new one for myself. I was originally thinking flat screen CRT: ViewSonic E70F+SB Metallic on Black 17&quot; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824116254 But then, I thought about some LCDs, and thought maybe I could get one of them. Acer AL1511 Black 15&quot; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824009047 HP L1506 Black 15&quot; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824176040 I know they're not the speedy-est monitors, but I don't do much gaming. However, I do watch my DVDs on my PC. Is 25ms too slow for watching movies? If so, how about 16ms? I've never owned an LCD display (unless you count my Pocket PC). I suppose I don't really /need/ the LCD, but it would be nice. Thoughts/comments/suggestions? Thanks... Or even better yet, any suggestions on a different monitor that's better than the three listed above? If it's CRT, I want flat screen if possible. Thanks again! -Christopher
