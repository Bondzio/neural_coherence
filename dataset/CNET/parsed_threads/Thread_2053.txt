<s> I plug the flash drive into the pc and it reads &quot;usb device&quot; but when I look for the drive letter it doesn't exist. </s>
<s> Is there a way to turn on drive letters for external devices? </s>
<s> The cd-rom shows as d: but the usb doesn't automatically turn up as any letter. </s>
<s> I can see the flash drive in the device manager but I don't see the letter. </s>
<s> Your USB drive and another drive on the system are trying to use the same drive letter. </s>
<s> Change the drive letter of your CD drive to something else. </s>
<s> Right click on My Computer--&gt;Manage Click on Disk Management under Storage Right click on your CD Drive--&gt; Change Drive letter and Path. </s>
<s> Click on Change and change the letter to somthing else (E). </s>
<s> That was it - it was My Computer, Manage, Storage, Disk Management - yay! </s>
