1.1.1	I am planning to buy a used CRT monitor Viewsonic A90F ( VGA input ) that has been used for roughly 2 years .	St
1.1.2	Link http : //reviews.cnet.com/crt-monitors/viewsonic-a90f/4507-3175_7-8773931.html ? tag=sub My questions are : 1 .	Ques
1.1.3	Since I recently purchased a motherboard , how would I know the video format type ( DVI or VGA ) the motherboard supports .	St
1.1.4	The mobo is based on Intel P965 express chipset .	St
1.1.5	Full spec here - http : //www.newegg.com/product/product.asp ? item=N82E16813121035 2 .	St
1.1.6	I would like to connect my DVD player to the monitor .	St
1.1.7	The DVD player has both S-Video and component video output ( RGB ) but I am not sure ( could not find from the link above ) if the monitor has component video input ports .	St
1.1.8	Can anyone please clarify this ?	Ques
1.1.9	3 .	St
1.1.10	If component video ports are not present in the monitor , is there some kind of adapter in the marker that will convert component RGB to VGA .	St
1.1.11	Thanks !	St
1.1.12	!	St
1.2.1	From the info on Intel , you would need a separate video card .	St
1.2.2	See here : http : //www.intel.com/design/motherbd/lt/lt_available.htm That monitor does not appear to have any other inputs than VGA http : //www.viewsonic.com/pdf/userguides/a90fplus-1_ug_eng.pdf You may be just as able to play the DVD on your PC rather than try to play it on a DVD player and connect to the monitor .	St
1.2.3	Any conversion device is going to be way more than putting a DVD drive in your computer , if you do not have one now .	St
1.3.1	I searched for several video cards which suuport VGA port but most of them list the following ports : D-SUB , DVI , S-Video .	St
1.3.2	Foe e.g. , http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814102086 Seems like the D-SUB port is the same as VGA port ( it has 15 pins ) .	St
1.3.3	So , this video card would be compatible with a CRT monitor .	St
1.3.4	Right ?	Ques
1.3.5	Since I have a laptop with a 15pin VGA port , I want to hook-up my desktop CPU with the laptop and use the laptop monitor instead of buying a separate CRT monitor for cost-cutting .	St
1.3.6	But this will only work if the VGA port on the laptop has physically the same dimensions as the VGA ports on normal desktop CRT monitors .	St
1.3.7	The VGA port on my laptop is here : See component # 7 on page9 in http : //h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c00325428.pdf I can atleast confirm that the laptop VGA port is not a mini-VGA ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-VGA ) .	St
1.3.8	Do you know if VGA ports on laptops are physically different from VGA ports on CRT monitors ?	Ques
1.4.1	It sounds like you asked it you could use the screen on your laptop as the monitor for the desktop , it that correct ?	Ques
1.4.2	If that is correct , then the answer is no .	St
1.4.3	That VGA port on the laptop is to connect an external monitor to the laptop so you can use the external monitor with the laptop .	St
1.4.4	It is not an input port .	St
1.4.5	The VGA port on the laptop should be the same as the input connector on the monitor , but it is not intended for connecting two computers together .	St
