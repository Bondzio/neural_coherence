first of all, my sincere apologies for having posted this question as a reply on another issue by mistake.
i have a mac g3 powerbook, 333mhz, 4gb hd, 8mb video, cd.
everytime i try to upgrade my x os operating system from 10.2 version to a newer version i get a message saying i do not have enough hd space.
i have transferred quite a few files to a portable drive to clear space but still get the message.
is there something else i can do to get the upgrade?
thanks, sandovh
