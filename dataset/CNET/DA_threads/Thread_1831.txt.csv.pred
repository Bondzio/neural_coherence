1.1.1	I have a gtx 295 co-op , it is two 295 gpus in one card .	St
1.1.2	http : //www.evga.com/articles/00478/ Now here is my question .	St
1.1.3	I beleive it is a 680 watt minimum .	St
1.1.4	So if I get a 700w power supply will my computer be okay ?	Ques
1.1.5	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817182173	Ques
1.2.1	Here are my specs .	St
1.2.2	Amd 2 x4 750gb hard drive 8gigs of ram	St
1.3.1	Not with that psu .	St
1.3.2	That card is looking for 46 amps on a single rail .	St
1.3.3	Maybe this might be a better fit .	St
1.3.4	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817139021	Ques
1.4.1	so the sli-ready is probably fine since 12w will come off the pci-e board connection and the other two connectors only need lesss than 20w each .	St
1.4.2	a single rail high voltage psu will feed power to both pci-e connectors from the single rail , but others will feed it from two rails .	St
1.4.3	if you 're still worried , this sli certified one will definitely fit the bill for $ 90 since each 12v rail is rated at 25w : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817371026	Ques
1.5.1	After fixing too many multiple rail systems ( re-jigger power connections ) I am now a fan of the single rail PSU when ever possible .	St
1.5.2	One less thing for the builder to get wrong .	St
1.5.3	And half the work in those jobs was to give a short course in power supplies .	St
1.5.4	I do n't know which was harder , the machine repair or explaining why we did n't replace parts and why .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
