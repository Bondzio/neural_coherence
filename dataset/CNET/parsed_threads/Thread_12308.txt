<s> Which is your favorite hard drive brand and why? </s>
<s> Personally I am a avid fan and user of WD so that makes it my favorite brand. </s>
<s> To me, it is reliable and stable. </s>
<s> Pricing wise is reasonable. </s>
<s> Well I always shop for my computer needs on Newegg. </s>
<s> And when it comes time for me to get a hard drive I look at the reviews/storage capacity/price and see what I can get for the best bang for my buck. </s>
<s> I always try to stick to WD and Seagate though. </s>
<s> Right now I've been using Seagate and I haven't had any problems. </s>
<s> I've been using Western Digital. </s>
<s> It's reliable and the products i'm using are surpassing my expectations. </s>
<s> I buy the one that gives me the best bangs for the bucks. </s>
<s> So far..no regret. </s>
<s> Today they all are pretty reliable and for me it boils down to cost. </s>
<s> Realiablity is really just a matter of luck and if you are unlucky no matter which brand you choose could end up being flaky. </s>
<s> But I don't care, hard drive are cheap and as long as I got my data backed up, I have no worries. </s>
<s> Just my 2 cents. </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>
<s> I have been useing seagate's since - well - so long cant remember - mid 80's, ''in the begining...'' LOL the wd's used to be a joke but I 'think' seagate bought them so by now they should be up to seagate quality. </s>
<s> First choice is always WD, great reliability, performance and longevity at very good prices. </s>
<s> Fallback choices, Hitachi and Samsung for 2.5&quot; drives and Seagate for 3.5&quot; but only when I can't source a WD. </s>
<s> More to the point Seagate with 5 year warranty. </s>
<s> I've been using these drives for a long time. </s>
<s> To get the 5 year warranty one has to purchase enterprise class drives or retail box drives that are labeled &quot;5 year warranty.&quot; Seagate also sells drives with 1 and 3 year warranties, mostly into the OEM and external markets. </s>
<s> Maxtor is now owned by Seagate. </s>
<s> Still only carries a 3 year warranty on retail packaging.. </s>
<s> Seagate bought Maxtor. </s>
<s> Western Digital is still their own company. </s>
<s> Their product has improved radically in the last several years, especially with high-performance drives like the Raptor family. </s>
<s> getting too old - sorry WD.. LOL I used to love hearing when a drive went down and was maxtor. </s>
<s> made a lot of money installing new seagates. </s>
<s> good ol' error 1701. </s>
<s> In the last 6 years, I've had two Hitachi, two WD, and two Samsung drives die on me. </s>
<s> In their defense, the WD and Samsung drives were over 60 degrees C in a poorly-ventilated case, which is beyond the rated temperature, but I'm placing my bets on my two fairly new Seagate drives for now. </s>
<s> I have yet to see a recent Seagate/Maxtor drive die. </s>
<s> I think the last bad Seagate I saw was an 80 MB 5.25&quot;. </s>
<s> (yes, megabyte). </s>
<s> you are dateing us - I bought the newest, fastest available to increase from 10MB to 20MB </s>
<s> For the past several years I have used nothing but Seagate Cheetah 15K SACI or SAS drives. </s>
<s> They have a five year warantee. </s>
<s> Note - there are very few high density 15k drives out their </s>
<s> Like others, I preferred western digital too. </s>
<s> I feel that the pricing is reasonable for its stability, reliability, storage space and performance. </s>
<s> Moreover I am a avid user of WD products. </s>
<s> Hands down my answer is Hitachi. </s>
<s> I spend the bit higher amount, but in all my computers and all the operatings systems, the ones that live on are Hitachi. </s>
<s> WD and all the others die on me in around 1 year or just past it. </s>
<s> In fact the last brand new computer I had built one year ago had a WD and in one day it gave me a failure notice! </s>
<s> I had the builder purchase a Hitachi and it is still going! </s>
<s> Recently I bought a new WD hard drive, the one with the SAS interface and it never disappointed. </s>
<s> The WD S25 delivers ultra-high performance with its 3 Gb/s and 6 Gb/s SAS interfaces and a sustained sequential data rate of 128 MB/sec. </s>
<s> In addition to all the speed required to service any enterprise need, the WD S25 also provides a 1.6 M hour MTBF rating. </s>
<s> I must say I'm impressed. </s>
<s> I've been building computers for myself and for friends for a dozen years now. </s>
<s> I've used practically every brand of hard drive out there. </s>
<s> The only brand that has a 100% survival rating is Samsung. </s>
<s> I've got several that are 11 years old and still going strong. </s>
<s> Maybe the new WD drives are better, but my failure rate with them used to be quite high. </s>
<s> Nowadays Samsung is the only brand I'll put in the computers I build. </s>
<s> I have one of the new Samsung 1 TB drives in my newest computer and it is awesome! </s>
<s> In a few more that 20 years, I have experienced two harddrive failures. </s>
<s> Both of these were Western Digital Caviar drives. </s>
<s> One drive was on a new computer still under warranty and was replaced by the manufacturer. </s>
<s> The other was an older drive, of unknown history, salvaged from a discarded computer. </s>
<s> That ran for several months after being installed in a pieced together computer before failing. </s>
<s> I have heard similar storied from friends concerning WD drives and have not heard such stories concerning Seagate drives. </s>
<s> It is for these reasons that I prefer Seagate if that option is available. </s>
<s> I would have to agree with this statement. </s>
<s> As long as you stick to the major brands, it is a matter of luck of the pick from the assembly line. </s>
<s> One extra step I sometimes do is google the model number to see if there is a larger than normal amount of complaints for a particular model, so I don't get stuck with a device that has a design flaw. </s>
<s> I have a pc 3 years old in september. </s>
<s> acer that came with an Hatachi 500gb, I added the first week of ownership a Western Digital and 3 years and two months later the Western Digital failed. </s>
<s> Even for a back up drive with very little on it I was rather disappointed. </s>
<s> It got pretty hot. </s>
<s> Ive unplugged it and once it cooled down it ran fine. </s>
<s> I put a fan right in front of the hard drive in the case and still shut down every 3 days. </s>
<s> So perhaps Western Digital sold me a fluke of a lemon? </s>
<s> Oh, the warrenty expired on the 3 year mark. </s>
<s> this p,o,s died exactly 2 months later. </s>
<s> I've had the best experience with Seagate. </s>
<s> I've had several WDs to fail, but the Seagates I've worked with seem to hold up better. </s>
