1.1.1	I just installed a new 250 GB HD into my Dell Dimension 8250.	St
1.1.2	BIOS recognizes it and that it has 250 GB, however, I can't boot from the CD-ROM to start to format the drive.	St
1.1.3	I've changed the boot sequence and still doesn't work.	St
1.1.4	Don't even hear the CD spn.	St
1.1.5	Thoughts?	St
1.2.1	Make sure the HD harnesses and those of the CD as well are properly configued either for master/slave or CS setup.	St
1.2.2	That bios is setup for &quot;AUTO&quot; or similar mode that the wire harness refects all that.	St
1.2.3	Verify jumpers on CD & HD are what you need.	St
1.2.4	Power is firmly seated, etc.. What are your results?	St

1.3.1	I too am having a problem installing a new hard drive in a Dell Poweredge server, 500SC.	St
1.3.2	I removed the old drive and installed a new one, both IDE.	St
1.3.3	However, the new drive shows in bios, however, when the Windows 2000 Server CD gets to the point to reformat the drive a message comes up and says no drives are available.	St
1.3.4	I did clear the bios configuration so it would see the new drive and since then , not even the old drive will boot up.	St
1.3.5	any suggestions would be GREATly appreciated!	St
1.3.6	GNL	St
1.4.1	If that Dell server has a bios area for this, check it.	St
1.4.2	It seems some Dell servers when in bios, asks if you &quot;repaired the cpu&quot;, check YES and then will check the HDs required to boot-up from.	St
1.4.3	Maybe, i got this confused but if the HD has been repaired as well(replaced) be sure it look for a bootable path.	St
1.4.4	Dell sometimes offers encpyrtic lingo and suggests something but its what you need to check into.	St
1.4.5	Surf, the bios into all areas and verify that.	St
1.4.6	Dell offers similar and better help at thier support website.	St
