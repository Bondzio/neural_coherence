1.3.1	Sweet , the cards is being called the fastest , but will it work smoothly with the processor and ram , i also have a 700watt power supply	St
1.4.1	It seems you have a pretty good system .	St
1.4.2	I do n't foresee any major conflicts .	St
1.4.3	I do however suggest you look into the PSU ( power supply ) side as that will strongly determine the uptime of this system as it will sustain heavy power demands .	St
1.4.4	You should look for a SLI certified PSU and/or of least 500W or better and cheap is cheap ( not good ) .	St
1.4.5	The better PSUs are into the $ 150+ range and there 's a reason for that as for similar wattage units costs less *may not* maintain their wattage output for long under heavy demands and/or build-up systems with all the goodies .	St
1.4.6	If you do n't have problems within 30-90days but do later get flaky issues , consider the PSU at fault , excluding s/w issues .	St
1.4.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	Hope this answers your question .	St
1.6.1	at this time .	St
1.6.2	As noted do n't forget about the psu .	St
1.6.3	If you want to go SLI figure 750-1000w .	St
