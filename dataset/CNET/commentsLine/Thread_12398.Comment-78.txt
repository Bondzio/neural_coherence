nice to see that we are all in the same boat.
:-p well i am going to look at the phaser 6360 and see how that does.
i am floating between that and the ricoh c400 series - either the 411 or 420. the ricoh is supposed to have better print quality, 1200x1200 res, but the smallest size is 2.8 x 5.8 and i need smallest size to be 3x5...has anyone tried either of those printers or the phaser 6360?
wouldn't it be great if they started making mini digital presses??
?
