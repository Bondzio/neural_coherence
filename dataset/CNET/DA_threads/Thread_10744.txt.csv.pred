1.1.1	using a windowxp pro os ... with plenty of ram stick with onboard audio and a soundblaster pci card ... now is it possible to use two soundcards at once.. now the reason im asking is because i have two separate inputs specifically for mic..i 'd like to record simultaneously ... guitar and voice ... . now ive tried the splitter and it really degrades the signal ... as we know with a splitter we get half the channel ... by the way i am using a soundblaster live 5.1 ... with line in mic in headphone and line out ... any ideas ?
