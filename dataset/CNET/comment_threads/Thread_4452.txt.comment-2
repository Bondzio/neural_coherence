This is something your support needs to work with you on.
Here in the USA folk in such condition have support around them and they have to work with you to find a solution.
At the office we are porting Android apps so a quick check found none were any better at a toe tap.
I wonder if my co-workers caught me doing this.
--&gt; But that's not what I found to be a big issue.
I had difficulty turning on all the tablets.
So your support would have to rig or make a holder that allow you to operate the power and other buttons.
Hope this helps, Bob
