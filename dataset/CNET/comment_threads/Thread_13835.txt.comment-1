I have an IDE HDD with an SATA DVD/RW and it takes about 5 mins to boot.
Once it finally boots everything runs as smooth as a baby's bottom.
But it just takes forever to boot up.
But when I unplug the SATA DVD rom and plug in a regular ide cd rom drive to the same cable as the HDD and set its jumper to slave it boots in seconds.
Is there maybe some setting I'm missing in my bios?
