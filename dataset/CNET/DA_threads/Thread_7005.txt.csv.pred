1.1.1	i have a rosewill smartone case , i have 7x120mm fans , one in the front , one in the back , one on top , two on the left side , and two on the right side i cut and installed myself to pull heat off of the back of my motherboard .	St
1.1.2	the one in the front is going in , the one on top is out , the one on back is out , the one on the left side is blowing air down on to the cpu , the second one on the left side is a highflow fan and its pulling air out away from my crossfired cards , i was wondering if there was a better way to arange them to get lower temps , the cpu is idleing around 30c , load at 60c , the cards idle at 32c and top out around 65c on crysis maxed .	St
1.2.1	You 'll have to test each combination of direction and measure where it goes .	St
1.2.2	Put all that into some spreadsheet so you can make your decision .	St
1.2.3	Here I would not change a thing since the numbers look ok. Bob	St
1.3.1	im wanting to start ocing soon , so i would like to have the temps down a little lower than that , but i think what you said will be a good idea , thanks .	St
1.4.1	Then you would not stop at doing the test as well as doing what all overclockers do such as installing better cooling systems .	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	i belive there is a little cooling to be gotten out of what i already have , i dont have the money to go buy a new cooling system right now .	St
1.6.1	What many discover after doing this a few dozen times is that there is no correct way to arrange fans .	St
1.6.2	There are guides but only by changing and testing do you find if your custom setup is better or worse in each arrangement .	St
1.6.3	Then again , many just leave the side cover off and they 're done .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
