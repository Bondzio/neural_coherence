<s> My wife's GeForce GTS 250 started running really hot a few days ago. </s>
<s> Nothing to bad in nonGPU intensive games, like DCUO, but whenever she loads up Skyrim or SWTOR it shoots into the 90s before very long. </s>
<s> Well it used to stay in the 70's under load, and 90c is a little hot for me, so I decided to clean it out. </s>
<s> I've never opened a graphics card before, but it wasn't too hard. </s>
<s> I cleaned out ungodly amounts of dust and cat hair from the air intake of the GPU, so I'm guessing that is what caused the overheating. </s>
<s> Well, I cleaned the old thermal compound off of the GPU and heatsink, then put on some new stuff (just the radio shack brand that I had lying around). </s>
<s> Everywhere I read told me not to put too much on, so I put on barely enough to cover the GPU, even though when I originally opened it the compound was EVERYWHERE, like they had used gobs. </s>
<s> Well, I immediately closed it back up, threw it into the computer and booted up. </s>
<s> I use EVGA Precision to monitor temps, and when she went into SWTOR it shot into the 100's almost instantly before I pulled the plug. </s>
<s> Should I apply more thermal paste? </s>
<s> does it need to sit for a while after application before use? </s>
<s> Is this card just trash? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Billy </s>
<s> I know it's real easy with CPUs to get one of the 4 corners not fully down which makes for very poor heat transfer. </s>
<s> I can't see your work but you'll need to have heat sink surface flush on top of the GPU and perfectly parallel. </s>
<s> You didn't mention whether it had a fan. </s>
<s> If so, I'd wonder if it's working properly. </s>
<s> The whole heatsink/fan contraption sits on top of the gpu area. </s>
<s> It connects with about 9 screws, all as tight as I can make them without worrying about cracking the board. </s>
<s> The fan works, I've even made sure it changes speeds. </s>
<s> I applied more thermal paste, and it helped a small bit, but it still climbed to 101c before I shut it down. </s>
<s> On the desktop it idles at about 54c, which is higher than it used to, but as soon as anything graphics heavy happens, it shoots up quickly. </s>
<s> But for now the best advice is to get more cool air around that card. </s>
<s> I've seen folk BATTLE this and then they put on the case cover and wonder why it can't cool. </s>

<s> You also didn't mention a fan and that could be important. </s>
<s> 9 screws is quite a lot. </s>
<s> The difference could be in how you sequence the process of seating the screws. </s>
<s> You'd need to hold the heat sink in place firmly while seating them. </s>
<s> You'd need to try your best to bring down the screws opposite one another just to the point of feeling resistance until all screws felt the same. </s>
<s> You'd repeat that sequencing in small increments until the screws were snug but not tight. </s>
<s> Never would the torque sequence just be done by CW or CCW motion. </s>
<s> I can almost guarantee this will cause the heat sink to list on the GPU. </s>
<s> It may be possible that some component in the temperature sensing circuit got damaged and you're getting false readings. </s>
<s> You do want to make sure that you get proper air flow and this might mean moving cards around or adding a fan directed on the heat sink if it doesn't already have one. </s>
<s> The case and card have pretty good airflow, there are six fans on the case, two of which blow directly onto the gpu. </s>
<s> The temperature sensor I believe is working as if I leave it on the desktop it will stay at one temperature, if I go into low GPU using games the temperature slowly climbs to around the low 80's. </s>
<s> It's once I get into a gpu intensive game that it shoots up almost instantly to the 100's and forces me to power down to save it. </s>
<s> I will try to open it, clean it, put more thermal paste on it and then put the screws in very slowly, maybe a turn for each screw, then another turn for each screw, etc until they are all down. </s>
<s> Let's say the air flow, compound, screws, fans are not the issue. </s>
<s> What is left? </s>
<s> The software. </s>
<s> As you know these cards have variable clock rates so a change in the driver or someone changing a setting in some panel could be IT. </s>
<s> Some have accepted drivers from Microsoft and seen this happen. </s>
<s> The card could be failing but lets get all the usual suspects up on deck. </s>
