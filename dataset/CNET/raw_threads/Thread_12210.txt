Hi, im having problems with the installation of Audigy Card Drviers/software. im running Windows XP, so when i reboot the pooter, after i put the card in, it installs the drivers automatically.. In the case of this sound card this is dumb, because, anyone who has used this before will know that you can install the software, players AND drivers from the CD. Now, i had installed the drivers on their own using XP, but then i found about the stuff i said above. upon doing this, i find that all sound ceases to play. This is very fustrating, as i would assume that the installation from the CD and all that would make the sound work even better. Im asking here first, because this is a forum, and Creative Tech Support probably wont help. All i want is my sound, but i want to have it, with all the Creative software installed. someone please help!!! (P.S Merry Christmas!) thanks -John

I found newer drivers at www.soundblaster.com There is some issue with SBLive/Audigys and some VIA based boards. Usually you can move the card to another slot and that clears it up IF you've loaded the most recent motherboard drivers. I haven't noted any big issue about XP installing it's stock drivers and then installing newer. Bob

What you could try is letting Windows do its thing and then, open your Agui's Properties from the Divice manager, and cilick on the drivers tab then on Update drivers and choose &quot;I will select the drivers to be installed,&quot; then install the proper ones.
