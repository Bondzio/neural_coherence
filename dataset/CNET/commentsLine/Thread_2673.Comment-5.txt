i found that &quot;generics&quot; when in hand and that are heavy usually can be trusted and be 500w+.
i have found huge rating on similar looking genercis of 400w+(and others) but are light as a feather sorta speak, they don't last long.
i recommend on namebrands, antec, enermax, and deer, plus sparkle, though enlight could work if not too demanding.
check the websites of geeks and newegg for decent psus.
