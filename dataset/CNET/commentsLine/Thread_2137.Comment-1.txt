alright, so i know very little about anything &quot;tech&quot; but i'm looking into buying a (midrange priced) computer so i looked into some things i might need.
here's my question: i'm looking into the dell xps 410. i seem to be hearing (and reading) that the difference between the e6600 and e6700 core 2 duo processors is very small, so the choice would be between the e6600 and the e6400.
my question is that if i spring for the e6600, will my 1 gb of ram waste the extra speed?
with only 1 gig of ram, would the difference between the 6600 and the 6400 be so small that it's not worth the price differential?
or would you suggest the 6600 and 2 gigs of ram (with the price increase involved.....on the order of 3-4 hundred).
information on all of them would be nice, but i'm also looking for the best price-to-performance.
thanks.
