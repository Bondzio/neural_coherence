<s> ive put to gether a computer and im having trouble getting it to work. </s>
<s> every time i select tthe partition to load it will take me to a screen giving me options about safe mode i have tried all the options and all that is happening is the computer is restarting. </s>
<s> it came up with a cpu has been changed message and a message saying something about defaults being loaded. </s>
<s> but so far nothing has worked. </s>
<s> ive tried messing with the bios and changing the cmos battery ive tried loads of hard drives with different os installed on them but so far nothing has worked. </s>
<s> its running ( well trying to ) AMD athlon 1.3 ghz i think ( its what the bios is saying) nVidia ge force 8800 WD 60gb hdd 1.5 gb ram if you have a solution can you email me at mistachance@hotmail.com as i dont really check this much. </s>
<s> any help is appreciated thanx oh i forgot to mention the mother board has sata chips and connections and ide connections im trying to run a ide hard drive. </s>
<s> Is this a used hard drive with a previous installation of Windows? </s>
<s> If so, from XP and upward, it's not going to run on hardware other than that it was installed on. </s>
<s> Your best bet is to erase the drive by deleting all partitions first. </s>
<s> Then, boot from your Windows CD to begin the installation. </s>
<s> It will create the partition, format the drive, and install itself. </s>
<s> As long as the hard drive is recognized in the BIOS and compatible with your version of Windows, this should get you started. </s>
<s> Of course you'll need to have driver disks handy including those for the motherboard. </s>
<s> so i should erase everything on the hard drive and start again with my windows XP disk? </s>
<s> we did try a hard drive with 98 on wich didnt work eaither. </s>
<s> il give this a go and then get back to the forum thanx for you help. </s>
<s> and the OS can perform the upgrade maintaining all programs and data intact. </s>
<s> This isn't often the case. </s>
<s> Erase the drive and delete all partitions. </s>
<s> My preference is to do so with the manufacturer's utility that writes zeros to all locations and does a thorough surface analysis that will disclose defects. </s>
<s> If any media defects are found, chuck the drive and get another one. </s>
<s> hey ive decidedto just use a blank hdd will hat be ok thanx for your help so far </s>
