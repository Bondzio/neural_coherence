hi all.
i have 2 x 1gb of patriot ddr3 1333 ram, and 2 x 1gb of corsair ddr3 1333 ram.
my motherboard (asus p5e3 ws professional) has the latest bios, and i'm running 64-bit vista ultimate.
both of these dual channel memory modules work fine as a pair.
however, when i try to have both pairs running for a total of 4 gb, windows won't boot.
are there any steps i could take to get these modules to work together, or should i rma one?
any help is greatly appreciated.
thanks
