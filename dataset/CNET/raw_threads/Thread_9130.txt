Got the internet sharing working fine, but I'm still having problems with file sharing from the laptop to the desktop (can't even &quot;see&quot; the laptop, but I can ping it). Currently, I have it setup so both computers use the router as the access point for the internet and for file transfer. Would it be &quot;better&quot; to set up an ad-hoc network with the laptop connecting to the desktop and using the desktop to share its internet connection? In my n00bie mind, I tend to think that this setup would have better results as far as success with file sharing. Any thoughts?
