my son has a rather new gateway with a celeron processor, 256 ram and running won xp home.
very little has been added - a file sharing program of course.
it ran pretty fast out of the box, but is now slow - even opening the control panel is slow.
i don't think a celeron should run slow like this, but who knows.
we have defragmented, all windows updates are current and same for norton anti-virus.
anyone have any tips for speeding this thing up?
