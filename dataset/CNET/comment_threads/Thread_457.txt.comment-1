hi all, ok, I have RCN's &quot;10&quot; speed internet, a toshiba pcx 2500 cable modem, a phone router from vonage, and a wgr 614v6 wireless router, wired in that order.
here's the problem: when there is a power failure (doesn't happen often, but .
.
.
), after the power comes back on the wireless connection on my laptop says the signal is there but it doesn't actually work.
I have to recycle the modem/routers one at a time in wired order to get things back to normal.
is there a way to do something so i wouldn't have to do that (in case the power goes off when i'm not around and neighbors using the wifi can get on)?
also this pcx 2500 modem, I pay $3 to rcn for it, it's 2 years old at least, is this thing up to date technology?
thank you -- fj
