let's talk about your network setup for a second.
you have 2 computers and those two are connected to a switch and the switch is connected to a router.
is this a single network or do you have other things connected to the router?
i'm assuming your're using a switch bec there aren't enough ports on the router.
otherwise, if i were you, i would just get rid of the switch and connect both computer to the router (kiss).
also are the two computers hardwire or wireless?
