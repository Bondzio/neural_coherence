I have a w2k box set up to perform 802.1x authentication for my wireless network, using EAP-TLS. For authentication type I have use smart card or certificate, and have both the user cert and to Root CA cert installed. When I check the Validate server certificate option the connection fails, and I get an entry in event viewer on the w2k boc idicating an invalid user name or password. When I leave the box unchecked I connect just fine. Any thoughts?

Yes, I have contacted Linksys, and they're looking into it. They have actually been pretty responsive on this issue, but no cure yet. I was hopping you might have some ideas, but if it's a driver issue, I'm stuck till they fix it. Rob

There is no crack worth noting here that doesn't take an armada of machines to break into. One has to declare a goal. Ours was simple. Security that was strong enough and we could expect to work for a month at a time (when we change wifi wpa passwords.) Bob

I'm just one of those folks that if I know of a security hole, I like to plug it.

The attack I was specifically a type of MITM attack against EAP-TLS and PEAP where an attacker gets between the client and the AP. During the initial phases, the attacker sends the client a bogus cert. If the client is not required to validate the cert, then it blindly accepts the cert and authenticates with the bogus set up. The attacker can then relay to the actual server and authenticate on to the wireless network. The attacker is now in a position to intercept and decrypt all traffic between the client, and the real AP. This is a fairly sophisticated attack that would be difficult to mount against a setup like mine, and there are ways to ensure that you are on the right network, but in an environment where you have a wireless network spanning multiple buildings, this could be a cause for concern.
