I ordered and paid for an Alienware pc on 20th Feb 08.
Cost 2400.
I received the pc on 13th March 08.
On startup I found several files missing this corrected everything seemed ok until I actually ran a game on it.
The fans came on and it sounded just like a vacuum cleaner.
It was returned to them on the advice of one of their technicians and they received it on the 19th March.
After numerous emails and phone calls no one could tell me what was hapenning with the pc and the last call on 11th April I was told it could take a month I can only think they must have a part time techie in the workshop which apparently has no communication with customer service department as they say they dont know what is happening.
My son recommended Alienware but I dont think I can do the same.
