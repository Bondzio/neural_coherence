i would like to know if anyone is using iogega's 1tb storcenter network hard drive.
i currently have a netgear sc101, but it uses a proprietary file system that can only be read by installing netgear's software on the systems using the drives.
so, if i have 3 systems on my home network, then i need to install the software on each system, which is a bit of a pain.
also, there is no support of apple mac systems on my network.
and worst of all, is the proprietary file system, which, should something happen the the sc101, i cannot remove the drive(s) from the unit and read them on another system.
i would like to know if, once i install the iomega nas on my network: 1. what file system does it use, and it is proprietary?
2. would i be able to access data from both pcs and macs on my network 3. do i need to install software on each system on my network in order to use the nas on each system 4. does it use eide or sata drives in the unit and lastly, the one positive thing about the netgear was that it could quiesce the drives if they weren't being used.. is this function available with the iomega?
