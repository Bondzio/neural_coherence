1.1.1	Suddenly , when I boot up my computer , the screen on the monitor ( albeit old ) briefly shows the desktop , and then the image gets swallowed up into blackness .	St
1.1.2	( That is literally what it looks likenot a sudden blackout , but the image collapsing inward as if into a black hole . )	St
1.1.3	Occasionally , I can get things to work by various means , and I thought I had it licked , but this morning I just could n't make anything work for more than an instant .	St
1.1.4	Obviously , I ca n't do any work on that machine , even though the CPU shows the right light , the keyboard lights up when the computer is booted up , the mouse lights up when it 's moved and so on .	St
1.1.5	I thought that this showed that I needed to replace my monitor , but one of my two sisters said that she thought it meant that my computer was failing .	St
1.1.6	I am looking to you for advice .	St
1.1.7	The computer is a G4 ( Sawtooth model ) desktop with a separate monitor .	St
1.1.8	It 's running OS 10.4.11 .	St
1.1.9	The hard drive was replaced only a few years ago .	St
1.1.10	I reinstalled and updated the operating system recently with a brand-new copy of Tiger .	St
1.1.11	I have n't received any weird messages .	Polite
1.1.12	Please ask for any other information you might need , but I hope that this will do for now .	St
1.1.13	I 'm on a laptop that is itself not in the greatest shape itself , and I hate to use it any more than I must .	St
1.1.14	( I have kept it on OS 9 in order to be able to help my mother with any problems she might encounter on her computer , and I suspect that it would n't work well with OS X , anyway , with its smallish HD . )	St
1.1.15	Thanks for your input .	St
1.1.16	jenny I backed up my files yesterday , so I 'm not going to be in big trouble .	St
1.2.1	Hi again .	St
1.2.2	Boot the G4 from one of your myriad of OS X disks , preferably one that actually works , and see if the video problem remains .	St
1.2.3	If it does then you have ruled out a software problem .	St
1.2.4	If possible , try a different monitor .	St
1.2.5	Does your graphics card have VGA as well as ADC connections ?	Ques
1.2.6	VGA is the smaller connection that you would normally find on a PC .	St
1.2.7	If the problem goes away , you 've got your answer , but , if it does n't , you still have your answer , the graphics card is failing .	St
1.2.8	Well done on the backup thing .	St
1.2.9	Nice to hear that some people actually do things like that .	St
1.2.10	How is that OS 9 toting Mumsie ?	Ques
1.2.11	P	St
1.3.1	Thanks , and I 'll try all this as soon as I can .	St
1.3.2	( I 'm going out to meet a friend soon and see a documentary , my reward for virtue , I guess . )	St
1.3.3	Unfortunately , though I backed up on both a thumb drive and a CD , some of the folders came out on the thumb drive as generic PC files !	St
1.3.4	I 'll check the CD when I come home and hope to find that those folders are OK there .	St
1.3.5	Not terribly serious , because I have some ( slightly earlier ) version of many of them on an external drive , but a real nuisance .	St
1.3.6	I 've no idea what happened , but now I suspect that my sister was right and the whole computer is going mad .	St
1.3.7	I hope I 'm wrong .	St
1.3.8	Back in a while .	St
1.3.9	Thanks for the prompt , informative answerthough a quick reading left me a little puzzled about the connectors for the monitor .	St
1.3.10	I 'll have to read it more carefully , later .	St
1.3.11	Jenny	St
1.4.1	Booting with OSx disk ( the good one , the multiple duds being history ) .	St
1.4.2	As before , an intact image appears briefly , then disappears .	St
1.4.3	In neither case did anything look fragmented .	St
1.4.4	The screen just went black .	St
1.4.5	Once , a day or so ago , when I unplugged the monitor , I could get the image to hold for a while , but this time ( trying to boot from the OSX DVD ) , all I could get when I clicked the button on the front of the monitor that turns it on and off ( otherwise , the image never appears ) , the desktop went black after just a moment of beautiful clarity and resolution .	St
1.4.6	Monitor .	St
1.4.7	I have no other monitor to try , but the one I have is attached to the G4 with a VGA connection on the computer .	St
1.4.8	I assume that the unused connection on the computer is the ADC or something else .	St
1.4.9	It has what seems to be two rows of seven or so holes .	St
1.4.10	I know this sounds very ignorant .	St
1.4.11	Well , I admit it .	St
1.4.12	I am ignorant .	St
1.4.13	So I guess I 'm still in the same position .	St
1.4.14	Or maybe not .	Res
1.4.15	Maybe I need to try buying a new monitor .	St
1.4.16	I assume that I can return it , if that does n't work , even though it may involve restocking fees .	St
1.4.17	I really , really do n't want to buy a new computer now .	St
1.4.18	I 've just invested a lot in a copy of Tiger and am only now getting used to it .	St
1.4.19	Further , I have loads of non-Intel software ( and for all I know , hardware as well ) and files composed in OS9 ( supported by Classic ) .	St
1.4.20	It 's my impression that all that will be toast ( no pun with Toast ) with Leopard .	St
1.4.21	I admit to being just a bit of a reluctant upgrader ( though not a Luddite ) , but I 'm sure you can see that the prospect of throwing out so much of what I have ( some of it brand-new ) is dauntingnot only because of the expense but everything else .	St
1.4.22	Thanks again for the help on testing what is wrong .	St
1.4.23	I 'm hoping that there 's still something to add , and I wo n't do anything until I hear back from you or someone else .	St
1.4.24	Best , jenny	St
1.5.1	As the monitor performs in the same manner when the computer is booted from another system disk , we can rule out an OS problem .	St
1.5.2	Substitution is the next step .	St
1.5.3	Either you take the monitor to another computer and see what happens or you take the computer to another monitor .	St
1.5.4	Of course , bringing another monitor to the computer would be the easy way .	St
1.5.5	Bear in mind that these monitors are not platform specific .	St
1.5.6	If it has a vga connector , it will work on the G4 .	St
1.5.7	Nobody in your building has a monitor they could loan you for 15 mins or so ?	Ques
1.5.8	Ah the joys of living in the big city .	St
1.5.9	P	St
1.6.1	Not sure who has a monitor , but I think my next-door neighbor may have one .	St
1.6.2	She 's away , though , so I shall try asking some others I know .	St
1.6.3	( So many people , these days , have laptops only or all-in-ones , but there is bound to be someone , I 'm sure . )	St
1.6.4	Question from this technological babe in the wood is , if the problem is the graphics card , can that be replaced , or do I have to scrap the whole whatsit .	St
1.6.5	And are we talking about a card in the computer or the monitor [ & quot ; question mark & quot ; among other problems , my silly laptop has decided that it does n't want some of its righthand keys to work , woe is me ] Thanks again .	St
1.6.6	I 'll let you know what happens .	St
1.6.7	jenny	St
1.7.1	Good luck on that quest ; The card we are talking about is the one inside the G4 .	Polite
1.7.2	If you drop the side of the G4 you will see it in the brown slot .	St
1.7.3	If it is not in the brown slot , then you have a PCI card , and subsequently a G4 PCI Graphics .	St
1.7.4	We all believe yours to be a G4 AGP Graphics .	St
1.7.5	These AGP cards are still available , for a fee P	St
1.8.1	I finally found someone with a monitor to lend to me .	St
1.8.2	It took a few days for her to be able to release it to me , but when I hooked it up to my computer , everything went just fine .	St
1.8.3	Off very soon ( tomorrow , if I can manage it ) to buy a new monitor .	St
1.8.4	If there 's anything more wrong , I do n't know .	St
1.8.5	Right now I 'm just grateful to be able to take action so readily .	St
1.8.6	Thanks for all the help .	St
1.8.7	I 'm feeling much happier now .	St
1.8.8	Best , jenny	St
1.9.1	Hope all goes well and you are back to your full brilliance shortly .	St
1.9.2	P	St
1.10.1	Dear P , Got the monitor on Friday afternoon and set it up this morning ( Sunday ) .	St
1.10.2	It 's what I wanted and needed and then some .	St
1.10.3	I was tickled by your reference to my & quot ; full brilliance & quot ; being restoredthough I suspect that you meant the monitor , and not me , personally .	St
1.10.4	Whichever you meant , the good wishes are very welcome , and you gave me a welcome chuckle .	St
1.10.5	I am so grateful , once again , for your rapid , timely help , which led me in the right direction .	St
1.10.6	I hope that your white charger is n't too tired ; someone else may need you to come to the rescue .	St
1.10.7	Warmest thanks , Jenny	Polite
