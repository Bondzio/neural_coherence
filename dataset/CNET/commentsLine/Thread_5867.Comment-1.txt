i hope someone can help me make sense of this.
i seemingly lost four external hard drives within hours of eachother.
for simplicity, will limit the scenario to two for the moment: lacie #1 and lacie #2. initial event: lacie #1 external: i accidently used a different power supply adapter when trying to start lacie #1 external.
the one i used had slightly different amp output.
stupid mistake... the lacie #1 external power light flickered for just a moment, then went out.
the drive never spun up, nor made a sound.
result: lacie #1 external would not turn on.
*** i had an identical lacie external - lacie #2 - so i thought i might try using that to recover data from the failed lacie #1 drive.
*** secondary event: lacie #2 external i tested lacie #2 external with proper power adapter.
it powered up normally.
so i removed the hard drive from lacie #1 housing and installed it into lacie #2 housing.
then i tested lacie #2 external with proper power adapter.
lacie #2 light flickered, then went out.
why?
i assumed it failed to read drive #1, which must be corrupted.
so removed hard drive #1 from lacie #2 housing, and reinstalled drive #2 into it's original lacie #2 housing.
tested lacie #2 again, with proper power adapter.
now lacie #2 would not power up at all, where it just worked fine two steps ago.
final result: lacie #2 failure.
what happened here?
i understand how the initial event for lacie #1 could cause failure in both drive #1 and/or the lacie housing #1. but how could that lead to the second event failure in lacie #2?
is it possible that the bad drive from #1 somehow corrupted the lacie #2 housing power?
how is that possible?
and since drive #2 was outside of it's housing when the failure occurred in lacie #2, does that mean drive #2 is most likely healthy?
any advice is much appreciated.
