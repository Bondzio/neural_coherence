i highly agree about this--further reasons--the heating and cooling effect of turning on and off your computer can cause solder joints to &quot;dry out&quot; making them less conductive, and brittle.
this causes easy breakability, and overall unstability of your computer.
so it is definately worth the extra dollar a month to keep your computer running.
