No problem, thanks for the link to the article.
If you're still interested, look at this link http://www.pantherproducts.co.uk/Articles/CPU/CPU%20Temperatures.shtml .
Right down at the bottom of the page is a video showing what happens to Pentiums and AMDs when they overheat.
As for yours overheating, I think 56 is still a little too high but well within parameters.
as you say, if th boss isn't bothered then you've no reason to be.
