1.1.1	Hi all , I 'm looking for a little imput.I want a really good cpu cooler and just ca n't decide what to buy , money is not a problem.I just want a really good cooler.I 've looked at alot of coolers even one that the US government use 's but I 'm just not happy with what I 'm seeing , My tower is a coolermaster so size does n't matter , I 'll even mod the tower if needed.What I really want is looks and a cold system , I 'd go with liquid nitrogen but its just not good to look at.So any ideas , my system is Win7 64 bit 8 gig ram 1366 support for 16 gig CPU Amd black Phenom II x4 with 5 H/D 's total 5TB I 'm over clocked but just a little lol So anyone ! !
