1.1.1	I just purchased VoIP service and added their phone port router to my existing network .	St
1.1.2	Original router is wireless D-Link DI 624 802.11G router .	St
1.1.3	The VoIP phone router ( Linksys RT41P2-AT ) is hooked to the cable modem , then to the the wireless router .	St
1.1.4	The wireless D-Link router broadcasts wireless signal fine , but with it 's own static IP range , which is different than the Linksys phone router .	St
1.1.5	The wired/wireless pc 's ca n't talk to each other .	St
1.1.6	Also , the hardwire ports on the wireless wo n't work ( just broadcasts ) and I have tried an 8 port 3com hub from the phone router and that wo n't work either !	St
1.1.7	I was so glad to save money with the VoIP but this has mucked up my network .	St
1.1.8	I ca n't pass data between the wireless nodes and the wired .	St
1.1.9	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.10	P.S .	St
1.1.11	I can ping host pc from wireless and connect with Terminal Services but this does not help me with data transfers .	St
1.1.12	Please help !	St
1.1.13	Thanks , Linksys Phone router : 192.168.15.1 - All IP 's are 15.xxx D-Link 802.11G Wireless : 192.168.0.1 - All IP 's are 0.xxx	St
1.2.1	I 'm not sure about the VoIP equipment , but I think I would put the VoIp at the end of the line ( cable modem , then Wireless router , then VoIP router ) .	St
1.2.2	Secondly , you need to match the subnet ID 's on both routers , all 192.168.15.xxx OR 192.168.0.xxx .	St
1.2.3	If you have both 15 's and 0 's , there isn ' any way PC 's on separate routers to have two way sharing with you setup .	St
1.2.4	Example : the VoIP may 'see ' the wirelss PC 's , but not the other way .	St
1.2.5	Check out my answer for a similar problem at http : //home.comcast.net/~larbel1/ .	St
1.2.6	You may be able to come up with the solution for your problem .	St
1.2.7	The CNET forms would n't format my simple text drawing correctly , so I did it on my web page .	St
1.2.8	It will be up for some time .	St
1.2.9	Good luck .	Polite
1.2.10	LB	St
