question for the community - i'm looking for a black and white printer for my home.
but, i have to print many pages a day, so i'm trying to find a hard core printer that does automatic duplex, is fast and can print out many sheets on one cartridge (primarily text and some graphics).
i have an all in one color that's great for fax/scan/phots, but not for high volume black and white.
any suggestions would be appreciated!
