1.2.2	hmm i thought abs shipped restore CDs with their computers....maybe i'm mistaken accessing the bios varies from manufacturer...usually u push a button during post, f10, f8, control, delete, not sure...i would go with the function keys as most common	St
1.3.1	I messed around in the setup screen but I hope I didn't touch the BIOS.	St
1.3.2	I read in another post that I need to make the BIOS read my cd drive which I do not know how to do.	St
1.3.3	ABS did ship with a boot floppy, but that got damaged somehow.	St

1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	You stated that you get eight options in your setup menu.	St
1.7.2	Those options probably have SUBMENUS in them.	St
1.7.3	Use the arrow keys to navigate through the menus, use the Enter key to select a menu or option.	St
1.7.4	Sometimes you may have to use the plus or minus keys to move items up or down a list.	St
1.7.5	Look for something that says: startup disk startup order boot volume boot disk boot order etc.	St
1.8.1	and submenus.	St
1.8.2	I read that old systems might not be able to boot from the Windows OS cd.	St
1.8.3	I tried using the floppy to boot but I think that my floppy drive is defective.	St
1.8.4	My system tells me that there is a Pri HDD error, then it tells me to insert a floppy to boot.	St
1.8.5	I downloaded the correct Windows boot floopy download from Microsoft.com, transferred what I downloaded to floppies, inserted them in the floppy drive, and the drive won't read the floppies.	St
1.8.6	I really need step by step instructions on how to make my BIOS read the cd-rom drive.	St
1.9.1	Well, did you find anything in the BIOS like: startup disk startup order boot volume boot disk boot order Computer model name?	St
1.9.2	Motherboard model?	St
1.9.3	Make & model of HD?	St
1.9.4	Can you pop the drive into another system to wipe it clean or run a formatting utility from the drive mfg?	St
1.10.1	I got someone else telling me to change my BIOS sequence so it can read my cd-rom drive first.	St
1.10.2	I did that but the computer still wants me to insert a floppy to boot.	St
1.10.3	Is there any other information I should post about this situation?	Ques
1.11.1	You never stated what version of windows you are trying to install.	St
1.11.2	That is important.	St
1.11.3	95?	St
1.11.4	98?	St
1.11.5	ME, 2000?	St
1.11.6	XP Home?	St
1.11.7	XP Media Center?	St

1.11.10	Did the machine ship with Windows 98?	St
1.11.11	Has XP ever been successfully installed on the machine?	St
1.11.12	From what you have stated thus far, I have no idea.	St
1.12.1	I run Windows XP home.	St
1.12.2	I believe it came with 98 installed and another person upgraded the system to XP for me.	St
1.12.3	That person has moved elsewhere and I don't know where he lives.	St
1.12.4	My ABS did work with the XP and after it got infected with spyware, I didn't know what to do.	St

1.12.6	It was able to boot regularly but I couldn't use my usb mouse or my ps/2 mouse.	St
1.12.7	I played around in setup and my computer couldn't boot.	St
1.12.8	It kept saying Pri Slave HDD error and it keeps asking me to insert a floppy and this is where I am now.	St
1.13.1	Look at the make of the hard disk.	St
1.13.2	Now head to that maker's web site and get a DRIVE FITNESS TEST.	St
1.13.3	Also, open the box up with the power off and gently push all the cables into their sockets.	St
1.13.4	Then boot that drive fitness test CD or diskette to see if the hard disk passes.	St
1.13.5	Looks like a hardware issue so far.	St
1.13.6	Good thing everyone here makes a backup.	St
1.13.7	Bob	St
1.14.1	The hard drive is really old and I have 2 hard drives.	St
