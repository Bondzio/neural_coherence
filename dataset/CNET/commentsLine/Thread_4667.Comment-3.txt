and capability.
i'm pretty well pleased with my geforce 6200tc.
i just gave 47 dollars for it at newegg and am surprised how well it plays games.
but, of course, how well any card plays depends greatly on system specs.
a 5700 ultra is generally much costlier than the cards of the same number and if you are going to spend $120 to $160 or so, i certainly look at a geforce 6600gt.
