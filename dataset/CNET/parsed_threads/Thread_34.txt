<s> Hi Team, i have a problem with my 250GB Western digital Hard drive. </s>
<s> it detects at once but when i restart or shutdown my PC i will not be able to detect the Harddrive in BIOS. </s>
<s> This my 3rd Harddrive which i have replaced in 6months. </s>
<s> Please do help me. </s>
<s> Regards, Oliver </s>
<s> It maybe your environment or the case design. </s>
<s> The case design being its a poor on air circulation. </s>
<s> The HDs are prone to failure over time due to heat stress. </s>
<s> I have found 250gb likely to be effected by this. </s>
<s> Now, I don't know if its a bad HD design too, but many OEM systems were selling 250gbs installed -OR- low cost when offered for DIY'ers. </s>
<s> If another HD was later installed, literally into the next bay, it will cause the effects I mentioned. </s>
<s> If not and the cooling of the system is compromised, cause it also. </s>
<s> If the environment tends to be on the warm(it needn't be real hot) side the wear&tear will be the downfall of any HD as cooling isn't enough and the overall &quot;ambient&quot; temps aren't good. </s>
<s> If you haven't already, replace the HD cables and reseat the power connection as well several times. </s>
<s> Its always nice to know what were dealing with. </s>
<s> What system, options, usage, etc.. tada -----Willy </s>
