While I could not find a review of either display, I did find product page for the 19&quot; model on their Canadian website... click here .
It is also primarily sold in Canadian stores, though Best Buy is debuting it here in the states.
The 17&quot; is from the same product line, so the information likely holds true for it as well.
Aside from that, I can tell you that they are both new models, with product pages being created about a month ago, and both have been certified to handle Windows Vista.
Thus, it may be a little while before full reviews and users opinions are available.
Overall LG tends to hover around a 6/10 when it comes to LCD monitors and televisions reviewed by the Cnet editors.
One thing you may consider doing is visiting a local Best buy or other electronics store and viewing it for yourself...the sales associates usually have display models they can plug in for you to look at.
I haven't noticed a drop in quality with 19&quot; LCDs, but if there is you'll be able to spot it before you buy.
Hope this helps, John
