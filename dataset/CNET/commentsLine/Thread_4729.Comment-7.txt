my residence is fairly new and they wired it to accomodate dual dsl.
of course i would be nuts to go for that!
but the story i was told at a trade show was they wanted to have the capability for one (dsl) line to supply tv channels and the other is your internet.
hope this sheds some light on what these companies are chasing after.
