&quot;few problems with not being able to open any programs, right click, etc.
unless i restart the computer.&quot; these issues are not uncommon with windows.
today's pests invade and damage the os causing such troubles.
it won't matter what machine you have so its best to learn how to deal with such damage or learn how to reinstall the os back to some working condition.
again, a new machine of any windows os could have this situation repeat with regularity unless you figure out what protection was left out or what action (such as p2p use) was letting the pest do it's dirty.
