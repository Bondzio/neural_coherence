<s> I currently have a Linksys B router. </s>
<s> I have a Linksys wireless G laptop card. </s>
<s> My speed, range and connectivity are very low (12%). </s>
<s> I was wondering if upgrading my router would help with this issue? </s>
<s> Which should I upgrade to - Wireless G or the newer Wireless N? </s>
<s> Should I stay with Linksys since that is what the laptop card is? </s>
<s> I noticed that Linksys has WRT54GT, WRT54G and WRT54GS. </s>
<s> Is one better than the other? </s>
<s> Thanks so much. </s>
<s> It is really hard to get this info. </s>
<s> an upgrade to a G router is the least costly option. </s>
<s> Matching your present network card will give you the most bang for the buck. </s>
<s> An N router will also require an N adapter to see any speed increase. </s>
<s> I replaced my chip set Ethernet Adapter with a wired Ethernet Card and the speed increase was very good, exceeding a second Giga bit of RAM that was installed. </s>
<s> You might consider this rather then the router replacement. </s>
<s> The card was a 10/100/1000 with a GB of memory. </s>
