No, I haven't used the Logitech drivers, it was a mouse I received from a friend after my last mouse stopped working consistently (I think it had a short in the wire).
I just shut the computer down, plugged the mouse in, and turned the computer on.
I can't remember, but I think the first time, or first couple times, the mouse may have worked in Windows ... though maybe not.
Aside from Logitech drivers, any other suggestions?
