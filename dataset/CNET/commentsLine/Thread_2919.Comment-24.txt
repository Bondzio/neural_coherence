yes it has happened to me 6 months back.
bought a recovery cd from spotmau.
intially the downloaded version did not work for soe reason.
i asked for money to be returned back and in the meantime recieved the original copy of the cd which i tried and to my surprise it worked.
i mailed them back and told them that i would be keeping the cd.
i am not sure how much it costs- probably around 30.
