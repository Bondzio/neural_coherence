integrated graphics cards are fine for surfing the internet or just doing casual computing, however if you will be doing heavy graphics work with images or if you will be working with cad or such you should definitely consider purchasing a higher grade graphics card.
also if you are an avid gamer you will probably want a separate graphics card with at least 128 gb of memory so that your game will flow smoother, which will make playing it a lot more enjoyable.
