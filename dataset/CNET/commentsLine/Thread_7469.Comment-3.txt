the html problem with these forums is that it can't do it well except for smileys.....since : ) together or : &gt; together or : \ is simple html for smileys, that's what you end up with so if you are going to type c: &gt; or c: ) or c: \ and normally wouldn't put in the space, just type c: or c: prompt instead and we'll get the picture.
most of us forget that the html coding here is crapped out so if you see an inadvertent smiley assume it is actually : ) or : &gt; : \ instead.
ok.....on to the next problem.
are you saying that the software has already been installed and that you now want the end product to be sent/stored on the f: drive?
if so, look in the settings/configurations of the program itself to direct it to a specific folder you create on the f: drive ahead of time (usually it will say something like destination or store location....with the c: \ in front of the default folder setting so you can create a new folder with the same name but change the drive to f: \ instead.
the reason both drives are marked as primary partition is because when the drives were created by the it, he didn't make the new one just an extended partition with a logical drive instead that extended partition.
this way, you could always just install xp or another operating system on it and it would be ready to be a bootable drive....whereas extended partitions would have to be completely redone to be bootable.
