i worked on honeywell mainframes from 1968, h800, h1800, h8200 , but my first pc was something called a &quot;superbrain&quot;.
have no idea who built it.
you pushed 7&quot; floppy discs vertically into a drive beside the screen and the keyboard was attached.....used to take ages to &quot;update&quot; your spreadsheet every time you made a new entry, so there was an option to not update the spreadsheet until you had finished all your new entries.
