you can use the junction command to effectively relocate any directory on one drive to any directory on a different drive.
for example you want to keep your music on a different drive.
say the normal path might be c:\users\whomever\music and you want to actually store your music on a drive assigned letter m. simply follow these steps... go to drive m with m: cd \ mkdir music then run the following command junction c:\users\whomever\music m:\music now copy your music to m:\music whenever an application including windows itself looks at c:\users\whomever\music it will look at m:\music and it will be transparent that the data physically resides somewhere else.
dir c:\users\whomever\music\*.
* returns the same as dir m:\music\*.
* here is the hepl usage verbiage.
