out of curiosity, what hsf did your 4400+ come with?
the newer ones are being shipped with the hsf that come with the opteron processors - they're a 4 copper heatpipe design and there's an amd hologram logo/sticker on the top of the fan.
those are quite good for a stock hsf (i was using one with my opteron 170) and you'd probably have to spend close to 50 bucks to exceed it's performance.
if you have that, try re-seating it as vapcmd said, with special care not to put on too much or too little as5.
if you don't have that hsf, i wholeheartedly recommend the zalman cpns9500 .
with room temps in the same range as yours, 100% load (running 2 instances of fold@home) and my opteron overclocked to 270, my temps hover between 47 - 52 degrees c. idle, we're talking about 32. the link provided happens to be newegg, but if you look around, you may be able to get it for around 50 shipped.
