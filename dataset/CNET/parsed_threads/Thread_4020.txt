<s> I just got the following DFI Lanparty UT nF4 Ultra-D AMD Athlon64 X2 3800+ 2GB OCZ RAM 250 Seagate SATA with NCQ eVGA GeForce 6600GT I am hoping this will last a good 5 years I also have a question about working with High Definition Video The minimum requirements for working with 1080i in Pinnacle Liquid Edition say it requires a 256MB Video Card. </s>
<s> Will my 6600GT be able to handle it? </s>
<s> or will I have to upgrade it? </s>
<s> and wait till amd dual cores become cheap that way u can get the 4400+ instead </s>
<s> the CPU is non-refundable but I could upgrade the card later on... but would the 6600GT be able to handle 1080i? </s>
<s> I'm just wondering if the Pinnacle requirements were exaggerated in any way. </s>
<s> Also, I've put together all my parts now, but I'm not sure what to do next. </s>
<s> Is it time to install Windows? </s>
<s> If so, do I just pop the CD in? </s>
<s> am I supposed to use CHS or large? </s>
