Hi all, Having recently discovered some pretty awesome games for my PC, it has become clear that my 'on board' graphics card is not up to the job! I've looked at several review sites to help decide which graphics card to purchase and discovered that there are two main competitors - Radeon VS Nvidia. I would be interested to hear anyones personal experiences with either of these makes and I would welcome any advice in helping me choose a card (ideally suited to gaming - Americas Army for example). Many thanks, Robin

I'm currently running a Radeon 9200 SE and it seems to not do as well compared to my older Nvidia cards. You also want to see what your connectivity is...if you're running an off the shelf system, you might be limited on what you can upgrade. You'll want to have at least an 8x AGP slot if you're going to be playing graphically intensive games. Whatever you do, don't get a regular PCI video card...I got one for my old Compaq (since I didn't have AGP) and it was a waste. It played old games well, but newer ones crashed it bad. For my next PC I'm gonna be building after christmas, I'm looking at either the GeForce 7800 GT or GeForce 7800 GTX...they're pricey, but from what I hear they're kick-ass cards and I work at CompUSA, so I get a good discount
