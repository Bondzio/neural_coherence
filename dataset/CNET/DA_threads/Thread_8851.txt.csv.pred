1.3.1	Unpopular or outdated devices may not get the new drivers for a new OS , if not never but later , much later .	St
1.3.2	Why ?	Ques
1.3.3	Because that is the time for manufacturers can sell newly released models not only supporting the new OS but may have better or updated features .	St
1.3.4	Vista does offer & quot ; native support & quot ; but is generic or basic but at least it works and does n't totally abandon the old device .	St

1.4.1	The Epson web site contains information on the availability of Vista updates for Epson scanners .	St
1.4.2	You have a good chance of finding Twain drivers and the Epson Scan Utilities .	St
1.4.3	However , you will probably not find Vista updates for the Control Panel .	St
1.4.4	I believe this provides the functionality you are looking for .	St

1.5.1	I have a Perfection 1650 .	St
1.5.2	Epson does have a bare bones twain update , but as far as I can tell so far - it does nothing whatsoever .	St

1.6.1	We have been trying to get Epson twain drivers for vista & or Vista 64 for our Perfection 1200u photo scanner.. thay say they 're not supporting this model in Vista ! !	St
1.6.2	They are probably hoping to sell more scanners as people upgrade to vista ... What they are doing is ruining customer confidence in their product line ! !	St
1.6.3	If we ca n't get this scanner some support , , , why should I or any of you want to buy their printers or scanners ! !	St

1.7.1	The one thing you 'll find is that most 5 year old devices are going to fail in this regard .	St

1.7.3	But you can cut the cost .	St
1.7.4	Sell yours and get a new one .	St
