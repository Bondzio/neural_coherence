1.1.1	Hi there , I 'm getting a strange sound from my CPU and it seems to becoming more frequent .	St
1.1.2	I 'll give my system info and then try and describe the sound .	St
1.1.3	Hp Pavillion 754n , 2.53GHz Pentium 4 , 1GB DDR SDRAM , 80GB Ultra DMA Hard Drive , 200GB Maxtor One Touch External Hard Drive , DVD+RW/CD-RW Drive , CD-ROM , HP PhotoSmart 7350 Printer , Epson Perfection 2580 Photo Scanner .	St
1.1.4	I have Windows XP Home-SP2 as my OS .	St
1.1.5	I regularly run Spybot S & D , Ad-Aware Personal , RegCleaner and eTrust-EZAntivirus .	St
1.1.6	The sound is like that of a VCR rewinding , very high pitched .	St
1.1.7	It sounds like it 's out of control.My mouse freezes and the only way to shut down is to push the power button , ( I hate doing that ) I 'll reboot and it runs fine .	St
1.1.8	For a while .	St
1.1.9	It 's probally happened about 5-6 times in the past few months .	St
1.1.10	But twice in the past week .	St
1.1.11	The last time it happened ( last night ) a blue screen appeared when I rebooted saying that it has to do a system check or disk check , something like that .	St
1.1.12	Sorry I ca n't be more specific with it .	St
1.1.13	It did a scan , said all was ok then it continued to reboot .	St
1.1.14	I 'm a little concerned and I hoping it is n't anything really serious .	St
1.1.15	Any advice would be appreciated big time .	Polite
1.1.16	Gary ,	St
1.2.1	hard drives dont last forever and it seems like urs is reaching its end ... however i may be wrong and it may be something else ... see what other ppl post .	St
1.2.2	could be something stuck in a fan and causing overheat ... again see what other ppl may say	St
1.3.1	Open the case & see if you can pinpoint the location of the sound .	St
1.3.2	If the cooling fan goes bad lots of bad things can happen .	St
1.3.3	Operate the PC without the side panel or cover .	St
1.3.4	When you hear the sound , manually stop the fan mounted on the processor for a split second to see if the sound goes away ( should be a 3 & quot ; square on the motherboard on top of an aluminum radiator ) .	St
1.3.5	If that 's not it , look to the power supply cooler or chassis fan ( s ) .	St
1.3.6	A good prophylactic measure is to clean out your fans w/ canned air , but use short , half-second bursts .	St
1.3.7	And do this outside .	St
1.3.8	I have this exact rig and the proc .	St
1.3.9	fan was WAY too loud , I swapped it out for a noiseless Zalman Flower Cooler and I run it at its noiseless setting , very happy .	St
1.3.10	If you have any on-board diagnostics ( SMART , temp probe etc ) run them .	St
1.3.11	Could also be HDD going bad , back up like a maniac !	St
1.3.12	Good luck !	Polite
1.3.13	Tony	St
1.4.1	Is two years considered old for a Hard Drive or Processor ?	Ques
1.4.2	I can see where a fan might wear out or begin to , but a Hard Drive ?	Ques
1.4.3	Anyway , I 'll take your advice and try and get an exact location of the sound .	St
1.4.4	By the way , if it happens to be the HD or the Pocessor , I 'm gon na be back here needing help installing the new one .	St
1.4.5	Is it hard to transfer everything from one Hard Drive to a new one ?	Ques
1.4.6	Is hard to install a new Processor ?	Ques
1.4.7	Just thinking out loud .	St
1.4.8	Gary ,	St
1.5.1	You really need to open case and check those fans .	St
1.5.2	Any fan when it fails cause less & quot ; ait circualation & quot ; and thus more heat build-up .	St
1.5.3	If allowed to continue whatever it was trying to cool will become stressed and at least become flaky or start to fail itself .	St
1.5.4	Thus , a case fan cause & quot ; a ; ; & quot ; componets to be stressed and a cpu fan a more direct reslut for cpu shutdown or similar as the system bios will kick-in its safety temp feature ( hi-temp ) and sgutdown or reboot .	St
1.5.5	Seriously , check the fans .	Sug
1.5.6	An & quot ; iffy & quot ; fan is stop & go or not fully free to move is n't worth saving , just replace , ASAP .	St
1.5.7	Rememeber , that a case fan if not working 100 % may cause the HD to be over heated and sooner or later will fail or become corrupted .	St
1.5.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	I took the cover off my computer and was just checking it out before I shut it down for dusting .	St
1.6.2	( It definitely needed to be dusted . )	St
1.6.3	I heard a bit of a winding/squeaking sound coming from one of the fans on the back , I believe this is the case fan .	St
1.6.4	I have another fan next to it but that has a duct that leads to the top the large heat sink .	St
1.6.5	I moved the case around to get a better look and then the high pitched/winding sound started .	St
1.6.6	I tapped on the fan and it stopped .	St
1.6.7	Looks like I need a new fan .	St
1.6.8	Should I replace the other one too ?	Ques
1.6.9	Also , any suggestions on a brand of fan I should buy ?	Ques
1.6.10	I would like to get the best one for preformance and durability .	St
1.6.11	Gary .	St
1.7.1	are my favorites , might as well get the quietest one you can : www.endpcnoise.com has lots of good choices , but not the cheapest .	St
1.8.1	You can order online , but I prefer locally as I get it now and install it and quality is pretty good .	St
1.8.2	Depending on your locale , Besy Buy , Fry 's , and/or Circuit City should carry fans and gosh , RadioShaft .	St
1.8.3	Buy a & quot ; ball bearing or magnetic type & quot ; fan , avoid any & quot ; sleeve bearing & quot ; , brand is up to you .	St
1.8.4	Google for online source , I beleive FrozenCPU and NewEgg are decent vendors .	St
1.8.5	happy USA -- -- -Willy	St
