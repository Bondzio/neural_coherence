on the issues of power supplies.all i've seen on these forums for months now was to get a system with a power supply 400w or more.now i see this system with the athlon 64 has a 250w and suppose to be good.also see many ads.
on net with systems only going as high as 300w.what gives,do newer systems now require less power.
