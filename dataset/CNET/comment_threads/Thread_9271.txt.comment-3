Thanks Bob.
Yes it appears to address running the Portal Capture from the Router only and even has one recommended model, the Linksys WRT54G at http://dev.wifidog.org/wiki/doc/install/openwrt which will require basic operating knowledge of Unix and compiling OpenWRT source code into Binary Files.
Not having some of this training will create some challenge for me but Im up to the task.
For anyone interested in this topic of Capture Portal but doesnt want the additional challenges, they can use the &quot;Port Forwarding&quot; and DMZ functions available in most routers and run authentication from a dedicated PC.
