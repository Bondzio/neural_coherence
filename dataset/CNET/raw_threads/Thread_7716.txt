(The one it came with was supposed to be 1000 but I've printed three 5% test pages, estimated remaining is 697). Cartridge replacements ('up to 1500') are roughly $65. After buying the HP, I found a Samsung ML-2010 for the same price. It's faster (22ppm vs 17), and has more memory (8 vs 2). The page yield is 3000 and the stock cartridge is around $95. The main thing right now is that I know I can find a generic 3000-yield Samsung for $25, but I can't find a generic one at all for the HP P1005/1006. I'm not sure if that's because it's too new or a bit oddball (or both). Anybody know anything about that? Will there be generics available for the HP anytime soon, and/or does HP have any restrictive technology or policies? I don't care THAT much about the speed difference, I don't know what the memory difference will mean, but if the cost per page difference is substantial, I may be convinced to go through the very painful process of packing up the HP, returning it, and travelling across town to get the Samsung.
