Hey.....ok i got a pretty newish computer (bout a month/two months old) its a iMedia M221 (Packard Bell) and all of a sudden has decided not to recognize my monitor!!!
tried plugging an old monitor into it and wouldnt work either.
I have been told that my video card may be out of place or not plugged in, but after looking into the computer nothing seems to be wrong.
Could this be a driver problem?
A virus problem??
Please help i need the computer for work and son needs it for school (typing this from a damn library computer....) Cheers in advance
