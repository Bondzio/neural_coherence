<s> I just swapped out my old motherboard because its chipset was damaged when its cooling fan failed. </s>
<s> The board had 4 IDE channels so I put ea device on its own channel (2 CD drives, 2 hard drives) This board only has two IDE channels and each channel can support 2 devices for a total of four. </s>
<s> Problem: I can only access three of the four devices 2 CD drives and 1 HD. </s>
<s> I can see the all 4 drives in POST I can see all 4 in Windows system utilies and hardware profiler but I can't access the second hard drive or get any information to or from it. </s>
<s> I had to wipe the first one clean to get anything to work, neither would boot because Windows was installed on them but tied to the old motherboard. </s>
<s> Windows can see the hard drive but I can't access any info from it. </s>
<s> Whats the deal here? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
