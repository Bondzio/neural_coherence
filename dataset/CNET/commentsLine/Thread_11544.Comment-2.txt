it's quite possible to copy the entire drive from the 10 gig to the 20 with ghost or other such software.
as such, all data is intact.
however, xp will not startup on the new hardware.
you will need the original installation cd and will need to perform a &quot;repair&quot; installation.
you will also need the product id code and will be required to reactivate windows.
it's possible that xp will know much of your hardware but probably not all of it.
gather all the drivers first.
this would also be a good time to visit the web sites of all your hardware manufacturers and get the latest drivers.
definately get the latest bios for the mb while you're at it.
good luck.
