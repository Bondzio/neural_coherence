the reading i did mentioned having trouble with heatsink clearence with some gpus, and the standard psus for the opti are 300watt, which may not be enough for some higher-end gpus (which seems like it's going to be overkill for me) and to put in a bigger psu means messing around with rewiring the mobo connectors...  i don't mind popping the case open to swap a few parts down the road if my needs change, but want as few hassels as possible.
