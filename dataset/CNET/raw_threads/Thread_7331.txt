From my unscientific observation, it seem to me it is as fast as my eSATA Hdd...it might even be slightly faster. I transferred 3.8Gb video as a test and it took about 3 minutes, and my eSATA takes about 4 minutes. Oh the USB3 case is connected to the USB2 port of the computer only. I didn't have a USB3 port to connect it to (another story for later).

The eSATA transfer took about 21.5 seconds and the USB 2 was about a minute and a half. Your 3.8 gig file is roughly 1/2 again as large as the one I used so my transfer of your file on my system would be roughly 33 seconds to the eSATA and 2 1/2 minutes to the USB2.

I was really looking to see if just the usb3 case alone would make a difference as I have experienced. My usb2 transfer rate usually ran about 2 minute per GB. It's a turtle compare to what you have.

Your USB connection seems to be more consistent with my USB 2. In a sense, that might answer your own question. You are operating at USB 2 functionality but your eSATA is messed up. It should be much faster. I wonder if you don't suffer from that Intel matrix storage manager issue.
