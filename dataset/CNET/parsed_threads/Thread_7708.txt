<s> I'm selling my old computer to try and get what meager cash I can recover before I buy my new one. </s>
<s> With rampant identity theft and general insecurity abound these days I would very much like to do a disk wipe before I take my system to the store. </s>
<s> Although the nice man said he would do one for me I would rather do it myself if you know what I mean. </s>
<s> Anyway, since this is the first time I have done this I was wondering if anyone would recommend a disk wipe utility (price is irrelivant this is important stuff) that is reliable and thorough. </s>
<s> Any other thoughts to consider or general information/horror stories you could help me avoid would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, Jim </s>

<s> As the other poster listed, get KILLDISK from thier website. </s>
<s> http://www.killdisk.com Use the &quot;free&quot; floppy or .ISO version to burn to CD. </s>
<s> Once done, use it and it does 1 pass removal, run again as a final pass(you have to reload it again) and you're done. </s>
<s> You can reformat before its usage if you care to but not required. </s>
<s> Read thier webpage info, its interesting if anything and it does the job, simple and easy, no thoughts about it. </s>
