<s> PC has the floppy drive cable also going to the tape drive. </s>
<s> Tape drive is not recognized by OS. </s>
<s> How does the set-up configuration have to be set to have the tape drive work? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You'll have some diskettes or CD that came with said drive and you'll have to use an OS that was supported by said software. </s>
<s> Be aware that my memory is fuzzy on this old drive but the only reason to resurrect it is to get some old data from tapes and not to use it for backup. </s>
<s> But that's your choice here. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> I think some versions of Linux support this drive without a driver hunt. </s>
<s> Since this machine was bought from a school surplus sale, there is nothing other than the hardware itself. </s>
<s> I am giving it to a child for Xmas, he won't need the drive. </s>
<s> I will either remove it or disconnect it. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The driver for the T3000 should be at HP support website or simply google away for it. </s>
<s> http://www.driversguide.com has been my driver website of choice. </s>
<s> You may need to register but everything is free to d/l. </s>
<s> I had a similar tape drive, maybe it was T3000 or T5000 but gave-up after it took soooooo long to back-up. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
