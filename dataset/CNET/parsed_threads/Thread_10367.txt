<s> Which would you suggest if being used on a gaming build? </s>
<s> What the motherboard maker recommends. </s>

<s> Bob </s>
<s> Motherboard is ASUS P7P55D-E Pro http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131621 . </s>
<s> The price between them is too small to matter. </s>
<s> I need someone experienced to suggest which one to use, I will be using it for a long time. </s>
<s> For your motherboard model, they will have a qualified vendor list including many RAM manufacturers and model #s depending on your needs. </s>
<s> One need is will be CPU speed that should be properly matched. </s>
<s> CPU is i5 750, OS is WIn7 home premium 64-bit. </s>
<s> Really, someone experienced just suggest one of the two. </s>
<s> but using a period in the title is also an annoyance. </s>
<s> So, you're looking for someone experienced but you didn't say in what way. </s>
<s> Do you need to find someone with that motherboard who has tried both models of that RAM to make a recommendation? </s>
<s> You'll wait a very long time then and, if that's true, my experience won't. </s>
<s> My only experience is that I have an Asus P755D series board and I did use the qualified vendor listing to help me select my compatible RAM and what I bought has worked wonderfully well. </s>
<s> That's the best I can offer. </s>
<s> Good luck finding an acceptable response. </s>
<s> All I want is someone knowledgeable to recommend one of the RAMs, I want to make sure I get the better. </s>
<s> I don't know why it's so hard to get such a simple reply. </s>
<s> maybe you're just in the wrong forums. </s>
<s> You asked generically about gaming but gave no details as to what your goal is. </s>
<s> If you look at the specs for each module type, you'll note that one says &quot;eco&quot; and this is just a cute word for eco-friendly which is a phony marketing &quot;come on&quot;, IMO. </s>
<s> Hopefully this link won't violate forum policy as nothing of this type of discussion is specifically offered here. </s>
<s> overclockers and g skill eco RAM You might try posting your question in a forum of this type. </s>
<s> Personally, I think you've already received the best advice about finding compatible components but apparently that's not your quest. </s>
<s> both sticks have the same timings and will perform the same. </s>
<s> but the eco only requires 1.35v to meet it's timings. </s>
<s> if you plan on overclocking, the rip jaws would be the better choice since their higher voltage will tolerate OC'ing. </s>
