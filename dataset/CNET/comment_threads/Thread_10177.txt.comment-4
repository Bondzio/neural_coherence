Nothing I do will keep this error message from appearing.
The cable's plugged in correctly (blue plug into the MB).
Both drives were set to cable select.
I even changed the last one to SLAVE and it made no difference.
Also can't find much on the Internet to address this except that many people seem to be experiencing this.
Any other ideas?
