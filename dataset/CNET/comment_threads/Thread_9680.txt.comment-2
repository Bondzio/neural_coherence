Hey, you got a spare grand laying around, I'd wait.
As FX-60 is coming out soon, Januaryish, as is the higher X2's.
All, in all: The FX-57 will almost always win with the games, AT THE MOMENT.
I assume multi-threaded games will be out, or at least a few before the of 2006.
I've been browing around AMDZONE and they are saying that an overclocked X2 could easily be better than their single-core counterparts.
Again, I'd wait in January for the new processors..... Look for some benchmarks then, and take your pick.
You may need a few more dollars though, as they are saying the price may be over 1k.
