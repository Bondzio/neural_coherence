and experience.
it's infinitely better to determine that the problem is the cpu temp by installing free software and checking the temps than pulling the hs fan and applying the tp only to find that wasn't the problem to begin with.
too many cases where mbs or cpus are damaged during removal or reinstallation the cpu and hsfan.
i'd rather see him/her replace a dead fan (on a hs) vice pulling the hs fan and just reapplying new tp...especially if thermal paste/compound was aok to begin with.
some might describe this as the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' philosophy.
