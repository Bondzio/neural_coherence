<s> Even today you see more electronic delivery (the web.) </s>
<s> These devices are for those that need them. </s>
<s> I do not necessarily think that all files can be transmitted via web for all scenarios which is why cd/dvd duping is out and usb drive duplicating is hot. </s>
<s> There is a product out on the market now from Hamilton Electronics called the USB duplicator express which allows you to copy and pull from 15 targets at once which is a huge time save and is a standalone device. </s>
<s> You can read more about it and purchase it from www.AlltecStores.com at this link: http://www.alltecstores.com/store/p/35945-USB-Transfer-Express.html </s>
<s> A recent purchase had them delivery a 4 GB download at the office. </s>
<s> Since it arrived in under a hour wouldn't your product be obsolete in today's world? </s>
