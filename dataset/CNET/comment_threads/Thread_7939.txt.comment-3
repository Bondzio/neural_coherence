Now that is crazy.
I haven't had to do restore for a very long time.
Went to System Restore and to click on a restore date.
There are no dates showing.
The &quot;calendar&quot; is blank.
As for the drivers I only checked to see if they were all up to date and they were.
What would cause this issue with system restore?
Going to check the BIOS settings now.
