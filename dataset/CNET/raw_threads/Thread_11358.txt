Can this be done, and if so, how this can be installed?

Next, install either OS on the port with only one drive attached. Then, detach that drive, attach the other and install the other OS. Reattach the first drive. Your BIOS should allow the option to select which drive to boot from. Pick either and boot the system. It will now detect the presence of the other drive and configure it. Shutdown and restart selecting the other drive in the BIOS. The same should happen when this OS loads. It will detect the presence of the other drive. Once you're happy that all is running well, activate OSs. You'll need to interrupt the POST each time you want to switch disks to boot from. It should be possible to edit the boot.ini of a preferred OS to allow selection of the other but I prefer this method as I keep the two drives completely separate.

Other methods exist, too, that will let you choose which system to boot either by mouse-click or key press. The idea is you install one OS. Install the boot manager. Install the other OS on its partition or hard drive. Naturally for each OS you'll have to do the usual bit of tweaking and chasing down drivers. But it's basically only a bit more complicated than building two separate computers, but much more efficient on desk space.

But it maybe the only way of getting 2 separate drives to boot independently. But using a bootdisk? I have my doubt.

What if I have an existing computer with Windows 98, can I take that hard drive and put it in a new computer running Vista and then select which OS I want by choosing the boot order in the bios?

Now I would like to install a a new 1Tb SATA HDD in the system with windows 7 on it. Some of the software installed in the system works only with Windows XP so I want to retain it whereas my kids want windows 7 on the PC as operating system. Suggest how to install the OS on two different HDD. The system is already running on Windows Xp with HDD of 250 gb and three partition c, d, e. Now I plant to install a new HDD with windows 7 and would like to have the option of choosing the OS. I want to have 100Gb for installation and rest of the portion for saving files on my new 1 Tb HDD. Is it possible to merge the d and e drives on my 250 Gb HDD after transferring the files to 1 TB HDD. Please suggest the method of installation.

Be aware that you can add a second drive and install Windows 7 then get a boot menu but before you do this let's hope you have a backup image of the HDD just in case you answer an install question wrong.
