for the Nvidia GeForce 6600GT either in PCIe or AGP versions and you will see it needs more than a 250W power supply.
Also in AGP versions of the 6600GT they normally furnish a cable to connect additional power to the power supply.
I just bought and installed a new 420W power supply in my PC with thoughts of a 6600GT AGP card pretty soon.
Don't have a Dell, but Toni H. is right on....some Dell's especially the old ones need special Power Supply and also special fitting, and some don't.
