I have a Logitech V470 and the batteries last from 3 to 6 months.
Rechargeables would have me futzing with charging rather than just using the device.
HOWEVER blue tooth mice have all exhibited an annoying trait that you have to wiggle them to get them to connect up and get going.
That snoozing may save battery power but I'll take the v450 NANO models any day since the NANO receiver is quite small and I don't have that lag, wake up wake UP annoyance.
