1.2.1	I too have an Emachine .	St
1.2.2	Here 's what I 've learned : 1 .	St
1.2.3	The T-series Emachines case is an odd size .	St
1.2.4	& quot ; Generally & quot ; , a regular ATX power supply will fit .	St
1.2.5	So look for just ATX .	St
1.2.6	The best thing to do is take some meaurements .	St
1.2.7	2 .	St
1.2.8	I purchased a Rosewill 450watt with a 120mm fan from Newegg awhile back .	St
1.2.9	The larger fan moves the air alittle better .	St
1.2.10	So , an 80mm or 120mm fan will work .	St
1.2.11	Does n't matter .	St
1.2.12	3 .	St
1.2.13	Other thing , I noticed you were looking at a very popular Thermaltake powersupply .	St
1.2.14	This powersupply is alittle longer than most ATX power supplies and may not fit in your case .	St
1.2.15	I barely had clearance for my Rosewill when I installed it .	St
1.2.16	So the best thing to do is to take some meaurements .	St
1.2.17	Chances are an ATX powersupply will be alittle longer than you stock Emachine unit , and the Thermaltake will be even longer than that .	St
1.2.18	4 .	St
1.2.19	You may notice there are different pin types , either 20 or 24 pins .	St
1.2.20	This is the connection that connects to your motherboard .	St
1.2.21	Most newer powersupplies will connect to both .	St
1.2.22	These feature a 4 pin section that will detach from the connector , making it a 20 pin .	St
1.2.23	So either way you 're covered .	St
1.2.24	5 .	St
1.2.25	Powersupplies will include connections for IDE and SATA drives .	St
1.2.26	Some are only IDE , however rarely do you find those that are just SATA .	St
1.2.27	6 .	St
1.2.28	If your buying a cheaper brand powersupply , like mine , do yourself a favor and buy a unit with more wattage than you need .	St
1.2.29	Most of these powersupplies are not making any where near the advertised power and ALL will deteriorate over time .	St
1.2.30	I 'd say buy an extra 100-200 watts of power , just for some headroom .	St
1.2.31	7 .	St
1.2.32	Also another note on the cheapo supplies .	St
1.2.33	If you plan on using a power hungry Video card , make sure you buy 1 with a 12v rail and check the Amps on the rail to the specifications of the vid card .	St
1.2.34	That 's about all .	St
1.3.1	clear , crisp , and concise .	St
1.3.2	brevity is genius .	St
