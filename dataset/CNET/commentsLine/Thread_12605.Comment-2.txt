there are 3 limits here; - the hard disk itself (it must be a 2&quot; inch one) - the bios (depends on the model of dell) - the os without knowing details on the machine, we don't know the limits of the bios.
dell does, but maybe you can tell us?
to clone the drive, you'll need some place that has access to both drives.
and that won't be your laptop if that has only one drive.
the best thing to do: use the cloning software that comes with your new drive and mount it in an external enclosure to do the cloning.
hope this helps.
