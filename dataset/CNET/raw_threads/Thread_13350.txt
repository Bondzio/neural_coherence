I am currently running a Pentium 4 3.0C and I was wondering if the new Pentium 4 3.4 GHz Extreme Edition (with HT) are good for gaming. I researched online a bit and I got alot of no's and some people said yes. However they do not have 64-bit support. I was wondering if it would be best for me to get the P4 3.8 GHz (w/ HT) because that has 64-bit support. I am not really sure on what kind of difference that would make... However, I do not plan to upgrade again for several years and I guess some programs will be in 64-bit by then? Also, If I plan to get the 3.8 GHz HT with the Windows XP Pro x64 Edition how much of a difference with performance will I see than just the regular Professional. Also keep in mind that I am using my computer to play highend video games and do some light picture editting and the rest just being typing and surfing the web. I plan to use the CPU with the specs found here - http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=108554&messageID=1236478

11723	3	108577	1236712	1236705	Scott847	6/10/05 9:10 PM	1.1184378E12	Actually...	If you read my second post, there is a version of the 3.8 that is 64-bit. But yes, my mobo doesnt support that. Should I just stick with the 3.8 ghz for now? I want to know what Intel CPU would be BEST for gaming, not what one not to get.

Could I still run this on a mobo that doesnt have x64 support?

The only problem is that it uses EM64T and my Mobo does support that but I do not have any programs that use x64. I want that speed and stuff but is it possible to turn off the x64 in bios or something? I still just want to use Windows Pro and not that special version.

The mobo I listed - http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16813131534#DetailSpecs must support x64 because on new egg it shows one of the combos being a CPU that is x64 and if it doesnt support x64 then there is a way to disable it. PLEASE stop being so vague it is VERY annoying. I can not listen to what your trying to say with only a subject title.

You created a paradox MORON! Not possible to turn off em64t. iF motherboard doesn't support, then the processor will be unusable. My suggestion get the bios update for the motherboard if possible from the manufacturer's website so you can ENABLE it and get the processor. Roger
