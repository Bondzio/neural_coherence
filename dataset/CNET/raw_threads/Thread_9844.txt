I find out after I got home that not only is it not windows 7 certified but its not certified for xbox either. It seems to be working better than the old router on the laptop but when I test my 360 connection I get a moderate NAT warning. I have followed all the steps listed on the xbox support. I have forwarded port, set xbox as the DMz. I don't know what else to do. The connection seems to be some better but I can't get the NAT changed to open. Any suggestions on what to do or should I just give it up and order a wireless modem from my ISP and pay $4.00 every month? Thanks

Ours is setup like this forum suggests as to latest firmware and the rest of the suggested settings. I didn't have to open ports, forward, touch anything NAT. It just works. Bob

Lastest firmware, router defaults, and WPA-PSK for wifi security and a simple broadcasting SSID. Your post sounds like you are trying many interesting things. I'm glad my 2000 just works with the 360 without touching any setting. Bob

I thought maybe the issue was the fact the router isn't certified for the xbox but if you have no issues then that's probably not it. I tried to upgrade to the latest firmware and it said none was available.

Ok, maybe I'm missing something. Both our 360s work with live fine. But you keep writing moderate NAT. Is there more to this story? That is, are you attempting something other than Live? It will be a few weeks until I get back to home (on travel today) to see what firmware I have in our 2000 router but here, the stock settings and the forum advice works. Parting idea. See if you can put the xbox 360 into the DMZ. Bob

Try the following to resolve your problem. 1) Go to the &quot;router login&quot; 2) Click on &quot;WAN Setup&quot; 3) uncheck the box labeled as &quot;NAT Filtering&quot;

I did the DMZ open prt forwarding ALL the things forums said, and nothing helped! The NETGEAR WNR2000v2 has to the best router ever for MWCOD,and black ops and any xbox 360 game! All I did was plug it up and it ran! Open NAT every time, no configuration, It even saw the gateway without cofiguration. It has a good range as well on the wireless. If your fighting the open NAT like I was, You will love this router!
