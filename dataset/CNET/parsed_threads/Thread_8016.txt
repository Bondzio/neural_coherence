<s> My &quot;Lite-ON DVD writer/rewriter super allwrite (LH-20A1P)&quot; drive is not working properly. </s>
<s> It can read or write CDs but it is unable to read or write DVDs. </s>
<s> So I want to know what's happened with it? </s>
<s> I've also tried updating the firmware,but it didn't work (now the drive can read few DVDs not all the DVDs). </s>
<s> So please help. </s>
<s> my OS: win XP , DVD writer: LH-20A1P487C </s>
<s> It likely died in some way. </s>
<s> Are you sure you need to know what happened or do you need to know these last only a few years and we replace them? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> yeah!I really need to know, what happened? </s>
<s> and how to fix it? </s>
<s> Remember that repairing these drives costs far more than putting in a new one. </s>
<s> You need some electronic gear like an oscilloscope, a laser power meter to read the output of the laser and spare parts. </s>
<s> You haven't even cracked over the drive and you have 10 thousand bucks of test gear. </s>
<s> Now do you understand why you replace the drive? </s>
<s> so you mean, repairing by professionals at any service center will cost more than a new one? </s>
<s> the warranty period of my drive is over also. </s>
<s> These are no longer repaired. </s>
<s> Even at service centers. </s>
<s> At our shop we have a few hundred arranged by make that are donors for parts like trays, bezels but we know better than to never try to fix one. </s>
<s> Here's an article on fixing CDROM drives so you can see what you are in for -&gt; http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/cdfaq.htm I know many can't accept that repair of a 29 buck drive is not economically sound. </s>

<s> Getting your drive repaired will offer only a temporary solution, it will likely fail in a few months. </s>
<s> So you're better off getting yourself a new one. </s>
<s> please tell me which one will be the best to buy..it will be better if you give me the details of the product. </s>
<s> If you shop at newegg.com you can list what they have for 29 bucks this week. </s>
