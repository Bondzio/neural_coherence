<s> How can I get my old but trusty 4050n HP printer to work with my new computer that has no parallel port? </s>
<s> I have some other ports on the back of the printer. </s>
<s> Two kind of look like those used to connect up a monitor. </s>
<s> Another looks like a PS2 port I think it is called that was used and I guess still is used to connect a keyboard or mouse. </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any help, Dave </s>

<s> You could TRY a parallel to USB adapter, that is a maybe. </s>
<s> If the printer software is not compatible with the OS and there isn't a driver package update from the manufacturer (HP)you likely have a sea anchor, good luck!! </s>
