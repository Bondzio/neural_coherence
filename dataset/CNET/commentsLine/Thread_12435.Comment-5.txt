...although it is strange that you've had the problem with 3 drives.
most of the replacement drives that we get are not maxtor...(usually western digital because they're cheap.
lol) we've had a few maxtors, but i've never had that kind a problem.
when booting up or running a defrag, some drives will make a slight amount of noise, but i sure wouldn't call it a &quot;clicking&quot; noise... either way, since your diagnostics tests are showing problems and you continue to get bad replacements, i suggest getting your money back and trying another brand.
hope this helps.
