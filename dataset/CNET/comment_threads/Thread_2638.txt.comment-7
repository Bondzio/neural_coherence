The FCC isn't paying anyone.
They are freeing up the bandwidth for other uses, do your homework.
The &quot;box&quot; you want does not exist.
You either get the HDTV OTA USB device or nothing.
Noting the USB device will also tune the standard cable channels (I've done this), but not the HD or specialty content.
For that you need the evil cable box.
It's just the way it is.
I've been wiating for a high end graphics card with either DVI or HDMI input .
I'm still waiting.
