you might be doing this backward.
i'd suggest this, buy a motherboard with the most universal socket available with the ability to run the most advanced process then plan to upgrade in the future when the prices drop.
if your lucky, and you do some serious shopping, you might find a bundled set that match these objectives.
in two years you could be running a quad core for $100.00.
