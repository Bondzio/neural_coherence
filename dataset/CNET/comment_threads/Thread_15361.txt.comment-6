ive had this exact setup going for a year now and it has only started happening recently... do u still think it might be b/c of 4 ram sticks, 2 hdd, 1 optical, vid card, and fans all needing to be recognized?
if this is the case would changing any bios settings help?
such as turning on the delay start up?....
btw to Proffitt: i will probably be trying your suggestion soon and to everyone thanks for the input/advice.
