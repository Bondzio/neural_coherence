<s> HI I am having some problems with my new Adesso optical mouse. </s>
<s> I am using an AMD Athlon xp 2400 cpu with 256 ram and Win 98 Se. </s>
<s> Sometimes it will freeze up the pc and I will reboot and all is ok. Also, sometimes when I start up a new session I get a little window that says there is no mouse detected/attached. </s>
<s> When I reboot all is ok again. </s>
<s> There was no driver with this mouse, or from the website. </s>
<s> I just installed it using Window's add new hardware utility. </s>
<s> I have repeated this installation and I still have these problems. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Unless the mouse has fancy bells and whistles, there's no need to install it. </s>
<s> That's why there was no software with it. </s>
<s> I just plugged mine in to both my XP machines, not even rebooting. </s>
<s> If you're able to uninstall it, do so then reboot. </s>
<s> XP will find it and all should be ok. </s>
