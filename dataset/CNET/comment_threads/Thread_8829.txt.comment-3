Absolutely you are write.
Unfortunately when entering the post I followed the auto-prompt for another problem I experienced some way back.
In fact the title should be the one I have now inserted above.
I'm not sure how to rectify this within the forum?
Can I change my Post title?
My troubles are being compounded by my own stupidity.
