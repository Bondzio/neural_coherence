I attempted to reload windows xp using a new SATA cable and a new hard disk and I received the same messages described above. I tried this install using all 4 SATA ports and had the same errors. I am thinking maybe a bad SATA controller on my MSI AMD motherboard? Any ideas?

Not to duplicate all the thousands of posts I'll keep it short. 1. You must have a XP SP2 CD or newer PLUS (read 2, 3) 2. Try the BIOS setting to enable IDE emulation or disable AHCI. No, I didn't read your motheboard manual. Just sharing what I try. 3. If your motherboard doesn't do that, use the drivers from the machine's maker they gave you on the F6 FLOPPY DISKETTE to give XP SATA support. Good luck, Bob

When you say &quot;it's&quot; defective, what are you referring to? As far as the setup, it was working fine until this message appeared. I have tested the following: 1) Both hard drives are recognized in another pc and Windows XP boots correctly. 2) I tried reconnecting the hard drives using a new SATA cable and that didn't make a difference. I am thinking that maybe the SATA controller went bad? At this point I am following up on the warranty for the mother board. Thanks!
