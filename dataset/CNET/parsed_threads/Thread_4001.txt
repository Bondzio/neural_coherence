<s> Need a little help. </s>
<s> Well for one i have a HP A305W. </s>
<s> I have a problem on it where for some reason the ATX power connecter cant be in all the way or the cmoputer will turn on but the motherboard wont recieve any power. </s>
<s> Besides the point i was wondering what kind of motherboard i could the most bang for my buck. </s>
<s> I hate intel so i would rather go that way then intel just because i hate them and they suck. </s>
<s> Also im going to get a new case simply for the fact that its an oem case and they tend to look nice but are very cramped so im going to get a new case too. </s>
<s> Also im going to need a new processor with that motherboard. </s>
<s> Just wondering what kinda advice someone could maybe give me. </s>
<s> You said the computer will turn on but the MB receives no power. </s>
<s> This simply cannot happen as described. </s>
<s> If you are saying the PS fan or other fans run but the PC does not boot, that's an entirely different issue and one that might be resolvable. </s>
<s> If the PC runs normally when you leave the PS connector only partially inserted, I'd be looking for a deformed pin or jack in the connection. </s>
<s> Sometimes the jack (female end) just spreads a bit and causes loss of connection. </s>
<s> This is very common with HD power cables when one is constantly connecting and reconnecting them. </s>
<s> It's easy to &quot;reform&quot; these bad parts. </s>
<s> I use a pin extraction tool that's slightly larger than the female ends to insert and &quot;wiggle&quot; them back into shape...or some thin needle nose pliers will work. </s>
<s> It can also be that one of the pins is just loose in the connector and is being pushed out when you insert it. </s>
<s> Take a good look and good luck. </s>
<s> um no i mean that he fans recieve no power but everything in my computer does such as Hd, dvd/rw drive, but the power led does not and the fans dont turn on so i dont know. </s>
<s> but i still kinda want a little advice on what to get for my new computer </s>
<s> I don't know what you will use you system for but I have a suggestion: I say get this case: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811119077 Motherboard: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813128307 Processor: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103562 What is your budget and use for your computer and you can get more help. </s>
<s> Those are really great suggestions but i think im going to have to go with a little bit cheaper processor. </s>
<s> Mainly im going to be using the game for some light gaming, internet use, music and video. </s>
<s> My budget is yet unknown, and since im only fifteen its a little harder to get the funds but at this point i think 400-500 is what im going to be able to spend. </s>
<s> So i really like the suggestion but i think ill go with a 50 dollar cheaper processor. </s>
