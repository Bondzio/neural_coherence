<s> My iOmega LDHD-UP2, 2TB, External Hard Drive works fine when I plug it in and the files (mainly videos) run properly. </s>
<s> I have divided my 2TB into two partitions (let's say U drive &amp; ME drive), nearly 1TB each. </s>
<s> Both the partition is formatted as NTFS. </s>
<s> The problem is that the ME drive that has all videos, about 10GB, does not copy files properly anymore. </s>
<s> Any file size over 500MB will start copying and eventually the copying speed rate decreases dramatically, most of the times from 100MB/s to 2MB/s, and just stops without moving any further when it's about 10 - 20 sec left to complete the transfer of data (videos). </s>
<s> I have tried waiting for the completion of data transfer for more than 5 hours for just 1.5GB File. </s>
<s> The light on the External Hard Drive blinks very fast and stops blinking randomly when the transfer stops/ freezes. </s>
<s> To fix this problem I have tried Defragmentation of the ME drive, tried USB Update, tired Error-checking, virus scan for both the drives (U &amp; ME) and also recently copied all my 10GB worth or data on to my desktop, formatted the ME drive again with NTFS and copied back all the files. </s>
<s> It was working fine until i copied all the files but then soon after a day passed by the same problem occurred in the ME drive. </s>
<s> Since the transfer of data stops, I try to cancel the transfer, its loads for 2+ hours and does not close/ cancel. </s>
<s> This leads me to unplug the USB from my computer without ejecting the drive. </s>
<s> Meanwhile the U drive with just about 5GB of data works perfectly fine when copying big media files Is it because of the space used? </s>
<s> even then i have about 980GB of free space on my ME drive! </s>
<s> My Computer configuration: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit 650 Intel Core i5 processor 8GB DDR3 NVIDIA GeForce GT320 1024MB So please if anyone had any solutions or suggestions for my problems I'll be so thankful for you... </s>
<s> I'd run Chkdsk and let it check for and attempt repair of bad sectors. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Add a note about backup before that step. </s>
<s> As the drive may have an issue, CHKDSK may push it over the cliff before they had a chance to save their files. </s>

<s> Just now i finished with the Checking Disk and also Defragmentation, but the problem still occurs. </s>
<s> It copies to a certain limit and it freezes, Light on the HDD blinking very fast, the &quot;Time remaining&quot; says &quot;calculating...&quot; and the &quot;Speed&quot; stays as 135MB/sec without any change. </s>
<s> from Seagate or Western Digital. </s>
<s> They have some good ones. </s>
<s> If you should buy another external hard drive, I'd recommend one of those two brands. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> We know there are limits to the file count in the root directory. </s>
<s> We also know that as you put more and more files in a folder the speed steps down every 250 or 500 files. </s>
<s> There's a lesson there. </s>
<s> An old one. </s>
<s> Do the disk test AFTER you have your files safe. </s>
