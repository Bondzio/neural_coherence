1.1.1	I am going to be building a new PC sometime this summer , and am looking at the Q9450 with the hope of OC'ing to somewhere in the 3.3-3.5Ghz range , using a Noctua cooler .	St
1.1.2	Is this possible , and if so , how feasible ( reasonable temps even on air cooling , stability , etc .	St
1.1.3	) , and what accompanying RAM overclock is required ?	Ques
1.1.4	Secondly , will DDR2-800 RAM be sufficient ( assuming I will have to OC it to at least somewhat ) ?	Ques
1.1.5	( I saw DDR-800 here since I have seen a few discussions that seem to say that RAM with stock speeds above 800 are sometimes unstable .	St
1.1.6	Any input is appreciated .	Polite
1.1.7	If it matters , I will be using some flavor of Asus P5Q motherboard most likely .	St
1.2.1	when OC'ing you 'll need to tweak your FSB and ram speed seperately .	St
1.2.2	a 400mhz fsb is the simplest OC for that processor .	St
1.2.3	it will raise the CPU from 2.66ghz to 3.2ghz and you 'll still be able to run your ram at ddr2-800 .	St
1.2.4	any good motherboard will be to do this with a good cooler ( like the noctua ) and all that might be necessary is a gentle vcore push .	St
1.2.5	if you want to go higher , you should probably opt for ddr2-1066 and be prepared for a lot more tweaking .	St
1.2.6	with a 420mhz FSB you could run at ddr2-840 or ddr2-1050 depending on the ratio you choose .	St
1.2.7	heat will also become more of an issue over 400mhz FSB .	St
1.2.8	anandtech did a preview of the p5q deluxe a couple of weeks ago : http : //www.anandtech.com/mb/showdoc.aspx ? i=3309 & p=8	Ques
1.3.1	would my setup still be sufficient ( i.e. , just higher overall temps , but nothing that would cause instability ) , or should I start looking at more aggressive cooling setups ?	Ques
