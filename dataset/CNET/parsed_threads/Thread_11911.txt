<s> I have a small wired network in my company, containing about ten computers, servers, etc. </s>
<s> and would like to add wireless capability for a computer that needs to be placed in the warehouse. </s>
<s> Currently my network is set up with static IP's and do not want to change this, is it possible to set up a wireless network where DHCP is only enabled for the computer accessing through the wireless conection? </s>
<s> Also what hardware is required, is it a wireless access point? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> DHCP does not dictate that all machines be set to DHCP. </s>
<s> And a WAP is what you can add to get it done. </s>
<s> However a WAP is just about the same price as a WIFI router, so replacing your router may be a great idea. </s>
<s> But then again you can move the WAP closer to the warehouse. </s>
