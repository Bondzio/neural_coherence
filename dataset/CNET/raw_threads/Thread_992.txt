I don't remember when this problem started, but Vista Home Basic won't display certain web pages. The model is an Emachine (walmart special)which I bought in February this year 2007. The model # is W3611. It is completely UNmodified, I de-crapified it, and installed Grisoft AVG and it updates automatically. The only two webpages is doesn't display (so far!) is www.ftc.gov and http://authorityresearch.com . I've been told both these pages are heavy with java script... Just this evening I installed the latest java update, but there's no change. When it won't load the page, I mean it won't load. I type in www.ftc.gov and I get this: http://www.google.com/search?q=www.ftc.gov&rls=com.microsoft:*&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&startIndex=1&startPage=1 I can click on the correct link (at the top) and then I get the screen that says: Internet explorer cannot display page. Then gives some options for &quot;fixing&quot; it. There's no connection problem either. I have wireless and it's always 'on'. I have just this evening discovered I can bring up a cached page, but it has aspects of the page that's missing. Here is the link: http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:QUz5NZ_JWQIJ:www.ftc.gov/+www.ftc.gov&hl=en&gl=us&strip=0 I checked my security settings, and they are not too high. If someone can shed any light on this problem, PLEASE DO. I REALLY need to get information from the FTC website... Thanks! Charlene

If not, then I suspect something with the new Internet Explorer, (version 7), is breaking them. However I use Windows XP and both sites work with my IE7. If they did work with your Windows Vista and with IE7 then there has been some change to your system that has broken IE7 for these sites. Does this happen only on these two sites or does it happen with other sites as well? As a short term measure see if you can get access to these two sites with another browser. Internet Explorer isn't the only type of browser we can use on Windows and there are other good ones available. Mozilla has one called Firefox at http:\\www.mozilla.com . It is compatible with Windows Vista and doesn't affect using IE for other sites if that is what you wish. If Firefox does not allow you to access these sites then I suspect some software is blocking your computer from accessing them. Do you have any anti-spyware software installed? Mark

It might take you more time to find out how to copy and paste from the command window than just retyping it. Installing java surely doesn't solve the problem if it's javascript related. Those are totally different technologies. It's like putting more air in the tyres of your car when you ran out of gas: doesn't help. Kees

When was the last time you did a defragmentation and error check on your computer? If you don't have registry repair software get one from this site: http://www.download.com/3120-20_4-0.html?tg=dl-20&qt=registry%20repair&tag=srch If this fails This is a trouble shooter for IE7 from Microsoft http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/gp/pc_ie_intro If this fails You may wish to reinstall IE7, java and adobe one of them may have a corrupt file in them that is blocking your access to these sites. Good luck.

I get a time-out also on www.ftc.com, but it also tells me the ip-address that's being pinged: 69.46.230.66. And if I enter that in my browsers address bar I get to an advertisement site directnicparking.com. However, if I type http://164.62.4.30 I get to the ftc-site. Can you try that? If it works, it might solve halve of your problem. authorityresearch.com is 209.216.253.192. It pings OK, but this IP-address in the address bar leads to a general page of a company called Plesk (presumably their hosting provider). The first thing I would do to sort this out is find a laptop where you can view both these sites elsewhere. Then connect it to the same Internet-connection (either wired or wireless) as this erroneous PC and see what happens. If the same error occurs with this laptop at your place, and not elsewhere, it seems an error with your ISP (or router). If the laptop is OK with you, it's a problem in your PC. You check the hosts file (but that's an unlikely cause) or run it without any Internet security program. The most likely way to solve it is to do a clean install of Windows XP and start all over with your machine. While you install additional software keep checking if things go wrong, and you might find out the cause. But just as well, everything goes OK up to the end and the problem is solved forever. Be sure to make a system restore point to go back to if it re-appears. Kees

Firefox says, &quot;the ftc site has taken too long to respond&quot; and &quot;there might be a problem with your internet connection&quot; In a pig's eye... this is TOOO MUCH!!

Can someone help me? I have visited the Vista website and can't find what I need. I have visited the Windows website too.

Do you have diagnostics for your ethernet adapter run them first and try again. Then contact your IP for assistance this maybe there problem or the way your Adapter is working with your connection.

This brings up the run command window. type in msconfig and hit enter. This brings up the system configuration utility. click the startup tab and check the box disable all. Click the services tab, make sure that you check the hide all microsoft services, and then click disable all for the remaining ones. Reboot your computer, it is now running only the stuff microsoft intended windows the start up with. Try your browser now, if it was software interferance there is a good chance this will fix the problem. Especially if your computer is a brand name one like: toshiba, acer, dell, etc.. they always stack the computer with their garbage software right out of the box and sometimes it has issues with what the user is trying to do.

I'm not charliegirl, obviously, but I have the SAME problem. For a while, turning my firewall off would allow me to access some sites that work on my XP machine but not on my Vista machine. But I tried your solution, and so far, it seems to be working. I have a sneaking suspicion that Counterspy might have been part of the problem--a service I disabled. But the computer is running much better now. And a site that wasn't loading before (one I need for work) is now working fine, with the firewall on and working. Sigh. Thank you.
