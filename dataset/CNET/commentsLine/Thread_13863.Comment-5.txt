when i tried my nvidia 7900 on a 250 watt psu the same thing happened, i new it wouldnt work but i had to see if the video card was a working one somehow so i got a 600 watt psu and that was a piece of crap and it fried my cpu somehow =o ultra is not a very good brand.
so i got a new mobo cpu and case and ram and the same video card works fine no problems even ocing it quite a bit so im confident it might be ur gpu =d i hope i help
