<s> Just went to turn my system on this morning, and it will not boot! </s>
<s> It has been running great, and I have added no new software or hardware for awhile. </s>
<s> When I turn on the computer, the XP logo splashes up, then I get a message about Windows not starting correctly. </s>
<s> However, I am not able to use my keyboard (USB) at all to select an option. </s>
<s> On the front of my computer (Dell Dimension 2400), there is a green light that keeps flashing to the right of the power button. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on what I could try? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> L.T. </s>
<s> Bring it up in safe mode and run your anti-everything apps. </s>
<s> You do run them don't you? </s>
<s> If that should fail to fix your problem, pull out the CD that came with the system and do a repair. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Jack, thanks for the suggestion. </s>
<s> I wish I could get to safe mode! </s>
<s> I get the screen that asks me if I want to restart in safe mode, but I have no keyboard or mouse function which would enable me to get there. </s>
<s> I now have a ps2 mouse hooked up instead of my USB one, and it still does not help. </s>
<s> When I get the message about Windows having an error and it gives me the options of how I want to start it up, the countdown at the bottom expires and it tries to start normally. </s>
<s> Then, the screen goes black. </s>
<s> The computer power does stay on, but the green light next to the power flashes. </s>
<s> Do I need a new hard drive? </s>
<s> This computer is only about a year old. </s>
<s> I really, really need those documents back. </s>
<s> Here's yet another lesson of why I should have backed everything up last week when I thought about it!!! </s>
<s> Thanks for taking time to offer a suggestion. </s>
<s> I'd love to read any other ideas. </s>
<s> I'm open to try them! </s>
<s> I don't think the hard drive is the problem...yet. </s>
<s> The fact that you get the Windows &quot;welcome&quot; screen tells me it's working...at least a little. </s>
<s> I guess the warranty is out of the question? </s>
<s> You didn't say whether or not you had the &quot;restore&quot; CDs. </s>
<s> That would be my next suggestion. </s>
<s> You could also take that HD and put it in another system just to make sure it's OK. </s>
<s> Put it in the secondary IDE port tho, so it doesn't try to boot. </s>
<s> You might take the cover off and dust it out real good. </s>
<s> At least it'll be clean. </s>
<s> The key is going to be that restore CD that should have come with the machine, unless you built it. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> I have a few suggestions: 1. </s>
<s> Remove any extra RAM you installed. </s>
<s> If not, switch your ram to a different slot because the motherboard may have trouble reconize it. </s>
<s> remember to discharge yourself on a metal surface before touching chips. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Get a recovery CD, and run it. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Press and hold F2 or F8 during powerup and enter the BIOS setup screen. </s>
<s> look for the USB connections selection under Hardware (depend on your BIOS) and enable all USB ports. </s>
<s> If your keyboard do not work, replace it with a PS/2 connector keyboard, or get an adapter. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Don't buy DELL again. </s>
<s> I recommend eMachines for value-PCs. </s>
<s> I ended up calling the Dell tech. </s>
<s> line to see if someone could help me there. </s>
<s> I have had less than stellar tech. </s>
<s> service from them over the years, but my call today was fantastic. </s>
<s> I spoke with someone who actually spoke proper English, and he knew what he was doing. </s>
<s> He walked me through about 4 steps which he said would reset my keyboard in the bios. </s>
<s> That worked, and I am up and running again. </s>
<s> I am so glad that I didn't have to spend hours and $$$ trying to solve this issue. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help and suggestions! </s>
<s> What were the four (4) steps in solving the problem? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
