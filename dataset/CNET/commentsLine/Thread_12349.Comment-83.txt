i have worked with both linksys and netgear routers.
honestly, they both work the same.
i really don't see or notice any performance differences.
but if you get either brand, make sure the wireless router and wireless card are the same brand.
i have a 3 computers in my house.
i have a netgear firewall router, on my laptop, i have linksys wireless card for some reason, when i use wep encryption, the laptop can connect to the access point, but can connect to the internet, so i have to turn off the encryption.
but i use acl to prevent my neighbors jumping on my wireless network.
as far as is if 108mpbs is neccessary, it's not neccessary neccessary, but if you like speed and don't like waiting, then you should got with the g router.
