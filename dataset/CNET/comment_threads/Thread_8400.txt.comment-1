Stay away from this product.
What a nightmare product.
Not only is it as useless as **** on a boar, but they won't refund your purchase!
I spent weeks with the D-Link tech folks, who are as frustrated as their customers.
They can't get a firmware made that will keep the unit online and conflict-free.
What ends up happening, as a customer, you end up as their beta-tester... and you get to pay for the privilege!
If you are thinking of buying this junk-bin item, do your homework!
Read up on all the other users pulling their hair out trying to get their units working.
You have been warned!
