I am using Windows XP and I am the administrator and have my son set up as one of the users.
I'd like to know if it's possible to set up or require a password if someone wanted to send something to the printer.
My printer software does not allow this option, so I wondered if there was something that could be done on the XP side of things or on user settings.
The only thing I found and changed was the times the printer could be accessed so I just set it for 1 min from midnight to 1 min after that since my son would not be up to use the printer at that time so I'm safe The only thing is, I am then limited to only those times if I want to print......so requiring a password would be easier.
Thanks
