<s> Hi All: I bought a T6420 which includes a Nvidia GeForce 6100. </s>
<s> Is this video card good enough to play World of Warcraft? </s>
<s> or is it good to play current pc games like BAttefield, HalfLife2, Fear etc...? </s>
<s> I am not to familiar with video cards and its performance. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> My son plays these games and I am looking for a new system with the GeForce card. </s>
<s> Have an Emachine now and looking at the Model you have now as another computer in the house. </s>
<s> How does it run in general? </s>
<s> How are your other games running on it? </s>
<s> Everquest II online? </s>
<s> Keep this in mind: I had an HP pavilion computer (6 yrs old) with windows 98. </s>
<s> In general computer runs great and fast. </s>
<s> I had Bestbuy to do a &quot;customization&quot; for #29 and they say it will cut time when you &quot;start&quot; your computer. </s>
<s> Basically it cuts down on software loading in the background. </s>
<s> I am happy I pay for it since I dont know how to do it other than going to &quot;starup&quot; and unchecked the software manually. </s>
<s> It has a Media Center and thats what I wanted cause of hooking it up with my 360 (which I did and its a plus). </s>
<s> But, Pc doesnt have the &quot;hook ups&quot; to connect your pc to your tv, but I am pretty sure there are other ways in hooking it up (im getting info on this). </s>
<s> I havent played any games like you mention (Everquest) that why I was asking if anyone else have. </s>
<s> If you go to www.pcstats.com it will give you a more understanding of what this chipset can do (I barely learning the PC language/technically). </s>
<s> I am assuming that it will run good with &quot;low settings&quot; if you play Everquest. </s>
<s> But for Doom3 it doesnt cut it (pcstats). </s>
<s> But overall it is a great chipset for the money I paid for. </s>
<s> Hope this helps you a little bit! </s>
<s> The Nvidia 6100 is comparable to ATI Xpress 200, both integrated graphics. </s>
<s> However, like the ATI chipset, there is a PCIe slot for a better graphics card. </s>
<s> Yes, you can play those games on it, but at the lowest settings. </s>
<s> I've played FEAR on the ATI Xpress 200 gpu and it wasn't very pretty. </s>
<s> For optimum playing you're better to upgrade with a card. </s>
<s> Thank you for your input greately appreciate it! </s>
<s> Hi All: Just to give you a quick status on how my computer has work so far just in case anyone is interesting on how this computer model performs. </s>
<s> Performance: It is a fast computer and runs smooth with no hesitation. </s>
<s> Programs load fast and quick (Bestbuy did a customization to do this). </s>
<s> I transfer my music files with ease (cd to hard drive). </s>
<s> I downloaded an episode of tv-show &quot;Lost&quot; to iTunes and downloaded as fast as possible (less then 2 min). </s>
<s> Automically updates download fast. </s>
<s> Overall computer has perform well and as espected. </s>
<s> Gaming: Since I am not a pc-gamer (only console gamer); I bought World of Warcraft and downloaded. </s>
<s> Download was easy and without any pains. </s>
<s> Everything run smoothly on the game. </s>
<s> Keep it mind that I am a newbie at WOW so I didnt went to fight any bosses or there was not so much action on my screen. </s>
<s> Everything look beautiful and crips. </s>
<s> Video card is powerful enough to play this game with it. </s>
<s> I didn't do any &quot;adjustment&quot; to my video card. </s>
<s> I let the &quot;default&quot; settings and it runs smooth. </s>
<s> Problems Encounter: I had one problem encounter with this computer and not sure if it was me that cause it or something else. </s>
<s> I went to NVidia websites and try to download &quot;new drivers&quot; for graphics card. </s>
<s> Since I didnt pay much attention to what I was doing. </s>
<s> I click on the download drivers and start downloading process. </s>
<s> In the process the system just lack me out and game me error message. </s>
<s> So I had to shut down my computer. </s>
<s> Once I login back I notice that I didnt have access to the internet. </s>
<s> So I decided to download my &quot;roadrunner&quot; disc to have access again. </s>
<s> When I did it gave me a message that i didn't have a &quot;NIC&quot; connection (Network Internet Connection). </s>
<s> At first I that what the hell is going on. </s>
<s> Since I am not a pc guy and read the instruction booklet and decided that my best bit is to go back and ask the system to &quot;restart me at the last time when my pc was working&quot; (something to those lines). </s>
<s> So I did, and walla; everything works. </s>
<s> The only bad side of it is that I had to reload WOW but that was no biggie. </s>
<s> Basically what I am saying is watch out if you download any nvidia drivers. </s>
<s> OVERALL: I am happy to purchase this computer, media center works wonderful with xBOX 360 the downside doesnt have a tv turner but you can purchase that at a later time and installed it. </s>
<s> Video card is powerful enough and if you go to pcstat and do a search of (GeForce 6100) it will give you all the stats and performance of the chipset and video. </s>
<s> In there it says that it is a good chipset and performs well above its competitors. </s>
<s> Thank you for replying. </s>
<s> I am still looking at upgrading to this video card for my son, and still researching it. </s>
<s> Looks like it takes more psu to run. </s>
<s> Thank you for the reply. </s>
<s> Everyone seems to like GeForce card. </s>
<s> We had originally upgraded with a ATI card, but feel the Geforce one will be better suited to crisp gaming. </s>
<s> I just got a gateway pc with the 6100 integrated graphics and I can run Doom 3 at medium setting fairly smooth. </s>
<s> the processor is the athlon x2 4200. </s>
<s> Before I start, I want to confirm that the computer does have a PCI-e x16. </s>
<s> Hmmm... </s>
<s> I don't think eMachines put in powerful PSU's, maybe a 400W. </s>
<s> Some GPU's will work great with 400W, but most will not. </s>
<s> Do you have a set price range for getting a new GPU? </s>
<s> Factor in the price of a new PSU, maybe $50 or so. </s>
<s> If you want less than $200, I'd recommend a 6600GT, or even a 6600. </s>
<s> But a much better deal would be to spend $30 and get a better-performing 7600GT. </s>
<s> It is about 30% faster than the GT, and for *just* a little more. </s>
<s> Then for *just* a little more, well, actually, a little more than a little more, is the 7900GT. </s>
<s> It is the second best card from nVidia and is only for $299. </s>
<s> This is just my opinion, though. </s>
<s> They all are great cards, but the 7600GT seems like the best option. </s>
<s> Also, what resolution will you be playing at, and any AA or AF? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
