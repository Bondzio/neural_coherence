1.1.1	I was wondering if it's possible to connect an internal hard drive from a PC to a laptop.	St
1.1.2	Is there some sort of IDE to USB or Firewire connector?	St
1.2.1	You can connect an internal drive to a laptop, or almost any other computer, by way of a external hard drive mount, which is basically a case that encloses an internal drive and connects to the computer via usb, and some have firewire as well.	St
1.3.1	Google: 3.5'' external hard drive enclosure TWO MAIN SIZES OF HD: 3.5'' = desktop HD 2.5'' = notebook HD External enclosrues are made for both sizes.	St
1.3.2	There are models available that will enclose an IDE (PATA) or SATA HD.	St
1.3.3	Your local computer and electronics stores carry them.	St
1.3.4	Cheapest prices are usually found online.	St
1.3.5	Adapters without a case are available as a nice temporary solution.	St
1.3.6	Example: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812156101 NOTE: Connecting an external HD to a Windows XP machine via USB 2.0 has a better track record than Firewire.	St
1.3.7	There are also some models that connect to an external SATA port.	St
