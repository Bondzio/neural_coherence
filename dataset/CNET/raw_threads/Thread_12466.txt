The flickering of my monitor is not going. It still flicker or blinks whther I do something or not. Thats why I have thought may be RAM is getting damaged or is there any other problem? How can I troubleshoot this problem please help.

If it still flickers with the other PC, it's the monitor (probably a bad contact or capacitor inside). If the 'new' monitor flickers on your PC, it's something inside the PC. But my guess is that it's the monitor. Kees

I will get it back may be in a week. Now I am using a Dell monitor but is not supporting Counter Strike CZero. pixels are getting missaligned and colour contrast is also bad
