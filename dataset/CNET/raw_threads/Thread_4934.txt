Can I use this card with Windows XP? The onboard sound I have sucks and I am contemplating buying one of these from ebay cheaply. I do not have it yet so I need to know this ahead of time. tick tick tick.

A common misconception is that Microsoft will install current drivers... This board has been seen in the 20s since its been out of production for over a year now. Bob
