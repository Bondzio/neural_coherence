research this and you find companies like drivesavers.com they take your drive and need be put the platters into a working drive.
this is a lesson about backup.
many don't want to learn this lesson.
they'll reply with &quot;that's no help, tell me how to get my files.&quot; again this is the lesson.
i fear that today you can't teach backup.
it must be learned.
