<s> Hi All, I have a very pesky network printing problem on my home network. </s>
<s> I have two Vista Home computers, one XP computer and a printer in my home network. </s>
<s> Printer is connected to the network through a wirless switch together with one of the Vista computers that it is connected to. </s>
<s> The network is connected to internet through a wireless router (although two Vista computers are connected to it through wire). </s>
<s> Everythig in the network is working fine except for one thing. </s>
<s> I cannot print from one of the non-admin accounts on the Vista computer that does not have the printer connected to it. </s>
<s> Printing works from the admin account on that computer. </s>
<s> I use Norton Security on all 3 computers in the network and and have setup a full trust in Norton to all devices in the network. </s>
<s> The printer sharing is setup such that Everybody can share and use the printer. </s>
<s> When I send the document to print from this non-admin user account it sends the document but printer never reacts. </s>
<s> The document status in print queue displays &quot;Printing&quot;. </s>
<s> Would anybody know what else I need to do? </s>
<s> Thanks, Milorad </s>
<s> Only those with an account on the machines in question. </s>
<s> It is not correct to think otherwise. </s>
<s> So let's say that Bob is a non-admin account. </s>
<s> Fine. </s>
<s> But does Bob have an account on the machine with the share? </s>
<s> Many forget this trivia about Windows Networking. </s>
<s> Assuming that the printer you want to share is just a printer (meaning not an AIO because with this solution you may lose scanning capability) you can place the printer on your network via a USB print server and connect it directly to your router via Ethernet cable. </s>
<s> Any desktop/laptop connected to the network (wired or wireless) can share the printer using the IP address of the printer during printer setup on each computer. </s>
<s> If your router is configured to do so it will generate an IP address automatically; or you can assign one yourself. </s>
<s> Of course, each desktop/laptop on the network must register with the proper WEP, WPA or WPA2 security, unless your network is unsecured </s>
