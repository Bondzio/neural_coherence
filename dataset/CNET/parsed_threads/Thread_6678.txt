<s> Hi, I'm looking for a low profile graphics card for a compact PC- HP Slimline S7750UK (not for gaming but AutoCAD 3D & Photoshop). </s>
<s> The power supply is 220v- wondering if that's too low to run one, without adding extra power? </s>
<s> I realise this isn't the best PC to be upgrading, but would like to have a go before investing in a new one. </s>
<s> Would appreciate any advice, thanks. </s>
