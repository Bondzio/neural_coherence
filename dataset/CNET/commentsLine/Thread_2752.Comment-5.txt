i review and sometimes create a lot of print collateral.
i concur that touch screen technology would get really tedious for msoffice chores or scrolling a long web page.
but it would be awesome if the technology could interface with edits in photoshop, illustrator, or other graphic design programs.
a clicking mouse gets on my nerves when i'm trying to drag a photo to a trash can.
i keep missing the trash can
