In power supplies all too often more than one componet can be at fault.
Thus a whole circuit is comprised even if the obivous is found.
Alot can happen as you found a bad &quot;diode&quot;, that's not always good to fix and return as the psu is &quot;weaken&quot; and could easily blow again.
I suggest, just replace the psu and make it a higher wattage one.
This is the best advise I can pass on as a decent psu of at least 500W+ even if generic or a known namebrand of 400W+(more than 420W) is goint to be needed.
Unless you stress test the psu, then repair for best results, but rememeber when you return it to the system all those componets/devices dempendant upon it have already suffered one blow-out, can they another?
Plus, keep an eye on it if problem crop-up soon enough(30-days or less).
