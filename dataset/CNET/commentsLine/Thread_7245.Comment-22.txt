pretty much a generic item.
if you researched this you found 2 common models with 3 connectors and two ribbon cable types.
if you use the older ribbon cable type the worst that could happen is the drive data is corrupted.
the newer ribbon cable type can be used without issue except you have to set the jumpers and the drives must &quot;like&quot; each other.
i covered the old tech stumper earlier about drives that never work on the same ide channel.
this one has caused months of time lost for some techs.
some can't wrap their head about that.
