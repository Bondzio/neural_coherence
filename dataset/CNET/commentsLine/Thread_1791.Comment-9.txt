the sata driver is frequently called a &quot;sata/raid&quot; driver.
from the link you provided, you want to download the &quot;sil3112 sil3114 intel via installation disk.&quot; it is a &quot;.exe&quot; file.
double-click on it and it should create a &quot;abitsata_v1.33&quot; folder.
copy the entire *contents* of that folder (not the folder itself) to a floppy disk.
