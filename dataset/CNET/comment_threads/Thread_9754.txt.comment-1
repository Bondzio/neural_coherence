So I have been getting screwed by the company Ebellking, it seems they have a history littered all over the net of disappointed and let down customers.
I believe making a small compilation of just a few of the complaints i found in 10 minutes of this company may save some people money, where so many of us seem to have lost.
In this day of online lottery buying I believe we should look out for each other on things like this.
