the question &quot;do you backup your data&quot; makes me wonder what to do...i read advice that the best way to backup many gb of digital pictures was with an external hard drive for my dell laptop.
after the first lacie 250 gb external drive died after 3 months, i bought another to back up the first while it was being repaired.
it did not seem possible that i could get 2 bad hard drives from one company.
well, not only is it possible but it happened and now i have two 250 gb lacie hard drives that only occassionally are recognized by windows xp.
the problem started long before service pack 2, so that can not be blamed.
no one seems to know what the problem is.
has anyone else had problems with lacie?
they seem to have a band of die hard haters at online retail sites.
any solutions?
even if lacie can fix these drives i could never use them with any confidence.
