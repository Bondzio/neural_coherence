After doing that it wont turn back on for an hour or two. The power supply feels warm so I am assuming that is what is overheating. I am fairly computer savy but never had problems with overheating before. what should I do to solve the problem?

Temp right now is 35 degrees since it took sitting all last night unused to get the stupid computer to turn on again. I guess I will have to wait for it to happen again so I can verify it is an overheating problem now that I have pc wizard

If it lasts longer and/or remains ON, good sign its overheating. You didn't mentioned anything about your system but if it stuffed with PC goodies or has hi-end devices that generate heat, thjat too must be better cooled. Thus, a well vent system and/or added fans will do great. Better now components are decent as they age tend to become less stable and fail. A PSU should feel as its a big heat source, so don't conclude its that alone, but a cheap or over-taxed PSU will become a candidate for failure if cooling isn't controlled. I wish, I could offer more concrete advice, but have found a weak or bad PSU a constant source of problems when PCs have added devices, bad cooling, location and/or overwhelmed cooling. Taken as a whole, a decent installed PSU capable of handling all power demands and well ventilated case does wonders. tada -----Willy
