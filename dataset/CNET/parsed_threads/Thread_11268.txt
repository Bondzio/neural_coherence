<s> Hi, I am about to buy a Monitor. </s>
<s> I am unable to decide between Asus VK246H and Dell SP2309W. </s>
<s> Please advice me on this. </s>
<s> Both are priced approximately the same in my region. </s>
<s> The links for technical specs of Asus VK246H monitor is :: http://in.asus.com/product.aspx?P_I.. . </s>
<s> and that for Dell Monitor is :: http://www1.ap.dell.com/in/en/home/.. . </s>
<s> Any other monitors in the same price and performance range may also be suggested. </s>
<s> Also, where I live, monitors above 20 inch are not on display anywhere. </s>
<s> Its because people mainly buy 17 and 19 inch models. </s>
<s> Whenever someone orders a 24 inch monitor they (the vendors) get it shipped only then.So I cannot compare different models visually. </s>
<s> I spend lots of time in front of the computer. </s>
<s> I want a monitor which puts least strain on the eye and is best suited to my needs (as a computer science person). </s>
<s> After clicking on the links provided; ASUS took me to a general index site, and Dell didn't take me anywhere. </s>
<s> More info needed: - how big of a display are looking into getting? </s>
<s> - regular or widescreen? </s>
<s> - what are your choices for retailers (bestbuy, newegg, etc.)? </s>
<s> - what is your budget? </s>
<s> Hi Brechen, Thanks for replying. </s>
<s> Now, actually I am in India not United States. </s>
<s> 1)&quot;After clicking on the links provided; ASUS took me to a general index site, and Dell didn't take me anywhere.&quot; The links that I included were of the respective Indian sites. </s>
<s> There might be some problem therefore or they might have expired. </s>
<s> However, I am including the specs of both of the monitors over here. </s>

<s> 2) I am considering 23-24 inch displays. </s>
<s> Widescreen. </s>
<s> 3) As far as choice of retailers is considered Amazon, Newegg etc do not operate in India. </s>
<s> I will be buying from a local distributor. </s>
<s> 4) The budget question is not easy to answer. </s>
<s> The cost of electronics is lower in the US as compared to India. </s>
<s> For Example: The rate of Asus VK246H as on Amazon.com is $229.99 ( http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=node%3D1292115011&field-keywords=vk246h&x=0&y=0 ) . </s>
<s> Converted to Indian currency(Rupees or Rs in short) this should be Rs 10810. </s>
<s> However, the market cost over here for this model is Rs 14500. </s>
<s> Roughly the budget can be estimated to around $200 - $250. </s>
<s> But another thing is that only a fraction of the models available in the US are available over here. </s>
<s> For Dell, the following models are available : Alienware OptX AW2310 Dell SP2309W Dell E248WFP 24&quot; Widescreen Flat Panel Monitor Dell UltraSharpTM 2408WFP 24&quot; Monitor Dell G Series G2410 24&quot; LED Monitor Dell ST Series ST2410 Details of all of these can be seen on Amazon USA site. </s>
<s> Also if you open the INDIAN sites of LG, Samsung, Asus,Dell etc they will have the exact information on which models are available here. </s>
<s> Indian sites can be opened by Google search like: LG+india site. </s>
<s> Additional Info: I am a computer Science student and spend practically the whole day in front of the computer. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your effort. </s>
<s> how will you be connecting the monitor to your computer? </s>
<s> - VGA? </s>
<s> - DVI? </s>
<s> - HDMI (via the videocard, if so equpped)? </s>
<s> personally, I would go with the ASUS; in my opinion, better name, better choices for connecting to your computer, happens that a friend of mine has this exact model of monitor-he can't say enough good things about it. </s>
<s> You could always check out the vendors forum sites, see how many complaints there are for each particular monitor, seriousness of the complaints. </s>
