Let's start off with a scenario. Let's say I boot the computer with a DVD in the &quot;e-drive&quot; and open the 'My Computer'. It will tell me what is in the drive. When I eject the DVD from &quot;e:drive&quot; and replace it with a CD the 'My Computer' will not update the cd-drive. The cd will also not do the auto-play (as do most cds that have an auto launch procedure). The cd-drive under 'My Computer' will still show what was in the drive when the system was booted. Even if I refresh the window it does nothing. If I double click on the icon it will still act like it's a dvd and launch a dvd player instead of a music program or the application. So far the only way to view the contents of the cd is to right click and explore. This is currently occurring to both my cd-drives so I'm sure it may not be an issue with them but something else. All the drivers are current and still cannot find the cause of the problem. What could be causing this issue? I am running Windows XP if that matters to anybody. Any help could be greatly appreciated. If you need more info please ask. -Mike

Autoinsert notification can be turned off as well as the owner relying on Microsoft for motherboard and other drivers. Known workaround. Tap the F5 key to refresh the drive listing. Run the programs manually. Some fixes. http://www.jsifaq.com/SF/Tips/Tip.aspx?id=6952 as well as updating your motherboard and other drivers. Known items that thwart repair. Virtual CD or DVD emulators, some trojans, rootkits and other viral damage. Bob

Since you are useing a DVD-ROM..you need to know the Media Types going in that TRAY..CDs don't matter..but I use a TOSHIBA(dash)Drive that if I place a DVD(plus)Disk in will corrupt my OS..and I have a second DVD-Drive that both(+ -)so all problems are eliminated.. .. Then it seems you said that you SHUT-Down with a disk in the TRAY..and then performed your START-UP w/the disk still in the TRAY..this can cause a problem or NOT..never SHUT Down with Removable Media in their Devices(especially)the FLOPPY Drive.. .. Also..are you RUNNING a Scheduled SCAN..and you have forgotten..so your attempting to run two programs at once..and that could be your problem.. .. I also ARCHIVE my FILES/FOLDERS..this keeps my System Drive ready to RUN with little Power Management problems..I usually start with a empty PC..for each project..useing External HDDs.. .. If none of the above is any help I would suggest you Re-Install and take a fresh look at your PC.
