means you have to re-install your games so that your games can setup for that new card.
the different characteristics of different cards are setup in the software.
you might want to even go to the microsoft website and download the latest directx after you put in the drivers for it (i wouldn't even use the cd that came with it.
i'd just go to nvidia.com and download the latest drivers from there).
also i'd check the bios and make sure the card is seated properly and plugged into the power supply.
i got battle field 2 and that's a terrible game, imho.
call to duty 2 is way better.
and now there's a call to duty 3.
