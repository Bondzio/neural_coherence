What I want to do: Have my HP PC desktop hardwired to the internet and my MacBook wirelessly to the net via my Airport.
I have a DSL modem and a 3 year old Airport extream.
I would also like to be able to share a HP printer between the two but that is not critical.
The MacBook/Airport has been functional for a couple of years; am adding the PC desktop into the mix.
How do I do this?
