She has a cable modem, and I have it hooked to the wireless capable Linksys router, but the router is not picking anything up, thus the adapter is not either.
I don't understand how the two can create an internet connection.
On the router, everything is lighting up that should except the &quot;internet&quot; part.
Well, that's obviously because she has no internet connection due to a bad network card.
The adapter installed just like the book said it should, but it's still not creating an internet connection like we were told it would.
Am I overthinking this thing or what?
