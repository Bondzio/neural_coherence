hi i have been using windows xp professional with my current setup and its been really slowing down as of yet.
i was wondering if maybe trying out the windows vista beta was worth a try or the 64 bit version of xp to speed up the system or maybe someone can give me any other other advice as to speed it up.
my rig: amd athlon 64 x2 3800+ asus a8n-sli mobo patriot signature series 1gb dual channel radeon x800xl pcie 256 mb ddr any comments would be greatly appreciated.
thanks.
