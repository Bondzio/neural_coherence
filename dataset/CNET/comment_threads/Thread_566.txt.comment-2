This issue is growing to be a real problem today.
Many machines are set to emulate IDE on the SATA to ease install of Windows XP or for other reasons.
Then your story happens and go ahead and complain but who knew that mattered (the IDE emulation.)
Changing this in the BIOS can cause the OS not to boot so the fallout continues to cause havoc.
Try this.
Use other SATA connections and read more about BIOS SATA IDE EMULATION or AHCI on google.
Sorry I can't put a tutorial here every time this comes up.
