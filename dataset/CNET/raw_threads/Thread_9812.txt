I'm getting what seems like HUGE amounts of Rx retries (like 60% of Rx packet count). Other devices on same router are fine so the problem's in the local PC. Any ideas? How do I begin to debug?

The errors look to be on the receive and since WiFi can be subject to issue such as interference and I won't hold a class here but will mention that a reflected signal can make a specific location unusable and the fix for that is well discussed why not try it at a location half the distance to the WiFi hotspot?
