Unfortunately, every version with Mac or Windows introduction still presents a new and longer leaning curve for all.
More bells and whistles that will never ever seem to stop.
Learning the bells is like buildind a sand castle.
Learning the whistles, is akin to stopping the tide from coming in and to prevent it from destroying your sand workNice try!
Until the next version.
