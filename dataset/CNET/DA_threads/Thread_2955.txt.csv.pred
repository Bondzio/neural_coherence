1.1.1	Iam looking at a Dell Dimension XPS,model MM8,PII...when I turn it on it Beeps...I pulled slot boards-cleaned connections -reinstalled...tried again ...sounds like 1p111p111p1 (p=pause)...also the monitor dosent activate.	St
1.1.2	this unit also has wires (2) coming fron a key lock and plugs into circuit board..whats this setup for ...and if the lock is on does it limit what I can do?	St
1.1.3	it's not turned on ...on this unit..but i have another problem child that Im not sure of	St
1.2.1	If I could make two guesses, I would say likely culprits are video card or memory.	St
1.2.2	A missing or defective video card will do such as will defective memory.	St
1.2.3	If you have more than one memory module, you can insert them one at a time into the first slot (usually slot &quot;0&quot;) and see if you can make it work.	St
1.2.4	Another common one I have seen with AGP video cards is they are not quite seated properly even though they seem to be.	St
1.2.5	Check this closely.	St
1.2.6	As for the key lock, these are sort of outdated but were used to disable the keyboard...sort of a cheap and ineffective security device.	St
1.2.7	Hope this helps.	St
1.3.1	dumb question probly...but the video card ...is that the slot card that the monitors serial connector mates to?...I did notice someone had pulled all the ram sticks out...I had a couple so I put 2 in ....but then I dont KNOW if their good...question about the keyboard locks..I think I had a chassis that had a keyboard error...if I pull the wires from their conn. would that disable it's function or would I have to install a jumper on the connection?	St
1.4.1	If the connector goes to a standard keyboard lock on the front panel of the PC, removing the connector from the MB only disables your ability to lock the keyboard.	St
1.4.2	A jumper would just lock it again so leave it disconnected.	Sug
1.4.3	If the RAM has been removed and not properly reinstalled, you will get beeps, especially if in slot &quot;0&quot;.	St
1.4.4	I recall something about the first 64k as being mandatory.	St
1.4.5	There is no beep code standard for MB manufacturers so, if you can, I would check for a support site for yours.	St
1.4.6	Most likely the BIOS chips are from AMI or Pheonix.	St
1.5.1	okay, so I did what I was suppose to do...count the beeps an research....I think I got it now...I told ya I'am not a computer wiz ...I had 2 sticks of memory I inserted in the ram slots 0&1...same problem...beeps...so after a cooling off period...I thot maybe those were bad...so I pulled them out an put another stick ....guess what ...it loads up ...yep, no beeps...I think I just stuck the wrong type of ram sticks in...not that I understand the difference between sdimm or dramm or whatever..	St
1.5.2	I guess the motto is...dont get frustrated..step away for a while..oh and that just because they fit the slot ...dosent mean there RIGHT.	St
