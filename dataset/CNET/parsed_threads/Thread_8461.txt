<s> I turned off my computer and monitors (2) and when returning a day later both monitors had the power light blinking. </s>
<s> Neither monitor would allow me to turn it off. </s>
<s> The only way to turn off the monitors so they don't blink is to unplug them from wall. </s>
<s> When plugging them back in they start blinking again. </s>
<s> Pushing the Off/On button on either monitor has to no effect. </s>
<s> I know the PC is booting up because of the various beeps I can hear, but the power light on both monitors just blink and they never turn on so I can see anything. </s>
<s> Suggestions/Recommendation? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> But you didn't share the make and model so I can't find a manual to check. </s>
<s> I have a Dell 1700FP and a IBM 9519-AG1 that have the same problem. </s>
<s> They were both being used on a Dell Optiplex GX110. </s>
<s> Since they are both doing the same thing I was wondering if they are stuck in EnergySaving/hiebernation mode or something like that? </s>
<s> We pushing the on/off button on either one nothing happens. </s>
<s> They just continue to blink. </s>
<s> No screen. </s>
<s> Doesn't even flicker. </s>
<s> Can only turn them off if I unplug them from the wall. </s>
<s> http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/monitors/1700FP/En/specs.htm#Power The manual does show that's how it supposed to work. </s>
<s> I'll let you find the other display's manual. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob </s>
