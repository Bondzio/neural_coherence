bob, actually, it's a small fat pillow that primarily just elevates the device and balances precariously above my legs while sitting in my lazyboy and it doesn't in any way block the vents which are in the rear at the hinge actually in a mbp.
and i know what you are talking about when you are talking about fuzz because i've dug out a lot of that crap myself when opening up laptops and desktops.
surprisingly when i opened my mbp to replace my failed hard drive though (after 4 years of service) it had very little fuzz or lint in it at all.
now, if this had been a winders machine that would have been an entirely different story.
