1.1.1	Upgraded my motherboard , processor and RAM about a week back .	St
1.1.2	After installing the hardware , initially everything ran ok on a freshly installed windows XP .	St
1.1.3	But as I started using the PC , updating windows etc , noticed a slight flickering of the screen on the right side .	St
1.1.4	This is limited only to about 1/3rd part of the screen on the right side .	St
1.1.5	The rest of the screen has no flicker .	St
1.1.6	Sometime it gets worse to the point that the right side becomes completely distorted with vertical lines and bars .	St
1.1.7	The side screen flicker also appears during boot start up screen ( where one has the option to press Del to enter setup ) , and in bios , safe mode too .	St
1.1.8	Some things I have tried till now.. 1 ) Uninstalled XP , formatted and installed Windows 7 ultimate SP1 & updated Windows 7 .	St

St
1.1.11	4 ) Connected my old CRT Samsung monitor , it shows no flicker..	St
1.1.12	LED monitor was working fine for months , the motherboard , CPU & RAM were assembled in the shop and packed up .	St
1.1.13	Only thing I did was unplug the LED monitor , installed the new motherboard in the cabinet and plugged it back in.. Only issue I can remember is first time after the fresh XP install , I installed the drivers for motherboard from the manufacturer 's disk provided .	St
1.1.14	Then I installed drivers and Magictune utility from the Samsung CD .	St
1.1.15	After installing Magictune , the PC started restarting again and again until I went into safe mode and uninstalled Magictune .	St
1.1.16	Could this have started the flickering..	St
1.1.17	Please advise .	St
