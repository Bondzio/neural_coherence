1.1.1	Approximately every 4 minutes ( I 've timed it ) I get a short blink or flicker in my primary display .	St
1.1.2	It is very short and only blinks/flickers just once , but it happens every 4 minutes .	St
1.1.3	It has blinked in my secondary display a few times , but almost everytime it blinks on the primary display .	St
1.1.4	And it only blinks on one display , not both displays at the same time .	St
1.1.5	I have disabled my virus software and that did n't help .	St
1.1.6	I do n't have any games , so it 's not game related .	St
1.1.7	It happens no matter what software I 'm running .	St
1.1.8	I can have only Windows open , and it happens .	St
1.1.9	I can sit and watch the monitor and it blinks when I 'm doing nothing on the computer .	St
1.1.10	But it 's 4 minutes between each blink .	St
1.1.11	It does n't make any difference if the system has just started , or if I 've had it on for 4 hours .	St
1.1.12	Strange ?	Ques
1.1.13	Anyone heard of anything like this ?	Ques
1.1.14	ASUS P5W DH Deluxe Intel Core 2 Extreme x6800 Dual Dell 24 & quot ; LCD using DVI connection ( 2407 WFP wide screen ) ATI FireGL V7350 Windows XP 64bit X-Fi Fatal1ty Corsair XMS2-C6400 - 4MB	St
1.2.1	You might want to open task manager , performance tab and see if there is a spike in CPU usage .	St
1.2.2	The only other thing that comes to mind is a possible momentary spike or decrease in your house electrical supply , how old is the Surge protector ?	Ques
1.2.3	They to can go bad after a few years of use .	St
1.3.1	If you can , swap monitor using the video card setting for mon # 1 and mon # 2 and see what happens ( or cards ) .	St
1.3.2	If the mon # 1 continues to blink then very possible the video card is at fault .	St
1.3.3	If the problem swaps over to the mon # 2 on a reg .	St
1.3.4	basis , then it maybe a mon .	St
1.3.5	fault .	St
1.3.6	You can also , remove one monitor and check results .	St
1.3.7	The video card maybe experiencing too much stress and it finally blinks but recovers quickly .	St
1.3.8	Since , every now and then both mons .	St
1.3.9	experience a blink , it seems like the video card .	St
1.3.10	You remove the side cover and place a household fan to blow-in to help cool it .	St
1.3.11	If it seems to settle down , then you got a heat problem .	St
1.3.12	Maybe not the video card but the system as well .	St
1.3.13	Alot of heat stress is had on better systems .	St
1.3.14	Now only that , but the video or gpu is very dependent on good stable power .	St
1.3.15	You maybe taxing too much even though it seems timed , some componet is being stressed and a blink is the result .	St
1.3.16	if that 's the case , it can only get worst and become very apparent over time .	St
1.3.17	If all else fails , remove the video card ( any one ) and then use only one monitor and see how it behaves .	St
1.3.18	Last , ot cpould be that the scanning is just too much and it corrects itself , a possible new driver maybe the only hope .	St
1.3.19	If you address this problem with the video ( s ) car maker for any clues or tips .	St
1.3.20	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Good suggestion , I 'll swap the monitors around see if the problem follows with the monitor .	St
1.4.2	It 's probably not heat related , since it starts happening from a cold system .	St
1.4.3	I have four 120mm case fans , and the graphic card has its own enclosed cooling fan .	St
1.4.4	CPU is water cooled and I think it could make ice cubes if asked to do so .	St
1.4.5	This is a totally new system less than 6 months old .	St
1.4.6	It has a 850 watt PSU , so it 's probably getting enough power .	St
1.4.7	I 'll swap the monitors around , and check for new display drivers , and see what happens .	St
1.4.8	If I had a spare graphics card I would give that a try , but that darn FireGL 7350 broke the bank , So far , all ATI has offered , was to send me links to their trouble shooting pages .	St
1.4.9	Thanks for your help	St
1.5.1	Hi there , I 've got a similar problem , but my computer is totally different from yours .	St
1.5.2	Here are my specs .	St
1.5.3	Purchased new : December 2004 Dell Precision 670 Intel Xeon 3.0 GHz , Dual processor ( Not dual core . )	St
1.5.4	XP Pro with 4GB RAM NVidia Quadro FX 3400 256MB , Dual DVI Dual Dell 2001FP flat panel monitors Blinking Characteristics : -My blinking is sporadic , though not entirely unpredictable .	St
1.5.5	-Ive had this problem for more than a year .	St
1.5.6	-It happens only on one monitor .	St
1.5.7	On my system it is always monitor 2 that blinks .	St
1.5.8	I use this monitor with extended desktop .	St
1.5.9	-I agree a blink seems to last the same amount of time as a monitor re-sync , as though something in the system causes a disturbance or change in the graphics , triggering a re-sync .	St
1.5.10	I just retested this by resetting the resolution on one monitor and the duration of the blink was identical to that of the problem blink .	St
1.5.11	-After a blink the monitor appears ever so slightly fuzzier , as though it has switched to a different mode .	St
1.5.12	Fonts that were razor sharp become dithered .	St
1.5.13	Turning the monitor off momentarily sharpens it back up .	St
1.5.14	-Sometimes it 's just one or a few blinks , seconds or minutes apart .	St
1.5.15	Sometimes it 's a ferocious blink-storm with less than a second between blinks .	St
1.5.16	I can go for days with no blinks , and other times it happens several times a day .	St
1.5.17	Causes/Triggers : -On my system it is always triggered , though sporadically , by various software applications : -- ArcGIS ( Mapping software ) Here I have a specific map that always triggers a blink .	St
1.5.18	-- Microsoft Outlook Occasionally causes blinks , possibly related to specific e-mails with specific graphic objects .	St
1.5.19	-- Cox Webmail Occasionally causes blinks , possibly related to web-pages or e-mails with specific graphic objects .	St
1.5.20	-- Occasional web pages .	St
1.5.21	Occasionally causes blinks , possibly related to web page content with specific graphic objects .	St
1.5.22	-It is not related to monitor hardware failure .	St
1.5.23	I 've swapped my monitors and swapped my blinking monitor with a coworker 's identical monitor , and the problem still occurs .	St
1.5.24	The problem is in the PC .	St
1.5.25	-It does not appear to be caused by heat/electrical problem or length of time that the PC has been running .	St
1.5.26	-By the way , without going into too much detail here , other weird things sometimes happen with dual monitors , indicating that some software doesnt really know how to deal with dual monitor systems , or exactly what to do when its window is in the second monitor on the extended desktop .	St
1.5.27	For example , sometimes pop-ups for apps whose windows are in monitor 2 show up in monitor 1 .	St
1.5.28	-Its possible that a piece of the monitor 2 circuitry on the graphics card has a problem , and that , combined with demanding software , could be a trigger .	St
1.5.29	However , my intuition is that this isnt the problem , since software by itself is able to cause so many other problems with dual monitor systems .	St
1.5.30	Work-around/Treatment : -The treatment is always to use the mouse to grab the window with the offending software and move it to the non-blinking monitor .	St
1.5.31	This stops the blinking immediately with 100 % success .	St
1.5.32	-Ive tried updating my graphics drivers more than once , but with no change , improvement or worsening of the problem .	St
1.5.33	-My computer is under warranty with Dell , so I suppose I could have them replace the card , but I hate to have them replace the card if the problem has another cause .	St
1.5.34	( On the other hand , even if its not directly their fault , theyre making money off of selling these systems , and if there are major generic problems like this then they should play a role in working with the industry to get through this , and if that means replacing the graphics cards in an effort to determine where the problem lies , then that seems fitting . )	St
1.5.35	Explanation ?	Ques
1.5.36	It would appear that some graphic objects of the software that Ive mentioned do something to trigger this problem .	St
1.5.37	I would bet that they use components of commonly used graphics libraries or subsystems , like DirectX , OpenGL , etc , and that it is here that the problem lies .	St
1.5.38	Someone who knows more than I do should address this issue .	St
1.5.39	David	St
1.6.1	I feel certain that about three or four months ago I read that Dell was having problems with somre of their monitorts , and dragged their feet admitting to it to customers .	St
1.7.1	I tried a little research and a problem may lie with little video ram and/or scanning modes .	St
1.7.2	Under the scanning setting make sure the mon1 is 60Hz and the mon2 is 75hz , ( reverse if possible ) make sure both are saved and check results .	St
1.7.3	If the problem lessens or the blinking is reduced , you have a scanning issue .	St
1.7.4	If a small amount of video ram is present , understand when higher setting are used the & quot ; shared & quot ; video ram is used between two monitors .	St
1.7.5	Video ram is faster than system and the tell-tale sign is a blink or worsing of display ( s ) .	St
1.7.6	The system ca n't keep up plus its dealing with two monitors .	St
1.7.7	Increase video ram ( if laptop ) or replace with a new card having more ram .	St
1.7.8	Last , I mentioned power in the other post , which can be the PSU , but also the AC outlet .	St
1.7.9	Unlike other problems , if video goes awry , you can see if if only for moment or more permanently when it fails , etc .	St
1.7.10	Thus , the system and video card maybe doing everything right , but a slight AC glitch can cause a problem .	St
1.7.11	Try using separate AC outlets of a *different* AC circuit and see if things improve .	St
1.7.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.8.1	Thanks Willy , I 'll cut to the chase .	St
1.8.2	My normal screen resolution is 1600x1200 .	St
1.8.3	I 've just discovered that changing to 1280x1024 stops the blinking .	St
1.8.4	However , I 'm not prepared to reduce the screen resolution just to fix the problem , since I can just move the offending software to the non-blinking monitor .	St
1.8.5	Regarding your testing suggestions : -Scanning modes .	St
1.8.6	I 'm not able to test this .	St
1.8.7	When I open Display Settings , the only valid option that it offers me is 60hz .	St
1.8.8	Even when I reset to a lower resolution it only offers me 60hz .	St
1.8.9	-Video RAM .	St
1.8.10	As listed in my previous post I have a high-performance graphics adapter with 256MB of video RAM .	St
1.8.11	So insufficient RAM is not the problem .	St
1.8.12	But thanks anyway .	Polite
1.8.13	-Power .	St
1.8.14	I have an APC 800VA UPS so power is conditioned and protected .	St
1.8.15	Power is not a problem .	St
1.8.16	Any more ideas ?	Ques
1.8.17	Thanks again , David	St
1.9.1	Thanks Ray .	St
1.9.2	Might be , but it would have to be all of the monitors that I 've tested , which are same model , and it would still have to involve some sort of problem/interaction with the graphic card since it only happens on the secondary monitor output .	St
1.9.3	Thanks , David	St
