<s> I'm looking to buy a video & capture card combo (e.g. </s>
<s> ATI All-in-Wonder or similar). </s>
<s> My friend has the old 128MB AGP version and it works for them and from what I've seen it's gotten great reviews. </s>
<s> But I want 256MB & I need the PCI-E format. </s>
<s> Currently I have a very cheapo capture card and video card and wish to upgrade both at the same time. </s>
<s> I need to get a 256MB 2006 PCI-E version of the card (I don't have an AGP slot), but it seems to have gotten more bad reviews than good. </s>
<s> I don't know of any other options for the same combo technology either. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any comments on this card (2006 PCI-E version) or any other suggestions to getting another combo card for roughly the same price? </s>
<s> I am also worried about its integration w/ WinXP MCE 2005. </s>
<s> Your new card will mention MCE or it won't be compatible. </s>
<s> MCE is that way. </s>
<s> Also I've regretted combo VGA and capture cards. </s>
<s> I no longer do that. </s>

<s> What do you regret about getting the combo, just a bad experience, or inefficient, or something else? </s>
<s> Right now I have a Powercolor Tul Theater 550 PRO TV Tuner with on board nVidia 6100...so I would think I'd only be able to move up even if it's s combo. </s>
<s> Not saying I couldn't be wrong though... </s>
<s> With the next upgrade I would lose the TV card. </s>
<s> Since picking up the ATI and Hauppauge cards I haven't had to replace them. </s>
<s> The cards also tended to be larger and hotter. </s>
<s> And there is so little difference in SD TV card image quality that it's not worth changing. </s>
<s> You can read and see this issue as you tune a HDTV to SD programming. </s>
<s> All the warts show up. </s>
