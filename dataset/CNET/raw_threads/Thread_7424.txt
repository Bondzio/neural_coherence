R-click the system monitor screen and select &quot;Add Counters.&quot; Select, &quot;Select counters from computer&quot; and specify the computer you want to monitor. Choose the performance object (Network Interface) and counters (Current Bandwidth) you want to use. After you add it, you can right click and select properties to change the display color.
