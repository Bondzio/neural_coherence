<s> Cannot play any video type games. </s>
<s> Any advice please? </s>
<s> My PC is 'tiny' no disk and did not set any dates to restore to so cannot restore to factory settings. </s>
<s> HELP! </s>
<s> Have you installed the video card drivers? </s>
<s> I assume that you have installed all the Windows XP service packs? </s>
<s> Motherboard chipset drivers? </s>
<s> Latest Direct X? </s>
<s> Give us your system spec's & let us know what you have installed & we will be glad to help. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>
<s> You also need to install drivers for the video card. </s>
<s> If you don't have a CD with drivers, you can download them from the website of the card's manufacturer. </s>
<s> IE: If it's an ATI card, download drivers from the ATI website . </s>
<s> If it's an nVidia card, download drivers from the [url=http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html]nVidia website[/url. </s>
