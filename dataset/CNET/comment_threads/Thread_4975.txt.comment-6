If you want to you HDMI then get a video card that has HDMI port.
From what I gather on this thread that's what you're left with.
If there is some adapter, it may not be as cheap or as ready as a video card with the HDMI port.
Don't make this complicated at least that's the direction I'll go.
If you plan to buy another PC, the new video card would be cheaper.
I suggest a ATI 4350 or similar.
