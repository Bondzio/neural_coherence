1.1.1	I am buying a new computer .	St
1.1.2	I will be running a small web design company on the computer , playing somewhat highly graphical games , and doing a lot of multimedia work .	St
1.1.3	I need to know which is the better buy , and what will last me longer .	St
1.1.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.1.5	INTEL http : //www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp ? sku_id=0665000FS10070493 & catid=10607 & logon= & langid=EN AMD http : //www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp ? sku_id=0665000FS10072977 & catid=10607 & logon= & langid=EN # MoreInfo Oh , and I have heard that if I buy a very good graphics card for the Intel , I would have great gaming and multimedia , is that true ?	Ques
1.1.6	Or would I need the AMD ?	Ques
1.2.1	well i have always been an amd man they serve me well with gaming rite now i have an amd sempron 2500+ which is 1.4ghz and 768mb of ram my games are good i havent used pentuim d yet i only used pentuim4 but the amd seems to be a little better but if its being used for mohaa and bf2 and hl2 i 'd go with amd i hope this helps	St
1.3.1	AMD X2 dual destroys the Pentium D , and I 'm not alone in this opinion .	St
1.3.2	I 've got a the X2 and it is sweet .	St
1.3.3	I 'd been a little concerned that these pre-config 's might not meet your needs .	St
1.3.4	I 'd like to learn what the Power Supply is rated at , you 'll want at LEAST 350W , 420W or higher would be good , 500+W is best .	St
1.3.5	The graphics card may need an upgrade if you do heavy graphics for web ( like manipulation in Photoshop ) and for your gaming needs .	St
1.3.6	That could be a few hundred bones alone .	St
1.3.7	I 'd DEFINITELY want 10/100/1000 Base-T ethernet if you do web development for a living .	St
1.3.8	Uploading sites would blaze with CAT7 speed , right ?	Ques
1.3.9	That 's a mobo and ethernet card issue I 'd consider , for now and for future needs .	St
1.3.10	I 'd also wonder if you have enough drive bays ( internal and external ) for all your needs .	St
1.3.11	Consider Monarch Computing for a more customized build .	St
1.3.12	You might pay a few hundred extra up front , but it is for value in all the right places .	St
1.3.13	Or you may be upgrading later with heavy limitations like your mobo and expansion slots .	St
1.3.14	You can search my posts/profile to read about my PC rig I built for $ 2300 including everything : operating system , full rig , monitor , keyboard , etc .	St
1.3.15	Good luck , cheers .	Polite
1.4.1	I think for the money this is the best deal on the market .	St
1.4.2	Gateway 3800+ Desktop with 19 '' Monitor , Printer , Cable & Surge Protector http : //www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp ? productCategoryId=cat01173 & id=pcmprd52400050006 & skuId=999952200050006 & type=product & count=2	St
1.5.1	Dell , HP , Gateway , etc .	St
1.5.2	all install bloatware on their computers , which clogs the hard drive , uses system RAM , and slows the machine down overall .	St
1.5.3	They also put crappy power supplies which will need to be replaced if you want a good graphics card .	St
1.5.4	The cases are badly designed , and there is a risk of the computer overheating .	St
1.5.5	If you build your own , you can choose exactly what components you want , right down to which CPU cooler you prefer .	St
1.5.6	You 'll know that the components are quality ; after all , you picked them .	St
1.5.7	If you think you 're capable of building , post again with your budget , and I 'll find a setup for you .	St
