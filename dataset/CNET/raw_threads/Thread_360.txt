This is my first PC build ever, I've been thinking about it for months, asking people what they think about it, and i'm about ready to finalize. However I would like to run this by you guys and ask a few specific questions. I will list all the parts and links to Newegg to make this a little bit easier for someone looking at the thread, so they don't have to go and search it themselves Case: Cooler Master HAF 912 http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119233 CPU: Intel Core i5-3570k http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116504 GPU: ASUS GTX 670 http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233202 &lt;div&gt; MOBO: ASRock Z77 Pro3 LGA 1155 etc etc etc http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136533 &lt;div&gt; RAM: Corsair XMS3 8gb (2x 4gb) http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233202 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt; HDD: Western Digital Caviar WD1002FAEX 1TB http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136533 Heatsink (I plan to OC in the future, not sure how much): Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835103099 Wireless Adapter: ASUS PCE-N15 http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833320074 That's all I have picked out so far. Feel free to make suggestions on changes I can possibly make. I do have a few specific questions though 1) Will that motherboard work for what I have? 1a) How many USB ports will it have available.. I need around 4-5 total to plug in all of my regular peripherals 1b) I have a headset that has surround sound. On the headset there is the classical pink and green 3.5mm jacks. It also has a black one and an orange one, both of which I see on this motherboard. Will it give me the true surround sound or will I have to buy a soundcard as well? 2) Will I need to buy any extra cables whether it be for power or data transfer, or will what I have selected come with it 3) With the heatsink that I have picked out, how far would I be able to OC the CPU (Nothing extreme, just to get a little bit of extra juice out of it). I have never done it before, so I don't know about voltages and stuff.. Would something like 4.2ghz be alright to OC to and still be able to run at a low temperature using that heatsink? All in all the computer looks to be between about $1225.00 and $1300.00 depending on where I buy it and shipping costs etc. If you have any input, don't hesitate. Please. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

Let me steal from a recent reply. &quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. &quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html You've done a great job by focusing on the GPU since you want to game. If I was to show concerns it's the following. 1. Didn't find a power supply. Maybe I missed it. Nod to SINGLE RAIL PSUs unless you know about Amperes, rails and such. 2. WiFi. Gamers tend to have a love hate of this. Be sure you have it wired if you want to keep your hair. Bob

Well any parts; PC Power and Cooling Silencer MK III 600W http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817703036 As for the WiFi, with my current laptop setup I get a consistent 1.6mb/s download speed from my bedroom. Problem is to go wired, I would have to tunnel a wire from my basement all the way into my bedroom by my desk, so unfortunately I'm stuck with the WiFi

But I digress. +12V@46A means you won't be worried about Amperes on that rail. Nice choice. And no, I don't expect this to require any more cables. Bob

Does the GPU not go in that? This is terribly confusing to me.

The list in your top post looks incorrect. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157297 shows it had 2 other PCIe slots. The x1 slot should be fine for this card. The x16 slot is for your video card. Bob
