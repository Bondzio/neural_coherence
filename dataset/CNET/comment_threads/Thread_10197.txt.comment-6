From the mouth of the unnatural person Seiko Epson Corporation http://files.support.epson.com/txt/pho785/pho785f1.txt Q: Can the Epson ink cartridges be refilled or can 3rd party ink cartridges be used without voiding the warranty?
A: The ink cartridge cannot be refilled.
The ink cartridge has embedded within it, a 'Smart Chip' that electronically detects the ink levels and usage.
Once the ink has run out, the cartridge will no longer operate and needs to be replaced.
Refilling the ink cartridge will not reset the electronic counter on the chip.
Using non-Epson products will not void the warranty, however these products cause a failure, the repair will not be covered under warranty.
