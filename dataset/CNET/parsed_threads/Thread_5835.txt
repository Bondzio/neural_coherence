<s> My Dell laptop has been used some years, and it seems something wrong with the laptop ac adapter, so I bought a new Dell PA-12 AC Adapter from http://www.papatek.com/Dell-Adapter/Dell-PA-12-AC-Adapter-19.5V-3.34A.html , the new one is good, but I still want to know, if the old one can be repaired, who can give some advice? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Since you ask, I am going to assumed that you will be taken it to a repair shop. </s>
<s> My guess is that you won't be able to do it for under $10 (if it is something obvious and simple) and really hurting for business. </s>
<s> But who knows..give it a shot </s>
<s> You might want to provide us with more details on your old adapter because not all faults are repairable. </s>
<s> However, if you don't mind the hassle of bringing it down to a repair shop to check it out, then just do so. </s>
<s> They will be able to advice you whether your adapter is repairable and at what cost. </s>
<s> At the end of the day you will need to decide whether it's worth while to fix it. </s>
