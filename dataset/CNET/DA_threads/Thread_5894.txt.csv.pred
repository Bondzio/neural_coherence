1.1.1	Hi everyone !	St
1.1.2	So , I pulled a LED out of an old case of mine just to realize it is a p led hook up .	St
1.1.3	Normally , I would experiment a bit .	St
1.1.4	However , as this is my only computer at the moment I do n't really want to take the chances of messing too much up hardware wise .	St
1.1.5	Question : Could I use a 3 pin connector to hook up a + and - p led ?	Ques
1.1.6	Or is there a more simple way ?	Ques
1.1.7	Any way at all ?	Ques
1.1.8	Splicing wires ?	Ques
1.1.9	( the p led slots on my mobo are already filled ) I 've tried google but nothing is really pinpointing what I need to know .	St
1.1.10	I would love to find a site that explains the current from the psu a bit .	St
1.1.11	At the moment I really have no clue what the red/black/and yellow wires of my 3-pins mean specifically but I would love to ( I am just now starting to mess with wiring .	St
1.1.12	I normally just strayed from that ) .	St
1.1.13	Thanks in advance all !	St
1.2.1	But if you mean & quot ; power & quot ; LED , I 'd say there 's not a problem if you get the polarity mixed up .	St
1.2.2	You 've got a 50-50 chance of getting it right .	St
1.2.3	If plug these into a circuit designed for LED use , they are current limited .	St
1.2.4	An LED , being a diode , will block current flow in one direction and conduct in the other after reaching some voltage threshold .	St
1.2.5	But you 'd really have to try hard to damage something .	St
1.2.6	As far as color codes and voltages , you 'll want the +5v to ground .	St
1.2.7	This will be red to black .	St
1.2.8	Yellow is 12v .	St
1.2.9	It would be good if you had a DVM to verify these , however .	Polite
1.2.10	If this does n't help , maybe you can explain what you 're trying to use this LED for .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the response !	St
1.3.2	Well what I have now is a LED light with the connectors being 1 + pled and 1 - LED on a green and black wire respectively .	St
1.3.3	My problem is that the motherboard power led slots are filled .	St
1.3.4	I 'm more or less just wondering if there is another way I could still hook them up .	St
1.3.5	Possibly with a 3-pin connector ?	Ques
1.3.6	Were you saying I could hook the + power led up to the red wire of a 3 pin for +5v ?	Ques
1.4.1	I was wondering what the LED was intended to do .	St
1.4.2	This is why I asked if it was a & quot ; power & quot ; LED or some other indicator .	St
1.4.3	I know some folks just use them for lighting effects but you did n't mention that .	St
1.4.4	I 've not heard of MB & quot ; power led slots & quot ; but I know of fan ports which use 3 wires ... the third being for auto speed control .	St
1.4.5	I do know how to make LEDs light up and it only needs the two lead wires and a power source and current limiter .	St
1.4.6	The current limiter is just a resistor in series with the LED .	St
1.4.7	You can either use an LED resistor calculator or trial and error .	St
1.4.8	Of course an LED is polarized so only works when properly biased .	St
1.4.9	You need to figure out which is + and - but you can also do that by just applying a very small voltage from some standard 1.5 v battery to see what orientation works .	St
1.5.1	Awesome , I 'll play around with that .	St
1.5.2	Sorry I misunderstood you .	St
1.5.3	I 'm trying to use it as just a case light till I can get my other one in .	St
1.6.1	I like to repeat Steven 's ? , what is that LED suppose to do ?	Ques
1.6.2	I assume you have all connections already present that may go to some LED now , so any actual spare LED connection is not present , unless its not used or no place to be used .	St
1.6.3	You can use a 9V battery to test the leads of a LED provided a connection can be made .	St
1.6.4	I would assume you plan to use some wiring from the mtrbd .	St
1.6.5	to attach an LED or make wiring to attach LED .	St
1.6.6	This in turn suggests what that connection is suppose to do .	St
1.6.7	Your mtrbd .	St
1.6.8	manual should explain any connection provided what they do .	Sug
1.6.9	If provided it may dwell into actual pin-to-pin what each does or its value .	St
1.6.10	If unknown but does explain its an audio type connection , like SPIF , then look-up ( google ) SPIF for its standard configuration , same for USB , etc .	St
1.6.11	Please further explain your quest as to what the final need for the LED usage .	Sug
1.6.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
