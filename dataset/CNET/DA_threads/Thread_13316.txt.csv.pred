1.1.1	My hard disk and graphics card seem to get quite hot after only a few minutes of operation .	St
1.1.2	My PC has been suffering from overheating problems for a few weeks now and I have installed a new fan , but the problem still persists ( the PC will turn off after things get 'too ' hot ) .	St
1.1.3	My graphics card , is so hot that I ca n't actually touch it ( in operation ) without getting a slight burn !	St
1.1.4	The hard disk is not as hot , but still feels unnecessarily hot .	St
1.1.5	Is this normal ?	Ques
1.1.6	The problem ceases when I use a household fan , so should I invest in a more expensive , more powerful fan ?	Ques
1.1.7	If so , should it act as an 'exhaust ' or should it blow in air ?	Ques
1.1.8	I only have space for a fan at the back on the top , just under the PSU .	St
1.1.9	Apologies for the rather long post , and any help would be greatly appreciated Thanks , Marc	St
1.2.1	The machine 's maker ?	Ques
1.2.2	Some smaller shops do n't test for proper airflow or skimp on a needed fan .	St
1.2.3	You did n't tell if you are the designer .	St
1.2.4	If so , you get to solve heat buildup issues if your case fails to expel the heat .	St
1.2.5	Common fixes are to cut new exhaust holes , fit a few more fans or just leave the case cover off .	St
1.2.6	There is no ready to use formula for this , but I endorse making the system maker aware of the issue and letting them resolve it ( as no cost ) first .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	I do n't know if you 've heard of & quot ; Tiny & quot ; ... they were a UK-based company that did n't too well , so I 'm no longer covered by them .	St
1.3.2	In any case , I 'm well past my guarantee 's duration .	St
1.3.3	A friend has told me it may be the motherboard that is messed up , but I ca n't afford investing in that so I 'm likely to just buy a couple of more fans .	St
1.3.4	I have tried leavin the cover off but that has n't solved it .	St
1.4.1	The bad motherboard capacitors issue is one that creates a lot of heat and issues .	St
1.4.2	You should inspect for this issue since fans wo n't cure it .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	also a place for a front fan .	St
1.5.2	This should pull air in .	St
1.5.3	The rear fan should be an exhaust .	St
1.5.4	For the rear fan , and your problem put in a 92MM fan if possible .	St
1.5.5	Seems that you may in England , else I could point you to a fan at cyberguys that is a very high rpm fan .	St
1.5.6	remember high rpm = more noise .	St
1.5.7	Yes video cards get hot as hades .	St
1.5.8	You need to dress the cables to make a minimum of restriction to airflow .	St
1.5.9	You could also use more of a dynamic flow of air , by cutting a hole in the side panel , more of less in line with the CPU/HSF , and install a fan that blows air in .	St
1.5.10	This will stir things up .	St
1.5.11	If your system is shutting down due to heat look your CPU 's HSF over closely .	St
1.5.12	It may not be rotating fast enough .	St
1.5.13	If the top of the case were readily accessible placing an exhaust fan in it is a very effective solution .	St
1.6.1	I wish there was , but there is n't ...	St
1.6.2	I 've been told I have a crap case !	St
1.6.3	I guess it 's true ... before , I could have a household fan blowing into it and that would stop the blue screen from appearing , but just now it seems to have happened again even with this fan blowing in .	St
1.6.4	It appears the problem is getting worse and worryingly more frequent Now I 'm concerned this is n't even an overheating problem since my previous temporary solution does n't even work now !	St
1.6.5	I 've replaced the PSU , and a friend of mine will lend me a processor and graphics card so that I can work out if it 's anything to do with those .	St
1.6.6	This same friend suggested it could be a problem with the motherboard , and I 'm not looking fwd to replacing that !	St
1.6.7	Any tips on replacing a motherboard ?	Ques
1.7.1	securely to the CPU ? ? ?	Ques
1.7.2	I have just run into two cases where one of the platic clips broke and reduced the tension between the HSF and CPU [ yes actually it is compression , the tension is in the clips .	St
1.7.3	LOL ] .	St
1.7.4	Wht type mobo ? ?	Ques
1.7.5	Is it a micro ATX ? ? ?	Ques
1.7.6	They have a great dea ; l at newegg every few days for an Aspire case with 350 watt supply $ 58 and free shipping .	St
1.7.7	If installing mobo into a new case , we can provide that info .	St
1.7.8	For putting in an existing case , we can also help .	St
1.7.9	just some differences to discuss .	St
1.7.10	If your CPU is getting too hot , I 'm not keen on blaming it on the mobo .	St
1.7.11	Was thermal compound put between the HSF base and the CPU surface ? ? ?	Ques
1.7.12	Any chance that the HSF is on 180 degrees out ? ?	Ques
1.7.13	The CPU is NOT centered on the HSF , there is only one CORRECT orientation for the HSF .	St
1.8.1	See http : //www.2cooltek.com/blow2.html for a step by step guide to blowholes .	St
1.8.2	Bob	St
1.9.1	The HSF is definitely clamped securely to the CPU , and the mobo is a micro ATX , but like you suggested , it might not be the mobo and I should try out other things 1st I 'm not sure what thermal compound is but there was a sticky-ish white residue both on the HSF base and CPU surface ... what does that mean ?	Ques
1.9.2	I 'm sure that the orientation of both the CPU and HSF is fine , since there is only one way they can fit .	St
1.9.3	That blowhole idea looked interesting ... scary but interesting !	Polite
1.10.1	1 .	St
1.10.2	Get a turbine fan its a fan that uses a PCI port to suck air out .	St
1.10.3	If your graphic card constantly over heats , seat one of these fans on the port above your graphic card .	St
1.10.4	2 .	St
1.10.5	Make sure your Graphics Card has a Heatsink AND a fan on top of the heatsink If it doesnt , you can pick up a small fan at a computer junk store or at stores like Fry 's Electronics .	St
1.10.6	3 .	St
1.10.7	You need more then one fan and your Powersupply doesnt really count as a system fan .	St
1.10.8	Try to have atleast one fan sucking air in and sucking air out .	St
1.10.9	4 .	St
1.10.10	To really know how hot your computer is getting when your running windwos [ and ca n't access the bios ] get a PC Monitoring System like Cooler Masters : Aerogate II .	St
1.10.11	Not only does it let you monitor the air temperature of 4 seperate computer componenets such as CPU , Graphic Board , Hard Drive , and Case { in general } , it also acts as a fan controller .	St
1.10.12	It even tell you how fast your fans are spinning [ rpm ] and lets you adjust that speed .	St
1.10.13	5 .	St
1.10.14	If your case cant support more then 1 fan , trying looking at new cases .	St
1.10.15	Most new mid ranged cases [ $ 50- $ 80 ] today can support beyond 2 fans .	St
1.10.16	My XDreamer Case can support 5 fans : 1 on the side , 2 in the front , 1 in the back , and 1 on the top of the case [ sunroof ] .	St
1.11.1	Really should n't be oozing out but ? ? ?	Ques
1.11.2	Thethermakl paste coating should be very thin .	St
1.11.3	Too big a glob can cause to impede heat transfer rather than help it .	St
1.11.4	Maybe get another HSF with a larger HS and faster fan [ more noise LOL ] [ make sure it will fit .	St
1.11.5	It just seems that possibly the fan might not be running fast enough .	St
1.11.6	The micro ATX case is rather small so I can see why cooling can be a problem .	St
1.11.7	The fact that case open and external fan did n't keep it cool enough , does sound unusual .	St
1.11.8	Do n't have too powerful a fan [ your house fan ] blow directly at the CPU 's HSF because it could actually slow the HSF down .	St
1.11.9	Have it blow on the video card and memory sticks .	St
1.11.10	There are other reasons for a system shutting down .	St
1.11.11	One is the bulging or leaking capacitors .	St
1.12.1	I have one awaiting a decision on what to put in it .	St
1.12.2	Too much overkill for what I have built lately .	St
1.13.1	my pc does this too i dunno what to do i have a normal fan home fan on it as well and it still over heats ive bought this week a new fan .	St
1.13.2	my pc gets to about 50degrees 122 farentheit is it actually heat that makes it crash im not sure but ill update you when i got my new fan .	St
1.13.3	chow	St
1.14.1	you should allow the interior air of the case get over 100 F. What room temperature do you live in ? ? ?	Ques
1.14.2	When you talk temperature let 's be very specific whether we are talking CPU temp or internal ambient air .	St
1.14.3	If you have 122 F ambient internal something is drastically wrong .	St
1.14.4	You have virtually no airflow .	St
1.14.5	Any chance that the fans are fighting each other rather than creating airflow ? ?	Ques
1.14.6	?	Ques
1.15.1	The first thing I 'd check is the air temp that your power supply is pumping out .	St
1.15.2	The power supply is probably , depending on the config , the biggest producer of ambient air temp increase inside your case .	St
1.15.3	Most people fail to realize that an extremely dirty power supply willl produce far more heat than a clean one , and if it 's a single fan unit , the cooling effect of the fan maybe insufficient .	St
1.15.4	If you have more than just the power supply venting air to the outside , check the temp of the air the other fans are expelling .	St
1.15.5	The power supply should be the only expelling fan with a temp markedly warmer than room temp .	St
1.15.6	Being a bit of a cooling freak ( I have sixteen rotating fans and a water block cooler in my Thermaltake Xaser II ) my suggestion to anyone is to start with a reputable dual fan PSU .	St
