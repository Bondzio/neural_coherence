i have a shared canon MP970 attached to my Hp desk station that runs windows vista.
i have an HP laptop that also runs vista.
i have shared the printer and i can print fine when connected wirelessly.
however, then i connect through the eithernet cable, it will not print.
everything else seems to work fine except printing.
i have tried several location, tried reistalling the printer etc and i feel i must have overlooked something simple.
my router is a D-Link DIR-655 N(1. any help would be appreciated
