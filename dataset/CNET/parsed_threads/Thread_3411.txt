<s> I know that the wireless not working is an oft asked question, but I have browsed through what I thought were relevant threads and also the first sticky thread and I can't find what I'm doing wrong (or maybe it's there somewhere, but I have no idea how to use the solutions given?). </s>
<s> Hopefully someone can help me out or point me in the right direction. </s>
<s> I have set up my network in the suggested way in the sticky thread, with the exception of setting the WPA. </s>
<s> When I select the WPA option, it doesn't give me any place to input a password? </s>
<s> So I have it set on the WEP-64 bits (umm..is that bad?). </s>
<s> It is now wall --&gt; cable modem --&gt; wireless router --&gt; pc/laptop It all worked fine before, until I formatted my PC. </s>
<s> I must have mucked around with some settings and since the format, I can't connect my laptop to the router wirelessly. </s>
<s> When I plug my PC to the router with an ethernet cable, it works fine, same with the laptop. </s>
<s> On my laptop, I can see the SSID there when I search for networks, but it fails to connect because it 'is not receiving a response from the router or access point'. </s>
<s> I have attempted unplugging and replugging, and powering off and on, and resetting both the modem and the router. </s>
<s> I've tried reinstalling the driver and utilities. </s>
<s> I'm fairly certain it's something in the settings of the router that I've got wrong, rather than the router being broken, as it was working fine before the format. </s>
<s> I tried my brothers laptop as well, and it also couldn't connect because there was no reponse. </s>
<s> The modem is a Motorola SB5101, the router is a Diamond Digital R100. </s>
<s> My PC is running on XP and my laptop is running on Vista. </s>
<s> Let me know if there's any other info needed? </s>
<s> Any help would be much appreciated, this is driving me insane. </s>
<s> Head out and test the laptop at a free wifi hotspot. </s>
<s> If that works I reset the router to factory settings and then set it up AGAIN per our forum sticky. </s>
<s> Without that test you're never sure where the issue is. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip - however I forgot to mention, I can connect to someone elses (a neighbour?) </s>
<s> unsecured wireless on my laptop without any issues. </s>
<s> Is that kind of the same as testing it at a free wifi hotspot...? </s>
<s> Having done that, I've tried resetting the router several times already and gone through the setup process as per the sticky and using the manual. </s>
<s> The lights are all blinking as normal, too. </s>
<s> Try disabling the security features first. </s>
<s> Go with an open system. </s>
<s> You'll need a wired connection to the router to do this. </s>
<s> Make sure it will handle giving out DHCP addresses. </s>
<s> On you laptop, if you are trying to use the wireless card's configuration utility, I suggest using the Windows one instead. </s>
<s> Make sure that, if your router handles the IP addresses, your laptop's wireless device is set to DHCP. </s>
<s> With this basic configuration, you should be able to connect. </s>
<s> You should see an &quot;acquiring IP address message&quot;. </s>
<s> This should mean that the laptop and router at least acknowledge each other's presence. </s>
<s> If this works, you can begin to reapply the security features. </s>
<s> I must think that, if you can select WPA as an option, there's a way to plug in your code/passphrase. </s>
<s> Not always are these on the same screen in the router configuration. </s>
<s> You may need to search for it. </s>
<s> These security settings can be picky. </s>
<s> You'll see some wanting hex and some alpha/numeric. </s>
<s> Some won't accept certain characters and some are fairly free with what you can plug in. </s>
<s> You'll likely have to type in a long code two or more times. </s>
<s> What I've found simpler is to type it out once in something like Notepad. </s>
<s> Save the file and put it on a flash drive or some such. </s>
<s> You can copy and past the code into the appropriate boxes for both your router and laptop. </s>
<s> This helps eliminate those maddening typos where you know it wasn't your mistake. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Unless you missed a setup or forget to unplug the ethernet after you setup the router the wifi on the router looks dead to me. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the help guys. </s>
<s> I set it up again from scratch and made a tiny improvement in that my laptop would connect for a while (a minute or so) before disconnecting itself. </s>
<s> I've bought a new router, so I'm praying the problem is the old router and not the settings, or else I've just bought a new router that won't work either Thanks again. </s>
