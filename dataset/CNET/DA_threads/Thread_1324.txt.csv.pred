1.1.1	i am torn between the dell inspiron 530s and 531s .	St
1.1.2	prices have dropped putting both in a similar $ $ category .	St
1.1.3	cnet has only reviewed the 531s .	St
1.1.4	is that the best choice	St
1.2.1	It 's a standard 64bit setup .	St
1.2.2	If a name means that much to you , then buy either one .	St
1.3.1	I think there is a difference .	St
1.3.2	The last time I looked , one of them was AMD-based and the other was Intel-based .	St
1.3.3	I have also been wondering which to choose .	St
1.3.4	I hope someone else will reply about the merits of Intel vs AMD for a desktop like these .	St
1.4.1	Like I said , I would n't buy either because they are 'Slimline ' form factor and while reduced footprint has it 's initial appeal ... it later means problems adding internal drives or higher performance peripherals ( video comes to mind ) not to mention the reduced form factor , reduced output PSUs .	St
1.4.2	Cooling is another problems users often face using slim lines .	St
1.4.3	Recognizing those limitations and forgoing hope of adding internals or GPUs ... a slimline might work for you .	St
1.4.4	Not me .	St
1.4.5	You can buy which ever you prefer however Intel is clearly the better choice from a performance , energy use and heat generation .	St
1.4.6	Good Luck !	St
1.4.7	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	... make sure you get a model with a Core 2 Duo if you can at all justify it .	Sug
1.5.2	It 's a lot faster , and the earlier CPUs usually ca n't handle 64-bit code should you choose to migrate to Vista 64-bit ( or its sequel in 2009-2010 ) .	St
1.5.3	The 531s is similar in other regards , but the Athlon 64 X2 just is n't as fast .	St
1.5.4	Also , if you 're looking at going slimline , do n't rule out a Mac mini unless you need Windows-specific programs or you ca n't justify getting their Mac equivalents ( for most people , this just means a cheap copy of Office Student & Teacher Edition at $ 150 ) .	St
1.5.5	It 's much smaller than the Inspiron or even the HP box and more power-efficient , too .	St
1.5.6	Arguably , you 're going to have an easier time with the full-size Inspiron 530 if you 're just looking for an inexpensive tower .	St
1.6.1	I would disagree to a point .	St
1.6.2	If you are going to get a slim model get what you want now instead of adding on later as adding peripherals can cause problems .	St
1.6.3	I have a slim model C521 and love it .	St
1.6.4	If space is a factor and or you do n't want bulky , it is the way to go and they are a powerful unit if you do n't go cheap at the start .	St
1.6.5	AMD vs Intel .	St
1.6.6	Once again it is up to you .	St
1.6.7	I have both intel and amd and love both .	St
1.6.8	I enjoy the AMD for gaming as I have it overclocked and does the job well .	St
1.6.9	I use my intel for work with multi-tasking and does the job well .	St
1.6.10	It comes down to the brand & bang for the buck .	St
1.6.11	Everything is so competitive today ...	St
1.7.1	I hate to burst your bubble ; but , Archtecture has a certain set of flags .	St
1.7.2	AMD64 and EMT64 have the same flags with the differences only in the naming of a few .	St
1.7.3	If you had a computer with a choice of SPARC64 , MIPS64 , PPC G4+ , ARM64 , or anything with a 64/128 bit address then I would say , & quot ; Go for the SPARC. & quot ;	St
1.8.1	You have a choice for the & quot ; Slimline & quot ; form factor , but it is n't neccesary .	St
1.8.2	There are normal sized choices for both .	St
1.8.3	I prefer the 530 because of Intel .	St
1.8.4	Intel-based PC 's have a reputation for lasting longer and running cooler .	St
1.8.5	Go with the 530 .	St
1.8.6	That 's what I 'm doing .	St
