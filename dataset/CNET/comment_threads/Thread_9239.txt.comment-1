I have an Asus DVD-RW drive that suddenly doesn't recognize data discs.
They appear in Explorer but when I try to read the data the drive opens and asks to insert a disk.
I checked BIOS and everything is ok, also the drive reads (and plays) music and video disks without problem.
I appreciate any help.
Best regards
