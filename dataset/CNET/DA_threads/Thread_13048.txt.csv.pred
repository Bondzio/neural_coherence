1.2.1	You do n't format a PC .	St

1.2.3	But let me assume you want to reinstall XP on a clean c : -drive for some reason .	St
1.2.4	The way to do that depends on the resources you have , such as : - recovery partition on the hard disk - recovery CD - Windows XP installation CD - driver CD Without knowing those details , we ca n't tell how you should do it .	St
1.2.5	All we can say : check the user manual and see what it says about reinstalling the OS .	St
