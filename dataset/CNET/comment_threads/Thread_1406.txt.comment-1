Looking for some input.
I have a desktop that is in need of an upgrade.
It runs fine but slow even if I am just browsing files in Documents or pictures.
Its an AMD Athlon (tm ) XP 1900+ 1.61 GHz., 256 GB of RAM.
What need to be upgraded?
Would I have to get a whole new motherboard or can I just upgrade the RAM and possible the processor?
My cousin built it and usually does upgrades but I am really into electronics and want to start learning on my own.
Thanks in advance.
