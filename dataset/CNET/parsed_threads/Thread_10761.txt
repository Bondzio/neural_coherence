<s> I need to know if I can use a regular keyboard and mouse with my G3 Imac coputer. </s>
<s> but ask in this forum http://reviews.cnet.com/5204-7592-0.html?forumID=25&start=0 </s>
<s> That area didn't tell me anything. </s>
<s> This forum is for feedback concerning Cnet, with emphasis on these forums. </s>
<s> For questions concerning Mac hardware you should post in the Mac Hardware forum located at the link Mark gave you. </s>
<s> John P.S. </s>
<s> It would depend on what keyboard and mouse it is. </s>
<s> If the drivers are Windows/PC only, then no, but a good portion of them nowadays support both the PC and Mac. </s>
<s> (Mine came with software and drivers for both.) </s>
<s> Hi I don't know what drivers are on the computer because I can't do anything,it boots up but I can't control anything I guess with the mouse or keyboard. </s>
<s> I have a imac and have a microsoft office keyboard (has a usb connector) connected to it and it works fine. </s>
<s> I did not need to load any drivers to use it. </s>
<s> keep in mind that the start key is the key that represents the apple and the start key is your option key. </s>
<s> I thought I would try to see if it works and have been using it for about a month now </s>
<s> Re-Post your original to the Mac Forum as already suggested. </s>
<s> Peter, mrmacfixit, will fix it for you and give you the info that you need. </s>
<s> Others from this forum will join you in the Mac Forum with your new post also to help you. </s>
<s> Amazing how it works once you get used to where to post and how the various forums are set up. </s>
<s> Difficult at first and easier to figure it out after a few times. </s>
<s> briana200083, you are not alone. </s>

<s> I thought this WAS the Mac hardware forum. </s>
<s> Did I take a wrong turn someplace? </s>
<s> It says Mac Hardware Forum at the top of the page. </s>
<s> So, to answer the Mac Hardware question: You can use any USB keyboard and any USB mouse to drive the iMac G3. </s>
<s> It does not require any special drivers as all the necessary USB drivers for a USB Human Interface device are already installed. </s>
<s> The problem with using a Windows keyboard is that some of the keys are labeled differently, notably the Apple Key which is the one to the immediate left of the keyboard. </s>
<s> Other than that, you should be good to go. </s>
<s> You cannot use a serial or PS2 keyboard or mouse on the machine Hope this clarifies things for you P </s>
<s> Thank you Sir that verifies everything that I asked. </s>
<s> I don't know how the confusion started there. </s>
<s> Glad to be able to sort it out and help you P </s>
<s> I had moved this discussion to the appropriate Mac forum from the feedback forum, but forgot to delete the posts that asked the original poster to post it here. </s>
<s> I apologize for the confusion. </s>
<s> It won't happen again. </s>
<s> THanks! </s>
