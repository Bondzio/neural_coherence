I am looking into purchasing some PC Diagnostic Tools, such as tools from Micro2000 ( http://micro2000.com/ ), Ultra-X ( http://www.uxd.com/ ), etc.
Has anyone had experience with these tools?
Are they worth buying?
Any recommendations?
Do you know of any reviews on these products?
Thanks, Jody Wood
