if i have understood the article, my statement is correct (i have added the underlines): ''in terms of processor pin count, the new socket was not really necessary to support ddr2 memory.
however, amd decided to make physical modifications in order to prevent people installing the wrong processor into their systems.
so socket am2 (or m2, as it was called before hitting intellectual property issues) has a total of 940 pins.
despite this, it is also not pin-compatible with the opteron's socket 940 the introduction of the socket am2 platform will also change the current cooler specification, forcing the cost of a new thermal solution on those socket 754/939/940 folks willing to upgrade.
the change does not affect the maximum dimensions of the mounting frame, nor the cooler, but it redefines the clamping mechanism.
this is no issue for the big players (system integrators and oems), but enthusiasts might have to throw their existing high-end cooling solution out of the window.''
i think you might be confusing different cores, including dual core processors, which is understandable.
the article you gave is almost a year old and as far as i know, there were no am2 chips to test yet.
like i've said earlier here, s 939 motherboards can be upgraded to take dual core processors by simple bios upgrade.
