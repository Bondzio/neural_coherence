I'm actually just one apartment in a building and neighbourhood with literally tons of wifi including a citywide net just going online.
I've tried multiple channels to no avail.
Can I assume if I'm the strongest signal on a channel occupied with other people that I'll have the least problem?
Compared to being on a channel with someone else who has an equally strong signal?
