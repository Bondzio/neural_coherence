my hardrive is going bad and i have xp home on it and don't like all the junk on the restore disk.
my objective is to install a new hardrive with windows xp only and nothing else.
i plan to install an xp pro upgrade after doing this.
what is the best way to go about this?
can i put the existing windows program files on a flash drive and boot the new hardrive with it?
suggestions please!
