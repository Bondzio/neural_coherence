hello - this is a great laser printer; infallible service for nearly one year.
but currently it's began to show a black 'speckled/smudged' area some 1&quot;-2&quot; wide descending vertically through the approximate middle of the page.
i've checked the 'dummy' lights for 'toner' or 'drum' issues, but nothing there yet; actually it may be early in the problem, and just not showing yet.
but wondered if anyone had similar problems, and what this line indicated?
thanks much -
