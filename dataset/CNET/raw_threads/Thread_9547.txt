It also recognizes all the devices (netgear usb 802.11g adapter, HP Printer, storageTek mini optical mouse) when connected directly. When I try to connect all of them through the hub, they do not work. There are 4 ports on the hub. When I look at the properties for it, it shows the correct number of open ports (I've connected all combinations to test it). I've tried to restart in safe mode, uninstall and reinstall the hub and nothing seems to get the devices to run when connected through it. The hub and mini optical mouse came with no disk (packaged that way, so I assume they are standard for at least win2K). Does anyone have any suggestions?
