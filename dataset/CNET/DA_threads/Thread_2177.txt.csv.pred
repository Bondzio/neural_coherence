1.1.1	I've been thinking of getting a new set of hard drives for my pc.	St
1.1.2	I was thinking of getting a smaller, faster hard drive to instal the OS and system files, and a larger one for general storage.	St
1.1.3	My querry is two-fold; 1.	St
1.1.4	Is this a good setup or do I not know what I am talking about?	St
1.1.5	2.	St
1.1.6	Any recommendations on what hard drives to get.	St
1.1.7	(Not looking for expensive top of the line, just cheap and reliable)	St
1.2.1	Depending on your system, you mentioned nothing about what you are presently using ,it is hard to say.	St
1.2.2	Some have gone to using solid state drives, which are typically faster but more costly so before you decide you may want to do a little research and see if SSD's are the way for you to go.	St
1.3.1	Sorry about the lack of information, didn't really know what was important.	St
1.3.2	I just looked up my computer http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/hp-pavilion-elite-m9660f/4507-3118_7-33573219.html and now I can say that it has Serial ATA-300 which caused some confusion when looking at hard drives.	St
1.3.3	The computer was bought factory refurbished about half a year ago.	St
1.3.4	I have upgraded to windows 7 if that matters at all.	St
1.3.5	I forgot to mention that I mainly use it for gaming and was curious if storing the game files on the second hard drive would have a big impact?	St
1.3.6	I can provide more info if needed, just tell me what you need.	St
1.4.1	be a new GPU.	St
1.4.2	That's why it helps to know your system components and your primary use.	St
1.4.3	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	As another poster mentioned it would have been nice to know something about the hardware (computer) being used and the intended purpose.	St
1.5.2	As to whether it would be worth swapping ATA(S) for SSD'S for the purpose of gaming would hinge on hardware capabilities, GPU, as mentioned and other components RAM, VIDRAM, and PSU, primarily.	St
1.5.3	From there it might be determined, one way or the other.	St
1.6.1	I am sorry that my post has caused some confusion.	Polite
1.6.2	I thought it would be obvious, but I guess not, that link leads to the specs for my computer model.	St
1.6.3	I am not really trying to boost gaming performance as I am comfortable with it as it is.	St
1.6.4	I was just letting you know that is it's primary use.	St
1.6.5	This thread is about the fact that I am in the market for a new hard drive and am considering my options.	St
1.6.6	As for the matter of SSD's it is my ill informed reasoning that my computer is not fit to fully leverage the benefits.	St
1.7.1	http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/hp-pavilion-elite-m9660f/4507-3118_7-33573219.html	St
