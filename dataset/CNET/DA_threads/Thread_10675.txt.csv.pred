1.1.1	Specifically this is a Hitachi Travelstar 4K1202.5 inch ATA/IDE hard disk drive , in a Freecom branded enclosure .	St
1.1.2	The mini USB plug on the Freecom hard drive enclosure has come loose and broken off , rendering the thing useless .	St
1.1.3	I opened the case and can see exactly what the problem is ... the little pins from the plug itself are not making sufficient contact with the circuit board .	St
1.1.4	If I hold the plug and press tightly towards the circuit board , the hard drive gets powered on ( or at least the LED turns on ) , but it does n't seem to be sufficient for Windows to recognize the drive .	St
1.1.5	I 'm wondering if I should take the thing apart some more , remove the drive from the circuit board , and try connecting the hard drive to my computer directly using a hard drive cable ... What do you think ?	Ques
1.1.6	Alternatively , could I purchase a replacement enclosure and & quot ; transplant & quot ; my disk-drive into the new enclosure ?	Ques
1.1.7	If so , where could I buy something like that ? Please help..	Ques
1.1.8	I am freaking out here !	St
1.2.1	remove drive from the external case and connect the drive direct or buy an external enclosure ... . http : //www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx ? SubCategory=92 & amp ; name=External-Enclosures & amp ; Order=RATING & amp ; Pagesize=100 .	St
1.2.2	Lots of options ... .if you 're located near a Best Buy or MicroCenter , you should be able to pick up such a device pretty easily.. Let us know how it goes .	St
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
