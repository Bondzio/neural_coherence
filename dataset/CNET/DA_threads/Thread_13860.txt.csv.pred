1.3.1	If the HDCP ca n't be verified ( sorry , I hope you will google what new terms are as I wo n't duplicate that here ) then the display should fall back to SDTV resolution or & quot ; 480p. & quot ; The fix is to connect with VGA and forget HDMI .	St
1.3.2	You could get a video card with HDMI output that is certified to output HDCP compliante HDMI but my bet is that would run a bit more cash and involve the Vista OS .	Sug
