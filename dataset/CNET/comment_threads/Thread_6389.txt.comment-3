I do agree that it is really convenient talking about the actual size.
But I was disappointed to find out that you can not reuse it when you try to delete old files from the USB and replace it with another file, a message will pop up that says you can not store anymore because there is no enough space.
when I checked the general preference the capacity showed USED: 7.69 GB on disk (7,685,210,112 bytes), where in fact the only data stored left is (Micro USB quick start up guide) only.
Unlike my other USB which is of course another brand, I can always delete old movie files and replace it with new ones.
But I will appreciate if anyone can tell me if there is a way to reuse the drive.
By the way I am using MAC.
Thank You
