other good tips would be to ensure that the shut down and alarm temperatures are set properly not only for the cpu, but for the gpu (if your gpu has this ability (lower end ones won't, but higher shelf gpu's such as geforce fx 5900's, geforce 6800's, geforce 7800's and so on, will)) another note on video cards is if possible put a fan over/near them in addition ensure the northbridge chipset is cooled properly, if it needs fan get it one, and don't buy a flaky one cooling the south bridge can also solve a lot of heat releated sound problems other things to note: if your machine is overheating, pull the side panels off if your audio pops, pull the side panels off, if it stops popping, you need to cut vents/get a new case in addition to getting a 2 fan psu, get a high quality 2 fan psu (or one with 1 really big fan) if your in a very hot climate and are trying to use a high performance pc, maybe underclocking for the summer could be an option if you have a basement, the pc will probably be cooler down there (if you don't have ac) rounded cables is a good suggestion, so is sleeving the power supply's cables (this is for advanced users that know how to sleeve them (it's not amazingly simple, you have to remove the heads and then re attach them, not hard but if you don't know what your doing you can ruin the whole thing) if you can't sleeve it zip ties would be a good idea cable management alwasy can help temps another good thing would be getting a good tim, such as artic silver ceramique (artic silver 5 is going to be about 5% better, and it costs nearly twice as much) just some more that i came up with up there, and i like your suggestion on sunlight especially
