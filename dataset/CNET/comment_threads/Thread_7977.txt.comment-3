Hi hyghwayman, I work for HP and saw your message and want to help if I can.
Tip: One thing you can do to shutdown your PC without unplugging it is to press and hold down the power button for 5 seconds.
I'm trying to better understand your problem.
Did this just start happening?
Did it occur after installing any hardware or software, even a Windows update?
You might want to try updating your BIOS: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=pv-56089-1&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&os=228&product=1815825 This HP support document looks like it may help: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=bph07147&cc=us&lc=en&dlc=en&product=1815825 It could also be that your PC is overheating.
Perhaps it needs to be cleaned?

Let us know how it goes.
