<s> Hello All, I was just wondering which filesystem is best for DVD burning. </s>
<s> CDBurnerXP pro offers 3 files systems, namely Joliet, ISO-level 1 and ISO-level 2. </s>
<s> I found from Wikipedia that Joliet is Microsoft endorsed file system but if I am making DVD back-ups which file system I should go for? </s>
<s> that will run on PC, Mac as well as Linux. </s>
<s> Many thanks </s>
<s> Seems to me that would be best. </s>

<s> Sorry I am not very clear with the answer!! </s>
<s> I use DVD+R to backup mainly documents and pictures. </s>
<s> You wrote &quot;I am making DVD back-ups&quot; which could mean you are making a copy of some DVD. </s>
<s> If so, you should keep the same filesystem. </s>
<s> However for a new DVD (recordable media) if you want it to be read in Windows XP, all the types listed do work. </s>
<s> You'll discover very fast about filename limitations in ISO 1 and 2. </s>
<s> But all will work just fine for file backup. </s>
<s> There are some that will overanalyze but those are best shown the link to google.com Bob </s>
<s> My apologies for wrong terminology. </s>
<s> So the major difference in all these file systems is only possibility of long file names, nothing else? </s>
<s> or nothing else 'major' that I should be worrying about, right?? </s>
<s> Just making myself sure!! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> When you selected ISO 1, and then added files you would have learned quickly the limitations. </s>
<s> But some want to know ahead of time. </s>
<s> Be aware I avoid duplicating ready and easy to find web content. </s>
<s> I will not tell you what these limitations are but that if you had tried you would have found them without having to record on the media. </s>
