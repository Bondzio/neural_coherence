<s> I had problems with my computer and had to reload everything. </s>
<s> If I go to the start at the lower left side click on it then go to turn off computer I used to be able to click on the Standbuy icon, and computer would go into hibernate/ standby mode and since reloading everything it will not go into the standby mode. </s>
<s> Not a real rocket scientist when it comes to computers,If some one could explain how to get this working again it would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you, mspek. </s>
<s> Try ending any programs running, like in the taskbar, and then try going in standy. </s>
<s> Click start&gt;control panel&gt;performance and maintenance&gt; then power options, you will see what to do once you're there. </s>
