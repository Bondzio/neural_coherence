1.1.1	I 'd like to get a Nook HD - love the screen resolution and I do a lot of reading .	St
1.1.2	It seems to have less glare than the nexus 7 & quot ; tablet .	St
1.1.3	But , I ca n't figure out how to get files from my camera onto the Nook without doing it via computer .	St
1.1.4	When I 'm on the road , I do n't want to take the computer , I want to take the nook .	St
1.1.5	The Canon G1X camera uses a regular size SD card , and the Nook HD as a micro sD card reader .	St
1.1.6	The camera does have a/v out and hdmi , which I could probably hook up to the nook via adapters but I do n't know if the nook will be able to read the files or recognize them so I could save them onto the nook .	St
1.1.7	The nook has a proprietary usb cable which I could hook into a card reader/adapter , but again , I do n't know if the software exists on the nook to recognize and manage the files .	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions ?	Ques
