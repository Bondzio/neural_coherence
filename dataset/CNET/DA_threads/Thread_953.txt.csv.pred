1.1.1	Hello , I own an HP Pavilion Elite HPE-400y ( Specs ) http : //h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsuppor ... t.jsp ? objectID=c02481314 & prodSeriesId=4269972 I have replaced the power supply with a 600w Corsair power supply and an NVIDIA gtx 550 ti I have been having trouble with it overheating to incredibly high temperature .	St
1.1.2	( GPU at and under 100 degrees and CPU at and around 70 degrees ) I need help modifying it in terms of cooling it down as much as possible .	St
1.1.3	Since I am a novice at computer hardware modifications I figured you guys could give me good advice on what I should do to make it run cooler , whether it be new fans , heat sinks , liquid cooling , a new case , etc .	St
1.1.4	If you recommend one of the above can you also suggest a replacement part that I might be able to use ?	Ques
1.1.5	If you need any more information I am more than happy to provide it .	St
1.1.6	And yes I blow the dust out of the fans regularly .	St
1.1.7	Thanks a bunch all .	St
1.1.8	-Ohno21212	St
1.2.1	Are those temps in & quot ; f & quot ; or & quot ; c & quot ; ?	Ques
1.2.2	If & quot ; f & quot ; ... ... ..your good .	St
1.2.3	If & quot ; c & quot ; ... ... .take the side cover off ... .test .	St
1.2.4	Try a different temp monitor .	St
1.3.1	You could add an exhaust fan like the one here http : //www.microcenter.com/product/209741/Case_Exhaust_Fan-Video_Card_Cooler_Fan Not knowing how old this PC is or whether it might need new thermal paste , I can only say that this could be a consideration , expecially if this computer is more than a couple of years old .	St
1.3.2	` Good luck .	Polite
1.4.1	Celcius .	St
1.4.2	I will try in a bit .	St
1.5.1	Ill take it under consideratoin nad i got it in may 2011 sorry for not clariying	St
1.6.1	be placed , I 'd start there .	St
1.6.2	If you have existing fans that do n't remove enough heat ... .perhaps a more robust or larger fan could be used .	St
1.6.3	Most of these case fans can connect directly to the PSU and many have adapters too .	St
1.6.4	Here 's the link I used .	St
1.6.5	If there are no existing/unused case vents , you may have to make ( cut ) your own .	St
1.6.6	http : //h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp ? objectID=c02481314 & prodSeriesId=4269972 VAPCMD	Ques
1.7.1	This is your basic OEM build PC from HP .	St
1.7.2	1st the AMD cpu tends to run slightly hotter , but well cooled by most setups .	St
1.7.3	However , once added & quot ; hot air & quot ; is thrown in it starts to create heat build-up .	St
1.7.4	Your new GPU will do that , so be sure its fan or cooling setup is well cared for .	St
1.7.5	As others suggested , added cooling can greatly improve the situation .	St
1.7.6	They already covered that so I add , either add more fans or improve ( replace ) current fan ( s ) for better RPMs for air exchange .	St
1.7.7	Make darn sure how that new PSU is working with its fans , some maybe counter to accepted OEM & quot ; air flow & quot ; , so inspect .	St
1.7.8	If optional range setting , increase it .	St
1.7.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
