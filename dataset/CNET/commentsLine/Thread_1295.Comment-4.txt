if you're running xp os, 1gb of ram is the most practical and useful amount of ram to have.
in that light though don't expect globs of improvement it simply will be better overall.
you can however try to do the usual tweeking and such in order that the system itself can best run.
that usually means, cleaning of excess or unwanted files or pgms.. and clean and defrag the hd.
use a registry cleaner.
i'm sure you can find outside of dell, other ram sources for your model at less cost and again in that light it won't hurt to have 1gb of ram.
if you're running winme, having 768mb of ram isn't that good as 512mb is best for overall operation, but you didn't mention what os you had.
is say that as 512mb was best because winme had a glitch of a ram issue and it never was resolved, if i recall right even with the small fix.
but no winme, don't worry.
