<s> We have some new Dells with gigabit adaptors but some workstations are 100T. </s>
<s> I read somewhere that your lowest connection speed is what everyone else runs at as well. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> Will everyone with gigabit adaptors still run at 100T if even one computer does? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Then such would not be true. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So that means gigabit connected at gigabit speed and 100T at 100T speed? </s>
<s> Just trying to confirm... </s>
