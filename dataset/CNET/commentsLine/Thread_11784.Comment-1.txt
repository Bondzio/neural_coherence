i recently purchased a few brand new tdk 8x dvd+r i have a lite-on 1693s brand new 16x burner when i go to nero 6 express i was unable to selected 4x write speed.
i know 8x dvds should be burnt at half the speed, but nero 6 only allow me to selected 6x speed minimum.
i had no choice, so i burnt the disc anyway, but after the burn was complete, the drive was able to read it, i edject it out and load it back in, the drive makes alot of clicking noises, the dvds cannot be read.
is there anyway for me to force my drive to burn at 4x?
please help me, please help me i beg you please help!
