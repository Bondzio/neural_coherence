<s> Hello, I want to change the SSID on all my APs without it affecting the connected devices. </s>
<s> The users should possible not be affected with the connecttion to the wifi network. </s>
<s> How can I go about it? </s>
<s> Since changing the SSID drops the network connection you can't push out a change to the machines. </s>
<s> Let's say no. </s>

<s> If you actually CHANGE it you will drop. </s>
<s> Some commercial AP have the ability to add multiple SSID to the same vlan. </s>
<s> You could then run in parallel for a while and tell your uses to use the new one and then remove the old. </s>
<s> A couple of brands of AP actually have a feature that allows you to not allow new sessions to a SSID but leave it active. </s>
<s> IF and that's a big IF I could have multiple SSID I could have my IT staff push out the change to the new SSID and when enough time has passed (months?) </s>
<s> then we could drop the old SSID. </s>
<s> Great idea. </s>
