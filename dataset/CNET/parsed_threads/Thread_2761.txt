<s> My brother bought a t6522 from circuit city and then he bought a 7800gt vcard.Well 3 days later the 7800gt doesnt work in this machine.We have changed drivers and took it too compusa to see if they knew what the problem was and they called said its fixed well ok! </s>
<s> !So we carried it home and it wont even load steam/HL/2.Ihad to delete norton antivirus to get steam too install.And it still wont play the game it hard locks so anyone wanting too game on this computer i would suggest too buy some other brand we are gonna try to get x850xt/pe and see if that will fix the problem..And one more thing too note circuit city we asked could we bring it back since it dont work for what we wanted it for they said sure for a 15% restocking fee WTF customer service????? </s>
<s> ?Ill never buy emachine again.. </s>
<s> for that video card, and then look at the power supply you have in the machine. </s>
<s> the X850 will be about as bad man also, what in god's green earth would compel you to try installing a graphics card into a machine that only costs around $100 more than that single card? </s>
<s> it's horribly mis-balanced in terms of all other hardware to the GPU but check your PSU, and drivers only 2 or 3 releases of drivers from nVidia have support for the 7800GT, try the newest 78.01 drivers avliable from their site here: http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_78.01.html also consider the PSU thing </s>
<s> &quot;also, what in god's green earth would compel you to try installing a graphics card into a machine that only costs around $100 more than that single card?&quot; Well I have noticed this trend, some will buy a lowend eMachine, Dell, HP, Gateway, etc and try to turn it into a Super gaming PC buy addding a highend video card. </s>
<s> Kinda like taking a VW bettle and putting a supercharged V8 engine in it. </s>
<s> A highend video card requires a highend PC. </s>

<s> Installing an Nvidia based vid card in a mobo with an ATI chipset? </s>
<s> That's just asking for problems... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Ok.Turns out that nvidia and ati mothervoard dont mix well.But a X850xt/pe is screaming on this comp.So the ATI based cards will work.Man this thing is real nice now.And one more thing im not fool just figured ATI wouldnt make you have too buy there crap.. </s>
<s> The ATI chipset shouldn't have at all caused a problem. </s>
<s> I've heard of stories where ppl have put in newer, nVidia cards, into an emachines T6520/T6522 and working fine, but they were 6 series... Maybe its the card, but I'm glad your rolling now! </s>
<s> If you still have the 7800GT(Don't think so), but maybe check it in another PC. </s>
<s> Oh yea, I gotta disagree with you guys up top. </s>
<s> I know the 7800GT would've been in a bottleneck, but not horribly. </s>
<s> Its a newer CPU, 1GB of ram at 400Mhz... Good job on upgrading the PSU. </s>
<s> -Ibrahim *CNET Help Forums need an edit button! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> but in quality a 7800GT is a high performance and high quality part, an eMachine is not only the CPU would be of a good quality also, the chipset does not equate the card you can use, you don't need to use !!! </s>
<s> 's in everything, and your wrong on so many levels instead of trying to figure out why it wasn't working, you assumed ATi/nVidia issue if ATi made the board not work with nVidia cards they'd be in court so fast their heads would spin (same for nVidia chipsets with ATi cards) Microsoft seemingly tried this with Sun Microsystems, making portions of one of the Windows versions, I think XP, incompatable with Java, and not including much Java support from the begining, Sun had them in court so fast it wasn't funny the companies may be competing, but they aren't going to backstab each other, your issue could be from a number of things, many of which could be entirely your fault, please calm down when your posting, it seems as if your yelling and screaming and ranting every single time, this is a place of intellectual exchange, not a wrestling ring </s>

<s> I own a eMachine T6212...same chipset/motherboard. </s>
<s> The literature that came with the machine and also comes with the T6522 STRONGLY cautions against anything other than an ATI based GPU! </s>

<s> I purchased an Nvidia 6800 manufactured by Gigabyte with really nice specs. </s>
<s> After I installed it, everything would freeze up (the Media Center Applications in particular) no matter what drivers I used. </s>
<s> I then bought an ATI X800 LX actually manufactured by ATI and everything works great now. </s>
<s> The T6522 has an ATI motherboard afterall. </s>
