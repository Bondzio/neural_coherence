you say your mobo suports &quot;266mhz, 533mhz, and 800mhz&quot;.
i think you're getting your terminology mixed up.
the ddr2 standards are: pc2-3200 200mhz ddr2-400 pc2-4200 266mhz ddr2-533 pc2-5300 333mhz ddr2-667 pc2-6400 400mhz ddr2-800 so memory running at 266mhz is ddr2-533.
you should visit kingston.com or crucial.com, enter your motherboard or pc make/model and find out exactly what type of memory is compatible.
if ddr2-800 is supported by your motherboard, then you need to find out what your cpu's fsb is.
if its fsb is 533mhz, ddr2-800 is really overkill for it.
