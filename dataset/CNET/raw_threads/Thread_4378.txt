I have a 3G internet account that requires a USB port so tablets are out and laptops are too big. I've looked at several posts recommending ion equipped netbooks but they all seem to be from 2011. Is this still the best thing for video? I'm not concerned about video quality but I would like to watch it without a lot of starting and stopping. Do you have any other recommendations? Thanks for any advice you can give .

But today, you see the Android tablets to do great and the USB Internet can be done on a few as well but let's stick with the smaller laptops because internet dongle support is a gamble. I have one of those newer dual core atom laptops and it's much better. Try one of those. Bob
