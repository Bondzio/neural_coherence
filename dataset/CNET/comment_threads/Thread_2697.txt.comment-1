Setup : Computer runnuing XP Home SP1 connectes wirelessly (with D-Link Air Plus DWL 520+),with Internet connection sharing, to Home Network consisting of Ethernet ADSL modem and wireless access point/ router (the D-Link Dl-714P+), with the main computer running Win XP Pro SP2 connecting to the Dl 714 via cable.
The main computer can access the Internet with no problems, and a lap top(built-in wireless) can also access the Internet wirelessly without problems.
However, the computer running Windows XP Home SP1 (first above mentioned)cannot do so, getting the error ''This page cannot be displayed''.
When I attempted to update AVG, I received the message '' ...The server name cannot be converted to the IP adderess....''.
I tried to ''repair'' the connection but received the message ''... IP address cannot be renewed'', and at the command prompt, when running the command ipconfig /renew, nothing happened (the crusor just went to the next line after ''Enter'') This computer was able ro access the Internet previously (yesterday).
It is indicating a good signal from the access point, but just cannot connect.
Please advise.
Thank you.
