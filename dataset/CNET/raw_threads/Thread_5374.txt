13980	1	128421	1451233	1451098	Coryphaeus	10/1/05 5:43 AM	1.12814538E12	thought	heat sink firmly attached processor use thermal compound fan turning right direction
13980	2	128421	1451292	1451098	Ray Harinec	10/1/05 6:28 AM	1.12814808E12	extremely hot	equipment should run hot how hot need lots fans location direction flow needs known read article tomshardware re dual core intels run hot use their top speed dual core configuration amds consume considerably less power
13980	3	128421	1451710	1451292	xtuser	10/1/05 11:29 AM	1.12816614E12	yep	thats why theres dual darn anyways theres airconditioned masscool case wwwneweggcom otherwisego mm panaflo thats cfm thermaltake big typhoon cpu cooler take off stock mm fan put yet cfm panaflo hook vantec fan controller didnt ran hot intel needs help
13980	4	128421	1451719	1451098	AKonny47	10/1/05 11:36 AM	1.12816656E12	correctly apply thermal compound	take look artic silvers website how apply thermal compound cpu bet money problem use thermal padcompound came hsf clean cpu apply
13980	5	128421	1451777	1451719	flyingcowrancher	10/1/05 12:09 PM	1.12816854E12	heat	yea using aftermarket zalman fan artic silver theres plenty answer question how hot hot clocked mzh gigs around degrees celcius pentiums arent usually hot many ee reason dual core hyper threading though windows views four seperate processors performance tab task manager clock regular speed gigs shuts itself off thats how hot fans front pulling air front fan side top rear heat sinks hard drives pci fan under video cards mm fan rear check case egg looks cool thanks maybe should liquid nitrogen how fast run lol
13980	6	128421	1451806	1451777	AKonny47	10/1/05 12:33 PM	1.12816998E12	theres plenty	somehow put too need alot small dab spread something credit card read over subwebaddr
13980	7	128421	1451827	1451806	flyingcowrancher	10/1/05 12:44 PM	1.12817064E12	worth trying	meant cpu covered super thin layer bought pin sized amount begin stock intel heat sinks come dab circle doesnt cover entire cpu try fresh layer though couldnt hurt
13980	8	128421	1451923	1451827	Ray Harinec	10/1/05 1:30 PM	1.1281734E12	never told us how hot	cpu throttling down cpu too hot yes getting cooler always nice goal video cards issue post simply didnt supply enough technically specific information possibly trying solve nonexistent problem
13980	9	128421	1451943	1451923	AKonny47	10/1/05 1:41 PM	1.12817406E12	nt nt ray he stated heat	NIL
13980	10	128421	1451992	1451943	flyingcowrancher	10/1/05 2:13 PM	1.12817598E12	temp	idle temp degrees celcius hits around before shuts itself off theres gauge yellow redish area green below experience tells red bad lol too hot unless underclock shuts itself down
13980	11	128421	1452016	1451992	linkit	10/1/05 2:39 PM	1.12817754E12	heatpipe heatsink	havent worked pentium yet discussion interested checked customer reviews six pentuim processors currently offered neweggcom seem cpu idle temps mid renge heatpipe heatsink models few customers seemed success cooler master hyper among heatpipe models
13980	12	128421	1452029	1451992	Ray Harinec	10/1/05 2:44 PM	1.12817784E12	ansered question	intel documents normal range however internal sensor causes throttling shutdown reliable suggestion should always top exhaust fan side fan brings room ambient air directly area where cpu hsf how handles sli cards wonder cyberguys anything exactly
13980	13	128421	1452036	1452016	Ray Harinec	10/1/05 2:50 PM	1.1281782E12	notice newer	use heatpipes orient fan way btx systems fan perpendicular mobo thus clear flow path through fins little backpressure rather forcing air down fins towards cpu suspect aspect btx design most useful part cpu fan actually helping total airflow path
13980	14	128421	1474470	1452029	thestrokes_20042005	10/14/05 4:39 AM	1.12926474E12	idea	maybe cpu shut down temperature bios set low specific cpus fact run around problems say shutdown temperature set shuts itself down cpu wouldnt chance reach although most likely damage cpu itself
