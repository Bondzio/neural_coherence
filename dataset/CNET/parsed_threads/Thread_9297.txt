<s> I just placed an order with dell for a studio xps system with core i7 processor, and now I am having second thoughts about my choice for memory. </s>
<s> I went with 6gb option which was the lowest offered and is 6 sticks. </s>
<s> It seems sufficient as Currently I am running a single core processor with 4GB of memory. </s>
<s> They offer upgrades to 8gb and 12 gb. </s>
<s> The 12GB upgrade costs $300, and replaces the 6 1BG sticks with 2GB sticks. </s>
<s> Since later expansion will require replacing sticks in the future if, how likely is it that I will need that much memory in the next 3 or so years? </s>
<s> I realize that this is a bit of speculation which depends on my usage and what happens in the future applications. </s>
<s> I use my system for drafting, rendering, photo work, and a very small amount of home video editing. </s>
<s> So, basically, if you are not into gaming, is 6GB a good choice, or will it choke the capability of my machine? </s>
<s> I would appreciate you comments and suggestions. </s>
<s> Thanks, Allen PS This is my first post. </s>
<s> I expect this is a frequent question, and I do not mean to be repetitive. </s>
<s> If there is a relevant thread, perhaps you could point me to it. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I found this review by cnet: http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-studio-xps/4505-3118_7-33396858.html . </s>
<s> It links to a specification page that says it comes with 64 bits Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> So it can make use of all 6 Gb. </s>
<s> That's nice. </s>
<s> For your usage, I'd say that 6 Gb is more than enough. </s>

<s> kees, Thanks. </s>
<s> I checked out the review. </s>
<s> I had not seen this one before. </s>

<s> well it says the motherboard has 6 ram slots, i dont know if that means theres gonna be 6x1gb sticks. </s>
<s> either way, you should be able to mis-mtach ram sizes later on. </s>
<s> of course i think 6gb ram is plenty </s>
<s> This has continued to be a question mark for me, too. </s>
<s> Dell does populate all 6 slots with 1GB sticks which is a real bummer - if I order now with 6GB and see that my heavy home video editing could use the full 12GB, then I would have to replace ALL 6 1GB DIMMs. </s>
<s> So that is a waste of the initial investment for me. </s>
<s> My question: if I'm running Corel VideoStudio ProX2, editing a large movie (45+ minutes), have multiple photoshop image files open, etc., could this system take advantage of the full 12GB of RAM? </s>
<s> A previous poster recommended ordering with 6GB and monitoring usage, but I don't want to waste the initial investment by throwing all those away if I see 6GB is not enough. </s>
<s> i know if its dual channel, the memory sticks dont have to match sizes in each slot. </s>
<s> id guess its the same with triple channel id personally go for 8gb. </s>
<s> its only another $100, and saves the trouble of having to buy it separate online </s>
<s> VideoStudio Pro X2 is a 32bit app and can't take advantage of more the 2gb of ram. </s>
