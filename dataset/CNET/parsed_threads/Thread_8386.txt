<s> I have an APC Battery backup its model is a 350 ES (says apc's website. </s>
<s> the sticker on the back says BE350U). </s>
<s> I recently found it in my uncle's attic and he said it hadn't been used in years and he didn't know the condition of the battery. </s>
<s> Sure enough, the last power outage the battery lasted for about 10 seconds and died. </s>
<s> Now i want to know if it would be better if I got a new battery for this UPS or if i got a new (maybe better) ups. </s>
<s> The only things connected to the battery part are my monitor and tower. </s>
<s> I think what caused the battery to die so fast was that my computer has 2 HD's 2 cd drives and 4 fans w/LED's. </s>
<s> Everything connected to it is outlet powered, except the mouse, kbd, webcam and joystick. </s>
<s> Its a AMD Sempron 2600 if thats relevent at all. </s>
<s> My monitor is a compaq 7500 CRT, but i'm planning to upgrade to a 20in LCD HDTV that i've already picked out. </s>
<s> Should i get a new battery, and if so, what kind? </s>
<s> Or should i just get a new, better UPS? </s>
<s> Help is MUCH appreciated. </s>
<s> If the UPS model is yrs. </s>
<s> old, then think that any battery(s) replacement is going to cost and maybe better spend on a new UPS. </s>
<s> As batteries age and do get used, the uptime for safe shutdown is reduced plus any added devices attached, the time is further reduced. </s>
<s> Check with APC for the specs on that model and determine what the time frames for devices attached is the uptime given. </s>
<s> Weight these factors and go from there. </s>
<s> Better UPS do provide basic surge protection, so if it got &quot;hit&quot; expect a lessen or defeated surge protection and a only a new UPS will do after that. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> It's an easy cost analysis. </s>
<s> What does the battery cost and what is a new unit? </s>
