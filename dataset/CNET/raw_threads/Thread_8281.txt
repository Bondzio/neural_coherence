I installed the cards in a HP 7955 758 ram 1.5 gig, P4,AGP 2x - nVidia Riva Video. When the program starts, I do not get any video on the screen and there are no events logged to be reviewed. But when I go into the configuration setup, I get a video feed from the camera, so I know the camera is on and working. I went through the setups and think I have them all set correct. What am I missing? Thanks
