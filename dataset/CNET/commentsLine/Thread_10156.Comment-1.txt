i'm trying to find out if anyone has reviewed the various brands of cd-r's available.
cnet had a very helpful page, with info by someone named jon jacobi, covering everything about cd-r's and reviewing brands.
unfortunately, clicking on the links just gives you a &quot;can't find the page&quot; response.
i'm not computer savvy and i just need someone who can direct me to the right page on cnet (why is that so hard to find?
- rhetorical question.).
can anyone help?
