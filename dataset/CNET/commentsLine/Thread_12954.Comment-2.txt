i need to think anything with much texture is going to be a challenge for any scanner.
these don't do well with shiny surfaces either.
i am not sure what problems you are having with photographic methods.
if you use a flash head on, this will not work.
light can be manipulated quite a bit.
if the light is well diffused, it should come out fairly even.
if you want the image to show a little sheen in the fabric, you can leave it somewhat wrinkled and use some side lighting which which can be angled to cause some subtle reflections.
i'm for going back to the camera.
