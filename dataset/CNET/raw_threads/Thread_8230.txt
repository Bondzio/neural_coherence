I reset the BIOS by pulling power plug, removing battery and resetting jumpers as per book. Still getting same delay. Machine runs fine after booting. BTW, there is no such delay if I boot from cd. Any ideas as to where I should begin?

13155	2	63793	759189	756965	cartmanken	2/12/05 9:18 AM	1.10819988E12	Thanks	Thanks Bob. Glad to see you're still helping in the forums. Been awhile since I was here. I'm beginning to think there may be an incorrect RAID setting, even though I'm not using raid. The VIA raid driver is installed, and I can access RAID through BIOS, but for some reason I can't change any settings. I'll get back to you if I find whats happening with the RAID controller.

Look in the advanced section of your startup/recovery options. You can view the boot loader by hitting the &quot;Edit&quot; button. See if it mentions a delay time.

However, your post got me to thinking that maybe some other software is messing with things. I am using &quot;XP Smoker&quot;, so I am going to do an uninstall there and see what happens. Have a good one. Ken
