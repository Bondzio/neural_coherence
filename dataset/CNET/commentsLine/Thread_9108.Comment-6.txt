ok, just in case any other poor sod is reading this, there would appear to be quite different inverter boards in what appears to be the same monitor... i followed a trail of links from this thread, and eventually found somebody else with the same inverter power board as me no toroidal coils etc, but some big caps, which had ballooned a bit at the top.
he replace them and pronounced it fine one of mine was the same, so i've replaced the lot it's fine so far!
woo-hoo!!!
now all i need is a cheap replacement screen for a packard-bell c3300 notebook which somebody sat on...
