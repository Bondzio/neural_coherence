forgive my absence after originating this thread.
my reason for repartitioning, other than the fact that it's my computer and it's a free country, was just for efficiency.
as for the information on ms forums on it, finding it again is worse than the needle in the haystack.
anyway, i made the mistake of using a program called killdisk, thinking i could restore my hard drive after repartitioning.
bad idea!
but i just had to try it my way even though a drive fitness test program i had available already had a means of repartitioning the drive without destroying the data.
so, i had to take it in to a local repair, where partition magic was used.
the repairman found that my internal cd drive worked intermitently and is now looking for a replacement.
(it is a gateway solo 1450 laptop).
when i took the a+ course at devry and copied all the tools available, i had a copy of norton ghost.
i don't think it was up to date as it didn't recognize ntfs.
xxclone was recommended as an alternative in the future.
so, with my internal drive partitioned into three and my external drive partitioned into two, i have all the partitions that i need.
thanks for the support.
