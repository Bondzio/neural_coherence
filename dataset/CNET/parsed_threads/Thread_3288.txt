<s> I HAVE AN OLDER HP1100A PRINTER WITH A SCANNER ATTACHEMENT. </s>
<s> I LOVE THE UNIT BUT THE SCANNER IS PICKING UP MORE THAN ONE SHEET AT A TIME. </s>
<s> WHEN I GOT IT, THE UNIT WOULD SCAN AND COPY ONE PAGE AT AT IME. </s>
<s> HOW CAN I FIX THE SCANNER AND MAKE IT PICK UP ONE SHEET AT A TIME? </s>
<s> THANK YOU KRAIG </s>
<s> Replace the rubber rollers. </s>
<s> Hp.com and search their parts department. </s>
<s> Some will not opt to fix it but try to scruff up the rollers with fine sandpaper. </s>
