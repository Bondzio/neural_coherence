<s> About 18 months ago (I lost a year being in Iraq) my Windows XP ME Home OS crashed on my laptop. </s>
<s> I got a new HD (since Sony has no recover program other than wiping the whole HD) reloaded the drivers and OS and then tried to access my old HD using a stand alone SATA portable HD case (Rocketfish). </s>
<s> Problem: I can see the folders, and even access down a level but when I tried to open/copy/move a folder/file it locks up. </s>
<s> I had tried copying through the cmd.exe interface and it can list the directories, but when you ask it to copy it states it can't find it. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how I can get data off my old HD? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>

<s> Google XP TAKE OWNERSHIP if you forgot how. </s>
<s> As soon as I click on something it just locks up - I have another HD from an old computer that I have to take ownership of - that's just no the case for this HD. </s>
<s> I do think it may have something to do with the registry - the program from MS that addresses &quot;file not found&quot; registry errors cannot be selected for an external HD which this is - any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks in advanced- Matt </s>

<s> Have you tried another PC and check results? </s>
<s> If you can, try Ubuntu live Linux version and see if you can copy that way or burn to disc. </s>

<s> I have tried another PC - but have not tried Ubuntu - I will try that next. </s>
