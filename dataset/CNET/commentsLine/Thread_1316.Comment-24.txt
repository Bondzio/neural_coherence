i have my desktop pc connected to my tv video and i also have a spare output on the sound card connected to a mixer/pa system which is under the tv.
i have about 50,000 midi and karaoke tracks on a spare drive on the pc and i use winamp with a plug in to play karaoke tracks on the tv plugging a couple of mikes into the pa along with the output from the pc.
result - a great karaoke system which uses very low cost, easily available karaoke tracks.
as an additional feature i can control my desktop pc from my laptop using logmein from  which means i can sit on the settee with other people selecting the songs they want to sing in comfort:-)
