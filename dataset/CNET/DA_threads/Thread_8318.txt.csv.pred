1.1.1	I have a hard drive from a computer I used to have which seems to have stopped working after the motherboard in the same computer burned out.	St
1.1.2	I have since tried the drive in my new PC, configured as a slave and the original (new pc) drive as master; however, configured this way, not even the master will start.	St
1.1.3	the computer powers up and goes through the BIOS check but will go no further, just hangs at a blank screen.	St
1.1.4	The drive also failed to work in another, third computer as well.	St
1.1.5	The jumper settings are correct-- is it possible that the drive was damaged when the motherboard went out, or possibly even got a static zap?	St
1.1.6	Thanks!	St
1.1.7	Bunny M.	St
1.2.1	Your hard drive is sure dead.	St
1.2.2	It is typical that such failures will stop a good drive working (master in this case).	St
1.2.3	Forget trying the electronics is dead.	St
