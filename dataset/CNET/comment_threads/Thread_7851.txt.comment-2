What metric do you use to determine &quot;best&quot;?
If it is performance then the Core 2 Duo would be the winner while if it is bang for the buck then it may vary a bit.
I would suggest a dual core laptop, e.g.
Intel Core Duo, Core 2 Duo(which is the successor to Core Duo) or AMD Turion 64 x2, if you do any CPU-intensive tasks.
I would likely stay away from Celeron or Sempron laptops unless you don't mind having a low power processor as these are for low-end systems which isn't the same as saying they use less electricity.
