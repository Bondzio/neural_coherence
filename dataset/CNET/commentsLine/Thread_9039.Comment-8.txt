i think you are missing the point somewhat.
my original post was not an inquiry into what tablets to buy.
i have done the research and know some i am interested in.
the post was a plea to cnet to help people like me by including information about a tablets stylus,pressure,etc into their reviews and spec sheets.
often this info is not included or glossed over in most reviews and is almost never on spec sheets.
