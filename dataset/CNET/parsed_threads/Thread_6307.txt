<s> i live in a dorm and i want to stream movies to my nexus 7 but i dont want to buy a nas. </s>
<s> can i connect my external to a router ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833704137 ) and use that to stream movies. </s>
<s> i dont need to be able to connect to it all over campus (i know that involves hacking the proxy) but mainly in my room would be nice. </s>
<s> could you tell me if it'll work and why/how? </s>
<s> thanks http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833320059 would it work with this router maybe? </s>
<s> The likely reason(s) for no one having answered this is that it could entail hacking into a secured network for potentially nefarious reasons, which is not only unethical but could also have legal rammifications. </s>
<s> Methinks you are on your own in this circumstance. </s>
<s> If you connect your external to a router, it's attached to a network (a small network, consisting of your nexus and that router). </s>
<s> That is what we call Network Attached Storage, or NAS shortly. </s>
<s> So, if your external can be connected to the router, you already have NAS. </s>
<s> And if it doesn't it won't work. </s>
<s> But I see the Nexus 7 has a USB-port. </s>
<s> And most externals I know (unless they are Firewire of e-SCSI) can connect via USB. </s>
<s> So why do you think you need a router? </s>

<s> And what would he use as an ISP? </s>
<s> What I gleaned from the original post was to be able utilize the available on campus service which unless I am mistaken would require hacking into the server. </s>
<s> On many college campuses doing this is unacceptable because of security restraints and tight internet use policies when using their system(s). </s>
<s> &quot;I dont need to be able to connect to it all over campus (i know that involves hacking the proxy) but mainly in my room would be nice&quot; Just using the portable hard disk in his room with a USB-cable seems feasible. </s>
<s> And the same method would work in friends rooms and, in fact, all over the campus.That extra cable is a little bit clumsy indeed when walking or on bicycle, but not being able to watch video then might be a minor nuisance. </s>

<s> I have no intentions of hacking but I think I go it figured out I think, but I only want to use it in my room </s>
<s> It has to be rooted to use the usb </s>
