I know the Nvidia cards will work as long as the slot is 1.5v and not the old 3v slot.you won't get the advertised performance gains running a 8X card in a 4X slot, but you should notice an increase in performance over your old card.
As far as the ATI cards, I haven't used them enough to offer an opinion.
