sorry r. proffitt.
i did not mean in any way to offend or insult your reply at all.
if you took it that away then please accept my apologies because that was not my intentions.
since you definitely have the credentials i would like ask the following.
i have a motherboard that plays all sorts of neat tricks.
one the things that it has done in the past (not anymore) is it will detect the hard drives and place them on the secondary channel instead of the primary channel despite the drives being directly connected to the primary channel.
please keep in mind that when it does this my two dvd drives on the secondary channel get bumped out.
they simply don't get detected at all during the post nor in windows xp.
another thing that has happened is sometimes the slave drive located on the primary channel and connected as a slave shows up as a master bumping my master drive on the primary channel out of the picture (no detection).
this is only some of the issues i have seen with the hard drives and the dvd drives.
what i want to know could it be the southbridge chipset that is faulty or is the fault of the bios ?
also on an unrelated question do the devices connected on the southbridge hub (pci, keyboard, bios, usb and ide and so on) do they talk to each other or can they at least if they wanted to ?
thanks for your input its much appreciated victor
