i have an internal cd-rw, and wanted a dvd burner.
i bought an external lg gsa-e40n/l.
works great.
when i get a new pc, a dvd burner will be included.
thus, i will have 2 dvd burners.
or should i ask for no dvd burner on a new pc?
a dvd-rom or a cd-rw instead?
my question is this: i want to have 2 dvds of copies of photos, work, etc.
is it ok to burn to an internal cd-r/dvd and an external dvd simultaneously?
i want to save time, and burning at a slow speed such as 16x would take too long if doing it one at a time.
besides, what's the point of having 2 dvd burners then?
