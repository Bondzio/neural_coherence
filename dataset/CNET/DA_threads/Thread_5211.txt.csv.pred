1.1.1	I was watching the Audigy 2 ZS Gamer sound card but I was wondering if it doesnt make problems with the integrated sound that it has right now .	St
1.1.2	It is an HP M7170N or do I have to just disable that one in my Bios and install the sound card and let it recognize it ?	Ques
1.2.1	Get the platinum from compusa after rebastes for only $ 99 .	St
1.2.2	Roger	St
1.3.1	you can just install the soundcard without disabling the onboard , when you install the drivers from Creative it will set the Audigy as the primary audio device , and Windows will handle disabling the onboard sound as for what damasta is talking about , the ZS Gamer is nothing different from the 2 ZS , except it includes a lot of free games , the Platinum is no different from the 2 ZS , except it includes the front panel I/O and a remote ... along with a slightly different software suite	St
