Ok..
I was running vista premium on my pc,didnt like it cause it ran too slow.So i installed Xp home on it.
I have a 80 gig set as primary for the os,and a 300gig for the slave.
I installed the 300 gig with vista`s partition program,worked fine with vista.
Now, Xp recognizes it in the device manager,says its working fine..but i dont see it under my computer.
any suggestions?
