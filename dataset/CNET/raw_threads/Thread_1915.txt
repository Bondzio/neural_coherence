If the usb card can't handle the power that is require by the device then you will also need a hub with external supply also (I think that maybe your problem right now; just guessing).

Let's attempt a DVD write at about 600 kbps? That's about 4 hours. A CD-R at 4x is some 700 MB that at top speed completes in about 25 minutes. I actually see 30 minutes. So at USB 1.1 and 4,700 MB to a DVD that would be 4,700 / 700 or 3.3 hours. And this is if all went well... You'll want an USB 2.0 card since for a PCI card it's the cheap solution. Here's one I used -&gt; http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=A-6202-4 Be sure to read more at http://www.usbman.com about USB 2.0 on the OS in question. Bob
