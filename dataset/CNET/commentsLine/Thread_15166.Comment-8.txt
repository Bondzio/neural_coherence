for the time being i'll use ghost 2003 for my image backups/restores and will continue testing true image 9.0 and novabackup 7.3 (as soon as it arrives).
i tried norton goback a long time ago and it too did something at startup that conflicted with other utilities i used so i stopped using it.
having used novastor/novabackup before ghost...i'm hopeful their new product will give the backup and restore capabilities i'm looking for.
i definitely don't want to have to install windows and a backup program to effect a full restore.
that's what norton ghost has done so well for me and the handful of freinds and relatives i help for these many years.
