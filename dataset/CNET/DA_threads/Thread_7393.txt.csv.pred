1.1.1	Since i have a low budget and I'm not even an extreme gamer, I just want to know - Is Nvidia Geforce 8400GS good for gaming (as compared to Nvidia Geforce 7300GT and Nvidia Geforce 7600) ?	Ques
1.1.2	Also ,Is 256 MB Video Memory (512 MB with the Nvidia TurboCache feature) sufficient to play the current generation games quite smoothly ?	Ques
1.1.3	My PC Config : Pc:- Lenovo 3000 series Q100 8822 11Q Intel Pentium 4 3.06 Ghz HT Intel 945G Chipset 2 GB DDR2-533 RAM Dual-Channel 80 Gb Hard Disk Windows XP Home	St
1.2.1	It's definitely off the bottom rung of those Intel GMA solutions and the other Nvidia 6150 but you will read less than glowing reports about speed on this DX10 capable chip.	St
1.2.2	However it's going to run games at &quot;reasonable&quot; settings and the drivers are not done yet so stay tuned for updates.	St
1.2.3	I'd take that one.	St
1.2.4	Sorry, to compare to the other cards find benchmarks and compare.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	if you want to play current generation games smoothly at moderate settings, you'll need at least a 7600gt or 8600gt.	St
1.4.1	How much is the Dedicated Video Memory in Nvidia Geforce 8400 GS 256 MB ?	Ques
1.5.1	The chipset never determines this.	St
1.5.2	If you supply the make and model number of the card we might be able to look it up.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	I want to know the Dedicated Vidoe Memory of these 2 cards - XFX Geforce 8400GS 256 MB supporting 512 MB Model(PV-T86S-WANG) and, XFX Geforce 8400GS 256 MB supporting 512 MB Model(PV-T86S-WAQG)	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	The Nvidia Geforce 8400GS has 6.4 GB/sec Memory Bandwidth while Nvidia Geforce 8500GT has 12.8 Gb/sec Memory Bandwidth ,Does this difference in Memory Bandwidth reflect in the gaming performance since most of the PC games have size lower than 6.4 GB.	St
1.8.2	So, what's the use of these high Memory Bandwidths ?	Ques
1.9.1	While fun to know those numbers the real answer are the benchmarks.	St
1.9.2	Find a review on the cards you want and compare the benchmarks.	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
