On opening, it made a very loud noise (i was not there to hear it) very similar to either the normal sounds of the CD drive or the fan working overtime. It did not wake up. The CD drive is empty. On re-booting, we get the grey screen with the spinning gear for a very long time and then the blue screen of death, which fades to slightly darker shade of blue after a few seconds. None of the start-up shortcuts seem to make much difference. &#8984;-Option-P-R followed by holding down the option key on restart led to the select startup disk prompt, but no further. I have another, identical mac, but no cables.

Take the OS X installation disk and try to boot from it. Shut down the computer, restart and hold down the &quot;C&quot; key until you see the spinning gear. Did it boot correctly? If it will not boot from the disk, reboot and hold down the Option key until you see the Select Startup Disk prompt. The Command-Option-P-R sequence is the correct way to zap the PRAM but all the keys must be held down at the same time. If only the Option key is held down, you will get the select startup disk prompt. If you have been running the computer, then you do have the cables necessary to run the other, identical, one. I guess you mean that you do not have two power adapters. Check for dust bunnies at the air vents. Let us know how you get on P
