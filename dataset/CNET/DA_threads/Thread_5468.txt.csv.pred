1.1.1	Hi, I have been wanting to copy computer audio to a wav or mp3 file on my Dell 866 MHz computer.	St
1.1.2	My system is running a Creative SoundBlaster Live!	St
1.1.3	Value card that shipped with the system in July 2000.	St
1.1.4	So I first took a standard audio cable (with two male ends, I guess they might be called).	St
1.1.5	I put one end in the sound-out/speaker port on the back of the tower and the other in the microphone port.	St
1.1.6	Then I played the QuickTime file of which I wanted the audio to be copied and pressed record in the Windows 98SE sound recorder.	St
1.1.7	I had had the volume control was muted as someone was sleeping.	St
1.1.8	When I unmuted the volume control, no sound workednot even a system beep or alert.	St
1.1.9	I tried new speakers; still no sound.	St
1.1.10	Did I fry the sound card?	St
1.1.11	So I replaced the 2000 Live!	St
1.1.12	Value with a 1997 SoundBlaster Live!	St
1.1.13	(no &quot;Value&quot; facet) from my Dell 266 MHz.	St
1.1.14	Windows of course automatically installed some generic Creative sound drivers, and then system sound workedbeeps, alerts, and even all games I tested.	St
1.1.15	But the audio of my DVD Player software (CineMaster software that came with my 2000 shipped-with hardware decoder, now made by Ravisant/Cifelli) did not work.	St
1.1.16	I even tried downloading drivers from www.creative.com but to no avail for my DVD.	St
1.1.17	Did I really fry my original Live!	St
1.1.18	Value card by using that cable?	St
1.1.19	What should I do regarding the DVD software?	Ques
1.1.20	(I am first off going to try to reinstall the software itself and also the drivers for the decoder card.)	St
1.1.21	Thanks for all your help.	St
1.1.22	It's greatly appreciated.	St
1.1.23	Henry	St
1.2.1	To give a sound card last rites, I boot up a KNOPPIX CD and test the functions.	St
1.2.2	As to the DVD, I must write that I can't help you with your DVD Decoder board issues.	St
1.2.3	That technology was nice, but can strain support and I don't want to deal with them anymore.	St
1.2.4	We install a new DVD drive (20 bucks in bulk) and then a software player.	St
1.2.5	Somewhere past 600MHz, DVD playback via all software began ot work.	St
1.2.6	There are a few that cling to the hardware cards and we let them cling, but find it best to pretend we know nothing about them.	St
1.2.7	It's not that we don't, it's the hours making it work is costly, then they want you to fix it everytime it breaks again for free.	St
1.2.8	So the standing order is to &quot;know nothing.&quot; Hope this sheds some light on the issue.	St
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	Would you please tell me a little bit about KNOPPIX CD and how I might go about getting a copy so that I can test my presumed &quot;dead&quot; sound card.	Sug
1.3.2	Thanks.	St
1.4.1	Here's a short review (worth reading!)	St
1.4.2	http://tips.oncomputers.info/archives2004/0401/2004-Jan-11.htm Links to the KNOPPIX website are there, but I must ask since I always want to know.	St
1.4.3	Why couldn't you find the KNOPPIX web site?	St
1.4.4	Just wondering, please tell and don't take it as an offence.	Sug
1.4.5	Bob	St
