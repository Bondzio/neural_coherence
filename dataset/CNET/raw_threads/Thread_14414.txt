Honestly, the functionality I want is for system such as the Playstation 2 or Xbox, or other TV peripherals such as DVD players or what have you, basically anything that uses standard AV (Yellow, Red, and White) cables. The ultimate goal for me is to be able to use those systems through my computer, and be able to record the video and sound into movie files. So what kind of card offers that? I won't use any of the actual TV tuning features, nor the FM radio ones or any such things. It will basically serve as my video game recording station. However, I've looked at some cards and noticed not a lot of them actually have all of proper AV ports...many just have a video-in. I figure my best bet is to get something like the Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-150 (&lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/Hauppauge-WinTV-PVR-150-MCE-White-Tuner-Remote/dp/B000E65HOO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/105-8533176-7524417?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1180660825&sr=8-3&quot; &gt; http://www.amazon.com/Hauppauge-WinTV-PVR-150-MCE-White-Tuner-Remote/dp/B000E65HOO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/105-8533176-7524417?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1180660825&sr=8-3 &lt;/a&gt;) However, I always come to CNET before making a major purchase, because you guys here generally know what's what! Haha well any replies or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
