SAFE MODE will set the video to 640x480 and you'll be able to find your way to the Control Panel, or Display Properties to set the display to 640x480 256 colors and then OK your way out. Reboot normally, and if the display shows, go to the display panel and select your preferred settings. Bob

I can hear the HD doing its thing, going thru post etc. I dont get the beeps associated with no video card. But I have taken the card out and run with nothing, I get the beeps then. Additionally, I changed the jumper to reset the CMOS and booted that way with no results. I have tried booting to a bootable floppy, but still no video, although you can tell it reads the disk goes thru the commands and waits at the command prompt. Thanks for your help.

I got all of them installed (no new hardware found on boot), then decided to update video drivers from CDROM. Everything went fine, then advised I must reboot, so I did. Then no video. It does POST and continue, but no video at all, not even showing CMOS etc. Thanks for your help.

If multiple display cards fail to show any BIOS screen, then the list of failures starts to shrink: 1. The BIOS settings clear jumper is in the wrong position. 2. The CMOS battery is low, dead. 3. A cable of other connection is stopping the bootup to the BIOS screen. It was not fun to find a motherboard manual that showed the HD LED to be on J11, but J11 turned out to be the RESET. Fortunately the motherboard markings were correct. After you ponder the above, then you have to decide if the machine is dead and now you get to find the dead part. You also have to tell the forum if you are willing to take the machine down to power supply, CPU/HeatSinkFan(HSF), one memory stick and test it our on a cardboard square. You also may have to replace some major part like a motherboard or CPU. Before you start all this, can you revert to what worked or can you put it back to as-supplied and use your warranty? Bob
