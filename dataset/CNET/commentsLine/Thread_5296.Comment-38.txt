your integrated graphics is terrible for gaming but you can buy a new graphics card.
integrated graphics is good for windows and even for some games that are not very demanding but never good for the latest games.
i say you should just stick with your current configuration because good gaming graphics cards are very expensive.
you would be wasting your money if you bought a new graphics card unless you are really into pc gaming.
if you want to try pc gaming but don't want to sink too much money into the hardware then an xbox 360 is the perfect alternative.
