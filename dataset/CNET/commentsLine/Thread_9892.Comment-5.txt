the harddrive is a quantum fireball, pata, part #qml20000ld-a it came in a gateway tower.
it had windows 98 on it.
the light for the hd comes on for a second but then shuts off.
the hd spins for a moment and then quits.
everything is hooked up right, i took it apart and everything looks fine.
i have a really old 2gb hd that i have rebuilt and it works just fine for being nearly 11 years old.
i cant figure out the quantum.
