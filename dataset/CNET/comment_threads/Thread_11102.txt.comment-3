For reference, another discussion about it: &quot;I fixed this on my computer.
I have a Ti4600 on an Asus P4T-E motherboard.
Any time I went to the adapter settings screen I saw that it said my card was AGP running in PCI mode.
After a lot of reading and searching, I read on Intel's site that you need to run an Inf updater to get this motherboard (and 100 others) to communicate properly with the AGP slot.
I looked up the files for my chipset (I850) and downloaded the Inf updater.
I ran the updater (had to unzip it and then run the 'setup' program) and rebooted my computer.
It found all kinds of new hardware for the bridges and installed it automatically.
