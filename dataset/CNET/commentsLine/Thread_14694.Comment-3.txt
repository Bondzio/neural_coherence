thanks for this opinion.
i always wondered how often raid 1 actually saves the day.
either way, if we were to still go this route, you would recommend an adaptec card?
at the very least we need an inexpensive, decent speed, high capacity solution.
and this 73 gb scsi drive is not going to cut it.
do you have an adaptec card in mind that would work well?
do we need cache on the card?
btw, this will be an win sbs 2003 environment with 25 users (not running exchange).
