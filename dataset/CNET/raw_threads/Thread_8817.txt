I am thinking of buying my boyfriend a e-reader/ tablet for xmas, but i am a complete techno phobic when it comes to gadgets, so the easier you can explain the better. It will be used for is reading pdf files and watching video clips on, it must be able to zoom in, on the pages,have quite a big screen, and work well in a cool temperature due to it being used in a garage. I have been to the big stores and asked there but left with a headache because they go all technical on me. I would really like to get him something other then the usual christmas tat (socks, t-shirt, jumpers and stuff) could someone please point me in the right direction as what to buy. Thank you

It's got the HD screen, great sound and a lot going for it. One of the safer bets. Bob
