help.... i'm trying to check my hard drive for errors but the scan disk doesn't complete.
it keeps cycling back and starting over.
i tried to defragment as well, but that gets about 10% done before re-starting with a message that windows is writing to the hard drive.
i'm not sure what that means.
how can i fix this?
little help please.
