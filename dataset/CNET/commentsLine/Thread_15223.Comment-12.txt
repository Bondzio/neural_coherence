thanks for the reply vapcmd.
the drive model in my case does not make a difference...i have over 10 drives and all of them have issues on the same motherboard.
the drives are jumpered accordingly and to either master or slave.
i personally have not seen any difference whether the drive is connected to one connector or the second on the same 80 pin cable.
i believe the two ide ports on the motherboard that i have is supposed to indicate to the bios that the drive is on the primary or secondary channel.
thanks again victor
