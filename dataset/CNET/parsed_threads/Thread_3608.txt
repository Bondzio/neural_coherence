<s> I would like to be able to control ALL of the features of my multifunction printer wirelessly. </s>
<s> In particular, if a fax comes in, I would like the option of it &quot;printing to file.&quot; Also, if I have a fax to send, I would like to be able to &quot;print to fax&quot; and also &quot;dial fax&quot; from my laptop. </s>
<s> In short, I would like to be able to do everything but change paper and ink REMOTELY with FULL multifunction functionality...from my laptop. </s>
<s> Is anybody aware of a multifunction printer and/or software that offers this kind of total control? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot, Mikey </s>
<s> &quot;The HP PSC 2510 is the only MFP in this roundup with built-in 802.11b wireless support. </s>
<s> That's in addition to its Ethernet connector, which means you can attach it to either a wired or wireless network to print, scan, or access memory cards across a network&quot; </s>
<s> Thanks for the answer, but what about faxing with remote control from my laptop. </s>
<s> I can't do that for you. </s>
