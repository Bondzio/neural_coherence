thank you for sharing your experience.
i have a question about &quot;hibernation&quot;, are you meaning &quot;sleep&quot; ?.the reason is that i am re-booting my factory-installed ssd machine only if i need to do it, which is perhaps once a week.
the rest of the time i let it go into &quot;sleep&quot; mode on the belief, maybe wrong, that it consumes much less write cycles.
please let me know.
thanks.
fyi my machine is a toshiba portege z930 ultrabook with 128gb ssd, it is equipped with w7 and, save for all system files, i am storing all other files, including utilities, on a secondary 1tgo wd drive.
