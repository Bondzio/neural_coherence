<s> I am running XP media center - I had no viruses and everything is scanned daily. </s>
<s> Yesterday I left my laptop only to return to the below...No new software or hardware changes were made and no viruses or malware showed on my daily scan this week... </s>
<s> When Windows XP tries to load, I get the following message: &quot;We apologize for the inconvenience, but Windows did not start successfully. </s>
<s> A recent hardware or software change might have caused this.&quot; My options are: Start in safe mode. </s>
<s> Safe mode with networking. </s>
<s> Safe mode with command prompt. </s>
<s> Last known good configuration setting (most recent setting that worked). </s>
<s> Start Windows normally. </s>
<s> The only discs I have are the system recovery disc, the application and driver recovery dvd and a full copy of an OLD version of XP - I NEED TO SAVE THE DATA ON THIS HARD DRIVE - I cant lose it and reformat. </s>
<s> I used the system recovery disc, then when it asked I canceled out of the disc and it self started chkdsk - 8 of 8 segments unreadable - index $130 file 31 being fixed. </s>
<s> I CANT boot in any of the safe modes or to a previous config. </s>
<s> No matter what option I pick, it just loops back to the page with the &quot;We apologize for the inconvenience, but..&quot; options. </s>
<s> I tried a Hard Disk Self Test and got the error #1 -07 Fail, 10 seconds after it started. </s>
<s> I really need the data on this pc so getting a new HD isn't the answer. </s>
<s> What is? </s>
<s> I am running an HP Pavilion dv6000 with Windows XP Media Center and a Phoenix bios. </s>
<s> The HD is a seagate 80gb momentus s400 2. </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> have you tried to boot from the old copy of XP or from your system restore? </s>
<s> you wont want to start a restore or anything but it seems like you just need to be able to access the hardrive to get your files out. </s>
<s> and for the future, i would recommend that you get a backup program and a nice, fat external hdd. </s>
<s> 1TBs run for around $200 or less now i think. </s>
<s> I tried to get to the system restore with no luck. </s>
<s> I have an old copy of XP Pro. </s>
<s> If I boot off of the CD, would I still be able to view my HD? </s>
<s> I am being extra cautious because I dont want to lose the data. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If you are serious about this you remove the hard disk from the machine and put it into some desktop or USB case. </s>
<s> Then you explore data recovery software with titles like: GETDATABACK ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY (many) LINUX BOOT CDs All found with google but if the files are worth something, this is how its done. </s>

<s> I had this same problem. </s>
<s> Other web info suggested a drive failure. </s>
<s> I even suspected I would need a new copy of Vista or XP (It came installed on my HP/Compaq). </s>
<s> Here's what worked for me: I started the computer and went to the diagnostic mode. </s>
<s> Message was that Windows could not fix it. </s>
<s> Then went to the &quot;Advanced Help&quot; hotspot on the panel and selected &quot;Go to System&quot; (which is a DOS panel). </s>
<s> I then went to the C: drive root directory with C: then typed CHKDSK /F /R to force DOS to try to locate and repair any bad files or clusters. </s>
<s> This took about 45 minutes to complete but located quite a few orphaned files. </s>
<s> BTW: You will get a message about CHKDSK not being able to repair because the session is held by another process, but you will get an option to disconnect it. </s>
<s> Tell it to disconnect it. </s>
<s> Then, restart the computer. </s>
<s> Vista will take longer to restart because it has to rebuild some tables, but eventually it came back to me just fine. </s>
<s> Since I had never made a restart/backup disk, I made it my first task to get this done. </s>
<s> I hope this is encouraging to you and you can get it to work again. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info - 1 quick question; You posted &quot;I started the computer and went to the diagnostic mode.&quot; Is the diagnostic mode in the bios or within windows (specifically how do I get there)? </s>
<s> Thanks a ton. </s>
<s> Hi, I tried using CHKDSK/F/R command on DOS, but it failed at stage 2 of 5, giving a message &quot;Insufficient disk space to recover lost data&quot; </s>
<s> Hi, I think you need a software from critical rescue team will also contain solution to a formatted hard drive recovery. </s>
<s> Pls remind us to send you the link as soon as possible. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
