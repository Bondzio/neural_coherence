I'd like to add a second drive and turn them into a RAID1 array (I hope I'm phrasing that correctly) and I'd also like to partition the drive (using Partition Magic), but I don't want to lose any data. Do I need to partition the original drive before I set up the RAID array? Do I need to set up a matching partition on the second drive, or will that be taken care of automatically? Does it matter? Also, do I need to reformat the original drive in order to set up the RAID array? Thanks!

See http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/perf/raid/levels/singleLevel1-c.html You may be lost from the beginning since you mention Partition Magic which would NEVER be used in a RAID 1 setup. You didn't supply what RAID hardware you have or what OS you have that supports RAID 1 so I'm left to guess that we are working with the most common setup. Here's a link about XP Pro's RAID 1 with IDE drives. http://www.experts-exchange.com/Storage/Q_21212721.html Before you reply you can't read the answer without subscribing, please page down to read the answers and the links below.

The most common damage to the system was the DELETE KEY. The damage was mirrored to the other drive and that was that. Same story for corrupted files, virus, trojan and malware. -&gt; Never in 20 years did RAID 1 save anyone I know. RAID 0 paid off for those that wanted speed, and RAID 5 for those that wanted better hardware reliability. Many attempt RAID because they are under the impression it will save them from performing a backup. The lesson about backup appears to be one that many will learn firsthand. Bob
