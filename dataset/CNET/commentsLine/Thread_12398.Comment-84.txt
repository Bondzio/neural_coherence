hi, i think i'm a real idiot!
i can't seem to get the right color settings in photoshop to use with the phaser.
this is probably not the right place to ask, but i'm hoping someone will help me!
i don't see the printer options that ccaputo indicated in this thread.
anyway, i think i've royally screwed my default color workspace too if anyone pities me enough to email me directly with suggestions, please send to ydeocampo@gmail.com!
