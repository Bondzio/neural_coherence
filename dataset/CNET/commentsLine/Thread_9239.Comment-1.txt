i have an asus dvd-rw drive that suddenly doesn't recognize data discs.
they appear in explorer but when i try to read the data the drive opens and asks to insert a disk.
i checked bios and everything is ok, also the drive reads (and plays) music and video disks without problem.
i appreciate any help.
best regards
