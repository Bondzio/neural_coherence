6663	0	331141	2983699	NR	WhereEaglesDareSC	2/19/09 1:25 PM	1.2350499E12	Vertical Lines when playing games	I have a P4 2GHz, 2.5GB RAM, PNY GeForce 8600 GT (w/ 256MB RAM), and I am using a 32&quot; HDTV. I bought the card when I upgraded my old PC to some new super PC about a year ago. About 5 months ago I noticed that when I play games like Crysis, HL2, Age of Conan, Left 4 Dead, Dead Space, and Day of Defeat: Source. I have been monitoring the temp of the video card and it idles at about 56-58c and when under high stress it goes up to 80. PNY tech support said that the card normal operating temp is up to 100c. I tested my RAM with MemTest over 6 hours straight and it found 0 errors. I used the nVidia nTune Stress Test and it finds no errors, but I don't know if that counts for anything. Anyone have any ideas what is causing the lines? BTW I do get some artifacting also. Thanks.

I'm unsure why some need the board to do more than what you reported to motivate them to get it replaced. At least I know the issue and can get it changed out before this company goes under. Bob

I keep boxes and receipts for everything I own for about 6 months after I buy an item. So I have thrown away the receipt and the box, I believe I do have it registered, but no way to show this fact, because I can't get anyone on the phone at PNY's offices to corroborate this. Long story shorter, I can't return it for RMA. Guess I will have to buy a new one and take the lesson learned.

HE suggested taking a spare HDD and loading windows, the drivers, and one game and try it taht way to rule out some software (like Norton) isnt the root of the issue. I'll going to work on that later on, let you know what is happening. Thanks again
