1.1.1	Windows XP on a HP pavilion a230n ... ..	St
1.1.2	Purchased the Canon PIXMA MP500 and I ca n't , nor can Canon support help me to figure out the problem .	St
1.1.3	If I use the Arc Soft Photo Studio or Scansoft Omnipage it will scan just fine , however if i go to the MP Navigator 2.0 it will not scan and a box pops up saying & quot ; the scanner driver supported by this software is not installed , install it and then retry & quot ; ...	St
1.1.4	I spent over 2 hours on the phone to fix it , it was uninstalled , re-installed , started up with windows only and no other programs , downloaded driver and software from canon website , tried to extract drivers off the CD that came with it .	St
1.1.5	Does anyone know the problem or any info on how to fix ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks so much	St
1.2.1	I had the same problem today installing the printer with Vista RC2 .	St
1.2.2	Somehow my scanner got hooked up to what looked like a printer driver .	St
1.2.3	It would scan fine with other problems but would not open the MP Navigator .	St
1.2.4	I actually have an MP830 , but it might work for you .	St
1.2.5	1 .	St
1.2.6	Go into device manager and find the scanner 2 .	St
1.2.7	Right click and choose update driver .	St
1.2.8	3 .	St
1.2.9	After following the screens to select a driver yourself , from the list choose the driver that does n't have the word inkjet in it .	St
1.2.10	My two drivers were something like Canon Inkjot MP830 and Canon MP830 .	St
1.2.11	When I selected the second one , it seemed to work .	St
1.2.12	I hope this helps .	Polite
1.2.13	Grant	St
1.3.1	Thanks so much , I 'm going to go try that now .	St
1.3.2	Have a great weekend !	Polite
1.4.1	I am having the sameproblem with the Canon MP 830 using the MP830 driver .	St
1.4.2	Have you found a solution .	St
1.4.3	Please advise .	St
1.4.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.5	SLK .	St
1.5.1	Spoke to technical help at Canon and spent two and a half hours doing and redoing everything they said but nothing helped .	St
1.5.2	I called back a couple of days ago and went through most of the same thing again .	St
1.5.3	Uninstall , re-install , all of it , parts of it .	St
1.5.4	I was sooooo aggravated ! !	St
1.5.5	Bottom line Canon says its a glitch with my PC and the driver of my Canon printer .	St
1.5.6	He clearly stated its my problem and nothing to do with Canon .	St
1.5.7	I ca n't find anyone else that can help either .	St
1.5.8	I have tried and tried .	St
1.5.9	Best of luck to you with your problem !	St
1.5.10	Kathy	St
1.6.1	HI I did what you sugested , reinstalled driver , no good I am trying to contact MSI the manuf of the motherboard mabe its something else .	St
1.6.2	Any other Ideas .	St
1.6.3	I was abel to do a preview by going to cont pan , scaner camera dbl click on MP 380 but when I tryed to save the file , it when by by .	St
1.6.4	You would think Canon would be more helpful , i guess it takes us bitching on fourms to get there attention , or not .	St
1.7.1	I has same problem with MP800R .	St
1.7.2	On a new system I had installed drivers then MP Navigator .	St
1.7.3	MP Navigator could not find the driver for the scanner .	St
1.7.4	Turned out I needed to install IJ Network Utility ( I was using wired network attach to printer .	St
1.7.5	Once that was installed , then MP Navigator worked .	St
1.8.1	Thanks I will try the IJ Network Utility and see what happens .	St
1.9.1	I used your advise , because I sure do need some right now .	St
1.9.2	I went into my device manager as you instructed , but there was no mention of a scanner driver for me to update nor a printer driver .	St
1.9.3	I have been able to print to my MP830 , but when scanning it locks up on the last step .	St
1.9.4	I 'm running Vista too .	St
1.9.5	Is there anything else you could suggest ?	Ques
1.10.1	For no apparent reason my Canon MP830 simply will not power up .	St
1.10.2	We had some power surges the last few days but I 'm hooked up through a pretty heavy duty surge suppressor .	St
1.10.3	To be sure I ran several other devices off of same surge suppressor and they all worked fine .	St
1.10.4	Anyhow , I unplugged the MP830 I felt more than a little stupid since it would n't power up but I had to do it .	St
1.10.5	Plugged the power cord to different outlets just to be sure and still no power to machine .	St
1.10.6	So there it is .	St
1.10.7	It 's about eight months old and not heavily used as it is my home office machine .	St
1.10.8	I did consider that 1 of the ink tanks may be low but w/o power how can one get to the tanks since they have to position themselves while the machine is powered up ?	Ques
1.10.9	Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.10.10	Thanks .	Polite
1.11.1	Hi -- I was also having trouble with the scanner/MP Navigator .	St
1.11.2	What you have to do is uninstall everything for the Canon MP ... .then turn off the printer ... and UNPLUG the cable that connects the printer to your computer .	St
1.11.3	Now re-install both the software for the MP830 and the drivers ( I was using Vista so I had to go to the website to get an updated driver & software www.canon.com ) .	St
1.11.4	Now , once that is completed , turn the machine back on and plug in the cord that connects the printer to your computer ( this is when it automatically downloads the driver needed for the software to work- MP navigator- and the scanner ) Hope this helps , I FINALLY got mine to work !	St
1.11.5	YEAH !	St
1.12.1	I have this printer , however , I can not find the installation CD that came with it .	St
1.12.2	I want to put it on a new computer , so is there a way to download the installation CD ?	Ques
1.12.3	I have looked online , but ca n't seem to find what I need .	St
1.12.4	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.12.5	AG	St
1.13.1	My printer is still under warranty so I called to see for sure if it can be done , she said it could and here is the info she just gave me ... . www.usa.canon.com click on consumer ... at the top of page click on download library ... under product menu # 1 - multifunction # 2 - inkjet # 3 - pixma mp500 then click go ... make sure pop up blocker is off then click on Drivers / Software when the box pops up choose your windows type and then I agree and download ... where it says save or run click on save to desktop then close it and then she said to restart your pc and it should be ready !	St
1.13.2	I went through the steps and it looks fine to me and I specifically asked if i had to have any of my printer info and she said no .	St
1.13.3	Good luck with it !	St
1.14.1	I had the same problem with my PIXMA MP530 .	St
1.14.2	The problem was , I had the printer plugged into a USB card I had added to my computer .	St
1.14.3	When I moved the USB cord from this one , to a USB outlet that was orginial to the computer even though it was a slower 1.1 USB it worked .	St
1.14.4	I had to delete the driver and the MP Navigator and do a reinstall , but after that it works great .	St
1.15.1	NIL	St
1.16.1	Thank You granterickson , I stumbled on this site , also had the Canon Mp830 scanner navigator problem , but no more ! !	St
1.16.2	!	St
1.17.1	Did you ever figure out the problem .	St
1.17.2	My MP 530 is permanently shut down .	St
1.17.3	Anyone have an idea about this ?	Ques
1.18.1	Then it 's usually a dead printer .	St
1.18.2	Bob	St
1.19.1	Since I did not see anyone offering the following advice , I thought I would contribute back .	St
1.19.2	I too experienced a dead MP830 and also deduced that this happended after a power surge .	St
1.19.3	No matter how good of a surge protector you have , all electronics can fall victim to disruption .	St
1.19.4	So , I decided to call Canon support and they apparently are aware of this dead MP830 issue and you simply need to keep the unit unplugged for 20+ minutes to allow it to fully discharge .	St
1.19.5	Then mine came back to life with power .	St
1.19.6	Cheers , Michael	St
1.20.1	Michael - thanks so much for that simple remedy .	Polite
1.20.2	I unplugged my all-in-one for about 20 minutes and when I plugged it back in - BINGO - it worked perfectly .	St
1.20.3	I thought I was just out of 280.00 and my favorite printer .	St
1.20.4	This is a good day .	Polite
1.20.5	Much Much Thanks Tracy	St
1.21.1	I apologize for not posting my solution but I simply forgot .	St
1.21.2	Anyhow , my resolution was in the interior bottom paper feed being open from when I was in there for some reason that escapes me at the moment .	St
1.21.3	Maybe a jam ... Yeah , it was relief co-mingled with a certain self loathing .	St
1.21.4	Kidding of course , but my fix was definitely operator error .	St
1.21.5	Thanks to all who posted nonetheless .	St
1.22.1	I have looked for the IJ Network Utility and ca n't find it .	St
1.22.2	I am having the same issue .	St
1.22.3	Where can I find/get it ?	Ques
1.22.4	Thanks !	St
1.23.1	Same here , no I 've looked high , I 've looked low and all I see are blank faces looking at me ... does anyone have this file to share ?	Ques
1.24.1	I was furious when my MP830 crapped out from power a surge , even on an UPS/surge protector .	St
1.24.2	It 's a year and a day old , so canon would n't do jack for me .	St
1.24.3	I took it to the trash and ordered a new one .	St
1.24.4	After reading this , I brought back in from the garage and it worked again .	St
1.24.5	Looks like my wife is getting Brother 7420 for Christmas .	St
1.24.6	HA !	St
1.25.1	I have Canon pixma mp170 and i did have same problem with the scanner .	St
1.25.2	I solved the problem by downloading MP navigator 2.02 software for windows vista , instate of downloading Mp navigator 2.0 software for vista .	St
1.26.1	I download the drivers from this site and my scanner started to work inmediately .	St
1.26.2	http : //drivers.softpedia.com/progDownload/Canon-PIXMA-MP500-MP-Navigator-202-Download-50576.html Was really easy	St
1.27.1	Worked exactly the same for me .	St
1.27.2	Electricity had gone out for a couple of minutes .	St
1.27.3	I was ready to throw the MP830 in the garage with all of the other 'blown up ' electronic devices I have been accumalating over the last 20 years .	St
1.27.4	Thank You So Much .	St
1.28.1	Hi , I have lost my MP830 scanner CD and downloaded the software from Canon site and reinstalled .	St
1.28.2	But since then the & quot ; Scan & quot ; button on the printer does n't seem to work .	St
1.28.3	When I press the & quot ; Scan & quot ; and select & quot ; Save to PC & quot ; or similar from the LCD , it used to initiate the scanner software on the PC and start scanning automatically .	St
1.28.4	Does anybody have the same problem with the software from the Canon site ?	Ques
1.28.5	It seems to me that the software on the Canon site is not complete .	St
1.28.6	Does anybody here have the full MP830 installation CD ?	Ques
1.28.7	Thanks	Polite
1.29.1	Thanks for the link .	St
1.29.2	I can now scan using the Navigator .	St
1.29.3	I am still unable to scan by pushing the buttons on the mp500 .	St
1.29.4	But at least I can scan now .	St
1.30.1	I tried the same procedure that was suggested for the MP830 ... .I unplugged it for one hour .	St
1.30.2	When I plugged it back in the machine was able to power up and work properly .	St
1.30.3	Our power went out yesterday and I think there were probably a couple of surges as it came back on .	St
1.30.4	Although I 'm glad the printer is now working , I 'm a little disappointed it was the only one of my devices that was affacted out of the 20+ pieces of electronic equipment I probably have plugged in .	St
1.30.5	Also , for such an easy fix , it 's amazing I could not find reference to this in the Canon Knowledge Base .	St
1.30.6	Overall , I 've been very pleased with my MP530 .	St
1.31.1	I had the same problem with my MP450 .	St
1.31.2	To fix the problem I went to Canon website and downloaded and installed the latest MP Navigator 2.02 Works fine now .	St
1.32.1	I am vacationing in TN and forgot my printer .	St
1.32.2	I found a guy selling a MP830 for $ 80 and I offered $ 60 and he said yes .	St
1.32.3	He had XP and I have Vista .	St
1.32.4	Needless to say nothing worked.I installed his Cd and also Canon sortware .	St
1.32.5	Everything worked except when I tried to scan to a PDF file .	St
1.32.6	No MP Navigator .	St
1.32.7	Downloaded it and got the & quot ; no connect & quot ; error .	St
1.32.8	Documentation said Vista could have this propblem !	St
1.32.9	Tried what you said and everything worked !	St
1.32.10	The wife does n't know the work that goes into solving these problems or the joy in finally getting it done .	St
1.32.11	Thaanks again , Jerry K	St
1.33.1	I got mself a Canon PM240 multifunctional printer .	St
1.33.2	On the box it says the scanner scans with a resolution of 1200 x 2400 dpi , but mine will only work on 600 dpi resolution .	St
1.33.3	How can i solve this problem ?	Ques
1.33.4	on the advanced settings i click on 1200 dpi , but it gives me really bad scannings .	St
1.33.5	600 dpi is decent but not what i need .	St
1.34.1	Same problem .	St
1.34.2	Got the MP830 over a year ago , great machine .	St
1.34.3	Until today .	St
1.34.4	print and fax fine but will not print through either presto manager or MP navigator .	St
1.34.5	Can not scan either manually since it must send the file to the & quot ; bad & quot ; application .	St
1.34.6	Try to reinstalled driver from CD , then downloaded a newer driver from the Canon website .	St
1.34.7	Still same problem .	St
1.34.8	Hoever , when I go to the actual device ( through control panel ) and find the scanner , I can scan there .	St
1.34.9	Crazy .	St
1.34.10	I am running Windows XP 2002 .	St
1.35.1	i have an mp830 and got a new vista pc - printer worked ok but mp navigator could n't find scanner driver .	St
1.35.2	your solution saved me lots of time and angst .	Sug
1.35.3	thanks again	Polite
1.36.1	Thanks mwcarey for that tip .	St
1.36.2	It worked !	St
1.36.3	Yay ! !	St
1.36.4	!	St
1.37.1	How timely- I 'm having the same issue on Vista as of yesterday ( new Toshiba laptop , and was the first time we needed to use the scanner yesterday ) .	St
1.37.2	Downloaded the new drivers and MP Navigator 2.02 from the Canon website ( for Vista 32 bit , as that 's what we have ) .	St
1.37.3	Printer works fine , but ... when trying to scan from MP Navigator 2.02 , it just says & quot ; scanning & quot ; and gives me an hour glass .	St
1.37.4	The scanner never activates or does anything .	St
1.37.5	When I look at task manager , mpscan.exe is running , using about 45 % of the cpu .	St
1.37.6	After 5 minutes , I have to kill MP Navigator via the task manager , 'cause it 's simply hung .	St
1.37.7	We also have Picasa 3 for photo editing .	St
1.37.8	It has the ability to & quot ; launch & quot ; the scanner , and when we do that , the scanner works fine .	St
1.37.9	We prefer using MP Navigator though .	St
1.37.10	It 's frustrating- scanner works fine with Picasa 3 , but ... does n't work with the latest MP Navigator .	St
1.38.1	I figured out how to fix the scan issue with the canon pixma mp500 all in one printer/scanner .	St
1.38.2	Download and install all the software available from the canon website .	St
1.38.3	The link is here : http : //www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_mp_series/pixma_mp500 Go to CONTROL PANEL & gt ; PRINTERS AND OTHER HARDWARE & gt ; ADD A PRINTER .	St
1.38.4	Follow through with the instructions to use a plug and play installation method .	St
1.38.5	( I 'm running windows XP , no guaranty this will work for other OS .	St
1.38.6	After this I was able to open the MP Navigator 2.0 it recognized everything Hope this helps everyone else that had the same problem	St
1.39.1	Where do you download the scanner driver .	St
1.39.2	i have an mp navigator but it says & quot ; the scanner driver supported by this software is not installed .	St
1.39.3	Install it and then retry. & quot ; whene ever i try to open the mp navigator	St
1.40.1	After 2 days of uninstalling and reinstalling cannon mp 500 mine would still not scan and everytime I reinstalled it would say mp navigator 2.0 has the latest updates and would not go any further so I decided to look on my computer for the mp navigator found it and deleted it then reinstalled it and it scans now If you want to scan go to the start menu , all programs , cannon utilities listed in the cannon utilities is mp navigator 2.0 it will say mp navigator uninstall click it then reinstall the disc	St
1.41.1	Go into printer properties , click on hardware , under Canon inkjet click on properties , click on driver , click on update driver , click on 'browse my computer ' , click on 'let me choose ' , click on 'canon inkjet mp500 ' not on canon mp500 , click next and install the driver .	St
1.41.2	Now when you click the scan button on the MP500 a popup window will appear so that you can click on Scan .	St
1.41.3	I 'm soooo excited .	St
1.42.1	I thought I had a boat anchor , unplugged my MP830 for 20 minutes , plugged it back in ... I 'm back in business !	St
1.43.1	I found a solution by unistalling all of the Canon software , restarting , reinstalling and plugging in the powered on unit , only after the installation was complete .	St
1.43.2	When you plug the printer in AFTER the install , it will find the device and install all three drivers that are required ( printer , scanner & fax ) .	St
1.43.3	To properly remove all of the software make sure to remove the printer from the & quot ; Devices and Printers & quot ; section and unistall it from the control panel ( mpnavigator and the printer ) .	St
1.43.4	Reboot !	St
1.43.5	( important ! )	St
1.43.6	After a reboot , confirm that the software is no longer installed and reinstall the printer and plug in the USB AFTER the installation has completed and wait about 5 minutes .	St
1.43.7	Reboot .	St
1.43.8	Now the MP Navigator software should function properly .	St
1.43.9	This is why we follow instructions !	St
1.43.10	Always install software before plugging in your hardware .	St
