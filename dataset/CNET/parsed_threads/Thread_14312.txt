<s> Hey guys, I'm trying to get a clear answer here so I hope you can help me. </s>
<s> I'm about to change from a past decade old 17&quot; CRT to an LCD for the first time. </s>
<s> Going to get a 19' standard this time around and when more applications support widescreen then I'll upgrade. </s>
<s> For the moment though I know that the size of the lcd will give a 1280x1024 reso. </s>
<s> I've been told that lcd worked best on their native resolution and even though that is obvious I would like to know how it responds to lower settings. </s>
<s> I'm an old school gamer. </s>
<s> I play games like Master Of Orion 2 and I still love my Starcraft and Diablo to name a few. </s>
<s> How would these look on an lcd? </s>
<s> I would be really disapointed in getting a screen that couldn't show some decently my all time fav games. </s>
<s> If brand helps in this query. </s>
<s> I'm currently looking at the Samsung 932BF and the LG L1900R - both at 2ms and at 2000:1 and 3000:1 respectively of contrast ratio. </s>
<s> Thx </s>
<s> It works from 320x200 all the way up to it's native resolution. </s>
<s> Hope this answers that question. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That's great but how is the quality. </s>
<s> Working is fine, but if the quality is unbearable that doesn't solve my issue. </s>
<s> I expect a shot in quality but to a certain limit only. </s>
<s> 19&quot; LCDs although not Samsung but equal in the specs. </s>
<s> Two are wide screen, the other is standard. </s>
<s> You'll love yours. </s>
<s> One thing you didn't mention is your video card. </s>
<s> Will it support the native resolution of the proposed LCD? </s>
<s> The reason I ask is I recently purchased a 22&quot; and was excited to hook it up. </s>
<s> Although my high end nVidia 256 Meg video card supported a gazillion resolutions, the specific native of the 22&quot; was not listed. </s>
<s> In tears I returned it. </s>
<s> Quality is a subjective item. </s>
<s> Here it looks exactly as I expect a 320x200 or such display to look like. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The card is an Nvidia 8600gts. </s>
<s> This may vary by OS. </s>
<s> If I R/C the desktop... select properties/settings I find a slider. </s>
<s> It's my res adjuster. </s>
<s> As I move the slider left/right I think it's trying to tell me what res my vid card can handle. </s>
<s> Perhaps worth a look to see if the #'s match. </s>
<s> I'm well familiar with resolutions. </s>
<s> But the specific one for that monitor was not listed. </s>
<s> I could set it a little below and the picture, specifically text was not good. </s>
<s> Above the native and I got the screen message, &quot;Out of Range!&quot;. </s>
<s> Well I finally took the plunged and aquired last night the Samsung I had mentioned. </s>
<s> Wow!!! </s>
<s> Talk about an improvement. </s>
<s> I'm still tweaking the settings but already I am impressed. </s>
<s> After much research my fears about how older games would look like had abated a bit. </s>
<s> I loaded up Master of Orion 2 and found out that I could play with native resolution by &quot;changing&quot; it to what was required for me to play (640x480 for this game). </s>
<s> I'm not sure if that is standard but my video card allowed me this. </s>
<s> It looks a tad bit soft but its nothing major. </s>
<s> Came with a DVI corde so I was all set. </s>
<s> YAY!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
