I can access the internet via each computers but cannot do any printer or file sharing. I have managed to make the printers (SHARED) on each computer, but when I run the (Add Printer Wizard) and browse for other printers on my network, the wizard cannot find any. All it finds is (Microsoft windows network). All firewall are off. Please help. thanks. whpoteat.

Go figure. Sorry that I can't list all the names, but I shared the Zonealarm issue in hopes you can work with the clues. Cheers, Bob

For the printer name put the computer share name followed by the printer share name (e.g. \\my-computer\my-printer). Then point it to a print driver and !viola. You can also browse to the share and install it that way as well. The easiest way to do this is Start&gt;Run...in the Open box type in the computer name you are trying to connect to \\my-computer then click OK. The whack-whack bars are needed for the computer to understand you are looking for a network name. This should open the shares on the \\my-computer. You should notice the printer that you shared by the name you have given it. Double-click the printer and it should prompt you for installation. Hope this helps a bit. Edward Fox

Make sure you have a user account with permission granted that is the same name you use to sign in on the other computer. If your sign in name is John Smith, create a user account with that name on the other computer and grant full access. Worked for me. Good luck.

Is it connected to the main PC (the one with the router) or is it connected to an access point on the network? I don't think that a printer with a parallel connection to the main PC can print jobs from other PCs connected wirelessly. As far as I know, the printer must be on an access point which is part of the wireless network. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong because I had the same problem and was never able to share the printer with my wireless PCs. I currently have one PC connected via ethernet and I can print from that one.

7633	14	121716	2335048	1390204	linkit	11/30/06 2:38 PM	1.16489748E12	Usually not a hardware issue	Regardless of whether the printer is SHARED (connected directly to a computer) or NETWORKED (connected directly to a switch, router, WAP, etc.), the problem is usually a personal firewall issue (software on each computer). The firewalls need to permit the IP ADDRESSES of all computers, printers, and other devices that need talk to one another. The problem is that many don't even know that a firewall is running on their computers; and if they do know one is running, they have no idea that the firewall needs to be configured to permit such communication. Some newer firewalls autodetect the range of IP addresses of the local network and permit those by default. Other firewalls have to be told what specific IP addresses or range of IP addresses are permitted or to be trusted. * * * * * The computer that hosts a shared printer doesn't care (or even know) how other computers connect (wired or wireless) to the the network. Also, it doesn't matter if the printer is connected via parallel, USB, or other method.
