you would be better off replacing the systems with modern systems rather than upgrading the memory.
the newer systems out today are 3 times the speed of your existing systems.
at quarter end dell was selling 2.6ghz systems with 512meg of memory for $654, including office and windows xp pro.
that would be a much better choice than upgrading your old hardware with way overpriced memory.
i have my clients avoid the optiplex or precision dell systems because they are overpriced.
the only reason to buy them is if you need dual processors or a scsi raid array.
some people don't notice that the dimension are much lower priced and just as fast, only difference is that if you buy 100 of them the optiplex and precision would have identical brand hard drives and cd drives.
