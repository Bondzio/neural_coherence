If you looked at very early computers that used tubes, they often had a rudimentary backplane.
Later these advanced to such as the VMEBUS http://duckduckgo.com/?q=vmebus+backplane and for the personal computers the S-100 was very common.
With the Apple 1 you see the beginnings of the motherboard where the computer was small enough to be put directly on the backplane.
