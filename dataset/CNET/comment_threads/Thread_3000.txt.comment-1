I bought a new cheap X-Link Internal 56K Modem.
I put it in the PCI slot, I adjusted the volume to the max, then dialed.
But whalla, no sound.
I figured out that the new modem has no speaker compare to my old one.
I just want to know if there are any way to hear the sound of dialing by using my own PC Speaker (since the modem don't have speaker, so I think using the PC Speaker is possible).
If it's possible kindly tell me how to do it.
I know this is possible because there are some computers that I know that when it dials, the sound comes through the PC Speaker itself.
