Now I have an OS with similar capabilities as the UNIX box. I can also boot up Solaris on another PC (free to install today I here) and FTP the file from the Solaris or Linux machine to the Windows machine. All I offer are possible solutions. Given the vagueness of the MO media and it's file system that's all I can offer. Bob
