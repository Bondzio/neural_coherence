do this: when you u turn on your pc go to CMOS utility by pressing &quot;delete&quot; on startup!!
then go to &quot;ADVANCED BIOS FEATURE&quot; check your &quot;BOOT DEVICES&quot; make 1st Boot device ur new hard disk and 2nd boot device ur old hard disk if it doesnt work try it vice versa!!
and if doesnt work then turn off ur new hard disk to BOOT!!
just make 1st boot device ur old hard disk and 2nd Boot device - cdrom or disabled!!!
dont boot ur new hard disk!!
so ur computer will read the old hard disk!
try it!!!
