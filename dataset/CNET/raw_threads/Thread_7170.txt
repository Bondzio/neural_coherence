I'm currently looking at a used - Dell PowerEdge SC1425 blade server for about $200. But I've always worked with desktops, I know little about servers. If someone has any other suggestions on what to look for to deploy an OS over a small network, please let me know. Should I look at a server like this or just build a desktop type server?
