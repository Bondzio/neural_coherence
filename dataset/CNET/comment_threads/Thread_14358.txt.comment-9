bought in the last year or so come with that little black barrel thing to use as a speaker.
Very confusing for a few reasons.
Some BIOSes do not give the single beep when everything is OK, some mobos have the speaker on pins 1 and 3 others use 1 and 4, and the mobo manual does not normally tell whether one will get a single beep for a good boot, so between that and the crappy little device it got frustrating.
