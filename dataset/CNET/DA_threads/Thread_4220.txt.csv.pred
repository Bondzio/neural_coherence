1.1.1	from past experience with LCD tvs, i know that the native resolution of an LCD always produces the best picture.	St
1.1.2	i just bought a Samsung 32&quot; LCD hdtv (LN-T3253H), and was planning on hooking my laptop up to it, but my laptop does not output WXGA (1366X768).	St
1.1.3	is there any way to make a video output at this resolution?	St
1.1.4	if not what is the best resolution to run an LCD TV at?	St
1.1.5	just for reference: i will be using a the TV's VGA input, also my laptop has a nvidia Geforce GO 7600 PCI-E video card.	St
1.1.6	thanks!	St
1.2.1	that's the resolution of 720p so most LCD TVs render it nicely.	St
1.2.2	depending on your laptop's graphics chip, you may be able to manually add the 1366x768 resolution.	St
