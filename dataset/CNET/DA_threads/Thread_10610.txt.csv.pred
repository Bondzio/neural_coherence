1.2.1	Is this a used hard drive with a previous installation of Windows ?	Ques
1.2.2	If so , from XP and upward , it 's not going to run on hardware other than that it was installed on .	St
1.2.3	Your best bet is to erase the drive by deleting all partitions first .	St
1.2.4	Then , boot from your Windows CD to begin the installation .	St
1.2.5	It will create the partition , format the drive , and install itself .	St
1.2.6	As long as the hard drive is recognized in the BIOS and compatible with your version of Windows , this should get you started .	St
1.2.7	Of course you 'll need to have driver disks handy including those for the motherboard .	St

1.4.5	If any media defects are found , chuck the drive and get another one .	St
