imho, the hp 7330n is a better and faster system, which probably has only two drawbacks for your stated use.
one, is the lack of dual tuners.
you can fix that either by an external usb tuner or a ati all-in-wonder card such as x800 or x1600.
two, is the integrated x200 radeon graphics.
that is resolvable by using the above aiw, or a card such as nvidia's 6800gs or better.
(any faster card would require that you upgrade the pwer supply too...) the biggest advantages over the dell are the x2 4200 vs the p4 3.0 and the much bigger hard drive.
plus that the 5150 is discontinued in favor of the e510 series..
