<s> I have an Epson RX500 that's just over a year old. </s>
<s> Meaning, just out of warranty. </s>
<s> I've now got a hardware problem that appears to be related to the print head location/movement. </s>
<s> The error message simply reads &quot;Printer error - See your documentation and call service if necessary&quot; Very helpful, not! </s>
<s> Since its out of warranty, I'm torn between paying to fix it, or just trashing it altogether. </s>
<s> The local Best Buy wants $50 just to look at it, plus parts and labor on top of that. </s>
<s> The repair cost could easily eclipse the cost of a new multifunction unit. </s>
<s> I just hate to have to throw out what was a decent, relatively new printer! </s>
<s> What would you do? </s>
<s> It's not worth getting it fixed. </s>
<s> The repair will be at least $100.00($50.00 repair estimate with another min. </s>
<s> $50.00 in labor and parts). </s>
<s> We are a throw away society. </s>
<s> Costs less to replace than to fix. </s>
<s> I hate to say it but I think you'd be better off tossing it out and buying new. </s>
<s> The same holds true for most monitors as well. </s>
<s> When it cost's more to upgrade or fix something than buying new something just seems wrong with the world huh? </s>
