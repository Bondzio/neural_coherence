does it have sp1 on it, sp2??
can you start the install again and have it remove all partitons and then start the install again.
normally it will check the quality of the partiton that it will install itself on before it actually writes to the drive.
do you have a win 98 boot floppy?
maybe you can use that to remove any partitions on the drive to start over.
of course it won't be able to see the ntfs partition if one was created.
can you go to the hitachi site and download their diagnostic tools?
put them on a floppy and they should thoroughly check the drive.
