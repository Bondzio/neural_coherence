I recently bought a WD Mybook Pro 500gig external hard drive. i reformatted it to NTSF... when i plug this into my mac, I'm inable to put any files onto it. when i look at properties of the drive it says &quot;you can read only&quot;. I formatted the drive on my XP desktop...im clueless so any help you guys have would be greatly appreciateed
