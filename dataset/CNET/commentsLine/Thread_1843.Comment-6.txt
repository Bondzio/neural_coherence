you did not say what kind of computer you have.
name brand or custom.
some name brands have a non standard ps size, like some emachines have a small 120 watt supply and there are a few others like that.
so you will have to do some fact finding to get the correct one.
hopefully the other parts are ok, but the only way to find out is get a new ps and see what happnes.
