<s> I just talked to Dell support, who I got my laptop through, and they said the biggest fastest drive I could upgrade to is 100GB and 7200 RPM. </s>
<s> Although I'll probably follow these requirements, I was just wondering why the size of hard drives in laptops is limited. </s>
<s> Anyone know? </s>
<s> What if I put in a 320GB hard drive? </s>
<s> Would it work? </s>
<s> oh yeah, if I did upgrade my hard drive, is there some kind of program already installed (I have XP Media Center Edition) that can make a complete transfer of all my data to the new drive or would I have to download a special program? </s>
<s> There are 3 limits here; - the hard disk itself (it must be a 2&quot; inch one) - the BIOS (depends on the model of Dell) - the OS Without knowing details on the machine, we don't know the limits of the BIOS. </s>
<s> Dell does, but maybe you can tell us? </s>
<s> To clone the drive, you'll need some place that has access to both drives. </s>
<s> And that won't be your laptop if that has only one drive. </s>
<s> The best thing to do: use the cloning software that comes with your new drive and mount it in an external enclosure to do the cloning. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> If they support the 100GB you can go to 127GB without issue. </s>
<s> You didn't share model, the OS on the restore CDs so this is my answer. </s>

<s> ok It's an Inspiron 6400 E1505. </s>
<s> Do you know why the operating system and motherboard limit the size? </s>
<s> I just built a desktop pc, and it had no such restrictions. </s>
<s> What's so different between the two, besides their bulk? </s>
<s> Let's say your restore CDs are &quot;XP Home.&quot; Since those don't have SP1 then the limit is there. </s>
<s> Widely documented so I'll stop here. </s>
<s> So even a desktop with XP Home without SP1 couldn't accept use a bigger hard drive? </s>
<s> Sorry, I'm a noob. </s>
<s> My laptop is a XP Media Center Edition with SP2. </s>
<s> -&gt; READ http://www.48bitlba.com Sorry I should have put that in my reply before. </s>
<s> that makes sense. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> It's actually XP Pro SP2. </s>
<s> My mistake, I forgot I changed its appearance to that of the Media Center Edition. </s>
