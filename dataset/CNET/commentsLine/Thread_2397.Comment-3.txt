i finally had some spare time to try your suggestion.
i re-installed (lucky i had made a restore point before installing) as per your instructions and so far, everything looks good!
the only bump-in-the-road (and maybe someone else has had the same issue) was that it was looking for the wiafbdrv.dll driver file.
i had to extract it out from the c:\windows\driver cache\i386\driver.cab to the visioneer folder so that it could locate it and then it was happy.
i also used your instructions regarding the select source.
thanks again.
