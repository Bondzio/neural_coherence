1.1.1	Ok , ive managed to obtain a cheap pentium 4 2ghz system , to replace the durno 1ghz system at my church .	St
1.1.2	The current system is used to project the words to the songs so it has two graphics cards ( for dula scrren display , one to a monitor , and one to a projector ) Here is the spec of the current system Duron 1ghz ECS Elite Group K7S5A Mother Board ( http : //www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Downloads/ProductsDetail_Download.aspx ? detailid=74 & DetailName=Manual & DetailDesc=K7S5A % 20 % 20 ( V1.1 ) & CategoryID=1 & MenuID=82 & LanID=0 ) ATI RV2P-B3 PCI Graphics card DVI , VGA and component out ( sorry couldnt find specs ) Aopen 02948V1 AGP VGA out ( sorry couldnt find any specs ) The new system : P4 2ghz MSI MS6526 ver 3 ( http : //global.msi.com.tw/index.php ? func=downloaddetail & type=manual & maincat_no=1 & prod_no=491 ) I dont tink i will need to use the on borad vga of the mother board , or the agp graphics card , as the projector has a dvi connection , but my question is could if needed ?	Ques
1.1.3	Both have agp 4x slots , but the MSI states that it must be a 1.5v card are all agp 4x cards 1.5 volt ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks Phill	Polite
1.2.1	& quot ; the MSI states that it must be a 1.5v card are all agp 4x cards 1.5 volt ? & quot ; No .	Ques
1.2.2	When I read this it states that for 4X the card must support 1.5 Volt .	St
1.2.3	It 's very confusing to most that the AGP voltage is not set by the motherboard but by the card you put in .	St
1.2.4	And there are KEYS in the slots to stop you from plugging in an incompatible card .	St
1.2.5	Sorry but I decline to re-explain this further .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	thanks bob , the ECS board manual states that the agp slot is 2.0 complient , so could the card be swaped over directly with out finding the spefication of hte card ?	Ques
1.3.2	Phill	St
1.4.1	I noted the keys to stop you from plugging in a card that wo n't be compatible .	St
1.4.2	What more could we need to know ?	Ques
1.5.1	just noticed you were my lecturer at wiltshire college : -D yeah ?	Ques
1.6.1	managed to find out more info on the gfx card , the modle is GF4MX440SE-V64 ( A8 ) and can be found at this page : http : //global.aopen.com/Museum.aspx under apg it says : & quot ; AGP Bus Rate : 1X , 2X , 4X & quot ; this doesnt tell me that its 1.5v .	St
1.6.2	So can it be said that its compatable , the keying on the card is done by two slots , in the old motherboard , none ?	Ques
