The E310 is an entry level type PC.
Definitely not a gamer.
Too little amount of RAM (only 512MB....XP needs that much, the integrated video is 128 SHARED memory), a midrange speed CPU and &quot;NO&quot; AGP or PCI Express 16x slot for a better graphics card.
You'll have to find a PCI or an even more rare PCIe 1x graphics card for the system.
You are restricted to the integrated ( Intel GMA 950 graphics of the 915G chipset) to the chip on the mobo.
