<s> I had Kodak easy share photo printer 500. </s>
<s> It worked OK for about two years, and I made hundreds of pictures using it. </s>
<s> Quality is quite adequate for an amatuer. </s>
<s> Professional photographers would not use it, probably. </s>
<s> PH-160 paper kits allowed to keep price per print to be around 28 cents. </s>
<s> Then it broke. </s>
<s> Customer service was not real good... </s>
<s> They also told me it is discontinued... Now I need a dye sublimation printer replacement. </s>
<s> Is there anything like printer 500 on the market, please? </s>
<s> I expect the price to be around $200 or so. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> At this price range you are buying 2 year printers. </s>
<s> Why not another one? </s>
<s> For under 200 I see six models at http://store.kodak.com/store/ekconsus/en_US/list/All-in-One_Printers/categoryID.28889300 Again, you may feel burned up about 2 year printers but that is about what these last for. </s>
<s> Repair is not possible since the new one costs less than repairs. </s>
