1.1.1	Hi ; Got a 3-4 yr. old Acer Aspire 4738Z that does the following sporatically : * refreshes web pages * changes default browser * reinstalls Windows updates that it 's already installed * external keyboard ( internal no longer works ) suddenly wo n't type certain keys * opens MS Outlook all_the_time ( close it , reopens ) Once ( wrote about this earlier ) it shut the whole computer down and would n't even let me into BIOS , let alone boot Windows .	St
1.1.2	Where do I begin trouble-shooting this ?	Ques
1.1.3	TIA , John	St
1.2.1	Boot off any Live OS CD ( too many to choose from today ) and see if the keyboard works .	St
1.2.2	If not , start with fixing that as stuck keys can do what you noted .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Occasionally it 's the keyboard .	St
1.3.2	But it works fine in another computer , and goes back to working fine in this one as well when I reboot .	St
1.3.3	Like I said originally in the first post where I enumerated all sorts of strange problems , that 's just one of many .	St
1.3.4	No stuck keys .	St
1.3.5	John	St
1.4.1	A clean install will clear that up .	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	It sounds as if you have a corrupted system possibly due to virus/malware infestation ( s ) .	St
1.5.2	You said nothing about A/V security software , scans etc .	St
1.5.3	Mr. Proffitt suggested a reload ( Windows ) ..IMOP likely the easiest way out .	St
1.6.1	Thanks , all !	St
1.6.2	John	St
