<s> I just bought the below and was wondering if I should also invest in a graphics card or not? </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me their thoughts on the following. </s>
<s> Intel Core i7-3770 Ivy Bridge 3.4GHz (3.9GHz Turbo) LGA 1155 77W Quad-Core Desktop Processor Intel HD Graphics 4000 ASUS SABERTOOTH Z77 LGA 1155 Intel Z77 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) Desktop Memory Model F3-1600C9D-16GXM Intel 520 Series Cherryville SSDSC2CW240A3K5 2.5&quot; 240GB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) CORSAIR Professional Series HX750 (CMPSU-750HX) 750W ATX12V 2.3 / EPS12V 2.91 SLI Ready CrossFire Ready 80 PLUS SILVER Certified Modular Active PFC Power Supply Corsair Graphite Series 600T CC600TM Mid-Tower Gaming Case Also, should I buy Thermal compounds? </s>
<s> The CPU came its a CPU cooler but didn't have any thermal paste. </s>

<s> I think you have inadvertently revealed why so many folk build a PC and it results in a machine that just crashes. </s>
<s> As to the graphics card, I'll supply the list I like but without knowing about the use of the machine I have no reason to pick one. </s>
<s> Nice choice on the SSD. </s>
<s> I see less woes with that line. </s>
<s> Here's the list: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html Bob </s>
<s> Okay sounds like I should order that. </s>
<s> Purpose is casual gaming, and hd movies to tv via hdmi. </s>
<s> As to which card, it's usually a matter of &quot;the budget.&quot; </s>
<s> Test the machine with the 4000 igp and your apps. </s>
<s> If it works to your satisfaction........your good to go. </s>
<s> If not......move on to the list from R.P. </s>
<s> If so, these tend to come with a thermal pad that heats and spreads during the first uses. </s>
<s> It just looks like a square piece of tape on the heatsink. </s>
<s> If it's there, you don't want to put thermal paste on top of it. </s>
<s> I've not had problems with Intel thermal pads though some will advise to remove them and use pastes with silver powder in the blend. </s>
<s> I'd think those same people tend to recommend scrapping the Intel HSF and replacing the entire thing with something heavy duty if the user plans to OC or do heavy gaming. </s>
