<s> Hi, I have 2 (1 old, 1 new) computers (The old one running Windows XP Professional and the new one running Windows XP Professional SP2) that are sharing the same cable net connection through a Linksys WRT54GC router. </s>
<s> This configuration worked for a couple of years but now, only the new computer will connect to the internet. </s>
<s> The old computer doesn't connect at all. </s>
<s> I have already tried: 1) Restarting the Computer 2) Powercycling the Modem and Router That didn't fix it. </s>
<s> Also, I notice that when I restart the old computer, in IPCONFIG, everything seems correct, but the internet connection doesn't work. </s>
<s> Here are the settings: Connection-specific DNS suffix: ok.shawcable.net IP Address: 192.168.1.101 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 Then, I enter the command ipconfig /release and I get this Connection-specific DNS suffix: IP Address: 0.0.0.0 Subnet Mask: 0.0.0.0 Default Gateway: Then, I enter ipconfig /renew and I get this error: An error ocurred when renewing interface Local Area Connection : unable to contact your DHCP server. </s>
<s> Request has timed out. </s>
<s> Then, I enter the command IPCONFIG again and I see this configuration: Connection-specific DNS suffix: Autoconfiguration IP Address: 169.254.78.32 Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0 Default Gateway: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I just think its weird how one computer can connect to the net and one cant. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> is to update the old one to SP2. </s>
<s> There are enhanced networking applications in SP2. </s>
<s> Second thing is to update the router firmware. </s>
<s> Third - move the Ethernet cable to another port on the router. </s>
<s> One port may have gone bad. </s>
<s> Fourth - replace the NIC. </s>
<s> Or just for grins, swap it with the working one, see if the problems moves. </s>
<s> That oddball IP address 169.254.78.32 comes up when the NIC cannot access the LAN. </s>

<s> 5 dB hot. </s>
<s> First of all, I can't update the older one to SP2 because last time I attempted to install SP2 on the computer, the computer locked up in the middle of installation and wouldn't boot and the OS had to be reinstalled. </s>
<s> I'll try and update the router firmware and see what happens. </s>
<s> I'l also try plugging the cable into another port on the router. </s>
<s> I really don't want to replace or move the NIC. </s>
<s> Thanx for the help </s>
<s> trading connections and see if one works or both. </s>
<s> Could make your guesswork easier in narrowing down the problem. </s>
