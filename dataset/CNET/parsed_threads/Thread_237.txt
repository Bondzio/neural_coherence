<s> I'm thinking about going to a faster internet connection than the dial up I have now. </s>
<s> I can only get an ADSL connection. </s>
<s> The modem supplied for this has a USB 1 and an Ethernet RJ45 socket. </s>
<s> The ISP recommends using the Ethernet connection over the USB if your pc has one - which my motherboard does not. </s>
<s> I have seen Ethernet PCI cards available. </s>
<s> Would installing a card be the way to for my internet connection, or are Ethernet cards supposed to be used only for LANs ? </s>
<s> Find an ethernet card, either online or some local vendor. </s>
<s> They're very common and see no great hassle getting one. </s>
<s> Understand once you connect to the ADSL link &quot;you are part of a network&quot; or LAN, in this case a WAN. </s>
<s> And yes, the ethernet connection will be much faster than USB. </s>
<s> You'll want a PCI type ethernet card. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> How old is your PC??? </s>
<s> They have been putting built in ethernet RJ45 on MBs for a couple of years. </s>
<s> The cards are inexpensive $10~15 easy to install. </s>
<s> My ASDL kit came with one. </s>
<s> DO NOT USE USB!!!! </s>
<s> Many problems. </s>

<s> My pc is four years old. </s>
<s> It's a Microstar International i850 motherboard with an Intel P4 1.7ghz processor. </s>
<s> It is odd that it doens't have an RJ45 socket when one of my other family's member's older P3 does. </s>
<s> The tower has the blank for the RJ45 next to the USB sockets. </s>
<s> It does have five pci slots so I'll just get a card. </s>
<s> There are alot on ebay. </s>
<s> I had heard that using the USB1.1 for ADSL was dodgy, and slow. </s>
<s> Thanks for your advice. </s>
