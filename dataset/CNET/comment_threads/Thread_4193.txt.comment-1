So I just bought a 4GB Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo for my cell, and it came with an adapter, so I can plug it into my laptop.
However, every time I do, I get a lovely blue screen and a free restart.
When I put the 256MB SanDisk that came with the phone in the adapter, it works fine.
What's the deal?
Any way to fix it?
Thanks!
