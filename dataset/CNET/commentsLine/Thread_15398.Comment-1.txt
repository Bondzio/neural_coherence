we had a lightning strike close by a few weeks ago and everything is plugged into a surge protector that shows it is working properly with no damaged.
my printer has a constant buzzing when plugged in now (i think it is shot).
anyway, since then my monitor works and my computer boots up, but the mouse and keyboard were not working (wireless) and i could not log into my account in xp pro.
i grabbed my son's wired mouse and keyboard to use for the computer and they don't work either.
i have tried every usb port on the computer (dell precision), which has 2 in front and at least 6 in the back, and they don't work as well.
the mouse shows lit up on the bottom and the keyboard lights go on when i first plug it into the port, but go off after 1-2 seconds.
the usbs in the front give enough power that the external hard drive lights are on when computer goes on and the card reader light is on as well.
can someone please help me and let me know what the problem is.
i want the info off of the hard drive at the least, but would like to have the desktop working.
thanks in advance, steven
