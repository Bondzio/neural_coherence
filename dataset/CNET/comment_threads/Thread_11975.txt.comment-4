I looked at your router and it doesn't do bridge mode.
I decline to teach what a BRIDGE is but armed with the proper name you can research what to use.
My setup works fab since I get 2 times the possible wifi speed (split over the 2 channels) and &quot;it works.&quot; I can't guess what you are trying to do but will guess you didn't want to pick up a couple more wifi client adapters.
