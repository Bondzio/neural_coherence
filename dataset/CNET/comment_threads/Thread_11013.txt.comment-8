You sir are absolutely right, thank you for your help amd have a great week.
And for your question, one db is not much, but two, three db is almost and twice as weak signal.
im trying to establish a long range tunnel to connect to a device wireless, which is why i need the best focusing antenna i can get my hands on, one that is portable.
