i have an old pc (compaq presario 4910) that i haven't used in years.
today, i realized i might have some old files on it that i might want to see again, so i hooked it back up.
unfortunately, after the standard compaq screen and password check, i received this error: invalid system disk replace the disk, and then press any key i remember that in the days leading up to the purchase of my current pc, i deleted a lot of excess files, but i didn't think i did anything to hurt my computer.
maybe i was wrong.
what happened?
what does &quot;invalid system disk&quot; mean?
how can i fix it?
thanks in advance.
