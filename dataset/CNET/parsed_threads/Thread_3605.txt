<s> HI all, I want to assemble a computer...but i have no direct experience. </s>
<s> I want a step by step account to construct a celeron 1.7 GHz processor system.....right from the 'putting it together' phase to the 'frequency setting and other BIOS settings' phase. </s>
<s> I have knowledge of computer hardware but i have never done it by myself. </s>
<s> I am definately going to take some help, but it would be nice if some one knows useful sites with proper documentation and pictures. </s>
<s> thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Unmesh </s>
<s> http://www.pcmech.com/byopc/ covers all if not most of the steps. </s>
<s> BUT let me write about the risk factor. </s>
<s> As the designer and builder of the new PC, you are buying in that any goof on your part or even a dead component supplied to you is YOUR PROBLEM to find and deal with. </s>
<s> Some can't imagine why they have to buy a new motherboard if their homebuilt unit motherboard fails. </s>
<s> But this is the risk you are accepting. </s>
<s> In closing, be sure that MONEY is not why you are doing this. </s>
<s> New, complete over 2GHz P4 boxes are ready to use at 399 dollars. </s>
<s> You may not be able to beat that price. </s>

<s> I Googled for 'build a computer' and found these: http://www.pcmech.com/byopc/ http://www.mysuperpc.com/ http://www.webfreebees.net/howtobuildpc.html There are many more help pages available at google.com. </s>
<s> If you proceed, check and recheck your work. </s>
<s> Get a large power supply (450 watt or more). </s>

<s> well it IS more cost effective to buy a box new but there's a lot to be said for the fun and satisfaction of building it yourself. </s>
<s> plus you get to post to this forum a lot more!! </s>
<s> One thing you might want to start with is buying a bunch of $5 parts on ebay and building a 450 mhz machine just to practice building, and to use your old parts. </s>

<s> 90% of your computer jobs can be done very well with a PII machine, and it's good to have a spare for e mail if you screw up your main box. </s>
<s> when building a state of the art new machine, my advice: don't skimp on the case. </s>
<s> this was my most expensive lesson. </s>
<s> cooling the overall system is, for the most part, not mentioned by makers of individual components, and a big fan on the CPU may not be enough. </s>
<s> the size of the case is a factor. </s>
<s> just pay attention to that-- and, of course, don't zap the components with static electricity. </s>
