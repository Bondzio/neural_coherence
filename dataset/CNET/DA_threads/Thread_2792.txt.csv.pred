1.1.1	Hello , I recently purchased a Toshiba Satellite A215-S5818 Laptop ( specs can be found at http : //www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/rdet.jsp ? poid=405001 & seg=HHO ) and it comes with Atheros Wireless LAN 802.11a/g/n .	St
1.1.2	I want to get a wireless router for my home , but which router should I get , 802.11a , 802.11g , or 802.11n ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks a lot !	St
1.2.1	Any fine 802.11g router is good for & quot ; the internet & quot ; since your internet connection is much less than 54 megabit .	St
1.2.2	802.11n is good if you have more than one machine and want to copy over the air .	St

1.3.1	So if I 'm only going to use the router for this one laptop and possibly xbox 360 for xbox live , then a & quot ; G & quot ; router is the one to choose ?	Ques
1.4.1	Even if both machines hit the net , your & quot ; air speed & quot ; is still many times of your internet connection speed .	St
