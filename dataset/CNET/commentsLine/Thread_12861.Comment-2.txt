take a look at the second drive and see if the jumper on the back is set properly.
if your motherboard does not support cable select you will need to set the hd with the os (the 20) to master.
the second drive (the 40) will need to be set as slave.
there should be a diagram on the top of the drive to show you how to set the jumpers, and if not, go to the manufacturers site and see if you can find that information.
and if you are using a 40 wire cable the master needs to go on the middle connector.
if you have an 80 wire cable the master/boot drive should go on the end of the cable.
