Specifically, the computer's hard drives stop spinning, etc. and only the fans are running, which it typically does for about 10-seconds. Once the fans stop running the computer makes a popping sound which is heard through the speakers, while the power light on the computer's front panel briefly glows at the same time. The popping sound continues with a brief delay between each. The popping sound also diminishes in volume as does the brightness of the power light. The continually diminishing popping sounds (and light) continues for about 10-seconds. I have noticed absolutely no other odd behaviour by my computer, including any other strange noises. Regarding the computer itself: home-built with XP Pro (all current updates), 1GB Corsar RAM, 2 Western Digital hard drives, ATI All-in-Wonder video card, Antec case and 450-Watt power supply, Asus motherboard and Pentium 4 2.4GHz chip over-clocked 5% through a BIOS setting. I suspect the issue is the power supply as the sound only occurs after everything else has shut down. Any thoughts will be appreciated.

I've seen and heard this on dozens of machines. Sadly it's not a defect but a sign of poor design of the audio system on that board (mother or whichever.) I have fixed it in the past by disabling the onboard sound and using (my choice of) Creative Labs sound cards. Bob

I was going to try swapping for another power supply, but I think I will try buying a sound card and installing it. Hopefully you are very much right and this will solve matters. Thanks for the advice!

Since I didn't see a post from forkboy whether the sound card solution worked, I'm reposting the issue. Like forkboy, the popping noise begins after everything else has shut down and gradually diminishes and stops after a half minute or so. Now however, the noise can begin a random even several hours after shut down and it is continual. I have to shut down power to the computer for it to stop. When I opened the case, I noticed the 4 fans inside (2 case fans, power supply, and cpu)would jerk slightly along with the popping noise. Then my plan was to systematically disconnect peripherals to see if any were the cause of the issue. The first cord disconnected was the keyboard, and the popping stopped. I plug it back in, and it started again. Is it possible the keyboard is causing the problem? Granted it's an ancient PS/2 keyboard, so upgrading wouldn't be a bad thing.

As well, is this coming through your speakers and is their power applied to them with the PC off? It sounds like the PS is responding to some transient and wanting to start. This could have internal or external causes. I'd make sure the speaker system is turned off and see if you can tell if the fans still jerk. Work with the AC outlet configuration if you can as well. I also have to wonder about stored voltages in the PC's capacitors that aren't bleeding off properly. Sounds like a good one.

The speakers are not self-powered, but connected to the case via RCA jack. If I disconnect the speakers, the fans still jerk, I just don't hear the popping.
12481	9	272770	5199774	5199143	tanager8611	9/8/11 9:35 AM	1.3154745E12	Keyboard	I hooked up a USB keyboard and the noise and fan jerk were still there, though it seemed to lessen in duration. Oddly, like the PS/2 keyboard, the noise stopped if I diconnected the keyboard. No other USB connection seems to affect the noise.
