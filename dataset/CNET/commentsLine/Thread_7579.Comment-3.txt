hello i have an hp7920 and the three wires are connected.
anyone know why mine is shutting off when my wife runs the vacume cleaner is it a bad power supply or a power problem in my house.
this started after a bad snow storm and i lost my netural wire from the pole to the house.
it has since been repaired however my cpu is shutting down for no reason i can think of as a matter of fact im using it right now any help?
