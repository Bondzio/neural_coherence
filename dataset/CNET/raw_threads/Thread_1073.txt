I would kind of like to stay away from HP because of all the crapware that comes bundled with their printer drivers. I'm a little afraid to get a printer at all because of some of the reviews I've seen. I would like to be able to print good-quality photos and good-quality text, which it seems are rarely found together in a printer these days. A balance of quality and price is really what I'm looking for. If anyone can aid me in my search, that would be great. Thanks for any help, drummerboy

It slows system performance by loading a whole bunch of unnecessary apps into system memory and going in and cleaning that up is not something I'm interested in doing. The install for one of the HP printers I have was about 700mb. What in the world do I need 550mb of printer drivers/utilities for?

The units work just fine here and I opted out of the paint and other applications. I do run into people that are aghast at &quot;code bloat&quot; but at the risk of igniting someone like that I have to write &quot;get used to it.&quot; Here's an article why this is happening in Windows. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Software_bloat If you are looking to escape from bloat, jump out of Windows.

Individual cartridges, small droplet size, fast print, plus duplexing.

Understand, that all such s/w can provide function for tasks you *may* want of the m/f printer as times goes on. You of course can(if applicable) de-install or reduce some functions. Those functions are to email any pictures, fax s/w, OCR s/w for scanning, and s/w for cropping & manupitation before printing, plus monitor s/w for ink levels and not to forget the drivers of the OS being used. There should also some management of any pictures and/or copied documents, etc.. Hope this helps in your quest. May i suggest you look into the new Kodak 5xxx series of printers which offer reduced costs of ink, plus offer more permanent inks than usually provided from other vendors. Check out ther support website. tada -----Willy

Try going to the HP support site and finding just the latest driver and download/install and don't run the disc; this will give you the minimum.
