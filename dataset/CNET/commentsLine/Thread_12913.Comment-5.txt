hey guys.
i guess what i was trying to get at was, is there anything that someone would find around the house that would help?
like some sort of gloves or a certain material or something?
i'm not sure which conduct static electricity and which don't that's why.
i figured as long as i washed my hands and then sat down without moving around too much and maybe wearing a specific type of glove would prevent the discharge that's why.
