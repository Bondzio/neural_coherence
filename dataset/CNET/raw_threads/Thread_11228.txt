I am new with routers & Cox Cable says it's the router. Has anyone any information on the set up that would have caused this to happen? It's very frustrating. Remember I am a rookie too.

Try moving the base stations further apart and change the channel that the router operates on.

Do you think a different router or phone mghz would help? I could buy a new phone. I have a Netgear router I could hook up that is a WG102 model. Thanks for all of your help. It's much appreciated.
