Okay, so I installed everything correctly, but I left something out: the power going from the power source to the video card.
(( I turned the computer on, and when &lt;&lt;giving it power&gt;&gt; I got a screeching sound which sounded like it was coming from around my power source or processor.)
This is where I figured you meant the vid card.
Do you have an old pc to try it in?
I remember from last posts, you have nowhere to have it checked by liscensed tech so, all you can do is my above mentioned, a different pc perhaps.
Does the motherboard have onboard monitor port?
I still feel you have bigger issues with the motherboard and in my opinion, it's not in good health.
