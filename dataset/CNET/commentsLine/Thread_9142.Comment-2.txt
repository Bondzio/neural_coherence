let's put it this way.
these are ready to use, not so ready or easy to upgrade boxes.
the negative reviews are often from folk that went too cheap and want to add a 3d card for gaming and then run into the usual slim case issues and limitations.
but we've had many over the years and they're fine for what they are.
