<s> I am buying a MacBook Pro with a ss hard drive (which is small), it has the nvidia 1gb graphics card. </s>
<s> I want to play many video games which require Windows, but most of these games take up quite a bit of space so I do not want to run bootcamp on the Mac ss. </s>
<s> Is it possible to take an external hard drive format the entire thing as a Windows 7 system and run this hard drive as an alternate with my computer for the use of video games? </s>
<s> Also, I have USB 3.0 so it seems this would be the best connection for speed and price, am I right in thinking this? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> You can't install Windows on a removable drive. </s>
<s> But you can install it on the ssd under bootcamp, and then (if the installer of the game allows it) install the games on the external. </s>

<s> I don't see any system or procedure to do what you asked. </s>
<s> So I was reading up on using bootcamp. </s>
<s> do many games require a C: drive install anymore or will external be fine. </s>
<s> Also, is USB 3.0 a fast enough connection for playing games? </s>
<s> Sorry for the remedial questions it has been a while since I have done stuff with computer games. </s>
<s> Only the gamer can answer that. </s>
<s> All the games I've seen run off some USB 2.0 do run fine. </s>
<s> There are delays in loading maps, or the game but they do run. </s>
<s> But then you have that gamer that won't accept any delay. </s>
