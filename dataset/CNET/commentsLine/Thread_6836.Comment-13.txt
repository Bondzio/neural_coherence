if you're using win xp, have you opened internet explorer, checked under the tools dropdown, open internet options, select the &quot;connections&quot; tab, look for the dot where it says &quot;always dial my connection&quot;?
if the selection doesn't have a dot, you will probably have to setup your dial up connection again.
these settings may have been changed by a virus, or by mistake on a user's part.
since you're already in the right area, click the setup button and follow the directions to enter your isp info, if you know it.
if not, you will have to call your isp for further assistance.
they should be happy to step you through it, and it shouldn't take more than 10 or 15 minutes.
hope this helps.
