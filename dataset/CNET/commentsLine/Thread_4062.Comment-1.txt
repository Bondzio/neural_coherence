my new graphic card should fit in the agp 4x slot even though its agp8x i heard its compatible but the metal bracket that surrounds the dvi/ s video plug is too small i think my new one has a low profile bracket and my current one has a full height bracket but i cant switch the brackets because my current graphic card uses one vga connecter while the new one uses a dvi and s video connector i have a converter for that but the bracket is still an issue.
i was thinking maybe i should remove the low profile bracket of of the new graphic card and use aluminum foil so the graphic card wont be hanging out and leave a hole for dust to enter into will that work?
or is there anything else other than buying a new graphic card that i can do.
