1.1.1	I'm getting ready to build a system for myself.	St
1.1.2	Here's the specs: Asus AM2 Mobo nforce 570SLI chipset eVGA GeForce 7900GT (non-OC'd) Kingwin 600W PSU AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+ (might overclock eventually) WD Caviar 250GB Hard drive Here's my debate: I'm going to buy DDR2 667 or better RAM.	Ques
1.1.3	Right now, I'm looking at Corsair RAM, 2GB, Latency 4, 4-4-4-12 timings.	St
1.1.4	However, for a little bit more, I could get mushkin Extreme, 2GB, Latency 3, 3-3-3-10 RAM.	St
1.1.5	I know quite a bit about computers, but RAM would have to be my most lacking area.	St
1.1.6	I know the mushkin ram has better timings and latency, but I've also heard a few bad things about mushkin, albeit not much.	St
1.1.7	I need opinions: who's better?	St
1.1.8	Muskin or Corsair?	St
1.1.9	I know a few of my fellow tech heads will help me out on this one.	St
1.1.10	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	These are both DDR2 667 RAM sets.	St
1.3.1	http://www.tomshardware.com/2003/04/01/ram_wars/ covers a lot of ground and benchmarks so you can test which one wins.	St
1.3.2	However I've found such testing to turn up less than 1% speed payback so I've ceased overtesting this area in favor of price per GB and stability.	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	here's a review of the mushkin extreme: http://www.anandtech.com/memory/showdoc.aspx?i=2729	St
1.5.1	Personally I'd go with Corsair.	St
1.5.2	I've never had any problems with any Corsair RAM.	St
1.6.1	I didn't even think about looking for RAM reviews online.	St
1.6.2	Appreciate the help.	St
