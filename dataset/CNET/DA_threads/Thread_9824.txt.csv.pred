1.1.1	Hey all , First off , sorry for the rookie question -- thanks in advance for your help .	Polite
1.1.2	I 'm trying to setup a wireless network of two computers .	St
1.1.3	I 'm using a D-Link DI-524 wireless router .	St
1.1.4	My cable modem plugs into the WAN slot , and then my desktop plugs into the first LAN slot .	St
1.1.5	The web connection works fine for both my desktop and my wireless laptop .	St
1.1.6	However , I ca n't seem to get file sharing to work .	St
1.1.7	I 've run the network setup wizard on both computers and set them to the same workgroup , and I 've okayed file sharing on folders within each system .	St
1.1.8	When I try to view the workgroup from my desktop I can see my laptop , but when I try to access it I get an error : & quot ; & lt ; computername & gt ; not accessible .	St
1.1.9	You might not have permissions ... blah blah ... network path not found. & quot ; From the laptop , I ca n't even see the desktop within the workgroup .	St
1.1.10	I 'm running XP SP2 on both systems , windows firewall turned off , Zone Alarm on both .	St
1.1.11	I 'm guessing ZA is part of the problem , but I ca n't find a way to exempt the network workgroup -- only static IP addresses , which I assume I ca n't really force ( or at least I do n't know how to ) .	St
1.1.12	Any help ?	Ques
1.1.13	I 've read all of the file sharing FAQs I can find , but none of them discuss ZA , and the ZA help is n't much , well , help .	St
1.1.14	Thanks !	St

1.2.1	If your router automatically assigns IP addresses ( DHCP ) , then you need to tell ZA the range of IP addresses to trust .	St
1.2.2	Say your router is 192.168.0.1 and the computers are permitted to be assigned any number from 192.168.0.2 to 192.168.0.255 .	St
1.2.3	Open ZA click on ''Firewall '' click on the ''Zones '' tab right click in the blank area select ''Add '' select ''IP range '' In the window that opens , set your starting and ending IP addresses to creat the trusted range ( 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255 ) .	St
1.2.4	Or whatever range works for your setup .	St
1.2.5	This works for my local network , regardless of Workgroup name .	St
