thanks for notifying me about the warranty.
it still has the warranty, as i just purchased it 2 months ago.
but how should i approach the problem then?
i don't want to void the warranty, but i would really like to get a new cover.
how should i remove the screen from the lower half first?
it seems like the screen is connected to the ''thing'' that makes it possible to move the whole screen.
i can't really find any rubber cushions or any other kind of connecting points around the screen.
the spill was situated around the ''f1-f4, 1-4, q-r''-area.
i would like to remove the whole upper left corner of the keyboard.
