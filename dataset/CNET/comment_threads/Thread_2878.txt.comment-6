Take a look at HDMI capable PCie(video) slot cards, there are a bunch out there....there will be a PCie slot on the vast majority of Motherboards and that would/will be your HDMI hook up...some Motherboards already have HDMI capability onboard, if not you would use a slot card to acheive the capability.
Your basic drive hook ups are going to be SATA, HDD, DVDRW....etc., that has become fairly standard.
