<s> I have a Compaq Presario S4010OM desktop pc with windows xp home edition. </s>
<s> It has 2.40ghz, 630mb of ram, right now it has an integrated 64mb graphics card. </s>
<s> I have an open pci slot and was wondering what size graphics card I should get 128 or 256? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> pci graphics cards don't perform that well to start with and there won't be much difference between 128mb and 256mb. </s>
<s> here's my recommendation: geforce 6200, 256mb, $55 (before $15 rebate), http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130289 </s>
<s> i have a 250 watt power supply should that be enough </s>
<s> Anything else and I'd write no. </s>
