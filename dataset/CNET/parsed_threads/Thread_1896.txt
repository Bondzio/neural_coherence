<s> I recently bought a new pc (all the computer parts) I needed, so far i have everything connected but the problem is when i turn the power on nothing happens, the monitor acts as if it is not connected to a computer. </s>
<s> the fans and lights are on, but it is not doing anything with the HD, i have tried several different harddrives to see if it will work but attempts were futile, does anyone have a solution for this? </s>
<s> (it is not the video card or monitor) thanks in advanced </s>
<s> &quot;Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; Not a whisper of what make/model or any part and the wattage of the power supply. </s>
<s> I've seen many issues, but you supplied nothing for the forum to comment on. </s>
<s> Start very small. </s>
<s> A piece of cardboard, the CPU/HeatSinkFan(HSF), Power Supply Unit(PSU), Motherboard and a Speaker. </s>
<s> Plug just that on the cardboard and touch the power up jumper with a metal pen tip or jumper. </s>
<s> Beeps are a good sign. </s>
<s> No beeps and one of the four parts are misconfigured or dead. </s>

<s> would this happen if i installed something wrong? </s>
<s> (such as the processor) </s>
<s> The AMD would self-destruct if the heat sink is left off. </s>
<s> You omitted the results of the cardboard test and the wattage of the power supply. </s>
<s> For that list, the usual 450 Watt PSU is fitted. </s>

<s> power supply is 350W </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/cpu/20010917/index.html Great way to show the issue. </s>

<s> Much like driving your car at 120 MPH, it won't last long. </s>
<s> NEVER STRESS the power supply. </s>
<s> But it's sufficient to get the machine up and tested, but you won't find me trusting it. </s>
<s> I'd expect it to overheat, randomly crash, stress the motherboard capacitors and eventually need replacement of PSU and motherboard. </s>
