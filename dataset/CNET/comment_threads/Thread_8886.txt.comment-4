You will end up spending good money on many components that allow you to make a good OC.
Instead of spending all that money on good RAM, super PSU, etc., I would just get a goot CPU and video card at the start.
In fact, it is often the case that a good video card can make an average CPU a great gaming machine better than a screamer CPU with an average video card.
I'd start with one of these for gamers: - AMD Athlon 64 3500+ (or as low as the 3000+) - AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ - AMD Athlon 64 FX (whatever model fits your budget) Highest CPU clock speeds depend on many commputer components other than the original CPU.
There are even variations among the same CPU model number.
Some luck involved in which one you actually get.
If you feel up to the challenge after reading this recent article, then go for OC.
Personally, I don't recommend first-time builders to OC until they build a machine and handle &quot;normal&quot; speed problems.
