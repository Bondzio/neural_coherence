1.1.1	I have a Compaq Presario SR1620NX with an AMD Sempron processor running Windows Vista ( did not come with PC ) .	St
1.1.2	I am currently running the manufacturers video card which is an ATI Radeon Xpress 200 and I just recently bought Halo 2 for PC and it does not meet the required graphics standards to run it so I am looking to upgrade but I can not find a decent graphics card that can run on a 250w power supply , that is compatible with windows vista , and that is 512mb .	St
1.1.3	if you have any suggestions or comments on what i should do or buy they are greatly appreciated .	Ques
1.1.4	Thank you in advance .	St
1.2.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/desktops/hp-compaq-presario-sr1620nx/1707-3118_7-31589079.html shows what we are working with so this means we have a PCIe slot .	St
1.2.2	I 'm going to give the nod to a GT 240 1GB card such as http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814500138 that 's a passively cooled card .	St
1.2.3	Since I ca n't guess if that wide a card fits or if there is a good breeze in the system let 's find one with a fan .	St
1.2.4	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814500137 Ok , here we have a very nice 1GB card for 54 bucks after rebate .	St
1.2.5	On my HP d4999t the fanless version of this card and the entire machine pulls 120 Watts on the P3 Watt meter so I did n't have to change the PSU .	St
1.2.6	That 's what I 'd get .	St
