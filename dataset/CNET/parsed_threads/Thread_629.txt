<s> I plan on buying my MBP soon, but I only have one printer with two computers. </s>
<s> What excatly do I need to get Airport going. </s>
<s> Do I need the base station or just the Airport Express Base. </s>
<s> I have wireless internet (DSL I think) and would like to not have to plug and unplug my printer when I need to print things. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Need clarification.. One printer: What kind? </s>
<s> Need manufacturer and model. </s>
<s> Is it shared by several computers today? </s>
<s> How? </s>
<s> Airport is 802.11 just wifi. </s>
<s> So to &quot;get Airport going&quot; you would merely turn that option on in the Mac and find the base station - as you would with any other computer to use the wireless connection. </s>
<s> (I hope you have already secured that wireless connection - if not, do that before adding any more computers and get whatever trojans, viruses and any other spyware/malware off any computers on that network before adding any computers - Macintosh or otherwise.) </s>
<s> If your printer is a print-only USB (and not ethernet) device, there are USB-to-wifi and USB to ethernet adapters available. </s>
<s> If your printer is a multifunction, USB-based, printer/scanner/copier/fax, you will have problems sharing that over any network. </s>
<s> Worst case: If your printer is a print-only USB (and not ethernet) device, there are manual USB switches available... </s>
<s> The printer stays connected all the time, so do all the computers... but you need to push the button for the corresponding computer to connect to the printer... </s>
<s> I use one of those today to connect a Canon MP780 and share between two Macs and a HP laptop... </s>
<s> is not knowing how you are connected to the Internet. </s>
<s> DSL comes in to the house on a phone line and Cable comes in on the Cable TV line. </s>
<s> This then goes to a Modem, which could be wireless, and from there to your computer(s). </s>
<s> Do your two computers connect to the internet at the same time? </s>
<s> Airport Express is designed for the smaller home network and is not designed to extend your existing, Non-Apple, wireless network. </s>
<s> Does your existing modem have a wireless capability or do you have a wireless router connected to the modem? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I know I have amyn questions. </s>
<s> I'm new to this Mac thing, so I'm trying to learn as much about it as possible. </s>
<s> It's an HP Deskjet F380 all in one. </s>
<s> Printer-scanner-copier. </s>
<s> It's hooked up to my PC. </s>
<s> My parents have a HP Office Jet 6210 all in one. </s>
<s> printer-faxer-copier-scanner. </s>
<s> And yes I do have a few problems. </s>
<s> I'm trying to learn all I can about Macs, as I like to learn new things. </s>
<s> I understand alot of it from reading things on the internet already. </s>
<s> I just ask about what I don't really understand. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> is for. </s>
<s> Now we know what printer it is - as previously indicated, if it is a USB all-in-one, sharing it in the traditional networked (ethernet) sense could be a problem. </s>
<s> I suggest you go the manual USB switch route if this is the printer which needs to be shared. </s>
