1.1.1	I 'm hooking up a network for someone , while I know a fair amoout about computers to work things out , I am still new to networking .	St
1.1.2	THe thing is , this person has his HOME PC running on a USB WIRELESS ( 2wire/sbc ) because the closet wall jack is upstairs .	St
1.1.3	Also , he wants his laptop to have internet access at home , so he can take it to work and home .	St
1.1.4	If I am correct , he needs a router right ?	Ques
1.1.5	He has the DSL modem , and when I installed the PC/wifi card in his laptop it connected , but it says there is limited or no connect .	St
1.1.6	Generally speaking , its as if two computers are trying to get connect to one DSL modem , therefore I need a router ?	Ques
1.1.7	THanks for the help and clarification	St
1.2.1	You say it is connected , but to what ?	Ques
1.2.2	Could you be picking up the neighbors WAP ?	Ques
1.3.1	It says it is connected to my DSL MODEM .	St
1.3.2	it is number 223 or something , and the one on the HOME PC is connected to 223 , so I did the same for the laptop and it detects it and all that jazz , but there is no acivity .	St
1.3.3	Something about being assigned a network somethin ?	Ques
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	into the workings of this modem/router ?	Ques
1.5.2	Name the product and/or look through the manual .	St
1.6.1	Do n't know what your setup is , but I had the same problem at home using a cable modem .	St
1.6.2	It was because the cable modem can only give 1 IP address at a time , so only one PC can be connected at a time .	St
1.6.3	The first one turned on will get a connection and the other wo n't .	St
1.6.4	Short term , power off both machines , reset the modem , then power up the machine you want to connect .	St
1.6.5	Do this each time your want a different machine to connect .	St
1.6.6	Ideally though you do need a router .	St
1.6.7	The router will take the 1 IP address from the modem , then give separate IP addresses to the PC 's .	St
1.6.8	If you follow the manual with the router it 's relatively straight forward	St
1.7.1	He has a 2wire home wireless DSL modem , not sure on the specific model , its the one with 4 ethernet ports in the back .	St
1.7.2	It makes sense about only being able to give one PC an IP address at a time .	St
1.7.3	Really , I dont know if he needs both PCs on at the same time , it would probably be convenient , but I can try just connecting one at a time if thats the case .	Sug
1.7.4	What kind of router would I need to set up two wireless PCs to work at the same time with one DSL modem ?	Ques
1.7.5	THanks again	St
