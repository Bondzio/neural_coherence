The version of motherboard driver package you used.
Also try setting the &quot;Init display&quot; to PCIe or others.
Sorry if that isn't the right words for your BIOS but there is no standard so I just look to see if it's an option.
Also, some of these boards need a power supply connection.
I note this in case yours did and you forgot.
