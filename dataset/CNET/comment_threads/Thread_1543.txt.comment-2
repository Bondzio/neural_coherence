when the linksys is hooked up to the modem and pc, there is no internet connection.
The internet &quot;light&quot; is not coming on and when I try my browser it is not connected.
Can anyone tell me what I might try to fix this?
The lights are on on the router so it appears to be functioning properly.
I think these instructions, http://www.tech-faq.com/how-to-setup-a-linksys-router.html are correct but I can't get to the &quot;configure&quot; part where you go to the IP address online.
Can I configure that before I hook up the router maybe?
Thanks again for any help, Denise
