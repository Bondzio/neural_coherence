i really like the way my computer is setup, but would like to get more speed from it.
i am running windows vista home premiem.
i have started a little shot and burn wedding photograghy business and my amd 64x2 4200 cpu and 2 gig of ram is a little on the slow side when doing 500 or 600 pictures in photoshop.
i would like to speed things up if possible.
if i were to replace the motherboard,cpu and go to duel channel ddr2 memory would i have to format the hard drive and re-install windows vista, the drivers and everything that goes with it?.
i also plan on upgrading the power supply from the 300watt that is in there now to a antec 550watt.
i have a 7600gs video card so i think that should be ok for what i will be doing.
price wise it comes out cheaper than buying a whole new system.
any advise would be apperciated.
thanks wayne
