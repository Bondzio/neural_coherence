hi, i have a 500gb seagate external hard drive with 4 partitions managed by seagate manager.the problem is it works ok sometimes,but all of a sudden it says 'delayed write error'.if i disconnect the drive and reconnect it after a system restart it works ok again for a while,but again after a while the same error comes up.
is there any permanent fix for this problem?or is there something wrong with the drive?
please help me.
thanks in advance.
