This program has its own image file called a .kes file. I am trying to print a .kes file from a HP Deskjet 990 Cxi printer but it won't print accurately. What I get is a sheet of 9 dark alternating columns of 2 different widths. I am using a Windows XP O.S. I tried to print a .tiff file and got the same result. The funny thing is that I can print text files and clip art from Word. Any idea what's happening? Thanks, Ruth

In other words: is only the Kurzweil program in error or are other programs also affected? Did you install the latest driver for your printer? What happens if you install a .pdf-printer (like cutepdf) and use it to make a .pdf-file? How does that look on the screen? How does it print? Just experiments to narrow down the possible cause of this problem. Kees
