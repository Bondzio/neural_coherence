<s> I have setup my netgear wifi router and I can access it with my computer. </s>
<s> But what do I need to do to get it working with my second computer. </s>
<s> On my second computer I have already installed the wifi adapter and it is working as it sends packets but dosent recieve any. </s>
<s> Do I need to install any isp software. </s>
<s> I checked my tcp/ip setings and are ok. </s>
<s> I dont know if I have to do anything else.. </s>
<s> Model number of router and wirleess adapter? </s>
<s> Operating system? </s>
<s> ISP and type of service (cable, DSL, other)? </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> Im using a cable srvice provider. </s>
<s> I set the other computer ip settings the same as my original computer. </s>
<s> But this did not solve the problem because I had 2 network connections open, as soon as I disabled 1 connection I connected straight away. </s>
<s> If I setup the internet on another computer and I double click on iexplorer how can I stop it to go into setup mode ie configure LAN, configure Dial up etc. </s>
