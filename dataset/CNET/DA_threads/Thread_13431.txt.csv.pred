1.1.1	Did you get it just by reading ?	Ques
1.1.2	No formal training ?	Ques
1.2.1	If you want to learn about networking then I recommend these books .	St
1.2.2	TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 1 , Richard Stevens Interconnections : Bridges , Routers , Switches , and Internetworking Protocols , Radia Perlman These 2 books used to be reference materiels for the router support teams at BayNetworks/Wellfleet and 3Com .	St
1.2.3	They discuss standards based routing .	St
1.2.4	Cisco Certification teaches you to build networks the Cisco way .	St
1.2.5	This usually means proprietary protocols instead of standards because they want to lock their customers in and keep them from looking at competing products .	St
1.2.6	Key concepts to learn in the beginning .	St
1.2.7	DHCP ARP DNS How switches build a database .	St
1.2.8	How switches forward packets .	St
1.2.9	VLANs RIP and RIP version 2 How packets are passed through a router .	St
1.2.10	How routers modify packets as they pass through .	St
1.2.11	For WAN technologies ... PPP PPPoE ( Used with DSL ) Frame Relay DLINK has some great products for cheap prices .	St
1.2.12	The DES-3326SRM is an ethernet switch that can also route .	St
1.2.13	You can buy one for about $ 400 .	St
1.2.14	Much cheaper than a UC Berkeley extension course .	St
1.2.15	And you can sell the switch on EBay when you are done with it .	St
1.2.16	Or buy a Cisco 800 and make the two work together and get some hands on with Cisco IOS .	Sug
1.2.17	Cisco gear is traditionally very expensive .	St
1.2.18	SKrall	St
1.3.1	I got my CCNA and CCNP as part of my course work for my I.T .	St
1.3.2	degree .	St
1.3.3	My first question is why you want the CCNA ?	Ques
1.3.4	Is your employer wanting you to get it ?	Ques
1.3.5	There are other certifications out there , which will cover networking technologies , and are not CISCO specific as the other post pointed out .	St
1.3.6	I think it would be POSSIBLE to get certified from reading books alone , if you already have a strong background .	St
1.3.7	But there is no substitute for hands on experience using the equipment .	St
1.3.8	If you are planning to use your CCNA out in the field I think you would be better off getting some formal training .	St
1.3.9	All the book reading in the world will not prepare you when things happen that are not covered in the book so to speak .	St
1.3.10	If you are just looking to increase your networking knowledge , and not work with CISCO equipment specifically , I would probably follow the advice of the other post .	St
1.3.11	Good luck with whatever decision you make .	Polite
