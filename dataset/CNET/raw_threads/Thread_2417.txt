Since, you mentioned gaming, it maybe better to really upgrade rather than drag older stuff along. The choice is yours. The newer system pretty much requires more than new video card, etc. and that's the extra cost, but you should be better suited for newer games and/or other demands placed on the system. tada -----Willy

But my shopping list might be a Core 2 Dual (or quad), 2.0GB RAM, etc. and a card off this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2008/03/05/the_best_gaming_graphics/ This would get me a best to good gaming rig. Best could be too expensive? Bob
13623	6	290151	2744009	2743709	ramarc	4/3/08 8:51 AM	1.20721266E12	my earlier post has links to suggested hardware	just click the text in the parenthesis. btw, the palit 9600gt has a $40 rebate making it only $110. that's a fantastic price considering it's in the top 10% for single GPU gaming performance.

Big mistake. Ati/AMD DOES NOT offer driver support for these AGP cards. It took me about a week to get the card to work (I still have no sound b/c of some driver incompatibility). If I were you I would save your money (and a giant migrane) and wait until next gen CPUs come out. If you really must upgrade, do yourself a favor and get a 7XXX nVidia card. STAY AWAY from 3850 AGP.

You will also have to install ATI Tool app. to force windows to use the proper settings for the card. After this is done, your card will work just fine. The reason for all of these &quot;installation hoops&quot; is because ATi STOPPED MANUFACTURING AGP CARDS after the X1600 Pro. All &quot;ATi&quot; AGP cards are now manufactured by 3rd Party companies who simply build the AGP card with the chipset borrowed from the original PCI-E card... thus, &quot;converting&quot; a PCI-E card for use in an AGP environment. You can also try www.omegadrivers.net for compatible drivers for this card. Good Luck!
