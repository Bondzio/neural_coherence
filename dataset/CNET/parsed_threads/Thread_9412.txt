<s> Hey all, I have to send my HP laptop in to HP for repair because of a hardware fault anyway they told me to back up my data before I send it in because I won't be able to keep it when I send it in. </s>
<s> The laptop is an HP Pavilion dv2315nr, and I'm using a Thermaltake Black Widow to extract the data, but I can't get the HDD to fit. </s>
<s> I tried getting it to work with a discount enclosure from frys before, but I had the same problem and ended up snapping one of the brackets that holds the HDD into place. </s>
<s> So now I can't get it to fit in this much nicer one and I'm clueless. </s>
<s> Please I need your help badly, this HDD has important data to me! </s>

<s> I've been researching the internet for a bit, and now I can't even tell what the interface is. </s>
<s> The HDD says Serial ATA, but it doesn't look like SATA I've got some pictures: http://www.flickr.com/photos/33154207@N07/ </s>
