i have formatted and re-used many hdds both my own and drives obtained from others, a complette format and installation of an operating system has prooved successfull as long as the drive is working ok. however, even after formatting the files are still recoverable.
these files should not cause any problems.
if you want to see these files, install a recovery program.
search cnet for pandora recovery software,this is a free program and will find 1000s of files on a formatted drive.
the only way to clean a drive is to &quot;destroy&quot; it.
