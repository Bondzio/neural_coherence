I like this one. Which is why I decided to buy a video card for it (uh-oh, investing in a computer when so many have been sucking!?) so I could play the Sims and WoW. I must feed my addiction. Anyway. The ISSUE. I purchased a Sparkle GeForce 8400 GS Video Card - 512MB DDR2, PCI, DVI, VGA, S-Video from Tigerdircet.com. I really don't know much about computers and the guys on Yahoo! Answers said this video card will be fine and a whole bunch of garbage about how PCI express is better (I know that, I did my research, but this beast of a computer is a PCI dealio!), so I went with the card. I got it and ran to install it, the generic &quot;quick install guide&quot; confusing me a bit, but it's not too hard to figure out. I got excited and turned on the computer. BAM. No video on the monitor. Like, wtf? So I try it in all the ports (I have 3) and cleaned everything up (carefully), but I keep having to revert to the motherboard video card. So I start looking up help from Sparkle (why shouldn't the manufacturer be able to help me?). I registered my product and all that jazz, went to tech support, and the site had the nerve to ask me questions such as: What's your motherboard model NO? Memory Type and Capacity? Power Supply Wattage? Brand of Power Supply? Blah blah blah? So I decided to get on the forums of CNET before I call and talk to some Indian guy for an hour to get nowhere. Let me tell you what's a bit sketchy. The box has a bunch of stickers on it. The one with my model and serial numbers is right (M/N: SF-PC84GS512U2LP), but there's one that has a picture of a PCI express card. Uhh, not what I ordered. Plus, when I went online to download a thorough manual, it was only for AGP or PCI Express. When I clicked the manual for my specific card! The box doesn't even look how it should. I don't think I have a PCI express card because it doesn't have any hangy-downer-things (excuse my unsophistication, that's just how much I need help). So yeah. Anybody have any ideas as to why I can't get video? And where can I find the info Sparkle was asking for me? (Please bear in mind I do NOT have any manuals. Which is why I came here.) Thank yuh!
