1.1.1	I already own the 4 matching monitors , all are acer x243w - 24inch widescreens , I currently have 2 hooked up thru my computer off the video card , but would love to have all four *if not for maybe 3 ? )	Ques
1.1.2	hooked up for a reallly extended desktop .	St
1.1.3	What I am looking for is advice on what will work to make this happen or if this is even possible given my current equipment and setup .	St
1.1.4	I own an HP M7760n Multimedia computer 2.13 GHz Core 2 , 2 Gig Ram , Vista Home Premium , the only upgraded item is the video card , I put in an msi 8600 Geforce GT card in it so I could run dual dvi monitors .	St
1.1.5	I checked out the HP page and it says I have one pci express 16 , and 3 pci slots , I am using that geforce gt card in the pci express 16 slot , so available i have 2 pci 's and the onboard video .	St
1.1.6	Is it possible at all to use the onboard video to add at least a 3rd monitor ?	Ques
1.1.7	I hooked one up and rebooted but it did n't seem to recognize there was a 3rd monitor ... Is there anything in the bios I need to adjust to allow onboard video to work with a pci express card or is this just not going to work ?	Ques
1.1.8	I saw an option of a pci card by ati that supported upto 4 monitors , would that work in my pci slot ?	Ques
1.1.9	( there is also a pci express 1 version ) but I dont have a pci express 1 slot .	St
1.1.10	Just trying to learn what I could do ( if anything ) to add a 3rd or 4th monitor to this system and make it all & quot ; work & quot ; .	St
1.1.11	Thanks for any help on this .	Polite

1.2.1	The easiest thing would be to change the motherboard , it would allow you to add an additional PCI-E card and would help to future proof your PC a little .	St
1.2.2	2 video cards in SLI ( in your case 8600GTx2 ) would allow you to have 4 displays .	St
1.2.3	Keep in mind you would need a SLI ready Powersupply with the correct voltage and amps along with a SLI ready motherboard .	St
1.3.1	$ 50 geforce 6200 pci : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814130289 btw , the onboard video is disabled when you add pci-express card .	St
1.4.1	If you plan to stay with your current system , then anything installable must be supported .	St
1.4.2	Your options are limited because you already have pushed the normal video limits .	St
1.4.3	No matter what direction you take , its going to cost .	St
1.4.4	Either replace the system to better handle this due to more slots or get a ext .	St
1.4.5	video box that splits amongest the LCDs .	St
1.4.6	Matrox makes such and I 'm sure others at least duo display maybe more .	St
1.4.7	You need to google for vendors and/or solutions currently out there .	St
1.4.8	If you find a video card with more than 2 ports , then its a very special card , and probably is the most installable for your HP .	St
1.4.9	Under HP bios once you install another video port/card , on-board becomes disabled but again that depends on the video maker , in what they may offer via the s/w side .	St
1.4.10	Verify what the bios will do or check the manual/support website .	St
1.4.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	I was wondering if it could be that simple , just adding in a cheap pci card , but was n't sure if it would work alongside the pci express 16 geforce 8600 GT card I currently have in there or if Vista would freak out over it or something .	St
1.5.2	Worth a try tho i guess ... Bill	St
1.6.1	it will work just fine .	St
1.7.1	check out www.crowntradingsystems.com	Sug

1.8.2	Character - Doing the right thing when no one is looking .	St
1.9.1	Actually , the easiest thing to do , would be to get a & quot ; USB to VGA & quot ; or & quot ; USB to DVI adapter & quot ; .	St
1.9.2	Then you can just add an extra monitor through a USB port , and you do n't even have to open the computer .	St
1.9.3	You can even use multiple adapters to add extra monitors .	St
1.9.4	USB to VGA Adapter : http : //www.multi-monitors.com/product_p/usbvga1.htm USB to DVI Adapter : http : //www.multi-monitors.com/USB_to_DVI_Adapter_p/usbdvi1.htm	St
