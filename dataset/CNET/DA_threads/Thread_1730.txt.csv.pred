1.1.1	I need to replace my 6 yr old printer because Dell does not provide Win7 drivers for it .	St
1.1.2	I have been wanting to upgrade anyway , as the cost for cartridges for most of the printing I do was way too high .	St
1.1.3	This is for home use , max two users .	St
1.1.4	I print mostly text documents and PDFs , so have little need for color on a daily basis .	St
1.1.5	I would like the ability to print in color as well as copy and scan .	St
1.1.6	I am thinking of buying two printers : a relatively inexpensive monochrome laser for lower cost per page and fasterprint speed over inkjet & amp ; AIO inkjet for copy and scan functions as well as occasional color printing .	St
1.1.7	Here are the attributes I would like for each printer : Laser : The goal with this printer would be to keep the cost per page printed as low as possible .	St
1.1.8	This printer would be used for light daily printing of text files .	St
1.1.9	These are mostly scientific articles ( 5-30 pages ) that I highlight as I read and then either file away or recycle bin ( I am trying to transfer to an ereader but I still prefer paper ) .	St
1.1.10	Decent speed & lt ; span class= & quot ; Apple-tab-span & quot ; style= & quot ; white-space : pre & quot ; & gt ; -not overly concerned with quality Easy double sided printing Wireless printing if possible $ 100-150 range Inkjet AIO : Goal with this printer would be to cover the few color printing jobs I have ( no photos ) .	St
1.1.11	Good print and copy speed would be nice but I am ok with slow as long as quality is not horrible .	St
1.1.12	If I need excellent print quality I have easy access to a professional printer service.Preference would be given to models with good to excellent scan quality .	St
1.1.13	Wireless printing ( would give it up given cost ) $ 100-150 range Does this scenario make sense for me or anyone ?	Ques
1.1.14	Are there decent quality AIO inkjets out there with low enough cost per page B & amp ; W printing and good enough speed to forgo the laser printer ?	Ques
1.1.15	Target price range for this one would be as low as possible but as high as $ 200ish .	St
1.1.16	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	http : //forums.cnet.com/7731-7590_102-521847.html is a ( long ! )	St
1.2.2	recent discussion .	St
1.2.3	It might help you to decide .	St
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	I tried to search the forum for an answer to my question prior to posting but obviously I missed that one .	St
1.3.2	Thanks again .	St
1.4.1	If you have a clear understanding of your printing needs rather than desires , buy the printer ( s ) that best benefit you in the long run .	St
1.4.2	IMHO , many do n't need color for day-to-day printing especially in draft mode of simple text , that 's where laser shine , plus being quick at it .	St
1.4.3	Color is best for presentation or final output if needed .	St
1.4.4	If you decide too heavily on cost alone , that may hinder you if your needs expand or want more than what 's offered .	St
1.4.5	Your wish for an AIO maybe better served by a plain color printer since what a AIO is more than printing alone , so decide which you want .	St
1.4.6	I think w/o too much doubt having the mono-laser , even a cheap one would suffice for typical needs as your stated .	St
1.4.7	Though , you may want to review toner costs .	St
1.4.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	I started leaning toward not getting a color printer after I posted on Sun .	St
1.5.2	Now on to checking toner costs !	St
1.5.3	Thanks .	Polite
