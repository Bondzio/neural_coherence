Remember I've seen over a thousand displays over the years and know that a .28 dot pitch will look just as bad on DVI as VGA. And better displays look about the same. You may ask why? It's this simple. To move to higher scan rates and pixel counts and dual or more displays, the &quot;DAC&quot; needs to be changed and the connections improved. Also some convergence with HDTV is forecast. Bob
