Not looking at only speed issues - even though it is a factor.
Looking at over all value.
Take a intal and AMD of the same cofiguration and I have found that the Intel is the most expensive by 200 - 300 dollars.
Also checking out Cnets tests and a few other sites tests it is a decisive AMD love fest.
I will admit that I have not liked Atholons up until this point but this should change that additude.
