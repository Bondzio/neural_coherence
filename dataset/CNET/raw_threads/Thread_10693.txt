(this has happened intermittently since i first build my pc) so i pushed the power button and it eventually closed down. once i booted the machine started.. my graphics card hsf stayed on a high rpm and didnt slow down which it usually does after 5 seconds, no display on the screen. the power button on my monitor was flashing. i unplugged it from the mains and disconnected my mobo for 1 min then reset the cmos, reconnected the mains and switched the power switch on and off and eventually it booted, with great difficuilty. when it started to boot i got a screen saying overclocking failed, i pressed f2 to load defaults and it booted. (this isnt the first time and i dont alter BIOS setting except boot device when i reformat) no running problems at the moment apart from a few things. i have just done a fresh install of windows about a week ago and since ive had 'new hardware found.' one for my plug and play monitor and another for pci device. i have installed all the drivers for these obviously after the format but it still comes up. the problem is with my old motherboard this is exactly what happened before it stopped working. my system spec is as below. Windows XP 5.1 build2600 sp2 AMD Athlon 4000+ ASUS A8R32-MVP 32 Delux (Bios Version 2.3, as of 29/3/06) ***My current mobo. Hitachi Deskstar T7K250 250GB (HDT722525DLAT80) ATI Radeon x1900xtx Viewsonic VSC0F1C X-Fi Blaster card v5.5 is there any suggestion on what can be causing this problem? as it seems to be happening with two different types of motherboards. also if its any use i hear the mobo i got needs a bios update, which i havent done yet. im relatively new to pc's so go easy guys =)
