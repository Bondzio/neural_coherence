Sorry, i'm not the most &quot;geeky&quot; person when it comes to things like that.
The sub is a perfectly fine size.
So, I don't need a special or premium sound card (like one from Creative) to use a 3.1, 4.1, or 5.1 system?
Sorry, I don't know my system specs, as I said I'm quite stupid when it comes to things like this.
However, I'm pretty sure my Motherboard is an Intel because my chip is an Intel Pentium 4 processor.
I know that I don't have a special sound card, just the normal Intel Integrated.Thanks
