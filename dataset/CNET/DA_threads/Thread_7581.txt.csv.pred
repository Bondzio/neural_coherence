1.1.1	I 'm setting up my computer to use my living room screen and audio system for when I want to chill on the couch and watch web content , and I 'm trying to figure out whether or not I can have both a wireless keyboard and mouse ( for chilling ) and my regular , wired set ( for working ) hooked up at the same time .

1.1.2	I 'd prefer not to have to use the wireless stuff all the time .	St
1.1.3	Thanks .	Polite
