ok, so... my computer died a tragic death.
they tell me his capacitors blew, they expanded to an unnatural volume and started leaking a mysterious red powder.
i suspect this is what was causing the comp to endlessly reboot every 40 seconds when i would try and turn it on.
after an unsuccessful exorcism i brought the big boy to a more professional computer shop.
and they're the ones who told me the motherboard is dead and there's nothing i can do about it.
i had just recently bought a 1 gb ram module though, and it feels like it would be a shame to let it go to waste.
as a bonus buying a computer that uses one of those old rams (ddr1 i think he called it) will be much cheaper than buying one of those new i5 supercomputers.
so i want to transfer my rams safely.
ideally i would just swap them from on computer to the next while they are rig next to one another, but i don't... perfectly trust this computer store.
i want to open up the computer i buy and make sure the stick will fit while still in the store.
that way i can catch any problems with them right next to me.
but how do i that?
i only have 1 ram case, and i have 2 modules.
and it's been raining like crazy in these parts!
i'm not just going to step outside with the card lying naked in my hand will i?
so, any tips?
