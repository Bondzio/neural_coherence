Are owners that have wifi routers that connect to all machines but one.
It's hard for them to accept it when I reenable SSID broadcast, turn off wep/wpa and get it connected.
We then experiment to see what security does work.
We also test the laptop at hotspots if it doesn't connect.
If it doesn't at 2 hotspots and my laptop does then it's either a bum install of the OS or dead hardware.
Sometimes the owner didn't know to use the button on the laptop to turn the wifi on and off.
Hope this helps.
Bob
