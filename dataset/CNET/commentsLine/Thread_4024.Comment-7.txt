...a site recently which detailed 2d speeds, and while all the cards were stratospheric scorers, it didn't look to have moved on much from the good old days.
cards which wouldn't even score in the top 100 (matrox/3dfx /xgi/videologic were even listed i think) now for 3d speed, were easily a match for more modern hardware (if i found it interesting, i'd be able to find it again!
).
apparently 2d speeds have been pretty much topped out (i can't even find the link now, but remeber matrox 550 was a good &quot;old&quot; scorer) for many years with no drive for extra speeds, so any card will be adequate for what you require.
here's a link detailing the x1600pro (and crossfire) fully too.
the only caveat...the power required.
it's not exactly a low power device, so please make sure your psu can provide the current required.
