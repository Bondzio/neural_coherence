<s> I have this virus that creates &quot;new folder&quot; everytime I refresh or I got to specific drive. </s>
<s> Even though I delete it, it comes back again. </s>
<s> I tried to install AVG 7.5 but it seems to not help at all. </s>
<s> Any comments will do, thanks! </s>
<s> There are folders that Windows creates too. </s>
<s> Too bad the name of the folder was omitted. </s>

<s> this one is different. </s>
<s> My usb got infected as well but when we scanned it (dont remember what anti-virus), it detected a Worm on it. </s>
<s> I tried to scanned my pc with AVG 7.5 but it only detects spyware. </s>
<s> The new folder thing is still there. </s>
<s> That the name of the folder or the worm is not shared. </s>
<s> As it stands I can only suggest online scans. </s>
