i have ordered the upgrade version of windows 7, due in october.
i have also ordered a new sata 750 gb hard drive from seagate.
i presently use vista home premium.
my question is: can i load an upgrade version of windows on a new hard drive?
can i load my office xp and expression web2 upgrade versions on the empty hard drive?
i know that microsoft upgrade programs require conformation of ownership of a previous version.
my thought is that i could keep my old hard drive installed under another letter, and when asked for proof of previous version, i could direct the microsoft program to the old hard drive.
is that what i would do?
do i have to fool with the bios with this sata drive?
what else would you suggest for a &quot;clean&quot; install?
thanks... ken
