What I meant was, to boot up a working motherboard.
Then while the power was still on, add the tophat and use a program called winflash which flashes the rom while xp is running, to reflash the tophat.
Once that is completed I would then add the updated top hat to my broken bios mobo and try to boot.
But I dont have another mobo in the house with the tophat and XP...
So I was thinking of trying this with a component such as a LAN card or maybe a video card.
Unforunatly this doesnt work since firmware updates are much simpler on thoose and only require a program to be run.
On the other hand it should be able to be done.
I think a great project would be to try to figure out how to make one of these devices.
