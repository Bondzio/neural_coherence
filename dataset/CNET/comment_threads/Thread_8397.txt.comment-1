I have an Acer laptop I recently purchased.
I know it has built-in storage capabilities but whenever I attempt to download anything to store, a message appears saying that I must insert a CD.
Why won't the unit simply use it's built-in storage?
What kind of CD must I buy?
I bought the unit mostly for surfing the web but once in a while, I find an interesting article or image that I want to save.
I am not computer savvy so I am probably doing something wrong.
