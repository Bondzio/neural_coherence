3103	0	103838	1189043	NR	Walt H	5/14/05 4:47 PM	1.11608922E12	Extremely Slow Floppy Drive	My floppy drive is extremely slow. It takes &quot;forever&quot; reading a floppy disk. I've tried several different NEW floppies and it's definitely the drive itself. Any ideas?
3103	1	103838	1189083	1189043	Michael Geist	5/14/05 5:20 PM	1.1160912E12	Swap the drive, it's	a &lt; $10 item.
3103	2	103838	1189999	1189083	PlatinumPPC	5/15/05 9:39 AM	1.11614994E12	Agreed.	I wouldn't even think about trying to troubleshoot a floppy drive. Replace it.
3103	3	103838	1190028	1189043	R. Proffitt	5/15/05 9:56 AM	1.11615096E12	One time Norton...	Was scanning that diskette. Since diskettes are slow already a programming gaffe (never!) in Norton caused diskettes to run at less than 1/2 the speed. May happen to other AV software too.

Even if it was only 360KB and you multiple up the to by 4 to the 1.44MB today's machines are slower at formatting. This must be an unloved, neglected area. -&gt; But I did cure it. I picked up a 2X Sony USB floppy drive. Bob

I'm trying to load a program I got off the internet with my Windows XP desktop into my Windows 95 laptop using a floppy. Seems like it can't be done because it always says to reformat the floppy. Guess they're completely incompatible with each other? What I'm trying to do is recover old photos off of my laptop that I accidentally deleted. Then I'll throw it away.
3103	7	103838	2650721	2650656	R. Proffitt	12/10/07 8:14 AM	1.19727444E12	Microsoft documented that issue.	I'll skip to what I used to get around it. -&gt; I formatted the diskette in XP. Bob
3103	8	103838	2650724	2650721	scottpush	12/10/07 8:37 AM	1.19727582E12	Problems with floppies	Doesn't work. I formatted in XP, then loaded a file onto the floppy. Then tried it in my Win 95 laptop and it wanted to format the disc again. When I clicked NO then no file was shown on that drive.
3103	9	103838	2650765	2650724	R. Proffitt	12/10/07 10:00 AM	1.1972808E12	There was a boot virus that did that.	The reason for the incompatibility was traced down to a virus on the 95 boxes. But many forget this stuff. -&gt; The other workaround. Go to bootdisk.com and get the DOS boot diskette. Create it on the XP box, boot that diskette and copy files to said diskette. Done. The only issue I could see here is if the owner wasn't from 1995. Bob

3103	11	103838	2650872	2650839	R. Proffitt	12/10/07 11:33 AM	1.19728638E12	&quot;I copied the files to a floppy off of my desktop &quot;	This means you didn't read the instructions. Sorry but you may have to reveal if you are from 1995 where we used the command line, DOS commands and such. Given you are asking about Windows 95 I pegged you as the usual user from that time period. I tried to gracefully note that today's users may be a bit lost but maybe I was too subtle. I also don't provide step by steps when the web sites supply that. -&gt; Now run the file that you get from bootdisk.com and it will format the diskette and make the boot disk proper. Good luck, Bob
3103	12	103838	2650896	2650872	scottpush	12/10/07 11:54 AM	1.19728764E12	Actually	I did as the instructions said as such: 1. Most of the files above are disk images. Download the file to your C: drive, put a fresh disk in your A: drive, then click on the file to create the bootdisk. From there I'm stuck. May be obvious to you but it isn't to me. 95 is when I got the laptop. I am mildly used to working in DOS as I haven't bothered with it in eons. But some of the commands I'm familiar with.
3103	13	103838	2650880	2650896	R. Proffitt	12/10/07 11:58 AM	1.19728788E12	&quot;then click on the file to create the bootdisk.&quot;	It appears you copied the file to the diskette which isn't what I read for the instruction. Sorry but you may want to brush up on the DOS COPY command since it's coming up next. Bob
3103	14	103838	2650906	2650880	scottpush	12/10/07 12:12 PM	1.19728872E12	I	said I copied the file to the disc but didn't. I downloaded the Boot6.22 program to the desktop and ran it. Then it said put a clean disc in the A drive, which I did. Then it copied all these files to the disc.
3103	15	103838	2650888	2650906	R. Proffitt	12/10/07 12:48 PM	1.19729088E12	Remember ...	I can only go by what you tell me. Now all you need to do is boot that diskette. Again, working with the usual 95 owner they'll know how to do that. Or if they forget they'll look in the BIOS and set the floppy as the boot device. Bob
