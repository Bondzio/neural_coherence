there's places like Gizmodo or Engadget that have wide varieties of tech stuff as well as Low End Mac or 9 to 5 Mac for Apple stuff.
Mac World... Mac OS X Hints... lots and lots of places.
I mean if you Google stuff like this, you're sure to find some info somewhere.
The joy of corporate giants like Apple leaking info to us users on the net...
I love that.
Reading about rumored stuff when you know it's probably true or close to it is nice.
Hope this fills you in a little.
