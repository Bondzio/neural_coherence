I have 2 internet connections 256 kbps each connection hooked to the computer via ethernet cards (no router is used). Both connections are from 2 different ISP - 1 having dynamic IP while the other having a static IP. I would like to combine both the connections into 1 (512 kbps conenction -- not balance them) and the output connection should be using the static IP. How can I go about doing this? System config: AMD 3000+ with 512 MB RAM Two 100/10 Ethernet Cards (1 inbuilt in motherboad while other is seperately installed) Win XP SP2. Any help provided would be appreciated. Thank You

This typically requires using BGP and obtaining an Autonomous System number. You would be better off dumping one ISP and upgrading the other. SKrall

Until now I have found that you can do a load balancing with a built-in load balance router. To my opinion microtic OS router would be a good choice
