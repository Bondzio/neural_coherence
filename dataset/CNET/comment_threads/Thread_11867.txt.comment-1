I could not find a specific forum for video/graphic card, so here it goes.
I am thinking about upgrading my graphic card to a Sapphire Radeon HD 3850 AGP card.
On its web site it states the power supply requirement is 450W.
The current power supply on board is only 400W.
So I am wondering if the power supply requirement is &quot;sticky&quot;, or if there's any room to wiggle.
Has anybody &quot;exceeded&quot; the power supply requirement and experienced trouble with their machine?
I certainly don't want to upgrade the video card, then have to upgrade my power supply after.
