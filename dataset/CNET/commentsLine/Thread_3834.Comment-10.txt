the answer may lie in your bios.
to check this, you need to reboot and click delete when boot-up starts - this will get you into the bios.
when you see the menu on the blue screen, use the down arrow key to move the cursor to the third(?)
item from the top - advanced chipset features, then press enter.
on the new menu list, scroll down until you see an item marked onchip sound.
if it says it is disabled then select it by pressing enter, and select auto.
having done this, press f10 then yes to save and exit.
boot-up will then continue and you should have sound.
hope this helps.
