Hi, i have an ASUS A7N8X-LA, it is capable of 2GB DDR2 PC2700..
But I own an Compaq Presario S3190UK, PC with this motherboard and it is limited to 1GB.
Can I do something to add more memory, maybe via the bios or can i override somehow.
Thanks for any help you guys can give me or if you can point me in the right direction or if im stuck, thanks anyhow.
