I already had an old HP desktop running WIN98SE with a HP all-in-one printer connected via USB. I connected the desktop to the wireless router via ethernet cable, and both units are working great individually. However, I would like to network the two computers so I can use the printer with the laptop, etc. I have no networking experience, and I am reluctant to start changing settings without some kind of how-to guide. I checked Microsoft's site and found networking tips that explain how to link XP machines or WIN98E machines, but nothing that showed how to network XP with WIN98SE. They suggest that I update the old unit to XP(obviously, they're Microsoft) but the old unit doesn't have the processor speed or RAM to manage XP, and because the new laptop came loaded with XP with no OS disks,(a horrible scam computer makers are being allowed to pull) I couldn't load XP on the old machine anyway. (By the way its XP Media Center Edition) Can anyone suggest something? Any tips, suggestions, links, etc. would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, and happy holidays to all. Steven

Same for shares. -&gt; What wipes out most home networkers is they install a firewall and it blocks the sharing. Nothing in Windows is the issue there but I find people who ask this question to forget about the firewalls when they post. There can be another firewall in the router. All must be set to allow sharing. Bob
