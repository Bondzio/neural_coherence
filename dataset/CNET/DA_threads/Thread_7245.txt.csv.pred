1.1.1	Hard Drive only works by itself in my computer .	St
1.1.2	If I attach another IDE hdd my computer does not recognise either of them .	St
1.1.3	This problem only happens with this hard drive .	St
1.1.4	Any solutions please ?	Ques
1.2.1	jumper settings on both drives you want to attach .	St
1.2.2	The best way , with newer drives , is to use an 80 conductor cable and set jumpers to CS ( cable select ) .	St
1.2.3	The 80 conductor cable has a specific way it needs to be connected to the MB .	St
1.2.4	The important thing to note is that the blue connector goes to the motherboard .	St
1.3.1	That you get all the cables and jumpers right .	St
1.3.2	Here 's what you need to know .	St
1.3.3	Once in awhile you will find a drive that will not tolerate any second IDE device .	St
1.3.4	This may confuse the new to IDE technician .	St
1.3.5	After the initial shock and after encountering this a few more times it dawns on the tech that not all IDE devices can coexist .	St
1.3.6	Yes they should but the awful truth is that a few do n't .	St
1.3.7	At least we have other solutions .	St
1.3.8	I 'll leave jumper and cable discussions out of my replies since that 's been done many times and there are plenty of web pages about that .	St
1.3.9	Bob	St
1.4.1	Hi I am the same person whom you answered in the win xp forum about the sata drivers .	St
1.4.2	Both hd 's are IDE When I plug in my maxtor hard drive with my cd both are recognised When I plug in my western digital hard drive with my cd drive neither are recognised however this hard drive is recognised by itself when the cd drive is not connected .	St
1.4.3	So I feel that this one hard drive ( western digital ) which is only being recognised by itself has a problem .	St
1.4.4	Any solutions please .	Sug
1.4.5	I tried using jumpers .	St
1.4.6	I only have one ide connector .	St
1.4.7	I need to get this working so I can install windows on it .	St
1.4.8	Please assist	St
1.5.1	This WD faulty hd worked as a slave in my other pc before .	St
1.5.2	Today i formatted it and was going to install Windows and found that when I plugged in this hd , both ide connections were not being recognised	St
1.6.1	Please Help	St
1.7.1	I noted the usual and that jumpers and cables are widely documented .	St
1.7.2	Can you be more specific ?	Ques
1.8.1	This WD faulty hd worked as a slave in my other pc before .	St
1.8.2	Today i formatted it and was going to install Windows and found that when I plugged in this hd , both ide connections were not being recognised I do n't understand why it should not work now .	St
1.8.3	Please help	St
1.9.1	Parts do fail from time to time .	St
1.9.2	Folk get the jumpers wrong .	St
1.9.3	Some ca n't accept cable , jumper or hardware faults .	St
1.9.4	Remember that I elected to not write about cables or jumpers as that 's been done .	St
1.9.5	Here 's one thought .	St
1.9.6	Test each drive on its own .	St
1.9.7	Bob	St
1.10.1	As this pc works with other hard drives using the same cables I would expect it to work .	St
1.10.2	I am quite sure that my jumpers settings are correct .	St
1.10.3	Do you need an more details .	St
1.10.4	Thanks	Polite
1.11.1	drives work on their own .	St
1.11.2	No need to talk about cable and jumpers .	St
1.11.3	I am sure they are correct .	St
1.11.4	What would be the other cause please ?	Ques
1.12.1	So Would y ? ou say that the hard drive is probably faulty	St
1.13.1	If the drives work one at a time but not together and you claim the cables and jumpers are fine then it 's the usual problem I 've seen over the years .	St
1.13.2	Why not put these two each on their own IDE channel ?	Ques
1.14.1	do n't have another channel .	St
1.14.2	I have other sata connectors but not another ide one	St
1.15.1	Faulty drive works in a hard drive external enclosure	St
1.16.1	Some techs ca n't wrap their head around that .	St
1.16.2	And again the jumpers and cable types do matter .	St
1.16.3	Well discussed but no where did I find where you told exactly what you used .	St
1.16.4	Could be that issue I noted or could be the jumper and cable issues .	St
1.16.5	But your posts omit details and I did n't duplicate web content on jumpers and cables .	St
1.16.6	Makes you wonder if it 's one or the other usual issue .	St
1.16.7	Bob	St
1.17.1	Yeah you are right .	Res
1.17.2	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.17.3	this hdd was in my external enclosure and i attempted to install xp .	St
1.17.4	Computer shutdown with some error .	St
1.17.5	I then booted into the hdd and it continued to install .	St
1.17.6	last question .	St
1.17.7	will this still be a successful install	St
1.18.1	sorry , No need to answer question thanks a lot	Polite
1.19.1	Is when the machine is SATA and ca n't emulate IDE .	St
1.19.2	Then when we emulate IDE the IDE ports can become disabled .	St
1.19.3	The vicious cycle begins .	St
1.19.4	My lesson on this is simple .	St
1.19.5	Use an OS that supports SATA .	St
1.19.6	Yes there are procedures that use a floppy drive but what to do when the floppy drive is broke , missing and the owner wo n't fix that ?	Ques
1.19.7	Bob	St
1.20.1	I do n't know the model # s , size or age of your Maxtor and WD drives but can tell you that I 've never seen a specific jumper standard shared by all drive manufacturers or even between product lines from the same manufacturer .	St
1.20.2	Since you mentioned using a HD with a CD ROM , I can tell you that this can often through a real monkey wrench into the works .	St
1.20.3	Be careful of & quot ; Master & quot ; settings .	St
1.20.4	Some will allow that setting if only one drive is installed and some consider that the master jumper position means that a slave exists and you can not use it with a single HD .	St
1.20.5	What you need is the instructions from the manufacturer for each drive model to figure out their scheme .	St
1.20.6	Unfortunately the only experiences I 've ever had with Maxtor drives have been bad so I avoid them .	St
1.20.7	I also avoid trying to mix drives from other manufacturers or even vintages .	St
1.20.8	If one is older IDE and one is called an EIDE , ultra ATA , etc. , I would n't mix them on the same cable .	St
1.20.9	Maybe if you know the HD model # s that might help dig up better information about what jumper settings are valid .	St
1.21.1	Hi Bob , Just one question .	St
1.21.2	If I have a faulty ribbon cable in a computer is it ok to swap it with another ribbon cable which fits in the computer and makes the computer work or would the new one spoil my computer .	St
1.21.3	Thanks , AC	St
1.22.1	Pretty much a generic item .	St
1.22.2	If you researched this you found 2 common models with 3 connectors and two ribbon cable types .	St
1.22.3	If you use the older ribbon cable type the worst that could happen is the drive data is corrupted .	St
1.22.4	The newer ribbon cable type can be used without issue except you have to set the jumpers and the drives must & quot ; like & quot ; each other .	St
1.22.5	I covered the old tech stumper earlier about drives that never work on the same IDE channel .	St
1.22.6	This one has caused months of time lost for some techs .	St
1.22.7	Some ca n't wrap their head about that .	St
1.22.8	Bob	St
