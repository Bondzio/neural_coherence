you may be on the right track, but let me add a few thoughts.
1. a new machine would have a warranty.
use it.
make it their problem.
2. a new motherboard doesn't always have the latest bios and such will create much grief for the owner.
hint... 3. remove the case cover.
if its heat, then the issues will subside.
4. xp glides onto good hardware.
but you have an amd system so you as the os installer get to find and install all the lovely drivers for motherboard, video, audio, usb and more since microsoft doesn't do that.
if not, i'd expect the machine to be very unpredictable.
