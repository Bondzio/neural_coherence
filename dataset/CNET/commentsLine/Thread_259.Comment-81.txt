windows 'drag 'n drop' to a cd is &quot;cute&quot;, if you want 2-3m of pics to show friends or have printed at your local photo shop.
or shar a couple of mp3s... in my experience, nero and roxio work ok until they don't since i went over to cdburnerxppro thanks to bob proffitt , i have yet to throw a cd out the window because the program crashed or the cd is unreadable.... flash drives (256m-2g) are ok for &quot;casual&quot; back ups, but if you want to back up your whole hd?...you either use an external hd or you hook up a 2nd hd in your computer and use that... you have been offered a ton of advice and are probably feeling a little overwhelmed, but all you need is time and patience for what it's worth, my advice is: turn off the computer disconnect your cd drives reboot in the bios, say no cd drives run explorer delete any cd burner programs (roxio and nero) you have installed if you can't find the uninstall (sometimes called &quot;unwise.exe&quot;)files do a simple 'shift+delete' of the directory's containing the files and if necessary run a registry cleaner program to remove the junk that may be left behind reboot download and install the cd burner program mentioned above turn off the computer reconnect the cd drives reboot and in bios set the new drives to &quot;auto-detect&quot; it should work.... one more comment: when you say &quot;i need to make a backup copy, format my hard drive and turn right around and copy the backup data to the hard drive&quot; i hope you mean 'data' back up and not a hd back up???
