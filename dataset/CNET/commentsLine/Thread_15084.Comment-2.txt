if your hard drive is more than 2 generations old (and it probably is with only 2mb cache), then you could well see a noticable improvement from a new drive.
the extra cache will help and the transfer rates of hard drives have steadily increased over the past 5 years so you could jump from 30mb/sec to 50mb/sec which means quicker boot, quicker app startup, etc.
