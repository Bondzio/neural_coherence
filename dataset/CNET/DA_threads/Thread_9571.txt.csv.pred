1.1.1	I own a Dell Dimension 8300 .	St
1.1.2	It had 512MB RAM until I formatted the C drive and now its saying it only has 256MB RAM .	St
1.1.3	I use a Studio Max and need all the memory I can get .	St
1.1.4	Can anyone help me ?	Ques
1.1.5	O ya , I have an 875P Motherboard if thats of any use .	St
1.1.6	Finally as Im new to this forum I was wondering can you get direct replies to you email address ?	Ques
1.2.1	A BIOS display ?	Ques
1.2.2	Or Windows ?	Ques
1.2.3	In Windows , there 's a box that you can limit the reported memory ...	St
1.2.4	But you need to tell more .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Did you try unplugging and reseating the memory .	St
1.4.1	Yes , when I started the computer some writing came up on the screen ( Is this a BIOS display ) saying the memory had changed .	St
1.4.2	A friend called up to me yesterday ( he worked in Dell before so I suppose he knows the inside of a computer better than me ) and just did the old fashioned thing .	St
1.4.3	He took out the memory stick and put it back in and its working fine now .	St
1.4.4	One problem I have now though is when I open MS Word it takes longer than it should , like 10 - 15 seconds and sometimes when I right click on a file it takes a while for the options to appear .	St
1.4.5	I have all my antivirus software up to date and did a full system scan which didnt detect anything .	St
1.4.6	Could the slowdown be due to spyware perhaps or cookies ?	Ques
1.5.1	Yes , a friend did it for me yesterday and it worked .	St
1.5.2	Thanks for the help .	St
1.5.3	Only problem now is sometimes when I have applications like CAD or Word open and when I click on File it takes about ten seconds for the menu to appear .	St
1.5.4	This has never happened before .	St
1.5.5	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.5.6	Spyware maybe ?	Ques
1.6.1	I 'm unsure about your question .	St
1.6.2	Are you asking if you should use the tools like Spybot , Adaware , CWshredder and Housecall to be sure your machine is pest free ?	Ques
1.6.3	Why be uncertain ?	Ques
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Besides the programs Robert mentioned you may want to consider what is going on when you do this .	St
1.7.2	If your system has been idle for a while the Hard drive may spin down and have to spin up to speed .	St
1.7.3	If you click on file once and it is slow , what happens the next time , is it still slow , if not that may be the reason .	St
1.7.4	You have more than one system and have mapped a networked drive from another and that system is not turned on , the file view window can be very slow coming up .	St
1.7.5	If you are using Norton Anti virus 2002 this is a common problem .	St
1.7.6	( fixed in 2003 ) .	St
1.8.1	I would wonder what happened prior to your & quot ; lost & quot ; memory .	St
1.8.2	perhaps a more comprehensive cleaning is in order .	St
1.8.3	Dirty contacts or perhaps what may have caused the memory to lose contact is at issue .	St
1.8.4	You could also have heat issues or even power supply issues .	St
1.8.5	That does not exclude application or system software or spyware as being a new and different problem .	St
1.8.6	I do n't think reseating the memory fixes or relates to those problems .	St
1.9.1	Bob , I am interested in your reply post to another with missing RAM .	St
1.9.2	You said there is a box in Windows that can limit RAM .	St
1.9.3	I need more info on this .	St
1.9.4	I put in 2 ea 1 GB sticks of ram on my Dell 4600 , 2.8mhz , single core , Windows XP Home , system .	St
1.9.5	When my system slowed down all of a sudden , I found it was registering only 1 GB of RAM .	St
1.9.6	I reseated then swapped RAM sticks with each other with no improvement .	St
1.9.7	So , I either have a configuration problem or my second RAM slot on the MB is bad .	St
1.9.8	Hopefully , you can provide the needed info on the configs .	St
1.9.9	Thanks .	Polite
1.9.10	Dave H .	St
