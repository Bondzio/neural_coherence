It boots up just fine from a power-off situation, but if you try to restart it, it always gets hung up (or something like that, I guess...no signal gets sent to the monitor which shuts down, but the lights on the computer case remain on). In order to reboot, you need to power it off, then turn it back on. This happens every time, and has since I got the machine a few months ago. I've not really cared much, since it always powers up just fine and I have no other problems with the computer or OS. But it is annoying, that I can't just restart normally and need to power down and then power up again. Any thoughts? Including some of my dxdiag file for some system specs... ------------------ System Information ------------------ Time of this report: 11/22/2007, 21:37:02 Operating System: Windows Vista Home Premium (6.0, Build 6000) (6000.vista_gdr.070828-1515) Language: English (Regional Setting: English) System Manufacturer: System manufacturer System Model: System Product Name BIOS: Phoenix - AwardBIOS v6.00PG Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU 6700 @ 2.66GHz (2 CPUs), ~2.7GHz Memory: 3326MB RAM Page File: 798MB used, 6028MB available Windows Dir: C:\Windows DirectX Version: DirectX 10 DX Setup Parameters: Not found DxDiag Version: 6.00.6000.16386 32bit Unicode

If you still do not want to take it back to the store reinstall the OS it might have install incorrectly. No disk order one from the manufacturer or make one in &quot;Backup and Restore Center&quot;. How do you like Vista? (3GB RAM, DirectX 10, few month old system) This thread untracked.
