i already installed mobo drivers.
thanks (removing and readding the cdrom drive) sotra worked but.. planescape torment... when i got to a new area it wants the cd, even though the cd's in there.
i don't have this trouble under win98.
other times with other programs it sometimes has trouble 'seeing' the cd under xp but not win98.
mobo ga-71xe thunderbird athlon 750.
