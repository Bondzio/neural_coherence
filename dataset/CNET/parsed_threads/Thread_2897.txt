<s> I currently am doing audio recording using a Compaq Ap550 workstation, which has dual P3 processors (1Ghz each), 1Gb rdram, an Nvidia Quadro-4 980 8x AGP (the Mobo only runs 4X), all legacy disabled and my audio is via USB 2.0 (M-audio Fasttrack Pro). </s>
<s> I also have a Creative Labs X-Fi Fidelity sound card. </s>
<s> 18Gb SCSI U160 system disk and ATA-100 250Gb storage. </s>
<s> Lite-on CDRW/DVD RW combo. </s>
<s> I'm running XP sp2. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade the system and am currently reviewing motherboards. </s>
<s> I'd like to keep as much existing hardware as possible, though I will replace the SCSI with a SATA drive. </s>
<s> The Quadro was a worker in its day but I suspect replacing it with as good a PCI-Ex for the reasonable $ I paid is going to be tough. </s>
<s> I'm considering an ASUS P5VD1-X, 2GB DDR2 and a Pentium D 2.66Ghz. </s>
<s> as it supports both AGP-8X and PCI-Ex I could use my Quadro until I'm ready to pop for a new GC. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on these boards? </s>
<s> They are hard to find new and seem to have been replaced with the P5VD2-X PCI-Ex only. </s>
<s> Same board but no AGP it seems. </s>
<s> Are there any others I might consider? </s>
<s> but you need to say goodbye to agp and most stuff in your compaq. </s>
<s> keep the m-audio, x-fi, 250gb drive, and cd/dvd combo. </s>
<s> your quadro is based on geforce 4 gpus. </s>
<s> a geforce 7600 or radeon x1600 will run circles around it and they're only $120. </s>
<s> also, don't get a pentium-d... its obsolete tech. </s>
<s> a core2duo e4300 is the least you should consider. </s>
<s> here's a suggested self-build for a $1000 pc. </s>
<s> mobo, $112: gigabyte ga-965gm-s2 cpu, $185: core2duo e6300 2gb ram, $165: corsair vs2gbkit667d2 2x1gb ddr2-667 250gb hard drive, $80: seagate st3250824as sata mid-range video, $165: sapphire radeon x1950pro 256mb keyboard/mouse, $42: microsoft 69n-00013s wireless combo vista premium oem, $120 newegg total: $869 case/power supply $125: antec sonata ii w/450w power supply from circuit city/best buy/compusa grand total: $994 </s>
<s> Thanks good suggestions, especially the graphics comparisons. </s>
<s> I already have Vista Business ready to go, except that M-Audio and much of the recording hardware is still behind the curve, so it will have to be XP for a while longer. </s>
<s> 64 bit even later. </s>
<s> I have a new case / PS and wireless KB/Mouse etc. </s>
<s> Core Duo makes sense as I'm already sold on multi-processors anyway. </s>
