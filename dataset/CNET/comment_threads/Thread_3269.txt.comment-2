The temps look normal, very normal.
Without speedfan the fans do a fair job.
Running speedfan enables the fans to 100% and the machine is cooler.
But don't put too much stock in those temp sensors.
I get two different temps when comparing SpeedFan to Everest.
Just looking at the numbers, your machine and drives are well below any danger zone.
If you lost a drive it's not because of temperature.
