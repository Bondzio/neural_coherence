<s> Coryphaeus, this is George. </s>
<s> Please do not joke with me when I ask for help with a problem. </s>
<s> I say the &quot;puter does not recognized the cd-rom. </s>
<s> In my Device Manager there is a yellow triangle with a black exclamation mark telling there is something wrong. </s>
<s> I wouldn't waste your time and please if you wont help dont waste mine. </s>
<s> All I ask for, is for a moderator whom I have had very successful communications with, for help. </s>
<s> I troubleshoot the device, upgrade the driver, it says the present driver is the best for the cd-rom. </s>
<s> It says to un-install and re-install device. </s>
<s> That dont work. </s>
<s> So I ask for help. </s>
<s> Now if you can help me, PLEASE do. </s>
<s> I would truly appreciate it. </s>
<s> Thanks in advanced </s>
<s> I can't guess what OS is in use, how the drive is connected, jumpered or if the old boot the CD test works. </s>
<s> I understand you'd like help, but the supplied information is just far too skimpy. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> In original posting, I indicated mostly what was needed for assistance. </s>
<s> I am using an AMD K-7 Athlon, 1.1gig, OS Win XP prof, 40gig HD, with an Atapi cd-rom and a Lite-on LTR burner which is classified as a cd-rom. </s>
<s> Its the Atapi-cd-rom that is not being recognized by my computer. </s>
<s> I have gone into SAFEMODE, into Device Manager, System, UN-install, rebooted and it found new equipment,(cd-rom), but it still came up with that black exclamation mark. </s>
<s> Troubleshooting states &quot;Windows cannot load device driver for this hardware. </s>
<s> The driver maybe corrupted or missing. </s>
<s> Code 39. </s>
<s> I've gone into my CMOS but nothing seems to help. </s>
<s> Maybe a new one would help, huh? </s>
<s> lol. </s>
<s> George I am using my secondary slot on moboard. </s>
<s> I have HD in primary slot if that is their names. </s>
<s> And not a hardware issue. </s>
<s> This is the PC Hardware Forum. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The CODE 39 is what I'll address first -&gt; Remove the upper and lower filters. </s>
<s> The noted keys are: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325 -11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318} - &quot;Upperfilters&quot; and &quot;Lowerfilters&quot;. </s>
<s> Sorry, but I will not supply a reference URL. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> XP will not supply proper motherboard drivers for such hardware. </s>
<s> You must install the latest motherboard driver package for your board and for the selected OS. </s>
<s> I would have supplied the URL of said package, but your post didn't tell the motherboard make and model. </s>
<s> That should resolve this if you have the jumpers proper for the IDE cables you are using. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Glad to hear from you. </s>
<s> Hope all ur holidays are filled with good tidings and joyful moments. </s>
<s> I will give these options a try. </s>
<s> George </s>
<s> Best of luck and have a great day! </s>
