1.1.1	In the last eight months , my Sony Vaio laptop of three years has had one thing after another go wrong , the latest being the LCD screen 's backlight is dead ( I currently type from my laptop , while hooked to a monitor ) .	St
1.1.2	The cost of repairs , most of them done by myself , to fix this laptop now would be anywhere between $ 450- $ 600 ; that 's not even touching on the fact that this only has the limited power that existed three years ago .	St
1.1.3	So , I believe I 'm looking for a new computer .	St
1.1.4	I 've seen mixed reviews about eMachines , which was my first look ( due to the pricing ) , so I 'm coming here .	St
1.1.5	Let me outline some of the things I 'm looking for : - Desktop computer ; no more laptops for me - Lots of hard drive space , at least over 100GB - 512MB RAM - AMD chip ( I 'm a fan ... ) - 3+ USB ports - Sound does n't have to be great , but it has to be reasonable ; I want a place to hook my headset - At least reasonable graphic capabilities .	St
1.1.6	Does n't have to be the best , but does n't need to be the worst .	St
1.1.7	- Monitor does n't really matter to me , so long as it supports 1024x768 resolution at least - Price under $ 900 ; in or around that , feel free to post it too I really like the look of some eMachines ' computers , but some of the prices make me wonder if what one pays for IS N'T what one gets ( or at least in terms of quality ) -- ( also DO they or DO N'T they come with a monitor ? ) .	Ques
1.1.8	If anyone can offer some details into eMachines , such as which model is currently looking to be the best and most reliable , or knows of a computer that fits or closely fits my specifications , I would greatly appreciate the information .	St
1.1.9	Thank you !	St
1.1.10	Sincerely , Lelia Katherine Thomas http : //www.leliathomas.com	St
1.2.1	people seem to be pretty happy with Emachines .	St
1.2.2	I 've also heard some good things about Gateway , so I suggest you check that out as well .	St
1.2.3	-JDM	St
1.3.1	In case you did n't know , they 're basically the same company now .	St
1.3.2	( Emachines was bought out by Gateway . )	St
1.3.3	However , Gateway is still marketing stuff under the Emachines and Gateway brands .	St
1.3.4	-JDM	St
1.4.1	Yeah , I had read about their buying eMachines , but what led me on more to eMachines was definitely the AMD chip .	St
1.4.2	Not that things do n't change LOT in seven years , but I did have a Gateway 1998 , and it was good for the time , though had a lot of instability .	St
1.4.3	Never did figure out whether that had to do with the OS or the computer quality .	St
1.4.4	lol , things sucked back then .	St
1.4.5	XD Thanks for the reply !	St

1.5.2	Roger	St
1.6.1	I 've had no issues with my Gateway built eMachines T6216 .	St
1.6.2	I added an additional 512MB or DDR ( did not even really need it ) and a 17 & quot ; Gateway flat panel monitor which matches the tower .	St
1.6.3	My last Gateway , a 900 Series , was bulletproof and is still running like a champ at a friends house .	St
1.7.1	I had looked at that , but I also saw a previous post that there were a lot of problems with the large hard drive .	St
1.7.2	I saw someone saying it was due to their being old ( er ) parts .	St
1.7.3	That 's the only reason I have n't been as sure on this one .	St
1.7.4	If you have any information that can disprove that issue , I 'd greatly appreciate it .	St
1.7.5	Sincerely , Lelia Katherine Thomas http : //www.leliathomas.com	St
1.8.1	I 've heard mixed things about this version of eMachines , thus my reluctancy .	St
1.8.2	I 've heard some things about the large hard drive being rather unstable .	St
1.8.3	Know anything about this ?	Ques
1.8.4	: / Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated !	St
1.8.5	Thanks already for posting !	St
1.8.6	Sincerely , Lelia Katherine Thomas http : //www.leliathomas.com	St
1.9.1	I 've had no issues with the HD or making a recovery DVD .	St
1.9.2	The HD is a Seagate , which from what I understand is a decent HD .	St
1.10.1	There will always be machines that will be sent & quot ; dead on arrival & quot ; .	St
1.10.2	The best thing you can do is to immediately test the machine and if it does n't work , send it back and get another one , or demand a full refund .	St
1.10.3	I know ppls who have had no problems with the machine .	St
1.10.4	If you 're lucky , you 'll get a working one , if not , well do what i just suggested .	St
1.10.5	If you do n't want to take the risk , build your own pc .	St
1.10.6	Because all computer manufacuturers have these sort of problems .	St
1.10.7	Roger	St
1.11.1	Well just like everyone else on the planet I 'm gona reccommend the T6212 because it is simply a good computer for the price .	St
1.11.2	( I wish I could buy 1 ! )	Sug
1.11.3	I felt the same hesitancy about buying my T3256 but I did alot of research and I 'm completely satisfied .	St
1.11.4	The emachines company has made great strides in the past years and you shouldnt look at them any differently than Dell , HP , Sony , etc .	St
1.11.5	Now if I was buying 1 of those Microtel computers from Walmart then I 'd be alittle wary .	St
1.11.6	My computer has had no problems to this day .	St
1.11.7	Windows still boots up in 30 seconds .	St
1.11.8	I 'm a happy guy lol .	Polite
1.11.9	As for the stability of the 160gb Seagate , I highly doubt Seagate would make an unstable harddrive .	St
1.11.10	Problems with hardrives are not usually caused by a & quot ; bad hardrive , & quot ; it 's the software that you put on the harddrives .	St
1.11.11	Maybe that is the case with your hearing of the bad harddrives .	St
1.11.12	I have n't heard anything .	St
1.11.13	All the components of the T6212 are compatable with each other and should n't cause any problems .	St
1.11.14	If they did then why would emachines sell the computer ?	Ques
1.11.15	To answer some questions ... Emachines computers are technically sold as stand-alone computers ( without monitors , printer.. ) Outlets like Bestbuy tend to package an Emachines monitor with a system , just look in a Bestbuy flyer , you see them every weekend .	St
1.11.16	This is good if you want everything in one purchase .	St
1.11.17	But you can get your own monitor if you want too by buying the computer stand-alone .	St
1.11.18	It 's an advantage and disadvantage .	St
1.11.19	( I think it is smart of emachines to do this ) Look out for rebates .	St
1.11.20	There is a $ 50 rebate for the T6212 alone .	St
1.11.21	Also another $ 50 rebate for the emachines CRT monitor .	St
1.11.22	So if you buy them seperate then you could save $ 100 .	St
1.11.23	You could purchase the computer and monitor for $ 699.98 with savings at Bestbuy .	St
1.11.24	Then compare that to the package deals with the T6212 , if there is any ?	Ques
1.11.25	If you are still nervous about an Emachines , buy the extended warranty .	St
1.11.26	I would n't let the & quot ; old & quot ; hard drive issue prevent me from buying at this time .	St
1.11.27	Just as damasta55r said , you can always return it and if luck has it you wo n't be affected .	St
1.11.28	Hope that helps .	St
1.12.1	while I have n't personally owned an eMachines , and the last time I bought a computer at retail it cost nearly $ 5000 and eMachines was considered junk at the time ( and they still cost $ 700+ for a system about 1/3rd the power of what I bought ) BUT I 'd suggest two things : The T6212 as every one seems to be suggesting it , and from the specs i 've seen it looks very nice for the price but my personal choice would be to extend the budget about $ 125 and build it yourself configured at www.newegg.com , $ 1004.93 w/no monitor , shipping , KB , mouse or speakers : Athlon64 3500+ ATI Radeon X600XT 1GB PC 3200 DDR 7.1 sound 250GB Maxtor SATA-150 Hard Drive WindowsXP Home Edition w/SP2 DVD/RW Drive DVD-ROM Drive Antec 450W PSU w/Antec SOHO File Server case ( it 's REALLY expensive ( $ 139.00 for the case/PSU combo , which imo is great considering the PSU boasts better rails than the NeoPower , and the entire thing costs $ 15 more than NeoPower ( and NeoPower does n't have a case w/it ... ) and it includes a free 128MB USB Thumb drive i 'm assuming you have a monitor , by the fact that your using your laptop through a monitor and a KB and mouse can be had for $ 20 or less at newegg speakers are your choice , but you said you had a headset , so this works in that case SO you can get the eMachines , which afaik sports no graphics card , 512MB of RAM , and a 160GB hard drive or build it yourself , getting an Athlon64 3500 , over a 3200 , getting 1GB of RAM , almost 100GB more of hard drive space ( and it 's brand new , i doubt the eMachines would have issues , but this one wo n't have any ( i am personally a Maxtor fan ) ) and the X600XT is easily fast enough to power through any game you can come up with ( At a VERY attractive price ) that is just my suggestion ... here are the product links for the hardware I configured with if your want to cut costs things to consider cutting : CPU , downgrade from Athlon64 3500 to Athlon64 3200 ( i wish the 3400 still existed for Socket 939 ) RAM , downgrade from 1GB ( 2x512 ) to 512MB ( 2x256 ) HDD , downgrade from 250GB to 80-200GB sized drive ( 80 's are as cheap as $ 56 , 160 's for about $ 100 , this 250 is $ 135 ) Case , downgrade to a $ 30 case PSU , downgrade to a Thermaltake or cheaper Antec or Enermax unit I would not change : the motherboard the platform ( meaning do n't goto Socket 754 ) the gfx card ( for $ 124 it is about the best deal your going to find ) the casing ( i really would n't , it 's a great case , and PSU , both from a great company , it includes good cooling ( adaptive 120MM fan , should do perfect ) and will make things easier ) i would really not change the RAM , as 1GB makes gaming and WindowsXP in general run MUCH smoother Product links : Case/PSU http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp ? description=11-129-159 & catalog=23 & manufactory=BROWSE DVD/RW Drive http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp ? description=27-152-038 & catalog=23 & manufactory=BROWSE DVD Drive http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp ? description=27-151-212 & catalog=23 & manufactory=BROWSE Hard Drive http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp ? description=22-144-327 & catalog=23 & manufactory=BROWSE RAM http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp ? description=20-161-627 & catalog=23 & manufactory=BROWSE Motherboard http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp ? description=13-152-053 & catalog=23 & manufactory=BROWSE CPU ( includes a HSF ) http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp ? description=19-103-514 & catalog=23 & manufactory=BROWSE WindowsXP http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp ? description=37-102-151 & catalog=23 & manufactory=BROWSE Video Card http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp ? description=14-123-140 & catalog=23 & manufactory=BROWSE personally i 'd use those parts if you decide to build on your own , i 'd avoid the following parts : Intel entirely - too expensive for comparable performance to AMD ( Currently ) AGP for mid-range gfx - the mobo may be cheaper , BUT the gfx cards will be $ 100- $ 150 , and that X600XT will probably outperform them all Bad PSU 's - if it looks cheap , avoid it , you want 24A on the +12v or better ( or 2 +12v , like the Antec I linked , which has 2 +12v @ 18A each , meaning VERY good power )	St
1.13.1	get a new case , psu , ram , graphics card .	St
1.13.2	No need a new hard drive .	St
1.13.3	160GB is more than enough .	St
1.13.4	Roger	St
1.14.1	$ 700 for the system new case ( if you were buying the same parts i 'm talking about ) new case/PSU - $ 140 new RAM - $ 100 or more new graphics card - $ 124+ so your at $ 700 for the system and around $ 365 in upgrades so it 's like $ 1065 with less harddrive a less featured motherboard ( i gurantee eMachines ' board ca n't touch that Chaintech in features , quality , and performance ) and a slower CPU ... if you throw in a 3500 your up to around $ 1400 so please consider before posting	St
1.15.1	I read that too ; someone submitted a post stating that the problem was set to be corrected in May 2005 so I 'm sitting tight for now and have decided to wait to see if EMachine plans to correct the problem with the HD .	St
1.15.2	I read a post similar to that somewhere on this website .	St
1.15.3	Big Steve End Of Message 04/14/05	St
1.16.1	Hi Lelia , Well , if considering the Emachine T6212 , you may as well wait for the next big sale .	St
1.16.2	Last week was when to buy the T6212 .	St
1.16.3	The packaged deal for the CRT Monitor and Printer with the emachine T6212 for $ 550 expired at Best Buy after this past Saturday , April 9th .	St
1.16.4	They change their sales flyers every Sunday .	St
1.16.5	Circuit City also had the same $ 550 package deal with monitor and printer for $ 550 , but unaware of when it expires ... probably last Saturday also .	St
1.16.6	Since Best Buy indicated in last weeks flyer for a upgrade from the 17 & quot ; CRT monitor to a 15 & quot ; LCD monitor for $ 80 increase on their emachine T3882 and T3958 , perhaps they might consider doing the same on the T6212 for the next sale .	St
1.17.1	combination price at Circuit City on the T6212 if interested .	St
1.17.2	Just now noticed .	St
1.17.3	Had thought it expired last Saturday like Best Buy .	St
1.17.4	Course ' the combination special could reappear in weeks to come with Best Buy .	St
1.17.5	Anyway the T6212 normally sells for $ 580 without a monitor or printer .	St
1.17.6	Circuit City showing sale extension for T6212 with emachine 17 & quot ; Flat-screen CRT monitor and Canon PIXMA Photo Printer , in package for $ 550 that ends at 5PM ET ( Eastern Time ) today .	St
1.17.7	http : //www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/118273/bundleId/1213/rpem/ccd/bundleDetail.do	St
1.18.1	I just today bought my T6212 package from Circuit City - played with it in the store and it was much faster than the old 1Ghz P3 laptop I 've been using .	St
1.18.2	Evryone on these forums says to upgrade , but I am confused as to what to get .	St
1.18.3	I bought some memory online : http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp ? description=20-141-423 & depa=0 but it was suspiciously half the price of the PC3200 they had at Best Buy , tho as far as I could tell it is the same product for half the price .	St
1.18.4	Was this good memory to get ?	Ques
1.18.5	I guess I need a video card too ?	Ques
1.18.6	Very hard to find recos - any thoughts as to what is the best to get for around $ 150-200 ?	Ques
1.18.7	PLUS , I need to hook it up to my Wireless network - is PCI card or USB best for this , and if so , which one ?	Ques
1.18.8	Thanks !	St
1.19.1	Congratulations ... . yes , the 1 gig of Kingston is right on and should be A-OK. For good gaming in your price range I would suggest the Nvidia GeForce 6600GT PCI-Express around $ 172 from NewEgg .	St
1.19.2	I have no personal experience with wireless networking , perhaps others will comment .	St
1.20.1	the system cost only $ 579 for a crt , keyboard , mouse , speaker , and printer on sale .	St
1.20.2	Roger	St
1.21.1	I have a Compaq Presario SLR1215CL .	St
1.21.2	AMD Sempron 3000+ 512MB RAM ( I think expandable to 2GB ) 120GB Harddrive 2.00GHz Windows XP Home 17in Flat Pannel CRT Moniter Of course I got this at christmas time , so you wo n't get this excact model .	St
1.21.3	I would suggest going on the website and looking at the SR1010Z series .	St
1.22.1	John : So soon after purchasing a new EMachine T6212 I read these posts of owners planning to make immediate upgrades to their machines .	St
1.22.2	Would n't that void the manufacturer 's warranty or do the owners wait until the warranty on the computer has expired ?	Ques
1.22.3	Big Steve End Of Message 04/16/05	St
1.23.1	I do not know what the current warranty is with emachines or if there is a clause concerning breaking a seal of some type .	St
1.23.2	Of course it is very easy to uninstall upgraded RAM and a Video Card .	St
1.23.3	Also if there is a defect in something , emachines would probably mail the new part and suggest where to go to have it installed .	St
1.23.4	Of course , since you indicated what you need a computer for , you would not be installing additional RAM and a Video Card , as that is to increase performance primarily in gaming .	St
1.24.1	yesterday deadline has been removed and the packaged combo of T6212 with monitor & printer for $ 550 after rebates is still showing , in case you are still interested .	St
1.24.2	http : //www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/118273/bundleId/1213/rpem/ccd/bundleDetail.do	St
1.25.1	Good suggestion Rockon about the HP SR1010Z for those who would want similar to the emachine T6212 at just a slight increase in the regular cost .	Sug
1.25.2	Compaq Presario SR1010Z customizable Desktop PC PU166AV # ABA * Microsoft ( R ) Windows ( R ) XP Home Edition with SP2 * AMD Athlon ( TM ) 64 3200+ operating at 2.2GHz * 512 MB DDR / PC3200 ( 1 DIMM ) * 160GB 7200rpm SATA Hard Drive * Double Layer 16X DVD +/-R/RW drive * 48x max .	St

St
1.25.7	As of today , Circuit City is still offering a package deal on T6212 with monitor and printer for $ 550 .	St
1.25.8	The same package deal with Best Buy ended last Saturday , but may be repeated in some weeks to come .	St
1.26.1	Very similiar to what I have , I have the HP A810n , I checked and both have the Asus K8SLA ( salmon ) motherboard .	St
1.26.2	The A810n came with a 250 watt HiPro power supply , I changed to a 450 watt PSU because I wanted to run a high end grapics card .	St
1.26.3	So far I am very happy with my computer .	St
1.26.4	It runs quiet , Cool and after upping the ram to 1 gig and getting a nice AGP video card I can do pretty much anything I want in regard to gaming , And playing with DVD burner , Etc .	St
1.26.5	With the upgrades I added .	St
1.26.6	( except the video card ) I was able to get the computer , The memory , and a 17 & quot ; lcd monitor for under $ 900 .	St
1.26.7	I paid 679 for the actual computer , However HP had a 100 rebate on any athlon 64 purchased at the time .	St
1.26.8	I purchased the computer on March 4th and I got the rebate check from HP on around the 1st of April .	St
1.26.9	( btw , With any rebate , Send it certified mail , It truly helps ! ! )	St
1.26.10	Btw , The E-Machines are also nice computers for the money , My brother in law has had a couple and some friends at work have them also and they have never had any issues with them .	St
1.27.1	Clicking on the link today ( Sunday ) will get , & quot ; We 're Sorry !	St
1.27.2	You 've encountered an error at circuitcity.com. & quot ; So now pay $ 579.97 without a monitor or printer for the T6212 .	St
1.27.3	Course ' Best Buy/Circuit City may offer the same 'package deal ' again sometime in the future .	St
1.28.1	you have a very good setup .	St
1.29.1	I would suggest the GeForce 6600nU for PCIE , instead of the GeForce 6600GT ( the nU is slightly slower , yet still easily capable ( and only around $ 135 ) ) or the Radeon X600XT , which is $ 124 and equivalent performance to the 6600 ( the GeForce 6600 = GeForce 6600nU = GeForce 6600 128MB ) as to networking I would suggest a PCI add-in card , mainly because you ca n't accidentally unplug it ( at least , it 'd be harder to do ) and PCI add-in cards usually offer the ability to connect an antenna that is n't on the back of the PC or that is wired into a larger antena to send/recieve ( a large Wi-Fi antenna , like a large Yagi ( simmilar to the & quot ; Cantenna & quot ; concept )	St
1.30.1	Have you considered building your own ?	Ques
1.30.2	I 've been in a similar position as yourself over the last couple of years .	St
1.30.3	In the past i always ended up just buying a new machine .	St
1.30.4	I think i was averaging about 3-5 years per machine .	St
1.30.5	But in december of 2003 i did n't want to drop another thousand and purchase a whole new system .	St
1.30.6	I just wanted to upgrade one part .	St
1.30.7	Unfortunately on many entry priced systems the configuration is fairly limited in upgrade paths .	St
1.30.8	So i sat about building my own system .	St
1.30.9	It 's really not that complicated and you can save a bundle of money not to mention having total control over what components go in your system .	St
1.30.10	Many manufactures keep their price points low by offering cheaply priced components in their systems .	St
1.30.11	For me , i will not be soon going back to buy another & quot ; system & quot ; when i can build one better and cheaper .	St
1.30.12	While i understand that for the majority of computer users building their own sounds intimidating and maybe even a little ridiculous , in your post you mentioned that you 've already worked on repairing your own laptop , so maybe this would be a good time to try something different .	St
1.30.13	A website that i found extremely encouraging and helpful was : http : //www.mysuperpc.com/ Their are dozens of others but i refered to this website alot .	St
1.30.14	Just to get an idea of the how much you can save compare the cost of just a hard drive from either newegg.com or mwave.com to compusa or worst yet Best Buy .	St
1.30.15	One last thing , have you noticed how when you buy a new computer they list the specifications ( i.e 150 gig hard drive ) but rarely the brand ?	Ques
1.30.16	And when you look at computer component reviews its always by brand .	St
1.30.17	Side note : my last mass produced computer system was a dell .	St
1.30.18	Dell designed their system to accomodate one and only hard drive .	St
1.30.19	When i wanted to upgrade the system with a larger hard drive their solution was that i would need to purchase from them a & quot ; special & quot ; bracket that cost about 40 bucks .	St
1.30.20	Keep in mind such a bracket is unecessary as most cases come with drive brackets already and its just a matter of sliding the hard drive into another slot .	St
1.31.1	Based on my recent buying experience , I am very , very , very happy with Dell .	St
1.31.2	Found the best price ( although to be fair most compatable systems were within $ 20- $ 40 , not like I save $ 150 or anything by going with them ) BUT the biggest thing I liked was the ease of the web site to build my OWN configuration , the 100 possible options , the friendly ( yes friendly ) sales folks and ESPECIALLY the speed to get the system .	St
1.31.3	I actually placed the order Tuesday night 8:10pm .	St
1.31.4	Now remember I did a custom job where I picked the HD , Ram , dirves etc .	St
1.31.5	Anyway , it came to my door on Froday afternoon .	St
1.31.6	They built it Wednesday and shipped it that evening .	St
1.31.7	Anyway , Dell gets high marks from me for now .	St
1.31.8	PS Hint - If there is one componant you need but not another ( for example , you need a printer but laready have a good monitor and do n't need one ) watch the site carefully over a course of a few days or more .	St
1.31.9	they are always moving around their sales , sometimes daily , and one day the printer may be $ 50 and the next day they are giving it away for free .	St
1.31.10	I have posted other notes as well about this purchase if you want to search - but basically got P4 530 , 512 mb ram , 80 gb hd , monitor and printer $ 465 with shipping ( free ) and tax .	St
1.31.11	Main thing I saved on was I did not need the DVD player or DVD Burner , so thaty helped keep it below $ 500 , but still a great deal and you add those as well .	St
1.31.12	Anyway , Dell is a great choice IMO	St
1.32.1	This machine is a great buy , but I was put off when my local Best Buy discouraged me from buying .	St
1.32.2	They had an unusually high number of repairs to the HDD and I was the one who posted about that concern .	St
1.32.3	The socket 939 mobo will take an SATA HDD , but it comes equipd with an ancient ATA100 ( IDE ) 2mb cache 160 gig drive !	St
1.32.4	Why ? !	Ques
1.32.5	Price , of course .	St
1.32.6	When I check HDD prices there is only aout $ 20 difference between an IDE drive and a SATA drive .	St
1.32.7	Logic says eMachines would have used the SATA .	St
1.32.8	It seems ( a guess ) that they must have had older drives in inventory and & quot ; dumped & quot ; them into this otherwise great for the money machine .	St
1.32.9	I am still going to buy one within the next month , but I am buying a Maxtor 160gig SATA drive to replace the IDE drive .	St
1.32.10	The price of the T6212 plus the new HDD still beats anything else I have found : )	St
1.33.1	In response to your concern with T6212 HDD..what does HDD mean ( such a novice sorry ) I plan on purchasing this item this weekend but am concerned with the problem ... how do I alleviate this situation when purchasing the computer ?	Ques
1.33.2	Do the newer ones not have this problem ?	Ques
1.33.3	Any suggestions as to the best place to buy this desktop ?	Ques
1.33.4	Ca n't seem to find any good deals !	St
1.34.1	HDD simply is short for hard drive just as mobo is short for motherboard and OS is short for operating system .	St
1.34.2	Have a great day : )	Polite
1.35.1	The HP SR1010Z is a socket 754 mobo while the eMachines T6212 is socket 939 .	St
1.35.2	The HP has an 8 X AGP slot while the eMachine has PCI Express X 16 .	St
1.35.3	The 939 supports dual channel memory while the 754 does not .	St
1.35.4	I think the eMachine T6212 is more advanced than the HP SR1010Z though I do not like the ATA HDD when it is designed for SATA : )	St
1.36.1	I have seen a lot of posts that mentioned Socket 939 , but had no idea why that was an adavantage until you just posted the reason , so thanks .	St
1.36.2	BUT then my question now is what is dual channel memeory ?	Ques
1.36.3	Is that the same as having more than 2 slots available for memory cards ?	Ques
1.36.4	Example I bought a Dell 3000 that only has 2 slots , so if I want to & quot ; upgrade & quot ; I have to toss my old and buy new biger memory cards ( I assume ) .	St
1.36.5	But the 4700 has 4 slots , so I could add 2 new cards in addition to what I have now .	St
1.36.6	I will not need to upgrade ( I have 512 and that is more than enough for the uses I have for the PC ) so it is not a concern to me BUT in the future I may be buying a pc for me that I will want options .	St
1.36.7	Anyway , what is dual channel memory , and is that really the advantage of the socket 939 ?	Ques
