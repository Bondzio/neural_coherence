<s> Hi, When it comes to buying external enclosure(for extra HDs) should I be looking for something with cooling fan built in or should I buy something such as Mad Dog enclosure that claims ''Aluminum Housing for Optimal Heat Dissipation'' etc etc? </s>
<s> Please help!! </s>
<s> Oh! </s>
<s> .... </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance guys! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Recommend searching thru and reading the posts here as your question and others like it have been asked and answered numerous times. </s>
<s> You'll also see what to avoid. </s>
<s> Bottomline, you can buy pre-built, prepackaged external HDDs with 1 year warranty or select separates of your choice. </s>
<s> The advantage to the latter is you choose the quality and characteristics of the components, both the enclosure and the hard drive. </s>
<s> The Adaptec ACS-100 is my choice as it handles HDDs up to 1,000GBs, has a one year warranty and is USB 2.0. </s>
<s> The HDD I chose is a 320GB hard drive, the WD3200SB, has a 5 year warranty. </s>
<s> I just installed the WD3200SB HDD in the Adaptec ACS-100 and it was as easy and uneventful as when I put a 160GB Maxtor in another ACS-100. </s>
<s> Good Luck on your search. </s>

<s> Thank you very much,VAPCMD. </s>
<s> That Adaptec looks totally awesome. </s>
<s> So I am guessing cool fan isn't all that important as long as the unit has that '' Heat Dissipation'' feature, correct? </s>
<s> You're Welcome The Adaptec enclosures seem to dissipate heat well ... so while a fan might help...they don't appear to be necessary. </s>
<s> The key is the enclosure is well constructed, it lets you see and use the entire drive capacity (which many enclosure don't) and it's comptable the systems you connect it to. </s>
<s> The specs on many enclosures don't even address the maximum drive capacity in GBs. </s>
<s> Based on the posts I see here..there seem to be an unusually high number of Maxtor externals failing. </s>
<s> Can't tell from the posts whether it's the drives or the enclosures themselves failing. </s>
<s> It certainly pays to handle them with care. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> the customer comments on amazon say that the enclosure does not work with win2k. </s>
<s> Has anybody experience this? </s>
<s> Do you know a fix? </s>
<s> As I use such things with Windows 2000 SP4. </s>
<s> I use Win2K on my home PC and at work. </s>
<s> I've got 3 Adaptec enclosures: one ACS-100 with a 200GB Seagate the other with a 320GB Western Digital and an ACS-120 with a 2.5&quot; 100GB Seagate. </s>
<s> I've had execellent results with the Adaptec ACS-100 as well as the ACS-120 and they handle hard disk drives up to 1,000GBs. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I purchased an acs-100 and installed my hard drive. </s>
<s> On my win2k SP4 machine, I can turn on the hard drive and windows automatically detects external drive as a 'USB External Storage Device.' </s>
<s> When I try to 'stop' the drive to do a safe disconnect/unplug, I select 'USB External Storage Device' and click the 'stop' button. </s>
<s> Then windows immediately restarts! </s>
<s> I tried the drive with my new winXP machine. </s>
<s> The drive is recognized my windows once I turn on the drive. </s>
<s> When I go to safe disconnect/unplug, windows says, 'the device is sitll in use.' </s>
<s> However, I have closed every window and application that I know of. </s>
<s> Any ideas why I am getting this weirdness? </s>
<s> Any ideas where I can turn? </s>
<s> I emailed adaptec customer support and they said that they do not provide tech support for that product only a hardware replacement. </s>
<s> I do not think it is the hardware, I think that I am having problems similiar to those list on amazon.com: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007M3PGC/002-6292154-7416067?v=glance&n=172282 I do not have another external drive to test if it is the drive or if it is a windows problem. </s>
<s> Please help, I'd appreciate any advice </s>
<s> I usually find an incomplete Windows install. </s>
<s> Many relied on Microsoft for drivers for the machine. </s>
<s> But since not a word about the machine, this discussion suffers an early end. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Do you think it is my machine? </s>
<s> Or an incomplete windows installation? </s>
<s> Both machines are dell computers. </s>
<s> The win2k machine I reformatted the disk and installed win 2k. </s>
<s> The winXP machine is new from dell, dell did the install. </s>
<s> I used the micrsoft drivers that windows suggested to pull down from the web. </s>
<s> Was that a mistake? </s>
<s> I'm happy to give more information if it helps; I would just like to diagnose the problem, but I am unable to myself. </s>

<s> Microsoft helps by getting the OS on it's feet. </s>
<s> We finish it off. </s>
<s> Given so little information about the non-working machine, I can't help yet. </s>
<s> I wonder if it has USB 2.0 ports or if Windows 2000 has all it's patches. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My windows 2000 machine had service pack 1, I upgraded to service pack 4 just before I hooked up my external hd. </s>
<s> I downloaded the service pack from windows website. </s>
<s> Are there other patches that I need to install? </s>
<s> Is there an easy way to find the correct patch that I need? </s>
<s> The machine came with 2 usb1.1 ports but I recently installed a usb2.0 pci card to take advantage of my new drive's usb2.0 connectivity. </s>
<s> I will try hooking the external hd to a usb1.1 drive. </s>
<s> As for the windows XP machine, it only has usb2.0 ports. </s>
<s> I did windows update a few days before I hooked up my external hd. </s>
<s> However, windows still says the device is in use or busy when I try to disconnect it. </s>
<s> What information would help diagnose my problem? </s>
<s> I thank you so much for your help and patience. </s>
<s> http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Filemon.html It can show what programs access what files (if any) on the removable drive. </s>
<s> It might help to have such info. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I noted that the Windows 2000 machine... You might share make, model, what type of USB ports and what drivers you installed after what Microsoft provided. </s>
<s> If the ports are only USB 1.1, try an USB 2.0 PCI card. </s>
<s> Some drives do exactly what you noted on USB 1.1 ports. </s>
<s> Why not tell all? </s>
