I would like to know if contrast ratios and response times are important. And if they are, what should their values be? I am looking to buy a BenQ FP937s 19&quot; LCD, 12ms Response Time, 500:1 Contrast Ratio, 250 Nits Brightness. Is that a good choice? I will be using the monitor for basic computer use, (web surfing, watching DVD's, word processing, etc.) and some light gaming, (Half Life, Counterstrike, etc.)

[is half-life considered &quot;Light&quot; gaming???] But the writeups that I have seen on many of the fast response ones suffered in color and text quality compared to their old 25 MS brothers. Maximum PC magazine about 3 issues ago finally found a few that they considered acceptable for gaming. But they didn't rave about any of them. IMHO ,make certain that the one you get is the second generation version of the fast speed ones from the mfr's that you choose. Seems that in the rush to get fast speed they may not have checked the other parameters that well in their first releases.
