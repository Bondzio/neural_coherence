when i play games like battlefield or rome total war or any application mostly.
i will be playing or working and then my whole pc shuts down and reboots.
i thought it may have been a power problem but i had a 350 and changed it to 480 and still the problem continues.
is it maybe a hard drive issue or a heat issue.
2.53 pentium windows xp 1gb 2100 ram 7 fans 480w power radeon 9800pro 128mb 80 gb hard drive ( 60gb empty) i checked bios and the it said that cpu heat - 48c pc heat - 28c
