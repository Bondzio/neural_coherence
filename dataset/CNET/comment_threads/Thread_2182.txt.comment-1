Hi all.
I have 2 x 1GB of Patriot DDR3 1333 RAM, and 2 x 1GB of Corsair DDR3 1333 RAM.
My motherboard (ASUS P5E3 WS Professional) has the latest BIOS, and I'm running 64-bit Vista Ultimate.
Both of these dual channel memory modules work fine as a pair.
However, when I try to have both pairs running for a total of 4 GB, Windows won't boot.
Are there any steps I could take to get these modules to work together, or should I RMA one?
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks
