Hello, I'm looking design student looking for a printer, and we often print in sizes only a little bigger than standard letter paper (such as 11x17 tabloid). I currently have a basic HP All-in-One printer, but I'm looking to upgrade to a larger one that prints 11x17. So then I'm looking for a printer that can print formats as large as 11x17 (larger isn't necessary), and that still has a flatbed scanner/copier (fax not necessary). Does this even exist?

Here's a link to a page on their website showing the specials: http://www.brothermall.com/promotions/?PType=Rebate&amp;pGrp=5 Both the MFC-J6510DW and MFC-J6710DW would meet your requirements, and at a considerably cheaper price than the wide-format MFP that Brechan linked to. If you're still looking for a wide-format MFP, both models sound like they'd be well worth considering.

At those prices, OP may well have still been looking for a less-expensive alternative, such as what I linked to ($179-$229 on sale). A $1,500+ printer would perhaps be within the budget of the university design department of OP, but NOT within the budget of a design student, as OP described himself/herself.
