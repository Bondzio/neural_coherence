<s> I'm wiring our new Fire Station and need some insight. </s>
<s> I will start with a brief overview of our network: Cable router to netgear wireless router to (4) wired connections. </s>
<s> The problem I'm having is with the Levitron Keystore jacks for cat5e. </s>
<s> I have wired these in 568B format. </s>
<s> The wiring was installed by the contractor. </s>
<s> All lines terminate in a closet along with telephone and cable. </s>
<s> The ends of the cat5 in the closet I have terminated with male plugs to connect to the Netgear router. </s>
<s> The other ends are in varies wall plugs in the building. </s>
<s> I connected (2) yesterday according to the label for 568B. </s>
<s> I can't connect on either of these plugs. </s>
<s> I have also wired them in 568A and Crossover just to try. </s>
<s> I removed one of the keystones and put a male plug on to test connection. </s>
<s> This worked without an issue. </s>
<s> I have tried (3) plugs out of the package of (10). </s>
<s> I'm only removing the outer sheath, untisting 1/2&quot;, leaving the individual wire sheathing, and using a 110 punch tool to install in the keystone. </s>
<s> I'm sorry this is long winded but I wanted to try to answer any basic questions up front. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea what the issue could be? </s>
<s> I find the colors reversed on those... see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIA-568B again. </s>
<s> Thanks I'll check that. </s>
<s> I know it has to be something simple. </s>
<s> I had been wiring all day when this issue came up and I chose to walk away as I was getting fustrated. </s>
<s> You may very well be right about that. </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick reply. </s>
