7287	0	21460	231914	NR	Charlie Thunell PL&T	5/1/04 3:15 AM	1.0833813E12	Cooling...	I have an Intel 2.6Ghz which is working very well. My temperature is ok but I still want it to be cooler. It is always displaying 42 C and I would like to lower it. I have not OC'd it. I know that 42 C isn't a big deal, but I would like to have a more efficient fan/HS anyway. I have three case fans (two exhaust fans in the back and one sucking air into the case on the side of the same). Does anyone know about a top of the line fan for my processor in order to keep it even cooler? I want a better fan/heatsink (NOT the thermal paste since I think that means that you can't get the HS/Fan off anymore) for top $50. Thank you.

Charlie when you remove heat sink to put on a better one with larger fan/heat sink, the paste isn't a glue. you have to i repeat have to use it to make contact. make sure you remove old and use a quality paste. in the shop i work in i use Arctic silver a very thin coating on the heat sink the size of the chip i all thats needed
