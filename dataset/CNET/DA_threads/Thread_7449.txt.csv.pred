1.2.1	http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586_7-0.html?forumID=68&messageID=1809701&threadID=162790	St
1.3.1	I decided that I wanted a duel core.	St
1.3.2	I fell that I will get more time out of it.	St
1.3.3	I usually like about 3 years out of a new machine.	St
1.3.4	Then, I decided my video card the ati 9600xt is really a good card and there is no reason to get a pci express card so I chose a motherboard with both pci express and with agp.	St
1.3.5	I want to continue to use most of my existing dell for my kids so I am going to purchase new drives.	St
1.3.6	I have a hard drive and memory alrady.	St
1.3.7	Before I push the button is this the best setup?	St
1.4.1	If possible get a case without a power supply and put a higher wattage quality power supply in it.	St
1.4.2	I like the Aspire cases with the top exhaust [have used three of them].	St
1.4.3	With side intake and added rear exhaust never a cooling problem.	St
1.4.4	Unfortunately I don't think that they offer them sans power supply.	St
