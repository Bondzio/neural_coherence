well i've got it installed but i have a couple more questions.
the keyboard issue came back to haunt me.
i can't access the cmos thing to check the bios so i wasn't able to switch it to nfts.
any way around this other than buying a different cheap keyboard?
for now i simply booted from the main drive and did run--&gt;compmgmt.csm.
the drive showed up but said it onle had 111gb free.
it is a 120gb western digital hard drive.
i seem to remember bob telling someone that it may be because its using a fat 32 setup.
is this right?
one more problem; the screw holes on the hard drive itself do not match up with the screw holes on my case.
is this a big issue?
other than those things, everything seems to be fine.
i appreciate all the help.
now i just need a tad bit more .
