<s> So i recently set up a netgear n router for my home and I am now experiencing problems with the wireless network. </s>
<s> The main computer (Gateway-Windows XP)located in a different room and connected using a netgear wireless card seems to be receiving the signal fine at all times. </s>
<s> However a new Sony Vaio Laptop(Windows Vista), Macbook Pro as well as a Dell Inspiron Laptop all (Windows XP) seem to lose the ability to access the internet. </s>
<s> The router shows connectivity to all of the laptops but the internet just does not seem to work. </s>
<s> As for the main pc, the internet always seems to be working. </s>
<s> Any help or tips would be greatly apreciated........... </s>
<s> did you setup the Netgear router like the b] Forum Sticky suggests? </s>

<s> I had a friend set up the router who is geek squad-ish but he must have screwed something up. </s>
<s> Whichpart of sticky b should i be looking at? </s>
<s> Update the firmware in your wireless router. </s>
<s> Manufacturer's website, make & Model needed. </s>
<s> Broadcast SSID(You may want to change this to make it easier to connect) Use WPA-PSK(TKIP) Security. </s>
<s> Most wireless devices work best with this type of security. </s>
<s> Mixed b and g mode(n if available) Use channels 1, 6 or 11. </s>
<s> Most devices work better on these channels. </s>
<s> Save and exit. </s>
<s> Power everything off for 30 seconds. </s>
<s> Power everything back on, wait 30 seconds,now try to connect. </s>
