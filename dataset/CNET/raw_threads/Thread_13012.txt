I have a D-Link DIR-450 wireless router that I am using to &quot;attempt&quot; to set up a wireless network in my home. I have a desktop that is hooked up with a cat-5 cable and am having no issues there. The Verizon broadband card is a little slow, but hey, that's Verizon for you. The issue is with the laptop... I am trying to set it up wireless, but can only seem to be able to do this WITHOUT any encryption. The second I try to secure the router, the Gateway MX6453 laptop is permanently &quot;Acquiring Network Address.&quot; I have made sure I am using the correct passphrase, WEP key, etc. No kind of encryption will work. This does not put the warm fuzzies in my tummy... The wireless card in the laptop is a Broadcon802.11g network adapter. Help. Steve

Right now, no encryption, I have a valid SSID, Channel scan enabled, Super G disabled (tried different configs here, to no effect), Hidden Wireless is Disabled. I have DHCP enabled with the proper Mac address and name of the laptop setup in the router. I did nothing to &quot;Virtual server,&quot; &quot;Port Forwarding,&quot; &quot;Application Rules,&quot; or &quot;Network Filter.&quot; I am Confused...

Proffitt	10/13/07 3:25 PM	1.1922891E12	Then as presented, ALL PROPER.	&quot;Right now, no encryption, I have a valid SSID, Channel scan enabled&quot; When the router is setup like that and you change the laptop to WPA then it shouldn't connect. In short, the two must match. Bob
