1.2.1	here : http : //www.apple.com/macbook/design.html There is a DVI output port .	St
1.2.2	From Apple , you can get http : //store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID ? mco=75A42EE8 & nplm=M9319G % 2FA which allows and RCA ( yellow-video equivalent ) or S-Video connection out to a TV/monitor ... http : //store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID ? mco=6C04E07A & nplm=M9321G % 2FB which allows you to connect a DVI cable - if your monitor/TV can use that connection ... http : //store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID ? mco=6C04E099 & nplm=M9320G % 2FA which allows a VGA connection more commonly found on computer monitors but finding its way onto many of the better flat-screen LCD and plasma panels .
