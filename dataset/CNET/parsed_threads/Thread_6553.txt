<s> So, my printer just went out on me, and I really became dependent on my all-in-one, but if I'm gonna put out the money on a new one I would love to get one that will print directly onto my cd's and dvd's. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of an all-in-one with disc printing? </s>
<s> Haven't seen one of those. </s>
<s> Printers print to paper. </s>
<s> There are new burners that will print to the CD. </s>
<s> Epson has three models I know of, ranging from $100 to about $400 (the latter also being a quality photo printer), but none of them are all-in-ones. </s>
<s> I know of no other paper/disk printers at this time. </s>
<s> You must realize that these will not print to ordinary disks, but only those with a special surface to receive and retain the ink. </s>
<s> Hope this helps Frank </s>
