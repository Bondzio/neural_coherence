Maybe the cpu shut down temperature in your bios is set to low?
These specific cpus I know for a fact can run around 60-70c with no problems.
So if for say your shutdown temperature is set at 65c and shuts itself down the cpu wouldnt have the chance to reach 70c although it will most likely not damage the cpu itself.
