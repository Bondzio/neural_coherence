I have set the first boot device as the USB drive and have tried to boot Hiren's Boot Disk.
But when I boot it went to the American Megatrends Screen which said: AMIBIOS (C) 2008 American Megatrends, Inc. BIOS Date: 01/25/10 11:43:05 Ver: 5UKT17AUS CPU : Intel (R) Core(TM) 2 Duo CPU T6600 2.20GHz Speed : 2.20 GHz Press F1 to run Setup Press F12 for BBS POPUP Initializing USB Controllers .
.
Done.
4096MB OK USB Device(s): 2 Keyboards, 1 Mouse, 1 Hub, 1 Storage Device Auto-Detecting AHCI PORT 0..IDE Hrd Disk SATA Port0 ST9500325AS 0010 S.M.A.R.T.
Capable and Status BAD Auto-Detecting USB Mass Storage Devices .. Device #01: TSSTcorp CDDVDW *hispeed* AHCI Port0 Device Error Press F1 to Resume When I pressed F12, it said that bbs popup selected but remained like that and when I disabled SATA controller in the setup, it did boot but could not detect the HDD.
I have tried removing the drives but there are problem with the screws and also is it a risk to do it?
