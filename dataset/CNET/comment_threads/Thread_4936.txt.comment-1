I just got a new computer and my roommate has another computer.
I had to set the new computer up last night when I go to my network to manage it the network is in my roommates name now and it says I have not been invited to manage the network.
How does he do that?
I have HP Vista, he has a Dell XP.
We both are using McAfee and that program is telling me I have to get his permission.
I do not know how the network is in his name now and why I have to be invited to manage it.
Thanks in advance.
