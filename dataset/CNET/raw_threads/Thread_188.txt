4968	0	398809	3326934	NR	vector03	6/23/10 8:57 AM	1.27728342E12	No wireless/wired net access	I've been using wireless internet for months with my new computer which has Windows 7 64-bit. Today I disabled the wireless security for a bit, then tried to enable it, now I can't connect to anything. The problems are: 'The DNS server isn't responding' and 'Local Area Connection doesn't have a valid IP config'. My wireless icon keeps switching between a yellow exclamation point icon and a circular blue loading icon. It says it's connected but I cannot browse the net, I can access my router information though. My router/modem are definitely on and connected. I've done many power cycles on those and my computer. My modem is Comcast and my router is a Netgear WPN824 V2. The router has the most recent firmware. Here is my ipconfig data: Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600] Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

It almost has to be a problem stemming from a large electrical storm that happened yesterday, which I'm certain damaged my previous router, which I've since replaced with a new WNR2000. The old router and surge protector is gone, but I still cannot connect via wired or wireless. Perhaps this sheds more light on the problem.
