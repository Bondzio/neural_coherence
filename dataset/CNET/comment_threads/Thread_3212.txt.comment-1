Its my first build in awhile and im looking for some help.
I got an asus mobo with an onboard sis 180 controller and a samsung 120gb sp1213c sata hdd.
i plan on it being the only hdd.
Anyway, i tried to have cmos autodetect the drive like the install instructions said but that failed.
Continued to the sata menu where it did detect the drive there.
However when i continued to try and install xp on the drive it said no hd was detected.
Thats a quick summary of where im at now and im at a loss.
Its been some time since doing something like this, so any help on what im forgetting is much appreciated.
