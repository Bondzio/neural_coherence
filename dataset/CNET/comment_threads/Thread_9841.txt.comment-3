What you're trying to do is make a NAS setup and that won't happen with a non-NAS ext.
HD.
You are going to need a small network setup where the HD is attached to one system and the under the network become a &quot;shared resource&quot; for that network.
If you plan to use multiple ports from that ext.
HD to attach to separate systems, no workee or expect problems.
