<s> I've been doing some fairly heavy-duty scanning in recent days with my Canon MP830 multifunction printer/scanner. </s>
<s> Suddenly, whenever I use the auto-document feeder, it scans in a thin line running the full length of the document, from top to bottom about 1/4 of the document in from the left margin. </s>
<s> The line appears blue in a color document, and also appears in black and white scans. </s>
<s> Interestingly, the line only appears on scans using the ADF. </s>
<s> When I put the document directly on the platen glass, there is no line. </s>
<s> And the paper document itself comes out of the process without any issues, so it's not as if the ADF or scanning process is somehow leaving a mark on the paper document which is being scanned in. </s>
<s> I'm stumped. </s>
<s> The only thing I can figure is that one of the thin wires that the scanner bulb moves back and forth on is somehow getting scanned in. </s>
<s> But I have no idea. </s>
<s> Anyone experienced something like this? </s>
<s> I figured it out. </s>
<s> The problem was one tiny speck on the platen glass that is used during the ADF scanning process. </s>
<s> Somehow in all the cleaning I did, I missed this spot and had to be at just the right angle to see it. </s>
<s> This worked for me! </s>
