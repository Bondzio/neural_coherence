after doing some more google searching and reading some post from other people with this porblem on the quake tech website (who would have known) i found some post with the same problem and they said that the game needs at least 512mbs of gpu ram to run in ultra so just now i went back and turned settings on high to see if it work and it did.
so i guess ill just have to go get another card for sli thanks anyways guys, nick
