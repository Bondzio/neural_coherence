<s> I had a bad virus in my comp. </s>
<s> so I did a clean install using a new XP SP2 cd, not HP recovery cd's. </s>
<s> Everything works fine now, Video, Ethernet, Sound, USB (front and back). </s>
<s> But when I go into my device manager I have a yellow question mark on &quot;Unknown device / PCI Standard ISA Bridge, Driver not installed&quot;. </s>
<s> I have been searching high and low all over the net for 3 day's trying to find the correct driver needed. </s>
<s> I have updated all my chipset with latest ATI and HP drivers, Windows Update is up-todate. </s>
<s> I have used the Unknown Device program to help find the correct driver but none on them have worked? </s>
<s> I would preferr not using a Driver Robot partially because they charge and have used in the past and have not had good results. </s>
<s> I have also tried uninstalling device and rebooting, still shows up. </s>
<s> And I have not installed any other hardware. </s>
<s> I have also searched this site looking for answers and tried a few drivers in downloads but cant seem to find exactly what I am looking for. </s>
<s> Since everything is working properly do I even need a driver for this and can I just disable it? </s>
<s> I'm a little stumpted here on what to do? </s>
<s> Compaq Presario SR2011WM Device Instance ID: ACPI\AWY0001\4&1EC577C0&0 Thanks in advance, </s>
<s> If you used anything other than HP's drivers... </s>
<s> Try only those at http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList?os=228&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&product=3292424&lang=en# </s>
<s> And they did not work either, That was one of the first things I tried was the compaq site. </s>
<s> Tried the ones there and on HP site. </s>
<s> Here's an example chat -&gt; http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?threadID=271360#2699006 It's not your model but sadly HP hides some drivers up on FTP servers that you only find if you ask them. </s>
<s> Did you notice that install order matters? </s>
<s> If you do it in the wrong order, weirdness. </s>

<s> Bob: Thanks for your reply, I did also try that yesterday and it was taking forever about an hour 1/2 waiting and I finally got to chat with someone he ended up wanting me to chat with him thru another computer so we could look into the Bios. </s>
<s> I didnt have another computer so that was kind of a fail. </s>
<s> Guess I need to borrow someones laptop and attempt it again. </s>
<s> I might take a look at what you suggested about installing in order, I was unaware of that. </s>
<s> This is a shot in the dark but, a relative has the same exact computer as mine. </s>
<s> What if I was to make a set of restore cd's and tried to load them into my computer using my XP serial number?? </s>
<s> Maybe? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> recovery CD's of your own as you used a new XP install, you could try DriverMax. </s>
<s> Run it on the relative's computer to back up the drivers to a CD and then redo the install for your computer using the DriverMax CD to install all your drivers, after the XP install is completed. </s>
<s> It may be possible to use the relative's restore CD's from HP but don't count on it. </s>
<s> The other alternative is to buy a set of Recovery CD's from HP for your computer. </s>
<s> They are normally $25 - $30. </s>
<s> Why cant there be just a quick easy fix?? </s>
<s> Guess this makes for a good learning experience. </s>
<s> I'm going to try to give HP a call today and see if they can help me out. </s>
<s> If not I will try to use the Drivermax sugesstion, that actually sounds like it may work! </s>
<s> I appreciate all your guys help and ideas. </s>
<s> If you have any more I'm all ears. </s>
<s> Happen If I just left it the way it was?? </s>
<s> What does the PCI Standard ISA Bridge do? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> You have to take a small class in Intel architecture but the ISA bus is rather outdated and rarely seen anymore. </s>
<s> What was on the ISA bus were items like serial and parallel ports. </s>
<s> But if those work then there is little reason to fix this. </s>
