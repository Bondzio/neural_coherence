1.1.1	There are 3 display options for my monitor: 1:1, Aspect and Full.	St
1.1.2	I have a 24 inch BenQ monitor with a 1920 x 1200 native resolution.	St
1.1.3	When using my monitor for my computer, nothing changes when I switch between these 3 options and I'm not too concerned about when I use my computer on the monitor anyway.	St
1.1.4	I have Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles hooked up to the monitor via HDMI cables and these 3 options result in 3 different results and I'm not sure which to use: 1) 1:1 makes the image a small but crisp box inside the monitor (about half of the total monitor screen is used).	St
1.1.5	2) Aspect creates small horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of the screen (i.e.	St
1.1.6	letterbox / widescreen look) 3) Full fills the whole screen up I don't car for 1:1 mode because it only uses half the monitor real estate.	St
1.1.7	My guess is that Aspect (with the bars on the top and bottom) is the nature regular look and Full stretches the picture up and down a bit to get rid of the bars to fill the screen.	St
1.1.8	I can't notice any distortion in Full mode (but this is probably just because the bars in Aspect aren't to big so there isn't much distortion to stretch the screen to Full).	St
1.1.9	If this is correct, I think I will stick with Aspect mode as I don't want any distortion/stretching.	St
1.1.10	Is this correct and what mode should I use?	St
1.1.11	Thanks for any help.	Polite
1.2.1	You've already answered your own question in raw results.	St
1.2.2	You understand what these options ply to your current setup.	St
1.2.3	Now, pick one that makes you happy.	St
1.2.4	Then understand should your needs change or setup differ later you have the flexibility/capability to adapt to that.	St
1.2.5	enjoy tada -----Willy	Polite
1.3.1	the reason it's half the size is because the video resolution of what you saw was 1/2 of the natural screen resolution.	St
1.3.2	But if you were to watch a 1080P video, then it would've been full screen (or very close to it).	St
1.3.3	Yes I think aspect is a good choice.	Polite
