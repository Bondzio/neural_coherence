i wasn't flaming, just explaining my point.
i agree about overclocking but my system has a very slight overclock with no voltage change and only slight clock changes on a cpu that is part of the k family.
meaning unlocked multipliers, meaning much further overclocking.
considering this the clock on my cores is extremely moderate.
and i never stress the machine.
so how exactly have i been pushing my machine then?
also the psu wattage is far higher than the full draw of my machine.
i don't mind criticism as long as its constructive.
