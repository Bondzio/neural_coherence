I have learned to bide my time on such things.
I have already put aside any idea of upgrading any machines that we don't have to in anticipation of the changeover.
I already see the price plummeting over the past month and XP-64 may not be what we'll be installing for these workstations.
In the case of the next setups, it's Open Office and some development work in C++.
Since it will run Windows 2000, we can do that with a dual boot to some Linux-64.
