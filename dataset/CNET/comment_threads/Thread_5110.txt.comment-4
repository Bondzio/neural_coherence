Hello Everyone Actually we should completely shutdown the system if we don't have to use it, for longer time.
because the hibernate option put effect on your memory i.e.
RAM because every system program has to be saved in the running mode.
This think on one side have advantage for memory also have one disadvantage for system which is we have to boot it when we want to use it.
On the other hand if you are not using system but for shorter time period we should hibernate because it will save the boot time of the system.
