we are a two person non-profit office needing to get new hardware.
we were going to buy towers and a server but i am hearing conflicting info about what we really need.
i am not sure we want to host our emails, fire wall and domain because i now nada about that so if something failed i would have to call someone for support.
so now i am doing research on nas and file servers.
we do all of our website maintenance, collateral material and artwork.
we don't necessarily need to access (ms exchange) our computers away from the office (other software out there than can do that).
can someone tell me the pros and cons of server vs nas for a small business?
thank you.
