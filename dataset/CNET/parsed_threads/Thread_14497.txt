<s> I may need to replace a cooling fan on my computer but I have no clue what type of fan I need to get. </s>
<s> I know it is the processor fan and I got the part number off the fan but I can not seem to find that same fan. </s>
<s> I am not at all a computer wiz, but I am learning. </s>
<s> How do you tell what type of fan fits your computer? </s>
<s> I have a V2 premier Pentium 4 Proc. </s>
<s> 3.0ghz AN810[E] Motherboard The cooling fan is: Foxconn dc brushless fan Model#PV702012M I hope I have given all the important info not sure what else to give. </s>
<s> Thank you everyone for your time </s>
<s> fan for your CPU. </s>
<s> I didn't have any luck finding the FAN you specified thru google and Intel uses many different fan configurations on their CPUs. </s>
<s> There are lots of places that sell the ... Newegg.com carries a bunch of them and they describe them well. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> While you can replace the fan itself and do just fine, it appears you're clueless as to what to get. </s>
<s> The fan itself is measured in &quot;mm&quot; so likely you want a 60mm or 80mm fan, but again I don't what you have regardless of the info you found on your fan. </s>
<s> But, if you choose to, look at: http://www.frozencpu.com/ or similar websites. </s>
<s> Inquire the vendor if any fan or HSF you do get is suited for your needs and any return policy(surf abit). </s>
<s> However, you'll do better getting a HSF(heatsink-fan setup) that is *RATED* for your cpu/processor installed. </s>
<s> So, if you have a 2.8Mhz cpu, get a HSF that's rated for 2.8Mhz or better and physically fits the location(in system) as some HSF are huge and maybe limited space to install or very tight fit. </s>
<s> Check this website for what to expect: http://www.tomshardware.com and locate info. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Remove the fan.....not the heat sink. </s>
<s> With fan in hand....visit your local mom+pop pc repair shop. </s>
<s> Place fan on counter and say&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I want one of these. </s>
<s> With a little luck they will have something on the shelf that will work fine. </s>
