I have added the HDD to the cable which is used to connect to the CD ROM. I enabled the HDD in Bios. But still not able to detect in WinXP. There are three setup available in the jumper. 1. Master/Slave 2. Cable Select 3. Limits drive capacity I tried all three but still no success. Any pointer would be of helpful.

Sometimes new hard drives or hard drives formatted in another OS (Linux, etc.) will not show in My Computer, but they will show in Disk Management.

Use the create option, format, check disk, make active (or not- that's a whole other set of questions to be debated), then shut down, reconnect the Sata booting drive, during boot press whatever key to get to setup menu (Del, or F2, or F1, whatever) verify the first hard drive in boot sequence is the sata drive, let the computer boot, most likely the drive will appear as &quot;E&quot; (If all you have is the Sata C drive, an optical drive, and your new one. If it's still not showing, go to diak management and look for it, assign it a letter, change the path, whatever. Inside XP booted you can then be sure the formatted file system is what you wanted (NTFS or Fat32). bingo, you should be there.
