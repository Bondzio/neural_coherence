3284	0	225921	2360473	NR	iSamurai	12/30/06 6:32 PM	1.16750352E12	New P965 system not powering on	So I just finished building a Core 2 Duo PC for a friend, and now that everythings in and all, the power switch won't turn it on. For some reason the Power LED is on, though faint. I reconnected all the front panel stuff and made sure they were in the correct places but to no avail. Also, the mobo supports a 24-pin power, but I used a 20-pin. It said it could use 20-pin too. Also, the 12V connector had 8 slots but I used a P4 cable instead. These might be the problem, but I'm not sure.

The JPWR2(8pin) has a P4 12V (4pin) cable in the 4 slots that weren't originally covered up with a little plastic thingy. As for the molex, I stuck a molex into it from the PSU. Hope this is all right.

We have a firewire card in a PCI slot for fun Proc is a Core 2 Duo E6300 (1.86 Ghz, 1066 FSB) The memory is CORSAIR ValueSelect (2x512) DDR2. The PSU is 500W.
