<s> Did not change anything. </s>
<s> I do use MSI Afterburner and my temps never get higher than 70 running any game. </s>
<s> So temperature is not an issue. </s>
<s> Plus this happens the moment I get into the game, so there is a very small window for my GPU to reach overheated temps, which I don't think is happening. </s>
<s> I really can't find anyone else who has had this exact problem in my video before. </s>
<s> Highly frustrating! </s>
<s> Here is another video that shows the problem off better http://youtu.be/HStKCJ9xnDE It really seems like it is a graphics card problem but I can't be sure. </s>
<s> That's the issue with the PC. </s>
<s> As it stands you have to swap parts to figure it out about half the time. </s>
<s> This is one of those times. </s>
<s> There is one issue I encounter too often. </s>
<s> That is, those that overclock usually can't be helped. </s>
<s> It may upset a few but that's going out on a limb. </s>
<s> Few will join you. </s>
