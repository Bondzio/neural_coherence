When I checked my video drivers on my system it showed that they were operating properly.
I was able to ask my system to go to 256 colors but when I restarted my computer, it went back to 16 every time.
After talking to our IT server guy, I found our box of software and located the CD that had the original Video Drivers on it.
I installed it (it kept asking if I wanted to keep my current files...they were newer...I said yes each time until the process was complete).
After the install was complete it automatically restarted my computer and I was set up with 256 colors.
The last thing I did was go back into my display and change my screen area to 800x600 pixels.
Hope this helps.
