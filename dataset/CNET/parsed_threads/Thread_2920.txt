<s> I am not sure where to post this. </s>
<s> I am looking for IBM compatible PS2 type keyboard that uses 120mA power consumtion or less. </s>
<s> What is exactly is that type of keyboard. </s>
<s> I looked online to see if I could find one but nothing lists the power consumption. </s>
<s> Any help will be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> But no one specs that anymore so you'll have to measure a few to see what they do. </s>
<s> It's all of one measurement with an ammeter. </s>

<s> What a bummer So you are saying it is just hit and miss? </s>
<s> I will tell you what I am using it for, I have to enter disc info on my mega DVD player and it requires that type of keyboard I already have one for my computer and it doesn't work. </s>
<s> Let me ask you would the ones without all of the multimedia buttons be a good start to check? </s>
<s> That's a little clearer. </s>
<s> I wonder why you didn't share the make/model of this thing to start with. </s>
<s> You could have helped members help you without all the back and forths. </s>
<s> Yup, I'd try a &quot;plain&quot; keyboard. </s>

<s> Sorry but I thought I mentioned that because the keyboard that didn't work with my new Sony DVD player worked with my older Sony cd player and they both specified the same keyboard. </s>
<s> I was confused about that. </s>
<s> It was a important point. </s>
<s> A pre senior moment on my part. </s>
<s> It's one of those little bits of information that could have someone write they have it and use some specific keyboard. </s>
