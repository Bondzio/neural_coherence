1.3.1	If you 're a home use or small business it may fit the bill .	St
1.3.2	Do n't expect this printer to do too much as in printing reams of paper output .	St
1.3.3	It does well , but as stated to you , brother gets it 's hand again with toner costs .	St
1.3.4	This is common for low-end or less expensive printers .	St
1.3.5	Plus , the 1st initial toner provided , may just be a & quot ; starter & quot ; toner cart , so once gain it 'll be time to buy .	St
1.3.6	However , I consider this a good bargain , but it seems if you wait or look around , other laser printers as just as cheap or available .	St
1.3.7	It boils down to your needs as in what you expect from the printer , like connectivity , network , ease , costs , or paper selections , etc.. tada -- -- -Willy	St
