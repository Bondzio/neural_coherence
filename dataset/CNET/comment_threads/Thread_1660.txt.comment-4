I bought a T6212 yesterday and I am having the same problems.
I am unable to burn a recovery DVD (eMachines tech support has agreed to send me one), but I also cannot burn anything else on the DVD drive.
It plays DVD movies, but will not burn photos to disk.
I do not understand the post that explains how to fix the the problem.
Can you please explain in more detail?
When I go to the Device Manager and click the plus sign next to IDE ATA/ATAPI CONTROLLERS, it lists: ATI IDE CONTROLLER PRIMARY IDE CHANNEL PRIMARY IDE CHANNEL PRIMARY IDE CHANNEL SECONDARY IDE CHANNEL SECONDARY IDE CHANNEL SECONDARY IDE CHANNEL STANDARD DUAL CHANNEL PCI IDE CONTROLLER STANDARD DUAL CHANNEL PCI IDE CONTROLLER Which ones am I supposed to uninstall?
Thank you for your help!
