Which would be a cost efficient B&W laser printer to buy ?
My son , a university student , is printing a lot of lecture material.
I had an old Epson 400 printer that worked quite well until he started using cheap cartridges and refills which totally clogged the heads.
I have a HP7900 photo printer I use for printing photos , I need a printer to print B&W text inexpensively, I assume that laser would be a better choice than inkjet .
The printer would be run on a new PC with Vista.
Thank you Cesia
