1.1.1	I recently bought a computer from ; Gateway , 3ghz 630bus ht tech 19inch tft 16-+cdrw 1gig ram keyboard mouse microsoft home 128bit 256mb ati radeon x700se All this info means nothing to me , i bought it for 600 can you tell me if it was a good deal and if the processor is good enough to play games .	St
1.1.2	Also how do you overclock your computer i would be grateful for serious replys .	Ques
1.2.1	Chrisd123 , for overclocking information , check out : www.overclockers.com www.extremeoverclocking.com www.legionhardware.com according to legionhardware.com on this page ( http : //www.legionhardware.com/document.php ? id=439 ) the pentium 4 630 cpu in your system has the potential to be overclocked from 3.0 ghz up to 4.5 ghz .	St
1.2.2	Whether or not your computer can be overclocked and how much depends upon which motherboard and bios you have and how well your system is cooled , for starters .	St
1.2.3	If you do not know very much about computer hardware , I suggest you spend a lot of time researching your hardware and hardware in general at any of the afforementioned sites .	St
1.2.4	As to whether or not it was a good deal , I honestly do not know for sure .	St
1.2.5	It does n't seem like it was a bad deal .	St
1.2.6	I guess it depends upon which games you intend to play on it to answer that part of the question .	St
1.2.7	I am sure that most games made in the last decade would play just fine on it , though some of the newest , most graphic intense games might exceed your radeon x700se 's capabilities .	St
1.2.8	I believe you could play the most intense games , but it could be a little laggy .	St
1.2.9	Hope this helps .	St
1.2.10	gumbril	St
1.3.1	Some are a lot more demanding on computers than others	St
