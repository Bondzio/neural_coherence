after the 3rd round of communications from buffalo tech support i arrived at the following solution: i turned ftp filesharing on in the linkstation and was able to access my data folders one at a time using an explorer window and the address ftp:// &lt;ip address&gt;.
using this method, i backed them up to my hd.
(took some time) i installed an updated firmware file (v1.47) from the buffalo tech support website using the &quot; /force&quot; install parameter.
(this also took some time).
my original files were intact after this process was completed.
after this was done, everything was working as it should be.
apparently, the binary files somehow were corrupted.
i just wish i knew how/why this happened so it could be avoided in the future.
the linkstation lives a sheltered life, in a place where it doesn't receive any bumps, and is powered by a filtered, battery backed ups of considerable capacity.
