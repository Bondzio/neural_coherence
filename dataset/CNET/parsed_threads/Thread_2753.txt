<s> Ok, this has been a lingering problem. </s>
<s> I have wireless on my computer. </s>
<s> The problem is that everytime I open IE, I get that its not connecting to internet message. </s>
<s> It gives me an option of running the windows diagnostic, which I do. </s>
<s> It usually works, then I can get online. </s>
<s> Sometimes I have to run it a few times before I can get online. </s>
<s> any suggestions? </s>
<s> if so, the wireless connection could be lost and it's taking a bit to get reconnected. </s>
<s> if you have the network connection icon in your system tray (lower right corner) you can quickly check its status by putting the pointer over it. </s>
<s> no, it doesnt go asleep. </s>
<s> This happens right when I power up. </s>
<s> I do show a strong signal, on my network (and my other laptop does work fine). </s>
<s> IE just always makes me go through the dignostic in orer to use the internet. </s>
<s> Is there a setting taht I am missing? </s>
<s> i had the same situations before.. what you can try is updating the router driver. </s>
<s> also u can try uninstalling and then reinstalling the router driver. </s>
<s> I dont recall ever installing the driver for the router, its plug and play </s>
