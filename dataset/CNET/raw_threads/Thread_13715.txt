1213	0	52235	622862	NR	smileyc	12/20/04 7:40 AM	1.1035284E12	The network path was not found.	I have 2 XP machines running SP1. Yesterday they were working fine. I could connect from either direction. Today if i try to connect to computer A from computer B i get the network path was not found error. I have not ran any updates nor do i have a firewall. Permissions are setup just fine on each computer. I can connect to Computer B from computer A just fine. I have internet connnection and everything seems to be working fine. I am connected with an eight port switch. I have been working fine for several months now and i just don't know what could have caused this. ANY IDEAS?

There are a few that connected a cable/dsl modem to a hub/switch and it might work for a short time. Then the ISP knocks out the IP address and such may happen. Your description of the network is too light to really tell what it is yet. Do open a command window and try ... NET VIEW Bob
1213	2	52235	622987	622897	smileyc	12/20/04 8:37 AM	1.10353182E12	Standard Setup	I do have a cable modem and i use an eight port switch. Both of the computers will connect to the internet and i can see each computer from command Net View.

1213	4	52235	623049	623001	smileyc	12/20/04 9:00 AM	1.1035332E12	Standard Setup	That's exactly the way it is setup. Sorry I didn't specify the first time. Cable modem&gt;Router&gt;Switch

All you need to do is read your posts and see that the first post supplied &quot;not much&quot;, the second post had an error and the last post is one where you give up rather than tell what firewall you have installed. I hope the last clue was enough for you to reconfigure the firewall which I still don't know if you have such. The Forum Tip helps avoid such back and forth as we dig out the needed information: Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. Best of luck in your endeavours. Bob
