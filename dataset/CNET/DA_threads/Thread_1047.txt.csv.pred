St
1.1.2	PSU - I was looking at the NeoPower by Antec, but too expensive, would have to save is there an alt to it?	St
1.1.3	http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?rb=8066649120&action=UFNQcm9kdWN0U2VhcmNoUmVzdWx0cw==&subcat_uid=177&order_col=sell_price&order=ASC&show=stock&offset=0 CASE - well I am not sure on a case, can one be picked out for me?	St
1.1.4	http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?rb=8066654570&action=c2hvd3N1YmNhdGVnb3J5X3BhZ2U=&subcat_uid=1094 I don't want to excess the 50 budget on my case .... could it have a side window?	St
1.1.5	Motherboard - I know this takes a big roll in my computer so I was looking at 60/80 I am honestly not sure ... http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?rb=8066734367&action=c2hvd3N1YmNhdGVnb3J5X3NlYXJjaA==&cat_uid=14&stid=2 Overall, I'd like this computer to run Doom 3 fairly good (mid, 800x600) if Doom 3 ran good, I'd know all my other games would zoom ...	St
1.1.6	I am not an overclocker to be honest, never tryed it.	St
1.1.7	not bothered much about the sound it makes as long as it does not sound like a lawnmover!	St
1.1.8	After this build I'll use it till Christmas, then build another with a high budget and use this as a second for friends (LAN)	St
1.2.1	just a thought ditch your XFX gfx card and get this mobo, it includes a dual 6600 gfx card http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?action=c2hvd19wcm9kdWN0X292ZXJ2aWV3&product_uid=90888 that's spending about $100 EU on the mobo ish but it'll provide higher graphics performance http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?rb=8067982773&action=c2hvd19wcm9kdWN0X292ZXJ2aWV3&product_uid=43567 ^ that PSU should work, another option woudl be http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?rb=8068040232&action=c2hvd19wcm9kdWN0X3NwZWNpZmljYXRpb25z&product_uid=35885 ^ and it'd probably also work (can't find rail info on either of those at the site, a review pins the TrueBlue 480W @ 18A on the 12v, which is cutting a bit low, but should work, and the other one I just know is a good PSU, but idk it's exact rails)	St
1.3.1	http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?action=c2hvd19wcm9kdWN0X292ZXJ2aWV3&product_uid=90888 Does it come with two GFX cards?	St
1.3.2	Not bad though!	Polite
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	One GFX will still work and if I'm not happy with my FPS in DOOM 3 and I can buy another one!?	St
1.5.2	Okay, I think I'll go with that one.	St
1.5.3	The PSU is fine, I think!	St
1.5.4	Now the case!?	St
1.5.5	... could you pick one out there seems to be masses of budget ones!	St
1.5.6	:S I'd like a side window to show off the light off on the PSU!	St
1.6.1	Hah, silly me!	St
1.6.2	One Geforce Dual 6600 Chip 450/1000Mhz 256MB DDRIII Because it says DUAL!	St
1.6.3	... didn't think did I?	St
1.7.1	you've confused me with your two posts the board includes a special edition video card which features 2 GeForce 6600's their performance will be 6800-ish level (maybe a little higher) aside from that, the board is an SLI board, you just can't use the other slot (it should be the same board as included in the 6600GT version) unless you replaced the card and got 2 PCIE single chip cards	Sug
1.8.1	How come the other slot can't be used?	St
1.8.2	Does have anythng to do with it being dual?	Ques
1.9.1	I found www.scan.co.uk a LOT better and tonnes cheaper!	St
1.9.2	I have found everything there!	St
1.9.3	All I need is a motherboard and GFX card!	St
1.9.4	and RAM but I'll pick that after the video card!	St
1.9.5	Ozos?	St
1.9.6	.. is it possable you could hand pick me one?	St
1.9.7	I couldn't find the Gigabyte GV-3D1XL!	St
1.9.8	Got a nice case though!	St
1.9.9	http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&lr=&q=Chenbro+Gaming+Bomb+Green In Green not bad?	St
1.9.10	how about a ... http://www.scan.co.uk/Products/ProductInfo.asp?WebProductID=154679 Looks okay!	St
1.9.11	But you're the PSU master!	St
1.10.1	currently 4-way SLI isn't possible so your using 2-way SLI and just using 1 slot as to the PSU haven't heard much on Akasa, and personally i'd rather spend a few extra bucks over buying something that looks cheap/unknown this one's bigger (580W) brother got good reviews http://www.scan.co.uk/Products/ProductInfo.asp?WebProductID=148298 and it's features look very nice: dual 12v rails modular 480W 120MM fan Active PFC (very good) and it includes a case fan if i'm reading it's description right it looks identical to the NeoPower in specification except it's 12v1 and 12v2 seem slightly higher/stronger (which is better) here is a review of the 580W http://www.xtremeresources.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Reviews&file=index&req=showcontent&id=78 and the 480W is reviewed http://www.ozcasemodz.com/reviews.php?load=review&id=15 there it doesn't look perfect but it does seem like a you get what you pay for scinario i wouldn't have issues using that PSU, but it's your money and your choice i'd suggest doing some research on the PSU look for some reviews and compare a few of the ones that fit your price range as to the case very nice choice, haven't ever personally used, or for that matter seen one up close, but it should look fine (just note that the green shade may not be identical to as it is online, but it shouldn't vary that much (like, maybe a 2% color variation, if even that, your room's lighting will really affect how it looks in the end)) as to it's cooling it appears to have mount points for 2-3 fans?	St
1.10.2	i confirm 1 120MM in the rear and an unkonwn in the front, and the side appears to support another one i'd just ensure you have fans to put into those points and your selection of this case, which ues 120MM fans will yield a very quiet, yet high performance, cooling system without spending more for water cooling as to motherboard and GPU your getting an Athlon64 correct?	St
1.10.3	I would suggest the Abit AN8 SLi Edition http://www.scan.co.uk/Products/ProductInfo.asp?WebProductID=213551 Abit is an excellent company, and that provides you with SLI for the future (thus giving you more upgradeability over a non-SLI equipped board, but if that is too much, the normal AN8 would serve just as well) as for a video chip i'd personally suggest the GeForce 6800 PCIE with SLI connector BUT those are rather expensive (on newegg it's only about $45 more for a 6800 PCIE over a decent 6600GT PCIE (comparing the Asus TOP Edition 6600GT (Which is around $210) to a 6800 PCIE (which is a tick under $300) while at Scan it's about 2x as much, so a 6600GT seems to be it...) if the 6800LE were SLI capable i'd suggest it but it's not, so I'll write to avoid it (as it's roughly comparable to a 6600GT, if not a little slower) and you'll just have to pick which 6600GT you want i'd avoid the 6600 non-GT as they won't support SLI, so if you wished to upgrade in the future you'd need to buy two new cards one note on nVidia SLI it requires the exact same cards/BIOS versions, meaning if you were to buy this tommorow and in August want another 6600GT to give you a performance boost to play newer games, you'd have to update the BIOS on your existing 6600GT, and buy the same brand 6600GT (yet i've heard of different brands running in SLI, i'd try to avoid it (as the useres that did it only did it for a week at most, and it was only to test it's work-ability, not as a permanent solution) a few good brands for video would be Leadtek, XFX, MSI is usually high quality, and Asus is also a fairly good brand... i've used all of the above brands in the past with the exceptin of MSI, and would reccomend any of the above brands (i'm currently using a Leadtek card) Gigabyte would also be a good brand in terms of hardware quality (I have never used a gigabyte gfx card, yet their motherboards are of good quality) i'm not sure either way on AOpen, they don't seem bad, but i've never really talked to anyone who owns an AOpen/seen an AOpen set performance benchmarks (either motherboard or graphics card) i'm not saying AOpen won't work i'm just saying I've heard next to nothing on them, so i'd personally rather go with a brand I have more experience with, such as XFX or Asus as for memory it's really what you can afford try to get DDR 400, 2x512MB (so you can run dual channel) and a CAS Latency of 2.5 or 2, but if that isn't possible CAS 3 DDR 400 2x512MB would be fine (it won't be bad, it just isn't as high end as the CAS 2 or middle ground CAS 2.5 chips) while higher speed DDR is offered (Currently the highest speed DDR on the market is DDR 650, which is 250MHZ faster than DDR 400) I would avoid it, performance users experiment with higher speed DDR on AMD Athlon64 systems, but AMD does not officially support any DDR above 400MHZ for Athlon64, and considering that the Athlon64 is controlling the memory, instead of the nForce4 chipset, i'm going to go with AMD on this one (while an Intel user could use DDR 650, assuming their system was of a good quality (good CPU/chipset) and they'd get a good performance boost from it (most high speed RAM products are designed for Intel, as Pentium 4 has required amazingly high bandwidth for performance since it's inception, which is why Intel first jumpped to RDRAM, it gave a slight performance advantage over SDRAM, but it cost so much more, hence use of DDR, and now DDR2 (which is capable of even higher speeds, which is why it was considered for graphics use, but it can at best only achive a 128-bit memory bus (which is like octa channel, so for a computer system it's great, considering you don't need 8 channels for RAM, when 2 is the max)) if your going to take a jump and buy performance DDR, Corsair is usually a safe bet OCZ is excellent and Mushkin is also good Crucial's Ballistix and Ballistix Tracer lines are considered good, but it's like 50/50 as to if it's going to shine, or just be average (some users it's the best thing next to sliced bread, but for others they'd take bread over Ballistix)	St
1.11.1	I was thinking about a 6600 GT!	St
1.11.2	I wasn't looking at SLi, I think I should keep that till my next build (Christmas/Janurary) http://www.scan.co.uk/Products/ProductInfo.asp?WebProductID=148298 I think I'll go with that, Mmm Red!	St
1.11.3	Back to the video card, XFX look nice ... never liked Leadtek they have Winfast on 'em, reminds me of Windows 98, don't ask why?	St
1.11.4	I'll get one if see a gooden!	St
1.11.5	For the RAM I was thinking about 2 x 256 PC3200, Value Corsair not sure though!	St
1.11.6	Like I said I will be building another after Christmas so I might be able to fork out for FX, SLi, DDR2 and that stuff.	St
1.11.7	I'll currently waiting for my job to come though (Once I am 16) once it happens my FIRST SECOND AND THIRD wage packet will be spent on this computer, also my birthday!	St
1.11.8	** Like many others I have seen the light ... you'll can pull out your Dell XPS but it'll never own a hand built computer!	St
1.12.1	Abit AN8 NForce4, ATX, DDDR400, PCI-E, Gbit Lan, USB 2.0, 1394, 5.1ch Audio, 4 x SATA, Raid http://www.scan.co.uk/Products/ProductInfo.asp?WebProductID=176393 Looks good!	St
1.13.1	Would two of these babies run fine?	St
1.13.2	http://www.scan.co.uk/Products/ProductInfo.asp?WebProductID=71470	St
1.14.1	I was thinking 128M Asus PCI-E EN6600GT-TD Tv/DVI Retail OR 128Mb AOpen PCI-E 6600GT DVI/TV-Out Best to go for GT, hey?	St
1.14.2	Or maybe something else?	St
1.14.3	http://www.scan.co.uk/Products/Products.ASP?CatID=15&FilterCategories=379&Thumbnails=yes	St
1.15.1	Asus wears the crown!	St
1.16.1	the AN8 is an excellent board and between Asus and AOpen i'd take Asus any day Asus has a special edition 6600GT called the &quot;6600GT TOP&quot; which is considerably faster it uses the 1.6ns RAM of the 6800 Ultra and GT series cards http://www.xtremeresources.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Reviews&file=index&req=showcontent&id=68	St
1.17.1	I'll get that m/board and what about the RAM?	St
1.18.1	They don't work for me!	St
1.18.2	They were slow before though ... maybe server trouble!	St
1.19.1	what is the RAM product your looking at?	St
1.20.1	I was looking at Corsairs Value RAM PC3200 (2 X 256) I think that would be perfect And in christmas for me next one, I'll opt for XMS3200 CAS2 or DDR2, or something!	St
