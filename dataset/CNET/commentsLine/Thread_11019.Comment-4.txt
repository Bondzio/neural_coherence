i'm using firefox web browser i noticed there's an orange line across the folder tab.
i'm not sure if it's always been there but that's the same orange color i see going across the screen sometimes.
also i see the orange when i open my computer and hover over &quot;name&quot; &quot;type&quot; &quot;total size&quot;.
i don't know if that's supposed to happen but that's what i see.
