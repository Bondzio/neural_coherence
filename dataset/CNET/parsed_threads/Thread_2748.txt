<s> I keep my PC on at all times except when there is a major lightning storm, when I do turn it off. </s>
<s> As an Electrical Engineer I feel by leaving the PC ON keeps the electronics at a more uniform temperature and eliminates the surges that occur when turning it ON. </s>
<s> Possibly turning it OFF overnight would not be to bad, but it is saving a minimal amount of KWHr to be left OFF. </s>
<s> Turning it OFF/ON for several times a day is not very good for the electronics. </s>
<s> I highly agree about this--further reasons--the heating and cooling effect of turning on and off your computer can cause solder joints to &quot;dry out&quot; making them less conductive, and brittle. </s>
<s> This causes easy breakability, and overall unstability of your computer. </s>
<s> So it is definately worth the extra dollar a month to keep your computer running. </s>
<s> Hi, Sciencebook. </s>
<s> It's arguable (very) whether it's better for YOU to keep it on or off. </s>
<s> But in terms of energy demand (and we're going back into what was once called an &quot;energy crisis&quot;) and global warming, the answer is simple -- TURN IT OFF! </s>
<s> Furthermore, if you're on a network or broadband, the increased risk of someone sneaking in an open port and doing nasty things with the computer again outweigh the arguable benefit in longevity. </s>
