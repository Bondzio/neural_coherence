<s> I have XP, and I just partitioned my new external western digital hard drive as NTFS. </s>
<s> I took my hard drive to school ( we use Macs OS 10), and the Mac would not recognize my drive. </s>
<s> The drive is supposed to be multi-platform. </s>
<s> How would I partition my drive so that both Macs and PCs recognize the drive? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Hi! </s>
<s> FAT 32 was not an option when I partitioned it. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Anyone know how to get that FAT 32 option on a PC (Windows XP)? </s>
<s> Also, If I were to partition my drive on a Mac (OS 10), what format would I partition it so that both platforms, Windows xp and OS 10, both recognize my drive? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> When I partition, if I keep the partitions under 32GB, then I can format in FAT32 or NTFS. </s>
<s> Your reply didn't tell much so I am unsure why you couldn't accomplish this feat. </s>
