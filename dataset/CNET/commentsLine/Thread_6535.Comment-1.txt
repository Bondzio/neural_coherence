hello, i have a small web desing agency.
we work mostly with files 1 to 10mb and sometimes with larger files (up to 300 - 400mb).
we are moving files over the network from workstations to server and backwards (we have a file check out system on the server).
at this time we are 4 desingers, but i need a solution that works up to 8 / 10 peole.
we are moving from our office to a new location, and i'm thinking to install only a wlan network but i don't know if the speed would be good for me.
at this time we are working ok on a 100mbps wired network.
i heard that 802.11n have speeds up to 300mbps (that's 3 times faster), but i don't know if that's only in theory or if in practice it will work at that speed.
so i have the next questions: 1) the 300mbps of 802.11n are true on practice or only on theory on &quot;ideal&quot; situations?
2) if we connect 3 users at the same time, what will happen with the speed?
we have to split the total speed between all the users connected?
3) is there any problem right now with security and availability for wlans?
4) i'm considering linksys wrvs4400n router.
it's good or there are better routers for this?
5) what would be a nice configuration for me?
(router, access point, switch... i don't know what i need) thanks a lot!
nacho
