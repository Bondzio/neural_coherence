<s> Ok, well ive had this problem ever since i got a new hard drive, and new install of windows. </s>
<s> After i got everything basic done, i installed all my drivers from the cds, for my mobo, gfx card, and hard drive. </s>
<s> Then i went online, and downloaded updated drivers for everything. </s>
<s> But now im having massive problems with my computer in terms of gfx, especially in gaming. </s>
<s> Used to be i could run all the new source games just fine, long loads yes, but they still ran fine on medium settings. </s>
<s> Now i can barely run the older half life games, i cant even play DOD without tons of lag, and my framerate being shot to hell. </s>
<s> I have also experienced other problems, including the icons on the desktop, the semi-transparent area around them just comes out as black, so they look jagged and ugly. </s>
<s> I also cant watch videos on the internet. </s>
<s> I get this green screen instead and my computer slows down horribly. </s>
<s> Now i have opened up my case, and i have made sure everything was tightened down, i even unhooked my extra hard drives to see if it was too much for my power supply. </s>
<s> I am clueless as to whats wrong, but my sister is willing to help me out and buy a few replacement parts. </s>
<s> Not a full new system like i thought at first, but just things like maybe a new gfx card or power supply. </s>
<s> What i need to know is what i need to do, cause i am clueless as to whats wrong. </s>
<s> Heres my system specs if that helps: Gigabyte KT600 K7 Triton 400 FSB Motherboard AMD Athlon XP 2200+ 512mb PC2700 Corsair memory Gainward nVidia GeForce FX 5200 128mb Creative 24-BIT Sound Card RAIDMAX Scorpio ATX-868WBP Black Computer Case w\420watts Power Supply Segate 250gb IDE HD Sony CD-RW Sony DVD-ROM 8 LED Case Fans Im pretty sure thats it. </s>
<s> I mean before i installed the new hard drive, i added 2 new fans. </s>
<s> Other than that i cant think of anything else. </s>
<s> Any advice would rock!! </s>
<s> Thanks before hand! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> so that would mean u have the most current nvidia driver? </s>
<s> 78.01? </s>
<s> try dling it if u dont. </s>
<s> if that does does not solve your problem, then its either powersupply or graphics card... could u try the graphics card on a different computer? </s>
<s> if it works fine then its ur psu... 420 watt powersupply that came with the case doesnt sound too good...especially with new hard drive, 8 fans, sound card, graphics card, and 2 optical drives gainward also doesnt sound too reputable so it may be your graphics card too.... </s>
<s> power supply calculator: http://www.jscustompcs.com/power_supply/ and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Well i tried that thing, and even with my second hard drive attached, its only at about 310w </s>
<s> I have the newest drivers for everything I dont have another computer to try my other gfx card on, the only other one in my house is my sisters laptop, and i just sold my parts box so i cant build a temp one either. </s>
<s> Do you think it would work to get a new gfx card and psu? </s>
<s> i mean thats not too much, since i have to get agp, i can get a GeForce 5500 from a friend, that he never used for about $50, and i can get a 500w psu for around $70, so i can get both of those right now, i just wanted to know if thats what i should do. </s>
<s> I wanna make sure its nothing else. </s>
<s> Because one of the other things ive thought about, is that i used Knoppix linux-on-a-cd on my comp. </s>
<s> to transfer files off my old hard drive, which the windows on it got fully corrupted. </s>
<s> After i finished moving most files, i went to move my fonts over, and i tried going into the windows folder, and it crashed linux. </s>
<s> Ever since then, my computer has felt slower, like the load of knoppix felt slower. </s>
<s> I was thinking the crash might have done something to my ram, since knoppix loads completly in the ram, but i hace no idea, which is why i am asking here </s>
<s> with that power supply but I do know that a PS rated at 400W rarely put out 400W by the time it gets to the MB. </s>
<s> They typically lose between 15% and 30%. </s>
<s> That puts you in the range. </s>
<s> I would get a 500W because you undoubtedly will be adding on stuff later. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> and life goes on.... Jack </s>
