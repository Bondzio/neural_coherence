So I recently got a new mouse(Logitech g400 &lt;3) and it needs a loving friend. When on my computer, I'm generally gaming, so I want a keyboard more designed for that. I've already looked at a few, and they seem to get generally positive reviews. $100 or less. Logitech g110 Razer Black Widow Razer Lycosa Microsoft Sidewinder x6 If you own/have owned one of these boards and/or have any insight on them/what I should get/whats better, that'd be particularly delightful. Your insight is appreciated.

The logitech units tended to be mushy/mashy buttons and surprisingly the MSFT units were good enough to not get complaints. The MSFT units lasted 6+ years until we swapped the office over to laptops.
