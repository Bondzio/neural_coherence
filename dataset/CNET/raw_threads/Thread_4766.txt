I ENABLED the SATA Boot Rom in the BIOS and re-booted. When the opening screens are flashing by, I see the drive has been detected and is listed. But when Windows comes up and I click on My Computer, it is not listed. What am I missing?

If you do & the drive still doesn't show up, you probably need to format the hard drive. It's easy, just Google FORMAT HARD DRIVE & you shouldn't have any trouble finding a how to. Good Luck

I did a search on the NET and found a MaxBlaster, but that looks like a utility not a driver. I thought I had found something, but now my 160G Maxtor 6V160EO drive is showing up as a 149G SCSI.

On Asus.com, there is a SATA/RAID driver for that board: VIA VT6420 (VT8237) SATA RAID Driver Package Version 2.20D WHQL It's just not at the top of the drivers list.

More info than most want to know: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix The bottom line is that you can expect a computer to calculate a difference of close to 7% less than the decimal size indicated on the hard disk retail packaging. Strange, but common.
