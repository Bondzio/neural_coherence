<s> I purchsed an HP system at Sam's clug several months ago. </s>
<s> The monitor has had a flicker from the beginning, which is getting worse. </s>
<s> I have tried everything in HP help and nothing seems to correct the problem. </s>
<s> I have heard of the blackout problem. </s>
<s> Is this the way this problem starts? </s>
<s> If its just flickering reduce the hertz to 60 and see if that works Right click on desk top, then properties,then setting,advanced, monitor. </s>
<s> there you should see screen refreshing rate. </s>
<s> Set it at 60 hertz and see if it helps. </s>
<s> When it starts blacking out you will know because after about 1 minute when the computer turns on the monitor will blackout </s>
<s> Thanks for the &quot;reduce the hertz&quot; messege. </s>
<s> It was at 60HZ when the flicker began, and as it worsened. </s>
<s> I changed it to 75HZ yesterday and it worked fine for about a day, then began flikcering again. </s>
<s> I begins slowly and gets worse. </s>
<s> Sometimes the screen turns red and there are lines across the screen. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>
<s> just by chance is they a light next to them monitor or your speakers next to it. </s>
<s> That may cause the monitor to flicker too </s>
