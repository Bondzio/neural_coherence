I dont know what NVMM is either and at www.evga.com their knowledge base doesnt have an answer for either code 50 or nvmm.
its under warrenty still so ill contacat their tech support and see what they say, which they wont have a clue like usual, and it shouldnt be a problem to send it back.
Thanks for the info willy and ramarc!
