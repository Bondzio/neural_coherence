You will need to make sure that the PCI wireless card has drivers for the operating system of the old computer.
a couple of years ago I was in a similar situation and a Belkin product wouldn't work on a computer with Windows 98 on it, where a Linksys was OK. That may be even more of a problem now.
Another solution would be an ordinary PCI network card, may need an old second hand one?
and a wireless access point that can be setup as a wireless client.
