1.1.1	I just bought a Geforce 8600GT graphics card so that I can play some games , as my current graphics card was too bad to support the games I wanted to play , and someone recommended the 8600GT to me as a graphics card .	St
1.1.2	Can somebody please tell me how to connect graphic card to my PC ?	Ques
1.1.3	And whether or not I will need to get some other things to connect it , like a cable or something ?	Ques
1.2.1	... you remove the cover and plug in the card into the PCIe x16 slot , which presumably your computer has .	St
1.2.2	I would hope this card comes with an installation booklet , but two things you 'll need to do are to disable any built-in graphics on your mobo or CPU and install the driver that comes with the card .	St
1.2.3	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	If you research the 8600 DEFECTIVE posts on google you would only use this model if it was free .	St
1.3.2	There is no way to & quot ; connect & quot ; such a card .	St
1.3.3	We do open the case to plug them into the card slot but such install instructions are all over the web so I 'm guessing you really are asking how to connect it .	St
1.3.4	Sorry , there is no such system in today 's PCs .	St
