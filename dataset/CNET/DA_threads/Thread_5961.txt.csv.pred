1.1.1	I wanted to upgrade my WinXP home-built system with a new mobo and cpu .	St
1.1.2	But when it tries to start , it almost gets to the WinXP screen and then it restarts .	St
1.1.3	It keeps doing this over and over until I shut it down .	St
1.1.4	Someone told me that you ca n't use the same hard drive that was used in a WinXP system .	St
1.1.5	But all of the hardware except mobo and cpu are the same .	St
1.1.6	( sometimes I almost miss Win98 ) I have all of my software and documents there and I hate to wipe it and start over from scratch .	St
1.1.7	Can I set it as a slave in my upgraded system , or will this not work either ?	Ques
1.1.8	The new mobo and cpu are just sitting in the box .	St
1.1.9	I had them checked out at a computer shop to make sure they were ok and they checked out fine .	St
1.1.10	I appreciate any help .	Polite
1.2.1	Yes , you can set it as a slave .	St
1.2.2	You also could put it on the other IDE channel ( other cable ) as a master or slave .	Sug
1.2.3	The current installation of XP on the old HD is expecting the old motherboard and its BIOS .	St
1.2.4	That causes major problems .	St
1.2.5	Boot to the XP CD and perform a repair installation of windows .	St
1.2.6	Hopefully you have a backup of your important files in cast there is a problem with the repair installation .	St
1.2.7	http : //www.windowsreinstall.com/winxphome/installxpcdrepair/index.htm	St
