<s> I was wondering if it is possible to run Mac OS from an external hard drive. </s>
<s> Currently I have a Dell with an Intel Core Duo 2 CPU 2.00GHz and 3GB of ram. </s>
<s> The external hard drive is a Hitachi 1TB. </s>
<s> Would I be able to partition the external hard drive so I can use it with windows and maybe(if possible) run Mac OS from it. </s>
<s> The forum policies disallow discussions that break that OS's license. </s>
