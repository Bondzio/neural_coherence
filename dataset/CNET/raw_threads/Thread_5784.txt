SP1 patches it so you can do more, but with the danger that if you make an over 127GB partition, the data will go missing until you apply SP1. But you can't apply SP1 since the OS is not installed. To get all around this issue, look up AUTOSTREAMER and make a proper XP CD with SP2 or order a XP SP2 CD from Microsoft. Bob

I don't use more than 10gb or 20gb for main as cleanup, defrag and all goes faster, and I can redo the main partition without losing all I have stored in the other ones.
