i've done a lot of research on this today and it seems that you can't swap out or reset an hp oem cartridge chip anymore, but you don't need to.
the trick is simply to use 2 oem cartridges.
you can't refill one & put it right back in --- you have to use a different one, but you can swap them out each time.
apparently the printer knows if the previous cartridge was put back into it, but it can only remember the last one, so if you use cartridge #1 & it goes empty, put cartridge #2 in, then when #2 empties, you put #1 (refilled) back in and it should work, and then refill & use #2 when the refilled #1 goes empty.
note that i haven't tried this, but i saw more than 1 site that said it worked, including this youtube video:  i'll try this and see what happens.
any other suggestions (that truly work on this printer/cartridge) are welcomed.
i've seen that some hp inkjets can have their chip swapped out, but this generation of printers/cartridges seems to have caught on.
i imagine the next generation will blackball any cartridge that has ever been used anywhere, or the cartridge itself will go bad after the 1st use.
too much money is riding on this for hp to not make an effort to thwart refills for good.
the only way it's going to change is for congress or someone with deep pockets suing them to stop them from polluting the environment with empty cartridges & using monopolistic business practices to secure their profits.
