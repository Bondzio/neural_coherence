I have a single level house with three laptops, two of which are Dell Inspirons and one of which is an IBM Thinkpad. I need a recommendation for a router that is much more focused on range than speed. The speed that comes out of the cable modem is fine for us, as we don't do many speed-intensive tasks. Also, I would like it to be easy to set up, as I am fairly knowledgeable when it comes to techy stuff, but not programmer smart or anything. Thanks Much!

I expected to learn a lot about networking (through trial and error), but each D-link component; cable modem, router, NICs, and wireless NICs all found each other, self configured, and it was done. Well, maybe not that easy, I had to input some data and set up home networking on the PCs, but all in all, the D-link configuration was really a snap. Just don't mix brands. Good luck, Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.
