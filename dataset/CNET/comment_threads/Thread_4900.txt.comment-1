Morning everyone - I'm currently researching/looking for a 8 port, Layer 5, Load Balancing Switch.
I was wondering if anyone could provide me w/ some some insight as to what your company may be using and also what you may recommend.
I have already spent a tremendous amount of money upgrading our network and this addition is absolutely necessary but we are trying to acquire a LBS at a reasonable price but of high reliability.
Thank you in advance!
-CK
