<s> Hello friends, I have a Pentium 111 800 with XP Pro on it. </s>
<s> I have a telephone line connection to the internet. </s>
<s> Can anyone recommend an external modem for me. </s>
<s> All options please. </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>
<s> Any USR external was nice for me. </s>
<s> But today I tend to just pick up units like http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CDIMM00131-PB&cat=MDM which are under 20 bucks. </s>
<s> The modem market is littered with such bargains and support is non-existent. </s>
<s> While you are asking for all options, I can't help since that would be too much work on my part plus what you can obtain may be limited to what country you live in. </s>

<s> There are a lot of choices. </s>
<s> They will all work. </s>
<s> Go to www.pricegrabber.com and put in External modem and you will get a list with lots of choices. </s>
<s> I like USR modems but there are many good ones out there. </s>
<s> http://www.usr.com/home.asp </s>
<s> Don't settle for &quot;non-brand&quot; modems out there even if the price is decent. </s>
<s> The brands that seem to pop-up alot are USR(3Com) and Zoom. </s>
<s> Both supply docs and s/w if needed, while many off brands tend to skip on alot of support or offer basic needs. </s>
<s> Plus, the chipset to look for is Lucent or Rockwell, but there are Conxent, Cirrus, and Motorola, maybe others. </s>
<s> Check to be sure any cabling is supplied as that's an extra cost otherwise. </s>
<s> You can google or websearch and see what the vendors offer but if you know you have a problematic telco link, make sure to correct that as well. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks everyone, Once again you guys come through. </s>
<s> Cheers, cheers and cheers. </s>
<s> :-) </s>
<s> I use a Zoom Model 3048C which connects via a serial port. </s>
<s> Zoom V.92/V90 Faxmodem Series 0269 It connects quickly. </s>
<s> Very easy to set-up. </s>
<s> Works so well, I bought another one for my other computer. </s>
