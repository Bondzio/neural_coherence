1.1.1	I just got a new computer and my roommate has another computer .	St
1.1.2	I had to set the new computer up last night when I go to my network to manage it the network is in my roommates name now and it says I have not been invited to manage the network .	St
1.1.3	How does he do that ?	Ques
1.1.4	I have HP Vista , he has a Dell XP .	St
1.1.5	We both are using McAfee and that program is telling me I have to get his permission .	St
1.1.6	I do not know how the network is in his name now and why I have to be invited to manage it .	St
1.1.7	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	If all you have are two PCs connected , it 's likely just peer-to-peer and there is no network manager .	St
1.2.2	You will have administrative and possibly limited accounts on the individual computers and , perhaps , some sharing of folder and/or printers between the two .	St
1.2.3	If you set up your own computer , you likely used an administrator account .	St
1.2.4	But , you can not access your roommate 's PC without some additional configuration .	St
1.2.5	I can only imagine the McAfee message might be from trying to do a network scan rather than files/folders on your own PC .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your advice .	Polite
1.3.2	It is really confusing because my HP network sharing center has the network in my name and the McAfee has it in his name .	St
1.3.3	I also wanted to ask this , The network is stating it is public .	St
1.3.4	Should I make it private or keep it public ?	Ques
1.3.5	It is only me and his laptop a desktop and the printer we share and a Roku device .	St
1.3.6	And I am not going to Starbucks any time soon to use my computer .	St
1.4.1	The network will be the collection of attached hardware ( wired or wireless ) and & quot ; the McAfee & quot ; will be a piece of software that resides on one or more PCs .	St
1.4.2	If your roommate installed a piece of software such as a McAfee product on your PC using an account other than yours and did n't make it accessible by all users , this could be your problem .	St
1.4.3	Is this what you are seeing ?	Ques
1.5.1	Actually the McAfee comes with my ATT DSL so I really am trying to figure out how it is showing it is his network if the McAfee was downloaded under my account .	St
1.5.2	He is a sub account .	St
1.6.1	Then whoever pays the bill for the DSL owns that account .	St
1.6.2	If your roommates username/password was used to access the download site , that could be related to the problem .	St
1.6.3	If you pay the bill , that 's a different matter .	St
1.6.4	This is beginning to sound like an issue you 'll need to take up with your ISP if it 's just related to software they offer with a subscription to their service .	St
1.6.5	Sorry ... ca n't help in that regard .	St
1.7.1	It sounds as if your problem is with the McAfee program that 's offered with an AT & T account .	St
1.7.2	I ca n't know but perhaps it 's an add in to their own browser .	St
1.7.3	If it 's causing you more problems than it 's value to you , I 'd suggest removing it and getting another free AV program .	St
1.7.4	Some AV and internet security software , if installed using its defaults , is quite intrusive .	St
1.7.5	There should be no reason it should interfere with local network management by PC owners .	St
1.7.6	Perhaps you 're just dealing with a firewall that you do n't have adequate privileges to take down .	St
1.7.7	You need a firewall and an AV program .	St
1.7.8	I presume you have a router .	St
1.7.9	That offers some protection from peering eyes .	St
1.7.10	You might do well to consider using Avast or free AVG instead of McAfee .	St
1.8.1	I pay the bill and it is in my name .	St
1.8.2	I am going to call them tomorrow and ask what the heck is going on .	St
1.8.3	I have a feeling though that AT & T is going to send me the 2nd level internet support that I have to pay for , which I refuse to do .	St
1.8.4	They send me there just to configure my email for my browser .	St
1.8.5	Thanks for your responses .	St
1.8.6	Oh another thing should I have my network set at Public or Private .	St
1.9.1	the Vista help files on the subject to see what scenario fits your needs .	St
1.9.2	From the little I know , the terms seem to be backwards .	St
1.9.3	If you want to share on the local network , it 's private .	St
1.9.4	If no sharing , it 's public ... .at least that 's what I 've read .	St
1.9.5	It makes no sense to me either .	St
1.10.1	I want to thanks everyone for helping .	Polite
1.10.2	I think we are going to both uninstall the McAfee .	St
1.10.3	It really is very intrusive .	St
1.10.4	It looks like every time one of us gets a update we lose the internet connection .	St
1.10.5	The network is fine though .	Polite
1.10.6	Very strange .	St
