Went to the Epson site and downloaded what they say is there Vista driver. As per their site's instructions, I downloaded (at a cost of $15) the ungraded Smart Panel from New Age. All this and guess what? No dice. The scanner is not recognized. E-mail to Epson tech support brought the response that they &quot;are working on a driver for the Perfection and will have it some time in the future.&quot; Wow, does that ever suck? Meantime, does anybody have any suggestions for how to make this puppy work on my Vista machine?

If you just upgraded assuming , then you're probably SOL. Otherwise there's no real incentive for manufacturers to provide drivers for an OS that's radically different for a 5-year-old scanner. Get a Vista-supported scanner.
