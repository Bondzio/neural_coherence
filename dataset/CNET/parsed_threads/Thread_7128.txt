<s> I currently have a Linksys WRT54G that has 4 ethernet ports and of course wireless capability. </s>
<s> Right now, I have 3 computers and 1 printer hooked up via ethernet cable to the router. </s>
<s> My laptop uses the wireless capability. </s>
<s> So all ports are used. </s>
<s> I am buying an external hardrive to be shared by all the computers and it will be hooked up to the router via ethernet so I am going to be short 1 port on the router. </s>
<s> Do I need a router with extra ports, or can I somehow combine the new external hard drive's ethernet cable with one of the existing computer's so they share a router port? </s>
<s> If I need a new router with extra ports, can you kindly recommend one for me? </s>
<s> All I've come across are 4 port routers. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> If I get a network switcher I can hook up to 5 devices to the switch which then connects to one port of the router? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Get a network switch, they come in 5,8,16,24,32,64 port sizes. </s>
<s> But a 5 port will be about $20 or less with rebate. </s>
<s> Unplug one of the ports in your router and plug the swtich in, then plug the other stuff into the switch. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> Unplug one of the computers and get a wireless-g network adapter for it. </s>
<s> Plug the HD into the free router port. </s>
<s> Ignore any other suggestion! </s>
<s> You need a switch. </s>
<s> By far the easiest, cheapest, way to extend the number of ethernet ports on your router. </s>
<s> On any given Sunday, you can browse the sales circular from Best Buy to Staples and buy a switch for under $20! </s>
<s> You'll love it! </s>
