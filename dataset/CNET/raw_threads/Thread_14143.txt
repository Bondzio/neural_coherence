I'm going to be moving into an apartment in a month or so, which gives me about that much time to decide on some networking solutions. I'm a fairly knowledgable computer science student so feel free to speak on whatever level you'd like. I need to choose a wireless router, with a minimum of the 802.11n standard, as if you can find many without it. I'd prefer n300 or faster. I'd like this router with a usb port, and preferably gigabit ethernet ports. I was wondering whether it would be worth it to splurge on a nicer router for the future of a possibly larger house, possibly even equipped to handle 802.11ac, or whether I should stick with a lower end router. I don't currently own any -ac equipped devices but I'm sure I will in the future. Either way you choose, any specific router recommendations would be lovely. I'd like not to break the bank either. I just want quality hardware. Oh, and most of the devices I run are Apple, but I don't need an apple router unless that's legitimately what you recommend. Thanks!

I bought a Netgear R6200 which is a AC router even though I don't have any AC devices right now. Am sure I will have later on. The 6200 does have 4 gigabit Ethernet ports as well as a USB port. The range is excellent, better than anything I have ever owned. It streams Netflix to a cheap Samsung wireless Blu-ray player with no buffering and not a flicker from about 60 feet away through 3 walls. I have 2 wired and 4 wireless units on it and when the Grandkids come over add 2 more and it doesn't seem to slow it down a bit. The only knock I have seen on the router is it's size. It is big compared to other routers, 10 inches wide, 8.4 inches high and almost 3 inches deep with stand. It runs very cool so no worry's about over heating like a lot of them I have read about. They are a little pricy, about $150.00 or a little less.
