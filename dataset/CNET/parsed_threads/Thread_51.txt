<s> I bought a ThinkPad X41 table but it didn't come with a stylus. </s>
<s> I know the replacements are online but what I was hopping was to buy something better than the original. </s>
<s> Like Penabled Tablet Pc Eraser Pen here http://www.amazon.com/Penabled-Tablet-Pc-Eraser-Pen/dp/B000085BDB/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top So what i was wondering was if anyone had any recommendations or knew a good stylus that would work with my tablet. </s>
<s> A million thanks in advance. </s>

<s> While the other pens seem to work, they stick out or don't fit. </s>
