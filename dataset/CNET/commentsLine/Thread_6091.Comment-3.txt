bob, i thought it was more than odd, until i finally put the tech at hp on the spot and all he could say is that they do not support netgear for the dv8210us, in fact i tried to use other netgear routers thinking that there was a problem with the a/b/g configuration but none of the netgear products were supported, after i tried to use each one a dialog box would come up stating that the router wasn't supported....weird to say the least.....i have used this computer at several coffee shops and it works like a champ except for one place and when i asked it was a nergear product.....weird again...... believe me i wish that i could get this resolved....
