What the computer currenly has is a MSI motherboard, don't know what MSI though. Graphics card is radion 9800. The computer is custom made. For now I'm just going to upgrade the motherboard. In the future I will upgrade the whole computer. I will reuse the power supply and disc drives. What new MSI mother board is a good choice?

Your ATI video card is probably AGP and your RAM is an older DDR type. If your HD(s) and CD ROM are ATA/Atapi you'll find newer boards favor SATA and will provide limited connection for older drives. I'd say that if your MB is 3 years or older, you'd be looking for a used replacement. Perhaps a local computer builder could help you providing an old board from a PC that was traded in or such.

There locate your model# to determine the specs of your mtrbd.. You can decide what if anything can be saved or xfered to another mtrbd. and/or be upgraded to yet a newer and better class mtrbd.. Circa 2003 seems to be too old to keep the ram and cpu as mtrbds. have progressed. In this light pick one, it need not be MSI but should be should be adaptable for the latest cpu and ram now available to keep current for some time. Since, you have a custom system, it shouldn't be too hard to go forward. Though, I suggest you look into &quot;dual-core or multiple core cpu&quot; for best outcome of a typical system now. If you like check eBay for older and/or used system if you want to keep within the level you're now at determined by the specs you find. tada -----Willy

This is what I came up with to upgrade: Processer: AMD phenom x4 quad core, Motherboard: MSI k9A2 platinum, Power supply: corsair Model:wpsu-75otx I am going to get a new power supply because the one I have isn't powerful enough, and new memory ocZ platinum DDR2 1066. I will reuse my graphics card the radion 9800. Will this setup be compatible and be stable?
