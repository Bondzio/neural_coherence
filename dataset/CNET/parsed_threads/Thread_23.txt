<s> I'm having troubles configuring my network. </s>
<s> I'll include a link to an image of a diagram of my current network layout. </s>
<s> I receive internet service from a wifi modem. </s>
<s> I have a wifi adapter that recieves that internet acces, and I share that internet through &quot;Lan 1&quot; on my pc. </s>
<s> To share with more devices I have connected Lan 1 via a crossover cable to the &quot;internet&quot; port on my WNR2000 router. </s>
<s> All of the other computers and devices connected to that router can access the internet and network completely with no issues. </s>
<s> My main pc, however, cannot access the network because of the way it is connected to the router. </s>
<s> I have tried connecting the main pc's &quot;Lan1&quot; to the router using the &quot;Ethernet&quot; ports on my router (as opposed to the &quot;internet&quot; port with crossover), but I cannot share the internet that way. </s>
<s> My solution was to run a connection from &quot;Lan 2&quot; on my pc to &quot;Ethernet 4&quot; on my router, in addition to the crossover connection. </s>
<s> unfortunately when i enable this connection, windows decides that Lan 2 is now the internet service, rather than the wireless connection, and i lose internet to everything in my network. </s>
<s> is there a way to force my pc to acknowledge that &quot;Lan2&quot; is for network acces only, &quot;Lan1&quot; is for sharing internet only, and &quot;wireless network connection&quot; is for recieving internet service only? </s>
<s> here is a link to a picture of my network layout on photo bucket: http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a326/Thermos017/MyNetworkDiagram.jpg </s>
<s> The GOLD WIRE is incorrect for most configurations. </s>
<s> For ICS the gold wire is removed and we use the &quot;Use the router as a WAP&quot; setup noted at the top post of this forum. </s>
<s> For ICS we could use only the gold wire but I can't comment on how to correct the trouble that would cause. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> what am i missing? </s>
<s> i don't see the &quot;Use the router as WAP&quot; setup you said was at the top of the forum... even a search didn't return anything that seemed useful to me. </s>
<s> could you link the post you are referring to here please? </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7589_102-264135.html?tag=contentBody;threadListing Then again you could use this search: http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=How+to+use+a+router+as+a+wireless+access+point Hope you find some information and get it to work. </s>

<s> thanks... i found that bout 2 seconds after i posted. </s>
<s> i didn't even get to follow all of the instructions on netgear when started to work. </s>
<s> it seems to work fine now (at least the ics is working right) still working on getting the network to show up on my pc, but i think that's another issue alltogether. </s>
<s> also, i can't access my router now. </s>
<s> it keeps trying to access the modem instead, even though i renamed the router ip to 192.168.1.99, it keeps showing me the modem which is 192.168.1.1. any idea why this is a problem? </s>
<s> i'll keep trying, and thanks for the help. </s>
<s> it was far easier to use than i was trying to make it. </s>
<s> This system of router as a WAP is not only done by many but as the router makers tinker and change the firmware the answers have to change. </s>
<s> For example my WNR3500 will automatically sort out the router as WAP trick and I can use its WAN port. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob </s>
<s> well, after several hours of pulling my hair out i finally got it working. </s>
<s> turns out that everything i had to do, i had done before, just not in the right order. </s>
<s> I reset my router to factory, set up my wireless security, and changed the ip of the router to match that of the modem. </s>
<s> I didn't make any of the other changes that were instructed in the above link (because they didn't work for me). </s>
<s> after disconnecting all of the pc's from the router, i turned off ics in windows (on my main pc), and bridged &quot;wireless connection&quot; to &quot;Lan 1&quot;. </s>
<s> Next i plugged &quot;lan 1&quot; into the router's &quot;ethernet 1&quot; (and left the crossover cable to the internet port disconnected). </s>
<s> once that connection was made and the ip updated the internet would stop working, and i'd have access to the router and network. </s>
<s> to fix that i disabled the network bridge, then repair the wireless connection. </s>
<s> after the repair i re-connected lan1 to the router, enabled the bridge and waited about a minute for the connection to be established. </s>
<s> the wireless connection icon in my task bar showed that there was no connection, but when i open internet explorer it was working fine (i'm using the app for the wn311t to connect to the wifi modem). </s>
<s> I don't fully understand how or why it worked the way it did, but i can for sure say that my wnr2000 router will not work for both networking and sharing internet when DHCP is dissabled. </s>
<s> hopefully my hours of frustration will save some other sap the time and hair pulling that i went through. </s>
<s> I now have my internet connection, full access to the network on all pc's, including the printer, and file sharing. </s>
<s> everything is working flawlessly now. </s>
<s> ok, now i'm gettin flustered... i checked that all of the network sharing was working, and it was... kinda. </s>
<s> When i go to &quot;My Network Places&quot; i can see all shared folders in my netowork. </s>
<s> I can navigate through all folders, but when i try to access a file it gives me an error. </s>
<s> whether i'm trying to copy a file, play media, or run setup exe's from shared folders it always gives me some kind of access error. </s>
<s> when i look at my shared folders under &quot;My Network Places&quot; it shows them all under &quot;the internet&quot; instead of &quot;local network&quot;. </s>
<s> anyone have any idea why this is happening or how i can fix it? </s>
<s> fyi... i've already tried shutting off all firewalls, verified sharing is on in network connections, confirmed that all files are &quot;shared to the network&quot;, not just the pc, and i'm not sure if i can or how to kill the router firewall (but if i understand right the router shouldn't firewall networked computers from each other, no?) </s>
<s> Sorry but firewalls in routers is a VERY NEW THING. </s>
<s> And most of them tend to be uncontrollable, bad, get in the way or don't work. </s>
<s> I turn them off. </s>
<s> The SECOND thing is that in a DOUBLE NAT setup, I doubt such file shares work. </s>
<s> Enough written. </s>
<s> The last BIG THING is the issues of workgroups, accounts and more. </s>
<s> From the posts above I can't tell if the account names/passwords on the machines in question are synchronized. </s>
