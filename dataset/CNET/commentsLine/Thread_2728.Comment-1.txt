i am buying a new computer.
i will be running a small web design company on the computer, playing somewhat highly graphical games, and doing a lot of multimedia work.
i need to know which is the better buy, and what will last me longer.
thanks.
intel  amd  oh, and i have heard that if i buy a very good graphics card for the intel, i would have great gaming and multimedia, is that true?
or would i need the amd?
