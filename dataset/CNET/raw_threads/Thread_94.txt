Nvidia GeForce 8800GTX 768MB. OR (2x)Nvidia GeForce 8600GTS 512MB Is it Good for the future games like Gears of War (PC)??? (by the way does the 2x double the performance of the graphics card? [is it worth it?]) and Processor - Intel Core 2 Quad Processor Q6700 (4x 2.66GHz/8MB L2 Cache/1066FSB) OR Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E6850 (2x 3.0GHz/4MB L2 Cache/1333FSB).

TechSpot article link comparing 650i to 680i I'd take the 8800GTX over trying the SLI configuration which is the (2x) which is literally trying to use 2 cards to get a boost but isn't quite double the performance if you look at the charts on Tom's Hardware for example. You may want to look at the 8800 GTS that may be an option. On the processor side, I'd go for the quad with the intention that in the next few years games will be able to use the more cores that it has compared to the dual core that while great now may not look so great if you play games that are CPU intensive.
