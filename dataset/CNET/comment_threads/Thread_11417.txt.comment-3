Bob's idea is good!
A used SCSI card on ebay $20~30.
New $90 XP will have drivers is it's an Adaptic card.
Now will drivers that came with your scanner work in XP since they were written for Win98???
I'm going to find out since I have a old UMAX scsi scanner and my 98se machine is realy old.
The only reason I'm going try is my scanner is a highend model and cost a lot of $$$$$ and has a transparency adapter.
I'll repost with results.
