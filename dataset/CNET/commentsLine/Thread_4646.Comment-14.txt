there is an issue with wep which some might call &quot;secured wireless&quot; in that even the mac can be spoofed, the wep key busted in 60 seconds.
your post didn't give the exact settings so i'll leave you with this.
try it like we ask in this forum's sticky.
for brevity that is, stock settings, ssid broadcasting and wpa.
