i have been having intermittent problems with my computer - stop errors for several different things, i uninstalled new programs that i thought might be causing the troubles, and often that solved the problem.
not sure if these are all related.
i installed a demo version of stuffit to open a file someone sent me, and it created some conflicts - so i took it off.
then webroot began having some problems with definition updates.
then began doing sweeps when i didn't ask it to, and didn't log that i had already done one two days ago.
yesterday, my computer crashed and i got messages of address line failure and that the system memory had changed.
then i got cryptic message that a valid definitions file could not be located.
i looked at the event viewer and discovered that webroot perhaps was the culprit, so i removed it.
the system memory error messages stopped, and it appeared that things went back to normal.
i did scans with avast and alwil they have found no viruses or problems with the system memory.
my computer crashed again while i was working on photoshop (the only program running other than avast and zone alarm) this morning, and in the event viewer saw that there was an ftdisk error.
microsoft claims that they don't have any information about it and googling the error brings up too many different fixes that involve a lot of work - i'd like to see if i can narrow it down a bit.
there are suggestion from memory stick to power supply failure, to boot-sector viruses.
the power supply and mother board battery were replaced within the last year.
i am working with xp on a dell dimension 8200. i realize that it's an older model, and will be buying a new computer next year - i just can't do it right now.
and yes, i've backed up.
many thanks, adrienne
