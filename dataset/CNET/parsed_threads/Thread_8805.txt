<s> I want all of you to stop buying computers and start building them. </s>
<s> HP,Dell and everyone else dont make their computers with quality. </s>
<s> Notice how these computers have many hardware problems. </s>
<s> And they come loaded with trial software. </s>
<s> Listen Building a computer is easy and its alot cheaper. </s>
<s> I garentee no hardware problems(unless you screw up something) Why do you take abuse from these big companies? </s>
<s> Go to newegg.com Tigerdirect.com Or go to your local frys electronics. </s>
<s> The parts you need: Motherboard Power supply Hard Drive dvd drive ram (memory) processor operating system disk screen Video Card The only problem is you you have to do your own product support </s>
<s> I'm finding too many home builders beating their heads against walls or going bald with home builds and Vista. </s>
<s> Why is Vista causing what used to be fun to be more trouble? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Because you cannot put cheap or old computer parts when building a vista pc Everything in my computer is new technology from the motherboard to the cpu to the video card. </s>
<s> But i did test a pre realease version of vista on a old socket 478 pentuim 4. </s>
<s> The only thing that did not work (which I fixed by the way) was sound and ethernet. </s>
<s> Fixing hardware problems in vista is very easy for me. </s>
<s> hey buddy, just curious how long u been building PCs ? </s>
<s> its kinda funny that i feel exactly the same way (pple should just build PCs not buy them) and i'm gonna build my first one a couple of months from now !!! </s>
<s> that's so true - HP and Dell totally rip you off and with hella cheap stuff too </s>
<s> I have been building computers for about a year and a half now. </s>
<s> I have a friend of mine who built a computer which he still uses thats currently 10 years old and still runs. </s>
<s> Dont expect a dell or hp to last that long! </s>
<s> Here's the specs for the PC I wanna build. </s>
<s> Notice any compatibility issues ? </s>
<s> Any comments/suggestions for the build ? </s>

<s> ya, not too many games have support yet for 64-bit, but i'm gonna get the Vista Ultimate Retail pack which contains both 32-bit and 64-bit, first try the 64-bit, if it works for me, i'll keep it otherwise remove it and install the 32-bit. </s>
<s> i can always keep the extra 4 gigs of ram and the 64-bit Vista for the future and install it when i see that drivers are out. </s>
<s> whaddaya think ? </s>
<s> i used to play a lot of NFS 3 Hot pursuit and Half-Life Game of the year, and Cricket 97. and in the last year or so, not 1 day has passed when i didn't play CNC Zero Hour so i guess i have to say Ya, I'm a gamer ! </s>

<s> I think you should try ati, they have just come out with a new dx10 card and their drivers for vista work fine, btw i only play games on consoles like xbox 360 not on computers though u should try this board http://event.asus.com/vista_ready/index.htm http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=3&l2=11&l3=307&l4=0&model=1558&modelmenu=1 </s>
