Occasonally it will open when the computer has been off for a while but after 15-20 minutes it becomes unresponsive. I was wondering what would cause this problem?

Pull the cover off of the case. 2. Software. Uninstall InCD, Roxio's DirectCD or other such and see if that cures it. A known issue. Bob
