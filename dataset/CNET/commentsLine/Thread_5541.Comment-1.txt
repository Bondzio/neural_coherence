i would like to add a second hard drive to my computer.
i have an old hard drive that used to be in my computer which i replaced with a faster bigger one.
when i removed it i never removed the operating system or any of the information on it.
i just took it out.
i would like to use it as a storage drive for my machine.
the same copy of xp is on both drives.
what do i need to do to install it?
