I recently built a new computer and installed windows 7 ultimate x64 and have 4gb of ram installed initially. Recently I bought more ram (the SAME exact type of ram) and when I put them in the computer the computer randomly shuts down, but when I take them out it stops shutting down. Any ideas?

The Computer Help forum and Windows 7 forums are well read, lots of folk there. You picked a good forum to ask this the first time.
