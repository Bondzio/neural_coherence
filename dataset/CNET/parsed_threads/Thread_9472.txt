<s> I am having big problem with Dell A920 all-in-one printer/scanner/copier. </s>
<s> Before I installed it, I had Adobe Pro 6.0 installed (which turns docs into PDFs) and an HP Deskjet Now, after installing the A920, my Adobe print/make PDF function has disappeared and my HP Deskjet (both say &quot;no printers installed&quot; when try to use them) Seems the A920 has taken over/conflict?? </s>
<s> Then when I try to uninstall and reinstall Adobe Pro it says &quot;Error 1920 Service Print Spooler (Spooler) failed to start. </s>
<s> Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start system services&quot;. </s>
<s> Which is ridiculous - I am the administrator of the computer/only account. </s>
<s> I have never in twenty years had one device wreak such havoc on my system! </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> Can;'t find anything in the Dell knowledge base! </s>
<s> Thanks PS Running Windows XP SP2 </s>
<s> PSS - now in MS Office apps (Word, Excel etc) when try to open docs I get error &quot;Compile Error in didden module: AutoExec&quot; !!! </s>
<s> This A920 has created a nightmare!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307410 </s>
<s> I will try that. </s>
<s> I finally rooted that evil Dell A920 off my system but still have big Spooler issues. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on my post here: http://forums.cnet.com/5208-4_102-0.html?threadID=337825%20&tag=unsubscribeForm;tracked-disc </s>
