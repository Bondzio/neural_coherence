<s> Ok this is very very urgent. </s>
<s> i am helping my friend get a Custom configured PC. </s>
<s> He wants to know which to choose either a Pentium D 3.4 Ghz or a Core 2 Duo E6300 the lowest one I think 1.8 Ghz. </s>
<s> If someone can have benchmarks or something please tell me which is better in performance. </s>
<s> The pD has a 800Mhz FSB and the Core 2 Duo has a 1066 or something Mhz FSB. </s>
<s> Another thing he is asking me that if he had to make a decision, between getting an Nvidia 6200 with a Core 2 Duo OR an Nvidia 7600 with Pentium D, which would be better assuming prices are similar. </s>
<s> I told him that if he didnt need gaming graphics, he should go with the Core 2 Duo combo but I would go for the better graphic card. </s>
<s> Please i need an answer very fast. </s>
<s> I will checkback in a few hours (2-4). </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> faster than p4 3.4ghz in most benchmarks. </s>
<s> the pentium d 945 is a bit cheaper though. </s>
<s> the geforce 7600gt is a much better card. </s>
<s> if any gaming is to be done, i'd pick the p4-d + 7600gt over the c2d + 6200. </s>
<s> Thnx anymore replies </s>
<s> CPU CHARTS at www.tomshardware.com </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> just what i was looking for for not just this but many things </s>
<s> Core2Duo should be the cornerstone of any system goin forward. </s>
<s> The NVIDIA 6200 is a pretty weiner card though - I would go with a mid-range 7600 instead or even an older ATI 1800 depending on price. </s>
<s> Many of the tradeoffs you are asking about really require more detail on what your friend is prioritizing going forward. </s>
<s> With NVIDIA getting to release the new 8800 cards expect some price compression in coming weeks on the other cards. </s>
<s> Frankly the best time to make thes decisions will come during the frenzy the day after Thanksgiving. </s>
<s> I dont think he will want a super hgh end pc so I configured this for him. </s>
<s> He needs a family PC with some games on it. </s>
<s> Basic computer. </s>
