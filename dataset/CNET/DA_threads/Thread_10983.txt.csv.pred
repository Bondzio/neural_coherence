1.1.1	Good day folks , OK , I am working on a PC that delays in powering up .	St
1.1.2	The system is a Gigabyte GA-8IK1100 & P4 running on XP Pro .	St
1.1.3	There is a G force 5900 Video card that is failing .	St
1.1.4	The fans do not function and the temperature gets overheated .	St
1.1.5	My multimeter also measured the voltage a little above 5 and 12 volts .	St
1.1.6	The card takes 12 volts and a power error message also displays during the OS boot up .	St
1.1.7	I advised the client to buy a power supply of 480 W. I installed it and other areas of performance improved .	St
1.1.8	I eliminated the main components as the problems .	St
1.1.9	I also changed the battery for CMOS .	St
1.1.10	I took out the video card and put in mine and it worked instantly , but the problem still persisted after a couple of boot ups .	St
1.1.11	That problem ?	Ques
1.1.12	A delay in booting up .	St
1.1.13	The case wires work , but it could be a short in electricity from the front case to the motherboard .	St
1.1.14	I can not get into that part of the case itself .	St
1.1.15	OK , your turn folks ... ... .	St
1.2.1	do you mean that it takes too long for the POST to complete or does this part function ok but Windows is n't starting ?	Ques
1.2.2	If it 's Windows , the number of variables grows significantly .	St
1.2.3	Where exactly does it hang .	St
1.3.1	& quot ; do you mean that it takes too long for the POST to complete or does this part function ok but Windows is n't starting ?	Ques
1.3.2	If it 's Windows , the number of variables grows significantly .	St
1.3.3	Where exactly does it hang. & quot ; No .	St
1.3.4	The PS aspect is the issue or if a hardware component is causing the power to delay in booting .	St
1.3.5	POST was a good guess .	St
1.4.1	You asked what could be causing the power to delay in booting .	St
1.4.2	The total boot process I am referring to is from the time power is applied until the OS is ready to use .	St
1.4.3	The system could hang during the POST or afterwards while loading Windows .	Sug
1.4.4	Is it during one of these processes ?	Ques
1.4.5	What I am reading is that you might be turning the PC on but but seeing a delay in when power is actually applied .	St
1.4.6	This can only be determined by monitoring the PS voltages as they sequence up .	St
1.4.7	Once present , the POST should begin .	St
1.4.8	If you use a CRT monitor , you may not see evidence of such but maybe hear a beep from the speaker .	St
1.4.9	During the POST , hardware detection is made and compared against what 's been stored in the setup .	St
1.4.10	Discrepancies can cause delays .	St
1.4.11	Other delays can be due to waiting for hard drives to spin up ... especially if the system is set to automatically configure the drives at each restart .	St
1.4.12	Memory testing takes time .	St
1.4.13	A change in the battery might set the MB to defaults .	St
1.4.14	One of these defaults might be to do the longer memory check .	St
1.4.15	Sorry if I 'm misunderstanding your question but still getting no vision of the sequence of events you are witnessing .	St
1.5.1	Unplug USB things .	St
1.6.1	Hi again , thanks for the input .	Polite
1.6.2	I understand the POST and what is being checked .	St
1.6.3	The delay I refer is when the power button is pushed in about 5-6 times before actual power .	St
1.6.4	I have to push the power button for 5-6 times before it comes on after I take away the cord .	St
1.6.5	Once the power is on , it reboots in the normal time .	St
1.6.6	I tried to determine if the video card ( which can make a system not function properly ) is the cause by changing video cards .	St
1.6.7	I saw a difference but it still took 5-6 times of pushing in the power button before the system could began the POST .	St
1.6.8	Once the system loads the POST is fine .	St
1.6.9	I have tried to adjust the BIOS RAM and temperature to see .	St
1.7.1	Try pressing and holding the button for a short if you 're just giving it a quick push .	St
1.7.2	There are BIOS options as to how to respond to that button .	St
1.7.3	Check them .	St
1.7.4	That 's a momentary switch that 's just supposed to latch the power supply .	St
1.7.5	They do go bad .	Sug
1.7.6	you can probably find the MB connector for that switch and test it from there .	St
1.7.7	It will be one of the front panel connections usually all grouped together .	St
