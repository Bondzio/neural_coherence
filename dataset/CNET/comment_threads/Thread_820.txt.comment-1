I installed a Brother MFC 420CN successfully on my Netgear wireless router that both my iBook and Windows ME PC can see.
But after installation, a Brother HL-1435 laser printer and an HP Photoprinter 1100+ &quot;stopped&quot; according to Printer setup utility in OS X Panther.
I tried reinstalling the Brother laser driver but the iBook doesn't see it under USB in Printer setup utility.
Any suggestions would be appreciated!
(iBook G4 running OS X 10.3.9, Netgear wireless G router, Brother MFC 420CN networked printer, local Brother HL-1435 laser printer and HP Photopriner 1100+ using USB)
