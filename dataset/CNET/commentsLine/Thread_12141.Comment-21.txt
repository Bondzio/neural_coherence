gee stone, it is strange that the only athlon 64 cpu that has less than 512kb l2 cache is the 3300. that cpu is apparently a socket 754 that amd must have made specifically for hp and compaq as i can't seem to find it listed in the boxed cpu's that amd sells.
believe bob made a good definition/relationship in his post.
here is some info i put together from several sources: desktop processors contain two forms of cache memory level one cache (l1) and level two cache (l2).
l1 cache is the first place the processor looks for the data it needs.
if the data can t be found in the l1 cache, the processor next turns to the l2 cache.
this is the second, and final line of defense for the processor.
this is the last form of high-speed memory that the processor has access to, after the l2 cache the processor next turns to system memory, and following that, the worst case scenario: the system hard drive.
each additional stage introduces more latency, and thus, reduces performance.
additional cache allows the processor to hold more data internally for quick accessing.
if the processor cannot find the data it needs in cache, it must venture out into the main system memory in order to find it, which increases latencies and dampens performance.
adding extra cache is a fairly simple and efficient way to increase processor performance, although doing so makes the processor more expensive to create and increases the size of the processor core.
therefore, its important that the processor s memory subsystem is capable of keeping it well fed with data (especially as clock speed rises).
