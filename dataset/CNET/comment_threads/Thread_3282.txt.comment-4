Further to my original post.
I was contacted on Monday of this week and told the pc would be despatched to me the following day Tuesday 15th April.
I was again contacted on Tuesday 15th April and was again told by Sebastian that it would be despatched to me on Wednesday 16th.
I rang them this morning to see if it was worth waiting in to receive it.
Guess what?
Its still in the workshop.
It is now over eight weeks since I paid for this pc and it is still with Alienware.
