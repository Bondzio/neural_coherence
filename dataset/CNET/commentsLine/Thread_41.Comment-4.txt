&quot;only choose the 4 pin unit if you have the 4 pin plug connected to something in your pc, otherwise you do not need it.&quot; there may be extra connections that are never used.
you didn't reveal if the 3 pin is used on the old setup.
sadly, i haven't found the service manual for that model, but did find the note and clue above.
