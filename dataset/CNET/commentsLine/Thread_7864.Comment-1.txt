i have a motherboard (asus p4pe-x) that supports pc3200, which gives the machine a faster front side bus (fsb).
i originally began with a single pc2700 - 512 ram.
i bought two 256 ram sticks of pc3200, and removed the pc2700.
my question now is, i have three slots for memory, can i run pc3200 w/pc2700?
