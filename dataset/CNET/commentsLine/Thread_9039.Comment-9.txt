these are the discussion boards for cnet members.
if you want to feed back to the cnet writes, find an article and look for the email links.
but my question is still, if you found an unit from your list that met your spec, why didn't you buy it?
i have run into many of these &quot;artists&quot; and they want the ipad with that 1024 level digitizer for 99 bucks.
they always tell me &quot;they'd sell millions.&quot; sorry but as it turns out, the market is not there and it's a lot more money because of the volumes.
