<s> Hi, i had a major problem with my computer recentley, it got some virus and it totally ruined the whole computer so i had to wipe the hard drive and restart the computer from new (like brand new from the shop!) </s>
<s> The thing is i had lots of personal things on the computer like 100s of photos, college work ect ect that i dont have anywhere else, is there anyway the computer would still have these on the system?? </s>
<s> Is there any software that can be used to track them down on the computer or are they gone forever?! </s>
<s> cheers, if anyone can email me at partydrummer83@hotmail.com i would be very thankfull </s>
<s> There is a program called SequoiaView which will scan whole drives- or parts there-of and you can see what sort of files are left with any kind of integrity, that one of the rescue softwares might unearth for you. </s>
<s> I have it just for the curiosity value.... </s>
<s> the less likely that you will have success. </s>
<s> The formatting left the old data clusters, in effect, marked available for use. </s>
<s> Thus anything that you install/download on the disk will overwrite clusters tha may contain some of the data that you are looking for. </s>
<s> Of course, your reinstall of Op Sys and programs probably over wrote many clusters. </s>
<s> Viri usually can be cleaned without regormatting. </s>
<s> Next time search the Virus forums before taking such drastic action. </s>
<s> Too bad you didn't ask this before you wiped the computer, now it is almost definitely too late. </s>
<s> When you have the type of problem you describe you can easily get the data off by putting the drive in as a second drive in a working system and copy the data off, it is quite safe to do this type of thing, since almost no viruses pass around in data files. </s>
<s> The one thing you need to learn, and hopefully others will also learn from this, BACKUP BACKUP BACKUP. </s>
<s> If you had used a CD-RW drive to backup your data you would not be hurting now, with the cost of a CD-RW disk in the 50 cents range you need to rethink your backup procedures. </s>
