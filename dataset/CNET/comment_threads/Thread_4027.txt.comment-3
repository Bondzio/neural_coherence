Thank you Jackintucson, It has been &quot;no no&quot; area thus far, but I am going to try it and shall report.There is an &quot;Audio device&quot; in the &quot;Features Setup Page of the BIOS Setup Utility,which enable /disable onboard AC'97 audio chip whatever it means.
I have tried once before, unsuccessfully, to update the BIoS once before, but could not find the correct number of the M/B on the Matsonic web site, this time I shall persist a bit more.
Thanks for help.
Thank you very much.
