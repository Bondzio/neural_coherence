it's not, it's a spiral and you give the impression that you're not sure which way to go if you copy the hd export the problems , format and copy back import your old problems , you gain nothing assuming the problem is fixable, have you tried a repair install of xp?
basically, fix the existing problems, then copy your hd jonah .,
