<s> Hi there I want to wirelessly connect 2 routers together to connect parts in my house (large house) where the wifi signal is weak from the main wifi device and I need some help on how to set this up. </s>
<s> Router #1 is the new Apple AirPort Extreme (2013) plugged into an ADSL modem in the lounge. </s>
<s> Router #2 is a Netgear R6300 and is in the downstairs bedroom. </s>
<s> How can I connect these 2 wirelessly to make the downstairs bedroom and other rooms downstairs have a strong connection. </s>
<s> I don't want to run a wired connection due to logistics. </s>
<s> Both routers are 802ac so I presume the 2 routers will have a strong connection between them with 802ac and the beam technology built in. </s>
<s> But I need to know how to set up each router to make this possible? </s>
<s> And also do I connect to router #2 (Netgear) with a LAN cable into my downstairs computer or will that be able to distribute a wireless signal to seperate devices downstairs ie computer/ipad/iphone?? </s>
<s> Ideally I would like to connect my iMac via a cable but also be able to use my iphone and iPad downstairs aswell off of the Netgear router via wireless if this is possible? </s>
<s> I have been reading a few forums and believe you can bridge routers or set them up as access points but I need some help on the specifics on my set up please! </s>
<s> Any advice will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Maybe you could do this if the netgear was on the internet connection since from what I read the apple router can be a repeater (that's no bridge.) </s>
<s> From what you wrote I doubt you want a bridge but may want a repeater. </s>
<s> As in all these setup the repeater is placed halfway from the source to the final destination. </s>
<s> I've lost count how many times that they put the repeater in the room that had bad coverage. </s>

<s> The tip about pulling the WiFi back to 802.11g is almost a trade secret. </s>
