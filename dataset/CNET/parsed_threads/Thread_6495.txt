<s> ok i built my current desktop about 2 years back and its having problems and i want to upgrade anyway. </s>
<s> my current specs are amd athlon X2 4200, asus A8N-SLi deluxe, 1g ram, pny geforce 7800gt, 250gb-500gb-100gb hard drives. </s>
<s> for my new setup i was thinking on a amd phenom X4 9600 and msi k9a2 platinum but after reading a few reviews i am a little hesitant. </s>
<s> i am a die hard AMD fan but hey... i gotta go with what performs. </s>
<s> so what do yall think? </s>
<s> i dont game alot but i do occasionally play flight simulator x and a few others. </s>
<s> i mainly encode and edit pics, vids, music. </s>
<s> i want something that has the power when i need it. </s>
<s> not much on overclocking but i have messed around with it. </s>
<s> im just looking for suggestions. </s>
<s> any help appreciated. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> which was a good processor. </s>
<s> I also have the ASUS A8N-Sli. </s>
<s> But when I upgraded about 6 months ago, AMD was clearly not the processor to buy. </s>
<s> Based on what I've read recently about Phenom, believe it's same today. </s>
<s> My advice, try the link below and go from there. </s>
<s> Armed with the CPU names, you should be able to find other reviews and articles that should be hitting the stores soon. </s>

<s> thanks for the reply and the link. </s>
<s> not sure exactly whats wrong. </s>
<s> i had 3 hard drives go out in a months time. </s>
<s> a 2 and a half year old sata Maxtor 300gb was first to go. </s>
<s> then a 100gb Seagate ide hard drive, then my 500gb Seagate ide hard drive. </s>
<s> the 500gb was just a few months old. </s>
<s> thats all in a little under a month. </s>
<s> that cant be a coincidence. </s>
<s> my guess is somethings up with the mobo but i dont know what would cause that. </s>
<s> any idea? </s>
<s> thanks, John </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> its the one that came in the case i got so its probably not a very good one. </s>

<s> i was planning on changing it when i built it but i never got around to it. </s>
<s> it seemed to be working fine. </s>
<s> that might be it, ill look tomorrow. </s>
