1.1.1	There is always static on my VOIP phone calls and it is bad .	St
1.1.2	The service provider has not been able to resolve it , and I think it may be something in the wires or in my house .	St
1.1.3	I get the static with the wireless phone and the fax phone .	St
1.1.4	I had the same problem with my land line ( long since dropped this service ) .	St
1.1.5	Is there a way to stop this noise ?	Ques
1.1.6	Setup : Cable modem from Motorola ( 9yrs old ) Lingo box ( that I take around the world with me ) Panasonic 5.8 gigahertz cordless phone Fax modem also connected No land line connected Phones not connected to any wired lines .	St
1.2.1	Did you try a corded phone with the lingo ?	Ques
1.3.1	The first thing to try as bob pointed out is a corded phone .	St
1.3.2	I assume if you travel with the box you have something to plug into it .	St
1.3.3	If you have the software loaded you could also try to make a call from your PC ... pretty much eliminates everything but your connection and your modem .	Sug
1.3.4	Although if your modem is not a ROUTER then both devices have their own IP .	St
1.3.5	Noise on VoIP calls is mostly caused by packet loss but unlike data it can not retransmit the information .	St
1.3.6	VoIP also will drop packets that arrive too late ... ie jitter .	St
1.3.7	This is fairly involved to test but if you would ping from your PC to the first address within your ISP network you could check your connection .	St
1.3.8	You want to see little or no loss and the the time to be consistent , DIFFERENCE between the numbers is jitter and voice does not like much over 100ms but even 50ms can be heard .	St
1.3.9	If you see a issue maybe you can get your ISP to fix it .	St
1.3.10	Lingo uses a protocol called 729 to encode the voice this does a good job of compression but is much less tolerant of packet loss than say vontage which uses g711 which send 4 times the data on average .	St
1.3.11	I use skype and it use its own secret encoding which seems to work even on very bad connection .	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.4.2	I have tried wired phones plugged into the box with no help .	St
1.4.3	Skype is crystal clear .	St
1.4.4	I wonder if it is some interference from outside signals .	St
1.5.1	With the corded phone you have eliminated most everything .	St
1.5.2	You have the lingo box itself , your router , your connection to the internet .	St
1.5.3	If it work other places then it is most likely your internet connection .	St
1.5.4	Although something could interfere with the circuits inside the lingo box it is unlikely Getting your ISP to fix it is a issue .	St
1.5.5	They will first deny there is a issue and then try to say they provide no quality of service in their contract .	St
1.5.6	Unfortunately the next step will be to do the ISP job for them .	St
1.5.7	That would be to use a tool like wireshark and capture the data so you can actually see the jitter .	St
1.5.8	Even though wireshark has nice things tools that will let you listen to a captured call it still take a large amount of knowledge of VoIP to pinpoint a problem .	St
1.5.9	You other problem will be to find a way to capture the data in the first place you need to get between the lingo and the router .	St
1.5.10	I really wish skype would license there their method ... but then again I get paid to fix broken VoIP so maybe not .	St
1.6.1	Since you move from place to place with it that means you can dismiss it as your ISP issue .	St
1.6.2	HOWEVER even my standard POTS phone has some static .	St
1.6.3	It 's not a perfect system .	St
1.6.4	TODAY I 'm encountering folk that expect High Definition phone connections .	St
1.6.5	Skype delivers that !	St
1.6.6	Bob	St
