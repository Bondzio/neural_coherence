I was wondering how you connect two nvidia cards w/ SLI. I was looking on Newegg and the picture says there is an SLI connector on the bottom on the opposite side of where you connect it to your PCIe slot. So how to I link them together is there a cord or something? Also what is the highest amount you can have connected through SLI? I was thinking of buying 2 1GB cards and SLI them together could I do that or is there a limit? Thanks ahead for the help, Will

Most of the SLi compatible motherboards come with an SLi bridge included. You can get 2 Nvidia GeForce 7950GTX2 cards, which have a Gigabyte of memory and 2 chips on the one card. Having two of these in SLi creates Quad Sli, and requires a compatible motherboard, power supply, a big enough case (the cards are long) and another SLi bridge. Alternatively, you could buy a single 8800GTX card, for about 3/4 of the price of the Quad SLi. A single 800GTX card beats a Quad Sli setup. http://www23.tomshardware.com/graphics.html?modelx=33&model1=606&model2=608&chart=199
