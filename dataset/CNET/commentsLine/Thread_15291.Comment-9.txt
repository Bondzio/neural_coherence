clear this up; &quot;it's not a name brand pc&quot; are you saying this is another mtrbd.
than before?
did you do a fresh install of the os from scratch with all the new parts?
if you're trying w/o the new install, that maybe an issue as previous installs and/or drivers conflict.
having a socket 939 also tells me it's a dated mtrbd.
which is no longer provided out there.
if you're saying it worked before but now telling me it's a different pc, well it's not the same, is it.
you're throwing a curve ball in there and if you didn't wipe the hd to do a fresh install as i stated it gets hosed, one way or another.
i can't tell fully from your posts, which is why i asked about details.
