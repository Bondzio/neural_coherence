<s> I noticed that when I played music on my computer, the sound would slow down and then speed back up to the proper speed. </s>
<s> Then it would do it again and again until it would almost be locked into the slow speed. </s>
<s> I checked to make sure everything was working properly (speakers, all sound applications such as iTunes, Media Player, system sounds) and then went to work on the sound card drivers. </s>
<s> I have a SoundBlaster card. </s>
<s> I contacted Creative and they told me to &quot;clean sweep&quot; my SoundBlaster Live. </s>
<s> I followed the instructions that they gave me. </s>
<s> Everytime I reinstalled everything, the problem persisted. </s>
<s> My lastest attempt has rendered the speakers completely inactive. </s>
<s> The only sounds that I have are the computer's beeps. </s>
<s> Device manager says that the soundcard in there and working properly. </s>
<s> But, I cannot play any sounds and the rest of the computer shows that a sound card has not been installed. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> I am pulling my hair out. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Goto the device mgr. </s>
<s> and check for red/yellow flags are present for sound. </s>
<s> If none, then I suggest further to &quot;de-install&quot; the card, power-OFF, and remove the card. </s>
<s> Power-ON and then allow system to finish booting and once done, shutdown. </s>
<s> Re-insatll the card(try another slot) and check connections, etc. </s>
<s> and power-ON once done. </s>
<s> It should see new h/w and allow it to install itself or direct it to the drivers source(make dir/source of latest drivers). </s>
<s> It should work or attempt at a better rate. </s>
<s> If it doesn't work, either you have a stuffed h/w system or a s/w conflict. </s>
<s> Also, too many resources being used by the system, clean/reduce them or try that before any de-install steps above. </s>
<s> You may want to check the system services and determine what you really need. </s>
<s> Check at http://www.blackviper.com for hints/tips on services. </s>
<s> Hope this helps... good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks Willy. </s>
<s> Looks like I now have plans for the weekend! </s>
