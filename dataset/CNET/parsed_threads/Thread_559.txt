<s> Im looking for a graphics card that will transmit a 1080 signal to my 50 inch LCD TV from my blu-ray drive. </s>
<s> Will the DVI to HDMI adapter put out 1080 onto my Samsung 50&quot; lcd? </s>
<s> Any suggestions i will be very greatful thank you. </s>
<s> but it won't include any audio. </s>
<s> get a card with hdmi output for simplest setup. </s>
<s> i suggest this $50 sapphire radeon hd 4550: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102819 </s>
<s> $50 seems a little cheap? </s>
<s> NO? </s>
<s> I had planned on spending about 200$ anything better around that range? </s>
<s> It came with HDMI output. </s>
<s> Not sure why I'd spend more than that. </s>
<s> a Radeon HD 4870 or a GeForce GTX260 Core216, but that's overkill probably </s>
<s> GIGABYTE GV-R487D5-1GD Radeon HD 4870 1GB 256-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready CrossFire Supported Video Card - Retail thanks for everyones help! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> there's no need for an expensive card. </s>
<s> the hd 4550 is intended for use as in home theater pc and its blu-ray acceleration is identical to the hd 4870. </s>
<s> also, that card is very long so keep that in mind when installing it. </s>
<s> and the card can be very noisy so be prepared to flash the bios or install a utility to control the fan speed. </s>
<s> would that be solid as well for gaming. </s>
<s> Ill do a little gaming, grahpic design and blu ray movies. </s>
<s> didnt see the title. </s>
<s> I plan on gaming some. </s>
