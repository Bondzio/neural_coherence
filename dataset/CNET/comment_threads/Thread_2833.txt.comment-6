It wasn't that I ignored your suggestion, I just remembered once before that Netgear had asked me to unplug the connection for a while and it helped then.
So I tried it again and it worked well for the laptop, but the desktop got too low a signal to access the Internet.
If it works so well with the laptop, I figured it is not the router, but something else.
I will check again with Netgear and give them my updated information and ask about updates.
Thanks for your help.
