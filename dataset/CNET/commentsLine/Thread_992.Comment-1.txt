i'm at a loss... i really am.
i don't remember when this problem started, but vista home basic won't display certain web pages.
the model is an emachine (walmart special)which i bought in february this year 2007. the model # is w3611.
it is completely unmodified, i de-crapified it, and installed grisoft avg and it updates automatically.
the only two webpages is doesn't display (so far!)
is  and  .
i've been told both these pages are heavy with java script... just this evening i installed the latest java update, but there's no change.
when it won't load the page, i mean it won't load.
i type in  and i get this:  i can click on the correct link (at the top) and then i get the screen that says: internet explorer cannot display page.
then gives some options for &quot;fixing&quot; it.
there's no connection problem either.
i have wireless and it's always 'on'.
i have just this evening discovered i can bring up a cached page, but it has aspects of the page that's missing.
here is the link:  i checked my security settings, and they are not too high.
if someone can shed any light on this problem, please do.
i really need to get information from the ftc website... thanks!
