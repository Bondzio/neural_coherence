hi everyone, my question is pretty straight forward.
the cell processor that is used to power the playstation 3, does anyone know if i could purchase that processor as a stand alone and not as part of the ps3.
it is an awesome processor and a gigantic step forward, i would like to build my new pc around it, if it is available for purchase.
thanks and happy thanksgiving.
