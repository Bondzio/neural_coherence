Specs at http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4500S/specs.htm#1101572 But I see the killer issue here.
It's running on the i845 chipset and SDRAM.
While that was a fine value solution back then, this is a DRAG CHUTE on performance of the CPU.
Do not invest more than a &quot;value meal&quot; into this box.
