ok first off my pc was running fine until i added new motherboard and 2 4gb after installation pc started just fine but when i go to install some updates they fail.
also when get all types of error codes when installing disc based games and virtual iso games.
on occasion i get a blue screen of death but havnt got that since i installed windows 8. i even checked each memory stick by manually removing 1 byb 1 and testing each.
i have ran error fix programs driver programs and even ran programs to test my hardware everything checked out.
so my only conclusion is its my old ass proccesor.
if anyone could help it would be highly appreciated.
