i found an old i266mmx with 64mb for 99 bucks (a compaq armada.)
what this proves is that for the cost of old edo ram (unless found cheap) that you should start hunting down other laptops.
this thing would be like you trying to take a model a on a freeway or to the local repair shop.
the limits were not the address space of the cpu but economics of those days where 64mb could cost well past a few 1,000 bucks.
being that no one could put that much ram in, the designs were made to only support 8 to 16mb for many boards.
in closing, i'd only explore use with dos/win3.1 or damn small linux.
