1. they're not &quot;dead&quot;, it's just the dvd-rom functionality.
2. it happened to my friend at the same time.
3. remember, it's happening to the new ones too: a couple of weeks later i found a good deal on a sony dvd/cd writer, and it worked too, and the pionner still worked as well.
and then they both didn't.
but sure, i'll try the cleaner ...
