hi, so i have 2 computers.
a laptop and a desktop, but the laptop can connect to the internet just fine, no crazy stuff attached.
:cool: but when i head towards my computer, i see a 3-2 bar connection:( both the laptop and desktop are in the same room, and no drivers are giving a huge red light.
also, when i plug in a rear end network adapter, it seems to do nothing to help its range.
:huh: both computers run windows 8 pictures laptop's wifi imgur: the simple image sharer my desktop's wifi (in the same room) imgur: the simple image sharer laptop's drivers: imgur: the simple image sharer desktop's drivers: imgur: the simple image sharer also, if you would like to help me with another mystery, the desktop wouldn't pick up the wifi connected printer downstairs, or the headphones right next to the bluetooth adapter.
