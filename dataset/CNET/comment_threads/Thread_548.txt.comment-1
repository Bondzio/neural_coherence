I purchased an HP Pavilion a6110n which has 2.0GB of DDR2 SDRAM, and 320GB 7200-rpmSATA hard drive.
I called HP support on another issue, and was told I would have problems with my new pavillion because the Hard drive/SDRAM ratio was incorrect.
It should be 1.0GB of SDRAM to every 100GB +/- of hard drive.
IS THIS TRUE?
Should I return the Pavillion I have for something with a better ratio?
