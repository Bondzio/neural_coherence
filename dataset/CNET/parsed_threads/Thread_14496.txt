<s> I'm recently subscribed to Verizon DSL, and am attempting to network my 2 computers (a desktop and a Laptop. </s>
<s> I ran the home networking wizard in windows on both computers, and correctly installed the Westell Versalink router I received from Verizon, but when I try to send something from my laptop to my printer (connected to desktop), I get a printer not responding error message. </s>
<s> I am running Windows ME on the desktop, and XP on the laptop if that matters. </s>
<s> HELP!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> to the XP machine as a network printer, does it appear in the Printer folder? </s>
<s> yes, if I connect the printer directly to my laptop it works just fine. </s>
<s> &quot;yes, if I connect the printer directly to my laptop it works just fine.&quot; In order for the laptop to access a shared printer connected to another PC on the LAN, the printer must be: 1) Shared from the host PC 2) Added to the Printers folder on the remote PC as a networked printer with the path indicated as a network path, not LPT1. </s>
<s> I'm not real computer literate so i didn't understand what you meant but I'll try this and see if it works thank you </s>
