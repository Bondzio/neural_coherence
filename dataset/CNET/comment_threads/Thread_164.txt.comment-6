Once you have finished capturing your VHS stuff into iMovie, done any necessary editing and added titles or such, save the project and then share it.
Under Share, you will see an option to send it to iDVD.
Here you can add menu's, if necessary, and add a few bits and pieces to make it look like a &quot;real&quot; DVD when inserted into a DVD player.
Once you are set, hit the burn button and take the rest of the night off.
I usually leave mine overnight and it's ready when I get up.
Best not to be doing anything else when iDVD is rendering, compressing and otherwise doing its stuff.
Good Luck P
