I would like to upgrade but don't know what would fit into my cpu case. I have the Compaq Presario SR1050NX. I'm want a faster processor and better graphics if possible. Any suggestions?

HOWEVER, if you upgrade, it's also likely you need a new XP license. Hmmm, you're probably better off getting a new computer or building one yourself.
