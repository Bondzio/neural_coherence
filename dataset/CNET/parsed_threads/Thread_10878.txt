<s> Hello all, I am using an Intel D875PZB board and have used the &quot;Intel Active Monitor&quot; to monitor the temps and voltages on my board since it was new. </s>
<s> I also used the &quot;Intel Desktop Control Center&quot; to modify fan settings and tweak other settings in my BIOS. </s>
<s> Both are really good programs but I have lost the use of them. </s>
<s> I was experimenting with a program called &quot;Motherboard Monitor&quot; and since installing that, I can not get the Intel programs to work any more. </s>
<s> I tried UNinstalling the &quot;Motherboard Monitor&quot; and REinstalling the &quot;Intel Active Monitor&quot; but I get the message that says &quot;No Sensors Detected On This Board&quot;. </s>
<s> The sensors are there and functioning because I can REinstall &quot;Motherboard Monitor&quot; and get readings from that but I don't like that program because some of my voltage readings are incorrect and I would rather use the &quot;Intel&quot; programs anyway. </s>
<s> I would like to know if anyone is aware of the changes that &quot;Motherboard Monitor&quot; might have made that cause the &quot;Intel&quot; programs to fail. </s>
<s> I am hoping that I can reset things back so I can use the &quot;Intel Desktop Control Center&quot; most of all. </s>
<s> I tried a System Restore but the Intel programs still don't function and fail when I try to REinstall them. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks </s>
<s> I should have included that I am running WinXP Pro/IE6.0 with SP1 and all updates for SP1. </s>
<s> I can't think of anything else that may be pertinent to this situation at the moment but if I missed something, just ask... thanks </s>
<s> you could always try good 'ol system restore to when you first installed the intel utility </s>
<s> NIL </s>
