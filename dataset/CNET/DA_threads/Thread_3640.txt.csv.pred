1.1.1	Hi everyone, I recently purchased a 19&quot; Samsung 940NW widescreen monitor.	St
1.1.2	I assumed that my computer would have a resolution to cope with widescreen but of course no; that would be too easy!	St
1.1.3	I really don't want to have to buy a new graphics card so is there any software I can download to correct the stretched images?	St
1.1.4	I think my graphics card is built into the motherboard and don't know how to find out if it isn't?	St
1.1.5	I looked under the Device Manager but there's nothing too obvious that is a graphics card?	St
1.1.6	Any ideas?	St
1.1.7	Thanks in advance everyone!	St

1.2.1	Just like http://techreport.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=713581&sid=4a1b45b108645ba9e0c333966c9d6ea0 you need to do that step and maybe head off to the display properties to tell it which monitor you are using.	Sug
