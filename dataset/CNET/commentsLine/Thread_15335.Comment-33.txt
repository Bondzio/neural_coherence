and let me say again, i'm no computer techie.
i've solved periodic problems by using vendor chat sessions and help.
but, thanks for all your help but most of you are not talking to the 75% of consumers who buy computers and have no courage to do what many of you suggest as &quot;easy&quot;.
i tried the msconfig route as suggested, and after the 4th time of starting my computer followed by &quot;you are choosing to start without the normal startup configuration...&quot; followed by a restart which takes another 5 minutes, i conclude i'm better off with the 10 minutes of startup i had originally with the junk starting up.
as far as add/remove programs; everytime i try that i get a warning message &quot;are you sure you want to do this - other programs may no run if you proceed...&quot;.
and i give up.
i agree with a number of reply posters who ask &quot;why are we getting this junk in the first place?&quot; why do the restore disks put this same junk back onto my computer?
why does michael dell, and his cohorts at gateway think that they can succeed long term by shafting the 75% of computer users who are paying for his equipment (and his yacht, and his basketball team, and his mansions)?
many of you talk about buying from a local assembler, but i'm afraid of that too.
who knows who this guy is?
i conclude i must buy from voodoo or falcon, even though i'm not a gamer, because they promise nothing on the computer but the os and office.
i asked falcon if i could have norton is 2007 and they said, &quot;if you want it, we'll buy it retail and install it for you and send the original disks for your use&quot;.
now that's commitment to the buyer, not to some software vendor that they are in bed with.
yeah, i'm going to spend about $1k more, but you know what - 4 years later i'll be happy that i did.
by the way, for all of you who suggested solutions, i regularly run regscrub, defrag, diskcleanup, and norton scans.
no big noticeable improvement.
