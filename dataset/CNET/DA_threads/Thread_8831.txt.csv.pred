1.1.1	I 'm going to upgrade my computer soon .	St
1.1.2	So i 'll have : AMD Sempron 3300 2GHZ 1GB RAM Sony 16x/48X DVD ROM Drive Nvidia GeForce 6600 I 'm wondering what games I could run smoothly with these specs ?	Ques
1.1.3	I 've heard that Sempron is better than Celeron for gaming .	St
1.1.4	I 'm particulary interested in playing FPS 's , Half Life 2 , Far Cry , Halo etc .	St
1.1.5	Could I play these smoothly ?	Ques
1.1.6	( I 'm doubting I can play F.E.A.R ? )	Ques
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	All .	St
1.2.3	Here 's why .	St
1.2.4	I would only need to trim back on the display pixel count or size from x by y to 800 by 600 or maybe a few less effects .	St
1.2.5	2 .	St
1.2.6	Not all .	St
1.2.7	Here 's why .	St
1.2.8	Many of those games are programmed to take advantage of hardware that has yet to be designed .	St
1.2.9	bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob , very..	St
1.3.2	In depth .	St
1.3.3	I 'm still deciding on what graphics card to get , and the RADEON X700SE seems appealing..	St
1.3.4	Still , could all change .	St
1.3.5	Any other opinions ?	Ques
1.4.1	But I 'd skip the sempron and head to any 64-bit CPU offering .	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	I 'm on a budget	St
1.6.1	havent played far cry but i have played halo , half life 2 and splintercell chaos theory on a system built around a AMD 64 3200+ and an x700 pro and they 've all done quite well .	St
1.6.2	so do i surmise from your post that the 6600 isnt the GT model or above ?	Ques
1.6.3	if it is a Gt model most would reccomend that over the x700 pro .	St
1.6.4	half life 2 i run into some issues with parts of the HUD display being out of place if i use i think anything more than 2x anti-aliasing .	St
1.6.5	the other one i can run without too much trouble .	St
1.6.6	as far as perfornance goes , i run 1024x768 and there 's only 1 spot in half life 2 where the graphics lag any and that 's a spot where the game is having to render the sky as well as a swirling fan underwater .	St
1.6.7	aside from that spot all the rendering is quite good and doesnt affect gameplay at all .	St
1.6.8	have yet to try the game with HDR as i cant remember if that 's a possible option in the game but in the small episode valve released to showcase it when it was on i had some studders in the display but we 're talking very intensive graphics rendering here .	St
1.6.9	sunlight reflecting off wet sand and off moist rocks those sorts of things ... chaos theory i 've also got at 1024x768 and occasionally when i 've got night visions on it 'll studder a bit .	St
1.6.10	havent had any problems with halo as i dont think it 's really pushing my hardware at all .	St
1.6.11	as far as f.e.a.r goes you should have no problem playing it at the lower end of the graphical spectrum .	St
1.6.12	the min requirements are well below your specs so you should be safe .	St
1.6.13	it takes a 1.7 celron you 're more or less 3ghz equiv sempron , 512ram you 're 1024 , 64 vid memory , you 'd be 256 with an x700 pro .	St
1.6.14	not sure aobut the sound but i would imagine any audigy 2 card would do the trick quite nicely	Res
