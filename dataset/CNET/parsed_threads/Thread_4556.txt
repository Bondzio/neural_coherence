<s> Your Pavilion ZE4200 - found the computer listed on HP.com - HP's memory configurator listed a Pavilion ZE4100 and a ZE4300, but no ZE4200! </s>
<s> - Crucial.com (memory company) didn't have it listed! </s>
<s> - Kingston.com (memory company) has upgrade info. </s>
<s> Here's what Kingston has to say: - two memory slots - maximum memory is 1GB (512MB x2) - type: PC2100 (266MHz SODIMM) See for yourself: http://www.kingston.com </s>
