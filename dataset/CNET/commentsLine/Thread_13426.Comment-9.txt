this problem seems very similiar to mine i fixed it by: 1. entering my award bios setup (pressing del on startup) 2. select intergrated perepherals (press enter) 3. select sis onchip pci device (press enter) 4. select usb 2.0 supports disabled 5. f10 to save and restart i dont why it worked but it did
