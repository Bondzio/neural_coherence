1.1.1	This hopefully will be an elementary question for some on here.	St
1.1.2	I am attempting to set up 2 networks within an office location without a dedicated server computer.	St
1.1.3	As is, the first network has no DHCP enabled, is in the 10.x.x.x range and sits behind a dlink wireless router(of which a cable modem connects).	St
1.1.4	There is a hardware print and file server on this network.	St
1.1.5	Users of this network access the internet readily and also each other.	St
1.1.6	The 2nd network would offer customers and affliates of the office a wireless connection (192.168.x.x range) with minimal security, for ease of connecting, and would NOT allow communication with the 10.x.x.x network.	St
1.1.7	Purchasing an additonal ip from the cable company is not an option unfortunatly, as it seems most secure.	St
1.1.8	I have an AP with DDWRT which allows for creating virtual LANs, but I believe these VLANS are still on the same programed ip range as the main/default LAN of the network.	St
1.1.9	Is this the answer to my prob?	St
1.1.10	Please help before I have to invest in rogain.	St
1.1.11	Many thanks in advance.	Polite
1.2.1	Sorry but I can't explain this in this small box but the double nat (see google) seems appropriate here.	St
