Hardware that might have a bearing on the problem Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce 8400 GS Monitor: Acer AL2216Wbd I received mine on Friday from Newegg and hooked it up. I have both the analogue and DVI connections operative, and have checked the problem on both feeds. The first thing I noticed was the colors seemed rather blotchy and blocky on any photos I have, and do process a lot of photos on my PC. Also, when I go to a mostly white screen like the Explorer panel, there is a very marked magenta color caste and the whole screen has a softish salmon colored look to it. This is when the screen is viewed dead square on. If I raise up and look down at a 20 or 30 degree angle the color caste diminishes quite noticably, and it shifts more to a cooler, more acceptable color. I have run the reset on the monitor and I have run through its own color calibration wizard, none of which really helps much at all. I've worked with various monitors for years, and the only time I've seen color like this is when its been on VGA monitors that are years old and on their way out (just to give the more experiended here an idea of what the display problem actually looks like). My wife has a Hann 19&quot; LCD panel, and there is no similar problem at all on her display. OK - its a different brand, and its smaller, but I do expect a similar output, which I am not getting at all. I've been using a 19&quot; CRT display up until now, and this &quot;upgrade&quot; has been a very sad disappointment to me. I understand that CRT can often give a much better image than LCD, but still, this Acer LCD panel has received very high ratings. Before I RMA it, I wanted to hear if anyone has any similar experience, or can confirm that their 22&quot; Acer panel does not display similar faults. I don't have a second one to use for direct comparison, so this is the next step. It would also help if you post process a good amount of photos successfully on the Acer and can let me know how the monitor performs for that. Maybe I am expecting too much, but even browsing the web in general makes me shudder at some of the color renditions on this particular unit.

See http://www.google.com/products?q=barco+lcd+display&btnG=Search+Products&hl=en&show=dd&checkout=1 These are much better at proper color without the effect you noted. Remember you will pay a little more for this. -&gt; If this is not your goal (color perfection) try shopping locally where you can test the displays and don't forget to get a HUEY.
