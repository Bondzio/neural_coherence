<s> I've been tasked with giving users in our main office the ability to print to our other buildings. </s>
<s> Right now the external offices connect via Citrix to access our database and files, but I'm assuming I want to leave Citrix out of this. </s>
<s> The external offices already have a static ip address for the cable internet connection and the printer is connected to the router in that external office. </s>
<s> I'm having a difficult time finding solutions online. </s>
<s> What do I need? </s>
<s> Print Servers at the external locations? </s>
<s> Some sort of VPN voodoo? </s>
<s> Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> This is an all windows environment, all workstations are XP and the servers at the main office are Windows Server 2000 (for Citrix) and Server 2003 for everything else. </s>
<s> It seemed like magic to some but we had no interest in putting a printer on a print server or &quot;share&quot; or other solution because the printer drivers would kill our support staff and budget. </s>
<s> Here's how we solved it. </s>
<s> We created a network share and if you put a .PDF file there it gets printed then deleted from that directory. </s>
<s> This is not an offer to write in detail about the batch file that runs this print job but to share we knew the pitfalls of attempting a printer share. </s>

<s> What I did to enable this was installed the printer at each external office as a network printer (via ethernet cable to the router). </s>
<s> Then I went into the router settings and set up port forwarding for Port 9100 to go to the printer's IP address. </s>
<s> From my main office I used the Add Printer Wizard, selected Local Printer, created a TCP/IP port, and put in the static IP address for the external office. </s>
<s> I had to have the drivers at the main office to install them easily. </s>
<s> This works fine now. </s>
