this is a forum about pc hardware, not about iphones.
so please repost in our iphones forum:  and be sure to make your problem clear.
what you tell now definitely is unclear: - iphone 3g hangs at apple icon - can't detect at all - the rest iphone can detect did you already go back to the shop where you bought it for warranty?
or are you asking here first?
