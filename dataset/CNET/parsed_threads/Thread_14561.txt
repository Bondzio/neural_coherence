<s> hello i've an AMD Athlon 64 dual core processor with Asus motherboard and XP professional i cannot work in turbo c or borland c compiler the window opens and minimizes when i run it, i really need to work on c. please help me </s>
<s> Machines with 1.0GB RAM? </s>
<s> I see you didn't tell much about your PC. </s>
<s> Why make others ask you for that? </s>
<s> In other words why not make your first post a good one? </s>
<s> i need help. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> why cant I open the turbo c in my computer. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> instead it tells me that &quot;16 bit DOS SUBSYSTEM&quot;. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> any body? </s>

<s> . </s>
<s> please. </s>

<s> I realy need a reply. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> even . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> me . </s>
<s> .my computer tells me that&quot;16 bit DOS SUBSYSTEM, , but i guess. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> theres better way for that. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> why don't you try to find a newer version in turbo c which can run in 32 bit DOS SUBSYSTEM. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> Im already doing it right now. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> Time after time I see the OS damaged. </s>
<s> You didn't tell too much so all I can offer is http://www.google.com/search?q=16+bit+DOS+SUBSYSTEM Bob </s>
<s> In http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C I read that the latest version is from 1990. </s>
<s> Are you sure it's compatible with Windows XP? </s>
<s> I've got my doubts. </s>
<s> My suggestion is to find another (compatible) C-compiler or a another (compatible) OS, like MS DOS 6.0 or thereabout. </s>
<s> But that might not run on current hardware. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I can vouch for that. </s>
<s> However the subsystem error is caused by malware most of the time. </s>
<s> Sometimes I find it's an owner with registry and other cleaners but it is often fixable. </s>

<s> Q: write a program tha asks for values from the user and find out which number was entered the most number of times (mode) and how many times this number was enetered. </s>
<s> assumed that the numbers entered are postive and in increasing order. </s>
<s> example: 112222233-1, display the mode is 2 and its frequency is 5 hope you can help me... tnx a lot in advanced.. </s>
<s> i have been ecountered that problem before. </s>
<s> but actually you just use for loop and array. </s>
<s> that's all i can remember. </s>
<s> homework and school assignments here. </s>
<s> That's something you must do yourself: learning by doing. </s>
<s> Be sure your program had a good way of handling: - empty input (just return) - invalid input (like @1A' or 877) - short input (like 0) unless, of course, you're allowed to interpret &quot;assumed&quot; or &quot;assume&quot; as &quot;There's no need to check it and the program may give erroneous result or reach an abnormal end if these precondition isn't met&quot;. </s>
<s> Ask your teacher. </s>
<s> A few more remarks: - The suggestion above of using an array is useful, but - given the order - not necessary. </s>
<s> It should work without array also. </s>
<s> - The assignment is about numbers (each on it's own line until you enter a negative one). </s>
<s> Your input example is about digits (all on one line and ending with a non-digit). </s>
<s> - Is it necessary to handle floating point numbers (like 3.14 or 3.14E13) or can it be assumed the numbers are positive integers? </s>

<s> Hellow, , i just want to ask a favor. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> i realy need this code on how to make a command to printer using turbo c. . </s>
<s> please if anyone knows this. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> please submit your post asp. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I don't think this is a good question for a forum that's listed under Hardware in the index. </s>
<s> Moreover, it's not clear if you mean c or c++ (that should make a difference for the coding you need). </s>
<s> And can you tell more about what you mean &quot;make a command to printer&quot;. </s>
<s> Please repost with this additions in Computer Help. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Did you go to Krugle.com and see if it's there? </s>
<s> Hi I am snjay and I have problem with running C programing with AMD Athlon 2.60 GHz Processor, what should I do for run the C program with same processor.please help. </s>
<s> Since Turbo C was DOS based you can now get Microsoft's Virtual PC and run DOS in that and Turbo C will run in the VPC. </s>
