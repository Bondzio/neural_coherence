1.1.1	Hi , I 've had a problem several times in the past where I 'm trying to move or save files to my freecom ext hard drive and I get the message & quot ; disc full & quot ; .When checking this I find I have in fact still got 32gb of free space .	St
1.1.2	Can anyone help me shed some light on this please , thanks-John	Ques
1.2.1	If so , the top directory can be full .	St
1.2.2	Fix ?	Ques
1.2.3	Use subdirectories .	St
1.2.4	Also , a FAT32 drive ca n't hold a file over 4GB in size .	St
1.2.5	No fix is planned .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply Bob , no its ntfs , though I dont really understand that .	St
1.3.2	What I did in the end was to transfer everything on that drive to another then format the drive in question and now it seems to hold whatever I put in ( up to its capacity of course ) It really puzzles me that this should happen so thanks for any input -- John	St
1.4.1	Even though NTFS sidesteps that number , some applications ca n't handle too many files in the root or top directory .	St
1.4.2	But it looks like it was corrupted somehow .	St
1.4.3	Did you try CHDKSK on it ?	Ques
1.4.4	Bob	St
