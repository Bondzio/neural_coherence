I have no idea how to change any of that, I looked through everything in my BIOS and I couldn't find anything, I found a Hardware Diagnostic Tool in there, and that didn't help me any.
They probably changed the BIOS a lot in the last 5 years to make up for things like this, but thats what I get for having a BIOS that was made over 5 years ago
