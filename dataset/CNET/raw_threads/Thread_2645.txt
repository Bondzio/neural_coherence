My PC seems to pick up a series of local connections none of which are picked up by the Mac (which picks up an entirely different array of networks). Moreover, when I try to connect to one of the unsecured networks showing on my network, I am told that &quot;You are connecting to the unsecured network...&quot;; I hit &quot;Continue anyway&quot; which only triggers my computer to rescan for networks in range, bringing up the same list as before. Needless to say, I can't connect to the internet through any connection, let alone our own home connection. What can I do to help my computer find the right networks and connect? Please help.

While we pass over it quickly you should name your router so you can find it quickly. Also with all the issues that abound with unsecured networks you find we write to use WPA and if you can, WPA2. That should help. Bob
