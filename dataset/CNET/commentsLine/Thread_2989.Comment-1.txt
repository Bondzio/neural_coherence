hi.
when i turn on pc i sometimes have a long wait before the message &quot;date and time are not set...f1 to enter setup or f2 to load default settings.&quot; sometimes i set the date and time then save and exit...all is well.
sometimes i load defaults...like i said this is not all the time.
my mobo is asus a8v-vm se.
i have scanned my hard drive for errors and defragmented and all is well.
the xp installation is only 3 weeks old.
occasionally i get freezes when i am browsing or working and have to restart and go through all the f1 or f2 stuff again.
occasionally on boot i get a message saying a file is missing, again a power off and power on brings me back to the f1 or f2 screem.
is my mobo nearing the end of its days?
battery?
