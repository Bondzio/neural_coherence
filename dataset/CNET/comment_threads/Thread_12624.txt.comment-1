I have internet through cable provided by Comcast.
Ever since it's installation I am unable to get wireless access to my IBM R51 laptop (windows xp), although LAN works perfectly.
I have NETGEAR cable modem gateway CG814WG v2.
Whenever I try to connect wireless, it initially shows that it's connected followed by the message &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot;.
However, the wireless works perfectly in my other DELL notebook.
Please help me find a solution.
