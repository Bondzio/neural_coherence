i build my own pc as well and i was hearing a buzzing noises a few weeks ago i formatted the drive using a bootable disk since it wouldn't let me format any other way.
the problem went away after the format and it is working well now if this fixes the problem do that instead of buying a new hard drive most likely you have bad clusters and the format will find and mark those clusters.
the defective hard drive in my case was my slave drive which was a 40 gig western digital drive my primary drive was a 40 gig sygate drive.
i recently build this sempron 3200 computer with 512 megabytes of ram i was looking for a stable second computer for my sister and it works well.
my primary computer is my emachines 6212 and from now on i'll just buy an emachine instead of building one its just too much time and effort and money and the e-machines are making better computers ever since gateway bought them out.
