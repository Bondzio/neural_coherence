in reference to vms world, if i remember right it would boot the #1 drive id'ed as such.
you could re-id drive 1 by relocating the plug to another drive, thus it became a bootable provided it was bootable besides being mountable.
as for the windoze world it just doesn't work that way in the os.
there is or was a h/w fix in which you had drives physically mounted and in effect, swapped the id for drive c via a switch, so if you had 3 drives, toggle the h/w switches you could swap drives that way.
but, since you're looking for a cheap cure, i thought you'll find the cost acceptable provided it is available still.
further, sinc you have a compaq system as noted you have the bios offering a limited boot sequence.
basically, to go further you need a custom bios to offer anything that's now available to newer mtrbds.
but it will still look for drive c as it is physically attached via the hd cable.
new bios boot paths are either a hd, usb device, or cd and scsi devices.
if you use scsi, you can swap a bootable hd as well as its id number, but it may try the 1st physical drive via hd cable to boot from then proceed to rest, again alot depends on the scsi hd controller in this respect.
in no way is your fix an easy one and you throw linux in the mix, i offer no cure for it, i'm too hazy on that topic for a clear answer.
good luck -----willy
