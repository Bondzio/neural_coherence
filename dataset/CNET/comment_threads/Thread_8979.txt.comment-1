I had installed the graphics card on my PC (emachines T3882) with an intergrated graphics card.
So i had set up the graphics card right and disabled the integrated one.
Then i went to their website to install a more recent driver which they said came out April 15, 2005.
Then after installing they asked me to restart and i did but after it started the screen was just black.
I could not see anything so to make it work i had to take out the nvidia card and i uninstalled the drivers.
now if i plug the card back in will i have to update the drivers?
Couldn't i just stay with the ones that came on the CD?
