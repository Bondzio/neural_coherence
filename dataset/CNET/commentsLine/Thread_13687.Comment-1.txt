i was ready to buy a 22 inch lg lcd monitor that doubles as a television.
it is 1080p ready and has analog and digital tv tuner.
i thought it was great when one of my collegues proposed to sell me his 36-37 inch lg tv second hand at a very good price.
will this be an acceptable/good computer monitor?
i have a hp 2510p notebook which i plan to hook it up to, will it work with it?
will it be any different with a regular lcd monitor?
will it have a glare problem if i do reading with it?
is it ok to buy a 1-1.5 year old lcd tv at half present market price?
would it be outdated in a general sense?
any tips to make it work at its best whether monitor or tv?
thank you.
