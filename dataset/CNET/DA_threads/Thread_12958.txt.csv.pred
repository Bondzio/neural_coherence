1.1.1	My father is in the market for a color printer to print high quality pictures from a Canon S60 .	St
1.1.2	I would like to hear from people in this forum , what they would suggest .	St
1.1.3	Right now we are looking at Minolta Magicolor 2430DL , Canon i960 , Epson Stylus Photo R800 and there are so many HP that I do not even know where to start ( though I will look at the Photosmart 7960 ) .	St
1.1.4	Am I missing anything ?	Ques
1.1.5	As for price , it is not a big concern , he just wants quality prints .	St
1.2.1	I have pictures from Epson C42 's and up on the walls at the office and home .	St
1.2.2	Would that be good enough ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Quality , looks like it came from your local photo shop ( walmart , drug store , etc ) and you would not be able to tell the difference .	St
1.3.2	Is that enough of a definition ?	Ques
1.4.1	I 'd have to use the glossy paper .	St
1.4.2	I do n't use the glossy paper since it 's under glass or acrylic .	St
1.4.3	In closing it does not look like what comes from walmart since its a slightly differenct technology .	St
1.4.4	But I will not go to said walmart since its great stuff .	St
1.4.5	If you want exactly what walmart would look like , then you can not use an ink jet .	St
1.4.6	You 'll look at dye sublimation printers .	St
1.4.7	If that 's what you want ?	Ques
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	My understanding , although I do n't claim to be an expert , is that while many & quot ; home & quot ; printers do a very nice job printing photos on glossy or matte photo paper ... the ink is n't the same as photo processing ink and eventually your home printed photos will fade .	St
1.5.2	Which is to say the pictures will fade faster than if you had them professionally processed .	St
1.5.3	Having said that , back up your home photos on CDs , make your glossy prints , and if you have to print them again in 5 or 10 years , so be it .	St
1.5.4	In my humble opinion the ability to crop and adjust the photos is such a big plus it outweighs any issue of permanence .	St
1.5.5	My HP Officejet 5510 all-in-one does terrific photos .	St
1.5.6	I wish the cost of ink cartridges were lower , but such is life .	St
