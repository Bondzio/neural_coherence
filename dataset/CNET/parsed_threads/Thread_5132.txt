<s> There's tons of different heatsinks out there several of which can face different directions of that gets in the way. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> I believe 'those cylindrical things just south of the cpu mount' is the heatsink for the northbridge on the motherboard. </s>
<s> not that side i mean the opposite side, the closest things to the cpu </s>
<s> Like I said, there tons of different heatsinks out there, and it wouldn't make sense for the manufacturer of the motherboard (Intel looks like) to make one that interfered with the placing of the heatsink. </s>
<s> i gave u the wrong link, heres the real one. </s>
<s> the one i posted above would deffinately not fit on my cpu because its my case lol: $21 cpu fan and heat sink: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835150082 </s>
<s> hahaha! </s>
<s> I was wondering why the case link was there. </s>
<s> I don't see anyway of telling simply by looking at the images though. </s>
<s> I would say go for it, but, if you're really not sure, it's not too hard to pick out a different motherboard. </s>
