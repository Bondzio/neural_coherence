look for the flexible ribbon-type bridges rather than the fixed ones, seeing as the hard bridges have to be the exact distance between the connectors on the cards, making it much more difficult to purchase a fitting bridge.
there is no difference between the bridges aside from length and material, but if you're concerned about a few picoseconds of latency, feel free to trouble yourself with locating a hard bridge.
