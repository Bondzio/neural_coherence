Yes I have set up group policy's and when they log-in to the work station its not restricting them.
I currently run a VT program in a Federal Prison.
So I have certain inmates I wanna restrict from certain things.
I also have tutors which are inmates and want them to have more flexability.
When I create a user and attach the group policy to them.
When they log in to the work station they are'nt restricted.
I can put a work station policy and restict everyone.
But I thought a group policy would follow with the inmates account to any computer he would log in on.
Hope this helps you understand better.
