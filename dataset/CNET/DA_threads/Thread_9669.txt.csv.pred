1.1.2	recently when connected to my computer , the light goes on , the disk rotates and all ... but computer does n't show any drive .	St
1.1.3	i have tried everything short of getting it replaced ( obviously coz i got data in it that i do n't wan na part with ) .	St

1.1.5	i have tried it with a number of friends ' computers , none can read the drive .	St
1.1.6	but if I connect it to a tv , runs fine .	St
1.1.7	any suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	What does Windows disk management say about the drive ?	Ques
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	If Windows PC 's do n't see the data , and the TV does see it , what about Linux ?	Ques
1.2.5	That 's free to try .	Sug
1.2.6	3 .	St
1.2.7	If no luck with Linux , see if any of the free data recovery programs mentioned in the top post of the storage forum can locate the data and copy it to some safe place , before you repartition the drive , Did n't they tell you that external drives are unreliable and only should be used for backup ( but not your only backup ! )	St
1.2.8	and transport of data between different device , certainly not for permanent storage .	St
1.2.9	That way , you never lose data , because you always have a permanent copy somewhere else .	St
1.2.10	Kees	St
1.3.1	disk management does n't show the drive either .	St

1.3.6	thanx	St
1.4.1	A TV connection has simpler demands for operation than a PC .	St
1.4.2	At least it should be when compared to each other .	St
1.4.3	The link I provide should give a clue .	St
1.4.4	What may happen is the file system or overall partitioning is done so the TV sees it while a PC expects as it wants the files and needs the ability to retrieve but show access to whatever needs are required at a higher level .	St
1.4.5	http : //www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/433963/all_external_hard_drives_will_work_properly_when_connected_tv_usb_port/ You may need a Linux type access to mount the ext .	St
1.4.6	HD and see if you can xfer the data , then reformat the HD as needed .	St
