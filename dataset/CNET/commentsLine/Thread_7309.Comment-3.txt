is this an msi board?
if so, about all i find is this.
unfortunately, you would need to be connected to get the driver.
their site is quite lacking but i wonder if you could find a way to borrow a nic and get a driver that works.
you could use their live update software to find drivers you need.
i wouldn't be surprised if motherboard drivers weren't needed in order to proceed to get other drivers.
in any event, you need to be on line and perhaps some friends borrowed nic could do that.
good luck.
