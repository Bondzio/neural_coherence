i didn't know it would be such a big deal... what would i have to do to the laptop?
or could i just use the wireless cell card and hook it up to my pc at home so it wouldn't involve my laptop?
i have a wireless router at home but it is not all that great, so i would need a switcher?
could i just turn on sharing and then run an ethernet cord from my laptop to the switcher?
if so, could it screw up the laptop?
thanks in advance for the help
