whether you choose linksys, netgear or any other brand, the best advice is to buy both the router and the adapter from the same brand and series.
also on my opinion i shall go with linksys or netgear, i have a linksys router at home and it's awesome, eventhough i've heard that netgear has an slightly better signal so that can be seen as farther range.
so choose the flavor brand you like the most but if you really want long range try using a g router with replaceable anntenas and replace 1 of the original antennas with an external omni-directional, that would increase a lot the signal reach.
also check other brands even as someone mentioned in here i've heard that hawking sells adapters and routers that can beat any other brand on long distances.
hopes that this might help.
