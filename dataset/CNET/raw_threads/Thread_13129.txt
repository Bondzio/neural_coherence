The last picture on the right shows where that extra power connection is: http://www.mvktech.net/content/view/3482/39/1/3/ If that is all ok, then I would try talking to the place you purchsed the card. It could be that your PSU is not adequate, but I would think you would be having other problems also if the PSU is overloaded.

If the gpu box/manual suggests a PSU rating, then you need that. Of course be sure all the drivers, etc. are installed right. The old drivers as well should be removed before the new video card was installed, it can cause conflict(s). tada -----Willy

The different characteristics of different cards are setup in the software. You might want to even go to the microsoft website and download the latest directx after you put in the drivers for it (I wouldn't even use the CD that came with it. I'd just go to nvidia.com and download the latest drivers from there). Also I'd check the bios and make sure the card is seated properly and plugged into the power supply. I got battle field 2 and that's a terrible game, imho. Call to duty 2 is way better. And now there's a call to duty 3.
