<s> Is it worth holding of on my next laptop purchase for the new core 2 chips, memorn from intel? </s>
<s> What is the benefit for waiting? </s>
<s> Will 64 bit make 32 bit obsolete? </s>
<s> There will be yet another better chip to arrive just after that? </s>
<s> thank-you for the response. </s>
<s> One more question, will 64 bit tech make 34 bit obsolete? </s>
<s> For vista will have both 64 bit and 32 bit. </s>
<s> Will there be a day when a 32 bit computer will not longer be supported by a OS and software? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You can't imagine the hoops I see our software jump through all because the CPU didn't do 64 bit integer math. </s>
<s> But for 99.9999% of users at this time that does not mean the end of 32-bit. </s>
<s> In fact, my PDA is 16 bit. </s>
<s> Since OS and such are still available for 8 bitters today, you may have to alter your question a bit to exclude non-Mac or PCs in general. </s>

<s> What will the impact be on mac. </s>
<s> They made a big deal about the G5 being 64 bit now their entire line is 32 bit excpet the power mac (mac pro). </s>
<s> &quot;Not much.&quot; There are some that will fret about this and that their machine will be obsolute overnight. </s>
<s> Mine go obsolete when I can't write the software for the tasks anymore. </s>
