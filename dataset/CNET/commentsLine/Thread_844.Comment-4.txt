hi bob thanks for this - very helpful.
my research so far suggests that the following models could do the job: microsoft surface pro - comes with pressure sensitive digitizer asus vivo tab - ditto i'm also looking into lenovo ones - and it seems the idea tab lynx and the think pad helix could do the job too, but i'm not 100% sure yet.
more research needed!
best tim
