this has continued to be a question mark for me, too.
dell does populate all 6 slots with 1gb sticks which is a real bummer - if i order now with 6gb and see that my heavy home video editing could use the full 12gb, then i would have to replace all 6 1gb dimms.
so that is a waste of the initial investment for me.
my question: if i'm running corel videostudio prox2, editing a large movie (45+ minutes), have multiple photoshop image files open, etc., could this system take advantage of the full 12gb of ram?
a previous poster recommended ordering with 6gb and monitoring usage, but i don't want to waste the initial investment by throwing all those away if i see 6gb is not enough.
