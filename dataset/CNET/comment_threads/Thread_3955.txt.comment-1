Yesterday, my little daughter dropped my memory stick and it probably didn't work any longer.
It was recognized on my computer.
But, every time I tried to open it, it could give me a message and asked me to format it at first.
But, when I attempted to format it, the computer would tell me the formatting process could not be finished.
Is there any way to retrieve all my files on this memory stick?
I still have something important on it.
Any idea could be appreciated.
