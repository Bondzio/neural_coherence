This should make the two Pcs see each other on the network. It could take up to 45 minutes for them to work. Or they may have problems seeing each other anyway. You can &quot;force&quot; one to see the other if needed, by using the address bar in Windows Explorer. Just type the path needed. If computer1 is named frontroom then type in the address bar \\frontroom\ and press ENTER. If the PC is on the network and is not blocked by a firewall, shared folders will show up, even if you can't browse to them.
