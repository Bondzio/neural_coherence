<s> Hi all, I have a cable modem wired to a Dlink DI-524 wireless router that sends the internet to various wireless computers in my home. </s>
<s> I want to buy a Canon iP4000R wireless printer but the Canon website says I need a wireless access point. </s>
<s> Do I already have that, or is that another piece of electronics I have to buy? </s>
<s> TIA, Eric </s>
