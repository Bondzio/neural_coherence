i have multiple backups.
1. the common usb hard disk.
i use syncback to automate my backup to that.
2. the now common dvdrw media.
my photo collection gets put on a set of rotating sets of media.
a little more time consuming but worth it.
my family gets sent a yearly copy.
3. a network copy to a secure server (i use openssh.)
4. and finally a few items i carry with me on the usb memory key.
