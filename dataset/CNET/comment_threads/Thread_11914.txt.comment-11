I have no idea what you did.
My flash disk is 1 GB, ~~ Properties show 650 MB used, 350 MB free.
In attempting to add ANY file, I recieve the error &quot; the directory or file cannot be created&quot; I have Win XP.
Obviously I was able to.
initally write on the disk and can read the existing files I created on it.
Could I have accidently changed the file sysyem ?
File System properties shows my &quot;C&quot; drive NTFS but the &quot;F&quot; Drive (flash disk) is FAT.
