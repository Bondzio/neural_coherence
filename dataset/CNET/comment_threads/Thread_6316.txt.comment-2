Almost any ON BOARD RAID is a crap shot if the drives will transplant.
In fact it rarely works making a fine business for those in the recovery business.
Given what's at stake, why didn't they make a backup?
Or were they lulled into believing by someone that RAID 1 was a backup?
And I see a mention of RAID 0.
With those I have yet to see but a few transplants over the years.
Folk try it and learn the bitter truth.
