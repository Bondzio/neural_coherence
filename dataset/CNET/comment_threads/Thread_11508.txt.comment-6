I am sorry but....
I would never buy another Netgear.
I have had problems with mine and the tech support I had with them was horrid!
I almost just forgot about accepting the new one and bought a different brand (after hours of trouble shotting...of which they finally decided was defective).
It was such a terrible experience I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
I actually had laryngitis when I called and the tech insulted me..and all senior citizens...thinking I was OLD and incapable.
My son also has similar problems with his and has to unplug the router and wireless and plug back in on a very frequent basis.
