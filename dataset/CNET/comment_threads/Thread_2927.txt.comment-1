We have a D-Link wireless 11N router.
We use it very successfully with an Acer Win7 wireless 11N laptop, and we now have a 2Wire brand 11B wireless ethernet adapter (to connect a BluRay player to the network, but not yet installed).
Will the addition of the 11B device slow down the speed of the separate 11N connection.
...just a general question about mixing 11x devices on an 11N router.
If I have to get model numbers I can do so.
(Actually, this question is for a neighbor.)
