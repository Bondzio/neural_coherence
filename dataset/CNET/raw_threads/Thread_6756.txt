Using Win XP, with Excel and Word (have eliminated all data files), and Norton 360. Constantly getting virtual memory notices, and insufficient drive space to perform updates. HD data indicates drive is full. I don't want to spend the several hundred dollars for a complete new, larger hard drive, and don't have the provision for copying all the executable programs from the old to the new anyway. I thought about getting a 1G SD card with USB adaptor and moving all the programs to it-in essence using the SD drive as my permanent drive. A local computer repair center said this wasn't possible, but I would like a second opinion. I am using this PC with a wireless card to primarialy check e-mail, but don't want to delete the Excel/Word/Norton stuff to free up space.

Turn off and back on System Restore. Go get and use CCLEANER. As to the SD Card, sure. But let's hope it's not your only copy of the files. Bob

In addition, I eliminated a large HP media file.In the process of doing this, Norton 360 (which said updates exceeded my capacity) basically deleted and re-installed. I also found a program (Lenovo Hard Drive Quick Test) which now shows the following results: Drive capacity 18.63 GB- Buffer 1.70 GB- volume capacity- 14.39 GB, used capacity 13.44 GB. Since the above actions, I haven't been on that PC much to see if the problems have been eliminated, but if the above figures are accurate, I now should have adequate memory for my purposes. RAM memory- per BELARC analysis shows 64 kilobyte primary memory-primary and 512 kilobyte secondary. Would replacing the 64 kilobyte be advisable?

I have three of these http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148073 I used this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817121006 to clone the small hard drives to the 160s. Seagate cloning software free at their site.
