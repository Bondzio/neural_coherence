1.1.1	I got two laptops running XPHome ( computer A and computer B ) I got COmputer A hooked up to the routher with an ethernet cable , and Computer B is wireless .	St
1.1.2	They both got internet connection just fine..	St
1.1.3	I ran the Create small home network wizard on both computers just as the instructions tell me ... ( the ones in weekend project ) The problem is that in Computer B when i go to My Network Places and click on view my Workgroup Computers i get this message : Home ( which is my workgroup name ) is not accesible .	St
1.1.4	You might not have permission to use this network resource .	St
1.1.5	Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions .	St
1.1.6	The list of servers of this workgroup is currently unavailable .	St
1.1.7	Also when i try to add my shared printer to Computer B i cant find it , it wont even find my workgroup ... so when I go to Computer A , i click on View workgroup computers , I can see them both there , but..if i try to click on Computer B i get this message : You might not have permission to use this network resource .	St
1.1.8	Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions .	St
1.1.9	network path was not found I followed the exact instructions so I dont know wats goin on , maybe cuz is XPHome and not XPpro ... ( my printer is connected to COmputer A , so i dont need to add it , but if i got add printer and look in network i do see my workgroup there , is only in Computer B where is not finding my workgroup )	St
1.2.1	be shared ?	Ques
1.2.2	And what about those firewalls ?	Ques
1.3.1	The problem could lay on the fact that you need user accounts set in both computers .	St
1.3.2	This is for networking Authentication reasons .	St
1.3.3	Try this : Go to computer A and set up a user .	St
1.3.4	To do this go to Control Panel and select User Accounts and then Create a new user .	St
1.3.5	The user name being & lt ; xxxx & gt ; and password being & lt ; yyyy & gt ; .	St
1.3.6	Then go to computer B and repeat the same step as in computer A .	St
1.3.7	The user name and password must be the same in both computers , so be carefull so you dont mistype it .	St
1.3.8	After this has been completed restart both computers and try to connect to each other through windows explorer .	St
1.3.9	Remember the Workgroup name should be the same in both computers .	St
1.3.10	Let me know if it works or if you have any other problems .	St
1.3.11	//X-tra TIP : Make sure all the firewalls are turned off even Microsoft firewall .	St
1.3.12	Once you have achieved a connection then you can troubleshoot the firewalls if there are any problems .	St
1.3.13	//More Tips at : //pacific_link @ gmail.com End Sub	St
1.4.1	I did exactly as you said .	St
1.4.2	And i still get the same message .	St
1.4.3	The firewalls are turned off on both laptops ... the Workgroup name is HOME on both computers but from Computer A for some reason it says Home is not accessible.. thanks for helping me	St
1.5.1	I had the same problem .	St
1.5.2	I finally disabled Norton Internet Security and then I could access either computer .	St
1.5.3	I then changed the settings in Personal Firewall to allow for the local Ports and Subports and everything worked fine and my Internet Security is turned back on .	St
1.5.4	Hope this helps .	St
1.6.1	The issue with the printer seems similar to what I experienced when I added my new laptop to my wireless network .	St
1.6.2	It could n't find the printer connected to the desktop even though sharing was enabled .	St
1.6.3	Finally , I just typed the printer 's network path into the box in the ''install new printer '' wizard instead of trying to browse for it ( ex : \\DELL\Epsonsty ) and it worked .	St
1.6.4	There were also a couple of other network resources I had to enter the path for instead of browsing .	St
1.6.5	I have no idea why .	St
1.6.6	This may have nothing to do with your problem , and I 'm not awake enough to address the bigger network access issue , but it may prove useful to you or to someone following this post who has similar issues .	St
1.6.7	Christa	St
1.7.1	Okay , I just went to the Dell desktop and tried to browse the network and got the same error message that you did , even though all the network resources ( which are on or connected to the desktop only ) are still accessible .	St
1.7.2	So I guess now I 'll sit back and watch this thread along with you .	St
1.7.3	Christa	St
1.8.1	I had a desktop and a wireless laptop on my network both running xp pro and had a perfect inter connection for a long time , even other wireless / wired laptops ( XP Homes ) could see and browse the network .	St
1.8.2	Then one fine day I started getting the same problem as you had , ( I guess I messed up with some settings ) my laptop couldnt acsess the desktop though the desktop could acsess the laptop .	St
1.8.3	I couldnt solve the problem and lived wth it .	St
1.8.4	( its easy ... just drop files from pc A to pc B , because pc A can see pc B and not viceversa ) Then one day I decided to try linux on my desktop and installed FC4 linux and removed windows ... . but after a couple of months I realised that I couldnt live with linux ( I am not a techie , I am a MD ) so I reinstalled XP pro again on my desktop and to my surprise the home network worked perfect as it always had .	St
1.8.5	What I am trying to suggest is if you have the time and are desparate to have a network , do what I did ( even though there must be a much much simpler way ! !	St
1.8.6	) back up , format your hard drive , and reinstall windows xp ! !	St
1.8.7	I cant assure this will work but it did for me .	St
1.8.8	Besides reinstalling windows will make your pc like a new one that works as fast as it did the day you bought it !	St
1.9.1	http : //www.security-forums.com/ I have found several answers to problems on this site in the past .	St
1.9.2	Maybe it will help all of you .	St

1.13.2	Thanks a lot for the help .	St
1.14.1	Hi there , I dont think setting up user names and passwords really matter , the network and workgroups you created are standards with xp for connection purposes only .	St
1.14.2	i.e shared internet .	St
1.14.3	If you want to acces files to and from different machines be they wireless or not , you have to share the folders , then right click your LAN icon / open network connections right click then open properties .	St
1.14.4	Now you should see the name of your ethernet card and the services its running / allows .	St
1.14.5	click install / protocols choose TCP IP version 6 .	St
1.14.6	You can also istall services Qos packet shedule .	St
1.14.7	You should be good to go now .	St
