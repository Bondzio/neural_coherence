<s> I have had TV Wonder card for many years and I enjoy having TV and a DVR capability on my workstation and laptop. </s>
<s> Now here is the problem: next year most over the air signals are going silent. </s>
<s> What I want to buy is anew TV tuner appliance that will take the cable TV cable and decode the digital channels and also decode and show the HDTV channels. </s>
<s> This appliance should be USB as the interface to the computers. </s>
<s> Is there anything out there right now that does this? </s>
<s> is there going to be ?? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> &quot;Includes portable ATSC digital terrestrial antenna for use up to 10 miles from an ATSC transmitter&quot; Since OTA Standard Def TV is going to be dead soon, look at something like this Hauppauge unit at http://reviews.cnet.com/tv-tuner-adapters/hauppauge-wintv-hvr-950/4505-9332_7-32135209.html and others from both makers. </s>
<s> Some may have you install something called an IR BLASTER to control the cable box. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> hey -- spoke with ATI, they dont have anything to offer. </s>
<s> again the problem is that Im *not* trying to watch over-the-air because that will be dead real soon. </s>
<s> I'm trying to use the cable signal that is already coming into my house. </s>
<s> ATI guy said that the problem is that the cable companies encode their signals so tht only their boxes can decode, forcing me to rent their large boxes for $150/yr. </s>
<s> Im looking for a better solution. </s>
<s> There are ATI and Hauppaugge offerings but maybe you thought you could record in HD. </s>
<s> I'm going to decline explaining that one since it's been done (a few many times.) </s>
<s> &quot;I'm trying to use the cable signal that is already coming into my house.&quot; I can do that today since they are not discontinuing the old RF channels. </s>
<s> Maybe there is some confusion there? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> that what I hear from the cable company -- only digital content coming over the cable next year. </s>
<s> do you hear anything differently? </s>
<s> What I understand is that the program is to redeem the OTA bandwidth and force most OTA TV stations off the air; At any rate, the number of stations one could receive is a very few whilst the number of cable channels is over 100 with all the specialty channels, etc. </s>
<s> OTA is dead which is why the feds are paying the stations so much to go dark. </s>
<s> Comcast has made no attempt to tell me I need 3 boxes. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The FCC isn't paying anyone. </s>
<s> They are freeing up the bandwidth for other uses, do your homework. </s>
<s> The &quot;box&quot; you want does not exist. </s>
<s> You either get the HDTV OTA USB device or nothing. </s>
<s> Noting the USB device will also tune the standard cable channels (I've done this), but not the HD or specialty content. </s>
<s> For that you need the evil cable box. </s>
<s> It's just the way it is. </s>
<s> I've been wiating for a high end graphics card with either DVI or HDMI input . </s>
<s> I'm still waiting. </s>
<s> thanks for all the responses. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> having reread the fine print, what happens feb, 2009 is Analog broadcasting ceases but digital over-the-air will continue. </s>
<s> But only channels from 2-36 will be allowed. </s>
<s> the FCC is going to auction off the recovered spectrum [from channel 37 upward] [wtih the proceeds from the auction subsidizing broadcasters to convert to digital broadcasting]. </s>
<s> we can all get $40 coupons to buy digital conversion boxes to change over-the-air digital into analog to feed the older tv sets. </s>
<s> so my goal remains -- I want a device about the size of a deck of cards or thereabouts that will convert my cable company's digital [and hd] signals to feed to my computer -- desktop or laptop. </s>
<s> and I havent seen such a device on the market either. </s>
<s> incidently, the motorola converter I get from the cable co has a firewire output port that the cable guys block though I have seen postings about how to hack the cable boxes. </s>
<s> I can't count how many times people confuse over the air changes and think it applies to cable. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> USB HD tuners on the market and more mfrs are coming out with HD versions of their PCI and USB2 tuners. </s>
<s> Just google USB HD. </s>
<s> Be aware that HD is a performance hog. </s>
<s> Make sure you can return it if not satisfied. </s>
<s> Wonder if you had great success with your SD tuner. </s>
<s> The delay in channel switching always bothered me. </s>
<s> Also look into Slingbox Pro. </s>
<s> Many, many reviewers are very happy with it. </s>
