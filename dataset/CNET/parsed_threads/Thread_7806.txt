<s> I'm building my first PC which will be an HTPC connected to my HDTV. </s>
<s> Prime concerns are noise and ability to play 1080P movies off HDD. </s>
<s> My question is, what do I need to consider when building from parts? </s>
<s> I think I made sure all parts would work but am I missing anything? </s>

<s> Not sure which RF keyboard/mouse I'll use, maybe one with a trackpad to keep it simple. </s>
<s> Does anyone see any potential issues with my setup? </s>
<s> Seems straightforward but I'm a PC builder noob. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help in advance! </s>
<s> I did this years ago and your list is fine. </s>
<s> But I went back to simple less power and wallet hungry solutions like the Apple TV, Boxbee and Roku. </s>
<s> The clutter is less and it's all good. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I was looking at Boxee, AppleTV, and Roku (no internal storage); PopCorn Hour A-210, Dune HDI, PS3, and XBox (not a perfect fit for one or another reason and GUIs received some complaints); and small form factor HTPCs like Asus EEE 1021, ZBox AD-02, and others with AMD Fusion E-350 APU (expensive for what it can do). </s>
<s> I'm probably going to pull the trigger on the purchase in a few days and appreciate you looking the config over. </s>
<s> be able to transcode on-the-fly and playback existing AV formats with the sandy bridge setup. </s>
<s> Don't need 4GB but if cheap, won't hurt. </s>
<s> Gskill not my favorite brand. </s>
<s> Consider a larger case with side fans for better ventilation, otherwise CPU and PSU fans will become noisy if they work too hard. </s>
<s> Throw in a BD reader so that you have a straight answer when a visitor asks &quot;so how do you play Blu-Ray in this thing&quot;? </s>
