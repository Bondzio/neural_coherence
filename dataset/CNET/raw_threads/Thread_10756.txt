For example, the web cam must have no less than 2 megapixels. So, I plan on buying an external webcam. I'm very familiar with Macs but I don't want to spend any more than necessary (less than $600), so I won't buy a Mac. I have XP SP3 through bootcamp, but I'm still learning the basics. I want a setup that will give me the least amount of complications or trouble down the road. I know that I'll need a high speed internet connection, more than 3Mbps. Does anyone have any suggestions or any information to help me narrow down the choices? Also, are there other quality brands of webcams besides Logitech?

I would look on newegg.com for webcams, the customer reviews do help.
