I want to get new RAM for my notebook, and I've noticed that there can be quite a big difference in price for the same type of RAM, but from different companies. Some big brands, such as Kingston, can be up to 70 dollars more expensive than the ones that are Generic. What is the reason for this price differential?
6067	1	59961	711730	711609	ksoiehawo	1/24/05 8:26 PM	1.10659836E12	another thing...	on this website: http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configurator/modelsinfo.asp?SysID=17853&mfr=Toshiba&model=Satellite+P10&distributor=0&submit1=Search it says this: KTT3614/xxx (266) and KTT3311/xxx (333) are both supported for this system, and can be mixed, but will only run at 266MHz no matter what is installed. Does that mean that no matter what type of RAM i use, it will run at 266 or does it mean if I mix different types, it will run at 266?

6067	5	59961	711883	711730	JamesJ	1/24/05 10:34 PM	1.10660604E12	Re: another thing...	&gt; Does that mean that no matter what type of RAM i &gt; use, it will run at 266 or does it mean if I mix &gt; different types, it will run at 266? Doesn't quite mean either. I assume the motherboard has a maximum FSB (Front Side Bus) speed of 133, which is doubled to 266 for DDR memory. So that's the maximum speed the RAM will run, even if it's capable of going faster (eg. 166/333). If you put in slower RAM (eg. 100/200), I've heard that it will slow the bus down to that speed, as opposed to trying to run at the higher speed (eg. 133/266), but I've never actually tried running RAM faster than its rated maximum speed. Similarly, if you mix RAM with different maximum speeds (eg. 100/200 and 133/266), both of which are supported by your motherboard, the faster RAM may be slowed down to the lower speed. Again, I can't speak from personal experience, but my guess is that that's what would happen. So for your specific example, I'm assuming that the maximum FSB of the motherboard is 133/266 and they're saying that you can use either 133/266 (aka PC2100) or 166/333 (aka PC2700) speed RAM. The 166/333 speed RAM will presumably just run at 133/266 instead. For example, I'm currently running 512 MB of PC3200 (200/400 MHz FSB) and 256 MB of PC2100 (133/266). The PC3200 just runs at the PC2100 speed, which is the maximum standard (ie. not overclocked) speed of my motherboard. As for your original question about the differences between different brands of memory, I suppose to some degree you get what you pay for, but I've used several different brands and had few problems, so I generally just go for whatever happens to be on sale. If you're going to be overclocking, better quality, or simply faster, RAM might be more important. Hope this helps. James

Name brand ram is &quot;expected&quot; to deliever and usually does at its rated use, plus *MAYBE* above and beyond, in other words, its the best they provide. While generics do work well within thier rating, don't expect them do so once out of that. Not that users do this and/or push the issue but a dividing line is made. Plus, namebrand ram is tested more rigourously and more likely to be rejected if not up to par, while generics tend to skirt that within reason. If so, namebrands also provide &quot;top of the line&quot; ram which offer extreme service or the absolute best for that model of ram, once you compare pricing of that with any generic, there will always be a difference, excluding any competive pricing. As for your laptop, get a namebrand as laptop tend to be hot running beasts and having a better ram will help. Plus, consider any &quot;lifetime&quot; warranty, read fine print may come in handy should ram fail. good luck -----Willy

6067	8	59961	714050	713993	Steven Haninger	1/25/05 5:34 PM	1.10667444E12	Value RAM, as I understand it	is just a manufactuers modules that didn't pass certain testing required for more critical purposes (such as for dual channel use) but is ok for general use. There will be quality assurance testing of all modules before they are sold. Some won't be good enough to sell at all and must be scrapped. This costs the manufacturer money. I would have to think that offering their &quot;value&quot; product helps keep the cost of the high end stuff down a bit as well as there is less waste. Now, some motherboards are more finiky than others and these manufacturers will qualify certain RAM for use on their boards. Making sure the RAM you choose has been tested and qualified by the MB manufacturer should improve your chances of putting together a stable system.
