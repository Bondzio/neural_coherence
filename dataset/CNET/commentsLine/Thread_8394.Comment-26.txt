man i'm talking about normally mounted fan.
not any additional installed fan.
my point is that he shouldn't change it's position.
the side upward or downward depends on the design of the motherboard.
he will damage the processor or whole cpu if he tries to change his fan's position when his motherboard design doesn't allow it.
