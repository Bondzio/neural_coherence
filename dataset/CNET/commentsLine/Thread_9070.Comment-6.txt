of course yes its connected to the sata port my pc is ready made from the store theres nothing with the test but i've runned some other benchmarks.
i can see how slow it is without it (ex.
: flashget mallocing disk space for 150meg for about 2mins) i've also downloaded seagate diagnostic program - seatools which says there is something wrong but it doesnt what it is... im wondering about: if some settings are wrong if the harddrive is wrong (i have a warranty) if the motherboard chipset driver isnt installed correctly (i've tried download some new driver from intel but its the same) if something in the bios incorrect if the operating system sucks
