What would be the point of upgrading to an AGP 4x or 8x or a 16x PCIe card? I am wondering if my network card would even support the bandwidth that these cards supply. During FTP I can get up to 3.5 megs a sec but if what I am reading is correct my PCI video card will deliver up to 120 something megs a sec. So what is the point of getting a more powerful card that will deliver 2 to 4 gigs a sec if my network doesnt (?) support that rate of transfer? I am currently on a cable modem not a T1 line but am confused at this point as to what is the point of the higher end AGP and PCI cards. Mainly I am curious about multi player games and the I know that I am missing some basic facts but cant seem to find a relevant source online that points me in the right direction. Any help would be appreciated. z

But in short, the faster the tranfer rate, then the less time lost for the CPU to not have access to RAM or I/O. Even a few millisecond wait by the CPU is some million cycles lost. Bob
