so, are netbooks and their cheapness and tiny size stealing the potential tablet audience?
i have a netbook but the keyboard is so small that i keep making typing mistakes all the time.
i love the fact that you can get apps for tablets and their large screen which is also a keyboard.
~sigh~ i guess in a years time, if there's no competition, i'll break down and buy an ipad.
