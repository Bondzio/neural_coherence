<s> I have a Goodway BU2240 / 4 port Card Bus card which fits into one of my PCMCIA slots which doesn't work anymore. </s>
<s> It was working fine. </s>
<s> Then I took it out, after I had shut down, to take my PC with me. </s>
<s> When I returned I put it back in and booted up. </s>
<s> It was dead. </s>
<s> I put my 3Com card in the slot to make sure it wasn't the slot at fault. </s>
<s> I also removed the software and drivers of the card. </s>
<s> Put the card in and the system recognized it so I went through the install again. </s>
<s> But upon reboot the laptop froze and the card didn't work. </s>
<s> Would appreciate any help anyone can offer to help me getting it working again. </s>
<s> Goodway hasn't been any help. </s>
<s> I have an IBM 390x laptop, running Win98SE. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the help. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> That would be the easy and expensive way $$$ My PC recognizes the card and tries to install it. </s>
<s> It works in the lower PCMCIA slot. </s>
<s> and my 3 Comm card works in the upper slot where I need to have the Card Bus because of the plug in's. </s>
<s> So why if both items are working, why are they not working where they once were. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> How about checking for a BIOS update on your computer. </s>
