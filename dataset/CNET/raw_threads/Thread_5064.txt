I can get in when I go directly, but when I try to go through the router connected to the main computer with a cable, I can not get in. I get an error message (Failed to load Tap). I have ZoneAlarm, but have disabled it. I do not understand how to proceed. Any ideas would be welcome. Thanks in advance.

Zonealarm can't be disabled. &quot; Zone Labs, maker of the popular ZoneAlarm firewall. The company says its own products are locked down in such a way that third-party applications can't disable firewall protection without uninstalling the software. &quot; - http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,117380,00.asp This issue has been a nagging issue for years. &quot;Tech&quot; has uninstalled hundreds of Zone Alarm installs to get networking up and running when Zone Alarm still works after we flip the disable setting. At least they are noting the issue now. 2. You may need to update the firmware and drivers for such products. I often find that they don't work out of the box. Bob
