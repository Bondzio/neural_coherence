Ok guys, help me out here.
I always thought that the reason for having a switch is for when you have exhausted the ports on your router.
Now you are recommending the opposite...use the ports on a switch first then only use the router ports if needed.
I am just switching over to a DIR-655 and if this scenario is truely recommended I may as well go ahead and add a switch from now.
Could you explain the rationale for me?
Thanks.
