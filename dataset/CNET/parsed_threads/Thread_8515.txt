<s> I have a card bus controller so I assume I have a cardbus slot which I guess is or could be the same as pcmcia slot. </s>
<s> I purchased a ExpressCard sound card and inserted it into the slot but it does not reach far enough in to make the connection. </s>
<s> My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 8600. </s>
<s> I take the same card to a co-workers laptop which is a Dell Inspiron 9400 and it connects no problem. </s>
<s> So I obviously have the wrong slot. </s>
<s> Is there any inexpensive adapters I might be able to find that will make the expresscard funtion in my laptop??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> express card and pc card (aka cardbus) are different beasts and the express card interface is much faster. </s>
<s> http://www.pcmcia.org/faq.htm#expresscard the dueladapter will do what you ask: http://www.duel-systemsadapters.com/?productid=DP-0002 but realize that you could be crippling the express card's performance. </s>
<s> I found this for $13.99 shipping included. </s>
<s> I am guessing this will do the job. </s>
<s> Just needed an audio input and hardware that can create decent MP3's and maybe improve the listening quality and enjoyment as well. </s>
<s> I am sure I am loosing a little going from expresscard to USB but hopefully it will do the trick. </s>
<s> Now I just need Creative Wave Studio for XP which I like better then using the free audacity software. </s>
