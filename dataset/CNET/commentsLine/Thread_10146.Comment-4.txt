that the productivity software is ms office.
available as office 2004 for mac, student & teacher edition ($125) has everything except ms access.
check out the on line software catalog, they sell mac stuff!
also note that their &quot;recommended&quot; computer purchase is a windows box.
the fact that the engineering department runs unix machines does not mean that require students to have a computer that will run unix.
i am not aware of a unix/windows dual boot machine, bob will comment if there is, but you have an advantage as your mac has a form of unix already, if you actually need a unix machine.
your lovely new 2ghz macbook will do admirably and, with boot camp, will even run windows.
good luck p
