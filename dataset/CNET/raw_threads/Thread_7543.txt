Meaning, all devices shouldn't all be connected as well, it just helps to reduce the strain. Not knowing how your AC current behaves in your area should make you get a &quot;surge protector&quot; as to help protect that circuit as a minimum. Getting a UPS will be helpful at a later time when you can. tada -----Willy

If so that might not be a good thing to do......corrupted files and such. Best to allow the OS to go through a normal shutdown......puts things away in an orderly fashion. Then you can drop power.
