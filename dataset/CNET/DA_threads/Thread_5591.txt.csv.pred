1.1.1	I thought Dual Core meant that two processors .	St
1.1.2	But as I see in this motherboard and chip theres only space for one .	St
1.1.3	Its a Dual Core 4200* 2.20GHz processor .	St
1.1.4	Unless theres two processor in one chip .	St
1.1.5	Which one is true guys ?	Ques
1.1.6	http : //www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=1539409 & Sku=MBM-A8NSLI-4400	Ques
1.2.1	Unless you go with multiple CPU board for Opteron or Xeon .	St
1.2.2	Read , much more expensive .	St
1.2.3	chuck	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	As this prevouis posts just proved a Dual Core Processor is different than two entire CPU chips .	St
1.4.2	I am assuming the latter would be faster ?	Ques
1.4.3	My dad 's server has two Xenon chips , not dual core .	St
1.4.4	Is that still single-threaded ?	Ques
1.4.5	Does it have more physcially because more server stuff is multi-threaded ?	Ques
1.4.6	~Ibrahim~	St
1.5.1	I think tomshardware.com did a test of 2 single core vs a dual core opeterons ( AMDs server chips ) .	St
1.5.2	They found that the dual core is a bit faster because inter-cpu communication is inside the chip rather than going across the bus .	St
1.5.3	( Dual core intels still have to communicate across the bus and are therefore not as efficient . )	St
1.5.4	Consider this analogy .	St
1.5.5	Assume you want to collaborate with your neighbor on some project .	St
1.5.6	If you 're in a house , you have to go in and out of your front door to share things with your neighbor .	St
1.5.7	That same front door is used for your deliveries and your other comings and goings .	St
1.5.8	You might be bumping into the mailman or walking over your kids while they unload groceries from the van .	St
1.5.9	You 'll be doing the same trying to get to your neighbor 's front door .	St
1.5.10	But if you 're in a duplex , you can put a door in your common wall and share things more easily and quickly .	St
1.5.11	And , your 're not adding more traffic to your or your neighbor 's front door and walkway .	St
