<s> I recently bought a seagate FreeAgent Go 500 GB external hard-drive. </s>
<s> I want to be able to use this on my mac and windows 7 computers. </s>
<s> So I want to be able to switch between the two easily (I used to have a WD that was capable of doing this). </s>
<s> I read that it needs re-formatting to work on a mac, is this true? </s>
<s> What simmilar external hard drive could I buy that would allow me to easily switch between the two OSs? </s>
<s> Today the new version supports NTFS so it works fine (here.) </s>
<s> Older versions only supported FAT32 and why you read about re-formatting. </s>
<s> That advice can be outdated. </s>
<s> In closing be sure this is not the only copy of your work. </s>
<s> This forum is testament to this. </s>
