i went in again and dug around... im not atall sure what im lookng for when looking at where the screen meets the deck... and then looking at the wireless slot theres a cord that runs from the back (where the antennas would be) to the front.... but are cover up by some black plastic 2&quot;x2&quot; piece of tape/sticky stuff... so i started tearing it... but the cord just runs past... im assuming its from the sound card and speakers to the headfone jack and mic jack.
im screwed... but i was gonna buy the parts and take it to a serivice place here.
