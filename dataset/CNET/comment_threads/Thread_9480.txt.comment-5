better ram = lower cas latency.
your original post mentioned kingston value ram, cl 5. i suggest you go with cl 4 ram instead... ddr2-800 cl4 can be picked up for $40USD/gb so there's no reason to use cl5 unless $5-$10 will break your budget.
for desktop boards, you don't need error correcting memory.
asus, msi, gigabyte, and abit are the 'name' brands for mobo using intel chipset.
asus is very popular (largest oem mfg, much like hertz vs. avis and budget) and thus they can charge a bit more, however any of these brands will get you a top-notch mobo.
