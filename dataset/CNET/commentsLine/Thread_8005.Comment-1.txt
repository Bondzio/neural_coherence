the new article with a sneek peak of windows longhorn has made me much less stressed out (  ).
someone said you would need like 4gb of ram to run it well and you would also have to have a 64 bit processor.
well not only does the article mention it will need &quot;at least 512mb of ram&quot; but it also says it comes in a 64 bit and 32 bit versions.
i think that because longhorn will also have 32 bit version, 64 bit will become the standard at a much later time then most people were expecting.
i'm just very thankful that m$ didnt just go all out and make a os that needs a $2,000+ computer to run.
