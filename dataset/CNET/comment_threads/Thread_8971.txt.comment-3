I forgot this portion....
I'm running an HP a730n, with 512 Mb DRAM, XP.
Could you recommend a video card with dual outputs?
Would the original monitor output run independently from the video card outputs, so if/when using the KVM, the monitor signal from the computer would be visible on the LCD t.v.?
