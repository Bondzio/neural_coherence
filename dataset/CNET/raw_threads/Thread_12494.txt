All connections are made with the Ethernet cable. Unless you're talking about connecting one PC to the modem and another PC to the main PC. That can be a royal pain and requires two NICs and that the main PC be turned on for the other PC to access the net.

My desktop is connected to the internet via wireless (base provided access points outside the building) its the only internet we got. what i wanted to know is if i could plug in a ethernet cable to my NIC on my desktop and then plug the other end to the NIC on my laptop and have them share the internet and access files between the two. If this is not possible just say so and ill stop posting. i dont want to get hubs or switches or routers because i lack the necessary funds to do so.

The answer I read above and what I provided would enable connections from what parts I see in your collection. Good luck with all this since it could be you did have it configured proper but had a firewall or account issue or the wrong ethernet cable. Bob

Both are set on factory settings. All i have done so far is run the windows home network setup. Since my desktop has the wireless internet on it i set that to access internet directly and ran the same home network setup on my laptop and set that to access through another computer since it will be accessing it through my desktop. when im done it asked me to restart so i did. and nothing happened. it still says a network cable is unplugged. from what i heard ive done everything right. i dont know why it wont work. right now the tcp/ip settings are all set on obtain automatically. do you even have to mess with those settings at all to get the network to work?

Sorry to see you struggle here. The notes above do have the info but no step by step and the article I added has to be rethought to be used but it does contain some needed tips to make it all work the way I'd like to use it. --&gt; Big idea. Why do you need a network? Why not shuttle files over with CDRW or USB memory key? Bob

Not that it matters but if this was already covered maybe you need to be more specific about why you can't use it. Bob
