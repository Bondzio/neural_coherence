hello, i have no idea if this is in the right forum or not, so please don't complain about it.
anyway, when ever i put in a black dvd-r+ into my dvd drive/burner, it switches to a cd drive.
i have tried enabling recording and switching the registry drive numbers from 1 to 2 as said on ms's website.
i also tried uninstalling it and restarting letting windows configure it itself.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
i am running windows xp media 2005, latest updates from windows update service.
