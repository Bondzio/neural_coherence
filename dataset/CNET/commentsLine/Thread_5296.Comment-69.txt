if it is a high-end mobo; even sli integrated graphics are possibly built in.
just a quick look over at the online stores will confirm my claim.
the beauty of doing that is many of them are sli bridge capable also!
so you can put another compatible sli card in an available express slot and whalla!
you got dual card capability, with one of them already built in!
i would only do this on a 64bit system so the bus would be properly used to stream the data in an efficient way.
but then, i'm not a gamer (yet), so i would only use 64bit games anyway, (so far).
