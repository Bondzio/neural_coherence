i have a 500 gb hitachi in front of me that died a few months after the warranty ran out.
the motor in it simply gave up.
it reminded me of the fact that hard drive motors are not designed to run forever.
and some have a very short life.
any device such as a disk, cd, or similar device will have a longer life since they don't rely on internal motors.
but because of our rapid change in storage technology, there is nothing that will have as long a life, and still be readable, for you information as plan old paper which is stored under proper conditions.
