Thank you, Which machine will I need to put the subnet 255.255.0.0 into, would I just put it on all 3?
What should I have the default gateway set to?
I have no router just a hub that all 3 machines plug into!
Isn't 255.255.0.0 a class B mask which would mean that the IP address starts with something different to 192?
Thanks again,
