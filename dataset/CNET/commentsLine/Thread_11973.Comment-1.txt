first, my system specs: 3 ghz pentium 4 w/ht, 2 gigs ram, 160 gig hard drive, 256 meg nvidia geforce 6600 video card.
now, what happens in these 2 games, half-life 2 and battlefield 2, regardless of video settings in the game, there are textures that are either missing, black, or flickering.
lets say there is a couch.
a cushion on the couch will be missing, or black or flickering, but, this only happens after the server changes maps, or if i cnrtl+alt+delete.
this happens also in the same fashion with battlefield 2, regardless of in-game video settings.
i tried both video games' support sections, and all they give me is generalized, automated solutions (run virus scan, defrag hard rive blahblahblah all useless and didnt help), so i figure i would come here for help.
oh, and when i look at the setting through the desktop (right click, properties, video card tab), i look at the monitor settings, and the video card has detected my lcd monitor as a crt monitor.
wtf is that all about??
anyway, any help would be great.
