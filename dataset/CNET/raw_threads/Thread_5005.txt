My laptop I had ordered had an 9800 gs which some have told me isnt the best. I have watched some youtube videos of people playing crysis with my same computer but they had an 9700 gt(not a 9800 gs) in it. Is the 9800 gs better than the 9700 gt and will I be able to play high quality games like crysis?
