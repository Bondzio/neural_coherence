<s> Given all the hoopla about WIFI problems and GPS problems and availability problems and the fact that I am not a gamer nor will I watch movies on it would I be happy with the old Transformer vs the Prime? </s>
<s> I am one that likes the latest tech but not a show stopper. </s>
<s> Is the above listed issues really a big deal or are they being blown out of proportion? </s>
<s> THANKS! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Here's the GPS &quot;problems&quot; I've read. </s>
<s> Both are limitations of GPS technology but new to GPS users may not know about the limitation and write these are glaring defects. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> On power up, can take many minutes to lock onto satellites. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Doesn't work indoors or in parking garages. </s>
<s> Is that the problems? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't know what the GPS problems are I don't have one. </s>
<s> I read the metal case is limiting the range of both the GPS and WIFI. </s>
<s> My question is , is this a real concern that makes this tablet less desirable than others. </s>
<s> Because I know the GPS issues. </s>
<s> Something about working with GPS tracking helps me here but as to the WIFi that's odd too. </s>
<s> I found no two devices to give the same range. </s>
<s> Some would call that a defect. </s>
<s> Again, I'm back to writing about limitation or differences. </s>
<s> The biggest problem I see folk encounter is when they try to replace their laptop with an Android or other pad. </s>
<s> They learn first hand what's up. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Not trying to replace a laptop. </s>
<s> Just trying to buy a really good tablet. </s>
<s> I think I hear you saying the Prime is the way to go..? </s>
<s> ?.. </s>
<s> Just like a PC as we increase the CPU and more, what more does Angry Birds need to run? </s>
<s> What apps did you run before that you need more oomph? </s>
<s> And right around the corner is Windows 8 and Bluestacks. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your help!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> As we passed some GHz and cores, you have to ask what apps are in need of that quad core tablet. </s>
<s> It is very nice but my advice is to wait till the dust settles from CES. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> As we look six months to a year into the future don't you think the quad core will trigger some pretty cool stuff? </s>
<s> Why overpay for this today? </s>
<s> So , at the same price as an Ipad2 you feel it is too high now? </s>
<s> You are right it will probably come down at least some. </s>
<s> You never revealed the use for this pad. </s>
<s> I'm watching folk rush in and learn the lessons the hard way about apps and more. </s>
<s> If you are jazzed about all this, don't buy until you can get past the jazz. </s>
<s> As to your comment about if this will bring out this or that, let me comment about Ice Cream. </s>
<s> Some folk are waiting for that but developers I know won't use its new features because most folk are not that yet. </s>
<s> They seem to be in agreement that in 6 months or a year they might have an Ice Cream feature app. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I will use it to compose docs,spreadsheets etc for work, check email, share pictures, surf web and use some basic apps at first. </s>
<s> It will be my first tablet but I also want it to be worthy of time from a techno point of view. </s>
<s> Don't want to be buying or wanting to buy another one in -6- months. </s>
<s> Prime is priced the same as the IPAD2. </s>
<s> I did not mention the Ipad. </s>
<s> PLEASE do yourself a favor and try to do what you wrote on any Android tablet today. </s>
<s> That use is exactly what I'm finding folk upset about. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> A couple reasons I and looking strong at Asus Transformers(both old and Prime) is the dock and Polaris software. </s>
<s> When they think they are going to produce Word and such documents this is where folk are getting upset. </s>
<s> My advice is to not buy this system for that use today. </s>
<s> Or if you do, don't spend so much you don't have the bucks for a laptop. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have a laptop and Polaris is compatible with Microsoft Office..The tablet will not be used as my only Office tool. </s>
<s> Will use it that way mainly when I'm away from home/office. </s>
<s> Be sure you can get your money back. </s>
<s> At nearly 500 bucks (over?) </s>
<s> you are inching towards Ultrabook prices. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your advice..... </s>
