1.1.1	wher can i build my own costume gaming pc for low prices	St
1.2.1	What is a low price to you for a gaming system ?	Ques
1.3.1	less than $ 1000	St
1.4.1	cyberpowersystems.com and ibuypower.com	St
1.5.1	Well , you can custom build with just about any of the computer companies like Dell , Gateway , HP/Compaq , Velocity Micro , I Buy Power , ABS Computer Tech , Monarch Computers , American Computeh , cyber-Power , etc ...	St
1.5.2	I did n't list the major high end gaming custom computer companies .	St
1.5.3	But , with $ 1000 ( not including a monitor or printer ) you will not be traveling with the high end gamers .	St
1.5.4	However , you will be able to play the latest/greatest games without problems .	St
1.5.5	( Just a high end Video Card will eat up $ 500+ , and heavens to betsy if you go with a 10,000 RPM Hard Drive , high end CPU/Mobo , & RAM . )	St
1.5.6	The main guts for a gaming PC is the Video Card , RAM , and CPU .	St
1.5.7	It is a matter of going thru with each company trying to get the best CPU/Motherboard , then Video Card , and RAM .	St
1.5.8	Sometimes you can skimp on the video card and RAM getting a less powerful one when configuring with a company , keeping in mind that you can beat their prices by buying separately elsewhere , removing the lesser ones , and installing a more powerfully one yourself , and still stay within the $ 1000 limit ( without monitor/printer ) .	St
1.5.9	I 'm off to Church right now , then to watch NASCAR on TV , but when I get some time in a day or so , I 'll see what I can scratch up for you , but suggest you take pen in hand , and with fingers roaming over your keyboard try to do it yourself .	St
