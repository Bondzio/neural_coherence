The wired speed is on a SWITCHED 100 MEGABIT HUB.
The keyword is &quot;switched&quot;.
You can research that it means that one computer can transfer to another witout interfering with other computers.
The Wifi-G air is shared so you get 54 megabit shared and rarely do I see the 108 megabit work out except at close range.
