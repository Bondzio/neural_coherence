i first fell in love with computers in 1983 when the first clones of apple ii-style keyboard and cpu units were available in the philippines.
as a college student living in a 3rd world country, we were not given an affordable choice with regards to computers back then.
as far as i can remember, the system was ms-dos and i have to put in a special card (i forgot the name of this card, can anyone help me remember it?)
in order for the monitor to display small characters.
it didn't have a hard drive and uses 5.25 in.
floppy disk.
when i made a trip to taiwan in 1984 i bought my first pc there and had to carry it all the way back to cebu, philippines.
it was such a wonderful memory.
thanks for helping me remiscise it.
now, i'm using an hp pavillion laptop with pentium iv 2.0 ghz and 1 gb ram, windows xp and i still love my pc.
regards, edwin
