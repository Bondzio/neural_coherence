<s> I have a dualview setup working off of a PNY FX5200 Nvidia card with a ViewSonic A90f+ as my secondary monitor and a VS 900 LCD as my primary. </s>
<s> My question is whether the factory drivers are really necessary or will the drivers within Windows XP Pro suffice. </s>
<s> Am I giving up any quality doing without or should I update. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help in advance </s>
<s> You'll scream. </s>
<s> The answer is &quot;sometimes.&quot; </s>
<s> thanks </s>
