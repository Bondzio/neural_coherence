Hello people, how are you?
I have ADSL broadband connection on my company.
I would like to have access to this ADSL connection from a nearby ranch, and if possible to its telephony line, since I dont have phone access on this ranch.
The company is 15 meters (50 foot) lower (altitude) than the ranch, and the distance between the company and the ranch are 550 meters (0,342 miles or 1.804,462 foot) forthright (see satellite image below).
We could consider 600 meters (0,373miles or 1.968,504 foot) to have no problems in range.
What can I do to solve the problem?
