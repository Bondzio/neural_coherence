<s> Hi, I am looking to get a graphics card so I can have dual monitors, I know I need to get a small graphics card physically to fit my tower (slimline), but I have also noticed that the lowest required Wattage was like 300, I read somewhere that the GeForce 8500 GT and the GeForce 8600 GT will work on such a small PSU, but I don't want to risk blowing anything up... </s>
<s> So does anyone know one that will work or one that just doesn't require so much juice? </s>
<s> I have the HP s5120f... </s>
<s> each model number. </s>
<s> Generally speaking the cheaper the GPU, the lower the performance and the lower the power requirement. </s>
<s> Newegg.com is usually a good place to shop as they generally offer good products and good product detail. </s>

<s> I used a P3 Watt Meter and that card is far too heavy. </s>
<s> For those small power supplies you need to stick to the Nvidia 6200 based cards. </s>

<s> So would this be too much for the PSU? </s>

<s> specific BFG video card, is available to you at the manufacturer's website. </s>
<s> All you need do is go there and find it. </s>

<s> Your class power supply requires a low power card like the ones with the Nvidia 6200. </s>
<s> I only have 1 open PCI-e slot, and I've only seen the GeForce in AGP, so are there any cards that I could use that's PCI-e? </s>
<s> And I was actually thinking just getting a whole new PSU wouldn't be completely out of the idea, so are there any PSU's that could fit? </s>
<s> I have searched around on the net and really didn't get any answers... </s>

<s> You research that! </s>
<s> -&gt; How about an open PCI slot. </s>
<s> There are Nvidia 6200s for that. </s>
