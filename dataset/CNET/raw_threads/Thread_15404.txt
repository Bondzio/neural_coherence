I decided to upgrade from the painful Windows 98 to XP, but now I can't install internet security or any sizable program. I want to add memory but I am technically challanged. Dad took it into Staples for me today but they didn't have anything for a computer that old & they didn't tell him what I would need. I could look for something on ebay if I know what to look for. I found the info that came with it: - Intel FC-PGA Plll 600 MHz Processor - 256K Cache - 64 Megabyte SDRAM (PC 100)! - Western Digital 10 Gigabyte Hard Drive The motherboard was replaced several years ago. I still have the box, it is Micro ATX. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Lisa

You do need to know exactly by your mtrbd. model specs just how much is ram is supported per ram slot and total amount. Offhand, I suspect yours is 256mb per slot but again you need to verify that. Check with the Intel support website for those details. You can still find such ram but it maybe expensive as it NOT made anymore. Though you should check: http://www.crucial.com for possible source and what you system is allowed. For a win98 system, it would be best with 512mb(if applicable) but anything above 64mb is going to help. To get XP installed on such a system with 64mb is a plus for you, but the real addition of more ram has to be done for XP. I would shoot for 512mb but if possible 1gb, again provided it is supported. tada -----Willy
