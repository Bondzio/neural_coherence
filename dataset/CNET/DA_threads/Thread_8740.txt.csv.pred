1.1.1	I have a Sony computer with a Windows XP operating system .	St
1.1.2	I have a Lexmark Z52 printer which is giving me problems .	St
1.1.3	Lexmark has been very good and patiently walked me through everything in the book to get it working properly again including sending me a new cartridge , but without any success .	St
1.1.4	The print-out is very poor quality , blurred in certain parts with certain letters distorted ONLY when printing from the word processor .	St
1.1.5	If I print from the Internet ( for instance if I printed out this page ) the printer works fine .	St
1.1.6	This makes me think that it is a Microsoft Word problem , could this be the cause and if so how do I fix it please ?	Ques
1.2.1	If you have the CD for MS Office , you could try an un-install and re-install of Office but that sound a bit drastic so ... a few checks ... 1 ) Go to http : //www.trendmicro.com ( the PC-cillin people- so it 's a trusted site ) and run their Free Virus Scan ( Housecall ) - it checks for EVERYTHING , not just viruses - it will even tell you if there is a Windows update you have n't done .	St
1.2.2	This will also check for Spyware , Greyware , Malware etc .	St
1.2.3	etc .	St
1.2.4	This is always first port of call for unusual problems - bugs can cause all sorts of strange things .	St
1.2.5	2 ) Do a Scandisk ( chkdsk ) or whatever XP uses for it 's re-boot disk check .	St
1.2.6	3 ) Are you fully up-to-date with Windows Update AND ... . Office Update ... ?	Ques
1.2.7	If not , run both ... there may be a glitch that they now have a patch for .	St
1.2.8	4 ) Try using a different Font ... instead of Times New Roman which is usually the MS-Word default font .	St
1.2.9	If this prints OK , you may have a bad Times New Roman font so remove it and re-install it with a good copy ( ask a friend for a copy if you ca n't get at one on a CD ) .	St
1.2.10	Or does XP have a font repair program , I ca n't remember .	St
1.2.11	5 ) I 'm guessing that Lexmark have already told you to download their new Z52 drivers for XP ... ?	Ques
1.2.12	http : //downloads.lexmark.com/cgi-perl/downloads.cgi ? ccs=227:5:0:292:0:0 & searchLang=en & os_group=WinXP & target= There are 2 driver here and you will probably need both .	St
1.2.13	... Hope this helps or at least eliminates a few lines of enquiry .	St
1.2.14	Please let us all know how you get on .	St

St
1.4.4	Thank you so much for your help , ( its also worked wonders for my stomach which clenched in a tight knot every time I attempted to print something out ) GOOD WORK .	St
1.5.1	Sorry , I got your name wrong in my last post I tried to get it back to change it but too late ...	St
