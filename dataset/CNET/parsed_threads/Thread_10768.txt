<s> I am new to computers so I need some help. </s>
<s> Does anyone know when I do a powerpoint presentation of only 4 slides do I copy it to cd or dvd. </s>
<s> I have never used these two functions. </s>
<s> So if someone can explian what I use these things for it would be appreciated. </s>
<s> With just 4 slides you should fit it on there easy. </s>
<s> Otherwise use a CDROM and just cut and paste. </s>
<s> But you have to close it out or burn it (rendering the CD unusable for any other writing). </s>
<s> Then when you do your presentation, just double click on the cd (assuming powerpoint is loading on that computer). </s>
<s> So that whatever you do can be removed later and you can reuse your CD for other purpose, later.. </s>
<s> I don't know what a memory stick is but I managed to burn it on CD thanks for your help </s>
<s> Two links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive http://castle.pricewatch.com/s/search.asp?s=usb+flash+drive Kees </s>
<s> Also, I don't know about the new office, but with the old one Office 97 they had a program where you could just play the slideshow on a computer that didn't have it loaded on it. </s>
<s> A pretty small program too. </s>
