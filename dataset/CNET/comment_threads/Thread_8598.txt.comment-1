I would like to set up my system so that my friends and family can access a folder on my system through the internet to download pictures and such.
I have a home network set up with a cable modem and router.
Can I set up something that is password protected so I am not exposing my system to every hacker in the universe?
My Linksys router has the capability to set up a DMZ outside the firewall, but that seems risky to me.
It seems as though there must be a simple way to accomplish all this, but I haven't found it yet!
