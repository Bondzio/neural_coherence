<s> Alright this is my situation. </s>
<s> I had a Win XP Compaq laptop but it's screen broke and it was old anyways so i bought a new HP Pavilion dv2000. </s>
<s> This one has vista installed. </s>
<s> Next i thought I'd get my old data on the new laptop and then keep my old Seagate 2.5' 120GB hard drive as an external one. </s>
<s> It seemed simple but it's been driving me crazy for 3 days. </s>
<s> I searched many topics but nobody has this problem. </s>
<s> Anyways, i bought a Coolpodz IDE enclosure and hooked it up and everything. </s>
<s> The laptop recognizes that a disk drive has been plugged http://img215.imageshack.us/my.php?image=safeix5.jpg but i can't see it on My Computer. </s>
<s> Disk management says this: http://img184.imageshack.us/img184/355/unreadak1.jpg I am starting to get really pissed off with this thing, although i am pretty sure it's something simple (maybe a faulty enclosure). </s>
<s> By the way i have tried setting it as master, as slave and even tried a brand new Western Digital 120Gb hdd but still same results . </s>
<s> Same thing on my desktop which runs WinXp , so i'm guessing it's not vista's fault. </s>
<s> Any help appreciated. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> No, you're the first to have this issue here. </s>
<s> No you're not. </s>
<s> Try the usuals. </s>
<s> a) GETDATABACK b) ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY 3. </s>
<s> Use the USB cable that came with the case. </s>
<s> i have already tried all of those. </s>
<s> and btw data recovery software don't work because i don'thave a drive letter for it. </s>
<s> As such you make me cast doubt you have tried them. </s>
<s> well i haven't tried those exact programs but it's the same thing with all of them. </s>
<s> this is what ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY gives http://img230.imageshack.us/my.php?image=zarxv2.jpg </s>
<s> GETDATABACK doesn't even list my drive. </s>
<s> And please don't hold back such great clues. </s>
<s> There is another method where we use a DESKTOP and a laptop drive adapter along with these titles. </s>
<s> If those fail in the desktop the next stop is to ask http://www.drivesavers.com Bob </s>
<s> This means we have to move to the desktop attempts and if that fails we are hitting the end of DIY repairs. </s>
<s> I'm starting to think it's the enclosure's fault. </s>
<s> what do u think? </s>
<s> We get off USB since it limits what can be done. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i have no idea what that is </s>
<s> Link -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=HD-108&cat=HDD Then I can use these tools on a desktop to get back drives that we can't in the USB enclosures. </s>
<s> Some consumers won't be able to do this so they'll have to deal with http://www.drivesavers.com or similar. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Don't fret it if we are hitting the limits of home data recovery. </s>
<s> It happens and is how most learn that they need to address their backup plans. </s>
<s> i don't wanna go through anymore trouble. </s>
<s> thank you so much for your efforts though. </s>
