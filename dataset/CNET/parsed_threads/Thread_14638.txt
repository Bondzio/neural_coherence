<s> I have a Dell Dimension 8200 and am looking into the best way to back up my system. </s>
<s> Since my memory is not the best, I would like to be able to set this up with the minimal effort. </s>
<s> I need this to mainly back up business data, but the holiday snaps might be a good idea too. </s>
<s> I've been looking into a number of things, thinking that a RAID 1 Solution would be the best, mirroring all the data I have. </s>
<s> I'd looked at the Western Digital Pro/Premium II, NAS devices, external SATA drives , people at work mention that all I would need to do would be to add a Hard Drive to my machine and do either Software Raid or if the machine supports it Hardware Raid. </s>
<s> I'm just wondering what the best solution would be, if there is any special software that I should be using. </s>
<s> Willing to spend up to $600 to get this in place and would like the solution to not effect the performance of it too much. </s>
<s> Any help would be gratefully received. </s>
<s> Cheers, Stuart </s>
<s> If you restart your computer everytime you use it, you can write a 'batch file' that is placed in your startup folder that can copy data from one drive to another. </s>
<s> That other folder could be another computer accessed through a network. </s>
<s> I don't have that great of memory, but I get by through using a dvd burner every month. </s>
<s> Thats all I need becuase my data doesnt change dramitically every few days. </s>
<s> A raid 1 will only help if your computer crashes becuase of bit rot, or a defective drive. </s>
<s> Usually data is lost becuase of user error, an incomplete backup before an OS reinstall. </s>
<s> You want a backup solution that is out of the case of your computer and most preferably off the same fuse (In case of electrical surge). </s>
<s> Good luck finding an easy way to backup data. </s>
<s> unless you're running xp pro, you won't have a software raid option. </s>
<s> software raid will affect performance but if you're main concern is 'backup' (rather than fault-tolerance) then raid is overkill. </s>
<s> a backup solution will protect your data AND allow you restore old items... </s>
<s> RAID will not help you if you delete something and find you need it a few days or few months later. </s>
<s> the maxtor one-touch and western digital mybook both come with automatic backup software for far less than $600. </s>
