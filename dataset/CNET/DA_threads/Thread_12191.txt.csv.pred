1.1.1	CPU- Intel i3-3245 Motherboard- ASUS P8Z77-V LK Socket LGA 1155 Z77 ATX Graphics Card: EVGA GeForce GTX650Ti Boost 2GB How would these parts work together?	St
1.1.2	Do you think this could run BF3 Mid settings around 40FPS?	St
1.2.1	How would these parts work together?	St
1.2.2	Quite well I would think.	St
1.2.3	Do you think this could run BF3 Mid settings around 40FPS?	St
1.2.4	No idea.	St
1.2.5	Only someone with those exact parts can answer that.	St
1.2.6	Based on sys reqs for bf3 and benchmarks for the parts you listed......you should be fine.	St
1.3.1	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-benchmark-gk106,3318-6.html Looking at the benchmark there we see 36.0 and 40.6 FPS in the first chart.	St
1.3.2	And looking at the rig they used at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-benchmark-gk106,3318-4.html we see that you are electing for something more than a few steps back.	St
1.3.3	My answer is no.	St
1.3.4	-&gt; When folk want a gaming machine on a budget I have 2 answers for that.	St
1.3.5	1.	St
1.3.6	This Haswell value build.	St
1.3.7	http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040319/build-the-ultimate-intel-haswell-pc-for-under-1000.html http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-7790-bonaire-performance,3462-8.html shows it trade places with the 650 so I'm calling them comparable.	St
1.3.8	2.	St
1.3.9	If budget is the issue I give the nod to the AMD A10 based machine with good ram.	St
1.3.10	It games without the wallet drain.	St
1.3.11	Bob	St
1.4.1	I'm building my first computer and those are the parts I thought could do the best for $600, but I wanted toaje sure they were captible.	St
1.5.1	http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-5-1-surround-External-Sound-Card/dp/B000N35A0Y highlights why we must match RAM with the A10.	St
1.5.2	Keep in mind this was done with the A10-5800K I'd look to the 6800K just because of the occasional FPS render time slowdown, http://semiaccurate.com/2013/06/04/amd-brings-richland-to-the-desktop-the-a10-6800k/ shows a good graph and the 6800K would be my choice along with a pair of high speed memory sticks IF I wanted to do this on a budget.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	The op is talking about the boost model.	St
1.6.2	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhQi3EhUZdc Granted I have no idea what rig the demo is feeding the cards with.	St
1.6.3	Seems like the boost model moves things along quite well.	St
1.7.1	Sorry I'll add the link about the RAM later today.	St
1.8.1	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/memory-bandwidth-scaling-trinity,3419.html	St
