<s> I have the Safecom SWBR-5400 found [URL=&quot; http://www.dealtime.co.uk/xPF-eBuyer-Ebuyer-54mbps-Wireless-Cable-DSL-WI-FI-Broadband-Router-4-port-802-11G&quot;]here [/URL] which works fine wired to my PC & Xbox 360. </s>
<s> But I'm getting a new laptop soon & I'm going to have a problem as the router never came with an antenna as I bought it off a mate. </s>
<s> The router's downstairs & my laptop will be upstairs & I've already tried my mates laptop & it obviously had weak signal without the antenna. </s>
<s> So I'm hoping to buy a new antenna for it but can't find a site anywhere that sells antennas specifically for this model. </s>

<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> If I can't find one that fits it, it'll mean I'll have to fork out another 30-40 on a new router when I know this one works fine bar the antenna problem. </s>
<s> Some radios burn out if the antenna is not attached. </s>
