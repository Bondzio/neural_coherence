Love it and works great. Now thinking of getting another for just 2 purposes. Checking emails and watching DVD's that I own and download(not HD)for use on plane trips and when traveling. Have been using my 4&quot; Dell laptop but it is heavy and battery life is not that good. My questions is can the above Eee or 1001P-PU17 handle the watching of these downloads with only 1GB memory or do I have to upgrade to 2GB? Will I see any difference in quality, etc.? Thanks for the help and suggestions. Would consider another in the same price range, such as Samsung N210 and/or N220. Or any others. Thoughts??

Thanks.

Now that you know the ION you can see what other machines have that. Just so you know, this is not a shopping service. Many think it is and are miffed when other members don't do the research. Bob
