1.1.1	Hi There can you help me I am trying to identify a motherboard which was apparently taken out of a working computer running a Intel Celeron Processor 3, I dont know what speed or if the Celeron Processor info is correct, on the Processor slot it says mPGA478B The CPU clock speed can be set to 100Mhz and 133Mhz.	St
1.1.2	Printed on the Board itself is QT-4SDM2+ on one of the PCI slots there is a barcode and printed on it is 4SDM2+ -021113000363 the Bios is Phoenix D686 073659761 Dated 1998 this information is from a sticker on the same PCI slot as the barcode.	St
1.1.3	There is also a smaller barcode stuck to the motherboard with a No.2B003700181.	St
1.1.4	On top of the LAN socket is another sticker P29-112-11A9 The Chips on the motherboard are SIS961, Winbond W83697HF, RTL8100B.	St
1.1.5	I have tried to search for QT-4SDM2+ on the internet which I assumed was the Motherboard model and I find nothing.	St
1.1.6	I then search for 4SDM2+ and it comes up with an Epox board.	St
1.1.7	EP-4SDM2+ I have downloaded the manual and the board looks like the one I have but it talks about Pentium 4 processors and I think that this board might be older than that.	St
1.1.8	All slots and connections seem identical to the EP-4SDM2+ even the connections coming out the back of the MB are the same and in the same order.	St
1.1.9	Can you tell me if I have the correct motherboard manual can my MB take a Pentium 4 processor or is there a motherboard that links to the QT that is printed on my MB.	St
1.1.10	Many Thanks for any help you can give me.	Ques
1.2.1	Well, I did a search on google and this is what I came up with: ls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&q=mpga478b+motherboard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&r ls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&q=mpga478b+motherboard It looks like a Socket 478.	St
1.2.2	It will handle a P4.	St
1.2.3	Also, it looks to be from a PC manufactured by Dell or some other PC maker.	St
1.2.4	Hope this helps.	St
