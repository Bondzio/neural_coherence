It's this simple... 1.
Find the make/model of your &quot;Gigabyte Athlon/Duron compatible motherboard&quot;, go to the web site and check out their manuals or web pages on that motherboard to see what CPU's will fit.
2.
256 is usually enough, but gamers will want the 512MB for 98.
Be aware that this will not increase the fixed space 64 thousand byte memory pools called RESOURCES.
The MEMORY ARTICLE at http://www.aumha.org/articles.htm will tell you about that.
