thank you, since beta testing vista and win 7, it was reported to ms. even after windows vista and 7 went into release to manufacturer, this problem still existed, believe me i tried it.
i don't think i was doing something wrong as moving it, was just as simple as the other folders.
but i did read an article a few years ago, that ms was working on making sure that the desktop folder should be allow to be move as well - as it was creating error messages in not finding it since then i never tried it - thank you very much for the update and letting me know that it works.
i for one, hardly use any of the shortcuts to programs or documents store on the desktop folder, so for me is not a problem restoring them.
i use a separate partition for all personal data, hence pointing to something that would create a shortcut on the desktop folder is not a problem.
but others may want to make sure that what they have on the desktop folder gets copy/moved easily right back which is ok too, and now with your confirmation, i myself will be re-directing the desktop folder as well.
cheers, geo again thank you.
