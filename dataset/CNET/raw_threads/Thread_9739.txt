I have used the 17 MB package and the 54 MB and get the same thing. I checked the programs that come with the Office programs and they all show that I have SP3 but the automatic update says I need to install it. Can anyone help me with this? Thanks in advance. louise876

You appear to have something else and didn't tell. -&gt; Try this. http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;290301 Also, be sure Windows 2000 is at it's SP4a (or latest). Bob

I just used the Windows Install clean up utility and reinstall Office XP, and everything went beautiful. It is refreshing to get information from someone who knows what they are doing. Many happy thanks and take care. louise876
