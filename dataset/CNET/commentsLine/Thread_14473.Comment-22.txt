several people around the net have reported success with installing leopard on many, many unsupported macs, meaning they have g4 (or g3) cpus clocking under the 867mhz mark.
some people have managed to install it on their powerbook g3s (pismos with g4 upgrades), which is pretty good for an eight/nine-year-old notebook.
i was just pointing out that if far older technology can run the same system as the air at a reasonable speed and usability, than the air should have no trouble whatsoever for basic tasks.
the air has a lot of potential.
in time, users looking for a ssd will be able to get it cheaper.
firewire might be added to its small array of ports.
apple did patent something like that for more ports awhile ago... the air is only on its first generation, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
just give it time.
the first ipods were mac-only and did not work very well as i recall.
the latest ipods support windows and run very smoothly.
just wait .
