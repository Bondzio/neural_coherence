1468	0	27550	310316	NR	PDNaylor	6/29/04 12:35 PM	1.0885125E12	I need help!	I have been working on a Dell Dimension 4400 Desktop Computer. However, I have run into a big problem. When it starts up, It gives you the menu for Safe Mode, Last Known Good Configuration, Boot Up Normally, etc. If you click on any of these options, you get a quick blue screen, and the computer reboots. It takes you back to that menu. Can anybody help me with this? I'd appreciate it!

Consider that I can only guess that you may be using Windows 2000, XP or 2003. Repairs may vary, BUT a little history could reveal what the issue is. For instance, another poster with the same plea revealed they changed the motherboard. The answer is clear on that one that they get to reinstall the OS since Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003 don't like such changes. Tell more and post a better titled post with more words and history in the OS Forum that matches. Bob
