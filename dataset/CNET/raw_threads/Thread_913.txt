I connected it correctly, and also attached all the necessary cables. However, the HDD won't show up in my BIOS. Here is my setup: AMD Phenom X4 9650 ASUS M4N72-E Corsair XMS2 4GB (4 x 1GB) Western Digital 300GB HDD SATA Nvidia XFX GeForce 9800 Why isn't it working? Can anyone help, please?

Some adapter can do that but don't know about this one. Harddrive are cheap..get another ide. Use the sata for data storage. Good luck.
