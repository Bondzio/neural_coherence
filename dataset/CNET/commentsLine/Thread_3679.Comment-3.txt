gothic 3 is a graphics challenge and is noted for sluggish performance with less than 1gb of ram.
here's a snippet from a review:  sadly a problem for many is the loadless loading areas, yes you did read that correctly.
there is no loading bar except when loading a save game of course; unfortunately because of the games engine design it seems to give poor ram a hard time.
walking or sprinting along areas of the game will be frequently met with temporary freezes as your computer frantically reads memory.
this is more common for anyone with less than 2 gb for ram; also memory leak problems hamper the process further.
if you still want to go for a full upgrade, you should rethink some choices to make a better gaming rig.
if you don't need the wi-fi capabilities, get a lesser model of the p5b and save $40-$50.
ocz gold gamer extreme (link below) is a good alternative to the corsair xms and will save you about $60 after rebate.
for gaming you won't notice much difference between an e6400 and an a e6600 so save yourself $90.
with your savings, upgrade the 7950gt to a evga geforce 8800gts (only $120 more).
you'll get a nice performance boost over the 7950gt and you'll have a direct x 10 card for future games.
you should still have enough money for a new wd caviar re 250gb ($85) drive that will perform better than the old maxtor.
