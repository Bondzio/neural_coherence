i did that and western digital did that the serial # do not match the specs on the hard drive that was sent to me.
the serial # matched on what i ordered not what was sent to me.
i got two different statement confumation emails.
before i opened up the hard drive plastic casing i called western digital because if it was not what i ordered i would have sent it back i do not care what is on the lable.
the software puriform speccy says something way diferent.
it is not oem i do not know what it is.the vender might have decieved me not the mfgs.
thank you wendell
