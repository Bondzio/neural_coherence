I want to record my favorite cable TV shows on my DELL Dimension V400 Desktop (400Mhz PII 392MB ram, 80 GB HD, Win2K).
Ive been searching online for TV tuner cards but as I keep searching I really dont know what to buy.
So I turn to you, hoping you can help me with these questions: - Can you recommend a good affordable TV tuner card for my desktop?
- What are the pros and cons of internal and external TV tuner cards?
- If I get a USB tuner card, will my system support it?
- I assume the cards come with their recording software, but is there any other software that you can recommend?
thanks
