<s> For some unknown reason, every once in a while, my computer will not boot up, it's a compaq Sa4000T with P4 560, 1GB Ram, and X300SE-Win XP SP2. </s>
<s> Upon pushing the powerbutton, there will be 4 short beeps and the fans will spin up, the optical drive lights will flash, so will hard drive light (almost like normal start-up), then lights go off and its just as the pc is on idle except the monitor isn't on. </s>
<s> TO fix the situation,i would have to force shutdown and yank out the power cord to the psu and push the power button, then reconnect and it works. </s>
<s> What is up with this? </s>
<s> IS this a motherboard problem? </s>
<s> Thnx for any replys. </s>

<s> Next time you get to the BIOS screen identify the BIOS manufacturer (AMI, Phoenix etc) you may have to press the delete key, or F1 to enter setup & identify the BIOS. </s>
<s> Then look here: http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/sys/beep/ to see if you can find the answer, or post the BIOS version here for help. </s>
<s> ...it sounds like a Power Supply problem. </s>
<s> Please post back with your BIOS manufacturer and revision. </s>
<s> The bios is made by american megatrends version 3.21 for the asustek piranha 915P motherboard which is strictly for oems. </s>
<s> I have the latest version. </s>
<s> I have a 400watt psu. </s>
<s> As for the beeps, i believe it is 4 beeps or 3 not so sure. </s>
<s> But its either ram or motherboard problem. </s>
<s> Believe it to be motherboard, due to the temporary solution being to yank out psu and push power button. </s>
<s> Thnx for the quick replies. </s>
