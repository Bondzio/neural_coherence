<s> I have not had very good experiences with our IT guy at work--he has some odd ideas like saying that Mozilla products are for &quot;home users&quot; only and insisting we can't use Firefox. </s>
<s> I went ahead and purchased a new Dell Studio desktop with Win 7 for my office (without his advice, which annoyed him) and he is now insisting that I can't run Win 7--that all computers on the network must be on the same operating system (most are using XP), and he claims all computers must have same software, and has moved people &quot;back&quot; to Excel 2004, etc, removing newer editions. </s>
<s> I can't find any evidence to support this. </s>
<s> He claims that the server won't run properly if we use different operating systems. </s>
<s> I think he is misguiding us. </s>
<s> Any input? </s>
<s> They have a hard enough time with just XP in the brew. </s>
<s> For years we had NT, 2000, then XP in the brew of clients. </s>
<s> We did however have to ditch DOS/98/ME systems due to too unstable and stealing IT staff time helping those that clung to the old systems. </s>
<s> Good riddance to that. </s>
<s> HOWEVER the IT staffer would be in their rights to demand 7 Pro since that's what's needed in an domain or active server setting. </s>
<s> Don't battle too hard with them. </s>
<s> I find they eventually explode or catch up. </s>
