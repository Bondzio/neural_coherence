1.1.1	Hi Folks , hope somebody here can point me in the right direction .	St
1.1.2	I uninstalled McAffee Security in preparation for a Zone Alarm download/install , and it seems that that caused my Network adapter to stop connecting to the internet .	St
1.1.3	I 'm running XP Home and its an Intel network card .	St
1.1.4	I 've tried deleting and reloading the card driver but it does n't seem to be able to accept automatically assigned IP or DNS adresses .	St
1.1.5	I 've lost count of the variations of IPCONFIG that I 've run .	St
1.1.6	I 'm thinking a remnant of McAffee might be causing it the fault but can anyone here think of a fix or something else that I have n't considered ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks Rich	St
1.2.1	I guess I 'd better add that neither the connection repair nor the adapter repair functions on XP were successful .	St
1.2.2	I was online with my ISP tech support for about 2 hours ( surprise , they were Canadian ) I keep getting an error message saying there 's limited or no access .	St
1.2.3	I guess I 'm looking for a fix on the automatically accept IP and DNS addresses problem .	St
1.2.4	Thanks again Rich	St

1.4.1	I 've downloaded Windowsxpfix , but I 'm extremely reluctant to start messing around with registry files with an unsupported utility , I do n't know enough about it , call it regeditophobia .	St
1.4.2	I especially do n't want to mess up a friend 's computer .	St
1.4.3	This whole problem started wiht the uninstall of McAfee so what I 'd like to try first is to remove any McAfee registry entries or other files that uninstall may have left hanging around .	St
1.4.4	I think it was the 2004 McAfee Antivirus .	St
1.4.5	Can anyone tell me what I need to look for ?	Ques
1.5.1	A call from the geeksquad type of services .	St
