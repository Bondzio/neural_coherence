<s> Currently i own an hp media center m7160n and want to know if it's safe to format the hard drive without losing the media center OS. </s>
<s> I have a maxtor 250 gig hard drive with a 8 gig recovery partition. </s>
<s> if i format will i lose the 8 gig recovery partition? </s>
<s> Is the MCE OS on the 8 gig partion? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Formatting removes the partition tables that allows access to the OS and data. </s>
<s> With special utilites, under correct conditions, training, the partition tables can be restored. </s>
<s> The information on the Recovery Partition contains the orginal install of the system, Operating System, drivers and applications. </s>
<s> Format the drive only if you have created or purchased the Recovery Disks. </s>
<s> Use HP's recovery method --&gt; On boot pressing ''F12 or F10'' (watch for prompt in upper right corner of splash screen) will take you to HPs Recovery Utility. </s>
<s> You will be prompted to perform a Windows Repair or by clicking Advanced a Destructive Restore. </s>

<s> No offense intended but we are not all car repair mechanics. </s>
<s> While most of us will replace a lamp or fuze what you are looking at is about the skill level of replacing the head gaskets. </s>
<s> I'd read the other responder's reply a few more times. </s>

<s> I Have already tryed the Hp recovery and thats why i want to formatt. </s>
<s> is because when i did system recovery it left all of my original programs but none of them work and it wont let me uninstall them. </s>
<s> When i right clicked on C: drive there is an option to format is it safe to do that? </s>
<s> No that will not work.... System Recovery ... from where? </s>
<s> In Windows as system restore? </s>
<s> This will only restore Windows kernal files. </s>
<s> HP Recovery .... Windows repiar is not the option you want and from your post it appears this is what you did. </s>
<s> Re-boot to the HP Recovery. </s>
<s> Click on the advanced button, Read All data will be lost and system returned to orginal factory settings (words to that effect). </s>
<s> Any other proceedure will render you system usless unless you have the recovery disks. </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> Thanks Bill i did just what you siad and it worked out. </s>
<s> but was surprised when i booted up that a blurry section on my monitor was gone. </s>
<s> I originally thought that this was an integrated graphics card problem and was planning to replace it with a PCI-E one. </s>
<s> Could anyone tell me how this happened? </s>
<s> and how to prevent it in the future? </s>
<s> Yes i did try to update the driver. </s>
<s> My monitor is a 19&quot; LG Flatron (L1917S). </s>
<s> and my graphics card is an intel integrated graphics accelerator. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> First happy to hear that you were able to successfuly reinstall. </s>
<s> Second, the blurry section on your monitor .... Possible that Video Drivers had become corrupted on the orginal install. </s>
<s> If it returns the monitor may be going bad. </s>
<s> Have yet to own or use the LCD monitors, so this is at best a WAG .... Luck Bill </s>
<s> Hello, I have an HP Media Center pc that I want to pass along to a friend. </s>
<s> Problem: I can't find the recovery disk! </s>
<s> Can I simply do a format operation and restore the windos default system/settings? </s>
<s> Or - should I take it into the shop to have them do this? </s>
<s> Maureen </s>
<s> They'll usually send you the CDs if you want them. </s>
<s> Then you don't have to worry about the other partition. </s>
<s> The CDs will install everything as if it were from the factory. </s>
<s> Theres about 8 CDs. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> hey, I just need some help with my PC. </s>
<s> I am planning to restore my computer back to the settings they were before I installed a program. </s>
<s> This is no virus or spyware threat but the program messed up some of my settings that I can't restore. </s>
<s> I have even uninstalled the program a number of times leaving me with the same results. </s>
<s> All I want is to go back to the same settings I had before I installed the program. </s>
<s> Will I still have all my files I had on the restore point I have selected before the date? </s>
<s> Except the Programs I have installed and files I created will all be deleted after that date of the restore point I have selected. </s>
<s> How long will it take, will my computer be stable and usable? </s>
<s> Is the HP System Restore Utility found in the Start Menu&gt;Programs&gt;....&gt;System Tools&gt;System Restore application right for me and what I need? </s>
<s> Any suggestions and help to my situation? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Two links with some info: http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/helpandsupport/learnmore/systemrestore.mspx http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084 Note that this feature (if enabled, which it is by default) takes a seizable amount of hard disk space in a 'folder' called System Volume Information. </s>
<s> You can't see how much it is using the standard tools. </s>
<s> To delete everything and start anew (but that means you can't go back before now) turn it off and on again, as described in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I need to do this by tomorrow. </s>
<s> So if I select system restore it will delete everything and try to come back to that stage in time by like, reinstalling? </s>
<s> Hi, I used the advice you gave Bob and the screen that says [F10] HP Recovery does show, but when I press F10 it boots up normally and no utility screen comes up. </s>
<s> Why does it do that? </s>
