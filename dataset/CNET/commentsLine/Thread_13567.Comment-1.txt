i'm using direct vga to vga from my lenovo laptop to a hannspree 25&quot; lcd 1080p tv.
my laptop is supposed to be able to support a second monitor, and the tv has the vga port with pc input mode.
however the signal doesnt make it to the tv.
when i plug in the cable my laptop recognizes theres a second monitor (i can move things off the screen) and a second monitor appears in the display settings.
how can i troubleshoot the problem?
