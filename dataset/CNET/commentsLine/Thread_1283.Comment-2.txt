has a problem.
seems that your third wire ground is not continuous from the computer to the ground in the main box.
the erratic shut down times are simply when you have enough of a static charge.
the path of the current [which can be momentarily high] should flow with extremely low resistance and voltage level in the ground wiring, through the ground path.
also could be caused by a ground wire problem within the power supply itself.
a ups or surge protector in the line???
is your mobo properly grounded to the mounting plate??
?
