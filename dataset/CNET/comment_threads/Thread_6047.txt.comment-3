Yep Corey, I am a moron.
Ok, only 1/2 joking.
I think I know what an &quot;input&quot; does, but what am I looking for?
Is is some kind of hole on the back of the monitor?
What would it say, ie.
a number or letters of some kind?
Or is it something the original 'disk' or booklet that came with the monitor would have written down in it?
Thanks for the help, you're the only one.
