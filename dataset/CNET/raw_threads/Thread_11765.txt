9467	0	372283	3191754	NR	TheException	12/6/09 9:55 AM	1.2600933E12	Converting an internal hard drive to an external one	My old laptop is basically kaput. If I try to boot my comp, it may crash the hard drive. I'd like to remove my old laptop's hard drive and somehow use it as a secondary hard drive on my newer laptop (so that my old hard drive won't crash and so that I can transfer files off it). What do I need to make this a reality?
