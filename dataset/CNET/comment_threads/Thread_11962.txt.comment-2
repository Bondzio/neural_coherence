Can I have one??
Instead of the ASUS graphics check out the ATI Radeon X850 family.
They're considered top of the line.
And since you have all that money, get a pair of WD Raptor 36GB 10,000rpm SATA drives.
Set them up as a RAID0 array and 'stripe' them.
This will really make that system honk.
You might as well use XP Pro 64-bit for the OS.
It can be had for $140 (OEM) at TigerDirect.
It will still run 32-bit stuff.
and life goes on... Jack
