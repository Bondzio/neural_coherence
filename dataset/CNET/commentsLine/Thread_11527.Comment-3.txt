thanks for the info, but i found exactly the same thing in my search.
problem is, my connection in the pc is different; i don't have the bar bit.
just three rows across the connection, with one hole missing on the bottom row, 3 from the edge.
still, it has the digital symbol on face, so it must be a digital connection.
right?
i'm confused.
