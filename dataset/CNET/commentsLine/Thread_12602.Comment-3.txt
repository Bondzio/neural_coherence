for filing on to my cnet folder and helpful posts.
(i keep a folder with helpful posts from you and others on my hard drive.)
you should be a technical writer.
wonderful!
your post is really easy to understand.
what about becoming a moderator?
i will post back to you with my results.
your help is great!

i also think that this post will be worthwhile to many others seeking the same solution and how to do it.
thanks for the tip on upgrading firewire at the same time.
never thought of upgrading firewire while upgrading usb2.
