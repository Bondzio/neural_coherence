take a volt meter to the cmos battery and if it's the common cr2032 it must be over 3 volts.
next, research bad caps.
finally since there are no make, models here, that's also a sign of an overtaxed power supply.
it's a shame details are missing as it could be one of the common issues but without details, you have to check these and more.
