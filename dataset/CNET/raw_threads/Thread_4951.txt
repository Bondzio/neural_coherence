After switching from PC to Mac and hooking up my MP730 my prints all turn out at about 50% or smaller, jammed up into a corner of the letter size sheets. I've looked through all the preferences, print menus, etc to no avail. It happens everytime, no matter what the program is I'm printing from - Word, a Web page, Photoshop, etc. This never happened when hooked up to my PC. I can't find drivers for the MP730 on Apple's site, so don't know what to do or whom to contact. Advice anyone?
