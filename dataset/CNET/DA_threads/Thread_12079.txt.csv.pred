1.1.1	I just got a brand new 24&quot; Dell Monitor that has both a HDMI and DVI-D port, as does my video card for my PC.	St
1.1.2	Question - which is better to use, or does it matter.	St
1.1.3	As a side note I do know HDMI carries both Audio and Video, while the DVI-D does not carry audio, but that is not an issue for me.	St
1.1.4	I have the sound taken care of through my sound card and a seperate external speaker config.	St
1.1.5	So I am asking strictly for the graphic part of it.	St
1.1.6	does one work better?	St
1.1.7	Or is it both digital signals and thus pretty much the same?	St
1.1.8	Finally, I assume either will give a better picture than if I use the VGA connection (which I also have) - correct?	St
1.2.1	oops - I meant vga in original title (sorry for the type)	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	I thought as much, but thanks for the clairification.	Polite
1.4.2	much appreciated.	St
1.4.3	I would of hated to use one connection if the other was a better choice.	St
1.5.1	The HDMI and DVI interfaces are logically identical, there is no difference in image quality whatsoever.	St
1.5.2	Forget VGA, it has zero to offer you unless you ever need to use an old monitor for some reason.	St
1.5.3	Naturally you should always set the video adapter resolution in Windows to match the LCD monitor's native resolution, any other setting causes a noticeable losss of image quality.	St
1.5.4	SC	St
