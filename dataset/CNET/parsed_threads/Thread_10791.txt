<s> 3 times this weekend my computer had the blue screen on it saying it was dumping the physical memory. </s>
<s> Nobody was using it, I just saw the message as I was walking by. </s>
<s> The first 2 times I rebooted, it started up normally. </s>
<s> The 3rd time it gave me a ''harddrive not found'' error. </s>
<s> I am using XP sp2. </s>
<s> The hard drive is less than 6 months old. </s>
<s> I don't have any extra hard drives, just a cd-rom & a 3'' floppy. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> What happened immediately before the memory dump, did you download/install anything? </s>
<s> Were you connected to the internet? </s>
<s> Otherwise check your physical connections, power and IDE (if relevent), then go to the BIOS on boot and see if the primary device is recognised. </s>
<s> I checked the connections, but everything looked alright. </s>
<s> When I tried a different plug in, it started working just find. </s>
<s> Thank god it was something easy. </s>
<s> Thank you very much. </s>
