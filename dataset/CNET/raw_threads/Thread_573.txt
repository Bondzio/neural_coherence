I have just set up a wireless network in my home and everything works great except that i lose sthe signal for my laptop on the second floor. I have a 3com OfficeConnect Wireless 11G cable/dsl Router. Does 3com make an signal extender for their routers? I have emailed them but to no avail. My house is made of solid concrete, I live in Mexico. If they do not make that product what would be my best option for use of my laptop on the second floor? Appreciate any help you all can provide.

While the 802.11n standard is not yet out, router manufacturers are already producing units with increased speed and range. 2. You might use a high-gain antenna, either purchased or home-made, with your present router. (See www.freeantennas.com for more info.) 3. If there is a place on the second floor where you get a decent signal, you could place a wireless repeater there to re-broadcast throughout the second floor. 4. There are units which use your power wiring to carry the signal. You would plug one unit into a power outlet near the wireless router, and another into a power outlet on the second floor to re-broadcaast there. You can Google these options for more information. BTW, while it might be desirable for an extenderto be from the same manufacturer as the router, it is not usually necessary if they adhere strictly to the 802.11g standard. Hope this helps Frank

Belkin and a few others have what is called homelink which is basically a bridge the lets you send your network further using the house 120VAC wiring. I use one unit by my router and one in my shop, which is about 150 ft away and has metal walls, in the shop I have a 2nd wireless router/access point. I have suggested this for use in some large homes and they have worked well.
