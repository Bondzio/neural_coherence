<s> Alright, so I am waiting for black friday to buy all (most) of my pc components to build a new pc. </s>
<s> This is the first pc I have ever built but my dad is an electrical engineer, which will hopefully help. </s>
<s> I basically want a computer that can game (including crysis).. but in all honesty I will probably end up just doing web and programming stuff.. but still want to game every now and then. </s>
<s> 1.Budget: Currently the build up there is &lt;$500 so trying to keep it that way. </s>
<s> 2.Brands: No preference. </s>
<s> 3.Multitasking: Not ridiculous amounts but I want to be able to. </s>
<s> 4.Gaming: I actually never game but I definitely want to be able to (and I will try it for awhile) 5.Calculations: No 6.Overclocking: I don't want to over clock but it would be nice if I had the option (currently the mobo and processor are said to be oc compatible. </s>
<s> 7.Storage: Eh. </s>
<s> Ive never filled a computer to 80gb but there are cheap hds that have way more...so whatever. </s>
<s> 8.Legacy Support: No, this is a completely new build. </s>
<s> 9.Operating System: Do you want Windows XP or Vista, or Linux compatibility? </s>
<s> All of them 10.Case: I'm not educated enough to know what type of case I want. </s>
<s> 11.Accessories: Already got'em. </s>
<s> 12.Recycled Components: If anything, just hd. </s>
<s> 13.Monitor: Got one (22). </s>
<s> 14.Stores: Trustable stores. </s>

<s> It's not free so tack 100 to 200 on the list so that leaves us 400 to build a machine to run Crysis. </s>
<s> We know that we'll want a dual core CPU and 2GB RAM so that's a bare minimum. </s>
<s> Now blow the rest of the budget on the video card from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2064.html Please get as much video card as you can as Cysis is going to use it all. </s>

<s> you can OC just about anything if you want to consider overclocking your system, have someone help or get components that allow you to reap the benefits of overclocking without much trouble. </s>
<s> The low end C2D's get really good (+1GHz) Overclocks. </s>
<s> On AMD's side we have the 5000+ and 5400+ Black Editions, the adjustable multiplier helps, bump it up and you can get 3.2 w/out voltage increases, if you need more, set multiplier to 15 and play with the FSB and vcore. </s>

<s> What do you think? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> don't put rebates in your budget. </s>
<s> that ram costs $40 for 2gb. </s>
<s> if you've only got $500 to spend, don't spend $600 thinking you'll get the $100 back in rebates. </s>
<s> some rebate clearance houses are on shaky ground. </s>
<s> http://www.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTU4NCwsLGhlbnRodXNpYXN0 the ram i suggested is $48 for 4gb. </s>
<s> some games can consume 2gb on their own, so getting just 2gb is being very short-sighted. </s>
<s> also, you're paying $100 for a case+fan+power rather supply than $75 sonata iii which includes all three. </s>
<s> if you like the other case, fine, but you say you don't want to try to keep the build to $500 so why spend extra money if you don't have to. </s>
<s> likewise, what features are on your $110 mobo that the $80 mobo lacks? </s>
<s> and you've said that you want to be able to play crysis. </s>
<s> but you're trying to cheap out on the video card. </s>
<s> look at the benchmarks... a 9600gt will struggle in crysis. </s>
<s> never go over 5400+ on Athlon X2's Processor: AMD Athlon X2 5000+ BE Overclock to 3.2 and leave it there or AMD Athlon X2 5400+ X2, Overclock to 3.5 (hint, a multiplier only OC won't get you that far, play with fsb and multiplier combos) </s>
<s> I trust rebates, I wouldn't be surprised in waiting on $300+ in rebates, I don't mind I am actually going to go for $80 case+powersupply, screw the fan. </s>
<s> Same case, this psu- http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817341010 (Combo deal makes it $50) Can you suggest me a better mobo? </s>
<s> I picked it b/c of the good rating. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
