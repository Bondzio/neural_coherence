1.1.1	I have a Sony Vaio desktop ( RCX5550 ) computer running Windows XP with an internal CD drive and an internal CDR drive.Yesterday I went to open the CDR and it would n't open .	St
1.1.2	I then clicked on my computer to open it that way and it did n't exist anymore under the drives listed .	St
1.1.3	What could have happened that deleted it from the system ?	Ques
1.1.4	The cd drive is fine ( E : ) but the CDR is nowhere to be found .	St
1.1.5	I had system restore turned off so I ca n't try that method .	St
1.1.6	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	Open case and with power-OFF , reseat the cables to that drive .	St
1.2.2	Reseat several times , including the power cable .	St
1.2.3	Restart system and check results .	St
1.2.4	If it works , great , you had minor problem .	St
1.2.5	Upon boot-up does the bios report it ?	Ques
1.2.6	If not , then more than likely the CD drive is dead or done in , replace .	St
1.2.7	While there can be s/w glithces , more often than not , h/w failure is the cause , nothing can be repaired , just replace .	St
1.2.8	If you were having some difficlties prior to this , that 's a good reason to replace .	St
1.2.9	You can try cleaning the drive out , but that 's alast gasp effort .	St
1.2.10	I leave any other possible cause to other posters .	St
1.2.11	I found so many CD drive problems are resolved by replacement and thier cost is very reasonable .	St
1.2.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Could I have deleted it by mistake ?	Ques
1.3.2	I was trying to delete some files due to the fact I started getting a low memory message.If I did , how could I re-install it .	St
1.3.3	Also how do you access thebios .	St
1.3.4	I know each computer is different but what are some of the ways to check that ?	Ques
1.4.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-6142_7-0.html ? forumID=5 & messageID=1536441 & threadID=136396 Works for me .	St
1.5.1	Your recovery/restore CD should have the files you need .	St
1.5.2	Depending the nature of that CD you *may* directly select the drivers for the CD drive in question .	St
1.5.3	You thus re-install that way or if you know the product find the driver directly from the Sony support website or the CD drive maker support website , get related driver .	St
1.5.4	Yeah , you could have made an error in wiping out some files that supported that CD drive , but at least it should have reported being present though not active .	St
1.5.5	Check , the h/w device manager and see what it states about that drive , there too can re-install drivers needed at that time .	St
1.5.6	As for the bios , you manual should give a clear method to access or upon boot-up any key sequence to eneter the bios .	St
1.5.7	I suggest for now hitting eiother F1 or F2 key if so stated , otherwise find what your manual states .	St
1.5.8	This info should also be repeated at the Sony support website as well .	Sug
1.5.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	I tried removing the upper and lower filters from the registry but I only showed the lower filters which I removed and it did n't do anything .	St
1.6.2	Thanks anyway .	St
1.7.1	Windows installed the drive because the BIOS reports it as there .	St
1.7.2	If the BIOS does not report the drive , Windows wo n't display it .	St
1.7.3	Follow the previous poster 's advice .	St
1.7.4	With a can of air and the power off , open the computer and blow it out .	St
1.7.5	Carefull reseat all the cables .	St
1.7.6	Watch the screen when you power up .	St
1.7.7	Note if the BIOS detects both optical drives .	St
1.7.8	If it does , most likely Windows will show your drive .	St
1.7.9	( Note that it never uninstalled the problem drive in the first place . )	St
1.7.10	If it does not show up in the BIOS , you will probably have to replace the drive .	St
