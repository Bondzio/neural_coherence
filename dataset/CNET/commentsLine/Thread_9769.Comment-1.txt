how to solder?
the pins are bent.
data cable motherboard connector.
can it be replaced?
or removed and resortered?
i removed and reconnected the data cable from the motherboard to the 2 dvd-rw drives.
the last 2 pins are bent over.
if the motherboard is removed, is there a data cable connector replacement or is that part soldiered onto the motherboard?
