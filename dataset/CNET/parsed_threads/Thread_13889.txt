<s> So my Gateway desktop (as well as my notebook) have both recently died about the same time after 5 years... strange, but anyway, I'm looking at Dell desktop to replace the home system. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend more than 500-600. </s>
<s> There are many options, but some general questions: Can I use my Gateway monitor with a Dell? </s>
<s> (I suppose not, but why not?) </s>
<s> Can I use the Office and/or Works installation CDs to install those programs on the new Dell? </s>
<s> These came with the Gateway systems. </s>
<s> I have heard that I can't use the XP installation CD either, but has Vista worked out all the bugs for a home user who is not using his system for gaming? </s>
<s> Is it worth buying the option to keep XP OS on the new Dell? </s>
<s> What will I need to ensure I can enable wireless networking at home? </s>
<s> Lastly, I am interested in the Optiplex because I have read (don't recall where) that the tech support for business machines is US based and not via India and an overall quicker and better experience. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> I am considering the Optiplex and if the tech support is not as described above, I may go with the Inspiron. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Use can use the monitor from Gateway on a Dell system. </s>
<s> You will need to tune it in if outside of its &quot;native resolution&quot;. </s>
<s> Any s/w that came with the Gateway in all likelihood may not work in a Dell as it verifies if the OEM EULA applies. </s>
<s> However, excluding the OS it may work, but it varies. </s>
<s> The OS itself definitely needs to be run under a Gateway system as the EULA rules applies here too. </s>
<s> Your new system will have an OS if Dell to be Vista. </s>
<s> Vista, has worked out some kinks but fixes come out regularly, it teething pain is behind it. </s>
<s> If you can hold out Win7 is supposed to be better. </s>
<s> Dell support if you need is there but as you stated, you really don't have a choice, you go with the plan. </s>
<s> If you want so-called US support, then get a business system or from the business website, but read the &quot;fine print&quot;. </s>
<s> You may to query in the Dell forum for a better answer as Dell people are there. </s>
