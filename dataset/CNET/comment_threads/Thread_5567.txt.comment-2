I am guessing you have flash on your website?
Just change the Flash to HTML 5 or H.264.
It many take sometime depending on the website, since I have never worked with H.264 I can not say how fast that programing goes, but I have worked with HTML 5 & it would not be that hard, you do all the work behide the scenes then late one night which over.
Look at it this way, you have a website that can not be accessed by about 2 million people & growing everyday, changing it to one of the above ( HTML5 or H.264 ) will open up your company to a larger market without messing with those who right now can access it.
For me since I gotten my iPad about a month ago, I hardly turn on my 17&quot; PC laptop anymore & the few times I have it's just for Photoshop 90% of the time; only this past week I have used my PC to access the internet & that is just to view the BP rover cams because all websites are running that in Flash.
