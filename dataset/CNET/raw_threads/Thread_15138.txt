Hi, Can somebody help me please, I have a Toshiba PX1265SE-1G16 external hard drive, it has onspec regen in stalled on what I think is a virtual drive, the only problem is is that when I enter the password for the drive, it says that the drive is enabled but when I go to my computer, it is only showing up as a cd drive with only 19.7 mb. the drive itself is 200gb. I have loads of pictures and files on there which i do not want to loose. can anybody help? Is there a way of removing the virtual cd drive, thus allowing me access to my files? I am running windows 7 on a Samsung NC10. thank you.

It's their software and if they fail, then the next call is to http://www.drivesavers.com -&gt; All externals fail like this. These are not &quot;storage&quot; but temporary copies which we must backup. For those that don't backup because it costs too much, just wait till they see the data recovery bills. Bob

I cannot delete anything as it will not give me access, It says it's a network drive. any ideas???? Thanks again. Matt

If you use some non-standard feature then you need to ask Toshiba how to recover. AT THE TOP OF THIS FORUM ARE THE USUAL TITLES TO TRY but if you value your files I must stick to my original advice.

My bet is they get that call too often and may have a fix that does not create the need for file recovery. -&gt; But this is the lesson that these drives are not storage. We must have a backup copy of what we can't lose. Bob
