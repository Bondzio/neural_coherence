I want the student to be able to print wirelessly or by attaching USB cable to her MACbook notebook. I have read some reviews on CNET that state you cannot have both conditions in operation at same time - Reviews of Canon MP620 (the printer I am interested in) revealed the following comments. A more troublesome issue is that you have to set the printer to connect by either wireless or wired network. Allowing both is not an option. That means you can't have the printer set to work on a wired network, and then connect to it with an adhoc wireless connection from, say, your notebook, on an occasional basis. Are there any All in One printers that allow both wired and wireless hookup? I do not need Fax capability.

Take all computer and printer make and model numbers (some times series, as well) with you along with the make and model number of the modem/switch you have. A PC shop would be better then a large discount store. Ask many intelligent questions before you buy and explain your needs clearly and repeatedly. Make sure it will work for you before you buy, well at least as best you can be sure. Matching brand names on products is best. (example: netgear modem = netgear printer server) Issues here are compatibilities, they must all work together. BTW, Connectivity can be a nightmare. Good luck. This thread untracked.

I had Canon ink jet printers previously and my son got a HP with his laptop, ink for the HP all in one brand is very expensive and when the ink ran out he stopped using it, the previous canon's were very expensive for ink too. I bought an inexpensive brother laser for B&W and the Kodak ESP for anything color and also printing double sided. Am very happy with both my Kodak and Brother.
