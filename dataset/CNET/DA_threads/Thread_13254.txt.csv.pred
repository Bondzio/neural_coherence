1.1.1	I have a problem with this safely remove hardware thing for quite a while and I heard that if I just ignore this and just plug the external HD out it will cause a corruption within the HD itself so I tried to remove the device safely from the system at all times.	St
1.1.2	But recently, when I'm done transferring files from my external HD to my computer and I close all the windows and safely removed the hardware an error message saying: &quot;The device 'Generic Volume' cannot be stopped right now.	St
1.1.3	Try stopping the device again later.&quot; I also have tried to go to some other drive first like my C: drive and then go to my documents files and close everything and refresh the whole dekstop and when I try again the error message appeared again!	St
1.1.4	I wonder howcome there's no program running but the HD can't be stopped.	St
1.1.5	Is there like any hidden program running at the background that I may not notice?	St
1.1.6	please help!	Sug
1.2.1	Some running program is feeding it data.	St
1.2.2	Could be a virus, but probably not.	St
1.2.3	Processes don't just stop immdeiately when you click on the X at right corner of a window.	St
1.2.4	You may want to wait a while.	Sug
1.2.5	If that doesn't work, just wank the thing off.	St
1.2.6	It won't cause any serious problems... err... usually... And what is with Generic Volumes?	St
1.2.7	Isn't there a driver or something?	St
1.2.8	o_O	St
