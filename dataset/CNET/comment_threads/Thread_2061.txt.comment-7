Thanks again for your help Ray, To be totally honest I'm now starting to think that the gain is not worth the pain (in the wallet) at the moment and an upper end socket A might be best as a stop gap for a year or so while the 64 bit market stabilizes and Microsoft gets its self sorted out.
The biggest benefit of a 64 bit cpu would seem to be best appreciated at the heart of a completely new system running a 64 bit OS.
Although I do enjoy a bit of gaming, DV occupies a lot of my PC time at present and encoding 11+Gb of AVI into 4.25Gb of DVD is enough to bring all but the most spritely systems to a snails pace(not to mention flame grilling your hardware) so all round speed is a big consideration for me.
I'm afraid I don't share you're experience of vacuum valves but I did grow up with the humblest beginings of home computing in the eighties when 32kb of memory was a big deal (I now carry a cellphone with a 32Mb memory stick in it).
I wish I could also find a way of preserving HDD's, I have to defrag after every capture just so Pinnacle 8 can process the file without errors - I'm on my third in two years.
One final question, am I likely to encounter any problems with XP after the new mainboard/CPU is installed?
This is the first time I've changed the whole setup and I'm not too sure where the stumbling blocks are.
