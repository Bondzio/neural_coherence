It has 40 GB Hrad disk which has 4 partitions and 70 % of each partition is free. My computer has recently developed this issue that it restarts without any notice. Previosuly I installed Windows XP. Whenever i used to go online, it was restarting. Then I installed Windows 2000 Pro with SP 4, its re-starting frequency has lessened. I spoke to a technical guy who told me that there might be the problem with Power supply. I changed the Power supply but still this problem persists. He then told me to change the motherboard. I have updated antivirus software and spyware and ad ware. They report no suspicious activity. My question is what could be the possible problem and its solution? Is the motherboard change is the solution? Sarfraz

But just about any component could cause that to happen for one reason or another (or no reason). Since you have reinstalled windows and it still happens, I am not very inclined to think it is a software issue, although it is possible.

Previously with Norton 2004 I had no troubles. May not be what is wrong with yours (don't know what antivirus software you are using) but may be worth disabling your antivirus for a while to see what happens.

Hope it could have give you some ideas.

Use a can of compressed air to blow dust off of all case filters, fans, heatsinks. Remove RAM and blow out dust from slots. Your mulitple Windows installations may have corrupted one another over time. You might want to backup all important files and perform a fresh OS installation. Clarification: You say that you updated antivirus/antispyware programs and that they report nothing. Did you scan with them? Try Ewido, if you haven't already done so. Using any P2P filesharing programs (Limewire, Kazaa, etc.)? They are an open door for malicious programs.
