1.1.1	I have a 400 mhz computer that I put in a sound card and plays cd music that is hooked up to the cd rom drive.	St
1.1.2	but when I conect to the sound card no sound I think it had an onboard sound card on irq 9 how do you disable it.	St
1.2.1	Go inside of Bios and you will be able to disable onboard sound there.	St
1.2.2	1) Reboot after you disable onboard sound 2) If the sound card is installed then you install the software for the sound card.	St
1.2.3	3) Then you configure your card if you have digital speakers, make sure the card is set up for that, if not disable digital sound.	St
1.2.4	4) Good luck Wendell H	Polite
