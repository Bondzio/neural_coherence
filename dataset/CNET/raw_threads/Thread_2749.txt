It has a type of chip that has a VIA logo with the characters: VT82C686B . I tried google-ing this up but no luck... Any more info you might need to try and figure the specs out just let me know.

If you can boot to system BIOS, the model number may be there. Otherwise, you need to search the motherboard for something stamped/printed on it. It won't be on a chip; it will be on the main board that holds all the chips and slots. It's usually a little bigger than the other writing on the board.

Also check for the MB Revision number as that often distinguishes which production version of the board you have and which BIOS and drivers it requires. VAPCMD
