I unstalled it, removed drivers, HP software, deleted any mention of HP in the Registry. Then, downloaded latest drivers from HP's website and reinstalled. STILL have problem. Any thoughts?

I would open the window and don't hit anything valuable with it. I'd write more but clues are slim. About the last hurrah test would be to see if Linux prints ok on it. Bob

It's got to be a software issue as the part of the page it prints looks fine. No Linux on my computer. I think for giggles I'll try a System Restore to before the problem began...

I still think this has something to do with a Windows Update conflict since I haven't installed anything else. I can't believe it's the printer, since it will print a &quot;Windows XP Printer Test Page&quot; perfectly when the printer is installed. Everything else prints 1/4 page then the Failed to Print error box comes up. I really like(d)the printer, but I don't know if I like it enough to do a Reformat to fix the problem, and it's sure not worth paying someone to troubleshoot this. Has anyone else run into this problem with a HP printer?

Test on another PC. 4. Test with another printer. 5. Move to another USB port. That last item is cruel. One owner dismissed it and the tech came out, moved to another USB port. Bill? $120. Go figure why people don't try free advice. Bob

I pluged the printer's USB cable directly into the PC's USB port, and bingo. Why the hell didn't the techs at HP think of that! THANK YOU!!

It was working and just stopped responding. Tried almost everything to get it going again. Computer would not recognize it at all, even after uninstall and reinstall on same port. Not sure what made me finally try a different port on same computer but I was instantly back up and printing. Sometimes, things just work out. =) Don

If the port still works for other things is there a software fix that needs to be considered as well? Just curious as I have recently had the same experience.

Sorry but without a long discussion about USB and more... and even then we only have a theory why yours did that. Let's go with a working printer anyday... Bob
6594	15	242573	2503912	2503235	Rob10	6/3/07 6:23 AM	1.18085178E12	Sometimes the easiest fix works	The thing that had me confused was that my computer was recognizing the printer and I could get it to print something from it. Plus, everyone told me it must be the printer due to it's age. Glad I hung in there and tried one more post that Bob was kind enough to respond to. Happy to hear yours was a happy ending as well!
