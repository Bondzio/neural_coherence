<s> I'm looking into purchasing a mainstream type printer for basic text documents as well as the occational colored documents. </s>
<s> I'm not looking into a printer that can feed out detailed pictures but if the price was right, I wouldn't mind a high end result. </s>
<s> My budget is roughly $150CDN MAX and I've been looking at the HP Deskjet 3845, 3620 (very similar or so it seems), HP OJ5510 4-in-1, Lexmark P6250 3-in-1, HP PSC 1610 3-in-1 and Brother MFC420CN 6-in-1 (Brother; a company I know little about). </s>
<s> Which of these, or any others I have not mensioned, is a the best reliable machine I can buy within my budget. </s>
<s> As well, which make has the least expensive ink replacements? </s>
<s> I am leaning towards HP or Lexmark because I am not sure about Brother (i've only seen commercials on television). </s>
<s> Most of these also have scanners. </s>
<s> How are scanner/printer-in-1 combinations? </s>
<s> The scanner is okay? </s>
<s> I'm thinking I might as well get one that has a scanner as it will come in handy in the future. </s>
<s> Thanks in Advance - Mo </s>
<s> I would receommend HP based upon my past experience. </s>
<s> The all in one printers are a compromise at all that they do and if one function breaks your whole machine is down for repair. </s>
<s> Do you recommend me getting the printer only models appose to the ones with scanners/fax built in? </s>
<s> How is each function a compromise? </s>
<s> The printer will not be of the same quality on the all-in-one compared to the regular printer? </s>
<s> Depending upon the individual model, the all in one may or may not have as good a printer, but there are compatability issues with all in ones. </s>
<s> You can do a pretty good job of faxing with a flatbed scanner and printer, so I would go with that choixce rather than the all in one. </s>
<s> Isn't that the all-in-one with fax/scanner/copier/printer? </s>
<s> Or are you saying getting a scanner/fax and a printer seperately? </s>
<s> A flatbed scanner is a stand alone scanner. </s>
<s> Unless you do a high volume of faxes I would get a printer and a stand alone scanner. </s>
<s> If you need color, get an ink jet printer. </s>
<s> If not, get a Laser. </s>
<s> Laser toner will last a long time compared to ink jet cartridges. </s>
<s> Laser printers do not support colored documents? </s>
<s> I need a crisp text output as well as decent colored images. </s>
<s> PPM is not a big issue but what does the dpi have to do with? </s>
<s> These mostly had 4800 dpi resolution. </s>
<s> Color lasers are available, but for about 20 times your budget. </s>
<s> Any HP printer that I have listed? </s>
<s> (Without scanner because you said compatibility issues) </s>
<s> NIL </s>
