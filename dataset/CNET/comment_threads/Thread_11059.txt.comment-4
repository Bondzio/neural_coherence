There isn't much info on that model at 2Wire.com, but this says that there should be 4 ethernet ports on the 1701HG in addition to the wireless capability: http://www.2wire.com/?p=106 I might be wrong, but it looks like the 2Wire 1701HG is a router that can handle 4 wired connections and multiple wireless connections at the same time.
You wouldn't need another wireless router.
Am I missing something?
