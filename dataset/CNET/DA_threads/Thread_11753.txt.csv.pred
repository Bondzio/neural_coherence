1.1.1	Does anyone on this site have any news about Windows8 mobile devices ( phones or tablets ) coming to market anytime soon ?	Ques
1.1.2	I recently started a software development company , in partnership with my brother and father .	St
1.1.3	We primarily develop Windows Apps .	St
1.1.4	We are currently looking into the possibility of moving towards being able to offer our potential clients mobile apps .	St
1.1.5	As such , we are exploring which mobile platform will be most beneficial for us to learn how to develop in.So , our question is , which mobile platform ( iOS , Android , Windows ) will grow the most in the next twelve months ? Also , would it truly be easier to integrate a Windows ( desktop ) app with a Windows ( mobile ) counterpart ( as common sense would dictate ) , or would it be just as difficult an integration process , regardless of the mobile platform we choose ? Any insight or advice on this issue would be greatly appreciated .	Ques
1.1.6	Thank you in advance .	St
1.2.1	Windows 8 is NOT for phones ...	St
1.2.2	If you want to program in similar way , use Windows Phone 7.5 .	St
1.2.3	Win8 is only for tablets or computers ( it works without touchscreen too ! ) .	St
1.2.4	No phone would support it ... it needs 1 GB of RAM and A LOT of memory ( it 's not much for PCs , but it 's huge amounts for phones ) .	St
1.2.5	And also , metro style applications for Windows 8 require big resolution to run , i think it 's 1024x768 or something like that ... ( also not big for PCs but huge for phones ) For growing ... Now Android is growing faster than any onther OS , but i think when Windows 8 will be released , the Metro Style will become more popular and people will start buying Windows Phone , especially older people because it 'll be easier to learn how to use it if you have a PC with win8 .	St
1.2.6	And if you develop games , iOS is the best platform for that That 's my advice it 's your choice	St
1.3.1	will be the fastest growing since it is new and hold 0 % of the market since it 's not released yet .	St
1.3.2	The best is to develop in Android , IOS and Windows 8 then you get all markets .	St
