the geiger-counter seek noise that i have heard some hdds make [one was a maxtor and it did fail see details below], i have had work pcs with hdds that made the same noise and those did not fail, [make unknown].
my pc supplier went down the pan [taking my pc's paid-for extended warranty and support with it].
my very noisy home pc [fans] started making intermittent clicking noises for about a month, i knew that this might be the signs of an impending hdd failure, but i [stupidly] thought that it might also have been a fan.
however, because of the intermittent nature of the sounds and the noise of the fans, i could not be certain where the sounds were coming from.
so i ran a backup, but with cds it's such a pain, [no dvd writer at that time].
so i ran hdd diagnostics, looked at the hdd smart monitoring software, all assured me that no tec was predicted for at least several years, well you've guessed, i shouldn't have believed these [i still thought it could be a fan - doh!]
and the hdd let me down!
do not rely on hdd monitoring software!
these utilities may predict a failure, but failure to identify any problems does not indicate that no problems are present.
the problem was that the mbr of the maxtor diamondmax 16 60 gb hdd in my two-year-old pc became corrupted and the pc would not boot, [i think the message was 'boot disk fail'].
using the free bart pe based bootable ubcd4win rescue cd, [ [a43 explorer] i was able to determine that the data was ok. however, because i had not sufficient confidence in my diagnosis and the consequences of getting it wrong seemed so bad [loss of data], so i held off mbr repair until a new hdd was installed.
then i transferred data and settings to the new hdd using ubcd4win [a43].
the hdd was later diagnosed as close to death [the actual description was the 'drive is failing'] with maxtor powermax utilities from the free dos-based [yes i know it's really linux] ultimatebootcd, [ the bearings are failing [my diagnosis based on the sounds that it made].
i now know that you can listen to your hdd using a screwdriver or similar object pressed between your ear and the case of the hdd, but you will need to extract the hdd from its bay [pc switched-off while you do this].
used in this manner it allows you to listen to the hdd, [it screens out the airborne noise while conducting the sound to your skull, much like a mechanic working on a car engine or a physician's stethoscope].
the sound from the bearings isn't loud like the '.wav' file and was completely inaudible above the fan noise, but might have been heard in a quiet pc.
download the sounds your hdd should never make from: - ' - exclude the quotes this has led me to believe that there was a dual failure mechanism [the bearings could only be heard above the fan noise using the 'screwdriver' method], but the clicking sound was clearly audible, but since it only occurred every now and then, unlike the relevant '.wav' file, i was unable to be certain of its origin.
normal hdd bearings will be inaudible in an operating pc.
if your hdd makes sounds that even remotely resemble these examples [mine did], you are already neck deep in the smelly brown stuff, and the level is rising rapidly!
hope this helps pc victim
