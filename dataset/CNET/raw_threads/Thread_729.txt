In other words, I have an AMD 2700+ (~2.01 GHz) and a 9600XT. If I were to uprade one, which one should it be to boost gaming performance? Thanks.

So then it looks as if your message has a subject line only. The subject line is so vague that many won't bother. Possibly make the post again without the NT, and then send a mod alert from this post of yours and ask them to remove it. They can then also remove my reply. Most times the Mods will comply.

My 2700+ is running at the same speed as a 3200+ by upping the bus from 333 to 400 and has been for 6 months. If you want to upgrade the processor to a worthwhile level, it will mean going to a new motherboard as well. For video, try an agp nvidia 6600GT. It REALLY makes a difference over a 9600XT, honest. Mine plays Battlefield 2 and CS source at 1280x1024 no problems.
