<s> Today I put in a wireless internet card, the internet works fine, but the card seems to be causing a problem with my audio device. </s>
<s> When the wireless card is in my PC I get this odd static and screeching noise from my speakers/headphones. </s>
<s> I know the wireless card is causing it because if I take it out the noise goes away. </s>
<s> There are 3 open PCI slots between the two, I thought putting some space between them may help, but I was wrong, and I honestly have no idea what else to try. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If it matters, I'm running Winxp, the wireless card is Netgear wireless-g PCI adapter- WG311v3, and the audio device is a CMI8738/C3DX PCI Audio Device. </s>
<s> Does the volume of the noise increase when you turn up the speakers? </s>
<s> If so, the sound card could be picking it up. </s>
<s> If not, your speakers are probably doing so. </s>
<s> You can try taking the wireless card back and trying another brand. </s>
<s> I agree with the other poster as &quot;RF&quot; being the possible source of noise. </s>
<s> Afterall, the wireless card uses a signal(RF) to work. </s>
<s> If possible try another slot or relocate speakers. </s>
<s> But, since this also going thru the headphones, you simply are too close to the RF noise. </s>
<s> As you say, the card seems to be the source, then try another brand or replace and/or move the audio card or both. </s>
<s> If these are actually one slot next to the other, oh yeah move them apart. </s>
<s> If the audio is build-in, move only the wireless card. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
