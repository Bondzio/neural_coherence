<s> Im planning to install a second hard drive and firewire card in my desktop PC. </s>
<s> My question is can I install both the second hard drive and firewire card at the same time? </s>
<s> Or do I have to install and configure each of them separately? </s>
<s> Some OSes such as Linux would not take issue with such an addition. </s>
<s> Microsoft's Windows seems to trip over itself as we do this so I found it best to add one item at a time. </s>
<s> In closing, not all versions of Windows supports firewire and some versions of Windows needs patches for big drives. </s>
<s> The configuration of such is automatic except the hard disk partitioning and format. </s>
