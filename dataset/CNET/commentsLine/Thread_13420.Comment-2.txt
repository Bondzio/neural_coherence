i may not be the best to answer since i configure cisco routers from the command line.
all the major brands have very detailed manuals with pictures.
the largest issues is many people do not read or follow the instructions.
the part that you cannot avoid that is complex is the security.
mostly you can use wpa2 and be good.
what gets complex is some end user equipment will not support that so you have to figure out which option to use.
i hope your sister has a pc i don't think the nook has a ethernet port.
there are few routers you can configure via wireless out of the box and the ones that do require a good understanding of how wireless works since you will be changing the settings on the connection you are running on.
