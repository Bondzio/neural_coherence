I was given an older Gateway laptop with an Orinoco Wireless LAN Card built in.
I have updated the driver so that I could use WPA.
I have a Belkin Router G and a desktop and an iPod connected.
I get great connection speeds with my other devices through my DSL connection, however, the Gateway laptop is getting less than dial up speed (17k) I am sure it is some kind of setting/tweak.
Please provide me with any advice.
THanks.
