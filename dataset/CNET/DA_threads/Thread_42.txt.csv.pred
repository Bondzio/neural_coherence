1.2.3	Also get at least 6 gig of Ram .	St
1.2.4	Mine has 12 gig , but I think that is a little overkill .	St
1.2.5	Mine is Tri Channel Ram .	St
1.2.6	I know there is a debate about tri channel being no faster or better than the duel channel , But I disagree with that .	St
1.2.7	As for the monitor , get a 22 ' or bigger LED monitor .	St
1.2.8	They throw off very little heat and have a better picture than the LCDs .	St
