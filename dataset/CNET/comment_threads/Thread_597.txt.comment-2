I'd boot my Ubuntu CD (it's LIVE!)
and see if I can get in there BEFORE ANY DATA RECOVERY APPS are used.
Link about -&gt; http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/ At the top of this forum is the Lost and Found welcome post where you will find apps for free, free to try and recovery services.
