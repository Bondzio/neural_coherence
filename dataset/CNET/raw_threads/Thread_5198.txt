I just bought a camera and plan on buying mini DV camcorder to do some minor video editing. I would like to use my pc to watch tv and perform other media related events. I'm not a pc gamer... I have a big screen and an X-box so I get my fill of games from that. I've never really built a pc before but I've done some work inside the box before so I'm pretty sure I can get the thing up and running, I'm just not sure if its worth my time. I know you pay more for a pc rather than buying it part for part but i'm not too sure how much more and combine that with some of the service packages offered... and what it really comes down to is I'm just to lazy to price it out and see how much I will save if I build it myself. Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Whether you can or not, you leave yourself open to a lot of warranty hassles if you build your own, because every manufacturer can point the blame at a component you bought from somewhere else. There is also the issue of compatability among components as well. My hat is off to all who want to buils their own, but even though I know I could do it, I have seen the hassles many have, and don't need that grief.

Turn on your homebuilt and sparks fly and you wish you had had gone to the local store or just ordered online. I let the guys at the assembly plant take the blame for an incompatible component.
