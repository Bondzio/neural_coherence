having a cheap system only provides ease in its failure, sooner or later.
but since you already experienced a 2nd pc to die, maybe you got &quot;bad power&quot; like in ac.
i suggest if you don't already get a decent surge protector, a ac line conditioner plus a ups unit.
getting all these will help or provide a level of performance just to be stable at least from ac surges and the like, clean power.
rememeber, cheap is cheap and as you mentioned unit was from that source of known cheap stuff, well you get the picture.
replace the psu with a namebrand one and of at least 400w or better.
a cheap 500w is good if its way above your power needs, heck 550w psu units are becoming common.
as for the case on switch, if its truly touchy it maybe crappy construction or even broke.
find its connection on the mtrbd.
and unplug then replace with a simple monentarily contact sw. and see if the problem goes away.
nother one from a broke system case(test unit) will do fine.
try that and get back with results... tada -----willy
