(stupid phone) I've done my homework but all the different terms and features confuse me.
I know for sure I need HDMI (tv will serve as monitor for now) and two front usb 3.0 connectors.
When it comes to pci, pcie, sata, raid, etc...
I don't know what I'm looking at and the difference between a $150 or $250 mobo.
