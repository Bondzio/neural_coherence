<s> I'm a college student and just moved into a new apartment and don't want to pay the high price for the broadband that's available. </s>
<s> I have a boyfriend across the street with cheaper and better internet, but the distance is a little over 250 feet. </s>
<s> It's a clear path between apartments, minus the brick wall of both buildings. </s>
<s> My roomate has a desktop and is unwilling to get a PCI card, wants a USB adapter. </s>
<s> I have a laptop with a good wireless card, but it only works with Wireless G & B. I'm looking for the cheapest solution for a router and adapter that would work at the distance without being too finicky. </s>
<s> Most people I've talked to said not to waste money on Wireless N, but won't that make the cut range-wise? </s>
<s> Are there any good Wireless G rangeboosters out there that would cover the 250 feet without losing all the signal? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> &quot;without being too finicky.&quot; There it is. </s>
<s> You are at the outer limits of this technology and even the morning mist will interfere and it will become finicky. </s>
<s> You can research on google about antennas and more but the bottom line is the distance is over the mark. </s>
