hi, after leaving the computer off overnight, when it started up this morning the event 51 errors came back.
so, hoping it works (which it probably won't), i switched the page file to a &quot;system managed size&quot;.
if nothing works, i think i'll just ignore it for now.
also, i don't know if this is normal, but i realize that even though i have 400mb of unused physical memnory (ram) out of my total 1gb of ram, 700mb of the page file is being used.
i just thought that the page file was only supposed to be used if the system runs out of physical memory... any thoughts on that?
thanks
