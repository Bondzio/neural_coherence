These machines are connected to public network. At a given point in time, I need to isolate these machines from the public network in a way where - All these 4 machines can talk to each other using the assigned IP's. - These 4 machines cannot talk to any other nodes in the public network. no other machines outside these 4, will be able to ping these machines. Looking for a generic solution which would work across all Unix,linux,windows platforms. Please help. Regards, Ranjit

Depend on the exact router model, some routers have this in the base and some you need firewall features. Lets say your 4 example addresses are actually public routable IP The normal way to do this is to put in firewall rules or access lists that says these 4 addresses can only send or receive traffic from each other. Now if you are using private addresses and nating them it is a little different. You of course could just prevent these addresses from being natted. It just makes the firewall rules a little more tricky because you have to worry about both the real and the virtual addresses.
