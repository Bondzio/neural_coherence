<s> I have an old HP that ran windows 98SE that I think the power supply took a hit and would like to install the HD into another pc (gateway) running windows2000 pro. </s>
<s> I don't care about the data on the old HD, just would like to have the extra storage space for videos. </s>
<s> If this can be done I would appreciate any info as to how to do this. </s>
<s> Thanks, Rick </s>
<s> There must be some hundreds of web pages about how to add a hard disk to your PC so I'll not write about that. </s>
<s> However you don't have to worry that the drive had 98 or such on it. </s>
<s> You can format it for storage once you add the drive. </s>
