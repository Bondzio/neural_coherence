<s> I have an HP Pavilion dv2915nr notebook, with a Toshiba 250GB hard drive inside of it. </s>
<s> I have speedfan, a program that monitors fan speed, temperature, and has a S.M.A.R.T. </s>
<s> drive utility to show the health of the HDDs installed. </s>
<s> On my laptop, there are no drives shown, whereas my desktop shows my drive just fine, so I was wondering if my drive might not be supported, or something? </s>
<s> I even tried hddtemp in Linux, and while it gave me the HDD's temperature, it did not tell me anything about the health of the drive. </s>
<s> Notebook model: HP Pavilion dv2915nr Drive model: Toshiba MK2552GSX Software used: speedfan (Windows) & hddtemp (Linux) </s>

<s> Speedfan has one issue, it is ran by one person from what I have read so it doesn't support all systems and devices. </s>
<s> So no worries that SMART doesn't see some piece of hardware, the author probably hasn't gotten around to your particular hardwares yet. </s>
<s> It didn't tell me what I was looking for, and I think it linked me back to speedfan. </s>
<s> As for the suggestion that speedfan doesn't have a complete database, I can accept that. </s>
<s> Speedfan links to an external website to show more detailed results ... is there any way I can visit that site without using speedfan, and get the results for my drive? </s>
