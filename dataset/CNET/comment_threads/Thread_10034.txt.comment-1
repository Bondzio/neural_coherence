Hello...upgrading a Presario S4000NX.I've upgraded the ram to 1G...hard drive w/control card to 1T w/7200 rpm .
I am currently running Win 7rc...but my primary is XP Home.
What are the MAXIMUM SPECS in a PCI video card that I can use....or will any card bwork as long as its PCI???
Thanks in advance.
