After investigating the Hdd i took apart, it seems the HDD Reading pins , or whatever they are called, are slightly bent.
i'm going to try and get myself a old similar hdd and put the Hard disk in that one to see if it can still read my data.
And you're right if i had the tools and the skills (got skills but not much on Hardware) i wouldn't be asking.
but that's what forums are for, right!
