there are rules and methods to get this to work.
and in your post you write &quot;prefer not to have to create any new users on any of the computers trying to access it, but rather just use the user that is already trying.&quot; there is a method but it contradicts what you are asking so it may not be the solution.
but first.
that user must have an account to login and must have an account on the machine with the share they are trying to use.
this has not changed in over 10 years so i'm always wondering why one would try to usurp the rules.
and here is where it gets worse.
your words &quot;just use the user that is already trying.&quot; this could mean that you only want this user to access this and not &quot;everybody.&quot; you can't have it both ways and use windows networking.
please clarify your request so members can comment if it's the same old account, permission or firewall issue or if you truly don't want to create the needed account if enabling the guest account will do.
but your words tell me the guest account is not the solution.
remember i don't know if you've ever managed windows networking before so i can't guess what step you forgot.
and i don't duplicate the hundreds of web pages on how to set this up.
i only try to find where the issue is.
