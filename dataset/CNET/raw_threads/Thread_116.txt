But not sure which type of router to go with. I read the g is the standard, a is good for streaming video and music. Which is exactly what I want to do, stream from the pc to the xbox 360(mp3 and video). Any suggestions on which type of router and some suggested brands if you don't mind. Thanks in advance.
