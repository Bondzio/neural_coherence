I?ve got a question concerning the Lacie 2big Quadra (external raid drive with changable hd slots). The drive is Mac os extended formatted, I?m on OSX. Now, my 2big quadra has been collecting dust the past couple of years since I?ve completed the project stored on it. It has been kept as a backup only. The Lacie is configured in Fast Raid mode. However, now I also have a couple of unused 750GB wd SATA internal disk lying around... So my question is this: Can I remove the two disks on the Lacie with my old project from the trays, replace them with the unused WD disks, work on the drive, and then be able to switch back to the old drives without loosing data / Raid setup? Thus keeping the old disks as backup, if you get what I mean. I?m wondering, since both the old and the new setup will be configured in raid fast mode, and I can?t seem to find any mention of such a scenario in the manual or elsewhere. Ok! Thank you so much for any replies Yours Fredrik
