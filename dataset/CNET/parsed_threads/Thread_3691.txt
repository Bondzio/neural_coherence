<s> I have 2 computers, A and B. </s>
<s> Both computers are running on XP Professional SP2. </s>
<s> Computer A is installed with a HP LaserJet 1022. </s>
<s> Computer B is installed with Epson Stylus C79. </s>
<s> Both printers are using USB interface. </s>
<s> As both computers are in the same network, I shared both printers out, so that computer A can use the Epson printer, while computer B can use the HP printer. </s>
<s> After all the setup, computer A can use the Epson and HP printers. </s>
<s> Computer B can also connect to both printers. </s>
<s> But when printing using the HP, only blank page comes out. </s>
<s> And when I login using administrator account to look at the HP printer Properties, it tells me that the driver of the printer is not properly installed. </s>
<s> But I tried installing the driver from the CD and also downloaded the driver from the website to install... all didn't work. </s>
<s> So I tried connecting the HP printer directly to computer B, and install it. </s>
<s> But while installing the printer, I got error message telling me that the required section was not found in the INF. </s>
<s> I have another computer C. C can successfully connect to both printers and use them. </s>
<s> Let me tell you some history of computer B. </s>
<s> Before using LaserJet 1022, it was using LaserJet 1100. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>

<s> and HP has yet to fix it. </s>
<s> Suggest using another vendor's printer. </s>
<s> &quot;I got error message telling me that the required section was not found in the INF.&quot; This is the item to focus on. </s>
<s> Ask HP for a fix for that. </s>
