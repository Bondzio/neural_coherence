When your home desktop PC is not in use, what do you think is the best practice to ensure its longevity and why? -- Put it in sleep/hibernate mode. -- A complete shutdown. -- It depends. -- I have no idea. Please tell us the reasons why below.

I run mine all day partly because I use System Mechanic for many things and it runs in the background or when I am away from the PC...it checks the registry, drivers etc.etc. and I seldom have problems. Also I don't open a lot of different programs at once only what I need for whatever I am working on at the time. Norma V!

If you aren't going to use the computer for more than a couple of hours, I would shut it down. The time saved by using the Hibernate function is minimal, and I'm sorry Microsoft, but hibernate has always had problems. Sleep is a viable option for short durations, such as an hour or less, and/or if you need your computer to be up and running in a real hurry. But powering it down and allowing Windows to reboot when you need it, will always save you money, hardware usage, and headaches. If you are in a hurry to reboot Windows, try a Solid State Drive for your operating system and programs. Mine boots faster from scratch than it ever did coming out of sleep mode with a regular Hard Disk Drive, and with fewer glitches. That's just my experienced layman's opinion.

This think on one side have advantage for memory also have one disadvantage for system which is we have to boot it when we want to use it. On the other hand if you are not using system but for shorter time period we should hibernate because it will save the boot time of the system.

For a laptop or desktop not on a VPN, I would let it sleep. However, if my desktop or laptop are connected to my work VPN (a pain to manually reconnect to), I would just leave them on, no sleeping or hibernating. Then they'll stay connected to the VPN, although they might need to do an automatic reconnect depending on how long it's been. So there's no one answer for me, whatever makes more sense given the situation is what I'll do *smile*. But off overnight, definitely.
