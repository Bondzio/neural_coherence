hi, i have a recently new western digital portable passport harddrive (250gb) that does'nt seem to want to work, when its plugged in it gives five beeps and then is not recognised by the computer.
i contacted wd and all they could say to me is its broken send it back.
anyone have this issue before any way to fix it?
if not what kind of recovery software would you recommend to get the data from the drive?
thanks for your help, ger.
