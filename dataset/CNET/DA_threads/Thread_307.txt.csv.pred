1.1.1	I have been looking for a while for an external monitor for my laptop.	St
1.1.2	I would like it to be either 24 UXGA (1920x1200) or 20 SXGA (1680x1050) for maximum sharpness (I am not aware of any 22 UXGA).	St
1.1.3	I will use it to show charts and graphs, but would also like to use it for movies, maybe some very light gaming here and there.	St
1.1.4	Having HP laptop I naturally tried the 22 SXGA.	St
1.1.5	I liked it, even though the one I had some issues as it had uneven backlighting and the monitor was rather large and unyielding.	St
1.1.6	Also had 20 Samsung (2 of them actually) but it was pretty horrible for text display and my eyes hurt in just few minutes of watching it.	St
1.1.7	Bought 24 Princeton (UXGA).	St
1.1.8	Liked the resolution, the display was nice (some light leakage) but the monitor was rather big and heavy and had horrible buzzing sound (felt like sitting next to large transformer), so I returned it.	St
1.1.9	Also used Acer for a while, but one you put it together it is not possible to take apart without damaging the stand.	St
1.1.10	As you can see I have tried quite a few monitors, but none was a keeper and am still looking I would prefer UXGA as I can display more on it and the text / display is larger and as such, easier on my eyes (have very sensitive eyes prone to strain).	St
1.1.11	Want to stay away from TN display, as that may be a reason for my eyestrain and lack of text sharpness.	St
1.1.12	Would like HDMI port so I can watch DVD movies.	St
1.1.13	Brand is not really that important; if I can save some $$$ that much the better.	St
1.1.14	Any suggestions?	St
1.1.15	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	To professional grade monitors.	St
1.2.2	It may take some work but a name I'd like you to seek out to take a look at is BARCO.	St
1.2.3	Find this one -&gt; http://www.barco.com/corporate/en/products/product.asp?gennr=1878 This should address your issue of uneven lighting.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Wow!	St
1.3.2	What a great monitor.	Polite
1.3.3	However, 30 is a little bit too big.	St
1.3.4	At one point I was thinking about HannsG 28, but then I decided I really like to see things and am not really that interested in being blind in couple of weeks.	St
1.3.5	Second, I doubt my laptop GC (GO 7600) will be able to power the QXGA (2560x1600) resolution.	St
1.3.6	And lastly, what does this think cost (another mortgage does not look appealing at the moment) plus I doubt local BB carries it.	St
1.3.7	Otherwise, great suggestion.	Polite
1.3.8	Anybody else with something more practical and reasonably priced?	St
1.4.1	I don't expect it to hold even lighting.	St
1.4.2	CRTs could do this but that was another technology.	Sug
1.4.3	If you take a look at HOW LCDs WORK you see that you can't avoid unevenness from top to bottom.	St
1.4.4	It can be mitigated but never removed entirely.	St
1.4.5	I'd keep shopping and stop looking online.	St
1.4.6	Only by seeing the units firsthand can satisfy these criteria.	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	I have been doing that (shopping at stores).	St
1.5.2	However, what looks good at the store may not look that great once you get it home and vice versa.	St
1.5.3	That was the case with HP.	St
1.5.4	Just saw new 24 Gateway at the local BB and the picture looked amazing.	St
1.5.5	Will do some more research on that one.	St
1.6.1	I can think that your viewing angle was different and your images on screen changed.	St
1.6.2	For instance if I had no near black image at the store I might not notice the slight variation of the grey level at the store since it's an image I had at home.	St
1.6.3	There's also that viewing angle and depth issue.	St
1.6.4	If you don't duplicate this, the results change.	St
1.6.5	There was another owner that went through a dozen monitors (also got banned from 2 stores!)	St
1.6.6	because they didn't know how to install monitor and display card drivers.	St
1.6.7	They blamed the color issues on the displays.	St
1.6.8	Bob	St
1.7.1	That may be the truth that I am not as skilful in calibrating the monitor.	St
1.7.2	I usually do not install any software, I usually custom adjust the setting as almost all have been too bright for me.	St
1.7.3	My biggest problem is with clear, easily readable text.	St
1.7.4	The 20 Samsung was just horrible, with red / green shadow plus the back lightning was so uneven I could see two oval blotches in almost any setting.	St
1.7.5	With the HP, the problem was that in the store, with bright lightning I could not see any deficiencies.	St
1.7.6	At home, my room is darker (that's why any default setting is too bright for me) and I liked how the text / charts looked.	St
1.7.7	But once I played DVD on it (I use Pitch Black for testing), the bottom had so much light leakage it was washing out the bottom of the movie scenes.	St
1.7.8	I doubt that could be adjusted.	St
1.7.9	So I returned it plus the stand, as great is it is, is rather large and bulky.	St
1.7.10	Do not need to adjust the monitor daily; once I find the good position, thats pretty much it.	St
1.7.11	With the Princeton, I liked the display, though the monitor itself was bulky and heavy, but the buzzing sound was so great that initially I thought something was going on outside before realizing it was the monitor.	St
1.7.12	I wanted to test another one in the store to see if mine was just an exception or if all do it, but the store would not do it.	St
1.7.13	Most of my problems are due to my eyes and that would be too long to write to explain.	St
1.7.14	But they are very sensitive and any distortion causes me great strain.	St
1.7.15	Do you know of any calibration software that you would recommend to do this?	St
1.8.1	There's an issue.	St
1.8.2	These LCDs run best at NATIVE RESOLUTIONS and most if not all PCs won't display such until we install the monitor driver (yes, it's not a real driver but that MONITOR.INF file.)	St
1.8.3	Sometimes our video card can't do this until we update that driver as well.	St
1.8.4	I have yet to install calibration software unless the owner is a &quot;photographic editor&quot;.	St
1.8.5	Then we head straight to the PANTONE SPYDER.	St
1.8.6	It's a few hundred bucks so you average user doesn't do that.	St
1.8.7	&quot;distortion&quot;!!!	St
1.8.8	How could an LCD show a distorted image?	St
1.8.9	Unlike CRTs the pixels are fixed in a plane.	St
1.8.10	You would be the first (for me) to complain that the lines or such are not straight.	St
1.8.11	Bob	St
1.9.1	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_resolution	St
1.10.1	If I insulted you by writing about monitor and video card drivers I am sorry that it hurt.	St
1.10.2	I have elected to rarely rewrite replies to avoid hurt egos since this is all volunteer work and the GOAL is to get the items that matter up and on the table.	St
1.10.3	If you need handling with kid gloves just say so.	St
1.10.4	Bob	St
