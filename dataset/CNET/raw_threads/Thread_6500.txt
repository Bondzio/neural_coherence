The drive is not recognizing the Verbatim CD-RW whether it is a new blank or one that contains data. The device manager indicates that &quot;This device is working properly.&quot; The cd drives reads the data on the Verbatim Disc. I have down loaded new updates, however the problem persists. Jim

Swap the CDRW drive that is not working with a new drive and see if that cures it. This is a 20 buck item so it's not a big expense. Bob

The only problem was designating the new drive as cs with the blue pin. There was no instructions included with the new drive. However, I managed to work it out.
