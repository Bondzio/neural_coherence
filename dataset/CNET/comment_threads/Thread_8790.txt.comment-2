A mobile CPU will help get the heat down.
But for the rest, we need specifics.
What kind of temperature extremes are we talking about?
How will the case be designed, will there be ventilation?
What are you using it for and where will you be mounting it?
For the most part, normal PC hardware will work, unless the extremes are pretty extreme.
Just not enough info here to go on.
