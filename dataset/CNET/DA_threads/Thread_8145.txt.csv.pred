1.1.1	HI , I am looking to be pointed in the right direction for a great bang for the buck motherboard for gamers .	St
1.1.2	I do n't have a ton of money to spend on it , around $ 200.00 neighborhood .	St
1.1.3	My main concern is that the board be future ready and reliable .	St
1.1.4	Also , whether I should go PCI express or stick with AGP .	St
1.1.5	The card I have in my current PC is a Radeon 9800 pro 128mb .	St
1.1.6	What I 'm wondering is should I get an AGP board and cannibalize the old computer , thus saving money or bide my time and get the PCI express .	St
1.1.7	So confused , lol .	St
1.1.8	Any help would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Is this a replacement motherboard for an existing system , or are you building from scratch ?	Ques
1.2.2	If an upgrade , what CPU ( and socket type ) , memory amount and type , video card model , etc .	St
1.2.3	do you already have .	St
1.2.4	The $ 200 is for just a motherboard , or for a motherboard and new PCI-Express X16 video card ?	Ques
1.3.1	Gon na be building from scratch .	St
1.3.2	Have an Antec case SLK3700 BQE , for ATX or BTX , with 350w power supply .	St
1.3.3	Only parts I will be taking from my old system are a Radeon 9800 Pro 128mb , DVD Rom 16x drive , CD R/RW drive , and WD 80gb - 7200rpm HD .	St
1.3.4	Depending on whether I decide to get an AGP board , or PCI express board will make or break the Radeon .	St
1.3.5	The $ 200 is for the motherboard only .	St
1.3.6	My main sticking point is AGP or PCI express ... do I go for AGP and what are my chances of being obsolete in the near future , or PCI express and build the system slowly , as I can only afford to build it a piece at a time ?	Ques
1.3.7	Also will be installing new memory , not moving the old cards over .	St
1.4.1	Your biggest costs will be the new video card and a new processor ... unless you 're using the old one .	St
1.4.2	$ 200 wo n't hack it .	St
1.4.3	You 'll spend at least that on the CPU .	St
1.4.4	$ 130 for the motherboard ; $ 75 - $ 100 for memory .	St
1.4.5	A 350w PSU may work initially but you 'll need to upgrade to at least 400w..with 450w preferred .	St
1.4.6	Oh yeh ... if you computer came with Windows loaded you 'll have to buy a new OS .	St
1.4.7	OEM supplied OSes wo n't activiate on the new motherboard .	St
1.4.8	and life goes on ... Jack	St
