DirectX 10 is currently slated to work only with Vista.
You will need to upgrade your system significantly to take advantage of this.
At the present time; Most new games only use DirectX 9.
The DirectX 9 version can be downloaded form Microsoft, or installed as part of the bundled package from a game you would purchase.
My only advice would be to consider if you will use your computer for games in the future?
If the answer is yes, then you will need Vista (As Of Today), and a video card which is compliant with the new DirectX 10 standard.
I would honestly wait for about two months to see how the new CPU and GPU wars &quot;Pan&quot; out.
AMD and INTEL are in a serious battle at the moment, and you would do well to wait until the smoke clears.
