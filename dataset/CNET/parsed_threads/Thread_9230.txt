<s> I have an MSI Wind netbook, with (I thought) 160GB HDD, but when I clicked on My computer properties, it says C: 39GB D: 106GB. </s>
<s> A message came up saying I had minimum space (or something like that) on the C: Drive. </s>
<s> I have 88GB free on D Drive. </s>
<s> C: has programmes on it, D: also has some programmes, and all my data. </s>
<s> I have XP Home SP3. </s>
<s> The hard drive was already divided when I got the computer, and didn't realise everything was going on to the C Drive, until a friend advised me to put the data on D: Can I increase the size of C: with an SD card, (there is a slot on the computer) ? </s>
<s> If so, when I put the card in howcan I link it to the C Drive. </s>
<s> Also when I look at the computer properties it lists &quot;Memory Card on EP4695a4&quot; (Z:) but I don't know what this means, or where it is. </s>
<s> The only connections I have on the netbook, are the Ethernet wire slot, monitor connection, headphones and microphone connections, 3 USB ports, SD Card slot. </s>
<s> Can anyone enlighten me please? </s>
<s> If we eat too much, we need larger clothing. </s>
<s> If we buy larger clothing, we need bigger closets. </s>
<s> If we fill thee closets, we either get rid of something or find other storage space. </s>
<s> You can invest in a larger hard drive up to the capacity that your hard drive and budget can handle and you can clone the old drive to the new. </s>
<s> You can buy an external drive but that takes away some portability convenience. </s>
<s> You may be able to merge the two drive partitions but that has its downsides as well. </s>
<s> I'd start with the larger drive option and you can keep the original for either overflow storage or in case of disaster. </s>
<s> Ultimately, you get to work out the plan of your choice that fits your needs and finances. </s>
