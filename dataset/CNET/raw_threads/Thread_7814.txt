She is using Apple's Mail app. Whenever she tries to attach a file - a JPEG for instance - it seems to attach as an inline graphic rather than a normal attachment. The PC recipient gets no paperclip symbol on their end, and can't do anything with it. I'm assuming this may be a preference setting in Mail, but can't seem to find where to change it. Turning on the &quot;Send Windows-friendly attachments&quot; seems to make no difference. Specs: G5 PowerPC Mac OSX Tiger - 10.4.11 Thanks in advance for any insight into this problem.

Just Right Click on the image and choose the option to save the image. The &quot;Windows Friendly Attachment&quot; thing in Mail is not for this, it just makes sure that the attachments have the required extension attached to it when it is sent. (like .doc, .jpg, etc.) You could also take a look at how the Mac user is attaching the attachments. Mail will tend to put the attachment at the current cursor position which could be at the bottom of the email by the time the user decides to make the attachment. See if attaching first, before composing the text, makes any difference. P

Her composing preferences were set for .rtf, rather than plain-text. Once we changed it to plain text, it worked. So now she has a boring signature, but her attachments will work. I wonder if this is something that was fixed in Leopard or Snow Leopard's version of Mail. We can upgrade her as far as Leopard (but not any farther since it isn't an Intel Mac).

When I right click on the jpeg on the receiving PC's email app, it only gives the option of &quot;copy.&quot; It doesn't regard the jpeg as an attachment. I can get an attachment recognized if I pull a photo from my Aperture app on my iMac and then send it as an attachment from the desktop. But that's a pain. Any other ideas?
