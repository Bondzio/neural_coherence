I decided it's time to get a new PC and thought it would be a good idea to build one rather than buy one pre-built to save money. I looked on newegg.com and found some parts and I'm not sure if they're compatible or not, and none of my friends know. I was hoping someone would be able to tell me if they are and point me to compatible ones if they're not. And would I need a better power supply with this case? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811162059&amp;Tpk=1243MA The parts I need confirmed: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131765 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103943 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231455 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102918 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833166038 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16829271001 I'm new to building computer and I constantly get confused with all the odd product titles (RNX-N300, Llano 2.6GHz Socket FM1 100W, F1A75-V PRO FM1 AMD A75, etc.).

Also, the sound card is large, so watch your case size. A mini tower might be too small. Everything else looks good. -th3m4nII

PS/...what's the proposed use for the system ? VAPCMD
