Everything seemed good but, when I plug a thumb drive into either usb port on the front, they don't work and , worse, they disable the mouse and keyboard so I have to do a hard shutdown. Rebooting re-enables the mouse and keyboard until I try the front ports again. What have I done wrong?

What I suspect is that either your mis-routed the USB harness or it became unseated/misaligned. Inspect and verify your past work and don't take anything for granted. If in fact you did mis-route the harness, the damage may already be done and that USB hub is hosed. That's a physical damage item, though not seen, it's damaged. If you want to return USB access, install PCI card of USB with an int. mounting for USB access for the frt.. I exclude any s/w issues, but again I find it hard to believe that the frt. USB ports got whacked and not any other USB ports. The reason the frt. ports cause remaining USB issues, it that the USB calls for service become bogged down and aren't released fast enough, IMO. Again related to possible hosed USB hub. Follow the frt. USB harness and reset the harness fully, several times. If the problem persists then damaged hub. tada -----Willy

I opened the case, followed all wires from the front USB ports and made sure all connections were firmly seated. It didn't feel like anything moved but, I am pleased to say, the front ports now work. Thank you again for your replies. Joan
