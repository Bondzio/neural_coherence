Ok, thanks Willy!
So for now you'd recommend just going with a regular VGA connection and maybe considering a laptop with a DVI/HDMI output for the future?
Is there anything I need to know about VGA cables?
What's the deal with the cable that claims that it's only for 17 inch and smaller displays?
Will it look distorted/pixelated on my 46&quot; and if so, what do I need to look for in a VGA cable?
