<s> But it seems the lesson about calling the supplier to get a bum board exchanged may be in the future. </s>
<s> XP &quot;glides&quot; onto good hardware. </s>
<s> I read the discussion and see a bum system. </s>
<s> But few want to hear that. </s>
<s> Other lessons: a. </s>
<s> A new board, router, etc will not have the latest BIOS or firmware. </s>
<s> b. XP does glide onto good hardware. </s>
<s> c. Building your own PC the first time can be traumatic for some. </s>
<s> d. And the first time out, you rarely save a buck. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> so what your saying is I'm screwed, pretty much. </s>
<s> I don't understand how it would be a bum system. </s>
<s> You have new stuff with a warranty. </s>
<s> Use the warranty. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> hard drive???? </s>
<s> To me the symptoms make it seem that the drive has problems. </s>
<s> I don't understand the comment about the 9 jumper positions. </s>
<s> I figured the signs were pointing at a bad hard drive, but I exchanged the hard drive and the new one did the same thing. </s>
<s> The hard drive was the only thing I bought at a retail store and not online. </s>
<s> Why would you buy all this and not have any warranty? </s>
<s> Somewhere in the brew is a bum or horribly misconfigured part, but I don't see it yet. </s>
<s> The motherboard is my suspect from what I read. </s>
<s> It's all new so you should be able to call the board supplier and ask for configuration help. </s>
<s> If not, find some local guru to look it over, but your posts and discussions have yet to reveal what's dead. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well the parts I bought online have warranty's with them. </s>
<s> They all pretty much have the manufacturer's warranty. </s>
<s> I am wondering why you think the motherboard is the problem? </s>
<s> Thanks for you input so far though. </s>
<s> Most vendors do not want your RMA. </s>
<s> And will talk you through the usual issues. </s>
<s> If you didn't call it in, you may have ignored a good resource. </s>
<s> part of the Mobo's chipset. </s>
<s> Did you try different cables??? </s>
<s> Flat versus round. </s>
<s> What make are the two hard drives that you tried? </s>
<s> Jumpering correct? </s>
<s> The BIOS updates. </s>
<s> Some are under the impression a new board would have the latest BIOS. </s>
<s> Guess what? </s>
<s> I just exchanged my hard drive for a different same thing. </s>
<s> Hitachi Deskstar 250 GB 7200rpm. </s>
<s> I've tried the cable that came with the hard drive and a round one that came with the mobo. </s>
<s> Jumpering has been on Master and cable select. </s>
<s> If I downloaded an updated BIOS on this computer how would I get the other one to recognize it with no OS? </s>
<s> I put it on a DOS diskette and follow the makers instructions. </s>
<s> But your question does reveal that you didn't follow their instructions or research it. </s>
<s> This is not a good sign. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Based on my limited experience Win XP installs gracefully on new hardware, as Robert said. </s>
<s> I actually installed it on a SATA drive which was the only one in the system. </s>
<s> Had to do the F6 bit but it worked perfectly. </s>
<s> &quot; I'm using Windows XP &quot; Here's a bonus. </s>
<s> They are trying to install on an over 127GB drive with Windows XP. </s>
<s> This usually fails horribly since Windows XP doesn't support such a drive. </s>
<s> The common gaffe is the owner tries to format or partition the drive with the software that came with the drive. </s>
<s> How would they know this is the setup for failure? </s>
<s> Then they boot the XP CD and descend into the depths of despair. </s>
<s> -&gt; I rarely see this issue since: a. I know the issue. </s>
<s> b. I never use drive prep software or (gasp) Partition Magic. </s>
<s> c. I created a XP SP2 CD a long time ago to stay out of this quagmire. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Just in case: Note the manual says that it supports only one IDE Channel. </s>
<s> It supports 8-channel Azalia Audio Codec and provides one IDE Ultra DMA 100/66 channel. </s>
<s> It coporates one IDE RAID controller supporting two IDE Ultra DMA 133/100/66 channel for RAID 0, 1, 0+1 function. </s>
<s> It has one AGPro slot, one PCI Express x16 slot, two PCI Express x1 slots and three 32-bit PCI slots. </s>
<s> There is a full set of I/O ports including two PS/2 ports for mouse and keyboard, one serial port, one parallel port, one LAN port (optional), six audio jacks for micropone, line-in and 8- ch line-out, four back-panel USB 2.0 ports and onboard USB headers USB3/USB4 providing four extra ports by connecting the extended USB module to the motherboard. </s>
<s> early in the other thread. </s>
<s> The second and third IDE ports were RAID ports from a SIS chip. </s>
<s> He went into the BIOS and set the RAID to IDE/ATAPI and put his Optical drives on that or those ports. </s>
<s> That thread was &quot;don't detect IDE drives&quot; by same user name. </s>
<s> He had the Hard drive on the middle connector of the normal IDE port, but set as Master. </s>
<s> It should have worked. </s>
<s> He changed it to CS and moved it to the end connector. </s>
<s> Has since got a replacement Hitachi, and tried both round and ribbon cables. </s>
<s> Hey, a female named Worley posted in one of these forums the other day. </s>
<s> Any relation? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I didn't think the size of the hard drive was the problem. </s>
<s> You said before SP1 started to use larger hard drives. </s>
<s> I am using SP2. </s>
<s> I also have a friend that has the same size hard drive with Windows XP and has no problem at all. </s>
<s> Please put such details in your posts. </s>
<s> I read all your posts and didn't see that you had SP2. </s>
<s> Windows XP with no SP at all can be installed on such a drive BUT many trip up and fall hard by preparing the drive with some utility. </s>
<s> I know to go &quot;native.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Hi Ray. </s>
<s> Let me first say that I haven't read this thread throughly. </s>
<s> Someone may have mentioned this. </s>
<s> Has anyone thought to check in Device Manager to see if the channel is enabled there? </s>
<s> thus no device manager. </s>
<s> Has no floppy, so boot floppy not available. </s>
<s> More info in his original thread before I created this one with a link to his original to see what Robert could add. </s>
<s> That really meant Robert or anyone else. </s>
<s> So feel free to jump in. </s>
<s> Kinda nice to see Norm Worley around also. </s>
<s> I'm from the old ZDNET forums and remember him well for his expertise. </s>
<s> I'm still trying to find out what the boot screen says about the drive in the other thread. </s>
<s> Probably not important because the install of XP with SP2 starts when he boots from the CD but then gets him the failure notice. </s>
<s> Got any other good ideas it'll be appreciated. </s>
<s> Hadn't noticed your name around lately. </s>
<s> A lower tax rate for me or anyone else in Taxachusetts! </s>
<s> On the other hand, I think that where Bob lives in the community of The Peoples Republic of Cambridge, tax rates are still going up! </s>
<s> Maybe Bob can write a new program for the Governor and the Dept. </s>
<s> of Revenue. </s>
<s> HA! </s>
<s> :)) Sorry, Bob. </s>
<s> Kevin, a fellow Taxachusetts citizen. </s>
<s> ON SUBJECT: Bob Proffitt has helped thousands of people for the last few years. </s>
<s> I really think that Bob is a great moderator. </s>
<s> Please see my post very recently to the CNET Feedback Forum: What is the Moderator worth in $$ to the members? </s>
<s> Also posted on the Newbees Forum, because many newbees do not post to the Forum Feedback or know about it. </s>
<s> Would you, if you were a brand new person to a Newbees Forum? </s>
<s> By the way, when was the last time that a lot of the forum members looked at the Newbees Forum? </s>
<s> Lots to learn there and to share your thoughts. </s>
<s> Bob Proffitt is on that Forum also! </s>
<s> Who knew? </s>
<s> Kevin Smith </s>
<s> I've kept an eye on it and the one thing I did point out was merely an omission on their part (XP and over 127GB support.) </s>
<s> A recap is needed. </s>
<s> I don't see the BIOS version noted, so that goes in the recap as well. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I went back and read both your threads. </s>
<s> I got the impression that the use of Recovery Console was not thoroughly addressed. </s>
<s> Based on my limited experience, it seems that the option should be available from the cd. </s>
<s> After the driver files are loaded you should get a screen with several options. </s>
<s> This is where you press enter to install Windows. </s>
<s> One of the other options is to press &quot;R&quot; to enter the Recovery Console. </s>
<s> From there you can run Chkdsk /F. </s>
<s> Best of Luck </s>
<s> It doesn't get far enough for me to install anything. </s>
<s> Alright First I cam here because I had a problem detecting all IDE drives. </s>
<s> Ray quickly ran me through that and that is no longer a problem. </s>
<s> I am trying to install Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 2. </s>
<s> I've also tried the boot disc for Windows XP Home that I have with this computer. </s>
<s> My problem is when Windows starts to load and then says Setup is now Starting Windows. </s>
<s> Then a screen appears revealing Windows can not continue installation. </s>
<s> Please check hard drive for any viruses. </s>
<s> Remove newly installed hard drive or hard drive controller and make sure it is configured and terminated correctly. </s>
<s> Run CHKDSK/F and check for corruption. </s>
<s> The hard drive is a brand new Hitachi Deskstar 250 GB 7200 RPm hard drive. </s>
<s> Can't have any viruses. </s>
<s> I can't turn off Virus protection in my BIOS because there isn't any. </s>
<s> I didn't download a BIOS upgrade because PC CHIPS website said only to download if my problem was described and mine wasn't. </s>
<s> I have had the hard drive jumpers on Master and Cable Select only to receive the same error screen. </s>
<s> I didn't call the mobo manufacturer because there is no phone number. </s>
<s> The only customer service they offer is e-mail which they haven't gotten back to me with. </s>
<s> When I start my computer it says IT8212 Atapi BIOS V1.7.1.51. </s>
<s> so I believe that is my BIOS version. </s>
<s> boot screen says about your hard drive. </s>
<s> Also, it seems that you may be using a proprietary system and simply putting a new hard drive in. </s>
<s> Lots of room for problems then. </s>
<s> Exactly what is this &quot;Boot Disk&quot; for XP home?????? </s>
<s> If that is from a proprietary system and is actually a recovery CD, you may have tried to put all the drivers on from the original system and got things confused. </s>
<s> Why not buy a floppy and just let it hang out of the system to try using a Win 98 boot floppy and run FDISk /STATUS to see just what is happening to the hard drive. </s>
<s> [or pull the floppy out of the other system and connect ot temporaily.] </s>
<s> Even that screen that says ATAPI doesn't make a lot of sense. </s>
<s> The Hard drive is not an ATAPI drive, the optical drives are. </s>
<s> I'm going up to the website to read about the BIOS. </s>
<s> What Op Sys is on your other computer. </s>
<s> If it is Win 98, just download/install the latest FDISK, make a boot disk and then overwrite the FDISK on the boot floppy with the newer FDISK. </s>
<s> Believe it or not MS doesn't do that for you. </s>
<s> You can also use the new FDISK to overwrite the one in the file that creates ther boot disk [forget its name but it is obvious] then when you make a boot disk the new FDISK will be used. </s>
<s> Just want to use FDISK /STATUS at the moment to see what it says about your drive. </s>
<s> Don't use it to format unless we discuss that the format command when used with the new FDISK gives bad readings [although it does fully format the drive]. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=%22Windows+can+not+continue+installation.+Please+check+hard+drive+for+any+viruses.%22 gets ZERO hits so there's a typo in there. </s>
<s> In closing, there's some bum hardware in the brew. </s>
<s> Swap it out piece by piece till you find it. </s>
<s> Remember to never add anything you can do without. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I can't pause it in time to get the boot screen. </s>
<s> It only says the part about the hard drive for a split second so I'm either to early or to late. </s>
<s> This computer is running XP Home. </s>
<s> I don't have win98 disk. </s>
<s> I do have a floppy drive. </s>
<s> That misunderstanding may have been my fault but there is one one there. </s>
<s> I don't think trying the other disk would have been the problem since I tried it after I was already getting error messeges. </s>
<s> that is having the problem??? </s>
<s> Here's a link to a place to get boot disks for anything. </s>
<s> Definitely get one for Win 98 and make a floppy from it. </s>
<s> You might want to try another. </s>
<s> http://www.pcwarfare.com/hdds/bootdisks.htm </s>
<s> a Win 98 boot floppy to get an idea of what may be on the drive. </s>
<s> I think that misunderstood what XP CD that you had. </s>
<s> I now wonder if the first thing that you used was a valid XP CD rather than recovery or restore CD from a proprietary system. </s>
<s> Not meaning that you should ignore Robert at all, HOWEVER, if I knew that you had a floppy drive in the problem system I would ask you to download DELPART [from the same site], just on a different page, and run that to clean the drive and start over with an XP CD that we understand a little about. </s>
<s> It sure seems that Robert's logic is valid. </s>
<s> Just think that some previous info was incorrect and steered us in the wrong direction. </s>
<s> It does quite the number on wiping a drive clean so be sure of what system you run it on. </s>
<s> At the moment I'm mostly watching for a clue to pop up so I can make usefull additions. </s>
<s> The one item I thought I say was dashed when you added you had XP SP2. </s>
<s> -&gt; Ray is right. </s>
<s> What XP SP2 you have could have a bearing on this. </s>
<s> And to repeat myself, do not use any disk prep software. </s>
<s> I don't. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> in case she doesn't have it. </s>
<s> When I get a boot disc in my computer I get a Disk I/O error. </s>
<s> Replace Disc and press any key. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what that means? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> One was a Windows 98 Startup disc. </s>
<s> And one was Windows ME. </s>
<s> The ME I got off of bootdisks.com and the 98 I got off making a startup disk from a computer's control panel. </s>
<s> Since it's one of those, error messages are not uncommon. </s>
<s> Those boot disks are from a time where installers knew what to overlook and what to pay attention to. </s>
<s> For example, a generic boot diskette will have SCSI card drivers and will spew errors that new to DOS people will be posting and calling for support. </s>
<s> So far, I don't have a message to write about. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The NT post by me was a goof. </s>
<s> Are you talking about a win 98 boot floppy??? </s>
<s> Do you have the BIOS set to boot from a floppy??? </s>
<s> If you do you should be able to get to an A prompt. </s>
<s> Then you can type FDISK /STATUS and hit enter and see what that reports about the hard drive. </s>
<s> It may show an uknown partiton which may be an NTFS partiton. </s>
<s> [DOS cannot read NTFS. </s>
<s> That is why it was suggested that you download either DELPART or KILLDISK, create a floppy from the download and run it to remove all and any type of partiton from the hard drive. </s>
<s> When it is clean, and if you have a certified Win XP CVD with SP2 on it, one with the MS hologram et al [not a recovery CD from somewhare], then try to install XP again. </s>
<s> The issue for some time has been to find out what is on the hard drive. </s>
<s> you are trying to tell us. </s>
<s> We are trying to find out what is on his hard drive. </s>
<s> These error messages on boot diskettes have many asking why. </s>
<s> Sorry, but this LEGACY stuff and new to the ways of Microsoft will not like such messages. </s>
<s> Next they are asking why things work this way. </s>
<s> As to the hard disk, I'd wipe it with the hard disk makers tool or KILLDISK and move forware, but I see it was never revealed what XP CD that was. </s>
<s> It's not fun to watch others suffer so much. </s>
<s> It almost makes me think some pirate copy of the OS is in use. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'n not implying intentional illegal, simply not understanding that aspect by the user. </s>
<s> The floppy drive is in the BIOS as a source for a boot disk. </s>
<s> I don't get any prompt due to the error stoping any reading of the disk. </s>
<s> I'm also wondering why a cd that came with a different computer wouldn't work? </s>
<s> to the error stoping any reading of the disk This is a long discussion, and it's quite possible that the exact error is in one of the posts above. </s>
<s> Otherwise it might make sense to repeat it for the ease of following the discussion. </s>
<s> As it stands now, an error reading a boot diskette can be caused by either a bad diskette (test it on another computer) or a bad drive (replace it). </s>
<s> It seems you need a working combination of diskette and drive before being able to continue. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> is likely a restore CD and as such it contains a lot of proprietary crap, a modified operating system and has drivers and data regarding a specific set of hardware. </s>
<s> The system that you are trying to install it in has none of that hardware in it. </s>
<s> That is your problem. </s>
<s> Kees is correct about the floppy issue. </s>
<s> That is such a basic item, if your system can't perform such a simple function, then there has to be hardware problems. </s>
<s> You must be able to see what is on your hard drive and clear it. </s>
<s> When you get the bootdisk and floppy drive and good floppy disks working, such that you can get to the A prompt. </s>
<s> [make the A drive [floppy] the first boot device, so that when you get an error message it is about the floppy and not some other drive that the system may be looking at first]. </s>
<s> Then download DELPART [or killdisk, that Robert posted]. </s>
<s> If there is room on your bootfloppy you can simply add DELPART to it and run it when you get to the A prompt, by simply typing delpart and hit enter. </s>
<s> If you have delpart on a separate floppy, when the boot disk gets you to the A prompt simply remove the boot floppy and insert the floppy containing delpart and run by typing delpart and hitting enter. </s>
<s> If you are downloading a boot floppy file from the bootdisk site [don't get anything related to Win ME, that Op Sys doesn't deserve being called an OP Sys, LOL] The file that you download is NOT what you put on the floppy. </s>
<s> You click on that file to execute it and it will tell you to put a blank floppy in your drive and then it will proceed to create the boot floppy. </s>
<s> Takes a few minutes, and for its use it makes the CD drive the R drive. </s>
<s> All this is a waste of time if you insist on using an invalid CD. </s>
<s> First it is illegal, second if you get it installed it will expire in 30 days because you won't be able to activate it. </s>
<s> You can buy an OEM XP PRO CD with SP2 from newegg for about $140. </s>
<s> It comes fully sealed with the Microsoft Certificate of authenticity, the hologram etc. </s>
<s> Totally legal and is the full Operating system with no other crap on it. </s>
<s> If you don't go legal, you probably won't be getting any more help in these forums. </s>
<s> It violates CNET policy to help with illegal activities. </s>
<s> It's why I haven't commented too much on this one. </s>
<s> Someone was not forthcoming with basic information and when I see that I wait till it plays out. </s>
<s> POINT BLANK -&gt; XP glides onto good hardware. </s>
<s> Oops, I have to take that back. </s>
<s> I finally ran into an instance it didn't. </s>
<s> The hard disk had to be wiped with the hard disk makers tool before XP would install. </s>
<s> I tried my usual Recovery Console skills with DISKPART and such, but there was something very odd on the drive that XP could not deal with. </s>
<s> The zerofill cleaned it off and then XP slid right onto the machine. </s>
<s> I'm sure killdisk would have worked but I had the hard disk maker's CD handy and it had the zerofill I needed. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Not sure how much this will help. </s>
<s> Have you tried upgrading the BIOS to v1.7.1.56? </s>
<s> Note: I HAVEN'T! </s>
<s> So I'm not sure of the effects. </s>
<s> Link is here: http://www.iteusa.com/software_download/software_download2.asp#IT8212%20ATA133%20Controller My story is that I bought an IDE controller card, non-RAID, to be able to use a 200GB drive on my ageing system that had a BIOS limitation for disks at 128GB (or 137 if you like). </s>
<s> I couldn't get any hard disk, large or small, to boot off this card in any configuration. </s>
<s> Once in an OS booted from the mobo controller, I could install drivers to make the 200GB drive ''visible'' in the OS but nothing I did could get a drive to boot from the card. </s>
<s> Sounds like your BIOS is right on the mobo rather than an add-on card. </s>
<s> You should still be able to update to the later version. </s>
<s> Take note of the original BIOS backup procedure and how to put that back on, in case things end up worse. </s>
<s> I'd like to know the results if you do it. </s>
<s> I won't get a chance for a couple days... </s>
<s> I got a refund for the card this morning and only searched for updated BIOS this arvo so I need a good smack in the head for doing things in reverse. </s>
<s> Still, I plan to buy the card again and try the upgaded BIOS. </s>
<s> For reference, the BIOS history for this chip from the above site has: 1.7.1.55 1. </s>
<s> Bug fixed: returned wrong DPTE segment at offset 26. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Modify BCV Entries and EnableIRQ routine 3. </s>
<s> Show bootable CDROM drive NO. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Fix some device not found 1.7.1.56 1. </s>
<s> Bug fixed: force to mapping segment to 3000 but not set ds Hope this helps. </s>
<s> If anyone is still having issues with this problem on the T18 board here is what you do. </s>
<s> Put the bundles CD in another computer and choose to browse the CD. </s>
<s> Goto the RAID folder then the ITE8212 folder. </s>
<s> Copy everything that is in that folder to a floppy disk, then when installing Windows XP press F6 in the beggining to install seperate RAID files and follow those instructions and it will work!! </s>
<s> Peace out! </s>
