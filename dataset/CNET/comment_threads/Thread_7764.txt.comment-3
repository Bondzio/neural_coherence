Since you lack details on your system, the advice will be generic.
Many systems on startup will kick-in the fan to a high speed then settle down.
If you had a system for awhile, it cooling fins or fan maybe lacking a good cleaning, do it ASAP.
If this is a laptop, the same applies.
Use a can of compressed air or direct brush cleaning for best results.
if the problem persists after a cleaning, then replace fan as likely cause of noise.
Those systems build as extreme of OC'ed will need better cooling if only &quot;stock cooled&quot; to better cool the heat build-up.
If cleaning all areas should be addressed.
