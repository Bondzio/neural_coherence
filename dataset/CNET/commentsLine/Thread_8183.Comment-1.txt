accompanying screenshot:  after my driver woes, i discovered that the msi app that controls my gpu(s) doesn't work anymore.
it displays clearly false information (check the amount of ram it claims i have ) and i cannot tick the pciex16 box, or any others for that matter.
they aren't greyed out, but clicking them won't tick the box nor make any other changes.
i no longer have this program, i searched msi's site but cannot find it on there either.
i have no idea how to tell if my pciex16 is actually being used or that my slowdowns are originating from exactly that problem.
