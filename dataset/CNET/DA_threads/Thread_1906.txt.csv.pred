1.2.1	It 's contents should be viewable by XP or higher .	St
1.2.2	If not , it would sound like a HD failure is likely .	St
1.3.1	I could put the drive in another computer .	St
1.3.2	That could test the drive , but I really think there is an issue either with the BIOS or the mobo .	St
1.3.3	It just makes no sense .	St
1.3.4	The machine was set to reboot and just never rebooted properly .	St
