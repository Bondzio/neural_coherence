<s> I have 2 Western Digital Raptors, SATA, that I've been running in RAID0 (1 as the boot drive, C:, and the other as a data drive, D:). </s>
<s> Recently, my motherboard died and I need to get the required data off the drives. </s>
<s> My wife's computer is my old PC, which is a P4S8X and has a FastTrack RAID controller. </s>
<s> My question is, how do I attach one of my SATA drives to her already-running computer and have it be visible in Windows so I can copy/paste files I need? </s>
<s> I do not want to format the drive. </s>
<s> I added the drive to the computer, and it was detected by the FastTrack controller and it wants me to setup an array for the drive. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> If I setup an array for the drive, will it be visible in BIOS & Windows, or do I need to do more? </s>
<s> Will this erase the data? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> BTW...did you install the drivers FastTrack RAID Controller ? </s>
<s> Believe you should do that first ...then connect the drives ... believe you'll need to connect both drives to make up the RAID and retrieve your data. </s>
<s> You said you are running in RAID 0. </s>
<s> This means the two drives are joined as one continuous drive and would only have one drive letter. </s>
<s> As such, they cannot operate independently. </s>
<s> Is it possible you meant they were on RAID capable channels on the MB but configured as basic SATA? </s>
<s> In this case, you normally can just connect them to an SATA channel of another PC and see if it's recognized and readable. </s>
<s> Don't try to boot from a bootable partition, however if your OS is XP. </s>
<s> It won't work. </s>
