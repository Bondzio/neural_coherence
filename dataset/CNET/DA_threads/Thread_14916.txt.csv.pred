1.1.1	I hope I 'm posting this in the correct forum .	St
1.1.2	First of all , here is my desktop info : - DESKTOP PC : - Pent .	St
1.1.3	4 w/HyperThreading , 3.00GHz , 1.50GB RAM , Buffalo 80GB Internal HDD , Internal AOPEN DUW1608/ARR Dual-Layer DVD/CD RW drive .	St
1.1.4	Nvidia GeForce FX 5200 V-Card .	St
1.1.5	DSL Extreme connected - Ok..this PC 's about 4 years old .	St
1.1.6	I try to back-up pretty often , ( though not as much as I should .	St
1.1.7	lol ) Here 's my issue : I had been making some personal archives of quite a few of my collections of CDs/DVDs .	St
1.1.8	( The following may or may Not be a cause , but I 'm listing it anyway ... ) In one of my CDs , it allows an install of & quot ; Umixit & quot ; software to & quot ; mix & quot ; your own music ... so I did , but had to change my desktop 's Video resolution for Optimal performance .	St
1.1.9	( it Was at 800x600 , but I changed it to 1024x168 ) ( After intall , I changed it back 'cause my 19 & quot ; CRT had really small desktop icons with the newer setting . )	St
1.1.10	Now , in one of the DVDs , I installed ( reluctantly ) InterActual Player 2.0 , JUST to see if it made a difference in my already installed PowerDVD ( I use THIS one the most . )	St
1.1.11	and Win Media 10 .	St
1.1.12	- As my PC was Finalizing a DVD last night , SUDDENLY , the HDD starts making Noisy & quot ; Click-a-Click & quot ; sounds .	St
1.1.13	Then I got the Worst ... a B.S.O.D .	St
1.1.14	that read : - A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer .	St
1.1.15	KERNEL_STACK_INPAGE_ERROR If this is the first time you 've seen this stop error screen , restart your computer .	St
1.1.16	If this screen appears again , follow these steps : Check to make sure any new hardware or sofware is properly installed .	St
1.1.17	If this is a new installation , ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any windows updates you might need .	St
1.1.18	If problems continue , disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software .	St
1.1.19	Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing .	St
1.1.20	If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components , restart your computer , press F8 to select Advanced Startup options and then select Safe mode .	Ques
1.1.21	- Technical information : *** STOP : 0x00000077 ( 0xc000000E,0xc000000E,0x00000000,0x00BB6000 ) - Other than a couple PC games , I have n't installed anything else .	St
1.1.22	Now , I have to & quot ; Hard Shut-down & quot ; the PC with the Tower button cause when it even tries to Boot-up , it Hangs before the P.O.S.T and the HDD goes Nuts again .	St
1.1.23	It just recently froze at the & quot ; Safe Mode/Last Known../Normal startup & quot ; options black screen .	St
1.1.24	The HDD just & quot ; Click-a-Clicks & quot ; away .	St
1.1.25	- I had JUST bought a Seagate 400 GB w/ 16MB buffer to install in the tower with this one ... .Just-in-Case , but I 'll bet that my current HDD is gone .	St
1.1.26	Go ahead , tell me the truth .	Sug
1.1.27	; -D - I 'll be awaiting a reply soon .	St
1.1.28	Thanks for reading this post ; I 'm quite desperate here .	St
1.1.29	Tony	St
1.2.1	Welcome to the PC world .	St
1.2.2	It 's a place where hardware and data just vanish .	St
1.2.3	It drives people crazy ... now you see it/now you do n't .	St
1.2.4	# 1 rule ... ..backup/backup/backup .	Sug
1.2.5	Did you violate the rule ?	Ques
1.2.6	As far as I know HD 's do n't go click-click-click .	St
1.2.7	So unless someone has a better thought , I would install that new HD , load windows , install the old HD as a slave and see if I could salvage any of MY STUFF .	St
1.3.1	I suggest you visit the HD makers support website and get thier diagnostic test pgm.. Use it to test but do n't use the & quot ; destructive type & quot ; that will wipe out data , there are other tests for a quick check .	St
1.3.2	As the other poster mentioned , you have a new HD , install as prime or master ( alone ) and go from there .	St
1.3.3	Then later add old HD as suggested to try to recover data .	St
1.3.4	You can swap power leads for HD as well to see if that helps ( probably not ) but heck its a shot .	St
1.3.5	Further , try the safemode booting and see just how far it gets , if it does n't do that you probably do have a bad HD regardless .	Sug
1.3.6	if it does get pass and boot-up use the & quot ; scan & quot ; feature to quick check the HD or just back-up any data you can .	St
1.3.7	But , a click-click sound is n't good news , IMHO , be ready to install HD .	St
1.3.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
