since this happens before you even get to windows, that suggests a h/w problem.
the other poster is right, just replace the drive, you probably have no recourse to fix it.
i would think this is a broken or jammed sw. at tray door.
since, this is intermittent, then likely a broken sw.. you can reseat the data cable if you like or replace.
be sure if you buy new, replace with similar type drive as in eide or sata type.
you could borrow an used drive and see if it repeats action.
