<s> I currently have the following: DSL modem connected to Netgear WGR614 g router with 2 computers on wired lan and 2 wireless computers connecting to the Netgear. </s>
<s> The Westell is in bridged/passthru mode and not routing. </s>
<s> I recently had to move the DSL and wired computers to a closed off room and now the wireless is horribly slow - I guess because of the interference from conduit, distance, etc. </s>
<s> The 2.4 phones an microwave also don't help any (who came up with 2.4 on all this stuff!!?). </s>
<s> Soooo, I would like to separate the wireless router from the DSL somehow. </s>
<s> I also require the wireless and wired computers to go thru a router. </s>
<s> I have a extra Buffalo G router and a simple 4-port hub. </s>
<s> The Buffalo has a Access Point capability. </s>
<s> Can I merely connect the Buffalo as Wireless access Point via a Cat5 cable and connect wirelessly either thru the Buffalo or the Netgear? </s>
<s> Or is it more complex than this. </s>
<s> Thanx, Jim </s>
<s> See http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101496.asp You can use that as fodder for what you want to do. </s>

<s> The Westell Modem/router(probably a 6100) uses the same ip address as the Netgear router. </s>
<s> Please read the Forum Sticky . </s>
<s> It will tell you how to change the Netgear router so everything works. </s>
<s> As for the 2.4gh cordless phones, yes they use the same frequencies as the wireless routers. </s>

<s> My Linksys WRT350-N died within warranty. </s>
<s> Since withdrawl is not in my things to tolerate I bought a D-link DIR-655 while waiting for the Linksys to be replaced. </s>
<s> Now I have two Gigabit/wireless N routers. </s>
<s> Was wondering how to do that. </s>
<s> Since I seem to collect PCs (I have five now) I may need extra ports. </s>
<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> Stacking routers, hubs is a national pastime. </s>

<s> I might be better off with a switch. </s>
<s> The lights went out. </s>
<s> It's amazing how confabulated we must be. </s>
<s> I just bought this http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-DGS-2205-5-port-Desktop-Switch/dp/B000FIVDIA to go with my Gigabit router. </s>
