<s> I have cable modem service going into a Netgear WPN824 Router. </s>
<s> With this router I've been trying to home network a Dell Dimension PC (running XP Pro), an IBM Thinkpad notebook (running XP Pro), an iMac (recent purchase), and an HP PSC2510 all-in-one printer. </s>
<s> I'd like all three computers to be able to print to the HP printer; if necessary I can connect the iMac directly to the printer via USB cable (then use the computer to share the printer), but ideally would like everything to run through the router. </s>
<s> I have had no problem getting internet access to all computers through this router, but the printer (and file sharing)? </s>
<s> Yecch. </s>
<s> This doesn't sound impossible, and yet I've seemingly tried everything for many, many hours to no avail. </s>
<s> Can anyone much smarter than I am give me a step-by-step on how to get this accomplished? </s>
<s> Even if I can get this network setup like this, due to the Mac/PC thing can I have any hope that it will be stable for more than a day? </s>
<s> Many thanks. </s>
<s> I have a similar setup. </s>
<s> Connect your mac to your printer. </s>
<s> On each pc, download Bonjour for windows (its free on apple's website - just google bonjour for windows), and it's very self explanatory from there. </s>
<s> It works perfectly. </s>
<s> Leave it to apple to straighten out windows networking mess. </s>
<s> The only downside is that the mac has to be awake in order to print from any of the computers. </s>
<s> Mike </s>
<s> Thanks but having the iMac awake doesn't sound too convenient for us (there are stairs involved!). </s>
<s> On but in standby is not OK? </s>
<s> Do you know if the print jobs are held in a queue so that when the iMac wakes up the print jobs go through, or are they just lost? </s>
<s> If not, are there any other ideas out there to setup this network? </s>
<s> I'm not sure of the difference between standby and sleep on the Mac. </s>
<s> You can set the preferences to put the screen to sleep while still keeping the computer awake (under system preferences/energy saver). </s>
<s> In this scenario the jobs will print and you still save screen life. </s>
<s> If you send a print while the Mac is asleep, it does save the jobs in a queue. </s>
<s> It will not automatically print them when you awaken the Mac. </s>
<s> You need to go into the printer software and tell it to resume the print jobs. </s>
<s> (system preferences/print & fax/print queue...) One more thing I forgot to mention, the Mac must be awake while running the setup wizard for Bonjour on your other computers, or the pcs won't be able to find the printer. </s>
<s> There probably are other ways to set this up. </s>
<s> But just like you, I wasted hours trying to get Windows and my router software to do the job with no success. </s>
<s> Bonjour had it working in minutes. </s>
<s> And it's been reliable from day one. </s>
<s> Try it and post your experience. </s>
<s> I doubt you'll be disappointed. </s>
<s> As you predicted, it works great on my laptop. </s>
<s> I just had to open up UDP port 5353 in order for it to work, and that was pretty easy if you just look around a bit within Windows firewall. </s>
<s> Also as you predicted, the iMac needs to be awake. </s>
<s> Tonight I will try the other PC; no reason to not expect success here as well. </s>
<s> I've decided that a trip up the stairs when we want to print is much better than not being able to print at all, and climbing stairs has other benefits ... </s>
<s> Thanks for the info on Bonjour; it appears that you and Apple have solved my problem! </s>
