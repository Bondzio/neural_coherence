i used a 50' vga cable and 50' 3.5mm stereo cable to connect my laptop to my new samsung 52&quot; 650 which i have integrated into my marantz receiver and speakers.
i use a io 2.4 wireless long range keyboard and mouse to access the computer while leaving the transmitter near the computer.
works fine except that one has to play around with size just a bit.
no problems with hookup.
