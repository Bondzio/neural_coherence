recently my computer has been crashing for no apparent reason.
i originally thought that the processor was overheating so i vacuumed out the cooling fan on the cpu.
i also vacuumed the power supply box.
i've reformatted the hard drive and reloaded windows xp sp2.
i also replaced the network card after the crashes started.
it worked fine for about 4 days and then started crashing again.
i have 1ghz of memory and a 1.86ghz processor.
a local computer store ran some utility programs on it.
they didnt find any problems.
im stumped at this point.
it usually happens after a lot of applications have been used.
i would appreciate any suggestions that you may have.
thanks.
