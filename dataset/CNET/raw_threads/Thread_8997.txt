But given only the question and no details of what setup you envisioned I'm unsure if this was a good way to kick off your discussion. Try explaining in detail what you want to do. Bob

(Presently using XP sp2 with Network Magic to connect wirelessly rather than using My Network Places. Network Magic does not support powerline networking but I assume XP could, the same as with a true wired connection). I have purchased a Panasonic BL-PA100KT powerline networking kit (2 units (BL-PA100E) under the brand name of HD-PLC, High-Speed Power Line Network). I am curious if both could be operated simultaneously or would there be a conflict? Both would go through the same Hawking router using the cable modem. One of the setups would be wireless and the other pseudo wired through the house wiring. Could both be used at the same time?
