<s> Hope this is the right forum. </s>
<s> So I recently got a new mouse(Logitech g400 &lt;3) and it needs a loving friend. </s>
<s> When on my computer, I'm generally gaming, so I want a keyboard more designed for that. </s>
<s> I've already looked at a few, and they seem to get generally positive reviews. </s>
<s> $100 or less. </s>
<s> Logitech g110 Razer Black Widow Razer Lycosa Microsoft Sidewinder x6 If you own/have owned one of these boards and/or have any insight on them/what I should get/whats better, that'd be particularly delightful. </s>
<s> Your insight is appreciated. </s>
<s> The logitech units tended to be mushy/mashy buttons and surprisingly the MSFT units were good enough to not get complaints. </s>
<s> The MSFT units lasted 6+ years until we swapped the office over to laptops. </s>

<s> I'd recommend the Logitech Modern Warfare keyboard ! </s>
<s> It's got everything you need to intense gaming... </s>
<s> I especially like the back-lit LED keys! </s>
<s> Cheers, Ted </s>
