<s> I have three computers that have been networked through a Linksys 5-port ethernet hub. </s>
<s> We are in a rural area and use dial-up for our internet. </s>
<s> I had the internet connection on an older Dell Dimension 2350 but when the modem went out switched the connection to our Dell Latitude D830 notebook computer. </s>
<s> When I had to leave for a couple of weeks and took the notebook computer with me, my son connected to the internet using the modem in his ancient HP Pavilion. </s>
<s> Everything was working before I left all computers could access the internet and see files/folders/share printers. </s>
<s> Since I returned and hooked the notebook back into the network, the two desktop computers can see the internet is active on the notebook but cannot send/receive email, view web pages etc. </s>
<s> File/folder/printer sharing is working between all the computers. </s>
<s> All three computers are running Windows XP Home SP 3. </s>
<s> Any troubleshooting tips you can share would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Are you using ICS or some sort of router that works with dial-up to share the connection? </s>
<s> If ICS, I believe the host PC needs to be using 192.168.0.1 or something similar and, of course ICS would need to be enabled on one networked machine only. </s>
<s> By ICS Im assuming you mean Internet Connection Sharing. </s>
<s> If so, yes, I am using ICS - have re-run the Network Setup Wizard several times, making sure all the settings are correct (workgroup name is all the same, etc.) </s>
<s> The IP address of the notebook (host) computer is 192.168.0.1 ICS is enabled only on the notebook (host) computer. </s>
<s> Is there a way to test the hub to see if it has gone bad? </s>
<s> I tried to ping the other computers and the request timed out </s>
