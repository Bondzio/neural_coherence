your hard drive manufacturer should have a diagnostic utility that will test the drive for possible damage.
these are usually non-destructive processes.
often hd manufacturer's use these to validate warranty claims by having the user run the utility which returns a code describing the health of the drive.
download and run the utility.
as for ram, free diagnostics are also available.
use google to look up memtest or memory testers.
there are a couple of good ones that will create a boot floppy or an .iso that can be burned to a cd rom disk.
they work well.
if your problem is memory or the hd, these free utilities will let you know.
