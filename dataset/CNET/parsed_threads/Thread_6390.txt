<s> Hi A question for the forum I've set up my network based on the recommendations of the salesman at the store. </s>
<s> He suggested that I go with the Lynksys WRT54GS with speedbooster. </s>
<s> My network is set up with 2 desktop computers and my sons X-box hardwired into the router, with another desktop and a laptop with wireless cards. </s>
<s> I don't know enough about wireless technology ( wireless G, wireless N ) to know if there would be a difference in response time from the router to the individual devices. </s>
<s> My son occassionally complains about lag time with his X-box live, and I notice a huge difference between the desktop that is 3 feet from the router, and the other which is @ 80 feet away. </s>
<s> I would like to stay with Lynksys, as I find that this seems to work best in my neighborhood with my internet provider. </s>
<s> Any insight would be helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks Dennis </s>
<s> You can learn it or just accept the cheat sheet about this. </s>
<s> When ping, lag and such matters, get wired. </s>
<s> No wireless solution will assure you that it won't contribute to lag, ping times. </s>
<s> This is why you wire such a connection. </s>
<s> At 80 feet, the situation is not going to get any better. </s>
<s> You would NEVER consider wifi for this. </s>
<s> You might consider ethernet cable or powerline links. </s>

<s> My description was probably a little confusing. </s>
<s> The desktop that is 80 feet away, and the X-box are hardwired with cat5 ethernet cable, as well as the desktop that is 3 feet away. </s>
<s> The X-box is approximately 25 feet away from the router. </s>
<s> Will there be a difference in response time based on the different factors? </s>
<s> ( Distance, type of router, etc.. ) Thanks Dennis </s>
