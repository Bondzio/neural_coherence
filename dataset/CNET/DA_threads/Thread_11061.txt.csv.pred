1.1.2	I do hope someone can help .	St
1.1.3	I 'm new to the forums , but have posted two questions in the past and received some excellent ( and I might add , ever so grateful ) advice-help .	St
1.1.4	Well it seems I 'm in need of advice once again .	St
1.1.5	I need to purchase a video card , but my head is spinning from a weird mass of terminology !	St
1.1.6	I do know and understand that it must be AGP .	St
