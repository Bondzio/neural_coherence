i would recommend getting a wireless router with mimo.
this technology is a little more expensive than a typical wireless g router; it provides better range and speed.
by purchasing a router that provides better range than older routers you should be able to avoid the expense and complexity of a reapeater.
i am using a belkin wireless g with mimo router, placed in a corner of my 2800 square foot home, and it works great with my g4 powerbook.
i, also have it connected to three windows machines via ethernet and one windows laptop via an internal card.
you will want a router with sufficient ethernet ports to handle any computers that you want to connect via ethernet.
you might also want to have an extra port or two in case you add a network attached server or a network printer.
as a previous writer said, do be sure to enable the security feature of your router.
have fun!
