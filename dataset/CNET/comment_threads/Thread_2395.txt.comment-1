I'm looking to get a printer for my home, I know to get an inkjet printer.
I just don't know if I should get a printer with seperate color cartridges or an all in one.
And if I get an all in one, when one color goes out do I have to replace the whole thing?
I just want to know which would be the most cost effective.
Since I noticed some of the cartridges cost almost as much as the unit itself!
