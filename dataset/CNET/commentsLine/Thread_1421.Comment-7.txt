i just came across this netgear page:  my dg834g is a modem/router/switch/access point/firewall in one, and i've seen from the router admin page that i can switch off its dhcp assigning function.
if i disabled its auto-configuration to a network, gave it a static ip outside the range of my main router (dg834gt), gave my laptops static ips, and if i made sure the router(gt) and access point(g) were broadcasting the same ssid on different channels... wouldn't that work?
the gt would now be a modem & wireless router; the g would be an access point.
