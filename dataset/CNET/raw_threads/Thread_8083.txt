My laptop connects with a DWL-G650 D-Link AirPlus Xtreme G card. The laptop connection seems to break for a short time every few minutes and then reconnects within a few seconds or a minute max. The same thing happened at another location, using another Linksys router (same model as mine). The problem could be my laptop or the D-Link card. My next step is to buy / borrow a Linksys laptop card to try. Anybody has any better idea? Anybody encountered similar compatibility problems? Thanks for any any help, (ps. my SMC 801.11b USB connection, which worked fine with the SMC router does not work at all with Linksys. Is all the G-level compatibility limited to each manufacturer?)
