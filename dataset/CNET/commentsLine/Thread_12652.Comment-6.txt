who is this tech?
are you sure he knows what he's doing?
how could resetting the bios solve anything?
you didn't change the bios setting, so it should be the same as before the harddisk stopped working.
can you see the harddisk from &quot;my computer?&quot; if you can, don't do anything to the bios, try to reformat the disk instead.
when the computer starts up, it will try to detect all the drives.
generic computers displays this information right on the black screen, for about 2-3 seconds.
see if the system can detect the drive.
custom pcs built by large companies, such as dell, display their trademark instead, and sometimes hide the useful information.
in that case, go into the bios to view it.
also, custom machines don't always use delete key to get into bios.
in that case, there should be a few phrases of instructions on how to access it on the bottom of the screen somewhere.
the tech guy you talked to is an idiot.
don't listen to him.
