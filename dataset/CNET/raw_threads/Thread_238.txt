In closing the cleaners seem to not cure your issue for Windows XP and Vista. Registry cleaners did work on the old Windows 98 machines and days. Bob

In no way will it cure any hardcore problems as you mentioned, &quot;crashes&quot;, but it should clean some of the junk out. I further suggest, if you already know the location of junk files, directories, registry, etc., delete them manually using regedit. Make darn sure its the proper action to take. You can use the restore(create) point feature of MS to help in case you hose your system. Then defrag the HD to help consolidate it. If you had any &quot;hic-cups&quot; during the un-install, try reloading the problem app/pgm. and re-use its uninstall feature or the add/remove from MS. tada -----Willy

Then clean out temp files (don't compress any files or use Indexing.) If the c drive is compressed, then uncompress it. Then defrag as Willy suggested. Charlie

It all worked out and i suffer no more from crashes and slow start up! but when i was doing the regedit version, i was so nervous that i might delete a wrong file so before i started the regedit, i study first the apps/prgm i installed and uninstalled and then proceed to the deleting process and it went very well. so when i boot my pc i smile because in less than a second after my windows start up my desktop shows and my system tray work faster now. thankz guyz i luv this forum!
13613	6	292530	2758556	2758561	caktus	4/24/08 9:57 PM	1.20907422E12	Glad you got it worked out :-)	Another utility that may interest you is The Emergency Recovery Utility NT (ERUNT) Unlike System Restore, ERUNT backs up the entire registry and when it is used to restore the system it actually removes the many orphaned files left behind by many applications that have been uninstalled. If you download it, read the readme.txt file for a lot of interesting info. But in spite of what is says about disabling System Restore, I suggest not disabling System Restore (except to remove pests) as two back ups are always better than one. ERUNT backups can also be copied to a cd for safe keeping. As long as the ERUNT program is installed on the cd or the computer you can restore with it. The web page also has a Registry Optimizer, but it is rarely necessary to use such a utility. These apps are free of spy ware and such and the price (free) can't be beat. Charlie

Doesn't do anything for getting rid of duplicate entries that sometimes occur in the registry. That latter rarely causes any problem though other than unneccessary reg bloat.

Perhaps I'm just paranoid but since then when I suspect something is a duplicate I usually just leave it be, and in any case I don't use software for the job. Charlie
