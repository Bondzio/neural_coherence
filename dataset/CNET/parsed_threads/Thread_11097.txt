<s> Hi, Im just curious what effect the temperture of a computer has on it's power consumption? </s>
<s> I realize the obvious, that a hot computer will run fans faster and more often. </s>
<s> But will a hot CPU or other devises draw more power if not cooled properly? </s>
<s> Thanks so much, Dallas </s>
<s> I did some military electronics work and in short... CMOS based chips draw a little more at high temp than low because of some &quot;leakage&quot;. </s>
<s> But it's insignificant compared to the wattage that a CPU is dissipating when it's running a game. </s>
<s> For discussion I'm peg the leakage of a CPU to be some 0.010 Amperes at 1.8 Volts and even if it goes up by 10 times, thats all of 0.18 Watts. </s>
<s> Given some CPUs are now at 100 Watts, that's not an effect that I'd worry about. </s>
<s> Hope this answers that. </s>
