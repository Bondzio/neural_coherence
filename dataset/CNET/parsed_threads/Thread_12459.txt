<s> I have an Acer A0150 netbok which runs XP. </s>
<s> I would like to upgrade it to Windows 7, but Acer were less than helpful when I asked if it would be possible. </s>
<s> Has anyone successfully upgraded this netbook? </s>
<s> I have found the W7 Webcam driver for their Ferrari netbook, which I assume would work as it is the same camera as on the A0150. </s>
<s> available on their website, you're going to find yourself out of luck. </s>
<s> This goes especially for the motherboard chipset as other drivers rely on that one working. </s>
<s> Since an XP upgrade to Win7 requires a clean installation, you could try your luck by buying a brand new HD and not risk messing up the one that works. </s>
<s> There's no harm in having a second HD around. </s>
<s> 2 of my buddies have upgraded and it works great. </s>
<s> There is a sale supposed to occur this week on Microsoft's anytime upgrade for $45. </s>
<s> I'm going to try that. </s>
<s> My buddies both use Asus, I have Toshiba's netbook and it does evertying my 17&quot; HP will so far as I've found. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> It is what I suspected. </s>
<s> Hi David, I recommend running the Upgrade Advisor before moving from XP to Windows 7. </s>
<s> It will tell you what changes (if any) to make before upgrading, and if your Netbook is able to run Windows 7. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor Cheers, Cassandra </s>
<s> Hi Cassandra, Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> I have done that and it only highlighted the web cam, but having done the upgrade on my desktop, you only find out the problems when you do it. </s>
<s> Regards David. </s>
<s> Hi, If anyone is interested, I took the plunge and upgraded my Acer netbook from XP to Windows 7 Home premium. </s>
<s> The only issue that was highlighted on the Windows 7 adviser was the webcam. </s>
<s> I downloaded the camera diver for the Ferrari 1 from the Acer site and so far it's all working perfectly. </s>
<s> In fact the performance is at least as good as with XP. </s>
