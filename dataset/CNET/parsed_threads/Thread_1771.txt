<s> I am looking for help to resolve a home networking 2.4 GHz interference issue. </s>
<s> I am currently using an IBM Thinkpad T42 with 11a/b/g Wireless LAN Mini PCI Adapter II, Linksys WRT54G router (channel 6), have a cordless 2.4 GHZ phone and a wireless video camera system that transmits at 2.4 GHz. </s>
<s> When the camera is in use the wireless network is completely non functional. </s>
<s> I cannot change the camera, could change the phone and or router. </s>
<s> I'm considering the Linksys WRT55AG dual band router or Belkin Wireless Pre N Router. </s>
<s> Would appreciate any comments on these 2 routers or any other router suggestions. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I've seen such and the only thing that works is to get wired or find old 802.11a 5.8GHz wifi parts. </s>
<s> Rare and getting pricey but necessary for those that can't get rid of other 2.4GHz sources. </s>
