best if both are hdmi, second would be dvi, and third would be a way to send component video to your tv.
otherwise, i think you'll be fine.
sure, a better graphics card is good, but my own experience says don't spend the money now if it's something you &quot;think&quot; you might do.
you may find you like doing other things on your new pc and don't have time to get into gaming.
you can always upgrade the graphics card later, and since you're getting into computing, you'll probably find it's a pretty easy upgrade.
good luck!
