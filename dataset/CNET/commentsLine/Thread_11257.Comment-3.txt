in an office i just repaired, the owner was fretting over the cost of wire and trying to run on an old dumb network hub.
it took a week of me (elapsed time, not time face to face) for it to sink in that 50 people at the office going down for an hour was costing far more than the cable and hub in question.
we did keep most runs, but the old dumb hub was history.
we installed a new switching hub and found what may have been the causes of the entire office going down.
it was a cable that was old, but un-marked so we didn't know what it was and a few machines with failing network cards.
you have to ask if risking downtime is worth it.
bob ps.
their network was crashing daily.
now it doesn't.
