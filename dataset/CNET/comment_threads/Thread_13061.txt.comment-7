I can see where you may have thought your PC could have HT by looking at this link indicating HT tech suported the 533MHz system bus: 3.06MHz.
However, scrolling down, your 915GV chipset is not listed as one of those with HT.
http://www.intel.com/products/ht/hyperthreading_more.htm They list these Intel desktop chipsets with 533/400 MHz as having HT: 910GL, 865P, 850E, 845PE, 845GE, 845GV, 845E, 845G I also note your Pent 4 processor number 519 is not listed with those that have HT support.
