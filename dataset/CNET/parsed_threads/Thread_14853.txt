<s> Recently, I was hired by a client to recover the data on a new macbook pro. </s>
<s> They said one day the computer just wouldn't start, so they brought it to the Apple store, where they switched out the hard drive. </s>
<s> They got to keep the old drive, which I attempted to recover using VirtualLab and R-Studio data recovery programs and a USB hard drive case. </s>
<s> Both programs did the same thing: they scanned, and kept finding errors and never even got through 1% of the disk! </s>
<s> R-Studio even scanned for almost 24 hours and nothing came up from the partition we needed to recover! </s>
<s> Disk utility was the first thing I tried, and it appeared to have scanned the entire drive (this was about 3 weeks prior to trying the other programs)and found a lot of errors, but was not able to recover or repair the drive. </s>
<s> Also, the hard drive kept making a pulsating, repeating sound while it was being scanned that sounded like it was trying to read the disk, almost a scraping sound but not quite. </s>
<s> The drive did spin up and was recognized by the recovery programs, but it did not mount in OS X. I was just wondering if anyone here has had a similar problem, or knows of a better program and/or a good, trustworthy advanced data recovery service she can hire to recover her important data. </s>
<s> Any help would be much appreciated!! </s>
<s> Thank you, Nick </s>
<s> BIG BUCKS There are a lot of recovery companies out there but all of them charge a lot of money to recover a disk. </s>
<s> Expect to pay at least a couple of thousand to recover a decent size drive. </s>
<s> I would be tempted to give Disk Warrior a chance at the disk but from your description of the sounds, I would not hold out great hope. </s>
<s> I know it is a little late now, but perhaps your client will now consider a backup strategy, Time Machine for instance. </s>

<s> Was about 22K. </s>
<s> The drive was from a Novell server and had medical records that the IT didn't backup. </s>
<s> http://www.drivesavers.com did the miracle and got it back. </s>
<s> That's about the highest I've seen for data recovery but they did get it done. </s>

<s> If your drive is making sounds, there's a good chance that's there is a hardware issue. </s>
<s> IE the heads are scrapping against the platter, which will destroy the drive completely. </s>
<s> If the data is very important, I would definitely look at a data recovery service, which is expensive as others have said. </s>
<s> If you want to give it a shot yourself, you can always try the freezer method. </s>
<s> The chances are slim that you'll be able to recover everything, but you might be able to boot off the OSX cd and recover a few files at least. </s>
<s> The problem is once the freeze wears off, and it's rather quick, the drive will start to bang again, and damage the disk even further. </s>
<s> Try free mac data recovery software on Download.com &gt; http://download.cnet.com/Disk-Drill/3000-2094_4-75307728.html called Disk Drill, i've read a lot of good reviews </s>
