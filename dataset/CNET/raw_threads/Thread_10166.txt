4932	0	122593	1390212	NR	mike_obi	8/29/05 7:10 AM	1.1252994E12	Windows -Delayed Write Failed	Hi there I took out the HDD(Toshiba MK1516GAP 15GB ATA-2/3/4 2.5&quot; 9.5mm Hard Drive) from an old vaio notebook and put it into a 2.5 external casing (usb) to use as portable storage. When all is connected windows recognizes the drive i.e as a toshiba and its size. Now the problem arises when i try to read from or write to the drive. For the first few minutes(5min) after i plug in the usb cable i seem to be able to read and write to the drive. Then after i keep getting the following message: Windows -Delayed Write Failed ------------------------------ Windows was unable to save all the data for the file (path of file). The data has been lost. This error may be caused by a failure of your computer hardware or network connection. Please try to save this file elsewhere. When i then try to access the drive i get this: I:\ is not accessible The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error Any help given would be very much appreciated

It worked fine for a few days before this problem cropped up. It happened on both XP and 98! Finally, I got rid of the plugin card and started to use the mobo USB. No prob, no speed. I think it could have been a hardware failure. Not sure. Waiting for more info ......

I was able to access the data in my external HD yesterday and today i keep getting the Delay Write Fail error as well. Any idea how to resolve this problem?

CHKDSK T: /F /X If the drive needs to be checked later, answer yes. -&gt; This will also occur if the drive is full to the brim. Remove a GB and see if that and CHKDSK helps. If not, find the drive fitness test and don't trust this drive. Bob

I tried it in both Fat32 and NTFS modes as well as in RAID1 and as two independent drives, but would continue to randomly get this error message - mostly on writing large (&gt;500MB) files but occasionally on reads as well. Finally - due to the suggestion in this thread about the USB wire - I switched the connection of this unit from a USB wire to a 1394 wire (fortunately my laptop had this port) and the errors finally cleared up.
