<s> Hi I am going to build a new computer for gaming. </s>
<s> i.e. </s>
<s> crysis, bioshock etc. </s>
<s> I am wondering what would perform better? </s>
<s> Intel Core 2 Duo E6750 & Asus P5N32-E SLI Plus 775 PCI-E Nvidia 650I or AMD X2 Dual Core AM2 Athlon 64 4600 & Asus M2N-SLI Deluxe SKT AM2 if its too hard to tell w/o tests dw. </s>
<s> Over at www.tomshardware.com. </s>
<s> For most the Intel Core 2 Duo will be the winner (for today.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I saw a bit of tomshardware on youtube but all of the stuff was like 5 years old P4! </s>
<s> He has the core 2 duo and X2 AMD results too. </s>
<s> Since the C2D wins today I'll stop here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Intel is an industry leader. </s>
<s> AMD is nothing but cheaper copied intel knockoffs adn I say that with complete honestly and certainty. </s>
<s> Intel's performance benchamrks say everything you need to hear. </s>
<s> As for a specific processor - given the selection I would choose the Core2Duo however If you really want the best processor available I would go with the new Core 2 Extreme. </s>
<s> This processor is unique in that it has 4 core ( different the the current standard of 2) which function as mini engine/processor. </s>
<s> Infact Crysis has be optimized for use on the Core2Extreme(C2E) chip, which means that Crysis was designed/coded to work better on the specific chip. </s>
<s> Crysis is going to be a sick agme - NOWHERE else has there been such a high multi-threaded game with advance enemy AI!!! </s>
<s> yes - the enemy becomes smarter base on your playing and processor ability!!! </s>
<s> good luck an happy building... FYI the processor is the heart, mind, lungs and nerves of the computer so try to invest in the best on you can buy!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I will try to afford a C2E but its like 500 (im english!) </s>
<s> and thats quite alot of money! </s>
<s> For me anyway considering im only 13! </s>
<s> But thanks again. </s>
<s> I have a nice Core Duo 2.0 GHz laptop. </s>
<s> It's fine. </s>
<s> No 3D games since it has only the 950 GMA solution but for a desktop you can go with dual core pentiums and get quite the bang for the buck. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> monopoly. </s>
<s> We'd have less CPU development and much higher prices. </s>
<s> It wasn't long ago that AMD was in the driver's seat. </s>
<s> In this case, it's clear competition benefits consumers and end users. </s>
<s> Keeps the mfgs on their toes. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> This is true however let us not forget other competitiors like IBM and VIA technologies that also make processors and have been way before AMD's time. </s>
<s> Yes a competitve marketplace breeds innovation at lower prices yet it also derails Research & Developement through creating a resource shift to Marketing which is typically becomes half of cost of the product. </s>
<s> In addition, Intel didn't need competition to drive its innovation as it was already dedicated to exponential improvements through its commitment to Moore's Law. </s>
<s> A mere 25 percent marketshare consisting of niche segments (ie. </s>
<s> gamers) is hardly a driverseat as much as a stowaway. </s>
