I'm not sure if this is the right forum section or not, but here goes: On an ATI Radeon X1650 Pro Video Card, I have a 19&quot; Flat Pannel monitor hooked into the VGA port.
There is nothing wrong with that.
Everything works fine.
The problem now is this: I went out and bought a DVI to HDMI cable.
I plugged it into my Graphics Card, and then the other end to the TV.
When I boot up the computer, it shows images on both the monitor and TV (which is what I want), but as soon as the actual Windows Kernel loads, the picture on the TV goes to the blank blue screen.
Can anybody help?
