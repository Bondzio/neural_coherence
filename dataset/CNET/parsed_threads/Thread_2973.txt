<s> Just Installed new 80 gig WD hard drive as C and D, replacing a 40 gig WD HDD. </s>
<s> Win XP home is on C. Have a second HD, a 10 gig HD labeled F and G. I want to remove the 10 gig F&G hard drive, and put in place the OLD WD 40 gig C&D drive, which has windows XP home and lots of program & data folders. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Will the drives show up as F&G, same as one replaced? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Will there be any problems doing this... will windows somehow try to access the old copy of XP on the other drive? </s>
<s> ''I will insure jumper in correct position''. </s>
<s> Do not want dual boot. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I plan to copy all wanted files from the ''old'' C drive to the new D drive, than REFORMAT the old C drive, removing WIN XP from second drive. </s>
<s> ANY PROBLEMS DOING THAT? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Is there anything I should look out for? </s>
<s> Thanks Ben </s>
<s> None of this is automatic. </s>
<s> Hard disks, content don't move, keep drive letters on their own so you'll have copy/clone drives as you see fit, format/partition as needed. </s>
<s> No &quot;easy button&quot; that I've seen. </s>
