<s> I get my high speed internet by connecting my 3g phone to my computer.This is my only source for internet I cannot get DSL or cable. </s>
<s> I want to set up a wireless network in my house for my tv and WII. </s>
<s> Conventional wireless routers do not apply and I need to know if this is possible. </s>
<s> I am using a PC running Vista and the phone is a Samsung Propel. </s>
<s> Here's how. </s>
<s> I have your usual DROID running Easytether then on a Windows XP netbook I use ICS then from the ethernet port I connect up a WIFI ROUTER. </s>
<s> I must decline any step by step since you must be able to maintain such a setup. </s>
<s> The reason I used a netbook is the cost and the power draw on my netbook is less than 10 Watts. </s>
<s> I see some use an old PC but those usually are well above 100 Watts. </s>

<s> All you really need to do is search 3g router. </s>
<s> This is still a very specialized market. </s>
<s> One of the larger vendors is cradlepoint. </s>
<s> Still this is going to take some very careful research to find a model that is compatible with your phone and cell provider. </s>
<s> The service you will get is best described as better than nothing which sounds like your situation. </s>
<s> Be very careful that your plan allows you to &quot;tether&quot; your phone, it a contractual thing not technical. </s>
<s> The caps on the data plans also are a concern. </s>
<s> Thanks thats the direction I was looking. </s>
