<s> I have a new hardisk (Seagate 500GB) but it is making CLICK! </s>
<s> NOISES now. </s>
<s> I have 1 year warranty left. </s>
<s> So i just wanna make it Crush Technically then i can get another New One, (as a replace for warranty from the shop.) </s>
<s> So weird i put a few water inside its circuit even while running. </s>
<s> But its still detecting and working well (but with NOISES). </s>
<s> Then i plugged the power cable OFF and ON many times while PC is running. </s>
<s> But its still alive. </s>
<s> How can i make it dead technically?? </s>
<s> Note : I can't open the Case or touch any Screws as its Terms &amp; Conditions of Warranty. </s>
<s> Because the Warranty won't apply on any User Errors such Case Opening/ Physical Damaging .. etc. </s>
<s> So i just need another technical technique. </s>
<s> you voided the warranty. </s>
<s> You're going to need to send it back as is. </s>
<s> If you're worried about data that's on it, you can run the Seatools destructive diagnostics test and write zeros to the drive. </s>
<s> The test should provide a return code that's needed for warranty replacement. </s>
<s> If the drive is really messed up, it won't be able to wipe the data anyway. </s>
<s> I'm afraid you're options are few if you want it replaced for free. </s>
