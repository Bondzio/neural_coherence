I have a &quot;very&quot; old GW2K Solo 9300 VE laptop that I had upgraded my old 12gb hdd to a 40gb hdd a number of years ago. While I'd love to buy a newer laptop, budgets are such now that it'll have to wait. I can however get a larger hard drive, and have been reviewing the larger, and newer hard drives. And yes-- I can hear your peanut gallery comments already, so just please stick with my question. What is the difference in the connection interface between the old UltraDMA-ATA 100, and the new SATA connections? I must be using the wrong search criteria because I can't find side by side comparison descriptions. So, if you know of any websites that show the differences, those would work. Thank you for your responses.

Since it's an older laptop I'd stick to drives under 127GB. http://www.geeks.com/products_sc.asp?cat=414 shows a few 80GB drives for 60 and under. Bob

Why not buy an external USB drive to accommodate your growing storage? ...and make sure you follow all the sage advise about backups.
