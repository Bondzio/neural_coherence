1.1.1	I just bought an Acer X203H LCD monitor.	St
1.1.2	It has quite a bit of light leakage around the bottom and top of the screen.	St
1.1.3	Is that the norm on these or should I take it back and try another one.	St
1.1.4	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	But the last time I fielded this complaint the owner had just obtained their first LCD display and needed a discussion on how LCDs work.	St
1.2.2	Also they were looking at it at 89 degrees to see the leak through the bezel.	St
1.2.3	Looking straight on we couldn't see the leak.	St
