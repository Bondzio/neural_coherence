my wife & i have used generic cartridges & have also used bulk ink & filled our own for some time with several models of printers without difficultly.
we have found that we get &quot;fuzzy&quot; print if we refill a generic cartridge or if we try to refill a manufacturer's cartridge more than twice (sometimes more than once).
i'm sure this is due to the fact that the print head is on the cartridge & becomes worn with repeated use.
i print many photos & use refilled cartridges for this purpose & get beautiful results.
