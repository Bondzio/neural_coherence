1.1.1	I'm using direct VGA to VGA from my lenovo laptop to a hannspree 25&quot; lcd 1080p tv.	St
1.1.2	My laptop is supposed to be able to support a second monitor, and the tv has the vga port with pc input mode.	St
1.1.3	However the signal doesnt make it to the tv.	St
1.1.4	When I plug in the cable my laptop recognizes theres a second monitor (I can move things off the screen) and a second monitor appears in the display settings.	St
1.1.5	How can I troubleshoot the problem?	St
1.2.1	The tv doesn't do anything at all - it just says &quot;No Signal&quot; no matter what I do.	St
1.2.2	None of that &quot;it works then doesn't&quot; stuff.	St
1.2.3	It does nothing.	St
1.3.1	Be sure to check the TV setup itself to direct &quot;input source&quot; as TVs are highly configurable as well.	St
1.3.2	The other half is that the laptop needs to be setup to show there is a 2nd display.	St
1.3.3	Since, its shows that then the signal source is lost at the TV side.	St
1.3.4	I suspect you use the OSD of the TV or whatever it needs, otherwise it defaults to std.	St
1.3.5	signal source, like cable, sat./or antenna, get the idea.	St
1.3.6	tada -----Willy	St
