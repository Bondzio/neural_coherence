Get the cpu-z pgm., google for the source, then run it.
It will ID the cpu you truly have.
That way, you get the same class cpu and then decide the best cpu, the system will handle.
Gateway isn't that forthcoming in such details, but likely you can install a 3.4mhz cpu.
It important to find the &quot;multiplier value&quot; or FSB as this will allow to what speed cpu you can accept as a drop-in.
If the value is already what your current cpu is installed, you may not be able to upgrade higher as you're locked-in to what the mtrbd.
supports.
I saw no cpu upgrade from Gateway, but you can ask if such is possible, email them and hope for a response.
