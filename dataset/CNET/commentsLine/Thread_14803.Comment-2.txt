you should be able to open it up to inspect if there are bays to install the drives.
if not, please find a shop to do the work.
hp used to put drives in cages then that in the machine but has not done so for years in the consumer line.
as to the windows 7 question, 7 supports such drives but so folk forget to partition and format the drive prior to use and lose a lot of time hunting for the drive.
do you remember those steps?
