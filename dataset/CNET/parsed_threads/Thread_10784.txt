<s> * 65nm allows more cores per wafer, reducing production costs * 65nm runs cooler; the smaller transistors consume less power * smaller transistors that generate less heat can theoretically run faster and why are you concerned over virtualization? </s>
<s> it's only used by software like vm-ware or virtual pc and it's not affecting performance in a regular pc at all. </s>
<s> so let's go too the horses mouth First a definition: Thermal Design Power http://processorfinder.intel.com/glossary.aspx You'll need to scroll down a bit to find the definition. </s>

<s> Ummmm, wonder why this is? </s>
<s> Could it be they get hotter? </s>
<s> Once these maximum operating temperatures are reached many PC will literally stop/crash till the CPU cools down. </s>
<s> What's not said or implied is that most PCs run poorly as they approach this maximum, think within 5C or so of maximum. </s>
<s> Having experienced this myself I'd say this is true. </s>
<s> Past the 920 processor little chances. </s>
<s> At 920 and above the processors are simply factory overclocked. </s>
<s> Frankly, I like your approach. </s>
<s> This way is how we learn by getting to the root of things by doing this we strip away the opinion and get to the truth. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time on this unfortunately, I can't do the same right now and give this the time, Yet, in large part I already have. </s>
<s> Like I said I don't need the virtualization feature. </s>
<s> My RAM has been shipped in a few days we'll see if your right about it not working on my PC. </s>
<s> I bet it does. </s>
<s> I think we've reached an impasse. </s>
<s> We're in a loop. </s>
<s> i'm only 'arguing' with you because you're denying yourself an effective and inexpensive upgrade. </s>
<s> you mistook the pentium 900 series as a 'server' chip and you mistaken in assuming there's no performance benefit beyond 3ghz. </s>
<s> TDP = &quot;The maximum amount of heat which a thermal solution must be able to dissipate from the processor *so that the processor will operate under normal operating conditions. </s>
<s> *&quot; in other words, TDP is how much heat the cpu cooler has to be able to dissipate to ensure the cpu will function properly... it is not a temperature that the cpu runs at. </s>
<s> page 82, table 26 of this document explains it plainly: http://download.intel.com/design/PentiumXE/datashts/31030607.pdf quote: 1. </s>
<s> Thermal Design Power (TDP) should be used for processor thermal solution *design targets*. </s>
<s> The TDP is not the maximum power that the processor can dissipate. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> This table shows the maximum TDP for a given frequency range. </s>
<s> *Individual processors may have a lower TDP*. </s>
<s> There's an overlap for the 3.2-3.6ghz range because the later D0 stepping of the 900 series (which includes all 9x5 processors) runs cooler than the original B1 stepping. </s>
<s> Thus any pentium d 900 series you purchase now will have a TDP of only 95W which is the same as the TDP of the lower speed 800 series. </s>
<s> This is proven in your link: http://processorfinder.intel.com/list.aspx?ProcFam=2112 here's the 3.4ghz 950 D0 stepping, tdp=95W, tspec=63.4C: http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SL9K8, and the 2.8ghz 820, tdp=95W, tpec=64.1C: http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SL88T . </s>
<s> By design, the 900 series is no hotter than the 800 series and in real world use a 3.4ghz 900 series runs cooler than the 820. all pentium Ds will throttle back if they overheat (about 71c). </s>
<s> as you said, the faster a processor is the more heat it generates. </s>
<s> but the cpu cooler removes (dissipates) that heat. </s>
<s> so, a faster processor will make a heatsink/fan work harder but if the cooler is designed properly and can meet the tdp spec, the cpu will not overheat and will not slow down. </s>
<s> my 945 with an arctic freezer pro never goes above 61C, *never* throttles, and *never* sounds like the jet engine that spun up when the 820 got busy. </s>
<s> throttling is seperate from eist (enhanced intel speedstep). </s>
<s> eist slows down a cpu based on load to *avoid heat buildup*. </s>
<s> so if the cpu load is low, the cpu may slow down by 30% or more. </s>
<s> eist is adjustable and can be disabled; throttling cannot. </s>
<s> no intel processors are 'factory overclocked'. </s>
<s> intel has a strict 'no overclocking' policy and will not warrant any processor that is run outside its stated operating frequencies. </s>
<s> intel tests each cpu to determine what speed it can reliably run at. </s>
<s> once that speed is identified, the speed is then programmed into a multiplier on the cpu package (the mini-chips on the bottom of the processor: http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/cpu/cheapdualcore/pentium_d.jpg ). </s>
<s> so a 3.4ghz pd 945 is running within spec and is fully warranteed by intel to last just as a long as 2.8ghz cpu. </s>
<s> one last link: http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=1988&page=20 quote: Intel's second generation of dual core processors is much better than its first. </s>
<s> The 65 nanometer Presler core is still quite an energy hog, but it doesn't produce as much heat and thanks to the larger L2 cache, is clock for clock faster than the Intel Pentium D 800 series processors. </s>
<s> The Intel Pentium D 940 is the ideal processor for a Socket 775 user who's looking to upgrade. </s>
<s> The 2MB L2 cache gives it a performance boost over the Pentium D 800-series, and the smaller 65nm manufacturing process means less noise and heat to deal with. </s>

<s> The first factory equipped unit was inadequate so we up graded it. </s>
<s> From your post: &quot;they emphasized that it requires specific processor and case cooling requirements.&quot; I am familiar with these specifications and have in fact brought this PC into compliance with them. </s>
