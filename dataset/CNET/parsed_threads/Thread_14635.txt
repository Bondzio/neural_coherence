<s> At our office we have two 50in HD TVs that have VGA and HDMI. </s>
<s> We want to stream internet on them but they don't have any network or internet capability. </s>
<s> I have a PC that has a dual HDMI and DVI video card in it. </s>
<s> I'm thinking that what I could do is that I could put a DVI-D to HDMI adapter on the DVI port and run two 50 ft HDMI in wall cables to the TVs that way I could extend the PC desktop to the TVs. </s>
<s> Showing two different things on both TVs. </s>
<s> I'm not sure that is even possible or will work. </s>
<s> PLUS how would I do sound for each TV would that be possible. </s>
<s> Anyone that can help me figure out to accomplish this or if this would even work I'd appreciate it! </s>
<s> If so I have only seen demos of this but never in off the shelf machines. </s>
<s> I'm going with no and then suggest a solution. </s>
<s> Get a pair of netbooks with hdmi (those 238 buck things at target.com?) </s>
<s> and use those. </s>
<s> Or maybe a pair of Logitech Revues at 99 bucks each and use the web browser on that. </s>
<s> For the network you would have to reveal how you get the internet without &quot;any network or internet capability.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> You need an internet connection! </s>
<s> Some motherboards have DVI AND RGB and sometime even HDMI connections all in one box. </s>
<s> My main PC has DVI and RGB, so I use both going to different monitors. </s>
<s> I see no difference in quality (16801x1050). </s>
<s> On my media PC, I have onle a PCI output, which I run to a small WXGA monitor, and use a USB video adapter VisionTek() for the TV (at 1080p). </s>
<s> I have a 5.1 audio card in the box which I use for DVD playback, but you can use a 2 or 2.1 system if you are going to stream internet, because I don't know of any (please tell me if there are) Dolby-encoded internet video sources. </s>
<s> I'm almost sure if you get a 1080p capable video card (or mobo) with two outputs, you should be able to do it like that (be sure to ask or try it out). </s>
<s> Otherwise, check out a USB video box, they're pretty reasonable. </s>
<s> Even a single netbook or laptop might be fit for the job, if it has RGB and HDMI, with sufficient resolution. </s>
