i just upgraded from win98se to xp pro and i can't find a driver for my gateway keyboard (model # 7001211).
gateway's website has a driver for newer keyboards and i downloaded one which i thought would work but no such luck.
i visited microsoft's website and they didn't have anything of any use either.
suggestions?
