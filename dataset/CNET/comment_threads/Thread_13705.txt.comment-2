Your Internet connection must be DSL or cable.
Connect a wireless router to the DSL or cable modem.
Install a wireless NIC into the desktop or laptop.
You can now access the Internet via the modem using RF (Radio Frequency in the GHz bandwidth).
My home network has a wireless router, D-link DI-614+.
I have three desktops wired to three ports and the laptop has a wireless NIC.
I can use it all over the house.
I could install a wireless NIC into one of the desktops and use it in another room without running Cat-5 wire.
That's it.
