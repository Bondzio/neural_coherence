If I buy a seperate PCI IDE controller, will it work alongside the existing one in the motherboard allowing me another 4 drives or will there be a conflict? I've had a look around various web sites but can't find anything that answers this question. Thanks,

Maybe you want some controller that will &quot;just work&quot; without all the hoopla of drivers and more. The short answer is that there was no standard in the basic design for this so you step off into drivers and more. You also may have skipped the usual suspect of Promise Technology which has the cards, and you can read the manuals. Here's their web site http://www.promise.com http://www.promise.com/support/file/manual/FT66_Manual_En.pdf for example is a manual for one of the products. As you can tell, you can't put CDROM type devices on it. But that's not a big deal since the hard disks (4) can go on the Promise and the CDROM (4) units can be on your motherboard. When allocating Watts for each drive, use about 30 Watts per drive. http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/powersupplies-02.html can get you some other numbers so you don't overtax the PSU.

Is it a brand name or a clone? Is there even room inside for more drives? Are the existing drives SCSI or IDE (many servers use SCSI drives). You might consider adding a Snap Server to the network to add disk space instead of adding more drives to the system.
