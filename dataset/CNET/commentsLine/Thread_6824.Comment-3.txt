after investigating the hdd i took apart, it seems the hdd reading pins , or whatever they are called, are slightly bent.
i'm going to try and get myself a old similar hdd and put the hard disk in that one to see if it can still read my data.
and you're right if i had the tools and the skills (got skills but not much on hardware) i wouldn't be asking.
but that's what forums are for, right!
