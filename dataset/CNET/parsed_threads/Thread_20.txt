<s> Well I just recieved a new mother board and installed that with my new Amd Fx 60 and then to top it all off, I added the Nvidia 8800gtx. </s>
<s> Now ,the first time the computer actually booted and I wanted to install windows but i deleted on of the partions( previous installtion of windows) and rebooted the computer. </s>
<s> This is where all hell breaks lose. </s>
<s> Now when I try to turn on the computer, the lights, the fans and the hardrive are all on, but there is no animation on the screen. </s>
<s> Now I do have a 500 wat prowersupply, but so do a lot of people who own this including my brother! </s>
<s> Also it is above the requirment for the card, which is 450watts. </s>
<s> Suggestions... </s>
<s> Does anyone have any guess what I should do next instead of calling nvidia and my mother baord company (last resort)? </s>
<s> Do you think it has anything to do with deleting the partion on my hardrive of my previous windows? </s>
<s> I find it odd that it wont boot but last time it did. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time and support. </s>

<s> While there is no way I would believe it could actually deliver 680, it does fine on the machines here. </s>
<s> Be sure it has the power leads your machine and components require. </s>
