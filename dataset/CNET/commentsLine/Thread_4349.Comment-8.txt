yes - i have previously used this drive successfully in the same enclosure.
i have also tried the drive connected to the enclosure without closing the case.
the curious thing is that i now have 2 different enclosures which were previously working fine, but which are showing the same symptoms (tried with 2 different sata drives and 3 different pc's).
could be just a helluva coincidence i suppose.
