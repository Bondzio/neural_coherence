jumper settings on both drives you want to attach.
the best way, with newer drives, is to use an 80 conductor cable and set jumpers to cs (cable select).
the 80 conductor cable has a specific way it needs to be connected to the mb.
the important thing to note is that the blue connector goes to the motherboard.
