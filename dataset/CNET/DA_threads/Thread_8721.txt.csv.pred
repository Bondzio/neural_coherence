1.1.1	Hello to all !	St
1.1.2	I am hoping for a little help again .	St
1.1.3	here are my specs Model : Dell Dimension 2400 Chassis Type : Space Saving Service Tag : FR99741 Operating System : Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2 ( Build 2600 ) Hard Drive 1 : ST380011A Serial Number : 3JV94TCB Size : 76.29 GB Buffer : 2048 KB Hard Drive Type : ATA Current Transfer Rate : UDMA-100 Max Transfer Rate : UDMA-100 Volumes : c : \ Size : 76.25 GB ( 34.95 GB Free ) Optical Drive 1 : HL-DT-ST DVD-ROM GDR8162B Type : DVD-ROM drive Current CD Read Speed : 20X ( Max 48X ) Optical Drive 2 : TEAC DVD+RW DV-W58E Type : DVD/CD-RW combo drive Current CD Read Speed : 40X ( Max 40X ) Current CD Write Speed : 32X ( Max 32X ) PROBLEM : I can only burn music CDS with my drive .	St
1.1.4	I used to be able to put pics on either cd or dvd disks .	St
1.1.5	i also used to be able to put video onto a DVD ( HOME MOVIE ) i HAVE DVD DECRYPTOR , DVD SHRINK , AND WINDOWS ( FOR MY PICS ) .	St
1.1.6	Most forums that i have read say that my drive has gone bad ; they dont tend to last very long .	St
1.1.7	I guess my question is why can i burn music cds but when i try to burn pictures or movies my software doesnt recognize that there is media in the drive .	St
1.1.8	i have tried dvd-rw and dvd+rw , cd-r and cd-rw media .	St
1.1.9	I have also tried to troubleshoot using windows but i dont get anywhere .	St
1.1.10	I am hoping there is a simple fix that i have over looked .	St
1.2.1	Your subject line says your burner does n't recognize media .	St
1.2.2	In your post you say you can burn music cd 's ( but no data cd 's ) .	St
1.2.3	That seems a contradiction .	St
1.2.4	And is n't the recognition part of the burning the same for burning a music CD or a data CD ?	Ques
1.2.5	So where in the turn of events does it differ .	St
1.2.6	You can try to burn using a free program called CDBURNERXP .	St
1.2.7	If that does n't work either , I 'd replace the drive and try again .	St
1.2.8	Replacing is a rather easy job and the drives are n't expensive .	St
1.2.9	Kees	St
1.3.1	now you see why i am confused !	St
1.3.2	I use the same burner w/out any problem when i burn music cd 's .	St
1.3.3	But when i want to burn to a dvd media , my software ( no matter which one i try ) says to insert media .	St
1.3.4	by your reaction i 'm getting that this is probably a user error ?	Ques
1.3.5	Or could it be that the drive just needs replaced ?	Ques
1.3.6	I was hoping there was a missing driver or update .	St
1.4.1	In your first post you say you can burn music cd 's , but not data cd 's and any dvd 's .	St
1.4.2	Now you say you ca n't burn to dvd-media ( only ) , an nothing about data cd 's .	St
1.4.3	If ALL cd 's work and NO DVD 's work , it 's most likely a hardware issue .	St
1.4.4	Why are you so reluctant to accept that fact ?	Ques
1.4.5	Kees	St
1.5.1	I guess i am not understanding all the different media types ?	Ques
1.5.2	I am sorry Im getting this all wrong .	Polite
1.5.3	thanks for your help anyway	Polite
