hey guys need some help with organising a new computer system.
this is what i currently have (am leasing) sony vaio laptop, 2.66 p4, 512mb ram, 60 gig hd with 250gig external drive, external sony dvd-800u burner, 15&quot; lcd screen in the laptop.
i got it 2 years and 3 months ago, and its served me so well, minus a hard drive crash.
i will buy this one once the lease expires, and keep it for when im on the road.
the lease expires in november and i hope to get a new system then.
i want a high end system, willing to spend $3000 aud and source a monitor (looking at an apple 24&quot; cinema display).
im a graphic designer and want a system that can also do video editing with ease.
i need to be able to run photoshop, indesign, illustrator and have multiple windows open without a problem.
something my current laptop is now having trouble doing... can you guys recommend a system?
