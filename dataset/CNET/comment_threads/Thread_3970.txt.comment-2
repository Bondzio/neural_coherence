1) buy good quality components &quot;good quality&quot; doesn't mean the most expensive... just don't use the cheapest you can find.
you need quality RAM, mobo, power supply, and heat sink.
2) provide good cooling overclocking increases heat and heat kills components.
make sure your cpu heat sink is seated properly with a good themal paste.
make sure your case has good airflow and all of your fans are working properly.
3) learn from others!
there are a ton of sites that review mobos and ram and heatsinks and power supplies and many have overclocking guides.
you don't need to swim in uncharted waters!
