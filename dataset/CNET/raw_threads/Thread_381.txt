Here's the point to my question. A few days ago I was fooling around with my computer as I always do and got to wondering if I put a DVD+R in my CD burner if I could actually see the space on it. I can see the space on it but I haven't tried to burn anything yet. The burner that I have is a Lite-On LTR-48327S, the media that I have is a JVC 4.7GB DVD+R. My OS is Windows XP Home, and burning application is Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum. Any help you may be able to offer is greatly apreciated. Thanks, Sean.

I did seem to remember a software where you can burn dvd format on a cd; but that was when dvd discs were expensive. But now dvd discs and dvd burners are so reasonable..why should we be dealing with a cd period. Just my 2 cents.
