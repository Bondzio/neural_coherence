hi everyone, i have been given a toshiba satellite l30 - 101 lap top which i have been told if i can fix it i can keep it.
the laptop has a broken screen so every time it is switched on most of the screen is covered in black and all you can see is the surrounding parts.
what i would like to know is if there is any way that this can be fixed without replacing the screen?
i havn't managed to do anything other then connect it to an external monitor which is not practical for what i need it for and search online for a new screen, a new screen is very expensive so if i can fix it that would be amazing.
if anyone knows if this is possible it's you guys as you have helped me a lot over the past few months with other computer problems thanks all paul
