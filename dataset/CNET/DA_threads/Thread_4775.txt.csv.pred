1.1.1	Hi!	St
1.1.2	I'm just about to start ordering my parts to build a computer... and its going to be my first attempt at it.	St
1.1.3	One thing that puzzles me due to so many opinions is how much termal paste to apply to the CPU.	St
1.1.4	I'm definitely going to be using Artic Silver 5, the CPU will be an AMDAthlon64 X2 and the cooler fan will be a Zalman Flower.	St
1.1.5	As I understand it, to apply the paste I just place a seed sized blob on the cpu and let the pressure of the heatsink spread it around the cpu heat spreader.	St
1.1.6	In some instructions I have seen people covering the whole of the CPU case, where as most just have it spread over the area where the core is.	St
1.1.7	This is shown on the Artic Silver website... but only with older model chips.	St
1.1.8	As my CPU will be duel core, does that mean there are two cores inside the casing so it will be best to cover the whole of it?	St
1.1.9	or still just apply the paste to the central area?	St
1.2.1	You are correct about the heat spreader needing only a very small amount of grease at its center and allowing the sink pressure to spread it out on single core CPUs that have heat spreaders.	St
1.2.2	I would find a pictorial breakdown of the dual core CPU in question and determine the placement of the grease on it.	St
1.2.3	As long as you don't apply so much grease to the particular CPU that it oozes out of the sides and gets into circuitry I would not have trouble putting a very thin coat of grease covering the entire surface of the heat spreader if I were doing it.	St
1.2.4	One thing to look to is the original thermal material for the particular CPU.	St
1.2.5	Generally they have a thermal pad.	St
1.2.6	This thermal pad will be an indication of where to apply the grease if the grease maker doesn't provide precise details for a particular CPU.	St
1.3.1	http://www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_silver_instructions.htm	St
1.4.1	that the paste should be used for their &quot;lidded&quot; [their name for those they finally got around to putting a heat spreader on during manufacturing] CPU, and to use the Phase Change &quot;pad&quot; on the non lidded CPU's.	St
1.5.1	Something that escaped me that should have been obvious is the &quot;Heat spreader&quot;.	St
1.5.2	The heat from either a single core or dual core CPU will go to the heat spreader.	St
1.5.3	Going from the heat spreader to the heat sink would be the same for a dual core CPU as it would a single core CPU.	St
1.5.4	In other words, the instructions for applying grease to a heat spreader CPU is the same for a single or dual core CPU.	St
1.6.1	i prefer to use a plastic razor blade or the edge of a credit card to pre-spread the compound.	St
1.6.2	this is to make sure the entire die is covered and eliminate the chance of a hot-spot.	St
1.6.3	a small area with no compound is enough to kill a processor.	St
