i was thinking about installing a radeon x1600 pro 512mb pci express video card.
does anyone have this card or have first hand experience that knows how good the graphics are.
i want to be able to play games like rome total war and the upcoming medieval total war 2 on high settings.
or is there a better card that i should be looking at?
i am getting a 400 watt power supply, have a pentium 4 processor and not afraid of spending some money, if it gets me what i want.
-thanks
