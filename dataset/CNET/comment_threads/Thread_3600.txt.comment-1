I'm looking to upgrade my AMD processor but I am confused about what is compatible with this Motherboard.
Here is what I have: Compaq Presario SR1703WM Name AMD Sempron 3200+ Codename Palermo Specification AMD Sempron(tm) Processor 3200+ Package Socket 939 Chip set: Northbridge ATI Xpress 200 (RS480) rev.
10 Southbridge ATI SB400 rev.
00 Motherboard: Mainboard Model Amberine M (0x390 - 0x1DB08328) Can any point me in the right direction for a tool to help or recommend some AMD processors that I can use?
Thanks, Ken
