i have narrowed my desktop search down to 2 gateway computers.
the perfect one for my needs seems to be the sx2840.
it is a great computer for the price and performance you get.
but, since i have $600 in bestbuy gift cards and they do not carry this gateway model, i am having a hard time deciding what to do.
they do however carry the dx4831-01e for a great price.
both computers seem very similar (cnet gave the sx2840 slightly better reviews) so my question is, what is the main difference between these computers?
and am i going to be dissapointed with going with the dx instead of the sx???
any advice would be great.
thanks, chris
