greetings all.
i'm starting this topic because i have a baffling problem, and couldn't seem to find any answers around to get out of this fix.
here's the situation: i'm trying to network two WinXP machines through direct CAT-5 connection (not going through a router, that is), and somehow i can't seem to make them communicate with each other.
they're both on the same domain (169.254.11.x), and pinging doesn't work; now the odd thing is that i'm trying to do this in order to be able to share files between the two computers, and the computer names DO show up under the proper workgroup -- i just can't seem to do anything with them.
i'm really stumped... i turn to the experts for assistance.
