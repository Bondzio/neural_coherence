<s> Alright, my computer is a custom built PC from newegg, I will try to give my basic configuration and a synopsis of my problems: Gigabyte DS3 mo/bo 4x 1gb GSkill pc6400 EVGA 8800GTS 320mb vid card Intel e6400 cpu/ Zalman 9700 heatskink (h/d, soundcard, floppy, peripherals that arent needed -&gt;all currently removed) -Currently, when I turn my pc on everything (fans, lights) powers up, but there is no video signal. </s>
<s> -I tried using a different monitor, no luck. </s>
<s> I tried plugging my laptop into my monitor, works fine. </s>
<s> -I tried removing every peripheral except ram, cpu, fan, and video card. </s>
<s> No luck. </s>
<s> -I tried using only 1 stick of RAM (all 4 of them independently) and no luck. </s>
<s> -I tried bringing my pc to a friends house and tried my video card in his system, it works fine on his mo/bo. </s>
<s> I tried his video card in my system, but still no signal (it worked when we put it back in his as well) -I tried powering my friends pc up with my powersupply, worked fine. </s>
<s> -I tried pulling the CPU battery out and leaving it out over night, then putting it back in. </s>
<s> No luck. </s>
<s> -I receive no beeps when powering up. </s>
<s> So now I'm trying to limit my options of what could possibly be going wrong. </s>
<s> It seems like either the CPU or mo/bo is the problem from what I've found so far. </s>
<s> Two other things that seem strange: The reset button does not work when powered up (it used to before I had this video problem), and the CPU fan takes about 4 seconds to kick in (it used to start up before anything else). </s>
<s> I am really hoping I don't have to RMA my entire board, but any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated before I take that step. </s>
<s> Power supply. </s>
<s> Power Supply problems are going around today. </s>
<s> I can't help you further. </s>
<s> Be patient someone well come along shortly. </s>
<s> One last suggestion how's the connection? </s>
<s> Every thing plugged in OK? </s>
<s> I know you've been thorough but check again. </s>
<s> I should add the power supply is a XION PowerReal XON-600F14T-201 ATX12V 600W I can add the exact specs of my system if it might help. </s>
