microsoft seems to leave us with such bugs.
they tend to fix them when a computer maker like dell wants to sell a box with windows and the engineers get to work to find and patch the bug.
sorry but did you go looking in the kb (knowledge base) for your issue?
i did it once just as an example and now it's your turn.
