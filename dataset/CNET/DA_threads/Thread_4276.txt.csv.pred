1.1.1	I have a single level house with three laptops, two of which are Dell Inspirons and one of which is an IBM Thinkpad.	St
1.1.2	I need a recommendation for a router that is much more focused on range than speed.	St
1.1.3	The speed that comes out of the cable modem is fine for us, as we don't do many speed-intensive tasks.	St
1.1.4	Also, I would like it to be easy to set up, as I am fairly knowledgeable when it comes to techy stuff, but not programmer smart or anything.	St
1.1.5	Thanks Much!	St
1.2.1	consumer oriented routers from Linksys, D-Link, Netgear, etal, will do.	Ques
1.2.2	The only preference I would push is an 802.11G model vs a B model, the added speed is nice for LAN transfers.	St
1.3.1	i believe g routers also have greater speed	St
1.4.1	was just too easy.	St
1.4.2	I expected to learn a lot about networking (through trial and error), but each D-link component; cable modem, router, NICs, and wireless NICs all found each other, self configured, and it was done.	St
1.4.3	Well, maybe not that easy, I had to input some data and set up home networking on the PCs, but all in all, the D-link configuration was really a snap.	St
1.4.4	Just don't mix brands.	St
1.4.5	Good luck, Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.	St
1.4.6	Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections and data, and download free software.	St
1.5.1	Take a look at the Belkin Pre-N Router - I have it and it does very well on speed and range.	St
1.5.2	Not too cheap though.	St
1.5.3	Ben	St
1.6.1	I checked out this one, but it seems way too expensive.	St
1.6.2	I may go for the Parkervision vision.	St
1.7.1	Read my review.	St
1.7.2	I can't stand this thing, buying it was the worst money investment in my life.	St
