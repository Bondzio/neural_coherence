4126	0	97709	1114137	NR	Trach	4/10/05 3:17 PM	1.11314622E12	CD/DVD Drive Half Working	I got a brand new hp computer a few days ago and now my cd drive is not working. The official name for it is &quot;LightScribe DL 16X DVD +/-R/RW drive&quot;. It can play DVDs but it can't read instalation CDs, music CDs, or burned Cds. I thought it may be that it just wasn't clean but it can't even read one of those CDs you put in to clean the drive. So, anybody know what I can do?
