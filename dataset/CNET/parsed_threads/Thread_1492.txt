<s> I looking for a new video card capable of playing NWN2 and other newer games. </s>
<s> I'm not looking for a card with minimum specs but I'm not in the market of spending over $350 either. </s>
<s> Current PC specs: Area-51 PC, XP Home SP2, D945GNTLR MB, P4 3.4 GHZ CPU, 1 gig RAM, ATI Radeon X550 256MB graphics card. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> all prices for my suggestions are based on web shops like newegg.com or zipzoomfly.com. </s>
<s> all cards have 256mb. </s>
<s> the x1650pro and 7600gt can probably get by with a 350w power supply but the others will need 400w. </s>
<s> the x1900gt is a very good performer for $140. </s>
<s> it would be my top recommendation as it faster than a 7600gt but it is very long, runs somewhat hot, and needs a well ventilated case. </s>
