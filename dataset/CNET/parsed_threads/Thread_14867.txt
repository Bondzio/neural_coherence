<s> Support is critical now and as in the past. </s>
<s> However, while some users expect all support to come from the vendor as an endless supply should be wary as that has it plus and minus side. </s>
<s> Maker support is limited and in general resolves typical h/w and/or some s/w issues. </s>
<s> Don't expect them to cure all ills if you don't do some of the precautionary methods to help keep yourself from PC ills. </s>
<s> In other words, if the PC crashes, you're in for a long wait or haul to fix. </s>
<s> If you like, check out &quot;local shops&quot; that supply various levels of support. </s>
<s> These of course are outside any vendor support and costs extra. </s>
<s> Of course, you can use the typical vendor support until it expires and then move on. </s>
<s> I mention this as only in a &quot;business sense&quot; it pays for itself, if anything you should have a quicker response and/or help &quot;on-site&quot; to resolve troubles. </s>
<s> As for Apple vs. IBM, pick one you feel bests serves your purpose. </s>
<s> I can't quell on real evidence here, but overall I don't see Apple as leaps and bounds better than any IBM vendor, though I certainly don't like &quot;off shore support&quot; as that alone has caused many a frustration end-user for repair. </s>
