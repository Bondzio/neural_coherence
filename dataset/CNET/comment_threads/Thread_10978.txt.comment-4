It may remain as a pending print job from the originating PC and keep trying but this might tie up other print processes.
So, no, sending a print job to a sleeping PC isn't going to work.
It needs to be on and ready to act as a print server.
Again, a network type print server is another option but you need to check printer compatibility with these first.
If you put together a network and want to share printers, having the printers on the network via servers (external or internal) is really the best way to go.
BTW, you'd still need to have your printer turned on using the remote PC as a server and it would be consuming a small bit of power anyway.
