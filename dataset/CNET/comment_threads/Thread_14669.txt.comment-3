I apologize if I gave you the wrong idea, but the computers will all be used in the same location with the same monitor keyboard mouse and desk.
My point about them being in 3 different locations is simply that whatever solutions are proposed will have to be portable to be viable.
Not looking for vpn, remote acces, etc, just a simple switch that i can control 3 pcs with.
Right now I have my Mac hooked up to the LCD at home if I hit the 2 button on the KVM the display switches to my Win7 desktop machine, but I have to unplug the mouse &amp; keyboard and plug them into the desktop (therein lies the problem).
