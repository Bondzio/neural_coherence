<s> My Pavilion a1324m computer with an ECS 410-M motherboard has 1G of memory. </s>
<s> I installed another 1G chip in the second channel, DDR2 PC2-4200 533 mhzs as per the manufacturers specifications. </s>
<s> At boot-up the computer does not recognize the second chip and I am still stuck with 1G of memory. </s>
<s> Have I missed something or is there a solution. </s>

<s> If the sticks don't work then try other sticks. </s>
