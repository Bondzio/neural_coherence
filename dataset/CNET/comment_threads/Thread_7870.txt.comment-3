Well, none of the &quot;fixes&quot; had any effect.
I could have sworn connecting to this machine worked at one time.
Although none of the other machines have a recently used map to this machine.
I probably just need to reload anyway.
It's been a while.
I just hate getting everything back the way I want it.
It's such a pain.
I've been debating going to XP anyway.
But the thought of &quot;registering&quot; with MS galls me.
