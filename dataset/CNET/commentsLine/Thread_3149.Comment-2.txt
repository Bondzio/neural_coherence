1. are you sure that your computer is usb 2.0?
make sure that you have tried this whith every port on your pc.
your hard drive will work in usb 1.1 mode, but transfer speeds will be dramatically lower.
i'm not joking.
you will notice a huge difference with usb 2.0. it is possible that your computer is usb 2.0 compliant, but for some reason is in usb 1.1 mode.
if you are sure that your computer should be usb 2.0, but for some reason is not, then email me at ranguvar13@gmail.ocm, i may be able to help more.
2. why not run both hard drives together.?
you can do that.
you can keep your os on the 80gb one,a nd use the larger one for most of your data that won't fit on the old one.
''can they install a bigger hard drive say 250gb and transfer over all my stuff from the 80gb hard drive without causing any problems?''
do you mean transfer everything (as in, windows (or whatever you use), apps, games, utilities, etc.
), or do you mean just drag-and-drop data over?
either way, the answer is yes.
if you want to copy everything, though, you will need a drive-imaging app like symantec norton ghost.
that program will read all the data on your 80-gb hard drive into a single file, which can be then (with ghost or whatever) be uncompressed onto your new hard drive, resulting in a perfect copy of everything.
i hope i could help.
