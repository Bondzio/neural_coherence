When I plug it into a usb port of my Dell XPS M1210 machine (OS: Vista Home Premium), I was told the driver cannot be found. But when trying with XP and Linux, the driver can be installed automaticaly without a problem. Could anyone here give me some help on this issue, like where I can find the driver. Thanks
