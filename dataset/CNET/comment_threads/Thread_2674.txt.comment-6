Much else.
The video card found this &quot;The maximum power consumption of the card is rated at 110 watts.&quot; For now I'd dismiss the MHz issue as a red herring.
I've run into too many instances where the CPU clock speed is misread.
In other words, not a good indication of anything.
Since the FSB may play havoc with RAM and video cards and more, I wonder if it's off where it should be.
--&gt; But wait, I really want the BIOS to AUTO-DETECT all those MHz settings.
If not, it's just a bad BIOS (or motherboard if they don't issue a new BIOS.)
