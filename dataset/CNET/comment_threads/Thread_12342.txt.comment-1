I'm trying to get a USB mouse to work with a PS/2 to USB adapter, since my USB ports all fail to work, but it wont stay on.
My PS/2 mouse is dead so I've bought a cheap PS/2 to USB adapter off of Amazon and plugged my USB mouse into it.
Upon system boot, the mouse will turn on and then turn off after about two seconds.
There's nothing I can do to turn it back on and it's being to get me annoyed.
I know the mouse works fine since I just tried it on a netbook and it worked upon plug in.
Does anyone have advice to offer?
