<s> Hello, I have recently acquired a WesternDigital Caviar hard drive with an ADS USB enclosure. </s>
<s> After connecting the drive to the case, setting it to Master and plugging it into my USB2.0 port, Windows reports a USB Mass Storage Device, Disk Drive, and finally a WD313000 Caviar USB Device, which is displayed under &quot;Disk Drives&quot; in Device Manager. </s>
<s> Everything seems great but... there is no drive in &quot;My Computer&quot; to access it by. </s>
<s> After searching the problem I discovered there was also no entry in the Disk Manager (Computer Management). </s>
<s> The only place it shows up is Device Manager. </s>
<s> I have tried reinstalling the driver, unplugging the power source and/or USB cable and plugging them back in, rebooting, refreshing drive views, unplugging all IDE cables and plugging them back in... </s>
<s> The drive spins up and even shows activity occasionally, but there is virtually no way to access it. </s>
<s> I have searched this problem to the death for over 3 hours. </s>
<s> If someone has some idea what to do short of buying another HD, please help! </s>
<s> Regards, -- Snib </s>
<s> If not, what you describe is normal. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> ...that's what I'm trying to do. </s>
<s> But it doesn't show up in the disk manager tool, which is what formats it. </s>
<s> There was a disk manager but be sure you are in the right place as noted at http://www.theeldergeek.com/hard_drives.htm If the drive doesn't show up, then recheck your motherboard drivers and more things USB at http://www.usbman.com DON'T USE the front panel USB connections or try a few of them. </s>

<s> Same problem here with a 3.5'' Hard drive enclosure, using WinXPSP2 Home (with 1 gig DDSDRAM, AMD Athlon 2100, plenty of hard drive space), got drivers for the drive installed, however when I plug in the USB cable, both in one of the front slots or one of the back, I get an error that Windows cannot recognize one of my usb devices Neither Windows Explorer, nor Disk Manager show the drive. </s>
<s> Any other ideas out there...? </s>
