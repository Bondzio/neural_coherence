Everything has worked fine in burning my movies for months. Now suddenly when I try to burn, I get the msg &quot;illlegal disc&quot; &quot;could not perform start of disc-at-once&quot; I am using Ritek brand of discs and they have worked fine for me for a long time. The support group at Nero has been no help. I am desperate so if someone could pls make a suggestion!! thanks in advance Virgil Hummel
