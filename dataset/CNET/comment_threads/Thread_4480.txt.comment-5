Inside your case, on the mainboard, you will notice several slots that are white, and one that is brown, the brown slot being above the white slots.
The brown slot is your AGP slot.
This is where you want to install your AGP graphics card.
Go to a site such as Newegg, and search Video Cards -&gt; AGP X4/X8.
Although you're mainboard will only produce X4 AGP speeds, installing a card that supports X8 is okay.
Is this a custom built PC, or an OEM bought from Dell, HP, eMachines, etc.
