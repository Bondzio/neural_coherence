i just switched from 98se to xp-pro and i'm having trouble setting up my visioneer 7600 parallel port scanner.
i'm using paperport 8 and the software seems to work but the driver doesn't seem to work correctly.
first: i have a p4, xp-pro, 256mb ram and two hard drives.
i tried the compatibility wizard and the program just crashed.
without the compatibility mode the program works with older scans completely but when i try to scan or preview an image the program does some funny things.
it will start the scan and never quit making multiple copies of the image and i can't close the scan window.
is anyone running this setup?
do i have to upgrade (buy new) my scanner?
thanks in advance, denny
