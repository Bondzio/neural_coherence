ok. ok. the parts are old but that half the fun getting them to work again.
ive tried the hd on several pc's with the same result.
i have tried 9 different cables, the jumper is on the master setting and still no luck.
i may end up buying a new hd, i dont want to because this is just a little project i have to save an aunt from a windows 95 machine!
that thing is old.
