1.2.1	You need to DEFINE what a &quot;commercial DVD&quot; is.	St
1.2.2	I'm guessing you mean the SILVER CDs or DVDs that you buy with music or video content.	St
1.2.3	If so, then you may want to know that such are not &quot;burned&quot; but are &quot;pressed&quot;.	St
1.2.4	Does that help?	St
1.2.5	As to the Mad Dog.	St
1.2.6	It's a value unit that should last a year or two but isn't very expensive.	St

1.4.1	I use DVDSHRINK to copy DVDs since it makes it so easy.	St
