<s> Some possible questions; A laptop running on AC power [XP} gets normal shutdown. </s>
<s> It's modem is connected to a satllite modem. </s>
<s> It still has a charged battery in it. </s>
<s> I know nothing about laptops, but I know how ATX power works. </s>
<s> The question is whether or not the laptop power is like an ATX computer and the Standby power line from the power supply stays on. </s>
<s> If it does stay on, then it seems that to protect more surely one should disconnect from the satellite modem. </s>
<s> I don't come back here too often, but I never fail to get the correct answers from these great posters. </s>
<s> Thanx Ray Harinec </s>
<s> Power surge? </s>
<s> Energy drain by modem? </s>
<s> How is a laptop intruded when it's not booted up? </s>
<s> Only when the OS is running is there a possibility of compromise. </s>
<s> An ATX PS does keep a control voltage on the PC that can be used for wake-on-lan, wake-on-ring devices. </s>
<s> So, theoretically, someone could send a wake up signal (magic packet) to a network card to wake the laptop if the laptop was hard wired to the network. </s>
<s> As well, if the laptop had a telephone type modem that supported wake-on-ring, it could be started remotely. </s>
<s> Once the OS was running, the laptop could be hijacked but not beforehand. </s>
<s> At some point Norton [no idea what version] reported an intrusion attempt. </s>
<s> It is not clear to me exactly when the report occurred. </s>
<s> I can't discuss it directly with the person whose computer had the report, as to what was being done at the time. </s>
<s> He apparently has something going on in his life that causes him to suspect that omeone may e trying to hak into his omputer. </s>
<s> My real inrest is whether such things as wake on LAN etc can work in a laptop, thus the ATX type power question. </s>
<s> Also thus I would advise him to unplug his satellite modem whenever he is not using the computer. </s>
<s> I think that Steven Haninger answered me. </s>
<s> to see if any &quot;wake on&quot; is enabled. </s>
<s> If one is, can the wake on turn the computer on boot up, intrude and then return the system to the OFF [standby power] mode? </s>
<s> Theoretically, yes. </s>
<s> But, the intrusion would need to include a program that would take control of your desktop and allow a shutdown command such as can be done if remote desktop is enabled. </s>
<s> Evidence of someone booting and shutting down your system would be found in the event log by noting the times/dates in the system area. </s>
<s> You would know by looking there. </s>
<s> However I believe that I can arrive at the answer. </s>
<s> The question was simply does a laptop have a power system similiar to an ATX tower, thus always a standby voltage? </s>
<s> I now realize that it could not have such. </s>
<s> It seems that if it did and the battery slowly reuced it's voltage the standby source would get into a never never region, where digital logic would do many unplanned events flicking back and forth it's ones and zeros. </s>
<s> &quot;The question was simply does a laptop have a power system similiar to an ATX tower, thus always a standby voltage?&quot; I can't see how this can be answered with the laptop designs being so varied. </s>
<s> I will answer YES on my newest HP dv6910us since you can turn it off and on via a small IR remote control. </s>
<s> To do that, some circuit has to be energized. </s>
