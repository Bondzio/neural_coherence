&quot;as i understand it, the pc is the internet gateway for the laptop&quot; sorry no, that is very unusual today.
today we just need the simple setup of... modem to router (with wifi?)
to pcs.
if you have done anything else it will cost you dearly to get it supported and i can't help since it's too far out for me to discuss at length.
let's focus on &quot;how come the laptop can access the pc but not the other way round?&quot; that's proper for many reasons.
but since you may not want to learn all about accounts, permissions and more why not use  's free offering to get it working?
