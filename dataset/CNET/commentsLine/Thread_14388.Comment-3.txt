i had a similar problem.
here is my own threat, it might help you some way.
a: basically, on your xp desktop you want to enable printer sharing by right clicking on the printer that is connected to the computer and that one that works.
go to properties, sharing tab, enable sharing of this printer.
make sure you remember the name of the printer being shared for later on.
b: make sure the router allows printer sharing.
also, on your vista laptop, enable printer sharing by going to control panel &gt; network and sharing center.
enable printer sharing or follow the steps to enable it.
on your vista laptop, 1. go to control panel &gt; printers.
2. add a printer 3. add local printer 3. new port &gt; leave the port type as default( local port ) 4. the port name should be as follows: \\computername\printer name the computer name can be found when you search for computers/devices in your network.
( start &gt; network ) the printer name should be the same as in step a above.
hope this help at all.
