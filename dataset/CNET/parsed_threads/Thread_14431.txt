<s> I just bought a CD RW external drive to back up my files. </s>
<s> It also comes with an audio cable to plug into my computer (a left-right plug for the external drive's output that converges to a single jack for inputting into the PC's sound card). </s>
<s> My dumb question is which of the 3 slots on the sound card does the single plug go into? </s>
<s> There is a speaker plug, a mic plug and a line out plug. </s>
<s> I doubt it goes into the Mic plug but I can see either of the others being appropriate. </s>
<s> This is not a big deal as my pc has a read-only drive that works just fine and I don't currently need to use the external drive for playing anything, but I'd still like to know (and the direction book fails to tell me). </s>
<s> Seems odd. </s>
<s> Normally sound cards on Desktops will have a Mic in, Line in and Line out. </s>
<s> It may also have a Speaker out in addition. </s>
<s> Laptops may not have a Line IN. </s>
<s> In your case, it must be LINE IN and not LINE OUT. </s>
<s> Please confirm. </s>
<s> The CDRW audio cable goes in to the Line IN socket. </s>
<s> Please post a feedback. </s>
<s> Yes this for audio playback. </s>
<s> If you have a newer PC the line input is the blue one. </s>
<s> If you have an older PC you will have to look at the book that came with the PC. </s>
