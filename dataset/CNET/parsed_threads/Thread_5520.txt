<s> Hello all, I have the ThermalTake 760i BIgWater cooling system on my PC, and have been keeping an eye on operating temps recently. </s>
<s> In an air-conditioned room, it seems to idle around 46C, and under high load can get into the high 60'sC. </s>
<s> This seems a bit high to me compared to what other people with liquid cooling, some even with high-perf. </s>
<s> fans, have been reporting. </s>
<s> Does this sound like an indication of a failing/failed pump to anyone? </s>
<s> It won't do any good to compare if the systems are different in any way. </s>
<s> Also, that includes the s/w load and/or pgms. </s>
<s> being run on a constant basis. </s>
<s> About the only thing you can do is verify the overall install of the cooling apparatus is done proper. </s>
<s> The cooling temps offered are still a local PC(inside) measurement and can vary. </s>
<s> On top of all this the general PC make-up can provide for better cooling to include wire harness(tidiness), cards installed, mtrbd. </s>
<s> bios updates, location of PSU, ram types(cooling fins), and even the drives installed(multiple). </s>
<s> If the PC works on a steady platform for whatever use, isn't the cooling good enough? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I agree...pretty warm for idle with a decent HS Fan. </s>
<s> Have you double checked the installation or contacted the mfg tech support for suggestions ? </s>
<s> Sure the temp device is accurate and working OK ? </s>
<s> I'm running an i860 with a Xigmatec HS Fan...at idle it's 30c or less at at load it barely reaches 50c. </s>
<s> Ambient temp is 73f. </s>

<s> To answer your question; a little more information is needed, as to what your system specs are, and how long you've been using the Big Water system. </s>
<s> With these specifics, then we can answer your question a little easier. </s>
<s> I've seen over the last couple of years; that the Big Water system didn't get many great reviews, seems people found that it cool any better than a high performance air cooler (many found that the pump was made too cheaply and it did tend to fail) I found an older review of the Big Water system http://www.legitreviews.com/article/680/7/ &lt;i&gt;&quot; What the test shows is that yes, it can fit in a mid tower, but you will have to play with the arrangement in the case so the radiator gets a good source of air in order to be an effective cooler. </s>
<s> If you are gathering parts for a new build I would look at a full tower over a mid. </s>
<s> If you choose to go the mid tower route you are going to want a blow hole. </s>
<s> &quot;&lt;/i&gt; Another question...when was the last time you cleaned and flushed the system out; meaning take all the tubing, the waterblock, the radiator/ pump flush with distilled water, then refill with new coolant (watercooling a vehicle and a computer is not as different as people think, but all systems need a good flushing/ refilling once a year or so). </s>
<s> Hi there, im having the same problem. </s>
<s> Im new to using watercooling components. </s>
<s> I've bought the set from a friend of mine for a very low price. </s>
<s> Here is my setup: Gigabyte GA EP45-DS3P Intel q9550 45nm rev E0 @ 3.7 ghz @ 1.3v 4x2gb OCZ Gold (2x2gb set) @ 1.9v Coolermaster Silent pro 700W Thermaltake 760i (i've re-routed the thermaltake setup for optimal cooling. </s>
<s> The pump has been connected to the rad (has been placed on the bottom of my case), the rad to the proc, proc to the res and then to the pump. </s>
<s> (Pump and res in my 5,25 bay). </s>
<s> I've even placed my fan of the scythe mugen II proc cooler for pull on other side of rad. </s>
<s> Idle 33-38c Load 58-71c Can't push my system further because i dont want to reach such high temps. </s>
<s> How can i flush my system with water? </s>
<s> Is it possible that the cooling block is stuffed with dirt of some kind? </s>
<s> He said he wasn't using it for 6 months to a year now. </s>
<s> Ive blown on the ends of the waterblock to get it cleared before ive installed it. </s>
<s> Ive replaced it with new cooling fluid (feser one). </s>
<s> Maybe you guys can help? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> The last time I saw something like this the owner was adamant that heat sink compound was optional because of how well the surfaces mated. </s>
<s> We had to let them pack it up and go. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Your suggesting that i dont use cooling paste? </s>
<s> I Dont understand. </s>
<s> pls explain. </s>
<s> I am adding to the discussion in hopes you will give more details. </s>
<s> Something seems amiss so small details might have folk write &quot;try this!&quot; Bob </s>
