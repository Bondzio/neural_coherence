Bob, thanks for your feedback.
I agree it should work but if I seem skepticale its because I have read otherwise.
There has been some talk about a glitch with ghost that prevents boot up or log on with the mirrored drive.
Something about windows not reconizing the drive letters now that the slave is a master in a different computer.
I guess I will just have to try it to see if it works.
BTW can some one recommend an alternative to ghost.
It does not seem get high marks by all.
I will post my findings If anyone is interest.
Thanks
