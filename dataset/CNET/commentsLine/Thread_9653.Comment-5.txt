yeah, i did switch over to wpa security.
i was originally using wep and had many many problems.
wpa has definitely helped in that aspect of it.
hopefully is stays up and running for me.
do you all suggest that i go and get a new router to take advantage of the &quot;n&quot; speeds, or should i just wait for &quot;n&quot; to be ratified?
