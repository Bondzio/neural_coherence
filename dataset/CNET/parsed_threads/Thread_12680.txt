<s> I was wondering if I am doing something wrong. </s>
<s> I am connecting my Cyber Home CH-DVD 300 via component video out, into a monitor with a vga only input. </s>
<s> The cable I am using is The HDTV RGB/15 pin to 3 rca Component video cable. </s>
<s> There also is a Male vga to 2 female vga &quot;splitter&quot; that is connected to the monitor. </s>
<s> i am running audio out rca and i can hear the program just fine, i just can't see it. </s>
<s> My computer is connected to the other side of the splitter and it works just fine, however when i have both the computer connected and turned on, and the dvd player there seems to be a signal interruption, which is leading me to believe I can make this work. </s>
<s> The other part of this equation is that on the vga side of the component cable, there is a pin in the middle that is missing. </s>
<s> I hope someone can help me. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> my motto has always been...why look for trouble when there ain't none? </s>
<s> You have component out. </s>
<s> What input connection/s do you have on the TV? </s>
<s> vga is the only input, if i had multiple inputs i would try them. </s>
<s> oh well. </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> let me know your thoughts. </s>
<s> what you are trying to do. </s>
<s> My suggestion is to watch dvd/video through the computer or just plug and unplug your source. </s>
<s> My guess is that your Y-method of connection is not going to work. </s>
<s> A switching box might work better but I don't know if they sell such device though. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> the reason I am trying to do this is so i can give my computer a rest. </s>
<s> i run a video editing software quite a few hours a day and i'd like to give my computer a rest, if possible. </s>
<s> one of the pins of the component to vga cable was broken off. </s>
<s> i ordered a new cable, it should be here within the next day or two, i'll let you know if it works, if you even care, haha. </s>
<s> thanks again for all the help! </s>
<s> have a good one. </s>
<s> At first I thought you were having some digital to analog problem. </s>
<s> But I don't really think that is the problem. </s>
<s> I read the HTPC forums on the net, and I imagine the computer just won't accept the signal. </s>
<s> You will see on amazon.com that many people buy wires trying different task you would think will work, but then they don't. </s>
<s> Lots of the converter adaptors and wires have low ratings because of this fact. </s>
<s> they usually convert one way only. </s>
<s> Many times displays just don't accept the signal because of some silly reason that takes a degree to understand. </s>
<s> try amazon.com or avsforums and you might find the answer faster. </s>
<s> I had the same problem too, and I'm using a CyberHome CH-DVD 300 DVD player as well. </s>
<s> I've used it fine with older tvs using a yellow jack composite cable with audio cables, so I didn't think it was the player. </s>
<s> BUT IT IS! </s>
<s> The trick is that this model dvd player is factory set so that it only recognizes S-Video outputs without considering other good connections! </s>
<s> You need to go into the SETUP menu to change it out. </s>
<s> On the remote, press the SETUP button (top row, third button) to access the menu. </s>
<s> Then move the arrow to the right to choose the VIDEO option and press ENTER. </s>
<s> Then move the arrows to the VIDEO OUTPUT option and choose the YCbCr option! </s>
<s> If the original poster is still experiencing the problem, try this solution! </s>
<s> I racked my brain trying to figure out what was wrong and only came across this solution after looking at troubleshooting for the player itself. </s>
<s> Reviewers at Epinions have noted similiar problems and this solution working for them. </s>
