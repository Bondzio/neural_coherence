1.1.1	I 'm not very computer literate , and I just wanted to buy some network cables .	St
1.1.2	I wanted to know what the difference between CAT5 and CAT6 cables are .	St
1.1.3	They look the same to me .	St
1.2.1	they are 2 different categories of cables .	St
1.2.2	Cat6 has double the bandwidth of cat5 which boils down to a little more reliability .	St
1.2.3	You can use either cables with your computer .	St
1.2.4	I would recommend cat6 as applications are getting larger and the added bandwidth of a cat6 will accommedate better .	St
1.2.5	Some good quality cheap cables can be found at www.tendonusa.com .	St
1.2.6	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	They are wired the same , they appear , on the outside , to be the same .	St
1.3.2	but Cat6 has better shielding , and perhaps better insulation .	St
1.3.3	If you are needing something for short runs , like just a few feet , then either cable will work fine , but if you are needing something that is going to go further , or near high radio-noise inducing areas , like near actual transmitting radios , or power lines , then if you have 1Gb ( Gigabit ) devices ( on both ends ) minimize the possible noise conflict and get Cat6 cables .	St
1.4.1	There is no shielding with UTP , or & quot ; unshielded twisted pair & quot ; Ethernet cables and STP or & quot ; shielded twisted pair & quot ; is rarely ever used .	St
1.4.2	For commercial applications , Cat.6 which is capable of speeds up to 10 Gig , is installed to accomodate future equipment upgrades and technology advances .	St
1.4.3	For the small office/home office user , Cat.5 UTP 's rating of 100Mbps is sufficient at a more attractive price .	St
1.5.1	What do you want to do , quibble about something that is really unimportant to the original question ?	Ques
1.5.2	Yes , I know that the one idea of shielding , where it is grounded , does not actually apply to the 8 wires , 4 twisted pairs of wires , in the Ethernet wiring called Cat5 , Cat5e or even Cat6 .	St
1.5.3	But there is a sheath , and it is generally constructed of aluminum foil , that is what some people call shielding .	St
1.5.4	You even said & quot ; 'shielded twisted pair ' is rarely ever used & quot ; Rarely ?	Ques
1.5.5	so then it does happen ?	Ques
1.5.6	If you look up , on Wikipedia ( granted , a collection of many people 's input , but that is what makes it knowledge more well rounded , and not just one persons opinion ) you 'll read that & quot ; Many such cables are unshielded but some are shielded . & quot ; The person who started this thread just wanted to know the what the difference between CAT5 and CAT6 cables are , since they look the same .	St
1.5.7	I think I answered the question well enough to show swarm567 that the appearance is the same .	St
1.5.8	It is unlikely he 'll ever construct any of the cables himself .	St
1.5.9	I even recommended that , depending upon the circumstance ( and I gave examples ) , the Cat5 cable will probably work fine for him .	St
1.5.10	As for saying Ethernet cable is not shielded , is wrong .	St
1.5.11	You are thinking only twisted pair .	St
1.5.12	The original Ethernet cable , as designed by Xerox ( where I was employed from 1970 to 2004 ) was not only shielded , but it was double-shielded .	St
1.5.13	It was very thick ( some called it & quot ; thicknet & quot ; ) , about a half inch , co-ax cable ; and required special tapping devices to get past the double shield ( some people called them & quot ; vampire taps & quot ; ) to connect the transceiver boxes ( I am so glad nobody uses that stuff anymore - except maybe masochists ) .	St
1.5.14	I 'm sorry for using a word that you felt the need to correct me .	St
1.5.15	Perhaps what you added was useful for swarm567 , but I do n't think so .	St
