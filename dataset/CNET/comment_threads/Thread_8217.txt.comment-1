Western Digital SATA Hard Drive - 640GB Vista Home Premium - 64Bit Gateway desktop.
Would someone know of any utility or method to restore a SATA hard drive's factory full capacity size?
During partitioning my drive, it went from 595GB (640GB Drive) to only 32GB.
Since it is a 64-Bit system, I can't find a utility to restore the drive's full capacity.
