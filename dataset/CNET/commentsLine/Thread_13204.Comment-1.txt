not sure if my power supply just over heated.
i was on world of warcraft and all of a sudden my computer immediately shut down.
i tried turning it back on but when i hit the power button, only the fans would turn on for half a second.
i tried blowing the dust out with an air compresser but that did nothing.
i have tried a new power cord and a different outlet but nothing seemed to make a difference.
the fans will turn on for .5-2 seconds then shut down again.
later i the computer turned itself on and the fans were running for a few seconds then i heard a pop and i could smell something burning.
so i pulled the power out and haven't touched it since.
my specs are as follows: 420 watt ps msi k8n neo2 platinum mobo geforce 6800gt 512x2 mushkin black pc 3200 ram amd 64 3000+ 200 gb hard drive i'm worried that my powersupply may have over heated, i only have 2 case fans that were stock with the case.
anyone have any ideas on whats happening?
oh and hello all!
