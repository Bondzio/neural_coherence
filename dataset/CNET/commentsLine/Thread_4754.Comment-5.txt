same version, the 10n, as a new eide on amazon for $50 from panasonic which claims to be oem brand.
there are 3 model types and two connectivity standards for the exact same model.
i understand oem can be several different companies due to supply chain issues.
it's the 2 connectivity standards that claim to be original for the exact same model i question.
any thanks, i know mercury.
they are quality.
just twice the price.
thanks, cheers!
