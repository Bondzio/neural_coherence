<s> I decided to tidy up my house by providing rj45 sockets in each room with a desktop. </s>
<s> After setting up all the rj45 wall sockets, I connected them to a small switch and then the adsl router/modem. </s>
<s> Thats where my nightmare begun. </s>
<s> The desktops shows no sign when connected to the rj45 wall sockets but can connect when directly hooked up to the switch. </s>
<s> I have tried redoing the wiring on the rj45 wall sockets but it doesn't help. </s>
<s> This thing is driving me nuts. </s>
<s> Help me out guys before I loose my mind over this Cheers </s>
<s> Link please with pictures. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I used 568A wiring scheme. </s>
<s> I got the idea from this site http://www.lanshack.com/cat5e-tutorial.aspx </s>
<s> I used cat 6 cables and the standard rj45 sockets with rj45 jacks at the ends to plug into the switch. </s>
<s> I used the brown, brown white, yellow, blue white, blue, yellow white, green, green white scheme. </s>
<s> Hope that is informative enough. </s>
<s> it really sounds as though your have miswired, consistently. </s>
<s> On the RJ45 sockets, all should be fine if you followed the color codes printed on the connector. </s>
<s> However, at the other end you have RJ45 plugs and these are easier to mess up. </s>
<s> The color order for 586A is as follows: Green/White-Green, Orange/White-Blue, Blue/White-Orange, Brown/White-Brown. </s>
<s> There is no Yellow in the cable! </s>
<s> Flatten out the cable in that order. </s>
<s> The RJ45 Plug clip must be facing down. </s>
<s> Push the cables in and crimp. </s>
<s> Do one cable and then test. </s>
<s> Let us know how you get on P </s>
<s> What you'd want to do is go from the wall sockets to a patch panel and following the proper wiring scheme. </s>
<s> Generally, I use and see most often is the &quot;B&quot; scheme...and it needs to be the same on both ends of the cable. </s>
<s> When you buy standard patch cables, they are almost always made in this fashion. </s>
<s> A crossover cable is simply a &quot;B&quot; at one end and an &quot;A&quot; at the other. </s>
<s> My guess is that you've got this crossed at some point and can possibly verify this by using a crossover cable from your PC to one of your &quot;dead&quot; wall outlets. </s>
<s> If it works with a crossover cable, something got wired backwards. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> A proper crimper, cutter and an impact type punch down tool. </s>
<s> If making patch cables with the male plugs, always square off the wiring ends before inserting them into the plugs or some may not seat fully. </s>
<s> Before crimping, look at terminal end of the wiring inside of the plug and count all 8 copper ends to make sure they're fully seated. </s>
<s> over repetitive given the other answers you have already received. </s>
<s> Life is simpler when you go from socket to socket (or patch panel) for wall wiring. </s>
<s> RJ45 receptacles are easy to connect to the wires. </s>
<s> OTOH RJ45 plugs and crimping are a b**** to deal with, so use ready made patch cords from wall to switch and the PC. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Sorry but if it fails, it's broken wires, staples through the cable or the color to what pins are still wrong. </s>
