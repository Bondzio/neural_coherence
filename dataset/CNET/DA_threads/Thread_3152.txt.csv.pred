1.1.1	HI I am having some problems with my new Adesso optical mouse.	St
1.1.2	I am using an AMD Athlon xp 2400 cpu with 256 ram and Win 98 Se.	St
1.1.3	Sometimes it will freeze up the pc and I will reboot and all is ok. Also, sometimes when I start up a new session I get a little window that says there is no mouse detected/attached.	St
1.1.4	When I reboot all is ok again.	St
1.1.5	There was no driver with this mouse, or from the website.	St
1.1.6	I just installed it using Window's add new hardware utility.	St
1.1.7	I have repeated this installation and I still have these problems.	St
1.1.8	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Unless the mouse has fancy bells and whistles, there's no need to install it.	St
1.2.2	That's why there was no software with it.	St
1.2.3	I just plugged mine in to both my XP machines, not even rebooting.	St
1.2.4	If you're able to uninstall it, do so then reboot.	St
1.2.5	XP will find it and all should be ok.	St
