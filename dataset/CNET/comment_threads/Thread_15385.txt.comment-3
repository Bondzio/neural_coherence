Thanks Bob.
Done the cables, done fresh floppys.
Took an ME hard disk out of another PC which booted up fine.
Put the maxtor into another PC and still would not boot.
Did a sys c: with the maxtor in the other PC.
Replaced in the celeron.
Will now boot but only to C: prompt.
I'm not worried about loosing info on the HD but why wont the floppy boot?
Dave
