i have uac completely disabled because it's annoying, and when i try to install the update it gives the error message i copied into my last response.
any insight on why that would happen?
since i downloaded the 945gm express chipset update, and that's the chipset i have, i don't know why it's giving me that error message.
but i agree that's probably it.
thanks for the help again
