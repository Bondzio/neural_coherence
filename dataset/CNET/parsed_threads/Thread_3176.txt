<s> I'm trying to download Smart Script Gold (U.S VERSION) and It tells me I have to buy winzip (30 bucks I don't have at the moment.) </s>
<s> Is there any way I can get winzip for free or is there any other way I can download this program completly free ? </s>
<s> Thanx </s>
<s> Winzip will demo run indefinitely so far. </s>
<s> And is a free demo. </s>
<s> Since I don't feel right about that, I use TUGZIP. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> well it work on this particular program because when I go to run the program it says that &quot;WinZip Self-Extractor.&quot; It's not giving me the option to open it. </s>
<s> Just the options to unzip or close and when I click unzip it's says &quot;winzip is not found on you computer.&quot; Do you think I'll just have to go head and cough up the money for winzip or what ? </s>
<s> Thanx </s>
<s> Just install the Winzip freebie. </s>
