The PC previously was on a network and had internet access through the NIC. Presently it is a stand alone unit and we were attempting to gain internet access (AOL) via the modem. I could not even get Windows to acknowledge that the PC had a modem. I purchased a new one (internal card), installed it, and now Windows sees it but I get a port error message - can't open port when attempting to use it. I have tried the modem in two different slots (com2 and com3), but get the port message in both instances. The com2 port/slot was where the original modem was. How can I determine what might be conflicting with the new modem on these ports / slots? What can I do to get around this?

One thing that gets many is that the DIAL UP CONNECTOID (Hint, use google.com for that word) may need to be deleted and recreated. But that's a software issue you can take up in the OS Forum. As to COM 2, you'll want an ISA card set to IRQ 3 and any other serial port at this address disabled. I don't suggest COM3 or 4. Bob

I don't have your modem manual so I can only use the general statements. ISA will be very tough on end users. Many to the point of getting a new machine. Bob
