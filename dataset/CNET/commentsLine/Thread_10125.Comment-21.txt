&gt;&gt; use system away from floor or place higher/elevate from floor &lt;&lt; i have a small 14&quot; tower (and cable modem) that is sitting on a plastic, milk crate like stand.
besides keeping the computer off the floor, it raises its top to desktop level and i use the top for my mousepad.
i have the opening of the stand facing the front of the computer so i can turn on / off my surge suppressor which is inside the stand.
the holes in the back of the stand keep all the ac / coax / telephone / ethernet cables going to my surge suppresor from getting tangled.
you can buy this type of stand at most office supply places as it is actually a hanging file folder holder.
