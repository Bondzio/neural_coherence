<s> Ok guys and gals, put on your thinkin' caps. </s>
<s> I'm having to dive into a project that's bigger than my experience. </s>
<s> I know I could go to a local integrator but, for cost reasons (there will be no revenue return), I need to pull this off myself. </s>
<s> I've built and managed many networks, cabled and wireless, but nothing this large nor with the type of equipment that I think I need. </s>
<s> We want to provide free wifi over about an eight-acre area that is partially enclosed (it's a large flea market). </s>
<s> The building construction is mostly steel so I'm anticipating considerable interference and therefore will probably need a considerable number of &quot;hot spots&quot;. </s>
<s> We'll be sharing (at first) a single 5-Mbps DSL line devoted strictly to the hot spots. </s>
<s> Equipment will be under cover although the environment could be somewhat hostile (heat, dust, humidity, etc. </s>
<s> ), so I'm wondering if I need to work with APs, etc. </s>
<s> designed for outdoor use which, of course, are considerably more expensive. </s>
<s> My other networking experience tells me that I need at least a router/gateway, possibly a switch, and some APs (around 6-8). </s>
<s> My problem is that I'm not sure what might be the most economical (but still functional) way to configure the equipment. </s>
<s> If I have to run cable from my router and/or switch to the APs, my segment lengths will exceed specs. </s>
<s> So, I've considered the idea of adding phone outlets in various locations that would serve up the DSL to the extremities. </s>
<s> I'd then use additional routers from those locations and run cable and hang APs from there. </s>
<s> Trouble is, I don't even know if the nature of a DSL signal will allow such a configuration. </s>
<s> Of course, I've also wondered if there are devices out there that would make it possible to eliminate the need for cable while maintaining acceptable signal strength, etc. </s>
<s> So, here's the short version... How would you do it? </s>
<s> I'll be happy to fill in the blanks for whatever I've left out. </s>
<s> Thanks so much for sharing! </s>

<s> It is the WAB-3000, this is a wireless outdoor mesh. </s>
<s> In your situation you would need a DSL Modem/Router, which then connects via Cat5/6 to the WAB. </s>
<s> For product information go to: global.level1.com/products2.php?Id=929&PC1thId=8 Or contact the distributor above. </s>
<s> We make use of these units extensively in Australia, for dispersed security camera setups, and for exactly the type of large area wifi you are trying to setup. </s>
<s> Good luck with the project (even if you don't go with our product!) </s>
<s> Thanks very much for the info. </s>
<s> I'll be checking it out today. </s>
