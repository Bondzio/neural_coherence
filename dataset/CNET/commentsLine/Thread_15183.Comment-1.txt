my hp psc 2410 is on it's last legs.
it makes grinding noises at startup.
i've been to the hp website, chatted with the tech on-line and i refuse to send it in for servicing.
not worth the money.
the bottom line is i'm looking for a reliable printer.
i don't want an hp.
i no longer need the scan or fax capability.
color or just b&w would be fine.
suggestions welcomed....
