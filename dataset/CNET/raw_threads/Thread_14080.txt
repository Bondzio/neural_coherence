I have a telus wireless gateway with a laptop connnected wireless.. At the other end of the house, I have 2 more pc's, 1 is connected with a wireless adapter. ,The third doesn't have wireless capibilities. The way the building is laid out, running an ethernet cable is not an option. I'm talking down a flight of stairs , through three rooms and the garage, up another flight of stairs etc.Running it externally wouldn't be much better. I understand i should simply go buy a wireless adapter for the third pc but I'm completely tapped, unemployed, disabled and waiting till the 17th for my second hip replacement. I do have a dlink wireless router(dsl604+) aswell as the wireless gateway. My question is , Is it possible to make a wireless connection between the gateway and router (both are wireless) and then use an ethernet between the router and the third pc?? It's my wifes computer. We moved 3 months ago and I feel just horrible not having her connected yet as she does alot of online gaming and socializing to relax after work. If not , what would be a good way to connect her pc to my pc with a cable and share my wireless internet connection?? Both pc's are runing xphome edition sp3. I also have a DSLcable router This would mean having 2 network connections on my pc, one wireless to the gateway, and an ethernet to the cable router/her pc. I'm not sure if this is possible and please excuse my ignorance. Again ,thanks in advance for any help/suggestions/ideas/tips/enlightenment,etc. Haggardag
