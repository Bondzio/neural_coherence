<s> - Maxtor 80 gig 3100 PS - have had for about 8months - used about 70 gig of space - it stopped allowing me to access the data - the drive registered that the space was used, and some files were visible, but most folders showed as empty. </s>
<s> - I have just set-up a 300gig Maxtor OneTouch II, and managed to move almost all of my data off of the 3100 PS. </s>
<s> - The last folder to copy is the biggest and consists of MP3s and AIFF files. </s>
<s> I am still having trouble moving or even getting the drive to recognize the contents of this folder. </s>
<s> - When I woke up this morning the drive was making a loud noise and the orange read light is solid. </s>
<s> - I can no longer get the drive to mount. </s>
<s> - When I unplug the power for 10 secs and the USB cable for 10 secs, then replug in same sequence, there is a beeping noise that happens about 3x, then the read light goes solid, the humming noise begins, and I cannot get the drive to mount. </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> I have a feeling I'm going to have to unplug/replug and a stroke of luck one day will allow me to access my files.......boo. </s>
<s> Thanks to whoever reads and responds! </s>
