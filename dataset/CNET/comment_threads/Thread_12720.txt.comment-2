Provided the ps falls into the same specs as the old HP one did, there shouldn't be a problem.
The issue on this forum that users had were bad &quot;inverters&quot; located within the LCD itself, not the ps.
The inverter had poor manufacture or componets so they got whacked.
the reply of that same monitor also provided links to fixes and repairs that could be made or at least point to the problem area.
This needs some disassembly so if you're not capable, then find a good repair center/shop.
That $20 LCD may not be a bargain after all.
