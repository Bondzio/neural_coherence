i have been using my samsung 40gb hard disk series mp0402h as my portable hard disk for about 1-2 years.
last night, my portable hard disk just died on me!
the casing's led of my portable hard disk just kept blinking and my laptop couldn't detect my portable hard disk even after i tried all 4 ports of my laptop.
i tried plugging other usb device like my mouse and cable for my mp3 player into the usb port but they work fine.
i did not do any backup for the files in my portable hard disk.
now, i can't retrieve the documents i need for my work.
is there anyway that i could retrieve my old files?
thank you in advance.
