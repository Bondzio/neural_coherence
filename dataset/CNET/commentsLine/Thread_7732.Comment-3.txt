of course you can connect it by using usb.
what do you mean by why?
.. because it can??
because when you connected directly to the modem, your provider will detect and keep your mac address least for atleast 1 day.
that is why you can just connect diffrent computer as you wish... you will have to wait for the ip address lease expired... or you can call your provider to reset it.
-- (although it say 1 day (24hrs), usually it will reset after 15 - 30 minutes.)
wired or wireless router will work with all computer... and of course there are a configuration needed.
and this is the way to connect many computer to single internet connection, hint: sharing..
