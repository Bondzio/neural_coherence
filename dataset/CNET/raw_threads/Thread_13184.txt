The hard drives all work fine when plugged directly into the computer but i recently purchased a VANTEC UGT-MH401 usb hub and when all the drives are plugged in they are painfully slow. for instance extracting a file with 7zip tops out at 400KB /s. Is this the case with every hub i could purchase or is it a problem with this particular hub. it advertises that it has &quot;Downstream ports have automatic connect and speed detection function plus over-current protection with auto-recovery&quot; which i am not sure if that would be a problem this is the product page http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817392005 on newegg. any help is appreciated. thanks
