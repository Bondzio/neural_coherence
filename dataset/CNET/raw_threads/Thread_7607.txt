I followed the directions provided with the hardware ATT sent. I am reusing a netgear wnr2000 wireless router that I had used with the knology internet. The ssid was &quot;mynet&quot;. I have the network setup as follows: The phone line coming from the wall is plugged into the Modem, which is a 2wired RG2701HG-00. I have the netgear WNR2000 plugged into one of the ethernet ports on the 2wired box. If I view available wireless networks, I can see &quot;mynet&quot; network from where I had setup a wireless network when I had knology and a second one with the SSID &quot;2wired534&quot;. I have two laptops I am trying to setup to use this wireless setup. One laptop connects fine to &quot;mynet&quot; but the other doesn't. The other laptop seems to try to connect at different times to &quot;mynet&quot; and to &quot;2wired534&quot; but never get past the &quot;Acquiring network address&quot; stage. The settings are the same on each as far as type of wireless connection, security, password etc. for &quot;mynet&quot; It looks to me like both the Netgear box and the 2wired box are access points. But I don't quite understand why one laptop connects fine to &quot;mynet&quot; and the other doesn't. I know this is all very rambling. I guess my question is what is the proper way to set this network up. Is it as simple as using only the 2wired box and taking the netgear box out of the loop? CD
