Proffitt	8/9/04 11:55 AM	1.0920525E12	Re: My keyboard is returning wrong symbols from the ones I e	Since you posted in the PC Hardware forum, then the hardware answer is to try another keyboard. Also that you boot to DOS and test that keyboard for proper symbols. If there is an OS settings issue, it will have to wait as my Windows 2000 machine boots... Just a couple minutes... Its booting so let me also note you didn't reveal if you installed any keyboard enhancer/driver from Microsoft/Logitech or other. Your post is void of details that are needed. YES, there is a Keyboard item in the Control Panel. And sure enough there can be other Locales to remap the keyboard. Bob

I have not installed any keyboard enhancer/driver from anywhere. Also you suggested I boot to DOS and test the keyboard for proper symbols. The thing is that you did not tell how do I actually test the keyboard after booting to DOS. You see, everything has been working properly on this computer until recently when this problem arose from nowhere!!. You also say that my post was void of details that are needed - I thought I gave all the necessary details required. Could you please be more specific and indicate what other details you require. Thanks.

This is not like a call in support where they will drag the information out of you. That's far too much work for me. If you can't boot DOS and tap the keys on the keyboard to see if they work, then I feel you need to see a service shop. Bob

If the results are good, then your old kybd. is either dirty/cruddy or some other foreign object(staple?) is drifting around it, causing bad contacts. Then again, keyboards do fail, replacement is necessary. You should also check to see that the proper kybd. is installed and recognized under the control panel kybd. icon to be sure. good luck -----Willy

The problem started on the older one when I had it reconditioned with Win98 SE (fromNT4.0). And with the newer when I had it reconditioned from the same OS (win98SE). Maybe you can help with this knowledge. thanks older pc: pentium I win98se newer pc: Athlon 800mhz win98se
