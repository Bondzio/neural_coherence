All schools in the diocesan system route through a school which is home to a tightly managed firewall.
Teachers complain it's too tight as you can't even access youtube within the building.
I'm guessing that a proxy server is part of the control.
IT people at the server location also manage the router that's in the local school and they don't hand out admin passwords.
As for allowing guest access, I'd be more concerned about losing bandwidth during times of peak need by students.
Leaching from the system after hours isn't a problem as, because the APs are POE, we can just flip a toggle to the switch dedicated to the wireless side.
No one can sit in the parking lot and surf once the tech coordinator locks up and goes home.
Eventually, as needs grow and a more complex system is needed, they'll need a way to find money to hire or contract real IT services but I'm sure some jaws would drop at such a sales presentation.
