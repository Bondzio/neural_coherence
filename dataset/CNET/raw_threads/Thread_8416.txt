It is an etower 533i which came with Windows 98 installed. I have upgraded the memory and it works great. I installed Windows 2000 Professional (clean install) and finally got all updated drivers installed so that all hardware works perfectly with the exception of the modem. No matter which driver I install, nothing happens. I have installed the one that emachine provides and I have also installed what is supposed to work according to all the driver sites I've found and nothing works. I understand the modem is a Conexant Soft 56K PCI Modem. Can anyone help with this problem ??
