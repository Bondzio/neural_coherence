Mostly it is a router feature and is platform independent.
Depend on the exact router model, some routers have this in the base and some you need firewall features.
Lets say your 4 example addresses are actually public routable IP The normal way to do this is to put in firewall rules or access lists that says these 4 addresses can only send or receive traffic from each other.
Now if you are using private addresses and nating them it is a little different.
You of course could just prevent these addresses from being natted.
It just makes the firewall rules a little more tricky because you have to worry about both the real and the virtual addresses.
