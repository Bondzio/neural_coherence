<s> So I was wondering if it was possible to use an add-in card AND the intergrated video on a motherboard at the same time..like crossfire. </s>
<s> ....and if the intergrated video was nVidia that was/is set up as a PhysX to supplement the ATI add-in. </s>
<s> I am not sure if it is possible I have an original PhysX Ageia card (PCI) but now nVidia owns it and maybe they would not let such a thing work. </s>
<s> Like crossfire = No. </s>
<s> Let's keep it short. </s>
<s> I know it would not look like crossfire; thats ATI. </s>
<s> SLI is nVidia. </s>
<s> I just wanted to know if i could run them at the same time as physx and ATI </s>
<s> As you suspected, the code, the drivers would not do this. </s>
