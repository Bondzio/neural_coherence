the heatsink is blowing air onto the cpu.
where did i get the idea that it wasn't?
i think some old fans used to blow air away from the cpu.
regarding the northbridge overheating problem, i've seen some chipset fans advertised online which stick to the chipset.
i've also read that when the chipset gets hot they fall off.
any views or experiences on this?
