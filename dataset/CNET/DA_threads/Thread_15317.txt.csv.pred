1.1.1	I added a ATA pci 133 card w/o incedent.	St
1.1.2	I then added a 200G harddrive to the pci card.	St
1.1.3	I set the drive to master since it is the only one on that particular cable.	St
1.1.4	I am unable to boot up the machine after adding the hard drive.	St
1.1.5	My guess is that the machine is attempting to boot-up from this second hard drive.	St
1.1.6	The DriveWizard that came with the drive (seagate drive) only has information for adding the drive as a slave.	St
1.1.7	Any hints?	St
1.1.8	Also, on the start-up screen, though I hit &quot;F1&quot;, I do not go into system set-up.	St
1.1.9	TIA, Greg	St
1.2.1	Cable select.	St
1.2.2	The new 80 conductor cables set the drive as master/slave depending on where its plugged in.	St
1.2.3	I'd retrace your steps and documentations.	St
1.2.4	Old school ideas may have done you in.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	That was the answer!!	St
1.3.2	Thanks, Bob - cable select is new info to me... Greg	St
