The Original Asus Eee Pad Transformer was supposed to update to Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) on the 24th when it was released to the rest of the world. However, I've been constantly smashing the check update buttons for the last few days. So, can someone please explain to me why my Transformer hasn't updated and when it may come? Thanks.
