Hey all, I have a 2 year old pc with decent specs but nothing special when it comes to the video card. I'm looking to upgrade so that I can play Diablo 3 on decent settings. I am not sure which video card is in my range ($50-100) and would be compatible with my PC, and/or if I need to upgrade my power supply first. Below are my specs. Any help would be appreciated! &gt; Inspiron 580 &gt; Mainboard : Dell 0C2KJT &gt; Chipset : Intel H57 &gt; Processor : Intel Core i5 760 @ 2800MHz &gt; Physical Memory : 6144MB 3 x 2048 DDR3-SDRAM &gt; Video Card : ATI Radeon HD 5450 &gt; Hard Disk : Western Digital WD1001FAES-75W7A0 ATA Device (1000GB) &gt; DVD-Rom Drive : HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW GH50 &gt; Operating System : Windows 7 Home Premium Home Edition Media Center 6.01.7601 Service Pack 1 (64-bit) &gt; DirectX : Version 11.00 &gt; Windows Performance Index : 4.9 on 7.9

It should run that game but most want more. Here's the list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html You can pick from that list in the price range and then see if you have enough Amperes and Watts in your PSU. You didn't supply the PSU rating so I can't comment. Bob

Neither case is designed for gaming You might need a low profile card. With a 300w psu you might not be able to move up the gpu ladder. Even a GF gt440 might push the psu into overload.
