The models you've noted last for just a few years.
You want more.
While the laser you have doesn't do photo, the current class of lasers is much better and doesn't have the ink drying issue or the short 2 to 3 year lifespan.
There was not a design problem in the C80.
But you wanted something like a refrigerator.
Something that just works for 7 plus years.
Again, any consumer ink printer will not satisfy what I've read in your postings.
