This board'll be out in September.
The CNET review I link to below has done a good job of outlining the pros and cons, and the MS Hardware link below has a nice interactive multimedia demo of the board's features.
Seems like it'll be perfect for HTPC use, though the price certainly has some kick to it (I wish they'd offer it without the mouse bundled in for $50-$75 less).
