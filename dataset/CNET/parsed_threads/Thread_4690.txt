<s> Connecting two computers to a router forms a network of two computers. </s>
<s> The icon in your taskbar that indicates you are &quot;connected&quot; means only that you are successfully connected to your router. </s>
<s> That doesn't mean that your router made the proper connection to your cable/DSL modem. </s>
<s> The router needs to be configured according to the instructions that your ISP provides for using a router with their service. </s>
<s> Internet --- modem --- router &gt; &gt; &gt; computers This usually means setting the router to &quot;PPPoE&quot; for DSL or &quot;Automatic DHCP&quot; for cable service. </s>
<s> Sometimes MAC Address cloning is required. </s>
<s> Don't rely on me, though. </s>

<s> Hi, I face the same problem. </s>
<s> The signal from my linksys is &quot;excellent&quot;. </s>
<s> I am even connected to msn messenger. </s>
<s> However, IE 7 cannot display a single web page. </s>

<s> For all with similar problems, try this: Go into your ADSL modem/router and configure it to enable &quot;NAT&quot;. </s>
<s> Can you explain how you configure your router to NAT? </s>
<s> I have a Linksys WRT546. </s>
<s> Other people can connect to my wireless network and bring up webpages, but I can't using my laptop. </s>
<s> Mylalptop also does not bring up webpages when I am staying at a hotel and accessing their wireless network. </s>
<s> There has to be something on my laptop that I am not using. </s>
<s> My desktop calls the wireless network &quot;smith&quot;, but my laptop calls it &quot;linksys.&quot; I am considering deleting the network on both computers, then trying to set up the network again. </s>
<s> It all went haywire when I changed from a DSL connection to fiber optics. </s>
<s> My laptop works fine at work on my work LAN. </s>
<s> I uncheck the LAN box when I get it to my house, so that is not the problem. </s>

<s> An ADSL modem/router has an address(consult the user's nanual) - http://xxx.xx.xxx.....etc . </s>
<s> where you set the modem with details from your ISP, e.g. </s>
<s> DNS, username, IP, password, type of connection, etc. </s>
<s> One of the items is whether to enable NAT or not. </s>
<s> For your particular problem, it seems that your wireless network &quot;SSID&quot; is smith, and your desktop has the wrong SSID. </s>
<s> Try to configure your laptop wireless adaptor to detect all available networks, or right click the connection icon ans choose &quot;repair&quot;. </s>
<s> This may also solve your peoblem at the hotel. </s>
<s> ...&quot;and your desktop has the wrong SSID&quot; should read &quot; and your laptop......&quot;. </s>
<s> It may help to &quot;enable broadcast SSID&quot; at the wireless access point/router. </s>
<s> It can be disabled later if so desired. </s>
<s> Note that it takes time for networks to be detected, and once detected, to get connected. </s>
<s> Connection may fail if the signal is not strong enough, although the signal may have been detected. </s>
<s> I have tried the repair feature, but it does not help. </s>
<s> I have also tried adding the laptop to the desktop network by running the wizard again and transfering the the configuration on a flash disk. </s>
<s> Still, smith does not show up on the desktop. </s>
<s> It looks like I had better get a hold of my ISP. </s>
<s> Thanks for trying to help. </s>
