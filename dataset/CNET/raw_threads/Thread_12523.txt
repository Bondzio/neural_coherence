I have been transferring files over to my new computer and I made some new folders just for my Turbo Tax info and some very important pictures. Now I need to reuse it ( it's already filled up) so I can finish up. How in the world to I overwrite, erase or otherwise reuse this thing? All of my previous transfers are not overwritten and therefore are copied into another file! It's a Lexar 512 MB if that helps.Thanx
