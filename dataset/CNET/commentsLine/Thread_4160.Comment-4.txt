i use it and prefer it.
for some strange reason ie &quot;hangs up&quot; and i usually have to exit and re-enter the program, i don't have this problem with firefox...that's why i prefer it.
like others have said...why not try it?...you can always un-install it if you don't like it.
occasionally (rarely is more accurate) a website will require ie ...i simply close the firefox browser and fire up the ie (hoping it doesn't freeze up).
