1.1.1	im going to buy a new LCD Flat Panel monitor but wasnt sure about the sizes .	St
1.1.2	I was under the impression that the size ( example 17 & quot ; ) is different from the viewing size ... .is this correct ? ... .my current CRT monitor is a 17 & quot ; and id like one the same or roughly the same size .	St
1.1.3	id really appreciate anyone helping me out with this !	Polite
1.1.4	thanks alot guys !	Polite
1.1.5	frank	St
1.2.1	Lcd and it went south after 3years of hard use .	St
1.2.2	But it was about the same viewing size as this 17 & quot ; crt .	St
1.2.3	So if youi get a 17 & quot ; lcd youi will seem to have more screen , as well as less eye strain .	St
1.3.1	Your 17 & quot ; CRT is probably 16 & quot ; ( diagonal measurement ) in reality .	St
1.3.2	A 17 & quot ; LCD will be just that ... 17 & quot ; diagonal .	St
1.3.3	There are some with slightly different aspect ratios out there that dont follow the normal 4X3 convention .	St
1.3.4	You can tell this by their published & quot ; native resolution & quot ; by doing a little math .	St
1.3.5	This just changes the relative width and highth of the images .	St
1.3.6	Also , the native resolution will be the only one that gives the monitors best image .	St
1.3.7	The resolution you like best on your current monitor might not be the optimum for a CRT of equivant size .	St
1.3.8	This may mean you accept some image degradation or go with the native resolution and get used to a change in icon and page sizes .	St
1.4.1	thanks guys !	Polite
1.4.2	thats helped alot ... .i think i know what i want now ... .thanks again frank	St
1.5.1	CRT 's are measured from one top corner to the opposing bottom corner of the picture tube in a diagonal fashion .	St
1.5.2	You often hear the term & quot ; viewable size & quot ; and this refers to the amount of the tube not covered by the shroud or bezzel .	St
1.5.3	LCD screens are what you see is what you get though I think they are still measured from top corner to opposing bottom corner .	St
1.5.4	At any rate a 17 & quot ; LCD will usually have a larger screen than a CRT simply because none of the LCD screen will be covered by a shroud or bezzel .	St
1.5.5	One interesting thing I 've noticed is that even though an LCD has a bigger screen it looks like it is smaller simply because of the smaller footprint of the monitor .	St
1.5.6	It sort of fools the brain because of the small package that contains the big screen .	St
1.5.7	We 're all used to seeing 20 & quot ; deep and wide monitors and now they are only a few inches deep .	St
