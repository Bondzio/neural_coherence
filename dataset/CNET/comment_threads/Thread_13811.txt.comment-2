I found one machine that when the BIOS was set to boot from CD first... it delayed for about that long.
To speed it up, we set it to boot from the hard disk.
Lucky for us the bios has a BOOT FROM menu that pops up if you press some key so we don't need to set the BIOS to boot from CD if that's required.
