Your RAM must be installed in pairs, I do believe.
Way to tell..if you have four (4) memory slots..two black and two blue.
If you have only three (3) slots then one of your 256 sticks is probably bad or, if you move it, not seated correctly.
If the latter, remove and reintall.
Did it show 512 before you put in the 512?
