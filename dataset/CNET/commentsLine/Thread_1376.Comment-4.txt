1. the dvd recorder is not of current technology.
the non-multi-format dvd+r/w or dvd-r/w drives are going for abotu 69 bucks retail.
the package you have may be trying to soak you for a recorder that is going to annoy you as you may want to record on either plus or minus (dash?)
media.
2.
2,000?
is that cnd (canadian?)
for 2,000 you should be able to do better.
keep the money in your wallet and keep shopping.
don't accept a dvd recorder of a single format and especially without dvd authoring software.
additionally, windows movie maker does not qualify as good dvd software.
