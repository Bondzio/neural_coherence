1.1.1	Hi there !	St
1.1.2	I 'm not a newbie by all means , however I 'm curious if anyone has any constructive advice ?	Ques
1.1.3	A friend of mine has a P4 MDG-built , Intel motherboard PC which now can not power on .	St
1.1.4	It was in this condition at my arrival at the scene of the crime .	St
1.1.5	An inexeperienced individual has been fiddling around with the corrections , and after finishing , the computer allegedly never powered on afterwards .	St
1.1.6	I reconnected all of the loose and missing cables to their correct places , and tested the power supply ( using a paperclip to connect green to black wires on the power supply 's 24-pin connector ) .	St
1.1.7	When I plug the 24-pin connector back into the motherboard , the LED on the motherboard and the front of the computer lights up .	St
1.1.8	However when I attempt to power the computer up , nothing happens .	St
1.1.9	Anyone have any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.10	I 'm out ...	St
1.1.11	Either the mobo is busted and needs to be replaced/fixed , or I missed some connectors ?	Ques
1.1.12	Could it be that the power supply is only half-busted ?	Ques
1.1.13	It could be that the button is not plugged into the right spot ( doubtful ) , but I 've tried manually connecting the two pins with a knife , etc .	St
1.1.14	Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated , sorry for the long message .	Polite
1.1.15	TIA	St
1.2.1	1 ) Do all the fans work ?	Ques
1.2.2	2 ) Does the light on the Motherboard light up ?	Ques
1.2.3	3 ) Take the battery out and put it back , to set to default .	St
1.2.4	4 ) If the above is negative start with power supply diagnostic .	St
1.3.1	Try shuffling the RAM around to different slots .	St
1.3.2	Sometimes there is a bad slot on the motherboard , sometimes the memory wo n't work in certain slots , sometimes it will stop working where it has worked before .	St
1.3.3	If that does n't work , consider that the only components you need to have connected in order to POST ( not boot into Windows ) the board are : Power Supply CPU RAM Video Card That 's it .	St
1.3.4	Unplug absolutely everything else and use the knife to short the the power pins .	St
1.3.5	If this does n't work , unplug all the RAM and try it again .	St
1.3.6	Sometimes you have to make the connections between the pins for a couple of seconds .	St
1.3.7	Does the system beep at you when it did n't before ?	Ques
1.3.8	You probably have bad RAM .	St
1.3.9	If it does n't beep , try putting the RAM back in and taking the video card out , etc .	St
1.3.10	Try a different power supply .	St
1.3.11	Try a different CPU .	St
1.3.12	ood luck	Polite
1.4.1	Sounds like somethings not right ... so look for these problems in no particular order 1 loose memory in slot 2 Loose video card in slot 3 Motherboard has switch plugs .	St
1.4.2	They need to be right backwards wo n't work on some boards .	St
1.4.3	I do n't think it 's a bad motherboard if the fans spin sometimes clear CMOS either by jumper or remove battery ... .	St
1.5.1	The only way I can get ANYTHING to change from pure dead state is by connecting the connectors on the power-supply 24-pin cable .	St
1.5.2	At this point , the HD , CDROM , FLOPPY , and only the POWERSUPPLY-FAN begins to work .	St
1.5.3	I ca n't get to see the screen run because this way , the motherboard is n't connected , therefor no video card .	St
1.5.4	Could RAM or CPU really be the problem ?	Ques
1.5.5	Surely I would get some sort of response from trying to power on even without it ?	Ques
1.5.6	Thanks again .	St
1.6.1	be tested with a mobo with no components installed laying on a piece of cardboard or any insulated surface .	St
1.6.2	Plug the Power supply into the AC outlet [ switch on rear on ] .	St
1.6.3	No components mounted to mobo , no CPU , no memory , no nuttin .	St
1.6.4	With the 24 pin power supply cable connected , simply use the tip of a small flat screwdriver to momentarily [ very momentary ] short the two Front Power switch pins on the mobo together .	St
1.6.5	The supply should turn on [ its fan rotates ] and stay on .	St
1.6.6	You can turn it off by shorting the pins again , possibly need to hold for 4 to five seconds to shut it off .	St
1.6.7	If the supply does not turn on the mobo is bad .	St
1.6.8	One should do this test when first removing the mobo from the box and before mounting anything .	St
1.6.9	If the supply does n't turn on at this point things ai n't going to get any better .	St
