<s> Forum, I recently purchased a Canon HF11 32GB video camera. </s>
<s> I am not willing to install an internal hard drive into my computer that is becoming dated. </s>
<s> I figured a 2TB Fantom GF2000EU ought to do. </s>
<s> Am I missing something here or is this the correct solution? </s>
<s> But I opted for 2 so they can sync and if one fails I have a chance to obtain another backup unit. </s>
<s> Many go for such and STORE files but forget backups. </s>
<s> Also, video editing on USB drives usually takes all the fun out of editing. </s>
<s> See http://img.trustcollective.com/tool/comcast-wagon2.jpg Bob </s>
<s> Bob, Do you have a recommendation? </s>
<s> Maybe 2 of these hard drives? </s>
<s> And editing software? </s>
<s> My old Pinnacle is 8 years old and I'm sure there is a better editng software. </s>
<s> The link you attached is a jpeg. </s>
<s> Thanks, Matt </s>
<s> Maybe 2 of those drives. </s>
<s> That way you sync one to the other. </s>
<s> I use SyncBack. </s>
