<s> I hope you can help me out here. </s>
<s> I just finished building my first cpu.Boots up into bios, however when I try to partition and format hard drive system freezes on me.All accesories are recognized.The build is made up of the following: Aopen Ak86-l Amd Athlon 64 3000 Maxtor 120gb ATA133 hard drive GeForce 5500 OC PCI 256 graphics card 450 Watt Power supply 256mb ddr400 pc3200 Geil Sony crx320e cdrw/dvdrom Floppy I have the Maxblast3 software from Maxtor - but it freezes on reboot Tried to use fdisk.exe however dos says it is the wrong version At one point I believe I almost got through but it said ndtlr missing. </s>
<s> Should I upgrade the Phoenix Bios? </s>
<s> Any help you could offer would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I don't use maxblast except for its drive fitness test. </s>
<s> Otherwise I could get a hangup during the OS install if I make a partition bigger than the OS supports. </s>
<s> Got it? </s>
