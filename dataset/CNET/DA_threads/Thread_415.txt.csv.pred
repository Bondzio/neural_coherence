1.1.1	First off my system specs- & lt ; span & gt ; 8GB kingston , HyperX X2 Grey DDR3 RAM & lt ; span & gt ; & lt ; span & gt ; XFX , Radeon HD 6950 1GB GPU & lt ; span & gt ; & lt ; span & gt ; Samsung 1TB SpinPoint SATA & lt ; span & gt ; & lt ; span & gt ; LITE-ON , Blue-ray disk Combo Drive & lt ; span & gt ; & lt ; span & gt ; MSI H67MA-E45 MoBo & lt ; span & gt ; & lt ; span & gt ; Thermaltake TR2 Standard 500W Power supply- 24 Pin & lt ; span & gt ; & lt ; span & gt ; Intel Core i7-2600 Quad core 3.4Ghz & lt ; span & gt ; Now for my problem- ( I do n't know a ton about computers , but i 'll try to describe it to the best of my ability ) A few weeks ago , my PC started cutting off without warning- then it would boot back up and either run fine or cut off again within 10-30 mins .	St
1.1.2	I set my computer to not cut off if it encountered a problem with the RAM , instead it would show the blue error screen- Have n't seen it yet , so i 'm assuming it 's not that .	St
1.1.3	I 've also heard that software issues can cause a system to fail , so i 'm booted into safe-mode at the moment .	St
1.1.4	Should i just do a full re-install of windows and see if that helps ?	Ques
1.1.5	A few hours ago , my PC cut off and attempted to reboot and cut off a few seconds into it .	St
1.1.6	then repeat .	St
1.1.7	I had to flip the power switch in the rear to stop the process .	St
1.1.8	Is it safe to continue using or should i leave it be until i can figure out the problem ?	Ques
1.1.9	I 've heard that power supplies in general can be prone to failing after short periods of time , I 've only had this build for about 4-5 months .	St
1.1.10	Any help would be great , i 'm pretty lost at the moment .	Polite

1.2.1	Why did you install a PSU with split rails ?	Ques
1.2.2	Also the video card called for & quot ; Minimum 500W or greater system power supply & quot ; which you supplied .	St
1.2.3	Now go find an oval track and drive your car at 120MPH .	St
1.2.4	How long till it fails ?	Ques
1.2.5	Game machine builders tend to get SINGLE RAIL units and learn to not install the minimum .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	the video card requires two 6 pin PCI express connectors , does that have anything to do with the number of rails ?	Ques
1.3.2	also how many watts should I go for ?	Ques
1.3.3	550 ?	Ques
1.3.4	650 ?	Ques
1.4.1	But mostly about how many amperes a pin can carry .	St
1.4.2	This is why more than two wires are needed and more than one connection because the Amperes exceed that of a pin , a connector and so on .	St
1.4.3	Your choice on the PSU but my advice is to go with SINGLE RAIL power supplies unless you know how to figure out what 's on each rail , how many Amperes is being drawn on each rail , etc .	St
1.4.4	Most folk do not want to go that deep .	St
1.4.5	Hence , SINGLE RAIL and at least 50 % over the minimum .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	As mentioned ... ... .your psu is NOT going to cut it .	St
1.5.2	Suggestion .	St
1.5.3	Go here .	St
1.5.4	http : //www.newegg.com/Index.aspx ? name=Home Filter by psu .	St
1.5.5	Filter by Corsair or Pc power+cooling .	St
1.5.6	Pick one that 's 600w or bigger ... ... .bigger does no harm .	St
1.5.7	Their all single rail units ... ... no fuss .	St
