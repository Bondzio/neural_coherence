would that maybe point to a problem with one of the memory sticks?
as a note, i replaced my hard drive about a year ago after it died.
if another drive goes, i wonder if there's something going on with the mother board that could corrupt a drive?
as i mentioned, the power supply was also replaced.
this was a good computer for about 4 years.
but maybe i won't go with dell next time around.
golems in the gears.
