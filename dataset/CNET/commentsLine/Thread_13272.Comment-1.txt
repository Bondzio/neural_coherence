running xp, pavilion 9870, 784 mb ram, with an acom data usb 2.0 external hard drive (120 gb).
the external drive is used for picture storage.
mostly jpg, tif, mp3, wmv.
i gave it a name (external drive).
typically, i leave the computer on much of the time.
i've had to re-boot the main computer every now and then.
i noticed that the external drive doesn't show its name anymore (it's just local k:), and it will not write data.
i tried to open the drive, and it says it is not accessible.
i tried to do a disk clean, and it also gives this same message.
it seems to be scanning when i click on it, but when i try to open it by double clicking on it, the pilot light flickers, then a window pops up that says &quot;k is not accessible.
a file or directory is corrupted or unreadable.&quot; please advise.
