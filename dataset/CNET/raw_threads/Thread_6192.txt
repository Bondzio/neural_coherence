I would hit the Toshiba web site and see if the drivers are available for it for Windows 7. Bob

(i installed win7 on a similar toshiba and everything worked except the bluetooth.) if you're ok with reinstalling all your apps from scratch, just get a replacement hard drive, install it in the laptop, and do clean install of win7. $70 wd scorpio black: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136280 $60 wd scorpio blue: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136197 the blue is 5400rpm, the black is 7200rpm... well worth the $10.
