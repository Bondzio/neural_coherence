this one is interesting, though i'm pretty sure that his situation was far worse than mine .
here's the story:  and the other half:  that guy's mac saw its fair share of botched jobs.
my mac has come back twice now without being fully repaired, but it hasn't gotten too bad yet.
i mean the first two times, i explained to them all of my issues and i told them what i wanted fixed.
so far they've done a bang up job... i really hope that they just swap it out when it returns, supposing it doesn't work right, because that guy's escapade doesn't sound too good.
thankfully, the two geniuses that helped me out sounded like they got most of it down, but... i read the sheet with the scheduled repairs on it and i don't think they got them all down like they said.
i typed up every single thing i could find and had problems with just for them, but i suppose three pages of problems and complaints is too much for them.
they said they got them all, but i would disagree if that paper is correct.
that's what happened the first time... the guy didn't write one of the things down.
i noticed that before i left and asked him about it.
said they had it and would check it out.
but they didn't.
here it is happening again... well, i look forward to my santa rosa machine, if i end up getting one.
my initial question remains: do the new santa rosa machines have any substantial advantages over their predecessors?
i guess i'll find out, but i'd like to know ahead of time.
