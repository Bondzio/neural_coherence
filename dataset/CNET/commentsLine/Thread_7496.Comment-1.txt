i already have the case(standard mid-atx antec with front firewire/usb 2.0 plugs).
do i need a certain type of motherboard to be able to connect the front firewire(ieee 1394a/b)?
or will all standard mobo's have the pins to connect it correctly?
i have been building pc's for a while now, so i know all the basics.
i'm just not sure what to buy for this.
