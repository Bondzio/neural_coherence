<s> I'm looking for a little help with some recent issues I've been having with my external LaCie hard drive. </s>
<s> I've had absolutely no problems with the drive until a few days ago when, after running CCleaner, my PC suddenly started getting really bogged down to the point where opening a simple program like notepad would cause it to crash. </s>
<s> The LaCie drive has been spinning at an abnormally high volume and the status light is constantly in yellow &quot;active&quot; mode. </s>
<s> When I remove the drive, the computer works up to speed as usual, and there are no problems. </s>
<s> Is it possible that CCleaner removed some sort of registry entry which messed up how the drive works, and if so, how can I remedy this? </s>
<s> I also noticed that on the LaCie drive itself, several of my photo album folders were somehow corrupted. </s>
<s> These folders were renamed as a crypic series of symbols and cannot be opened, edited, or deleted, returning a &quot;the filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect&quot; message when I try. </s>
<s> I've tried a few recovery programs for that data, but none has worked successfully thus far. </s>
<s> If anybody has any suggestions for straightening this out, they would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> [My system is a Dell Dimension 4600 PC running Windows XP SP2 with a 2.8GHz P4 and 768Mb RAM. </s>
<s> The drive is an external 40Gb portable LaCie hard drive] </s>
<s> Sorry but this sounds more like the usual pests. </s>
<s> In the Security Forum the usual free scans would be my next move. </s>
<s> It's that or Windows is INDEXING. </s>

<s> I took your advice and ran several full system scans, with my Symantec AV software, but came up empty. </s>
<s> The odd thing is that the scans only went through 14011 files and only took 03:36. </s>
<s> These full scans used to take close to an hour and checked 100s of thousands of files and folders, so I'm not sure it's really doing it's job. </s>
<s> Is there a chance my AV software has become corrupted as well? </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> After you ran ccleaner is when problems started,you could have deleted something you shouldn't have.I did that one time with reg seeker. </s>
<s> These reg cleaners have the option to back up first before deleting. </s>
<s> You can try AVG ANTI SPYWARE and your anti virus in safe mode. </s>
<s> Not sure if system restore will help. </s>

<s> I've run my AV software normally and in safe mode several times, to no avail, and I also just noticed Windows Media Player won't open. </s>
<s> I reinstalled the program itself, but no change. </s>
<s> Drives slowing my PC to a standstill, AV software not operating as usual, programs not functioning at all...got to be a virus of some sort, but how do I get rid of it if my AV software won't catch it? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Did you run avg anti spyware in safe mode? </s>
<s> Maybe disable system restore,scan in safe mode,then ser new restore point,then scan in normally mode. </s>
<s> Tried it, and unfortunately no change . </s>
<s> I've used several AV and Anti Spyware programs (including AVG) in both normal and safe modes, but they never turn up anything. </s>
<s> I've made sure to get the most updated definitions but still no luck. </s>
<s> I did scan with Spyware Doctor, which did find several infected files, but I'm not sure if it was just a ploy to get me to purchase the full version of their software? </s>
<s> Not sure what I can do at this point to recover the last 5 years of backed up photos, get Windows Media Player working again, and get rid of the corrupted folders/files on my external drive. </s>
<s> To me the drive needs to be set aside until you find the pest or bug. </s>
<s> Until then it is not a good idea to use this drive. </s>
<s> Over in the Virus and Security Forum is a sticky post with the usual free scanning tools. </s>
<s> I list the usual notable disk tools at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7591_102-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=258441&messageID=2551921#2551921 Bob </s>
