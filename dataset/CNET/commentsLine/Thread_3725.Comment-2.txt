&quot;does it matter by hawk9997 - 3/5/07 6:31 am in reply to: lex(s)mart-42 by drudgetoiler i work for a company that just deals with printers.
on a daily basis, people ask some sort of version of that question.
here is the answer.
lexmark, hp, and dell all claim to show you accurate ink levels in most if not all of their cartridges.
however, if you really started questioning them, you would find out that the levels are more guidelines and to be taken with a grain of salt.
now that being said, they can be accurate, however, we have found out that the levels can be up to 75% off.
best piece of advise for you, if you want accurate ink levels, buy a canon.
but if you get a lexmark, use the cartridges until the quality looks bad, that is one of the indications that the cartridge is empty.&quot; link removed.
