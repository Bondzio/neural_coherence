The reading I did mentioned having trouble with heatsink clearence with some GPUs, and the standard PSUs for the Opti are 300watt, which may not be enough for some higher-end GPUs (which seems like it's going to be overkill for me) and to put in a bigger PSU means messing around with rewiring the MoBo connectors... http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/286257-28-optiplex-minitower-heatsink-blocking-pcie-video-card I don't mind popping the case open to swap a few parts down the road if my needs change, but want as few hassels as possible.
