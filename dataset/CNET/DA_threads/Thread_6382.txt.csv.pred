1.1.1	Just need a hint here.	St
1.1.2	We're setting up a Lacie 1TB &quot;Etherdisk&quot; NAS drive.	St
1.1.3	It uses embedded XP.	St
1.1.4	I've created several shares and users.	St
1.1.5	I can map a share to a designated user's PC and set up an account on it which will easily access that share on the NAS.	St
1.1.6	I can also browse with explorer to the share and connect.	St
1.1.7	The drive allows several protocols including http and ftp.	St
1.1.8	I've configured some of the shares with http as well with the intention of allowing teachers to access their personal shares from home.	St
1.1.9	We've had the NAS drive linked for remote access.	St
1.1.10	The problem we are having is that none of the shares allow access using http from either the local network or remotely unless I add &quot;Everyone&quot; to the permissions for that share.	St
1.1.11	The same PCs (All XP Pro) with the appropriate account logged on will access the share just fine by browsing to it through the network but we get &quot;permission denied&quot; if switching to a web browser (Firefox or IE7) using http.	St
1.1.12	I've contacted Lacie support for this and a couple other issues but this one they could not address by offering any advice other than to try connecting the NAS to a monitor, mouse and keyboard and attempting to set up the shares a different way.	St
1.1.13	To me that makes no sense because that's what remote admin is for.	St
1.1.14	Surely I'm missing something simple here.	St
1.1.15	Any thoughts would be appreciated.	Polite
1.1.16	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	The ZONE that IE put that drive in may be at fault.	St
1.2.2	Or your firewall.	St
1.3.1	The router in the school is handled remotely by IT personnel with school administration.	St
1.3.2	They had to open up something to get this out on the web, link it for me and give me an IP address to put in a browser for remote access.	St
1.3.3	But, would this explain why I can't use http from the local network...inside the school itself?	St
1.3.4	I can't see how it's firewall could have an effect.	St
1.3.5	As well, I can't figure how adding &quot;everyone&quot; to the share suddenly makes it accessible from either direction.	St
1.3.6	Hope this makes sense.	St
1.3.7	Thanks for the quick comeback.	St
1.4.1	http has no user authentication so for it to work you would have to allow an user to access the file system.	St
1.4.2	Not that I know your lacie that well but for http to work, ask what account needs to allow file access.	St
1.5.1	I can enable that and see if TPTB at school headquarters can port us through.	St
1.5.2	Thanks again	St
