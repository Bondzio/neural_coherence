mrmacfixit, thanks for the advice.
tried it.
works great.
because of my work environment, i have to work with pc's most of the time.
so i have to have a pc at home.
my wife is a graphic designer, so her world is macs.
she gets to have all the fun.
of course, i'm on the mac every chance i get.
anyway, at home i'm the go to guy when it comes to anything tech.
lately, my wife has been having trouble with applications quitting unexpectedly.
safari, ie, photoshop, quark, and others.
she has a g4 mirrored front tower.
running os x 10.2.8. do you have any idea how i would go about investigating/fixing this problem.
thanks for any help.
rickey
