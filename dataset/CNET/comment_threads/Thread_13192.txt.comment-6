Yeah, sorry.
I meant to use GB instead of MB.
And I forgot to add that I wouldn't recommend that last GB unless you can get it free, or at least REALLY cheap!
Getting only 1/4 of what you pay for isn't much of a deal.
I haven't removed the 4th RAM memory unit, but I'd bet there wouldn't be a noticeable difference between 3 GB and 4 GB.
