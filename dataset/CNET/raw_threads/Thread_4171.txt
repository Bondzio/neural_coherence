This button is convenient because when a screen freezes up it is easier to press the reset button than to press ctrl. alt. and delete. I need to buy a new computer but the stores that I visited only sell computers that do not have reset buttons. If I buy a computer without a reset button how would I fix a frozen screen? Thank you very much.

XP can recover from frozen screens, if and when they ever happen. I have four PCs running XP Home and Pro and it never happens to me. Then, again, pressing the power button for &gt;5 seconds powers off and you can power back up.
