i need some advice .... what would be a good/high quality internal hd for my ibook?
i'd like to spend around $100-150, and want to have something that is higher quality, very reliable, and fast!
don't need a huge hd, maybe 120 gb max.
i'm more concerned with the quality than the size.
my computer is an ibook g4 (purchased june 2004), running os x 10.4.11. i'm also adding a one gb stick of ram.
thanks!
