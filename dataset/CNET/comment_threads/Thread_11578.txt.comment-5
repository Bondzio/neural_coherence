The tests are still coming up bad after a cold boot.
The OS is most likely not booting due to the Memory errors.
After a DIMM swap the memory will pass a 15 minute test.
I use Memtest86 to test my RAM and I trust it's results.
However, if a RAM tests bad, it could still be the MB.
I have contacted Gigabyte Last Thursday and they have not wrote back.
(way to go 24 hour rule).
Will let you know when the new (approved) RAM gets here.
