i am looking into this as a temp source of inet for the next 6 months.
we are renting a house for 6 months, and pickings are slim there.
sat(expensive) dial up( yea, right) or cell use.
verizons 3g is really good there.
since it is only 6 months i am not going with a 2 year plan, which means it will not be really be cheap either way.
any other good ideas out there?
