1.1.1	After getting great advice from my previous thread, I was wondering if anyone has recommendations for a monochrome laser printer for $150-200.	St
1.1.2	Only big requirement is two sided printing ( i think this is called autoduplexing?).	St
1.1.3	Would like wireless/network capability for two or three users, but not a must have.	St
1.1.4	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	The HP LaserJet Pro P1606DN Printer retails at about 200 bucks but I'm sure you can find it discounted.	St
1.2.2	It has Ethernet and not wireless.	St
1.2.3	Brother makes one with auto-duplexing and is wireless.	St
1.2.4	I don't have the model # but it runs less than the HP.	St
1.2.5	Keep in mind that, in the long run, it's toner that will cost your more.	St
1.2.6	It's still far cheaper than inkjet cartridges.	St
1.2.7	Good luck.	St
