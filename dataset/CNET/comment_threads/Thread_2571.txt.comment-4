When you run in Safe Mode, you get 640 x 480, so I'd try lowering the resolution.
Normally I'd use the default for the monitor, but if your PC's video can't handle that, you've got to either lower the setting or get a better video card.
Try 800 x 600 and see if that works.
If it does, try 1024 x 786, and keep going up 'till you find one that doesn't, then back down from that.
Good luck.
