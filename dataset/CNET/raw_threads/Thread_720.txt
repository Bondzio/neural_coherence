I open the device manager in window and check the system devices, there lists a lot of PCI-like items. But I don't know how to read it. Which one is the one related to the graphics card? Sorry, I don't even sure if I am asking in a correct way. Please help. Thanks.

Maybe you could explain why it matters or why you looked for this. Remember to follow the forum Note , &quot;If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.&quot; That way you may get your answer sooner.
