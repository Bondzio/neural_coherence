If the computer's that is going to send data through the wireless network processor is only Pentium 2, is it fine? And what do I need to set up a wireless network so that I can send data from 1 computer to another? Thank you.

Hardware is probably not the limiting factor, it's the operating system - which may in its own way impose the hardware minimums. A PII desktop system with an open PCI slot running Win98SE should be able to support the drivers that a WiFi card needs. A USB 1.1 port would work too. For a laptop of that vintage, it would need a USB 1.1 port, but you'd have to determine the exact specs of the PCMCIA/PC-Card slot to be sure the new adapter card is compatible. dw
