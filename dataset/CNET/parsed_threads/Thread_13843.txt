<s> Hello, Microboards also carries a product called the Orbit II. </s>
<s> This machine has batch-mode capabilities, will run until it is out of cds and also has a reject feature that will kick out bad discs. </s>
<s> Batch-mode processing is new feature to the Orbit II. </s>
<s> As the unit receives the first master disc it copies it into the unit's hard drive then duplicates onto blank discs until it recieves another master and the process is repeated. </s>
<s> The Orbit II is available in either 52X CD or 8X DVD, features a choice of copy, copy/verify, or verify only and an easy to use two button interface. </s>
<s> You can see the Orbit II at http://www.microboards.com/new/article.php?story=20030415153052696 . </s>
