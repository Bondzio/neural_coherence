Since this has happened so many times i feel i must be doing something wrong. I use Nero 6 to do all my writing and then after 2 to 3 weeks the drive will not erase a cdrw , but will read. It has been driving me potty while HP seem happy to just replace them with no explaination of whats the cause/fault. Could anyone tell me if this is a common fault. My PC has had no problems in this area. regards Adrian

Almost all seem to cave into some failure if used a lot in year 2. The only good news is the desktop replacement drives are 10 to 20 dollars. Since it is likely the same dollar for the laptop units (HP's cost) then they are likely to be just covering the warranty and will walk at the end of the warranty. If this was my setup, I'd look into some USB 2.0 external DVD/CDRW writer. Bob
