<s> My desktop started doing this intermittantly a while ago. </s>
<s> I'd try booting again and it would eventually boot successfully. </s>
<s> However, eventually it quit. </s>
<s> I recall having this problem when there was a bad Master Boot Record. </s>
<s> Fixed it and no further problems. </s>
<s> This time is different. </s>
<s> Rewriting the MBR doesn't fix it. </s>
<s> Since it was time to clean up my HDD, I reinstalled Win XP Pro. </s>
<s> This involved formatting the drive. </s>
<s> Still - same problem. </s>
<s> I can still use the PC by leaving my XP CD in the drive. </s>
<s> During the boot sequence I am prompted with &quot;Press any key to boot from CD.&quot; If I ignore the prompt and let the boot sequence go on, I'll be able to boot right to my hard drive. </s>
<s> Any ideas?? </s>
<s> Dell XPS 1000r 1000 Mhz 60 GB HDD 512 MB RAM Thanks. </s>
<s> is normal when the CD is before the C drive in the boot sequence, an d ignoring it is correct. </s>
<s> I wish that you would describe the actual problem in more detail. </s>
<s> MBR's don't just go bad over time. </s>
<s> Don't hear of many MBR viruses anymore. </s>
<s> May be ram going bad. </s>
<s> If 2 sticks, try 1 at a time. </s>
<s> if not, get &quot;memtest86&quot; from Microsoft and let it run. </s>
<s> Download diagnostic floppy for the Hdd from the Mfg website. </s>
<s> May be a warranty issue. </s>
<s> May be your video card messing with your endorphins. </s>
<s> Very strange symptoms, have you tried booting to into CMOS setup and changing the boot sequence to boot from the Hard drive first, CD second and FLoppy last. </s>
<s> See if that resolved the problem. </s>
<s> Possible that you hard drive is going. </s>
<s> Leaving boot cd in drive may be allowing H/D to spin up. </s>
<s> Knew of one system that would boot on the 3rd or 4th re-start and do just fine. </s>
<s> Another attached on an angle in the rails would boot, lay it flat and no boot. </s>
<s> With the cover off, get the drive running hard by transfering large data blocks and see how hot it gets. </s>
<s> Drive should be on the warm side of hot. </s>
<s> (baby bottle) Any hotter than that the drive motor may be bad. </s>
