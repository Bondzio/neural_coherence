1.1.1	i was just getting a list of parts i'd need for a custom built pc,and have been getting a crash course in a lot of the interfaces and realizing that i need to match up practically everything for compatability.so now if i understand correctly,SATA 3.0/gb (aka SATA II) is the new standard and IDE/PATA is the old standard,right?i think i read that the motherboard has 5 SATA slots.the board is a ASUS M3A78-T AM2+/AM2 AMD 790GX HDMI ATX AMD Motherboard.	St
1.1.2	so,my main question on top of all those other small question is should i have all drives,optical and hdd hooked up through the SATA ports?or should i use an IDE port for one of my optical drives?	St
1.2.1	It really just makes a difference as to what you're going to do with the computer.	St
1.2.2	If you're gaming, then you're going to probably want the drives to be SATA as the throughput is greater on a SATA than it is on IDE.	St
1.2.3	Now if you want to get crazy, you can invest in SCSI drives from Western Digital spinning at 10,000 rpm, the Raptor drives, then you'd need to bump your ram up to balance the sheer amount of throughput coming from the SCSI interface at 10,000rpm instead of the 7200rpm standard drive speed.	St
1.2.4	As far as optical drives, either way isn't going to make that much of a difference as the read/write speed isn't going to change, just the transferring of that information.	St
