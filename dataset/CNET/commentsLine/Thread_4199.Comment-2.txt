detach ptr.
from system and do a &quot;self-test&quot;, is it ok?
also, when on the system, do its own test pattern output, is it ok?
besides the reloading of the os, etc, plus all drivers, have you updated the os as well to include dx, etc., any updates fromt he ms update service?
of course the printer should be at its best, if under its test pattern it mentiones, low ink, replace.
