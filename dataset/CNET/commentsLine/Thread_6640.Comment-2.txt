everything looks decent .....case looks great but a little overpriced.
suspect you can find the same functionality ....internal and external drives, fans, etc., without spending $189.
ram....the timings (latency) are higher (slower) than most dd3 1600....the dimms selected show 11-11-11-30 whereas most ddr3 1600 dimms are 9-9-9-24 and some are 8 -8-8- 24 or even 7. bottomline, for $75 incl shiiping, i'd look for the highest rated 8gb (x2) or 4gb (x4) dimms rated at 9 or better and then pick the kit that gives you your total 16gb here's a well rated 2 dimm x 8gb kit with 8 latency (runs faster than 9 and 11)  here's a well rated 2 dimm x 8gb kit with 9 low latency (runs faster than 11)  let us know what you ultimately choose and how it goes.
