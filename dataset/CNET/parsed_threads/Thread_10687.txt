<s> I have a Linksys WRT54G wireless router. </s>
<s> I originally ran the setup CD using my old desktop. </s>
<s> However, I just bought a new Dell laptop and will be getting rid of the old desktop for good. </s>
<s> The laptop is already on the wireless network and works great, but I want to make sure I'm not messing up anything by getting rid of the computer where the router was intalled. </s>
<s> Is there anything I need to do to the new laptop as far as settings so that it knows the desktop won't ever be back. </s>
<s> I am particularly curious because on the setup page, the Host Name is &quot;desktop&quot;, so I must have had to identify the machine somewhere in the setup (I wish I remembered!). </s>
<s> All machines run Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> Somebody please provide advice. </s>
<s> Thanks!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> with that you can always configure any pc/laptop So its ok to get rid of the old PC </s>
<s> I have the CD. </s>
<s> Should I do anything with it now, or just hang on to it in case of problems in the future? </s>
<s> Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> You don't have anything to do with the CD... keep it in a safe place... As for the old pc... </s>
<s> I don't know what are you going to do.. but don't forget to backup your data... then if possible format it.. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> And as for the old computer, I've already transferred my data. </s>
<s> I am giving it to a friend and plan to reformat the hard drive first. </s>
<s> I know that won't make my data completely uncovereable, but I don't know of any free programs for that, so reformating is the best I can do. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> try The Drive Cleanser or Eraser 5.3. </s>
<s> ... google it </s>
