so your modem is a cable gateway?
you didn't state what make, model modem you are linking to.
a cable gateway is a modem/router combination, some are wireless.
if it is a wireless gateway you wouldn't need to link to another router.
if it is a hardwire gateway i'd swap it out to a stand alone cable modem, something like a motorola surfboard and if the hardwired systems are all gigabit ready i'd swap cables from cat-5 to cat-6 for better throughput potential.
