I have a HP Pavillion notebook zd7380us, with an nvidia geforce fx5700 grafic card, so far I was playing some games without a problem, then it came Doom3 and after completing several levels the computer start crashing, I have done everything from updating drivers, game versions, and still have problems, then it happens that when restarting the laptop on the very first screen before log in, it looks funny with some vertical color lines and white dots, then when it strat to log in to windows the screen goes black, I have repair and reinstall the OS,drivers and even update the BIOS, still I have the problem, if I log in on safe mode the screen comes up and then I disable the display drivers only like this I can log in in to normal windows if I enable the display drivers again, it just goes black once again.....any ideas what might be the cause and how can it be solved?
Apriciate any help given...Thank you.
Dan.
