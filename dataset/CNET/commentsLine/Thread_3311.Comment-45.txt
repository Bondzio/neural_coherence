yea it was valueram, but part of my thinking there was i could get my foot in the door with dc ddr there for less than standard ddr and later on swap it out for higher end dc ddr.
same with the seagate hd which is also why i'm probably not going to go with a 10k rpm drive this time.
as they become more common place i'll at least have the interface and chipset to take advantage of them later on.
chances are i'll only be using about 75% of what the nforce4 is capable of, but that add'l 25% should make upgrades fairly easy as all the interfaced are borderline cutting edge which the components are more midstream.
the ram, cpu, and hd are the main components that i could see myself updating in a year or so.
maybe spend $200 on better/more ddr next summer, upgrade to a 10k ncq drive the year after, the x700 to a 6800 ultra oc a year after that.
i'm also tinkering with the idea of cutting back the cpu by 1 to leave that option for upgrade available later on too.
we'll see how much i would save and whetehr it woudl be cost effective or not.
nothing below the 3000+ mark though.
probably a 3200+ if anything.
might be able to offset high than expected costs a bit by doing that...
