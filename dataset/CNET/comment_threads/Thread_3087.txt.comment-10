Whenever I help one of my friends with their computer, I install SpywareBlaster, Spybot-Search & Destroy, and Ad-aware.
If they don't have antivirus protection, I install AVG Free.
On my own computer, I also have Atomic Clock Sync, Moffsoft FreeCalc, Notesholder Lite (handy reminders and notes), ShortKeys Lite (simple way to enter things like often-used addresses), Weatherbug, Webshots, Citi Virtual Account Numbers (from my Citibank credit card service), Auction Sentry for eBay, and Photoshop Elements.
On my kids' computer, I also have Webroot Spy Sweeper for additional protection with scheduled updating and scanning for spyware threats.
The vast majority of my favorite utilities are free.
