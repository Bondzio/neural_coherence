1.1.1	I have a Cisco 3750 Wireless controler with multiple access points .	St
1.1.2	Everything is up and running except for when I restart and laptop with wireless connections I get the IP Address conflict popup on my computers .	St
1.1.3	I am setup with Static IP addresses and am positive there are no duplicate nodes .	St
1.1.4	The laptop will connect in the morning fine but if I restart the laptop it conflicts .	St
1.1.5	Looking for alittle advice if there is a function of the wireless that would hold the address looking for the old connection and not refresh with the new connection ?	Ques
1.1.6	network still works fine and I am able to access and my data but the popup is an annoyance and I think it is messing with my wireless printers when they go into standby and conflicting connections .	St
1.2.1	And through no fault of your own .	St
1.2.2	If you are using anything less than WPA security then I see many rogue users ( see SMAC and other tools like it ) can hijack what an admin may think was a reserved IP .	St
1.2.3	After the IT staff gets a little more seasoned they return to DHCP and WPA to avoid all the lost hours .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	This is happening on all my laptops in the buliding , over a dozen .	St
1.3.2	I need to keep static IP 's due to my process scope .	St
1.3.3	pinging the IP 's all timeout as soon as I turn off the laptops so there is nothing on that IP .	St
1.3.4	Any other sugestions ?	Ques
1.3.5	I will tighten up and change security and see if this helps but I am only seeing my computers on my Domain with no other traffic .	St
1.3.6	Thanks	Polite
