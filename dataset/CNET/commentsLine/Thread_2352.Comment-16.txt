anyone/everyone call hp's ceo office 877-917-4380 and ask for &quot;edward&quot; ext.79 this is the hp quality control office and they need to be made aware that more than 2 people have a problem with f1530!
i was actually surprised that someone actually responded to my complaint to ceo mark hurd (via phone!
).
