i've been looking on google and can't find any info specificly on this what kind of performance could i expect from: 5200 AMD X2 8800 GTS and 2 GB of RAM (running dual channel) running an 8 player skirmish with everything on high or max at 1280 x 1024 resolution?
cuz every benchmark i find has minimum resolution of 1600 x 1400 or something and doesn't show if it's skirmish etc
