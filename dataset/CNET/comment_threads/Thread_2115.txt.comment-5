This is the problem now... tried several of the suggestions, but even though the drive seems active, I do not see it in Disk Management.
So I can't really use any recovery software.
I haven't loaded any drivers for the Adaptec as the drivers supplied specify its only for Win98, and the Adaptec site doesn't seem to offer anything else.
Is it possible that this could be a WinXP Pro vs Home thing?
I'm not sure how the disk got formatted as dynamic instead of basic, but could this be why?
