<s> I left the notebook turned on for the night, so and when I have woken up I noticed that it is just was hanged. </s>
<s> Anytime I tried to reboot it - it always stayed in the moment of staring up progress running and running for ages. </s>
<s> I tried all variants of WIN7 booting up - results are the same, the only thing I could admit was the last string in &quot;Start with command string support&quot; Mode, and it was: &quot;Loading CLASSPNP.SYS&quot;. </s>
<s> This info doesn't give me anytinhg. </s>
<s> I've tried to start from Live CD, half of programs don't boot at all, Mini Windows XP, Mini Windows 7, acronis, smth else don't want to start. </s>
<s> MHDD says that disk is very well, Memory test likes whole 2GB.. Well, it's strange, but Live Linux isn't capricious, well.. Ubuntu set up fine without any problems at all.. </s>
<s> I could save all info from installed Ubuntu (funny..). </s>
<s> Finally, I wiped all HDD, guessing that maybe there were some errors in partitions or elsewhere, but... Nope.. </s>
<s> In search of truth I started PC Check, and checked Video Memory, RAM, and.. it hangs between memory test where there is System Mem, Cache mem, I don't undestand where exactly! </s>
<s> So, MB, CPU or BIOS? </s>
<s> I'll appreciate any of your answer, except &quot;warranty&quot;, &quot;guarantee&quot;, &quot;service center&quot;... </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I don't see make, model, age, STORY so it sounds like a fried part but since it's a laptop (can't tell if it's some netbook?) </s>
<s> I'm going to write to try another motherboard. </s>

<s> Back cover title says it's MSI-U210X, and it's not quite mine I could tell you an age, but Bios ver - 2009 Dec, so I can assume it's about 2-2.5 years.. And, I guess, you'll stand the point of changing MB whatever.. Mmm, for me - to change MB is to give someone for repairing.. Is here something I could change by myself? </s>
<s> And came away with that feeling it's the common few year netbook. </s>
<s> The ATI video in it was not known for its lack of issues (heat, etc.) </s>
<s> Try the generic reset in the forum at http://forums.cnet.com/7723-19681_102-352085/welcome-to-the-laptop-troubleshooting-forum-at-cnet/?tag=contentBody;threadListing but leave the battery out since it's likely to be the original and would be too old to be left in the machine. </s>
<s> Can cause board failures too. </s>

<s> Well, I've reset the book with the method you described there(by the link) (THANX A LOT) and it began to work as if nothing was happen.. </s>
<s> So I inserted USB boot-flash with WIN 7 and before installation decided to find out what's the temperature of CPU, cause that terrible heat drives me crazy.. </s>
<s> So, I started AIDA64 (ex Everest, from the menu below the Installation choice), and went to &quot;Sensor Information&quot;. </s>
<s> I didn't manage to see any info, coz it freezed, but after rebooting I found out that book is yet again don't want to start, so I RESET it again and it again began to live... </s>
<s> So, one thing I recollected is that I installed AIDA64 about two hours before notebook hanged AT FIRST time... </s>
<s> I don't think AIDA64 spoils hardware, but.. what can it be? </s>
<s> 1) Book is fine 2) Starting AIDA64, looking for some info (first time it was Stress-test or Stability-test) 3) Book is not fine, and only RESET backs it to life 4) Normal working at all.. O.o 5) Again AIDA(simple sensor look up) and again failure till RESET? </s>
<s> Now I work on it for about a day, installed all drivers, programs, nothing seems to be wrong at all... </s>
<s> Your opinion? </s>
<s> Sorry but I only get a glimpse of that machine from what you write. </s>
<s> It is a few years old from what I can tell and I don't write at first about using CANNED AIR because I hope that folk will tell me they did the usual cleaning. </s>
<s> Those temp measuring software can fail. </s>
<s> Nothing new here and I won't start yet another discussion. </s>
<s> Please remove such because its probing can cause a good machine to hang. </s>
<s> Now about that CANNED AIR. </s>
