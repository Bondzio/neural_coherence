I finally got around to hooking up a different monitor to the PC and sure enough, the new monitor works fine with no stand-by issues.
It goes to sleep and wakes up instantly.
So the problem lies with either the other monitor itself or the cables attached to this monitor.
So for now, I just gave him my monitor that has no issues with stand-by.
Thanks again for everyone's help and suggestions!
