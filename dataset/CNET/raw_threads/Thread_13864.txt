10467	0	111579	1267961	NR	wahnula	6/27/05 9:51 PM	1.11990906E12	OK, I've decided to build a new server..	...to replace the NT 4.0 dinosaur that Sensei Proffit has helped me keep alive. SPECS: Pentium Pro200(two of them) 512K EDO RAM, Running Windows NT, Microsoft Backoffice Server and Microsoft Exchange to provide a smooth running, reliable machine that works 24/7 on our small, 8-workstation network. We get around the 5-user thing with Exchange 'cause not all 8 folks are in the office at the same time. I want to upgrade the machine, that part I can handle. I'll use Win2K,(maybe XP but I don't see alot of difference) a Pentium D or HT 3.0 GHZ, Intel Mobo, 2 SATA 36GB raptors striped and at least 2GB of RAM. Backup will be Veritas BE 9.1 daily to tape, Sony SCSI 11000. So, how do I ''move in'' to the new machine? Should I use the NT SCOPY feature then upgrade the OS, or should I start from scratch and install Win2000, Microsoft Backoffice and Microsft exchange then just drag and drop the appropriate folders? What would you do? Thanks! Tony

Microsoft's Server OS map looks like this: NT (various) Server -&gt; 2000 (various) Server -&gt; 2003 (varous) Server. If you need more storage, split that onto a new machine and leave the Dual Pro with what doesn't move. Bob

W2K server or W2003 server would be better. but it's $$$$$. If your makeing a new server PC this would be the time to do the change over. Bring the new one online with the NT server and do a change over then take the NT offline. John

Funny how Microsoft makes you buy the whole suit, not just the pants or jacket... I will be sure the MB supports NT, I hope I can find one w/ SATA. I'll be back when it's built, you can count on that! Thanks all... Tony
