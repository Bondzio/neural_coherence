we still don't know your actual pc model#.
it makes a difference knowing the details.
also, because i assume you're now using sata, that it wasn't before???
if not, its the 1st time now using a sata device, check the bios and see if any &quot;legacy or ide mode&quot; for sata is present, if so enable it.
if you have an sata hd, that could conflict because the servicing or polling of devices gets hammered as ide devices still present lag the system and on top of all this is xp os, not overall friendly to sata as it wasn't native to it.
alas, you had a problem prior to all this, so i ask was sata present then?
what happens if you disconnect the ide type cd/dvd drive?
