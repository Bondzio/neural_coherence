your help / advice is sought.
i have a sony 50&quot; lcd wega hd-tv with a hdmi jack that i would like to use as a computer monitor.
i am not in need of the functionality of a windows media pc.
windows xp pro will work fine.
my main interest/goal is to be able to use a pc, probably a desktop, as a gateway to my home network with an emphasis on displaying the browser and crusing the internet.
any suggestions or directions where i can find a confirmation of a solid pc configuration and any tweaks i need to be aware of or plan for?
thanks!
