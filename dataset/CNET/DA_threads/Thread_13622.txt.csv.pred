1.3.5	.How do you think of it ?	Ques
1.4.1	You have a working HD , then back-up any critical data .	St
1.4.2	You want the easy way out .	St
1.4.3	The plain fact is any so-called s/w that does this will claim , & quot ; back-up & quot ; before use anyways .	St
1.4.4	You proceed at your own risk using whatever s/w .	St
1.4.5	Take that as a warning and decide whta you want to do .	St
1.4.6	Quite franky , if you have another HD , then clone one drive to another .	St
1.4.7	Once you verify everything is OK , then re-use the HD and reformat it to the way you want it .	St
1.4.8	You mentioned W98 disk and FDISK , these are old OS tools , so just what are your end uses ?	Ques
1.4.9	devide a 64Gb HD may not if you use XP or better in more than 2 partitions would n't provide much storage once done , etc .	St
1.4.10	Even , if you did this and then try using in W98 setup , that wo n't work period or hic-up in some way .	St
1.4.11	.	St
1.4.12	Checkout Parition Magic and/or Gparted or even Norton 's old Ghost s/w .	St
1.4.13	Freebies or shareware , check website filebases for all that .	St
1.4.14	I look at these or goolge away : http : //www.jumbo.com http : //www.majorgeeks.com http : //www.tucows.com Check below and find the DOWNLOADS area of CNet as well for any helpful s/w .	St

1.7.1	Glad you got the results you wanted .	St
1.7.2	I want to point out , too often when it comes to saving data after some mishap or misstep it becomes even harder to recover it 's out of the end user 's hands any more .	St
1.7.3	As a tech that tries when the poor results or even during a 2nd attempt at recovery is nil or hapless as any s/w wo n't do especially if there is a h/w fault at core of problem .	St
1.7.4	You seem to have a working HD , but some condition that made it less capable or as expected .	St
