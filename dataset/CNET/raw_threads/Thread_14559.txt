There are no plans (Microsoft) &quot;to fix cosmetic issues.&quot; If you do obtain such a machine from Dell or such and this matters to you, why not make it a warranty issue or claim it's a Dead On Arrival and you want it to not have this defect?

Since they don't make your machine, they won't fix this or that. -&gt; There are a few that want a bugfree or efficient OS. Such has yet to be seen. Bob
