i have friends all the time wanting good systems but they don't have a lot of money.
the problem with going with the 64 is the price of the processor plus the motherboard and memory.
within another year you can pick these up for half the price today.
the question is how fast do you want it.
there was a comment on the gigabyte mainboard that was true.
you can save money by going with the geforce pro2 and a 3200+ so that you can upgrade the processor later.
the 3200+ is the base for the 400mhz fsb i believe.
this particular motherboard has the 133mhz ite raid for 4 hard drives.
check best buy for rebate specials on the wd or seagate 120gb drives.
i picked up a total of 4 120gb drives for 29.99 each.
the sata drives right now are adapted ide drives.
you can pick up the same adapters to convert the ide to sata (which this motherboard has) so that you can have additional space.
i can run doom 3 and any other game on my gigabyte mb with the 6800 nvidia card very nicely in either my 2600+ (333mhz fsb) with 1gb mem or the 3200+ (400mhz fsb)with 512mb mem.
i didn't bother with the audigy 2 because the sound on the motherboard would still do all of the processing that i needed to build dvd movies, convert and alter.
if money is a factor then drop it down to a 2600+ w/333fsb.
hardware costs will significantly drop and still enable you to upgrade later.
otherwise, double your costs and build a monster!
this is just my 5 cents worth...
