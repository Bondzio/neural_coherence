<s> I have 3 oki color laser printers. </s>
<s> A c3200, a c3400 and a c5500 all color laser printers. </s>
<s> All three are either out of toner or the c3200 needs image drums for yellow, cyan and magenta. </s>
<s> It seems the cost of all the drums or all the toner cartridges would be 2 times the cost of a new printer. </s>
<s> Is my logic wrong or is there a better way to get the consumables to a reasonable cost that is not more than a brand new printer? </s>
<s> It just doesn't seem right that the cost of the image drums are more than the entire cost of a new printer. </s>
<s> PLEASE advise. </s>
<s> I assure you it wasn't always the case that &quot;toner&quot; or ink for that natter were less costly compared to new printer. </s>
<s> The fact is new printers as in those newly coming out now are being dumped at low cost as so many are being made. </s>
<s> However, the cost of &quot;consumable&quot; like ink and toner are meant to get $ from you on the back in. </s>
<s> However, you can shop for the best value but consider if the Okis are doing well and just run of toner, they are robust printers compared to others. </s>
<s> The fact, all you have to do is replace toner and go on is a plus. </s>
<s> However, you can rethink that after x-number you got you use out of it. </s>
<s> That's entirely up to you or pass on the old printer to someone or donate, etc.. IMHO, I don't fret over a few $, but if you have 50 printers or so, it becomes what you deem practical. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> Thanks Willy. </s>
<s> Toner is one thing but now that I have to replace the image drums on 3 of the 4 colors all priced at $165 or more, plus the toner drums on each color, wow. </s>
<s> That hurts. </s>
<s> Is there any place you'd recommend that image drums or toner for Oki' laser printers are not so darn high? </s>
<s> I agree the Oki printers print extremely well but money is tight. </s>
<s> I do appreciate any advice for this area is not my expertise. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
