<s> I have a desktop pc and my wife has a notebook set up on a home network.I am curious to know why both machines dont get the same email messsages. </s>
<s> Both machines are turned on. </s>
<s> do msgs not go to both machines on a network? </s>
<s> thanks in advance Virgil Hummel </s>
<s> whichever account they are set to go to. </s>
<s> IOW.... you need to duplicate the email settings on each PC then leave a copy on the server for a specified time period so that each PC will pick up the messages when logged in. </s>
<s> What do you mean &quot;leave a copy of settings on server&quot;? </s>
<s> your server routinly. </s>
<s> If you didn't do it, then your mail server quota will be full. </s>
<s> So, it is better to configure it only on one pc. </s>
<s> The configuration is on OE menu--&gt; tools, accounts, click your account, properties, advance. </s>
<s> to hold a copy for 5 days, that's enough time for me. </s>
<s> How it works is each PC when accessing OE will download any messages available. </s>
<s> Each PC will only download a particular email once. </s>
<s> After 5 days (for me) the mail is removed from the server. </s>
<s> The settings are where Melati pointed. </s>
