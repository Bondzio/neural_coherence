...geforces don't.
probably 95% of the time, a geforce will render exactly as a quadro with no issues.
but sometimes, you might encounter quirks or anamolies.
nvidia will not address any quirk produced by geforce drivers in autocad, maya, etc.
but it will address issues with quadro drivers.
likewise, most 3d app vendors test and certify quadro drivers to ensure they work without issues.
the typical quirks can usually be worked around or avoided by changing resolution, screen layout, or just living with a display anamoly.
a card like a $130 geforce gts 250 uses the exact same gpu as a quadro that's 4 times (or more) expensive.
to me the bottom line is this: if you make your living from your 3d apps, then get a quadro.
time is money and you don't want to futzing about with a video card issue when you're on a delivery deadline.
missing it could cost you a lot more than the price of a quadro.
but if you can live with an occassional quirk here or there (and the occassional frustration), then get a geforce.
