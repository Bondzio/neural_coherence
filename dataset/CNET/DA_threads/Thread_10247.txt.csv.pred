1.1.1	I can not find a picture at the ATI site for the ATI Radeon X1600 PRO ( 512 MB ) video card .	St
1.1.2	In the spec , it says & quot ; Dual-link DVI & quot ; , but on page http : //www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=1830017 & Sku=A177-3094 & SRCCODE=PRICEGRABBER & CMP=OTC-PRICEGRABBER it certainly does not look as if there are two DVI-I output connectors on the card .	St
1.1.3	However , on page http : //reviews.cnet.com/ATI_Radeon_X1600_Pro_256_MB/4505-8902_7-31530065.html where model 256 MB was reviewed , it clearly shows two DVI-I output connectors ( no picture where cnet reviews the 512 MB model ; further , it does not seem as if the 256 MB model is sold anymore ) .	St
1.1.4	Does anyone know if there are two or only one DVI-I outlet connector on the 5212 MB mocel ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks for reply .	St
1.1.6	Hans L	St
1.2.1	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVI Look under connector for explanation .	St
1.3.1	and as the other poster pointed out , dual-link dvi is a port that support super-high-res displays ( typically 24 & quot ; widescreens and up ) .	St
1.4.1	I use those cards all of the time .	St
1.4.2	They have VGA and DVI .	St
1.4.3	Be sure that you have a good power supply , because they will pull down some juice on boot .	St
1.4.4	The Sapphire X1600 Pro is the best in that category .	St
1.4.5	They are very good video cards .	Polite
1.5.1	Thanks for your input , guys .	St
1.5.2	I have preliminarily deceded to go with eVGA GeForce 7600 GT CO or KO as the main card ( two DVI output ports ) and two monitors , and the GS for the secondary port ( one DVI port ) and the third monitor .	St
