You can replace the PSU anytime to verify the power issue(increase wattage and amps), if that's the case.
You seem to have a &quot;stuffed system&quot; and may take awhile to come up to speed or simply be acknowledged by the bios, the 4gb of ram being suspect and 4 drives.
Very possibility all together abit too much at the start.
The beta bios update if it didn't ID what it does, stay away from such updates of any kind.
A bios update has to address an issue you've encountered.
