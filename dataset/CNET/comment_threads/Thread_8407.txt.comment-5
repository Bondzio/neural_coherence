into a different system are quite usual.
Maybe remove the old, clear out that partition, do a new install and Windows Product Activiation.
The new mobo certainly uses the 12 volts to supply power to the CPU's onboard regulators [the old one may have used 3.3 or 5 volts for that].
Does your PS have two separate plus 12 volt rails or just one?
I would like a +/- 3% tolerance [0.360 volts], so going below 11.64 may not be too good.
What tolerance does the supply show on its nameplate??
?
