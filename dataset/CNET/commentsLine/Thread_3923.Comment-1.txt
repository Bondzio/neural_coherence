i have a viewsonic p95f+ monitor.
19&quot; crt i keep the brightness at medium level, but it regularly goes darker (grey/washed out) and it gets harder to read the print (seems blurry).
i haven't nailed down a pattern, but i'd say every 15-20 minutes or so.
it lasts 1-10 minutes, then goes back to my regular brightness.
the monitor is probably 5-7 years old, but i've had no problems until now.
i recently put in a new power supply and graphics card in my pc, but i can't say if this started before or after those changes.
could this be a problem with a driver/the graphics card/power supply, or is it just time to get a new monitor?
any tips on how to diagnose?
thanks, eddie
