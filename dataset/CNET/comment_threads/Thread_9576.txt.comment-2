You said it will print a test page.
Do you mean from it's built-in feature or from your PC?
If it's just from your PC it won't work, it could be a driver, faulty port (parallel usually).
Give more details about how it's connected.
I'm fairly certain these required an enhanced printer port setting in ones BIOS.
