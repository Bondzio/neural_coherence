hi there, i've installed the software for scanner but i'm having problems with the hardware.
i plugged it in an available usb port and got the following message.
''usb device not recognized.
one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and windows does not recognize it.
try again.....'' i tried the other port but nothing happened at all with that one.
i uninstalled software, reinstalled and used the other port first, till wouldn't work.
i can't install the scanner using hardware wizard cos the brand name isn't in the list (even when showing all names.)
the scanner is a mustek 1200 ub plus.
i have the system requirements it asks for, winxp etc.
would someone be able to help me please??
thanks in advance, kiai xx
