We have used them as well as several other brands including HP and Xerox continues to provide clean clear and brilliant photos. The printers aren't the cheapest, but I can tell you that we always get compliments on proposals we prepare on one of our Phaser printers. We have an older Xerox 6250n and a newer Xerox 8560n and photos printed with photo paper at photo quality look amazing. Results on bright paper are nearly as good. Check it out. Good luck!
