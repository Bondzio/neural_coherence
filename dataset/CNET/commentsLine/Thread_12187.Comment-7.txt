have you tried the reserve of from hp to dell?
does it happen to hang at midnight when doing so?
how about trying to copy like 5mins before midnight and see if it goes through that time and copy.
is your hub provided with and option of taking in external power source?
does both transfer stops at 8gb at different starting point and stops at midnight?
did you see what file it's trying to migrate over when it stops?
it could be one of those huge files which takes too long that the software cutsoff transfer due to long inactivity.
