1.2.1	What were you trying to fix and what symptoms have changed .	St
1.2.2	If disconnecting/reconnecting is all that was done before these problems occurred , it 's usually a matter of rechecking ones own work .	St
1.2.3	One common problem can be with the power connectors to a drive .	St
1.2.4	The female ends will begin to make poor contact because there is a split in them that allows them to spread a bit .	St
1.2.5	You can usually pinch these back into shape .	St
1.2.6	Other connectors might not be seating properly as well .	St
1.2.7	You can reseat cards connected to the MB as well .	St
1.2.8	That 's where I would start .	St
