<s> My iBook started making a strange, new noise about a week ago. </s>
<s> It has started making the noise more and more frequently. </s>
<s> I have not a clue what it may be and any hint will be appreciated. </s>
<s> The machine is a 1.2 ghz G4 iBook - 12 inch screen - approx. </s>
<s> 3 years old - model M9623LL/A The sound is like an electrical motor starting up. </s>
<s> Very low in volume to begin and gets louder (but never too loud). </s>
<s> If I could type out the sound, it may sound something like this... &quot;ma - waaaaAAAHHH&quot; It starts out low pitched and gets higher pitched and then drifts off until the sound disappears. </s>
<s> The sound lasts anywhere from a second to as much as three seconds before it disappears. </s>
<s> The sound seems to be coming from the lower, left hand corner where an air intake is positioned. </s>
<s> Is there a fan or transformer located in that location? </s>
<s> There is no disc in the cd drive and the hard drive continues to make it's regular faint clicking sound. </s>
<s> I use Smart Reporter to keep track of the physical well being of my hard drive. </s>
<s> I use iStat Pro to keep track of other system functions. </s>
<s> I am using my second battery after the first one was recalled. </s>
<s> iStat Pro says my current battery health is only 84%. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any information anyone can give me. </s>
<s> I can live with the noise but if it foreshadows future problems, I would like to catch it early. </s>
<s> thanks in advance... grim </s>
<s> the lower left hand corner of the G4 iBook is exactly where the HD is located. </s>
<s> As to what the sound may be, it sure sounds like a fan getting itself settled but the only fan on that machine is located at the rear of the machine, just to the left of the words iBook G4. </s>
<s> Curious P </s>
<s> My MBP has two fans, and both are opposite each other; one by the power button, and one on the left side. </s>
<s> Of course that's what it always appeared to be. </s>
<s> If your iBook had been built the same way, I'd say the fan was doing it, but mrmacfixit said the fan is positioned more at the rear by the iBook logo. </s>
<s> If the HD is doing it, you can try to run some scans and test for bad blocks. </s>
<s> It could be rotating abnormally because of this. </s>
<s> My fans will start up and go crazy if I'm constantly using all of my processor's power and all of my RAM, but not for just one to three seconds. </s>
<s> Sounds like your HD could be having issues, or your fan. </s>
<s> If want, you could take it into the Apple Store for a diagnostic if you can't find the problem. </s>
<s> Even better if you had any AppleCare left, but you probably don't. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
