it looks like an interesting project for the properly motivated.
here's what i found by doing a quick check through the intel docs.
current bios: 4r4cb0xa.15a.0010.p03.9809011626 09/01/98 newer bios available: 4r4cb0xa.86a.0020.p14 6/27/2000 the ''motherboard specification update'' pdf says that the new bios should enable the board to take ''slot 1'' (242-contact) piii processors up to 600mhz.
the bios also enables the memory slots to take a 256mb module for a total of 512mb.
it's up to you, but the money that you spend on the upgrades of the old computer could get you a long way towards the low-end pentium 4 or amd cpu systems that have been suggested in this discussion.
anyhow, the bios update is free: rcbios14.exe
