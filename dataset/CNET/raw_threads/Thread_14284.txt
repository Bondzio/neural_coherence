On the old computer I had some applications that loaded up fine. Yet, on the XP computer I get an error banner that says, &quot;16 bit Windows Subsystem&quot; The body of the error window says, &quot;C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\AUTOEXEC.NT. The system file is not suitable for running MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows applications. Choose 'Close' to terminate the application.&quot; At the bottom are two buttons - Close and Ignore (Nothing happens with ignore). Both of these programs worked fine in the earlier version. I tried the &quot;Compatibility&quot; function with no luck. I tried loading it without the XP 2 patch, and again after. These are simple apps that use a setup program. I'm out of ideas...anybody else?

Then copy and paste into Windows/system32. this worked for me. Also if you don't feel comfortable then read &quot;soolshock&quot;'s response. There is an URL that will allow a simple download that will replace the NT file and put it back..

989	12	47802	784764	724806	babidgood	2/23/05 8:25 AM	1.1091471E12	Cause of this error	We have found that there are two reasons for this; 1. Running antispyware programs sometimes removes these files autoexec.nt, ntconfig.nt and command.com 2. Upgrading to XP sp2 - we are not sure why this knocks out these files but it does... The fix is to replace these three files as stated in a Microsoft KB article: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;324767 You can also download a quick fix from here that does the trick. You will need your XP cd ready for either way. http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/System-Tweak/16-bit-MS-DOS-Subsystem-Error-Quick-Fix.shtml Thanks, Bruce Bidgood

All applications that came pre-loaded and the once I loaded worked fine until 3 days ago. Then, out of the blue I get an error banner that says, &quot;16 bit Windows Subsystem&quot; The body of the error window says, &quot;C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\AUTOEXEC.NT. The system file is not suitable for running MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows applications. Choose 'Close' to terminate the application.&quot; At the bottom are two buttons - Close and Ignore (Nothing happens with ignore). I tried the &quot;Compatibility&quot; function with no luck. I must have changed something, which I do from time ti time, that may have something to do with it but suddenly it will refuse to recognize older programs. The once in question, I believe, are the 16 bit based once and I have a few of those. Could anyone help me with this please, it is very vital for me because I use some of the old graphic programs, card games, etc, etc. Any help will be much apreciated. Sincerely, Helen

First, I lost 2 working days fixing for &quot;hotoffers&quot; spy-ware. After finally fixed the spyware problems using Spydoctor, Adaware & Hijackthis, this &quot;Autoexec.nt&quot; problem occurred. I think it was caused by one of the anti-spyware accidentally removing it. Fortunately, Your tip fixed it. Thanks for suggesting the link. I could've used the Microsoft's suggested solution ( http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;324767 ), but being such a novice user, I am sure I would've done more damage than repaired it. madcnet JAVA - INDONESIA
