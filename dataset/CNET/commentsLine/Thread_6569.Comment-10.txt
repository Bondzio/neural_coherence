wow... sorry all for triple posting... but i re-read through all of your comments and found out what the problem was.
i was wiring the internet connection from wired router 1, port 1, to the netgear router in the internet port, not in one of the numbered ports... if that makes any sense.
thanks everyone, you all have been so helpful
