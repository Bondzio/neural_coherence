<s> I upgraded my firmware on my router, (Netgear WGR614v6), to version wgr614v6_2_0_19_1_0_19_na.chk and everything works great except I cannot send email. </s>
<s> I used MS Outlook with pop3 mail settings: incoming port 110, outgoing port: 25. </s>
<s> All the default stuff. </s>
<s> I'm able to send email from other places, which leads me to believe it might be he firmware upgrade. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> On the Outgoing Server tab make sure the check box for &quot;My outgoing server(SMTP)requires authentication&quot; in cleared. </s>
