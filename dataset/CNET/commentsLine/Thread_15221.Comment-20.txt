yes you did bruno.
i don't know which way i'm going yet as i've been told to buy an original oem for the mb or throw my money to the ponies.
the ones i've seen are pricey so maybe a new pc & somehow figure out how to transfer the hd to a new barebones------------------but i understand that's a pain in itself as well.
i'll let you know how things turn out & thanks again.
