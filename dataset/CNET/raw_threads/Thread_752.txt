Once you run the wires, you can even add wireless access points at those places where you need better wireless coverage. If you want to avoid the work though, you may want to try out power line network adapters. They have worked well for me in a variety of situations, and allow you the flexibility of moving the adapters to different areas of the house to give you connectivity. You can even add WAPs to these as well for wireless coverage in weak areas.

Good luck!!!
