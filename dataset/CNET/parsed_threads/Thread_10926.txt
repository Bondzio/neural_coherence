<s> My Maxtor USB 750GB external drive has stopped responding. </s>
<s> The situation is as follows. </s>
<s> When I turn on the drive: -the drive light comes on -the computer makes the Windows XP 'dum-dum' sound -no drive letter is assigned -the drive is not visible under 'My Computer' -the drive is not visible under Device Manager -the drive is not visible under Disk Management -more ominously, the drive is ticking like a clock when I put my ear up to it I have tried with a different computer, and the result is the same. </s>
<s> I have tried with a different USB cable, and the result is the same. </s>
<s> My system is Windows XP SP3, fully up to date. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what to do. </s>
<s> Are there any utilities that might allow me to see the drive, even when it is (apparently) not assigned a drive letter? </s>
<s> Is it really and truly dead? </s>
<s> How might I salvage the data? </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be most welcome. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> It covers the usuals. </s>
