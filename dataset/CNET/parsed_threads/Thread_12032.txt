<s> Here's the problem: 1 - I boot the computer and get the message &quot;keyboard failure, connect mouse to proper port. </s>
<s> Press f1 to continue. </s>
<s> My mouse is wireless and connects via USB receiver. </s>
<s> My keyboard is operartive. </s>
<s> 2 - Pressing F1 continues the boot process successfully 3 - I want to eliminate this problem keyboard/mouse issue by resetting the BIOS to default settings, however I cannot get to the BIOS during a boot, by pressing the F2 key. </s>
<s> I get the keyboard /mouse message. </s>
<s> System - XP Svc. </s>
<s> Pack 2 Ram 756 MB Computer - Dell Dimension 8200. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me with this connundrum? </s>
<s> a regular mouse to the PS2 port and then get into the BIOS so that you can tell it to not report errors? </s>
<s> that's the reason I never use USB mouse or keyboard. </s>
<s> Tried that first with no success. </s>
<s> Thanks anyway </s>
<s> Thanks but your answer tells me nothing. </s>
<s> I've been using USB connections for 2 years and never had the problem. </s>
<s> Tried a regular mouse and keyboard connection with no success. </s>
<s> Any more suggestions. </s>
<s> have a jumper that lets you reset to factory default. </s>
<s> Look in the Dell service manual for your model on how to access and use the jumper. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I will investigate. </s>
<s> Its not a Usb mouse or keyboard , hes talking about WIRELESS!. </s>
<s> and you dont use Usb because of? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> unplug the jumper on the mobo , or take out the small silver battery. </s>
<s> that resets it. </s>
<s> 1 question though, was your setup working before? </s>
<s> and if so what happend to cause the problem? </s>
<s> or is this a new setup for you?. </s>
<s> just curious. </s>
<s> sounds like you changed something ? </s>
<s> and now you want to fix it. </s>
<s> Report Keyboard Errors -&gt; Displays keyboard errors when set to Report. </s>
<s> The default is Report. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> No, this is not a new anything. </s>
<s> The anomaly just happened, why I do not know. </s>
<s> There is one odd item. </s>
<s> A mouse hooked into the standard mouse connection does not work. </s>
<s> If this is a clue to anything let me know. </s>
<s> Read his message. </s>
<s> He clearly says USB not WIRELESS&gt; </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what you are telling me? </s>
<s> Is this an avenue to correct my problem? </s>
<s> use a diff keyboard just for kicks and Most mobos have atleast 2 Usb ports , have you tried using a diff usb port?. </s>
<s> a standard mouse connection is ps2... if you do have a bad keyboard you need to check and see. </s>
<s> try a diff keyboard. </s>
<s> make sure nothing extra is plugged in except the mouse and keyboard. </s>
<s> start with the basic's. </s>
<s> your computer will start with out a mouse but not the keyboard or atleast not a faulty keyboard. </s>
<s> try booting with just the keyboard with nothing else connected. </s>
<s> it should go into windows. </s>
<s> not having a mouse doesnt stop windows or your computer from working. </s>
<s> if your computer starts with just a keyboard. </s>
<s> then cool. </s>
<s> if it doesnt then you know your keyboard is faulty and may not be mouse problem at all. </s>
<s> if your computer starts with the keyboard then turn off and plug in the mouse. </s>
<s> have you reset the bios as in my other post?. </s>
<s> All of your suggestions are great but are not relevent since I have tried all of your suggestions with no success. </s>
<s> No I haven't reset the bios yet but I will. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> so you tried booting with just the keyboard and it worked ok?. </s>
<s> the only prob you have is getting into the Bios?. </s>
<s> so take side panel of your case and pull the batt and leave out for about 30seconds then put back in. </s>
<s> and before you boot up just use keyboard and mouse. </s>
<s> The BIOS settings for reporting keyboard failure is set to enable by default. </s>
<s> This setting needs to be changed to disable. </s>
<s> If I remember correctly you have tried a PS2 KB with the same error. </s>
<s> If this is so you may have a damaged port. </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Will check & do. </s>
<s> and there lies the problem of using USB (especial for keyboard function). </s>
