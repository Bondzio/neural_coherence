<s> I am in the process of rebuilding my PC. </s>
<s> I have a new Asrock K7S41GX motherboard; 400W Power supply unit; 512MB DDR 333Mhz & 256Mb PC2100 & an 80GB HDD. </s>
<s> I am fairly comfortable with building PCs from scratch as I have successfully done quite a number previous in the past. </s>
<s> However, this time around, I am having difficulties. </s>
<s> The problem I am encountering is that, when I switch the PC on, it just kicks in and the powers off. </s>
<s> If I press the power button again, it does not respond - it's just dead. </s>
<s> If I pull out the mains power supply cable off the case completely and replug, it restarts and powers off again. </s>
<s> I have checked all my connections according to the manual and am certain it's all correct. </s>
<s> This has left me baffled hence the SOS. </s>
<s> Anybody with an antidote will be welcome. </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
<s> The first thing I would do is disconnect anything that the power supply is connected to (hard drives/optical drives), pull out any add on cards, and also the memory. </s>
<s> Then try to boot. </s>
<s> See if it stays on ( you should get a continuos beep for no memory) If it doesn't stay on, it's either the power supply, switch on the case, or the motherboard. </s>
<s> There is also a chance that the motherboard is touching the metal of your case, so take the board out of the case. </s>
<s> Be careful to set it on a non conductive surface and try it again. </s>
<s> If you get the same results, its either one of the above. </s>
<s> Get a power supply tester from your local computer shop to test the power supply. </s>
<s> If it does stay powered on with a repeatitive beep, add one thing at a tme until you get the probelm reproduced. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
<s> It sounds like your power supply isn't compatible with your motherboard.Check and see what wattage is needed for that motherboard. </s>
<s> I have done all you have suggested. </s>
<s> Having stripped the PC of everything, the mobo still has the said problem. </s>
<s> I even switched the PSU, istalled a tried and tested one, the problem still persists. </s>
<s> If the reset jumper in the bios is closed the mobo will not start, try checking that. </s>
<s> I've had the same problem 2 times with separate asrock mobo but always was the power supply the issue. </s>
<s> I discovered that if I left the on button pushed for 5 seconds and then pushed again I can recreate kick off problem (the computer powers on briefly and the shut down). </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Thats what it sounds like to me anyway. </s>
<s> I would like to thank you all for your assistance. </s>
<s> The problem has finally been solved. </s>
<s> Appararently, my CPU fan was inadequate, the processor over-heated and cut-off. </s>
<s> Once again, thanks for the suggestions. </s>
<s> I am sure they will come handy one day. </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>
