there are no firewalls...with dialup and the type of internet use implemented, they aren't critical.
if i am on pc1 and want to use the laser on pc2, i access the laser in network places, it asks for login and password, i enter the name pc1 (machine name), no password, and i have access to the laser.
rebooting takes that access away and re-logging in needs to be done.
if i don't use the access method above, the &quot;access denied&quot; error appears with no alternatives.
there must be something i missed in the permissions' setup to make pc2 have to ask for the login to gain access, i just can't find what it is.
i have the resource kit for w2k servers, so i know how much these resource kits cost, and i'm not going to buy another one, not for a few, nearly outdated o/s's.
same goes for any books covering w2k.
vista, yes.
with all the knowledge and suggestions available on the good sites on the 'net, i was hoping some one could help with this a bit.
thanks for your reply.
