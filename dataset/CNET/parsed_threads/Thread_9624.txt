<s> I am looking for a sleek external bluray drive, it must be able to write dvd &amp; cd's as well. </s>
<s> I bought a laptop without an optical drive and I want to be able to throw an external drive in my laptop case and have it for trips (watching blurays, burning cds, etc). </s>
<s> I have 2 questions: 1) I have USB 3.0 capabilities, should I take advantage of that on this purchase? </s>
<s> 2) What should I buy? </s>
<s> When I can't decide I hit the Amazon best sellers list. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Electronics-External-Optical-Drives/zgbs/electronics/1292112011 http://www.amazon.com/LaCie-Blu-Ray-Optical-Drive-9000281/dp/B009LJM6HG is the first hit. </s>

<s> Country: US Gotta love amazon, didn't realize they had a best sellers section. </s>
<s> Should have known. </s>
<s> Any ideas on whether or not I should take advantage of the USB 3.0 port on this or stick with USB 2.0? </s>
<s> USB 2.0 is fast enough for writing to media and with some machines with USB 3.0 troubles only you know if your Dell has been updated and cured. </s>
<s> Sorry but I rarely check to see if a member has revealed King and Country information and with many from across the world I've learned to toss in a caveat or question. </s>
