<s> Ok...I'm stuck on this one. </s>
<s> I have 2 USB ports on the front of my case as well as headphone and mic jacks. </s>
<s> My problem is that I dont know where to hook them up on my mobo. </s>
<s> I have an Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe. </s>
<s> I've looked all over the manual put can't find anything. </s>
<s> Well, I did find the part about the USB's. </s>
<s> Unfortunately the headers from the case and the mobo are labeled differently. </s>
<s> At least they look like they are. </s>
<s> M/board----- USB +5V --- USB +5V USB_P7- --- USB _P8- USB_P7+ --- USB_P7- GND---GRD Headers ------DATA - 1 (WH wire) DATA +1 (GRN) GROUND 1 (BLK) VCC 1 (BLK) Anybody knows what goes where?? </s>
<s> I have the same problem with Mic/Headphones, but I dont know where the connectors are. </s>
<s> Its like my mother boars doesnt have any. </s>
<s> Header.---MIC in MIC Bias GRND LOUT L---IN R---IN R---OUT GRND Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> You gave a lot of good info. </s>
<s> Just to be sure, can you give your case brand and model number? </s>
<s> There are 3 USB pin headers on your mobo. </s>
<s> Each pin header can be responsible for 2 USB ports. </s>
<s> In your manual, the headers are labeled USB78, USB56, and USB910. </s>
<s> It doesn't matter which one you choose, so let's use USB78 USB pin header * * * * * &lt;--row1 * * * * &lt;--row2 Keep all 4 USB front panel connectors in one row, such as row1. </s>
<s> Connect as follows: CASE -- MOBO VCC -- USB+5V DATA+1 -- USB_P8+ DATA-1 -- USB_P8- GROUND 1 -- GND </s>
<s> Here's a reference with pictures: http://www.pctechguide.com/tutorials/MBoard_USB.htm </s>
<s> Your mobo has a pin header for front panel audio and microphone. </s>
<s> It is labeled &quot;FP_AUDIO&quot;, and it is located at the back of the motherboard, next to the audio ports for the back of your case. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> This is the case. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16811217002 I know ...I know...should have got a better case! </s>
<s> Oh well. </s>
<s> What is your overall impression of this case? </s>
<s> A lot of my clients need a light case, having a handle would be a bonus. </s>
<s> Thanks Bill </s>
<s> It's not too bad. </s>
<s> This is my first full build, so I haven't had experience with other cases. </s>
<s> The handle, which is plastic, was what made the sale for me. </s>
<s> I still have to see how it'll hold up once I've finished building it. </s>
<s> The fact you have a 500w PSU thrown in is a big bonus. </s>
<s> Having said that, I'm not sure how long the PSU is going to last. </s>
<s> The price is ridicules.We'll see. </s>
<s> Value wise, it's a winner. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I always say that hardware that fits your needs is the best. </s>
<s> Looks like a nice bargain to me. </s>
<s> I like the top handle, too. </s>
<s> Happy builing! </s>
<s> OK...I've put them in. </s>
<s> I still haven't finished the whole build yet, but everything you said made sense. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I found the pin header. </s>
<s> I still can't figure out what goes where. </s>
<s> M/board (Manual) BLINE_OUT_L XXX Line out_L XXX NC (JUMPER) BLINE_OUT_R XXX Line out_R (JUMPER) +5V XXX MICPWR AGRD XXX MIC2 My Headers L_IN xxx L_OUT R_IN xxx R_OUT MICBIAS MIC_IN GRND GRND Can anyone tell what goes where. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> If there is a manual that came with the case check that. </s>
<s> Otherwise, this is what I would do: MOBO PIN -- CASE WIRE BLINE_OUT_L ------ L_IN Line_out_L ------ L_OUT BLINE_OUT_R ------ R_IN Line_out_R ------ R_OUT MICPWR ------ MICBIAS MIC2 ------ MIC_IN AGND ------ GRND This leaves you with a loose GRND. </s>
<s> You could twist its wire together with the other GRND, and then place a new plastic ending on it (computer store, or online). </s>
<s> Another option is to place it on a GND pin that is nearby. </s>
<s> A third option is to place it on the NC pin. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if NC is a true ground, but I'd probably place the remaining GRND there, especially since there is no other ground pin nearby. </s>
<s> Thanks linkit. </s>
<s> I did what you said. </s>
<s> I'll let you know if it worked or not. </s>
<s> I'm still waitng for windows Xp to come in the mail. </s>
