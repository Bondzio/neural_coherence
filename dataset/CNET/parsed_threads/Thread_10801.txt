<s> My computer is a 2002 PC, i forget the model, its in the shop right now. </s>
<s> It completely crashed, so I re-installed the system, and it turns on fine, however it makes an irritating beeping noise that dosen't stop unless I obviously turn it off. </s>
<s> Anyway the shop said i needed a new mother board,and its going to cost me 150 bucks. </s>
<s> I dont have that kind of money right now, I'm a student but in my free time I use adobe photoshop and psp to make graphics. </s>
<s> The guy at the shop said to replace it would be like buying a new transmission for a car w/ 90,000 miles on it. </s>
<s> So i am going to buy a new computer, I'll get the money from my dad or something, anyway i was wondering if anyone has some insight about the beeping, because i'm concerned the people at the shop are ripping me off. </s>
<s> If it is a valid reason to replace the m-b however, i would like to know what kind of computer I should buy that is under 700 dollars and has alot of memory, and will witstand internet and virus. </s>
<s> Also, does anyone know of a REALLLY good virust protection program? </s>
<s> My dad picked up this a few weeks ago -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=PJ473AAR&cat=SYS You didn't describe your machine very well so its nigh impossible to tell much what would be possible to replace cheap. </s>
<s> Try the usual and reseat all the chips and boards with the power off. </s>

<s> thanks very much, how do I reset all the chips and boards? </s>
<s> I meant &quot; reseat &quot; which is to, with the power off, gently push cables into their sockets, cards and the memory sticks. </s>
