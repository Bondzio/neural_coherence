go to vm website and look around the gaming pcs, look for the configurable things e.g.
all, also i think falcon nw has one of the best budget gaming pc's IMO the talon.
talon has good features for the price, sli mobo and overall everything is good.
with $2000 you can get a very potent pc, all you have to do is shop around.
