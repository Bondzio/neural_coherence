1.1.1	SoundBlaster Live 24-bit EAX console - device supported not detected I just installed a SoundBlaster Live 24-bit 7.1 sound card and Logitech X-530 5.1 speakers in my 2ghz Celeron 512 mb RAM XP Home emachines which came with Avance Audio apapter on the Mboard .	St
1.1.2	I get good sound through the front speakers and subwoofer , but nothing through the rear and center speakers .	St
1.1.3	When I try to run the Creative MediaSource Player 's EAX console through the Tools Menu in Organizer ( there is no green EAX Button ) , which I believe is what I need to turn on Surround Sound for this card , I just get an error message , ''The audio device supported by this application is not detected .	St
1.1.4	The application will exit '' .	St
1.1.5	And it wo n't run .	St
1.1.6	I also installed the DFX Master Pack of audio plug-ins for Winamp , Win Media Player and others , but when I try to use them I get no sound at all in those programs .	St
1.1.7	When I originally ran the install program for the SoundBlaster Live , as it started I got this error : '' Setup could not detect any SoundBlaster Live !	St
1.1.8	24-bit on your system .	St
1.1.9	Please ensure that you SoundBlaster Hardware is properly installed before running this setup program .	St

1.1.13	I 've done this 3 times ending up with the same problem I described above .	St
1.1.14	I 've checked the card position and the speaker wires several times and they all are correct .	St
1.1.15	The SB Live is thedefault sound card on the system .	St

1.2.1	The motherboard drivers needed to be installed first .	St

1.3.1	What do you mean by ''The motherboard drivers needed to be installed first '' ?	Ques
1.3.2	Which ones and where are they and how ? Here 's another aspect of my case .	St
1.3.3	After posting , I took the SB card back to Best Buy and exchanged it for another same card , thinking it could be bad .	St
1.3.4	I swapped PCI slots with a modem and rebooted .	St
1.3.5	After XP started I saw detection of & quot ; new & quot ; modem and & quot ; new & quot ; SB Live 24-bit sound card going on in the system tray .	St
1.3.6	Then an error box came up : & quot ; The installshield engine ( ikernel.exe ) could not be installed .	St
1.3.7	The system can not find the file specified & quot ; .	St
1.3.8	Then XP abruptly turned off the computer and restarted .	St
1.3.9	This happened 4 times .	St
1.3.10	Then I took out all the cards and it rebooted OK .	St
1.3.11	In Control panel , the default audio device is now the original Avance AC97 Audio and the SB Live is n't even listed .	St
1.3.12	I never uninstalled anything that came with the card .	St
1.3.13	I installed a new Maxtor 80gb drive to replace my old 40gb that came with the machine .	St
1.3.14	I used the MaxBlast software to copy the entire old drive to make the new one the C : boot drive .	St
1.3.15	It boots and everything is as it was , except a few programs thought they were n't registered or their trial period was over .	St
1.3.16	The & quot ; unregistered & quot ; ones worked OK after I entered the reg .	St
1.3.17	No 's .	St
1.3.18	This has me wondering if the MaxBlast program overlooked or corrupted a few files , probably hidden ones .	St
1.3.19	Or a certain folder where all these reside .	St
1.3.20	I left my old drive intact with all the files on it in the machine as E : I relabelled the C : drive before the sound card installation .	St
1.3.21	It was fornerly & quot ; Local Disk & quot ; .	St
1.3.22	Could that be a problem for programs looking for certain files ?	Ques
1.3.23	I just did a search for ikernel.exe It is in the same path on both drives , & quot ; \Program Files\Common Files\InstallShield\Engine\6\Intel 32 & quot ; .	St
1.3.24	I am holding off doing anything else until I get answers to some questions , like : a .	St
1.3.25	Should I uninstall all the Creative software ?	Ques
1.3.26	What special thing should I do with the device drivers etc ?	Ques
1.3.27	b .	St
1.3.28	The install instructions said to hit Cancel if XP asked for the device drivers .	St
1.3.29	Should I run their install again anyway ?	Ques
1.3.30	c. Could the & quot ; missing & quot ; ikernel be why the EAX app is malfunctioning ?	Ques
1.3.31	d. I did a System Restore save point just before switching hard drives .	St
1.3.32	should I restore it first ?	Ques
1.3.33	e. Should I get a different card ?	Ques
1.3.34	Would that really help ?	Ques
1.3.35	After all , I just wanted to listen to some music !	St
