1.1.1	Hi - my printer was connected to my home wireless network just fine until recently .	St
1.1.2	I decided to change my network SSID and Network Key to something more easily remembered and now my printer will not connect to the network .	St
1.1.3	I keep getting error TS-05 that the SSID and/or password are not matching .	St
1.1.4	My old network was using a 64 bit HEX key which had a 10 digit password in HEX .	St
1.1.5	When I first changed it , I went to ASCII 64 bit which used a 5 digit password .	St
1.1.6	When that did not work I tried ASCII 128 bit with a 13 digit password but again that did not work .	St
1.1.7	Then I went back to HEX 64 bit with a 10 digit password but that is still not working .	St
1.1.8	The other change I made as to change the SSID from some generic 5 digit code ( LZST3 ) to a new one ( MulnoFamily ) .	St
1.1.9	All of my other devices have been able to connect to each of the above network changes just fine .	St
1.1.10	this is multiple laptops , iPad and Android tablets , etc .	St
1.1.11	None of those have any issue with any of the changes I have made .	St
1.1.12	Only the Brother printer is not talking any longer .	St
1.1.13	any help on this ?	Ques
1.2.1	I should add , although I do not think it matters - my computer is a Windows Vista computer .	St
1.2.2	But again , I am trying to connect this wireless directly - like it was before .	St
1.3.1	It 's another reason I move to WPA2 .	St
1.4.1	ok - I ended up resetting the modem back to factory settings which put back the SSID and password .	St
1.4.2	that allowed it to work again .	St
1.4.3	I then changed just the password and the printer was still able to reconnect .	St
1.4.4	So - I am not sure if it did not like the SSID I was trying to use or if something else happened but I can live with the weird SSID but a password that works for me .	St
1.4.5	Thanks everyone .	Polite
