1.1.1	I own an external hard drive , its a Toshiba .	St
1.1.2	I do n't remember the exact model , but its the one that has a solid background and 5 two toned & quot ; curves & quot ; on the top of the drive .	St
1.1.3	Here : http : //www.google.com/products/catalog ? hl=en & q=toshiba+500gb+external+hard+drive & biw=1503 & bih=562 & um=1 & ie=UTF-8 & cid=15968665362581317533 & ei=Dz4DTcvcHMb_lges4onVCQ & sa=X & oi=product_catalog_result & ct=result & resnum=10 & ved=0CIgBEPMCMAk # Anyway , this is a two part question for all you pro 's out there .	St
1.1.4	First off , Ive had this for quite awhile and I have , well , my entire life on it .	St
1.1.5	I know .	St
1.1.6	Its not the best thing in the world to depend on something that COULD potentially break but thus far it has been fine .	St
1.1.7	Recently , however , it stopped getting & quot ; read & quot ; on my laptop .	St
1.1.8	The little notification still comes up that I & quot ; attached & quot ; something to the USB .	St
1.1.9	And I can still see ( and use ) what 's on the External , BUT only if I directly go to start/computer/E drive .	St
1.1.10	I used to be able to listen to my music on WMP when my settings were attached to my E/my music drive .	St
1.1.11	Not anymore .	St
1.1.12	It wont even recognize it .	St
1.1.13	I had attached some program icon short cuts to my taskbar , and even those are & quot ; invalid & quot ; .	St
1.1.14	I click on them and it tells me that the disk can not open because its write protected .	St
1.1.15	No its not .	St
1.1.16	Unless somehow it went protected !	St
1.1.17	How do I check for this and has anyone else had anything like this happen ?	Ques
1.1.18	How do I fix it ?	Ques
1.1.19	Can I fix it ?	Ques
1.1.20	Second part of the question : If I bought a new external hard drive , can I um , transfer everything from the old external to the new one ?	Ques
1.1.21	Is it a pain in the butt ?	Ques
1.1.22	I cant see how I would go about this , but I am sure there is some way around it .	St
1.1.23	Hopefully you lovely ladies and gents can help me out , because as you can imagine , this is starting to worry me .	St
1.1.24	All my business stuff is on that drive so if it breaks ... *gulp* .	St
1.2.1	BTW I just saw the other post on being able to transfer from and to a new and old drive .	St
1.2.2	So , dont answer that .	St
1.2.3	But , it did bring up another thought , for the past month or so , every time I even remotely BUMP my external , the & quot ; ding & quot ; noise happens and the notification pops up that the drive has been re-attached or whatever it says .	St
1.2.4	I wonder if all these problems are simply being caused by the wire ? ! ?	Ques
1.2.5	That would be crazy !	St
1.2.6	Can I buy JUST the wire ?	Ques
1.3.1	Shop for a new cable .	St
1.3.2	Do n't bump it and get your files safe again !	St
1.4.1	Okay , does anyone know the name of the cable or any links to the cable or anything like that ?	Ques
1.4.2	Mine is super short .	St
1.4.3	It looks like this one http : //www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/adet.to ? poid=450276 but its not 4 foot .	St
1.4.4	Is it essential to buy Toshiba ?	Ques
1.5.1	http : //www.amazon.com/Cables-Go-27005-Mini-B-Cable/dp/B000067RVL But if this HDD is USB powered I carry one like this - & gt ; http : //www.amazon.com/Connectland-CL-CAB20042-5-Pin-Power-Cable/dp/B002N2EL6C/ref=sr_1_4 ? s=electronics & ie=UTF8 & qid=1292116248 & sr=1-4 Bob	St
