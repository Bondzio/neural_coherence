<s> I replaced a failing motherboard with a new Shuttle VIA KT400 AK39N motherboard that keeps giving me the error that the hard drive (WD-40) is not present, check the power connections, etc, when trying to restore or install WinXP Home. </s>
<s> I have checked and rechecked everything, and all appears to be otherwise fine. </s>
<s> The drive is recognized at boot and in BIOS. </s>
<s> At one point I tried using an old WD drive's EZ-Drive floppy for formatting the HDD, but it told me it could not because the current drive has NTFS, which tells me that the drive has no power connection issues as the error would have me believe. </s>
<s> Short of returning the MB is there anything else I can do? </s>
<s> I thought maybe downloading the system files for formatting a NTFS drive might be the thing to do, but I don't know if this would be the fix to my problem. </s>
<s> &quot;Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; You didn't note the power supply rating. </s>
<s> Some try to skimp on the power supply and odd things like this happen. </s>
<s> Since the drive appears in the BIOS, but not to XP, it's possible that the cable or drive is damaged. </s>
<s> Try another. </s>
<s> It's also possible that the incorrect cable is being used. </s>
<s> Those 80 conductor cables are a required fitting in my rule book. </s>
<s> In closing, tell the PSU Wattage and consider that DELPART.EXE can delete that NTFS partition from http://www.bootdisk.com YES, data all gone! </s>
