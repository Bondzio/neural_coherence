<s> Question: Is the Apple iPad or Netbook right for me? </s>
<s> I'm looking for a device that will let me check my e-mail and surf the Web when I'm travelling, but with a larger screen and storage size than any phone has. </s>
<s> I thought a Netbook would be the way to go, but now the Apple iPad is coming out, I'm wondering if that would be a better choice. </s>
<s> Any recommendations for Netbooks, or should I wait for the iPad? </s>
<s> What are the pros and cons of both devices? </s>
<s> Whatever I get needs to be portable and light enough to be hauled around a lot. </s>
<s> Since I'm on the road quite often, sometimes for weeks, its battery life and charging options are important. </s>
<s> All opinions and suggestions are welcomed. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> If you are looking for something that is very user friendly and no viruses; go with the new iPad </s>
<s> I vote yes, unless you play online poker or other Flash Games. </s>
<s> If you notice when you come up to a flash site on your full computer you will hear your system work harder and the cooling fans kick in. </s>
<s> Its very processor intensive language. </s>
<s> That's why no cell phones and such allow flash to work on their products. </s>
<s> E-Mail 100% Web surfing for the average person 80%, size 100% Price good fun factor priceless in a hotel bed to flip through a e-book in color. </s>
<s> The answer here really depends on what you want to do. </s>
<s> A netbook is basically a PC laptop (running XP or Windows 7) without an optical drive (CD/DVD) and scaled down in size. </s>
<s> The iPad is a different platform, with a different OS and set of applications. </s>
<s> So this is really going to depend on what you want to do with the device. </s>
<s> Presumably (since I do not have detailed familiarity with the iPad), if you want to surf the web and check E-Mail, both classes of device will work, and the iPad will probably have less overhead (e.g. </s>
<s> need to boot Windows when you turn it on, etc.). </s>
<s> But the iPad, while it will run it's own set of &quot;apps&quot; (which may be extensive) won't run Windows or Windows software (which is a deal breaker for some users, but which others would view as a positive characteristic). </s>
<s> Bottom line, again, it comes down to what you want to do with the device. </s>
<s> Considerations like size, weight and batter life all matter also, but there is a wide range of netbooks, so those can only be discussed in the context of a particular device. </s>
<s> Get a Netbook or a laptop. </s>
<s> You will be unhappy with an Apple unless you want Apple to try (and with success)to control everything you do! </s>
<s> Flash would be a down side but that's 12 year old tech anyway. </s>
<s> The iPad has no 'proper' USB: it's on a separate, little, corded dongle and that's no biggy. </s>
<s> Ignore the multitasking issue that you may have heard about; that's a non-issue. </s>
<s> Real-world: you'll have difficulty zooming in on a netbook and you'll be limited in physical space. </s>
<s> There is no instant 'on' for netbooks. </s>
<s> You'll be board silly sitting on the couch or in bed with a netbook perched on your chest while you peck away and whizz around using the touchpad and double clicking on icons. </s>
<s> So in general, netbooks are just laptops in miniature. </s>
<s> I believe you'll be carrying a briefcase or under-the-arm satchel with paperwork. </s>
<s> Just slip out the iPad, push the main button, tap an icon (app) and you're there in less that 15 seconds in either portrait or landscape mode: how cool is that? </s>
<s> But with a netbook: pull it out, flip it open, if not in stand-by or hibernate mode -turn it on, wait, look closely at the tiny pointer while you whizz around on the touch pad (or plug in a mouse), double-click an icon, wait, and you're there in about 2-3 minutes ...maybe. </s>
<s> The pad is a good idea, however I wouldn't get the Ipad. </s>
<s> The main reason (for me at least) is that it doesn't support Flash. </s>
<s> I'm a photographer and my site uses Flash so I can't see my site or thousands (probably millions) of other sites that use Flash. </s>
<s> In a very short time many other similar pads are coming out. </s>
<s> I'd wait a few months and see what's out there. </s>
<s> The iPad is very cool but Steve Jobs wants to control everything. </s>
<s> He doesn't like Flash because it's an Adobe thing and not his. </s>
<s> The only way you'll be able to download books,apps, and everything else is through Apple.....I think it's worth the wait. </s>
<s> Ron Seymour </s>
<s> There are numerous things you might want to consider like: 1.) </s>
<s> What you plan on doing and how comfortable you might be without a keyboard. </s>
<s> If you're emails are short and to the point, you might be able to get away without one. </s>
<s> Yes, you CAN buy a keyboard attachment for the iPad, but it's gonna cost you extra money. </s>
<s> That will not only raise the base price $70, it's another thing you have to carry around with you. </s>
<s> The Netbook's keyboard is already attached and it's included in the price - which brings us to... </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> Most netbooks are a bit cheaper than the iPad to begin with. </s>
<s> The Dell Mini 10v can be had for as little as $249. </s>
<s> Lenovo's offerings start at $359. </s>
<s> HP's netbooks start at $269. </s>
<s> That's in comparison to the iPad which starts at $499 for the basic model. </s>
<s> 3.) </s>
<s> The Apple universe is a walled garden with lots of limitations. </s>
<s> Since the iPad runs the same operating system as the iPhone/iPod Touch, this can be an issue. </s>
<s> You'd have to buy new apps to do some things that don't come with the device. </s>
<s> Yes, there are free iP___ apps out there as well. </s>
<s> Netbooks, on the other hand, will run any and all standard PC software given they're based on full versions of Windows (or Linux). </s>
<s> If you're really a die-hard Mac fan, there are even tutorials on how to set up certain Dell Mini 10's with OSX. </s>
<s> If youv'e got a licence for the software and it's OK to install it on more than one device, you can install it and use it on either one. </s>
<s> It may be cheaper to go this route. </s>
<s> 4.) </s>
<s> Then there's the issue of what sort of stuff you can or can't do with the iPad. </s>
<s> It's primary purpose is as a fancy ebook reader. </s>
<s> But as such, there's been a recent controversy with regards to how Apple is going to require ALL content to be approved (read: censored) before it's allowed onto your device. </s>
<s> Amazon and Barnes & Noble have both released or announced ebook reader apps for the iPhone/Pod/Pad that have been approved. </s>
<s> The issue is the content that will be banned from your iPad. </s>
<s> If, for instance, you have a subscription to say, Playboy or Maxim - you will NOT be able to read either magazine on your iPad. </s>
<s> You can, of course, read them from the comfort of your home PC by way of the desktop version of the ebook reader - but it won't sync to your mobile device. </s>
<s> While it might be considered &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;PC&quot; to keep the iP_____ family of devices porn and smut free, it begs the question - &quot;What's next on Apple's list to be banned?&quot; Given Apple's track record, that's hard to say. </s>
<s> They recently purged something like 5,000 apps from the iPhone store because they were deemed &quot;too racy&quot;. </s>
<s> Who knows - Steve Jobs may get an itch and decide that only certain politically oriented content that agrees with his personal views may be allowed and all else is banned. </s>
<s> Or medical text with graphic depiction of various body parts could be banned simply because they're too suggestive. </s>
<s> Either way - it's not an issue with the netbook. </s>
<s> You can have pretty much ANY and all content on them regardless of how they're rated - G, PG, PG-13, R or XXX for that matter. </s>
<s> 5.) </s>
<s> As far as battery life goes - That's hard to say. </s>
<s> It will depend largely on a couple of things - like how you use the device. </s>
<s> Since we haven't got a working iPad to put through the proverbial testing mill, it's hard to say how well it will live up to what Apple claims the battery life will be. </s>
<s> Either way you go, you'll likely need to keep charging the devices. </s>
<s> All of these devices come with the usual charging cables and stuff you need to keep them going. </s>
<s> Netbooks, as a general rule have user replacable batteries. </s>
<s> That is, if your battery is running low, and you're not quite done with what you're working on, you can shut the device down after saving your work, pop in a fresh battery and go on with your life. </s>
<s> The iPad - not so much. </s>
<s> It, like the iPhone and iPod Touch comes with a battery that's sealed inside of the device. </s>
<s> You can't replace it yourself. </s>
<s> You'll need to take it back to an Apple store and they'll replace the iPad - lock, stock and barrel for $99. </s>
<s> It would be also a very good idea to sync your device with your primary desktop before turning in your iPad for replacement as anything on the device will NOT be extracted... </s>
<s> 6.) </s>
<s> Netbooks, typically come with 160 GB or larger drives which are 10 times larger than the base iPad hard drive (only 16 GB). </s>
<s> If you have a large music collection you want to bring along with you, or if you want to bring movies along for your trips, 16 GB may not be quite enough room. </s>
<s> The largest drive space available to the iPad is 64 GB - half as much as the ones typically found in base line netbooks. </s>
<s> 7.) </s>
<s> About the only thing that the iPad excels in would be in the realm of &quot;cool factor&quot;. </s>
<s> If that's an important feature, more important than productivity, then by all means, there's your answer. </s>
<s> The bottom line, if it were my decision, I'd go with the netbook. </s>
<s> They offer more bang for the buck. </s>
<s> But hey, I'm less concerned with looking good as I am with getting the job done. </s>
<s> The iPad is merely a iPod touch with a bigger screen and the iPod touch is basically an iPhone minus the phone features. </s>
<s> The iPad is chiefly going after the .PDF/ebook market. </s>
<s> So what you want is a Netbook or ultralight laptop/notebook because you sound more like a road warrior. </s>
<s> The world wide web is 20 year old tech, doesn't mean you do not want it on an Internet enabled device! </s>
<s> Ipad- The Apple Ipad is not the revolutionary device it is cracked up to be! </s>
<s> But it is a nice device if you need something to check your emails and play a few games on an Ipod Touch on steroids. </s>
<s> The Ipad (much like its brethren the Itouch) Does not have a long battery life later on its life, however you will have atleast a 10 hour charge if your not using: 3g, WiFi and are not playing games just watching a movie. </s>
<s> Its battery is not replaceable by YOU only by a &quot;Certified Apple Technician&quot;. </s>
<s> Also if you do touch typing (like me) then you are out of luck its one big touch screen so their is no minor bumps (I know their is a more specific name for them) to help you know your fingers position. </s>
<s> the Ipad is also said to not beable to use most of the app store apps because it screen is larger and all the apps were made for a 3.5&quot; touch screen. </s>
<s> Also you might not look like the worlds smartest person when you have a giant textbook sized tablet in your hands and your waving it around trying to play get the red ball into the hole ( I don't know if that game exsits on the app store but with 100,000 apps im sure it does). </s>
<s> the Ipad is also $700 thats the lowest end version 16Gb with no 3g the 16Gb 3g version is either $750 or $850. </s>
<s> on the other hand because its the great Apple you will not have any customizationability and you dont have Java or Adobe so you cant play all the internet games. </s>
<s> You also have a glass screen as in you drop it you break it (Netbooks don't run this risk as heavily because they can close). </s>
<s> If you live in a metrosexual area then I suggest a Ipad (i.e. </s>
<s> San Fransisco or Seattle) Netbooks- NetBooks are great new revolutions they are a laptop for people that don't need all the extra features of a full featured laptop.NetBooks have screens from 7 inches to 11 inches. </s>
<s> They have keyboards that are usually about %7 smaller than a actual sized keyboard. </s>
<s> NetBooks have Java and Adobe and what not so interrnet games are a yes. </s>
<s> NetBooks have Batteries that if you want to buy a bigger battery and add an inch to your NetBook you can. </s>
<s> Netbooks also come with 3g (but check first because their are a handful that don't). </s>
<s> You'll also have the ability to use Microsoft Word so you can do work and what not on the go. </s>
<s> You also get the satisfaction of only paying about $250. </s>
<s> You can also get a webcam for your NetBook I don't know about the Ipad tho. </s>
<s> Sony sells a NetBook that has a 7&quot; screen that is super tiny and is ULTRA-PORTABLE!!! </s>
<s> (im not sure if it has 3g tho). </s>
<s> So the choice is yours the info needed is above. </s>
<s> Wait and get a Lenovo's U1 Hybrid lap top and tablet in one. </s>
<s> It does look promising. </s>
<s> From the sound of what you want it is the Netbook that will satisfy your needs. </s>
<s> The iPad will be gorgeous, a great &quot;entertainment&quot; system but is is not intended to replace the functions of a PC. </s>
<s> The iPad will have a lot of applications ...but mostly in the fun and information category. </s>
<s> To get the version that will do e-mail you'll need the one that costs more and requires a separate monthly plan. </s>
<s> For $400 (or less) a netbook will have a 10 inch screen and Windows programs and you can surf at hotspots everywhere. </s>
<s> Choosing between the new Ipad and existing netbooks is tough. </s>
<s> Although my choice would be the netbook for more versatility and open choice of software, and an actual keyboard..... writing on a screen with either stylus or virtual keyboard may not be the best experience in my opinion. </s>
<s> That may change when the IPAD becomes available and is running in the real world. </s>
<s> My best suggestion right now is wait and see what happens with the IPAD after it is released. </s>
<s> More real world reviews and testing by different people will give you a much clearer picture. </s>
<s> While the cost of either option is not excessive, it still is a fair amount of money to put at risk. </s>
<s> I am most impressed by some of the Linux based netbooks- and watching the sales that seem to pop up online can let you pick and choose the features that make the most sense to you. </s>
<s> The 'carry' factor is a consideration.. how much electronic stuff do you want to haul around - either choice is reasonably compact but they certainly don't fit in a pocket and that means a bag or some other option to hold it. </s>
<s> I know this is not the most help, but I am really not comfortable with the IPAD as a computer replacement... it might just be the game changing device it is hyped up to be. </s>
<s> I kind of hope it is. </s>
<s> But only time will tell. </s>
<s> I have some difficulty understanding what might possibly be the attraction of an iPad. </s>
<s> In my opinion, it is a product without a good use, and its success depends on suckering gullible people using the time-honored method of media hype. </s>
<s> It is as unwieldy as a full-blown notebook computer but far more expensive than most of them and significantly less capable than ANY of them. </s>
<s> You have to carry it with your arms the same way you do a notebook. </s>
<s> You can't put it in your pocket, which you CAN do with a smartphone that will let you read your mail and surf the net while on the go, also a lot cheaper (sometimes even free with a re-up to a two-year contract with your carrier) than an iPad. </s>
<s> I know you want the larger screen, but jeez! </s>
<s> Are you made of money and are obsessed with hype? </s>
<s> Then the iPad may be for you. </s>
<s> I predict this product will fail miserably, like most things without a good use. </s>
<s> Of the iPad, a netbook, and a tablet PC, I would go for the tablet PC. </s>
<s> If you like to have an internal optical drive (I do), then do not get the HP TouchSmart tm2t. </s>
<s> I currently have the HP Pavilion tx2635us tablet PC, but I am not overly interested in the next one because it lacks an internal optical drive. </s>
<s> The Ipad looks to be a great device, but it is an Apple product. </s>
<s> If your already familiar with the Apple way of doing things, I see no reason to hesitate. </s>
<s> Otherwise you need to ask your self if your willing to commit to learning some new ways of doing common internet task. </s>
<s> Personally I recommend the latter, as you never know when you may be under pressure to complete some task and your only resource is an MAC/PC. </s>
<s> If your familiar with these two different systems, your good to go on probably 80-90% of the small computers in the world. </s>
<s> I waited to long to order the iPad so unless I want to go stand in the line for the few that will be in stores I have to order on line and wait until the week of April 12th. </s>
<s> I want the iPad for playing games; ebook reader and surf the net a bit and I like the idea of a touch screen. </s>
<s> Right now I play games on my smartphone but it's too small for reading books. </s>
<s> Yes it's probably a big iPod touch but for those of us aging we need a bigger screen! </s>
<s> This will be great for traveling. </s>
<s> Not going to bother with the 3G as there are plenty of free wifi places out there. </s>
<s> I'm trying to figure out which size to get as I'm not sure how much space ebooks take up. </s>
<s> ...if the current tech has to struggle to make it work. </s>
<s> You're not running DOS on your mobil are you? </s>
<s> Flash hasn't kept up with current trends so it's time to move on from that 12 year old legacy crap. </s>
<s> Some of those internet Flash games and a few of those internet Flash programs are being turned into 'Apps' so they can be used and cash in on new mediums like iPhones, iPads and Androids. </s>
<s> Depending on how bad your eyesight is and whether or not you do a lot of traveling, then you may be better off getting a tablet PC from Fujitsu. </s>
<s> Some of those have 13.3&quot; (diagonally) screens. </s>
<s> The iPad's screen is only 9.7&quot; (diagonally). </s>
<s> The Netbook and the iPad are a great boon to portability BUT are NOT in the Same Class of Laptops. </s>
<s> Netbooks are great for portability, easy connectivity, CHEAP (yes, I said it), have either decent hard drives or electronic drives (No Optical drives) and have enough processing for most Regular usage (not-Enterprise-class) users. </s>
<s> The iPad has great portability, easy connectivity, REASONABLE (not as cheap), and enough processing for most Regular usage (again, non-Enterprise). </s>
<s> Other than that, they are different. </s>
<s> Netbooks are prolific but don't have the snazzy things iPads do; touch-screen, well designed social networking, Apple anti-virus (should I say Apple non-virus), and the like, BUT you pay less than half for one. </s>
<s> Argh, that's the rub matey (like it is in Life). </s>
<s> You get what you pay for. </s>
<s> If you want something purely for travel, checking email and some occasional web surfing, the ipad is not a bad idea. </s>
<s> The Cons are no Adobe flash support (sorry, your facebook flash games wont work) and it cannot yet multitask, so you will do one thing at a time. </s>
<s> The 500$ model only has 16 gig of memory, non-expandable. </s>
<s> This is ok, if you seriously only want to do a couple things. </s>
<s> Pros are it has 10 hours battery life, you can watch full movies, listen to music from iTunes while you surf, use a TON of apps for anything you want, it has a color e-book reader for those flight times, is only 1/2 inch thick so easy to store, built in wi-fi, and for 30$/month you can get unlimited internet from AT&T without a contract. </s>
<s> A netbook is a slow laptop with options for everything listed above, battery life varies, is a bit bigger, price varies and so does battery life. </s>
<s> You should get decent battery life out of them though. </s>
<s> Depending on where you get it, internet cost might be more like 60$/month though. </s>
<s> I travel internationally and decided on a netbook. </s>
<s> Got tried of carrying my laptop. </s>
<s> Best decision for my purposes. </s>
<s> Very light weight and 9 hours of battery life. </s>
<s> Screen is smaller than a laptop but not a detriment in use. </s>
<s> Excellent wi-fi or wire use depending on hotels. </s>
<s> I make use of portable apps so no need to load a lot of software and all of my files are on thumb drives. </s>
<s> I have an HP but not recommended due to customer service problems (6 months to resolve a complaint) Good luck, not an easy decision. </s>
<s> Dayton D </s>
<s> Hmmm, I wonder what kind of problem it was. </s>
<s> I cannot recall having issues with HP's customer service. </s>
<s> I have, however, had difficulty trying to contact Dell before. </s>
<s> I think that their main problem is that contacting them requires a service tag, but I, believe that assumes that the machine is in front of you. </s>
<s> When I have contacted HP, it was usually with presales questions. </s>
<s> I can only recall containing them once or twice because of problems. </s>
<s> Perhaps their support for their netbooks (as I do not own any of those) is not as good as it is for tablet PCs, though that seems odd. </s>
<s> Making the choice between an iPad and a netbook is really more difficult than it would first appear and it really depends on exactly how you need to use the device. </s>
<s> First, you should think of the iPad as simply a large version of the iTouch and think of the Netbook as simply a smaller version of a laptop with less power and no DVD/CD drive. </s>
<s> You mentioned that you were interested in receiving emails and surfing the web while traveling or away on vacation. </s>
<s> Well, in the most basic form, this can be accomplished on just about any device that you can purchase these days including most cell phones. </s>
<s> However, there are several factors that can dictate as to whether or not a device such as an iPad, Netbook or even a smartphone is sufficient or pretty much worthless. </s>
<s> The exact type of emails that you receive as well as the kind of responses that you need to write can often make using a small device or even a larger touch device like the iPad somewhat of a pain in the neck to use. </s>
<s> If most of your incoming emails are brief and only require simple responses such as a YES or NO than just about any device will do just fine. </s>
<s> But if you are receiving emails with 25 page attachments that need to be reviewed and your responses are written in paragraphs or even pages of text, than these devices can be close to useless. </s>
<s> So, the questions you want to ask yourself are: 1. </s>
<s> Do I ever need to print from this device? </s>
<s> Since there are no USB ports and no print drivers that I know of (at least at the moment), you may not be able to connect your iPad up to a printer. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> How much storage do I really need? </s>
<s> The basic iPad comes with 16GB of storage and you can get up to 64GB, for a price. </s>
<s> Most Netbooks come with a minimum 160GB hard drive. </s>
<s> For those of you who use your laptop or netbook as a storage device to off-load photos from your camera while traveling, keep in mind the limited storage on the iPad as well as NO USB port. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Do I need a Built-in Camera? </s>
<s> The iPad does not come with a camera and no USB port to add one so dont plan to use Skype or any other video chat to call back home to see the kids. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Do I need a USB port? </s>
<s> The iPad does not have any USB ports so you will not be able to plug in any of your normal accessories such as a printer, Flash drive or other devices. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Do any of the Websites that I frequent require Adobe Flash? </s>
<s> For some reason Apple has chosen to not include Adobe Flash player with the iPad so many website that require Flash will not display properly. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Do I need any specific software applications? </s>
<s> Make sure that you do not need any specific software application that may not run on the iPad or a netbook. </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> Will I be accessing my company VPN? </s>
<s> If you access your company network, you need to check with your company IT department to make sure the device can be used with there system. </s>
<s> 8. </s>
<s> Do I need a real Keyboard? </s>
<s> I dont know about you, but I need a real keyboard. </s>
<s> You can probably tell by the length of my posts here on this site that I am not going to be typing my responses on a virtual keyboard. </s>
<s> All netbooks have a regular keyboard. </s>
<s> You can get an external keyboard for the iPad but that kind of defeats the purpose and is just one more thing to carry. </s>
<s> 9. </s>
<s> How much do I really want to spend? </s>
<s> The basic iPad starts at $499 with only 16GB of storage. </s>
<s> If you want more storage and maybe 3G coverage you can expect to pay up to $800. </s>
<s> Add to that the add-on keyboard, Carrying case and Apple Care and you are over $1000. </s>
<s> You can get a decent netbook with 160GB hard drive for under $300. </s>
<s> 10. </s>
<s> Do I need to remote into my home or office computer? </s>
<s> If you use Windows Remote Desktop to access your home or office computer, you will not be able to do this on the iPad. </s>
<s> Double check other remote access methods such as gotomypc or logmein to make sure they will work on the device that you choose. </s>
<s> 11. </s>
<s> Do I need a stylus or a mouse or is my finger ok? </s>
<s> The iPad can only be used with your finger, this can be a problem if you need to perform any detailed work that would normally be performed with a Stylus or mouse. </s>
<s> Also, keep in mind that the iPad may not work if you are wearing gloves. </s>
<s> 12. </s>
<s> Do I need to transfer data between devices? </s>
<s> Since there is no USB port on the iPad, you will not be able to use your flash drive to transfer data to or from your iPad. </s>
<s> You could still email stuff to yourself to be picked up on another computer. </s>
<s> You can purchase a SD card reader for the iPad. </s>
<s> 13. </s>
<s> Do I need a CD or DVD drive? </s>
<s> Neither the iPad nor the Netbook comes with a CD/DVD drive built-in. </s>
<s> You can purchase a separate External USB DVD/CD drive for a Netbook if you want to pay a video or need to install a program. </s>
<s> Since there is no USB drive on the iPad, you will be out of luck, at least for the time being. </s>
<s> 14. </s>
<s> Battery Life For me, battery life is a key feature. </s>
<s> There is nothing worse that being on the road looking for a place to plug in your portable computer. </s>
<s> Apple claims, I think 10 hours, as do some Netbooks. </s>
<s> I know my ASUS netbook claims 9 hours but if I have Bluetooth as well as Wireless turned ON, the battery life is greatly reduced. </s>
<s> Most netbooks have a battery that is user replaceable so that you can carry a spare with you for those really long trips. </s>
<s> The iPads battery is not user replaceable. </s>
<s> Dont get me wrong, there is no question the iPad is a COOL device and I will probably purchase one just for the fun of it. </s>
<s> I do find it interesting that everyone seems to think that just because Apple is coming out with the iPad that this is a totally new concept. </s>
<s> I have been working with Motion Touch Tablet PCs for over 6 years now. </s>
<s> Would I take an iPad with me when I travel? </s>
<s> Probably, but for the moment I will not leave without my netbook and blackberry too. </s>
<s> One other note, if you end up purchasing a Netbook, spend the extra $30 to upgrade the memory from 1GB to 2GB. </s>
<s> Dana Wayland Computer </s>
<s> Donald gives a pretty good overview of what to expect from the iPad: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-12519_7-10442905-49.html Here's CNET's iPad central page--it has pretty much everything on the iPad throughout our site--from news, photos, video, including a link to this discussion :D: http://www.cnet.com/apple-ipad/ As many have suggest it really boils down to what you are going to use it for. </s>
<s> I'm contemplating on getting one myself, but for me it's stricly more of a family entertainment device--where as my ASUS Netbook serves my purpose for work on the go that covers things that just aren't available on the iPad (examples off the top of my head: large capacity hard drive, USB ports, physical keyboard, apps/software made for PC (especially remote desktop), battery life is a big one--I have an extra battery for my Netbook which I can swap out when I'm on the go, and many more...) So if you are going to use this device more like a PC, then go with a Netbook as it is more flexible, but if it's something you are going to use as you've described like emailing, surfacing the Web, running entertainment apps or use it as an ebook reader... by all means the iPad will be a great choice! </s>
<s> That's just my 1 cent worth... Good luck with your decision! </s>

<s> Flatworm, you say: &quot;I predict this product will fail miserably&quot; I'll try to remember your quote and come back to it in 1 years time and see where the iPad stands. </s>
<s> BTW Apple's &quot;media hype&quot; works and works well! </s>
<s> Isn't that what all Capitalist businesses want? </s>
<s> If I had a company, I sure would mind if I got all that attention/hype around just one of my products releases. </s>
<s> I'm sure many big corporations are still scratching their heads wondering how the heck they can come close to generating even a fraction of the hype Apple receives for their products. </s>

<s> If the iPad connects to internet, will it work in Panama?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> 1) get 2) yourself 3) an 4) Ipad and you will also have fun with it. </s>
<s> Your needs you describe are the perfect match for it. </s>
<s> Be cautious though especially if you travel a lot. </s>
<s> Battery life is no issue, but Ipads don't last long if left unattended. </s>
<s> what difference does it make how old the tech is? </s>
<s> there are thousands of people who want flash access due to work or due to old farts playing video poker etc.. that argument was indeed lame. </s>
<s> and it came off a lil fan boi -ish at least to me </s>
<s> html 5 will be the death of flash, hopefully. </s>
<s> Html 5 will do all video and audio streaming, while almost any game you want play will be in an app that you can get from the app store(which will not kill your battery like flash does). </s>
<s> Also PC only programs besides MS Office(which the iPad is completely compatible with) you wouldn't put those programs on a netbook anyway. </s>
<s> Steve Jobs? </s>
<s> Is that you? </s>
<s> I really want to know the answer to that one </s>
<s> I think the Ipad would be great as an entertainment device. </s>
<s> I had an Ipod touch, but replaced it with a netbook(HP mini)/ The main reason was that Apple does not allow flash software and I am a news junkie. </s>
<s> AS well, I like the keyboard, usb ports, memory etc. </s>
<s> The netbook also has my word proscessing software and stuff as well as windows specific software for my job. </s>
<s> G </s>
<s> I'd have a lot more respect for fans of the iPad if they would be honest enough to admit that they want the iPad because it's a lot funner to check email and surf the web when you can touch the screen and get all the neat special effects. </s>
<s> Honestly, I've been tempted to get one, but when I ask myself what it would do that my netbook would not, I come up with nothing.....and I come up with lots my netbook can do that the iPad can't. </s>
<s> So I had to admit that I'm tempted by the iPad just because it looks like a fun way to go online. </s>
<s> But I ultimately decided on the netbook because it will make me more productive. </s>
<s> If your dilemma simply cannot be decided, try the obvious solution which is to build your own &quot;Hackintosh&quot; or OSx86. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Mini 10v with Apple Snow Leopard OS...every single driver is 100% compatible and everything works perfectly for &lt;$400 total. </s>
<s> I added 2GB RAM and upgraded the hard drive to WD SCorpio 320GB. </s>
<s> You end up with a 10&quot; screen, Apple OS, huge hard drive and weighs slightly over 2lbs! </s>
<s> I am talking about living in Panama and owning an iPad and not being able to surf the net because there is no AT&T coverage there... </s>
<s> in other words half of the functionality at over twice the price a virtual no brainer I say forget the ipad go get an ipod touch and a netbook for the same money </s>
<s> The main issue for me is the lack of a keyboard. </s>
<s> I'm talking about a built in, always available, physical keyboard. </s>
<s> That is the show stopper for me. </s>
<s> I've had a 32GB iPod Touch for a few months now and it has changed my life. </s>
<s> While I used to toggle between my desktop and my laptop I now pretty much ignore the laptop because the Touch has replaced it for the most part. </s>
<s> The Touch is instant on, always available in my pocket, and can do 80% of what I do every day on a computer. </s>
<s> However typing on the virtual keyboard is slow and inaccurate. </s>
<s> The iPad is an iPod Touch with a bigger screen. </s>
<s> Perhaps the larger virtual keyboard will work, I'll have to see. </s>
<s> But still it doesn't seem to lend itself to two hand typing. </s>
<s> You either have to lay it flat on a table, which doesn't seem ideal, or somehow prop it up on your knees. </s>
<s> There is no tactile feedback, no click, no movement, just a finger press on a glass screen. </s>
<s> It seems to me typing will still be a challenge compared to a physical keyboard. </s>
<s> The iPod Touch screen is indeed small and it would be nice not to have to zoom to read things. </s>
<s> Still it is pocketable; the iPad isn't. </s>
<s> The large screen is nice but since it won't go in a pocket it must be put in something like a computer bag, backpack or purse. </s>
<s> In that case I'd rather have something with a keyboard. </s>
<s> What would be nice is for the iPad to have an attached keyboard, like a netbook, with all the functionality of the iPad and a computer. </s>
<s> I'd even be willing to toggle between the limited Apple software and Windows 7 to have full functionality. </s>
<s> The iPad lacks connectivity. </s>
<s> If I bring it along on my Paris vacation I'll be challenged to dump my digital camera photos onto it. </s>
<s> I haven't found printing from the iPod Touch to be convenient or in most cases even possible. </s>
<s> Perhaps the iPad will improve on that problem. </s>
<s> I deal with the lack of multitasking on the Touch. </s>
<s> I'm not sure I want that same limitation on a larger device. </s>
<s> All in all I think I'll stick with the very useful Touch and my laptop for occasional business reasons. </s>
<s> At this point if I were in the market I'd look elsewhere, perhaps the Samsung NC20 if I were to buy today. </s>
<s> It has a reasonable 6 hour battery life, a full keyboard, I could do spreadsheets on it, it is lightweight, multitasking, and I'd be happy with Windows 7. </s>
<s> The Lenovo IdeaPad U1 is brilliant. </s>
<s> I just wish the iPad had been done in that format. </s>
<s> That way I'd have the simple but functional interface of the iPod Touch on a large screen coupled with a full functioning computer and physical keyboard. </s>
<s> I think Apple missed out on this one. </s>
<s> I'm not saying I'd buy the Lenovo, mostly because of the limited software when it is in tablet mode. </s>
<s> I'll hold out for a new version of the iPod Touch with a camera and it would be nice to have a built in GPS as well. </s>
<s> It sure would be nice to have a play/pause and song advance button on the Touch too. </s>
<s> Sometimes Apples insistence on simplicity goes too far. </s>
<s> I'd buy a used netbook from Craigslist and a refurbed HP DreamScreen 130 Wireless Internet Device. </s>
<s> If you just want to carry one then I'd buy convertible tablet netbook instead. </s>
<s> I bet the ipad still requires a computer to sync much of it's files and backup too while a netbook you can simply subscribe to Carbonite or use a home nas to back it up even remotely on the road. </s>
<s> I think the ipad is okay if you intend to carry your notebook as well but for what it costs, how little it does, how much the accessories are for it, and how it's not user upgradeable are enough to keep me from buying it. </s>
<s> There are going to be a slew of competitors coming out that you can read about if you visit other websites like engadget. </s>
<s> These competitors are going to use either android or MS for their OS but their hardware offerings and features easily beats the ipad offering hands down. </s>
<s> Most of these are going to come out with the standard bluetooth and wifi that the ipad has plus hdmi out so you can watch your media on your hdtv at home or on the road, built in webcam without buying it as an accessory, media card slots without an adapter, usb ports without an adapter, and I bet some of these will work with wireless keyboards as well. </s>
<s> Most of all these other devices will have one major thing working in their favor, they will support flash, which means a lot of free interactive content that are accessible online, and without having to go through Apple's walled garden to do it. </s>
<s> The best part is that many of these are rumored to have have the same resolution screens for about half the price of the ipad, which means you can buy a netbook and have one of these other items too. </s>
<s> Since you didn't provide us with enough information for us to properly answer the question simply buy what you think is the best answer that matched your criteria but in the future provide us more information and we'll help you make a much better choice. </s>
<s> I wouldn't even think twice about it! </s>
<s> It's way cheaper and there's so much you can do with the netbook and it's more productive too! </s>
<s> Ipad is just a bigger ipod touch but ipod touch is more portable. </s>
<s> Netbook has keyboard so if you want to surf, write email, that would be perfect! </s>
<s> I like Netbook so much that I have 2! </s>
<s> I put Hackintosh and Windows 7 Ultimate, Microsoft Office and upgraded to 2G Ram and that's the sweet thing. </s>
<s> One is 8.9&quot; inch so it's tiny enough that I just put in on my palm and use the other hand to surf/type. </s>
<s> Even though I don't care about the flash, netbook is so cool! </s>
<s> If you want to check email, quick surf in bad, ipod touch/iphone would do the job; again, it can do everything the ipad can </s>
<s> everything I do. </s>
<s> I would be more organized, efficient, sleeker, always looking good, and cutting edge. </s>
<s> They can control my house, finances, wardrobe, social life - anything they want. </s>
<s> Steve - takeover/makeover my life. </s>
<s> I am so ready for Apple to control everything I do. </s>
<s> Start with the desktop on my Mac and clean it up. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> There's an upside to the 'walled garden'. </s>
<s> Your apps aren't coming from a backroom in Russia, looking for your identity and bank account. </s>
<s> Windows still doesn't have the virus/malware thing licked. </s>
<s> Not a big deal to a nerd-gamebreaker for a newbie. </s>
<s> The censorship argument is weak at best. </s>
<s> I don't see Apple standing between me and content I want or need. </s>
<s> We need to see the iPad in the wild to give it any kind of reasonable appraisal. </s>
<s> A lot of my friends aren't so keen on their netbooks anymore - the disadvantages seem to mount, while the benefits stay the same. </s>
<s> The primary purpose of the iPad isn't 'a fancy ebook reader' as you put it. </s>
<s> You need to do some honest research. </s>
<s> In among the fart sounds and flashlights in the App Store are some extremely well-designed and productive applications - tools for professionals and consumers alike. </s>
<s> The iPad is focused on being a game changer, a transition device. </s>
<s> I already do a lot of work where my files are on a server and I interact with them - no need to have them copied here and there -and I believe we'll be doing more, not less of that in the future. </s>
<s> That's where the iPad and the variants it spawns (regardless of OS or vendor) is taking us. </s>
<s> For many people, the best choice is a good, old-fashioned desktop. </s>
<s> For others, it's the next big shift. </s>
<s> I think we're at that intersection now. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if I'm a candidate for the iPad, but I am going to check it out thoroughly and give it a good honest look. </s>
<s> and not rely on the opinions of people who are still afraid Steve Jobs and Apple are going to wipe out Microsoft's throttlehold on the PC market. </s>
<s> All iPads do email. </s>
<s> If you have access to wifi, you don't need a data account. </s>
<s> Please do the minimum research - read an iPad ad - before you pose as a resource for people sincerely seeking tech info. </s>
<s> Large screen, 1 ghz processor, 3g, if I wanted a bluetooth keyboard and I am good to go. </s>
<s> With contract ($150) withouth the keyboard. </s>
<s> But because I dont write so much, don't need it. </s>
<s> The feel of Apple, practicality and price of windows. </s>
<s> Love it. </s>
<s> Like many others have said, depending on what web sites you are surfing will determine the usefulness of an iPad. </s>
<s> While many sites are quickly switching to HTML5 or offering iPad versions, the majority still use Flash, and you will notice when you try to go to those sites a little puzzle piece on your screen when you go on the iPad, meaning that site does not support your device. </s>
<s> This is especially true for online games. </s>
<s> However, if all you will do is read the news, check email, check restaurants, movie times, and other travel info, the iPad should be great for that, plus you'll be able to read books on the plane! </s>
<s> Now then, a few more limitations most people aren't aware of: -iPad can not download files. </s>
<s> If you like to download music, movies, games, or other things to your computer, you won't be able to do that on the iPad. </s>
<s> You can only download JPEG photos, PDF files, and some document types like Word and Excel files. </s>
<s> -iPad will not let you copy files to it. </s>
<s> The only way to get files to the iPad is from itunes. </s>
<s> You can only sync movies, music, photos, etc. </s>
<s> If you want to copy documents, you will need to email them to yourself and download them on your ipad via email. </s>
<s> -iPad only syncs with ONE computer - if you want to copy music from multiple computers you are out of luck There are probably other limitations, but those are deal breakers for me. </s>
<s> I have to be able to have flexibility to download what I want, when I want it, or a device like the iPad is useless to me. </s>
<s> Good luck whatever choice you make! </s>
<s> You CAN download files, but ONLY from the iTunes store. </s>
<s> If you get your content any where else, you will be out of luck on the iPad. </s>
<s> well its a pretty simple answer, if you want a computer and not just a blown up mp3 player with apps, go get a laptop. </s>
<s> dont buy a netbook though, those suck too. </s>
<s> get a laptop from a couple years back on ebay, or if u get a good deal, a newer computer (a very good pc can only cost 500 bucks if u look around). </s>
<s> if you want to waste money and look like an idiot trying to type on a big ipod touch, sure go get the ipad. </s>
<s> and i dont know why anyone thinks this will change the tablet market, theres been touch/tablet pc's for 20yrs, and apple is just going to lose money on this terrible product. </s>
<s> But seriously the ipad and netbooks are both complete jokes and anyone who purchases either is just a moron. </s>
<s> no it would be all plain and flat, with everything costing absurd amounts to get the weakest things. </s>
<s> in apple world, your new icar would get 50 m/gal but go 6mph and be a square with wheels costing $120,000 but hey itd be compatible with all other iproducts and wouldnt need antivirus.. ha apples a joke. </s>
<s> the only good thing they ever made was the ipod and the zune is better than it. </s>
<s> lol. </s>
<s> Many cell phones DO support flash. </s>
<s> Do some checking before you make stupid statement. </s>
<s> If you want something like the iPad, do yourself a favor and look at the Archos 5 internet tablet. </s>
<s> Well, you've sure done your homework. </s>
<s> Go to wikipedia, type in 'internet'. </s>
<s> Come back and tell us what you've found. </s>
<s> You may be limited to the App Store for applications, but you can interact with files (like text files, Word docs, html files, databases, spreadsheets, videos, services, etc. </s>
<s> etc. </s>
<s> etc.) </s>
<s> from anywhere you can connect to. </s>
<s> If you have wifi, there's no extra charge. </s>
<s> If you choose to have a 3G model, you can connect anytime you're in a 3G service area. </s>
<s> Do come back and tell us you're not as stupid as you appear. </s>
<s> ha the ipad takes a while to boot too and theres no reason you wouldnt have the netbook in sleep mode. </s>
<s> and also the argument that the ipad is something youd just carry around without a case of some sort is just broken. </s>
<s> why would u be able to carry a brick thats bigger and heavier than a netbook under your arm (also slick and no texture so you would drop it) but not be able to carry a netbook?? </s>
<s> the ipad would be fine, cept multi-tasking, processing power, battery life, durability, storage, compatibility, programs, price and speed are all a lot more important than being idiot friendly. </s>
<s> and who cares if the ipad has apps, netbooks or laptops have programs, invented alot longer ago and there are many times more programs for windows than there are apps for ipod touch. </s>
<s> netbooks also have real keyboards, much better than a touch screen keyboard. </s>
<s> you cant even use the ipad without looking awkward with it in your lap or a very short table and straining your wrists and neck. </s>
<s> Thanks for providing this information. </s>
<s> I was thinking about purchasing the iPad but I now know that it is not the right product for me. </s>
<s> I am a college student and do have a laptop but have been looking for something smaller. </s>
<s> Not only the price of the iPad has changed my mind but also the USB ports and the amount of GB's and keyboard have really changed my mind. </s>
<s> Thank you so much. </s>
<s> tablet pc's have been around for 20 years, its not a new category. </s>
<s> the ipad cant do a single thing other than what the ipod touch can. </s>
<s> the only difference is the bigger screen, yet people (well fanboys)are pretending its equivalent to a laptop. </s>
<s> and when you take into acount that the ipad doesnt have a mic or camera (idk about speaker) a big chunk of the app store becomes useless. </s>
<s> and there is no chance the ipad will even tap microsoft's market share, some people like to pretend apple is winning when in fact it is a tiny company acting like the provide innovation,when really everything people claim they invented was out long before apple touched it.. apple didn't invent the touch screen phone, multitouch or apps they just act like they did. </s>
<s> also it doesnt take a nerd to stop viruses, anyone can easily go spend 30 bucks on a good anti-virus and never have to worry as long as your not a complete idot who actually believes that a &quot;free virus scan&quot; for the 10,000th visitor is legit. </s>
<s> I don't think the ipad is a worthy investment now. </s>
<s> but in a couple of years, I think it will be much more useful. </s>
<s> The absence of flash (html-5 is still in it's infancy), no camera, limited storage, high price, and phone OS with no multitasking, are deal-breakers for me right now. </s>
<s> Besides, if I put my entire mp3 collection on the base ipad, I wouldn't have any room for apps! </s>
<s> but in 2 years, they'll have a iPad 3GS that will probably have fixed all the issues and be pretty kick ass The no multi-tasking issue does bother me. </s>
<s> That means you can't listen to music and browse the web at the same time. </s>
<s> You can't have your instant message client open in the background while you are reading an ebook. </s>
<s> it is really only one thing at a time. </s>
<s> That's a pretty big deal imo. </s>
<s> I did buy a netbook last fall, before I took a trip to hawaii, and couldn't be happier with it. </s>
<s> I almost got an ipod touch to replace my 4g ipod, but after I saw that the netbooks were the same price as a 32 or 64gb touch, it was a no-brainer. </s>
<s> I have a 10.1&quot; screen, 160gb hard drive, 2gb ram, keyboard, and built in SD and USB slots. </s>
<s> And the best part, is I get just about 9 hours of battery life on the thing. </s>
<s> some newer netbooks get up to 12 hours. </s>
<s> I watch movies on it all the time. </s>
<s> I usually rip/download whatever I want to watch on my home PC, dump it to a couple of SD cards and then pop them into my netbook when leave, and watch the movies right off the SD cards. </s>
<s> No extra fees or adapters required, and it plays every format you can throw at it. </s>
<s> I can remote desktop to my PC at work and check my email and phone messages from anywhere. </s>
<s> I also have installed MS office and photoshop CS on my netbook (and yes PS runs just fine on it). </s>
<s> I'd like to see someone run photoshop on an ipad. </s>
<s> I also do basic video editing with it. </s>
<s> I use skype to make calls over the internet. </s>
<s> and with the built-in webcam, you can video conference/chat with it too. </s>
<s> It also plays quake live pretty darn good. </s>
<s> I really get a lot of use out of this thing, especially since its so easy to carry around. </s>
<s> If I'm somewhere without free wifi, I just turn on the bluetooth, and tether it right off 3g cell-phone. </s>
<s> I really think apple should have made their own netbook. </s>
<s> An os-x netbook would be so much more useful and productive than the ipad. </s>
<s> And I bet they'd sell many more apple netbooks than ipads. </s>
<s> My neighbor was all set to get an ipad until she found out she couldn't play farmville on it lol. </s>
<s> Like I said, I think it's too new right now, and I'll wait for the tech to catch up and for apple to fix/improve the things that are wrong with it now. </s>
<s> they'll probably have a 2nd generation out by the end of the year. </s>
<s> Right now, I think the best thing is to get a netbook and an ipod touch. </s>
<s> Best of both worlds right there. </s>
<s> I still think apple should make a netbook though. </s>
<s> I travel all over the world a lot, and as I run a blog (www.ebookanoid.com) all about eReaders, I need to be able to both post things on it and keep track of my emails. </s>
<s> I have found what seems to me the perfect solution, I have an EeePC which I equip with 3G modems in the countries I visit regularly - or use free WiFi which outside Europe is still very common, and thus can do all the things I need to regardless of where I am. </s>
<s> This little computer is easy to carry around, it is light and has a good battery endurance. </s>
<s> And can do everything any other computer can do. </s>
<s> I wouldn't even consider using an iPad for this, as not only is it relatively large, but it is lacking in so many of the functions I need to do this work on the road. </s>
<s> I know it is blasphemy to say this, but I fail to see what is so amazingly good about this toy - no webcam, no keyboard, no WiFi, no..... and so the list goes on. </s>
<s> It seems to be to be nothing more than a rather simple toy for kids to play on - if their dads are rich. </s>
<s> Compare the cost of an iPad with a real computer, such as the EeePC, and compare the functions they have, and the choice should be easy in my view. </s>
<s> I would say that really depends on a lot of things. </s>
<s> The first is you want it for web surfing. </s>
<s> One of the largest used platforms program wise on the web is Adobe Flash Player. </s>
<s> This may change somewhat over the next few years as there are other software products getting stronger in the market which do the same thing, but are more efficient. </s>
<s> So unless Adobe upgrades or significantly updates flash player it will become less common. </s>
<s> However; mind the specific that it will be a big player for at least the next couple of years. </s>
<s> The iPad does not support it. </s>
<s> A Netbook does, I will also let you know there are many notebooks available for the same price line as the iPad which are much more capable. </s>
<s> These are called ultralights or referred to as UL notebooks. </s>
<s> The recent financial market state has made the prices on these units drop significantly. </s>
<s> So they are in the 400-1000 dollar market depending on exactly what specifications you want. </s>
<s> Most however are right in line with the iPad price wise. </s>
<s> The Netbook also has seen a recent upgrade in several classifications. </s>
<s> Intel released new Atom processors as well as graphics processors, so have ATI, and Nvidia the other larger producers in this market place. </s>
<s> As far as it goes Intel pretty much owns the GPU market in net or note book's. </s>
<s> That is changing somewhat as the other two generally supply more technically able equipment, but never the less Intel has also just upgraded there units. </s>
<s> The iPad also has several things not quite compatible with the wide cross compatible market now as well. </s>
<s> The storage space, included capabilities (USB, DVD reader, replaceable battery, actual keyboard and on and on) are not included in the iPad nor in many cases even adaptable. </s>
<s> If you want to do anything besides a very limited number of things (it does not even have an operating system(no not even Apple snow leaopard), no OS at all which means the only thing operational on it would be downloaded from the Apple market(the same one as for the iPhone/iPod). </s>
<s> The benefits of the UL series notebooks are multiple. </s>
<s> They are very light, as well as available in many configurations. </s>
<s> They have extended storage, USB ports as well as generally at least one of any other port you'll ever need, changeable batteries, long battery life usually between 7-10 hours is the norm although some go over that considerably, compatibility with 100's more programs, differing screen and body sizes. </s>
<s> So I would say there probably your best bet all around. </s>
<s> The tablet (generally referred to as the Slate) market is going to be much larger most likely before the start of the next school year. </s>
<s> As far as I know most known companies will be putting out at least 1 or 2 some more in this time span. </s>
<s> The smart phone market is also going to start changing considerably. </s>
<s> 4G service and functional 4G smart phones will begin hitting the market in the next couple of months. </s>
<s> The first to enable these will be Sprint who has had 4G coverage available in several large cities for about 6 months (check your needed areas as the cities are limited and generally at least mid-large cities only). </s>
<s> These are also going to change a lot of things about mobility as well as mobile device capabilities. </s>
<s> The market goes through changes so fast it is quite hard to keep up with it. </s>
<s> As far as advice goes I would recommend finding a good UL notebook there is specifically several Asus, MSI, ACER, and even a DELL unit which is 11&quot; ultralight and even as capable as many desktops for right at $1000.00 (that's specifically the Dell unit price I think it's called an MX11). </s>
<s> But Those other market players as well as HP all have some very nice UL notebooks out (in fact many have been released in the last 3 months almost continually). </s>
<s> So; I would say go that way, and get one of these affordable, yet quite capable ultralight notebooks. </s>
<s> You will be covered in all your needs. </s>
<s> You will have a unit that can do pretty much anything else you need. </s>
<s> The iPad I see as basically an up sized iPhone which is in many cases not as capable as the iPhone, while it does have slightly stronger hardware in it. </s>
<s> How much computer do you need? </s>
<s> If all you do is word processing then paying hundreds for a new word processor every three years is not economical. </s>
<s> my plan is to buy a netbook first, and then wait for the microsoft couriour. </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> The iPad DOES have a mic and a speaker. </s>
<s> And very few popular apps become useless without a camera - if that were true people would not be buying iPod Touches like crazy, which they are. </s>
<s> You obviously don't know that much about this stuff. </s>
<s> The iPad is not really a tablet PC because of its focus. </s>
<s> See a tablet PC is really just a laptop with a touch sensitive screen and yet people call that a different category because it has a new focus -- entering data in your normal PC programs with a stylus. </s>
<s> You come and make a netbook, which is just a smaller laptop and all of a sudden you have a new category because you have a new focus -- smaller way of carrying your PC programs -- theres more emphasis placed on portability. </s>
<s> Neither of these are really all that different from a laptop. </s>
<s> The iPad is a new category in the same way because its focus is on content delivery in the mid-sized package. </s>
<s> These netbooks and tablets are in the same size arena, but the focus is on running existing software that was designed for a different interface rather than content. </s>
<s> I have 10 tablet PCs at my disposal at work and I consider the stylus input method to be mostly annoying. </s>
<s> Maybe you don't get it, but that's OK. Others do and maybe you will once you see a few people using it or try it yourself. </s>
<s> Apple is about making devices people love and making money while they are doing it. </s>
<s> They are winning the game of making devices people love without any clear competitor and are certainly making money with the big leagues. </s>
<s> Market share is not inconsequential to them, but it is not how they define winning the game. </s>
<s> Take a look at last year's numbers and you see Apple reporting best quarters in profits every quarter and Microsoft falling. </s>
<s> many cell phones and portable devices do support flash...even my old PSP 1000 supports flash..... </s>
<s> Good points mostly, but missing some big ones. </s>
<s> Remote access is VERY good on the iPad to Windows, Linux and Mac computers. </s>
<s> One example, which may not be the one for corporate use, they just made an advertisement about was &quot;Here File File&quot; (herefilefile.com). </s>
<s> Citrix also makes an App. </s>
<s> They do make a stylus (Pogo makes one carried at Apple stores), but anyone that has used an multitouch device for any length of time (meaning maybe a couple of days) will tell you the finger is a million times better than a stylus for most tasks. </s>
<s> Nothing to drop, lose or break and it is very accurate. </s>
<s> I had a stylus on a handheld from work that I would often miss letters or clicks on, so that really shouldn't be a big issue. </s>
<s> You are right about most gloves, although they do make some that will work as well. </s>
<s> I don't think the SD card reader for iPad will support data transfer other than photos. </s>
<s> That has yet to be seen, but there are a bunch of great a wifi based apps that make it even easier than using a flash drive for some scenarios. </s>
<s> You simply start the app on the device (which is essentially a server), log in through the browser on your computer, and add files tot he iPad without having to copy to a flash drive, eject it, wait for it to mount, copy again to the device and the eject it. </s>
<s> Battery life on the Ipad is coming in at 10-12 hours of video watching based on real life examples from reviewers. </s>
<s> Its going to be awesome. </s>
<s> Of course, gaming with 3D graphics will cut that down, but I think it should easily beat the ASUS you mention. </s>
<s> I think spare batteries are over-rated. </s>
<s> The iPad will be able to use external batteries like the iPhone has, but most people really don't use them for either type of device. </s>
<s> Those batteries need to be used regularly or their ability to hold a charge decreases pretty fast. </s>

<s> Like alot of other people have said before, It will all matter what you need the device for. </s>
<s> Personally the iPad would do nothing I would need. </s>
<s> I have seen iPhone/iPod Touch apps, and ya they're cooler than most things I can do on my PC, but that doesn't work for my life. </s>
<s> I do basic web browsing, which just about every new device out there can do. </s>
<s> But on top of that I work with Vids/Pics/and Music alot, and alot of it. </s>
<s> For the basic needs of e-mails and small stuff like that both and iPad or Netbook sound fair. </s>
<s> The keyboard issue does bring up probably the biggest problem. </s>
<s> I don't know how the Touch Keyboard is going to be like on the iPad, but I know on my Acer Netbook, the keyboard is overly small. </s>
<s> I have large fingers which do make it difficult. </s>
<s> I don't think we can compare which one is better, the fact is, some people hate netbooks, some people hate tablet PC's It's not fair to judge something on your own choice, but be fair to both types of devices and look at what is trying to be done with them. </s>
<s> It sounds like you haven't. </s>
<s> What many of the posters have stated: 'it's a BIG iPod Touch.' </s>
<s> Push the button, it's on: instantly! </s>
<s> I'm sure that netbook has to be in some sort of sleep, standby, hibernate (or whatever the hell it's called)-mode before it's opened up and -wait for it- used, otherwise it's batteries would go flat. </s>
<s> DUH! </s>
<s> I said 'carrying a briefcase or under-the-arm 'satchel' -a 'satchel' or 'portfolio' is a flat case that holds papers or thin books or items inside that you carry around in your hand, under or in your arm, etc. </s>

<s> Slide the iPad out. </s>
<s> It's thin. </s>
<s> It will never fit in a pocket. </s>
<s> Like a netbook, it will not fit in a pocket... except maybe a coat pocket during the winter. </s>
<s> Multi-tasking: It's what's everyone keeps saying and not having a clue. </s>
<s> ITunes going, surfing, down loading emails or really, what multiple things are you referring to that you need to do? </s>
<s> You're just spewing out rubbish because everyone else is saying it. </s>
<s> 10 hour battery life (continuous) ain't good enough for you? </s>
<s> Are you going to be away from a outlet that long? </s>
<s> ( I won't comment about those other 'things') The things that are done now-a-days are just routine episodes of an electronic life style. </s>

<s> Go to the Apple site... if you're capable without looking awkward and straining your wrist and neck. </s>
<s> I used to be a big time apple fan and would brook no criticism of apple products from any one until a year ago. </s>
<s> It struck me when I looked dispassionately at the PC and Mac world last year that I was paying a lot more for prettied up kit with underwhelming hardware designed to run the OS well but to make more money for Apple than to provide better value for the end user who is stupid enough to give apple fanatical loyalty. </s>
<s> I and my family owned 3 powerbooks, 1 macbook, 3 macbook pros & 3 iphones in the last few years. </s>
<s> Now, most of us have dumped apple after Windows 7 was released and Android came about. </s>
<s> Crippled hardware is hard to tolerate and the deliberate intention of releasing a first &quot;dung&quot; generation only to upgrade it a year or so later with more options built in, is Apple's forte. </s>
<s> Look at iPhone and its built in rechargeable battery - customers sick of poor battery life & tied to apple for replacement. </s>
<s> Rumor has it that the next (4th) generation will have replaceable battery. </s>
<s> There are many more examples of this and I think Apple's Mac OSX was great in its time but it faces serious challenge from Windows 7. </s>
<s> I hated previous iterations of Windows but I and family & a large number of friends who used to be apple fans have switched to Win 7 again ! </s>
<s> iPad is for people who want a larger iPod Touch, that is it a fancy ebook reader, whatever the apple fans might say (get a life people, there are better products than &quot;pretty&quot; apple-crippled products out there). </s>
<s> I was one before, only now I stopped looking at the &quot;ooh&quot; factor. </s>
<s> I have a 17&quot; MBPro & a 12&quot; HP 2730P at the moment, the latter runs Win 7. </s>
<s> My MBPro is full spec late 2008, 2.6Ghz etc & I thought it used to run pretty fast. </s>
<s> I do all the maintenance etc. </s>
<s> But my little HP is an absolute screamer, believe me & lots of people have converted to W7, not that much different from OSX now. </s>
<s> The MBPro will shortly go and I intend to replace it with a better spec HP laptop. </s>
<s> Netbooks are a lot cheaper, offer sleep mode with resume, battery life is pretty good these days. </s>
<s> As with all things, better to get a product with more options (cheaper too !) </s>
<s> than a crippled one. </s>
<s> If you get iPad, there will come a time (sooner than you think) when you will absolutely hate not having a physical keyboard and not being able to multitask. </s>
<s> Whatever your proposed current use, it will change once the wow factor has gone. </s>
<s> Look long and hard before you buy iPad, a previous post by Wolfie2k5 - post 20, is superlative and offers a detailed comparison between the PC & Mac products. </s>
<s> Die hard apple fans can't jump at me, I was one until recently ! </s>
<s> As soon as a decent Android phone appears, I am dumping iPhone, almost there. </s>
<s> I don't see why I should contribute to the wealth of a cynical company which tries to hold its customers hostage to crippled products. </s>
<s> Not sure if Apple does anything towards charity, I don't think it matches the Gates foundation and Warren Oates philanthropy. </s>
<s> BEAUTY of body is only skin deep, it is what is inside that should make the decision for most people. </s>
<s> Fortunately, with computer hardware it is easy to tell which components have been used, unlike with human beings who may look stunning on the outside but completely unpredictable inside. </s>
<s> In the end, it is a philosophy. </s>
<s> It is easy for people to justify a purchase any which way, especially if they can afford it but I certainly stop to think these days about how good a product is inside and how well it will serve me now & in future, rather than the &quot;wow' factor. </s>
<s> While this post might come across as a mildly socialist and anti-apple rant, I am glad I got it off my chest. </s>
<s> I think the iPad in its present form is absolute crap and merely representative of Apple's cynical exploitation of its fan base, whatever said fan base may say to themselves to buy another &quot;bright, shiny, toy from God&quot;. </s>
<s> Happy Easter, gents and ladies. </s>
<s> For me the key reason to buy the iPad would be the possibility to use it as replacement of sheetmusic. </s>
<s> It would be the final solution of the eternal fight with the sheets. </s>
<s> It's great to see a list of pros and cons; and to be honest I'd forgotten there would be so many cons and expense to get around some of them. </s>

<s> Once again, Safari, the browser with that lacey swiss cheese for security was the culprit. </s>
<s> The bottom line here is Apple does NOT take security very seriously. </s>
<s> They do a half-arsed job with what they've got and the only reason nobody has gone on a serious hacking spree with them is there aren't enough Macs and iP_____ devices out there to justify it. </s>
<s> Why hack a platform with a few million total targets in the field when you can hack a platform that has close to a BILLION likely targets in the field? </s>
<s> The bottom line is NO platform is 100% bulletproof. </s>
<s> Not Windows, Not OSX, not even Linux. </s>
<s> As far as the content is concerned - As I said in my original post - You CAN view your electronic versions of Playboy and Maxim on your home PC or a laptop or whatever. </s>

<s> Nor can you read any of 30,000 odd titles from Amazon or B&N's ebook library - because they've been deemed too racy. </s>
<s> It's a question of how and where and when you want to view the content. </s>
<s> Imagine if you're a woman who likes reading those Harlequin Romances. </s>
<s> Odds are those aren't welcome on your iPad. </s>
<s> They're considered soft core porn. </s>
<s> It's one thing for Apple to say that they are NOT going to carry anything like that in THEIR store. </s>
<s> It's another for them to say you can't read the content you've bought and paid for on the device you've BOUGHT AND PAID FOR because they don't like it. </s>

<s> ... our choices in that price range at the time were a 17&quot; beast of a machine he wouldn't be able to carry far on his own, one of the various, ridiculously priced, almost useless ipods, an archos 5 or the netbook. </s>
<s> i must say he, his mother and i are all quite pleased with my decision. </s>
<s> the functionality, connectivity and portability come together quite well for a 5 yr old who's quite accustomed to having everything. </s>
<s> he can skype his grand parents who live several hours away at the drop of a hat and have a face to face conversation with them regardless what platform everyone is running. </s>
<s> he goes online and shows us what toys he wants for birthdays and such. </s>
<s> he can switch from game to game without a second thought without us having to get up, stop what we're doing and search through all his disks to put one in his wii that's mounted below the tv mount hanging from the ceiling. </s>
<s> he makes his own shopping list by copying links into a word document that can be accessed at a later date. </s>
<s> the battery lasts him at least 6 hours no matter what he's doing. </s>
<s> when we're out we don't have to worry about an extra socket to plug into for him. </s>
<s> video, sound, functionality, game controllers, backup, web surfing, gaming, flash games, content, etc. </s>
<s> ... all non issues... no need to go to the app STORE and BUY everything he already has... all for about the price of an ipod touch with a laughable amount of storage space. </s>
<s> all in all i guess my point is there's a suitable gadget for every purpose without having to revert to the ridiculous premiums of buying steve jobs' highly proprietary, overpriced crap. </s>
<s> i mean if you want your warranty voided because you downloaded the one thing you bought the gadget for... go apple. </s>
<s> if you are completely incapable of fixing anything yourself and like searching out places to get your stuff fixed... go apple. </s>
<s> if you like paying premiums because nothing breaks that's actually under warranty... go apple. </s>
<s> if you like not being allowed to do anything you haven't paid for... go apple. </s>
<s> if you like paying extra for standard hardware like a keyboard which then would have to be lugged around separately... go apple. </s>
<s> if you like paying more for a product that comes with less functionality... go apple. </s>
<s> and so on and so on... i understand paying a premium for something reliable with a decent os but it's not necessary. </s>
<s> so, while i agree to some extent and would not use a netbook myself there is a purpose for one. </s>
<s> there are also pc's, laptops, and netbooks you can purchase that come already loaded with linux if the outstanding number of threats aimed at windows products are something that worry you. </s>
<s> there are options for everybody... even the fanbois... at any rate, i would not get an ipad myself. </s>
<s> for the money there are better options. </s>
<s> if it's portability you're after there are more portable options. </s>
<s> they don't have to be windows based either. </s>
<s> if it's functionality there are more functional options in the same or a lower price range everywhere. </s>
<s> if it's the os you're looking for i'd hate to say it but do your homework and hack it. </s>
<s> before you do that consider what you need the os for and decide if that's right for you because once you have it you're limited to what it can do and the warranty is void. </s>
<s> basically, good luck getting physical help for a hackintosh. </s>
<s> on the note of limitations, every os has them. </s>
<s> if any other company came out with this product, with the same applications and price it would be a bomb. </s>
<s> don't ya think? </s>
<s> If the iPad is as user friendly with great apps and reliable as my family's iPhones, MacBooks, and iMac it is a no brainer - get the iPad. </s>
<s> This is freely written with no mind control from Steve Jobs... from long experience, I just know a good product and company. </s>
<s> Personally: Dont think so. </s>
<s> Wont be on a smelly line to buy an iAnything behind crazed people who just have to have this. </s>
<s> Economy will benefit: I am sure the TV networks will be swamped with Apple commercials for this thing and they will be so happy to get the Apple money in ad revenue from the cazed people who buy the things. </s>
<s> so it is circle of sorts and it promotes and enhances our economy to a degree and for that we should be thankful People should also go and buy a new GM Frod or Chrysler car as soon as they can research the best prices using their new iPad: that would really rev up the US economy 100% mark up on this thing from info on other sites so good for you Apple and Jobs for extorting that kind of profit from your crazed drones. </s>
<s> Not me. </s>
<s> Have PCs and spend too much on creating web updates and email and Excel and Word and other programs as it is: dont want more hardware and worry about more batteries to charge. </s>

<s> I am typing this, while on vacation right now in my Condo on my Eee PC Netbook. </s>
<s> I have between me and my wife currently on this trip the following; this netbook, 2 motorola Droids and an Apple iTouch. </s>
<s> The netbook was my purchase specifically for vacations, we have a laptop that we used to travel with but it was heavy, I couldn't watch any movies onboard long flights with it and in general seamed like too much computer for travel. </s>
<s> This netbook though, has proven to be a great purchase. </s>
<s> Inflight, my wife plugged in her headphones (noise-cancelling) and watched a movie. </s>
<s> In the room at night, we have kept in-touch with our own e-mails, uploaded some photos to our family blog. </s>
<s> Downloaded 2GB of current photos taken on my digital camera just as a back-up. </s>
<s> Some may wonder why I would bother to do this, but the family that was with ours for a few days, lost there camera while outside somewhere. </s>
<s> I backed up our photos that same night, just in case. </s>
<s> The Droids (which we LOVE) keeps us connected through out our day and has helped us navigate and capture some additional action photos when we were seperated (bulit-in 5MP Camera). </s>
<s> Now my iTouch, well, I think it is sexy, thin, it does start right up instead of booting up, but it has been reduced to a game machine to keep my 5 year old busy and to play some Adrea Bocceli songs at night in order to get her to sleep. </s>
<s> The Droids have pretty much replaced the iTouch, in our family anyway. </s>
<s> Back to the Netbook, I mentioned movies before, I convert my DVD's so they can be saved and played on my computer. </s>
<s> I did this before going on vacation on my home PC, then using the bulit in 802.11N, transferred the movies to the netbook. </s>
<s> What if I had forgotten to do this ahead of time, well, aside from the airplane (unless your flight has WiFi) you can log into you Netflix account or use hulu.com or tv.com or whatever you normally use. </s>
<s> The iPad, seams pretty, less sexy because of size, but also less functional, upgradable and overall less usefull. </s>
<s> Did I mention my netbook has a 250GB hard drive, 2GB of ram (upgraded by me), wireless N, a Hybrid engine which allows it to monitor the overall system to effiectly distribute the power effectivily. </s>
<s> Bottom line 10 hours battery life, simply amazing! </s>
<s> Good luck with your choice, hope this hepled. </s>
<s> He is referring specifically to the tablet which does not support flash. </s>
<s> Perhaps you should read what you write! </s>
<s> This is admittedly tangential, but I also would recommend against HP. </s>
<s> They've been repairing my notebook for 2 months now, leaving me stranded without a computer for that long. </s>
<s> the ipad is more better because its less bulkly and has more memory and its touch screen. </s>
<s> If you are wanting accessibility options, then certainly go with the netbook. </s>
<s> I have not yet found a screen reader that beats Microsoft Narrator for keyboard navigation(which is mostly what I do when I am not using my tablet PC). </s>
<s> I have found few keystrokes that it does not echo in Windows Vista and Windows 7. </s>
<s> In fact, in Windows 7, it will occasionally overlap itself. </s>
<s> That is cool sounding. </s>
<s> Some things that I like to hear are the numbers 31, 41, and 81 and the text Weirder on a Helicopter with the up arrow. </s>
<s> I have looked at Apple's onscreen keyboard for Mac OS Tiger, but it is simply a viewer. </s>
<s> I am also unsure as to whether or not Mac OS has a magnification program. </s>
<s> I also don't know if it magnifies the entire screen. </s>
<s> In fact, that feature was added to Microsoft's Magnifier application in windows 7. </s>
<s> It was not an option in Windows Vista and below. </s>
<s> THERE IS NOT A SINGLE DOUBT, when comparing it to a netbook, ipad is twice as better than a netbook, but remember not better than a laptop as of yet. </s>
<s> I mean the ipad you now have the touch screen... nice apps going on, especially for your browsing experience is much much better on the ipad, i'd say go for the ipad! </s>
<s> And i think you get the same amount of storage just as a netbook. </s>
<s> nice experience with photos, movies, videos, etc. </s>
<s> What netbook did you buy that you have so much praise for? </s>
<s> Both have limitations but as an iPhone programmer I feel the iPad has even more limitations. </s>
<s> Do you like a real keyboatd? </s>
<s> Forget the iPad. </s>
<s> Do you want to watch streaming video with no limitations (forget Hulu)? </s>
<s> Forget the iPad. </s>
<s> Do you want to protect the screen when you carry it around? </s>
<s> Forget the iPad. </s>
<s> Do you like to play DVDs and download easily? </s>
<s> Forget the iPad. </s>
<s> Do you want a web browser for less then $500? </s>
<s> Forget the iPad. </s>
<s> But.... Do you like to be trendy and don't care about the ease of use then blow your money on an iPad! </s>
<s> because aside from that this thing kinda sucks..to just be completely honest. </s>
<s> compare any netbook to this thing and it's pretty clear how limited it actually is. </s>
<s> oh and um if you buy an hp netbook you can load snowlepoard onto it. </s>
<s> I'm seriously hoping that these &quot;apple people&quot; know that it's only the op system that prevent (but not really) viruses. </s>

<s> It will be replaced with the Alienware Aurora ( http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/alienware-aurora?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs ). </s>
<s> is more the gui and ui. </s>
<s> the windows os is really annoying, and the ipad may not have usb or a built in camera (apple might integrate one of these in the future). </s>
<s> apple makes things simpler. </s>
<s> Microsoft doesn't get the concept of a simple ui and a nice and clean gui. </s>
<s> all f apples products have little fun feedback effects, thats what makes everything so fun, plus have you seen the trackpad on the netbooks? </s>
<s> they are so tiny, like maybe 2-4 in by 2-3 in across! </s>
<s> they are very frustrating to use and they are also super slow. </s>
<s> xp was made for a full sized computer, not some sad little excuse for a computer. </s>
<s> if i had enough money for an ipad, i might buy one, because my macbook pro is really expensive ($1300) and i don't want it to get lost or stolen. </s>
<s> the ipad is an excellent step into the future for apple, its not just a fun way to get online, check email and play games. </s>
<s> touch screens are awesome, and lots of people like them. </s>
<s> netbooks don't have touch screens. </s>
<s> i know it would be weird if they did. </s>
<s> plus their screens are too small to get an effective one integrated. </s>
<s> even if you did, it'd be kinda weird to touch one of them because they are so small, and it'd be in a weird position. </s>
<s> another bad thing about netbooks are their small screens and small hard drive space. </s>
<s> it might seem weird that i'm complaining abut their space when the ipad has less, but flash technology has progressed less than hard disk tech has since its so new (1980 for flash tech, 1956 hard disks, according to Wikipedia). </s>
<s> plus if they got any higher, itd be really really expensive. </s>
<s> the ipod classic has so much memory because it has an actual hard disk. </s>
<s> (apple fan!) </s>
<s> no! </s>
<s> the netbook approach will only cause you pain and suffering! </s>
<s> the os is slow and it has so little ram!!!! </s>
<s> read my other post above </s>
<s> ok we agree on one thing! </s>
<s> so the ipad is somehow less limited? </s>
<s> your turn </s>
<s> If you really dislike windows, or if you want the speed (or likely faster) of boot of the iPad, look at Ubuntu Netbook Remix or the KDE version at kubuntu.org for the dislike windows, or Moblin if you want something quick and light, respectively. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> It is quite a gimmick unfortunately only WIFI at present, have to get 3G support from ATT for no contract useage , can be used as needed, then only WIFI if OK by you. </s>
<s> IT is just different and excellent graphically to a net book. </s>
<s> It will give you something to play with as you travel that is colorfully excelelnt to view. </s>
<s> you will not get tired of small print as on netbook....I do have one (netbook) and it is all around that IPAD is not. </s>
<s> IPAD is a niche functional instrument, artistically crafted, at first very simple like a diamond and a sbeualtiful as you look at it. </s>
<s> Keyboard excellent.....for what it is ....a readable Blackberry or like device. </s>
<s> no multitasking. </s>
<s> It is not a netbook as yet or maybe never intended to be such. </s>
<s> great for the media minded and EXTREMELY VIEWABLE is its hallmark. </s>
<s> the future for it is not here yet. </s>
<s> My opinion </s>
<s> I sort of agree with you about the pros and cons of tablets versus notebooks, but I still feel strongly that the iPad, in spite of the huge volumes of praise it is receiving, isn't much more than a stripped down computer, that is tricky to input data on and not really a serious contender if one wishes to actually work on your device. </s>
<s> At bottom, a super expensive toy for people who have everything and a lot of disposable income too. </s>
<s> A &quot;real&quot; computer has to be a better investment than the iPad (just look at the price of the thing!) </s>
<s> Or better yet, go out and buy something like an EeePC, small, cheap, does everything any other computer will do, has a camera, a microphone, a keyboard, long battery endurance,works with Flash, can multitask, easy to carry around and generally a thousand times more useful than things like the iPad. </s>
<s> In passing, I wonder if we stopped using the euphemism &quot;Apps&quot; and reverted to calling them what they really are, which is small software programmes, that people would be so comfortable with them? </s>
<s> Just a thought LOL </s>
<s> Depending on where Lee lives, he may or may not receive coverage from AT&T. </s>

<s> Add more memory or a faster cpu? </s>
<s> I can do that too. </s>
<s> The bottom line is this: When you're trying to decide between two things, first you should decide if you have to. </s>
<s> I am currently enjoying an iPad-like touch screen with everything Lenovo, Splashtop and Win7 has to offer. </s>
<s> Sorry, the screen was the only thing the iPad really won in the &quot;vs. netbook&quot; fight anyway. </s>
<s> an idiaper with a question like that the ipad is a waste of money buy a netbook and get over it. </s>
<s> I suppose using that logic, you could go with an ultra-mobile PC. </s>
<s> Those are even less bulky and also have a touch screen. </s>
<s> Movistar supports the IPhone in Panama, so I suppose they also support the IPad. </s>
<s> As I stated before, finding the right computer or, in Lee's case, whether the iPad or a netbook is better, is not always easy. </s>
<s> You have to simply be patient, kirk_watstien. </s>
<s> The question is legitimate and maybe you have already made your decision on the topic, but it seems as though Lee may or may not have. </s>
<s> I'll tell you why this comparison bugs me #1 the ipad is NOT as functional as a net book (anyone who knows how to read specs knows this..so what question IS there?) </s>
<s> #2 the ipad doesn't do a single thing a netbook can do except that maybe the screen res is marginally better...so what. </s>
<s> the ipad fail product and if you can find a legitimate function of the ipad that beats out any netbook? </s>
<s> be sure to clue me and the rest of us in on exactly what that may be the ipad should just go away </s>
<s> Perhaps in that case the main difference between the iPad and a netbook is the fact that the iPad has a touch sensitive screen. </s>
<s> One could argue though (and I sort of have) that a tablet PC has one of those, so go with that. </s>
<s> That is my recommendation, although as has been stated many times before, it all depends on what Lee plans on doing on the device. </s>
<s> netbooks have more storage, the ipad has iphone storage, how rediculously garbage is that right? </s>
<s> Now bear in mind, I am in NO way defending the iPad. </s>
<s> However, the iPad's storage capacities are actually similar to a lot of netbooks on the market. </s>
<s> I've seen netbooks advertised with 8gb solid-state hard drives. </s>
<s> Now that being said, my netbook has a 250gb SATA hard drive with a safety kill in case of dropping. </s>
<s> This isn't as much of a concern with solid-states. </s>
<s> However, that is at the high (iPad priced) end of the spectrum. </s>
<s> If you're not worried about putting your entire movie library on your netbook, want to save money AND have a more &quot;sturdy&quot; hard drive, I'd suggest picking up a $250 netbook with a 64gb solid-state hard drive. </s>
<s> I agree with the previous poster, Apple is for people who are &quot;forced&quot; to buy it... </s>
<s> There are many mini-laptops, palmtops and other arrays of choices - other than Apple, actually; for example: laptops.toshiba.com/laptops/mini-notebook/NB200 </s>
<s> I cannot believe the passion and myopia on these forums between Apple 'fanboys' and 'haters'. </s>
<s> Staggering!! </s>
<s> Anyway, the problem as I see it is that people are comparing the iPad with a netbook, or worse, a laptop. </s>
<s> It just isn't!! </s>
<s> It is as meaningless as comparing my cellphone with my toaster. </s>
<s> I don't know if it is the Apple haters as a means of justifying their position of perceived superiority, or the fanboys trying to win an argument. </s>
<s> Anyway, its is not a PC, so the sooner we all accept that, the sooner we can figure out what it is. </s>
<s> Personally, I can probably be classified by the haters as a fanboy. </s>
<s> I own an iMac, a Macbook Pro and an iPhone. </s>
<s> I like Apple products. </s>
<s> There, I have admitted it. </s>
<s> They say that is the first step to recovery. </s>
<s> I think the iPad is very cool, but I doubt I would have a use for it personally. </s>
<s> I am looking at it for a possible clipboard replacement at work, for filling in forms etc. </s>
<s> Also, my wife wants a laptop to sit up in bed and google (like I'm doing now). </s>
<s> I would consider getting her an iPad, because her text entry would be minimal. </s>
<s> As the occasional person has tried to say amongst the madness, it depends on your personal use. </s>
<s> That's what I tell people who can't decide between a mac and a pc. </s>
<s> The iPad doesn't run windoze. </s>
<s> It runs apps. </s>
<s> It will be great for books and photos, and for googling. </s>
<s> It won't be any good for MS Word or Excel. </s>
<s> It won't be any good for lots of typing, unless you really like virtual keyboards. </s>
<s> Personally, I am surprised at how quickly I can type on my iPhone, so I wouldn't have a problem. </s>
<s> I know most people would hate it, so there is no point in pretending otherwise. </s>
<s> I am still wondering what the defining app will be, to make people understand the iPad. </s>
<s> Maybe, once Apple put out a model with an iSight camera, someone will release a telephone keypad dock, to use it as a video phone on the kitchen bench. </s>
<s> Skype might really take off on an iPad with those features. </s>
<s> The fact that it has already sold one million units means the iPad won't die, but I expect it will have a niche market. </s>
<s> Whoever defines that niche might become quite rich as a result </s>
<s> &quot;That's what I tell people who can't decide between a mac and a pc.&quot; (in.house) Why would you not get both? </s>
<s> You stated that you are a fan of Apple's products, so, why would you not just get a PC (P-ersonal) (C-omputer) that runs Mac OS. </s>
<s> This could be your primary PC. </s>
<s> You could then have a secondary PC that runs Windows 7. </s>
<s> Windows 7 Professional or higher is recommended if you have Windows XP applications that either work slowly or do not work at all in Windows 7 natively. </s>
<s> It is mind boggling how people always or almost always assume that a &quot;PC&quot; runs Windows (or Windoze*, as some people spell it (rather incorrectly)) and nothing else. </s>
<s> If a &quot;PC&quot; runs Windows and a &quot;Mac&quot; runs Mac OS, then what is a computer that runs Linux called. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that PC and Mac are both already taken, so you cannot use those terms. </s>
<s> Perhaps PC does not stand for Personal Computer at all, but rather Picasa (a product by Google for Windows) ( http://picasa.google.com/ ) Chess [Titans] (a game that is preloaded onto Windows Vista and Windows 7, but is not available for Mac OS) (I am not referring to the Chess game that does come preloaded with Mac OS.) </s>
<s> * Windoze: Once you show me a legitimate copy of the Micro$oft (a poorly spelled variation of Microsoft) (I guess that App$e looks much too weird and they cannot think of a way to poorly spell Mac (because they do not want to use Macinto$h because that may offend Apple too much and would be against thir personal taste), so people do not use that, although they might get away with App|e) Windoze (not Microsoft Windows) operating system, then perhaps you can be justified in the use of the incorrect spelling of the name, but you might find it difficult to show that to me. </s>
<s> Ok, in.house you're right. </s>
<s> Just about everyone on this thread is guilty of comparing an iPad to a netbook. </s>
<s> I did it with a specific netbook. </s>
<s> If you're wondering why we keep doing so, it's because comparing the two is EXACTLY what this is about. </s>
<s> The question was posed by someone who is trying to decide between them. </s>
<s> You cannot make a decision between two or more things without directly comparing them to see which is a more logical choice. </s>
<s> On behalf of the &quot;haters&quot; in the group putting down the iPad because we don't understand it, I would like to say thank you. </s>
<s> Thank you for explaining to us that it doesn't run windows. </s>
<s> I'm sure no one here knew that. </s>
<s> I hope that someone turns the iPad into a video phone too. </s>
<s> I mean, it would be refreshing to see an Apple iDevice on which you could actually make calls. </s>
<s> And it would be revolutionary to be able to talk to someone while seeing them in real time. </s>
<s> I'll bet they'd call it video chat. </s>
<s> It's just too bad you wouldn't be able to do it with a netbook, oh wait... Ok here, the issue is not &quot;Apple vs. PC&quot; at this point. </s>
<s> The issue is bang for the buck. </s>
<s> You can get a top-of-the-line iPad with 64gb of memory and 3G to the tune of $830.00. </s>
<s> I didn't pay that much for my laptop and trust me, it decimates the iPad with the exception of touchscreen. </s>
<s> That's why I bought my netbook. </s>
<s> It's a Lenovo Ideapad S10-3T. </s>
<s> My first post (page 7 I think) on this thread gave a nice list of a lot of the goodies it has. </s>
<s> Yes, I am allowed to suggest it because the question at the top of this thread asked us to do so (before you start preaching on that one.) </s>
<s> It cost me $630.00 (that's $200 LESS than the nearest spec'd iPad and way MORE than most netbooks) and I paid more than most do because I &quot;had to have it&quot; when it first came out. </s>
<s> It does almost everything my laptop does AND unlike the iPad I have choices. </s>
<s> I choose the OS, the software or &quot;apps&quot; (not limited by an app store,) what I choose to plug into it (usb ports, SD Card slot, VGA, headphone/mic jacks as opposed to an iPod jack.) </s>
<s> I turn my camera on and video chat (you know, that Star Trek stuff you can't do with a netbook.) </s>
<s> The especially nice part is that if I decide to some day start using it in a manner other than that for which it was purchased, I can. </s>
<s> I don't ever have to say &quot;Damn, I wish this thing had a keyboard&quot; or &quot;wouldn't it be nice to have a touchscreen right now.&quot; It takes the only truly useful thing about the iPad (capacitive multi-touch touch screen) and integrates it into a machine that's already got the iPad beat on just about every other level. </s>
<s> Now granted, it doesn't have that Dazzling iPhone OS (sarcasm in case you were wondering,) only Windows 7 (or whatever other OS I install) but it does have pinch-to zoom, swipe-to-scroll and all the other multi-touch functions iPad has. </s>
<s> Also and I know I'm not alone on this one, I like gadgets. </s>
<s> I have several gadgets on my desktop and I use them often. </s>
<s> What's nice is, if one day I decide to hate gadgets, I get rid of them. </s>
<s> Now if I got an iPad because &quot;gadgets are useless anyway&quot; and woke up one morning wanting me some good ol' gadget fun I'd be S.O.L. </s>
<s> Although, that's ok because 6 months after I got an iPad, old Stevie boy would release another &quot;magical product&quot; that still wouldn't support gadgets or Flash or any other thing deemed useful by 90% of society but it would have a camera. </s>
<s> No, not a video camera. </s>
<s> A still frame camera with low resolution. </s>
<s> But it would be magical. </s>
<s> I would buy it for $1000 and love it so much. </s>
<s> That is until Steve told me my device wasn't special anymore. </s>
<s> Because now Steve has added a low res video camera. </s>
<s> Another $1200 and it could be mine. </s>
<s> $3000 and two years later I finally have something that'll shut those damn PC guys up. </s>
<s> Oh wait, there's that stupid little icon where a Flash video is supposed to be. </s>
<s> Damn you Steve! </s>
<s> You promised to kill Flash! </s>
<s> This is supposed to be in HTML5 by now! </s>
<s> I know you only control like 3% of the market share but that's no excuse! </s>
<s> I thought you controlled the internet! </s>
<s> And where the hell are my gadgets!?! </s>
<s> Now, to really throw you for a loop. </s>
<s> I like iProducts, they have a lot of potential. </s>
<s> They are indeed wonderful devices, however a champion quarter horse tied to a post will never reach its full potential. </s>
<s> Untie the horse and let it really run or shoot the damn thing and put it out of its misery...Steve. </s>
<s> I am deployed in Iraq and had my iPad mailed to me by my wife. </s>
<s> After receiving it we shot this video using the iPad for the transitions. </s>
<s> I hope this helps convince you. </s>
<s> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epv7qwKZPZQ Military + iPad + Kanye West = Amazing! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> While the video you made is pretty cool, it isn't anything you couldn't have done with literally ANY device with a screen that displays video. </s>
<s> You could've easily done the same video with an Archos Tablet or even a netbook. </s>
<s> In fact with my windows 7 netbook I can download probably hundreds of different video editing programs to do it with, on top of Microsoft's own software that could've done just as good of a job. </s>
<s> Don't get me wrong, it's a great video. </s>
<s> It just doesn't really show the iPad doing anything a netbook (or a netvertible) couldn't do. </s>
<s> In fact, if you had used a netvertible you could've had the screen swiveling around and flipping through different video clips. </s>
<s> Just to be clear, I love the video and God bless you for serving your country, I just can't see buying that thing just because it survived overseas shipping. </s>
<s> Where's the CAMERA/VIDEO???? </s>
<s> If the ipad had this, I'd have bought it by now...without it, it seems ironic to have applications for pictures and video, without the ability to actually have the capability to SHOOT video ON the iPAD!!!! </s>
<s> Am I the only person that is pissed off about this? </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> There are two reasons the iPad doesn't have a camera. </s>
<s> First and foremost it's so they can release one with a camera in the future and get people to buy ANOTHER iPad. </s>
<s> Secondly, they knew they were releasing the iPhone 4 with a front facing camera for video chat and didn't want people deciding not to upgrade their phones due to already having video chat on a much more conveniently sized screen. </s>
<s> Lets face it, video chat is the one REALLY cool feature on the new iPhone but quite frankly it would be rediculous to pull out your tiny little phone to chat on when you could use your iPad and actually SEE the person to whom you're talking. </s>
<s> My netbook has a camera, a microphone, a physical keyboard AND a touchscreen. </s>
<s> For anyone looking to stop drinking the Kool-Aid, it's called the Lenovo Ideapad S10-3T and it beats the iPad like it stole something! </s>
<s> To me the choice is either the iPad or a power packed mini Notebook like the Sony Z series that has a real Intel Core i7 processor. </s>
<s> The iPad is a great travel companion. </s>
<s> It has a quick startup and great interface. </s>
<s> And it is sleek with good battery life, slip easily in my camera messager/sling bag or diaper bag. </s>
<s> It does a great job on web surfing and has lots of apps and ibooks to keep my kids occupied with productive educational games and story book reading. </s>
<s> I use it with my kids during dining and in Disneyland while waiting in line. </s>
<s> The screen is big enough so you won't strain your eyes, and I don't have to worry about my kids losing my smartphone that has personal info. </s>
<s> It is also great for looking up info quickly anywhere, and substitute for paper newspaper and magazines (going green). </s>
<s> However it is not really for business productivity, cannot run JAVA or Flash applications. </s>
<s> I have the 3G version and the iPad is the best portable entertainment device. </s>
<s> For business productivity and for running power hungry softwares like Photoshop CS4 etc, the Sony Z series is a little but powerful notebook. </s>
<s> There are other PC and Mac notebooks that cost less but more bulky. </s>
<s> As for netbooks, I never like them. </s>
<s> They don't have the power of the notebooks, and they are more clunky than the iPad. </s>
<s> Netbooks may become obsolete one day when more portable tablets start to flood the market, and more powerful notebooks become smaller and cheaper. </s>
<s> I looked at Sony's Z series computers. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Those are expensive at $1,919.99 apiece. </s>
<s> That is the starting price. </s>
<s> At a price like that, I would hope that it is a tablet PC, although based on the display description, I am thinking that it is not one of those. </s>
<s> 2. a resolution of 1,920 (one thousand nine hundred twenty, or, without the comma, 1920, nineteen hundred twenty*) 1,080 (one thousand eighty* with or without the comma) pixels would seem quite small on a 13.1 inch screen. </s>
<s> * Of course, this is my unnatural interpretation of the numbers. </s>
<s> A more natural approach would be to exclude commas (Why this is done is beyond me since commas only make the number _easier_ to read.) </s>
<s> and pronounce such a resolution as nineteen-twenty (Wow, I think that needs a hyphen. </s>
<s> It looks weird. </s>
<s> There, that's much better!) </s>
<s> by ten-eighty (That also looks weird without a hyphen. </s>
<s> How about I go and fix that! </s>
<s> There, all better!) </s>
<s> They still sound weird though. </s>
<s> Numbers have become so complex nowadays. </s>
<s> I wonder how they are taught in elementary and middle school. </s>
<s> Is zero even taught or is all the letter O (such as 2101 being [oddly] pronounced as twenty-one O one) (I pronounce that twenty-one hundred one.)? </s>
<s> Although, if it was simply a number (as opposed to something such as a year), then it would actally be typed or written as 2,101 and pronounced two thousand one hundred one. </s>
<s> Am I the only person that thinks such pronunciation of numbers as the one commonly used is odd? </s>
<s> Pehaps I am. </s>
<s> I was deciding between getting a ultra portable all-in-one device versus a portable powerful notebook that can do some serious computing on the go. </s>
<s> I use Photoshop CS4 and HD video editing softwares quite a bit. </s>
<s> And I prefer doing these on my more powerful desktop with a 24 in screen. </s>
<s> I have several notebooks. </s>
<s> I found the lower priced configurations with dual core processors are really not adequate for HD video editing. </s>
<s> The better configured notebooks (even my Mac powerbook) can easily cost $3000. </s>
<s> So the Sony Z series pricing is not that bad considering its configuration and size. </s>
<s> But the smaller screens on the notebooks are really subpar compared to my 24 in screen at home. </s>
<s> Furthermore, I seldom need to do serious computing or photo/video editing while traveling. </s>
<s> So I don't really need the portable power of the Sony Z series. </s>
<s> The iPad is just right for what I need for traveling and on-the-go. </s>
<s> Its interface is snappy and intuitive, even my 5 year old and baby can enjoy some educational games. </s>
<s> It is also an excellent photo album to show off photos, a good iBook reader, internet surfer, and more. </s>
<s> It is better than the netbook in terms of user interface and makes netbook feel clumpsy to use. </s>
<s> Since I got the iPad 3G, I haven't used my notebooks. </s>
<s> The only time I turned on my desktop is when I need to do Photo or HD video editing, use JAVA applications for work, or need to type a lot for work presentations, etc. </s>
<s> The netbook does not have the power of the notebook and does not have the sleek and entertainment element of the iPad. </s>
<s> http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=ycZUKTZczW The price is about the same as an iPad but the specs are better in nearly every way. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> this discussion is about deciding between a NETBOOK and an iPad. </s>
<s> Obviously there are powerful, small laptops out there but that's not the point of this discussion. </s>
<s> If we were having a debate between Camaros and Mustangs it would be irrelevant to mention that you own a Corvette. </s>
