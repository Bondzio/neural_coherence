<s> I have been using the free Retrospect Express HD utility that cam with one of my external HDs. </s>
<s> The program has grown increasingly undependable and buggy. </s>
<s> Do you recommend another (totally free, not 30 day demo) data backup utility? </s>
<s> I use it for backing up data from/to external and internal HDs Thanks! </s>
<s> Personally, I use the good old command line xcopy with the appropriate switches in a batchfile. </s>
<s> Other people use SYNCBACK from http://www.download.com/SyncBack/3000-2242_4-10413802.html or SYNCTOY from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E0FC1154-C975-4814-9649-CCE41AF06EB7&displaylang=en Both are free. </s>
