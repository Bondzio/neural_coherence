I'm not sure what you mean by upgrading the memory to 3.
Memory capacity is measured in MB or GB, (Megabytes or Gigabytes), eg the RAM memory on my Dell is 2 GB, or 2000 MB.
I suspect you mean you have added a 3rd stick of memory to the motherboard, but that tells us little.
Also, adding a larger hard disk will not improve performance unless your previous hard disk was full to capacity.
Even then, if you are still using the hard disk which is full, performance will not improve until you reduce the amount of data on that full disk.
The hard disk is just a storage device for data.
Performance can be affected by things such as &quot;viruses and spyware&quot;, or &quot;too many programs loading at startup&quot;, or &quot;poor performing video card for games, videos, etc&quot;.
Here are just few of the things you can look at; 1.
