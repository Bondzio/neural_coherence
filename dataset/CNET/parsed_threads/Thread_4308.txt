<s> Its been a while have posted my blog in the room.Beacuse my engineer has always been there for me,but right now my engineer is no more here with so am facing a huge problems with my PC. </s>
<s> Am using a P3 system with 796mhz,512 of RAM and 80gig of hard disk with onboard processor. </s>
<s> My question is:-Wont that system crash with these Hardware installed?Also,Can i use a Cd writer to play a DVD? </s>
<s> &quot;Wont that system crash with these Hardware installed?&quot; I've yet to find any PC that never crashed. </s>
<s> So the answer is always yes, it will eventually crash. </s>
<s> Hopefully it's so infrequent that it doesn't become a problem. </s>
<s> &quot;Also,Can i use a Cd writer to play a DVD?&quot; No. </s>
<s> But you can try if you don't believe it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The system should run alright without crashing, according to the hardware that u listed.You should be using XP as operating system for best results and overall stability.As far as using your cdrw as a dvd player,it's just not going to happen,unless it's a combo drive with a cdrw and dvd capability.Hope that helps u out. </s>
<s> That combination should be fine, but you might inspect the motherboard for leaking and swollen capacitors. </s>
<s> Many machines of that vintage had a bad capacitor problem. </s>
<s> As another poster mentioned you cannot play DVDs in a straight CDRW, however as cheap as these drives are these days you could upgrade to a CDRW/DVD for very little money. </s>
<s> I must disagree with leotech about XP. </s>
<s> This system will run XP fine, but when you start doing anything it's going to run out of steam pretty quickly, you would probably be a lot happier with Windows 2000. </s>
<s> Just as a point of reference I can legally put XP on this system, but it's an old dual P3 powered IBM IntelliStation with Win2k, and it runs just fine. </s>
<s> Jeff </s>
<s> Sorry for commenting here, but my last dual was a dual Pentium Pro Overdrive. </s>
<s> It still lives. </s>
<s> I gifted it to another engineer which could appreciate it. </s>
<s> After the kitchen remodeling I'll be shopping for a new Core 2 Duo powered system. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yep, it's an old IBM IntelliStation M Pro with dual PIII processors, 768MB, a 36GB SCSI HD and a Matrox G450 video card with dual 21&quot; monitors. </s>
<s> This is my work system, they've offered to replace it with a newer one a couple of times but this is a great old machine. </s>
<s> But then there is the other machine I've been playing with (that I have to put back), it's also an IntelliStation but it's a new Z Pro with dual 3.6 Gig Zeon processors, 2 GB of RAM, a nVidia Quadro FX1300 video card and it's running Vista. </s>
<s> VERY cool machine, wish I could afford to take it home. </s>
<s> Jeff DeWitt </s>
<s> I got your message.I will install the 512mb of ram on it. </s>
