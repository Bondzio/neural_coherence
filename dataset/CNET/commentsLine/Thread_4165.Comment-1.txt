greetings, i have a dell latitude e5510 running windows 7 64bit.
lately the cursor has been jumping while i type.
it doesn't matter if i am in email or word or firefox.
i ran maleware bytes and virus check to see if i picked up any thing, both were clean.
any ideas what is causing this or how to fix it?
paul
