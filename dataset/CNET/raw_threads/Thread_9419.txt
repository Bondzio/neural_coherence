If disconnecting/reconnecting is all that was done before these problems occurred, it's usually a matter of rechecking ones own work. One common problem can be with the power connectors to a drive. The female ends will begin to make poor contact because there is a split in them that allows them to spread a bit. You can usually pinch these back into shape. Other connectors might not be seating properly as well. You can reseat cards connected to the MB as well. That's where I would start.
