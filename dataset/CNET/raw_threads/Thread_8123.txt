15055	0	59483	706271	NR	Ray Harinec	1/22/05 1:27 PM	1.10640042E12	ABIT mobo's & blown capacitors	From Maximum PC Mag, Page 24 [Using the info but not exact quotes in all places] &quot;ABIT has settled a class action lawsuit that alleged that the motherboard maker used faulty capacitors which caused its boards to die preematurely.&quot; ABIT will repair the motherboards at no cost to the consumers and extend the warranty for two years following the repairs. Abit has even agreed to absorb shipping costs for the motherboards. &quot;Models covered include BE6, BE6II, BF6, BX-133, KA7, KA7-100, SE6, VH6, VH6II, VA6T, VP6, KT7-raid, KT7A, KT7A-raid, VL6, VT6X4, SA6R, and BX133-raid. Motherboards purchased between 1999 and now are eligible for service. The article didn't give any address info, but this writewr would assume that the ABIT website must have a place for it. On the sly IBM is quietly replacing some mobos due to capacitor failures. Porbably have to call them to complain loudly to get atrtention.

Only recently it has been reported that the board undergoes spontaneous reboot or multiple reboot tries before getting into Windows. Unfortunately Shuttle has not stepped up to the plate in dealing with this issue. I would like to get them to deal with it.
