I had a very bad experience with an overheating or intermittent router that would cause my 5 computers connected by lan or wan to crash and or reboot depending on how I had the windows error cofiguration set.
To modify this setting: right click on the My Computer Icon, select properties, click on advanced, select startup and recovery, deselect automatic restart.
This will at least let you look at the blue screen and see what kind of error caused your restart.
The error I was getting with the bad router was Driver Fault, HTTP.sys, page fault in nonpaged area.
Lots of luck.
