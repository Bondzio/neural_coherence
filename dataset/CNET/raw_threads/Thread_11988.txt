Re the &quot;Extra 3 (three) Bluetooth Icons in Control Panel&quot; I had a further look at same and went into my installed Microsoft &quot;PowerToys for Windows XP -TweakU&quot; and into the TweakU &quot;Control Panel&quot; settingsand found I had three of the Bluetooth Icons listed as &quot;bthprops.cpl&quot; &quot;bthprops(2).cpl&quot; &quot;bthprops(3).cpl&quot; I have at the moment only have unchecked [I did not delete] the&quot;bthprops(2).cpl&quot; &quot;bthprops(3).cpl&quot; and on looking in the Windows XP Control Panel I find I have one only &quot;bthprops.cpl&quot; Yes, I have &quot;Turned Of&quot; and &quot;Restarted&quot; my computer and the Laser Mouse Bluetooth is at the moment behaving all OK and all appears as it should in the &quot;Bluetooth Settings xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Next, I further been able to correct the multiple Bluetooth Icons contents in the control panel.
