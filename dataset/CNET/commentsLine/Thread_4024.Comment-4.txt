...is ati's name for when two graphics cards that can be linked together for more 3d power.
please be aware that while the hardware reqired by m$ vista is not actually huge, no graphics card on the market at the moment provides &quot;full support&quot;.
vista will use directx10 (and support directx9), and all graphics cards at the moment are only directx9.
