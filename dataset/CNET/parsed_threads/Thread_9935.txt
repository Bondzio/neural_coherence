<s> I am trying to transfer some pics/vids from my sony cybershot camera onto my Dell Studio laptop (vista). </s>
<s> When I plug in the memory card reader it installs as drive F, but when I click it, I get the &quot;Please insert a disk into drive F&quot; message. </s>
<s> Obviously the memory card is in the reader so I have no clue why it isn't being read. </s>
<s> The card works fine in the camera, I can view the pics and vids I am trying to transfer. </s>
<s> I have also tried plugging the reader and card into two desktops, a Dell running Vista and an HP running XP. </s>
<s> Oh and the reader also shows that the memory card has been inserted by lighting up green, so I don't know that it is the reader's problem (I don't really know what the problem is, that's why I'm here). </s>
<s> The reader is a Dynex DX-CR501. </s>
<s> Of all the problems I have had with computers or electronics this is by far the most frustrating! </s>
<s> I seriously want to punt a cat that's how frustrated I am. </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated... </s>
<s> Wow..that sounds great but 6 in a slot? </s>
<s> That seems to me it has to be a very precise device for perfect alignments. </s>
<s> Does it seem to seated well? </s>
<s> Not really, I mean, I do have to use tweasers in order to get the card out of the reader (I think that's what you mean); but it has worked before so I don't think that is the reason it isn't working. </s>
<s> For the Sony cards you need to get and adaptor (card slides into it) Then you put card into the reader, otherwise you can have problems, that is a SONY thing. </s>
<s> The card isn't a sony as far as I know, but I know what yu mean I am going to try to get an adapter for it, thanks. </s>
<s> Same problem here with Sandisk 4GB HDSC card (I have 2 other identical cards that still work so it is definately a problem either with the physical card hardware failing or a virus in the root of the card - which there is no apparent way of clearing as the disk is only accessable for the initial 3-4 secs of being read on insertion to the reader (still managed to salvage a few of my smaller files by quick copy and paste (drag&drop) to the desktop. </s>
<s> However large *.pst files are apparently lost. </s>
<s> I intend to return the card to Sandisk with an explanitory note (their support line simply advised me to invest in a recovery tool - that can't work because the drive only exists for those few seconds - and I think that as there is a possibility that the fault is a physical defect they should at least attempt to fix/recover the data. </s>
<s> Sage advice to back up these things regularly - my last was early Feb and between that and the recovery of those smaller files it is not a complete disaster this time - but still loss of e-mails may matter later on. </s>
<s> Let me know if you have managed to resolve and I'll post the outcome of my efforts later. </s>
<s> PS - on one forum a suggestion to read the card on a linux system as most virus are designed to interfere with windows - that might hold water with your &quot;The card works fine in the camera&quot; statement. </s>
<s> Regards </s>
<s> Turns out my problem was resolvable simply by getting a new card reader. </s>
<s> I agree though backing up is a necessity now considering companies who make memory storage use that as an excuse for their products to fail and not have any responsibility (I had to spend $250 to have Best Buy recover files off of a external HD.) </s>
