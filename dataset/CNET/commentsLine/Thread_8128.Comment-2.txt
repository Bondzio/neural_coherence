it depends on the available slots.
for video cards that's agp (old), pci (common) and pci-e (latest).
check the specs of both your pc and the videocard to see if there's a match.
also, this being an old machine, check if can handle 2 gb ram, a 320 gb hard disk, and if the cpu is fast enough to handle the games you want.
hope this helps.
