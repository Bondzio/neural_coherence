Thanks Bob.
I will probably get a Hauppauge.
But still I still need to know if it can activate the close captioning or not.
As you mentioned the Hauppauge website, I went there but cannot find an answer for this from FAQ.
In terms of the plug, I think it was my mistake.
There is no difference between LA and Toronto, as a friend told me.
