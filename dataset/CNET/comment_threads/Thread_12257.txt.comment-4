not sure about the Q4 and the 680 MBs ....
I just heard/read mention of it...I'm thinking it was the eVGA version.
If it were me...I'd try the MB mfgs site and see if they have a forum on MBs and specifically a forum on the MB you want.
Usually lots of good info re user problems with their boards.
Another MB option worth looking at is the Abit IP35 Pro ....I've read some good tech eval ratings and 245 buyer reviews on Newegg where 83% were 5's and 11% were 4's.
Let us know.
