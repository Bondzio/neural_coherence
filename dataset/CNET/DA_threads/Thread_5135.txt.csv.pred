1.1.1	My question is would it really be worth it to add a GB of ram to my laptop .	St
1.1.2	right now my Acer TravelMate 8104WLMi has 1 GB of ram and i 'm considering upgrading towards two .	St
1.1.3	I 'm no expert or anything on Ram so im not sure that if i just went to a store and bought some that it would be compatible with my machine .	St
1.1.4	under the description on my computer it says it has 1GB DDR2 533 ( support Dual Channel ) .	St
1.1.5	whatever that all means .	St
1.1.6	i went to kingston.com and http : //www.crucial.com/systemscanner/ when i do a scan it offers me a kit thats described like this 2GB kit ( 1GBx2 ) CT540887 DDR2 PC2-5300 CL=5 Unbuffered NON-ECC DDR2-667 1.8V 128Meg x 64 For a little over $ 100 .	St
1.1.7	i was wondering if this would be worth the time and money .	St
1.1.8	any help would be great	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Windows XP	St
1.4.1	The second part of VAPCMD 's question was just as important as the first .	St
1.4.2	If you only use your laptop for web browsing , e-mail , word processing , etc .	St
1.4.3	then you are probably just fine with 1 GB of ram in XP .	St
1.4.4	However , if you do use your laptop for other memory intensive tasks maybe video editing , gaming , etc .	St
1.4.5	then you may want 2 GB of ram .	St
1.4.6	So , it 's really up to you .	St
1.4.7	2 gigs is definitely better than one , but you need to evaluate what you use the computer for and if you really need the extra GB of ram .	St
1.4.8	If you decide to go for it then most major memory retailers have an online evaluator that will tell you what type of memory you need and give you prices on a few selected options .	St
1.4.9	The best part is that they generally guarantee that the RAM will work in your computer .	St
1.4.10	Try crucial.com or kingston.com Also , I did n't notice whether you mentioned it in your post , but you also want to consider what your current 1 GB consists of .	St
1.4.11	For instance , my laptop has 1 gb of memory that is comprised of 2 512MB sticks of memory .	St
1.4.12	Since my laptop only has two slots for memory I would have to buy 2 1GB sticks of memory to upgrade rather than just buying an additional 1GB .	St
1.4.13	The online scanner at crucial or kingston should tell you what you currently have installed and how many slots are available to receive memory .	St
1.4.14	Maybe you already knew some of that .	St
1.4.15	Hope I did n't get too elementary for you .	St
1.4.16	Good luck .	Polite
