Is the difference between the two cards justifies the price of the GTX? Will I notice a significant improvememt while using the GTX in 'normal' conditions? Thanks!

In my opinion, it doesn't justify the price so I say you go get the 7800gt. Saves you alot more money and you can probably get something else with the saved money like speakers, or RAM.

GT, because you can use Rivatuner to unlock the locked pipes on the GT and you'll get the same performance as the GTX. Then you should consider increasing the core and memory clock speed on your card with Rivatuner to get a card even more powerful than the original GTX. That's what I like about video cards these days, so much things to unlock.....
