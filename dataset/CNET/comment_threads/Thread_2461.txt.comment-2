there's a lot of heat in there.
Many systems use negative pressure, meaning just the power supply is sucking hot air out of the PC.
Adding case fans, etc, builds up pressure, blowing hot air out of vents.
Either pay the extra or plan on buying some fans of your own, including maybe a video chip fan if there is a heat sink on it.
