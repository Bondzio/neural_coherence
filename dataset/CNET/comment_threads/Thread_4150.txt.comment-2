Depends on your vendor or maker, see if there is a *back-up* procedure that will make restore or recovery CDs.
Read the manual or visit thier support website for such instructions and USUALLY this is a one time shot.
Otherwise, contact the maker now and stress the need for restore/recovery disks.
This may involve a small cost or none, exclduing S/H fee if recent purchase.
FYI - Don't type in capitals, it expresses *loud talking/shouting* or emphessis in computer lingo.
