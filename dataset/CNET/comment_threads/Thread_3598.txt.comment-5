Cnet editors pick the Velocity micro as their top computer many times, and i belive they are very powerfull, reliable computers.
They dont make you buy any crap that you dont want or need, and the have an upgrade plan, this lets you send in your system and pick the newest upgrades so you can keep up with the times, this plan gives you a discount for being a previous buyer.
If your looking for a really good comp, check out www.Velocitymicro.com.
Oh and i dont know what &quot;micro&quot; has to do with anything cause they are regular sized comps.
