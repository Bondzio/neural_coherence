i recently took apart my pc to clean the inside it was a bit of a mess.
i put it all back together and changed the ide cables as they were causing some problems.
for a while i could not use any form of disc not even cd roms.
since i changed the ide cable cd roms will work but still not dvd discs.
when i say dvd's i dont mean dvd format, just any dvd disc including ones that i have used to back up files.
i get the following message in event viewer.
the driver has detected a controller error on device 0. my hard drive and dvd drive are on separate ide cables but both are using the master connection.
could someone explain where the controller is and what is its function?
im assuming its on the mother board.
i built my machine about 2 years ago and not really had any problems.
except from time to time i am unable to boot untill i switch my psu on and off several times.
this has been happening much more frequently recently.
i did have to change my board before when it failed to work for that reason.
asus a8r mvp 32 delux amd 4000+ cannot remeber my dvd drive or my hard disc models.
i will post more info soon if necessary
