I have an Epson RX500 that's just over a year old.
Meaning, just out of warranty.
I've now got a hardware problem that appears to be related to the print head location/movement.
The error message simply reads &quot;Printer error - See your documentation and call service if necessary&quot; Very helpful, not!
Since its out of warranty, I'm torn between paying to fix it, or just trashing it altogether.
The local Best Buy wants $50 just to look at it, plus parts and labor on top of that.
The repair cost could easily eclipse the cost of a new multifunction unit.
I just hate to have to throw out what was a decent, relatively new printer!
What would you do?
