linksys is probably the best brand, but will also probably cost the most as compared to routers from the other brands with similar feature sets.
also, from my experiences and the experiences of many i've talked to and read about, dlink routers appear to have some unresolved issues with stability -- nothing major, but the little bumps and burps you start to notice in them over time start to get annoying after a while.
however, the flip side is that they also usually sell for less than their linksys counterparts -- so at the end of the day, i guess you get what you pay for.
as for the n-type network, let's first remember that the n specification has not yet been completed by ieee and the n routers are actually n-draft, meaning the final specification is subject to change, and if it changes enough, it could render the draft-spec routers obsolete.
also, its my understanding that unless you transfer large amounts of information over a short range (we're talking gigabytes at a time within line of sight to maybe 50 feet), you really don't notice much of an improvement between an n connection and a g connection.
the bottom line: if you have to ask why go n, you don't need it.
the g network will do fine.
