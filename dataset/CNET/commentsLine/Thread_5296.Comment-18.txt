i'm an upper-level novice, son is a network pro, so i know a little.
the general rule is that &quot;discrete&quot; (separate) graphics cards are always better, but add to your cost initially.
in a laptop, they can reduce your battery life (they use power) per cycle (each recharge).
in a desktop, they can increase your game-/graphics ability significantly.
256 mb is pretty minimal for system ram as well as graphics ram, as windows 7 needs that to run more than minimally, and may or may not allow you to use the attractive aero (vista) gui (the basic graphics of windows 7 upped one step).
i recommend (to a number of friends and co-workers who rely on even my limited expertise as a non-pro/non-gamer user) 512 mb graphics to go with an i5 or higher processor to get more than &quot;adequate&quot; graphics performance.
however, an i3 (or amd equivalent) and 256 mb graphics, even integrated, will give decent color in most cases.
i recommend at least 4 gb ram (windows 7 or vista) to support the processor and graphics card and give decent speed.

i've had very good luck at getting good systems with near-current components for significantly less money.
that should last you adequately for at least the next 2 to 5 years if history continues as it has in computers (moore's law).
hope this helps without drowning you in the sea of technical data.
