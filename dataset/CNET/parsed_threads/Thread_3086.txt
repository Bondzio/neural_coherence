<s> I have my neighbors computer that is failing to boot past The initial American Megatrends screen. </s>
<s> She said that she was having trouble with her dialup and somehow got into the BIOS. </s>
<s> She changed two values from &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;no&quot; and now it won't get past the &quot;American Megatrends TVX0619B&quot; screen. </s>
<s> It's a Biostar MB-8500TVX-A mother board. </s>
<s> I have tried clearing the CMOS by strapping JP4 and also removed the clock chip that also has the battery in it for 10 minutes or so. </s>
<s> Nothing seems to help. </s>
<s> Holding keys down on the keyboard won't force a keyboard error either. </s>
<s> Is there any way to force it into setup this early on in the boot process or is it toast?? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>

<s> Have you tried going back into BIOS and changing the settings to optimized or fail safe? </s>
<s> Just a suggestion as I have no idea what you have already done. </s>
