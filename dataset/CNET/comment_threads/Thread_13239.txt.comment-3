is not unbreakable.
Even if you get an IBM mainframe.
Reason?
Software is modifiable by the user, intended or unintended.
Unless an administrator locks it down and forbids any storage.
That's why dumb terminals don't break, mostly.
You can get a reasonably robust piece of hardware in a system for $500 but if spending 1-1.4K makes you feel better, go ahead.
Or consider restricting your users to tablets and guard your computer like the crown jewels.
