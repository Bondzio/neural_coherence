get your hands on the pgm.
called, &quot;trojan remover&quot; of the same name.
update it and allow it to work, you have demo use of it for 30-days.
also, beware that av pgms.
aren't as adapt to catch all trojans as other malware, but some.
of course the latest threats can sneak by and do thier dirty work.
if you haven't already try an &quot;online scan&quot; of other popular av pgms.
like trendmicro, rav, mcafee, etc.
the results good or bad can be enlightening.
good luck -----willy
