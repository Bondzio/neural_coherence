the reason i have not mentioned companies is because i live in japan and i don't think anyone would be familiar with them.
i'm using an adlink transceiver to connect wireless to my current isp.
this transceiver is hardwired directly to my buffalo router and then my desktop computer is hardwired from my router.
the computer actually thinks it is on a dsl line.
i use the wireless capabilities of my router to connect my notebook pc to my isp.
i use my isp for e-mail and as a gate to the internet, all of it's other services are in japanese which myself and my computer can't use.
the home system that my wife bought is a dedicated internet system only, it doesn't even have a keyboard.
everything is controlled by a remote.
this home system is preset to connect to a specific isp that is run by the company that sold us this home system.
it is primarily for shopping, rental movies, and games.
though it takes awhile to get through all of this companies pages, you can surf the internet like any other isp.
the fiber optics line was installed by the phone company.
the fiber optics line actually comes directly into my house and it has an access switching box at the end.
this switching box has exactly one cable plug.
if i understand this correctly the fiber optics line itself has no isp of its own but is dependant on whatever is attached to it to provide the isp number.
so, this is where i'm lost.
if i hook my router to the fiber optics line i should be able to connect to my isp,right?
if i connect my wife's home system to the fiber optics line then she should be able to connect to her isp, right?
but what happens if i'm connected and she is connected at the same time?
reading on the internet, i've found that this is called multihoming, but it cost many thousands of dollars to do it which i'm not willing to pay.
is there no simple solution?
thanks.
bob
