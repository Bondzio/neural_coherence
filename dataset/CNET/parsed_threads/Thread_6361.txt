<s> I have a desktop with a 1.2 Ghz Athlon processor (Thunderbird I _believe_) with 384 (256+128) RAM. </s>
<s> No idea about the motherboard, do you know how I can find some stats about it? </s>
<s> Anyway, running Windows XP. </s>
<s> Sometimes it gets a bit sluggish when I have a lot programs open. </s>
<s> Will upping the RAM to 512 or 768 be worth the money? </s>
<s> Its SD-RAM, by the way. </s>
<s> especially, as you mention, you open a lot of programs at once. </s>
<s> 512 to 1 meg would improve things in that regard. </s>
<s> You'd still have to weigh the cost of additional RAM against saving it toward a new system or at least MB and processor. </s>
<s> I remember (and often repeat) a saying I once heard in regard to auto racing that seems relevant with computers as well. </s>
<s> &quot;Speed costs money. </s>
<s> How fast do you want to go?&quot; </s>
<s> I have to agree with Steve on this one with regards to the ram issue, but remember, if you're not a frequent upgrader, the sd-ram that's in your system now is not only obsolete, but will be troublesome to find in another year and is incresingly expensive. </s>
<s> As an example, your ram probably runs at 133 mhz. </s>
<s> OCZ technology recently broke the 1000 mhz barrier with ram, so you can see it's getting further and further behind. </s>
<s> Personally I'd wait and upgrade the board chip and ram at the same time. </s>
<s> Seeing as how I am a college student, money for the whole MB/processor/RAM at one time is going to take a while. </s>
<s> In the mean time I think I'll up the RAM to 768 and save for that exotic system of the future. </s>
<s> On a slightly different subject, if I shoot for a future price point, $2000 would pretty much get me the best processor/MB/RAM/Video at any point in time right? </s>
<s> For a long time the trend has been that prices fall and performance increases but prices are falling more slowly now. </s>
<s> Basically, for the same relative cost today you get more. </s>
<s> But, I would not want to predict the future nor would I buy anything today to put away for later. </s>
<s> I'd not try to find an &quot;upgradable&quot; PC unless the I planned to upgrade real soon as technology comes and goes too fast to know how long something will be useful. </s>
<s> Buy what you need today to do what you need to do today and not what you think your needs will be tomorrow. </s>
<s> Just my opinion only. </s>
<s> If u don't see yourself doing a major upgrade soon (proc, mobo, the whole works), then getting at least 0.75GB of RAM would be preferred. </s>
<s> WinXP is quite the resource hog, and will let u play some low to mid end PC games MUCH better. </s>
<s> I was the same way n college. </s>
<s> I upgraded RAM, hd, burner drive, mouse, and OS. </s>
<s> Everything else that was larger and more expensive i waited till i got out of school and would be able to better afford then. </s>
<s> for new system $2000 is enough for prebuilt places like Dell. </s>
<s> That price point should even include a nice LCD monitor. </s>
<s> If ya want a more extravagent LCD monitor, consider spending a 'lil more for a better LCD (20+ in, or maybe even those 24'' widscreen ones). </s>
<s> Spending more on a good monitor may work well for future investments, as ppl will often reuse the same nice monitor for 5+ years, till the end of its lifecycle. </s>
<s> You can shave up to hundreds of $$ off if you can find online deals and coupons for those PCs If you're assembling your own PC, $2000 is enough with extra bells and whistles. </s>
<s> Well seeing as how I'm a tech and small computer business owner my tendancy, especially in U.S. dollars (I'm Canadian) would be to say that you could get yourself a kick @ss gaming system for that kind of dough, with a 8ms response time monitor. </s>
<s> A word of caution, going with anything larger than 19&quot; in an LCD with a decent reponse time (12ms or under, preferably 8ms) is going to cost you dearly. </s>
<s> AS for the system, if you're adventurous and want to put it together yourself, a high end gaming system with AMD processor and dual SLI Nividia video cards could be in your future. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> My intent is to build my own system, once I get that amount cash. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the advice. </s>
