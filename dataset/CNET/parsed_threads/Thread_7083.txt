<s> Suddenly HD would not boot... goes &quot;tick, tick, tick&quot; trying; then I get a message that I must boot with a CD. </s>
<s> I replaced the 14 month old 80 GB Western Digital HD... reloaded XP Pro and my computer is up and running. </s>
<s> But I lost all data on the original HD... </s>
<s> I am wondering if the problem could be only a virus that I might be able to correct somehow? </s>
<s> Or since it sounds like an electro-mechanical problem, do I just have to send the HD off to a data recovery company at some terrific expense? </s>
<s> Yep, I am intent upon being more careful to back up data from now on. </s>
<s> The tick-tick-tick sound is a typical failed drive. </s>
<s> Data recovery is usually under 1000 dollars at the usual Drive Savers or Ontrack and is only considered when backup is non-existant or files must be retrieved. </s>
<s> Back of what you can't lose has never been cheaper. </s>
<s> DVD recorders are now under 100 bucks and you go over 4GB on on disk. </s>
<s> Most of us can put our pictures and files on just a few of these. </s>
<s> In closing, it's not a virus issue, but just one of learning that hard disks are temporary storage. </s>
<s> They can last about 5 years. </s>

<s> zzjones, Maybe not, In New drive create a folder named &quot;Old Drive&quot; Then &gt;Slave your old drive to the new one. </s>
<s> &gt;Go to Windows Explorer &gt;If you can see your old drive &gt;copy My Documents and Program Files to &quot;Old Drive Folder&quot; Do not attempt to find your files until after they are on the new drive. </s>
<s> After you have retrived the files you need Old Drive folder can be deleted. </s>
<s> You may only get one shot at this. </s>
<s> And it may not work but worth a try. </s>
<s> Bill Comments welcomed </s>
<s> Your old hard drive is damaged. </s>
<s> To recover data, you need the services of a hard drive technician, it could be a lens alignment problem, mechanical problem, but surely not virus related. </s>
<s> Doing so (data recovery procedure) will really cost you a lot especially if you have important files in it, it will be wiser to send the hard drive to the manufacturer, they know what to do with their hard drives. </s>
