not sure why, but occasionally it works.
another trick that sometimes works for drives that don't &quot;spin up&quot; is the &quot;snap spin&quot; trick to start the platters turning.
understand, these are last resorts that usually don't work, and that may damage the drive, but which are being used in situations in which you are ready to trash the drive anyway.
i wouldn't worry too much about wrapping the drive, you are only going to put it into the freezer for 1-2 hours.
good luck, it sometimes does work, but don't be surprised if it doesn't.
