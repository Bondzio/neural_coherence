All of the sudden, it's unable to find my wireless network or any other network for that matter. It doesnt not detect any wireless networks when I usually detect mine and 2 or 3 neighbors. I am using a linksys router. Laptop has built in wireless card. I ran the network wizard and wireless wizard on all computers. Rebooted router, pc, latop and cable modem. Refreshed connection. System restore as well. Laptop connects to the internet when using ethernet cable. Any suggestions? Thanks, Nick

Also any idea why I constantly get the message &quot;work offline&quot; or &quot;connect&quot; when browsing the internet? I get this on my hard wired PC and wirless laptop (when it's working of course). It's obviously the router but why am I getting it? Thanks, Nick

If not, tell a little longer story but beware there is no click here cure. If the laptop is dead everywhere, system restore or drivers don't help I try a WIFI PC-Card. Then I get the internal card replaced. If the wifi card fails I reinstall the OS if I'm paid to do that since it's the faster fix and least cost. Bob

If they fix it, then I'm sure I will have the same problem again when surfing the net from my laptop or wired PC. I get the windows popup that says &quot;work offline&quot; and &quot;connect or try again&quot;. When i click connect or try again (cant remember which it is) internet surfing is resumed and everything is fine. Then maybe 10 - 15 minutes go by, get the message again, click connect again and all is well again. I have this problem on the laptop and PC. The PC is working b/c its wired so I have this message happening daily. When I connect my PC directly to the cable modem, I do not get this message.

Do you have the latest wireless network adapter driver from support.dell.com? What wireless utility do you use to connect to wireless access points/hotspots? Your computer should have at least two such utilities. Something like the following: 1. Dell Wireless WLAN Card Utility 2. Windows XP's &quot;Wireless Zero Configuration&quot; utility Open the Dell utility and find the checkbox that says something like &quot;Let this tool manage your wireless networks.&quot; Uncheck that box. Click Apply and then OK. Now open your Network Connections window: Start &gt; Programs &gt; Connect to &gt; Show all connections Rt-click on your wireless connection and select &quot;View Available Wireless Networks.&quot; Any found? Can you connect now?

I opened the utility and &quot;Let this tool manage your wireless networks&quot; was not checked but it said my radio antenna was off and to press Fn F2 to activate and it worked so thanks very much!

Have an HP Touchsmart - desktop - new that connects to same wireless network and works just fine. Both run Vista...Any clues? Have reset the router, reset the network settings...problem remains...Is it the router or the hardware on the laptop? Any help is welcomed.
