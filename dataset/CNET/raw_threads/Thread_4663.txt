Computer specs: Inter i7 920 (not overclocked), Gigabyte 4890 Factory overclocked, Asus P6T, 6Gigs G-power (or smth like that) 1600Megahertz, and an iCute case. My computer handles games quite well offline, but whenever I go online in games like: Battlefield 2, and Battlefield Bad Company 2, my computer crashes within 20 minutes (btw, i use lan cable, not wireless). I think the source of my grief is my Graphics card, as once, directly after it had crashed, i reached my hand inside my case, and felt the air around different areas of the case, and suspected that the graphics card was overheating. This was confirmed when my fingers brushed against it's scalding(-ish) hot metal. My graphics card was already underclocked then, (for an 4890), with 750 clock and 950 memory. Another interesting point is that when i used gpuz, the clock speed showed up as 900 for a second, before plummeting to 240. Can anyone tell me what is happening

Add a fan to put cooler air to the area that's hot. Now I can't tell if it worked OK before but if so, some folk install other than stock GPU speed control apps and the issues begin. So no history? 4. Get some fresh compound and refresh all heat sink contact areas. Bob

You already know that the video card is hot, so attack that issue. Also, the exhaust of heat build-up is important as well to help overall cooling. If none of Robert's tips help, then use direct better cooling of the video card by replacing its fan setup(HSF) or replace entirely and use &quot;water cooling&quot;. The whole point being that cooling is so much a consideration now, you can't leaver it out. Plus, prolonged playing will be a key issue as persistent hi-temps sooner or later find the weakest link and crash a system or worst start to destroy it. If you fix the system now and it works for a longer time, then one of the above needs to be revisited and upgraded yet again to better handle the situation. Understand, continued use of the system where it will crash or not last as long is a clue that it reached its peak of sustainability, thus more $ and/or cooling tips are required. FYI- Just look at any decent pre-build PC offered for gaming, what it entails. These are not basic systems anymore. tada -----Willy

Now moments before the crash, the highest temperature I see is less than 80, however, the GPU Load (btw i'm still using gpuz only) is at a constant 100. What should I do now? Btw, my gpu is a Gigabyte Factory overclocked 4890 (GV-R489OC-1GD), which is now left at it's original speed, so no more underclocking

13392	9	511281	5053926	5053900	Justin213141	12/27/10 8:30 PM	1.2934818E12	Hmmm	Hopefully, it's only the worst case scenario
13392	10	511281	5054094	5053793	Willy	12/28/10 6:57 AM	1.29351942E12	Replace	As I noted, you have to revisit the problem. The video side has become the weakest link. Even, if you clean it well, a &quot;very fine dust&quot; still coats the video card and only a true liquid cleaning with alcohol, etc. will do or use of &quot;electronic cleaner&quot;. Even so, the damage maybe already done and is too late. Heat stress though not apparent is seen when repeated hi-end usage causes a faulty operation of all sorts to include crashes. In most cases, replacing the video card is the fix AND must now include the newer and better cooling fixes, otherwise you will revisit the problem again. Afterall, you did OC the video card and now you see the results of a &quot;shorter service life&quot;. tada -----Willy

Suggest checking the GPU fan speed settings (should be SW that can adjust fan settings) to make sure it's operating at a high enough speed/RPM to remove the heat. Next I'd remove the GPU, then remove the GPU HS Fan, clean/remove the thermal paste, reapply new thermal paste, reassemble and reinstall the GPU. Post temp results. I'd also suggest adding another case fan to intake cool air into the case. VAPCMD

Example at http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=THERMAL-GREASE1-5&cat=FAN Want to upgrade that? 3 bucks then. http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=AS-MTX-25G&cat=FAN Bob
