if range is your issue, there is one thing you must look for - an antenna that you can unscrew and replace with something bigger and better.
these are not as common as one would hope, though.
i know hawking routers use them.
(hawking also makes good high-gain antennas.)
i've got a pretty large collection of wireless routers - belkin, netgear, motorola, hawking - and they are all pretty much the same.
move 2 or 3 rooms away from the router, and you start to have trouble with the signal.
but put a high-gain desktop antenna on the hawking, and those troubles are over.
one thing you might look into, since you have so many computers, is a bridge (i posted this question on cnet a while back).
belkin's g and g-plus routers/access points are cheap, and they have a simple, built-in bridging function (using 2 belkin products), allowing you to wirelessly bridge 2 wired networks together.
for some reason known only to marketers, buying two routers is often cheaper than buying one &quot;gaming adapter&quot; (bridge) that would do the same thing.
