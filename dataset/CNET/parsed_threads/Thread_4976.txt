<s> Hi, Not sure if this is the best place for this request, but I'll try here first... </s>
<s> I'm looking for a &lt;100 NAS device. </s>
<s> I've had a look around for one, but am finding it hard to choose one. </s>
<s> As the ones I like have more features than i would need, and have a fairly large price tag. </s>
<s> I really like this one for example. </s>

<s> I also need to be able to connect to this device from my xbox 360, as i'd like to stream media to it. </s>
<s> Hopefully someone can suggest a product that would be best for both my needs and my budget. </s>
<s> thank you, sam </s>
