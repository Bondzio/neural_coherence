Offhand, use the minimum bid of $1 as any s/h will cost as well. -OR- sell as a lot for $10 or more, but be practical it is old stuff. tada -----Willy

Use the option on the side of the page to view &quot;completed&quot; sales as most stuff like this will not find any buyers. If you live in a Craig's List area, that's probably a good place to try to move some of your old &quot;goodies&quot; since there is no listing fee or seller's fee on Craig's. The eBay listing fees on this &quot;yesterday's&quot; equipment list will bleed you dry. Perhaps a better idea would be to find some place that takes &quot;tax write off&quot; where you MIGHT recover a bit of yesterday's values.

3346	4	249477	2497182	2496857	Tokimemofan	5/26/07 4:35 PM	1.1801973E12	It all works	I tested the hardware already. How else would I know about the low cmos battery on one of the motherboards. I also loaded an OS and played some Audio CDs on the sound cards. Spent over a week testing everything and except for the battery it all works.

No pics, buy it know or other enhancements will keep your listing fees down. Figure accurate shipping to cover yourself. Be realistic, it's only worth what you can sell it for. The second highest bidder will determine your selling price. I'd sell most of it as a &quot;lot&quot;. Somebody will buy it, but cheap!
