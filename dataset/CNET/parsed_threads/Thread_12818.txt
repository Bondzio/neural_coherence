<s> I am currently trying to build a computer for my daughter. </s>
<s> I purchased a ABit NF8-V motherboard and AMD Sempron processor bundle, along with a Western Digital 40 gig HDD, a Nvidia G Force FX5200 video card, 512 Meg Kingston Memory, and a 350 watt power supply. </s>
<s> After assembly, the memory and video card work fine, the board and processor come up, but will not recognize the hdd at all, nor will it recognize the CD ROM. </s>
<s> Any ideas or suggestions? </s>
<s> ANy help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I have a computer similiar to yours, mines is equipped with a Anthlon XP 2400+ 2.0 Ghz. </s>

<s> Exactly what ports on the mobo are they attached to?? </s>
<s> Exactly how are they jumpered?? </s>
<s> Are you using an 80 conductor ribbon cable?? </s>
<s> What settings re the drives are made in the BIOS?? </s>

<s> the hdd is a western digital wd400 the DVD/CD Rom is a BTC 8x, 8x combo drive </s>
<s> what ports they are on. </s>
<s> [Primary IDE, Secondary IDE] Western Digital drives have somewhat unusual jumpering if you are NOT using Cable Select jumpering [and a ribbon cable that supports CS] (all 80 conductor {40 pin}cables support CS). </s>
<s> For normal maste / slave jumpering the WD drives use different jumpering if it is to be a masrter and there is to not be a slave on the ribbon cable. </s>
<s> If it is to be a Master and a slave to be on the ribbon cable [and the slave MUST be there all the time]. </s>
<s> Actually as master with no slave there is no jumper, HOWEVER in order to have a jumper available if needed they put the jumper horizontally just for storage, thuus that is actually no jumper as far as the drive configuration is concerned. </s>
<s> Now if using Cable Select [CS] (CSEL], the Master drive MUST be connected to the end connector and the slave connected to the middle connector. </s>
<s> {not always nice if the hard drive is low in the case and the ATAPI drive higher up in the case. </s>
<s> If you have two IDE ports on the mobo, easiest to attach each to a different cable. </s>
<s> Thanks Ray......You were right on target......the HDD was jumpered as a Master with no slave on board. </s>
<s> Many thanks for you assistance......couldn't have done it without you. </s>
