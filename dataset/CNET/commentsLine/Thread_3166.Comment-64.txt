first off, mtbf (mean time before failure) should be specified somewhere in the documentation for your hard drive, though this is often difficult to locate, as it's often buried somewhere in the technical specifications along wtih a bunch of stuff that you don't really care about.
most external hard drives use exactly the same technology as the internal hard drives.
this takes advantage of economy of scale, allowing the manufacturer to reap the benefits of the existing production line, and turn it into another profic center.
as such, a matter of a few years isn't likely to pose a problem.
many of these are basically a 3.5&quot; desktop hard drive in a case with a usb interface and power supply, though some of them are 2.5&quot; laptop hard drives, which tend to have lower speeds, but also lower power consumtion, and can be powered directly from the usb interface.
the most likely cause of failure for an external hard drive is physical shock, such as being dropped from your desk while you're reaching for the morning cup of coffee... not that this has ever happened to me.
