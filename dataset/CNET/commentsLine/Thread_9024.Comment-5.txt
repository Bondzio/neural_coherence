i've used ics to share a wireless internet connection with the wired ethernet port, so i can attest that it will work when configured properly.
if vista is disabling the wireless connection with ics enabled, then something in the settings is amiss.
most will say it's tricky to setup and unreliable.
i can only suggest attempting ics again if you don't want to purchase additional hardware.
