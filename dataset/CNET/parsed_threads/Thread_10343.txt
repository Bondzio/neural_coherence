<s> If you ever happen to replace your computer's motherboard with a new one that is the same model as the one you replaced, do you still have to worry about re-activating Windows? </s>
<s> Windows will know there's been a change. </s>
<s> Worst case scenario is you won't be able to re-activate without a call to MS. Much might depend on what issue of Windows you have. </s>
<s> Such as OEM types are said to be locked to a motherboard but I think builders who offer warranties know how to get around that if they have to replace the board. </s>
<s> The versions of Windows I have are not ever in doubt about the license so reactivation is silent and always works. </s>
