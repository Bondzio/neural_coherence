For vista will have both 64 bit and 32 bit. Will there be a day when a 32 bit computer will not longer be supported by a OS and software? Thanks

You can't imagine the hoops I see our software jump through all because the CPU didn't do 64 bit integer math. But for 99.9999% of users at this time that does not mean the end of 32-bit. In fact, my PDA is 16 bit. Since OS and such are still available for 8 bitters today, you may have to alter your question a bit to exclude non-Mac or PCs in general. Bob
