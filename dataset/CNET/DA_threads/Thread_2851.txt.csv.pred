1.2.1	Disconnect all CD and HD drives , and just try to see if you get a display .	St

1.2.3	If not , remove cpu .	St
1.2.4	If still no display , disassemble and check that no mounting posts , etc .	St
1.2.5	are touching the mtrbd .	St
1.2.6	and/or somehow any contacts not desired .	St
1.2.7	Also , you can reseat the video card repeatly and then check results .	St
1.2.8	If at any time , you should hear beep ( s ) , etc to worn of a problem , return just removed componet and see if that resolves it .	St
1.2.9	Also , find where the CMOS clearing pins are in order to return bios to deafaults .	St
1.2.10	DO N'T take take anything for granted , it needs to be checked .	St
1.2.11	Also , a weak power supply can cause a video if demanding not to work properly .	St
