<s> I have been experiencing some troubling issues and I was hoping that I could find some help within these forums that have helped me so much in the past. </s>
<s> The issues that I am having are listed below as well as the specs from my machine. </s>
<s> Any more info that may be needed, I can provide through replies: System: Dell Dimension E510 3.0 Gig Intel Pent 4 2.5 GB memory 80 West Dig Hard drive (WDC WD8000JD-75MSA1) *When windows load, I get past the &quot;Dell Black Screen&quot; quickly but I get hung up on the light blue screen that usually shows &quot;welcome&quot; right before showing the normal windows icon desktop screen. </s>
<s> Usually takes 1-3 minutes to get off the &quot;welcome&quot; screen. </s>
<s> *Accessing documents, websites, email, etc. </s>
<s> is fine, but when I try to change the location of where I want to save a file in the drop down menu at the top when you hit &quot;save&quot; or when I hit &quot;save as&quot;, the computer will go to a crawl and either show a hour glass symbol for a minute or so each time a different location is picked or it will show a green scroll bar in the middle of the screen while it is processing which I have never seen before. </s>
<s> This box is titled &quot;INITIALLING FOLDERS: INITIALLIZING THE ROOT FOLDERS TO DISPLAY&quot; This usually takes a minute to three to complete. </s>
<s> *Finally, when closing out of an internet page, I will get a white windows error box. </s>
<s> The one that says &quot;Internet Explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close.. </s>
<s> This happens every time &quot;x-ing&quot; out of a website if it is the only tab open. </s>
<s> Closing out of a site that is connected to others in the website tabs gives no issue until closing out the last site. </s>
<s> I have switched the memory cars around (It has 2 1GB cards and 2 256 cards) to have just the 1 GB cards in and then just the 256 cards in to see if one of the sets was bad, but it did the same thing no matter which ones were in. </s>
<s> Any help would be GREATLY appreciated! </s>
<s> I hate to buy a new hard drive if that is not the issue. </s>
<s> If it is not the hard drive, then I can imagine what the issue is. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance, John </s>
