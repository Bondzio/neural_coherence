1.1.1	OK , here is what happened .	St
1.1.2	I have an external 160gb usb .	St
1.1.3	I was trying to open a folder and it went into ( Not Responding ) mode .	St
1.1.4	I know I should n't but I was frustrated so I just unplugged it .	St
1.1.5	Once I did that I got the bubble for a Write Error , I do n't know the exact wording .	St
1.1.6	Now I had just transferred something to it , but I thought is was done as the transfer notice went away .	St
1.1.7	So now the computer does not see the hard drive anywhere .	St
1.1.8	I have check , Disk Management , I have check BIOS and I have done this at home and on my work computer .	St
1.1.9	Now while I would like to save the hard drive what I really need is some of the data .	St
1.1.10	Does anyone have any ideas for getting the computer to recognize the drive again .	Ques
1.1.11	I have a program to get the data back but first the computer needs to see the drive .	St
1.1.12	Thanks for any help .	St
1.2.1	The best cheap strategy is to pull the hard disk out of it 's casket and put it into a desktop or new USB ENCLOSURE .	St
1.2.2	Good luck , Bob	Polite
1.3.1	I 've read where putting the HD into the freezer and cooling it down temporarily gets it to work sometimes long enough to get data off of it .	St
1.3.2	The freezing cold changes the metal size and allows the stuck platter to spin again , so i assume .	St
1.3.3	Good Luck !	St
1.3.4	It is at least worth a try since nothing else is allowing it to be recognized at this point .	St
1.3.5	Anthony	St
