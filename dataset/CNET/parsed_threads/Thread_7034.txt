<s> I just purchased an Acer Aspire M3300-U1332 computer. </s>
<s> The specs include AMD Phenom II X4 810 2.60GHz processor 6GB DDR3 1066 memory 1 TB SATA hard drive integrated ATI Radeon HD 3200 graphics card VGA and HDMI monitor ports two 5.25 inch bays three 3.5 inch bays Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit OS one DVDRW optical drive 300 watt PSU I bought this on the spur of the moment because I thought I was getting a good deal at $500 with no tax and free shipping. </s>
<s> However, no disks came with it. </s>
<s> So my question is &quot;Do you think this really is a good deal or should I exchange it before the 30-day period expires for something with a better reputation for quality, reliability and customer service.&quot; Thank you. </s>
<s> That GPU is quite at the low end. </s>
<s> The price is OK but I'd skip this one for any i3 powered machine and a better GPU. </s>

<s> What GPU do you recommend? </s>
<s> I don't do gaming, just e-mails, net surfing, photo editing and slide shows. </s>
<s> Is Acer a reliable brand? </s>
<s> I've yet to see anything I'd call reliable. </s>
<s> Just one mistake and the OS fails. </s>
<s> Just one malware and it's failing. </s>
<s> This is not reliable. </s>
<s> Sorry but reliable is something I write about toasters and refrigerators, not computers. </s>

<s> I like that list. </s>
<s> It's also what I use when I shop for a new card. </s>
