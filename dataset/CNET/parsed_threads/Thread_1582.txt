<s> I have a linksys b router on my main pc and a wireless pci card for my old pc which was win98, mine is xp, now I have another xp and tried to use same for this one but nothing, i got a wireless g pci card. </s>
<s> I wonder if I can use with b router, I called linksys about the b to b connection but no help, they tried saying something missing from software, I think. </s>
<s> I t just won't make the connection, I am connected with the wired from room to room but that looks sloppy, with a cord going across the house, is there something I can do to get connected wireless, thanks in advance </s>
<s> One question before we delve deeper - did you install the software for the wireless card BEFORE you put in the wireless card inside the computer? </s>
<s> No I installed the card first. </s>
<s> Ahhh, there could be the answer. </s>
<s> With every wireless card I have installed, it has always been necessary to install the software first, then the hardware. </s>
<s> So, lets try this: 1.) </s>
<s> Shut down computer and remove wireless card. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> Start up computer without card. </s>
<s> 3.) </s>
<s> Install wireless card software. </s>
<s> When prompted--- 4.) </s>
<s> Shut down computer. </s>
<s> 5.) </s>
<s> Install wireless card. </s>
<s> 6.) </s>
<s> Restart computer. </s>
<s> Please let us know how that works. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
<s> I tried to install software first, then card but still nothing, something about hardware problem in install and about something not in range. </s>
<s> I on't know what the problem is, I had a connection in an apartment with walls in the way, and this place isn't any different, i wonder if I buy another modem,would that help or maybe the card got messed up during my move? </s>
<s> I tried another card a g instead of the b, same linksys. </s>
<s> Is there something else i can do </s>
<s> You will need to be much more explicit about the actual errors and messages displayed. </s>
<s> It is almost impossible to troubleshoot without the actual messages. </s>
<s> I'm sorry, but without more concise details, there is no way for me to go further at this time. </s>
