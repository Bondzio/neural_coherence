Double-click on the volume icon next to your clock.
This will bring up a whole bunch of volume settings.
Make sure the &quot;Wave&quot; sound source Mute box is UNCHECKED and its volume is up.
(If there is no Volume icon next to your clock, go to the &quot;Sounds and Audio Devices&quot; control panel, click on the &quot;Volume&quot; tab, and and click &quot;Advanced&quot;.)
To make it simple, you might want to UNCHECK all Mute boxes and turn up all volumes, to cover all sources.
Also, if you installed a retail version of a DVD drive, there should be a port for a 3 or 4 pin audio cable in the back of the drive.
The other end of the sound cable plugs into the motherboard (if you have motherboard integrated sound) or into your sound card (if you have a PCI sound card).
