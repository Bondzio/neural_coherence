I built a PC with the following configuration: MOBO- ASUS M2N-32SLI which includes Nvidia RAID controller Windows 7 Professional (64-bit) AMD Dual Core Athlon processor 4 GB RAM Current RAID confguration is 2 disks mirrored for drive C (all program installs) Mirror 2 has all docs, data, etc My question is this: how difficult would it be to reconfigure the RAID to 5?
Would the best solution be to break each mirror, and add an additional drive for drives C and D and convert them to a separate RAID 5 virtual drive for each?
Also, would I have to lose all of the data and/or programs, or does the RAID controller automatically reconfigure the data and convert it to RAID 5?
The reason that I'm using RAID instead of backup is that I have huge video and music files (I create videos and arrange music) and don't want to add a 2 TB drive to back up everything.
However, I can't risk losing my information and files.
I hope that this is a bit clearer than mud.
If anyone needs clarification or additional info, I will be happy to append it to this original post.
Thanks in advance for your help.
