thanks bob.
i have setup the belkin router, as well as updated the firmware - it's been running like this for a year....every day i have to unplug it at least once to get my wireless signal back.
so, i won't use it anymore for the wireless networking; i'll replace it with the rosewill.
but i need to hardwire 4 of the 5 computers, and i want to put 3 printers on the network in such a way that i don't have to connect them directly to a computer, and have that computer &quot;on&quot; so that i can print from any other computer.
i just thought that i might be able to do something with the belkin router to accomplish this, instead of buying a print server?
every print server i've seen handles 1 printer - so i need one for each printer?
then i need an ethernet switch because all my ports on the wireless router are already used up by computers?
do you see how lost i am?
lol
