<s> Hi all I am very new to upgrading an old pc. </s>
<s> I have a hp pavillion about 7 years old. </s>
<s> I have bought an AMD phenom 965 cpu I will use a corsair CX600 watt, 80 plus, 120mm fan psu I'd like to know a decent Asus or highly rated company's motherboard to accompany this cpu. </s>
<s> I bought an asusM5A 78L-M LX(US $60) the guy in compusa told me would work only to find out that it will only handle up to 95 watts. </s>
<s> The new cpu will use 125. </s>
<s> I primarily use the internet and play games no more exotic than civ4, age of empires, starcraft etc. </s>
<s> and would like to be able to stream sports and maybe movies. </s>
<s> Nothing too demanding but i would like this build to last at least 5 years. </s>
<s> So if a motherboard needs some features for future expansion or better functioning, I can go up a bit in my budget but not too much. </s>
<s> Things is tough right now... </s>
<s> In the next few months i plan to add a 1 gb graphics card. </s>
<s> I am also a bit lost on the type of ddr3 ram chips to get for it. </s>
<s> Would the type be specific for the cpu, the mobo or both? </s>
<s> Thanks to all for your help </s>
<s> That cpu needs a socket type......am3. </s>
<s> Look here. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100007625%20600007943&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;name=AM3 Pick one that is the proper size and has the features you want. </s>
<s> Research the item and read the reviews. </s>
<s> yeah, i have been on their site but i guess wattage consumption is not a listed spec. </s>
<s> i am more than a bit surprised that the guy from the computer area at compusa didnt catch this. </s>
<s> anyway i will return the one today and see if another guy can help out. </s>
<s> thanx bob b </s>
<s> asus and amd; neither one would offer any suggestions as to the mobo to get. </s>
<s> i went back to compusa and got a gigabyte 880 GM-D2H which is rated to 125 watts for the amd 980 series pcu. </s>
<s> hope it works well. </s>
