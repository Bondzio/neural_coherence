15367	0	101652	1166710	NR	ust1268	5/2/05 6:45 PM	1.1150595E12	SATA/PATA	I have a crashed SATA drive from another system that I want to retrieve info from. I'm running W2K, MSI mobo KM400-825 Ver 1, BIOS Phoenix 6.00PG, 512 MB RAM, Athlon XP 2500, ST 40GB. I bought an Adeptec Serial ATA card. It's installed with the SATA drive connected but does not see the drive when I get the prompt to hit F3 for configuration. I've already tried 2 of the 3 PCI slots. What can I do to make the SATA drive available to retrieve the info? Is it possible?

Boot the Knoppix and see if you can see the files on the drive. If you have two CD drives, one a burner you may be able to save them to a CD. If the other computer has another drive already in it, then plug the old drive in another SATA port. Or try the same thing with the Knoppix CD if the drive comes up to speed using the PCI card [running, not necessarily directly useable].

I had never heard of Knoppix (completely Linux ignorant). after a little research I downloaded it and I went back and tried it on the original box and HD, but to no avail. But, now I have one more tool in my bag! Thanks again.
