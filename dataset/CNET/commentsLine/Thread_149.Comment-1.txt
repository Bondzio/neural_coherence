roddy32 (or anyone else that knows about this desktop and hp parts).
i noticed in your profile that you and i have the same computer configuration with 512 ram.
i thought i might expand mine to 1 gig with another 512 module.
hp wants about 500 dollars for the 512 memory module.
crucial says they have the correct one for 55 dollars.
that's a big difference!
i asked hp if they could explain the difference.
they just gave me pr and marketing hype about quality branded materials.
i wanted to know if there was a technical or fatal difference.
here's the links to what i was comparing: crucial:  hp:  i thought i had read it wrong or that hp had a decimal in the wrong place.
any helpful information will be appreciated.
thanks
