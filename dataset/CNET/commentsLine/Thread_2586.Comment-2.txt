press the reset button in the back of the wireless router for 30 seconds, then power it on.
setup should be wall &gt; isp modem/router &gt; wireless router &gt; wired/wireless update the firmware in the wireless router.
broadcast ssid(change this to make connecting easier) use wpa security.
use channels 1, 6 or 11. most devices work better on these channels mixed b and g mode(n is it applies) save changes and exit.
power down everything.
turn on the isp modem/router wait 30 seconds turn on the wireless router.
wait 30 seconds.
now turn on your computer.
try to connect to the new ssid.
you could also try the range expander and it should also work.
i think it's the combination or the wpa security and the channels.
let me know what you got.
