1.1.1	I 've got a HD TV ( HD Ready ( 720p / 1080i ) ) and i have it hooked up to normal TV , and then i have a AGP cable coming from my PC ( ATI Radeon HD 3650 ) to the AGP port on the TV .	St
1.1.2	thing is when I 'm watching video on it , i get black lines moving up the screen .	St
1.1.3	and i do n't like it .	St
1.1.4	currently i had a dvi to agp converter for the cable , but i was wondering , if i got a dvi to HDMI converter instead , and plugged into the HDMI port of the tv , would i get a better picture quality ?	Ques
1.2.1	Your agp card does n't have agp output port .	St
1.2.2	What does the manual say about output ports that you have .	St
1.2.3	If you have a dvi output connection , then all you need a is a cable that has dvi connector in one end and hdmi connector on the other end .	St
1.3.1	Did you mean VGA ?	Ques
1.3.2	PC to TV ?	Ques
1.3.3	AGP ?	Ques
1.3.4	If you are just trying to use your big screen as a monitor , VGA should be fine , DVI to DVI should be a bit better , which means not a converter but a cable .	St
1.3.5	HDMI encompasses both Video and Audio so in order to take advantage of those functions you would need an HDMI card in the pc and of course and HDMI cable .	St
1.3.6	There can be a lot of variables , depending on what you are trying to do and system capability ( computer ) can have a lot to do with the outcome .	St
