1.1.1	Well , mine went out on my dimension 4600 , now I dont know what to get .	St
1.1.2	There 's a lot of adapters and whatever else online , but I dont want to fry my motherboard or anything .	St
1.1.3	I cant seem to get anywhere on Dell 's website , so I dont know what to do ...	St
1.2.1	You would have to order one from pc power and cooling the best psu manufactuer out there ( one good thing about dell , they do n't use crappy parts ) , however the psus are specially made for dell , so the wiring is differnet though they share the same pin-layout .	St
1.2.2	SO sticking any psu will fry your computer .	St
1.2.3	Google pc power and cooling and check for the psu that matches your model .	St
1.2.4	The Psus are expensive .	St
1.2.5	Dells always offer limited upgradeability and bad technical support .	St
1.2.6	Roger	St
1.3.1	Well , the dell man says I also need a new motherboard and memory cards , so it looks like I 'm screwed ...	St
1.4.1	memory cards ?	Ques
1.4.2	dat makes no sense ... i think u mean memory modules for ram	St
1.5.1	Dell has a non-standard wired ATX power connector .	St
1.5.2	So you need a PSU that is made for a Dell or a ATX PSU and one of the adapters .	St
1.5.3	Find them online with google .	St
1.5.4	John	St
1.6.1	If your looking for a psu , try this site .	St
1.6.2	www.tigerdirect.com Good Luck	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	Bummer ! ! !	St
1.8.2	That 's why I build my own .	St
1.8.3	Got a Dell about 5 years ago , tried to put in different motherboard , no good .	St
1.8.4	Found a site that showed how to get around the power supply and connect the motherboard , too complicated , so built one instead .	St
1.8.5	Still have the Dell running Linux .	St
1.8.6	Angel	St
1.9.1	This guy documented everything you 'll ever want to know about Dell 's evil proprietary pinout power supplies : http : //www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.asp ? p=339053 & quot ; An even bigger crime than simply using non-standard power connectors is that only the pinout is non-standard , the connectors look like and are keyed the same as is dictated by true ATX. & quot ; & quot ; I discovered this the hard way as well ; by frying parts .	St
1.9.2	At first I thought the upgraded power supply I installed in one of my Dell systems was bad , especially considering the dramatic way it smoked when I turned the system on , I actually saw **fire through the vents** !	St
1.9.3	Good thing I decided to check the color codes on the connectors and verify the pinout on another Dell system by using a voltmeter before I installed and fried a second supply. & quot ; I recommend replacing the power supply AND motherboard with industry-standard components .	St
1.9.4	Everything else should carry over .	St
1.9.5	Heck , get a nice AMD Athlon 64 CPU to replace your power-guzzling P4 while you 're at it .	St
1.9.6	I like ASUS for motherboards and Seasonic for power supplies .	St
1.9.7	Be sure to tell Dell what you did .	St
1.10.1	I find this thread interesting considering that I have four Dell Optiplex computers bought at the same time that all had power supply failures within a couple of months .	St
1.10.2	At first they would fail to start reliably , and eventually not at all .	St
1.10.3	At first the Dell tech said I motherboard , but after replacing the MB and memory with no sucess , he traded out a PS and voila ... it worked !	St
1.10.4	With another computer beginning to act up the rep ordered two PS 's and those were fixed .	St
1.10.5	When the other two started acting up , I called Dell but was told they could n't replace parts with intermitent problems .	St
1.10.6	No problem ...	St
1.10.7	I called back and said & quot ; they 're dead & quot ; and the PS 's were shipped .	St
1.10.8	BTW , pretty easy to replace ... . about a 5 minute job once you know the one screw to remove and how to get the processor air funnel out of the way .	St
1.11.1	Okay , Simple solution - go to http : //www.pcpowerandcooling.com/products/power_supplies/selector/ Put your information in and VOILA !	St
1.11.2	You have a new power supply that is better than the original .	St
1.11.3	Probably cost you $ 150 ( plus shipping ) for the older models .	St
1.11.4	But you factor in a mobo and a PSU to replace them , you are gon na fork over more dough anyway .	St
1.12.1	Believe it or not , just last week my power supply took a nose dive .	St
1.12.2	I have a Systemax Pent 4 , 2.4gig .	St
1.12.3	Well I went to all sorts of sites & could n't find a replacement .	St
1.12.4	It seems like it is either out of manufacturing or the manufactures make them so you ca n't get replacements .	St
1.12.5	Well , anyway , I could n't locate a 300watt one that would fit my system , so I went to a computer repair store close to me .	St
1.12.6	I purchased a 350watt , instead of a 300watt .	St
1.12.7	Installed it & it works great , so far .	St
1.12.8	It cost me a bundle , but hey , its the only joy I get here .	St
1.12.9	1st time I 've ever replaced a power supply & I 'm proud of myself .	St
1.12.10	When you find a store , take your old supply with you & make sure the new one is same size , hole alignment matches , etc .	St
1.12.11	Also make sure all the cables match your cables on the old supply .	Sug
1.12.12	I even got a supply that has more power cables then my old one .	St
1.12.13	It leaves me room for expansion .	St
1.13.1	When I bought my Dell desktop 2 1/2 years ago , my husband insisted I get the extended warranty , which I did .	St
1.13.2	I had the same symptoms of an imminent power supply failure - harder to start , erratic start , and no start .	St
1.13.3	When the problem of starting began , I called Dell and they sent out a technician in less than 24 hours and of course , it worked perfectly , BUT the technician said he thought it was a power supply failure evolving and he was right .	St
1.13.4	When I called Dell and told them of the previous visit , there was no taking my word for it , and my husband and I went through the lengthy talk-through on removing the case , etc .	St
1.13.5	and finally , the person on the other end said , & quot ; yes , it 's a power supply failure & quot ; and within 24 hours , it was fixed , in house .	St
1.13.6	Not being savvy with the inner workings , did it cost me more to have the power supply replaced this way , or for an ignoramus , was this the best bet ?	Ques
1.13.7	In any event , I have to say that in my experience , Dell did a good job in handling the situation , or maybe I just got lucky with the technician in this area .	St
1.13.8	I have a Gateway notebook ( bought based on my previous positive experience with them ) and I usually go through 3 or 4 phone calls until I get someone who actually sounds like they know what they 're talking about and then take their advice - however , in order to have something less than minor taken care of , it 's the same answer : send it to us and we 'll solve the problem after we 've reformatted the hard drive .	St
1.13.9	Needless to say , I 'm not going to be a Gateway customer again !	St
1.14.1	http : //www.pcpowercooling.com/products/power_supplies/dell/ These guys seem to have a knowledge of the problem ; have n't tried them but worth investigating .	St
1.15.1	I also had no idea my dim 8200 had a non-standard psu , so when I tried to replace my mobo I hit a brickwall .	St
1.15.2	Luckily the plugs did n't fit so I did n't fry a new mobo .	St
1.15.3	I was still mad , though .	St
1.15.4	Not only had I wasted the time I put aside for the change over , but now I had to order a new psu and wait for it to arrive .	St
1.15.5	Dell shoud be putting a big red sign on their cases and website : WARNING : Non-standard parts used here .	St
1.15.6	I will never buy from dell again .	St
1.16.1	Something went bad on our dell earlier this year .	St
1.16.2	Phone support could not diagnose it , so I ended up doing exactly that : getting new chip , motherboard and psu .	St
1.16.3	Fortunately , the warranty had not run out .	St
1.16.4	Point is , Dell could not figure out what was wrong and was willing to replace the whole shebang .	St
1.16.5	If the machine had not been under warranty though , I 'd have been out a lot of money .	St
1.17.1	I would n't go to these people if their crap was all free .	St
1.17.2	After two months of getting the red tape runaround and time consuming try this and try that I agreed to a different brand computer and recieved a different one than they promised , I kept it because it was the first one of three that actually worked .	St
1.17.3	Unless you want to be treated like a moron and given the run around steer clear of Tiger Direct .	St
1.18.1	Search ebay for a replacement PSU .	St
1.18.2	It may be used , but you 'll get it a lot cheaper than retail .	St
1.18.3	Dell support is terrible .	Polite
1.18.4	I do n't bother calling them anymore with problems .	St
1.18.5	I just search their community forums and google for info .	St
1.19.1	The Dell Dimension 4600 will accept a standard ATX power supply .	St
1.19.2	My recommendation : Antec SL350 ( the SP350 also works ) .	St
1.19.3	Nice quiet supplies - running one in my 4600 right now !	St
1.19.4	I also recommend the Dell forums over their tech support .	St
1.19.5	http : //forums.us.dell.com/supportforums/board/message ? board.id=dim_other & message.id=210341 & view=by_date_ascending & page=1	St
1.20.1	It 's nice to know that Dell has switched back to standard power supplies for at least some of their models .	St
1.20.2	Does Dell document which machines have normal power supplies and which ones have their old proprietary ones ?	Ques
1.20.3	If so , where ?	Ques
1.21.1	amd cpus are WELL known to be power hogs !	St
1.21.2	not intel !	St
1.22.1	I replaced the power supply in my Demension 8200 over a year ago , standard PSU , 425W and there are no problems , except for the minor case modification I had to make to get the screw holes to line up .	St
1.22.2	The PSU is a Diablotec , but works great .	St
1.23.1	Dell OptiPlex and Latitude support is US-based , and is several steps above the off-shored support .	St
1.23.2	I keep waiting for the off-shore support to improve , but it 's pretty time consuming to work with .	St
1.23.3	Your best bet on newer units is to run the hardware diagnostics on the utility partition of the hard drive ( if the machine starts ! )	St
1.23.4	before calling , and give the techs the results at the begnning of the call .	St
1.24.1	Several years ago AMD CPUs were power hogs , as in back in the 180nm process days .	St
1.24.2	Their current 90nm chips use MUCH less power than Intel P4 's .	St
1.24.3	http : //www.techreport.com/reviews/2005q3/athlon64-x2-3800/index.x ? pg=13	Ques
1.25.1	this may sound funny , have you heard of aarons rental ?	Ques
1.25.2	i got a 4600 from them and down the road my ps went out and the fixed it .	St
1.25.3	call them and the might be able hook you up .	St
1.25.4	they sell a lot of dells	St
1.26.1	I run a computer business and work on Dell computers ALL the time .	St
1.26.2	With that being said , I can say it 's not a huge issue to replace their power supply .	St
1.26.3	All you need to do is call the Dell spare parts dept .	St
1.26.4	and tell them the model .	Sug
1.26.5	It 's $ 29.95 plus $ 10.00 shipping for a replacement and they ship them with 2nd day service for that price .	St
1.26.6	It 's really a no-brainer !	St
1.26.7	The only issue you may run into is if Dell spare parts give you the run around that they are out of stock .	St
1.26.8	This has happened and it has taken 2 weeks to get a replacement processor cooling fan .	St
1.26.9	Overall they do n't usually take to long .	St
1.26.10	Mike D .	St
1.27.1	As long as you have a valid warranty Dell should replace your power supply .	St
1.27.2	I work at a technical college with Dell computers and we have power supply problems all the time .	St
1.27.3	I do n't even call the Dell technical support line I just email them and they either send out a replacment part or send a technician to replace the part .	St
1.28.1	Yep , I 'm 7 for 24 on two year old machines , but I suspect the power that courses though my classroom 's wiring is at fault - not the power supplies themselves .	St
1.28.2	Well maybe ?	Ques
1.28.3	Given that many buildings are underwired for today 's technology I wonder if this may be the case for some of you as well .	St
1.28.4	We also replaced 11 power supplies on our last batch of Gateway 's ... . 11 I beleive of 20 or so over the course of 3 years .	St
1.28.5	Electrician has been called - Dell replaced all seven power supplies - though it took several calls and yes , some poorer service .	St
1.29.1	Unfortunately most buyers are unaware of Dell 's use of 'proprietary ' parts .	St
1.29.2	I did n't know the PSU appears 'designed ' to destroy your computer !	St
1.29.3	i.e .	St
1.29.4	Same connectors , different wires .	St
1.29.5	Jeeze , my sister and her daughter recently bought Dell 's .	St
1.29.6	Same with memory modules , though not as bad , or dangerous .	St
1.29.7	Deceptive advertising in my opinion .	St
1.29.8	'Let the buyer beware ' certainly applies to Dell .	St
1.30.1	Just happened , I have 25 days left on my warranty .	St
1.30.2	My power supply went , called Dell last Thursday , the tech asked me to do some diagnosing routines .	St
1.30.3	In my case , the machine would n't boot so answering most of his questions was easy .	St
1.30.4	At the end of the call , he decided to send a new motherboard as well as the power supply .	St
1.30.5	A local tech showed up Monday afternoon , took about 30 minutes to install and test the new parts .	St
1.30.6	I have n't decided whether to extend the warranty but I think , depending on the price , it might be a no brainer .	St
1.30.7	Good Luck everyone Bob	St
1.31.1	Using any compatible PS will NOT fry your Dell .	St
1.31.2	My brother is currently using a PS from an HP computer in his 4600 as we speak .	St
1.31.3	I know because I put it in there .	St
1.31.4	On another occasion , I saw an ANTEC PS in another Dell unit .	St
1.31.5	No idea how these myths come about ...	St
1.32.1	http : //www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.asp ? p=339053 That 's how .	Ques
1.32.2	I nearly swapped in a standard power supply into one of those Dells but hesitated when something just did n't look right about the ATX power cable .	St
1.32.3	Dell used those idiotic nonstandard cables for several years .	St
1.32.4	I know of no definitive list of which Dells have what .	St
1.33.1	I have a dell 8200 , manufacture date jan , 2002 , How can I tell FOR SURE it will take a standard atx psu upgrade ?	Ques
1.33.2	Also I just upgraded video card to a Gforce 6600gt with extra power connecter.Current psu is stock 250 watt .	St
1.33.3	Card manufacturer recommends 300 to 350 watts .	St
1.33.4	Do I really need to upgrade ?	Ques
1.33.5	thanks saltcod	Polite
1.34.1	any warranty ?	Ques
1.35.1	I am trying to install a SATA DVD RW drive .	St
1.35.2	I can not find a SATA power cable coming from my supply , only molex .	St
1.35.3	I was told the drive was compatable with my Dell .	St
1.35.4	Does my supply have a SATA power cable for me to use , or do I have to do some jury rigging .	St
1.36.1	To avoid unanswered new posts , this thread is now closed .	St
