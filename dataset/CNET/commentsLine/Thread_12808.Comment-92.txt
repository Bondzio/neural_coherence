i bought my current computer at the end of 2006, got the upgrade to vista, used that until i started with win7 rc.
i did need the motherboard replaced, totally free-my audio connector had died.
there have been no problems since and soon will have it's 4th os installed so that will take care of the reformat for me.
i see no reason yet to get a new one.
pc stats has me in top 32% with this nearly 3 yr old job and it keeps on ticking.
