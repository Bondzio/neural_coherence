1.3.26	I'm on my second X5470, and it's giving me the same problem as the first (sounds like it's trying to turn on for no apparent reason).	St
1.3.27	Needless to say I'm not a happy camper.	St
1.3.28	Must admit Lexmark sent me a replacement quickly, but what good is that when I have the same problems with the new unit?	St
1.3.29	Good luck!	St
1.4.1	Can't return warranty over.	St
1.4.2	thanks	Polite
