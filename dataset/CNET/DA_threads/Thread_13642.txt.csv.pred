1.1.1	I've noticed that whenever I make or receive phone calls on my iPhone 3G I lose my wireless internet signal.	St
1.1.2	Anybody else have experience with this or have suggestions on what can be done so my wireless connection is not disrupted?	St
1.1.3	Sometimes it comes back automatically, but other times I must manually reset the modem.	St
1.1.4	The modem is a Netgear WRN85RT (I think), either way, last time I checked there were no firmware updates available for it.	St
1.1.5	The wired connection is not interrupted, only the wireless.	St
1.1.6	Hope someone can help.	St
1.2.1	I've seen that a lot.	St
1.2.2	I visit the maker's site to see if new firmware is out and if not try a new router.	St
1.2.3	I'm guessing you already have the router set per the Cnet Networking Forum suggestions.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
