hi, I use a lexmark x5470 it does the job fine, however although lables are made for CD/DVD's disc they should not be used as it requires skill in putting them on you should not touch the surface of the disk or even bend it, unless you use a label maker i would stay well clear.
you could end end damageing the drive.
more money.
regarding the ink i think most of us have the same problem inks that are far to exspensive, these manufacturers have cornered the market and kept the prices very high as they know we need them.
Un like lexmark x5470 the epsom printers have compatibles available i owned a epsom cx3200 all in one the original cartridges where cost 23.00 on average each that 50.00 plus for 2 cartridges.
A friend in the computer world gave me some cartridges made buy Pro-jet and tiatanuim they cost around 5.00 per pack of two 1 color 1 black even i could not spot the difference so it would pay to hunt around the internet for a postal supplier.
