i am running windows xp with service pack 2 , and i am installing ATI Catalyst 5.3(the latest version) , My Card is &quot;ATI Radeon 9000&quot; , recently , In the middle of the games , the system reboots , i tried more than ane game but all are the same , after 15 to 30 mins of the game the machine reboots , and my processor's fan is working fine , this issue doesn't happen at all at applications except games , that's why i believe it's a driver issue ,the games i tried are C&C Generals , NHL 2005 and FIFA 2005 .
Any suggestions?
thanx in Advance
