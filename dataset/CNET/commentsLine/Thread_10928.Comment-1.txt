i cannot believe i am having this much trouble finding a laser printer that prints on 80 lbs (216 gsm) coverstock that is 3 1/2&quot; x 4 7/8&quot; - typical 4bar or a1 flat card size.
why is this not something that laser printers can do?
again, i want to be able to print on an a1 flat card size piece of coverstock (80 lbs or 216 gsm).
anyone have any ideas??
thanks for your help!
