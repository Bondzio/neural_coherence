I'm guessing you mean the SILVER CDs or DVDs that you buy with music or video content. If so, then you may want to know that such are not &quot;burned&quot; but are &quot;pressed&quot;. Does that help? As to the Mad Dog. It's a value unit that should last a year or two but isn't very expensive. Bob
