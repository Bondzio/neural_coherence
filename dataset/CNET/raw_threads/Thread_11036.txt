I purchased a SATA hard disk. On my system, while formatting, the only option is to format it as a simple NTFS disk. After fomatting computer management&gt; storage&gt; Disk management shows the disk as a simple volume and partition magic fails to recognize it. However, i am able to access the hard disk normally. On other systems, Partition magic fails to recognize it and computer management&gt; storage&gt; Disk management shows the drive as a dynamic disk. Here the disk is not shown in &quot;my computer&quot; and i'm not able to access it. Other attempts to format the disk results in formatting as a simple NTFS volume again. Any solutions? Thank You.

But the same works on my system, whereas doesn't work on any other system i tried on. I tried partitioning the drive with partition magic, but with no luck. Which other details am i supposed to list. I'm sorry. I'm not very well versed in this. Thank you for your reply.

Maybe you are asking about why Partition Magic doesn't work but I'm unsure. I don't need or use Partition Magic since I can use what Windows or Linux offers. This also saves me money since PM needs updates at times. Bob

I use the hard disk in 2 systems and it wasn't detecting in one of them. The problem just got solved. I partitioned the whole drive again while installing fedora and they are shown as primary partitions and logical partitions on windows, which wasn't the case earlier. Thank you for your time Bob. I really appreatiate it.
