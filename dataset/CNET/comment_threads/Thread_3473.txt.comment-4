I paid all of 25 bucks for a netgear wrn2000 and no CD.
It took all of 2 tries to get to the routers web page to set it up but no CD was needed.
I hear you want to know how to do this but if there is some other issue such as a bad cable or forgotten info then it gets harder.
I then press the reset button on the router and read the product manual again.
If that fails I may replace the router.
