<s> What will be the best wireless router today for wired speed? </s>
<s> The wireless part is not that important, just to be there. </s>
<s> Any ones experience will be helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> HOWEVER the old method of setup still wins. </s>
<s> Here it is! </s>
<s> Cable/DSL/Fiber Modem -&gt; Router -&gt; Gigabit switch. </s>
<s> No, I will not be supplying any make or models here as there is no full percent gain from one to the next with this setup. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I agree on the setup. </s>
<s> Are all the units the same? </s>
<s> My set up is now a motorola modem from a cable company and a Cisco 800 gateway. </s>
<s> Now I would like to find a router under $200 that will give the best and reliable results on today new technology, under that price. </s>
<s> I realize there are better quality unit at a higher price. </s>
<s> I need to replace my old linksys router. </s>
<s> Do you or any one else can share their results with their router? </s>
<s> Are all the units the same? </s>
<s> - Of course not. </s>
<s> But for your first question in your original post the differences are less than 1% so I'll stop writing here. </s>
<s> Do you or any one else can share their results with their router? </s>
<s> - Unlikely. </s>
<s> If you would publish some web site with &quot;Can you do this benchmark for me and share the make, models and (all) your settings?&quot; then maybe you'll get a load of data but for the setup I shared we are still in the sub percent difference when we copy files to/from machines, change the switch and re-test. </s>
<s> This is why I don't bother sharing make and models. </s>
<s> These are FUNGIGLE. </s>

<s> Try this D-Link DIR-655 Xtreme N Gigabit Router. </s>
<s> I was thinking of ordering d-link dr-655, But after many post numerous searches and the recommendation of a few, Yesterday I ordered the LINKSYS WRT320N. </s>
<s> I hope I made the right choice. </s>
<s> I will keep posting. </s>
<s> I will receive it by the weekend. </s>
<s> Thanks to all. </s>
