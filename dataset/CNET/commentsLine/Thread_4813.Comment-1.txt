so i have a proxy server in my home that all the computers use to access the internet (xp pro).
i edited the host file on the proxy to redirect traffic for various reasons (ad blocking, etc.)
but i have noticed that it doesn't seem to affect the computers that use the proxy.
for example one entry in the host file could be 127.0.0.1 abc123.com so that abc123.com would loopback to the localhost.
for some reason this isn't working.
is there anyway to get this to work without changing the host file on each individual computer?
