You can't have a usable computer running Windows XP with only 256MB of RAM. 512MB is the bare minimum for Windows XP; you'll want 1GB if you're going to be playing games. Are you going to be playing ANY 3D games on this computer? If so, you'll want to get a better video card; the whole GeForce MX series sucked, and the FX5200 is the worst of them all. Also, I don't recommend that you go with the socket 754 platform; it's old, it doesn't support dual-channel RAM, and most motherboards have only an AGP slot. AMD has greatly dropped the prices of Athlon 64s; you can pick up a socket 939 Athlon 64 3000+ (this is the lowest model) for only $66. I'll post a parts list off of newegg (along with URLs) tomorrow morning; it's 11:45 here, and I'm tired.

I didn't include a power supply because I assumed your case has one already. Am I correct in my assumption?

He has a mid-tower case; the only thing bigger is a full-tower case, and those are for servers. ''airflow is very important and you need fans for the case.'' His case has an 80mm front fan, and a 120mm rear fan. IMO, that's good enough for a budget computer. Here's his case on newegg &quot;also get a good power supply. 550w should be the minimum with today's gear. 550W is way overkill for a budget computer. That parts list that I posted will run fine on a good 350W PSU. You only need 550W for a really high-end computer with multiple hard drives, video cards, etc.
