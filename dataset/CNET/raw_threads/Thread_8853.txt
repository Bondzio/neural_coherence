The thing is, a lot of them said the hardware was fine, but the software is horrible. I don't really get what they mean by software (it its the editing software or something else), but if I wasn't going to use the Pinnacle Software, would it be fine for me? I am planning to use Ulead Videostudio Software.

You can't imagine the number of posts about USB problems. As such, I toss about 1/2 the bad reviews out just because many can't resolve USB issues. On top of that there is no support from Dazzle to help you fix your PC's USB issue. I've used the Dazzle products and like them. But then I never have an USB issue. The software is, of course dated now. Plus those on DOS based OSes will scream about 4 GB file limits and what else will occur on the DOS based OSes. I know this is not a full answer, but do consider that the user reviews do have issues. If you want a little better solution, try some PCI TV capture card. Bob

Too bad you can't just buy the device without the software Pinnacle tosses at you, but the drivers for the device are on the same installation cd. If you buy it, just leave Pinnacle installed and ignore the program completely.....and set the default program to be the one you will be using instead. TONI

I was thinking about getting a TV Tuner, because the TV Tuner would kinda be an added bonus that I might use in the future - although the salesperson told me that the quality may not be as good. I was thinking of getting either a Hauppauge USB 2.0, or a Hauppauge PVR-250 TV Tuner. What would be better? One last thing, for the Pinnacle card, there is 256 MB Video Memory listed, is this a typo? because i've never seen video memory on a card of that category.

Are they in the same league as the ones in the previous post?

The Dazzle is still sitting on my desktop reading to plug in if I need it. The one thing I liked about the Dazzle was when I was copying my VCR movies that had the macrovision encryption, it ripped it right out all by itself instead of my having to use the device I bought separately. None of the internal cards ever could. TONI

It was easy to install, and use, but it was very proprietary about being the king of the hill in the system and I got more errors with that card installed (and its software) if I tried to go with using any other programs than anything else I've tried. The card is still here, but in my spare system instead. TONI

Such run about 49 bucks and you get your analog capture without any fuss. If you are going to go FIREWIRE, then the price plummets to under 20 bucks for Firewire card, cable and some software. Bob
1462	8	89317	1003127	1003103	ksoiehawo	2/27/05 5:00 PM	1.1095236E12	where can i get for 49 bucks?	Most cards I see are 100dollars and up. And as for digital/analog, I need both of them... THe thing I liked about the Pinnacle card was that it had both inputs, but then again - I already have a couple of firewire cards.
