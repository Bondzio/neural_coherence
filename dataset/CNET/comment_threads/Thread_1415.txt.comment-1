I just managed to get my PC To turn on after I got thing wrong with the risers.
However, I still have problems.
When the PC Switches on, The fans go on and light up, but I get no monitor output.
Oddly my HDD Doesent work, but If you take the IDE Ribbon out of the HDD, it works ??
?, I tried a really old HDD and it worked with the IDE Ribbon in but still no monitor output, no beeps to say anything is wrong, what going on?
