1.1.1	I am running windows XP on my computer and just installed a 200GB hard drive however , after I format the drive I only get 127 GB out of it , anyone can give me any Idea on how to get all 200GB out of this drive ?	Ques
1.1.2	Please e-mail me at winperry @ hotmail.com .	St
1.1.3	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	XP only gets you 127GB support .	St
1.2.2	SP1 patches it so you can do more , but with the danger that if you make an over 127GB partition , the data will go missing until you apply SP1 .	St
1.2.3	But you ca n't apply SP1 since the OS is not installed .	St
1.2.4	To get all around this issue , look up AUTOSTREAMER and make a proper XP CD with SP2 or order a XP SP2 CD from Microsoft .	St

1.3.1	Thank you much Bob , I will give it a try .	St

1.4.1	sometimes you need to make a change in the bios settings , so that that xp will recognise the bigger hard drive .	St
1.5.1	make a 100gb main , then do all the installs , then go back and make the secondary partition 100gb for storage ?	Ques
1.5.2	I do n't use more than 10gb or 20gb for main as cleanup , defrag and all goes faster , and I can redo the main partition without losing all I have stored in the other ones .	St
1.6.1	I have the same problem with a 160 gig drive .	St
1.6.2	I only get 128 gigs .	St
1.6.3	If I find anything I will let you know .	St
