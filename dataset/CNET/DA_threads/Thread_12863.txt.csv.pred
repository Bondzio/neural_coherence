1.1.1	I have a client that has the strangest Router problem .	St
1.1.2	Used 3 different routers so far , 2 wireless one non wireless .	St
1.1.3	An SMC router worked fine for about 6 months , then started giving her & quot ; Network cable unplugged & quot ; messages popping up ( near the time ) after being on for an hour or so .	St
1.1.4	Unplugging and replugging the router power got her back on , for an hour or so again .	St
1.1.5	Replaced the SMC wireless router with a Linksys WRT54G , a router I have used at many sites .	St
1.1.6	Same problem , keeps getting & quot ; Network cable unplugged & quot ; message .	St
1.1.7	Unplugging and replugging the router power fixes it for a while .	St
1.1.8	Bring in Linksys wired router BEFSR41 .	St
1.1.9	Plug it in and still getting occasional DSL drops but it pretty much disappeared , use different DSL modem and problem seems to go away .	St
1.1.10	Plug in the WRT64G router in my office and use it for 2 days on a system it was directly wired to .	St
1.1.11	It does n't go down once .	St
1.1.12	Give the SMC Wireless router she was having same problem with to a client , they have had no problems in a week .	St
1.1.13	Bring back WRT54G wireless router and plug it in , start getting the unplugged message regularly , up for an hour or 2 then down , still using replacement DSL modem .	St
1.1.14	It seems this house is haunted ! ! !	St
1.1.15	I am about to disable wireless on the WRT54G to see if that makes a different but does anyone have a clue as to what could be causing so many problems with multiple routers that work perfectly elsewhere .	St
1.1.16	I am beginning to suspect something on the wireless side is causing problems with the wired part of the routers .	St
1.1.17	I am using WEP encryption with the wireless .	St
1.2.1	Exact same problem fixed , maybe for you too .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1641363,00.asp It 's on the second page , interesting read .	St
1.2.3	Hope this helps .	St
1.3.1	Interesting article , I carry the Winsockxpfix file around with me on CD and USB key , so I will run it on the system and see if that does it .	St
1.3.2	When I tried the wired only router I did n't think of looking for a software solution , since it worked without fail , but this may be the answer .	St
1.4.1	Hello , I am a computer tech , and I have seen this problem in my own home system for the last 2 months .	St
1.4.2	I have been trying to find answers about this for a month now .	St
1.4.3	The problem started as a once in a while issue , but has now grown to almost every new connection I make .	St
1.4.4	Each time I go to a new link the network cable unplugged error occurs due to a drop out in the SMC 7004VBR router I use .	St
1.4.5	I spend a lot of time cleaning spyware from systems these days and have become very adept at finding these types of issues .	St
1.4.6	I use AdAware , spyblaster , spybots S/D , HiJack this , AntiVer , AdvancedAdmin tools , as well as direct registry cleanup work to keep up with the spy stuff .	St
1.4.7	I also use ZoneAlarm 4.5 firewall .	St
1.4.8	None of this has slowed this problem down .	St
1.4.9	I did try the obvious already , like reinstalling network components and drivers , changing network setup in the router , changed cables , ect .	St
1.4.10	I thought the problem may have something to do with SMC router bios flash that I had done about 2 months ago , but after seeing that you have the same issue with other routers makes me think that this is some type of hack .	St
1.4.11	Somebody is tracking us .	St
1.4.12	The odd part is that I setup a new SCSI drive with a copy of the new XP 64bit along with my old Win2K system , and after a short time it seems has the same problem as well .	St
1.4.13	It is also happening on my wifes XP Home sytem in the same net .	St
1.4.14	I think that this problem is from a local scanner program in my service area .	St
1.4.15	I am on Cox cable , and live right next to the Intel plant in Chandler , AZ .	St
1.4.16	Somebody may be hacking the cox loop I am on .	St
1.4.17	I have also wondered about the changing IP 's Cox issues .	St
1.4.18	If the new IP you get was leased for the last week by a someone who was visiting Warez or Hack sites that capture IP 's , then when that IP roles over to your system they will use it to direct infestations at you .	St
1.4.19	I do think this is how a great deal of the spyware is spread these days .	St
1.4.20	If someone can help isolate this issue I would be very thankful .	St
1.4.21	KJ	St
1.5.1	I have found an issue with the security settings in the internet connection wizard .	St
1.5.2	This is a common issue I find with infected computers .	St
1.5.3	You can reset the settings to default , but they will not stay .	St
1.5.4	If they reset to custom settings each time you check them then you have a problem .	St
1.5.5	Try can try changing the & quot ; intranet & quot ; settings to low instead of default , but this may hinder web page loading .	St
1.5.6	You should do a safe mode start and make the security changes in order to make the default changes stick .	Sug
1.5.7	Turn of the system restore settings in the service manager while you boot in safe mode since this will often bring back problems you do not want , and it does not work very well anyway .	St
1.5.8	I am beging to think this is an active X explote .	St
1.5.9	It may be big brother keeping tabs , or just some teenage hack with more brains then smarts .	St
1.5.10	I hope it is the later !	St
1.5.11	KJ	St
1.6.1	I was hoping this was the fix , but it did n't help .	St
1.6.2	With the WRT54G router the problem is just terrible , as it was with the SMC router .	St
1.6.3	With a non wireless router the problem does n't occur as often , but still happens every few hours .	St
1.6.4	The thing is , it pops up in the lower right corner saying & quot ; Network Cable Disconnected .	St
1.6.5	It also occurs to two other systems that are connected with a wire , it 's not as if there was just spyware in one system causing it .	St
