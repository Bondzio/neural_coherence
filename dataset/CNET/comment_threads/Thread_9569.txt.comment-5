Also, there are so many optical drive failures in old laptops like this that I always find myself demoing how a good drive works.
However, did you try a bootable USB memory stick?
I won't detail how since such is all over the internet.
Why I note this is that I have helped a few get onto some Linux on USB and get some use out of their otherwise useless broken hardware.
