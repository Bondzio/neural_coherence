I unplug the cable from the cd rom drive and the cd rom works. I know that this is probably a simple solution, but I don't know it. I appreciate the help that cnet has given me through the years and in the years to come. Thanks Flora

Many machines require both drives set to CS, others will want one drive master, the other slave. I won't be able to tell what yours will be. Bob
