Seconds, here is my problem: I have a 500gb external HD from Western Digital. Up until earlier tonight it was working fine. Now, however, it shows up in the Safely Remove Hardware window under USB Mass Storage Device as WD and it also shows up under the Computer Management window under Device Manager, Disk Drives, WD. Under the Computer Management window, when I click the connect option from the right-click menu option of Removable Storage which is under Storage, it says: The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it. This snapin's display may be inconsistent with the Removable Storage Device. If the problem persists please restart the snapin. Under Disk Management, 5 drives come up; my (C:) drive, my (D:) which is assigned to my CD/DVD-RW drive, two unlettered drives and a drive labeled MEDIADIRECT The last three are all FAT or FAT32 File Systems, none of which has the 500gb capacity that my external HD should. They all have healthy status, though two of the Partitions are of unknown variety. I would really appreciate any help anyone could offer and thank you so much for your time and help.

However, I figured I could treat this similarly to the drive being disconnected from the USB port by accident and simply restart the computer to have it read the drive properly. This did not work and now I am stuck in my current situation.

If it fails there also, it's time to disassemble it to find out if the failure is caused by the drive or by the enclosure (that are the two parts, roughly speaking). If it works there and not on your PC, try it on another USB-port and try another external disk also. Taken together, you'll get a much better picture of the problem than you've got now. I assume you tried a power-down/reboot on this PC already as the first thing, of course. Kees

Knowing that though, I'm not sure where to go from here as I have little experience with external HD - this being my first. Thank you for the response though.

Both can be gone south. If it's the enclosure, you can mount the drive in a new one and everything will be fine. If it's the disk, you'll have to buy a new disk and put in in the old enclosure or buy a new set. You can only find out by trying. If you don't feel confident to do it yourself, a visit to a nearby computershop might be useful. They'll be happy to check it for you provided you buy the replacement with them. Kees
