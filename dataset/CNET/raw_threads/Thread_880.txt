I have tried Ashampoo and Burnaware. The drive in question will read DVDs and burn CDs, but will not burn anything to DVD (i.e. backups, groups of files). I haven't added or deleted any programs over the period where it just stopped working. The drive is found in Device Manager as a DVD burner and is 'working properly'. I have updated the driver, unplugged the cable, reinstalled but nothing seems to work. I'm running XP/SP2. I have run NOD32 virus scans, Malwarebytes, Spybot, Adaware and nothing comes up as untoward so am thinking perhaps the drive is just dead, but I would've thought that it wouldn't play any disc or burn CDs if that's the case. All help would be appreciated.

CD/DVD lens cleaner. 3. Put in a new drive. I'm sure someone would want to spend more than 15 minutes and try anything but item 3 but after thousands of drives you know the procedure. Bob

Eventually I had to uninstall it and ended up with a similar problem to yours. In checking for a solution I noticed that someone had reinstalled some Media programme and solved this problem. I decided to reinstall the Roxio 9 that came with my Dell Inspiron and BINGO. My internal and external DVD/CD burners returned to the fold. Hope this suggestion is of use to someone. Gerry Donaghy
