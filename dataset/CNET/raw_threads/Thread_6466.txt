Everything was fine, until I restarted my computer Saturday. Then, my connection was gone. I click on the tray icon to connect to the &quot;default&quot; network (like D-Link, the router manufacturer, told me to), and it took awhile like it was connecting. Then, the balloon &quot;you have wireless network(s) available&quot; came up again. Same process. I could do this all day and get the same result. Today, I plugged my cable modem into my PC to see if my hub would find a new driver online or whatever it needs to do to work. I still have the same problem. Why did a simple restart (that I initiated because IE was going slowly) cause this, and how can I fix it? FCCid=mq4wub1k5 Thanks

The details are much too thin in your post to tell if you have driver or parasite problems, but just for completeness and education I supply this link and assure you that these pests do muck up the Layered Service Provider (hint: find LSPFIX).
