One is selling 2 256 mb sticks, for a cheaper price. Are there any cons to buying x2 256 Mb rather than x1 512 Mb (Besides the consideration of a future upgrade)?

Or just buy 1GB right now. Get the 1GB as 2 sticks of 512 so that you can have dual channel.

Bottom line, you can use one 512 DIMM vice two 256 DIMMs but doing so sacrifices performance. The other thing is get all the RAM you intend to use on your system upfront... then later you won't face the problem of removing low density RAM to add higher density RAM or finding RAM the works reliably with the old RAM.
