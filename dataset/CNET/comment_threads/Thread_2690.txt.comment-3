Most video card reviews show that card or its close cousin(series) as very good.
Your new game will certainly be better for it.
Is it worth the money, well I never spent that much for a video card as I'm a &quot;trailing edge&quot; sorta user not a bleeding edge and wait for costs to be more reasonable.
