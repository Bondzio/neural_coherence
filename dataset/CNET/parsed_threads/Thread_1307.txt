<s> Good day, I've been trying to reinstall AVG anti virus software, I get the following message Local machine: installation failed Installation: Error: Action failed for file avg7rsw.sys: starting service.... </s>
<s> The system cannot find the file specified. </s>
<s> (2) Rollback: Error: Action failed for file avgupsvc.exe: removing file.... Access is denied. </s>
<s> (5) %PATH% = &quot;C:\Program Files\Grisoft\AVG7\avgupsvc.exe&quot; I have no ideal. </s>
<s> My system crashed a few days ago and conducted a system recovery yet still had to reinstall all programs. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would help Thanks </s>
<s> ...only returns you computer to an earlier working state. </s>
<s> And as that could be years ago, it's no wonder you had to re-install all your applications. </s>
<s> As far as re-instlaling AVG...that should really be a question for the &quot;Virus and security Alerts&quot; forum shouldn't it? </s>
<s> Personally (I don't use AVG) that error you are getting looks like because you have done a system revovery, you OS has went back in time (it's one of those DeLorean PC's!) </s>
<s> but all the application folders are still there. </s>
<s> When you try to re-install AVG, it could be that it's finding another install and dropping you out with errors. </s>
<s> It could be that using Winblows Exploder and manually deleting the AVG7 directory would be enough to let you re-install. </s>
<s> It could be detecting updates and newer virus defintions and deciding that it'll go no further. </s>
<s> But again, you'd get better support in the other forum from people who actually use the software. </s>
<s> Good luck, GB. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply.... </s>
<s> Your right somehow I did a system recovery and tried to reinstall and kept bumpping heads with the files that was backed up. </s>
<s> I deleated all the avg files till I was able to install it again. </s>
<s> I should have made a post that I figured it out so that you could have spent your time on more important matters Once again thanks for your time. </s>
<s> Movin </s>
