I saw another 6BA+III board on ebay with a bad bios flash, so i bought it cheap. it says 6BA+III on the board, altho it looks somewhat different . . . anyway, I put my old, good 6BA+III BIOS chip in the newly purchased board and it booted up, but oh man, is it slow -- like an LX board. takes a good 5-8 seconds to check the 64 KB of memory. Also a 650 mhz slot one CPU is only seen as 400 mhz. (this board is rated for 850 mhz) so, is this an LX board incorrectly (or fraudulently) marked as the 6BA+III ? or is the swapped BIOS chip causing this speed limitation somehow? was only 3 bucks on ebay-- fj

My losses for such stand at ZERO boards in over 10 years. If I'm allowed a few &quot;saves&quot;, then I'm in the negative board losses. There is a method to flash the BIOS in a HOT FLASHING method. Which is how I recovered a few boards when I didn't have access to a device known as a PROM PROGRAMMER... If you want to try it, here's the GOOGLE to the method. http://www.google.com/search?&q=HOT+FLASHING
