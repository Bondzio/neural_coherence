hi!
so i just bought a new 1 gb crucial ram for my hp pavilion media center tv m7750n pc (  )and i can't seem to fit the ram into the slot on the motherboard (i have to force it in, and then the pc wont boot, and gives off a beeping sound).
the ram that i brought was crucial product #ct12864aa53e (1gb 240-pin dimm 128mx64 ddr2pc2-4200 unbuffered) and i'm sure that it matches the 2*1 gb ram that already came with my computer (i verified the memory specifications with hp's website and other websites) thanks for any suggestions.
i am desprate for that extra 1 gb performance, because i run really memory-eating apps!
