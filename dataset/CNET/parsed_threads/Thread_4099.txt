<s> Hi, I've spent the past few days reading around the topic of WiFi and would like to tap the experience of the forum now please. </s>
<s> I have a T42 Thinkpad with in-built Centrino/Intel WiFi that usually works well to pick up open source WiFI signals. </s>
<s> However, occasionally it fails to see signals that the computers of my friends are seeing, and I'd like to remedy that. </s>
<s> However, the questions that I've not been able to find answers to are: 1. </s>
<s> Will buying a Proxim Orinoco Gold or a Senao 362 PCMCIA card lead to a better signal sensitivity than my in-built mini PCI card? </s>
<s> I haven't been able to figure out a way to tell what the sensitivity in mW of my in-built card is. </s>
<s> They specs on the Proxim and Senao are for a sensitivity of 200mW but I've read that they really are more like 100mW. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what the sensitivity of a mini-PCI card in a Thinkpad T42 is? </s>
<s> 2.Will buying an omni antenna with a 9dB gain and an SMA card lead to a better signal than my in-built antenna? </s>
<s> The context for this question is that I've read that because all 802.11g signals have a wavelenth of 12.5 cm this means that the ideal antenna is 6.25 cm, which is apparently what is inside the screen of my laptop. </s>
<s> Furthermore, I've read that apparently higher gain is not necessarily better because the beam is more focused meaning that it tends to multipath. </s>
<s> Thanks very much for the replies! </s>
<s> Wifi, being in open airspace and uncontrolled can never mean that you use antenna X and card Y will assure you that it work better than antenna Y and card Z. </s>
<s> This concept is the hardest one to get across. </s>
<s> However there are new problems in the wifi world. </s>
<s> Just recently I ran into that new aircrack tool in my neighborhood. </s>
<s> My neighbors formerly good setup had tanked. </s>
<s> No range and spotty connects. </s>
<s> I got lucky in that the attack was on my wifi system first and afterwards I wrote about it and the fix in our security forum. </s>
<s> Now you know the wavelength you also know that moving just a few centimeters in any direction can help since there are weak or dead spots in many systems. </s>
<s> Sure, what hardware you note could help but anyone that tells you that it will always work better hasn't been out very long. </s>
<s> The surefire fix I've found is to move a few feet closer to the base station. </s>
