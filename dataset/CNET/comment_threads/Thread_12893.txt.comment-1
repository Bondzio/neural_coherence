We recently upgraded from a Linksys wireless B router to the Linksys WRT54GS wireless G router with speedbooster, and everything was working fine; our old linksys B adapters and our new wireless G laptop, but my netgear wireless B adapter doesnt work anymore, but it used to on the old router.
I have windows XP and tried using the windows wireless configuration tool and the one that came with the adapter.
I also tried using it on our other XP desktops and tried enabling and disabling WEP and nothing has worked.
Any ideas?
Thanks!
