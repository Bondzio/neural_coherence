i don't have an xbox 360, so that really isn't an option.
thats why i'm using my old pc.
also, i've seen most that stuff of bittorent and rss, but thanks anyways.
and i didn't discuss my use of bittorent really, so i'm hoping my thread isn't veering into bad territory or even grey territory.
if so i will tweek it some.
