<s> I have a computer that is constantly rebooting. </s>
<s> It is running windoze XP. </s>
<s> 1GB ram. </s>
<s> 3GHZ pentium If I use my Windows XP install disk and try to reinstall XP it goes into the same reboot mode. </s>
<s> If I run a Windows XP LIVE CD the system works fine. </s>
<s> I can do anything I want and examine everything errorfree. </s>
<s> Another system has same problem except it is a windows 2000 system and it also works fine with Windows XP live. </s>
<s> At first I was thinking hardware and changed out the RAM, Video Card, CPU, and anything that could be swaped out. </s>
<s> The LIVE CD will run the same with old hardware and new hardware on both systems. </s>
<s> Windows recovery will do nothing on either system (as usual). </s>
<s> That comment can derail a plea for help. </s>
<s> It shows that you may be ready to argue about something. </s>
<s> Try a new post without that for best results. </s>
