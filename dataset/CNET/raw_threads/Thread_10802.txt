What is make, model and OS you are running? If all else fails, you could mount the old drive in an external box, either USB or Firewire, and go from there.

Here's some links on how to recover your OS. Again, if there are files you can't lose, then you would have them on some other media because this area is all about risk. Read a few of these if you are moving and hoping to save an OS install step. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=XP+CHANGE+MOTHERBOARD Bob
