You could always buy a small netbook, plug the webcam to it.
Place the webcam connected to the netbook connected to the router in a house near a window.
Start up the webcam.
When you want to view the webcam do a Remote Desktop Connection/Protocol (RDP) to the netbook and view it from there.
This is if it's wireless-N. (Check specs to make sure you can connect wirelessly 400ft with wifi-n.
I'm not 100% sure you can.)
