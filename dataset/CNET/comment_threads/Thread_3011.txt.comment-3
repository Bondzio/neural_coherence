We don't know what's on the CD-ROM (or is it a DVD?)
2.
We don't know the system requirements for the program.
3.
In fact, we don't even know what program it requires.
4.
We don't have the user manual nor the help files nor the instruction that came with the CD's So we can't help in any way.
It has been suggested you contact the college that gave you these CD's for help.
That's the best advice possible, I think.
