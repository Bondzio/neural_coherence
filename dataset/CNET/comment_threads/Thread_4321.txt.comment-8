I know my new pc's HD is a lot better and all.
But have you ever heard of this kind of situation where people have things on their old HD that they want to put into their new pc?
Hmm... that sounds like a possibility, right?
That's why I need to put the old HD into my new pc!
DUH!!!!
Damn smart *****..
