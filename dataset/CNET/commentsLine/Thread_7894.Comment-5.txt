thanks for replying, but those are all me.
as you can see all accounts registered from this to those websites are at different times, with about a year of difference between registration so i was changing between aliases.
i asked the exact same question (reworded a bit) on like 5 sites, so all the answers were replied to me and ive seen them all, but the assumption that hdcp isnt supported doesnt really convince me as i live on a tight budget as an ubi student and i cant afford to go buy another lcd.
thats why my second question (you've replied to my other thread, thanks), was that can i use acer x203w instead of this for ps3 gaming?
1080p or 720p doesnt matter, i just want to be able to play ;d
