I took your advice and started reading the Storage forum and got a better understanding of the difference between backing up and simply copying.
So I'm wondering if the right solution for me (remember, my problem is I need to off-load all my files so I can replce my OS) is not adding a drive with storage capacity at all but buying a DVD burner and putting everything on DVD.
That seems to be a more secure solution.
So, is there a DVD burner that makes sense?
Another complication is that I'm still running jaguar and I'm finding mostproducts (such as the external drives) are no longer compatible with that OS.
