my network works great, as far as the laptop connecting to the internet.
but i would like some input on setting up file sharing, as well as printing from the wireless laptop.
the pc is hard-wired to the modem and router (d-link wbr-2310).
the printer is connected to the pc.
the pc is running windows xp.
the laptop is running vista.
the printer is a canon pixma mp450.
thanks.
