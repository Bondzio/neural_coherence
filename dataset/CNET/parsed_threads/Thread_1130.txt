<s> Hi All I am running windows XP pro and just install 200GB hard drive as a slave however, after I format the drive I only get 127 GB out of it, is there any way I can get the max 200 GB out of this drive? </s>
<s> I use a 80GB as master, anyone with an idea could please e-mail me at winperry@hotmail.com Thanks much </s>
<s> you need a pci contoller card to get your computer to recongnize the 200GB Hard drive </s>
<s> To go past that, you need SP1 (SP2 preferred) and a BIOS that supports 48BIT LBA. </s>
<s> More at http://www.48bitlba.com/ Since you have just XP Pro and no SP1 or SP2, a PCI card will not fix this. </s>

<s> I just went through this, I installed a 200Gb Seagate as drive D: and kept OS on drive C: (80Gb)on XP. </s>
<s> The new drive intructions had me go online and download a file that made XP see past 127GB. </s>
