and then you get to fool with voltages, and then with... the amd 2400+ should have been set to &quot;factory specs&quot; of multiplier of 15, fsb 133 and voltage 1.65 in the first place though.
with the 100 mhz you were underclocking yours.
play around with it (if you fry it they are pretty cheap).
stability and longevity of components is a good reason to not oc but realistically you are likely not going to keep the same system long enough to allow that to make much difference.
had a pentium pro 200 that i ran at 266 for three years without problem and a pentium pro 166 that i clocked to 233 that gave up the ghost after about 4 months.
