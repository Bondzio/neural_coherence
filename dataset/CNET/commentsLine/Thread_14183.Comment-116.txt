a friend of mine had vic-20 and that piqued my interest for computers.
it was about the time the c-128 came out, so i waited for it instead of buying a c-64.
ended up running the 128 in 64 most of the time!
another friend took an c-64 and set it up and ran a small bbs with it.
those emulators work great.
its like playing the real thing.
the one i use even simulates the wait time for those programs to load from the floppy disk!
sorry i cannot provide information about it, because i bought it at a trade show and there is no identifying information on it.
does anyone remember the compute gazette!
magazine written for commodore?
thats where i got a lot of my games.
the aforementioned cd has all of the old gazette!
programs.
no more bleary eyes in the wee hours of morning trying to sort out my gobus from gosub aaaaah, the good ole' days!
