1.1.1	The AMD HD9600WCGDBOX Phenom 9600 Quad Core Processor is about $20 more than the AMD HD9600WCJ4BGD Phenom 9600 Quad Core Processor.	St
1.1.2	I was looking the specs for each and they are both the same.	St
1.1.3	Is there a difference between the 2 besides the part numbers?	St
1.2.1	the oem part will not come with a heatsink/fan.	St
1.3.1	the other 'RETAIL', then another difference is product warranty.	St
1.3.2	Warranty on OEM products is from the retailer/seller and is usually whatever the retailer/seller provides ...30 days, 60 days, 90 days etc.,.	St
1.3.3	On the otherhand, retail boxed CPUs whether Intel or AMD, usually have 3 year warranties from the manufacturer.	St
1.3.4	My recommendation, get a retail boxed CPU which gives you the HS fan and the longer 'manufacturer-backed' warranty.	St
1.3.5	VAPCMD	St
