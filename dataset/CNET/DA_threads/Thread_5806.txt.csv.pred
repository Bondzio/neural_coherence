1.1.1	Hey, I am a student, and therefore on a tight budget.	St
1.1.2	My CRT monitor is starting to warp the text at the corners of the monitor and along the edges.	St
1.1.3	(the text is smaller at the edge than at the center of the screen) Is there any way to crack open the case and adjust this?	St
1.1.4	Obvioulsy, this thing is out of warranty, and when I do replace it I will just fork over the extra bucks for an LCD, but other than that, the monitor looks great and it is only three years old.... Kirby	St
1.2.1	About all you can do is try using the front panel controls to minimize such distortion such as trapezoid, barrel and pincushion (if these are available).	St
1.2.2	A good degaussing might help but this is mostly for correcting color distorion and convergence.	St
1.2.3	The innards of the monitor are not for the timid.	St
1.2.4	You would never be able to find the pots and other adjustments in the yoke that might achieve a better image.	St
1.2.5	My guess is most would make it worse as well as be subject to possible sever electrical shock from the charge that might remain on the envelope.	St
1.2.6	A three year old monitor is not that new and there might be some degradation of components that you cannot compensate for.	St
1.2.7	Sorry.	St
1.2.8	Wish I had more hopeful news.	St
