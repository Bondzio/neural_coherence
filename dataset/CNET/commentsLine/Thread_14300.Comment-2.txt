&quot;see other computers, access files from the server and use the shared printer but can not access the internet.&quot; let's reduce this to just this sentence.
to get to the internet we need a few things to work.
1. the dns (name resolving.)
2. a route to the internet.
break down the issue to item 1 or 2. ie.
test the dns and then the route.
