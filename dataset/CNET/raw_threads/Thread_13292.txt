Your integrated video uses &quot;shared&quot; RAM which means memory on the motherboard. If you put a dedicated video card in your PC, it will have it's own RAM and will not share memory from the motherboard. This means it doesn't matter what kind of RAM is on the video card you buy. Hope that helps.

I will not write more about how the video card's ram is on it's own card and system so it can be DDR, SDRAM, DDR2, 3 or other. 2. Your PC -&gt; http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?lc=en&dlc=nl&cc=nl&lang=nl&product=495498 3. * Three PCI * No AGP slot 4. With the limited PSU (see google) I might try this card: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SP94GT512D2LHPP 5. It's up to you to check for clearances since it has a big heat sink. 6. I bet this machine may need the cover left off to avoid overheating with this. Bob
