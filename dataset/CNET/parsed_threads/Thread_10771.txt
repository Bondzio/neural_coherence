<s> Hi, My partner has a Samsung Galaxy Tab GT P1010. </s>
<s> She switched it on earlier and it went into the normal media scan which scans both the internal memory and the SD card for media files. </s>
<s> For some reason, the media scan is not scanning the SD card, and remains at 0%. </s>
<s> She left it to run for several hours to see if this would fix the problem and it hasn't helped. </s>
<s> We have done the following: 1) </s>
<s> As there is no known Android virus, why uninstall that today? </s>
<s> (do they have Avast for android?) </s>
<s> Also, I'd seen that when a video file is corrupt. </s>
<s> Be sure to remove all the files from the card and start with a fresh format. </s>
<s> Then add half the files. </s>
<s> If it works the file it locked up on is on the other half. </s>

<s> Hi Bob Iwas going to post a question about antivirus. </s>
<s> I've read many conflicting reports on it and decided to put Dr Web on my Android tablet. </s>
<s> Here, a for example. </s>

<s> Hi, Yes Avast does have a Android version. </s>
<s> I asume this is because Android is very popular for cyber crinimals. </s>
<s> I'd like to read what virus is out there. </s>
<s> And I'm honest about my question. </s>
<s> Remember I asked about a virus. </s>
<s> Not a trojan or malware. </s>
<s> To work this issue I still have to clean off the machine and start putting files 1/2 at a time back on the card to see what it didn't like. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> what game was installed on the day the problem started. </s>
<s> Bob, Iunderstand your post on the difference between a virus and trojan/malware but in the example I posted, does not this thing replicate itself? </s>
<s> It seems they had this problem before installing that av so your advice is sound. </s>
<s> Idon't want to hijack this thread so I won't input anymore on av for Android. </s>
<s> Iwill start a new thread soon to discuss av/Android soon. </s>
<s> I have to be honest, I am on the fence about av and Android. </s>
<s> Thanks for discussing, Dafydd. </s>
<s> Let's focus on that card for a bit. </s>
<s> My method is to empty the card to a local folder then format the card and see if the Android is OK with that card. </s>
<s> OK. Now toss 1/2 the files back on it and re-test. </s>
