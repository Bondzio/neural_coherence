I had it on connect on demand but during an online game it kept thinking the connection was idle, so it would disconnect messing up the game. So I set it up on keep alive, well it would keep the connection, but everytime it wasnt used for a few hours it would disconnect and I have to go into router settings and reconnect manually. What should I do?

It sounds like your router software sucks. Dial on Demand is pretty self explanatory. Any packet destined for the internet constitutes &quot;demand&quot;. There should also be some &quot;Idle Timer&quot; settings that are used to disconnect the router after some time of no traffic. Setting these to 0 usually means never hang-up. Some ISPs automatically disconnect you after many hours to prevent you from setting up a Mail or FTP server. You might try rebooting the router before a really long gaming session to get a fresh login and restart the ISPs timer, if you think it is your ISP screwing with you. Check you IP address on the router once a day and see if it is changing. SKrall

When going to the linksys site they have 5-6 different &quot;versions&quot; of my router. How do I know which version I have? I tried putting a 0 in under the idle time, but must be greater than 1. I am thinking the losing of the connection must be someting to with the internet because the wireless signal usually remains at a constant 54 Mbps without dropping.

I even set my laptop up using an ethernet cable, to see if it was wireless signal interference. So that can't be the case.
