is running at 800 mhz.
you are using ddr memory [double data rate] two reads/writes per clock cycle, on one memory bus [thus 400 mhz].
your mobo has two memory busses for use with dual channel memory.
thus [if you have two sticks of &quot;matched&quot; memory sticks plugged into the proper memory sockets] you would have two memory busses feeding the mch and then the cpu, each bus double data rate.
thus you get 4 memory reads/writes[oversimplified] at 200 mhz which = 800 mhz.
