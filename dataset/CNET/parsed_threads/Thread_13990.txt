<s> One of my roommates just purchased the Linksys PLK200 Powerline Adapter set for about $200 at our local Best Buy. </s>
<s> Looking around the internets it seems that I can get an additional Adapater (PLE200) for about $85. </s>
<s> My question is would I be able to buy a Powerline Adapater from a different manufacturer (less $$) that would still be compatible with his system? </s>
<s> I think the answer is yes, but I was hoping for a 2nd opinion from someone with a bit more networking smarts than me. </s>
<s> $5 difference at the most; so why not just stick with linksys? </s>
