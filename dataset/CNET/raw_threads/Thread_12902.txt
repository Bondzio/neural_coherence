My pc did not shut off for the whole 10 minutes I ran it while my graphics card was under 100% load and 101% power draw. This threw me off completely and now I don't know what is going on. This didn't start happening until I reinstalled bf3 and punkbuster.(PB is for connecting to servers in bf3) I also would like to add that updating my nvidia drivers only made it shut off instantly when graphics were loaded instead of a few minutes after. I have had the same setup for about 4-5months and I have never had this problem until now. i5 3570k z77a-gd55 2x4 gskill 1600mhz cas 8 256g samsung 830 series MSI gtx 670 Power edition Corsair HX750w 80 Plus gold with 90% efficiency

The problem didn't start until I moved into a new place and reinstalled bf3 and punk buster. I tried updating the drivers to see if it would fix the issue a few days later.

Sadly you have to use what you've learned so far to make your best guess at what to replace. From my lessons in the field I find it's usually the video card if the machine is fine in respect to power, cooling and such. The hard part is the owner. Most paid dearly for the video card and will second guess you every time. That's fine but you have to base your decisions on either a hard fail, swap a thing or what you've seen over the years. In this case I give the nod to trying another video card given the story so far. HOWEVER!!!!! Be sure to research that BF3 game forums. It would not be funny to find folk with lockup/reboot/freeze issues in that forum and then find a patch there. I did not do your research for you on that topic. Bob
