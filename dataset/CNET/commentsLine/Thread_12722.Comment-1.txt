i'm new to the whole buying thing... i used to have a buddy build them but he moved.
i'm planning on buying a desktop because i'm useless at the whole building thing and i really want a pretty good gaming rig but don't want to spend a rediculous amount of money on it... no more than $3000-$5000... $3000 is better so i still have electricity to run it.
suggestions for companies, configurations, and/or specs are greatly appreciated.
**at least 3.0 ghz procesor and a good amount of hd space are ideal.
