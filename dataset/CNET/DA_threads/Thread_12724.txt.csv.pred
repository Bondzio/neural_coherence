1.2.1	on desktop ... even on stand alone pc .	St
1.2.2	turning off the pc is much better than using standby or hibernate ...	St
1.3.1	Gakada is correct -- on some systems , there are problems with returning from standby and hibernate .	St
1.3.2	Sometimes a motherboard BIOS update that fixes this is available .	St
1.3.3	I did run into a wireless-g network adapter that exhibited this behaviour and was able to fix it by installing a newer firmware version .	St
1.3.4	Note that not all adapters have upgradable firmware .	St
1.3.5	Check to see if there is newer driver to download for the adapter .	St
1.3.6	Sometimes there is a network adapter setting that allows the computer to turn off the device to save power .	St
1.3.7	Try turning this feature OFF .	St

1.4.3	I use StandBy ALL the time - except for restarting once a week or so - I close the notebook cover and it goes in to StandBy .	St
1.4.4	Open it , and it is back on - Quickly .	St
1.4.5	.	St
1.4.6	I used to use Hibernate , but StandBy leaves the electronics warm - better than cooling down and heating up frequently .	St
1.4.7	The hard drive is off ( maybe good , maybe not so good . )	Polite
1.4.8	And , it comes back to life very quickly .	St
1.4.9	.	St
1.4.10	I think that Hibernate makes much more use of the HardDrive , and I know that it takes MUCH longer to re-start .	St

1.4.12	Does anyone know of good reasons NOT to use StandBy regularly ? ?	Ques
