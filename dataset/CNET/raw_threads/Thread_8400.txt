Not only is it as useless as **** on a boar, but they won't refund your purchase! I spent weeks with the D-Link tech folks, who are as frustrated as their customers. They can't get a firmware made that will keep the unit online and conflict-free. What ends up happening, as a customer, you end up as their beta-tester... and you get to pay for the privilege! If you are thinking of buying this junk-bin item, do your homework! Read up on all the other users pulling their hair out trying to get their units working. You have been warned!

In closing, we see this complaint about many routers. Can you try it per our forum sticky and reveal if P2P use is part of the problem? Bob

SOL P2P is not an issue. Simply getting the unit to stay connected was. Rebooting was required every 5 to 10 minutes, and was the suggested remedy by D-link tech support. That, and trying various firmwares. All of which made little difference. Replacing the router was the most effective solution.

If by CC, call them and explain that the product was defective from day one and what to do next. I've used far too many routers but the recurring advice is to use our forum's preferred settings. If you already replaced it, then back to the CC company. Bob
