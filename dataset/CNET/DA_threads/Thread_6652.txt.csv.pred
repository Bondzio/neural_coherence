1.2.1	What exactly did your ISP ( what ISP ? )	Ques
1.2.2	do to your router ( what router ? )	Ques
1.2.3	to influence the working of your LAN ?	Ques
1.2.4	And why ca n't you undo it via the router management page ?	Ques

1.2.6	Kees	St
1.3.1	so , router is fine , no one changed anythig , it`s new .	St
1.3.2	i installed it , configured it : put the right ip gateway dns , cloned mac , but still no internet .	St
1.3.3	when i asked the person that is in charge with the internet services ( i live in a student hostel ) he said that he can`t tell me what i have to do , but if i figure it by myself it will be ok .	St
1.3.4	In the hostel our lan connection its limited : we can not use torrents , or things like dc++ and also we can not have routers so we can share the lan .	St
1.3.5	i really want to work this out cause i have 2 laptos , ipad and phone so i need wireless .	St
1.4.1	If your ISP wants to limit your # of hops , you 're stuck with respecting that or trying to hack it and take the consequences .	St
1.4.2	Cnet forum policies do n't allow help with hacking .	St
1.4.3	You 'll have to contact your ISP and plead your case as an exception .	St
