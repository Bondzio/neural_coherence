you could do wireless networking for a really good solution.
what os are your computers, do they have nic's, if they do then you could make your own crossover cable:  and connect the two computers directly together, but if they are old then you might have trouble.
if you do decide to use wireless networking then i can help you set up folder sharing and other things.
