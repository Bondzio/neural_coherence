Sorry.
Did I mention that I am a novice?
How do I 'properly slave the other drive or temporarily connect it to another IDE port until finished'?
Can you please give me a quick run down or link me to an appropriate site.
Either way, thank you very much for your help Steven.
I assume I go into 'bios' and slave it there.
Can I slave it before I connect it?
