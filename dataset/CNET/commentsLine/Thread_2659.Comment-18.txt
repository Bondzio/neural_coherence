i have lost two (count 'em, 2!)
western digital hard drives, complete with all my data, when they were less than a year old.
i got 'em at different times and they were different sizes, yet they both died without any indication whatsoever; right in the middle of garden-variety computing tasks (no intense database work, video editing, or cd-burning chores were being performed at the time) they just crashed without warning - the first i knew of it was the bsod, which was also the last thing i knew, as well.
in both cases no data could be recovered from the discs, not even professionally.
now that's what i call crummy, snake-bitten, turd-rate hard drives!
give me seagate any old day, after that nightmarish experiece.
