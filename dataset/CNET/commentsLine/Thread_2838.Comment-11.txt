i just bought the case from tigerdirect.
it's a nexstar 3. i'm pretty sure it's just the drive is messed up somehow.
i took it to my brother's house and put the drive in his external case and windows wouldn't even recognize that a drive was there and it kept locking up the disk managment in my computer.
then i tried his drive in my case and it worked like a champ.
i even tried the killdisk tool to completely reset the drive to zeros and that didn't help any either.
i guess i've just got a 400gb paperweight at this point.
i know one thing...i'll never buy another seagate drive...this thing as been nothing but trouble.
