I work in publishing and I use applications like Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator often. I find that I need to run at least two of these applications simultaneously along with the standard Outlook and Internet Explorer. At times, my system slows to a crawl (P4 2.8, 768MB RAM, 128 NVidia Ti4200, 50GB HD). What suggestions would you make to help me modify this? I have tinkered with the idea of dual processors but then there is the P4 Extreme Edition. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Robert

As to your machine crawling, the only time I see this is if the user leaves programs running they are not using. Also, INTERNET EXPLOERER is a great way to let parasites on the machine and again the complaints are similar to yours. Post if you dare a hijackthis log and let's see if your machine has parasites. I will not do much other than note if I see them. Bob

To run those applications simultaneously, you need: a professional graphic card the like nvidia quadro nvs280 or fx500 or ati firegl (128 NVidia Ti4200 is maily design for 3d game applications), and 2 or 3 identical harddisks in raid 0 or raid 5 configuration, (for speedy data transfer between data processing and storage subsystem, as these graphic application uses a large tempfile and stored it in harddisk as scratchdisk. eg. while composing an A0-size poster in photoshop, the tempfile can be blotted to more than 1 gb, and you need to partition your hd into several drives around 20-40gb each), and 1536 MB RAM is the minimun.
