too bad, you're learning the hard way that power issues effect the whole system.
3mo.
isn't long for a decent system to feel the effects of a poor psu.
you did the right thing in covering the repair, replacing both psu and mtrbd.
but it &quot;seems&quot; you settled on a lesser wattage unit(same value?)
and not a higher wattage one in the replacement process and in all probably used the same cpu, etc.
componets to rebuild the system.
a secnondary problem was lying in wait of one of the other componets.
you should remove all hds, cds, and even the fd drive and make it as simple as possible system.
try then to reboot, if it fails quickly, shutdown.
now, teardown the whole system and rebuild it with care to mounting posts, cabling etc.
back to a simple system to rerty again.
it need not be in the system case, on cardboard or *non-conductive&quot; surface to make the system to see what the results are.
if it still fails, then again the mtrbd.
or psu was made kaput.
if not and it boots-up, then add &quot;one&quot; componet at a time until it fails or seems to be stable.
allow it work for awhile, just leave it alone for hrs.
and see if it still works.
return to system case if it does and proceed there one step at a time.
verify all your work, etc., no guessing or taking anything for granted, if any thoughts, replace or test elsewhere.
