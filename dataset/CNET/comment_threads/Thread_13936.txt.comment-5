I took your advice on using a wattage calculator, which didn't include the wattage used for the 3 fans in my computer and it came to 481 watts (I am amazed that my 300 watt PSU has held up for the past seven years) And as you surmized, I do plan on upgrading this computer or building a new one which I plan on doing over the next year or two, so that is why I was looking at the 650 watt range.
The reason for putting in a new power supply unit is that my computer has just recently started to randomly reboot and it is one of the symptoms of a failing PSU, of course it could be do to something else.
So far this rebooting has not been a major problem since it has not occurred more than once in any given day and does not happen every day.
I have seen good reviews regarding the Corsair PSU, otherwise I don't know how to determine which brand is considered &quot;decent&quot;.
Also, how do I determine if it is compatible with my motherboard?
