hi bob, thanks so much for your reply.
wow, internet bill doubles??!!
i won't be going that route also, thank you so much for spotting that in the manual.
i read through that document and there are 2 places that wep is mentioned but still i look at the screen and there is no where that i see wep.
my hunch was that you are right so i investigated futher.
so in order to use wep, which is not mentioned in the document, is the following.
i am going through the trouble in case someone else needs to do so.
advanced tab -&gt; setup -&gt; wireless setup and under wireless network 2.4ghz change the mode to 'up to 54mps'.
once that is done wep is revealed!
so thanks again as you spurred me on into finding this though investigation.
