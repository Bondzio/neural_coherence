You should open up your computer though and make sure your card is a PCIe. And not only that, make sure your power supply has a 6 pin connector dedicated to the PCIe card. If it doesn't, you're going to need a new power supply. And thats going to be a hassle to track down. Otherwise, great card. Great price too. A few of the reviews have it running at 64 degrees. That's pretty hot, but one guy said thats normal.

I was going to run a plastic pipe to it but was afraid of moisture getting in there. These high performance cards are great, but they generate a lot of heat. Some people even have liquid coolers.
