First of all, I want to start by saying I am a person who has 4 backups of my essential data at any given time.
I keep a golden image of my machines as well backup my personal data in several locations.
But to have a complete disk image of a raid array that I want to eventually reach 4tb would just be impractical.
I understand what your saying.
It is important to have backups of your data so you can get everything back in the event of a catastrophe, but all I want to do is build my system with one hard drive now, and add more in the future, the easiest way possible.
