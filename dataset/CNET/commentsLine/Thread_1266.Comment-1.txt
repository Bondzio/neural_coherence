i have a hp d7160.
it's indicated for a few weeks that the (icon) needs to be replaced soon.
all ink colors are represented by icons, and nowhere is the color spelled out.
i finally replaced it with a brand new, boxed, sealed hp ink cartridge bought at cvs.
it then said something about a previously used cartridge.
i was blown away!
it does seem to be working almost normally now.
none of the other ink indicators showed that any other cartridge was anywhere near low in the last two months.
i do little printing.
now it says that the following cartridge is now depleted - and displays an icon with no color - the inside of the icon is white, as the background color of the printer display is white.
i cannot get any response at all on the hp site.
anyone here have a clue about this?
