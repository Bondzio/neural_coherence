Anybody familiar with a thermaltke V1?
Thermaltake V1 P/N:CL-P0401 I can't register at their forums.
Some debug error.
Won't let me register.
It is great good reviews and all.
The only thing is the fan connector is 3 pin.
My motherboard is 4 pin for CPU?
Should I connect it anyway to the 3 and leave the 4th alone?
Or should I take it back?
Thanks, Confusimo
