<s> Hello, Can the recycle bin be moved to another drive to free up space on the C drive? </s>
<s> I use XP. </s>
<s> Each disk has it's own recycle bin that is set up automatically. </s>
<s> To regain space on your C drive, run CleanDisk frequently, emptying the recycle bin each time. </s>
<s> Since you must have another drive (else you would not have asked about moving the Recycle Bin there), you should move more of your files to that drive. </s>
<s> Actually, there are several reasons why it is best to have your OS, programs, and other seldom-changed files on the C drive and have your My Documents folder(s) and other data folders on another drive. </s>
<s> Hope this helps Frank </s>
