<s> I have an AD73 PRO, (AMD2000+) Skt-A, KT266A +8233A, DDR, ATX, AC97, ATA133 Motherboard When trying to install an NVIDIA GeForceFX5200 AGP video card I am having IRQ sharing problems. </s>
<s> Can I force the IRQ for the video card through the BIOS? </s>
<s> I cannot move any of the other cards in the PCI slots. </s>
<s> Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling the cards and drivers but no luck. </s>
<s> Is there a solution? </s>
<s> WINXP Pro isnt allowing me to change the IRQ. </s>
<s> This is on NVIDIA's site [With more devices being included in today's PC systems, it forces system builders to install components that share IRQ's with other devices. </s>
<s> Some components do not like sharing IRQ's and can lead to system lock ups.. Generally, the graphics card should have its own IRQ and not be sharing one with any other device. </s>
<s> The only thing that should be sharing the same IRQ as the graphics card is an IRQ holder for PCI steering. </s>
<s> If you have anything else sharing the same IRQ as the graphics card, you must change that device's IRQ assignment. </s>
<s> The easiest way to do this is to simply to move the device, which is sharing the IRQ with the graphics card, to a different PCI slot. </s>
<s> Some motherboards also allow you to force an IRQ. </s>
<s> Check with your motherboard manufacturer to see if this feature is available on your motherboard. </s>
<s> Copyright 2004 NVIDIA Corporation] The only open slot I have is next to the AGP slot and too close to the heat sink on the new video card. </s>
<s> How can I resolve this? </s>
<s> It's causing the system to crash even just when accesing mymsn. </s>
<s> Not to mention the havoc in trying to load Hitman. </s>
<s> I've tried DFI's website there's no answer to be found there. </s>

<s> Today's systems can share IRQs. </s>
<s> What OS are you having an issue with? </s>
<s> In fact, what is the issue? </s>
<s> Most of the time it's the out of date BIOS or one forgot to load the motherboard driver package. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Rare to see IRQ conflicts on non-ISA boards. </s>
<s> Just some thoughts ----&gt;&gt; From your post I see 2 IRQ's listed, 5 and 11. </s>
<s> Is their more and if not, why? </s>
<s> ...My System... IRQ 0 </s>
<s> you're able to run your PC if u r accessing the internet and doing other stuff, yes? </s>
<s> R u able to change display property settings? </s>
<s> Is the new card listed in Device Manager? </s>
<s> Do you have to disable onboard video in BIOS to use the new card? </s>
<s> device manager&gt;video&gt;gforce&gt;properties&gt; and see if u can set configuration manually. </s>
<s> Sorry that was just the conflicts/sharing info. </s>
<s> Here's the IRQs IRQ 0 </s>
<s> I'm able to use the display settings not a problem. </s>
<s> It's just that WINXP PRO is automatically assigning the IRQs and cluttering up 5 & 11 and I can't figure out how to reassign. </s>
<s> This should have been just a simple upgrade from a 64mb Geforce 440 MX to a 128mb Geforce5200 FX. </s>
<s> The computer is 2 yrs old and I didn't want to spend too much on a video card for a pc with a AMD Athlon XP 2000+. </s>
<s> I was planning on building new next year when I hope my budget is less restrictive. </s>
<s> Usually the PCI slot nearest to the AGP slot is hard wired to share an IRQ, no way to change that. </s>
<s> I would remove the serial port on IRQ 3 and the video card in device manager, then reboot but stop at the bios setup screen. </s>
<s> In bios, disable the serial port on IRQ 3, or both if you don't have a modem, and if your bios allows, set the APG slot to IRQ 3. </s>
<s> Reboot into Windows and see what IRQ is assigned. </s>
<s> If you disable the parallel port, your printer may stop working. </s>
<s> Is windows reporting a conflict or are you reading it this way? </s>
<s> PCI devices are designed to share IRQs and controlled by the O/S. </s>
<s> Unless windows is saying their is a problem your issue lies elsewhere. </s>
<s> This statement &quot;If I try to access too much information whether it's a game or mutliple websites the system crashes.&quot; Before or after video card install? </s>
<s> 2 year old system 1. power supply may be getting weak. </s>
<s> 2. power supply too small with new card 3. </s>
<s> Are you overclocked? </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Heat 5. </s>
<s> Open Task Manager -&gt; log your CPU and memory use. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> (slim, very slim) H/D failing Bill . </s>
<s> Also, some motherboards sugggest you not use PCI slot 1 if you can help it(the one next to AGP). </s>
<s> You mentioned having all slots filled. </s>
<s> Old video card wasn't an issue, but new could be(heat, for one thing). </s>
<s> Probably not, but what are all your slots filled with? </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> slot 1 is empty (too close to heat sink on new video card anyway) Heat not a problem according to temp. </s>
<s> Slot 2 is Lucent modem (not being used so I disabled it running DSL through ethernet anyway) Slot 3 ethernet card Slot 4 Sound card Slot 5 USB 2.0 card </s>
<s> After start up if I go to IE system crashes on MY MSN. </s>
<s> But not on homepage. </s>
<s> This was only after new card install. </s>
<s> (new card was purchased only to meet requirements of newer games)But after new card install System crashes on Splinter Cell Pandora tomorrow and HitMan Contracts) Haven't loaded other games out of frustration. </s>
<s> Crashes mostly occur after inital start up. </s>
<s> Not overclocked (don't know how) Heat apparently not a problem. </s>
<s> Multiple fans all working nothing too close to VidCard. </s>
<s> Temp within safe ranges. </s>
<s> Can open case with big fan blowing still crashes. </s>
<s> CPU usage does seem to have some high random spikes. </s>
<s> Power supply should still be adequate. </s>
<s> My prev post included FAQ from NVIDIA cite stating the VID card needs it's own IRQ. </s>
<s> (wasn't my assumption) So far unable to achieve it's own IRQ assignment. </s>
<s> I Disabled Serial and Parallel ports(not being used anyway) Disabled Lucent Modem on PCI slot 2 (also not being used, DSL is wired through Ethernet card slot 3) Slot 4 is sound card Slot 5 is USB 2.0 card WINXP PRO keeps reassigning randomly it seems, below is latest IRQ assigns. </s>
<s> It still keeps humping up on IRQ 5 & 11. yet 3, 4, & 7 are unassigned. </s>
<s> IRQ 0 </s>
<s> You'll have to change the current thinking to get this to happen. </s>
<s> I will share that your symptom is consistent with out of date BIOS, motherboard drivers and overtaxed power supplies. </s>
<s> Usually I watch people reload the OS a few dozen times till these areas are addressed. </s>
<s> Your choice? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You need to think new thoughts..... Modern M/Bs' with PCI slots SHARE IRQs. </s>
<s> The IRQ assigment is controlled by the Operating system. </s>
<s> Open Device Manager if windows does not show any devices with conflicts then you have none ..... forget NVIDIA. </s>
<s> &quot;new card was purchased only to meet requirements of newer games&quot; This is what Bob and I are seeing.... </s>
<s> If the BIOS - M/B - drivers are not all up to date your system will not work properly with the new card. </s>
<s> &quot;After start up if I go to IE system crashes on MY MSN. </s>
<s> But not on homepage&quot; What is Home Page? </s>
<s> Any other sites affected? </s>
<s> Check, in safe mode, for spy-ware/virus. </s>
<s> &quot;Crashes mostly occur after inital start up&quot; Time element to crash? </s>
<s> What application are you using and how many? </s>
<s> Bad application install can cause system crash. </s>
<s> I don't play games, too old and slow, but from what I understand each game has its own requirments... back to drivers .... outdated drivers cause system crash. </s>
<s> CHECK M/B capactors. </s>
<s> Crowned, bulging or leaking replace M/B. </s>
<s> Recheck seating of memory and AGP card. </s>
<s> More than one memory chip?... </s>
<s> pull one stress it by playing a game then the other chip. </s>
<s> Pull new card .... same symptoms? </s>
<s> (a real streach) Bad Video card? </s>
<s> I know ... lots of questions and no true answers.... </s>
<s> But this is what troubleshooting is about. </s>
<s> Bill . </s>
<s> Replaced m/b. </s>
<s> caps were shot. </s>
<s> Good call on that one. </s>
<s> Replaced the old DFI AMD mainboard with a new MSI Pentium. </s>
<s> Doubled the CPU and RAM now everything is shiny and happy. </s>
