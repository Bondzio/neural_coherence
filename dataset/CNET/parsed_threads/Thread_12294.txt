<s> My computer has started doing something odd. </s>
<s> It doesn't load &quot;num lock&quot; on boot. </s>
<s> I have to do it manually, or not be able to use the keypad(numbers,+/*,etc) on the right hand side of the keyboard. </s>
<s> While trivial, it is irritating. </s>
<s> I have found no way to change this short of re-installing the OS. </s>
<s> It is a standard 101/102 PS/2 keyboard. </s>
<s> Is this a sign of a dying keyboard? </s>
<s> Doesn't seem likely. </s>
<s> While a dual-boot Win 98se/Mandrake 10 system, haven't been in Linux lately to see if it is doing it there. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>

<s> Been mucking about in the BIOS lately? </s>
<s> Most have a numlock on/off at bootup setting. </s>
<s> I have seen this problem before, and it has not been resolvable. </s>
<s> Some systems just don't leave it on all the time, even if the BIOS and windows are both correctly configured to leave it on. </s>
<s> Check out this article for settings Windows to leave it on, but I have found it to be enabled and Numlock still would not stay on until pressed, so it may not help. </s>

<s> Thanks, Sheila and Jeff. </s>
<s> Haven't knowingly changed num lock settings in the Bios, but anything is possible. </s>
<s> Actually, I was just wondering about that. </s>
<s> Will double-check that and go through the Microsoft info Jeff supplied. </s>

<s> It was indeed clicked off in the Bios. </s>
<s> How in h,=-=\ it got that way I don't know. </s>
<s> Not something I have ever changed. </s>
