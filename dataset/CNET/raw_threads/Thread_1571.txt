The computer boots up when the power strip is switched on(without pressing the on button). The computer runs fine after booting, but when shut down the power supply fan keeps spinning. My local computer store thinks that Acer may need a special Acer PSU. What should I try next?

It's not a nice thing to find out as the price of the repair just doubled. -&gt; Sorry but I can't give a clear reading on what's wrong. Not that I don't have ideas but I don't get to see the machine first hand. Bob
