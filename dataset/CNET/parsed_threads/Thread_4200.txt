<s> Hi, my computer is running very slow and i have very low disk space (C-drive). </s>
<s> What can i do to correct this? </s>
<s> To stay within the forum discussion of hardware, you would add more RAM and move to a larger disk. </s>
<s> However in the Computer Help or the OS Forum, they may suggest deleting old files, and streamlining the OS. </s>
<s> But since this is a hardware forum and you didn't tell what OS, I'm left with the hardware suggestions. </s>

<s> The statement &quot;computer is running very slow&quot; seems to imply that it ran faster at some earlier time. </s>
<s> Not sure that points to a RAM problem. </s>
<s> Ok excuse my stupidity, I'm not very computer literate. </s>
<s> My computer runs slow and I assumed it was connected to the ram but if I am wrong could you please suggest what I would do to enable it to run faster. </s>
<s> I gather that I must but more disk space? </s>
<s> If so how do I know which disk space I am to buy. </s>
<s> Again, sorry for my stupidity </s>

<s> HOWEVER, RAM and hard drives are not related in any way. </s>
<s> I believe that you are confusing the two. </s>
<s> Now if your computer had run adequately fast at one time, and has slowed down, the isue is much more likely to be caused by spyware, malware, viruses, trojans. </s>
<s> There are numerous posts on the subjects in these forums giving the actuions to take. </s>
<s> Just search for those related to the computer running slower. </s>

<s> Disk space IS space on the hard drive(s). </s>
<s> If they are all filled you need to replace &quot;them&quot; with a larger size hard drive. </s>
<s> We still don't know if you actually have three drives, or one drive with three partitions or two drives with one of the drives having two partitons. </s>
