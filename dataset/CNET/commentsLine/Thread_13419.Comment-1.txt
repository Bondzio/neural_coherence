i am looking at upgrading my system to either an i5 or i7.
i don' want to spend a lot of money on something i don't really need.
however i would like it to last for at least 2 to 4 years.
i do some onling gaming (but not hard core).
microsoft office suite, internet, netflix, and remote work.
i would like to reuse some if my hardware if possible (if not, oh well).
here are the specs of my current system: cpu: 2.40 gigahertz intel core2 quad q6600 motherboard: gigabyte ga-p35-ds3l memory: g-skill 4gb ddr2-800 sdram video card: ati radeon hd 5670 (1024 mb) audio card: creative sb x-fi fatality xtremegamer hard drive 1: seagate st3250310ns (250 gb, 7200 rpm, sata-ii) hard drive 2: western digital wd300glfs-01f8u0 (300 gb ide) power supply: pc power & cooling silencer mk ii 750w monitor: 42&quot; samsung led tv case: cooler master cm-690 operating system: windows xp pro i have looked at the asus p8z77-v boards and they look nice.
however do i need something like that?
any and all recomenndations will be appreciated.
