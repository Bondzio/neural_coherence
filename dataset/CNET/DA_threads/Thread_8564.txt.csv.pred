1.1.1	My brother is convinced that whether it is on a DVD player or a computer, you should never manually push the tray in, because this causes the hardware to break down faster.	St
1.1.2	He insists that I use the button to retract the tray.	St
1.1.3	I never seem to remember to do this, since gently pushing the tray retracts it just fine.	St
1.1.4	I have been doing this for years and none of my hardware has ever had a broken CD or DVD tray.	St
1.1.5	Can you please give me some ammunition in my argument with my brother to let him know that pushing the tray in is harmless?	Sug
1.1.6	Thanks!	St
1.1.7	I did search around the forums and the web and didn't find anything on this topic.	St
1.2.1	This falls into a strange place that I can't say I've yet to find any reason to give the nod one way or another.	St
1.2.2	If you've disassembled as many drives as I have, I've never found &quot;wear&quot; on these parts.	St
1.2.3	Just broken parts from accidents.	St
1.2.4	Sorry but I think this one is a personal choice.	St
1.2.5	Add to that desktop DVD recorder prices are all of 30 to 50 bucks and we aren't talking big bucks.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have been pushing the tray for years and only semi-broke one, but I think that was my fault.	St
1.3.2	They don't go in if the power is off you see.	St
1.3.3	What I really want to know is who was the dope that put the button under the open tray?	St
1.3.4	An even bigger question is why doesn't someone move it to the top?	St
1.4.1	They're built with a sensor to detect you pushing in the tray, that is why as soon as you apply some pressure to push in the tray, it powers in the tray.	St
1.4.2	So if the sensor is there, why would you think it is going to cause any harm?	St
1.5.1	I've noticed that when I often pushed the tray in for one of my PCs, the ROM drive had read/op errors after a few years.	St
1.5.2	This is just from casual observations and not a full scientific method conducted.	St
1.5.3	It's possible the drive could've done that anyways since it could've been a defect.	St
1.5.4	Also possible that my other drives that i used the button culd'v broken down anyways.	St
1.5.5	I'm thinking pushing with too much force could over time, cause the mechanical problems.	St
1.5.6	They SHOULD put the eject button in a more accessible place.	St
1.5.7	The top is not a bad idea.	St
1.5.8	Would be neat if they could integrate the button straight up on the front of the tower, like how they copied some USB ports onto the front.	St
1.6.1	In all my years I have not seen a wear-and-tear issue with drives, though I have seen a lot of abuse.	St
1.6.2	Be nice to the drive and it will be nice to you.	St
1.6.3	Just keep in mind that forcing any device with gears will surely strip them, given enough force.	St
1.6.4	The CD/DVD drive can, without harm, be gently-but-firmly pushed to start the tray withdrawal.	St
1.6.5	The hardware takes over until the drawer is closed.	St
1.6.6	I have also learned that a thirteen-pound cat, using the tray as a spring board, can wreak havoc with the mechanism...	St
1.7.1	I got my first CD drive for one $420 (!!!)	St
1.7.2	way back in about 1988 (it was a 1x speed!!!)	St
1.7.3	and since then I've had dozens of CD, and now DVD drives, and I have never seen a drive fail because I've pushed the tray in.	St
1.7.4	Keep it in mind, though, I am not forcing in the tray for the full-length, or trying to get the tray in faster than what the motor mechanism is trying to move it.	St
1.7.5	I usually just give a slight nudge to the tray and let the motor take it from there.	St
1.8.1	I'm an old IT pro and I can tell you the following: When the first CD players appeared, they came with instructions that said that you should never push the caddy, it might hurt the electric motor inside.	St
1.8.2	As I recall, the first CD-ROMs came with similar instructions.	St
1.8.3	I actually threw one of those away the other day, a stand-alone (there were no others) 1x CD-ROM for a Mac...	St
1.8.4	I still have my HP Personal Computer (their own architecture) from the beginning of the '80s.	St
1.9.1	I have replaced at least 6 cd or dvd drives.	St
1.9.2	Two of them I replaced because the automatic open/close mechanism quit.	St
1.9.3	I had been manually closing those 2 drives.	St
1.9.4	The drives were about 2 or 3 years old when I had to replace them.	St
1.9.5	When I quit pushing in the trays, the drives lasted until I replaced them (upgrades).	St
1.10.1	much less likely to run into problems by pressing the eject button too hard, granted I'm &quot;guilty&quot; of pushing the tray every now and then	St
1.11.1	Preaching to the choir here and I'm not really a church going person!	St
1.11.2	Excellent points, should be a natural for the DUH!	St
1.11.3	award!	St
1.11.4	Why does the button jam your hand with the tray because they put the button on the bottom?	St
1.11.5	Seriously, folk??!!	St
1.11.6	Anyone have a clue?	St
1.12.1	Have looked at the newer computers lately?	St
1.12.2	Some of them that i've seen have a door in front of the Roms.	St
1.12.3	Yes there is a button to open the rom.	St
1.12.4	But to close the tray you have no choice but to push the tray.	St
1.12.5	The door that opened covers the button from the bottom.	St
1.12.6	It's mechanical and they will wear out like anything else so I keep spares as a back up.	St
1.13.1	I've always suggested that users use the button or s/w cmds.	St
1.13.2	to open/close the tray.	St
1.13.3	Yes, you can manually close the tray, however when kids are involved, things can get hairy.	St
1.13.4	Those trays that have broken usually have cracked gears or gear strips being off track and/or simply broken.	St
1.13.5	Under normal wear&tear, that just doesn't happen unless by manual force.	St
1.13.6	It seems that some CD drives are cheaply made it *may* introduced a greater number of failures, but that's my opinion.	St
1.13.7	Of course you do what's needed, but if it happens on your watch, guess who gets the blame.	St
1.13.8	tada -----Willy	St
1.14.1	That's a bunch of poppycock!	St
1.14.2	I've been pushing my 3 different (HP) computer CD Roms in since 2000 and haven't broken or wore one out yet.	St
1.14.3	On this latest machine, I even jammed the CD in the tray a couple of times (through carelessness) and pulled it back to retrieve the CD and it STILL works fine!	St
1.14.4	By the way, an HP computer has the button on the side next to the tray.	St
1.15.1	The poor 5VDC motor drive belt in your CD drive and its logic card get an unneeded and uncalled for jolt when you give an open tray a push or shove to load your CD in.	St
1.15.2	All you need to do is to press the adjacent button in your right hand below the tray.	Ques
1.15.3	I avoid doing that too and simply use my mouse to right click the load and eject options from the CD drive icon in the My Computer dialog box, to avoid smudges from my fingertips.	St
1.15.4	Pushing and shoving people around shows negative etiquettes.	St
1.15.5	Whether you choose to use people or electronic goods.	St
1.15.6	Be gentle.	St
1.16.1	The tray eject mechanism is operated by a small motor and plastic gears (and occasionally a rubber belt).	St
1.16.2	The motor operates at a significant gear ratio advantage, and there normally is very little stress on these parts.	St
1.16.3	However, when one pushes on the tray, the situation is reversed and the unpowered motor is forced to turn through a gear DISadvantage.	St
1.16.4	If done gently so the motor has an opportunity to accelerate slowly, it can work out okay; but if done more abruptly, the inertia of the motor prevents it from starting instantly and it's relatively easy to crack a gear or shuck off a tooth.	St
1.16.5	Sure, it usually doesn't happen, but it is a higher-stress mechanical situation that I choose to avoid.	St
1.17.1	NIL	St
1.18.1	Hi, I believe the button is always on the bottom for mechanical reasons, since the button directly activates the traction mechanism.	St
1.18.2	space probably limits options to the most simple that is possible.	St
1.18.3	If it were electrically activated then, of course the button could be anywhere.	St
1.19.1	I've probably pushed my computer's cd-rom drive over 1000 times and still do not notice any problems.	St
1.19.2	Any ideas out there how many pushes I have left?	St
1.19.3	Also, does anyone know how many times you can push the small open/close button before the electric motor that opens and closes the cd-rom drive fails?	Ques
1.19.4	I'd really love to here from an engineer who designs these parts, but for the rest of you please don't hold back your creative opinions.	St
1.20.1	... to be opened with the button, and to be closed with a slight push.	St
1.20.2	If that's not so, neither action would work.	St
1.20.3	OK- you can close with the button also, but that is provided for the benefit of users who want to do it that way.	St
1.20.4	They have to be quick, as otherwise, their fingers may be caught by the closing tray.	St
