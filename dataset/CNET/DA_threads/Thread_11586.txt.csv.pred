1.1.1	When i insert some discs into my optical drive , they do n't show up in finder , and wo n't play in DVD player .	St
1.1.2	i looked in my disc utilities , and it sees the dvd there .	St
1.1.3	I can play the dvd in VLC player , but i ca n't access it in other programs .	St
1.1.4	the same problem is happening with some data dvds i 've burned , however , some still work .	St
1.1.5	Any clue what 's going on ?	Ques
1.2.1	Open your System Preferences ( either from the pull-down menu under the Apple icon in the far upper-left or from your Dock ) , then under Hardware there is a & quot ; CD & DVD & quot ; button .	St
1.2.2	Click that , then you can choose what you want your computer to do when you insert a disc .	St
1.2.3	It may have & quot ; Ignore & quot ; chosen as the default .	St
1.2.4	You can choose any application you want to open ( like DVD Player ) or to have the disc icon just show up n the Finder when you insert it .	St
1.3.1	how did you burn them ?	Ques
1.3.2	Straight from the Finder or with a utility like Toast ?	Ques
1.3.3	Same question for the DVD 's .	St
1.3.4	Commercial DVD 's ( test the player with these ) or movies that have been burned as backups ?	Ques
1.3.5	P	St
1.4.1	I tried , did n't help .	St
1.4.2	any other suggestion ?	Ques
1.5.1	The data disks were burnt using finder .	St
1.5.2	Just drag and dropped .	St
1.5.3	The Movie disks were both ones i 've purchased , and back ups i made .	St
1.5.4	The back ups were made with toast 8 .	St
1.5.5	I lookes like they show up in toast .	St
1.6.1	& quot ; drag and dropped. & quot ; has always caused issues like this .	St
1.6.2	For DVDs and many other things I always find closed SINGLE SESSION recordings to work best .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	You are saying that commercial DVD 's do not mount or play on your computer ?	Ques
1.7.2	Is that correct ?	Ques
1.7.3	You then say that you can play these DVD 's using VLC .	St
1.7.4	Do you have another Optical Drive that you are using to play those DVD 's ?	Ques
1.7.5	You have not told us what Mac you have , how old it is or what OS you are running on it , but it could be that something is not quite right in the ( software ) state of Denmark .	St
1.7.6	I know this is old , but , run the Disk Utility and Repair Permissions on that drive .	St
1.7.7	Did it make any difference ?	Ques
1.7.8	Another interesting thing is that you say that the disks that do not mount , appear in Toast .	St
1.7.9	How so ?	Ques
1.7.10	If the disk does not mount on the desktop , if is unlikely to appear in Toast .	St
1.7.11	Maybe not impossible , but unlikely .	St
1.7.12	As Bob mentioned , Drag and Drop can be problematical , on either platform , with mixed results for any given burn .	St
1.7.13	Toast , on a Mac , is the preferred method of burning .	St
1.7.14	Make sure that you have the Recorder Settings & gt ; Advanced ; set to & quot ; Write Disk & quot ; and not & quot ; Write Session & quot ; .	St
1.7.15	This is another problematic area with the Mac .	St
1.7.16	Most times it will work correctly but when you most need the data , it will not .	St
1.7.17	BTW , Session written disks appear as separate volumes on the desktop .	St
1.7.18	Anyway , there 's a few questions , look forward to the answers .	St
1.7.19	P	St
1.8.1	Sorry i did n't mention that stuff .	St
1.8.2	I have an iBook G4 running OSX 10.4.9 Commercial DVDs do not show up on the desk top , and they will not play in Apple DVD player .	St
1.8.3	However , using the same optical drive , i can play the movie in VLC player .	St
1.8.4	when i open toast 8 , and select copy disc , it says & quot ; Copy summary : & lt ; no volume & gt ; & quot ; and then has the size of the dvd under it .	St
1.8.5	this one being & quot ; 7.46 GB & quot ; When i went into disc utility and click on that drive , Repairing disc permissions is grayed out .	St
1.8.6	Should i try with a data dvd ?	Ques
1.8.7	this on is a commerial dvd .	St
1.9.1	What make/model/firmware version is that DVD drive ?	Ques
1.9.2	I vaguely recall this when the drive was not blessed by Apple .	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	the DVD drive is a MATSHITADVD-R UJ-845E .	St
1.10.2	It 's the same one that came in the ibook .	St
1.11.1	I remembered it mattered .	St
1.12.1	I 'm not sure as to how to find that information .	St
1.12.2	Please let me know .	Sug
1.13.1	By the way , being an owner of Toast and other great Roxio products , I can tell you that Toast will not copy a commercial DVD .	St
1.13.2	Toast may recognize it and load it for playback , but it wo n't copy it ... unless you can tell me different .	St
1.13.3	You need to use a DVD rip program first before using Toast , but that 's a whole other post discussion .	St
1.13.4	When you go to System Preferences as you say you did , what option did you choose for when you insert a DVD ?	Ques
1.13.5	Is & quot ; Launch DVD Player & quot ; chosen ?	Ques
1.14.1	DVD are supposed to open DVD player .	St
1.14.2	Yeah , i did n't use toast to rip the dvds , just to compress them and burn them .	St
1.15.1	After you insert a DVD , try double-clicking on your HD icon on the desktop .	St
1.15.2	The window that is now open should show you along the left side , every device or disc that is mounted .	St
1.15.3	Does a DVD show up there ?	Ques
1.15.4	Also , try launching DVD Player first , then & quot ; Open & quot ; a disc from the pull-down menu to see if the player will 'see & quot ; the disc .	St
1.15.5	I got ta tell you , I 've never come across a Mac with this problem .	St
1.15.6	I 'm stumped .	St
1.15.7	Maybe one of the experts , like mrmacfixit , can figure it out .	St
1.16.1	No , the DVD is n't showing up in the side bar when i open up the Mac HD on my desk top .	St
1.16.2	i guess it 's not mounting properly for some reason .	St
1.16.3	I 'm usually pretty good at figuring out what 's wrong with a computer when it is n't working properly .	St
1.16.4	i was thinking i might try reinstalling OSX , but i do n't like that because then i have to reinstall all the programs and updates i have .	St
1.17.1	Now these may or may not & quot ; just play. & quot ; There are too many gotchas in this area so I do n't expect this to work using the method you noted .	St
1.17.2	VLCPLAYER will be more forgiving as to playback .	St
1.17.3	Bob	St
1.18.1	reasons why this DVD player is not working , I guess it is time to try something else .	St
1.18.2	At this point I would go with an Archive and Install and see if that fixes the problem .	St
1.18.3	I note that the poster has considered this but turned it down because of the updates .	St
1.18.4	Not a really good excuse not to do it as the OS updates are automatic and do n't require baby sitting .	St
1.18.5	Most of what has been written about this does seem to point toward a software problem .	St
1.18.6	It 's worth a try , only takes 20 minutes or so and all your data remains intact .	St
1.18.7	P	St
1.19.1	Can I ask why you installed VLC Player ?	Ques
1.19.2	This is a cross-platform media player that for the most part , is not even needed on the Mac .	St
1.19.3	Did you by chance download a PC version of this program ?	Ques
1.19.4	It may be possible that VLC Player has been set to override every other program and become the default video player .	St
1.19.5	Why not delete this and see what happens ?	Ques
1.19.6	( Back it up just in case . )	St
1.19.7	Unfortunately there have been too many PC people who gravitate to the Mac and they download a lot of crap that they do n't need , but they do it because it was required on a PC and they are determined to try and operate the Mac like the PC .	St
1.19.8	Scrape your Mac clean ( backup and do a fresh reinstall of software as the boss here recommended ) and start with a clean slate .	St
1.20.1	Does Archive and Install delete other files that might be on my desktop or in my Picture or Music file ?	Ques
1.20.2	I 've never done this before and do n't want to lose anything .	St
1.21.1	I 've never needed to do it , so I ca n't really tell you how it 's done .	St
1.21.2	When I reformatted my old computer I saved picture and document files to either a CD , DVD or external HD , then I use the original System Disc to do a clean install , which gets you back to square one .	St
1.21.3	If you 've downloaded programs , make a list of the serial numbers or registration numbers for each program , then re-downloading them should be easy , and simply add the registration number to get the proper access .	St
1.21.4	Sometimes the websites where you download and purchase programs keep your registration numbers .	St
1.22.1	As its name implies , the version of a System install archives various settings and files before replacing the actual system .	St
1.22.2	Anything in your Home folder , this includes the desktop but why not put the files inside the Home folder , is saved and put back where it was before the install .	St
1.22.3	All the iLife suite stuff , photo 's , music , movies and the like are all preserved .	St
1.22.4	Any applications that you installed , other than those that came with OS X , are left intact in the Applications folder .	St
1.22.5	Network settings , email , Bookmarks , are all saved and reapplied on completion .	St
1.22.6	Boot from the installation/restore DVD , whichever is the newer , and step S L O W L Y through the initial steps .	St
1.22.7	You should be presented with a warning about not being able to install unless you change your installation options .	St
1.22.8	Change the option to Archive and Install .	St
1.22.9	( Do NOT proceed unless you have done this ) Loss of ALL data can result from a FORMAT and Install .	St
1.22.10	On completion , you will reboot and then try the DVD player .	St
1.22.11	The system will need updating via the Software Updater to bring it up to the current version of your OS .	St
1.22.12	BTW , the Windows version of VLC will not run on a Mac .	St
1.22.13	I have it on my machine , as do many others , for those video files that QuickTime can not play .	St
1.22.14	Good luck P	Polite
1.23.1	so the archive install worked .	St
1.23.2	not much problem with it .	St
1.23.3	photoshop is kind of wonky , and i 'll have to reinstall it , but otherwise everything a-ok. thank you guys so much for your help .	St
1.23.4	you 're really saved me on this one .	St
1.24.1	just pointed you in the right direction .	St
1.24.2	You may find a couple of & quot ; wonky & quot ; programs , usually Adobe products , that will need & quot ; Repair & quot ; .	St
1.24.3	I had the same problem with Photoshop Elements .	St
1.24.4	Enjoy the movies !	St
1.24.5	P	St
1.25.1	Yeah , photoshop wants some repairs .	St
1.25.2	but that 's no problem .	St
1.25.3	thanks again .	Polite
