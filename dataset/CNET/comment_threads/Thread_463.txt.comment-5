When the heatsink comes with the paste on it, it was put there by a manufacturing process that knows EXACTLY where the CPU will mate with the heatsink.
[extremely important for the AMD's, but also for the Intels., especially when using thermal paste that is also electrically conductive.]
Study the assembly of the two and you will see that the CPU is NOT in the center of the heatsink due to the fact that the heatsink also covers the part of the CPU socket that has nothing on it.
This is to allow the clamping system that they use to apply a uniform force across the surface.
The AMD's have four spacers to prevent crushing the small CPU.
The Intel heat spreader gives a larger surface.
In fact there have been cases where the HSF was put on backwards on AMD CPU,s and only touched part of the CPU and the CPU overtemped fast.
With the Intel's the heat spreader makes this less of a problem.
