<s> Okay for the last 2 days I have been trying to switch my primary monitor over to my Radeon X1550 Graphics Card, the problem is in display settings when i click the box for &quot;Make Primary Monitor&quot; and i hit apply the screen flashes and come back with nothing changed the box is no longer checked. </s>
<s> This has happened on both Vista and XP. </s>
<s> I am currently using vista. </s>
<s> Its a brand new hard drive and was just recently formatted to vista/xp/vista again, before on my old harddrive after installing a new graphics card it stopped letting me change the primary driver, i am on a old Dell Optiplex and this is the computer i wish to fix. </s>
<s> Okay now for what i have done. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;I have updated all drivers for the graphics card. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;I Have updated Vista to Service pack 2 (before hand it the graphics card wouldn't work properly or install) &gt;&gt;I have disabled the old Intel graphics which did work and switched the radeon to be the primary monitor but it had the old intel on extended and when i tried to removed that option on the intel it all reverted and stayed on the intell port saying the default monitor was on radeon. </s>
<s> (the monitor was still plugged into the original monitor plug in) &gt;&gt;Yes the card still works, I am allowed to set it to extended desktop but not switch it to my primary monitor. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;Yes it has the option to be the primary monitor as i have done it before on this very computer and on another computer that has vista installed. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;Yes i have looked through google but cannot find an answer to help me. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;Yes both the card and computer are cleaned out of dust. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;Yes i have switched monitors and the other one didn't change anything. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;No I am not interested in buying a new card/computer upgrading this one as i plan to purchase a new computer as soon as i can and keep this one with the card and all parts intact. </s>
<s> Thats all i can currently remember and i can't think of anything else to try aside from calling dell which they rarely can help Thanks in Advance. </s>
<s> I saw no mention of motherboard drivers or if the BIOS primary display was looked at. </s>
<s> Also, don't we use the extend my desktop before we play with primary/secondary? </s>
