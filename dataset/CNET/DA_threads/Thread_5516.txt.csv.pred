1.1.1	Hello !	St
1.1.2	I recently bought a Toshiba Libretto 100ct operating on Windows 98se , and included with it was an external floppy drive ( PCMCIA connecter ) .	St
1.1.3	After I plug it in and try and open up a floppy from [ my computer ; drive a : ] , it says & quot ; A : / is not accessible , the device is not ready & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	Now , after a little research I found out that there is no driver installed so the only way to get files off the floppy is to do a file copy from MS-DOS mode .	St
1.1.5	It tells me to switch in msdos mode to A : , but when I do this it can not read drive A : ... For this reason , I do not believe that this external floppy drive is considered as drive A : , but do not know what a PCMCIA card command is and how to move files from the floppy to the computer itself .	St
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Some more additional info ...	St
1.2.2	If I go into system then hardware profiles , it says something to the extent of & quot ; Drive A is using MS-DOS compatibility mode file system & quot ; , but wo n't let me open drive a : in ms-dos mode .	St
1.2.3	This is why I think that an external FDD ( PCMCIA ) is not considered as a drive .	St
1.3.1	You 've shot past the decade mark on the hardware so are firmly into & quot ; computer pre-history. & quot ; Your best bet is to ask the former owner for some tips as well as use google.com Bob	St
