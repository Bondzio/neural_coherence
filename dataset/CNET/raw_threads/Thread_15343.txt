Easily done through software, and less guesswork. But how much OCing would be good? Unitl you get artifacts? Is it likely for GPUs to burn out because of overclocking? What about the ram? What happenes with that?

Expect, that at some point it will break down, so find the happy medium and live with it. As with a cpu, you will shorten the life span of a gpu if OC'ed. All the cooling cures should be taken beforehand and tweak bit by bit. enjoy -----Willy
