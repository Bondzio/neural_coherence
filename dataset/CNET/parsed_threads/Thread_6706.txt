<s> I have a wireless modem/router downstairs and will be putting a desktop PC upstairs. </s>
<s> I was wondering what would be better: a Wireless Access Point or a Wireless Desktop Card. </s>
<s> I do have one free PCI expansion slot for the Card. </s>
<s> However, I was wondering if one was better than the other when it comes to speed, coverage (distance from router), etc. </s>
<s> Anyone have any thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> to communicate with the router, without such no wireless connection is possible. </s>
<s> A WAP is used to add wireless capapbilities to an area. </s>
<s> Two different functions. </s>
<s> Ah, I understand. </s>
<s> For some reason I thought a WAP received a wireless signal (from, lets say another wireless item, like my router). </s>
<s> I did not realize a WAP actually creates (pushes) a wireless signal out from a wired network. </s>
