i play the sims2 a lot.
i started with the base game, 256mb ram, and an on-board video card with 64mb shared.
the base game was not too bad, but it took a player a while to cross a room.
when the expansion packs started coming out, i crashed lift, right, and center, until i added a 1gb stick to my computer.
what a difference in speed, until the game ate up all of my cpu resources, so i knew it was time for an independent video card.
i went to the website for the sims2, and printed out their requirements.
i then ran the direct-x to see what i actually had.
i took both papers into the place that custom-builds my computers for me, showed them the list, and told them how much money i had to spend.
i walked out with an ati radeon 9250, with 128 mb of ram, and the game runs very smooth, and i can actually see blades of grass, fine patterns on furniture, and actual patterns on wallpaper.
total cost for the 1gb ram=$70.00 cdn; video card was $40.00 cdn.
soon, for the next ep (seasons), i will need a better processor; mine is 1.2 ghtz, which is 0.2 ghtz over the latest ep (pets), so that is when i will fall into trouble.
good luck.
