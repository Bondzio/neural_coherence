<s> Hello I'm going to build my own gamer PC for the first time. </s>
<s> I have a list of the hardware I'm going to buy. </s>
<s> - Graphics card: GeForce GTX 580 - CPU: Core i7-950 - Motherboard: ASUS Rampage Extreme III Republic of Gamers - RAM: 2 x 6 GB Kingston HyperX - Hard Drive: Hitachi Deskstar 7K2000 - Blue-ray: BH10LS30 Super Multi Blue - Power Supply: Corsair TX650W It would be nice if you could make some comments about what you thought about it and may also make some suggestions on what else I can buy but it should not be much more expensive than what I've already selected. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> - I've heard Antec Performance cases (for ex. </s>
<s> the sx630II) are good because they have built in filters to catch all the dust and it never gets in ur machine. </s>
<s> Idk if you already have a case or not. </s>
<s> - Make sure you have a couple fans since that is gonna generate alot of heat. </s>
<s> - That is an excessive amount of RAM unless youre using your computer as a server. </s>
<s> Nothing wrong with it but it would save you alot of money to drop to one 6Gb stick. </s>
<s> 4Gb is sufficient for almost all games right now. </s>
<s> - I prefer Western Digital hard drives for myself. </s>
<s> If ur looking for speed maybe check out one at 10000RPM's instead of 7200 - And hopefully youll be using Windows 7 on a machine like that. </s>
<s> One thing you may want to look into is a liquid cooling system. </s>
<s> They are not much $ these days and can help keep your system cool. </s>
<s> You may want to look at http://www.frozencpu.com They have all kind of gaming ideas. </s>
<s> I too like Western Digital HDD. </s>
<s> If you look into them stick with the &quot;BLACK&quot; since they are built better, run cooler and have better warranties than the green or blue. </s>
<s> Cost a little more but are worth it. </s>
<s> You might want to recheck that ram. </s>
<s> I'm getting the impression this mobo uses tri-channel. </s>
<s> 4GB per slot limit and maybe 2GB per slot limit depending on speed. </s>
<s> I'll let you dig into that. </s>
