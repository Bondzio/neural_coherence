I had the same problem - IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad laptop T60 with touch pad and Synaptics driver that came bundled in WinXP SP2 installation.
The suggestion of Ray Williams didn't help, but hey - it seems it's a problem of the Synaptic driver, so maybe the newer version of the driver fixes that.
I don't like the &quot;UltraNav&quot; extra features that have to be installed with the driver from IBM/Lenovo website, so I have updated my Synaptics driver directly from the Synaptics homepage ( http://www.synaptics.com/support/drive.cfm ) and hurray - problem solved.
The driver I'm currently using causes no scrolling trouble.
The version of this driver is v8.3.4 19May06.
Hope this helps someone who's still looking for solution.
