I brought a new Laptop HP dv6.
the problem is the printer I am using, it is on a home network and was running fine.
Now it is real slow and it prints pages with one or two lines or nothing at all.
I talked to HP before I even got the laptop and they said it was vista ready.
The printer is not even a year old.
It is a Photosmart 7200 All in One.
I am wasting paper like water.
Help
