<s> I reinstalled Windows Xp on a computer w/ 2 drives. </s>
<s> I took one out for the reinstall and after it was up and running I plugged the other back in and swapped the files out of the second to the main drive so thatit could be repartitioned all partitions on both drives become unaccesable. </s>
<s> Reran the install from CD and still it only seen the 5meg that the system keeps. </s>
<s> It was a 60 gig. </s>
<s> Anybody have any idea why this happened? </s>
<s> I got the files back by hooking the drive to another set up and useing a program called partition find and mount. </s>
<s> It is a excelent free program </s>
<s> or one from a Big Box Mfg ? </s>
<s> it's system max box running a amd 200xp processor, not sure about the version of win it was on a burnt cd. </s>
<s> I'mmthinking that the cd is corupt or something. </s>
<s> I had both drives in my box last night and for some reason the one 60 only shows 33 gig and the other one wont let me install anything on it. </s>
<s> I'm at a loss right now. </s>
