they had connected the drive to usb 1.1 ports and the usb case only worked fully on usb 2.0 ports.
another forum member had moved a drive with data into the usb case and the contents vanished.
put it back in a pc and there it was again.
lesson?
you must prepare said drive in the usb case.
use the disk management tool.
