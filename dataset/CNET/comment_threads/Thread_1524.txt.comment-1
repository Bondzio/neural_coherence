I have two PC's, one desktop and one laptop, they work fine together when they are using the Internet, but when I go online with my PS3, and the laptop connects, the PS3 disconnects, I'm thinking about the Port Forwarding feature, but I don't know how to use it, I connect to the router wired with the PS3 and wirelessly with the laptop, so why.
I use the Netgear WGR614 v6 Router, updated to the latest firmware.
I just can't think of anyway around this other than Port Forwarding, someone help.
