you can get peripheral component interconnect (pci) video cards for desktop machines (if thats what ur using)which has its own ram seperate from the motherboard giving you more memory to your machine.
if it's a desktop however.
im not sure.
you may be able to get a pc card for video.
so it might be worth getting a pci card for your desktop
