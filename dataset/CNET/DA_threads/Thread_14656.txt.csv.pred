1.1.1	I presently have a normal home network using cables.	St
1.1.2	My most modern desktop is attached to the internet via a local Dial-up connection.	St
1.1.3	I have another desktop and a laptop hooked up the the dial up through a Windows XP network.	St
1.1.4	I am interested in going wireless with my home network and not yet going DSL or Cable with the internet.	St
1.1.5	Is this possible?	St
1.1.6	I think I just need to replace my 10/100 network cards with wireless and I can run the network the same way through Win XP.	St
1.1.7	Also, would I be able to use my laptop to hookup through hot spots?	St
1.2.1	If you have ICS up and working proper, and you have a LAN, then all I would need to do is plug in something like a WAP11.	St
1.2.2	There are MANY models like this, so here's a link to give you a starting point -&gt; http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=22&prid=429 Then for the clients, you put client WiFi cards in... Bob	St
1.3.1	Couldn't I just replace my NIC cards with wireless Network cards?	St
1.3.2	Then and I can run the network the exact same way as I do now through Win XP Network with Microsoft ICS.	St
1.3.3	I don't have any wireless cards now, so the WAP11 would not be of any use.	St
1.3.4	I am new so if this is a stupid question, please dumb down your answer.	St
1.3.5	Thank You, Dennis	St
1.4.1	The WAP11 is the WiFi access point.	St
1.4.2	Once you have ICS working on your LAN, you simply plug that into your LAN.	St
1.4.3	The clients get WiFi cards and communicate to the WAP.	St
1.4.4	No changes to your ICS or LAN would be required.	St
1.4.5	Just plug in the WAP, follow it's included instructions and then add WiFi clients.	St
1.4.6	Since ADHOC mode will be very cumbersome, I'll excuse myself from that lengthy discussion.	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	Before you buy a bunch of wireless network cards you better test it out, wireless is a real disappointment to many people, it just doesn't work that well, and many places can't get wireless working over a whole house, much less to the next room down the hall, you never know how it will work until you try.	St
1.5.2	I have had to wire a few places that expected to be able to go wireless, and could not.	St
