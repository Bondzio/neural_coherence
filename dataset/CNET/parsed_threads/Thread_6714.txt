<s> Though they are sending packets none are being recived. </s>
<s> I really do now know what I need to do, this is driving me mad....as such I would appreciate any help or guidance. </s>
<s> Many thanks </s>
<s> Has this configuration ever worked? </s>
<s> What type of Internet connection? </s>
<s> Spyware and Virus free? </s>
<s> The possibilities are endless. </s>
<s> No spyware running....OS is XP...Broadband internet with ethernet adaptor on main PC. </s>
<s> All systmes see it but none are receeving packets. </s>
<s> I have disabled the firewall as well....not sure to be honest. </s>
<s> Shame my PC did not come with a ONE BUTTON FIX all ! </s>
<s> require you to enter the user name and password from the ISP into the routers setup page. </s>

<s> So without more information being given, only guesses can be made. </s>
<s> Does the Internet work when connecting the modem directlt to a PC? </s>
