if you're hearing squeeking from a hd, it's not scraping from the surface.
hd platter surfaces are extremly sensitive, if the heads crashed on a platter it'd likely ruin the entire drive.
to check a drive, right-click the drive icon, click on properties, then on the tools tab.
click on error checking to test for bad sectors and other problems.
as you now know, there's more extensive checking programs, but you were concernend about surface damage and this'll check for that.
