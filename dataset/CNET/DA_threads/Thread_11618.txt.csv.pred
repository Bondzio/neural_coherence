1.1.1	Hello, Today I got my 7.1 usb external sound card from Startech ( http://eu.startech.com/product/ICUSBAUDIO7D-USB-7-Channel-Audio-Adapter-with-SPDIF ).	St
1.1.2	The S/PDIF out works like a charm, but when I plug my Roccat Kave 5.1 headset in, I only get 2.1 sound (front speakers).	St
1.1.3	I cannot get the other speakers to work.I installed the driver from the cd I got with the sound card.&lt;div&gt; How could I get it to produce 5.1 sound instead of just 2.1?	St
1.1.4	Computer specs:&lt;div&gt;Laptop with Windows 7 Home premium 64-bit Intel i7 2Ghz, 6Gb ram &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Thank you in advance	St
1.2.1	But 99% of the time I find folk playing stereo content.	St
1.2.2	I wonder.	St
1.3.1	I know this forum is hold but I had the same problem and i just noticed that there a little tray icon in the bottom of the screen that have a form of a music note Double Click on it &gt; Main Setting (first tab) &gt; Ouput Mode Section &gt; AnalogOutput Section &gt; You can choose the number of speakers.	St
1.3.2	&gt; (headphones - 4 - 6 - 7.1) Click OK It worked for me.	St
1.3.3	Seems like even if windows is telling the soundcard to have its sound in 7.1, it doesnt override the custom software of startech... (USB MultiChannel AudioDevice) And That's it.	St
1.3.4	Enjoy	St
