I have never had a problem with buying DVD discs until now. For how long I have had this drive I have not noticed that not every DVD disc is compatible I guess it was just luck I was buying the right type all this time. Anyway I got myself a pack of sony DVD-R 120min/4.7gb 16x/1x dvd discs to burn some stuff and the DVD dont work with my burning software Nero 7 and Ashampoo Burning Studio 6. I really dont understand why they dont work when I have used other brands but the same type of discs before like: EMTEC DVD-R 4.7gb 120min and Datawrite 8x DVD-R 4.7gb. This has only made confusion on the quest to find out what discs to buy in the future. Well the question to you nice people is: What type of DVD discs are compatible with my NEC ND-3500A? e.g. DVD+R What is the difference between DVD-R and DVD+R? What are the ''good'' brand names of DVDs? Thanks for reading my topic.

So Should I be using DVD-R or DVD+R? I found this site telling me recommended media: http://www.sw.nec.co.jp/products/optical/en/ND-3500A/3500Amedia_list_21A.html DVD+R DL(Double Layer) Media & brands! If anyone out there can recommended discs for NEC ND-3500A please do. Thank you.
