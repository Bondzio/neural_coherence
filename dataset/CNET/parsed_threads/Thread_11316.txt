<s> I live in a large two story house with an upstairs office at one end of the house and a downstairs office at the opposite end. </s>
<s> The cable enters the house on the second floor and I have used a DI D-link connected to the cable modem to transmit a signal to the downstairs office for a second computer. </s>
<s> When I started frequent dropped signals downstairs I installed a Netgear in the wall plugs near the cable modem connecting to the downstairs. </s>
<s> That seemed to help but I later added a much longer aerial extender to the D-Link wireless router. </s>
<s> I have decided to get an up to date wireless router to see if I can stop the dropped connections. </s>
<s> I need advice on which one to buy for consistency of connection over a large area of the house. </s>

<s> It is unlikely you will see much difference. </s>
<s> Most routers transmit at the maximum legal power. </s>
<s> You have already tried the larger antenna trick which is pretty much the only option to manipulate the signal. </s>
<s> You &quot;may?&quot; see better performance if you move all your equipment to N rather than G but its more because N is more tolerant of interference that G the transmit power is exactly the same. </s>
<s> If you already run N then the brand of router will not make a difference. </s>
<s> If you have not tried it you can move one of your antenna parallel to the ceiling/floor. </s>
<s> Router antenna are generally designed to transmit the signal horizontally and not up and down. </s>
<s> Maybe you get lucky but floors/ceiling eat a lot more signal than walls do. </s>
<s> If I read that you have used the Ethernet over powerline and place a second wireless AP on the end that is one of the more common solutions to this problem. </s>
<s> Wireless drops are a fact of life and you just have to live with them if you want to use wireless. </s>
<s> It all comes down to interference that you can do little about </s>
<s> Thanks bill012 I have not tried the pointing of the long antenna yet. </s>
<s> Another comment was to make sure that I did not have a &quot;flakey&quot; internet card in the receiving computer downstairs. </s>
<s> I will let you know what I finally do and if it makes any difference at all. </s>
