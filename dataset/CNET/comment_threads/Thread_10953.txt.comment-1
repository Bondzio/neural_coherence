After installing and uninstalling a hard drive, and installing a 56k modem, whenever I boot up the pc I get the message - &quot;COM A configuration changed&quot;, then the option to press F1 to resume or F10 to enter set-up.
Everything looks fine in the settings, I have even tried resetting defaults.
PC works fine when resuming, but the boot process stops until F1 or F10 is pressed.
I installed the 2nd hard drive to move from old PC (P90 Dell) to the Compaq.
PC is a Compaq Presario 4528, 233 mgH, 32 mg RAM, 3 gig hard drive, Win95 platform.
Thanks for any help someone can provide.
