I read your post twice and can't tell if this is that age old XP and SATA drive issue or 'I forgot how to use disk management.'
The device manager may not show SATA drives in XP!
What is it?
Not a word about the machine, drives, make, model and more and then we have the BIG ISSUE.
What's that.
7 is beta.
You try that on machines you can wipe out and start over.
Why not do that?
