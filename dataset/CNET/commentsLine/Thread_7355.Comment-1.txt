i'm planning on purchasing a new desktop.
i've always had custom made pc's in the past (for gaming etc).
i'm now past that stage but i still want quality and speed.
i plan on basic cable internet surfing/photo and movie edits, multi task etc.
(no tv turner).
i probably will get a dell or hp with vista home premium.
my question...to avoid hour glass should i get 2 meg ram and forget about video card/ get 1 meg ram and a video card/ or go for it and get 2 meg ram and video card?
i'm not getting a new monitor but would like to stay in the $1,200 price range.
any advice?
