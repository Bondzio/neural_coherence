when i started to install the software on the laptop, it asks how i am connecting the printer.
the options are usb and lan.
i'm assuming if i go with option 1 that you suggested, i would use usb, but would that allow me to print wirelessly from the laptop.
is it necessary to set up both computers on a network?
thanks
