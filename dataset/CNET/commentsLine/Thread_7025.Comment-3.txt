yes, you can upgrade your audio and video on an integrated motherboard.
it is very easy to make those changes in the bios set up on your motherboard.
i purchased an integrated motherboard recently and didn't like the on board sound, so i disabled it and i am using a sound blaster live card, which takes up one pci slot.
the same thing can be accomplished with your on board video.
