<s> I have to maintain a LAN between two buildings of 500 mtrs. </s>
<s> distance.Almost 50 PCS are connected as clients.My problem is that sometimes network disconnected.Network is done by hubs, switches and cat5 cables and partially ( from one building to other) through optical cable.I don't get the server by pinging to the IP address of it. </s>
<s> Is there any other way to find out the fault or to check the networking at the time of fault.Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Maybe 2 systems so they plug in the other socket? </s>
<s> There are network monitor tools we find on google, so I won't write about that. </s>
<s> However what I find in the field is that when a person finds a failed hub they cycle the power and the hub starts working. </s>
<s> They miss the clue that the hub/switch is defective and end up doing a lot more support than needed. </s>
<s> Maybe it's their choice since replacing the bad hardware would mean less work for them. </s>
