1.1.1	I need help to find an inkjet printer that does borderless on regular documents not only photos, (I am making fliers in CorelDraw 11 that I need to print borderless) can handle heavy cardstock, give me an excellent quality on text as well as photo, preferably envelopes also.	St
1.1.2	I have read a lot of reviews here on cnet.com and no printer stands out that much.	St
1.1.3	I need it for a small office with a farely high volume of printing.	St
1.2.1	would be to contact the sales dept.	St
1.2.2	of the major vendors.	St
1.2.3	They are best qualified to recommend a printer for your specific needs.	St
1.2.4	This way you'll have several to choose from.	St
1.2.5	and life goes on... Jack	St
