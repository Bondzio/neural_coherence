<s> I'm living temporarily in an apartment complex where one of my neighbors has thoughtfully installed an open WiFi access point, which I am happy to use. </s>
<s> But it doesn't work all the time. </s>
<s> Sometimes it's fine, and sometimes there's no signal at all. </s>
<s> (But even if I get no reception in my apartment, I know the transmitter is on because if I take my laptop down the hall, it picks up the neighbor's signal loud and clear.) </s>
<s> Is there a stronger *receiving* antenna that I can install in my apartment so I can always pick up the neighbor's signal? </s>
<s> All the repeaters and extenders I see advertised seem to apply to the sender's location. </s>
<s> What, if anything, can I do as the receiver? </s>
<s> did you really think we'd help you steal your neighbor's internet access? </s>

<s> Call them and ask them to reboot their access point or turn it back on. </s>

<s> Please research that option a bit more. </s>
<s> Also, you can construct a parabolic reflector from kitchen materials (I've done this at a party and at first they thought I was nuts, but afterwards they certified me... as what I was never quite sure) The dragonfly at http://www.usbwifi.orcon.net.nz/dragnfly.jpg is some trick. </s>
