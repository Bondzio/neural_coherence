I Networked them and the only thing that is shared should be the shared documents folder (which I can see). One of the computers has the printer shared to the laptop when i go to print and i am not sure why since I did not share it. Is it because there are multiple users for that computer (ex, mom, dad, kids)?

Do you mean that you can print from the other computers even though you hav not shared the printer?

When I set up the desktop (fresh install of xp home) I didn't share anything but the Shared Documents folder so I am confused how the printer can be shared.

Proffitt	2/17/04 8:42 AM	1.07700732E12	A little note about the &quot;Network Neighborhood.&quot;	First a word from Microsoft about the &quot;Network Neighborhood&quot; or NN for short. &quot;Note If a computer is removed from the network before the computer is logged off the network, it may take up to 45 minutes for that computer to be removed from the browse list.&quot; http://msdn.microsoft.com/archive/default.asp?url=/archive/en-us/dnarwnet/html/msdn_browse3.asp This annoys many in that the NN is not realtime. Even if you had shared this printer for just a split second, it could have been picked up by another machine. Further documents show that the NN may hold such for days or weeks. Don't let it bother you too much. Bob
