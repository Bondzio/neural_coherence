My friend who is a photographer has a new WD My Passport portable external drive. He also has a new Macbook Pro and a Nikon camera that takes large size files, about 70 mb each. Using a 32 gb compact flash card either in the camera or in a card reader, we have attempted to copy approximately 400 image files directly from the CF card My Passport drive, both being recognized by the Mac and connected via USB 3. With the first attempt, My Passport will only copy about half the files and then stop. On a second attempt, it again copies about a third to a half of the remaining files and then stops. On a third attempt, the same event occurs and only a portion of the remaining files are copied, although all are selected. There is no problem in copying the files directly from the computer to My Passport. All the files get copied immediately. But we would like to copy from the CF card to My Passport while both are connected to the computer, bypassing a transfer of the files to the computer. My Passport is formatted with ExFAT for both Windows PC's and Macs but will primarily be used with Mac. Any solution? Thanks.
