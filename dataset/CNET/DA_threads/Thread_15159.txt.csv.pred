1.2.2	http : //192.168.1.1 Does the router let you login ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	the manual says to login on the 192.68.0.1 but everytime i try the internet connection dies , so i have to turn off both the router and modem to get a connection again .	St
1.4.1	Perhaps your DSL modem is actually a modem/router , and it is giving IP addresses in the same range as your dlink router .	St
1.4.2	What I 'd try is disconnecting the DSL router and trying 192.168.0.1 again to get into the router and set it up to give out addresses in some other range ( 10.0.0.0 is a good range )	St
1.5.1	I wonder if you tried the links I provided .	St
1.5.2	You may have a document error .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
