I just bought an LCD TV, a Toshiba, and i also own a PS3 80gb.
I will be putting the TV on this media stand i got from office depot, with the PS3 under it.
I want to get a surge protector that you directly plug into both sockets on wall, has minimum 6 plugs, and protects the cable TV line.
The reason for the number of outlets is i will also be plugging in my cell phone charger and a lamp, as the stand is next to a desk.
I want it wall-mountable to save room.
