1.1.1	I am considering purchasing either a Gateway 827 GM or an E-Machines T6212 .	St
1.1.2	From what I can tell both have less than a 350W PSU .	St
1.1.3	I 'm planning on upgrading to a PCI-E video card if I buy one of these systems .	St
1.1.4	I 'd feel more comfortable with a 450W PSU , but have never swapped one of those out .	St
1.1.5	How difficult is it to make that change ?	Ques
1.1.6	Other than unplugging , securing the PSU and reconnecting what is involved ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions .	St
1.2.1	you should learn what compaines are good and you should find out what your system needs od n't just go on wattage i 'd take a good 350W over a no-name 450W because the 450W will provide less power , and not work aside from taht if you just want to get a suggestion i say Antec NeoPower 480W and that price is around average for a good mid-range PSU ( Mid-range is 450-500W )	St
1.3.1	You need to check the current required on each of the rails , as different PSUs pump out different amounts .	Sug
1.3.2	make sure it 's adequate to support your computer 's components .	Sug
1.3.3	Once you get your PC , you can open it up and look at the ratings on the power supply currently in it , and as long as the currents supplied on each rail by your new PSU are equal or more , you should be OK , as long as you also take into account the new component you want to put in .	St
1.3.4	Read this article for more info : http : //www.firingsquad.com/guides/power_supply/	St
1.4.1	The actual swapping of p/s units is pretty much straight-foward task .	St
1.4.2	The real problem is a true & quot ; physical fit & quot ; and same type of connections as that being replaced .	St
1.4.3	The connectiosn should n't be a big problems , just make sure of the 20-pin or 24-pin main mtrbd .	St
1.4.4	connection .	St
1.4.5	Then some p/s have dual fans or single fan where it directly blows across the cpu , check that .	St
1.4.6	If all you plan to do is replace the video card , the OEM p/s should do OK , but if not check at this website for power calucations : http : //www.jscustompcs.com/power_supply/ For the best p/s unit you can buy and a true match/fit look at the http : //www.pcpowerandcooling.com ( costs $ $ $ ) but well worth it .	St
1.4.7	Last , get the highest wattage unit you can afford , the bigger the better if you plan to further upgrade even more .	St
