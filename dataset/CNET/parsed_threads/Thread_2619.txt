<s> I am looking to upgrade my printer, specifically to improve photo printing. </s>
<s> Can someone explain the different between HP's Photosmart and Photoret IV printing. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Photosmart is the brand of the printers, photoret is the technology in the printers. </s>
<s> With photoret 4 you get improved print quality with your pictures lasting up to 65 years. </s>
<s> If you find one with photoret pro, it has the option to use 8 ink printing (ret4 only uses a 6 ink). </s>
<s> The extra two inks dramatically increase quality of colour if your doing black and white printing. </s>
<s> They are greyscale printing. </s>
<s> With pro photos last up to 73 years. </s>
<s> The drops of ink are smaller with photoret 4 than previous versions, so you get better quality and colour. </s>
<s> I work for HP, so any other questions you have fell free to ask, and I can answer them </s>
<s> Thanks Scorcher, that is perfect, I think Photoret IV is best for me, as I don't print black and white photos. </s>
<s> Scorcher, Since you work for HP, I am looking at the 8150 and the 8450. </s>
<s> Could you describe the key differences i would notice and whether the $50 price difference is worth it for the 8450? </s>
<s> Any thoughts would be great! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
