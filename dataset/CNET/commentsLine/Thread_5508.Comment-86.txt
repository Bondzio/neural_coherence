i have precisely the same problem with my wd remote drive and it's driving me around the bend.
sometimes the usb system recognizes it like it always has in the past but most times now i get the message &quot; this drive needs to be formatted&quot; having read these excellent answers i am now on the path to fix it, thanks very much, jeff
