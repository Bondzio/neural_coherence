i dont know what you are talking about in your message.
&quot;now you have two&quot; what does that mean.
i have the same computer, he needs the restore disks.
i have them and have never used them.
i dont plan on giving them to him.
but i will burn him a copy of each if it can be done, also if he is willing to pay for the cost of shipping.
i have never opened the pack the restore disks came in and i dont know what they say on them.
