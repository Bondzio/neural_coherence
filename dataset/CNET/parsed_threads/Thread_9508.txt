<s> I'm planning on buying a new desktop next month. </s>
<s> I'm mainly going to use it for composing music (Cubase or Logic) and just normal web surfing. </s>
<s> I don't play games but I do watch movies on my computer a lot I used to think that Mac was way ahead of PC in almost every aspect but now I think they both have their pros and cons. </s>
<s> I'd like someone to recommend me a PC as good as or better than the iMac at the price of the 21.5 inch model or simply persuade me to stay with Mac. </s>
<s> Alright so first off, there are two options for the 21.5&quot; iMac. </s>
<s> You have the 2.5Ghz and the 2.7Ghz which puts your price range at about $1200-$1500. </s>
<s> That being said it's fairly easy to pass that up with a standard desktop build. </s>
<s> The only things I would pay particular attention to are these: -Macs are incredibly hard, if not impossible, to manually upgrade. </s>
<s> That means that if you buy this, and 5years down the road decide you want a faster computer, you're more than likely going to have to buy a completely new iMac. </s>
<s> -PCs are much easier to upgrade and if you had a desktop right now at this price and power you could upgrade it later for significantly less money than a Mac. </s>
<s> -If you're buying a Mac because it &quot;Doesn't get viruses&quot; then you need to do a little more research. </s>
<s> Macs are equally susceptible when compared to a PC to viruses. </s>
<s> The only difference is that because most major companies run PCs, many viruses are directed towards affecting PCs. </s>
<s> It's just that people haven't taken the time, or found the reason to create viruses for many Macs. </s>
<s> But they do exist. </s>
<s> -Macs, however, are generally known for working very well with editing programs such as Photoshop and Music Editing software like you mentioned. </s>
<s> -PCs run these programs equally well, but the interface is usually less friendly on the PC side and they're slightly less stable, but unnoticeably so. </s>
<s> -In addition, the iMac is all-in-one. </s>
<s> The tower and the monitor are in one place. </s>
<s> This is great for saving space and generally looking sleek, but unfortunately is the main reason why upgrading them later on is so difficult. </s>
<s> The body of an iMac is not meant to be opened up. </s>
<s> -PCs take up much more space because the monitor and tower are separate, however, it is possible to buy &quot;All in One&quot; PCs too. </s>
<s> The only advantage to this is upgrade ability because the tower can be easily opened and parts easily removed. </s>
<s> Also many custom towers can be made to look exceptionally amazing. </s>
<s> -Also on a side note since you mentioned you were a Mac person, transitioning from the User Interface of a Mac to that of a PC is challenging and vice versa. </s>
<s> I assume you're not looking to build your own desktop and would prefer a stock desktop that you could order from Bestbuy or something? </s>
<s> If that's the case then here are a few generic desktops that fit roughly in the price range above. </s>
<s> I managed to find a few &quot;All in One&quot; PCs which, even though the tower and monitor are together, are still much easier to upgrade than an iMac. </s>
<s> I've upgraded a few myself. </s>

<s> Extra Features iMac: None Extra Features PC: None So to give you a little perspective on what's above: -The more expensive of the iMac and PC makes it fairly clear that the PC would be the way to go. </s>
<s> -The less expensive of the iMac and PC would depend more on personal preference as they both have their pros and cons. </s>
<s> -Keep in mind that both iMacs can be upgraded to above the listed specs. </s>
<s> However, this upgrade can only be done at checkout (before actually getting the iMac). </s>
<s> In addition, these upgrades are very costly. </s>
<s> Final thoughts: -Buy a Mac if you're comfortable with the User Interface and the features, but keep in mind that upgrading it later on will be near impossible. </s>
<s> -Buy a PC if you're looking for an easy way to upgrade it later, or if you would prefer a bit more bang for your buck. </s>
<s> I say this because generally speaking, PCs out perform most Macs in both Notebook and Desktop form when it comes to a cost to performance ratio. </s>
<s> -Keep in mind that the iMacs can be upgraded at checkout to easily pass the listed PCs, but it will add on another $500-$1000 or more. </s>
<s> -Also, when buying a PC, anti-virus software is a must, this will usually run you about $60/3years or you can try Microsoft Security Essentials (which is actually fairly good) for free. </s>
<s> -Macs can get viruses, but rarely, so anti-virus software wouldn't be necessary. </s>
<s> -The Operating Systems for Macs are noticeably cheaper compared to Windows OS. </s>
<s> -When it comes to the lifespan of Macs and PCs it depends on the make and model, but generally speaking you will have less complications with a Mac because everything in them is built to run together well (which is one reason why it can't be upgraded easily). </s>
<s> PCs, however, may not last as long, but if a part goes out in them it can be replaced much cheaper than it could be in a Mac. </s>
<s> So all of that being said, the final decision is up to you. </s>
<s> If you're a gamer, the PC will almost always be the way to go. </s>
<s> If you're a media or digital artist than Macs are usually the better option. </s>
<s> For someone just looking at audio software and web surfing you could get a more stable build from a Mac, however if you plan on doing anything else or are worried about costs down the road, I would definitely consider a PC. </s>
<s> Hope this helped! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> for giving me such an excellent answer. </s>
<s> however, I'd just like to say that with all respect, I don't ever upgrade my computer or find the need to.. when it comes to computers, I pay once and use the device for like 2 to 3 years before buying a brand new one. </s>
<s> I actually use PC at my office when I work and like you said, it does run those editing softwares and programs but I am not so much satisfied with its performance.. </s>
<s> I can easily tell that it's struggling to run it as smoothly as possible and it's quite annoying when it glitches once in a while.. </s>
<s> I get that PC gives you a lot of options and it's excellent for gaming but like I mentioned, I'm looking for computer with better media performance and I think staying with Mac would be best. </s>
<s> If there is any more opinions on this that I should know about, please feel free to reply </s>
