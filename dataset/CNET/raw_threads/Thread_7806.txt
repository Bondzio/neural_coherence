Prime concerns are noise and ability to play 1080P movies off HDD. My question is, what do I need to consider when building from parts? I think I made sure all parts would work but am I missing anything? Here's what I plan on using (all from NewEgg.com): IN WIN BP655.200BL Black Mini-ITX Desktop Computer Case 200W Power Supply Model #:BP655.200BL Item #:N82E16811108196 ASRock H67M-ITX LGA 1155 Intel H67 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 Mini ITX Intel Motherboard Model #:H67M-ITX Item #:N82E16813157238 Intel Core i3-2100T Sandy Bridge 2.5GHz LGA 1155 35W Dual-Core Desktop Processor BX80623I32100T Model #:BX80623I32100T Item #:N82E16819116394 G.SKILL 4GB (2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1333 (PC3 10600) Dual Channel Kit Desktop Memory Model F3-10600CL8D-4GBHK Model #:F3-10600CL8D-4GBHK Item #:N82E16820231180 I plan on using a 640GB WD Caviar Blue I have on hand and Windows 7 Home Premium. Not sure which RF keyboard/mouse I'll use, maybe one with a trackpad to keep it simple. Does anyone see any potential issues with my setup? Seems straightforward but I'm a PC builder noob. Thanks for the help in advance!

I was looking at Boxee, AppleTV, and Roku (no internal storage); PopCorn Hour A-210, Dune HDI, PS3, and XBox (not a perfect fit for one or another reason and GUIs received some complaints); and small form factor HTPCs like Asus EEE 1021, ZBox AD-02, and others with AMD Fusion E-350 APU (expensive for what it can do). I'm probably going to pull the trigger on the purchase in a few days and appreciate you looking the config over.

Don't need 4GB but if cheap, won't hurt. Gskill not my favorite brand. Consider a larger case with side fans for better ventilation, otherwise CPU and PSU fans will become noisy if they work too hard. Throw in a BD reader so that you have a straight answer when a visitor asks &quot;so how do you play Blu-Ray in this thing&quot;?
