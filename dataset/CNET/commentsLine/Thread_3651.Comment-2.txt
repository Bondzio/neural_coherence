hopefully you realize the power output advertised on these is bogus.
you get 10 w rms and not 800 to 900 watts the various dealers specify.
anyway, you generally just need a shielded cable that plugs into your sound card's jack and into the speaker's input jack.
the speaker set should probably come with such a cable.
there are no drivers or such needed.
just plug it in, turn up the volume and hope it works.
