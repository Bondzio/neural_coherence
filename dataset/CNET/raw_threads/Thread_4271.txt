I installed win xp with service pack 3 on it, and everything seems to work fine, except when i try to play a dvd or cd. (BTW it has 1 gig of memory) I don't think it is hardware related. When i try to play a dvd the sound is almost inaudible and along with the video it starts and stops. The sound sometimes is almost ok but sounds like theres an echo. The cd player is the same way, it plays the cd but starts and stops. I can take both players out and install in another computer and they work just fine. I worked on this for 3 or 4 days off and on and am about to get tired of messing with it. I have run dell diagnostics and installed and reinstalled drivers and checked everything i know of but nothing seems to help.Anyone can help with this i'd sure appreciate it.....thanks

I'm finding folk to not know their machine and I turn off sound effects like reverb in the sound control panels. No, I can't tell you exactly where since this area is not standardized. 3. Always try VLC PLAYER for Video DVD playback. Bob

Using the vlc player also does nothing. I just don;t get it, sound and videos play fine on everything except the dvd and cd players. I can play videos on youtube and everything is good.

Here's the thing I carry around to sniff it out.	http://www.amazon.com/External-Sound-Adapter-Desktop-Notebook/dp/B000BUDHNQ/ This and a few others are under 3 so it's something you carry around to figure it out.

One is a Pioneer dvd rw and the other is a samsung cdrw drive. But like i said i can put these in another computer and they work fine--thanks

But I'm unsure how to convey that optical drives over 2 years old are iffy. Some owners dig in their heels and you can't get them to change out an old drive. So you let them be until they are serious about fixing the machine. Bob
