<s> I own a Dell e1705 and I'd like to upgrade the hard drive to a 7200RPM hard drive (from an 80GB 5400RPM drive) primarily for speed and also for whatever additional storage I can get. </s>
<s> However, I'm not quite sure what the right time is to do that. </s>
<s> It seems right now that the only 7200RPM drives out are 100GB, which isn't much more storage space than I currently have. </s>
<s> Should I wait until 7200RPM drives come out that have more than 100GB of storage, or will that not happen for a while? </s>
<s> Does anybody have any info on this? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>

<s> Don't tell, but Santa brought our first year college kid a spiffy 300GB external. </s>
<s> Santa only paid 99 bucks for it. </s>

<s> Lol, cool. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I'm looking for an internal one . </s>
<s> However - I just found out that Seagate actually has a new internal laptop hard drive model coming out that is exactly what I want. </s>
<s> It is a 7200RPM internal 2.5'' drive with 160GB of storage. </s>
<s> This is perfect for my needs - however, it doesn't seem to be out yet, even though it was announced in June... </s>
<s> When you put in the new drive you may need an external USB housing to clone the drive and then do the swap. </s>
<s> You'll end up with a drive and a housing which go together. </s>
