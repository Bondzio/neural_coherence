1.1.1	I 'm thinking of getting a new computer .	St
1.1.2	While back-up is important , I 'm thinking that the best approach is to get a fast HD settup with backup to an external HD as this stuff is getting bigger and cheaper everyday .	St
1.1.3	I suspect we 'll be able to get USB flash storage in the 20-30 GB size very cheap over the next year or two - so why buy and loadup my new desktop with expensive HD 's .	St
1.1.4	Anyway , I 'm thinking of the 160 GB - 10K rpm in a RAID 0 settup ( for a total of 320 GB storage ) .	St
1.1.5	My question is how will I work with a RAID 0 settup ?	Ques
1.1.6	Will it & quot ; appear & quot ; to me as a single HD , such as the C drive ?	Ques
1.1.7	If I want to dump copies to an external HD , is there anything complicated doing that from a RAID 0 settup ?	Ques
1.1.8	Anybody know of downsides of a RAID 0 settup ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	The only caveat is that GHOST until later versions could n't backup or restore to most RAID systems .	St
1.2.2	Try Acronis for that .	St
1.2.3	RAID is nice but do n't count it as & quot ; storage & quot ; since drives last about 5 years and the storage aspect until some error happens .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	as far as your os is concerned , you 'll only have 1 hard drive attached .	St
1.3.2	the biggest downside is reduced reliability ( a 2 drive stripe-set is twice as likely to fail as a single drive ) .	St
1.3.3	you 'll also lose SMART monitoring capability at the OS level unless your raid controller provides monitoring software .	St
1.3.4	you 'll need to do some research and determine the optimum chunk size for your controller and disk combination .	St
1.3.5	generally its 32k ( with 4k ntfs clusters ) but some controllers differ .	St
1.3.6	once set , you typically ca n't change it without reinitializing the array and the wrong setting can hinder performance .	St
1.3.7	raid 0 can also sometimes increase your disk access time on 'dumb ' controllers and thus decrease performance .	St
1.3.8	lastly , some manufacturers ( like western digital ) offer drives fine-tuned for raid use .	St
1.3.9	check them out and see if they 're worth the premium .	Sug
