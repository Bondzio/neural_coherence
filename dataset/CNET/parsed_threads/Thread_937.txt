<s> Like Crafty, I have a choice betwen the above two processors. </s>
<s> Which is best and most reliable - not necessarily the fastest ( I rarely if ever play games etc ), but use the PC for general home use and surfing the internet. </s>
<s> Any advice much appreciated. </s>
<s> ...but the 533MHz FSB is really killing it. </s>
<s> Unless you do some heavy multitasking, the AMD will be better. </s>
<s> The Intel is cheap, though. </s>
<s> I assume that you mean the AMD Athlon 64 X2, right? </s>
<s> I built my system on this and love it. </s>
<s> I think the performance is so much better than the Pentium D's. </s>
<s> And it seems I am not alone in this opinion, virtually every opinion, review, or site says the same thing. </s>
<s> Even if you aren't a gamer, fast is good, right? </s>
<s> And dual is the way to go nowadays, especially with Vista coming. </s>
<s> You will benefit from dual core no matter what. </s>
<s> The X2 3800+ is a great value-to-performance ratio at $300 from Monarch. </s>
<s> Don't worry about comparing clock speeds, Intel and AMD rate them differently (as you prolly know). </s>
<s> If you want more opinions, you can search my profile/posts for more info. </s>
<s> Good luck, cheers. </s>
<s> I bought a HP computer that has the AMD 64x2 4200 and couldn't be happier. </s>
<s> I added a video card and another gig of ram and the computer is amazingly fast. </s>
<s> A friend bought a computer with the Intel duel core processor and has had a lot of heating problems with it. </s>
<s> He has the same model computer as mine but with the Intel processor and mine runs circles around his speed wise. </s>
<s> I don't do gaming but I do a lot of grapics and the speed is very much welcomed. </s>
<s> the athlon 64 x2 is fast powerful and very overclockable. </s>
<s> with netburst you cant overclock </s>
<s> ...is very good for overclocking. </s>
<s> You can get a 3GHz P4 to 4GHz with relative ease on stock cooling. </s>
<s> However, they get owned by AMD's in every benchmark, and the Intels have to be clocked very high to beat the AMD's. </s>
