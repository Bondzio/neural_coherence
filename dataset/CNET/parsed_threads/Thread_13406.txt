<s> I've been asking around, A LOT.....Here and elsewhere. </s>
<s> Many different ppl have said many different things about upgrades of cards. </s>
<s> I just want the simplest way to upgrade to a dedicated card that can play some games. </s>
<s> But not the high-end intense games like &quot;Oblivion&quot;. </s>
<s> ANd can give me good video when watching in HD. </s>
<s> I would like to avoid upgrading the power supply (if possible). </s>
<s> I'm new to upgrading on my own, so I'd like to go simple. </s>
<s> THese are my specs: HP Pavilion a6157c desktop 250W Power Supply 2GB memory 320GB Hard Drive E4400, 2.0GHz Intel Processor Windows Vista Home Premium Integrated Media Accelerator 950 &quot;card&quot; (chip onboard) I got my bundle very reasonably priced w/ an HP w2207 Wide 22&quot; Brightview monitor w/DVI and cables ($999 Costco) I've been told by techs at Best Buy I can go with the NVIDIA GeForce 8500GT PCI-express w/512 MB using my 250W supply, but HP say I'd need to upgrade power to 300W. </s>
<s> Hp also says I can go with NVIDIA 7600GS, but would still need to upgrade to 300W. </s>
<s> Infact HP said any newer card today would need to be used w/ 300W. </s>
<s> Who's right here???? </s>
<s> Maybe if I find I'm capable at installing this graphics card, I may venture out in the future and build my own, or keep expanding (as much as possible), on this bundle. </s>
<s> I'd pick the lowest cost offering from this link -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/07/03/the_best_gaming_video_cards_for_the_money/ Bob </s>
<s> go to google and type in &quot;power supply calculator&quot; the first link click it and fill in all that you have. </s>
<s> this will give you an idea of how much juice you are using. </s>
<s> So when deciding what card to get you dont affect system performance. </s>
<s> But consider: Best Buy's goal is to sell you stuff, I personally would NEVER TRUST ANYTHING THEY TELL YOU EVER, especially after reading about the Geek Squad &quot;scandal&quot; (more like acknowledgement of what we all knew was happening anyways). </s>
<s> They'll tell you it'll work, sell you the hardware, and if the system comes back damaged, why does it hurt them? </s>
<s> They get more reputation for helping you fix it, and more money from you buying parts. </s>
<s> HP is the original manufacturer, and therefore should be considered the authority on the system, even if the CSR isn't an electrical engineer, they've likely dealt with your particular model a thousand times over, and have the HP spec sheets telling them what it can and can't do, regardless of what some (can I say punk?) </s>
<s> employee at Best Buy tells you. </s>
<s> An online PSU calculator can be very helpful, but consider that it only gives you an estimate of wattage draw, and doesn't take into account power supply efficiency. </s>
<s> Most modern high end PSUs are 450-550W, purely because thats where most enthusiast buyers are shopping (because they want to power high end parts like GeForce 8800's and quad core processors). </s>
<s> I would say either the 8500, or HP's suggestion of the 7600GS (newegg has a nice deal on a HIS Radeon X1650Pro which is $62 AR)) But to the power supply point, most 250-350W units are low quality, however there are a few decent quality units such as the Antec SmartPower 350W. </s>
