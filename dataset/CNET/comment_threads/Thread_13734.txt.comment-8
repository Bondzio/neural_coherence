you give me great advices.. and I will tell you things about my Computer: processor:Intel Core&#8482;2 Duo Desktop Processor E8400 motherboard:asus P5Q-E ram:2G operating system: windows vista so you thnink that If I buy HD 4850 or XFX 9800 plus,the previous featuers can run game like crysis fast??
and is HD 4850 still better than XFX 9800 plus without Overclocking because I will not do overclocking to the card I will buy, and where I can find full Specification of HD 4850 card on the net ??
THANKS
