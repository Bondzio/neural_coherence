When I turn it on hard drive access light stays on, power supply fan runs, small fan on heatsink does not, ( will turn freeley by hand.) I liked my old emach,so I purchased a new one model T5010. I do not want to donate or give my old one away as it has a lot of personal info on hard drive. I can not transfer the info to my new one as it has a sticker on the cover that if broken voids the warranty. Should I take the hard drive,cd, and two 256 merory sticks out and throw the rest in the trash.?

All you have to do is take out the hdd of the old computer, and use a kit to make it a usb hdd case. http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=6991605&type=product&id=1099392683637 After you transfer your important files, I'd format it and use it as a back up drive, or wipe it with any free programs (like bcwipe) and dispose of it.

You can take the memory and add it to your surrent computer (given it's the right format), you can build a totally new machine with your parts. Get a new motherboard, a new case, and use the parts in your dead emach like hdd, memory, optical drive, and before you know it, you have a brand new computer.

What everyone forgot to mention here was the fact that emachies has a shutdown temp control in the bios and if your cpu gets to hot, it won't boot or function. Replace the cpu fan for fifteen\twenty bucks, it will recognize the fan is going, temp down and it may run again. I own one so I know, replaced my fan, had SAME problem. There is a chance the cpu is dead but I would try it. Good luck, Paul
