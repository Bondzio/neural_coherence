<s> I want a Socket A CPU fan for my AMD Athlon XP 2400+ that is quiet and easy to install. </s>
<s> What is a good or even best CPU fan available. </s>
<s> PLease i would like the price range to about $10-$50. </s>
<s> I have never installd a CPU fan so i would like some video instructions. </s>
<s> What is the difficulty of installing a CPU fan from a scale of 1 to 5. </s>
<s> Sadly, with close to 100 Watts of possible heat to remove, a silent heatsink will be fairly large and rank not only a 5 on the install difficulty but cost more than your budget. </s>
<s> http://www.silentpcreview.com/article201-page1.html might come close, but still ranks a 4 on difficulty since YOU get to determine if this unit fits in your case. </s>
