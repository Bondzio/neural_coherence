On the front there's a little panel thing in one of the slots like where the dvd drive is fixed that has a USB connection and two slots labeled &quot;SD/MMC/SM/MS/MS-PRO/xD&quot; and &quot;CF/MICRODRIVE&quot;. I, being the genius that I am, inserted my CF card from my camera into the CF drive, but I think I did it backwards. It wasn't reading and didn't click or anything, so I got tweezers to try to pull it out, but that just pushed it in more and now I can't even try to pull it out from the front. It doesn't read on My Computer and whenever I try to open the drive called &quot;CompactFlashI/II (H:)&quot; it says I need to insert a disk. If I click eject, it does nothing. My question is, how do I go about getting my card back out? Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!

You'll gain greater access maybe the depth of the bezel removed will be enough to grip the CF card. Otherwise, if that area itself can be removed as like a cage unit to gain further access w/o actually tearing down the unit itself. You'll still have to open case, etc. to get into this. All this info is generic in nature, you have to check then proceed. I exclude any possible damage that may have happened if the CF card port was permanent. All those memory cards, I can't recall if it used contact pins to mount vs. pads on the CF card. You'll need to inspect after CF removal the card and port for continued us. tada -----Willy
