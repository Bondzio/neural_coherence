you're in luck the early AGP (ver#1-#2) used 3.3v and you have a motherboard that supports AGP4/8.
which is the common one.
i'm stuck in the same boat that you are.
i have two systems running 3.2 prescotts and i'm not ready to scrap them out just yet.
the 7800 looks like the end of the line for agp unless someone steps forward.
the x850xt-pe cards are close but still bringing too much money and they are getting hard to find.
