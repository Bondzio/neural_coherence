i would suggest the 6800gs.
it is about $200 and can play modern games relatively well at high settings and will last a while.
the 6800gt is around $250 for a small performance boost.
the 7800gtx is more like 450 usd and i dont think u would want 1/2 of the computer budget to be only the graphics card.
