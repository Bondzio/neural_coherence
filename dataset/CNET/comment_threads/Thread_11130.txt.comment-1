Hello everyone, I am building a new system with a MSI 939 socket motherboard and Athlon 64 CPU, 2GB Ram, 256 MB video etc.
It will be rather high grade system from what I have owned previously.
It was suggested to me to purchase a high grade power supply.
The Enermax 660 Watt PSU was recommended.
It looks to be a heavy duty unit.
What are your thoughts on the Enermax 660 watt PSU?
Thanks.
Greetings from Canada.
