hd won't spin, its a goner from any end user part of recovery.
yeah, you could try this or that but more than likely its a goner.
as robert mentions, try some data recovery service provided the data is worth it and/or depends on how much worth for the cost.
however, you can search these forums for hd help ideas, but it has been my experience any hd that can't power-on or spin usually has gone beyond typical fixes.
however, if its the electronic pcb, swap with another exact working one and hope for the best.
