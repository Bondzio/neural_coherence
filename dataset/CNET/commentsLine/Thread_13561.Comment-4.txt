if you right click the .exe that starts the game and choose properties, then the compatability tab, and you try to run it in w98 mode instead, does that effectively give more resources to the game to run right?
xp eats many resources and perhaps you can get them to temporarily 'go away' by using the w98 setting instead?
if not, you can always turn it back to xp and use some of the other suggestions here.
