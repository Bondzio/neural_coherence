inkjets are great and can have beautiful photo output - but if you're looking to run an invitation business and print on metallic papers or colored cardstock - inkjets are not going to work.
paper stocks soak up the ink and can also change the ink's color tone depending on the color of paper you are printing to.
they also can bleed or spiderweb your print on the paper.
this is most commonly true of metallic paper stock or any with a rough coated texture.
a laser would be a better option if you choose to print them yourself.
however, lasers are not all made to really handle cardstock in heavy volumes, and can bend or curl the card stock due to the way they bend through the machine.
they can also have ink adhesion issues (ink rubbing off paper/card stock) and feeding problems.
unless you are able to invest a significant amount of money, there does not appear to be a &quot;desktop&quot; color laser with the same quality of output as the larger printing companies using printing presses and digital presses.
it may be fine if you are doing business for friends and family - but be forewarned - you may run into large quality control issues, frustrating feeding issues and/or time and expenses (supplies, etc.)
that won't make it worth your efforts.
i hope that helps!
