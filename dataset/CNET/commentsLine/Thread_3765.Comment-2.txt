here's a nice memory tester:  you can also use sisoft sandra to benchmark and test your ram:  neither needs a floppy, but no memory tester that runs in windows can check every byte of ram.
like you, i too decided that &quot;i don't need no stinkin' floppy&quot; and later regretted the decision.
i now have a usb floppy drive ($30) for situations like this.
before testing, go into your bios, and reset any memory configuration pages/options to auto or default.
manually configuring the ram or using 'agressive' settings can cause problems when memory with different speeds or from different manufacturers is installed.
since you have two sticks, you can usually test both banks almost fully, by simply swapping their position and re-running the tests.
