of sm3 and fp32.
raptors in raid not much faster and waste of money.
getting 64-bit xp is stupid as there will probably be some software/hardware conflict as not many appls and stuff even use 64-bit yet would recommend u to stick with what u had i think there is a typo as 3200+is not 1.4ghz and i would recommend getting the 3000+ venice and overclock and getting an evga 6600gt.
