The most comprehensive comparison of brand reliability I have seen is done by PC Magazine.
Here are links to the article and the chart on the ratings: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2368154,00.asp http://www.pcmag.com/image_popup/0,1871,iid=267317,00.asp You have not stated how you will use the computer or what price range.
If you are looking for a low end model, then one of the large manufacturers options will provide the most bang for the buck.
However, you also generally get low grade components, a small PSU which limits upgrades, oftern not being able to add a decent graphics card, and bloatware.
If you want an intermediate level to above machine and/or want to avoid the above limitations, then I strongly recommend a custom build from CyberPower.
Note that they evaluated on the reliability list linked above and rank higher than all other prebuilt systems except Apple.
If interested in this option, you go to there site and select the components.
This will take a little more work since you have to pick the components, but that can be a fun process too.
For help, take a look at this link I just posted to earlier: http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7586_102-517823.html?tag=threadListing;forum-threads If you want to add or upgrate the graphics card for any of these systems, you can find helpful guidance and other resources at this site: http://www.upgradevideocards.com/index.html
