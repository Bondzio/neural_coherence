this has been a problem for me, until i discovered that a magnetic field was affecting my hard drive.
solution: 1)remove all speakers, phones and dsl modems from closeness to the motherboard; 2) demagnatize the hard drive by disconnecting the cable at both ends that go to the drive and to the motherboard for approximately 15 seconds: 3) reconnect, plug in power and reboot.
this will happen several more times as long as that field is somewhere inside of your pc circuits.
however, a repeat of the above procedure always rescued me.
