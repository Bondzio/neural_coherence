I did look through the others, but I couldn't find one that applied to my situation.
Haven't been able to find anything in my documentation either.
I bought this computer knowing that the 6150SE is not intended for high-end gaming.
That's fine, because I don't play many games and when I do, they are usually not the graphic-intensive variety.
It's just that occasionally I like to fire up a flight sim and am wondering if I can get a little bit better performance out of this computer.
I assume that means a graphics card, but if there are other ways to do it, I'm all ears.
