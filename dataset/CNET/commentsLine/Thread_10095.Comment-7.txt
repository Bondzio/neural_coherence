a setting or entry by name is what we use.
i'm surprised this router didn't note the dmz entry.
maybe it's for mass consumption and not for folk that need to do more than the usual?
this means no, i didn't read this router's manual.
mostly because all have had the dmz feature.
is this a first?
a router without such?
