<s> Alright so we just bought a new Belkin N Router. </s>
<s> The only way for my computer to be connected is for it to be wirelessly connected. </s>
<s> But the wireless adapter I have isn't detecting the network. </s>
<s> I've got a D-Link G usb adapter. </s>
<s> Is there any way to make the wireless adapter G adapter compatible with my N Router? </s>
<s> I've also got a Belkin G wireless adapter, is there any way to make that compatible as well? </s>
<s> the SSID from the router? </s>
<s> Encryption? </s>
<s> Laptop or desktop? </s>
<s> Desktop, dump the USB and get a PCI adapter. </s>
<s> Hypothetically is SHOULD work, sometimes there can be issues. </s>
<s> For a desktop I would take the prior poster's advice, slot card as opposed to usb adapter, better ranging. </s>
<s> Back to SHOULD work, been there more than once with mix and match hdwe, can be frustrating. </s>
<s> So generally what I do is match hdwe/ software. </s>
<s> Bite the bullet, since you are using a specific manufacturer's router (N) match the router with the same manufacturer's slot card and use the N to get better ping potential. </s>
