I need help choosing a photo scanner that can handle black & white negatives, black and white prints, color negatives, color prints and color transparencies-- all with good quality results-- and transmit them directly to my PC for editing and storage.
I use Picasa now.
I also have available Irfanview and Microsoft Digital Image suite 10.
I've never owned a scanner, but I've heard that I'm not asking too much of a single unit.
If the same machine can also be used as a printer, so much the better but that isn't essential.
