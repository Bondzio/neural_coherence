if your dedicated gc goes out and u decided against the integrated..... you are screwed!!!!
just a blank monitor until u go get another card.
this is why i always get an integrated gpu but never use it.... i just use the integrated for back up....and whats w/ you people claiming u cant play any games on integrated?
you can play some games....such as l4d2 on my 6150se ... but not on max settings like youd like them to be, or any of the newest games.
useful for when/if your card goes out or is doa.
my advice would be to get the integrated card for a back up, and then research the card u want... best bet would be an nvidia 200 series for a single card setup.
