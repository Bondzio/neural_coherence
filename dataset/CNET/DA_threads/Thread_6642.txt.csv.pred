1.1.1	Does somebody know how to deal with this problem ?	Ques
1.1.2	I have a BENQ external cd-rw usb device and the notebook recognizes it as an USB Optical Storage .	St
1.1.3	I tried it in a desktop and it does the same thing .	St
1.1.4	I cant even install the driver because it does not found the device or because windows looks for a driver of a USB data storage .	St
1.1.5	Thank you in advance	St
1.2.1	Only 2 versions of Windows might see it as a CDRW .	St
1.2.2	All others see such as drive as & quot ; USB Optical Storage. & quot ; To use the drive I add software such as you find at http : //www.cdburnerxp.se/ Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you for the reply , but I do not see how can a burning software remedy this problem .	St
1.3.2	The site does not have any help on this problem and it seems that the software hasnt been tested on any external Benq yet .	St
1.4.1	Windows ( most versions ) does not know a CDRW drive from a CD drive .	St
1.4.2	Many are unaware of this and fall into a trap of & quot ; it should n't be this way & quot ; for some period of time .	St
1.4.3	I 'll wait for you to figure that out .	St
1.4.4	In the meantime , if you want to create a CDR or CDRW disk , the software I noted is free to try out .	St

1.5.1	The problem is that the device was working ok , and after the same cable was used to connect a digital camera with the computer , it did not work anymore since it recognizes the drive as optical storage and does not read any kind of cd .	St
1.5.2	It seems to me that the device does not communicate at all with the computer ( it must be it since there is no driver for the cd-rw drive ) .	St
1.6.1	While I may wonder why you did n't write this in your first post , I now just ask you to ignore any reply up to this point and hope someone else sees a solution .	St
1.6.2	To me the drive sounds dead or you have an USB 1.1 cable and it should an USB 2.0 cable .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	I apologize for not being explicit in the beginning , I thought the fact that the computer recognizes the drive as optical storage would be enough , hoping that somebody else got the same problem .	St
1.7.2	I hope it is just a cable problem .	St
1.7.3	Thank you for your help .	St
1.8.1	The detail was needed since most Windows would ID such a drive as ... such .	St
1.8.2	And I would see nothing wrong .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
