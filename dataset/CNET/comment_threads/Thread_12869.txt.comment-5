is a basic method of solving problems on any type/age computer.
You want to find out what is causing the supply to shutdown or run hot.
If you want to see if the supply runs hot when not connected to anything.
Simply jumper the green wire on the connector that goes to the mobo to any of the black wires, and the supply should turn on [as noted by the fan turning][also tells whether the power switch is defective]and stay on as long as the jumper is present.
The supply will have no external load, and thus if it blows out hot air the supply itself is bad.
