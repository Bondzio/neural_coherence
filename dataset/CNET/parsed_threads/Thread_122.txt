<s> I've had 3 different HP reps try to help. </s>
<s> Many hours later, they sent me another printer. </s>
<s> Same problem. </s>
<s> Computer displays &quot;printing&quot;, printer displays &quot;printing&quot;, but nothing happens. </s>
<s> Early on I was able to get one Word doc to print but then it went back to the &quot;ghost&quot; printing or error. </s>
<s> I have uninstalled my other two printers and scanner so the hp can be the only one. </s>
<s> I've also tried installing the hp with the driver from their website. </s>
<s> Still nothing. </s>
<s> The printer will print the demo page by depressing the button on the printer. </s>
<s> If I don't get a resolution by Monday, I'll be returning both printers and find another brand of color laser jet printer. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I need good color copies for pattern covers. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I am also experiencing the same prob. </s>
<s> However, I must state my prob is to do with Vista as I have another PC on XP SP2. </s>
<s> It is working perfectly. </s>
<s> My prob is that on the Vista machine, the driver keepds disappearing. </s>
<s> I have loaded, several times, from the disk that came with the machine. </s>
<s> on some occasions, it will load okay and I can print without a prob. </s>
<s> Once I switch the machine off and on again and try printing, the drivers would have disappeared. </s>
<s> On some occassions, the drivers just wont load. </s>
<s> The following error message comes up: &quot;an error has been encountered ......&quot; No specifics, no error codes. </s>
<s> Have contacted HP by email, just the auto reply promising that a technician would contact me. </s>
<s> That was 3 mnths back. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> the drivers from the disk? </s>

<s> Hi Rick Thanx for your reply and sorry for the delay in responding. </s>
<s> The solution you suggested has not borne any fruit. </s>
<s> In fact, I've done that donkey times. </s>
<s> Everything runs until &quot;Detected new printer. </s>
<s> Please wat.............&quot; It freezes there. </s>
<s> The HP website suggests in that case, pulling out the USB cable and back again. </s>
<s> It responds to the USB, then the message &quot;Installation operation failed&quot;. </s>
<s> At times I go thru the process you suggested and it works. </s>
<s> Most tho, especially when i really need the printer, it fails. </s>
<s> Don't know what to do now. </s>
<s> run the Windows Cleanup Utility. </s>
<s> It will completely remove the printer from your computer. </s>
<s> First, make a system restore point. </s>
<s> In case you accidentally click on something wrong, you can always come back to what you already have. </s>
<s> Download and run the Windows Cleanup Utility. </s>
