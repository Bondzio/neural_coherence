as i said, i got the gateway nv53 for just about $500, and i like it as much if not more than most desktops i've used.
it's just an average computer as far as it's guts, but i am very impressed.
it is a great looking machine, and it's survived my 3 year old stepping on it with no issues, and it screams.
it's got a few goodies in it too.
it's 500gb, 4gb ram, it's an amd athlon?
ii x2 dual-core processor m300 (2.00 ghz, 1 mb l2 cache, 2ddr2 667 mhz, 35 w)i know 2 ghz is a smaller processor, but i absolutely can not tell on this machine.
i am now a gateway customer 4 life!
