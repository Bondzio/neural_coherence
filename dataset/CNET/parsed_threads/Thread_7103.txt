<s> The door on my superdrive won't open using the button on the door or with eject from Toast software, I have a firewire drive attached and it does open from Toast. </s>
<s> Superdrive is a Pioneer DVR-103. </s>
<s> Computer is Power Mac G4 733 digital audio running OS X 10.2.8. </s>
<s> Drive shows up on system profiler and on Toast. </s>
<s> Do I have a bad drive? </s>
<s> I found the problem, the tray was jammed against a piece of plastic under the tray. </s>
<s> Fiddled a bit and unjammed it. </s>
<s> I do have another issue though. </s>
<s> In OS X the profiler says burning is fully supported but I can't burn files without making a disc image of the file first. </s>
<s> The disc works fine on the mac but doesn't read on a PC. </s>
<s> My version of Toast only works on classic, do I have to get Toast for OS X to burn cross platform discs? </s>
<s> This is probably a function of your old version of Toast. </s>
<s> You really should be moving away from anything &quot;Classic&quot;. </s>
<s> The OS X version of Toast will burn just about anything, including PC compatible disks, DVD, D/L DVD, CD and all the other neat stuff. </s>
<s> Toast 6 Titanium OS X version, is the earliest version you should be looking for but Toast 7 would be nice. </s>
<s> Happy burning P </s>
