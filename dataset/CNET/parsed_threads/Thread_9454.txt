<s> Hi I hope you can help, I have installed new memory in Fujitsu Siemens T-Bird 1.5Ghz it starts up but monitor does not come on, nothing happens, I have four sticks on memory to try (all are 256k and match 128k original stick installed except for capacity of course). </s>
<s> I have tried one stick at a time in both free slots, I have tried two at a time etc. </s>
<s> Same story each time, no video signal. </s>
<s> Once I remove them and leave the original it starts no problem. </s>
<s> Running XP profession with SPII. </s>
<s> Any help would be much appreciated. </s>
