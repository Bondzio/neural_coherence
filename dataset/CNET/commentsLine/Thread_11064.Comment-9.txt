ok. i've skimmed some online docs which describe nats to varying degrees, most being technically over my head, but i think i'm getting the picture.
i also spent some time glancing through the user manual for the new gigabit router i bought, and the default settings for the router's firewall are &quot;disabled&quot; for incoming and &quot;enabled&quot; for outgoing.
i also have the option of establishing the nat as either &quot;secure&quot; or &quot;open&quot;.
from everything you've shared, bob, and the little bit of understanding i've gained through additional skimming around the net, i assume that my best starting point is to accept the default firewall settings and leave teh nat as &quot;secure&quot;.
am i correct?
thanks again for your patience and time, bob.
i am not oblivious to how much time it can take to bring someone up to speed on something they don't understand to begin with.
i've done it many times myself with &quot;newbies&quot; in the automotive enthusiast forum i frequent.
