looking to upgrade my emachine t5026.
putting in a gigabyte ga-ma69gm-s2h and amd64 x2 6000+ cpu,2gb ddr2 800 ram.
the power supply that comes with the t5026 i believe is 300w, is this enough to power my new system or do i need to go 500w.
thanks in advance also i'm using integrated graphics, may use pcie slot in the future.
