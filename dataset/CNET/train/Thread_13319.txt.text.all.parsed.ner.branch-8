799	4	148061	1653746	1653699	mrmacfixit	1/7/06 7:25 am	1.1366187e12	agreed	but i'm not trying to sell you anything. this poster is not in the market for a laptop, does not use windows at all and is looking for a higher end machine than a laptop. your reasoning is valid for your own reasons. however, not everyone will want the ability to double or triple boot different os's or to change horses in mid-stream. many moved to mac to get away from windows so the ability of a machine to run both is not a great selling point to them. i doubt the majority of dyed in the wool windows users will purchase one of the intel macs just because it will run windows as well as os x. they probably have no intention of spending the extra cash on something that will do both when they will only ever use the one. granted, some will and you have the case for that. p
799	5	148061	1654045	1653746	r. proffitt	1/7/06 9:59 am	1.13662794e12	the &quot;other&quot; reason.	word from my developer friend is that the pc emulator is now very usable in the mactel developer machines. one can guess the speedup is that no emulation of the cpu's instructions must occur. there will be some pundits that will dig in and yell &quot;powerpc will be fine&quot; but given what i've seen i would not pick up a new machine based of the old cpu. bob

799	8	148061	1654953	1654658	mrmacfixit	1/7/06 4:18 pm	1.13665068e12	(nt) unfortunately not.	there have been a leak or two flying around but they all seem to concentrate on the machines ability with windows. there was a mention of os x not suffering but no details. i think the g5 has a little left in it, witness the quad version which seemed to have come from left field, but i'm not sure that ibm will concentrate too much on further development of the g5 or it's production. i'm sure there will be further development but not enough to handle a complete product range. maybe just the high end pm's until intel revs up the development of a consumer model high end 64 bit processor. i note that there was no mention, that i saw, of the new yonah processor from intel. i guess we will all find out what's going on, next week. should be interesting. p
