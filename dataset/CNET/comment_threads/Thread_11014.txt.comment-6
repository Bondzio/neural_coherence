I've prepared myself for the possibility of doing just that- swapping out logic boards, but somewhere- and I can't find the bookmark- I read that I can use my firmware chip on the donor board so a total match in firmware revision isn't critical.
Since this seems to be a widely 'popular' problem, certain drives are becoming extinct and prohibitively expensive to find an exact match.
