Lately when using the Automatic Document Feeder (ADF), the pages are coming out with one single thin vertical black line. If I am using the flatbed, the copy comes up perfectly normal. Also printed pages are coming up normal. I have asked Hewlett Packard for an answer but they did not bother to answer. Any suggestion would be appreciated. Jon

But it's a well known failure. What will drive you nuts is that with all these low costs, spare parts are usually non-existent. Bob
