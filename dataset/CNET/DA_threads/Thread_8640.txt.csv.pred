1.1.1	hi guys .	St
1.1.2	im trying to find a bday present for my girl and i remembered shes been moaning about not having wireless printing capability .	St
1.1.3	i figure it might have been a hint ... shes got a brother hl-5140 printer and a sony pcg - frv25 laptop .	St
1.1.4	i cant find anything to work with her printer other than brother 's expensive wireless print server .	St
1.1.5	and i dont think her laptop has bluetooth .	St
1.1.6	any help is appreciated .	Polite
1.1.7	thanks !	Polite
1.2.1	I have an SMC 70004AWBR router with built in print server .	St
1.2.2	Works fine with that but I 've looked to replace it and all the print servers I 've looked at , both wired and wireless , explictly say they do n't support it .	St
1.2.3	Do you really need a wireless print server ?	Ques
1.2.4	Right now I have the old router plugged into the new one just so I can use it as a print server .	St
1.2.5	The best I 've seen is to replace the printer with a Brother HL-2070N which I 've seen on sale after rebates for $ 125 or so and it has built in eithernet .	St
1.3.1	no i dont think wireless printing is needed , but until i can come up with something better than wireless printing..im out of luck .	St
1.3.2	i will keep looking .	St
1.3.3	thanks !	Polite
