<s> when I plug my new flash drive into a usb port it shows up ok as a removable drive but when I try to access the contents, I get the msg &quot;device not ready&quot; Apparently the computer cannot read the drive. </s>
<s> Any suggestions or help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I forgot to include that I am running winXP home sp2 </s>
<s> While I would try the stick on another machine to see if it's a good one, the lack of machine details as well was if you tried it on the rear USB ports could help. </s>
