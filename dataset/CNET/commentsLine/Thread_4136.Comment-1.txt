i recently had to purchase a new router to accomodate a fifth computer added to our lan (our router only had 4 ports).
i know most routers will control other routers attached to it automatically, so i added another 4 port router (actually, all i could find was a 4 port switch, is this the same thing?).
is there any additional security gained from being behind two routers, and thus behind two hardware firewalls?
