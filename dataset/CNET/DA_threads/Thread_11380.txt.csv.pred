1.1.1	i am looking into parts for a new computer that i am going to build soon, and i need some help with picking out a psu and cpu heatsink.	St
1.1.2	so far i have picked: a GIGABYTE GA-M57SLI-S4 mobo w/ nvidia sli 570 chipset amd athlon 64 x2 3800+ 2 nvidia 7950 gt graphics cards (sli) 6 western digital hard drives (4x250gb and 2 x 500gb) a silverstone lc20 case (it lies flat and i am planning to keep it up on my desk w/ my screen sitting on it) i will have 1 or 2 gb of ram and i already hav an old screen and keyboard and mouse from my current comp.	St
1.1.3	i would like to get the Hiper Type R 730W psu but i dont kno if it will fit correctly in the case.	St
1.1.4	and as for the cpu heatsink i am pretty much open to suggestions (but no watercooled) here's the url for the case if you want to take a look http://www.silverstonetek.com/products/lc20/lc20.html	St
1.2.1	that's a low-end cpu and doesn't need exceptional cooling.	St
1.3.1	for cooling the Chipset et al?	St
1.3.2	Will the heat pipes function adequately in that orientation??	St
1.3.3	?	Ques
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	i just looked at your whole setup again, and i have to ask - why?	St
1.5.2	dual 7950gt are going to run you at least $380 which is more than a 8800gts 640mb card (evga's is $370).	St
1.5.3	the 8800gts is faster than a 7950gx2 in almost all new games so it's clearly a better choice than 7950gt-sli unless you already have 1 7950gt card.	St
1.5.4	and why are wimping out with an x2 3800+ ($90)???	St
1.5.5	overclocked its going to top out around 2.7ghz so why not just get rid of 1 250gb drive and get a x2 5000+ (2.6ghz, $170) right off the bat?	St
1.5.6	or switch camps and get an e4300/e6300 ($170/180) and OC it up 2.8-3ghz.	St
1.5.7	it'll be much faster than any x2.	St
1.5.8	and 6 hard drives?	St
1.5.9	simplify and go with 4 500GBs... less heat and fewer potential headaches.	St
1.6.1	i think that ill do that w/ the 4 500gb hdds thanks	Polite
1.7.1	im kind new at this (this is my first home build) so im not to sure about over clocking but would going up to the next level processcor be a good idea?	St
1.8.1	i think ill go with the single 8800 cause that would also save some space inside the case.	Sug
1.9.1	i know that amd is coming out w/ more quad core processcors latter this year so should i hold off and wait unitl those come out and see the prices on the new processcors?	St
1.10.1	I definitely agree on going with a single 8800gts vs. the 7950 in sli.	St
1.10.2	You'll get better performance and will have DirectX 10 support for future games.	St
1.10.3	Also, if I were you, I would wait a few weeks (late April) for the price drops on the Intel Core 2 Duo CPUs.	St
1.10.4	It's no secret that they out perform the AMD Dual Cores and you'll be able to get them at very competitive prices.	St
1.11.1	that sounds nice but i spent too much time picking out the mobo and cpu heatsink to go and have to do it all over again.	St
1.11.2	also, athlon 64's were designed from the start to be expandable up to 16 cores plus im gonna use it for losts of gaming and multimedia work.	St
1.11.3	also, i know that amd is going to be coming out w/ a new series of chaeper quad cores some time this spring/summer so if i wait ill wait for that.	St
1.12.1	to find and Intel based CPU C2D solution.	St
1.12.2	I have an AMD now but I bought that a long time ago with the idea in mind of upgrading the CPU...from an AMD64-3000+ to an X2 4800+.	St
1.12.3	However, if I were building new from scratch today...Intel is clearly the 'CPU of choice' today...and there are Intel CPU based motherboards that allow you to upgrade to Quad Cores now or when the urge strikes.	St
1.12.4	You've rec'd some good advice here... be smart enough to take it.	St
1.12.5	Intel is CPU of choice for what you can build with today or the immediate future.	St
1.12.6	VAPCMD	St
1.13.1	i will look into it.	St
1.13.2	thanks	Polite
1.14.1	if i get an intel which socket should i get?	St
1.15.1	http://www.tomshardware.com..they 've got to good articles and charts allowing you compare CPUs, video cards, hard drives, etc., VAPCMD	St
1.16.1	That Hiper, although good, has osme issues.	St
1.16.2	For just a few dollars more you can have a well recommended PSU.	St
1.16.3	Superb quality, too - a Corsair HX620W.	St
1.16.4	144.90 @ ZipZoomFly http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=373110 Don't let the wattage confuse you.	St
1.16.5	Here's a review of the Corsair by the planet's best PSU tester: http://www.jonnyguru.com/review_details.php?id=32	St
