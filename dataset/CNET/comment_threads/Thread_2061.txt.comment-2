Go to http://www.anandtech.com and read the AMD road map info.
Even though they more or less said that they would support the 754 socket for a while, it is obvious that they won't.
Look at the new 90 NM CPU's for the socket 939 mobo's.
Great price and performance and much better thermal performance.
