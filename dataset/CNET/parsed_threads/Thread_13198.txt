<s> I've recently brought an old-ish computer from a friend, so you can imagine not all the install cds/manuals are there. </s>
<s> The sound system is an Altec Lansing ADA885. </s>
<s> The left/right and surround speakers are working fine, however, no sound is coming from the subwoofer. </s>
<s> The subwoofer is on and it does pass it's own diagnostic check (press a button-&gt;makes a sound). </s>
<s> All the connections are fine. </s>
<s> However, it never makes a sound in any windows application or game. </s>
<s> Could it be a soundcard issue? </s>
<s> I'm using Creative Sound Blaster! </s>
<s> Value card. </s>
<s> It's updated to their newest version. </s>
<s> In the SB control program, there is an option to select 2 or 4 speaker, but none for subwoofer. </s>
<s> Is it supposed to be that way? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help, I'm very new to this. </s>

<s> Go to Control Panel/Sound and under sound Playback you pick the speaker layout. </s>
<s> The card you have does support the subwoofer. </s>

<s> I've tried just about every one of those, without any success. </s>
<s> The surround sound speaker setting should at least get the woofer working. </s>
<s> Maybe the speaker is defective, or is plugged in incorrectly. </s>
<s> You should be getting sounds from it. </s>
