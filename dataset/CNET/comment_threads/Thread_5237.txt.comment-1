Firstly, Hi to all, first post on here!!
I have just taken delivery of a 40gb external HDD for my laptop (i have included a link to the model if it helps anyone http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/New-40GB-2-5-External-HDD-Hard-Disk-Drive-USB-2-0-UK_W0QQitemZ230119554417QQihZ013QQcategoryZ16178QQcmdZViewItem ), i use an Acer Aspire 30003lc xp sp2, My problem is that when ever I unplug (i get and audible tone) and then plug back in, the &quot;hardware wizard&quot; opens and says that it detects new hardware and asks me to install the Software for it?
I had a drivers disk send with it, and installed what files were on it, but nothing has changed, when i emailed the sellers they said that it is plug and play and i dont need drivers for it?
(so why send me a disk with drivers then?)
but i had to install them to even make my laptop find the device in the first place, I have taken the drive to a friends today and plugged in into his desktop and it worked perfectly straight away, no drivers to install, as it should be, can anyone offer my any advice as to why my laptop detects it as &quot;new hardware&quot; everytime i plug it in, I look forward to any help or advice on offer, Cheers Froggy
