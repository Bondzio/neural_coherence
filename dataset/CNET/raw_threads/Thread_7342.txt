Now want to sell it and get a laptop. Where do I start? How can I get my desktop in a saleable condition, i.e. get everything off it? Any help greatly appreciated!

After you DBAN it, restore it and it's ready. Sadly I see these go for 99 bucks all the time on Ebay. http://cgi.ebay.com/Dell-Dimension-E310---P4-2.8G-256MB-70G-DVD_W0QQitemZ320413436845QQcmdZViewItemQQimsxZ20090818?IMSfp=TL090818154001r1808 You may want to consider just offering it without all the work on the hard drive (just DBAN it) and then put it out to freecycle.
