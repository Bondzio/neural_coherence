<s> Hello, I connect to my company server through a VPN and must sync with a server folder for a program we use. </s>
<s> The network drive will not map unless the VPN connection is completed first. </s>
<s> As I usually use my company laptop for this purpose, I have found that if I check off the &quot;reconnect at log on&quot; box while mapping the network drive, it fails to do so at login because the VPN is not yet connected. </s>
<s> I tried adding the VPN shortcut to my start up program but Windows trys to logon the network drive prior to processing this folder. </s>
<s> Can I set this up so that the VPN will connect first and then map the drive afterwards, each time I start up my laptop? </s>
<s> I am using Windows XP Pro and shut down the laptop after each use for transport. </s>
<s> Thanks Mike </s>
<s> Mike, I recently ran into the same problem here at my company. </s>
<s> We use Cisco Systems VPN Client. </s>
<s> Logon to the computer and open up the VPN. </s>
<s> Go to options and then click on &quot;Windows Logon Properties&quot;. </s>
<s> A new box will open...select &quot;Enable Start Before Logon&quot;. </s>
<s> Essentially this will cause the VPN to start right when the user hits Ctrl+Alt+Del. </s>
<s> This should resolve the drive mapping issue. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
