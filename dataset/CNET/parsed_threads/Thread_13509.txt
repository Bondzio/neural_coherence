<s> I have been having the same issue now for a few weeks, my computer shuts off without warning. </s>
<s> It shuts off when in idle and also when running labor intensive programs, but not simple tasks like surfing the web or using MS Word. </s>
<s> I keep getting the following event notice: Kernel-Power 41 (63) error. </s>
<s> I have checked everything that I can find on the web, including the help page from Microsoft, and followed all of the tips. </s>
<s> I am at a loss as to what is next. </s>
<s> I have checked my psu and it has very good voltage readings. </s>
<s> I have checked all connections, checked for loose parts and screws that may be causing shorts. </s>
<s> I have checked by bios settings as well as my power option settings. </s>
<s> The only thing I can think could be the problem is the mobo, the cpu, or the ram. </s>
<s> I lean more to the cpu because (according to the windows 7 gadget meter), my cpu was running at almost 100% before it shut off last night. </s>
<s> Now that doesn't account for why it shuts off during idle, but it may be a clue. </s>
<s> In case you are wondering, I have also checked the thermal compound. </s>
<s> I have the following: EVGA nForce 790i Ultra SLI Motherboard - NVIDIA nForce 790i Ultra SLI, Socket 775, ATX, Audio, PCI Express 2.0, SLI Ready, S/PDIF, USB 2.0, Firewire, eSATA, RAID XFX GeForce 9800 GTX + Video Card - 512MB DDR3, PCI Express 2.0, SLI Ready, (Dual Link) Dual DVI, HDTV, VGA Support Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 Processor BX80580Q8200 - 2.33GHz, 4MB Cache, 1333MHz FSB, Quad Core, Retail, Socket 775 HITACHI 1TB and 3TB SERIAL ATA HD Kingwin Mach 1 Modular Power Supply - 1220-Watt, ATX, SLI-Ready, Six 12V Rails Corsair XMS3 2048MB Dual Channel PC10600 DDR3 1333MHz Memory (2 x 1024MB) Your help would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Did you try the old cover off tests? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I'm seeing 8800 and 9800 video cards failing now. </s>
<s> Do you have another card to swap in if the cover off test doesn't show any changes? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> &quot;Six 12V Rails&quot; Now comes the REALLY HARD QUESTION. </s>
<s> If this has SIX Rails, how did you balance them? </s>
<s> And this is why I tell folk to get SINGLE RAIL power supplies. </s>
<s> To avoid learning this the hard way. </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> If you are referring to whether or not I took the cover off to let more air in, well not exactly. </s>
<s> I did take my cover off becuase I was looking for a noising fan (what I thought was the problem), and even with the cover off and a new fan, the computer was still shuting down. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I do not have a spare video card 3. </s>
<s> While I know how to plug my parts in, I guess I don't know what it means to balance the rails or how to balance the rails. </s>
<s> Can you provide more information? </s>
<s> https://www.google.com/search?q=PC+POWER+SUPPLY+BALANCE+THE+RAILS In short it means you take care to balance the load across the rails so that no single rail gets over taxed. </s>
<s> This is why I tell folk that don't want to learn this stuff to get a single rail PSU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Would &quot;balancing&quot; mean anything if I have been running great since 2009? </s>
<s> I have only made the following changes: 1. better fan for cpu 2. added a 3tb hd 3. changed the fan on the 3tb hd two times 4. had the dvd drive replaced on a warrenty issue The only things that were added new to the psu was the 3tb hd and the its fan. </s>
<s> Everything was going great. </s>
<s> Then one day the computer turned its self on from a standby state then shut down completely. </s>
<s> Since that day, it has been nothing but problems. </s>
<s> I can't even identify the problem correctly to be able to identify the solution. </s>
<s> Balancing the psu is a new solution, so I will try that. </s>
<s> But no. </s>
<s> It does not mean much as the parts age and a new PSU has spare power and now it's failing. </s>
<s> Not the PSU but since no one did the balancing or even knew, it's one of the areas I keep encountering. </s>
<s> I think you may be thinking that the PSU is always the same. </s>
<s> Does not age? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The first thing I did was purchase a new psu because I was certain that was the problem, but when I checked the levels, they were good. </s>
<s> I know psu's along with all the parts age. </s>
<s> Go over on one and it usually shuts down. </s>
<s> From our chat here it appears this is news to you and new to you as well. </s>
<s> Next time, get a single rail and try another video card. </s>
