Hello, All, After reading CNET's recent newsletter article about the poor guy whose laptop was stolen from his hotel, I'd like to try password protecting my hard drive. My data is backed up via Carbonite for my own needs, but I'd hate for the thing to get stolen and have some hack get my stuff. I understand that some PCs offer the option to password protect HDs and some don't. I have an HP Pavilion dv9500t, Vista Premium--any idea whether this is a possibility for me? And if so, where can I find a how-to? I've tried searching the computer's own HELP function and got nothin'. Thanks!

Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, encryption isn't available on my version of Vista (home premium). And if the encryption file is on the HD, then wouldn't it be easy to take the HD and put it in another computer and read it anyway? Does anyone know if the HD password is an option for my computer?

Given the losses I've seen I can't reccomend such titles. Bob

Most likely they will erase and use the drive space. If you lose the password your drive could be toast. So many people call us at tech with this issue and most times the news is bad and they then wonder why they protected the hd.. Do it if you must but wonder if you must..
