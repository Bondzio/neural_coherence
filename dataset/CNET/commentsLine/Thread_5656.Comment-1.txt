i have a second pc that i rarely use anymore.
but recently while running it really loud noises started in the tower and then the screen froze up.
i ended up shutting it down by pulling the plug, was the only way.
when i plugged it back up i got a message saying no c drive detected.........and the noise came back....ok my question is what happened and should i try to fix it?
if so what could it be?
and / or should i just throw it out?
