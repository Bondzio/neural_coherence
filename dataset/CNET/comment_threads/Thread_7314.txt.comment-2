I only buy stuff from newegg.com The 2x256 is just $1 cheaper; look here: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145477 and here: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145026 So I'd get the 1 stick of 512, so that I could later upgrade to 1GB.
Or just buy 1GB right now.
Get the 1GB as 2 sticks of 512 so that you can have dual channel.
