1.1.1	I have a wireless router on my computer and a couple of days ago every time I try to get on the internet it gives me blank pages and I have to hit refresh or go several times so that I can access the internet .	St
1.1.2	Does anyone know what the problem could be the laptop that I have a wireless connection is doing the same thing .	St
1.1.3	Before I bought the wireless router I had a hard wired router and I thought maybe it would work if I put it back on and it does the same exact thing .	St
1.1.4	Maybe its my computer or I dont know .	St
1.1.5	If anyone can help me out I would appreciate it .	Polite
1.1.6	I connected my cable modem directly to my computer without the router and it works fine no problems .	St
1.1.7	It only happens when I have the router connected .	St
1.1.8	Just to let you know I have a D-Link DI-604 and DI-524 ( wireless ) routers .	St

1.2.1	The dl 524 is the one I use and it was problematic until I updated the firmware to version 1.11 which is from March 2005 .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Would that cause to happen to both routers cause prior to a few days ago they worked great and I never had a problem with them even when I first installed it .	St
1.3.2	I do n't know if I mentioned it but the power in our house went out and after that it started giving me problems .	St
1.3.3	Do you think replacing the ethernet cables would work ?	Ques
1.3.4	Thanks	Polite
