While you can use them as such, all too often they can lose it.
Just google and find many users having the same issue, lost access or ability to retrieve.
The flash drives are great for &quot;temporary storage&quot; or xfer from one system to the next.
Excluding any s/w glitch it may have succumb to ESD(static) damage or possible OS hi-jinks.
The same recovery tools can be used as any other storage device, google away.
Some are free to use or test results then buy.
I suggest you look at these &quot;file websites&quot; that provide such pgms.
