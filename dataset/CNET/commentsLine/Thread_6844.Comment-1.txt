hey cnet i have googled for a few days and nothing has helped so far with my problem.
i bought a kingston microsd card 32gb for my htc desire hd but i am obviously having some issues with it (the card): when i put music and pictures on the card, and then try to play from the card or on my htc, only the first few songs i copied over will be recognized, similar problem with pictures.
also, when i have put files on there in the past, they have just disappeared but would still take up the allocated space on the card eg, 30gb of space, put on 5gb of music, the music isn't there but only 25gb of space left.
also, when i put the card into my htc it shows me an alert saying 'sd card read only', but i have constantly tried to change it to not read-only.
i really am getting pretty frustrated by this, so any ideas and help are greatly appreciated.
