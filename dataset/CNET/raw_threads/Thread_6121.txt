I've determined so far that the iPad would have to be a 3rd. generation device for this to work, but would the iPhone and iPad then have to usb'd together, or on Bluetooth, or how exactly would this work? Thanks much for your advice.

'Learn how to share your cellular data connection using Personal Hotspot, the Internet-sharing feature on iPhone, iPad (3rd generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular or later, and iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular.' What you're saying is good news of course, but I had read this from the Apple site earlier and assumed that when I get the iPad it should/must be a 3rd gen. model. Maybe they're just trying to upsell me? Thanks
