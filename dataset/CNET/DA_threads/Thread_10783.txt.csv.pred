1.1.1	Hey guys, I just bought a new 250GB hard drive for my computer and I installed it as my slave drive, I already have a 40GB hard drive installed as my master.	St
1.1.2	I installed my new game (resident evil 4) onto the new hard drive (F drive) everything worked fine.	St
1.1.3	I played the game for a couple minutes but then I decided to update it because apparently the game is 100x's better if you update.	St
1.1.4	My issue is...	St
1.1.5	When I go to update the game, I save the download onto my old drive (C Drive) and when I click run, the program does not read that my game is located on my F drive and it says that the game is not installed, it's only reading whats on my C drive.	St
1.1.6	How do I make it work?	Sug
1.1.7	PLEASE Thanks, Travis PS: I'm running Windows XP if that helps?	St
1.2.1	That is strange.	St
1.2.2	You can see both drives in My Computer?	St
1.2.3	Does your BIOS see both drives?	St
1.2.4	is this a SATA drive?	St
1.2.5	I'm sure you have rebooted and tried installing the update again.	St
1.2.6	Windows Should be able to know that you have another drive?	St
1.3.1	Create a folder on your F drive....call it TEMP.	St
1.3.2	Download the update.	St
1.3.3	When it asks where to save it to....point it at the F drive temp folder.	St
1.3.4	After that's done.	St
1.3.5	Navigate to the F drive temp folder and run the updater.	St
1.4.1	i tired both but it still does not read that the game is on a different hard drive.	St
1.4.2	thanks for trying tho	Polite
1.5.1	Possible that the update installer is looking for the game on drive C. If this is true you may have to contact the games Mnf for a work around.	St
1.5.2	Bill	St
