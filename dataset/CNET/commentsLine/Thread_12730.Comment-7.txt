in a problem like this i would plan ahead.
what will you eb doing in the future?
thiknig of upgrading to a fast broadband connection ever?
in which case the 812.11g will be needed.
also, anything for 812.11 is compatable with 802.11g!
my advice would be to get a g network and use b equipment on it until you need to upgrade to g equipment when you need the speed
