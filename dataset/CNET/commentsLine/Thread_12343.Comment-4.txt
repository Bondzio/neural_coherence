sorry, i have windows xp pro.
it was also installed on the other hard drive.
i accidentally installed it there when i was doing a re-install.
i formatted that drive, but it still asks me to choose between the two &quot;microsoft windows xp professional&quot; os's.
but it's only on my c drive.
the d drive has nothing on it.
hope this clears up the confusion.
clint
