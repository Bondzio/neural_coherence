1.1.1	We woke up one morning to find that our computer would n't go past the HP screen .	St
1.1.2	An internet search revealed the problem was probably a bad hard drive .	St
1.1.3	So we bought a new one from a computer store and I installed it .	St
1.1.4	I could n't get into BIOS to tell it to locate the new drive , though .	St
1.1.5	Afterwards , I went to use the system recovery discs purchased from HP , but it 's not working .	St
1.1.6	I 've gotten two errors : 0xc00000e9 , and 0xe0ef0003 .	St
1.1.7	On a couple of occasions , I got to the HP recovery disc option screen , and first tried choosing to & quot ; restore to factory & quot ; and then , when that failed , tried telling it to check the computer .	St
1.1.8	It responded that I needed to put in the first recovery disc ( the one it was operating off of !	St
1.1.9	) , so I removed it and reinserted it , but it refused to recognize it and the drive door became unresponsive until I 'd restarted the computer .	St
1.1.10	Now , I ca n't even get to the HP recovery screen options - the error messages shut things down .	St
1.1.11	My husband and I are both students - we need this computer for our classes , and I 'm completely out of ideas .	St
1.1.12	I 'm not an expert - this was my first shot at even installing a hard drive ( I used the HP whitepaper on it , and am pretty sure things went OK with that - although this failure is demoralizing ) .	St
1.1.13	Is there anyone out there who can give me a heads up on what to do ?	Ques
1.1.14	I read after installing the HD that HP puts a secret partition so only hard drives bought from them will boot with recovery discs - is that the problem ?	Ques
1.1.15	ARRGH ! !	St
1.1.16	!	St
1.2.1	may not be your hard disk .	St
1.2.2	It could be your CMOS setting is corrupt , or worse , a failed chip somewhere .	St
1.2.3	Try to reset the CMOS first to see if it will then boot recovery CD successfully .	St
1.2.4	Consult your manual or online for how to reset CMOS .	St
1.3.1	I hope you entered the bios and made the 1st boot device the CD/DVD drive in order to proceed quickly to boot from disc and saved before exiting .	St
1.3.2	Otherwise , it will error or complain and try to boot from HD and then goto the restore disc ( CD drive ) .	St
1.3.3	If already done and set in the bios , then you may have a further issue .	St
1.3.4	HP and other provide a 2nd partition on their HDs to access the restore/recovery process .	St
1.3.5	Also , this is where the creation of making your own restore/recovery discs for you usage if needed .	St
1.3.6	Replacing the HD , of course removes that option .	St
1.3.7	Provided you have working restore discs , then it should the process .	St
1.3.8	You say you have them but encounter problems .	St
1.3.9	Excluding any other issue , & quot ; do you trust the restore discs & quot ; ?	Ques
1.3.10	If these are factory provided , then OK , if you made them some doubt maybe at work .	St
1.3.11	Otherwise , in most cases it should have started the recovery process .	St
1.3.12	The other half of this is not a recovery issue but a true h/w fault with the mtrbd. , bios , or related cause .	St
1.3.13	If you have warranty , then use it .	St
1.3.14	You can post your query in the HP forum here and see where it leads .	Sug
1.3.15	You maybe asked to drop this one and/or be informed of any continuation of this thread .	St
1.3.16	FYI- I have found HP issues to be problematic in the last few yrs .	St
1.3.17	and resolving them more hassle than encountered before .	St
1.3.18	While success is at hand , too often only a new part or factory supplied one seems to resolve the problem .	St
1.3.19	Basically , IMHO it seems more constricted to apply true tested fixes from the past .	St
1.3.20	& lt ; div & gt ; tada -- -- -Willy & lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.4.1	CMOS is reset by removing the button battery , yes ?	Ques
1.4.2	If so , then I have done that , both before and after replacing the drive .	St
1.4.3	The discs are from the manufacturer .	St
1.4.4	So , according to you guys , I can trust them .	St
1.4.5	As far as changing any settings in BIOS , I ca n't even get to it .	St
1.4.6	The computer gets as far as the HP screen , then freezes there .	St
1.4.7	I 've tried repeatedly pressing the button that would cause it to go to the options shown on the HP screen - not sure which one leads to BIOS , but I think it 's the one that you press ESC for .	St
1.4.8	Does n't do anything - either I ca n't get in before it freezes , or the new drive lacks anything on it for it to go to .	St
1.4.9	The computer does start to run the recovery disc and gets as far as the recovery homepage , so it knows it 's there and is able to access it .	St
1.4.10	But I ca n't get it to do anything from the disc .	St
1.4.11	Any chance replacing the SATA cable would fix this ?	Ques
1.4.12	Or is this for sure something like the motherboard ?	Ques
1.4.13	( Computer is about three years old and out of warranty . )	St
1.5.1	do homework , like researching and reading manufacturers instructions on paper or online , before diving in .	St
1.5.2	In your case , since 'all else failed ' , what have you got to lose by reading the manual ?	Ques
1.5.3	Clues : the CMOS reset is usually a DIP switch but may vary by models , so read and find it !	St
1.5.4	The BIOS entry is usually F10 for HP but again may vary , so read and find it !	St
1.5.5	When you get to recovery CD homepage , what does it offer ?	Ques
1.5.6	Make sure kybd and mouse are ok .	St
1.5.7	If USB type , plug in another port to try .	St
1.5.8	Stop fixating on hard disk as root cause .	St
1.5.9	And hardware does die , but less often than most owners think , unless broken by their owners .	St
1.5.10	Troubleshooting and fixing a PC takes time and logic .	St
1.5.11	Impatience is not a virtue .	St
1.6.1	I read the manual when I first got the computer .	St
1.6.2	It does n't mention CMOS , DIP , or BIOS .	St
1.6.3	Checked the HP website , which was no help on resetting CMOS , but according to what I read online in other forums , removing the button battery should 've done it .	St
1.6.4	No information in the manual on BIOS , but since I ca n't get into it , that probably would n't help me anyway .	St
1.6.5	The keyboard is working , as is the mouse .	St
1.6.6	The CD recovery homepage offers two options .	St
1.6.7	One is to check the computer 's functioning .	St
1.6.8	The other is to restore to factory default .	St
1.6.9	I 've tried both .	St
1.6.10	Neither of them work .	St
1.7.1	Hitting the F2 , F10 or F11 key during boot-up repeatedly should get you into the bios , also called CMOS .	St
1.7.2	One of those keys should do it .	St
1.7.3	Sometimes , HP is generic in providing info as they are similar to various HP models , so do n't be too disconcerted if not directly to your model # .	St
