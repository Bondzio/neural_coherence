<s> I have a Hitachi external hard disk, I have tons of extremely important files inside. </s>
<s> It was still working fine last night until this morning. </s>
<s> This is what happened: I plugged in the hard disk, than it is seen as Local Disk (h:). </s>
<s> It prompts me to format the disk once I double clicked it. </s>
<s> Please help me!! </s>
<s> I have really important files in it! </s>
<s> Thanks lots in advance! </s>
<s> I've tried reading this External WD not being identified - Local Disk (h:) : Hard Disk Drives: data recovery and repairbut I couldnt understand, can someone tell me if it works and how to do it? </s>
<s> Im not good in this kind of things.Please help, thanks! </s>
<s> the many post addressing your exact problem. </s>
<s> You can try attaching the drive to another system Try other USB Cables Try the drive in another enclosure Try the bare drive inside the inside the system case. </s>
<s> (laptops excluded) If those don't work....there's data recovery services that will be glad to take your hard earned $$ in hopes of recovering your priceless data.. Only then will you realize a single data source with no backup is really a bad data management model. </s>
