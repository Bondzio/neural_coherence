so basically i've recently brough a nice new gaming pc , the acer predator g7200 it has 2.5ghz , x2 ati radeon 4850's , 4gb ram, amd phenom 9850 quad core processor.
but i recently downloaded counter strike and call of duty 4 and i get around 5-10 fps?
what is wrong?.
i have tryed.. disabling one of the graphics cards didnt work updating all the drivers and processor drivers , operating system - which is windows vista 64-bit i have confirmed it is not my internet because i receive the same lag offline on single player or a private lobby of a game such as cod 4. what is wrong?
i desperetly need an answer.
this computer cost alot of money and i don't want it not to work within a week of buying it..
