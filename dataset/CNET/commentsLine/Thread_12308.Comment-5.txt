today they all are pretty reliable and for me it boils down to cost.
realiablity is really just a matter of luck and if you are unlucky no matter which brand you choose could end up being flaky.
but i don't care, hard drive are cheap and as long as i got my data backed up, i have no worries.
just my 2 cents.
cheers!
