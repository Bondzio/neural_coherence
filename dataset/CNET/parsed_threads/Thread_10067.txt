<s> Recheck your work again, don't take anything for granted. </s>
<s> Next time it starts to boot, enter the bios section, verify *all* setting and if it can do that alone, very probable the psu is OK, however keep that in mind. </s>
<s> Once you verified or reset any bios setting, save upon exit and reboot. </s>
<s> It should error or not and hopefully finish the boot process. </s>
<s> If th problem returns, replace the bios/CMOS battery. </s>
<s> After replacing the battery, follow the above instructions again, what are the results now. </s>
<s> If it boots, great you had a bad battery. </s>
<s> If not, reduce the psu strain and make the system as simple as possible. </s>
<s> If it appears it boots with no HD or CD drives attached then suspect the psu is weak or failing, replace with better one. </s>
<s> Check results after replacing psu. </s>
<s> Some of the common reboot reasons is power safe feature in bios set to reboot upon error or a heat setting reached. </s>
<s> Check those values under whatever name they have, disable or uncheck them, retry for results. </s>
<s> Look into areas... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> here i would like to add one more thing which i forget that i had pluged off my cd -rom as it is not working properly ... so as i mentioned that i also pluged off my hardisk drive 160 gb sata 2 ... so i think psu must hv enough volatge/current atleast to handle single mobo and graphic card.... no i am on the same pc which is having prob since 3 hours but there is no prob yet but i can expect as it suddenly comes with out expecting.... one more thing the red led light of case which i think used for hardisk and blinks on/off as the busy work of hrdisk ... now keeps on glow how ever hardisk drive is connected or not ...but it keeps on glowing... can i say its some short circuit prob in mobo ? </s>
<s> Upon disconnecting any device it must be 100%, fully unplugged. </s>
<s> Then refresh the bios of that new status. </s>
<s> If the LED glow continues it maybe a problem, but I wouldn't jump on that alone. </s>
<s> If all proves fruitless, then you may have a bad mtrbd.. Its possible to remove from system and test(cardboard surface) on the old kitchen table and see what gives. </s>
<s> If problem persists then basically, you've done all you can, new parts? </s>
<s> You say you tried another psu, that psu must be equal or even better than old one. </s>
<s> Don't suspect because it worked elsewhere, review what specs it provides, again don't take anything for granted. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> You didn't share what you used. </s>
<s> Also, tell us what you did to research every BIOS setting. </s>
<s> I was not happy to learn on a few boards you had to change the RAM supply voltage manually. </s>
<s> But then again it's something a home builder would expect. </s>

<s> i am inspecting my pc oon trial basis since last night and it was working all fine but today morning it again starts restarting again and again ... now what i did is taken out my mobo from case and re-asemble it on the non electrolytic sheet and make it ON .... things are looking fine ... still observing .... i think it might be a prob of some over heating inside my mobo .... as here summer is arrived ... with in a week i will face humid weather. </s>
<s> since 3 hours ... no such restarting prob accur but i am still expecting but i pray if it dont happened again ... by the way what if i upgrade my bios software ? </s>
