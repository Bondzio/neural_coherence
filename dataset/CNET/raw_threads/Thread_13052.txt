Or are you saying that you live outside the States and they don't ship there? Tell us what you want in a BTX case and why what is available there doesn't suit you. Once you know a case model, you can use Froogle.com to locate other stores that carry it. Some cases are bi - you can get a BX conversion kit. Really not practical to make BTX-only cases any more as their raison d'etre is largely gone (increasing CPU temps). Another great (greatly flawed!) idea from Intel like split-channel PSUs. .bh.
