<s> I have a Samsung 174v lcd monitor, for some reason it just shuts off. </s>
<s> I can manually turn the monitor off then back on again and it will work for a few seconds then it turns off again. </s>
<s> Sometimes like now it will stay on then for no reason it shuts off again. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what is causing this? </s>

<s> Thanks...... </s>
<s> There's a long discussion in one of the forums about some HP model. </s>
<s> Turns out a bad solder connection was it's issue in many cases. </s>
<s> Are you the type that owns a solder iron and knows how to use it? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes I have one and can use it if I know exactly where the problem is. </s>
<s> Are the HPs made by Samsung? </s>
<s> But the issue was easy to spot once you have the boards out and inspecting them. </s>
<s> I take it you can't look it over? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> On my laptop now the monitor won't come on at all except for a few seconds. </s>
<s> So, do I need to just take this monitor apart and the problem you say will be easy to spot? </s>
<s> Then just solder the bad connections? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help...... </s>
<s> &quot;So, do I need to just take this monitor apart and the problem you say will be easy to spot? </s>
<s> Then just solder the bad connections?&quot; What choice is there and if it's a bad solder joint then all that's left is how good an inspector you are and whether you find it. </s>
<s> Some won't dive in because they are afraid to break it. </s>
<s> Let me write this. </s>
<s> It's broken so we can proceed without fear. </s>
<s> And repair at a shop exceeds replacement cost so what is there to fear but ____ itself? </s>

<s> And I don't see anything that looks unusual, do you know which board it would be on, looks like there are 2 one for the power and the other for I would assume the monitor screen. </s>
<s> Through hold components like capacitors and ferrite beads or coils. </s>
<s> What I do is reflow the solder on the bigger through hole parts. </s>
<s> Keep a keen eye for scorch marks, blown parts, etc. </s>
<s> That is &quot;the usual&quot; defects. </s>
<s> There is no &quot;do this&quot; in such expeditions or repairs. </s>
<s> If it was then repairs would be cheap. </s>

<s> I'm not a electronics techie but I tried, couldn't find anything wrong even when using a magnifying glass. </s>
<s> i put it back togethr and it does the same thing. </s>
<s> Looks like i'm going to have to buy me another monitor which really ticks me off since this one is only about 3 years old. </s>
<s> Samsung is no longer an option and i'm going to go with a 19&quot; this time. </s>
<s> I just use it for surfing no game playing etc. </s>
<s> here, any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks again for the help...... </s>
<s> If reflowing parts doesn't work I pull out some freeze spray and see if freezing a part makes it work. </s>
<s> Then I replace that part. </s>
<s> I'll take it that you reflowed solder where ever you felt like it? </s>
<s> Some techs won't do that unless they 'know' it's bad. </s>
<s> I've cured a few just by going ahead with the reflow. </s>
<s> Again if there was a 'reflow here' sign or procedure then repairs would be easy and cheap but reality is something else. </s>
