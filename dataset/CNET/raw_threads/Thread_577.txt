Neither of them will turn on. the only thing that happens when they are pluged in is a high pitched buzzing comes from both of them. what could this be and is it worth it to try and get them repaired or should i just buy 2 new ones?

Compare similar types and see what new cost is, at least you got a chance at repair if LCD type as parts might be a part-in items, if you're capable. Otherwise, just move on. tada -----Willy
