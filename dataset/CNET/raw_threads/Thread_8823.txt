Lastly, what cards are good for me, and within the $40-$100 price range. I wish to stick with nvidia cause thats already what i have. and i might have to purchase this on the internet because its cheaper and all, but im not sure. for one thing, my parents arent fans of internet shopping. second, if for some reason i get the card and it doesnt work, im screwed. third, there isnt anyone to ask for help when buying the card.

Your link is busted, so the mainboard info is not available. You have not said what you want to do, and prices can be found here: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ThirdCategoryList.jsp?SecondCategoryCode=0122 This is a safe and reliable site, in my opinion.
