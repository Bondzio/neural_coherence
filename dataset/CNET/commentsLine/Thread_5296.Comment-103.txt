hi, i have purchased many computers over the years.
pc's for me mac for my kidz that insist that they have to have it.
i have had several hp's and they were great.
hp printers too they were run into the ground used way beyond the spec'd life.
check out zt systems.
you can't beat the price, i can't build it for the same cost.
i have my second one, an i7 860. not the fastest around but up there and 999.00 with a video card, expandable, has a large enough power supply to add stuff, no bloatware.
costco has it.
