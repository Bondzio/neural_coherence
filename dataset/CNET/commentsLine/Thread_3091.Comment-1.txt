i'm not in the repair or resale business, rather the school of why.
this was part of the compaq presario 4550 given to me last year.
it also contained cd-rom, floppy, and zip drives.
i only used the ethernet nic to backup data from my xp and then disconnected the power connection.
(syncback 5 stars!)
i have a guess why the 4550 was changed this way but not sure.
anyhow, this year i was given an hp pavilion 6746c.
i had to replace the psu, floppy, and hdd.
so, i traded the at psu(4550) for an atx, and the old floppy(4550) for another at my computer club.
then, i put the above hardware into the 6746c.
(celeron 733mhz) the more i read about ata the confusier i get.
i'm guessing this setup in the 6746c maybe should just be connected to the motherboard and remove the promise ide controller.
i still use the 6746c for backup to the xp system with an ethernet connection and syncback.
