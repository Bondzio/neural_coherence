<s> Hello everyone! </s>
<s> I am having an issue with sharing printers. </s>
<s> I have a Vista Desktop, Vista Laptop, and XP Desktop; the main source being the Vista Desktop (where the network is established). </s>
<s> I run Vista Home 32-bit on both the laptop and desktop, and the XP is the Home edition as well (SP2). </s>
<s> The Vista laptop can see and share files/printers with the Vista desktop, and the XP Desktop can see the network from the Vista desktop, but cannot see/locate any of the shared printers. </s>
<s> I've pinged each desktop IP address to the other desktop; I've made certain all of the workgroups were titled the same; it's not a firewall issue; and I've tried every other option listed on every forum I've come across the last 3 days, and still nothing. </s>
<s> I've even attepted to reset the router and start from scratch, with no help there, either. </s>
<s> Can someone help me, please? </s>
<s> If any other system/program information is needed to be supplied, please do not hesitate to ask; I need to get this established and running ASAP, as I run a business from home. </s>
<s> Thank you very much! </s>

<s> I can't tell if you installed the LLTD. </s>

<s> Bob - Yes, the File and Printer Sharing are both marked 'On'. </s>
<s> This may sound dumb, but what is LLTD? </s>
<s> I'm still learning how to set all of this up, and that's something I've not come across as of yet. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Noted in our forum sticky and at google.com. </s>
<s> Sorry but it's a common item so let's do a little research. </s>
