1.1.1	I originally had a Western Digital Hard drive specs are : 750 GB 7200 RPM 16MB Cache The drive I purchased to install with it was a Western Digital Caviar Black specs are : 640 GB 7200RPM 64MB Cache My problem is that once I received the new drive I wiped my computer and proceeded to install both drives everything installed fine .	St
1.1.2	I used the newer drive that has better specs for the C : drive partition and the old drive that is a little bigger as a D drive .	St
1.1.3	I 'm only going to have the two partitions and I was going to use the D for just installing games , for instance my steam games which I have a lot of .	St
1.1.4	Everything installed great .	St
1.1.5	Did n't really have a problem .	St
1.1.6	Seemed like the new drive was a little slow at some points but still worked out .	St
1.1.7	After I installed everything I 've noticed that when I go to access or just load up steam or navigate on it I get the loading cursor for a few seconds , I 'm not an impatient person but I mean it brings this up every few seconds for the simplest things.. like clicking on a particular game to view the page or initializing a game to install .	St
1.1.8	I was told that this could be that the old drive that I 'm putting just my games on ( D drive ) does n't have a paging file for it and that if it did this might clear it up but then I read somewhere that putting a paging file on a drive you will only see if a difference if the drive you put it on is faster than the other .	St
1.1.9	I 'm kind of confused about the whole thing can you put a paging file on two drives ?	Ques
1.1.10	Or can it just go on one ?	Ques
1.1.11	I just do n't really have any knowledge on this topic at all and was wondering if someone could up my understanding of this , and also if this would even make a difference and if so how do I do it ?	Ques
1.1.12	Thank you very much for any help .	St
