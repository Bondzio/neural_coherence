<s> I am booting XP Pro from a Maxtor SATA on an Abit AN7 (onboard sata controller - Silicon Image SiI3112) and I am experiencing very slow HDD writes. </s>
<s> It used to be over 40 MB/s but since a while (I don't remember since when) it is around 5 MB/s. </s>
<s> It writes ok for about 1 sec. </s>
<s> (untill the buffer is full) than it drops instantly. </s>
<s> I reinstalled XP, updated the bios, ran the diagnostic tools from maxtor, everithing was fine... where else should I look? </s>
<s> It's a XP thing. </s>
<s> Read http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=7297&messageID=85244 for a note and a link how to. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
