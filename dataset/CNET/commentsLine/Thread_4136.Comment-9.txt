i apologize for not replying sooner (i'll check the forum more often).
my home network is a single network, however i have configured the routers to provide back-to-back firewalls, and the voip phones enter the system at different levels (between firewalls).
nat and dhcp are active at every level, but the hosts receive dhcp assignments from the inner-most level dhcp server-router.
it's easier to visualize if i could draw it on a napkin, preferrably served with a drink.
it's important to change the default settings at every level for security purposes.
admin passwords, dhcp ranges, default gateway addresses, ssid's, every setting that you can change should be changed, but remember to write it all down and keep it filed for when you forget.
-woody ps - i've added two apple systems to the mix since my last posting.
