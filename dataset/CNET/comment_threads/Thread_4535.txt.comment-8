There is now no connectivity.
I can't bring up simple google web-page again.
So I go into System Preferences &gt; Sharing &gt; Firewall, and stop.
Immediately my internet works again.
What causes this?
Why would I have connectivity immediately after starting the firewall - odd as it was, and then I look an hour later, and no connectivity again?
