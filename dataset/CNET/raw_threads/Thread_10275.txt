Well, since then, I have changed up my list a lot. I'm just going to post it to see if those revisions were worth it =P I won't be posting a video card; I'll be waiting for Nvidia to release there DX 11 cards and then see how the VG scene looks. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115215 CPU 200 Motherboard: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131404 150 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231193 RAM 85 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136319 Hard Drive 75 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=Nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E1682023122582E16817152028 Power Supply 50 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823126009 keyboard 65 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826104178 Mouse 40 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119068 Case 50 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827106276 CDROM Drive 20 My main concern is the PSU; I believe it should be more than enough power... but I'm not sure =P

It will probably be enough but you'd be better off going with something around the 600 watt range just to ensure that the computer has enough power. Nothing worse than having your PSU blow from being overdrawn for too long (and risking blowing other parts if the PSU were to fail).
