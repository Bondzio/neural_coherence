Remember what you mentioned about Dell as it *may* apply to HP as well.
Many an OEM co. just don't offer decent support anymore w/o alot of hemming and hawing(sp) so just keep that in mind.
But, that can change overtime, as I pissed and moaned about eMachines for a longtime and they seemed to have gotten thier act together, but again it could change as now they're owned by Gateway.
Gateway was great some yrs.
ago but seemed to have fallen too, IMHO.
Well, anyways, thier lost is my gain as a tech.. tada -----Willy
