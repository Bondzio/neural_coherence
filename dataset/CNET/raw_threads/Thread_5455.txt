Im on a 600 $$ budget but can spend a bit extra for something needed. I want a CD-RW drive and 512 MB of RAM. This cost includes a moniter, key board/mouse, and speakers. Any suggestions?

Anyway the T6212 normally sells for $580 without a monitor or printer. Circuit City showing sale extension for T6212 with emachine 17&quot; Flat-screen CRT monitor and Canon PIXMA Photo Printer, in package for $550 that ends at 5PM ET (Eastern Time) today. http://www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/118273/bundleId/1213/rpem/ccd/bundleDetail.do
