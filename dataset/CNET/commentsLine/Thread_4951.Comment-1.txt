after switching from pc to mac and hooking up my mp730 my prints all turn out at about 50% or smaller, jammed up into a corner of the letter size sheets.
i've looked through all the preferences, print menus, etc to no avail.
it happens everytime, no matter what the program is i'm printing from - word, a web page, photoshop, etc.
this never happened when hooked up to my pc.
i can't find drivers for the mp730 on apple's site, so don't know what to do or whom to contact.
advice anyone?
