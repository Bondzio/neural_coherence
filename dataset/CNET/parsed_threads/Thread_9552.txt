<s> This might not be the right place to ask, but I'll go ahead.. </s>
<s> I currently have a wireless router 802.11b (Netgear), and I was wanting to upgrade. </s>
<s> Mostly because of the faster g and when i originally bought my router I new nothing about networking. </s>
<s> Well, now i still don't know a heck of a lot, but I do know I want to be more secure. </s>
<s> I have been reading up on WEP and WPA, and SSID, but I'm a little lost on setting it up. </s>
<s> ANYWAY, what I really want to know is some people suggestions of good wireless routers. </s>
<s> Good as in good range, ease of setup (especially for noobs), and good support. </s>
<s> I'm kind of leaning towards the Netgear WGR614 only because I currently have a netgear and has been working fine. </s>
<s> Any and all suggestions welcome!! </s>

<s> Thanks for the link! </s>
<s> Trust me I do check CNET before any tech purchase I make. </s>
<s> The thing is, that CNET hasn't done a router review in a while. </s>
<s> I'd really like to see a &quot;Router Throwdown&quot;. </s>
<s> Something that takes the newer or most popular routers on the market and puts them head to head. </s>
<s> Some of the routers in the &quot;Editor's Choice&quot; either don't exist anymore, or have been replaced by a new model or line. </s>
<s> I think an update would be nice. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions is still welcome!! </s>

<s> I have 5 supermax cards still in the box. </s>
<s> They're there because I procrastinated long enough to see the &quot;pre-n&quot; standard come out. </s>
<s> Even though the W3C hasn't fully adopted the standard (they will) yet I'm going to install Belkin's pre-n routers and controllers. </s>
<s> Good Luck!! </s>

<s> Very simple to use, excellent on line support, and super fast email response. </s>
<s> As far as range, they are all the same. </s>
<s> FCC regulations limit transmitted power so they all have the same range. </s>
