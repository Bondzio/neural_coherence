1.1.1	am trying to network my two home computers , and am not very capable with setting this up .	St
1.1.2	my specifics are as follows : Comp.1 -- HP desktop running Windows XP Home w/SP2 .	St
1.1.3	This has Norton Systemworks 2007 Premier and ZoneAlarm Pro installed .	St
1.1.4	Comp.2 -- Gateway running Windows XP Media Center .	St
1.1.5	This is fresh out-of-box , with no installed AV or purchased firewall yet .	St
1.1.6	Motorola Cable/telephony modem SBV5220 Linksys Router WRT54G version 6 Linksys Wireless-G WMP54G Wireless-G card was installed on Gateway and appears to be ok ... brought up a list of available networks it sniffed out .	St
1.1.7	Attempted to install router on HP with supplied cd , but can not connect to internet thru router .	St
1.1.8	Wiring is correct : cable to modem , Ethernet cable to router , line 1 Ethernet cable to computer ( HP ) .	St
1.1.9	Have been in touch with their & quot ; support & quot ; techs .	St
1.1.10	The last one informed me that there was a compatibility problem with IE7 ( running on HP ) .	St
1.1.11	So I installed Firefox version 2.0 .	St
1.1.12	Same problem exists .	St
1.1.13	I 'm able to & quot ; ping & quot ; their site 192.168.1.1 , and can also & quot ; ping & quot ; a URL ( if there 's any difference between those two ) .	St
1.1.14	I do n't know how to check for the IP addresses , nor where the MAC address comes into play , if at all .	Ques
1.1.15	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Work on getting the wired connection working first .	St
1.2.2	See if you can access the router 's administration page ( the router 's settings ) by going to http : //192.168.1.1 Once you access the router 's admin page , follow the instructions from your ISP on how to set up a router with their service .	St
1.3.1	i am no real expert but i 've just been thru this so i thought i 'd give you my 2 cents , re : the router , my big mistake was misunderstanding which ethernet jack was in and which was out , as they are often right all in a row .	St
1.3.2	that stuff usually works right off .	St
1.3.3	if not , one trick is to reboot the modem and router : unplug , wait 30 seconds ( why i don ; t know- i wait 3 ) plug back in , and give it a few min .	Sug
1.3.4	re : setting up a home netowrk , here is what 5 books did not tell me : assuming both comps are on the net , this very important : 1 ) create a user account on each computer that is identical in name and password to the other .	St
1.3.5	when you create the account , add it to a workgroup .	St
1.3.6	you need to name the workgoup the same on each machine too .	St
1.3.7	this too is real important .	St
1.3.8	2 ) i am not sure but i think the accounts need a password .	St
1.3.9	I was hoping to avoid this but apparently not .	St
1.3.10	2a you may need to set the thing to ask for passwords .	St
1.3.11	go to system/ users and passwords .	Sug
1.3.12	it 's a checkbox .	St
1.3.13	note this was a win2k thing .	St
1.3.14	3 ) using windows explorer , ( not ie ) , right click on folders you want to share , click properties , and click on share/ sharing and make them shared .	St
1.3.15	4if you have a firewall ( I have zone alarm ) you need to add the network to the trusted zone .	St
1.3.16	my system : start run type cmd , in the dos window type ipconfig .	St
1.3.17	you will see your IP number , & quot ; add & quot ; that to your list of trusted zone comps .	St
1.3.18	5 ) note if all your machines are xp , there is a network setup wizard you can use .	St
1.3.19	you need to burn a disk or have a thumb drive to xfer stuff to other comps .	St
1.3.20	i had win2k so could n't use it .	St
1.3.21	bear in mind , i played around with passwords yesterday and now nothing works , but i had it up and running for a day .	St
1.3.22	this is just what seemed to work for me , it 's still a blur .	St
1.3.23	if any experts care to correct me feel free .	St
1.3.24	once done , click on start network places , you 'll see menu options to click on , one will take you to your network group .	St
1.3.25	if all you see is printers and faxes you dind't enable sharing .	St
1.3.26	good luck -- fj	Polite
1.4.1	well i am back up and running -- lesson learned , if you muck around with anything you need to go back and re-name the workgroup , why i do not know .	St
1.4.2	-- fj	St
1.5.1	Yep , that is a solution that can get sharing via Windows Workgroups going again .	St
1.5.2	The ability to connect to the Internet ( rykdawgg6601 's original problem ) is independent of whether file sharing on a local network is functioning .	St
1.5.3	rykdawgg6601 should be able to get the router to connect to the Internet whether or not Workgroup file and printer sharing is enabled .	St
