The printer self test doesnt work.
I remember this problem starting when I switched off the computer and the printer hadnt finished switching off.
I tried PRINTSCREEN, printscreen, but the command is invalid.
Should I just type C:\&gt;PRINTSCREEN then enter?
Sorry, I'm not very DOS literate.
My computer is French, so windows is in French, but I guess MS DOS is universal?
