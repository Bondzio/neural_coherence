acronis gives you an option to clone the drive or do something else.
let's cover use of the clone first.
you asked if the clone can go in a new machine.
that's not easy to answer and it's not acronis's issue here.
microsoft has that product activation and when you put xp into another machine it should fail to boot proper for this and other reasons.
if you had a hp machine (you didn't tell) then you are very limited to getting the same model hp for the os to boot and work since you have both microsoft license/activation issues plus the usual hardware driver issue.
-&gt; let's cover off how to fix the repair of xp when we move the hard disk fast.
type xp repair install into google.com -&gt; about activation.
it all depends on your xp or other license.
this has many answers but with the full retail copy and license you won't have an issue.
next acronis allows you to save an image of your system to a file.
this could be restored to a hard disk that you put into a pc and then the above items apply.
i can see why acronis can't answer.
most of this is not their issue.
