I was wondering if my motherboard, which supports SATA 1.5 hardware would also support SATA 3.0 (not necessarily at the 3.0 speeds, but at least at 1.5). I figure it would work, but I wanted to make sure. I figured if I buy an SATA 3.0 hard drive now, whenever I get around to updating my motherboard, I'd be ahead of the game. Comments/suggestions?

Some will work automatically. Some will need to have a jumper set on the HD (or other fix). Here is an example from Seagate: http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/faq/sata_lock.html
