1.1.1	Hi,I was given a HP OfficeJet mod.600 Printer and was wondering if it was compatiable with windowsXP.I have a Dell Optiplex GXE 150 with Windows XP and the software for the printer has instructions for Windows 9x or Windows 3.1 operating systems.Is there any way I can configure XP to work with this printer?If there is what steps do I need to take?
