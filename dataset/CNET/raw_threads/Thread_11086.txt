I then later found out I didn't need to partition it for the intended purpose so I deleted the partition. Now it comes up as unallocated space and unless I format it I cannot use it. Now I want to format it but I want it to go back with the original drive not as a separate one. For example Original drive F partitioned to F and Y drives. Then deleted Y and it became un allocated. I need the Y to merge with the F again. Sorry fr the poor explanation, it's hard. Thanks
