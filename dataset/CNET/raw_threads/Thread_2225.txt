3107	0	358359	3122932	NR	toastguy	9/8/09 7:07 PM	1.25243682E12	I need an IDE HardDrive compatible w/ my Windows 2003 Server	I got a 500GB Western Digital Caviar SE (wd5000jbrtl). It seems like it's not compatible with my Windows 2003 Server. Any recommendations. I'm running a 7VM400M-RZ Motherboard.
