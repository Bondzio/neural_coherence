The new laptop had a built in network card. The SBC CD only wants to set up for a 2wire product. I am getting a great signal strength but limited or no connectivity. When I check the ip address it is incorrect.

The reason you got limited or no connectivity on your wireless connection, is simply mistyping your WEP key. If you went to your prefered network list and disconnected from your current wireless connection, you could retype the 10 digit hexadecimal key located on your 2wire 1000sw. I really hope you already found the answer to this a long time ago.
