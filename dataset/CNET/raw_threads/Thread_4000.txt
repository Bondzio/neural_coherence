What I would like to know is if and how I can transfer my system (XP Pro) from my ancient 13GB ATA C: drive onto the new fast, larger drive so I can use the SATA drive as my C: drive without having to reinstall XP and loosing all my settings and associations. Thanks, Calamity

HOWEVER this answer will not help you if you changed from PATA to SATA (you didn't tell.)

Heck it's probably close to 10 years old, which is probably a miracle in itself. I used WD's Data Lifeguard Tools software and it seems to have handled the system transfer just fine. Unfrotunately now I spoke too soon other wise. I'm getting weird hiccups from a number of other programs. My AV software lost my registration number (and easy fix) and Microsoft Office Word is claiming to not be functioning properly but refuses to fix itself (and it actually does appear to work fine other than the disclaimer that pops up before it opens). Who knows what else I'll discover in the coming days. But at least I didn't have to do a clean install of XP...and then have to reinstall everything else to get my associations back.
