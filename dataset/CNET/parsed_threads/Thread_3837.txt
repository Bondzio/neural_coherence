<s> I have a 500 gig Seagate hard drive (SATA) that is no longer working as an external (broken bus ). </s>
<s> I'm considering using it as extra storage space. </s>
<s> I have 2 IDE drives that I'm using as master and slave. </s>
<s> I run Windows XP. </s>
<s> My question is: Can I use the SATA as storage and keep the IDE as my boot drive? </s>
<s> Let's say you give me TEN PCs with IDE and SATA connections. </s>
<s> I would and could encounter TEN DIFFERENT SETUPS with no two being the same. </s>
<s> Which means the answer is MAYBE. </s>
<s> Only your machine's maker can guide you to the right settings if you can't figure it out on your own. </s>
<s> And you can imagine I don't want to write down all the TEN ways this could be configured in the BIOS, the OS and the DRIVERS. </s>
<s> Welcome the the (PC) tarpit issue. </s>

<s> The question to ask would be, does your PC have SATA connectors and support? </s>
<s> If not, I would not recommend drop in SATA cards. </s>
<s> Fusing legacy products, I have found to be quite troublesome. </s>
