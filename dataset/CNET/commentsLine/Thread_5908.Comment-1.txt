no need to describe the specific layout or application in this situation, just a quick question that requires a simple answer.
background: in my hardward configuratoin for a certain computer setup, a drive must be taken out and put back into a bay daily.
the bay is conected by an ide/eide connector.
because of the unintended use of this cable, it will creep out of place in a week or so.
question: where can i get a cable or a connector that will snap, screw, or otherwise secure the cable/connector in place.
does such a component exist?
