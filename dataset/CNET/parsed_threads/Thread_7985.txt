<s> I just purchased a sony 17 in LCD SDMHS75P/B The analog works fine but when I switch it to DVI it says no input signal Ive tried everything the manual said to do even sony support no luck I have a nvida Geforce FX 5200 with DVI I The cable with the sony monitor is a DVI D cable. </s>
<s> Could this be the problem or is it the video card. </s>
<s> Windows XP is the OS With service pack 2. </s>
<s> Go into the properties section of display, find the default setting or basic VGA setting, accept it and save before leaving. </s>
<s> Shutdown system, connect DVI cable, then power-UP, hopefully, if should see new hardware and proceed foward. </s>
<s> If not, does the Sony have any CD/floppy with it? </s>
<s> it may contain the drivers to better accept the Sony LCD/monitors display ranges, etc.. </s>
<s> AND/OR under 5200 setting, make sure you select what display is now 1, or 2 if more than one, if only one, then the other is OFF or not active, though it should do this automatically. </s>
<s> 5200 display setting can be updated, so get the latest either from the video card maker or Nvida support website. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
