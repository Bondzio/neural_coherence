i do regular backups, but not to my hard drive or extrenal drive etc.
while it might be more time consuming, i prefer to burn all of my important files, documents, and program files etc to dvd.
that way, if my system ever crashes or if i have a major problem, all i have to do when things return to normal is copy the files i need to my new hard drive.
some people might not consider this as a proper backup, but it works for me.
