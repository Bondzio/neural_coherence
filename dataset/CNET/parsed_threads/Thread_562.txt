<s> Hi everyone. </s>
<s> I recently decided to reinstall Windows. </s>
<s> My external hard drives decided to work fine after the reformat. </s>
<s> However, today, I experienced a CMOS error after a nasty hard reboot and when I loaded Windows again, it was very unstable. </s>
<s> Now, my external hard drives aren't detected by Windows, and load forever when I click them, and when I unplug them, a message stating that they need to be formatted pops up. </s>
<s> When I try to open them, it says the parameter is incorrect. </s>
<s> Also, when trying to view them in Disk Manager, the window freezes up, not changing until I unplug the device. </s>
<s> The strange thing is that they work perfectly fine on my XP laptop. </s>
<s> System: Windows 7 Professional x64 EVGA 790i Ultra SLI Motherboard 1TB Western Digital MyBook External 500GB Western Digital MyBook External Thanks. </s>
<s> The last ten calls on this found Torrent use, trojans and troubles stemming from both. </s>
<s> I can't explain why folk invite trouble like that. </s>
<s> Again, just sharing what the last ten calls found. </s>
<s> It doesn't mean that's what's going on here. </s>
<s> What does the machine's maker have to say about the errors? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I built the computer, and I have done a virus scan as well. </s>
<s> I have not had a single virus in three years :P </s>
<s> This might point to defective or slightly detoriated USB cable or ports. </s>
<s> I've had such with an MP3-player. </s>
<s> Using another USB helped. </s>
<s> If necessary, buy a PCI USB-card and see if it works now. </s>
