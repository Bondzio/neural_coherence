Many people have reported not being able to get the mic to work on this card.
Me too!
I am wondering if a way to combat this frustrating problem might be with a sound pod - I'm considering Byterunner UA 580 (USB 5.1 Channel Audio Adapter).
Anyone have any experience or advice regarding this?
Many thanks!
