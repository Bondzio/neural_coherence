the best s/w to do this is called, &quot;laplink&quot; which also includes the cable.
older laplink s/w ver.
will do fine, it seems too many bells and whisltes are part of the s/w now and but check to be sure it will handle your os.
win98 and above offer ms own &quot;dcc&quot; s/w whcih does basically the same thing but very basic and that's ok for most users.
that's installed from the os install cd from the add/remove s/w icon.
you still need the laplink type cable parallel or serial links as required.
the irda is &quot;infared connection&quot; ability.
that's also possible if goping that route, but it can be complex at times.
good luck -----willy
