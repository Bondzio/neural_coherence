i have a computer that is older and slower than yours, with less memory.
it was still running pretty snappily, but was completely obselete.
i downloaded ubuntu linux and installed it on there.
it should be faster and more stable than your windows me, and you'll still be able to surf the web, make skype calls, do serious work on it, listen to mp3s, etc.
it's free to use, and they'll even send you cds for free.
you can install it onto your 6 gig hard drive and still leave windows on the big one too.
that way, if you get a new computer, you can use ubuntu and the samba software as the means of transferring files from the old one.
