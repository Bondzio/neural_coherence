I have a computer in New York and a computer in Vermont. I would like to be able to remote desktop into the Vermont computer from New York. Both computers are running XP Pro and connected to the internet with a broadband connection. From what I read I think I need to forward the vermont connection to the outside internet? Can I accomplish this with my linksys wireless router? What hardware and software do I need to obtain and setup to accomplish this? I already have a linksys wireless router and a Nokia IP70 hardware firewall/router. If anyone knows of a good book that explains step by step the process I would appreciate the reccomendation. Although I built my last computer from scratch I am not an IT professional and have limited computer/networking knowledge. TIA

If the computers have static IPs and are directly connected to the Internet, you're ready to go. If they do not have static IPs it's still possible but much more of a hassle. If the computers reside on a network, you will have to create a VPN connection first. Then you could connect to any PC on the LAN that has remote desktop enabled.
