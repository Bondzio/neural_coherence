I need something lightweight (&lt;1lb) but would also like the maximum capacity. I've narrowed it down to 2 options. 1.Western Digital Passport- 120GB USB 2.0 - 2.5&quot; External Hard Drive OR 2.Seagate Portable ST9100801U2 External 100GB Hard Drive The Western Digital only has 2MB cache. The Seagate offers 8MB cache and 2 USB connections &quot;for improved performance&quot; but the hard drive is 20GB smaller. Recommendations???

You can also 'build your own' so to speak....pick out an external case of choice and a 2.5&quot; drive of choice and you're done. On the plus side you've got a much longer warranty if that matters to you...most 'off the shelf' externals are limited to 1 year enclosure and drive. Most stand alone enclosures have 1 year warranties and stand alone drive warranties vary from 1 to 5 years. Now some mfgs are now offering 7,200RPM laptop HDDs...again your choice
