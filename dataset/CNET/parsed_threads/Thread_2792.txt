<s> Hello, I recently purchased a Toshiba Satellite A215-S5818 Laptop (specs can be found at http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/rdet.jsp?poid=405001&seg=HHO ) and it comes with Atheros Wireless LAN 802.11a/g/n. </s>
<s> I want to get a wireless router for my home, but which router should I get, 802.11a, 802.11g, or 802.11n? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot! </s>
<s> Any fine 802.11g router is good for &quot;the internet&quot; since your internet connection is much less than 54 megabit. </s>
<s> 802.11n is good if you have more than one machine and want to copy over the air. </s>

<s> So if I'm only going to use the router for this one laptop and possibly xbox 360 for xbox live, then a &quot;G&quot; router is the one to choose? </s>
<s> Even if both machines hit the net, your &quot;air speed&quot; is still many times of your internet connection speed. </s>
