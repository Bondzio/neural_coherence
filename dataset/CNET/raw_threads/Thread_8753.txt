For the first time I became even more curious and took the processor off aswell as the fan. After I did this I noticed a cream-like substance. I took a picture of it (a link is bellow). But later on I realised that it's under my heat sink of my TNT2 too (yes, it's an old computer!) My processor is a Pentium 3, with a speed of 866 mhz. So what is this? I'm guessing it's got to do with heat reduction. Picture: http://img225.exs.cx/img225/2305/dscf00738nq.th.jpg

Too much compound can reduce the thermal conductivity. Taking the CPU off for kicks is not normally a good thing to do. LOL Too many chances to foul things up. We humans have a way of making reliable things become unreliable by touching them. Enjoy.
