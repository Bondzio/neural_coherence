Will access points connect to each other or does an access point have to connect to a router? I have a Belkin router and Access Point with DSL.

Look into clustering or WDS. From what I'm reading you might be better off with access points of the same brand and model that can operate in these modes. With WDS, only one device needs to be wired and the others can act as repeaters. There are limitations and pitfalls, however.

RF don't travel well through dense walls and floors. You are better off bouncing signals off hard surfaces. However that can create dead zones, so look into MIMO. Practically any brand's MIMO point can handle a 2000+ sq. ft. home with ease. For your school, can't you pull cable to other end of hallway and use a POE point?

We'd need a midspan or switch capable of providing the power. Our short list of hardware includes a few 3Com 7760 PoE capable APs and either a 3Com or US Robotics PoE switch in the lower price ranges. Pulling more Cat 5 isn't a problem but finding AC outlets at the best locations for the APs is. That's why PoE is being considered. Only recently did funds turn up to plan in earnest. I appreciate your mentioning problems with repeaters. I'm not an IT guy and, as a volunteer, I want stuff that works without a lot of care and feeding. Unfortunately, the current batch of laptops at the school that would benefit from a wireless hot spot feature a bunch of 802.11 &quot;a&quot;s which travel in a cart that carries it's own AP with it that needs to be plugged into the classroom ports for use. What we implement will need to be as compatible as possible with what we already have to live with unless a money tree appears in the school yard. Thanks again. I don't want to hijack this thread and I hope such discussion will be useful to originator. There's plenty to read on this common issue.

It doesn't list the PoE standard either but I do think Cisco makes their own power injectors for some models. No doubt it has features and management capabilities that wouldn't be used in this school....partially because no one there would know how. It's nice to think big but we need to live with reality. It's not a big school...K-8 with a capacity of about 250 kids plus the staff. I'm hoping to get by with 3 or 4 APs and a small capacity but rack mountable switch that can power them. I'm hoping to propose we can do the project for under $1500. I can get a spool of Cat-5 donated so that will help.

XR is an improvement for a/b/g but it isn't as good as MIMO. There are some MIMO-XR units in the market but they are from small companies. If you choose it, again make sure their firmware supports features that you need. Good luck in your project.
