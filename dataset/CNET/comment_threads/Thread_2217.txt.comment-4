When you power up the PC, watch the fans and especially the PS fan.
If it twitches and stops and the PC does not boot, this usually means the PS has detected an improper load and has shut down.
If the fans do nothing, it could be the mentioned momentary switch.
A marginal PS can do this because the startup current is higher than the run current.
This could explain why it sometimes works and sometimes does not.
Of course make sure the PS can supply sufficient current for your hardware configuration.
Good luck.
