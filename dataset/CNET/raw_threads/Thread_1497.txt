1198	0	353817	3100278	NR	tremapar	8/11/09 4:13 PM	1.25000718E12	Keyboard selection	I would like some advice on what keyboard I should get for my system. I am using a 60&quot; T.V. as the display for my computer, so I need to be far enough away from the screen to enjoy it. It is in the basement living room, about 15' from the couch. I want a quality wireless keyboard that won't make me bankrupt, my current wireless keyboard does not work at the range. One feature I would be interested in is any kind of illumination, glow in the dark, backlight, whatever. If it is a gaming keyboard, that would be just fine, as long as it does not cost a fortune. A gaming keyboard is not necessary, but preferable. I have looked at IOGEAR, and they have a keyboard with a 33' range, I just don't know how well it would work, and I don't need the mouse that comes with it, I have a Logitech G7 mouse. Logitech has some really nice wired gaming keyboards, (The G19 and the G15 are too expensive, but the G11 might work) I just don't know how long their cords are. Their wireless K350 looks really nice, but I need to know if its range is good enough. Priorities: 1 - Works well long range, quality. 2 - Some kind of illumination. 3 - Gaming grade
