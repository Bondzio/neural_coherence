I have a desktop that recently died (motherboard) and since I mostly use my notebook anyway I thought I would just convert my desktop's internal 80GB HD to an external drive that I could connect to my laptop USB using an enclosure.
I just want to make sure that I can take the HD with its OS (XP) and all the files/programs and plug it in and read the data on it with no problems.
I have only seen/read about people using blank, naive drives for this.
I have some data/music/files on the HD and still really need them, so I don't want to reformat/erase it until I can at least transfer them to the notebook HD.
If I do need to wipe the drive, any comments on the best,easiest and cheapest way to retrieve my files first would be welcome.
Thanks
