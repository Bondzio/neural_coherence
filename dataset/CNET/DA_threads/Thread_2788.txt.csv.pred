1.1.1	I'm looking forward to The Witcher 2, and I need a new pc.	St
1.1.2	It will be used only for gaming, but I'm not as up to date on the most current tech.	St
1.1.3	I'm also on a budget, so I can't spend more than 2,000.	St
1.1.4	I found this on amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Alienware-AAR2-1222CSB-2-80GHz-Capacity-Windows/dp/B0044XU3B0/ref=wl_it_dp_o?ie=UTF8&coliid=I3O8RMUGBTOBPD&colid=25XN6PIUIKJY3 I'd probably also upgrade the video card to this: http://www.amazon.com/Sapphire-DL-DVI-I-SL-DVI-D-PCI-Express-100315L/dp/B0047ZGIUK/ref=wl_it_dp_o?ie=UTF8&coliid=I2BCHPACT93PZ3&colid=25XN6PIUIKJY3 Any thoughts?	St
1.2.1	for that much money, no.	St
1.2.2	you can take $1500 and build a brand new 2ND gen intel sandy bridge rig, overclock it easily to over 4.0Ghz, put in a new 68xx radeon, have an ssd, and shred anything that rig can do.	St
1.2.3	you just have to build it yourself.	St
