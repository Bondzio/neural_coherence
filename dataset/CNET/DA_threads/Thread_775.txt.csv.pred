1.1.1	HI all I am looking to build a desktop and is currently examining the various CPUs .	St
1.1.2	I have opted to go with AMDs as they are , in general , cheaper than Intel 's counter parts .	St
1.1.3	( by core counts , quad-core AMD is generally cheaper than quad-core Intel ) .	St
1.1.4	So I am looking through the AMDs and noticed the Phenom and Athlon family .	St
1.1.5	I was just wondering which family is better ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Google up Tomshardware CPU CHARTS 2011 ( or 2010 ) and put the CPUs you want up for comparison .	St
1.2.2	However with current Intel CPUs including hyperthreading with each core , you may be discounting them a little too soon .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	keeping track of amd 's family is a moving question since they 're always introducing something to compete in the low-mid range .	St
1.3.2	if you 're not interested in high-end performance , just go by price since they 're very competitive in their price range .	St
1.3.3	personally , i 'd go with a phenom x4 to get the extra cores at only a little more cost and 90 % of most users , they 're more than sufficent .	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	Hi all , thanks for your help .	Polite
1.5.2	I went with the intel instead .	St
1.6.1	jzou , I do n't know which AMD and Intel processors you considered , but figuring out what CPU to buy is probably the single most diffficult decision when you 're building a PC .	St
1.6.2	Used to be , you could just look at the processor family ( 386 , 486 , etc . )	St
1.6.3	and speed , then look for a DX or SX suffix , and you had all the information you needed to compare parts .	St
1.6.4	These days , you need a good , up-to-date reference in order to know just how one processor compares to another .	St
1.6.5	While in the past I have favored AMD processors for the same reason you originally did -- lots of bang for the buck -- I 'm no longer sure if AMD still offers a significant price advantage .	St
1.6.6	OTOH , unless you 're building a computer for gaming , AutoCAD or Photoshop , almost any of today 's common desktop processors will have more than enough power for your needs -- and even with those power-hungry apps , the video card is probably more important than the CPU .	St
1.6.7	I 'm more concerned these days with the amount of power a CPU draws , how much heat it generates ( those two go together ) , the amount of on-board cache , and in some cases whether it has onboard graphics ; for general computing use , just about any mid-range processor is fast enough , and even some budget procs have plenty of oomph for most of the things my family does .	St
1.7.1	those are very important questions that unfortunately I did n't have a lot of time to research .	St
1.7.2	So I took a short cut instead .	St
1.7.3	I asked three different computer stores to recommend a setup for my given budget and went with the one that I liked .	St
1.7.4	Then I searched for the cheapest seller of each parts .	St
