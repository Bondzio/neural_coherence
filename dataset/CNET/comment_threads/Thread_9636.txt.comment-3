Problem there is when I plug the card in there is no output at all from the onboard socket.
It just goes completely dead.
Can I still install drivers if the card is not in place?
I tried and it came up saying it couldn't find any hardware to match.
As I said, on the new card everything seems OK up until the Windows XP screen.
When it disappears and you expect to see Windows loading up, the screen goes black and the &quot;no signal&quot; box comes up on the monitor.
Windows continues to load as you can hear its little jingle.
