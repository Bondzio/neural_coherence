12820	0	65378	776285	NR	qtalent	2/19/05 9:59 AM	1.10880714E12	slow computer	Why does my desktop computer (Windows Millennium ME)performance start up at only 45-50% when I have 896 MB of memory, even when I haven't logged onto the Internet? Why does the defrag process stall on the c:drive? It can't get past 10% complete. I ran spyware and I have current Norton Internet/Antivirus security. Thanks for any help you can give me!

There are some bugs in Windows ME memory management that causes &quot;issues&quot; when its run on machines with &quot;large amounts&quot; of RAM. Microsoft documented this and you should read about such at http://support.microsoft.com No patch was supplied but a workaround to tell ME to keep itself to 512MB. The defrag issue is noted in the Windows ME forum in a note I keep on the first page. Here's an article about Windows ME memory -&gt; http://aumha.org/win4/a/memmgmt.php Bob

I use my computer for word processing and surfing the net. I started out with 128MB and added a 256 card because Gateway recommended it when my computer started taking a while to load pages when I had multiple programs running during an online college program. I also had to uninstall AOL 9.0 and go back to 6.0 and that seemed to help. Then recently when I checked the resources and saw they were very low upon booting up I added another Gateway 256 card but that didn't help. Resources are still low and the defragging process stalls. No viruses, no spyware, no cookies, etc. What's wrong?
