any such will be on the hard drive of the pc.
the pc133 line will reflect the speed and i presume the 333 afterwards might be the timing.
this will be older...possibly 168 pin ram.
i'm thinking p-3 vintage maybe.
in any event, it won't be of use to find another pc to plug it into for data retrieval.
it will be referred to as &quot;volatile&quot; memory because, once power is withdrawn, all that's stored is lost.
