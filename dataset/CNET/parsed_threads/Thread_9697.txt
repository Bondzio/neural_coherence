<s> I have a five year old system. </s>
<s> A Trinity 400 motherboard by Tyan, an Intel Celeron 701 mhz processor, and 320 MB of RAM. </s>
<s> I would like to defer purchasing a new systemfor another year. </s>
<s> I recently moved up from Win98 to Win XP Pro. </s>
<s> The system runs OK, however I would like to increase performance. </s>
<s> I can add 2 DIMMS and increase the RAM to 768. </s>
<s> Is this advisable on this old system? </s>
<s> How much better performance can I expect? </s>
<s> I would say a bare minimum of 256MB for any XP user. </s>
<s> However, you should really go up to 512MB if possible. </s>
<s> If you are a gamer, or your applications need it, go up to 1024 MB. </s>
<s> I can't say exactly what performance gain you can expect. </s>
<s> You should see a slight performance gain. </s>
<s> The most will come if your computer is relying on the swap file too much as it is. </s>
<s> If the hard drive activity light on your case is on for a long time whenever you switch programs, you might need more RAM. </s>
<s> A little more will always help, up to a certain extent, though. </s>
<s> i would recommend that plus the upgrade in ram. </s>
<s> but if u ask me now would be a good time to purchase a new pc. </s>
<s> most of the hardware now is win. </s>
<s> vista capable anyway if u get a good system </s>
<s> Pretty old computer, I suggest getting a new computer which will last you a long time. </s>
<s> I had an ABS with Windows ME, an AGP card, and a P3 running which lasted me for 5 yrs., but I got myself a new system. </s>
<s> Many excellent budget computers start at around $500. </s>
<s> I got my $500 system with a DVD burner, P4 processor, 120gb hard drive, media card reader, and it runs well. </s>
<s> You will see increased benefits with adding more RAM; Windows will run alot better and you can use alot of today's modern apps like photoshop. </s>
<s> Upgrading RAM always gives you more speed as most issues are solved just by adding more RAM. </s>
<s> I had a P3 550MHz w/128MB SDRAM (PC133). </s>
<s> It didn't run as silky smooth as on a mid level P4 PC, but it ran well enough. </s>
<s> I had to disable the translucent selection rectangle effect else i'd get crawling slowdowns in certain spots. </s>
<s> I later upgraded to 640MB of RAM and it ran a little better. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if my P3 550MHz was faster than your Celeron 701MHz processor. </s>
<s> Clockspeed is higher, but the Celeron's architecture is inferior. </s>
<s> Worse comes to worst, you could alwasy just turn down ALL visual effects in winXP if not alr done so. </s>
<s> With all those effects off, you pretty much got yourself a win2k machine there with better networking. </s>
<s> My take is if you're not gonna be an early adaptor of Win Vista, then you could run WinXP with what u have now and wait for a better and/or cheaper system. </s>
<s> Preferrably one that comes with Win Vista. </s>
<s> For gaming and moderately heavy multitasking, get a new system now. </s>
<s> You are correct, I am not an early adaptor. </s>
<s> My system is running OK. </s>
<s> I'm not into gaming, and the multitasking I do doesn't slow things up. </s>
<s> So, I will not invest any more in this system and aim for a Vista system next year. </s>
<s> Based on all your comments, I will just rock along with what I have for now, and buy a new system after Vista comes out. </s>
<s> In your place i would'nt blindly go for a RAM increase as it would not ALWAYS guarantee an increase in performance in old systems.This is because the performance of computer also to a certain degree depends on the FSB capacity.If your system has a bus which has a lesser speed than the RAM then the increase in RAM will not help you.You can increase ur computer performance by only increasing RAM upto that limited by your bus speed. </s>
<s> Windows 98 says it runs on 64MB Windows 2000 says it runs on 128MB Windows XP says it runs on 256MB Windows Vista on 512MB To me, by experience, this means &quot;Windows&quot; will run fine using these respective sizes of RAM... </s>
<s> But ONLY Windows. </s>
<s> If you would like to be able to use other programs, like, say, MS Office, AntiVirus software, or anything else for that matter, without your hard disk constantly grinding every time you click on anything, then you should double the above-mentioned amounts. </s>
<s> So, the minimum amount to run Win XP rather smoothly, is to have at least 512MB RAM. </s>
<s> Even if your PC is not a speed demon, you will benefit greatly by sticking to this rule. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>
<s> I really appreciate you all taking the trouble to answer my questions. </s>
<s> What I am concluding that I don't need to waste any money upgrading my old system, rather to invest in a new one. </s>
<s> The next question I have is what to be looking for. </s>
<s> I am going to post a new question: What does &quot;Vista ready mean? </s>
<s> What system specs would Vista require? </s>
<s> On a older system like yours i would say 512mgs is fine, should run like a rocket with that. </s>
<s> No need for more on a old box. </s>
<s> TJ^ </s>
<s> Windows XP-SP2 on 256 RAM. </s>
<s> I'd like to add another 256 just to speed it up a bit; I'm planning on keeping the CPU as long as possible. </s>
<s> There is an open memory slot available. </s>
<s> My question, is it worth the $40 - 50 bucks?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Not considering you can get 512MB of decent RAM from some place like www.newegg.com or www.zipzoomfly.com for $30-$40. </s>
<s> Corsair Value RAM is excellent for the price. </s>
<s> Not considering you can get 512MB of decent RAM from some place like www.newegg.com or www.zipzoomfly.com for $30-$40. </s>
<s> Corsair Value RAM is excellent for the price. </s>
<s> $40-50 for a stick is a wise investment. </s>
<s> It should give you better performance for the next couple of years. </s>
<s> It's a helluva lot cheaper than buying a new one, unless that's what you really want to do. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
