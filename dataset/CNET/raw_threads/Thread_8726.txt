A little while ago, I was advised that I could use NTFS-3G coupled with MacFUSE in order to backup a MacBook to an NTFS formatted external hard drive. Looks like this may be necessary, b/c my wife's MacBook is having serious issues (has become ridiculously slow - don't know why). If I do this, and then get the machine repaired in a way that wipes her internal hard drive clean, should we be able to restore her machine from the NTFS-formatted external drive? I assume that I'll have to re-install NTFS-3G and MacFuse before doing so, but after that, should I be able to restore the MacBook?

It's only in the last day or so that we thought her hard drive might be in trouble; originally, I was just curious about backing up her data as a &quot;just in case&quot; sort of thing. Much appreciated.
