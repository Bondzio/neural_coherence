if your dvd watching is producing noticeable choppiness, then it could be several reasons.
it could be the video card, motherboard, cpu, or os.
or even a combination of these.
it might be the monitor if the refresh rate is too slow or the response speed of the monitor is too low.
changing to a tv for a monitor would only make it worse if the system is at fault.
