thank you for the link.
i have a 256 mb lexar jumpdrive 2.0 (i got for $50 on e-bay).
it has worked like a charm with my lap top, even when i used it on a mac.
i am thinking that a 1 gig stick would be even better and before i went out looking for one, i would see if a particular brand is better than another.
i guess they are really like floppies and all about the same quality.
