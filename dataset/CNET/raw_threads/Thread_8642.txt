I have a Single Board Computer (SBC) running Linux that has an 'wireless access point' connected to one of it's Ethernet ports. I want to be able to transfer data between the laptop and the SBC wirelessly (cabling is not an option) How do I achieve this? I think most of the work will be involved configuring the wireless point and the SBC running Linux (Fedora). The 'wireless access point' I am using is the EnGenius EOC5611P - it can be configured for: 1. Access Point 2. Client Bridge 3. WDS Bridge 4. Client Router I don't know which one of these I need,so working that out would be a good start! Thanks

I would set it up as a access point so that if you ever want more wireless stuff to hook up it will be all set. This is also the simplest to setup. Still just to get started I would cable you pc to you other machine to get all the file sharing stuff working before you add a wireless layer to it.
