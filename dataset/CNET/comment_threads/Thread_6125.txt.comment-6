http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-turn-an-old-router-into-a-wireless-bridge/ You'll see a link to an open source firmware replacement.
From there you'll find a list of supported devices.
Unfortunately, I don't see your routers in the list.
I also don't see them in the list of compatible router but I also don't see them in the list of incompatible routers.
I suppose this gives you the option to try this on your own if you don't mind running the risk of bricking one of your devices.
