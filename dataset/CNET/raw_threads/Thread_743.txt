If anyone can help me( every time I plug in the card into the AGP slot and turn on the computer, even when the cable is connected, the screen stays black).

If it is still on the original connector, put it on the video card connector. That will tell which card is working. Also, check the BIOS setting to disable the on board graphics (although Dell hints it may be automatic) see here: http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4600/en/4600i/sm/syssetup.htm#1138127

Also I would like to know if the dell dimension 4600 motherboards are somehow not compatible with this card.
