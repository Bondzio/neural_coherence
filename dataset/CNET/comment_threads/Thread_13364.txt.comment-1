I am running an IBM 300PL 450mhz PIII with 256megs of RAM with WinXP and I am interested in the multiple monitors setup.
My current graphics card is an S3 Trident onboard VGA.
I've attempted to include the onboad output with a PCI card for the setup and also 2 PCI cards.
Each card when individually in use works fine, but when i attempt to use them in a multiple monitor setup, the computer says one is a [Code 10: The device does not work.]
My only explanation is that the bios wont let me have the setup cause the second card does not show up when i boot it.
The bios dates to 2001.
Any help would be GREAT.
thanx
