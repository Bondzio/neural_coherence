Well, I installed a new motherboard and &quot;poof&quot; it powered up right away.
(YEAH!)
I hit &quot;DEL&quot; to look at the CMOS & BIOS and didn't really have to change anything there, it recognized most of it.
It then rolled into giving me the option of how to start Windows XP, last known good config, safe mode, normally, ect.
Regardless of which I choose, it rolled me back into the same screen.
All I have is the &quot;Restore CD&quot; from Emachines and when that is in I have the option of erasing my hard drive to re-install XP (didn't want to do that!!)
or another option that didn't get any results.
