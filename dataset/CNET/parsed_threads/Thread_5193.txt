<s> Hi everyone, I'm recently upgrading my video card on my desktop. </s>
<s> It's the ATI RADEON HD 2900 XT. </s>
<s> I'm just not sure what is the proper way of hooking power to it. </s>
<s> This is my first video card that needs it's own power to it. </s>
<s> FRYS Electronics is selling this: http://www.frys.com/product/4734999 . </s>
<s> I'm not sure if I just need one of those. </s>
<s> It's confusing if I need two 6 pin cables, one for the 6 pin connector and one for the 8 pin connector. </s>
<s> I know I'll need an 8 pin for it's connector if I want to overclock and so on. </s>
<s> Any help and I thank you. </s>
<s> I just want to get what I need before the card gets here. </s>
<s> You will need a power supply that has both a 6 pin connector, and an 8 pin connector. </s>
<s> Also note, that you will have to make sure your case is very well ventilated, as I have read that these cards get REALLY HOT &quot;..Ouch! </s>
<s> Using some AMD monitoring software, we noted idle temperatures of between 65 70-degrees Celsius from the core die and that is just sitting in Windows. </s>
<s> At full load halfway through a 3DMark06 benchmark run, we noted a maximum temperature of 84-degrees Celsius from the core die in other words, very hot! </s>

<s> for this reason. </s>
<s> You didn't mention your power supply specs. </s>
<s> That it doesn't already contain the necessary connector means it might not be of sufficient wattage. </s>
<s> If it is of sufficient wattage, the adapter might work. </s>
<s> If not, you're going to need a new PS and these will probably already have a proper connector. </s>
<s> Sorry I didn't post about my power supply specs, it's a Sparkle Power Inc 350w. </s>
<s> I plan on upgrading the power supply, because of this video card. </s>
<s> My computer is an HP m1170n Media Center PC. </s>
<s> It uses a 24 pin ATX power connection for the motherboard. </s>
<s> Only problem, because of the size of the video card, it's blocking four of the motherboards ATX power pins. </s>
<s> I believe these have to be pins 1-4, which are important for operating the computer. </s>
<s> I don't know if there is a work around for this? </s>
<s> Those pins have to be powered, if not the computer can't run. </s>
<s> If you go here: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00208497&tmp_task=prodinfoCategory&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&lang=en&product=432780 . </s>
<s> That will show what the layout of my motherboard is. </s>
<s> It's the way the ATX power connector was placed on the motherboard, that the video card gets in the way. </s>
<s> I know it's a laugh, because of the overall specs of my desktop. </s>
<s> I can see why the video card won't fit. </s>
<s> That's why I'm never getting a brand named desktop again. </s>
<s> I would rather build one like I've always wanted to. </s>
<s> Any help would be great on what to do.. </s>
<s> The position of the ATX Power Connector is pretty much in the same place as any other motherboard; the fact that this motherboard is a Micro-ATX form factor, is what's causing the problems with the video card install. </s>
<s> If the motherboard was a standard ATX form factor, we wouldn't be having this problem...Solution, might have to settle for a smaller (shorter) video card (for example: Radeon HD 5670 1GB GDDR5 PCI Express x16, comes in at around 7 inches long) to fit into the 9.6 inch x 9.6 inch motherboard. </s>
<s> I looked the 2900 XT and read somewhere it wants 39 AMPERES on the 12V RAIL. </s>
<s> I doubt a 350 Watt power supply delivers that because 39 times 12 is 468 Watts. </s>
<s> Even at idle it may be half that or 19 Amperes and many 350W supplies have 10 Ampere 12V rails. </s>
<s> You'll likely need to fit a 700+ Watt power supply with a watchful eye on the Amperes per rail. </s>
<s> Just asking. </s>
<s> Didn't the seller warn you of this? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I aleady have the video card, is there another solution? </s>
<s> I didn't think it through before getting it off eBay. </s>
<s> Needed it for my brothers birthday. </s>
<s> I forgot that my motherboard was a micro-ATX. </s>
<s> I don't know if there is some type of 90 degree ATX power adapter that would would fit? </s>
<s> Kind of like a SATA data cable. </s>
<s> Maybe there is something like that and would work? </s>
<s> I was lucky to get a really low price on this. </s>
<s> I never really planned on upgrading from my RADEON X700. </s>
<s> Mostly because my desktop is getting older. </s>
<s> I just wanted to please my brother for his birthday, so he could hopefully play this one game. </s>
