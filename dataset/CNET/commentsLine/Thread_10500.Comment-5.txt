thanks for all the input.
i have learned a lot about dolby and decoding.
the following applies to regular (analog 3.5mm) output only and not digital output (optical or s/pdif).
after further research, for anyone interested, i found: 1. creative uses cmss (audigy) and cmss-3d (x-fi) to replace dolby pro-logic.
2. test after test showed dolby pro-logic ii (5.1) and pro-logic iix (7.1) are vastly superior to any &quot;simulated&quot; or &quot;virtual&quot; (turtle beach and others), cmss-3d or any dts decoding.
3. i could only find 4 sound cards using pro-logic ii, iix (available through 3.5mm outputs, not optical or digital).
they are the: asus xonar dx pci-e($80), auzuntech x-meridian ($150 but discontinued), bluegears b-enspirer ($100), razor barracuda ac1 ($200).
to answer my own original question, if you want quality stereo to 5.1 or 7.1 conversion using multi-channel speakers with 3.5mm plugs (most speakers), you need dolby pro-logic (not dolby live!, dolby digital or other dolby).
least expensive dolby pro-logic card: asus $80.
note: daniel k. has developed drivers that allow cmss-3d to work on audigy cards.
