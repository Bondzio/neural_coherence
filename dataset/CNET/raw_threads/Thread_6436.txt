I will be putting the TV on this media stand i got from office depot, with the PS3 under it. I want to get a surge protector that you directly plug into both sockets on wall, has minimum 6 plugs, and protects the cable TV line. The reason for the number of outlets is i will also be plugging in my cell phone charger and a lamp, as the stand is next to a desk. I want it wall-mountable to save room.

You can use them AND a strip surge protector(plug into) that may allow better access for AC warts and such. I do suggest don't use all plug-ins as you may turn the AC outlet into electrical &quot;hot spot&quot;. If you can, use yet another AC outlet. I understand you maybe limited but its important as a safety fire issue. If you like spend better $ on protection as you're items are high cost, its worth it. As an added note, I put &quot;singular plug surge protector&quot; at the end of a AC cord, then into the strip or wall protector and/or UPS. It seems redundant, but I've experienced mucho lightening hits over the yrs.. tada -----Willy
