Some BIOS's have modes where the SATA emulates IDE Primary or Secondary with a limitation of 2 drives.
Also in full mode where all IDE and SATA works stresses people new to this since it requires XP to be fed SATA motherboard drivers during install or XP declares there is no hard disks.
This is all I can share since you didn't tell which mode you used.
