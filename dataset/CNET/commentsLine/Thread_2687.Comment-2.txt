since we know that there is a difference in bands, a router with auto-setting channel would always pick the euro wifi channels since here in the usa those channels are often vacant.
if you were unlucky to leave all the gear in a mix and match euro and usa/na settings all your troubles could have you pointing fingers at every maker over this.
more at  notice how channels 12, 13 and 14 could cause trouble for some?
