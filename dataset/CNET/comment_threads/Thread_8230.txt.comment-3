Thanks Bob.
Glad to see you're still helping in the forums.
Been awhile since I was here.
I'm beginning to think there may be an incorrect RAID setting, even though I'm not using raid.
The VIA raid driver is installed, and I can access RAID through BIOS, but for some reason I can't change any settings.
I'll get back to you if I find whats happening with the RAID controller.
