I certainly hope when you say, &quot;disconnect and reconnect&quot; you're talking the cable from card to monitor.
If not and you actually unplug the card when &quot;ON&quot;, you probably did damage.
If the cable, make sure to inspect the pins aren't bent or pushed-in.
Otherwise, get a new card but be prepared for a possible mtrbd.
replacement too, if you're not lucky.
At least that's what you post appears to me.
