That is just it, I don't want it to copy what is on the card.
If I get a 16 GB model that is 33% full with apps, books, and such, and I have a 16 GB card that is 75% full with movies, it can't copy everything from the card to the memory.
And I don't want it to.
I specifically want the card to be expandable memory, so I can have the OS, books, some music, and any apps that I want on the tablet memory, and I want to be able to put movies onto a SD card so I can swap them out.
I want to be keep the tablet memory as clean as possible.
As to Jelly Bean, well, if worse comes to worse, I have a guy that can do some stuff for me if needed.
