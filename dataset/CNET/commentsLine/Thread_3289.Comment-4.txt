what about the rest of the system?
there's no use in getting an x850 xtpe if all you have is a p3 933. i'll go ahead and say that when getting a 19&quot; lcd screen, be very careful.
make sure to buy one with a response time of under 16ms, or else you'll get major ghosting in-game, as most 19&quot; lcd monitors do.
i'm assuming you have a mid-range to weak computer, so i'll suggest a 9600xt
