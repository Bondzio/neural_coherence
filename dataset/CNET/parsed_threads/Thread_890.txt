<s> I have a desktop computer that supports 184-pin DDR RAM PC-2700, but clocks it at a PC-2100. </s>
<s> If I bought a PC-3200 RAM and fit it next to my PC-2700 RAM, would it work on my computer? </s>
<s> work as fast the slowest RAM in the system. </s>
<s> Should work...just not max system performance. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> It seems that now all hardware have been upgraded. </s>
<s> Wonderful. </s>
<s> It is so long time not to focus on the computer. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> When installing ram, it usually is &quot;auto-configuring&quot; within limits to set itself. </s>
<s> So, with a report of PC2100, then there's a PC2100 installed or its grossly set itself in order to work at all. </s>
<s> I use PC Wizard 2010 to review ram installed for detailed look. </s>
<s> As already stated to you, the ram installed will work as fast as the slowest ram. </s>
<s> Unless, you swap out all ram to be PC3200, it can work at PC3200 level. </s>
<s> But, you state your system supports PC2700 level, so while the PC3200 will work, the bios may only allow that PC2700 level, rather than PC3200. </s>
<s> If possible a bios update may correct for that(if applicable), but it worth a look. </s>
<s> Refer to your current bios status with the latest available. </s>
<s> Even, w/o a bios update, the system should accept PC3200. </s>
<s> The best scenario is all ram be PC3200, mismatches can cause issues of their own. </s>
