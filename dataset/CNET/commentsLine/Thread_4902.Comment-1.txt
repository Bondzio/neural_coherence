i'd hate to think they were intentional, but my suspicions have been aroused.
i recently purchased a seagate internal ultra ata/100 200-gb hard drive.
installed in my system were two identical maxtor diamondback plus 9 160-gb ata/133.
copying the contents of my master to the seagate, i booted up.
that's when i got the post message &quot;no 80-pin conductor cable installed.&quot; i tried both maxtor drives as slaves with the same result.
i changed the pin settings from cs to slave with the same result.
only when i put the two maxtor drives together again did the drives work.
is this mere coincidence or is there a bug in one of the drivers or controllers?
i also tried three different 80-pin connectors with the same results.
no way can i get the seagate and maxtor drives to work together.
i've got some data i'd very much like to get from one drive to the other, but i'm stumped.
i've used maxtor drives for years with no problems, so naturally i'm suspicious about seagate.
any ideas of what may be wrong?
