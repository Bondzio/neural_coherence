Max it gives HD a new out look on HD. Goes for about 795.00 on sale. A little more than you said you wanted to pay. But well worth it. It Rocks! No I mean It really rocks back and forth, Tilts and Telescopes about 6'' Versatile and very cool. Will accept HDMI or Db25 or both and comes with the HDMI cable

It's native res is 1680x1050 but you'll be using the analog VGA inputs and running at 1360x768 or 1280x720. You should demo the unit first at a local BB to make sure it's scaling is acceptable to you. http://www.viewsonic.com/products/desktopdisplays/lcddisplays/xseries/vx2025wm/#specs
