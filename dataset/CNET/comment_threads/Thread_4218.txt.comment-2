I highly suggest you actually go to a store, bring your power supply with you and see which one is exactly like yours.
I had to replace my aging PSU, bought one from the internet and guess what it didn't fit.
I brought my PSU to my CompUsa and I got the right PSU.
Remember size and desgin matters ^^.
