1.5 amps?
whoever gave you that info must be wrong because you can't even run a computer with 1.5 amps on the 12v rail.
my computer came from hp with a 300w power supply with 19a on the 12v rail.
it was powering a pentium 4, one hard drive, two dvd drives, and a radeon x600.
hp gave you the wrong information; don't cancel the order; just look at the sticker on the psu when you receive it.
