hi guys, my pc has 2 wd wide scsi hard drives, each 9.1 gb.
i want to replace them with 2 bigger eide hard drives of 40gb each.
my motherboard supports both scsi and eide interfaces, and also there is a raid slot( not in use).
my question is if it is possible to do and how do i go about doing it?
i would greatly appreciate your support on this one guys.
thanks temu
