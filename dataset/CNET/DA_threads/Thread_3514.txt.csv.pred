1.1.9	I have been looking for info on these subjects for days.Can I plug in any ATX board with faster chip ?	Ques
1.1.10	Can I plug in any & quot ; slot 1 & quot ; chip ?	Ques
1.1.11	Is there a different & quot ; chipset & quot ; # or term I need to look for about this processor .	Ques
1.1.12	Would rather spend $ on upgrading processor than on more ram ( only 2 slots ) .	St
1.1.13	Need HELP ! !	St
1.1.14	!	St
1.2.1	Is n't upgradable , really .	St
1.2.2	A new motherboard and processor are needed as a bundle , then you 'll need RAM to match .	St
1.2.3	I just rebuilt my web server and got an Elitegroup K8M800-M2 motherboard with onboard sound , video , and LAN , an AMD Sempron 1.6 GHz processor , 512 Meg of Kingston RAM .	St
1.2.4	The board cost $ 79.99 , the processor cost $ 59.99 , and the RAM cost $ 59.99 .	St
1.2.5	I kept the HD and optical drive .	St
1.2.6	The board also has 6 USB-2 ports .	St
1.2.7	I found an OEM copy of WP Home here http : //www.edirectsoftware.com/WindowsXPHome.html I installed everything in about a day .	St

1.3.1	You can get a good power supply most anywhere .	St
1.3.2	I put in an Antec 350 .	St
1.3.3	Seems like it was about forty bucks .	St
1.4.1	I 've been looking at bundled ATX motherboards and CPU ( P3 's usually around 800mhz ) but was not sure if they would plug in/fit in the case and work with my existing dvd rom and floppy .	St
1.4.2	Also power is now a question .	St
1.4.3	Do I have to upgrade power with upgraded board ?	Ques
1.4.4	Currently running a 200-250 watt power supply .	St
1.5.1	One thing to keep in mind is that Dell , HP , Compact and Gateway will use NON standard cases and MB .	St
1.5.2	So a Standard ATX MB may NOT fit in your Gateway case .	St
1.5.3	A PII is probably a AT case fromat so an ATX MB will not fit .	St
1.5.4	Save up you money and plan on building a NEW PC .	St
1.5.5	Outpost.com has a AMD Sempron 2400+ and ECS MB for $ 70 .	St
1.5.6	Get a new case for $ 50 with a 400wPSU on sale .	St
1.5.7	A stick of 512mb DDRPC 3200 for $ 40 after rebate .	St
1.5.8	A DVD burner for $ 40 .	St
1.5.9	a 128mb video card is $ 50 .	St
1.5.10	John	St
1.6.1	During my research I came across someone saying this computer had a ATX board .	St
1.6.2	How can I tell what type it is .	St
1.6.3	I have opened case before to install cd-rw drive and Lan card but have no idea how to tell motherboards apart .	St
1.7.1	Here is a link to help .	St
1.7.2	go to the MB section and click on the picture to enlarge .	St
1.7.3	It shows a standard ATX MB .	St
1.7.4	http : //www.build-your-own-computer-tips.com/index.html This shows a typical ATX MB compare the postion of the keyboard and mouse plugs to yours .	St

1.8.1	If you want , you can tell us the details of your motherboard .	St
1.8.2	Download Belarc Advisor and run it .	St
1.8.3	It will give you details on all your system hardware and a lot of the software .	St
1.8.4	http : //www.download.com/Belarc-Advisor/3000-2094_4-10406799.html ? tag=lst-0-1 Copy what it says under & quot ; Main Circuit Board & quot ; and paste into this discussion .	St
1.9.1	A simple way to get a lot of details about your system ( and usually a motherboard manual ) is to enter your computer serial number here : http : //support.gateway.com/support/default.asp ? cmlid=support_top	Ques
1.10.1	The slot 1 transistion to socket 370 ended with some PIIIs running at 600mh .	St
1.10.2	There were 2 mounting hardware configurations , as I recall .	St
1.10.3	I had one ASUS board I remember converting to accept the PIII module .	St
1.10.4	After 600mh it was socket 370 .	St
1.10.5	So , you might find an old 600mh slot 1 module out there .	St
1.10.6	If it 's cheap enough , it might be worth a try .	St
1.11.1	Board : Intel Corporation RC440BX AA718142-207 Serial Number : ISRC84214592 Bus Clock : 100 megahertz BIOS : Intel Corp. 4R4CB0XA.15A.0010.P03.9809011626 09/01/98 Thanks for the info	St
1.12.1	I still have my PIII 500MHz machine from Gateway .	St
1.12.2	It is a Slot 1 board that can take a PII or PIII .	St
1.12.3	I ca n't remember the exact model number , but it 's an Intel Tabor something-or-other that can take up to a 550MHz PIII .	St
1.12.4	Ah , the memories ... .	St
1.13.1	My boards layout is almost exactly like that one ( build you own computer site ) and my case hase two spacers/connectors lower than my board to accomodate a board with more PCI slots .	St
1.13.2	Unlike specs for my computer I have seen , mine only has 2 RAM slots .	St
1.14.1	Thanks for the info I 'm beginning to wonder if I should n't bite the bullet and buy a new PC and give this one to the kids .	St
1.14.2	But with money as tight as it is , just trying to pinch pennies and get all I can out of ths machine .	St
1.15.1	RC440BX motherboard http : //support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/rc440bx/ RC440BX Technical Info ( 458K PDF ) ftp : //download.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/rc440bx/71383201.pdf	St
1.16.1	I went through the same thing with my PIII HP .	St
1.16.2	I ended up scrapping everything but the optical drives and keyboard .	St
1.16.3	You can get a new case for a little as $ 25 , a motherboard/CBU combo deal for about $ 60 , 512 MB memory sticks for $ 50 , and an OEM operating system for $ 80 .	St
1.16.4	Do n't forget the power supply ( $ 40 ) and CPU fan/heat sink ( $ 20 ) .	St
1.16.5	I 'm quoting prices from memory , so I could be a tad off .	St
1.16.6	When you add it all up , you 'd probably spend about as much as you would for one of Walmart 's boxed entry-level sets .	St
1.16.7	But what 's the fun of that ?	Ques
1.17.1	Seems to me all your problems ly on you motherboard .	St
1.17.2	If you want new technology , get a motherboard with a socket that can handle fast cpu 's , and many of those motherboards come with x16 pci slot for a high end graphics card .	St
1.17.3	Many motherboards also have SLI compatibility for 2 graphics cards .	St
1.17.4	With a new motherboard , new CPU , graphics card , and more memory , your system will be up and running like brand new .	St
1.17.5	I also highly advise you get a new OS , like XP Home .	St
1.18.1	It looks like an interesting project for the properly motivated .	St
1.18.2	Here 's what I found by doing a quick check through the Intel docs .	St
1.18.3	Current BIOS : 4R4CB0XA.15A.0010.P03.9809011626 09/01/98 Newer BIOS available : 4R4CB0XA.86A.0020.P14 6/27/2000 The ''Motherboard Specification Update '' PDF says that the new bios should enable the board to take ''Slot 1 '' ( 242-contact ) PIII processors up to 600MHZ .	St
1.18.4	The BIOS also enables the memory slots to take a 256MB module for a total of 512MB .	St
1.18.5	It 's up to you , but the money that you spend on the upgrades of the old computer could get you a long way towards the low-end Pentium 4 or AMD CPU systems that have been suggested in this discussion .	St
1.18.6	Anyhow , the BIOS Update is free : RCBIOS14.EXE	St
1.19.1	So can I assume that this means any standard ATX board will fit into my case ?	Ques
1.19.2	And if so will work with existing hardware ?	Ques
1.20.1	That was one of the questions I had in my original post .	St
1.20.2	I am wondering if it is just that easy , get a newer ATX board with a faster processor and heatsink , more ram , possibly a larger power supply , and just plug it into my case and existing peripherals .	St
1.20.3	Is it going to be that easy ?	Ques
1.20.4	Will any ATX standard mobo work ?	Ques
1.21.1	'' So can I assume that this means any standard ATX board will fit into my case ? ''	Ques
1.21.2	Not necessarily .	St
1.21.3	Look on P.12 of the Technical Information PDF .	St
1.21.4	Section ''1.1 Overview '' says the motherboard was made in microATX ( 9.6 '' x 9.6 '' ) and full ATX ( 12.0 '' x 9.6 '' ) sizes .	St
1.21.5	Which one do you have ?	Ques
1.21.6	You could put a microATX board in a number of standard case sizes , but you ca n't put a full ATX board in the smaller ATX cases .	Sug
1.21.7	If you are going to get a new motherboard that can accommodate a more recent CPU ( P4 , Athlon 64 , dual cores ) , the other components will have to be of a more recent generation as well .	St
1.21.8	This includes the power supply unit ( PSU ) .	St
1.21.9	New components probably will need a new case to ensure proper cooling , fit larger fans , accommodate larger heatsinks , et al .	St
1.21.10	There are good deals on new cases that come with PSU 's .	St
1.22.1	Look at all the different case sizes listed under & quot ; Type & quot ; http : //www.newegg.com/ProductSort/SubCategory.asp ? SubCategory=7	Ques
1.23.1	I 'd just worry about starting with the CPU you want and then add a motherboard .	St
1.23.2	From that base you can add other components , including the case and PSU .	St
1.23.3	The way you decide on the CPU and motherboard is first to ask yourself what you want the computer to be able to do .	St
1.24.1	Yes I did see that part .	St
1.24.2	My board appears to be a micro .	St
1.24.3	( 9.6 & quot ; x 9.6 & quot ; ) But my case has 3 & quot ; vertical clearance from bottom of mobo to bottom of case and extra set of connectors to accomadate ( I assume ) the larger board with more pci slots .	St
1.24.4	my case has 2 pci slot openings in it that can not be utilized with existing board due to its size .	St
1.24.5	If I ca n't get a P4 ( no biggie ) can i get a P3 ( or older athlon , not really up to snuff on their products ) around 800mhz and still utilize existing peripherals , i.e .	St
1.24.6	dvd rom and floppy .	St
1.24.7	( also psu ) I 'm only trying to get as much as i can without building or buying all new computer .	St
1.24.8	If it will only be a 600mhz processor I can get that probably wo n't be worth the effort and I would probably just build a newer computer ( first time ) to save $ .	St
1.25.1	According to the specifications of the upgraded BIOS on your current mobo , you should be able to upgrade to this Slot1 PIII 600MHz processor ; however I give no guarantees .	St
1.25.2	For the price , it may be worth the tinkering .	St
1.25.3	http : //www.geeks.com/products.asp ? cat=CPU Problem is that you will still be limited with the 600MHz PIII .	St
1.25.4	A lot of today 's hardware and software needs a faster processor or one with a specific instruction set .	St
1.25.5	I think you are right -- probably the only case items you could bring to the new build are the DVD and floppy drives .	St
1.26.1	well it 's looking like I have a building project on my hands to get the results I really want .	St
1.26.2	Thanks for all the info and your help .	St
