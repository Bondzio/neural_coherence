<s> Standard wireless equipment might be able to go 50 meters through unobstructed outdoor space. </s>
<s> 10 meters if there are obstructions, such as trees. </s>
<s> A kilometer is feasible only under very good conditions and with specialized adaptations of the equipment by an experienced technician. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
