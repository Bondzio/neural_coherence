Their products are so inferior, they inspired my below limericks. They cost me hundreds in monetary loss, health loss, & aggravation. Samsung & a zillion other far-eastern-based companies have terrible customer support to boot. SAMSUNG ML-2510 PRINTER LIMERICK These printers cause lights to start blinking Their infernal noise sets hearts sinking Each warm-up takes AGES Then WHAM! OUT SHOOT pages Can't someone be sued for poor thinking? SAMSUNG SYNCMASTER-SERIES LCD's LIMERICK Samsung's LCDs made me ill, Epoxies outgassed like to kill! Strong phosphors so silent They seemed quite non-violent... Yet proved worse than some poisoned pill!

Or regular people who are just barely trying to scrape by, ever since the world has become so runaway high-tech filled with ever more toxic junk from the east? Even CNET (believe it or not) posted something about it: http://www.cnet.com/4520-6022_1-105148-1.html Also see Etoxics.org Toxics In Electronics: http://www.etoxics.org/site/PageServer?pagename=svtc_toxics_in_electronics And why should something need to be overpriced just to be non-toxic? Ditto for &quot;health foods&quot;. Once upon a time, &quot;natural flavoring&quot; was par for the course at your local market. Nowadays, natural flavoring is considered a health-food item. Does that make sense? Maybe to you (judging by your above post). Not to me.

But the good news is that for a fraction of what we paid a few years ago we get quite a nice printer. I take it you didn't remember the days when PC owners didn't usually have a printer? Bob

In the 90's I owned an Okidata laser printer (forgot the model) that cost me a couple hundred, but it was solid stuff, printed 6ppm - smooth, no problems. Then it became discontinued (why??) and that was that. I couldn't get new cartridges, had to discard it. Then a few years ago, I bought a used HP 6L laser (now in my basement, still functioning, still some toner left, but very slow at printing). I'm seriously considering bringing it back upstairs, because it's quiet, not a power guzzler and I can feed sheets individually. I may get rid of the Samsung if I can, despite its 12ppm. Why should I hold onto something that consumes as much power as a blowdryer each time I use it, and wait for it to warm up just to SHOOT out the very few pages I usually need? I think some of the worst villains are companies such as Underwriters Labs and EnergyStar (the latter approves toxic LCDs & HDTVs). They shouldn't just approve products only on the basis of electric operation or energy efficiency! What about toxins! As an aside, I have an EnergyStar Kenmore SBS fridge, yet it seems to be running all the time (so much for energy savings). As far as I'm concerned, the UL & EnergyStar labels are worth zilch.

I know as moderator you have the upper hand, and therefore consider yourself justified, but what I'd like is for you to stop picking on me. Had you truly wanted to &quot;educate&quot; me, then in the other forum you'd have explained the name of the 4' cable I'm seeking as per my last response to you. Instead, you chose to vilify me, why I don't know. Why bother to give a &quot;villain&quot; useful info? Instead you respond in ways which cause threads to drag out. That way, I can be accused of ranting. I challenge any other hopefully-objective third-party to read the above thread carefully, as well as the below link to my recent post, and decide who posted innocently, with a basic Q, and who responded in an unwarranted way. But again, I know you have the upper hand, so regardless, you'll do as you wish.
