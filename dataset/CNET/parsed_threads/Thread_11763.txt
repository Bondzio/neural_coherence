<s> Hello, I realize my question is going to be a bit vague, but I have a computer, windows XP SP3, that has a main HD (C:) and a storage drive (G:). </s>
<s> There's nothing on the storage drive other than misc. </s>
<s> stuff like pictures taken, pdf files, work stuff etc. </s>
<s> (no installed software). </s>
<s> If I were to remove this, can I just as easily reinsert it and have it work as before or do I need to do something special to ensure the G: drive is read again? </s>
<s> But some do this and lose access to the drive contents. </s>
<s> I'll skip all the scenarios why this happens but sure, if you have a backup copy of what you can't lose, you're ready. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> possibly a big but... We don't know what your computer is. </s>
<s> For example mine is a &quot;Tools free&quot; Desktop tower from Alienware. </s>
<s> Tools free means all I have to do is shutdown, disconnect the power, remove the side panel, discharge myself of static, then unclip a couple of connections and pull the drive tray out. </s>
<s> What makes it easier is that the drives are all SATA conventional and no SSDs to confuse the issue. </s>
<s> What computer is yours? </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> Hello and thanks for the help. </s>
<s> It's your run-of-the-mill E-Machine desktop. </s>
<s> Nothing too fancy and removing would only require what you described Mark. </s>
<s> I believe the HDs are SATA. </s>
<s> Those go missing all the time. </s>
<s> Be sure you have what you can't lose on backups. </s>
