1.4.1	The i810 may not have a disable.	St
1.4.2	And if you read the HP Forums you find you've selected a problematic combo.	St
1.4.3	But let us try anyway.	Sug
1.4.4	Since we don't disable the i810 video, we just set the AGP or PCI to be the primary display and then connect the display to the card/connection we want.	St
1.4.5	Then we install the ATI drivers.	St
1.4.6	NO!	St
1.4.7	We don't uninstall the i810 video drivers.	St

1.6.22	If that doesn't do it, then it's likely you are like many other owners and need to try a Nvidia card.	St
1.6.23	Bob	St
1.7.1	per manual meaning put in the right PCI slot because manual says to first disable old graphics card which is what brought me here!	St

1.8.3	Some don't have a disable.	St
1.8.4	But I already noted this.	St
1.8.5	So we get to leave it alone and trudge forward.	St
1.8.6	Some get stuck at this step for a very long time.	St
1.8.7	&quot;Step 4 Do you mean connect to onboard monitor port or new Radeon monitor port that works.&quot; You use the one that works.	St
1.8.8	&quot;Step 5 Can u explain how to access BIOS Im installing PCI card.&quot; If the Radeon is the boot display, we don't need to do this.	St
1.8.9	&quot;Step 6 Switch monitor ports if needed?&quot; Use the one that works.	St

1.9.21	OK	St
1.10.1	You wrote that the video appeared on the new Radeon card so we have no reason to &quot;check&quot; the BIOS.	St
1.10.2	As I previously wrote, your selection of card and machine is not assured to work.	St
1.10.3	You can read many horror stories about it, but I have supplied what I do to get the ones that will work to install.	St
1.10.4	If it doesn't, then you won't see any magic fix from me.	St

1.11.3	You did mention the HP forums http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?product=81921&lang=en&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&docname=bph06273 This is very helpful but still confusing I have installed the card with those steps mentioned and still having unsure doubts weather or not its installed right One thing is when i open Device manager under Display adapters RADEON 7500 SERIES this seems to be right But then I see this new catagory called ?	Ques

1.12.1	If your new card is working, then enjoy it.	St
1.12.2	If you must have a &quot;clean&quot; device manager, I'd have to visit the machine.	St
1.12.3	By forum its tough since some will do odd things that I don't know about.	St
1.12.4	I did write that I don't uninstall the old drivers, but some try anyway and that's where the items will show on i810 based systems.	St
1.12.5	ATI makes instructions that work for 98% or better of the machines out there.	St
1.12.6	For you, you need better.	St
1.12.7	Hope this helps, Bob	St
1.13.1	Where do I check to see if the new card has been installed and recognized for sure?	St

1.15.2	Last install i thought the game was running fine then i was bombarded with errors like INS5576,OLEAUT32dll and would only start in safe mod Also ATI has informed me not to pay any attention to thier so called PC Check has a few bugs in it http://64.4.53.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=346a15a8c7ac13bd4eec067ac83dcd79&lat=1097193960&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2eati%2ecom%2fsupport%2finfobase%2f4068%2ehtml	St
