i bought a cyberpower pc because i could pretty much have what i was looking for without going through the hassle of building my own.
the pc came in excellent shape and ran as expected.
the 'fly in the soup' is their tech support be it via telephone or email.
they both suck big time!
i've own they system about a month now so no hardware failures per say.
my only real problem came when i had to get update the bios to get the asus o/c program to work.
the bios upgrade caused my 12 in 1 card reader to stop working.
after trying to get support via phone(which i only could get a recording) that they would call me back(they never did)and or via email i gave up and fixed on my own by reloading win xp.
so essentially you are on your own!
