<s> I was wondering which multifunction printer is better? </s>
<s> Also was having a hard time finding out, how much memory Epson 4540 has? </s>
<s> http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Product.do?sku=C11CB32201 The memory is usually enough to perform the tasks given. </s>
<s> As such, few printers offer how much ram is in the printer. </s>
<s> Can you share with the forum why this matters? </s>
<s> According to a conversation with Epson, the Epson Workforce Pro 4540 do not have memory like other printers. </s>
<s> They also didn't want to comment on how it works either. </s>
<s> About comparing the two Epson Workforce Pro 4540 vs HP Officejet Pro 8600 Premium, which one would you lean towards and why? </s>
<s> My findings so far: according to just specs sheets the HP 8600 looks good but according to videos the Epson 4540 looks pretty good =\ </s>
<s> Since Epson won't talk to you about your concerns, the other models wins by default. </s>
