1.1.1	Hi , I just bought an online game and ca n't get the CD to run/install .	St
1.1.2	When I place CD in , it blinks for several minutes and the little & quot ; cd icon & quot ; at curser blinks on and off , but then nothing happens .	St
1.1.3	If I go to run and select the drive it says to place disc in drive , when it is already there .	St
1.1.4	One time when I canceled at the & quot ; insert CD in to drive D & quot ; box , my computer went completly blank except for the wallpaper .	St
1.1.5	All the icons , the bar at bottom , everything .	St
1.1.6	I also tried both drives .	St
1.1.7	I inserted other CD 's in and they work .	St
1.1.8	I then tried with my laptop and it installed with no problems .	St
1.1.9	It says it is compatible with Vista and XP SP2 .	St
1.1.10	My laptop has vista .	St
1.1.11	My desktop has XP with SP3 .	St
1.1.12	Both computers exceed the minimum requirements of the game , actually they exceed the recommended ones too .	St
1.1.13	Is it possible the disc is not backwards compatible to SP2 when I have SP3 installed ?	Ques
1.1.14	I tried googling the problem , could n't find anything , TIA for any replies .	St

1.2.1	Such as how an online game came to be on said CD .	St
1.3.1	and look at its contents with Windows Explorer or My Computer .	St
1.3.2	No dice ?	Ques
1.3.3	Then , somehow , this particular player wo n't recognize this particular disk .	St
1.3.4	Can happen , especially with burned disks .	St
1.3.5	Things to try then : - Clean the disk - Clean the drive - Replace the drive - Return the disk and get your money back - Copy the disk on another machine and hope the new copy will be readable Everything fine in Windows Explorer ?	Ques
1.3.6	Find the autorun.inf or the setup.exe and do a manual install .	St
1.3.7	Kees	St
1.4.1	It 's a multiplayer online game , does n't have ability to buy/download online .	St
1.4.2	It 's copy protected .	St
1.4.3	Tried all the things you suggested , short of replacing the drive .	St
1.4.4	Tried autorun and manual with the setup.exe , it wo n't even recognize the disk .	St
1.4.5	Guess it 's just one of those things .	St
1.4.6	Seemed wierd that both the drives on one computer would not read it , but could install on my laptop .	St
1.4.7	They may be the same brand ? , but different models .	St
1.4.8	One is faster double layer dvd/cd burner , the other just a player .	St
1.4.9	Thanks for replies .	Polite
1.5.1	Try exchanging it .	St
