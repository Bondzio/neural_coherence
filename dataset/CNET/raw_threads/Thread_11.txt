That's nothing my HDTV will display so cloning that display should result in a dead end. It makes sense to me. As to those other folk they may not have your netbook. On top of that you elected to not share make and model. The extended display does work here as long as I set it to something compatible. -&gt; I don't want to upset you but why the lack of make, models, cables used, settings and what that USB to HDMI thing is? The USB to HDTV link I know of required some driver install and setup yet your post is so light on details that I can't see where it went wrong. Bob

My laptop is Asus Eee the only info I have on graphics card is Nvidia Ion. The wireless is nyrius Aries. It consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter is a dongle that attaches to laptop with a HDMI male to laptop female and also to the USB INPUT on the laptop for power. The receiver is a box that attaches to the HDTV via a male HDMI Cable and to the wall A/C outlet. Perhaps you can find it on google under Nyrius Aries HDMI wireless connection. That's where I bought it. I send them an email but they have not replied!

If it didn't work with just the HDMI then adding this wireless HDMI only muddies the conversation. I'd head back to wired and see if we can find the user's manual fort this computer. You look too. I'll be back later. Bob

Page Tools Solution The LCD and CRT display output from Intel GPU. The HDMI display output from Nvidia GPU. Because the Nvidia GPU can't sync intel display data for calpella platform,So that is Nvidia GPU limitation for this architecture.
