<s> My brother has the only computer connected to the internet in the house and refuses to let us set up a home network because he's paranoid. </s>
<s> Is there any way to hook up both a wireless router and his computer to the cable modem seperately? </s>
<s> I'd hate to have to get a whole seperate cable hookup. </s>
<s> Some modems have the standard Ethernet connection and a USB connection. </s>
<s> Some allow both to be used at the same time, some don't. </s>
<s> You'll just have to investigate the modems available to you. </s>
<s> If a modem will allow both connections, connect his using the USB port, and then connect a router using the Ethernet port for the other PCs. </s>
<s> I think I'd have a heart to heart with my brother. </s>
<s> Just don't set up SHARING and have him use a strong password on his system but if he is that paranoid, personally, I'd get my own hook up and even use a different server. </s>
<s> I had a friend some time back with a similar issue and eventually that is what happened, separate hook ups and different service providers, what a nightmare that was! </s>
