Heck, if the store display didn't work, then don't wait return it!
The time in *now* to return it as store policies are far more friendlier within 15days or less.
I'm sure you touched on all the issues that effect the setup, but Nvidia have been a sore issue with Vista.
OEM's are waiting still for such, plus if the monitor is not stated as Vista capable it too can fall through the cracks until a later time its 100% fixed or accepted in the fold, let them fix it.
