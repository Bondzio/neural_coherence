most likely the new drive is a faster drive than the old 60GB.
So I would definitely use acronis to copy the drive.
us the entire 200 GB for c and use the 60 GB as storage for things you dont access often and for things you really want to keep.
if XP ever, God forbid, does crash your pictures and documents will be safe on the 60 GB drive.
as for master and slave.
making both discs cable select is the easiest.then you can change the drive letter in acronis or in xp by way of control panel/administrative tools/computer management/ disk management.
good luck
