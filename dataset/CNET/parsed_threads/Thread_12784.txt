<s> I am very confused. </s>
<s> I have an old ATX power supply. </s>
<s> I would like it to become the replacement for a worn out Emachines AT power supply. </s>
<s> I can't seem to find the right cable or adapter I need. </s>
<s> I did find an ATX to AT converter but it looked like the ATX side was male and I need it to be female. </s>
<s> plz help. </s>
<s> This plans to be my Linux learning tool </s>
<s> I just double checked and the electrical pins that would be on the cable should be male. </s>
