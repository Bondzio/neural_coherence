Thanks, I looked at the EVent viewer again and everything is pretty much seconds to a minute apart in time.
As for Anti-Virus, he is running McAffee Anti-Virus and does not have any other anti-virus type program or optimizers, he wouldn't even know what to do with most of those other programs.
I'm not sure if this would qualify as a registry cleaner, maybe since it gets rid of programs, but he does have Revo Uninstaller.
He said he hasn't uninstalled anything in months, though.
He has been having problems with his USB ports for some time also, which is what made me wonder if his PC is just slowly dying part by part.
