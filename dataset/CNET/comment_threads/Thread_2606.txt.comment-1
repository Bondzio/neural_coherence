I've been happy with a Canon Pixma iP2000 printer, and can replace the 2 ink cartridges for less than $2.00 each.
A new Canon printer, &quot;free&quot; with my camera purchase, uses proprietary cartridges which cost $30 each, so I'd like to find a replacement for my trusty iP2000 which will use generic and inexpensive ink.
Do you have recommendations?
