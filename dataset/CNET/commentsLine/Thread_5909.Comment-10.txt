if you have a router on your home network.
the main thing you'll need to do is set both of them up in the same workgroup.
go to &quot;start&quot;, &quot;control panel&quot;, on the &quot;system&quot; icon right click then choose &quot;properties&quot;, on the &quot;computer name&quot; tab then choose the &quot;to rename this computer or change its domain or workgroup&quot; button, and then pick the same name for the workgroup on both computers.
after doing this on the desktop go into &quot;windows explorer&quot;, right click on the &quot;cd/dvd&quot; drive, and adjust it to be shared.
to see the drive on the netbook click on &quot;windows explorer&quot;, then scroll down and click on &quot;network&quot;, then click on the desktop pc, and then click on the cd/dvd drive.
if you want to share other folders simply right click them and share them similar to the above.
