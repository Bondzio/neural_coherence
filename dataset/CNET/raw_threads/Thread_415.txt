4820	0	549104	5239991	NR	Dezlan	12/2/11 9:45 AM	1.3228191E12	Is my power supply faulty?	First off my system specs- &lt;span&gt; 8GB kingston, HyperX X2 Grey DDR3 RAM &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; XFX, Radeon HD 6950 1GB GPU &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; Samsung 1TB SpinPoint SATA &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; LITE-ON, Blue-ray disk Combo Drive &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; MSI H67MA-E45 MoBo &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; Thermaltake TR2 Standard 500W Power supply- 24 Pin &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; Intel Core i7-2600 Quad core 3.4Ghz &lt;span&gt; Now for my problem- (I don't know a ton about computers, but i'll try to describe it to the best of my ability) A few weeks ago, my PC started cutting off without warning- then it would boot back up and either run fine or cut off again within 10-30 mins. I set my computer to not cut off if it encountered a problem with the RAM, instead it would show the blue error screen- Haven't seen it yet, so i'm assuming it's not that. I've also heard that software issues can cause a system to fail, so i'm booted into safe-mode at the moment. Should i just do a full re-install of windows and see if that helps? A few hours ago, my PC cut off and attempted to reboot and cut off a few seconds into it. then repeat. I had to flip the power switch in the rear to stop the process. Is it safe to continue using or should i leave it be until i can figure out the problem? I've heard that power supplies in general can be prone to failing after short periods of time, I've only had this build for about 4-5 months. Any help would be great, i'm pretty lost at the moment. &lt;span&gt;

Also the video card called for &quot;Minimum 500W or greater system power supply&quot; which you supplied. Now go find an oval track and drive your car at 120MPH. How long till it fails? Game machine builders tend to get SINGLE RAIL units and learn to not install the minimum. Bob

This is why more than two wires are needed and more than one connection because the Amperes exceed that of a pin, a connector and so on. Your choice on the PSU but my advice is to go with SINGLE RAIL power supplies unless you know how to figure out what's on each rail, how many Amperes is being drawn on each rail, etc. Most folk do not want to go that deep. Hence, SINGLE RAIL and at least 50% over the minimum. Bob

Go here. http://www.newegg.com/Index.aspx?name=Home Filter by psu. Filter by Corsair or Pc power+cooling. Pick one that's 600w or bigger.......bigger does no harm. Their all single rail units......no fuss.
