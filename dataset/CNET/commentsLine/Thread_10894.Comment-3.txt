no, i haven't received the new monitor yet- should receive it this week.
but i did go into the control panel/display/settings/advance and un-checked &quot;hide modes this monitor can not display.&quot; since i did not see the one i specified above, i am assuming this is an issue with the video-card and not with the monitor driver.
i would hope you are right, but from what i've read, it sounds like i likely need a new card.
