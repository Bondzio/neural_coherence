I had an IDE hard drive in one pc, I wanted to move it from this one to another.
Did that it didn't come up in windows explorer.
Had a look in disk management and it was sitting there without a drive letter, it said unknown disk type, not initialized and unallocated.
Now I have some very important things on this drive I need.
I asked a friend what to do, he said take it back to the original pc and back it up.
Did that, it comes up with the same thing.
Both pc's are XP, I haven't changed it from being the slave drive and there is a master in both pc's.
Can someone help me?
