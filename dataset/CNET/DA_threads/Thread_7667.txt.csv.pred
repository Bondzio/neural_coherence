1.1.1	Hi Im having major problems with my router.	St
1.1.2	We have a linksys WRT54GS, with a desktop connected to it via cable and my laptop running on wireless.	St
1.1.3	Things were ok until a few weeks ago, when my connection started dropping more often (but it would immediately connect by itself a few seconds later).	St
1.1.4	But now, I cant even connect to the internet.	St
1.1.5	Heres the detail: At first, I couldnt even connect to the router, although my laptop would pick up the signal.	St
1.1.6	The router is set to have a network key (WPA or WPA II), so I played around with the connection properties and changed the network authentication to OPEN from SHARED and left data encryption to WEP.	St
1.1.7	Now this time I can connect to the router, access the routers setting and access the other computer, but cant browse the net.	St
1.1.8	Just for ease, Ive disabled the routers security mode now.	St
1.1.9	Im running Windows XP Security Update 2, and I have a Intel Wireless Network card 802.11 b/g.	St
1.1.10	Did I mention HOW ANNOYING this is?	St
1.1.11	I also had another linksys, the WRT54G, and that thing died on me too a while ago.	St
1.1.12	And yes, I have the latest firmware.	St
1.1.13	Thanks everyone.	St
1.2.1	Does this happen with both computers?	St
1.2.2	Does this happen only with wireless on the notebook?	St
1.2.3	Scan for viruses and spyware.	St
1.2.4	If only a wireless problem, try a different broadcast channel (1, 6, or 11).	St
1.2.5	Results?	St
1.3.1	The problem was only with the laptop.	St
1.3.2	The pc worked fine, it was just the laptop that couldn't suft despite being connected to the router.	St
1.3.3	For SOME reason, I was playing around with the connection settings, and even though i didn't change anything at the end, when i disconnected the router and the modem for 30 seconds (I HAD DONE THIS BEFORE AT LEAST A BIZZILLION TIMES) it started working again.	St
1.3.4	I'm guessing there was a problem with my IP???	St
1.3.5	?	Ques
1.4.1	I have problems trying to connect to a shared printer and I can identify with your problem: some solution, if can get on the internet, go www.linksys.com/check site.	St
1.4.2	From there you will be able to have the router through this site, just follow the directions.	St
1.4.3	Or call the linksys tech support at 1-800-326-7114.	St
1.5.1	i have the same router same setup (2 pc's hard wired, wireless laptop) and had the same problem.	St
1.5.2	im new to wireless and had just bought a laptop and router.	St
1.5.3	worked fine for a few weeks then started dropping out more and more.	St
1.5.4	called linksys and went step by step thru configuration and it has been ok since if i remember it had to do with the channel it was on.	St
1.5.5	call them and set it up right.	St
1.5.6	should be fine still cant share the damn printer though lol good luck	Polite
1.6.1	I feel your pain.	St
1.6.2	I still can't get any connection to my printer either.	St
1.6.3	Calling linksys about this annoying problem was a waste of time and effort.	St
1.6.4	I have A Dell Demension 3000 and a linksys WRT54GS.	St
1.7.1	If you have a shared printer on a computer, did you tell the personal firewall on that computer to allow other computers to access it?	St
1.7.2	Maybe set up a &quot;trusted&quot; range of IP addresses in that firewall?	St
1.7.3	- or - Is it a network printer that connects directly to the router or via a print server?	St
1.8.1	the printer is connected to the computer	St
1.9.1	If you are not aware of it, Netstumbler is a great, FREE, site survey tool.	St
1.9.2	It will tell you how stong the signal is and it will tell you all of the other networks within range of your wireless card.	St
1.9.3	It tells you the channel they are using and whether they are encrypted or not.	St
1.9.4	If you are lucky, you will only see devices on channel 1, 6 or 11.	St
1.9.5	Anybody using channels other than this are rookies and need some education on wireless.	St
1.9.6	This is a more scientific approach to choosing a random channel.	St
