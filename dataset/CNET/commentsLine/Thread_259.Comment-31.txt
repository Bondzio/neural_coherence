this sounds like your missing the drivers for your cd/dvd drives.
i also suggest during the boot phase to press the f12 and run the diag's from the &quot;boot uitily part&quot;.
this utility is pre-loaded at os installion on dell systems.
run the express test as a start, then continue to the more advanced tests as needed.
doing a &quot;backup&quot; via your usb external drive, is currently your best option, if the above doesn't correct the problem.
