1.1.1	Hi all , I was experiencing lots of noise coming from my PC case , so I replaced the case fan ( not PSU ) which was the problem .	St
1.1.2	However , I forgot to note whether the fan should be sucking air in or blowing it out ! !	St
1.1.3	I have a temperature display on the front of case and it does n't seem to make any difference if I swap it to & quot ; suck in & quot ; or & quot ; blow out & quot ; ! ! !	St
1.1.4	Any ideas as to what is best ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.1.6	Also I am keen to replace the tower case with a desktop one ( anyone noticed that they are really hard to get hold of nowdays - will have to try eBay ! ) .	St
1.1.7	This is due to my 1 year old daughter switching the power off when my 7 year old son is on the PC - causing lots of grief .	St
1.1.8	I have even changed power button options , but the clever baby has figured that if you hold it in for 10 seconds , it will have her desired effect ! !	St
1.1.9	Anyways , it 's an Athalon XP 1900+ processor , does it matter whether I get a 300W , 350W or 400W PSU ?	Ques
1.1.10	Many thanks Jeff	Polite
1.2.1	What temp gauges does your PC have ?	Ques
1.2.2	Only a case temp ?	Ques
1.2.3	Or does it show the CPU temp , NB temp etc ?	Ques
1.2.4	If your temp gauges do n't show a difference , then , well , it does n't really matter ... As far as a search for a desktop case - try a search for a HTPC ( home theater PC ) case , that 'll get you a few more options .	St
1.3.1	GP air flow ... .in at the bottom out at the top ... test .	St
1.3.2	If that does not work then you adjust to what does work .	St
1.3.3	PSU..get the biggest one that you can afford or that fits .	St
