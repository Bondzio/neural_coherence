1.1.1	I have a d-link and Linksys router .	St
1.1.2	I am wanting to manage them threw network mapping software .	St
1.1.3	I am having trouble finding a freely available one .	St
1.1.4	I have looked at download.com and freewarefiles.com .	St
1.1.5	I am also new to networking so some of the terms I am not 100 % familiar with .	St
1.1.6	Any ideas of what I can use ?	Ques
1.2.1	Read http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=OPEN+SOURCE+network+mapping+software & btnG=Google+Search So & quot ; there you go. & quot ;	St
1.3.1	I want a visual way of monitoring my routers with out having to memorize all there IP addresses .	St
1.4.1	The address is right then in plain sight .	St
1.4.2	I also have other methods but as you can tell there are OPEN SOURCE solutions but this seems like using a sledge hammer to kill a fly .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I know the IP of one router but I also have a modem and a second router I would like to manage or how about companies with multiple routers ?	Ques
1.6.1	I offered the post 17 where we do a little magic with MULTIPLE wifi routers .	St
1.6.2	Your choice here but your last post ended with a flip to the manual to show where the setting was .	St
1.6.3	How is this software going to help if they wo n't use the manuals ?	Ques
1.7.1	I do use the manuals but none of the information given has been helpful .	St
1.7.2	The link was a search of Google which I already have done .	St
1.7.3	I did like network magic but it 's not all free and I still have trouble connecting to me second router threw it or Vista ( Vista does n't even see it . )	St
1.8.1	But in http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html ? forumID=62 & threadID=305666 & messageID=2839604 & tag=mcnt # 2839604 if that 's not you , sorry .	Polite
1.8.2	There are OPEN SOURCE SOLUTIONS HERE .	St
1.8.3	But as presented it 's still a sledge hammer solution to kill a fly .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	Managing multiple routers is different then turning of wifi .	St
1.9.2	They are two different posts .	St
1.9.3	I got that fixed over a day ago .	St
1.9.4	I turned the wifi off on my T-mobile router and now I ca n't configure it .	St
1.9.5	I do not want to have 2 wireless going .	St
1.9.6	I have my D-link working just fine just ca n't see the Linksys .	St
1.10.1	And never use anything more than the web interfaces .	St
1.10.2	I see we 've hit the end here and good luck with your software trials .	St
1.10.3	Bob	St
1.11.1	How can I use web interface when I only know the IP of my D-link .	St
1.11.2	How do I find my Linksys router ?	Ques
1.12.1	Then we look at our machine 's IP configuration and we see that IP there .	St
1.13.1	I know the system IP .	St
1.13.2	I also know the default gateway .	St
1.13.3	Those are not the IP address for the secound router .	St
1.13.4	Changeing the IP info for this system has nothing to do with my DHCP routers other then the default gateway , but I am talking about the router that 's connected to the default gateway .	St
1.14.1	& quot ; I know the system IP .	St
1.14.2	I also know the default gateway .	St
1.14.3	Those are not the IP address for the secound router .	St
1.14.4	Changeing the IP info for this system has nothing to do with my DHCP routers other then the default gateway , but I am talking about the router that 's connected to the default gateway. & quot ; In post 17 I note how to setup dual routers .	St
1.14.5	Your choice here but once you assign the IP you label the router so you know .	St
1.14.6	Good luck , Bob	Polite
1.15.1	What do you mean by post 17 ?	Ques
1.15.2	Can you give a link ?	Ques
1.16.1	Top of the discussions in this forum .	St
1.17.1	Post 17 is for router setup not dual routers .	St
1.17.2	I already have both routers setup .	St
1.17.3	I have the first one as 192.168.1.2 and secound as default IP .	St
1.17.4	The modem is 192.168.0.1 .	St
1.17.5	The 1.2 is the one broadcasting the signal that I canect threw .	St
1.17.6	How do I connect to the other modem ?	Ques
1.18.1	I think you need some basics of networking classes .	St
1.18.2	You could have used my post 17 as a primer on how to setup a dual router system .	St
1.18.3	It appears you are not going to do this or connect a machine to the second router to find and configure it .	St
1.18.4	At this point it appears you need on site support , classes and maybe more .	St
1.18.5	I am not your tech support but can point to links and guides on how to get it done .	St
1.18.6	Since you do n't want to apply yourself and get this done I am electing to unsubscribe from this discussion .	St
1.18.7	Feel free to vent about that but look at your posts .	St
1.18.8	The signs you need direct support are all there .	St
1.18.9	The signs you do not want to work at this are all here .	St
1.18.10	I wish you the best of luck , Bob	Polite
1.19.1	I know how to setup seprate routers .	St
1.19.2	i know I can connect to the secound router wired to make the changes .	St
1.19.3	That is not what I asked .	St
1.19.4	I know how networking works .	St
1.20.1	Look at the DHCP table to get what IP addresses were handed out and enable the management from the WAN on the second router ?	Ques
1.20.2	Hint ?	Ques
1.20.3	The IP address is there and you must configure the router before this will work .	St
1.20.4	It appears you want tech support and not a guide or discussion .	St
1.20.5	Bob	St
1.21.1	How do i find the DHCP table ?	Ques
1.22.1	This is a sure sign you do not want to apply yourself to read the manual .	St
1.22.2	I supplied that earlier .	St
1.22.3	Can you share why you do n't want to work a little at this ?	Ques
1.22.4	Bob	St
1.23.1	I know how to use my D-link trouter which is what the link was for .	St
1.23.2	How has that to do with my T mobile one ?	Ques
1.24.1	Since simple answers do not work for you such as looking at your Dlink 's router table and enabling the other router 's remote management , it 's time for me to call this discussion closed .	St
1.24.2	- & gt ; I 'm going to be blunt here .	St
1.24.3	You need tech support on your location and sitting with you .	St
1.24.4	Be sure to tell them you need someone that has taught networking as well .	St
1.24.5	Bob	St
