i realize that to get really serious about games would require much money.
presently the only thing i'm thinking about is using 3d with google earth.
i also have &quot;ms flight simulator x&quot; and the &quot;ls99 golf&quot; game.
i just increased my ram from 1 to 4 gigs, but i haven't noticed much improvement in the performance of the computer.
i suspect that i'm not running anything that requires that much ram.
my fear is that i'll spend a lot of money on a card that may not be compatabile to my system, or may not be any better than what i now have.
thanks in advance for the help.
