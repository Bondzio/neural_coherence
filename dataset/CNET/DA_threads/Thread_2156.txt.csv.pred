1.1.1	I had 512 of pc2100 on my xp pro system running a athlon xp 2400 and abit n7f motherboard .	St
1.1.2	For about $ 30.00 more I got cosair 1 gig pc3200 for what it would hae cost for 1 512 of crucial pc2100 .	St
1.1.3	Now why does not my system show an improvement in preformance due to the faster memory and higher bus speed .	St
1.2.1	XP peaks with 512 mb memory .	St
1.2.2	Anything more is simply overkill , in my opinion .	St
1.2.3	The other issue is your bus speed .	St
1.2.4	If your motherboard will not run the pc3200 at the full 400mhz , then there is no advantage to having the faster memory .	St
1.2.5	While it may work just fine , it will only run as fast as the motherboard bus will allow .	St
1.3.1	you 'll see the speed increase as the NF7 sets the dividers up , your board can handle over 400MHZ on the bus the CPU however can not it 's down there at around 266 also , RAM does n't provide a huge increase in performance	St
