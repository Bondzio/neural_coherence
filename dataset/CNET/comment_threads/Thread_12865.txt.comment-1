Just the other day I had to restart my computer after a crash while watching a movie.
I had to use the power button, since ctrl-alt-del didn't work.
When the computer booted up again, strange noises came from the harddrive, almost sounded like some sort of sci-fi raygun.
I've never encountered that one before, so I was wondering if anyone had any advise for me on what to do?
Send it for repairs, hum along with the noise, or ignore it?
Or something?
