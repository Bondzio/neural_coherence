Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said the bodies of four men had been recovered.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company, installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
Chechen authorities found the remains of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village in the breakaway region in southern Russia.
The men were seized just two weeks after Chechen warlords released two British charity workers who had been held for 14 months.
Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its own affairs since Russian troops left two years ago.
Chechen government officials at the scene refused to comment.
