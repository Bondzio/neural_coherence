<s> I have an Intel Core2 Duo 3.00Ghz CPU and have been advised to upgrade to a better CPU as the one I have is going to be stopped from being made anymore. </s>
<s> Of course it all depends on what other Intel CPU will be compatible with my MoBo which is an ASUS P5KPL-CM. </s>
<s> I'm pleased with what I have and don't want to upgrade any other components if I can help it as I did a major upgrade about 18 months ago and the PC is perfectly adequate for my gaming needs. </s>
<s> Please advise! </s>
<s> The C2D at 3GHz should be near the top of its class so I would not bother with changing it. </s>
<s> I might look at the video card instead. </s>

<s> I have a GeForce NVidia 9800 GTX. </s>
<s> Graphics card, MoBo, CPU all upgraded at same time </s>
<s> You are the usual pinnacle of what a gamer's machine might look like. </s>
<s> Adding a few MHz to the CPU won't do much for a gamer here. </s>
<s> How ever simple things like moving from wifi to ethernet may be the easy way to get some gaming &quot;points.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the comments guys, I really valued your opinions. </s>
<s> The next CPU up from mine would undoubtedly be a Quad Core but there's still a premium to pay with the price despite them being old hat now. </s>
<s> There's one CPU Quad at 300. </s>
<s> Phew! </s>
<s> As Bob said it's not worth the extra few Mhz I might get. </s>
<s> Thx again, it's nice knowing guys like you will offer honest opinions, and I was just fishing around for a second opinion. </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
