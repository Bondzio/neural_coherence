1.1.1	Installed a new DVD burner to replace a worn-out CD burner , and I 'm tired of tossing CDs and DVDs in the trash after a failed burn .	St
1.1.2	Nero burned and read a test disk OK , so I 'm pretty sure the hardware is fine , but any attempt to burn anything else ( music , data , etc . )	St
1.1.3	gives me an error message and another wasted disk .	St
1.1.4	Nero Express 6.6.0.6 Aopen DUW 1608 12X DVD Burner ( replaced Mitsumi CR-485 FTE CD-R/RW ) Sony DVD-Rom DDU 1621 XP Pro 512 MB RAM 80 GB HD P4 2.6 Ghz HTT on PC Chips M906 MB with Intel 845 Chipset .	St
1.1.5	I made sure I have the latest version of Nero , and used Nero 's cleaning utility to completely uninstall/reinstall .	St
1.1.6	I updated the IDE controller drivers from Intel website ( as suggested on Nero 's help page - and by the way , Nero does n't seem to respond to service requests ) , and made sure there was n't a newer driver available from Aopen .	St
1.1.7	Yesterday I tried CDBurner XP Pro , and got the exact same results - another wasted disk .	St
1.1.8	Media : Maxell CD-R ( worked great with Mitsumi ) and Intenso DVD+R .	St
1.1.9	I think it may be the old driver for the Mitsumi , but I have no idea how to remove it .	St
1.1.10	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	Did n't your new burner come with it 's own software ?	Ques
1.2.2	When I got my burner , it came with a Nero disc that was , supposedly , only for that particular burner .	St
1.2.3	Do you know what burn engine is being used ?	Ques
1.2.4	Just a couple of ideas : 1 Check out TaskManager and see if InCD is running 2 If know what the old burn engine is called goto run in your start menu and type msconfig and edit your startup menu .	St
1.2.5	You might have a whole bunch of things running that are n't really needed .	St
1.2.6	3 Failing that get a startup Editor like GeekSuperhero , or TuneUp Utilities , or Spybot or anything you can find on the net to edit which burn engines start when you boot up your PC .	St
1.2.7	4 Try other CD/DVD burning programs .	St
1.2.8	Good Luck !	St
1.3.1	Is it possible you might have had other burning utilities , specially from other vendors like Roxio .	St
1.3.2	If so , you might also need their specific cleaning tools .	St
1.3.3	I had similar problems as you , then when I contacted my burner 's tech support , I found out Nero 's tools are n't enough .	St
1.4.1	Wal Mart .	St
1.4.2	Get the memorex 25 pack colorful 8x DVD blanks .	St
1.4.3	They are actually Ritek , I have burned over 150 and not one bad disc .	St
1.4.4	If you get a chance and are familiar with dos , check for firmware updates , not driver updates .	St
1.4.5	If not sure read up and prepare yourself so you can do a firmware update with no problems .	Sug
1.4.6	good link for info ... . http : //www.digitalfaq.com/authorburn/authoringfaq.htm	Polite
1.5.1	Install the burner as master on secondary Ide channel .	St
1.5.2	And do set jumper .	St
1.6.1	First , let me take back what I said about Nero - their tech support finally contacted me , and their comments were similar to what I 'm reading here .	St
1.6.2	Many thanks to those who replied here .	Polite
1.6.3	Jimbob : thanks , I 'm using the OEM Nero disc that came with the burner .	Polite
1.6.4	I did edit the start menu , but since Nero makes InCD I do n't believe that would conflict with Nero Express .	St
1.6.5	Nevertheless , I disabled it .	St
1.6.6	No change .	St
1.6.7	Yesterday I installed CDBurner XP Pro 3 and got the exact same result .	St
1.6.8	G : as I told Nero , their 's is the only software that has run on this machine ( until yesterday when I installed CDBurner XP Pro 3 ) .	St
1.6.9	Before installing Nero 6 I uninstalled Nero 5.5 .	St
1.6.10	After having trouble , I used Nero 's clean utility to wipe out all Nero files and do a clean install .	St
1.6.11	No luck .	Polite
1.6.12	OilTan : I 'm getting the same failure with CD or DVD , and the CDs I 'm using are from the same pack that I 've burned many from with the old Mitsumi burner , so I 'm pretty sure it 's not the media .	St
1.6.13	Nevertheless , if nothing else works I 'll order some new discs .	St
1.6.14	Also , I 'm not ready to tear into the machine just yet - I 'll try a few more things topside before I tear it apart again .	St
1.6.15	Thanks everyone - I 'll let you know if & when I get a good burn .	St
1.7.1	If you have recently upgraded to SP2 , there was an issue with some drivers .	St
1.7.2	Oak Technologies has a driver that will fix that problem , and it is a universal driver .	St
1.7.3	If that does n't help , I am clueless .	St
1.7.4	If you have NEVER had a successful burn with the new burner , , , take it back and get another one .	St
1.7.5	Once in great while , you get a bad one .	Polite
1.7.6	In the mean time , use a CDRW , and just reformat it if the burn goes bad .	St
1.8.1	leopold102 , Having the exact same problem have trashed at least 20 CD 's so far .	St
1.8.2	Have you had any luck fixing ... .	St
1.8.3	If I find a solution I will post here .	St
1.9.1	I have the same problem with this error , and when i stop using udma mode 2 ( UDMA33 ) , and start using Multi-word dma mode 2 , the problem was solved .	St
1.9.2	I hope that this will work for you too .	St
1.10.1	The & quot ; Buffer Too Large & quot ; and the & quot ; Communication Error & quot ; errors in Nero are likely caused by VIA IDE controllers having , get this ... TOO NEW a driver .	St
1.10.2	I went back to the original , version 5.1.2600.2180 and voila !	St
1.10.3	I can burn DVD 's again !	St
1.10.4	This really needs to be addressed .	St

1.10.7	WILL MICROSOFT EVER GET IT RIGHT ? ? ?	Ques

1.12.2	But , when I burn a +R disk , I get the & quot ; finished disk & quot ; , yet the lead out is just starting .	St
1.12.3	Using Nero express .	St
1.13.1	Nero and the Via drivers are ... not written by Microsoft .	St
1.13.2	Quite an odd question from my view .	St
1.13.3	Bob	St
1.14.1	Get this .	St
1.14.2	For some reason now I can not burn CD 's , but can burn DVD 's fine on the same drives .	St
1.14.3	I was using Nero 6.6 .	St
1.14.4	Upgraded to 7.0 , still does n't work .	St
1.14.5	I verified drivers and that DMA is turned on .	St
1.14.6	The Nero people told me the Intel IAA is causing the problem , but it 's only installed for the SATA drives .	St
1.14.7	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.14.8	Dave	St
1.15.1	Sorry , but Intel 's accelerators do such and are known to do such .	St
1.15.2	You received some great advice about that software , so try it .	St
