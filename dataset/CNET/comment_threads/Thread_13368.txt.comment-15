I am more than willing to go over the usual areas and help people set these up.
This is not tech support so I have no qualms or reservations as to PR or such here.
It's up to everyone to get along and work the issues.
It was never QOS and has never been in many years of my helping setup these things.
Again your choice on direction and keep in mind this is not tech support.
