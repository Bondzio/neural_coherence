please help i have installed a new motherboard in my destop, i purchased the same model(ms 6763 ver 1.0) but for some reason the driver for the ethernet controller hasnt installed.
the motherboard didnt come with a driver disk.
i would like to know how or where i can obtain said driver.
i have tried a number of sites online via a diffferent pc (as mine at present wont go online as i cannot connect it to hub) but these sites want to install driver/hardware identifier software and as it is a different computer i want to install said driver this solution is no good to me.
any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance
