Is it normal to have the adaptor part that you put in the power supply (cigerette lighter) get so hot that you can't touch it when you take it out? I checked the voltage in and voltage out of the adapter it is fine. If this is not supposed to be this hot what would you check?

Or your laptop is one of those Pentium 4 HT units that draw 100 Watts. At 12 Volt's that close to 10 Amperes and the connection will get hot. Bob
