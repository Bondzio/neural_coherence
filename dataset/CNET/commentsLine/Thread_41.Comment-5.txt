what makes yourpower supply an atx 12 v. the 4 pin is the 12 volt power plug that many mobos use to power the cpu now.
[older mobos used the 5 volts or 3.3 volt connector] it's a mobo issue not a cpu issue.
a given cpu can be fed from the 4 pin 12 volt on a newer mobo and work without such a connector on a mobo not set up for that connector.
had you plugged that in to the viseo card you would have fried video card for dinner.
yellow wires are normally 12 volts [of course black wires are grounds / returns].
i might guess that the greeen is for 3.3 volts, however 3.3 volts is normally orange.
the only green wire in the standard is the ps-on lead on pin 14 of the 20 pin connector or pin 16 of the 24 pin connector.
check with hp before plugging anything in.
