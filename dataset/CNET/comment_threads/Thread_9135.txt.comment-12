the thin wires connect the nubs on the card to the actual antennas.
Those are the little square patches in the drawing.
The antenna loops are stuck on the inside somewhere - maybe along the back edge, or maybe the wires lead up through the hinge to a place behind the LCD panel, dunno exactly on yours without taking apart one like it with known wires.
Since the wires, by definition, are intended to connect to a mini-PCI card and there is only one such slot on the motherboard, it would reasonable to expect that the loose ends of wires, if installed at the time of manufacture, would be resting somewhere near the slot.
If there are no thin wires with tiny little brass nubbins visible somewhere near there, I fear yours was built without them.
Sorry.
As Bob noted a few posts up, your only solution is a PC-Card.
It is too bad your purchase of the mini-PCI card was for naught.
