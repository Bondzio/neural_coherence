hi all, ok, so i have had rcn cable for a few years, and they charge me a $3 a month rental on the data modem.
they just told me they are upping the rental to $5.
So i looked up the modem on ebay-- toshiba pcx2500-- and i can get one for $15-20.
but rcn phone help says I need &quot;docsis 2.0&quot; or higher-- and all the ones for sale are docsis 1.1. any advice?
thanks - fj
