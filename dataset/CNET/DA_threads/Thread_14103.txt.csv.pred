1.1.1	I have a Compaq nc6000 laptop running XP2.	St
1.1.2	Devices (all of which don't work right with it regularly) - Adesso Keyboard/touchpad mouse combo, WKB 4000US.	St
1.1.3	- Kensington wireless mouse (Pilot Mouse Laser Wireless Pro, model M01006) (might conflict with Adesso since that has touchpad mouse, but even if I skip the Kensington or disable its mousepad in Device Manager, still Adesso has issues) - Palm Z22, synced via mini-USB cable - Skype converter to allow conversation on regular phone (Yealink B2K Skype RJ11-USB Phone Adapter) When I hook devices to the PC - even if just keyboard - devices aren't detected, don't install right, or if device does chance to work (after plug/unplug from different USB ports for 45 minutes at random), then the PC's sound goes out, so no music.	St
1.1.4	All devices work sometimes if I plug/unplug enough, but many seem to kill the PC's sound, and I can never get all devices to stay working.	St
1.1.5	I assume it's due to IRQ conflicts or some such, but all I know of IRQ is the name, basic concept, not how to see or control which IRQ the sound card or a USB device uses.	St
1.1.6	How to troubleshoot?	St
1.1.7	Many thanks!	St
1.2.1	Reinstall Or OS(operating System) as you didn't say what OS you where using on your PC and that could be a factor	St
1.3.1	but it could be an OS problem Anyway	St
