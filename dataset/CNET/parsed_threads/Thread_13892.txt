<s> I recently acquired the AIW 9800 Pro. </s>
<s> I've had luck in the past with ATI products, and this card works great for the most part. </s>
<s> The one difficulty I am having however is that my TV OUT is not working. </s>
<s> I cannot seem to open the Catalyst Control Center and am given a message that it failed to initialize properly. </s>
<s> I've installed both the copy of Catalyst that came with the card and the copy found online. </s>
<s> Both show the same problem. </s>
<s> I've called tech support to try and solve the issue... yeah right. </s>
<s> It is true what they say about AIT's tech support. </s>
<s> Of course, that seems to be the case with almost every tech support out there nowadays. </s>
<s> Anyway, anyone out there that has experienced similar issues? </s>
<s> Hopefully you have resolved this issue by now, but if not, here's what I do. </s>
<s> I see this message from time to time, usually after using Nero to capture DV camcorder input via firewire and not through the AIW card. </s>
<s> I just have to re-install the tv capture drivers (which I had to download after installing the software from the CD) and then the TV function works fine. </s>
<s> I've included the description and link from ATI's driver pages. </s>
<s> WDM Capture Driver version 6.14.10.6246 V3 is required for capture support on ALL-IN-WONDER and VIVO products. </s>
