Let's see: - Try to hook it up, no details about the cable(s) used - A linksys router, no type mentioned. - A wired verizon dsl modem, no type mentioned - There &quot;seems&quot; to be a compatibility issue, no details mentioned. - You tried both on your Windows 7 laptop and on your XP desktop, but you don't tell what you tried. - You don't even mention if you tried that wired or wireless or both.

If anyone can get a straight answer from Verizon, please let me know. It seems there was a transition a while back with Verizon and Frontier (the internet side) and their system is exteremely proprietary. Ciscokid16 is NOT the only one having issues trying to use his/her own hardware.

It is a combination unit wireless capable, modem/router in one unit, which would preclude the use of another router for general purposes. Whereas if you were to use your Linksys unit you would use a separate modem. The problem is DSL, your Linksys router is set up for use with a cable modem, which is a different ball game. That is I guess you could say, a &quot;GOTCHA&quot; with Verizon/Frontier DSL hook ups since they are fed by a phone link instead of cable. Is there a work around? Well that's the question for Verizon/Frontier, I would love to hear their answer to this one. It goes to firmware and of course hook up(s).
