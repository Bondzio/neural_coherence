i just measured the top of my repurposed wooden tv cart/printer stand, and it's about 15&quot;x26&quot; - a great fit for my current samsung ml-2510 laser printer, but not quite deep enough for a brother mfc-5890cn like the one that volvogirl &amp; her spouse own.
at least now i have a upper limit to look for with the dimensions of a replacement printer or multifunction machine!
