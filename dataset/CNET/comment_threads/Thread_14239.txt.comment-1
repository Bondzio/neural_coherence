I recently burned all of my OSX and OS9.2 split hard drives to CD's as a backup.
At the time I did not have an external hard drive.
(Was in transit.)
Now, after downloading the entire hard drive disks (after a clean-install) ALL folders are locked.
It has taken me well over two hours to unlock ALL folders, sub folders and sub-sub folders.
Wonder why this happened??
Any one else had this happen to them before?
Strange!?
