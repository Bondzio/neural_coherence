Can't seem to decide between the Dual Core Xeons (eg, 5150) or the Core 2 Duos (eg, E6700). Seems like the Xeon is built more for a server, and the C2D for a home machine/work machine/gaming machine to run graphics. I can say that we do run similar programs on dedicated servers. Not that I won't run a game here or there on the workstation.... I have seen a few internet threads on this, but still having a tough time deciding.

Perhaps one advantage of the Xeon is that I can always add another processor later on? I also understand that equal clock speed doesn't necessarily mean equal real-life speed. Benchnarks for almost identical Xeon and C2D processors show marked differences in programs such as Photoshop.
