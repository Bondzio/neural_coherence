Here I'm just copying files from a command line or sometimes explorer.
What's with that button?
Also, I wonder if the drive's housing has an issue.
Some overheat or have other issues.
Try a better case.
-&gt; In closing, FAT32 is going to mess up.
It doesn't have any fault tolerance but it's your only choice if you want a Mac to write to it.
Just remember it's a timebomb of a filesystem.
No fix is planned.
