i'm getting ready to build a system for myself.
here's the specs: asus am2 mobo nforce 570sli chipset evga geforce 7900gt (non-oc'd) kingwin 600w psu amd athlon 64 x2 4200+ (might overclock eventually) wd caviar 250gb hard drive here's my debate: i'm going to buy ddr2 667 or better ram.
right now, i'm looking at corsair ram, 2gb, latency 4, 4-4-4-12 timings.
however, for a little bit more, i could get mushkin extreme, 2gb, latency 3, 3-3-3-10 ram.
i know quite a bit about computers, but ram would have to be my most lacking area.
i know the mushkin ram has better timings and latency, but i've also heard a few bad things about mushkin, albeit not much.
i need opinions: who's better?
muskin or corsair?
i know a few of my fellow tech heads will help me out on this one.
thanks!
