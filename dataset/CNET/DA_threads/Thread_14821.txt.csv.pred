1.1.1	I never thought it could really happen, but my pc did explode this morning.	St
1.1.2	I was working on it as usual, then I smelled a burning smell, then a loud &quot;pop&quot;, then my machine shut down on its own.	St
1.1.3	I unplugged and opened it up to see what I could see, but honestly I didn't know what to look for.	St
1.1.4	I haven't cracked open the power supply yet, but I wouldn't know what to look for.	St
1.1.5	Please help with any suggestions!	St
1.1.6	I'm so desperate !	St
1.1.7	!	St
1.2.1	Snap, Crackle and Pop is good for breakfast cereal but bad for a power supply.	St
1.2.2	Don't even try to restart with the existing supply, replace it and hopefully the damage was limited to that.	St
1.2.3	You won't know until then.	St
1.3.1	The sounds you heard were probably a &quot;capacitor&quot; that blew.	St
1.3.2	The smell is related to it and probable near-by circuits.	St
1.3.3	Check for a leaky, bulging or simply extended cap, these look like little barrels.	St
1.3.4	It will be obivous once you ralize one or more are very different looking or hanging it guts out.	St
1.3.5	Inspect under good lighting.	St
1.3.6	As the other poster said, swap out the power supply, if you crack its cover as caps are all over the system.	St
1.3.7	Beware, if serious damage the mtrbd.	St
1.3.8	is best replaced, but a cap can be replaced but no guarntee it will fix the problem.	St
1.3.9	FYI - In the past 18-24mo.	St
