The graphics were buggy and the system kept crashing so i bought a graphics card off ebay - nvidia geforce fx5700. However it needed an agp expansion slot and when i opened up my computer it only had 2 pci slots. Can i insert a card into one of these and if so which one should i buy. Thanks.

Here's the cards that should work a little better: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143032 or http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814143110
