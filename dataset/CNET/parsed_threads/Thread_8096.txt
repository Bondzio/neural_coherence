<s> I've had the system for three years and haven't had trouble before. </s>
<s> I run Windows XP, if that helps. </s>
<s> Was working online tonight when suddenly the &quot;green&quot; light on the monitor (signifying it's in active mode) went to orange (stand-by) and the screen was blank. </s>
<s> The PC then began to make a warning sound, like a warning buzzer that was two short sounds each time. </s>
<s> This buzzer sound stopped after about ten seconds. </s>
<s> I looked in the back of the computer and there was a green light inside that was illuminated - not sure if that means anything. </s>
<s> On the front of the computer, the 3 and 4 numbers were lit up. </s>
<s> I turned it off, tried to turn it on again, same thing. </s>
<s> I waited ten minutes, tried again. </s>
<s> It booted up and worked for about five minutes before it kicked again. </s>
<s> When I push the menu screen on the monitor, I get the message: 2. </s>
<s> Digital input in power save mode. </s>
<s> Press any key on keyboard or move mouse. </s>
<s> I try both, nothing works. </s>
<s> I tried different outlets, different power strips and it's always the same result. </s>
<s> It's almost like it has overheated and goes into power save mode to not overheat. </s>
<s> But the green light on the monitor won't stay green - it always goes to orange. </s>
<s> Not sure how to proceed here. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> JB1323, This message, &quot;Digital input in power save mode. </s>
<s> Press any key on keyboard or move mouse&quot;, means the monitor is no longer recieving a signal from the video card. </s>
<s> Diagnostic lights 3 and 4 mean the memory modules are detected, but a memory failure has occurred. </s>
<s> * Power the PC off * Unplug the power cord from the rear of the PC * Lay the PC on its left side * Remove the cover http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/xps400/sm/cvrop.htm#wp1053342 * Remove and reseat all of the memory in their sockets http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/xps400/sm/parts.htm#wp1073631 * Reinsert the power cord * Turn the PC on If you still get Diagnostic lights 3 and 4, then either one or all of the memory is bad. </s>
<s> You can start the process of elimination by removing the memory from the black sockets, power on. </s>
<s> Then replace those and remove the memory from the white sockets, power on. </s>
<s> You get the idea. </s>
<s> Once you ascertain what memory is bad, you can then replace it. </s>

<s> Thanks, Chris. </s>
<s> I spoke to some other people who said that it could be a problem with the internal fan - perhaps dust was collecting on the fan and its performance has been compromised. </s>
<s> The CPU, they theorized, was getting too hot as a result, so the computer shut down like that to keep from overheating. </s>
<s> The suggestion I got was to look at the fan and make sure it was clean and if needed, to replace it. </s>
<s> Two questions for you: 1) What do you think of that theory? </s>
<s> 2) Why does the computer make that buzzing noise when the screen goes blank? </s>
<s> It sounds like a warning buzzer that stops after ten seconds or so? </s>
<s> What you outlined, if that's what needs to be done, is this something I can do on my own, or should I contact someone to do it for me? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> The diagnostic lights were for the memory: http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/xps400/sm/adtshoot.htm#wp1054184 Warning sound? </s>
<s> Does it match any of these: http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/xps400/sm/adtshoot.htm#wp1054449 After 3 years, it would be a good idea to open the case and use compressed air to blow out the dust. </s>
<s> I would do this in the garage. </s>
<s> You will be surprised at how much will come out. </s>
<s> While it is open I would reseat all memory, cables, cords and connectors. </s>
<s> Just use those instructions in the link below to open the case and reseat stuff. </s>

<s> Hmmm...not sure about the beeping pattern. </s>
<s> But I'll open it up, reseat the memory and see how it goes. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it. </s>
<s> One more question - if I figure out what memory cards are faulty - what's the best place to get them replaced? </s>
<s> Do I have to deal with Dell directly or can I go to Best Buy, for example, and get? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> If your under warranty, we will replace them. </s>
<s> If not, you can go to Best Buy or get it here: http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=XPS%20400 </s>
<s> Thanks, Chris. </s>
<s> I don't think it's under warranty, since it's 3+ years old. </s>
<s> Based on the configurations you sent, does each memory piece act as its own unit, or do two make up one? </s>
<s> In other words, if I figure out that one is bad, does that mean its complimentary piece has to be replaced as well? </s>
<s> The diagram you sent has the memory divided up into DMM1 and DMM2, with white and black clips. </s>
<s> If one of the DMM1s, for example, is bad, do both have to be replaced? </s>
<s> Also, if they act independently, can I operate my computer with just three memory cards or do I need all four? </s>
<s> If the 3 memory sticks are the same speed, yes, could run them in a single-channel mode. </s>
<s> I would just isolate the bad one and then try to boot with the others. </s>
<s> DELL-Chris M </s>
<s> Chris: I reseated the memory and it seems to have done the trick. </s>
<s> However, when I opened the computer, I discovered I only have two sticks of memory, each of which is located in the white tabs. </s>
<s> I thought, based on the links you sent me, that the memory would be in the black tabs, if anywhere. </s>
<s> I haven't added memory to it before, so I guess two sticks is the default for the XPS? </s>
<s> My question is, if I buy two more memory sticks and seat them in the black tabs, will it make much of a difference in the computer's performance? </s>
<s> I don't have a lot on it, aside from music files, and it seems to be working well now. </s>
<s> But if additional memory will make it faster, I'm all for it. </s>
<s> What do you think? </s>
<s> Thanks again for the reseating suggestion - it saved me some money. </s>
<s> I appreciate it. </s>
<s> How much Ram is in there now (512mb, 1GB, etc)? </s>
<s> Don't know. </s>
<s> Not at home PC now. </s>
<s> How do I check? </s>
<s> How much RAM is recommended? </s>
<s> When I reseated, the memory stick didn't simply go down and click in. </s>
<s> I had to click one side, then push down on the other side and click it in. </s>
<s> Based on the instructions, I thought it would just click in. </s>
<s> I made sure the notch was lined up, but it still wouldn't click in just by applying equal pressure to each side. </s>
<s> Unusual or common? </s>
<s> You just have to apply equal pressure with both thumbs. </s>
<s> Kind of tricky. </s>
<s> Turn it on and go into the bios. </s>
<s> It will tell you how much memory is installed. </s>
<s> For XP, I would go with 2GBs. </s>
<s> I don't know much about computers - how do I access the bios? </s>
<s> press F2 at the startup screen (the black one, not the windows screen) </s>
<s> Can I also look at &quot;properties&quot; under My Computer? </s>
<s> mabey it is a warning if it feels like its running hot cause mine dose as well make sure ur cooling fans are clear of dust n debree becareful though there a little difficult to get to </s>
