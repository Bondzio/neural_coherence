I'm assuming you're referring to glossy vs. matte displays?
Most netbooks and consumer laptops have glossy displays, which are next to impossible to view outdoors.
There are a few netbooks that do have matte displays, however.
Namely the Samsung NC10 and the HP Mini 110.
I haven't used either of them outdoors, though.
