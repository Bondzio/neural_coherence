Please do tell us more about your system, and exactly what other observations that you can make when you turn your system on; any beeps, do the fans run, are any LED's on the front panel lighted. Did you have any power outages/surges recently?? Also, the obvious things requested in red when you make a new discussion, what operating system etc, etc. Yes, with no video, knowing what operating system you are using will not, at this moment, help much. However we are optimists and hope to rapidly progress. LOL
