hello, about 2 weeks ago my usb ports stopped functioning.
it says the drivers are not installed.
it won't roll them back either, it is if there never were any.
i replaced my motherboard due to another issue, the drivers still will not load.
i tried to load them from the motherboard cd, the windows cd and a download.
when i try to load it says &quot;access denied&quot;.
i need to have this fixed as i need to print some photos for my work asap.
if i can't get it going today i am going to wipe and reload my hard drive tonight.
please help if any of you have advice.
david
