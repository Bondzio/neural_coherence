For now yes the 57 dominatesm but the 4800+ can help you alot more with running multiple applications.
Companies are going to take advantage of dual core processors.
Also as said in a previous post, in lines of processors are coming out, which most liely means price break for you.
So I suggest you wait.
Although the 57 will get you more fps, the 4800 still has far more useful value.
