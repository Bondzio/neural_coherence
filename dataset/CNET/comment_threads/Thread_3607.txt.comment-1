Ive just bought a new PC with Windows XP installed on it, but I have another hardrive from my old computer also with Windows XP on it, is there anyway I can get my old files to the new computer and then use the old hardrive as a secondary drive?
Could I install the old hardrive as a secondary drive and boot up the edition of Windows XP on there and just copy the files over??
Any help would be great.
Cheers
