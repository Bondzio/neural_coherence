It had no operating system due to a hard drive replacement, so I installed a legal copy of Windows 98 SE. I've done all the upgrades thru MS and the unit works fine, except that it won't play a DVD. I know the unit works because it plays CD's and writes to CD's just fine. It appears the drive is a Toshiba. Help.

The first one with the DIVX Codecs (which are also free) comes with a player that you can install and it's probably one of the best I've seen to be honest. www.pcwarfare.com/cd-cdrw-dvd/free.video.players.htm You have to copy and paste the above into the addressbar because the CNET filters wipes out the URL if I put the http:// in front of it to make it clickable.

Or rather will not play most DVDs you rent or buy. If you need to test a DVD installation and have no Windows DVD player, look up GEEXBOX since it's not windows and is some 7 megabytes or less. Bob

Proffitt	7/22/05 4:31 PM	1.12204986E12	98/ME has a player, but no &quot;decoder&quot;.	&quot;How to install the DVD player (for Windows 98) Windows 98 has an internal DVD player, but it isn't installed during Windows setup. You must extract &quot;manually&quot; DVD player files from cab sources. Those files are dvdplay.chm, dvdplay.cnt, dvdplay.hlp, dvdplay.exe and dvdrgn.exe. Put them into a folder of your choice, and them move dvdrgn.exe into Windows folder. Run dvdplay.exe to start the player. &quot; - Noted widely on the web. But this player is incapable of playing 99% of commercial DVDs. I've found this tip to be useful for playback in a pinch for homemade DVDs. Bob
