1.1.1	I have had this for a couple of years now without problems.	St
1.1.2	All of a sudden the scanning and copying options are a major headache.	St
1.1.3	every time I try to copy or scan a page, the image/copy comes out with an approx 3 inch wide black bar that runs the length of the page.	St
1.1.4	Printing isn't a problem, therefore I am assuming that it's something to do with the actual scanning hardware.	St
1.1.5	Any help or advice will be gratefully appreciated.	Ques
1.1.6	ps.	St
1.1.7	If there's a way I can attach an example, please let me know.	St
