1.1.1	I'm running Win XP with SP 1.	St
1.1.2	A couple weeks ago, my DVD-ROM and CD-RW drives stopped working.	St
1.1.3	They weren't visible in &quot;My Computer,&quot; and the CD-RW drive wouldn't even open when I pressed the eject button, so I restarted.	St
1.1.4	They were not found by the BIOS at boot-up.	St
1.1.5	I figured it was a bad IDE cable, so I pilfered one from another computer and installed it.	St
1.1.6	Presto, they worked again.	St
1.1.7	Today, the same thing has happened.	St
1.1.8	I don't think the chances of having two IDE cables go bad in the span of a couple weeks is very likely.	St
1.1.9	The DVD drive is set to be the master on IDE channel 2, and the CD-RW as the slave on the same channel.	St
1.1.10	The DVD drive will open if I push the eject button, so it doesn't seem like an issue with my power supply.	St
1.1.11	The DVD drive is an 8x drive from Creative, the CD-RW is a CD-Writer Plus 9100 from HP.	St
1.1.12	Neither has any firmware updates on their respective websites.	St
1.1.13	Anyone have any ideas?	St
1.2.1	Test each unit ALONE and ONE AT A TIME.	St
1.2.2	Does it work then?	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Testing them seperately, they both worked fine.	St
1.3.2	So, I returned to the original configuration (DVD as master, CD-RW as slave on channel 2), and they even worked while they were together again.	St
1.3.3	So far, the problem seems to be solved by opening the case, removing the IDE cable, and reconnecting it.	St
1.3.4	Could it be a problem with one of the pins on the DVD drive?	St
1.3.5	I don't really want to have to open my case every week just so my drives will work.	St
1.3.6	Any suggestions for a next step?	St
1.3.7	Thank you.	St
1.4.1	If this was my machine I'd watch for signs that a drive was on the verge of failure.	St
1.4.2	The BIOS boot screen could read &)(*()(DVD)*)(*( instead of LD DVDROM MASTER.	St
1.4.3	These clues lead us to what to do next.	St
1.4.4	Also, I know to see if the FIRMWARE is current and I also will fit 80 conductor cables, set the jumpers to CS since that's my most trouble free setups.	St
1.4.5	Sadly, the drive or part with the issue didn't reveal itself (yet).	St
1.4.6	bob	St
1.5.1	Thank you.	St
1.5.2	I'll try CS and keep an eye on things for now.	St
1.5.3	I appreciate your help.	Polite
