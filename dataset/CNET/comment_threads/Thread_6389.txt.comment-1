Hello All I was wondering if anyone has used one of these drives.
I have only seen 1 review for it so far.
I need some USB drives to backup important Word, Excel files and to backup the programs I download from the Internet for my Palm.
I am backing up programs, but I will not be running the programs from the USB drive.
Storage is all that I'm looking for.
I ask about this particular drive 'cause it's on sale at a good price.
Thanks for any help/advise Regards Fritzmom
