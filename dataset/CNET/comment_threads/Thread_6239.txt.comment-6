Are you SURE this ever read less than 2 volts?
Perhaps it has been that way from day 1.
Before I chased this around I'd break out the DVM and see what it really is.
Maybe the sensor fibs.
If the DVM shows 2+ volts and AMD says 1.3 volts I'd call Dell and ask&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How Come?
As mentioned.....you can not use non-Dell software to tell Dell they have a problem......it does not work....they go deaf.
