The usual is that the settings are incorrect. Since there was no make/model supplied, then you just need to read the manual on what to set for this CPU. An out of date BIOS will mis-report the CPU so if you have such an issue, fix it. Bob

Go to AMD.COM and look up your processor, it will tell you the actual speed of the processor. Also Windows XP will correct the error in reporting in the processor speed and actually report the corect speed of the cpu.

My Xp 2600 + runs at 2.133gig with a front side bus of 266 Megahertz Check here for and update to your motherboard bios:(ftp.asus.com.tw) or (ftp.asus.com) or (ftp.asuscom.de)

The multiplier for the XP's are FIXED [can't be changed without surgery]. Thus you can only acheive 2.083 GHz when the FSB is set properly. Many mobos have circuitry that drops the FSB back to a safe speed if you have a bad shutdown or it detects a problem. The mobo mfrs/BIOS varies on whether you set the FSB to the single speed or the double speed. Example 133 MHz or 266 MHz [an aspect of double data rate memory] the memory is clocked at 133 but it is read on both the leading and falling edge and thus reads at double the rate [266]. Same for 166 and 333. As already stated the AMD XP 2800 + actual clock speed is 2.083 GHz. If it supports 166/333 MHZ memory the multiplier would be probably be listed as 12.5.
