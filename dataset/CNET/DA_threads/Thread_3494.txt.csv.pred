1.1.1	The suggestion to get a real XP SP3 cd did the trick , mostly .	St
1.1.2	I was able to install XP using the BIOS IDE mode , no SATA driver was required .	St
1.1.3	My only outstanding issue is the sound driver .	St
1.1.4	When I have sound working , I have two sound devices : The AMD HMDI sound device , and the Realtek sound device .	St
1.1.5	The Realtek sound device handles the internal speaker .	St
1.1.6	The problem is that when I reboot , the Realtek device disappears , leaving only the AMD HDMI audio device .	St
1.1.7	There are two & quot ; Microsoft UAA & quot ; devices shown in the control panel .	St
1.1.8	The first seems to be associated with the AMD audio device , and the second seems to be associated with the Realtek device .	St
1.1.9	I have to delete the second UAA device and then & quot ; scan for hardware changes & quot ; to activate the Realtek audio .	St
1.1.10	This works until I reboot , then the Realtek device goes away .	St
1.1.11	I have tried the following things : 1 ) Set the Realtek device as the default sound card .	St
1.1.12	On reset it is missing again .	St
1.1.13	2 ) Disable the AMD device .	St
1.1.14	On reset it is enabled again .	St
1.1.15	3 ) Disable the first UAA device .	St
1.1.16	This results in no sound devices being detected at all .	St
1.1.17	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.18	Thanks all .	St
1.1.19	Les	St
1.2.1	That 's proper for HD Audio and I will stop there since the reset of why is on the internet .	St
1.2.2	As to disabling that , no .	St
1.2.3	Do n't do that .	St
1.2.4	Read this link and if your driver install order was wrong , sound can go missing .	St
1.2.5	There is no known quick fix .	St
1.2.6	I start over .	St
1.2.7	Maybe the web has better ideas .	St
1.2.8	And I make a big assumption you got the drivers from the laptop maker too .	St
1.2.9	- & gt ; http : //forums.cnet.com/7726-7587_102-2699006.html notes the audio driver anomaly .	St
1.2.10	Order matters .	St
1.2.11	Bob	St
1.3.1	That points me down the correct path .	Sug
1.3.2	I found the following links : http : //support.microsoft.com/kb/115486 http : //www.wilderssecurity.com/archive/index.php/t-192426.html I suspect you are correct that installed the drivers in the wrong order .	St
1.3.3	It looks like there are registry entries I can add / modify to control the order in which the drivers get loaded .	St
1.3.4	Thanks for the pointer .	St
1.3.5	Les	St
1.4.1	It is kinda troublesome ... . That I have to update driver every time when I reboot the computer ... Plz ... .let me know if you successfully solve the problem..	St
1.4.2	If you did ... could you plz share your solution ... . ?	Ques
1.4.3	Thank you .	St
1.5.1	My bet is you got the install order wrong .	St
1.5.2	It 's a real common and annoying issue .	St
1.5.3	My question is simply this .	St
1.5.4	Given how much arcane knowledge you need to install XP , is it game over for XP ?	Ques
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	No I did n't .	St
1.6.2	I bought an external USB speaker .	St
