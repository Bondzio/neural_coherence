hey whats up guys i got alittle problem here that is really pissing me off.
Today i got a copy of quake 4 for my pc and the crap keeps crashing everytime i try and load a new level.
When this happens one of the those windows crash things comes up asking if i want to send it to microsoft or not.
I have already downloaded the new patches for the game and everything and everything on my comp is patched to lasted so i just dont know what it could be but if anyone does can you help me out plz?
Thanks, Nick
