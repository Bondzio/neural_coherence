How much disc space does a 2hr, 4hr, or 6hr. video take up? I'll probably be using the highest resolution(?) when I burn for clarity. Any info is ALWAYS appreciated!! Thanks

I suggest an external device with USB2 (nothing less will do). What about software? What do you already have? Be aware, video work is very time consuming. While you are doing video, you can't use the computer for anything else.
