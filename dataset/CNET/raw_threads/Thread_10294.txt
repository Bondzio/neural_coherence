There are 4 memory slots two of which are in use now. My question is should Ileave them in and install 2 more at 512m or should I remove them and install two at 1g each.Fish Dell Dimension 8400 Intel Pentium(R)4CPU 3.20GHz 1.00GB of Ram 160 GB Hardrive 16x dvd-rom & 16x dvd+/- RW 3.5in floppy

Not being very versed in the pc tech I need to ask if there are any system changes (required)due to the added memory.I think not.Fish
