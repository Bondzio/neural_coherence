thanks so much for your info; i've covered the internet trying to get/find an answer to this question for days now with no response.
currently, my 17&quot; is set @ 1024 x 768; and the max i can go is 1280x960, so i guess pushing it to a 20&quot; might be too much?
also, as you pointed out, pushing to max will be poor quality and slow frames; doesn't sound good to me.
i think i'll consider getting a new system instead.
thank you again for your answer as it was very helpful to me.
