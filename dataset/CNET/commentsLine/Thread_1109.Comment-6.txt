i took the cover off my computer and was just checking it out before i shut it down for dusting.
(it definitely needed to be dusted.)
i heard a bit of a winding/squeaking sound coming from one of the fans on the back, i believe this is the case fan.
i have another fan next to it but that has a duct that leads to the top the large heat sink.
i moved the case around to get a better look and then the high pitched/winding sound started.
i tapped on the fan and it stopped.
looks like i need a new fan.
should i replace the other one too?
also, any suggestions on a brand of fan i should buy?
i would like to get the best one for preformance and durability.
gary.
