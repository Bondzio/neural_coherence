When the P4 home built unit failed and the printer and scanner on the parellel port were not up to par for any other PCs, I dug up an old wired router that supported a parellel port and added it to the WAN port on the WIFI router with a CAT5e cable.
The other wired ports helped fill an overflow on the WIFI wired ports, like the DTV sat box and a server behind a firewall.
A $20.
investment originally.
but sidelined for the WIFI.
Now reclaimed for duty.
