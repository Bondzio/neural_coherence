i got an ultra power supply.
oh well, i guess i'll try selling it or something.
i was wondering about the power supply because i've heard a lot of bad things about modular power supplies (especially ones from ultra).
hmm, i'm thinking about getting an enermax power supply.
got any other recommended brands?
