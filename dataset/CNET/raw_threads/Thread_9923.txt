I have an EDIMAX BR-6228nC 150 Mbps broadband router to which my desktop is wired and the laptop connects through WiFi. The speeds never go above 2.5MBps, so there should be plenty of bandwidth left for Internet use. My router config confirms that there's no Internet connection while transferring the files. Can anyone please help me with this? Thanks

I tried every possible solution before giving up and buying a different make/model router. I haven't had a problem since then. Does the router have the latest firmware installed? Have you tried a factory reset? Do you have the same problem when both computers are wired to the router?

Since I don't have the full picture of router and more settings I suggest you try router and such defaults FIRST along with a channel check. What's that?
