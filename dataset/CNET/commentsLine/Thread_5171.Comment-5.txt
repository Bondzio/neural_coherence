thanks again.
now i'll go off and &quot;ponder&quot; some more.
i know its time to get a new pc but: 1) i don't relish the thought of the time required to &quot;learn&quot; win xp-pro.
2) i will have to buy an upgrade to my office suite, and probably spend some time learning it's anomalies (they all have them).
i am hooked on wordperfect office suite - hate the thought of going to microsoft.
3} i'll have to re-enable my home network.
this pc is now the hub.
it was a pain to set it up once!
4} i'll have to buy an upgrade for drive image (and maybe for partition magic).
all of the above takes much time.
but considering all the time i have spent on the current pc issues, maybe i should have made the jump sooner!
thanks again.
