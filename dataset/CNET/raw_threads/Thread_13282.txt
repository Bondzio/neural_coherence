Sometimes when the games are running for long , or while using DVD, PC just restarts. Computer works with single hard drive ,I tried using 2 Hard drives, but computer didn't start, or sometimes starts and gives delayed write failed error. My current specs Processor : Core 2 duo E4400 RAM : 3 GB ddr2 Motherboard : gigabyte s series : 945 Hard disk (2) : 1000 GB Sata 160 GB Sata (currently disconnected) GPU : Nvidia 8800 GT (512 Mb) DVD :- 1 Read/Write LAN Card. : 1 PSU : 400 W. OS - Windows 7. Everything was fine when I had a a single 160 Gb Hard disk & 1GB Ram with windows XP. I checked a few psu calculator sites but i don't quite get the idea. What problem could it be? Thanks for you valuable suggestions and help.
