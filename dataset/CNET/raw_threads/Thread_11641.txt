I need to extract or transfer my files from my old Hard Drive Maxtor (80Gb)originaly installed in my DELL Dimension 8200 running windows XP (no longer working) to my new pc (running windows vista 32 bit). My new pc recognizes the old hard drive wich was installed in an external HD enclosure to be accessed via USB 2.0. Now, I can access the files but when I try to open, tranfer or copy any of them I got a message: You have no permission to acces this file.
