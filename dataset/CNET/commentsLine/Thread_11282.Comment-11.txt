some computer manufacturers go out of their way to make acess into the machine easy.
others do not.
three years ago i decided to add ram to my hp pavillon.
had a friend over , who built his own systems.
he had told me it would be easy, not a problem.
he would just stand around for back up.
almost an hour of trying to get the cover off aand gain access inside the machine and move the front forward.
some of it spent with both of us tugging in opposite directions.
both of us drenched in sweat.
hp website gave two completely different directions for the same task on the same model from different locations on their site.
his opinion was never to buy an hp.
that said it was slightly easier to open it the next time.
but only slightly.
and again a bit more the next time.
now it is a only woman task.
as for the hard drive.
it required moving part of the front of the machine forward.
and again required some physical strength.
some of the clips needing to be released were well hidden and had to be in release mode all at the same time.
since there were more than two,we need four hands it meant a little fidgeting and repeated releasing.
that said ,opening the dell was a breeze the first time around and other than having to make sure i got the slave and master set up and the ribbon in the right direction and on the right pins, was only slightly tricky in reaching in to add a dvd write drive.
you might want to consider asking your question with your make and model stated so that someone who has worked on that one , can answer.
wish you luck.
