get what your mobo support.
some memory can be touchy.
you can buy 433mhz ddr2 in 1gb sticks.
good choice to max it out.
your video card choice is also a good upgrade, especially at 256. some will argue for ati.
consider a good replacement p/s if the dell shows any age/wear but their supplies are better than the watts shown.
but a really good supply is a positive upgrade to consider.
past that a new mobo and a core duo would be next and what you buy now will be usable.
