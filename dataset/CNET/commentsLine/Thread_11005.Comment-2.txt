with all those wireless phones around, not to mention any microwave ovens, it's likely interference would be an issue.
my opinion would be to hardwire where you can(best solution), use a combo wifi/multiported switch/router(such as  ), then wap any dead spots with(something like this  ).
operating systems are not likely an issue.
