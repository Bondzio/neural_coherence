That means you likely have a P3.
To upgrade to a P4, you need a motherboard or hold the P4, new power supply since it's quite hungry and the RAM changes too.
With all the heat, a new case is fitted.
If you were to stick with the P3, it's unlikely any real gain of moving to the 1.2GHz would be worth it even if your old machine could support it.
