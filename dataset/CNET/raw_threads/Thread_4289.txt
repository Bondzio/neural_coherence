3023	0	595929	5471373	NR	nmagner	6/26/13 8:09 AM	1.37223414E12	Network Configuration Query	I've set up the following DC's on virtual machines: On DC1 you set the IPv4 settings are: IP: BLANK Gateway: BLANK Primary DNS: 127.0.0.1 Secondary DNS: 192.168.0.1 (Broadband Router) What IPv4 settings settings do I enter on DC2 so as it points at DC1? IP: Gateway: Primary DNS: Secondary DNS: Any help would be greatly appreciated?

That seems odd unless the host is also running some DNS (server) It's also odd to have a router do the DNS work. Didn't you discover that had other issues. I won't list them all but here's an old favorite. -&gt; http://www.michaelhanscbsi.com/eclecticism/2003/11/07/belkin-routers-hijacking-websurfing/ The industry seems to have fixed that but other issues we bumped into had me use the real DNS instead of the routers.

BTW, I hope you avoid using acronyms since my guess might be wrong as I look over http://www.acronymfinder.com/DC.html Running a domain controller in a VM is interesting but there is no one correct answer as what we are trying to do can change the answer.

Since it would not be to fielded as a DC then you can use the host's IP assignments. That is, I installed W2008 in Virtual Box and never changed from what the host DHCP'd. Bob
