1.1.1	I 'm advising someone on how to build a nice gaming PC for under $ 1000 , and we seem to have found a pretty nice match .	St
1.1.2	I was just wondering if everything will be compatible and work fine .	St
1.1.3	Here 's the list : Case : ENERMAX Blue Aluminum ATX Mid Tower Case With 400W PSU , Model & quot ; 10MCS-56881LBFS-D3 & quot ; -RETAIL Motherboard : Intel & quot ; BOXD915PCYL & quot ; 915P Chipset Motherboard For Intel LGA 775 CPU -RETAIL Processor : Intel LGA 775 Pentium 4 520 2.8 GHz , 800MHz FSB , 1MB L2 Cache , Hyper Threading Technology - Retail Memory : Crucial 240-pin DIMM 512 DDR2 from crucial.com Video Card : ATI RADEON 9800 PRO Video Card , 256MB DDR , 256-bit , DVI/TV-Out , 8X AGP -RETAIL Floppy Drive : NEC 1.44MB Black Internal Floppy Drive , OEM CD-ROM Drive : Samsung Black 52X32X52 CD-RW Drive , Model SW-252SENB , OEM Bulk Hard Drive : Western Digital 120GB 7200RPM SATA Hard Drive , Model WD1200JD , OEM Drive Only Thank you .	St
1.2.1	Also , he does n't need a monitor , keyboard , or mouse .	St
1.3.1	Btw , I noticed the Radeon 9800 Pro video card would n't work , since the motherboard does n't have an AGP slot .	St
1.3.2	I 've changed it to : ATI Radeon X700 PRO Video Card , 256MB DDR , 128-Bit , DVI/TV-Out , PCI-Express , Model & quot ; 100-437402 & quot ; -RETAIL	St
1.4.1	Especially for gaming , an Athlon 64 3000+ would be a much better choice than a P4 520 .	St
1.4.2	In Doom 3 for example , an Athlon 64 3000+ ( $ 133 for the socket 754 , or $ 150 for the socket 939 ) beats a $ 780 Pentium 4 3.2 ghz EE .	St
1.4.3	http : //www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx ? i=2149 & p=7 It is also a great performer for other games and general use .	St
1.4.4	http : //www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx ? i=2065 & p=8 The socket 754 Athlon 64 3000+ is cheaper than the 939 version , and the 754 motherboard is also cheaper , but the 939 motherboard will give more room for future upgrades , and a 90nm socket 939 will probably use less power and run cooler than a 130 nm socket 754 one .	St
1.4.5	It does n't make sense to even consider a 2.8 ghz ( 520 ) Pentium 4 at $ 162 , when for less you can get an Athlon 64 3000+ which beats a Pentium 4 3 ghz ( or even a much faster P4 ) in most games .	St
1.4.6	http : //techny.com/articles.cfm ? getarticle=606 & go=0.53769656	Ques
1.5.1	everything will work together in that list , except the video card , its a good video card , but that motherboard does n't have an agp slot .	St
1.5.2	you 'll need to find a video card that 's pci 16x	St
1.6.1	Good luck finding a PCI E grfx card for cheap ...	Polite
1.6.2	Your better off changing mobos arent you ?	Ques
