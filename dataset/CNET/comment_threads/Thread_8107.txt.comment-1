I've been shopping around for a gaming machine for a few weeks now and I've almost settled on Digital Storm to build my first true gaming rig however the more I look at the benefits of building my own PC the more tempting it becomes.
There's a few things holding me back, among them are how to troubleshoot?
How to avoid compatability issues.
Fear factor (BIOS scares me a little).
No tech support.
Did I spend my money in the right places?
I have a budget of $2000-$2500 for this so I know the savings of building my own will be very significant however that warm fuzzy feeling of warranties and tech support will be gone.
I do like that I'll be getting educated as I go but fear the pain and frustration that education may cause (not to mention money) so I guess after all my rambling my question is...Will that education, pain and suffering (assuming Murphy's law is in full effect) end up as a rewarding and satisfactory experience or should I play it safe?
