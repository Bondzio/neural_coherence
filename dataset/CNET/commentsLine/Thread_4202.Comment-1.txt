hi folks, i was doing a simple upgrade from win98 to win2k on a friends pc when the cd drive sparked and died.
he told me after that it had not been working properly for a while.....i wish he'd told me that before, i've got a load of spare cd drives in the shed!
after much diagnosing it remains to say that the only surviving components were the floppy drive, case, psu and memory.
i have replaced the mobo with an identical one and used a spare cpu, hard drive and graphics card all of which i know are working to make up the pc.
the problem is that once the pc has been shut down, it won't start again both by shutting down from windows or by using the soft power case switch (only before windows has started).
i have swapped the psu and cables in case they too were damaged but nothing makes a difference.
it refuses to start again for at least 4 hours of it being unplugged from the wall.
only getting the chance to work on it in the evenings, this is the soonest i get to trying it again and it always starts after that 24hr break.
has anyone got any ideas?
am i missing something glaringly obvious?
any help on this would be very much appreciated.
mobo: jetway 994an (new) psu: 300w (replacement) video: 8mb s3 card (replacement) cpu: pii 366mhz mem: 64k thanks for looking, minskin
