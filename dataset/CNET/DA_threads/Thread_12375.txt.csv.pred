1.1.1	I have a TubeMagic DAC that connects to my computer via USB .	St
1.1.2	I first noticed a popping sound coming from the DAC hardware box when the silent loading screens initiated in SpecOps : The Line .	St
1.1.3	I later noticed popping in the speakers during movie playback and during the first few notes of any song in Winamp .	St
1.1.4	Progression and location of events ; works box is popping while plugged into real USB port & gt ; plug into externally AC powered USB hob and works fine .	St
1.1.5	starts popping a month later .	St
1.1.6	& gt ; plug into front usb ports and second hub , notice sound is louder and no pops .	St
1.1.7	Anyone have any clue as to the likely cause ?	Ques
1.1.8	Static in the motherboard ?	Ques
1.1.9	Underpowered/overpowered USB ports ?	Ques
1.1.10	Drivers ?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Yes , other peripheral devices , including a Xmod USB sound card work fine .	St
1.3.2	I 've heard numerous people make similar complaints about static and popping with the TubeMagic but nobody seems to have found the culprit .	St
1.3.3	I think I 've localized the problem to motherboard static , USB power surges or voltage under supply , and/or drivers .	St
1.3.4	I 'd sincerely appreciate any guesses as how plausible any of these possible causes are for static and popping through the speakers alongside a & quot ; popping & quot ; from the DAC .	St
1.3.5	Two types of & quot ; pops & quot ; sound from the actual hardware .	St
1.3.6	One sounds like a jittering buzz I associate with static .	St
1.3.7	The other is a & quot ; clicking & quot ; sound identical to that made by a XonarSTX on start up or when switching modes .	St
1.3.8	I 'm not worried about this second type , as I understand that is the sound of transistors powering up .	St
1.4.1	But are having a hard time accepting that the product has a defect .	St
1.4.2	Since it is defective , return it and do n't use it again .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	It 's not defective under all circumstances .	St
1.5.2	It 's only problematic depending on what USB port it is plugged into .	St
1.6.1	And does not work in all ports .	St
1.6.2	All this means is that there is no reason to keep it unless you can live with a crappy thing .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thanks for your help , Bob .	Polite
1.7.2	I 'm confident you 're right that it 's a hardware malfunction but I 'm trending toward thinking the problem is due to a design defect .	St
1.7.3	One more question , are you familiar enough with hardware to make a suggestion on what might cause the hardware to emit a static buzz at times ?	Ques
1.7.4	I 'm more interested in finding a cause than a solution ( solution being : as you suggest , returning a poorly designed device ) .	St
1.8.1	It 's a long list of things from a driver issue to power available on the USB port .	St
1.8.2	I get those USB DAC things for 2 to 3 bucks to my mailbox to sub in for failed onboard audio .	St
1.8.3	So when I get a bum one I give it to a buddy that seems to want to try to fix everything .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	Now you know why some devices cost more than others for the same function .	St
1.9.2	Audio bounds , but solutions are sometimes build-in to better handle them .	St
1.9.3	Seeing some DAC devices handling low voltages , etc .	St
1.9.4	and then the make-up of the components , you wonder if it can handle as they are easily over-whelmed it seems to me at times .	St
1.9.5	Just the plain fact , you get a pop is not unheard of as being-ON just got an unwanted audio response .	St
1.9.6	Just cranking up the audio may cause a & quot ; hum & quot ; from speakers in just about any audio system .	St
1.9.7	So , you get what you pay for , IMHO .	St
1.9.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.10.1	Thank you Willy and Bob .	St
1.10.2	You both make great points .	Polite
1.10.3	I did buy an entry level audiophile DAC and I do sense that the produce is being & quot ; overwhelmed & quot ; by electrical signals as Willy comments .	St
1.10.4	I could n't figure out how to close the thread after Bob 's last response which I found satisfactory .	St
1.11.1	I had the same problem with a user installed Creative Sound card .	St
1.11.2	I found the DAC lines into the card to be hanging near the power for a DVD drive .	St
1.11.3	After wrapping and grounding foil over the digital lines and dressing the power lines from the PS solved the popping and clicks and even reduced some hum .	St
