(This password would be provided to authorized persons.) Thanks. christy

Taken outside the house, it detects some networks. Some of these ask for a password forloggin-in. My questionis-how do I get of these ? How do I protect my access point so that a password is required to access it ? (other than not broadcasting the NAT address (SSID) ) Thanks. christy

How to protect you Office/home network Update the firmware in your wireless router(manufacturers website) Broadcast SSID Use WPA security(WEP can be hacked) Use nothing else. Your network will be secure. If using your computer in public, I recommend you have a firewall that works both ways, like Zone Alarm or Windows Vista. Rick

Make sure to broadcast SSID and update the firmware in your wireless router. If you don't have a wireless router, then purchase on to go with your ISP connection. Rick
