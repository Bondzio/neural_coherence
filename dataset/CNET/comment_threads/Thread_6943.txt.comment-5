I have already looked at the internet sharing connection and found nothing wrong with that side of it.
The weird thing about all this is that when I take my laptop to work, we have a stand alone pc which has broadband on it and I connect directly to that pc with a patch cable and everything works fine!
I can access all files from host pc to laptop and other way round, also the internet works every time!!
