Is there any way to completely remove the hidden partition (or just disable the F11 option after the BIOS)? I would like the extra space and removing that F11 function would really come in handy. Thank you!

These are generally quite small so you don't gain much in the way of hard drive space. I presume you already have your own fool proof backup method in place.

I have a feeling that the F11 option after the BIOS loads directly from the hidden partition. So removing the partition would mean removing the F11 option. Thanks for the help. Other comments are still welcome since I would rather not use 3rd party software to make this hidden partition visible.

I've not tried from a DOS boot disk, however. I know Acronis Disk Director works but that cost money. As for the F11 option, I can't speak to that as it may come from the BIOS or some special boot loader. Personally, I'd not worry about such a small loss of space but, if you want to try anyway, I'd make a full HD image including the recovery partition as well. You could always wipe the drive and just restore the primary partition to the full size of the drive. It would accomplish the same purpose.

And it's free. Sorry if I don't write a tutorial but it's a little easy to use. I also use GPARTED as well as EASYBCD for other minor duties. And those are free and well discussed on the net. Hope my sharing helps you save a buck, Bob
