<s> Hey, I am a student, and therefore on a tight budget. </s>
<s> My CRT monitor is starting to warp the text at the corners of the monitor and along the edges. </s>
<s> (the text is smaller at the edge than at the center of the screen) Is there any way to crack open the case and adjust this? </s>
<s> Obvioulsy, this thing is out of warranty, and when I do replace it I will just fork over the extra bucks for an LCD, but other than that, the monitor looks great and it is only three years old.... Kirby </s>
<s> About all you can do is try using the front panel controls to minimize such distortion such as trapezoid, barrel and pincushion (if these are available). </s>
<s> A good degaussing might help but this is mostly for correcting color distorion and convergence. </s>
<s> The innards of the monitor are not for the timid. </s>
<s> You would never be able to find the pots and other adjustments in the yoke that might achieve a better image. </s>
<s> My guess is most would make it worse as well as be subject to possible sever electrical shock from the charge that might remain on the envelope. </s>
<s> A three year old monitor is not that new and there might be some degradation of components that you cannot compensate for. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> Wish I had more hopeful news. </s>
