i have att dsl internet service with a 2wire wireless network router, which works ok, except for sporadic service interruptions.
from time to time there are 5-6 laptops and a printer working from it wirelessly and a dish network receiver wired to it.
problem is; i have two other dish receivers that need to be connecter by wire in different rooms/floors away from where the current 2wire router is located.
is there something i can used to connect these receivers by wire to my existing wireless network from 2wire?
thanks for any help!
