The 2 it missed were ' other pci bridge device and SM bus controller'.Is there a tool or something I can use to find these 2 drivers thats not to complicated.

Download the and install the drivers for your particular computer model and operating system from the computer maker (Dell, HP, Toshiba, etc.). 2. If the computer is a home build or from a local computer shop, download the drivers from the motherboard manufacturer's website. If driver is for a PCI card or other expansion slot, then download the drivers from the card maker's website. What is your computer brand and model number?
