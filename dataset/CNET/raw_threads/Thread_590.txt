Soemthing around $100, maybe a Pentium 4, between 2 and 3 ghz. Also need to know how difficult/simple this is? I've done quite a few upgrades that were all easy plug and play. Is this the same?

To upgrade to a P4, you need a motherboard or hold the P4, new power supply since it's quite hungry and the RAM changes too. With all the heat, a new case is fitted. If you were to stick with the P3, it's unlikely any real gain of moving to the 1.2GHz would be worth it even if your old machine could support it. Bob

I've already upgraded to 512 RAM, bought a new DVD burner, 160MB external HD, and 2.0 USB PCI card. So I'm pretty much at a point of no turning back to buy a new PC. If I could upgrade my processor I'd be good for a long time and have saved some cash. So mother board, power supply and the processor I understand, but you say I need a new tower case? That's sound like some work transfering everything over, or did I misunderstand.

P/S wattage. Upgrading the CPU does not automatically increase the speed of the system. The Clock Rate , Data Buss , Address Buss , Memory Type are all factors in overall system speed. Bill
