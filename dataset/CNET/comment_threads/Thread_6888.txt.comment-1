I use my Epson Stylus PHOTO 785EPX printer a lot and it seems that I have to do the Head Cleaning routine every two or three days, usually the black ink check pattern has gaps.
Ayway, I found the following site that has a lot of information about Epson head cleaning and a link to download a program, SSC Service Utility, that allows cleaning selected print heads instead of all of them: http://www.maxpatchink.com/epson-tips.shtml I haven't tried the single head cleaning yet but the SSC Service Utility looks interesting and does all kinds of stuff with the printer.
By the way, I refill my cartridges and have excellent results although I am sure refilling isn't for everyone...and don't tell me the refill ink clogs the heads.
I don't clean the heads any more than I had to with new Epson ink cartridges.
