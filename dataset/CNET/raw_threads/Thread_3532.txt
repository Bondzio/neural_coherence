The question I have is which will be more cost effective, getting an entire package from Dell or just getting a new CPU? The external hardware I have is fine and I don't necessarily want to upgrade my entire software suite. So, do I just prolong the aggony by holding on to my old programs untill I 'must' upgrade or should I bite the bullit and make the jump now?

You can keep your monitor, but your OS is probably WIN98 and that is so dated it's absurd, it's not supported with new hardware. If you had asked yesterday you could have purchased a Dell for $600 with a 2.6Ghz 800Mhz processor, 512meg memory, 40GB hard drive, Microsoft Office (Outlook, Word, Excel), Windows XP Home, Keyboard, mouse, 5.1 Digital Dolby Sound, Network card, Modem, Geforce FX5200 video card (supports dual monitors) including shipping and 1 year on site warranty. Today you can get the same configuration with 256meg of memory (512meg is now $100 extra). If you order the extra 256meg from Crucial.com you can get it for $55. Unfotunately the shipping may no longer be free either. If you wait until tomorrow it could cost $200 more for the exact same system. There is no way you can build a system and get the software as well, at this price.
