I originally ran the setup CD using my old desktop. However, I just bought a new Dell laptop and will be getting rid of the old desktop for good. The laptop is already on the wireless network and works great, but I want to make sure I'm not messing up anything by getting rid of the computer where the router was intalled. Is there anything I need to do to the new laptop as far as settings so that it knows the desktop won't ever be back. I am particularly curious because on the setup page, the Host Name is &quot;desktop&quot;, so I must have had to identify the machine somewhere in the setup (I wish I remembered!). All machines run Windows XP Home. Somebody please provide advice. Thanks!!!

I am giving it to a friend and plan to reformat the hard drive first. I know that won't make my data completely uncovereable, but I don't know of any free programs for that, so reformating is the best I can do. Thanks again!
