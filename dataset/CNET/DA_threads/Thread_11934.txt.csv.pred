1.2.1	Since you 've got both vga and dvi inputs , it will be easy if you 've got an xbox360 since you can pickup a vga output at most places that sell the 360 .	St
1.2.2	If you 've got a classic Xbox , vga adapters were made but they seem to have disappeared -- check ebay If your console has component outputs , ebay has transcoder for about $ 50 but i do n't know how good/bad the picture quality will be .	St
