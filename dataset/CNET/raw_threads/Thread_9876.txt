Lenevo y510 running Vista (32 bit) Hard drive worked perfect. Now all of a sudden it won't show it in the My Computer area. It shows it in the remove hardware and I downloaded the Western Digital Diagnostics program and it passes all the tests (ON THIS COMPUTER????) I have plugged three other things into this usb port and they all work. I have plugged the drive into three other computers and it all works there. Am I crazy?
