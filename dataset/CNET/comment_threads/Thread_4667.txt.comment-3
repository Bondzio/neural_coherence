and capability.
I'm pretty well pleased with my GeForce 6200TC.
I just gave 47 dollars for it at Newegg and am surprised how well it plays games.
But, of course, how well any card plays depends greatly on system specs.
A 5700 Ultra is generally much costlier than the cards of the same number and if you are going to spend $120 to $160 or so, I certainly look at a GeForce 6600GT.
