What do people think of the new Area 51?
Sounds ludicrously powerful: Microsoft Operating System Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit- English 1.8GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX260 graphics card Memory 6GB 1066MHz (3x2GB) Tri Channel Memory Hard Drive 640 GB Serial ATA non Raid (7200 Rpm) But would all applications/games etc work on the 64-bit windows?
