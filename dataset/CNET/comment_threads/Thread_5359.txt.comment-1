Hello All, I have a FSB question, my current Motherboard is a Gigabyte 8GE667Pro I have it for about 3 years now.
I am currently about to upgrade my Processor which is a Intel P4 2.53 533 FSB to 3.0 800FSB.
My concern is will my motherboard which is 533 FSB can it hand 800 FSB will it work?
Thanks Tyrone
