OK, let's be sure the heat sink is clean and if it's been a few years since the compound was replaced, do that.
I know it's hard on folk to look at the CPU and such temps and do the work but it's cheap and has paid off too many times.

Just in case.
If we don't see any improvement then you remove any SSDD and try a normal HDD.
