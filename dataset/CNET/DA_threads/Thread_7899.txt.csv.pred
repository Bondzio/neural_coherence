1.1.1	I have two machines I wish to use a KVM with .	St
1.1.2	One is my current mini-tower WinXP with PS/2 mouse & keyboard .	St
1.1.3	The other is my work laptop which only has USB ports .	St
1.1.4	I have been able to use a PS/2-to-USB adapter cable to use my PS/2 keyboard and mouse on the laptop .	St

1.1.6	If I boot up the laptop first ( the laptop is connected to the KVM via the PS/2-to-USB adapter cable ) , and then the mini-tower , I can use the laptop via the KVM .	St
1.1.7	And I can switch over to the mini-tower via the 'hotkey ' .	St
1.1.8	If I boot up the mini-tower first , and then the laptop , I can use the mini-tower via the KVM , but I can not switch over to the laptop .	St
1.1.9	Nor can I switch from the laptop to the tower back to the laptop .	St
