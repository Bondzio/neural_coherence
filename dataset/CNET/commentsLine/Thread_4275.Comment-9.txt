but thought i would check.
i do not believe you can hear anything through the cd rom headphone jack while an application has control of the drive.
you must turn off mp or other player and use the play button on the cd rom.
you can go so far as disconnecting the ide cable and trying the drive as a stand alone cd player.
good luck.
