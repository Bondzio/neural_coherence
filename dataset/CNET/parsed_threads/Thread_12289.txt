<s> I have tried using the netbook's vga port to external display, still no image. </s>
<s> While you shared you did that, why didn't you share that you tried the usual Gateway Fn+F5 combo to turn that port on? </s>
<s> I tried that after posting and did get video using vga port, but still no video on netbook display. </s>
<s> So I purchased a LCD screen, but only lighted screen and no computer image, still getting computer image using vga port. </s>
<s> Any other ideas, besides buy a new netbook or laptop( I like it because of its lightweight, I am not a gamer). </s>
<s> When it comes to the LCD you have the LCD (sorry but I had to list that), the cables and the motherboard. </s>
<s> There are few other parts unless you count the usual tape and mounting screws/hardware. </s>
<s> I still wonder why I had to ask about the FN key. </s>
<s> I know folk do not want to know their machines but in this case shouldn't the tech know this? </s>
<s> If they don't know this, maybe they don't know how to handle and install those flex cables? </s>
