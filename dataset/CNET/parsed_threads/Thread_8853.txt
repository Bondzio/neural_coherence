<s> I was looking at the user opinions on the CNET website for the Dazzle DVC 150 Digital Video Creator, and the reviews are horrible. </s>
<s> The thing is, a lot of them said the hardware was fine, but the software is horrible. </s>
<s> I don't really get what they mean by software (it its the editing software or something else), but if I wasn't going to use the Pinnacle Software, would it be fine for me? </s>
<s> I am planning to use Ulead Videostudio Software. </s>
<s> The USB connection required that the owner's PC USB support be &quot;there&quot;. </s>
<s> You can't imagine the number of posts about USB problems. </s>
<s> As such, I toss about 1/2 the bad reviews out just because many can't resolve USB issues. </s>
<s> On top of that there is no support from Dazzle to help you fix your PC's USB issue. </s>
<s> I've used the Dazzle products and like them. </s>
<s> But then I never have an USB issue. </s>
<s> The software is, of course dated now. </s>
<s> Plus those on DOS based OSes will scream about 4 GB file limits and what else will occur on the DOS based OSes. </s>
<s> I know this is not a full answer, but do consider that the user reviews do have issues. </s>
<s> If you want a little better solution, try some PCI TV capture card. </s>

<s> I absolutely HATED the Pinnacle Studio software it came with though and it worked perfectly for me with Power VCR-DVD. </s>
<s> Too bad you can't just buy the device without the software Pinnacle tosses at you, but the drivers for the device are on the same installation cd. </s>
<s> If you buy it, just leave Pinnacle installed and ignore the program completely.....and set the default program to be the one you will be using instead. </s>

<s> I was thinking of going with a Pinnacle Systems Studio AV/DV Version 9 Video Editing Kit, http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&dept=0&sku_id=0926INGFS10040467&catid=20401&newdeptid=20374 http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&dept=18&sku_id=0665000FS10040467&catid=10526&newdeptid=18 because the salesperson told me the Dazzle and this are pretty much the same except one is internal and one is on USB. </s>
<s> or... </s>
<s> I was thinking about getting a TV Tuner, because the TV Tuner would kinda be an added bonus that I might use in the future - although the salesperson told me that the quality may not be as good. </s>
<s> I was thinking of getting either a Hauppauge USB 2.0, or a Hauppauge PVR-250 TV Tuner. </s>
<s> What would be better? </s>
<s> One last thing, for the Pinnacle card, there is 256 MB Video Memory listed, is this a typo? </s>
<s> because i've never seen video memory on a card of that category. </s>
<s> The salesperson didn't know too much about the ATI cards... Are they in the same league as the ones in the previous post? </s>
<s> ATI TV Wonder External USB 2.0 Tuner Card http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&dept=0&sku_id=0926INGFS10054208&catid=20397&newdeptid=20374 ATI TV Wonder PCI Card http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&dept=0&sku_id=0926INGFS10055031&catid=20397&newdeptid=20374 </s>
<s> and again, I didn't like the Pinnacle software that came with it, but the card itself is awesome....great quality. </s>
<s> The Dazzle is still sitting on my desktop reading to plug in if I need it. </s>
<s> The one thing I liked about the Dazzle was when I was copying my VCR movies that had the macrovision encryption, it ripped it right out all by itself instead of my having to use the device I bought separately. </s>
<s> None of the internal cards ever could. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> and wasn't as impressed with it as I thought I would be. </s>
<s> It was easy to install, and use, but it was very proprietary about being the king of the hill in the system and I got more errors with that card installed (and its software) if I tried to go with using any other programs than anything else I've tried. </s>
<s> The card is still here, but in my spare system instead. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> I have used both ATI and Hauppauge TV cards. </s>
<s> Such run about 49 bucks and you get your analog capture without any fuss. </s>
<s> If you are going to go FIREWIRE, then the price plummets to under 20 bucks for Firewire card, cable and some software. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Most cards I see are 100dollars and up. </s>
<s> And as for digital/analog, I need both of them... </s>
<s> THe thing I liked about the Pinnacle card was that it had both inputs, but then again - I already have a couple of firewire cards. </s>
