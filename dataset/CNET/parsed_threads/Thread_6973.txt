<s> I just purchased a new computer. </s>
<s> I am sort of illiterate in what to do next. </s>
<s> I want to take everything off of my old computer and put it onto the new one. </s>
<s> I have already removed the items I don't want to keep but have pictures, music, documents, etc that I want to keep. </s>
<s> I also want to be able to leave some things on the old computer for my son to use. </s>
<s> I am going to have XP on the new one and Windows 98SE on the old one so I want to leave that. </s>
<s> My ? </s>
<s> is how do I take the stuff from the old one to the new one, is that done by copying everything to CDR's and then downloading them into the new computer somehow? </s>
<s> If so is there a place that will instruct me step by step how to do this? </s>
<s> And, if I copy everything on my C drive, isn't that all I will need to put on the new computer or should something else also be copied and put on the new computer. </s>
<s> It is a new Dell Dimension 4700 if that makes a difference. </s>
<s> Any help you could provide would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Pam.... perhaps this detailed link will help you? </s>

<s> You can purchase Intellimover, which makes the whole process very simple. </s>
<s> Pam: I too will soon be faced with that same dilemma; my 6 year old PC which is very old runs on WIN 95, is a P2 or a P3 and has a 4.0GB HD. </s>
<s> You mentioned you have a new Dell 4700. </s>
<s> Is it a Dell 4700 or the mini-tower Dell 4700C? </s>
<s> How long have you had it and how do you like it? </s>
<s> Anything come up yet requiring you to contact Dell's tech support? </s>

<s> Steve, I got the 4700 instead of the C model. </s>
<s> I wanted the larger one because that's what I am used to and they could do it faster because on the smaller one evidently everything had to be redone and would take longer to make. </s>
<s> This is my second Dell. </s>
<s> The original one I am using now is over 5 years old and never been serviced. </s>
<s> I have a brother in law that owns an insurance company and says he never has any problems with his Dell's (has 20 of them) but the 5 that are other brands give him trouble all of the time. </s>
<s> I chose another Dell since I love their products and service. </s>
<s> They helped me with info that was stupid all through the warranty time and even after the tech support was supposed to be over for me. </s>
<s> Anyway, it is still in the boxes in the hall and I haven't done the transfer work, but the info that I received from these very gracious people will help me do it the right way. </s>
<s> Incidentally, I ordered the Dell at 8:30 on Wednesday night and it was delivered to my door in complete with EXACTLY what I wanted on Friday at noon. </s>
<s> And that was with extra features added to my order and alot of changes made. </s>
<s> Can you believe that service???? </s>
<s> Thanks, Pam </s>
<s> Thank you so much for the link to the article. </s>
<s> I have read this in full and understand it better. </s>
<s> I believe I can tackle this now and get to using my new PC. </s>
<s> I appreciate your help. </s>
