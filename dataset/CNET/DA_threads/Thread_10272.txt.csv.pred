1.1.1	I have an Abit AA8XE mainboard which will supports up to 4Gig of Single/Dual channel DIMM modules , delivering bandwidth of 8.5GB/sec .	St
1.1.2	It originally used DDR2 400 but I have some newer DDR2 800 ( PC6400 ) .	St
1.1.3	Will there be any compatibility issues ?	Ques
1.2.1	compatibility depends on the actual dimms .	St
1.2.2	as long as they have spd timings for ddr2-533 and can function with 1.8V , you should be OK. ddr2-400 is a rare beast nowadays .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your input , i got it working good with both speeds of RAM !	St
1.3.2	Now if i can get the second memory bank slots to accept my other 1GB sticks ... ... ... .	St
