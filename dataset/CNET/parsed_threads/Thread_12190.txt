<s> I want a backup drive to store off site. </s>
<s> My win 7 box, which I just abandoned for iMac, has a new 1TB drive that I want to put into a USB enclosure for use with the Mac, for a shadow copy. </s>
<s> Want to keep old pc data on there too. </s>
<s> Problems? </s>
<s> There is one thing. </s>
<s> These devices are not &quot;storage.&quot; Just copies so be sure whatever you decide it isn't the last copy in existence of what you can't lose. </s>
<s> The newest Apple OSX will read and write to your Windows 7 NTFS formatted volume with no troubles UNLESS it's corrupt in some way. </s>
