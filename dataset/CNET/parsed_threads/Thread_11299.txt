<s> Hello people of CNET, This is my first post, so I don't know if it's placed in the correct forum, but here goes I'm currently assigned the task of purchasing new wireless access points, for our offices, at my workplace. </s>
<s> We've previously been using &quot;HP V-M200&quot; access points, but we encoutered heavy throughput problems with these. </s>
<s> During my tests of the network, I've seen these APs decrease their tranfer-rate to 30Mb, during file-transfer and ping-test. </s>
<s> The issue here is concerning the transfer-rate from the Network Interface Card of my laptop to the wireless AP (did an iptraf while testing, and then noticed the 30Mb). </s>
<s> Suffice to say, we're after the best of the best in wireless technology, but our realistic demands are as follows: - Supports 802.11n, a-b and g. - Supports up to 2 ESSIDS. </s>
<s> - Supports VLAN. </s>
<s> - Supports WPA2 and RADIUS. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Or is there somebody with some good experience, with certain APs that fulfills these criteria? </s>
<s> For example your new IT person might use Windows Explorer for that. </s>
<s> Your seasoned IT person uses FTP or a test tool. </s>
<s> Since WiFi is a shared access system, it's proper for the speed to drop off so that others can get access. </s>
<s> I wonder if folk in this industry talk to buyers about all this. </s>
<s> It's been a few years but the last we used Cisco. </s>
<s> The models have changed so I won't tell what we used back then. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
