Emachines T4165 System Specs Type of system: Desktops/Servers Bus Architecture: PCI/AGP Hard Drive Bus: EIDE Native OS: Windows XP Home CPU Type: 1.6GHz Intel Pentium 4 Memory Specs Standard Memory: 256 MB (removable) Maximum Memory: 2 GB Memory Expansion: 2 sockets Memory Comments: PC100/PC133 SDRAM Modules It has a CD/RW and a DVD drive.
The graphics card is a nVidia TNT2 64mb.It also has a 60gb hard drive.
Thats my old comkputer.
It got fried so i assume it took out the motherboard and power supply.
I have $400 to spend on a new system and i could use parts from my old one, maybe the cd r/w, dvd drive, and hard drive.
So i would need a new motherboard, cpu, power supply, maybe case, more ram definately, and maybe a graphics card if there isn't built in graphics.
I prety much want the most for the money with it being upgradeable in the future.
Any help is very much appreciated.
I don't think you are allowed to link places but if you want to send some specific links to parts and such you can email me at lxtrix@gmail.com
