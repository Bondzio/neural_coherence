i wish i could find the restore cd.
the instructions i received were much different than the ones you noted.
the ones i got lead me thru a series of bios changes plus downloading &quot;microsoft bus driver&quot; and other procedures.
this was not a downgrade from vista.
this was a reinstall of windows xp this machine uses audio codecs, legacy drivers, and realtek high definition audio.
i even went to realtek and tried their drivers.
i guess i will try to install a audio card and see if that works.
thanks for your help.
