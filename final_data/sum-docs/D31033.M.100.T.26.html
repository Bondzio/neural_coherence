The government says Netscape rejected Microsoft's collusion pact, while Microsoft replies that the government is misrepresenting what was a routine business meeting.
According to the government, Microsoft offered to make an investment in Netscape and give Netscape's software developers crucial technical information about the Windows operating system if Netscape would agree not to make a browser for Windows 95 operating system, which Microsoft released two months later.
Microsoft will offer its own opening remarks on Tuesday.
In court Thursday, Microsoft presented memos and e-mail messages suggesting that Netscape had eagerly sought the June meeting.
