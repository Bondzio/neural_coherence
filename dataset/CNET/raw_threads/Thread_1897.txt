I purchased an ASUS p4S8x MB off ebay. I also purchased a P4 2.6 ghz 533mhz processor. Well the problem is the proocessor turned out to be a 800 mhz processor. I guess it was listed wrong or I was just screwed by some seller. My question is will this processor work on this board? Any help will be greatly appreciated.

If not it will simply run at DDR 333.

[200 times quad, which is 4 thus 800].
