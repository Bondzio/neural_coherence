Every living fibre in me is telling me to get the new MacBook but I can't help but wonder if a PC would be much more suitable for my studies. I'll be using the laptop mainly for music, movies and work. So, Mac or PC?

If there is, go get a Mac. If there isn't, go get a Mac, load Boot Camp, load Windows and only use it for that one, absolutely have to use, Windows program. The rest of the time, enjoy OS X Would that be the MacBook or the MacBook Pro? P

Yup, took your advice and asked my school to which they replied by sending me this link, http://www.cae.wisc.edu/site/public/?title=onetoone and by telling me that the engineering department runs Windows and Unix machines. Sorry but I'm a (soon to be) first time Mac user, shouldn't a Mac be able to work since its based on Unix? Anyways, as mrmacfixit asked, I think it's going to be the 2Ghz MacBook and I'll throw in my own 2GB of ram.

Available as Office 2004 for Mac, Student & Teacher edition ($125) has everything except MS Access. Check out the On Line Software Catalog, they sell Mac stuff! Also note that their &quot;recommended&quot; computer purchase is a Windows box. The fact that the engineering department runs UNIX machines does not mean that require students to have a computer that will run Unix. I am not aware of a UNIX/Windows dual boot machine, Bob will comment if there is, but you have an advantage as your Mac has a form of UNIX already, if you actually need a UNIX machine. Your lovely new 2GHZ Macbook will do admirably and, with Boot Camp, will even run Windows. Good luck P
