<s> Can i use only an hdmi cable to connect a new vizio 26 inch television which I am going to use as a monitor to a new gateway computer ? </s>
<s> As long as the Gateway has an HDMI port on the back </s>
<s> You need to install a VID card with HDMI capability to get audio/video. </s>
<s> If the monitor has VGA or DVI you could still hook up and use for a monitor but no audio. </s>
