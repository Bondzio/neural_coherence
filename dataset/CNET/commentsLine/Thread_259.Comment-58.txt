you have deleted the two drives ??
and did a restart ??
did it come up with 'new hardware found' ?
?
if it did then click it to start the setup one of the screens will ask where to get drivers and has a 'i have disk' insert disk and click next.
xp will use its generic drivers to get to the drive.
hopefully this will do the job ted
