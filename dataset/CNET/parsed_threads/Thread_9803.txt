<s> I have been having this problem for a while now, but is getting progressively worse. </s>
<s> My computer shuts down when I am running CPU intensive things, so I am assuming that it is my CPU. </s>
<s> I think it may be my power supply too, but I'm not sure. </s>
<s> I am running: Intel pentium 4 3.4gig processor NVIDIA GeForce 6800 series graphics card 2 512 sticks of RAM (not sure what kind though) My processor runs at around 55-60C, and I think I saw somewhere that it is rated at 65 so I am worried that that may be the problem. </s>
<s> The only reason I don't think it's an overheating problem is, it shuts down right when I start my computer. </s>
<s> Yesterday, I pushed the power button and it shut down in a second or two. </s>
<s> And this happens after the computer has been off for the whole day, so it couldn't be hot anymore. </s>
<s> I took the heat sink and fan off and checked the thermal paste. </s>
<s> It looked like it was starting to dry out, but my friend said it was would work fine. </s>
<s> I didn't have any extra thermal paste at the time, or else I would have replaced it anyways. </s>
<s> Everything seems to be on correctly, and a lot of people I have asked don't really have an answer for me because it shuts down under wierd circumstances. </s>
<s> I don't have access to my computer right now, I am at school, but I can check anything you guys would need if you need any other information. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> As Robert mentioned, just replace the heatsink paste. </s>
<s> Remember to use only a dab of it, not too much or little. </s>
<s> Be sure the cpu fan is 100% running. </s>
<s> When heat was present from before it could have stressed the componets, and its important to understand it is now maybe too late, the weak link is stressing out and causes a shutdown for whatever reason. </s>
<s> If not the cpu, then psu comes into play. </s>
<s> Leave the side cover off and see what happens after paste is replaced. </s>
<s> AND if you haven't already clean the dust bunnies out. </s>
<s> You said: &quot;The only reason I don't think it's an overheating problem is, it shuts down right when I start my computer. </s>
<s> Yesterday, I pushed the power button and it shut down in a second or two. </s>
<s> And this happens after the computer has been off for the whole day, so it couldn't be hot anymore.&quot; \\\\\\\\ As I explained above, the weak link is already affected, so heat damage maybe present. </s>
<s> In other words don't take anything for granted. </s>
<s> Also, check the bios &quot;over temp&quot; setting, it can be set to reboot or shutdown, what are the results if you reset that? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> K... </s>
<s> I changed the heatsink paste and have been running my computer with the side off. </s>
<s> At this point I'm positive the damage has been done already. </s>
<s> I'm not really optimistic about a quick fix. </s>
<s> Now, I just want to figure out what needs to be replaced. </s>
<s> I talked to someone about it, and he said it's most likely my CPU or my Motherboard. </s>
<s> He said it also could be my RAM(I have 2 512mb sticks) I took one out and it still happened, then switched them and it still happened, so I don't think it's my RAM. </s>
<s> If anyone has any easy ways of testing my CPU, power supply, or motherboard, anything would be appreciated. </s>
<s> It's unlikely to take damage (we can watch the tomshardware video) but random reboots are often traced back to aging or overtaxed power supplies (did you tell what you used?) </s>
<s> or a failed memory stick. </s>
<s> Here's a test I use -&gt; http://www.memtest86.com The only good result is zero errors regardless how long you run it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> listen closely, remember there pattern, it's sort of like Morse code. </s>
<s> I don't know if I should laugh or not, cause I can't tell if your serious. </s>
<s> But, it doesn't restart, it shuts down, but the caps lock light on my keyboard stays on. </s>
<s> I have to hold the on button to shut it down completely. </s>
<s> And, like I said in my previous post, I don't think its the RAM, because I tested them by themselves(unless of course, both of them failed), but I will do the memtest86 or w/e it was and get back to you. </s>
<s> I can't see what my power supply is. </s>
<s> Sometime tonight I'll take it off and see if I can figure out what it is. </s>
<s> My power supply is Rosewill value series RU450. </s>
<s> Model number AP500X. </s>
<s> 450W max power. </s>
<s> I must be retarded or something, because I can't figure out how to use the memtest86. </s>
<s> Could you tell me step by step the way to make a cd-rom of it. </s>
<s> I unzipped it and burned it to a cd. </s>
<s> I set my BIOS to boot from my DVD drive, but it didn't find anything there, so it booted from my HD. </s>
<s> I was thinking about what could be wrong, and I was looking through my BIOS settings and went to the power tab. </s>
<s> It said something about saving power, so I changed that. </s>
<s> It was ACPI suspend state, I changed it from S1 state to S3 state. </s>
<s> I'm not sure exactly what it does, but it seemed to make my computer shut down after a longer time. </s>
<s> This might just be my imagination and it is completely unrelated, but if someone could give an explanation, that'd be great. </s>
<s> I'd much rather buy a new power supply than a new CPU, so I'm hoping it's the power supply at this point. </s>
<s> See link for HP beep codes: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?docname=bph07107&cc=us&dlc=en&lc=en&jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN In fact there just what you need. </s>
<s> That's an ISO file so if you put that on a CD, oopps. </s>
<s> Instead you need to create the CD from the ISO &quot;image&quot;. </s>
<s> You didn't tell what software you use so I can't tell you exactly what to do except you never put the file on a CD, you create the CD from the ISO image... Bob </s>
<s> RAM that is faulty or in the wrong place. </s>
<s> Run this test. </s>
<s> http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp Have you made any changes with your RAM? </s>
<s> Check your manual to see if it's mounted in the PC correctly. </s>
<s> 0 (zero) is the slot closest to the CPU. </s>
