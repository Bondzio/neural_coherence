your manual or mtrbd.
support website will clearly explain what highest cpu that mtrbd.
can support.
further, you may need to update the bios in order to spport any newer cpu or devices as the case maybe since you brought the system/mtrbd.
so it pays to visit the support anyways, to get the latest *facts*.
good luck ------willy
