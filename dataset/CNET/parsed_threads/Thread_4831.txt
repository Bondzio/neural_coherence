<s> Does it matter what speed a Hard Drive I buy? </s>
<s> I was told tha I should try and keep the speeds the same. </s>
<s> So If I have a 5600prm I should buy one that is that speed. </s>
<s> Does it matter? </s>
<s> If it does, how do I find out what I have? </s>
<s> But most will want the 7200 RPM models since the 5400 RPM were value devices that came with the machine. </s>
<s> Only someone having a lot of 5400 RPM drives would tell you to go slow. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It won't matter that much. </s>
<s> Get a 7200rpm HD and use it as master to get any speed benefit from it. </s>
<s> If it is on the same IDE cable as the 5400rpm, it may slow down alittle but really not noticable unless its really old, thus make the faster HD the master. </s>
<s> If the orginal 5400 is 10gb or less, leave it out as 80gb and better are good deals in everyway over any 10gb or less. </s>
<s> The real plus on a faster HD is the &quot;buffer cache&quot; it has which helps alot on HD activity, so look for 8 or better. </s>
<s> Hoever, if you find a *real* good deal on a 5400, it save some $, but the 7200 is better even if you pay more. </s>
<s> When, you boot-up look for the display showing master/slave devices, the HD &quot;model#&quot; hit the pause key quickly to better view it. </s>
<s> The makers support website will offer any details/specs on that model plus any new HD you plan to buy of respective maker. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> The most hardrive information I could find was it is a &quot;Quantum Fireball CR13.0A&quot; Complete System Specifications: IBM Aptiva 2171 Intel Pentium III @ 449 Mhz Quantum Fireball CR13.0A 12GB HDD 256MB of RAM Internal Modem 10/100 Ethernet card </s>

<s> Unlike other pieces of your PC, you don't have to keep at the slow RPMs of the factory drive. </s>
<s> In fact, it would be bad advice to do so. </s>
<s> You'll want the new 7200 RPM drive. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ok, I'm looking for either a 120 or 160 giger. </s>
<s> But then what about cost considerations? </s>
<s> 7200 even sounds expensive. </s>
<s> You don't see many 5400 drives on the shelf. </s>
<s> It doesn't carry the premium it used to. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Is it possible to make the 7400 the master HD wihout having to wipe my other HD? </s>
<s> Or how can I just remove windows and keep my documents and program files </s>
<s> How? </s>
<s> Just clone the drive with the supplied software, then boot up with the combo you wanted and then... use explorer to clean up the second drive after its all working. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Wow. </s>
<s> I was getting worried I was going to have to re-install windows...blah blah blah. </s>
<s> Now I just need to see where the drive will FIT. </s>
