1.1.1	I recently purchased a new computer and very happy with it, with one small exception: it doesn't have HDMI output.	St
1.1.2	Would like to stream movies, TV shows and etc and display them on my HDTV.	St
1.1.3	Is there a relatively inexpensive way to get HDMI output on my PC?	St
1.1.4	Thanks in advance for the help.	St

1.2.1	If so you may find playing &quot;protected&quot; content quite the hoot.	St
1.2.2	But the cheap way is a video card with a HDMI output.	St

1.3.1	Any models of video cards you think I should consider?	St
1.3.2	Thanks!	St
1.4.1	I shop at Newegg.com for such.	St
