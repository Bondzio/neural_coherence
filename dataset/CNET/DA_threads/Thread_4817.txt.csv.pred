1.1.1	Hello First of all I would like to apologize if mu questions seem silly.	St
1.1.2	I have been into computers for a long time, but now that winter break is coming and I have some time to play games, I am ready to upgrade my computer.	St
1.1.3	I just bought a 24inch monitor and would like a video card that would make it look pretty.	St
1.1.4	First of all, this is the computer that I have - Sony vaio VGC-RB30, with following specs listed on this website: http://www.superwarehouse.com/Sony_VAIO_RB30C/VGC-RB30/ps/471790 I did upgrade my memory, I have 1.5 gigs.	St
1.1.5	I also have a geforce pci card in there but its kind of old (512mb, i believe its 6800).	St
1.1.6	I was looking to upgrade it to either GeForce 8800 GTX, Radeon 4850 or GeForce 9800 GTX.	St
1.1.7	I do not know if my power supply would allow for those and if it does not, what are my options.	St
1.1.8	Also, with my previous radeon card, I had problem of overheating.	St
1.1.9	I think my tower does not have good cooling system.	St
1.1.10	I did install two extra fans, but one went dead so when I play I have to place an outside (big home fan) by the computer.	St
1.1.11	I would also like to purchase a video card that I could transfer to a new computer when I have money to buy it.	St
1.1.12	For right now though I just want an upgrade.	St
1.1.13	Please, let me know what I should do!	Sug
1.1.14	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I forgot to say that I would be willing to change the tower if it someone thinks its possible.	St
1.2.2	I do need a better cooling tower with a bigger supply.	St
1.2.3	My question is though how hard is it to change towers and which tower would my motherboard and other things fit into.	St
1.2.4	Thanks Again!	St
1.3.1	good work that would make your desk proud	Sug
1.4.1	If you have heat issues you must get a new case.	St
1.4.2	As for the power supply, you will need a new one get around a 500 watt but try to get over just to be safe you wont need more then 750 watts.	St
1.4.3	It is easy to swap out components from the old case unless Sony is annoying and built it so you can't take the stuff out.	St
1.4.4	Here are a couple things I recommend.	St
1.4.5	Cases:It doesn't really matter just get lots of fans but it looks like you have a micro ATX mobo so be sure your case is compatible with that:) Here are some good ones: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811103011 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119152 Power supplies: Get one with 80 or higher efficiency http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139005 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371015 Graphics:You only have a PCIx16 so you can get a PCI 2.0 card but you wont get the full potential: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814103057 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127387 I hope this helps and fits your expectations, sorry for making it so long.
