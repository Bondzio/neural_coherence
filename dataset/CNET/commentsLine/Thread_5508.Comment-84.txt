gee, no-one has mentioned to check your mother board settings.
many motherboards have a default usb setting of 1.0 to 1.5 while the external hds have a usb 2.0 setting and may not be able to read down to the lower setting.
that is exactly what happened to me.
when i changed the motherboard setting to usb 2.0, everything worked fine....even the external hd that was sitting at the front door, ready to be thrown out.....
