OK, I tried to install pinnacles Studio av/dv card and software (computer met minimum requirements at least), Computer wouldn't recognize card, got a P-N-P config error on startup (which I posted here about and got no response) could still go to windows and work normally.
Wouldn't install drivers for card, guess because of the non-recognized card.
talked with pinnacle and Dell tech to no avail... No conflicts in irq's either.
Device manager showed not working properly.
OK, now after all of this I have no sound, Device manager shows nothing wrong.
I've uninstalled all software that came with card and taken the card out.
Never could get it all to work, now I'm without sound.
Any Ideas would be appreciated, although I'm still working on it...
Thanks, Duane
