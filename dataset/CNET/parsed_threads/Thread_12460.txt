<s> I need a tablet or something tablet-sized that I can really be productive on. </s>
<s> My purpose is that I want something discreet and convenient that I can carry in my hand to work every day. </s>
<s> But I want to be able to duck out to Starbucks over my lunch break to do some job hunting (hate my job!) </s>
<s> and all that entails... tweaking resume, PDF'ing, attaching to email, using browser in parallel. </s>
<s> Also want to catch up on my personal finances, etc. </s>
<s> I had an iPad 2 in the past, which was fine for note-taking and simple email, but not really up to the task of such workflow... at least not in a convenient way. </s>
<s> I currently have a 9&quot; Chinese OEM Android tablet purchased on Groupon. </s>
<s> It is fine for reading on, but just too laggy and unpleasant do anything serious with. </s>
<s> What do I need? </s>
<s> The Surface 2 actually seems ideal for my needs, but I'd need to wait another month. </s>
<s> Surface Pro 2 seems awesome, but the price is quite steep. </s>
<s> Should I be considering another solution? </s>
<s> The one I see has Microsoft's Restricted OS (RT) and I will not buy something that is not a Personal Computer. </s>
<s> You could look at the Surface Pro models or an UltraBook. </s>
<s> The office picked up an Asus x202e for 300 bucks refurb so I use that a bit. </s>
<s> Nice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> IMO the tablet are not the replace but the additional of the laptop. </s>
<s> The surface is the Touch laptop without keyboard and mouse. </s>
