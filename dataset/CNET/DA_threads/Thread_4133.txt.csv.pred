1.1.1	Is there a difference in performance between SOCKET 754 or 939 for AMD Athlon 64 ?	Ques
1.2.1	Given you did n't note any budget restraint , 939 gives you more memory bandwidth and access to the dual core CPUS .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Since 939 is the way to go for future expansion ( dual-core ) , how do you find out of a 939 MOBO supports 90nm .	St
1.4.2	I 've looked with no luck .	Polite
1.4.3	chuck	St
1.5.1	Let 's bring this down to Earth fast .	St
1.5.2	There are sites like www.tomshardware.com that have benchmarks .	St
1.5.3	But what I 've seen is that motherboards rarely cause a benchmark to move about .	St
1.5.4	Since you did n't define what would be better ( benchmark , dollars or such ) , your question ca n't be answered .	St
1.5.5	Even moreso you did n't supply any possible boards for consideration .	St
1.5.6	Here 's why this matters .	St
1.5.7	Some posters are in Aus , some in Britain and what 's available where you are may not be some board I would point at .	St
1.5.8	In closing , if your board supplier wo n't talk to you about this , why are you doing business with them ?	Ques
1.5.9	Bob	St
1.6.1	AMD provided mobo mfrs well in advanced the voltage levels that the chip would use .	St
1.6.2	Pretty certain that other parameters are internal chip parameters and both the 130 and 90 's use the same pinouts .	St
1.6.3	However I think that John Robie had posted something that only certain models would support Dual Core .	St
1.6.4	Maybe email John .	St
1.6.5	Long range , however , because putting the MCH on the CPU chip has boxed them in to using only DDR [ no DDR2 ] .	St
1.6.6	New socket scheduled for mid 2006 [ but bet that they beat that if Intel does something to spur them to beat that schedule ] for CPU 's supporting DDR 2 .	St
