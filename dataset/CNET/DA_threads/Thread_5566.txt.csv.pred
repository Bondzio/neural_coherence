1.1.1	I 'm buying a new computer from dell ( XPS600 ) .	St
1.1.2	I just want to know which videocard should I get : 1 ) 512MB ATI Radeon X1900 XTX Or : 2 ) Dual 256MB PCI Express x16 ( DVI/VGA/TV-out ) nVidia GeForce 6800 Just out of personal preference , which do you feel is better ?	Ques
1.1.3	Friends of mine say they like nVidia over ATI and I just need some opinions Here are the specs for the computer if you want to know : -Pentium D Processor 940 with Dual Core Technology ( 3.20GHz , 800FSB ) - 2GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM -250GB Serial ATA Hard Drive	St
1.2.1	it is much faster than dual 6800s .	St
1.2.2	if you 're trying to save money compared to an x1900xtx , consider a 7900gt ( very hard to find ) or an x1800xt ... both will be in the $ 275 - $ 310 ballpark and both will perform better than dual 6800s .	St
1.3.1	with those specs seems you 've spaired no expense .	St
1.3.2	Go for the Radeon it 's all about the sexy	St
1.4.1	The Radeon blows away the 6800 , by the way .	St
1.5.1	Get the nVidia GeForce 6800 .	St
1.5.2	Great deal for great performance .	Polite
