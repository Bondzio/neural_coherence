but then you will learn that the decoder on these things only supports this and that encoding method.
it is entirely possible to encode hd video in a way that this player can't play, play well or have an issue.
the unseasoned user will reply &quot;it plays on my pc.&quot; 3. sure there are.
it's called a bd player.
also you can get bd content with some &quot;digital copy&quot; feature.
but i doubt they support much more than pcs, iphones or android things.

while all you want is technically feasible, the industry will not offer what you asked for because that would be the end of bd (hd) content.
