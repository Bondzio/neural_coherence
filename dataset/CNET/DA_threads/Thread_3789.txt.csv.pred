1.1.1	This question is also posted in the digital music forum .	St
1.1.2	I 'm thinking about converting my entire CD collection to MP3 's .	St
1.1.3	I understand the MusicMatch Jukebox is among the best pieces of software for ripping CD 's to MP3 .	St
1.1.4	My question comes in with hardware .	St
1.1.5	I know the hard way to do this is to manually feed each CD into the tray and let the software do it 's thing .	St
1.1.6	However , I have 200+ CD 's ( I have n't really counted , but it 's a fairly high number ) .	St
1.1.7	Can anyone think of a way to rig up one of those 100 disc CD changers for stereo systems to automate the process of ripping a CD collection ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks for any thoughts/advice .	St

1.3.1	I have over 600 CDs , and I converted every one of them to MP3 , and the best way to do it is through your PCs CD-ROM .	St
1.3.2	I 've noticed that running RCA cables to and from your sound card degrades the quality of the sound .	St
1.3.3	Your files will be the same size ( depending on your settings ) no matter what they end up sounding like .	St
1.3.4	It 's going to be a long process , but you can always walk away while it 's working .	St
1.3.5	What I did was start as soon as possible ( I think I had about 350-400 CDs at the time ) with your conversions .	St
1.3.6	Each time you buy a new CD , make ripping it the first thing you do .	St
1.3.7	It 'll take you about 5 minutes and then it 's done !	St
1.3.8	Another tip for you - and this is coming from my own experience - stick with a bit rate of 128 .	St
1.3.9	My first several CDs were done at 192 , to get that higher quality sound ... . no difference in quality in both my high end car stereo and my high end home stereo systems .	St
1.3.10	And the space that you save will be worth it in the future .	St
1.3.11	I used Xing MP3 for ripping .	St
1.3.12	I 've head a lot of complaints about it , but I 've never had any problems with it .	St
1.3.13	The ID3 tags were not very important to me , but that is a time consuming task with Xing ; so I just passed on it .	St
1.3.14	Good luck and enjoy the convenience of having all of your music available at the click of a mouse for making audio CDs , playlists , and ( my personal favorite ) MP3 CDs !	St
