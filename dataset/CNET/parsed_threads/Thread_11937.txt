<s> Hi I just assembled a new system but I couldn't make it work. </s>
<s> I got a p965 neo motherboard from MSI and it has 4 memory slots. </s>
<s> Currently I only have one 1gb ddr2 memory installed. </s>
<s> The manual of the motherboard didn't discuss much about memory configuration. </s>
<s> My Pc turns on but it beeps continuesly and doesn't go to POST.I have doubts that It might need a second memory or maybe the motherboard requires only a pair of memory. </s>
<s> I am buying again a 1gb ddr2 memory but I wanna make sure my doubts really is true. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I would appreciate any reply. </s>

<s> shouldn't ddr memories be install in pairs (same capacity). </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> make sure it is properly and securely seated. </s>
<s> I had two memories stick in banks 1 & 2 then I took the first one out and the thing still works. </s>
<s> Go here ...it's a great trouble shooting guide by MSI...believe you can download it too. </s>

<s> Your mobo should support a single stick..pairs are better. </s>
<s> Is the stick in the proper slot? </s>
<s> Is the stick a supported speed? </s>
<s> Seems like pc2-4200/5300/6400. </s>
<s> I tried the beeping pattern, and tells me that it maybe a card not properly inserted or missing component. </s>
<s> I already tried different slots and still the same however if I don't install the memory, when I turn on my computer it doesn't beep anymore but ofcourse doesn't work. </s>
<s> I heard rumors a long time ago that if the motherboard have 4 memory banks it should require 2 memories but if only 3 banks it can accept 1 memory but that was old days already. </s>
<s> Call the memory supplier to see if it is compatible with your mobo. </s>
<s> If it is, try re-seating it firmly. </s>
<s> Better to insert it with the mobo out of case and lying on a flat firm surface. </s>
<s> moving the PC around can cause the AGP card to shift in the slot and not work . </s>

<s> just like you're experiencing. </s>

<s> all work with one stick of the correct memory, however will then run in single channel mode.. </s>
<s> The four slots provide capability to run two pairs of memory in Dual Channel Mode. </s>
<s> One possible confusion when running Dual channel mode is that most mobos want one stick in the first slot and an identical stick in the third slot. </s>
<s> The individual pairs must be the same size memory, but each pair can be a different capacity. </s>
<s> Read the manual. </s>
<s> Unfortunately some mobos use adjacent slots for the dual channels, thus one must read the manual. </s>
<s> They all should run just fine with a single memory stick, but it will be in single channel mode. </s>
<s> Some of the better mobos are rather fussy about which memory will run in their slots. </s>
<s> Check the mobo mfr's website for approved [they tested] brands and models. </s>
<s> I just bought a second memory but unfortunately the first memory (Elpida brand) didn't work in my motherboard while my second memory works perfectly.Now I'm convince it will run only 1 stick memory module in 4 slot motherboard. </s>
<s> The one I'm figuring out right now is i couldn't boot my original windows.Maybe I need reinstalling it and re activate it again. </s>
<s> Anyway thank you guys for your help. </s>
<s> I tried upgrading my HP m7640n by adding 2, 1G sticks to the unused memory slots. </s>
<s> They are the correct size -- actually identical to what came with stock with the computer. </s>
<s> When I go to bios after installing, it will not acknowledge the 4th slot -- it says not installed. </s>
<s> I've tried reseating it and rearanged the sticks to find out if it was a faulty memory stick. </s>
<s> The did nothing. </s>
<s> Is it likely that the 4th slot is some how damaged or is there something not right with the puter to only take 3g's of RAM. </s>
<s> I have an AMD64 Duel processor. </s>
<s> I am having the same problem as well. </s>
<s> I can use any 4 of my 1GB DIMS in slots 1-3, alone or all 3, but I cannot put any of them into slot 4. </s>
<s> If I put anything into slot 4, the computer boots, but no video. </s>
