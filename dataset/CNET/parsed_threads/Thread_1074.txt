<s> I am having trouble installing my printer. </s>
<s> I have a PC running Windows XP. </s>
<s> I have a Apollo p-2500 printer that I am trying to install. </s>
<s> It won't let me install any printer, but this is the particular one I have. </s>
<s> I downloaded the installer and after it installs mostly, it gives me a message that say, &quot;Environment specified is invalid.&quot; I have been unable to find any help with this. </s>
<s> Does anybody know? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> This sounds like a corruption of the file. </s>
<s> I'd download it again or try to find another version of it. </s>
<s> I downloaded it from various places and it still doesn't work. </s>
<s> I didn't know if that was something to do with the Registry because it talks about environments when you look at the registry under printers. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> you said it won't let you install any printers. </s>
<s> What other printers have you tried and what went wrong with those installations? </s>
<s> Did you get the same error? </s>
<s> No, i only tried to download it from several places. </s>
<s> Maybe that is the problem because now that i look back, the different sites may be leading me to the same download point. </s>
<s> Does anybody know where I can download the correct driver for XP for Apollo P-2500? </s>

<s> Same thing. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Really frustrating. </s>
