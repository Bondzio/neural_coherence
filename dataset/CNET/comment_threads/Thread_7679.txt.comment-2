This is where one creates a BUSINESS PLAN with projections and more.
If they don't do this, then they shouldn't venture into this space.
There are also some that won't put in the needed 18+ hours a day to launch their new business or will not have the capital to run for a few years without a profit.
No business plan = no business.
Hope this explains it.
