you can install a new larger hd on that computer, but you may have to install a hard disk controller on a pci card if the drive is larger than 127gb (detailed explanation: 48bitlba.com or seagate.com ).
does your current hd plug directly into your motherboard or into a pci card?
if a pci card, what is the name of the pci hard disk controller card?
bottom line: get a &lt; 127gb ata/100 or ata/133 hard drive if you stick with windows98se.
you might want to consider upgrading to windows xp to avoid some complications and have a more stable os, in general.
