Hi...
I am in the market for a new desktop, but am stymied at the array of products out there.
My current computer is an old Pentium, and though I need to keep price under control, I want a new desktop that won't be obsolete in a few years.
I've looked at the ZT brand from Costco, and Gateway, etc.
and would like to keep price under $1000.
I am thinking I need an Intel processor, either the core i5 or i7, to make sure it is as up to date as I can get.
Am I correct?
I want a fast, efficient, mid-range computer... can anyone recommend some specific computers?
