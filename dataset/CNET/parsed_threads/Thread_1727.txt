<s> I've found a barebone system with every thing I want, but hesitant about the Harddrive bundled. </s>
<s> It's a 120 gig IEDE Maxtor ultra ATA 133, but only 5400 RPM and &lt;13 average seek time. </s>
<s> Since I am upgrading equipment (P4 3.0 Mhz, 512MB PC3200 DDR 400MHz) to speed things up; Is this drive considered &quot;old stuff&quot;. </s>
<s> Or does ist matter. </s>
<s> I read a report a while back where someone had done a test of 5400 vs 7200. </s>
<s> In their test they did not see much of a diff. </s>
<s> Yes 7200 was slightly better. </s>
<s> Where they did see a big diff was in cache size. </s>
<s> Bigger is better. </s>
<s> So if your looking to squeeze out all the juice get a 7200 unit with the biggest cache you can find/afford </s>
<s> but you may never notice the difference between it, and a newer 7200 drive. </s>
<s> However, if you are upgrading things, may consider getting a new 7200 drive. </s>
<s> and using the old drive for a backup. </s>
<s> Just a thought, as the 5400 drive will probably serve you well. </s>
<s> Thanks guys. </s>
<s> I may unload the unboxed drive on ebay, and go for a newer one to put in this barebone kit Rob </s>
<s> There is a significant and immediately noticeable difference between a 5400RPM drive and a 7200RPM drive. </s>
<s> You don't even want to consider the slower drive in anything but a laptop. </s>
<s> I have upgraded many in the past and in every case the owner immediately noticed their system was quite a bit faster. </s>
<s> Particularly with everything else you're getting for your system. </s>
<s> The hard drive is about the slowest thing in a computer. </s>
<s> So the faster it is the faster the entire system is. </s>
