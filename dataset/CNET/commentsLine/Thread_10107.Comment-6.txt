check your sound card vs video card compatibilities; if you visit creative labs you might find you've got a lucky combo.. jonah's advice sounds good to me, it's nice to hear & see the proof for yourself b4 jumping in the deep end.
maybe you're confident about online purchase, it certainly cuts out the middleman.
if you're going gaming there's always going to be some formats that are out of bounds depending how much warranty u've left.
