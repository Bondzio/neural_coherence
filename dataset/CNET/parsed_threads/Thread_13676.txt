<s> When I play video games, the game will speed up and become really jerky. </s>
<s> I've only experienced this with San Andreas. </s>
<s> I've tried turning the settings down and the jerkiness still happens. </s>
<s> Is it an overheating problem with my CPU or RAM or HDD??? </s>
<s> I've been monitoring my video card temps with ATi Tool and it doesn't get past 45 degrees C with my ATI silencer cooler. </s>
<s> Just to let you know, my rig is: -Athlon X2 4200+ -Radeon X850XT -1 GB RAM -80GB 7200 RPM It's really annoying and I can't play San Andreas. </s>
<s> I'll try out some other games and let you know what happens. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help in advance. </s>
<s> It's not overheating; just running the game on two CPU's messes it up. </s>
<s> While you're running the game, open Task Manager, right click on the thread, and move it to CPU 0 or 1. </s>
<s> Thanks!!! </s>
<s> It's a little bit troublesome to set this each time I want to play my older games. </s>
<s> Will the next generation PC games support dual core? </s>
<s> (such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion???) </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> Drivers, BIOS are out of date. </s>
<s> What motherboard drivers did you use? </s>
<s> Also, after the motherboard drivers are updated (don't use any Microsoft button please) look up RECLOCK. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I gamed for about an hour with Nathan's suggestion of only using one of the CPU's. </s>
<s> Everything worked without a hitch. </s>
<s> I do have a problem with ATi's Driver. </s>
<s> It will never update (and I've tried many times). </s>
<s> I download them from ATi's Website ( https://support.ati.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=894&task=knowledge&folderID=27 ) I uninstall the previous drivers and CCC, restart, use Driver Cleaner Pro to remove all previous files, and restart again. </s>
<s> I then install the stuff from the above website. </s>
<s> The driver REMAINS the SAME, while the CCC is updated. </s>
<s> Just to clarify, the latest driver version is NOT 8.231.0.0, right??? </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> The BIOS seems to be working fine, though. </s>
<s> Thanks ahead of time! </s>
<s> There are multiple solutions to this issue. </s>
<s> I've cured this with BIOS, drivers, Reclock and more. </s>
<s> Sometimes I meet someone that insists there can be only one solution. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...There was only one solution to the problem. </s>
<s> I only offer other solutions that have worked for me. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Was that I never said that there was only one solution. </s>
<s> My idea just happened to fix this one, but I'm sure that there are other ones as well. </s>
<s> By the way, sorry if I PO'd you; I didn't mean to </s>
