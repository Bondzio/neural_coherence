Looking for powered USB drive [if one exists] and perhaps someone who has actually done this. Much thanks in advance for an informed opinion.

With the advance of virtualization I just thought it might be possible to virtualize applications to a USB drive. The two obvious barriers would be power and a physical connection to a router. Just wondering if there is anything like this in existence or being ontemplated. Ideally, I would would like to access some things without having a desktop on 24/7.
