My TDK 880N internal DVD burner has been acting flaky....gets hung up alot when I try to access it, or try to read data off a disc. Are there any tools commonly available that I could use to test the drive, before I take it out and replace it? TIA ss

Bob is right, it would cost you more for bench service than a good dual-layer dvd writer. and life goes on... Jack
