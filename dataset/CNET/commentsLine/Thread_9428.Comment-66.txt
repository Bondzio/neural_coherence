just like you,i have a 5 year old pentium iii 600mhz computer which still perform superbly.
over the years, i have upgraded the operating system from windows 98 -2000 then finally to xp.
along the way, i increase the memory to 512mb from 128, and adding a dvd dl .
although i'm not a game person but i do a lot of graphic designs such as autocad and professional engineering design which require 3d graphics, and i am perfectly happy with the performance.
as for waiting or buying a new computer now , if you decide to wait, you will wait for long time and might even be dissapointed in what may come out next.
if you fill like purchasing a new computer now,go for it because, no matter how much game you play , what's in the maket today will surely satistfy your desire.
i agreed with other person that surggested amd.
this is a better product than pentium.
