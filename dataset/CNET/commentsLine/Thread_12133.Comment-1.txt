i want a printer for low usage - inkjet or cheap color laser ($400) - low usage-about 10 pages a month - moderate quality- for childrens color pictures and quick printing photos - not high quality photos - i do those thru a service - cost of supplies &lt; $150 per year my problem has been that inkjet cartridges seem to dry out in 1 or 2 months, whether they are used or not.
this leads to a yearly cost of $300, much too high.
the cost per page in reviews never seem to consider this issue - will a color laser cartidge last more than a year?
- are there inkjets that will last 3 months?
