if so, you're fine.
for future reference, you should fill the same colored slots with the same type of ram to enable dual channel operation.
(so DIMM_A1 and DIMM_B1 should be filled with a matched pair.)
but so long as DIMM_A1+A2 have the same capacity as DIMM_B1+B2, dual channel will still be enabled.
since your ram has different timings, the slowest timings (5-5-5-15) will be selected.
you can try to manually set 4-4-4-15 timings, but the performance difference won't be noticeable except in benchmarks.
