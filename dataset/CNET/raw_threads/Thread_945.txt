However, I am concerned about distortion of images, e.g. a spherical shape will be &quot;falttened&quot; at the top and borrom ? People becomes &quot;fatter&quot;... Will there be problems with photo editing, e.g. Photoshop ? Comments, please. Thanks. christy

Not only must we install the graphics card driver but the MONITOR.INF file for that monitor in a lot of cases to inform the graphics card driver what video modes to offer the owner. This area is a little confusing at first. Bob

The new monitor works but the highest I'm offered in display settings is 1280x1024, even though my PC clearly recognisies the new monitor and I've installed its driver. I've been told that any graphics card should be able to handle a higher resolution with ease (my graphic card was bought 2003)so any ideas why I can't get the right res for the new monitor? Many thanks Hajr12

Info at: http://www.samsung.com/uk/products/monitors/lcd/designer/ls22pebsfvedc.asp Graphics card = S3 Graphics ProSavageDDR bought with PC (XP, Athlon 2400) almost four years ago. Driver is the latest available I believe = s3gnb.dll 6.14.10.0033, date 13/08/04. I'm sorry I'm not sure what monitor.inf is, but will supply if you kindly advise. Thanks for your swift response.

If you can't find the latest drivers for any of the items, call the place you got it and ask for them or ask for an exchange. Bob

Is it possible my current graphics card is too old/unsupported in terms of drivers to handle a widescreen monitor? Bottom line: is this a problem I could solve simply by buying a more up to date graphics card? Regards Hajr

At my college the techs in charge ain't the brightest bulb in the box, and as well as a load of other caveats (logging us all in as administrator accounts...) the widescreen displays are all defaulted at 1024x768...
