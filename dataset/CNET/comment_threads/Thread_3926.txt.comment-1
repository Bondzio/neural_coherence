I was given an external harddrive which I set up and put pics and files onto and I accessed it a couple of times and then left it for quite awhile.
When I tried to open it again I got no response.
The green light was on but can't find anything on my PC to show me where to open it.
I have Windows XP.
The Harddrive is an LACIE .
Not real savvy with this.
Can someone walk me through what I may be doing wrong as it is a nuisance not being able to access the info on it.
Thanks.
