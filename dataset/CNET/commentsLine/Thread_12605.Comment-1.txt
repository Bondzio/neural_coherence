i just talked to dell support, who i got my laptop through, and they said the biggest fastest drive i could upgrade to is 100gb and 7200 rpm.
although i'll probably follow these requirements, i was just wondering why the size of hard drives in laptops is limited.
anyone know?
what if i put in a 320gb hard drive?
would it work?
oh yeah, if i did upgrade my hard drive, is there some kind of program already installed (i have xp media center edition) that can make a complete transfer of all my data to the new drive or would i have to download a special program?
