I'm looking for recommendations.
I have a Dell Inspiron 5100 notebook with a 15&quot; screen.
To avoid eye strain I run at 800x600, which is severely inadequate for programming in Visual Studio.
I want to attach a 19&quot;-21&quot; LCD, one that is especially good with text.
I do almost nothing with graphics and video.
