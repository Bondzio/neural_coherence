<s> My desktop hard drive recently failed, and I need to purchase a new one. </s>
<s> Problem is, I've never replaced a hard drive before. </s>

<s> Will any SATA hard drive be compatible with my computer? </s>
<s> I can't afford something exceedingly expensive. </s>
<s> Space should be between 1-2 TB. </s>
<s> Would this work with my computer? </s>

<s> Hard drive 1 TB Size: 1 TB Interface: SATA Transfer rating: 3.0 Gb/sec Rotational Speed: 7200 RPM \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Those are your specs above. </s>
<s> They are for a SATA type drive. </s>
<s> You can install a 2-2Tb no problem, even a 3Tb one if you like as your OS is Win7, will readily accept it. </s>
<s> The HD link appears not to be an issue, will work. </s>
<s> However, I do suggest you update the bios so it can accept any changes that HP provides or deems so. </s>
<s> HP if you follow the instructions should provide info on OS re-install and HD replacement, please review it for model# or generic details. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I placed an order for the hard drive I linked to, the Caviar Green one. </s>
<s> It should be here within a few days. </s>
<s> I couldn't find exact instructions on how to replace my old hard drive with the new one, once I get it. </s>
<s> There are a lot of tutorials online but a point in the right direction would be great. </s>
<s> Hopefully it all works out when I get my HD. </s>
