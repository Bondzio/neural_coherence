my system, gateway solo 1450 laptop, already had windows xp home edition installed with the hard drive configured as one big partition.
i want to make it into three partitions.
is this not possible once windows is installed?
i have tried all the options included provided such as disk management, fdisk, diskpart, and format.
none of them work.
the restoration cd will not work because my current version has been updated.
currently i cannot boot from my external dvd/cd drive.
