<s> I dont know if anyone has ever encounter this problem, but I have a D-Link DI-614+ Wireless Router and for the past 3 to 5 month I have tried to configure the firewall to allow DCC transfers over IRC (I use mIRC) but to no avail, It seems that the router is not saving my configuration, I tried D-Link support site, but there nothing about this topics, I updated the firmware to the latest, resetting it and nothing. </s>
<s> I know the router is kind a old and is time for a upgrade but since everything else is running fine, I havent really seen the need to change. </s>
<s> If I wound upgrade I was thinking of buying a Linksys Wireless-G Broadband router or one of those new Pre-N, Anyways I also need to buy a new Wireless PCI card for my mothers desktop because the one that she has does not support WPA encryption. </s>
<s> Please give me your thoughts on my problem and if there anyway to fix it or if I should just upgrade to a new router. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance JuST RaFy http://www.claimid.com/rafy </s>

<s> Sorry about that, I all ready got a message from another mod. </s>
<s> But at lest he tried to help first and then critique me. </s>
<s> Take a look, Here the link: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6620-0.html?forumID=14&threadID=182017&messageID=1988795 Maybe you should learn, no offense, I hope. </s>

<s> When you infringe on the forum policies, such will happen. </s>
<s> I see no need to write more if you intend to follow da' rules. </s>
<s> When you supply a link, I expected it to pertain to the issue, instead it was some unrelated site. </s>
<s> As to the Dlink firewall, I have the dlink and it's &quot;odd&quot; about rules. </s>
<s> It took me more than a few minutes to figure out how it's rules worked. </s>
<s> Keep reading about it and see if it sinks in. </s>

<s> I have the same exact problem and the same exact model but even though Im trying to configure a different firewall I think the same solution applies here. </s>
<s> But chances could be that you already found out the solution. </s>
<s> I'm no expert at this type of stuff so you have to excuse me. </s>
<s> But when I entered in a firewall or firewalls, two common situations occured. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I only saw one entry even though I entered in mutiple ones. </s>
<s> When this happens, you have to play around with the up and down arrow-like symbols to the far right of your submitted firewall entry and click on apply. </s>
<s> When I did this, all my previous firewall entries showed up (while some of the pre-installed ones didnt show) in the listings, most likely indicating that the firewall entries that I submitted were in fact saved, but they did not show for some reason. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I only saw the three pre-installed firewall entries and none of the new ones I entered. </s>
<s> When this happened, I entered a bogus firewall (selecting the disabled option in hopes of not altering my current settings), applied it, and my new entries showed up (again, some of the pre-installed ones did not show as a result). </s>
<s> Its terribly confusing though, and to tell you the truth, following the steps mentioned above may result in different outcomes. </s>
<s> It took me two hours to get to this point and although I can see my new entries, some of the pre-installed ones are not apparent; I believe they are there though since my internet is running fine. </s>
<s> My dad helped me, and while we were trying to get it to worked, the internet stopped working. </s>
<s> I dont know exactly why this worked, but my dad clicked on wireless on the home page then clicked WEP enabled and it worked. </s>
<s> It worked but don't ask me why. </s>
<s> I just thought that maybe that might help. </s>
<s> If you mess up, want to start over from the standard settings, or whatever, just reset your router using the button on the back and start from scratch. </s>
<s> By the way, I did not do any updates or anything like that. </s>
<s> Still, honestly I don't know why they make it so difficult. </s>
<s> I signed up here just to help someone else because this is so difficult. </s>
<s> Thanks Gill Bates, thanks for taking the time to sign up and answer my question that was very thoughtful of you. </s>
<s> I must say, while I was messing around with the firewall setting I get the same reactions as you do, when talking about the arrows and the disappearing pre-install entries. </s>
<s> But now that I think about it and read what you said about how in WEP worked, I remember that when I used to use WEP the IRC DCC firewall setting worked, but now using WPA they dont worked. </s>
<s> So what I did when I read your entry was change back to WEP and It didnt work neither. </s>
<s> Now Im beginning to think that I do need a new wireless router since mine may be broken, meaning that you said you have never updated your Firmware and I have updated my firmware twice, once in 2004 and a couple of month back this year. </s>
<s> What really bothers me is that there no documentation on the D-Link support site about this topic and that whats makes it hard to figure out the problem. </s>
<s> Anyhow thanks again for your help, at lest Im not alone with this problem, I was beginning to think I was. </s>
<s> Again thanks for taking the time to reply my question. </s>
<s> Hope to see you around. </s>
<s> JuST RaFy </s>
<s> No problem, good luck. </s>
