I have a new Ambit modem # U10C018 and we are trying to connect to a Netgear Router VPN824.I cannot connect to the internet through the router.Our last modem was a Motorola and we had the Netgear connected to it and it worked fine.
I have called Charter(the modem is from them) and they indicate that the router is the problem.I also called Netgear they worked with me and the router is fine.I am lost any help would be appericated..
Thanks...
