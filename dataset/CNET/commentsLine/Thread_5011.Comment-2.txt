cd/dvd drive: plextor px-810sa $99.48 -i don't write dvds.
i just wanted to be able to put a game in and play.
a cheaper alternative more suited to my needs would be welcome.
case: raidmax katana atx-729wb black steel.
full tower.
$95.98 -i went with a large tower to hold all the stuff in this list.
i'd heard there were particular problems fitting it all into a mid-size.
psu: nspiregear 58655.
850w unit.
$178 -i figured this system would draw roughly 650ish watts.
i wanted to overshoot by roughly 200 just in case.
as another aside, nspire is made by texas instruments, and i loved my ti-82 to death.
literally.
keyboard: logitech g15 $68.99 -dunno.
heard it was good.
macros are are always welcome.
mouse: logitech g7 $56 -sometimes i get a fixation on fps.
it usually ends poorly.
altogether, this should run between $2391.37 - $2460.03, depending on the motherboard.
i've got quite a few concerns before i take the plunge, but i'd like outside opinion before finalizing any decisions.
