1.1.1	I recently had a system start wiping out keyboards ( sure there 's a problem that requires euthanasia ) .	St
1.1.2	I decided the best bet was to swap the hard drive into another old system to get back up and running ASAP .	St
1.1.3	The first time I started up with the two drives in the second unit , I got the warning the CMOS battery was critically low .	St
1.1.4	I worked on the system getting everything right and shut down .	St
1.1.5	I added more RAM ( have since removed the extra RAM after the problem ) but now I ca n't get the second system even to POST .	St
1.1.6	I removed everything back to its original setup , changed the CMOS battery for a brand new one and still nothing .	St
1.1.7	I am at a loss and am limited to what I have started as fixes .	St
1.1.8	Any help ?	Ques
1.2.1	The additional RAM must have messed with original , swapped the RAM out , puter works with smiles .	St
