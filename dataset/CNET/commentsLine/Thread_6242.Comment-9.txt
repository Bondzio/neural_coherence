thanks for looking for that on-line anti-virus checker.
now i know there isn't one.
i guess i'll have to buy something to make sure i haven't already contracted something -- a distinct possibility because i'm frequently told i need a plug-in or an updated plug-in to run this or that; we are remodeling and run videos for demos, etc.
i wouldn't have a clue if what i'm downloading is valid or evil.
yes, we did try to access the site with the mac i.e.
and weren't able to get in.
after talking with the computer department we understand that for security reasons they control very closely who/what can access their site.
thanks very much for your support.
we really appreciate it.
