Have the crossover cable. The desktop will not register a domain or workgroup. Network setup goes to completion but I can't make or join any workgroups. On the network id section, it says:&quot;you must install networking before you can change this computer's domain membership&quot;. The member section is greyed out on the desktop but it's fully accessible on the laptop (the other comp). I have done the static ip addy and network set up disks in both directions with and with out firewall. Nothing works. Does anyone have good instructions on how to do this? It's supposed to be easy but the desktop refuses to work. I have 2 network cards on the desktop that are fully updated: sis900 and realtek rtl8139. I have disabled, disconnected 1 or the other. The networking just won't work. I've lost sleep for the past week on this problem. Help Thanks

XP pro says its on the workgroup I created but it wont recognize the workgroup. In my network places when I try to view network computers it just gives me a &quot;ding&quot;. Doesn't matter if the firewall is on or off or if the ip is fixed or auto. The workgroup doesn't show up. Usually I can see atleast my own comp on the network, nothing here.

If you see &quot;domain&quot; then your install is improper. Since you have no DHCP server you'll have to assign IP addresses manually. Tell me what you used so the picture of the setup is complete. Also you need to have accounts on both machines and directories shared. Example. Your account is called 'sam'. 'sam' must have an account on both machines with same password please. Bob

With or without a server, the workgroup set up just doesn't work. I hauled the thing to the office and I can get to the internet through the network but again I can't join or create any workgroups. At home, I manually set the ip as 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.3 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 sometimes I leave the bottom empty and i've tried all sorts of combos on the ip numbers, close numbers or far apart. Even without the cable plugged in, I can't set up a workgroup, something I can do with the laptop.

I didn't read how you dealt with accounts and shares so that's an open item. Also you can try the command line and this command if you feel you have the accounts and shares proper. NET VIEW Bob

Sorry for the trouble and thanks for the help. You wouldn't happen to know anything about sharing permissions over a network would you? I'm sharing stuff over a large dispersed network that I don't want just anyone to use but I don't know how to set the permissions for another computer over the network. Thanks

We have that Guest account which we rarely enable but that allows everyone to gain access. And the word &quot;Anyone&quot; is anyone with an account, not &quot;everyone&quot; which would be those without an account. &quot;but I don't know how to set the permissions for another computer over the network.&quot; In short, Windows doesn't do this! But we could add it in by installing OpenSSH so one could stelnet into said 'server' and use the various net and other command line tools to adjust users and more. Bob
