Honestly when it comes to quality, price is pretty much the factor of what you get.
Also, it should state its &quot;shielded properties&quot;.
Further, even with a single cable of hi-quality build and since you seem able to de-attach it, makes that an issue as well, because the fact you have a build-in break at the monitor.
Impedance is more introduced at all breaks in the cable length.
In other words, all connections imply a break, though complete with proper setup, depends on that being sound.
You will notice the monitor's video cable is roughly 3-4ft(1M) long.
If you find another single cable, I think the most it will be is 3M(8-9ft) long and its a hit-or-miss it will work, thus try only on 1 PC setup for now.
You can google away for ideas but I suggest contact the monitor makers and see if they offer an optional cable.
