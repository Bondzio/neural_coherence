<s> Ok I just bought RAM, but it's two different types of RAM. </s>
<s> Anyways I made a pic of how I have it setup, so I was wondering is everything setup properly and will I get the best performance from how it is now? </s>
<s> I have Vista Ultimate 64 if that matters. </s>

<s> A link to the motherboard's manual would fill in a lot of blanks. </s>
<s> It's an ASUS P5N32-SLI mobo </s>
<s> A link to the motherboard manual would be best. </s>
<s> You can get the right manual so there is no doubt. </s>
<s> if so, you're fine. </s>
<s> for future reference, you should fill the same colored slots with the same type of ram to enable dual channel operation. </s>
<s> (so DIMM_A1 and DIMM_B1 should be filled with a matched pair.) </s>
<s> but so long as DIMM_A1+A2 have the same capacity as DIMM_B1+B2, dual channel will still be enabled. </s>
<s> since your ram has different timings, the slowest timings (5-5-5-15) will be selected. </s>
<s> you can try to manually set 4-4-4-15 timings, but the performance difference won't be noticeable except in benchmarks. </s>
<s> It appears to be running. </s>
<s> BUT, you have the similar(alike) ram together(next to each other) and that's NOT the way DDR2 mode was intended. </s>
<s> You already note the colored slots. </s>
<s> While it be working OK, to address your question, for the best performance all ram should be alike of same abilities, thus the same timing. </s>
<s> I would think the ram auto-configured to the lowest setting and isn't in DDR2 mode -OR- if set in DDR2 its not happy, possible cause for concern if pushed. </s>
<s> If you can replace the ram slower ram to the higher ram, then that will be a better fit. </s>
<s> But, for now, if it works you'll be advised of this area of concern. </s>
