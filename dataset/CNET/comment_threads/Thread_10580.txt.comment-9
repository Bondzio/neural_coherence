I had the same issues.
I found that I just had to push the eSATA cable in harder into the drive and tada!
it worked.
I feel extremely stupid after this experience.
I was checking my drivers, BIOS, connections to the MB, swapping known good connections, trying different cables.... stupid that it was that simple.
