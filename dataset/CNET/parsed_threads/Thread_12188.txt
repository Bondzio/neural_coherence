<s> Hi, Just got a actionTec gateway dsl router. </s>
<s> Router to PC via USB Network cable from Router to Apple Air Port Express Everything as far as I know is working as it should with the router, all lights are on and flashing nicely. </s>
<s> Connecting via the Mac I have no problems whats so ever, all lights are fine together with net connection. </s>
<s> But on my PC (Win XP SP2) after a reboot I can get say 10 minutes if that before i lose all connnectivity, I can't even access the router admin from the browser, all lights on the router are fine. </s>
<s> So for some reason my PC is losing the connection to the router, this is under USB, i tried via the network card as well and the same happens. </s>
<s> This did happen before i added Mac to router. </s>
<s> I've run just about all the spy/adware apps I can find and still its happening. </s>
<s> I did think it might be the ISP but then why wouldn't the Mac drop off as well. </s>
<s> Any one heard of this before or know how to fix it? </s>
<s> Cheers Death = $Mill </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Unlike the Mac, the PC is fun as you find all the drivers for motherboard, network card that Microsoft does not supply. </s>
<s> DO NOT use Microsoft as a source for the drivers. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> There can be a power save setting in the USB and network card. </s>
<s> Set it to &quot;disable.&quot; In closing, I only guide and never supply step by step instructions. </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> You should use the airport express assistant, and configured it. </s>
<s> As far as I know Airport express use 10.xxx.xxx.xxx while the router use 192.xxx.xxx.xxx read the manual... </s>
<s> I use manual IP configuration and disable the DHCP... let the router take care of it. </s>
