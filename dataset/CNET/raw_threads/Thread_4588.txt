My system specs are: Asus motherboard P3 @ 700mhz 512mb pc133 RAM Asus Sound Card Samsung cdr/w dvd rom drive BFG Tech 256mb 8x agp asylum edition video card Windows XP Pro The problem is when i go to play some games it freezes when it switches to fullscreen mode. This only happens on most of my games, i have newest video card drivers. Also have newest version of direct x, my agp slot is 2x but the video card is compatible to that. I thought it might be power supply but how do i know for sure? Thanks for the help
