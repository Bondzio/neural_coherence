<s> What would make several unrelated programs try to access the IP used by my router: CCleaner, MS Word, Windows Media Player, and Java Platform SE. </s>
<s> My router is the D-Link model DIR-655 gigabit &quot;draft N.&quot; I've been using it for a month without a single hiccup. </s>
<s> However, in the past week, my firewall (ZoneAlarm) has been showing me occasional requests by the programs I mentioned to access my router's IP, 192.168.0.1. </s>
<s> I've been replying to the ZoneAlarm access requests with one-time denials and my systems and these programs seem to be functioning just fine, as best as I can tell. </s>
<s> At first I didn't pay much attention to these access requests. </s>
<s> But since these requests have continued to pop-up periodically (perhaps once or twice each day), I decided to note which programs were trying to do this because this behavior seems odd to me; however, note that I'm no networking guru. </s>
<s> Does anyone know whether this behavior is normal? </s>
<s> If it is normal, can you please offer a sentence or two to explain? </s>
<s> And if this behavior is not normal, do you have a clue as to why these programs want to access my router? </s>
<s> By the way, a login password for the router has been assigned. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> &quot;CCleaner, MS Word, Windows Media Player, and Java Platform SE.&quot; ALL of these check for updates when they run. </s>
<s> That's not something to be alarmed about. </s>
