The swire is a 1701HG.
I'm familiar with how networks generally work.
However, in this case I only have one wireless modem, one wireless router, and one wireless network card.
I can only connect to the modem with the wireless card.
So my question is is it more worth it to get the two computers networked or to just buy another wireless card for it?
