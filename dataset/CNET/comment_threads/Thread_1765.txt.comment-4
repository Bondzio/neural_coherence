c. Checked the firewall exceptions list on both units saw no reference to MS networking would it be listed as something else?
I can't be more specific without knowing which firewall you are using.
d. Tried to track down where one changes USB settings did not find anything where do I find this?
Try this -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=DISABLE+USB+POWER+SAVING Just so you know, some just give up and try out a really nice piece of software called NETWORK MAGIC.
It does this all for us without having to know it all.
