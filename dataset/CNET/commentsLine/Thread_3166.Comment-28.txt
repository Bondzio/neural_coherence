i have had three (3) different brands of external harddrives go bad on me.
they still go on.
spin.
but, i could not get the data off of them.
i was running windows xp.
the brands were: que, w.d.
+ maxtor.
i found out that windows xp does not unmount the external usb drives by itself.
after a while it does something to the drive.
windows vista has a automatic dismount for external or usb drives.
i also have a wd portable drive that just plugs into the usb port with no electrical cords.
it is great.
i have it in my duffle bag, it takes a beating and still works.
