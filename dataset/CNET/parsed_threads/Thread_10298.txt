<s> Moved to a new place some weeks ago and didn't bother reconnecting the my home built computer. </s>
<s> Decided to replace my seasonic 550w power supply with a new 750w Antec EA-750 power supply. </s>
<s> I then reconnected my Viewsonic VX2025wm monitor and turned on the computer and got the dreaded &quot;no signal&quot; on the monitor. </s>
<s> Not only that, but my GTX 260 graphics card fan is really loud for some reason. </s>
<s> I tried a different monitor, a VX2433wm, on the computer and still got no signal on either of the DVI ports on the GTX 260. </s>
<s> I connected the VX2025wm monitor on my parents' Dell computer and it worked. </s>
<s> Could the new power supply have damaged my video card? </s>
<s> I have no idea whats going on! </s>
<s> Or a cable is touching the fan. </s>
<s> Replacing a PSU is no longer trivial. </s>
<s> We have possible connections for the video, the ATX12V connection and what else? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The computer was working just fine before I changed the power supply. </s>
<s> I changed the power supply back to the Seasonic 550w PSU and it still showed &quot;no signal&quot;. </s>
<s> Could you clarify or simplify your answer? </s>
<s> You said a cable is touching the fan? </s>
<s> I checked and there aren't any cables touching the graphics card fan... </s>
<s> The power supply is also connected to a Seagate 5400 RPM hard drive and a Samsung 7200 RPM hard drive. </s>
<s> For testing purposes, I only connected the PSU to the parts I needed to turn on the computer and turn down the GPU fan because it was too loud, which was when I encountered the &quot;no signal&quot; problem. </s>
<s> I can not see your computer but the symptoms point to something touching the fan. </s>
<s> BUT YOU DID GIVE UP A GREAT CLUE. </s>
<s> GPUs do not take kindly to heat. </s>
<s> There are few cards that let you set the speed on those. </s>
<s> I wonder if it died? </s>
<s> Also your comment about not hooking it all up points to a possible oversight. </s>
<s> Again, I offered the most common based on too many machines repaired over the years. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I may have forced the computer to turn on or off too many times by pressing the switch on the PSU itself. </s>
<s> I wanted to test my new PSU but didn't bother connecting my monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc... </s>
<s> The GPU was working perfectly prior to changing the PSU. </s>
<s> I was using a program from EVGA that allowed you to change the fan speed. </s>
<s> It was running at 50 degrees celsius at most. </s>
<s> It doesn't matter. </s>
<s> You now get to figure out what's gone wrong. </s>
<s> How about that old extra mounting stud under the motherboard problem? </s>
<s> Folk are always getting bit by that and only the new builders will reply &quot;it worked fine before.&quot; I always check that stuff out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What kind of problem would the mounting stud cause? </s>
<s> I might switch my GPU and see how that goes. </s>
<s> Some one puts a stud in where it doesn't belong. </s>
<s> The new builders tend to think since it worked before &quot;it can't be that.&quot; That sort of thinking makes my friends in repair some easy income. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Took out the video card, and plugged in the integrated video card adapter into my ASUS M3N78 pro motherboard. </s>
<s> I managed to get past the startup screen. </s>
<s> The problem now is that when I get to the Vista loading screen, the bars manage to move two times before the screen freezes, then I see a BSOD flash for an instant and the screen goes to black </s>
<s> But I was talking of checking for that stray mounting post. </s>
<s> BUT THIS SOUNDS LIKE PROGRESS! </s>
<s> &quot; no signal on monitor after changing power supply&quot; to Windows at least starting. </s>
<s> As the machine crashes it can corrupt the OS. </s>
<s> Maybe the next step is to slip in some new blank HDD and install Windows on that to see if the machine is OK? </s>
