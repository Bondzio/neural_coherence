if you've got an am2 socket mobo and use ddr2 ram, then you can go from 2.2ghz to a 3.0ghz x2 6000+ for $155 and go to 3GB ram for about $35.
photoshop makes use of a scratch disk if you edit large (or many) files.
you can speed up photoshop by adding a second harddrive and using it as the scratch disk (move the windows pagefile and temp folders to it also).
assuming your pc uses sata drives, a fast 500gb drive is only $105 .
this would be a $295 upgrade that would give you a big boost in overall performance and take only 30 minutes or so.
