<s> Hi All, I just installed a Nvidia 5600FX card into my K7N420 Pro motherboard (nVIDIA nForce 420D Chipset) and get spontaneous monitor shutdowns (eg the 19&quot; NEC Multisync 95 monitor goes into 'standby mode' LED goes from green to orange). </s>
<s> There does not seem to be any pattern to these episodes, sometimes it happens imediately after I boot WIN XP PRO, othertimes I can play 5 minutes of Battlefield 1942 or another game before it happens, and sometimes I can use windows for over an hour. </s>
<s> When the monitor shuts down the computer does not respond (eg to Ctrl-alt-del and the HDD does not respond to pushing the windows button although sometimes the game music will continue). </s>
<s> Occasionally the computer will reboot. </s>
<s> Up till now I have been using onboard video with no problems. </s>
<s> I have tried reinstalling Windows XP PRO, updating all relevant drivers (i.e. </s>
<s> Motherboard chipset, Video Card, Monitor) to no avail. </s>
<s> I have 3 256 DDR RAM sticks in the DIMMS, 385 WATT power supply. </s>
<s> The card has also run ok in other machines. </s>
<s> Your help is apprechiated. </s>

<s> After reading another string I should add that I have turned off the onboard video in the Bios. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I recently purchased an FX5900 XT. </s>
<s> The drivers disk was cracked, I figured, no big deal, being an NVidia based card, I'll just install the latest drivers that I keep in my drivers archives. </s>
<s> Strangely, I got that &quot;unsigned driver&quot; message. </s>
<s> Went to Chaintech, the maker of the card, and the latest driver version posted was ver. </s>
<s> 60.85. </s>
<s> After some googling, I found some other people with the same prob. </s>
<s> Found the 60.85 drivers, and I was good to go. </s>
<s> Did you happen to have an ATI card before the new one? </s>
<s> Could be some old drivers leftover. </s>
<s> Maybe a trip into safe mode&gt;Device manager, then remove ALL entries of video adapters, then upon normal reboot, install the NVidia drivers. </s>
<s> Does this card require power? </s>
<s> On the side of my card there's a molex for a power supply. </s>
<s> All I can think of, good luck. </s>
<s> Have you tried the Videocard in another system? </s>
<s> See if it happens there too Update to the latest drivers, i believe its at 61.77 at this point in time, also make sure DirectX is up to date Good Luck </s>
<s> Nvidia video cards come packaged with an Installation CD, did you install your video card using the CD? </s>
<s> Check Microsoft for updates, they have a patch for Nvidia video cards. </s>
<s> SOme games are not compatible with specific models of video cards. </s>
<s> Sometimes it helps to read the readme.txt together with the game, it is there for a purpose. </s>
