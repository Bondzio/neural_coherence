<s> I currently have a Deskjet 5552 printer bought new, and I have only replaced the black cartridge once, even though it is used everyday. </s>
<s> The 2nd cartridge has now got empty and I have refilled it with Jet Tec ink, which I have used for many years, but not on this printer. </s>
<s> But it will not work! </s>
<s> I have been through the cleaning and priming process 5 times now and still no black. </s>
<s> Colour is fine. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on how to convince it that it does have ink!!! </s>

<s> Try an OEM cartridge, if it doesn't work with the mfg original type, you may have an issue, likely wrong ink used in refill. </s>
