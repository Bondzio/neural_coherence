1.1.1	The radeon 9800 xt cranks out about 46 fps on doom 3.	St
1.1.2	Is it worth buying the 9800 xt, or would the performance from the 9800 PRO version sufficient enough to play doom 3?	St
1.1.3	Because vendors are selling the XT version for twice as much as the PRO version.	St
1.2.1	your oersonal satisfaction with the games performance is the key parameter in the cost effectiveness equation.	St
1.2.2	Most gamers brag about the FPS they get and if someone beats them they immediately scrap their video card and get the latest and the greatest.	St
1.2.3	This from someone that has never played a game on a computer, so not very meaningful.	St
1.2.4	LOL	St
1.3.1	REad the readme.txt file included in the PC game CD.	St
1.3.2	Therein, you can find some comments and tips about the use of various video cards when playing the game as well as compatibility issues (if there exists).	St
1.3.3	Some games are selective of video cards like the compatibility issues of Nvidia and Voodoo cards to some games.	St
1.3.4	Read it, I am sorry, I don't have that kind of game.	St
1.3.5	It will also give you (the readme.txt) perhaps the best setting to make, and in some instances, the best type and brand of video card to opt for.	St
1.3.6	Good-luck.	St
1.4.1	you may want to spend a little extra so you dont have to upgrade in say a year or so, so long as the rest of your system wont have to be upgraded to run games as well	St
1.5.1	I think you need to take into consideration what your system is now.	St
1.5.2	Case in point: my own XP pro, 2000+ Athlon (1.67 Ghz), 512 ddr ram @ 266 front side bus.	St
1.5.3	Put in an FX5900 XT card.	St
1.5.4	Plays Far Cry a little bit better at medium and low resolutions w/AA turned off.	St
1.5.5	My daughter's recently upgraded system: P4 2.8 Ghz Celeron-D, 512 DDR ram @ 533 Mhz FSB.	St
1.5.6	Her system plays almost equally as well with a ti4200 vid card.	St
1.5.7	Point is, I have a better videcard, but there's obviously a bottleneck caused by my slower cpu and FSB.	St
1.5.8	Check your system specs before you spend a lot of money on a vid card they may not meet your expectations if your system isn't up to snuff.	St
1.5.9	Even if your system is up to snuff, I have a persoanl bias against ATI boards.	St
1.5.10	I've heard more stories about the catalyst drivers hosing people's systems, or the cards not working in a Windows box.	St
1.5.11	But that's my bias and what I've heard from friends.	St
1.5.12	Using a high-end card on a low end system is like putting premium gasoline in a motor-scooter.	St
1.5.13	You'd more than likely be wasting money.	St
1.6.1	Even if you bought the best video card out there...ultimatly the framerate is regulated by the game itself.	St
1.6.2	it will only go so fast and that is it...so game mfg's recommend certain cards...probably have some deal going with card mfg's....i havent found any games that are not compatible with my nvidia 5200..just make sure that you have a big enough card to run the games you want.... (example-a 32mb card will play MS flight 4...kinda..most of the game isnt rendered just by lack of memory).	St
1.6.3	my card is a 256mb gainward nvidia card that i paid 80 bucks for new and works with what ever i throw at it.	St
1.6.4	i dont think i will out grow that card for a long time to come...good luck and i hope it helped	St
1.7.1	DONT U DO THAT !!	St
1.7.2	Even though the performance of the XT is better than the PRO (obviously.....y wud they bother 2 give it a diff name ??)	St
1.7.3	its not bad ( 100 mhz higher clock speed , shaders improved etc) its like , if the price was lesser and u dont own any card , u might wanna consider buyin it... i say u shud stay with da PRO for like two years untill another game comes out and ur card is on the minimum requirments list !!	St
1.7.4	(just kiddin) just stick around with the PRO card - its awesum (wish i owned it !!	St
1.7.5	i have a 9600 XT but im still very happy !)	St
1.8.1	DONT U DO THAT !!	St
1.8.2	Even though the performance of the XT is better than the PRO (obviously.....y wud they bother 2 give it a diff name ??)	St
1.8.3	its not bad its like , if the price was lesser and u dont own any card , u might wanna consider buyin it... i say u shud stay with da PRO for like two years untill another game comes out and ur card is on the minimum requirments list !!	St
1.8.4	(just kiddin) just stick around with the PRO card - its awesum (wish i owned it !!	St
1.8.5	i have a 9600 XT but im still very happy !)	St
