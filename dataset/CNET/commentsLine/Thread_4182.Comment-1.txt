my friend's pendrive isn't work when he puts in into the usb slot on his pc although the pendrive's logo is shown in 'my computer'.
when he double-click on the pendrive logo,a message box bounced n it says that 'the pendrive is not formatted' he has tried several methods to open his pendrive but still failure.there are some important files in the pendrive n my friend would like to 'rescue' his pendrive without format it.
any method can solve it?
thanks!
