i am getting the runaround from hp on obtaining the vista upgrade they promised me.
instead of automatically sending you the upgrade when ready, they force you to prove yourself to a 3rd party order fulfillment house which is inept and incompetent.
i wouldn't trust them now with the purchase of an ink cartridge!
once you get your pc home you'll have to deal with support from a call center in india, which is staffed by idiots reading from a script.
do not buy an hp unless you are a raving masochist!!!!!!!!!!!!
