1.1.1	Hi guys , I just picked up a new custom made computer : An Amd Athlon 3400 , ( 128 MB ) Radeon 9800 pro , 1024 MB of Ram and a Seagate 120 Gigabyte Hardrive .	St
1.1.2	Now those are my specs here 's where the trouble is ; I just got this computer back yesterday from my fathers friend whos a pro at building custom computers and never makes mistakes .	St
1.1.3	When I rebooted the computer for the first time and windows xp loaded for the second time I started to get artifacts all over every icon and also on random messages from windows that pop up ( even the user icons when you log onto windows xp ) .	St
1.1.4	I fixed that problem because supposedly my card ca n't handle windows xp on the highest hardware acceleration ( which is the default setting ) .	St
1.1.5	But now I 'm getting this problem in every game I play ; it 's not just a few artifact glitches popping up here and there there all over the screen almost like a checkerboard pattern ...	St
1.1.6	The games I 've played so far are Mafia and Doom 3 and they both look the same .	St
1.1.7	Should I return my card ?	Ques
1.1.8	Are there any settings I can change ?	Ques
1.1.9	P.S .	St
1.1.10	My brother has the EXACT same computer up to the case and he is having no problems at all ...	St
1.2.1	Your post did n't list a power supply .	St
1.2.2	At that parts list , a 450 or higher wattage supply would be my pick , but your post writes & quot ; get artifacts all over every icon and also on random messages from windows that pop up ( even the user icons when you log onto windows xp ) .	St
1.2.3	I fixed that problem because supposedly my card ca n't handle windows xp on the highest hardware acceleration & quot ; .	St
1.2.4	When I see this , the case cover comes off and I point a fan at the machine to see if it 's heat .	St
1.2.5	Many do n't design heat management into their design .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Keywords , & quot ; just got this computer back yesterday from my fathers friend whos a pro at building custom computers and never makes mistakes. & quot ; Do n't want to say your system builder made a mistake , but if all the parts are new ( my card ca n't handle windows XP ) then something is wrong and the builder should correct issue .
