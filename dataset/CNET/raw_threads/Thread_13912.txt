I have been researching for at least 2 weeks now on which graphics card i want to get and just when i think i made up my mind i find a new card. The more i research the more confused i get. Ive looked at Toms Hardware, read people reviews on Newegg, everything... Im so confused! I plan on playing F.E.A.R. Oblivion and Dark Messiah with settings on high (at least medium). What should i be looking for (core speed, memory speed, more memory, i have no idea)? Here are a few cards i have been looking at- - 6600 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814133155 - 7600 GT http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130017 - 7900 GS http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130056 - 8600 GT http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130085 - 8600 GTS http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130084 My system configuration: Gateway GT5220- -1 gb ram -250 gb hd -2.0 ghz dual core -XP Media Center -nVidia 6150 LE 256 mb(intergrated) -17in Gateway LCD -Altec 2.1 Speakers -Canon Color Printer If you have any other ideas on what card i should get my budget is about $140 and i have 2 available PCI slots and 1 PCI express slot open (no agp) and i dont want an ATI.

The 7600 cards are good cards and have gotten good reviews, but if you buy the 7600 expecting to be able to play games like Oblivion and Dark Messiah at high (or even mid-high) settings at a reasonable frame rate, you're going to be dissapointed. It just doesn't have the horsepower. If you're willing to stretch your budget a few bucks you should be able to snag a 7900 based card at around $160 which will get you a pretty good jump in performance. The second thing...why don't you want an ATI? Their last generation of cards were great performers and you can get them now for very reasonable prices. The 1950pro cards provide a great bang for the buck and you should be able to get them cheaper than the Nvidia 7900 cards.
