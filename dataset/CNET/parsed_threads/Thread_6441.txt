<s> What happens if I put PC3200 RAM with super low timings (2-2-2-5 or such) into a board and CPU that runs with PC2700? </s>
<s> Now what happens if I increase the FSB of the CPU with the PC3200 installed? </s>
<s> CPU is AMD Thoroughbred 2600+ @ 2.13MHz </s>
<s> Either the pc3200 won't work, because the board doesn't support, or the pc3200 will be underclocked to 333Mhz PC2700. </s>
<s> As for increasing the fsb, this isn't an athlon 64, so increasing will be just that a increase in fsb. </s>
<s> PC 2700??? </s>
<s> If so the PC 3200 should simply run at the speed of the PC2700. </s>
<s> As to the memory timing, how is the timing set in the BIOS??? </s>
<s> bY SPD, or can you set the CAS [CL] etc? </s>
<s> Is the mobo an overclockers type?? </s>
<s> if so you may be able to increase the Memory clock speed 1 MHz at a time to see how fast it will run. </s>
<s> How can you increase the FSB other than by increasing the memory clock?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> using CPUID or Speedfan I can increase the FSB (which does increase the memory clock), but the mem is OEM in my HP (thus no BIOS options) and so the RAM is pretty low quality, I can't increase the FSB past 138 (from 133) without it becoming unstable. </s>
<s> My reasoning was, if I have better ram, then I could increase the FSB (with these programs) more because the RAM will allow me to go higher and be stable. </s>
<s> I was able to push it to 143MHz, but anything that cause above a 25% CPU usage would blue screen the comp, albeit, I pushed the 2130 to 2300 or so. </s>
<s> I would like to get to 2600 stablely if I could, and I think the only way I can do this is with better ram. </s>
<s> Lowering the multiplier from x16 won't work, or I haven't found a program that will actually let me do it. </s>
