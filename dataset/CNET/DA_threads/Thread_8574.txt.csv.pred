1.1.1	I have an old Dell Dimension 4300S PC ( Windows XP ) that needs to have the video card replaced .	St
1.1.2	It is an ATI # 1027311302 ( Rage 128 Ultra Video Card , a 16mb AGP ( found this searching the part # ) .	St
1.1.3	While I know this is a very old computer , it is part of a business network of computers that need absolutely no bells or whistles at all .	St
1.1.4	I would like to find a simple video card that will replace the old one - and would like to buy a new one from a reputable seller vs. buying something refurbished from a company I do n't know .	St
1.1.5	Cross referencing on the net seems to be difficult - I 'm sure due to the age of the card but are there still & quot ; simple & quot ; video cards available ?	Ques
1.1.6	If so , can you point me in the right direction ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thank you - Carash123	St
1.2.1	Given the case form factor ... a low profile model might be a smart choice too .	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Thanks ! !	St

1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I 'm sorry to inform you , but older laptops are almost impossible to find replacement video hardware for .	St
1.5.2	AGP is old and only a select few even make them any more and those are all for desktops .	St
1.5.3	I 'm not sure about your specific laptop but the graphics are more than likely atached to the mother board and you would not be able to replace it any way , when you looked up the part number it gave you the specs for an agp gard because they use the same chipset but I doubt that you have an actual agp slot inside .	St
1.5.4	Again this is atrue for 90 % of laptops the highend gaming ones do have replaceable cards but there twice as expensive as there desktop counterparts .	St
1.6.1	Sorry I read the post on low profile and thought this was for a laptop .	St
1.6.2	Any of these cards should work fine .	St
1.6.3	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814139165 http : //www.google.com/products/catalog ? hl=en & q=agp+4x+video+card & cid=11369288243160600623 & sa=title # p http : //www.google.com/products/catalog ? hl=en & q=agp+4x+video+card & cid=6554480941484046086 & sa=title # p I would suggest either of these also .	St
1.6.4	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814161152 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814150107 The original card was an ATI so you might want to stick with them because of the drivers , if you do pick the Nvidia card make sure you delete all the old drivers .	Sug
