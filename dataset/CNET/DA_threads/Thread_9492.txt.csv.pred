1.2.1	Turn off firewalls on both .	St
1.2.2	Make sure both have same workgroup name .	St
1.2.3	Share at least one folder on each PC .	St
1.2.4	This should make the two Pcs see each other on the network .	St
1.2.5	It could take up to 45 minutes for them to work .	St
1.2.6	Or they may have problems seeing each other anyway .	St
1.2.7	You can & quot ; force & quot ; one to see the other if needed , by using the address bar in Windows Explorer .	St
1.2.8	Just type the path needed .	St
1.2.9	If computer1 is named frontroom then type in the address bar \\frontroom\ and press ENTER .	St
1.2.10	If the PC is on the network and is not blocked by a firewall , shared folders will show up , even if you ca n't browse to them .	St
