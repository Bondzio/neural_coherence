i believe it will be the way of the future - i am using this technology now in a small way.
but my concern is the longevity of flash devices.
they used to have a lifespan of something like 10,000 writes.
if this is still the case then i doubt they will preplace the hard drives.
do any flash mfgs.
guarantee a lifespan on their products?
