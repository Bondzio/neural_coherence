This is the product I have: SanDisk 4GB Micro SDHC Flash Card (picture here: http://www.anrdoezrs.net/40111lnwtnvACDKJIEEACBFFBJKI?sid=cnetforum&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FProduct.aspx%3FItem%3DN82E16820171275%26nm_mc%3DAFC-C8Junction%26cm_mmc%3DAFC-C8Junction-_-Memory%2B%28Flash%2BMemory%29-_-SanDisk-_-20171275&cjsku=N82E16820171275 ) and its SD Adapter (picture here: http://www.kqzyfj.com/be100ft1zt0GIJQPOKKGIHMKNIKP?sid=cnetforum&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accessorygeeks.com%2Fsdhighend-memory-card-2g.html&cjsku=MC-TS2G . When I insert the 4GB Micro SDHC into my mobile phone, it can read and write data. When I insert the 4GB Micro SDHC into its SD Adapter, and then into my Lenovo T61 laptop with Windows XP SP2, then I cannot access nor format it, even after rebooting with the card inserted. The card shows up in My Computer as &quot;SD / MMC (D:)&quot; and when I click on this icon I get &quot;Please insert a disk into drive D:.&quot; I've tried doing this with the lock tab on and off on the SD Adapter. I then put the 4GB card back into a SDHC compatible digicam, and the card cannot be read. So I format it. I then put the 4GB card back into the laptop, and it works fine. I then put the card into the mobile phone, and the files are readable and fine. I then put it back into the laptop and I get the original error. When I insert a different, good/working 1GB SD card from the digicam into my Lenovo T61, that card works fine. So, now just please answer: Is this normal? Could the SDHC MMC card be partially bad? Does anyone else have an SDHC/MMC card that works fine in your digicam, mobile phone and laptop? TIA! Rossy001 Message was edited by: admin to remove signature ad. Note to member.
