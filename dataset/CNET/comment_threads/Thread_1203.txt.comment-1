Which routers currently have good content filtering?
I am looking at possibly replacing my NetGear 7230 since it seems to &quot;choke&quot; after too much use.
I like the &quot;content filtering&quot; subscription the router allows since I can keep my family from stumbling on certain sites.
I did purchase another router that claimed it supported content filtering, but that required entry of each site.
I am definitely NOT doing that.
Do any other consumer-grade routers support this?
I have used a SonicWall SOHO for a several years, but their annual fee for content filtering was much too high for my usage.
