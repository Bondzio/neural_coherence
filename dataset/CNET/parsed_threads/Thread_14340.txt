<s> i have a 7.1 sound card in my new pc. </s>
<s> could i get a 2.1 speaker system and plug it into the front channels and another and plug it into the rear channels and place them behind me and have 4.2 surround sound? </s>
<s> That's not how digital DSP technology works although it sounds good. </s>
<s> Besides the .1 stands for a sub so you'll never have such a thing as a .2 Otherwise you'd have two subs and that would be pointless. </s>
