The primary question was general in nature: A customer had given me a few choice sticks of RAM instead of CACH (cache?
bad pun?
)So, when I went to CHEQUE (check) the ram, found it had that U (pc3200u) whereas other sticks were w/o the u (pc3200).
As for the more specific nature of propriatary RAM - check out a DELL motherboard: The notches on most(?)
sticks of RAM are off by a fraction - thus forcing you to buy ram directly from Dell instead of your friendly neighbourhood computer warehouse.
