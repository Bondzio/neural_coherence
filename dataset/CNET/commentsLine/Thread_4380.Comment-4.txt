the details are sparse about your issue.
since this is the hardware forum i would expect to see the hardware details, maybe some words about the machine's age, the exact version of the microsoft cd and so on.
as it stands i would have to ask for all that.
remember this are all volunteer forums so you have to do the best you can at making your best post.
