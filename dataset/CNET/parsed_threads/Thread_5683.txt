<s> For some reason as soon my roommate installed his Roku box I have been having IP conflicts on my laptop, and my laptop alone. </s>
<s> I cant figure out how to get them to work together, even after releasing and renewing my ip. </s>
<s> I have also made sure that my DHCP is enabled. </s>
<s> I am running two routers- one that has a modded DD-WRT, but I dont think thats an issue.. Any ideas? </s>
<s> Which OS and did you move to at least WPA? </s>
<s> I also see errors in the event log in admin tools. </s>
<s> Event 1001- your cpu was not assigned an address by the dhcp server. </s>
<s> Do I need to have dhcp activated? </s>
<s> Why am I the only one with the problem? </s>
<s> Shouldn't messing with my router settings affect all? </s>
<s> Ths prob is unfixible. </s>
<s> I also don't know what wps is...s </s>
<s> No the problem will not affect all. </s>
<s> It will only hit the ones with the IP that the roku was handed out. </s>
<s> You wonder if someone tried to manually set the numbers in the roku. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> After disconnecting it, I still had no luck! </s>
<s> Is there a way to check the roku settings? </s>
<s> it just shows me the IP address listed. </s>
<s> Doesn't give me any wireless options.. How do i make it so i stop getting this darn error! </s>
<s> I often change the SSID of the router. </s>
<s> This forces new IPs to be handed out. </s>
<s> Then again if someone has hand assigned IP numbers and used one that is in the DHCP range, they created a problem. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Don't do that! </s>
<s> I wonder about your ROKU. </s>
<s> I can not check mine today. </s>
<s> I just moved and I have my ROKU remote but we haven't found the roku unit. </s>
<s> I'm left to guess you have not explored all menus. </s>
<s> As to the laptop, changing the SSID should help. </s>
<s> If not, the OS may have been damaged by malware or registry cleaners. </s>
<s> -&gt; I asked for which Windows OS and can't find an answer. </s>
<s> This severely limits me since I can not write tcpip resets for all 5 versions. </s>

<s> running Windows XP. </s>
<s> I will try the SSID switch... </s>
<s> Doubt it will work... Just dont understand why its just MY computer having problems... </s>
<s> Especially since nobody has a fixed IP - nobody in my apartment knows how to mess with that stuff... Any help would be greatly appreciated </s>

<s> About an IP conflict and now you write it freezes. </s>
<s> That's two different issues unless you meant something else. </s>
<s> Review http://www.troublefixers.com/fixed-there-is-an-ip-address-conflict-with-another-system-on-the-network/ and then consider changing the DHCP range in the router. </s>
<s> Now that I know .14 is conflicting, we can change the DHCP range to .100 to .200 -&gt; As you are running a modded DD-WRT I have to think this would be trivial for you. </s>
<s> If not, supply a link to your modded DD-WRT's manual so I can find the config screen. </s>
