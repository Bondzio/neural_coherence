<s> hi all, ok, I have RCN's &quot;10&quot; speed internet, a toshiba pcx 2500 cable modem, a phone router from vonage, and a wgr 614v6 wireless router, wired in that order. </s>
<s> here's the problem: when there is a power failure (doesn't happen often, but . </s>

<s> ), after the power comes back on the wireless connection on my laptop says the signal is there but it doesn't actually work. </s>
<s> I have to recycle the modem/routers one at a time in wired order to get things back to normal. </s>
<s> is there a way to do something so i wouldn't have to do that (in case the power goes off when i'm not around and neighbors using the wifi can get on)? </s>
<s> also this pcx 2500 modem, I pay $3 to rcn for it, it's 2 years old at least, is this thing up to date technology? </s>

<s> Since we are looking at such small power usage, the UPS may be the cheap cure. </s>

<s> it's all part of the same reworking of the wifi setup but the power failure i thoguht was a different subject/ quesiotn, hope that is ok. i will look into the ups, maybe there is a small one for those 3 itmes - fj </s>
<s> Yes there are power sequencers like http://www.fullcompass.com/product/276661.html but an UPS is cheap. </s>
<s> And here is cheaper than new routers or modems. </s>
