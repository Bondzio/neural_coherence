you'll need to provide more description about your dvr.
that's what you'll need to figure out, how (on your dvr) you can access a setup page to set a static ip.
for a temporary fix, if you have other computers on your network, give them all static ips.
then tell your router to only give out 1 ip for the dhcp network, and your dvr will always have the same ip.
for instance, set your ip range for the dhcp to 192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.2
