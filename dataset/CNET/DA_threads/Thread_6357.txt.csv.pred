1.1.1	I went to the Dell support site and put in my service tag # and got to the necessary drivers.	St
1.1.2	I downloaded the drivers but when I execute them, I get a &quot;Cannot Start Application&quot;.	St
1.1.3	How do I get these drivers installed?	St
1.1.4	I had to install Win XP SP1 after a HD failure and of course none of my drivers are present.	St
1.1.5	I need to get my OEM sound working again.	St
1.1.6	I don't have the original disks.	St
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	This has been the cause.	St
1.2.2	Just a list.	St
1.2.3	1.	St
1.2.4	SP2 was required.	St
1.2.5	I have an old machine that the drivers will fail to install on SP3.	St
1.2.6	I have to write a note to myself about that and put into the driver CD sleeve so I remember that.	St
1.2.7	2.	St
1.2.8	An antivirus suite, firewall can interfere.	St
1.2.9	Disconnect the internet and try again without those.	St
1.2.10	3.	St
1.2.11	There is an order which drivers must (shall!)	St
1.2.12	be installed in.	St
1.2.13	Example: OS, Motherboard driver package, Sometimes the MSUAA then the sound driver.	St
1.2.14	More at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?threadID=271360#2699006 and you can google up MSUAA and Dells.	St
1.2.15	4.	St
1.2.16	A corrupted download.	St
1.2.17	Can be your AV suite or a download accelerator.	St
