From what I've heard, I think 10/100 NIC's should run at 100mbps... but mine is running at 10mbps... My computer is running behind a D-Link DI-524 Router also, what is gigabit?

However it would be proper for most NICs to run at 10 Mb if there were connected to most DSL or Cable modems. But detail is missing. You mention a DI 524, but not much else. For the internet, this speed is sufficient and nothing needs to be fixed. Bob
