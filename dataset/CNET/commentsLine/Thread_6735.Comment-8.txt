stuff like that happens when you either get a virus, trojan, or in some cases spyware.
do you have: a anti-virus program?
a firewall?
spyware programs like both: adaware and spybot and ms anti-spyware all above can be obtained free.
ps...hope you are not listening to music from some of those p2p sites that can cause that kind of problem.
