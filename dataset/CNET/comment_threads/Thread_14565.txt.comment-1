I'm looking to buy a video & capture card combo (e.g.
ATI All-in-Wonder or similar).
My friend has the old 128MB AGP version and it works for them and from what I've seen it's gotten great reviews.
But I want 256MB & I need the PCI-E format.
Currently I have a very cheapo capture card and video card and wish to upgrade both at the same time.
I need to get a 256MB 2006 PCI-E version of the card (I don't have an AGP slot), but it seems to have gotten more bad reviews than good.
I don't know of any other options for the same combo technology either.
Does anyone have any comments on this card (2006 PCI-E version) or any other suggestions to getting another combo card for roughly the same price?
I am also worried about its integration w/ WinXP MCE 2005.
