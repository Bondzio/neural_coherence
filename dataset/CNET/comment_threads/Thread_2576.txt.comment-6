Depending on which model you purchased there may be a few options.
If you have a 13', 15' or 17' MacBook Pro you have Firewire 800.
The adapters for a Firewire 800 to Firewire 400 I beelive, are more reliable.
The 17' model also has an Express slot.
You can buy Express cards that provide Firewire 400 ports.
