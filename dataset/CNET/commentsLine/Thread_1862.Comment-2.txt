if you're using a linksys router with the rt31p2 vonage adapter it will work fine.
linksys publishes the procedure on their knowledge base id 358. i am using the same system with no problems...essentially you &quot;cascade&quot; the routers...change the router ip to 192.168.15.2...disable dhcp...from your modem you connect to internet port of the rt31p2...connect &quot;ethernet (1) on the rt31p2 to your router (i connected to &quot;4&quot;) all this may sound confusing, at least it does to me, so your best bet is to check out the linksys knowledge base...even ask their tech help via e-mail...that's what i did and they were most helpful.
this system works great with no problems - good luck
