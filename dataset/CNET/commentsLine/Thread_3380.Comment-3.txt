my dell pc only has usb 1.1. the western digital usb 80bg drive i'm trying to install is usb 2.0 but is &quot;backwards&quot; compatible.
when i first installed out of the box everything worked, drive letter was assigned (i didn't put any data on it).
then i unpluged it without ejecting hardware (as i should have).
then when i plugged it back in, the plug and play recognized it, added it in device manager but &quot;my computer&quot; now didnot recognize it.
since then i've uninstalled all usb hubs/drivers etc in safe mode, restarted windows xp, plug and play recongnizes all my devices again, but now gives me a message when i attached my usb drive - &quot;hi speed usb device added to non-hi speed usb&quot; and &quot;problem with install device may have problems&quot; and now the usb drive doesnot show up under disk drives in device manager and under usb controllers, there is a yellow exclamation point.
i have sp1 and all updates to windowxp.
enough info?
thanks for any help!
