Not everyone can do this but here's an explanation.
Wifi is shared access space.
Only one device can talk at a time and if another talks then the message can be lost.
As you add more devices this speed drops off as there is less time per device to talk and there is some talk on almost all machines even when they are idle.
When wired there is a &quot;switched hub&quot; which can store and forward packets to keep things moving at top speed.
Wifi works but don't lean on it too hard.
