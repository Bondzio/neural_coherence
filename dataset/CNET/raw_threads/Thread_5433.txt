2378	0	147749	1649467	NR	Angelmaat	1/5/06 5:56 PM	1.13648376E12	Questions about a new graphics card	I recently bought Myst Uru: Complete Chronicles (I already have Myst,II, & III and was able to play them with no problem.). I have had difficulty getting the game to work and when I visited the forum I gathered that my graphics card just wasn't up to the task. The one I have is pretty old, so I guess I'm not that surprised. I don't have a lot of money but I'm hoping to get some good advice here. I'm particularly concerned because my motherboard is also old and I don't know what kind of cards will be able to be installed on it. Intel has stopped giving any advice about it. I have and Intel D845WN motherboard with an Intel Pentium 4 processor, speed 1.6 ghz. My current graphics card is an Ati Rage 128pro Xpert 2000pro 32m AGP (I copied this right off the card) and is the card the thing came with so I don't know if there is a certain number of connectors that I need to worry about or anything like that. I do have 512mb of RAM and am running Windows XP Pro, SP2 as my OS.
