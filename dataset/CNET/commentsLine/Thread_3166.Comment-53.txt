hard drives store data in magnetic tracks that are laid down when you format the drive.
over time, the magnetic signal fades.
the rule of thumb is that the strength fades 50% in 5 years.
you can refresh this by re-formatting the drive.
of course, in order to re-format, you have to copy your data elsewhere first.
storage is dirt cheap these days.
get another drive, copy your data onto it and use the new one as your primary drive.
re-format the old one, then copy your data back onto it and keep it as a back-up.
if you really, really care about your data, i also recommend an offsite backup service such as mozy or carbonite.
there are lots around these days and they are not expensive.
