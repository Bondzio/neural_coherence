First off, I agree with Robert, 300W isn't enough for what you have even if its working now.
Sooner or later considering the installed devices it'll probably come back to haust you.
Next, I just checked my own system and 116F is shown on mine or 48C.
It should heat-up upon being used and more if intensely used.
I wouldn't sweat it for now, provided all cooling is proper and such.
so enjoy.
good luck -----Willy
