it's the first thing i thought when you described your symptoms.
it's probably being overloaded.
if you watch the fans, you'll probably see them twitch a bit and stop when you press the power button.
you could try disconnecting hard drives, cd roms, etc.
to see if it will try to boot up as far as the bios.
if it does, it's too weak for the load it's connected to.
