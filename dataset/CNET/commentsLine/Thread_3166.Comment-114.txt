i have had my little dell since 2003 but also i keep upgrading things.
i have to tell you if this little puter quit's tomorrow i didn't waste a dime that i have put into.
i am a power user;(grahic design) would trade my little desktop for anything you could offer me to this day, new and in box.
my computer has been very good to me of course i am nice to my darling in return.
upgrades and cleaning are not option here i do this quite often.
thanks for the article, awesome.
happy computing, take care and things will just keep on keeping on.
