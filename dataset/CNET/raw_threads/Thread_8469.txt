Cable Select or Master (I never use Master but we are in crisis mode.) 3. Put the drive on the master connection of the ide cable. 4. Put it on the known working IDE port (unplug the DVD). 5. Check that power is connected. Does the BIOS see it with either CS or Master? Is the cable no good? Try it as Master on the cable the DVD uses. Next? Data recovery houses like drivesavers.com Bob

Proffitt	6/13/07 12:59 PM	1.18173954E12	About &quot;that&quot;	&quot;he part where the IDE is being detected. i mean the part wherein when you press DEL you can access bios configuration. but if i disconnect the maxtor hard disk again, everything comes to normal.&quot;... All that means is that something is wrong with the drive. If it's worth saving, get a quote from drivesavers.com or ontrack.com Not to bother you but why is what you can't lose only on hard disks?
