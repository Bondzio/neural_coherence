My system specs are as follow:Antec Case, ABit IC7-G mother board, 500 watt Antec Power Supply, Radeon 9600XT graphics card, DVD drive, CDRW Drive, 1gig DDR2 Memory, 120gig hard drive, 19in ViewSonic LCD and Windows XP Home SP2.
When I try playing Everquest 2 the computer freezes after a few moments and then pushes the game into a minimized window instead of full screen and says the Graphics Drivers have stopped working(or responding).
I have downloaded and installed the newest drivers for the MB,Graphics Card, Sound, DirectX and my monitor.
I also reduced the resolution from 1152x864 to 1024x768.
Anything else I can do?
