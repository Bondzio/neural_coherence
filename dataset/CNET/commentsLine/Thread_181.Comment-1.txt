dear friends, here my situation.
i have a adsl modem (ovislink) that is wired in my phone outlet and this modem is also wired to my router (lynkys) that send wifi signal to my laptop.when i have done the configuration, the modem was wired to my laptop.
however, once the modem-router are alone, the internet speed drop dramatically after couple of days (from 5m kbps to 500 kbps).when i'm calling my internet provider to reset ip address on his side it does nothing on my side.
still slow.i s anyone has experimented such problem?
is it my connexion design that is wrong?
please help....i can't leave with a connexion &lt;500 kbps!!
cheers, -blu
