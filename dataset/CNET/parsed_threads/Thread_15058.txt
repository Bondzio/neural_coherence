<s> Hi there, I've got a friend with a generic PC put together with Heaven knows what (no brand names). </s>
<s> He said it was working just fine, then one day stopped. </s>
<s> It looks to me like the PC just isn't booting up. </s>
<s> When you turn on the power, the hard drive light comes on for about 30 seconds or so, then nothing. </s>
<s> It doesn't sound like it's going through any POST or any kind of startup and there's no signal to the monitor. </s>
<s> What are the most common causes of this kind of problem and what should I be checking? </s>
<s> Thanks to everyone/anyone in advance for their replies and advice. </s>
<s> Regards, --- Gary </s>
<s> What is usually done is the monitor is tried on a working machine and a working monitor tried on the failed machine. </s>
<s> Causes are simple. </s>
<s> Age, heat, and broken parts. </s>
<s> The trick for home repair is to guess which part. </s>
<s> For home repair this can be tough since you might not have a spare video card to see if that was it. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> It's not the monitor or the video card. </s>
<s> I did try another monitor just for the heck of it and there was no change. </s>
<s> But the problem is not simply that I'm not getting a display. </s>
<s> The problem is that the PC does not appear to be booting at all. </s>
<s> It has power, but there is no startup activity; No beeps; No flashing lights on the keyboard; No sound of activity on the hard drive or floppy drive, etc. </s>
<s> I was just wondering if this was specifically indicitave of anything obvious, such as a bad motherboard. </s>
<s> The only thing I've tried so far was removing the memory chip and disconnecting the hard drive (no difference). </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> No monitor required. </s>
<s> Four parts... CPU/HSF (heatsinkfan) Motherboard PSU (power supply unit) Speaker. </s>
<s> Nothing else. </s>
<s> No cards, memory, keyboard, ide cables.. nothing but the 4 parts. </s>
<s> No beeps means you've narrowed it down to those four parts. </s>
