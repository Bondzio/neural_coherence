I'm gonna buy a new processor (Intel Core 2 Duo E7400 2,8GHz), memory (Corsair TWIN2X 6400 DDR2, 4096MB CL5) and graphics card (XFX GeForce 9800GT 650M 512MB PhysX CUDA). I'm a real newb at this xD. what kind of power supply will i need? Will this hardware be compitable with my MSI P965 neo-f motherboard http://www.msicomputer.com/product/p_spec.asp?model=P965_Neo-F&class=mb
7495	1	336008	3009307	3009206	ramarc	3/23/09 11:15 AM	1.2378069E12	depends on your board version	the msi support site only lists a p965-neo and p65-neo f v2 . the p965-neo f v2 has been tested with the new e7000 and e8000 series core2duos. the e7400 isn't on the tested list but it will work since the only difference between it and the e7300 is the multiplier. (the support list for older boards isn't updated often.) the p965-neo has only been teseted with e4000 and e6000 series core2duos and may not work with the e7000/e8000 series. as for the video card, a 450w or larger power supply is recommended. here's a suggestion: ocz 500w, $60 before $20 rebate

7495	3	336008	3009481	3009429	ramarc	3/23/09 2:09 PM	1.23781734E12	the card and ram are fine	as for the cpu, if you're upgrading from a pentium 4 or pentium d, then an e4600 would be a nice boost. e4600, $131
