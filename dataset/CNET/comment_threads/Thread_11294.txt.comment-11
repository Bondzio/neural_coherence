That we can barely measure it.
For instance a pair of desktops we used to render DVDs gave me a good measure back then.
We could move the ram from one to another and the one with 1GB would finish the 6 hour task 5 minutes sooner.
For Vista I think 2GB is the hot spot to be.
You can try your own benchmark to see if going over 2GB helps but you will never find 4GB listed in any usable number since part of the 32-bit memory map must leave about .5 GB open for the video card, BIOS and such.
You will find common reports of 2.75 to 3.5GB reported in the tools but even with the /3GB switch XP doesn't let the apps use more... Bob
