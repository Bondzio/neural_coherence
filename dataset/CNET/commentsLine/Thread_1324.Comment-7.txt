i hate to burst your bubble; but, archtecture has a certain set of flags.
amd64 and emt64 have the same flags with the differences only in the naming of a few.
if you had a computer with a choice of sparc64, mips64, ppc g4+, arm64, or anything with a 64/128 bit address then i would say, &quot;go for the sparc.&quot;
