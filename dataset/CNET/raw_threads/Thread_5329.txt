Hello Friends, George Ou at TechRepublic states that even in high end systems a good quality power supply with 330 watts is all you need? I am including a link to the article. Scroll down to the the power supply section. It's near the top. It will say, &quot;Note on the power supply:&quot; Also read his comments in the posts below. I hope this is true, but what are your thoughts/experiences? Thanks in Advance http://articles.techrepublic.cbsi.com/5100-10877-6161342.html

While I'll call it slim at 330 Watts it is possible to build a high end system today with smaller supplies because parts are starting to show up without hungry power needs. My Core 2 Duo (C2D) is sipping just under 100 Watts of AC power on the power meter (I bought such to measure this) and the old box used to run over 200 when idling. Bob

I've had much higher power requirements when I ran a P4 clocked to 3.5 GHz in the same computer and that went up to 280 watts at times yet the quality 330 watt Active PFC power supply didn't even stutter.&quot;

Read http://www.tomshardware.com/2002/10/21/inadequate_and_deceptive_product_labeling/ The results are clear. To stay away from PSU trouble, get a big one. There are no downsides to slipping in a 450, 500 or more Watt PSU and your system using less than 1/2 that. Bob

12536	6	262622	2575533	2575466	Digibop	9/2/07 8:58 AM	1.18872348E12	I'll be ok	I have an Antec Modular Neo Power 480 watt PSU going into a new build. So, I am not really concerned. Right now I'm using an Antec 430 watt PSU and it's an older modol. Never shows the slightest problem running video editing, encoding, games, photoshop, etc. So the 480 will run even better. Antecs are extremely efficient and I always use them. Of course anyone could go out and buy a 1,000 watt piece of cr@p and have it die in a week. I'm not debating with anybody, just trying to keep others informed. Whether you like him or not George Ou knows his tech.

Think of it in the &quot;3 little pigs and bad wolf fable&quot; way and see what gets by and when better is better. From straw, to wood, to brick, it just is better. tada -----Willy

Thanks in Advance http://articles.techrepublic.cbsi.com/5100-10877-6161342.html&quot; 'Note on the power supply: I'm using a SeaSonic S12-330 330 watt power supply, which can be had for $55. I swear by these power supplies, and I own five of them because they're super efficient at above 80 percent, they're dead silent, and they're very affordable. Most power supplies make much more noise and are typically in the 60-70 percent energy efficiency range. Many people spend upwards of $100 on a higher power supply, citing the myth that you need at least 400 watts and higher on a modern computer. That's utter nonsense even for a high-end PC. Even the highest-end PCs peak out at around 250 watts. The measured power consumption at the plug for the PC in this tutorial idled at around 73 watts and peaked out at around 110 watts during intense CPU loads. The high wattage power supply proponents will often cite video card manuals specifying that they need a 400 watt power supply, but those numbers were just pulled out of thin air and aren't based on actual power consumption measurements. 330 watts happens to be one of the smallest ATX power supplies you can find, and it's more than enough for what we're building here.'

The articles title: Build a great PC on a budget with these parts and procedures. True, but I asked you to read his comments. Apparantly you did not. Here are a few of his replies: If I went that EXTREME I'd probably go with a Seasonic 400 watt PSU just to have the extra overhead to house 6 more hard drives. But truth be told the 330 watt PSU is technically enough even for an extreme PC if you don't put a lot of drives in to it. Even an overclocked dual core system with an 8800 GTX will work on this 330 watt PSU peaking at about 280 watts of power consumption. I use to run two old P4 system that peaked that high for many years. You just can't add any more drives or DVD burners to it. However, I'd probably recommend the 400 watt Seasonic at $90 for that kind of system so that it has room to grow. If you've ever noticed, the Seasonic power supplies are very conservative with their ratings. There are plenty of free PSUs you get with a cheap chassis that's labeled &quot;400 watts&quot;, that doesn't mean it's reliable at any where close to that. Again, 330 is double over kill. I'm not pulling these numbers out of thin air. This system measured 110 watts at peak load at the power plug! Even if this were an EXTREME system with an NVIDIA 8800 GTX, it would still be less than 280 watt peak which a quality 330 watt Active PFC PSU can handle with ease. This business of spending hundreds of dollars on a quarter, half, or one ton power supply is getting absurd. Theres a tendency for power users to think more is better, but thats just a nice way to sell more expensive power supplies. I am no fan of George, but he's been around PCs a lot. vapcmd your &quot;quibble&quot; should be with Mr. Ou, I'm just stating what HE wrote. Like I replied earlier, I have an Antec 480 watt Neo Power Modular PS (My girlfriend bought it for me) so I'll be fine.

My psu has 2-12v rails @ 18a each = 264w maximum on combined 12v divided by 12 = 22amps (305w). My limits on a gpu are 7900GT, 8600GTS, or X1950Pro. Can't even think about the 8800 series or 2900's. My 2 cents
