<s> I am scoping out solutions for a new pc. </s>
<s> I would like to build it myself, but am unsure of available components. </s>
<s> Here are my needs. </s>
<s> I do use Photoshop, and I am upgrading to CS. </s>
<s> As far as gaming, I would like to run some first person shooters, but don't need top end performance. </s>
<s> I don't play much. </s>
<s> My wife would also like for me to make it into a Personal Video Recorder. </s>
<s> And budget is an issue. </s>
<s> I already know: I want 1GB Ram I have a case & power supply. </s>
<s> I know what HD and optical drives to use. </s>
<s> What I don't know: Processor, is an AMD 64 a good choice? </s>
<s> Do I need 64bit? </s>
<s> What else do I need to know about cache etc... MoBo. </s>
<s> How much stuff do I need. </s>
<s> Onboard sound is fine for me. </s>
<s> Onboard Lan is cool. </s>
<s> Do I need PCIe or AGP slots? </s>
<s> And, most of all, graphics cards. </s>
<s> Do I need one for the TV functions and one for the photoshop/gaming? </s>
<s> Is there a all in one solution that is more viable? </s>
<s> What chipsets/brands are good? </s>
<s> And overall, remember this is on a budget. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the help </s>
<s> these are less than $700. </s>
<s> This is $850 and very good. </s>
<s> HP Pavilion a1250n Minitower http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=332849&pfp=BROWSE </s>
<s> Not sure that Athlon 64 is the fastest on the market right now. </s>
<s> Pentium 4 at 3.4 ghz is the fastest, closely followed by the Athlon xp. </s>
<s> If you think you'll need serious speed, (video editing?) </s>
<s> then dont go cheap on the processor. </s>
<s> the thing with 64 bit processors is that there is no software that takes advantage of it properly. </s>
<s> Presumably there will be, one day, but they dont seem to be rushing to put it out. </s>
<s> So it might not be worthwhile to invest in one. </s>
<s> (I bought one when they just came out, and have yet to see any good returns on it.) </s>

<s> There are faster processors such as athlon 64x2s and Pentium Ds. </s>
<s> But these are dual-cores. </s>
<s> Athlon 64s are okay and for the price of around $700, pretty good. </s>
<s> If you can afford, get a Pent D or A64 X2. </s>
