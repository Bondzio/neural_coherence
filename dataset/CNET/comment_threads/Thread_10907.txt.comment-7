I don't think fiber needs termination since it will run just like ethernet only that category5/6 cables are replaced by fiber network cables and I believe the router or switch that I can find will terminate just like ethernet.
I think the question about terminating the fiber would only apply if I hard wire 2 machines directly to each other without any networking devices.
