1.1.1	ok , first my specs : Sony Vaio w/ 3.6 ghz P4 w/HT ( 560J Prescott ) 1 gig of 3200 DDR ram ( 400 mhz ) ASUSTeK motherboard model PTGD2-VX XFX 7600 GT video card 256 GDDR2 MB PCIe ( 590 mhz core ) 2 SATA 250 GB hd 's @ 7200 RPM I bought this PC about 2 years ago , but am now wondering if it 's time I upgrade or if I should wait..	St
1.1.2	I currently use my PC for music composition and internet..	St
1.1.3	But intend to also start playing a new game coming out called & quot ; Supreme Commander & quot ; .. After running 3DMark06 , my PC only scored a 3350 on the overall tests..	St
1.1.4	If I do buy a new PC , I do want to see improvement in overall system performance , such as day to day stuff -- but also , in gaming as well .	St
1.1.5	I 'm a little confused as to whats what these days , Intel has come out with several new CPU 's since this one came out .	St
1.1.6	The Core 2 Duo is a bit confusing as they advertise as 1.87 , 2.13 , and so on.. And if they are truely faster , I 'm very uncertain how much faster..	St
1.1.7	Although , I do know my FSB is not as fast , nor is my memory speed , which is only 400 mhz and I believe the top is around 667 mhz at the moment..	St
1.1.8	I 'm not looking to plunk down $ 5000 for a new system , so Alien-***** is out ... would appreciate any suggestions you guys might have .	St
1.1.9	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	the low 3dmark06 is due to the graphics card .	St
1.2.2	your sony ca n't be upgraded to a core2duo , but it can probably accept a dual-core upgrade .	St
1.2.3	here are my suggestions : 1 ) call sony/visit tech support and see if your motherboard supports the pentium-d. if so , a pentium-d 945 is $ 170 ( 2 3.4ghz processors vs 1 3.6ghz ) and would you give a boost in day-to-day activities .	St
1.2.4	You can eBay the 560J for about $ 80 .	St
1.2.5	( if sony tech support is hard to contact , you can download cpu-z from http : //www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php ; if your mainboard chipset is i945 or i975 it *should* support a pentium-d. ) 2 ) consider getting a 7900GS ( about $ 180 ) or 7950GT ( about $ 240 ) based video card .	St
1.2.6	you may have to upgrade your power supply for another $ 50 .	St
1.2.7	3 ) consider adding another 512mb to 1gb of ram if you have 2 free slots ( $ 60- $ 120 or so ) .	St
1.2.8	for about $ 400 you 'd have a pc that wo n't be very far behind today 's curve and should keep you happy till next Christmas at least .	St
1.3.1	http : //www.systemrequirementslab.com/referrer/srtest It is the company that lists the reqs on the sides of the boxes .	St
1.3.2	It scans your computer and gives you suggestions based on the game you want to play .	St
1.3.3	It can also detect errors in your hardware setup and gives links to get the newsest drivers for stuff .	St
