we got a trs-80 color computer in december 1983. it used a tape recorder as a tape drive instead of floppies, and no hard drive.
there was not a monitor, you hooked it up to a tv.
not long after that, i got to use a trs-80 with dual floppy drives (5.25 single sided), when i took a basic programing course.
