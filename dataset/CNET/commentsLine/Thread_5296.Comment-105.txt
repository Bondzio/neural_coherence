hoping to upgrade?
well now, lets be a little careful i once had an acer computer that for the price gave me everything and more than i needed.
one problem.
most or all of the components are hard wired in.
you cannot, yes, i repeat you cannot replace them , or upgrade them without some major surgery.
(except memory) i'm not sure that it's true with all acer computers, and i don't know why they do it that way.
it seems to me that it would be easier just to assemble parts, and let it go at that.
in the final analysis, make sure you contact the compuer manufacturer, (not always the easiest thing to do) and find out if the computer you are interested in is upgradeable, and what components or all components are upgradeable.
now acer does have a good customer service website, so i've not had a problem adding on some components that hang on outside the computer.
after five years it still works fine, but it does have its problems occassionally.
like not wanting to turn on at times.
