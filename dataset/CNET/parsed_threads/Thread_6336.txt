<s> Hi, I am trying to buy new RAM for my gateway desktop and there is a really good deal on for some DDR3 1600MHz RAM. </s>
<s> The memory adviser results on the crucial website say that my computer can hold 16GB of 1333MHz DDR3 ( http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=FX6831-01&amp;Cat=RAM ). </s>
<s> But does that mean that my computer can't handle 1600MHz RAM? </s>
<s> And would there be a performance difference if i was to have 1600MHz instead of the 1333MHz? </s>
<s> Also, does it matter if the RAM is DRAM or SDRAM? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> If you already have 8GBs of DDR3-1333MHz and you add 8GBs of DDR3-1600MHz, the 16GBs RAM would all run at 1333MHz. </s>
<s> Bottomline, it may or may not run at all with the higher speed RAM. </s>
<s> Do you actually know what RAM is in it now ? </s>
<s> (NOTE...it may be equal to or greater than what the mfg advertises.) </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> The RAM thats in my computer now is 4x2GB 1333MHz DDR3. </s>
<s> And I'm wanting to remove it all and replace it with 4x4GB of 1600MHz DDR3. </s>
<s> So you're saying that the 1600MHz RAM might or might not work? </s>
<s> I'm guessing there's no way to tell for sure. </s>
<s> The make, model of the PC but I see the mix and match question is answered. </s>
<s> Crucial almost always gets you the right RAM. </s>
<s> But as to the speed that's an interesting issue. </s>
<s> No company wants to produce slower ram so this is why you use higher speed ram. </s>
<s> It will work at the lower speed happily. </s>
<s> But you do have owners that want to know more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> work, that it will work at the higher speed. </s>
<s> Off-the-shelf PCs from the BIG BOX MFGs just don't usually incorporate features to support higher speed RAM. </s>
<s> My recommendation...leave it as is and you really want/need more RAM then just add the additional recommended RAM Questions ? </s>
<s> We'll be here. </s>
