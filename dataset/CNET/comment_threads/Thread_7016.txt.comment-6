I have an amazon instance that has public IP eg: 10.25.251.38 and is also connected to internal network (10.1.50.xxx) with bunch of other amazon instances running ubuntu that have a BI Web Application installed.
They are also on the same internal network different subnet (10.1.51.xxx).
I can start and stop those instances from web server (10.25.251.38) using amazon aws sdk.
Now the tricky part: I also want to load those instances up directly in same web server.
Best course of action would be to use in Iframe, but then users can easily see the address where iframe is pointing to and I want to force users to use my web app only.
I agree with Bob on the subject of openness vs closeness of html, but in this particular case, I would prefer to limit access as much as possible to internal network.
Hope this clarifies the question and results in an awesome response Thank you guys, Mario
