It's in a slot on the top that you can pull out. It has now filled up even though we tried to install everything we could on E: & F: and won't let us even update the virus program or window's updates. Well he bought a 120gb SSD and Norton Ghost. Can you give us the basic steps? Like First install the new SSD Then image the C: to the new SSD He thinks he can just copy the C: to F: and then pull out the old SSD and put the new SSD in and then copy from F:. I don't think it works that way. If you pull out the C: drive won't the computer stop working? Don't we have to install the new SSD in the computer first? Also another thing I worry about is if you image the old SSD to the new SSD how do you keep all the GB on the new one without turning it into a 60GB? Follow me? I'm pretty good at figuring computer stuff out but this sounds too scary for me. But if I had the basic steps I could probably figure out the details. Is this something we can try or do OR should we let Fry's do it? They can probably do it in a hour with a more professional program. It will probably take us 3 days of stress.

Well now it's a year later and we filled up it up! How you doing with your 64GB, Kees? http://forums.cnet.com/7723-19411_102-513907/win-7-on-ssd/?messageId=5065087&tag=rb_content;contentBody
