1.1.1	I have two PC 's , one desktop and one laptop , they work fine together when they are using the Internet , but when I go online with my PS3 , and the laptop connects , the PS3 disconnects , I 'm thinking about the Port Forwarding feature , but I do n't know how to use it , I connect to the router wired with the PS3 and wirelessly with the laptop , so why .	St
1.1.2	I use the Netgear WGR614 v6 Router , updated to the latest firmware .	St
1.1.3	I just ca n't think of anyway around this other than Port Forwarding , someone help .	St
1.2.1	the router back to factory defaults .	St
1.2.2	Then explore the Netgear documentation about setting up the PS3 .	St
1.2.3	Port Forwarding should not be a default setting .	St
1.3.1	I think it has to do with IP Address errors , is there a way to change and keep the same IP with the computer so I do n't get a conflict with logging in with the same account .	St
1.4.1	each device 's MAC address to a specific IP address .	St
1.4.2	I do n't know how Linksys does it , but look at the configuration setup .	St
1.4.3	My main PC and my web server have their addresses locked in my D-link router .	St
1.4.4	It 's under DHCP reservations .	St
