I was just thinking....A Dual Processor PowerMac is way faster than a Dual Processor Intel (from what i've read online)...My question is: Since Macs are soon to come with Intel Processors, isn't that going to bring Macs back to the dinosaur era? (Speed-wise, not Sales-wise) Also Macs are known for their stable Hardware, isn't that switch going to affect Mac's best known stable computers? Thanks,
