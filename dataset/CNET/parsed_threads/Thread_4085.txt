<s> config: AMD duron 1.1 Ghz PC Chips M811 ver 3.1 Mobo 256 DDR RAM ATI 9200 SE 128 I had a K7SEM mobo that fried (it seems they are very prone to frying) so i ordered the M811 and hooked everything up to it. </s>
<s> Plugged it in using a 300 W power supply, and nothing happened. </s>
<s> Tried a different power supply (400W) and, when i plugged in, the CPU fan twitched..then nothing. </s>
<s> Tried yet another power supply (one im positive works because its powering the computer im using to type this, but only 250W ) and back to nothing. </s>
<s> I feel like I'm grabbing at straws but that little Cpu fan twitch makes me hesitant to throw the mobo out. </s>
<s> Can anyone remove all doubt for me/have suggestions on other things to try? </s>
<s> thanks in advance -bj- </s>
<s> To test that the motherboard is not the issue, I take the power supply and the board out on a piece of cardboard and with no CPU, RAM or any other parts power it up. </s>
<s> If it doesn't power up, it's the board or PSU. </s>

<s> Quick check...Review the manual/helpguide and verify the frt. </s>
<s> panel power sw. is actaully on the right connection. </s>
<s> Usually a 2-pin connection it can mistaken or misunderstood labeling and thus &quot;no go&quot; when sw. is pushed. </s>
<s> Further, you can momentarily touch the pin contacts to act as sw. to see if starts then, bad sw. maybe or wrong connector used(remote?) </s>
<s> As for fan twitch, a power surge can do that, a good quality p/s unit locks that down. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Make sure that you have the 4 pin connector, 2 black wires and 2 yellow wires, plugged into the motherboard. </s>
<s> Without that connected, your system will not power up. </s>
