<s> A lot of the CPUs sold these days are of 64-bit. </s>
<s> But are they of any help at all if I'm still using 32-bit applications on a 32-bit OS? </s>
<s> And is there any point at all to go into 64-bit if I'm using less than 4GB of RAM? </s>
<s> Today the apps would run no faster if ported to 64 bit only. </s>
<s> The rare exception will be noted here and there but for today you can do wonders with the 32 bit OS, 2.0GB RAM and a better video card. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It's a general argument that I've heard from various sources that 64-bit won't become mainstream in quite some more years to come. </s>
<s> If that's the case wouldn't it be more sensible to go down a grade and get a 32-bit CPU instead of a 64-bit? </s>
<s> The Core 2 Duo gains over the Core Duo are such that you would get the C2D everytime. </s>
<s> Essentially you get EM64T for free. </s>
<s> But the real payoffs for many is the video card (games.) </s>
<s> I have to stick with generic answers since we are not talking specifics here. </s>
<s> Specifics? </s>
<s> MySQL gets a speed boost from 64 bit. </s>
<s> Games in general get nothing but by curbing the cost of the usual 64-bit OS and putting that into our video card we gain FPS. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> even the $50 celeron e1200 is 64bit. </s>
<s> so don't waste your time looking for a &quot;32bit&quot; processor since they are all obsolete. </s>
