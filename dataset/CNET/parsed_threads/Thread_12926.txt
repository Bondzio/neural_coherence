<s> I would be very grateful if someone could help me to resolve my dilemma. </s>
<s> I want to buy a laser printer, and my final choices are Samsung ML 2010 and HP 1020. </s>
<s> I saw the reviews on the Web, so I know that the performances of ML 2010 are better than of those of HP 1200. </s>
<s> On the other hand, users rating of HP 1020 is higher. </s>
<s> The price here, in Montenegro, is 135$ + tax, for ML 2010, and 127$ + tax, for HP 2010. </s>
<s> That is not the significant difference, but my main concern is the quality of printing, as well as the reliability of the printers. </s>
<s> No one spoke of malfunctions, so I do not know, in that way, which of these two printers is better choice. </s>
<s> I hope you can help me with this iossue. </s>
<s> I have bought HP printers since my first LaserJet+. </s>
<s> The LaserJet plus was 13 years old and I gave it away but they tell me it still works. </s>
<s> At those prices why not? </s>
<s> As to print quality, unless you are looking for engraved litho output these are just fine for legal papers and more. </s>
