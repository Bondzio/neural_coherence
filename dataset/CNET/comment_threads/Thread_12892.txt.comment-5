Do you have a PC manufactured by Gateway, HP or someother company or have you designed your own system.
I was wondering how these systems were working and if there were any problems.
I'm thinking about purchasing an X2 or Pentium D based system.
I'm also wondering about Sony, HP etc.
After using my Sony Notebook w/PII for over six years with out a problem and My P4 1.5 Sony Desktop for the last 5 years.
I purchased a Compaq Notebook w a 64bit AMD I have nothing against AMD but am not happy with the noteboods quality, ie: the transformer power cord falls out of the back of the computer.
I've also had to replace the transformer after one year.
My Sony notebook never had one problem.
Send me any feedback you can.
