it just goes down...no warning and it doesn't power back up...it's not a virus or worm...I run daily Virus Scans so I highly doubt that it's a virus...
So, I am going to try and pull out all the uneeded components and see if I can get a stable boot...with just CPU, GPU, RAM, Mobo and see if it loads...the guy who sold me the thing thinks the HDD may be taking to much juice...which sounds logical because it rarley goes caput when in BIOS/POST screens...so if it fails I know that I need a better unit..suggestions?
Thanks for your replies so far...
