windows will recognize the new hardware and of course run through the wizards to install, but you will likely have to reactivate your copy of windows.
i recently moved my xp hardrive from an old machine to a different mainboard, cpu, ram and psu due to a mainboard failure.
xp detected a significant change in hardware and made me reactivate.
but that only takes a few moments.
