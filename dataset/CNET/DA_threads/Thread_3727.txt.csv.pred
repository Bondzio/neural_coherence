1.1.1	I 'm buying a new laptop for general school use and maybe some casual gaming like tekkit and stuff .	St
1.1.2	im comparing mainly dell and hp , and i had some questions about their specs 1.Dell with an i5 processor and AMD Radeon 7730m , with 6 GB RAM or HP with i7 and intel HD 4000 , with 8 GB RAM 2.How good is Intel HD 4000 , NVIDIA Geforce GT 630m , and AMD Radeon 7730m compared to each other ?	Ques
1.1.3	3.How much RAM is good for high end gaming , just so I can get a perspective ?	Ques
1.1.4	4.What is your recommended hard drive space for a laptop ?	Ques
1.1.5	4	St
1.2.1	A Yugo .	St
1.2.2	Sorry , but that question has been tossed out too many times .	St
1.2.3	As to item 2 , google like this .	St
1.2.4	NOTEBOOKCHECK GT 630M and you find that chips benchmark .	St
1.2.5	Alter it to the 7730m and compare .	St
1.2.6	Just a little work for you .	St
1.2.7	About RAM .	St
1.2.8	4 to 16GB is fine for most things .	St
1.2.9	Disk space is rather an odd question .	St
1.2.10	My work machine has 120GB , the travel laptop is only 500GB and is half or more empty so it appears that space is what you make of it .	St

1.3.1	I do n't recommend HP PCs as they tend to fall down too often , no matter if buikld right , they just do .	St
1.3.2	Next , you want gaming , laptops are n't gaming platforms .	St
1.3.3	If you do want that more than you think then look for one that actually says , its a gaming platform or system .	St
1.3.4	Anything just wo n't do or ca n't be build-up later because it 's a laptop .	St
1.3.5	So , decide what the primary usage of the laptop is and go from there .	St
1.3.6	Gaming is a killer of any PC , unless care if given in build or intense usage , no shortcuts .	St
1.3.7	If cost becomes too much of an factor then spend more to get more in the end .	St
1.3.8	It 's just better that way .	St
1.3.9	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
1.4.1	I 'm just looking for an opinion for # 1 on what compromises I should make for processor , video card , and RAM .	St
1.4.2	As for # 2 I 've checked the benchmarks but I 'd like to know from some who has used them	St
1.5.1	While I get to use many laptops , none exactly match what you noted .	St
1.5.2	Close , but no match .	St
1.5.3	The benchmarks are also close to my experiences so if you want to wait for someone that owns exactly those models , that 's fine but you may be waiting a very long time .	St
1.5.4	I can only guess you are new at this since you listed that Intel solution .	St
1.5.5	Why is that here if you want to game ?	Ques
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	I can do some basic coding like java and know a decent amount about the system , but i have no idea how the actual hardware corresponds with each other .	St
1.6.2	So far the specs on the laptop I 'm looking at is 3rd generation intel i7-3610QM ( 2.3 ghz 6mb L3 cache ) , windows 7 home premium , 8 gb DDR3 ( 2 DIMM ) , and NVIDIA geforce gt 650m with 1gb GDDR5 memory .	St
1.6.3	Any opinions ?	Ques
1.7.1	Last year I picked up a Samsung rc512 with the i7 and a nice enough GPU .	St
1.7.2	Your choice is very nice .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
