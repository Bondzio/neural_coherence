<s> I have a 3 month old Athlon 64 machine equipped with a Toshiba D/L DVD burner. </s>
<s> I have a spindle of 25 brand-new Verbatim DVD +R/W blanks that I've been successfully converting and burning some AVI movies on with the Nero suite. </s>
<s> I'd now like to dump some older viewed movies and reuse the disks. </s>
<s> I have tried on about 10 of them, to just plain flat re-record over some of them. </s>
<s> Nero reports read errors on most and on a few I get no error report, everything says 'OK' but my set-top player refuses to play them (''Check disk for errors''). </s>
<s> I then tried to erase the disks and start the whole process over. </s>
<s> Again, on trying to erase them I ran up against a few ''read errors'' but mainly the remaining disks seem useless after erasing them as Nero gives me a variety of errors when I attempt to re-record material on them. </s>
<s> Example: ''The disk is not empty'' or ''The disk is full and can't be written to''. </s>
<s> Often times Explorer will invite me to insert a disk when I just did! </s>
<s> Is there material on these re-recorded disks? </s>
<s> Nope I can't tell - neither the drive in the computer nor the set-top player will play them. </s>
<s> Windows Explorer seems to indicate they're blank CDs - not DVDs. </s>
<s> So, OK, why am I worried about a few measely disks? </s>
<s> Basically, it's not a ''few disks'' to me when the whole spindle now seems to be ready for the dumpster. </s>
<s> I don't want to waste more time and money nor proceed further until I'm sure that they are in fact toast and that I completely ensure I understand what I'm doing! </s>
<s> I have also tried Alcohol 120% to erase these - same deal. </s>
<s> Nero just barfs when I try to re-record. </s>
<s> Remember I did say I tried to just record over them too. </s>
<s> I have also tried Windows XP's own packet writing routines with the same results. </s>
<s> I even borrowed a copy of Nero 7.0 Ultra with the same results. </s>
<s> I thought highly of Verbatim products. </s>
<s> I was pretty confident the +R/W was the way to travel. </s>
<s> I thought the Toshiba drive was a good find. </s>
<s> I know my ASPI layer is current and I'm reasonably comfortable that the hardware and Nero/Alcohol 120% software is fine. </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure this is due to &quot;pilot error&quot; What's the scoop on being able to re-record and thus re-use DVD +R/W disks? </s>
<s> Is it possible and what's the correct procedure or sequence of events to follow so that I can re-use them? </s>
<s> Thank you, Group! </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;294883&Product=winxp &quot;Windows XP does not support packet writing&quot; It's possible your drive has new firmware available, but the details are not in your post for me to look it up with ease. </s>
<s> Also, I don't use any ASPI layer. </s>
<s> I can't guess why we needed that. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob for the reply. </s>
<s> OK, I see my mistake - one of mis-stating the fact. </s>
<s> Rather than say &quot;Packet Writing&quot; I should have said &quot;Windows' own native DVD handling technique (via Explorer)&quot;. </s>
<s> So, there's not packet writing in XP Pro - well and done - whatever XP has for a protocol, it fails to do what I think it should do - that is: erase the disk so I can re-use it. </s>
<s> To quickly summarize: I'm just trying to re-write over the material originally recorded. </s>
<s> I tried just re-recording over the old movies and some mistakes I made on some disks with Nero. </s>
<s> It failed. </s>
<s> I tried first erasing the recorded disks, that didn't work. </s>
<s> The firmware on the Toshiba combo drive was and is the latest according to the Toshiba site. </s>
<s> Several weeks ago, Nero's InfoTool reported that my ASPI layer was out of date and I figured that might have something to do with this so I dutifully updated it. </s>
<s> Even after that, I was still unable to get the results I think I'm supposed to get - to re-use the DVD +R/W disks. </s>
<s> And just maybe that's what my problem is - I expect to be able to re-use these and I can't because of some limitation I'm unaware of. </s>
<s> But then I think, &quot;Why would they call them 'rewritables' (+R/W) if weren't designed so?&quot; I believe you should be able to re-write over these, correct? </s>
<s> And if so, I've only recorded on them once, maybe twice on a few at the most. </s>
<s> So I don't think they're bad necessarily. </s>
<s> So why is this process not able to work for me? </s>
<s> Again, I figure it's got to be some step I'm missing. </s>
<s> Does that help?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> XP has no protocol for this at all. </s>
<s> Let me share that ASPI layers are something I eschewed years ago in favor of the new ways. </s>
<s> You must have installed items not listed. </s>
<s> But it matters not as I'll just share a free tool I use to erase and do most of what I need to do with both CDR/W and DVDR/W media. </s>
<s> Look up CDBURNERXP at download.com Bob </s>
