I tried dsl reports to get test but can not see my ip. I went into linksys router setup page and changed the block wan so my ip could be seen.. but to no avail.. it is not working. so I have only comcast ip.. and speed test show below average for cable.. also for some weird reason on pcpitstop 2 d video is very POOR!
