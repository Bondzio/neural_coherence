<s> The problem started sometime ago. </s>
<s> When i turn on my pc, i hear 3 beeps and then everything goes dead! </s>
<s> I thought it was a hardware problem so after experimenting i got the pc to work by removing RAM, turning on pc, let it display a memory missing screen, turn off without saving configuration, reinsert RAM and turn on PC. </s>
<s> The boot up takes atleast 1 min while the welcome screen takes ages to appear and once it is there, it displays &quot;windows is starting up&quot;, the logon takes a year and then another for loading the startup apps. </s>
<s> But as soon as it is done,the PC goes back to normal.It works fine without any freezes or lacking.I play games, surf the web, listen to music,etc. </s>
<s> The shut down is no problem at all but the same thing happens the next time i bootup! </s>
<s> Pliz help, this is very annoying! </s>
<s> Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> Approx age of PC might help too. </s>

<s> I have Compaq Evo D500 small form factor, P4 processor, 512 RAM. </s>
<s> OS is XP Pro SP2. </s>
<s> The PC is about 2 years old. </s>
<s> anything else? </s>
<s> Any form of help is greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> A common cause is the video card has come unplugged. </s>
<s> I don't see where you tell us you opened it up to check all cards, connections. </s>
<s> Another 3 beeps is NO RAM. </s>
<s> Just a few months back someone brought one in and we opened it up and there was no RAM. </s>
<s> Good thing we did or I bet they would claim we took the RAM. </s>

<s> Might start by replacing the CMOS battery. </s>
<s> Usually a CR2032 Make sure the power supply plus the CPU heatsink and fans are free of dust. </s>

<s> Thanks for posting. </s>
<s> Anything else???? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> did you check the manual for the motherboard to see why it would create the 3 beeps youre getting? </s>
<s> prolly a good place to start. </s>
<s> Is it the RAM or the video card? </s>
<s> How do i know? </s>
<s> Is there any diagnostic tool? </s>
<s> I think its the RAM because only boots when i reinsert it. </s>
<s> Besides my RAM overheated recently (dont know why), i got it replaced so its practically brand new. </s>
<s> And i dont have any manuals. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
