hi, i am planning on getting a new video card, since my old nvidia geforce fx 5200 is fried after i overclocked it, and i'm wondering if anyone can tell me if a nvidia geforce fx 5700ve is a killer card for gaming.
i mean, if it is, would it be better than a 5700le or a 5700 ultra.
by the way, the card is pny brand.
