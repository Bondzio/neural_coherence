Does anyone know which TV tuner/capture cards will work and work well with Vista Home Premium 64 bit.
My WinTV PVR2 worked great with Vista 32 bit but has no drivers for 64 bit.
Please Help.
Running an Athlon 64X2 6400+ on a ASUS M2N-SLI Deluxe motherboard with 4 gigs of PC 6400 DDR2-800 MHz memory.
