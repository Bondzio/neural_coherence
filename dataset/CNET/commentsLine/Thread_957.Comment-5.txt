thanks again for the response bob.
i was also wondering if any of the products found here:  would be as good or better as the 3347 i currently have.
i'll be honest with you.
i am fairly good with computers and programming, but for some reason this whole networking/router/modem thing is throwing me for a loop.
i don't know if i am suffering from information overload or what, but i am having trouble with it so i would like to k.i.s.s.
it if at all possible.
any suggestions would be wonderful.
thanks.
