i find many to get uppity as they begin the learning process that transfer rate over the wire is not any indication of the overall speed of the transfer.
yes, 800 should result in lower times but in my experience it never cut a 10 second transfer down to 5 seconds.
as to the slower sata drive that's easy.
even sata 1.5gbs is faster than 800 so you should not see any measurable change from sata 3gbs to that.
yes the drive seek time changes have more of an impact but you knew that.
as to the tutorial i suggest you keep reading and reading and after a few months it will start to make sense.
i like our classes when we read about amdahl's laws and think it applies here.
this and thinking about this like the slowest link in the chain sets the speed.
however the read and write speeds of drives are far lower than the transfer rate of the interfaces.
