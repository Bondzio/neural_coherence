I purchased an FP988D through Tiger Direct in November, submitted the rebate forms immediately, and 5 months later have yet to recieve my $90. I've spoken with TY, the head of their rebate department, he's a *@#%!? liar, not mention his &quot;Flaming&quot; temper when I called him on his lies. Bottom Line - the monitor will cost you $90 more than the advertised price - buy a reputable brand from from a reputable vendor!

I will never shop at tigerdirect.com again. They offer great rebates on everything but you must pay more in advance and hope you get your rebate. I'll just pay an extra $20 next time somewhere else to avoid the hassle and risk of the rebate.
