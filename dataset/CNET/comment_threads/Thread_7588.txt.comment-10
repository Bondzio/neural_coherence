While HP would be the first company of choice for something like a B&W laser printer for a desktop or laptop system they rank rather low on my list.
They seem to forget they even made a system once it's out of production.
They do very little if any driver support for systems once they are out of production.
While I know many people don't like DELL at least you can go to their supprot web site and get drivers for any OS the system migth support for any componets taht DELL originally supplied.
I can pull up a support page for a 5+ year old system from DELL and download XP drivers.
I have an HP laptop that had a video driver bug and even while it was new no driver update ever became available.
I've tried to help a few others with similar issues on old HP systems desktops and aptops and found the same thing.
Hardware custom modified for HP no supported by the componet manfacture and not supported by HP.
Now for their laser printers I can pull up may old workhorse printers and get current drivers.
