<s> Hi I am asking for help for purchasing a compact printer. </s>
<s> The saleman recommended a hp photosmart A716,but I was wondering about the Canon Pixma Mini260 or the Epson compact photo-printers. </s>
<s> Any advise would be greatly appreciated as I did buy the HP A716, but I have not opened it thinking it was not the right choice. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I almost picked up one until I calculated the per print price. </s>
<s> For me the at home print convenience didn't make the cut to add one of these printers. </s>
<s> Check out the CNet reviews and note the per copy print costs to help you decide. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
