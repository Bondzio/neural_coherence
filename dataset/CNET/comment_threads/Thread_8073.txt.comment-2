The office works on apps so at my desk I have the Nexus 7 32GB and a tf300t Transformer.
But the problem as I see it is I don't see how you could replace the common laptop with either.
I did stumble over a deal for an Asus for 300 which is pretty nice if touchscreen is what you were after.
It was a refurb and the office popped for it and it's not bad.
