thanks.
i disconnected one wire from the router and then reconnectged it and tried again.
i got a connection on the other desktop, but the signal was so low, i couldn't connect to the internet.
i am on the laptop now so that gives me more information, but doesn't clarify what the real problem is.
i have heard that vertical connections work better than horizontal ones.
