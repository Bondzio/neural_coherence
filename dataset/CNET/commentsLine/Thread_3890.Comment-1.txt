hi everybody here is the scenario: i was trying to remove the pre-installed windows 8. i figured i should create a backup in case i ever have to go back to the piece of junk software.
anyway, i plugged-in my external hard drive to make the backup... here's the **ck up: it said 'formatting drive'.
within two seconds, i cancelled the operation and removed the hard drive.
now, when i try to access it (tried on 3 other laptops), it just shows the hard drive as recovery disk with some 20mb data and total 30 gb space.
disk management shows 890 gb unallocated space.
it's a seagate 1tb backup drive.
there was nearly 500 gb of data on it.
do i need to use some data recovery program or is there another way.
i don't think an entire hard drive can be formatted in 2 seconds.
can someone please help.
i can't stress enough how important the data on the drive is to me.
regards stished
