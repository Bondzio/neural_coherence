uhuh.
watching too many movies again.
i mean the 4 parts to get a beep.
notice a case is not in the list.
the list: 1. motherboard.
2. cpu (with heatsink/fan.)
3. power supply.
(yup, you need the ac cord.)
4. the speaker (connected to the motherboard...) when i find a dead dead unit i strip it down to these 4 pieces.
if it powers up and beeps i start adding parts.
if it doesn't power up i'm looking at 4 possibly bad parts.
