this is one of the many reasons cisco and all other vpn vendors have gone to ssl tunneling.
if your vpn device is newer it may support this and it uses activex and java so you do not need to install anything on the client.
you solution mostly depends on how the vpn gateway is setup.
if it only allows ipsec then you must configure your router to pass all udp 500 and all protocol 50 to your pc.
since 50 is not port it is a protocol you cannot just use simple port forwarding to make this work.
you need to somehow forward udp port 500 and this protocol to you virtual address.
how exactly you do this really depends on the router.
if your vpn gateway can run natt you need to make sure udp port 4500 passes your router.
since you are having a issue i suspect your router does not support natt by default.
you should be able to map udp port 4500 to your pc.
you may have to change your vpn client to force it to run natt but the vpn gateway must be configured to accept this also.
your last option if you are using certain cisco gateways and clients is to use ipsec over tcp.
this is a something only cisco supports.
this only requires the option to be available on both the vpn gateway and the client it does not require any change on your router.
if you have the option i would go to the new ssl vpn these tend to work on almost any machine and behind any router.
