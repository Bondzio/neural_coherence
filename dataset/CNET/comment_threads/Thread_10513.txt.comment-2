Have you read the router's manual.
It should describe how to add a wireless equipped computer to the network.
My guess is your router either has wireless security turned on and/or an access only by MAC ID list set up.
Link a computer into the router via ethernet cable and address the router's user interface using your browser (see manual for how).
Turn off wireless security and the acccess list.
See if new computer can then connect.
Add wireless security passphrase to new computer's wireless interface and turn router's wireless security back on.
