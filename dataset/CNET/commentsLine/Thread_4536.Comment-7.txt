gateway offers a limited number of graphics upgrades but any of the cards i mentioned will work in the pc.
gateway's price on the 8800gts is reasonable especially since they will pre-install it for you.
the x1900 crossfire won't match the all-around performance of the 8800gts.
as i said before, if you don't have the budget for the 8800gts, get what you can afford from the earlier list.
