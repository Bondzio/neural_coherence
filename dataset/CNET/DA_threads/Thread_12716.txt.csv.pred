1.1.1	Hello .	St
1.1.2	I just replaced my Comcast rental modem with a Motorola SB6141 .	St
1.1.3	I called Comcast to have them add it to my services .	St
1.1.4	This worked fine , and I am able to connect a computer via ethernet to my new modem with no problem .	St
1.1.5	However , when I go to connect a router to it I get no internet signal .	St
1.1.6	Are there any addition step ( s ) that I need to take to get my router to work ?	Ques
1.1.7	Any help is greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.8	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	There 's an option in most routers to clone the MAC address .	St
1.2.2	You might try that .	Sug
1.2.3	I 'm using the Comcast modem these days , but for several years I used a Motorola modem myself & never had a problem .	St
1.2.4	I think I did set the router to clone the MAC address FWIW .	St
1.2.5	` Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	Thank you so much for your response .	St
1.3.2	But I 'm a little new to this ; how exactly do I go about cloning the MAC address ?	Ques
1.3.3	Thanks again for your help .	St
1.4.1	Usually there 's a specific address you type into your browser like 192.168.xxx.yyy to access the router .	St
1.4.2	Once there you 'll be prompted for the admin ID and password .	St
1.4.3	After signing in you 'll get a menu of options that will be documented in the router 's user guide .	St
1.4.4	They differ from one make and model , so you 'll just have to look and see where the option is , but it 's usually not that hard to find - you can often just browse through the half dozen or so menus and stumble across it .	St
1.4.5	` Good luck .	Polite
