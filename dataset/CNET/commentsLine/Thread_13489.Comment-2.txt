i am looking at new external hard drives to replace the (not very old, not very cheap) maxtor 3000 dv that doesn't seem to be vista compatible.
of course, i'm not totally sure, as the vista system isn't set up yet, since i'm taking the time to move 60gigs of data to my laptop over my home lan just in case.
i can't really find info that says for sure if the maxtor will or won't work with vista (though it seems likelier it won't).
finding a new external drive that is for sure vista compatible is extremely frustrating.
am i missing some shortcut?
