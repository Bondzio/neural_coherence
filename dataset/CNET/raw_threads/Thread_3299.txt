Got it connected to my network and in the process I found that the drive needed to be formatted in EXT3. Never heard of it before. I used the NAS and it's software to format the drive and it works perfectly. A short search said EXT3 was a Linux format. Anyone know why the drive had to use that format? Is that standard?
