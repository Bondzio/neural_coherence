why the static ipaddresses?
did your isp provide you with those numbers?
if they provide you only one ipaddress, then you better have a router after your modem.
your switch is not going to help you.
if you have one ipaddress from your isp, does your modem have router function?
you don't really need a switch unless you don't have enough ports on the router for all your computers which possibly is your case.
more info please.
