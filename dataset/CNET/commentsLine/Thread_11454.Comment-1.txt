i have a dell 4400 running windows xp home.
i presently have 256mb of memory.
i would like to upgrade and add 512mb.
it takes ddr pc2100 memory.
dell says i should buy their memory for $100 but i can find the same memory specs for less than $50.
what gives?
do i really have to spend the dell price for an upgrade?
anyone else done this successfully?
thanks
