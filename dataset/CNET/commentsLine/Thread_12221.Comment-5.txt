ok, thanks for the reply.
i think this is getting overly complicated.
let's forget about the ability of other users to write or modify files on the shared hd.
let's just assume i want to put some files onto a hd and give read and download access to another user, and maybe even public read-only access to specific files or folders.
this latter requirement is not absolute.. it would just make it easier to share photos, movies, flash files, etc, that i can link to externally,, ie, from a blog.
thus, i can give my buddy complete read only access to the entire drive (or the majority of folders on it), and specific read-only access to everyone for specific files.
can this be easily achieved?
should i use a network drive, or use xp file sharing to accomplish this?
can i also set it so that only i can write to the drive (any file, or folder) from either my desktop system, or my notebook (both behind the dlink firewall) in such a case, there is no need for &quot;synchronization&quot;.
right?
or maybe i am misunderstanding what synchronization is all about?
