1.1.1	hey.. im having some problems with my IDE hard drive... the other day i started up my computer and it said hard drive error.. then i tried going in to windows repair and tried fixmbr.	St
1.1.2	after i did that i tried to restart and got the same error.. i tried to go into windows repair again from the windows xp setup cdrom, but this time it wont even recognize the drive.. i went into bios and it can still find my drive, but windows cannot find it.	St
1.1.3	i also tried using mbr repair software, but they cant find the drive either.	St
1.1.4	only bios can find the drive.	St

1.2.1	make sure your ide cable is firmly seated to the motherboard and the drive.	Sug
1.2.2	if that doesn't help, try moving the cable to a different ide port on the motherboard.	St
1.3.1	Then add the other as slave later to see if I can copy files out.	St
1.3.2	Nothing in your post suggests another course of action.	St
1.3.3	You could try the drive maker's test program but after seeing this story too many times I skip that and move right for the kill.	Sug
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	Try changing your ide cable.if that doesnt work get your hard disk change coz the platters in it has got damaged	St
