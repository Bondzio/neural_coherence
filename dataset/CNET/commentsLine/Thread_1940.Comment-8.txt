at best buy i spoke with an epson rep and saw a demo on the rx600.
the only demo he would offer was a glossy print from a digital camery media card.
i must say that the print quality was excelent, butttt it took over 2 minutes to print one 4x6.
this time was very excessive for me and did not include photo set up, it was actual print time only.
i print many photos and think i would get frustrated at the time involved.
i wonder what it would to print an 8x10?
i did not get to scan or copy any items.
i am also concerned about the many ink cartridges.
although this does produce a beter quality photo print, i again would get frustrated that i might be constsntly replacing or the other.
many reviews i have read on the rx600 state time and ink usage is poor, but quality is excellent( due to higher max resolution of 5780 compared to 4800) i plan on a trip to staples or best buy to attempt comparisions on scanning time and quality, and document printing.
one very important feature is that the hp 2610 has stand alone fax capabilities, the rx600 does not fax.
if you are interested in wireless, the hp model 2710 has a built wireless capabilities and a larer lcd screen.
i hope to read more opinions on these two printers, but for now i prefer the hp2610.
has anyone considered or reviewed the lexmark p6250?
