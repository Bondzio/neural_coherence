You need a router, unless your modem has router functionality.
You could set up an ICS, but it just complicates the setup.
If you want a wired router, find one that will have enough ports to accommodate all your computers.
If you want a wireless router, you should be able to find one with at least 3 or 4 ports to accommodate your wired computers.
You can also connect your switch to the router make room for more computers.
