because you didn't tell us which printer.
two things i would do.
1. go to the brother site and look for updated drivers.
2. look for a device conflict.
control panel, system, hardware, device manager.
with the printer turned on, click the mouse and other point devices + sign and double click the mouse.
click the resources tab.
if there's a conflict, options to correct this will be displayed.
