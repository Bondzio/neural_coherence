at home we don't run the wifi 24x7.
only when needed.
i also enabled mac filtering so only my laptop and one other machine can connect.
since the setup is wep enabled, mac filtered and no sharing besides the printer is done, it's about as tight as it gets.
when the laptop boots, it connects to the last network (mine) and all is well.
if mine is down, it would find another (linksys!!!
fix that!)
but clicking the the utility and then the network i want puts me back in my network.
i did change rf channels to as far away as the other networks i see.
best of luck, bob
