with two different channel, i can still share file and printer.. right?
i.e.
read/write and print to a laptop that connected in different channel.. as for security, like i mention in my post, the 'open wifi network' is turn off/on as needed (when a there is a guess) as for putting or letting the guess in dmz zone, this involving ap/router configuration everytime a guess is coming.. correct?
thank you
