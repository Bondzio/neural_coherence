<s> Connect A Lt To Dsl With A Pc WINME DSL LINKSYS-Wireless G-214 I have a PC connected to the Internet with DSL which works fine. </s>
<s> For Father's day my son bought me a Laptop which I also want to connect to the internet along with my PC. </s>
<s> I tried to connect my LT to the Internet using my LIINKSYS, but I just can't do it using my DSL Modem and my LINKSYS. </s>
<s> Please explain to me in simple language how I can connect my LT to the Internet along with my PC? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> what kind of internet service you have. </s>
<s> DSL or cable by what company. </s>
<s> You don't say what Model your LT is, but I assume it has a network plug-in, you may also need to make a change in the bios to initialize the network connection, but if there is no option in the bios you may have to set up a new network connection in Windows. </s>
<s> Also are you testing the connection from the linksys with the same cable as with your PC? </s>
<s> If you are using a separate cable you can check if that is okay, by substituting it with the cable you use for the PC. </s>
<s> i have a dsl ...a wirespeed westell modem, n a linksys router </s>
