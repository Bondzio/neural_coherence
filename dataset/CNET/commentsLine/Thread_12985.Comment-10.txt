think about the difficulty of moving the laser at the speed that the cds/dvds move at now in order to access the data stored on them and you will have your answer about &quot;scanning the laser&quot; it doesn't really relate to the way a tv works in my opinion.
flash drives are great for specialized applications as some people previously mentioned.
we (my company of employ)use them in embedded systems that operate in environments that a hdd wouldn't survive the first 30 seconds.
that being said as people have also mentioned the life span of these flash memory devices is paltry and they cost an arm and a leg.
in other words we won't be seeing solid state hdd as a norm any time soon, but i wouldn't say more than 10 years, thats a mighty long time in the technology world.
just think ten years ago we had first gen pentiums and hds that weren't even a gig...
