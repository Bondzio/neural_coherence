<s> My Lacie D2 Quadra is lying on a flat surface, and has been working for a year or so. </s>
<s> It has begun to click repeatedly for about two clicks a second. </s>
<s> Along with the clicking, though, I can hear the disk whirring up and then slowing, and trying again and again. </s>
<s> It won't mount to OS X. </s>
<s> Now obviously this is quite a problem, but how can I solve it? </s>
<s> I will take it to a repair shop if I have to, but the shops around my area cost megamoney. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> The case failure is common and cheap to replace. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
