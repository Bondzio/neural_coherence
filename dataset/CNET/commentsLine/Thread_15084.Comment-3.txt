my take is you might see some difference as a result of adding a newer drive but that will be largely because of the the greater data density per platter (areal density), vice the 16mb cache buffer.
hdd mfgs have managed to increase the data density per platter significantly over the past few years from 10gbs, 15gbs and 20gbs/platter to 100gbs or 125gbs per platter.
so if you look at hdds that rotate at the same speed, 7,200 rpm (some ides run at 10k rpms), but the data density increases significantly over the same distance ... it stands to reason there will be some increased speed for both disk reads and writes due to increased data density alone.
the question is, if the files are relatively small, how much gain will you actually see the day-to-day or normal use of your computer ?
hope this helps.
