<s> I have tried everything I can to get my microphone to work, and it is still too quiet. </s>
<s> I am using an old microphone, but I know it is still a good mic because it works fine on my laptop, but is too quiet to be of any use on my desktop. </s>
<s> The sound card I am using is the card built into my motherboard, which is an MSI motherboard. </s>
<s> The driver it uses is is the Realtek AC'97 Audio driver. </s>
<s> Here is a quick list of everything I have tried: 1. </s>
<s> The mic is plugged into the correct input. </s>
<s> I know this because the microphone does give me a little input, but it's too quiet to be useful. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I turned on the 20 dB Mic boost in the advanced microphone volume. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> After this I turned the Microphone volume all the way up under volume control, and tried recording. </s>
<s> This is the first time I could hear the recording, but I have to turn the speakers up all the way to hear it. </s>
<s> Also, the microphone volume shouldn't have to be all the way up. </s>
<s> On my laptop I usually have it around 50%-70% of the max volume. </s>
<s> Obviously it isn't being boosted enough. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> To try to improve this, I reinstalled the Audio driver, and that didn't help. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> I tried changing settings on the Sound effects manager that comes with the audio driver, and nothing there helped. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> I tried changing settings on the audio recording programs I was using, and neither the standard Windows Sound Recorder nor Audacity had settings I could change to boost input. </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> I tried reinstalling Audacity, and that didn't help. </s>
<s> All the other forums have said that if those steps don't work, then I need to get a new mic, but I know that it isn't the mic that is the problem because it works just fine on my laptop. </s>
<s> Is there anything else I haven't tried that would boost the input level? </s>
<s> Are there any settings in Audacity that would boost the input while recording? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help. </s>
