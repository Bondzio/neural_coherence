Any suggestions ? WinXP Home SP3. Maybe how or where to get the driver, or how to install using the add new hardware wizard, whatever.

I have never installed a logitech driver, all my mice have always worked great, how ever in this case, it does not work properly in the usb and does not work anymore in my ps/2 port with the adapter although all my other mice have, what I would like to do is either figure out why it is messing up the left click usinbg usb, see when playing tha game q3 arena as I explained it keeps firing, I cna even type a message, it will stop then hit enter to send my message and it keeps on firing, OR find the ps/2 compatible mouse section of the mouse and other pointing devices in my add new hardware wizard, IF I can do that the ps/2 port just may work again.

Unfortunately the was Logitechs replacement for the MX518 which could utilize a ps/2 port, this G400 can not. I ASSumed... But I do still have this sometimes not firing and sometimes stuck left click issue.
