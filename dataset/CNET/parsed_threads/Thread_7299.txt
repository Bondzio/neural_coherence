<s> I just bought two new Laptop, with Windows xp pro-sp2 (OEM), both are wireless ready. </s>
<s> When I use a cable (hardwired) they get the IP as it should. </s>
<s> Problem is, when I try to connect/join my existing wireless lan, those two laptop unable to get an IP address, what they get is 169.xxx.xxx.xxx (the Wifi icon has yellow triangle in it - 'Limited or no connectivity' or 'unable to get an IP address'. </s>
<s> Is there some setting I should look for? </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure this is a Windows XP-SP2 related problem, because when my other laptop with Windows XP pro-sp1, join the Wireless lan, it has no problem at all... </s>
<s> Thank You for any help and information. </s>
<s> It's unlikely to be XP-SP2, but many like to toss that about. </s>
<s> The problem I see is you didn't share the make/model laptop. </s>
<s> For instance some require you to turn on the Wifi card and some require you to do other steps. </s>
<s> Too bad you didn't tell more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry about that, the Laptop is Acer 3200 folio design and Acer Ferrari 3400. </s>
<s> Note: There is a button near the keyboard to enabled/disabled Wifi Lan. </s>
<s> I don't relize if there is another setting to turn on the Wifi... (Yes I heard that I have to turn on the wifi, but, where it is .. if this applicable to my laptop) Thank You again for the help </s>
<s> I tried to fill in the IP manually, the Icon in the Taskbar showed - connected with strong and excellent signal - But still I can not browse the Internet... </s>
<s> Tried Turn On and Turn Off the Firewall, same result... Any suggestion on what should I do or check?? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Nothing noted about the wireless access point configuration. </s>
<s> Some try to do all the WEP, filters or install a firewall before they get it working... Bob </s>
<s> Basically I'm saying the current wireless/wired lan is working. </s>
<s> Because My friend New Laptop with windows XP pro SP1, get connected with no problem, that also why I suspecting the SP2 setting The access point is dhcp 'disabled', using WEP security, Channel is 'Auto' (it get the IP from the router which is dhcp enabled). </s>
<s> The Firewall I'm talking about is Windows XP firewall (this is a brand new laptop, with standard 4 software Adaware, Spybot SD, Spywareblaster and AVG 7 free) While using manual IP, I can ping the router but not external address.. when I use the dhcp enable on the laptop (I get 169.xxx.xxx.xxx) I can not ping anything. </s>
<s> Note: just incase you are wondering that my home wireless lan is at fault, tonight I will try in different Lan location (A friend house or in the office) Thank You </s>
<s> &quot;The access point is dhcp 'disabled'&quot; At this point I can't help you further. </s>
<s> Such a setup is something not stock for such systems. </s>
<s> Someone made a choice and they'll have to tell you how it's supposed to work that way. </s>
<s> It's my choice to start with stock settings, get it working and then move to other settings. </s>
<s> In closing, my neighbor just a few weeks ago pulled a Windows XP SP2 new laptop out and we just connected just fine. </s>
<s> But we use almost all the stock settings in the router such as DHCP and more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ok.. (currently the router is releasing the dhcp not the AP) ... </s>
<s> I'll try it on other location... Just wondered .. why that setup is work on other laptop but not on this two.. </s>
<s> Thank You... </s>
<s> I can't answer this since the configuration of what works is not known to me. </s>
<s> Why is DHCP disabled? </s>
<s> This was never shared. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The access point is separate unit from the router... both have DHCP functionality.. that is why I disabled the one in Access point. </s>
<s> Cable Modem -&gt; Router --&gt; (AP + Laptop + Desktop) The Router is configured as 'default' .. 192.168.1.1 and dhcp enabled. </s>
<s> The point is that Network is working fine with that setup .. and the new laptop is in default configuration ... </s>
<s> I'm going to a friend house (different network layout) and try to see what happened there... back in about 6 hours .. till then .. </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> Why wasn't this revealed earlier? </s>
<s> As it stands, it sounds as if you assigned some IP to the wired connection. </s>
<s> If so, for instance 192.168.1.5 (for argument since you didn't tell) would be on the wired interface with a netmask of 255.255.255.0 With the IP assigned to the wired interface, the wireless (WIFI) will never work since the route is &quot;occupied&quot;. </s>
<s> I find it interesting you are doling out the needed information to find what's going on. </s>
<s> That's your choice, but it may explain why support for your setup is problematic. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, I didn't said anything about IP address etc. </s>
<s> because I thought it doesn't matter, since the wired/wireless network is already work... and so I didn't thought of the Network/LAN problem... Now the problem is solved... </s>
<s> But don't ask what I do or How do I do it... because I didn't do anything... nothing is change. </s>
<s> I tried at my friend house, it get connected as it supposed to be.. (Turn on the laptop, and get connection.. nothing change) Then just as soon as I get back home, I also get connected, and able to browse the internet normally... My guest is the Wifi Signal became very low, while i'm trying the laptop... </s>
<s> Anyway, Thank you for all the help and information. </s>
