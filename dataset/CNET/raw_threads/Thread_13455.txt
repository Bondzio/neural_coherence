The problem is i seem to be buying ink more frequently than i use it. It uses 5 different ink tanks. I dont know if the ink dries up after a certain period of time. I rarely print, maybe once a month. I mostly print text documents. My question is, what would be the best printer for someone who rarely prints?

SAMSUNG HAS HORRIBLE TECH SUPPORT! Either buy something so cheap you don't care if it breaks or get something where you can get some kind of third party warranty so you don't have to deal with the manufacturers. SAMSUNG is atrocious, HP totally sucks and I stopped buying their stuff after something like 11 printers. I'm a loyal customer but enough's enough! I would recommend a cheap, samsung laser but after my horrible experience with them with TWO printers, I can't ask someone else to go through the same stuff that I have. HEre's an idea of what I've been through and this is the current printer. http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1003&message=41729206 George
