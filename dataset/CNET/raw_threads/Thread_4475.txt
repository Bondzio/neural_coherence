I want to put some security cameras in an office and be able to monitor the cameras over the net live and automatically keep the most recent video on a hard drive on a remote computer. Thank you.

This card and software does all that. http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=RW-1120R&cat=VID I used the earlier 8 port cards and a pair of them. Done. This is not an offer to be interviewed further about this product. Read and digest. Bob
