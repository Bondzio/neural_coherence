i went to the mac store today and the sales guy told me that i should base my decision on what i can afford .
i decided i am going to get an imac for now and then in a year or two when i have more $$ i will invest in the mac pro.i am going to research and see if i can sell my g4 and get something for it.
plus i just applied for a mac visa credit card and well see if i am approved.
* all the advantages of a visa credit card * no interest for up to 90 days for today's purchase (2) * itunes reward points with every purchase * open line of credit up to $25,000 (4) * no prepayment penalty * no annual fee * flexible spending
