<s> Hi, I have just built myself a new computer system. </s>
<s> Everything works great except when I try to watch DVDs on it. </s>
<s> I put in a DVD, and sometimes it gets as far as letting me choose a program to open it with (e.g. </s>
<s> WinDVD) and other times it doesn't even get that far, then the computer freezes and displays the blue screen of death which includes &quot;bad_pool_header&quot; while it does a memory dump. </s>
<s> The windows &quot;problem reports and solutions&quot; page says that it is a problem with the device driver, which I'm assuming is the driver for the DVD drive? </s>
<s> But how would this be the problem if windows installed it automatically when I setup the computer? </s>
<s> The DVD drive is a Sony NEC Optiarc and is connected by a normal IDE cable to the motherboard. </s>
<s> I was thinking about trying to see if everything would work ok if I installed Windows XP instead, but preferably I don't want to have to dual boot each time I want to watch a DVD! </s>
<s> It is annoying. </s>
<s> Has anyone seen this problem before? </s>
<s> Could it be a damaged motherboard/cable/DVD drive or is it more likely just to be a software problem? </s>
<s> Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> If anymore information is needed just ask. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> This is more likely to be an issue with the DVD player software or other drivers for video, sound card or chipset. </s>
<s> To help figure out which try to play the DVD with VLC PLAYER (google.com) Bob </s>
