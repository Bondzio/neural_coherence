hi, now since according to what you are saying that the computer just shuts down automatically or abruptly, u might want to check the processor fan and heatsink assembly for seating problems.
make sure that the fan and heatsink assembly you have installed are of good quality and it is seated properly otherwise you might encounter overheating problems in the future also.
