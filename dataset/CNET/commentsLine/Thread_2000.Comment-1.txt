i have been struggling for a couple months now to get my computer to burn a dvd-r disk.
the computer works fine with +r but when i try to create a -r the disk writes a little information on the disk and then the drive and computer lockup.
i have tried just about everything i can think of without lick.
drive type - i currently have an i/o magic drive but even purchased an pioneer.
with the i/o magic i could write +r but not -r. with the pioneer i could not get either to work.
windows - i was using windows2000 but just spent the weekend upgrading to windows xp and it has the same result.
software - i have used many software packages including nero, roxio, and pinnacle.
disk types - i have tried both teon and verbatim disks.
i have read other forums and found others having similar situations but no smoking gun.
ideas welcome!
