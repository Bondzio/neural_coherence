1.2.4	The motherboard chipset driver ( VIA K8M800 ) needs an update .	St

1.2.6	http : //www.via.com.tw/en/products/chipsets/k8-series/k8m800/ ( about chipset ) http : //www.viaarena.com/default.aspx ? PageID=420 & OSID=1 & CatID=1070 ( first item ) Then again , the device could be a dud .	St

1.3.1	You should be getting something in your device manager .	St
1.3.2	At very least you should have a device with a splat next to it .	St
1.3.3	The splats are usually driver problems .	St
1.3.4	If you do find a splat delete it ( or them ) and reboot your machine .	St
1.3.5	This can be caused by older devices causing IRQ conflicts .	St
1.3.6	Installing new devices seems to aggrevate the issue and new devices just do n't work for some reason even though they are PNP .	St
