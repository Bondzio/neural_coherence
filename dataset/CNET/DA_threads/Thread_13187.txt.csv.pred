1.1.1	Okay so I 've gone through like 4 computers in the past year ( jeez , I know ! )	St
1.1.2	and I finally received one that has a wonderful DVD drive !	St
1.1.3	I like this one .	St
1.1.4	Which is why I decided to buy a video card for it ( uh-oh , investing in a computer when so many have been sucking ! ? )	Ques
1.1.5	so I could play the Sims and WoW .	St
1.1.6	I must feed my addiction .	St
1.1.7	Anyway .	St
1.1.8	The ISSUE .	St
1.1.9	I purchased a Sparkle GeForce 8400 GS Video Card - 512MB DDR2 , PCI , DVI , VGA , S-Video from Tigerdircet.com .	St
1.1.10	I really do n't know much about computers and the guys on Yahoo !	St
1.1.11	Answers said this video card will be fine and a whole bunch of garbage about how PCI express is better ( I know that , I did my research , but this beast of a computer is a PCI dealio !	St
1.1.12	) , so I went with the card .	St
1.1.13	I got it and ran to install it , the generic & quot ; quick install guide & quot ; confusing me a bit , but it 's not too hard to figure out .	St
1.1.14	I got excited and turned on the computer .	St
1.1.15	BAM .	St
1.1.16	No video on the monitor .	St
1.1.17	Like , wtf ?	Ques
1.1.18	So I try it in all the ports ( I have 3 ) and cleaned everything up ( carefully ) , but I keep having to revert to the motherboard video card .	St
1.1.19	So I start looking up help from Sparkle ( why should n't the manufacturer be able to help me ? ) .	St
1.1.20	I registered my product and all that jazz , went to tech support , and the site had the nerve to ask me questions such as : What 's your motherboard model NO ?	Ques
1.1.21	Memory Type and Capacity ?	Ques
1.1.22	Power Supply Wattage ?	Ques
1.1.23	Brand of Power Supply ?	Ques
1.1.24	Blah blah blah ?	Ques
1.1.25	So I decided to get on the forums of CNET before I call and talk to some Indian guy for an hour to get nowhere .	St
1.1.26	Let me tell you what 's a bit sketchy .	St
1.1.27	The box has a bunch of stickers on it .	St
1.1.28	The one with my model and serial numbers is right ( M/N : SF-PC84GS512U2LP ) , but there 's one that has a picture of a PCI express card .	St
1.1.29	Uhh , not what I ordered .	St
1.1.30	Plus , when I went online to download a thorough manual , it was only for AGP or PCI Express .	St
1.1.31	When I clicked the manual for my specific card !	St
1.1.32	The box does n't even look how it should .	St
1.1.33	I do n't think I have a PCI express card because it does n't have any hangy-downer-things ( excuse my unsophistication , that 's just how much I need help ) .	St
1.1.34	So yeah .	Res
1.1.35	Anybody have any ideas as to why I ca n't get video ?	Ques
1.1.36	And where can I find the info Sparkle was asking for me ?	Ques
1.1.37	( Please bear in mind I do NOT have any manuals .	St
1.1.38	Which is why I came here . )	St
1.1.39	Thank yuh !	St
1.2.1	I wo n't duplicate the web but why should it work ?	Ques
1.2.2	You did n't write much about the host machine and maybe it 's one you have to change the bios ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
