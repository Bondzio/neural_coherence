<s> hi, i have a 500GB seagate external hard drive with 4 partitions managed by seagate manager.the problem is it works ok sometimes,but all of a sudden it says 'delayed write error'.if i disconnect the drive and reconnect it after a system restart it works ok again for a while,but again after a while the same error comes up. </s>
<s> is there any permanent fix for this problem?or is there something wrong with the drive? </s>
<s> Please help me. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Things you can try: 1. </s>
<s> Format the partition(s) on the drive (you'll lose all the data, of course). </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Get the drive out of the enclosure and put in a new enclosure. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Try another cable on another USB-port. </s>
<s> If none of the 3 help, buy another drive. </s>

<s> if the drive passes their diagnostic test ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> hi, ran the short test in the seagate tool:SeaTools.The drive failed the test. </s>
<s> Is there anything else to do with the tool to fix the problem? </s>
<s> Is it still under warranty and do you need any of the data on the external ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Turn off the function that spins down the drive after inactivity. </s>
<s> I think it may default to 15 minutes. </s>
<s> Windows wants continuous access to all drives and doesn't like when one spins down. </s>
<s> I had to do that with my Seagate external. </s>
