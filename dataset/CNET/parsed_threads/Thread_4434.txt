<s> I have a secure wireless network. </s>
<s> About once or twice a day I see my wireless connection bar go down and down until I totally get kicked off my network. </s>
<s> The only way to fix it is to run upstairs and unplug the router and plug it back in. </s>
<s> This works until I have to go do it again, and again, and again. </s>
<s> There our some wireless networks around me and every time I get kicked off there is a new wireless network that I don't usual see. </s>
<s> Is it possible that this person and my network our on the same channel and when they get on I get kicked off? </s>
<s> I have tried going into the router settings and change the channel but that didn't seem to do the trick. </s>
<s> Anyone else have any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Is SSID broadcasting? </s>
<s> WPA? </s>
<s> How about a make and model? </s>
<s> And are you using a P2P application? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> SSID and WPA r broadcasting...I do have a P2P client but I hardly ever use it and this happens while the app is closed </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> SMC barricade and yes firmware is updated </s>
<s> Also any setting OTHER than SSID broadcast enabled and WPA? </s>
<s> Some routers seem to have problems when I turn on NAT filtering or &quot;other.&quot; Please start telling all. </s>
<s> It is too much work for me to ask every detail. </s>
<s> This is not tech support but you and I discussing it. </s>
<s> Just like non-paid support, you have to get out and push. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> nothing else is turned on I have left everything the default except for SSID WPA and 802.1X which have to have on for WPA... </s>
<s> I haven't tried another router </s>
<s> Not that it's too far from the clients (how far?) </s>
<s> but I found a router buried under books and it was simply overheating. </s>
<s> Try moving it so that all the bigger sides are exposed to air so it's a little cooler. </s>
<s> I take it that you power cycled the router... -&gt; Sadly it looks like the router needs to be swapped out at this point. </s>
<s> Sometimes the firmware version matters. </s>
<s> Since you are not sharing details I can't look into that issue. </s>
