1.2.1	It likely died in some way.	St
1.2.2	Are you sure you need to know what happened or do you need to know these last only a few years and we replace them?	St

1.4.1	yeah!I really need to know, what happened?	St
1.4.2	and how to fix it?	St
1.5.1	Remember that repairing these drives costs far more than putting in a new one.	St
1.5.2	You need some electronic gear like an oscilloscope, a laser power meter to read the output of the laser and spare parts.	St

1.5.4	Now do you understand why you replace the drive?	St

1.7.3	At our shop we have a few hundred arranged by make that are donors for parts like trays, bezels but we know better than to never try to fix one.	St
