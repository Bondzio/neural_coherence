hey all, i've purchased an atlon 1.6 ghz 256mb ram, everything was running smoothly on it however each time i installed a game, when i played it i sometimes receiced some reboots, this was starting to become a concern and a bother cause 20 min on your game the computer reboot at random times, i though maybe it was because i overclocked my cpu so i went in the bios and reset everything in default, now when my pc boots up again, it will allways reboot before hitting to windowsxp and on occasions when i hit delete to go back to bios it reboots, if i leave the computer on it will keep on doing a cycle reboot and ask me to run on safe more or normal mode.
i even tried to re - image my pc, as soon as it goes to boot to the cd-rom it reboots.
could it be the hard drive corrupt ( i don't know) could it be the ram stick ( i don't know) could it be my system board ( i don't know) i am clueless on what to do, like i said it was rebooting on games before and now it freaks out and reboots until i turn it off.
i have no clue why its doing this however i got a blue screen last time, i will post the update tomorrow about it.
