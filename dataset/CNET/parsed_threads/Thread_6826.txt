<s> I have an Epson CX3200 and I use compatable cartiridges the colour reproduction is darker and has a blue hue. </s>
<s> This also applied to using Epson full price cartridges. </s>
<s> I have looked at the printer advance settings but am a bit scared to fiddle. </s>
<s> Can anyone help at all I would be most grateful for any advice. </s>
<s> Thansk a million in anticiaption Eddie </s>
<s> it could be the problem of blocked nozzle - do a nozzle check pattern, it should look something like this: http://support2.epson.net/manuals/english/ij/styluscolor680/REF_G/IMAGES/621TPGOO.GIF If not, try this first: http://www.inkrepublic.com/members/nozzle/index.asp hope this helps. </s>
<s> Sorry to say I have the same problem with an Epson stylus color 880 ever since it sucked in two sheets of heavy glossy photo paper at one time. </s>
<s> Had a tough time removing them. </s>
<s> I suspect that damaged the nozzles. </s>
<s> Changing cartridges did not help. </s>
<s> Unlike some other mfg printers, the Epson nozzles are not part of the cartridge. </s>
<s> I tried everything you did & everything the Epson Help desk suggested except taking it to one of their repair stations. </s>
