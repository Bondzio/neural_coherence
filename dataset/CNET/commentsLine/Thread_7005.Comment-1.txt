i have a rosewill smartone case, i have 7x120mm fans, one in the front, one in the back, one on top, two on the left side, and two on the right side i cut and installed myself to pull heat off of the back of my motherboard.
the one in the front is going in, the one on top is out, the one on back is out, the one on the left side is blowing air down on to the cpu, the second one on the left side is a highflow fan and its pulling air out away from my crossfired cards, i was wondering if there was a better way to arange them to get lower temps,the cpu is idleing around 30c, load at 60c, the cards idle at 32c and top out around 65c on crysis maxed.
