if you are concerned that malware could be on the drives, boot from a copywipe cd and wipe the drive:  i recommend unplugging your main drive and only connecting the drive you want to wipe.
using this method your operating system will not be active, so there should be no way to infect the boot drive.
copywipe will wipe every sector on the disk.
if you have old drives, it is probably better to wipe and recycle them than use them.
old drives are slower and may not be reliable.
copywipe can do multiple writes with random data so that your data cannot be retrieved.
