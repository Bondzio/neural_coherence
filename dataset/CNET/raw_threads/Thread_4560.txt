I am leaving my current job in which I was supplied a Dell notebook that I used for personal use at home as well. I have gone back to school as well so I will will need a new laptop. I will need it for internet, email, word processing, spreadsheets, & itunes(3 ipod nanos and roughly 1000 songs). Will a netbook satisfy those needs? Also, what sort of memory and battery life should I be looking for? I appreciate all the help.

So for now, life of the usual batteries do not vary among the names. Why a netbook? At the usual 350 to 399 bucks you can have a regular size notebook. Bob
