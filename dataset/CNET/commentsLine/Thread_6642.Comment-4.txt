windows (most versions) does not know a cdrw drive from a cd drive.
many are unaware of this and fall into a trap of &quot;it shouldn't be this way&quot; for some period of time.
i'll wait for you to figure that out.
in the meantime, if you want to create a cdr or cdrw disk, the software i noted is free to try out.
