<s> I intend on purchasing a HP desktop system running a AMD Athlon 64...3700 processor. </s>
<s> My previous system used Intel processor. </s>
<s> Is this AMD processor as reliable as the Intel Processor? </s>
<s> I understand that the one major difference between the AMD and Intel is price. </s>
<s> There is also some chatter alluding to the fact that the AMD 64 is prone to hardlocks. </s>
<s> Does anyone have the facts on these issues? </s>
<s> The office has more than a handful Athlon 64s and no more lockups than any other (Intel) desktops. </s>
<s> Can you craft a test that I could run to measure this one? </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Writing from my Athlon 64 machine. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> you might be thinking of the OC'ing community frustration with the AthlonXP's produced post week 39 of 2003 (!!!) </s>
<s> that are super-locked from the factory, but that means the multipliers cannot be adjusted, but as a note Intel has been doing this since Pentium II on ALL PROCESSORS that they make, with the exception of the ES and I think the EE might feature a somewhat adjustable multi AMD leaves the A64 FX unlocked oh and bob, maybe running 20-30 copies of FarCry while compiling LOTR 3 Director's Cut into DivX 10 times over from 10 seperate DVD drives, that might test which one is more reliable to crash... </s>
<s> Fear, Uncerenty, Doubt. </s>
<s> Are tactics used to disparage a competor,AKA AMD. </s>
<s> All of my AMDs are working great running 24/7 no lockups. </s>
<s> I have had an A64 3200 (self build) for over a year now. </s>
<s> It's probably the most stable system I've ever owned. </s>
<s> (previous 11 PC's were all Intels except for 1 Cyrix) I know 2 other peolple with A64's and 2 with Athlon XP's, all without issue. </s>
<s> I've had several AMD chips. </s>
<s> I bought an Athlon 800Mhz chip in 2000 when I upgraded from my Intel Pentium II. </s>
<s> In 2002, I bought the Athlon 1.7Ghz chip that my desktop currently runs. </s>
<s> I was experiencing a lot of lockups on both chips for a while there, but those turned out to be Windows ME related as the problems went away when I upgraded to Windows XP. </s>
<s> My wife's laptop runs an AMD Sempron 2.8 or 3.0 Ghz processor. </s>
<s> One of the reasons that I switched to AMD, besides price, is that AMD had hired an engineer from Digital Equipment Corp. (bought by Compaq which was bought by HP). </s>
<s> DEC was known for their 200Mhz bus and 64 bit processors while Intel was getting to 32 bit. </s>
<s> I figured with a DEC engineer running the show, the Athlon chip might have some of their fine engineering behind it. </s>
<s> I have never been disappointed. </s>
<s> Except for my first computer...486DX2, all my computers have been powered by AMD. </s>
<s> Any lockups you may experience will be due to your OS install and any programs that have been installed. </s>
<s> I've built many AMD powered systems for family and friends and relucktantly built two Intel systems and those systems cost way more than any AMD system. </s>
<s> Do yourself a favor and build your own system. </s>
<s> There are many resources on the web (anandtech.com) and many reputable vendors (NewEgg.com) Its quite rewarding. </s>
<s> Many store systems try to wow you with lots of additional software you'll never use. </s>
<s> I purchased a desktop system assembled locally in early 1999 that had an AMD K6-2 running at 300 MHz. </s>
<s> The system was used heavily by two high school students, by my wife (a teacher), and by me (an engineer). </s>
<s> It was also used to run various Linux distributions (Red Hat, Suse, Caldera) in dual-boot (LILO) configurations with Windows. </s>
<s> Today it is running Windows XP Home Edition SP2 that was an upgrade from the original Windows 98 (not SE). </s>
<s> It is used almost entirely for word processing with Microsoft Works 4.5 by my wife. </s>
<s> It is left on all the time to save startup time and because it has an attached laser printer that can be accessed over our home network from other systems. </s>
<s> Around August 1999 my college-bound daughter purchased a Compaq Presario 1237 laptop (from Radio Shack) that had an AMD K6 266 MHz MMX(tm) enhanced processor. </s>
<s> This was more than adequate for her purposes at college. </s>
<s> The lower CPU cost offset the higher cost of the far superior (to HPA) active-matrix TFT display and three-spindle (hard drive, CD-ROM drive, and floppy drive) configuration. </s>
<s> The system came with Windows 98. </s>
<s> It was connected to the college's network using Novell drivers and a 3COM PCMCIA NIC. </s>
<s> She still has it and it still works. </s>
<s> In October 2001 I took the plunge and bought myself an HP Pavilion N5425 notebook computer. </s>
<s> It has a 900-MHz AMD Athlon. </s>
<s> This has been my main computer for the past four years. </s>
<s> It came with Windows XP Home Edition and has been upgraded to SP2. </s>
<s> I run all sorts of applications on it: Microsoft Office XP (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook), Visio, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Borland C++ Builder 5 (C/C++ software development), Scilab, Winamp, iTunes, Musicmatch Jukebox, Windows Media Player 10, RealPlayer, DivX Player, TextPad, Source Edit, Snag-It, TurboTax, Norton Ghost 9.0, Norton Internet Security (AntiVirus, Personal Firewall), Norton AntiSpam, Webroot Spy Sweeper, Java VM, STEEM (Atari ST Emulator), Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.0.5, N4PY control software for my Ten-Tec Argonaut V amateur radio transceiver, DigiPan PSK31 software, and all manner of tools and utilities (some written by me). </s>
<s> It all works. </s>
<s> The only problems I have had with this HP notebook PC are related to progressive failure of the cable between the display and the rest of the system, which leads me to the next AMD-based computer. </s>
<s> I recently ordered an HP Pavilion zv6000 series notebook with AMD Athlon 64 3200+ (2.0 GHz) CPU. </s>
<s> When this arrives, it will become my main computer. </s>
<s> My old HP notebook will then go in for surgery (under my soldering iron) to see if I can get the diplay running again. </s>
<s> However, even if I can't, I can still use it with an external monitor, as I am doing right now! </s>
<s> (Prior to this bump in the road, I was using the internal display as &quot;1&quot; and the external display as &quot;2&quot; in a dual-monitor extended desktop arrangement.) </s>
<s> Based upon my experience (both past and anticipated future), you should be OK with AMD CPUs, at least in terms of system availability. </s>
<s> And remember, reliability (MTBF) is only one component of availability, which is what we users really care about. </s>
<s> The other major component is repair time (MTTR), which is probably the more significant of the two. </s>
<s> Overall, I have had good experiences with HP products over the years. </s>
<s> Also, when HP uses AMD processors they know that they are staking THEIR reputation on that decision. </s>
<s> I use AMD from years! </s>
<s> and is as fast and as stable compared with any Intel CPU. </s>
<s> Most of my friends have systems with AMD procesors and everybody is happy! </s>
<s> I have an old Compaq laptop, with AMD K6-2 still running fine for 7 years, a selfbuilt desktop with AMD Athlon XP 2500+ for 3 years, working almost nonstop without any crash at all, and a new selfbuilt desktop with AMD64 3000+ which is working superbly for a year. </s>
<s> Will this help? </s>
<s> I have had several AMD processors over the years. </s>
<s> This is being done on an eMachine with an AMD 64. </s>
<s> I have never had any problems with them. </s>
<s> I think other factors are more important than who made the processor. </s>
<s> I had a compaq Pressario(leas than 2 years old with an AMD processor that used too lock up specially while playing games. </s>
<s> I repalced the motherboard for an Intel processor and I haven't had any lock up since. </s>
<s> Although you're right, AMD processors cost less than comparable intel chips, that's not the biggest reason to switch. </s>
<s> Find a tech savvy friend to explain the numbers to you. </s>
<s> An intel chip at 3 ghz is running at 3 ghz to get that performance. </s>
<s> An AMD chip rated at 3 ghz performance is actually running around 2.4 ghz. </s>
<s> This means it is not working as hard to do the same work as an intel chip. </s>
<s> It also means it lasts longer due to less heat being made. </s>
<s> If you check over some of the old articles you can find on the net comparing intel chips and AMD chips, you'll find that in almost every case the intel lags the AMD in the tests made for performance. </s>
<s> I've been working on systems for friends and family for about 15 years now....I'll not buy or recommend intel ever. </s>
<s> ...just like any other over-hyped name brand- that may, or may not, be anything more than it's advertising. </s>
<s> I've built numerous systems & only use AMD. </s>
<s> The performance per dollar value is incredible. </s>
<s> I've not had one bad CPU yet. </s>
<s> I even had a friend have a lightening storm take out his wall socket & motherboard with it. </s>
<s> Guess what? </s>
<s> CPU was put into another board & off he went! </s>
<s> True story...(& this time he listened to me & went to get a UPS for his system- lol), Tracy </s>
<s> I have had a AMD Processor on my computer and love it. </s>
<s> When I found the computer I liked back in &quot;98&quot; I almost didn't buy it because it had a AMD Processor now I am glad I did. </s>
<s> I have never had any problems with it and now that it is time to buy a new computer I will not hesitate to buy one with a AMD Processor actually I prefer it. </s>
<s> Just do research on the web. </s>
<s> Gamers all user Athlon64's. </s>
<s> My reccomendation would be a San Diego/Venice core (newest Socket 939 core). </s>
<s> Unless your a hardcore gamer, then get an Athlon64 X2 When building gamer machines, AMD's SPANK Intel. </s>
<s> You have a bigger selection of chipsets, until recently the nVidia nForce chipsets were only available for AMD. </s>
<s> Now nVidia makes an nForce4 chipset for Intel but it is alot slower than the AMD counterpart. </s>
<s> I have been using AMD for a long time. </s>
<s> Ever since they bought NexGen. </s>
<s> Best chips on the market. </s>
<s> Intel is hyped, slower, and more expensive. </s>
<s> I don't know about you, but faster and cheaper (with the same amount of stability) sounds better to me. </s>
<s> My computers have had AMD processors since 1998, and the only problem I had was with the first one, where the chip was running at 475 mgh and the everything else at 500. </s>
<s> I put in a new chip and all was fine. </s>
<s> The HP I have now runs a 2-gig chip and I have had no problems. </s>
<s> not the processor. </s>
<s> You need to learn to separate the quality of the machine built from the specific components inside the machine. </s>
<s> I've built a multitude of machines. </s>
<s> The last 3 AMD. </s>
<s> I will never pay Intel's premium again. </s>
<s> The AMD 64 3700 processor that you looked at is much faster than a pentium 3.6...so in terms of speed AMD is faster. </s>
<s> Also the 64 bit processors are more futuristic than the 32 bit processors, therefore you want to have the AMD 64 processors because it is the new wave of technology. </s>
<s> And finally the HP computers offer you the best in after sales support as well as extra software such as imagezone and hardware such as lightscribe, that other brands do not offer, for free. </s>
<s> Thus the HP AMD athlon 64 is a wise choice. </s>
<s> Hey BOB, Your company might be using processors that are not designed to do the multitasking that most offices require. </s>
<s> You should try upgrading to a processor with HT or the more recent Dual Core technology. </s>
<s> Or you could simply instruct your staff not to run more than a few applications at a time. </s>
<s> i have not yet upgraded or built with amd's latest and greatest, but i have been upgrading or building with amd chips since win95. </s>
<s> i have never had any trouble with them and would not consider using any other. </s>
<s> i usually let the newest, latest and greatest sit on the shelf for the first year or so. </s>
<s> that way if there are any bugs or draw backs you'll know and the co. has time to work on the problem, not to mention saving a bundle when i do upgrade or build. </s>
<s> The last time I bought an Intel chip it was a 486DX2 66 - some time ago, and even though I bought it on a market stall, it still cost over 200! </s>
<s> Ever since then I've stuck with AMD, so mych so that I even managed to get the operating characteristics of different typses of chips, so at least I can look them over BEFORE I buy them. </s>
<s> I have already had a look at the operating specs of Intel and others vs AMD, and have decided that on the present specs, the next chip will definitely be AMD 64bit, probably the AMD64 X2 dual core model. </s>
<s> AMD forget it. </s>
<s> An Intel chip will always give the same designated CPU power output. </s>
<s> IE A 286 chip will always give 286 even today yonks after it first came out. </s>
<s> But an AMD will over time give less and less of it's original powere output. </s>
<s> And an AMD chip gives out twice as much heat as an Intel chip. </s>
<s> So that means exta fans, and heatsink. </s>
<s> Meaning more power consumtion for your already power hungry PC! </s>
<s> I have built 3 computers - all with AMD. </s>
<s> Other components have needed replacement. </s>
<s> AMD - never. </s>
<s> Buy from good dealer and get a good heatsink fan. </s>
<s> You won't regret it. </s>
<s> Although some cases say they only work with pentium (Lian Li). </s>
<s> So, check out your case, too. </s>
<s> This post is a joke and doesn't make sense. </s>
<s> Some novices may not understand this so I'm letting everyone know. </s>
<s> For the past six years, I have built all of my machines using AMD processors. </s>
<s> Stability has never been a problem, especially once I upgraded to Windows XP. </s>
<s> I have been running an AMD Athlon 64 3200 with a Gig of memory, and I have yet to encounter any problems. </s>
<s> It runs quietly, and can perform several tasks without much effort. </s>
<s> I have used AMD processors in my last two computers and have had no trouble with them. </s>
<s> Very good reliability! </s>
<s> My present notebook computer, an Averatec 3200 uses the AMD Athlon XP-M. </s>
<s> Excellent reliability! </s>
<s> Bruce </s>
<s> marketwatcher, As a computer technician, I've worked with Intel and AMD both. </s>
<s> I've seen ups, and downs to both sides. </s>
<s> I've also seen people buy the wrong type of processor for them. </s>
<s> As far as reliability, AMD and Intel are for the most part, the same. </s>
<s> Expect years of service from both. </s>
<s> However, DON'T run out buying a 64-bit Athlon because somebody told you to. </s>
<s> First off, AMD's seem to fit better into the gaming slot. </s>
<s> Most geeks delight in a faster processor, cheaper. </s>
<s> Intel seems to lag in the gaming market. </s>
<s> Now, that doesn't mean that you should ONLY consider an AMD. </s>
<s> If you want to run buisness apps, I suggest getting an Intel. </s>
<s> My personal experiance is that Intel is better suited towards the high end buisness apps. </s>
<s> If you just want the basics (like Microsoft Word, internet, printing information for personal or professional use) I suggest going with the AMD Duron or Intel Celeron, simply because, in general, they have lower price tags. </s>
<s> Though keep in mind.. if speed is important... an AMD Duron was SUPPOSED to be an AMD Athlon... but it failed its testing. </s>
<s> By the same token... an Intel Celeron was SUPPOSED to be an Intel Pentium... but it too failed its tests. </s>
<s> (Thats a nasty little secret, isn't it?) </s>
<s> Personally, I prefer the Intel Celeron in this case. </s>
<s> Not quite as peppy as the Duron, but it seems to do a little bit better on the basics like Microsoft Word (from what I have seen). </s>
<s> Ok, now that you've made your decision between a gaming rig, or a buisness machine.... and if you want just the basics, or something with a little more 'umph', you now need to know WHICH of AMD or Intel is right for you (the hardest part is now over). </s>
<s> Your selection will be limited, as it seems the Duron is no longer listed by AMD as a current processor (expect a Duron machine to be next to nothing... if you can still find one). </s>
<s> If you have decided that you can take a slight hit in speed, and you would like to keep that wallet at fat as possible, you don't need this next part, as a Celeron or Duron (if you can still find one...) would be just fine for you. </s>
<s> Now... we hit what type. </s>
<s> Right now, the 64-bit series isn't too useful, since most apps don't take advantage of the 64-bit structure. </s>
<s> Expect that to change within a year or so, Especially with the release of the next version of Windows, Windows Vista. </s>
<s> If you want a long term, higher performance AMD, go with the 64-bit AMD that you are looking at. </s>
<s> If this is just a short fix (less than 16 months), stick with and AMD Athlon. </s>
<s> If the Intel series fits you best (as mentioned earlier...), and you need a long term machine, go for a Dual-Core system. </s>
<s> That is, if you can find it, and more important, afford it. </s>
<s> If you can't find it, or afford it, stick with an Intel Pentium 4. </s>
<s> Though the Pentium 4 was knocked out of Intel's line-up just a couple of months ago, you might be able to have the last laugh by getting a left over Pentium 4 system. </s>
<s> Don't fret. </s>
<s> The Pentium 4 still packs quite a punch, in the buisness apps section. </s>
<s> Well, I hope that this helps. </s>
<s> More important, I hope that I havn't given you mental indigestion. </s>
<s> If you still need more help, just let us know! </s>
<s> I have been using AMD processors for years, and have had no problems whatever! </s>
<s> I have built around 20 computers for myself, my family and many friends. </s>
<s> I have never built an Intel box simply because of the added cost for comparable performance. </s>
<s> Around 2 1/2 years ago my brother (who works for Intel) gave me a new Intel processor... </s>
<s> They get them free every year or so, and he had no need to upgrade his computer at the time. </s>
<s> It was a 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 533. </s>
<s> I bought an Asus P4B533 motherboard for the thing, along with a good heatsink/fan and 2 gigs of DDR memory for it, since my current machine was using slower DDR... </s>
<s> I chose Asus because I have had the best luck with them... Flawless performance from every motherboard made by them... </s>
<s> Since the processor was free, I spared no expense on any of the other components... To make a long story short, that computer was the biggest piece of crap I have ever built! </s>
<s> I have never had so many problems, even using ECS (EliteGroup Computer Systems) motherboards that I got on sale with processors at Fry's for dirt cheap... </s>
<s> Problem after problem... Blue Screen of Death, lockups, the system hanging for periods of several minutes... My favorite was the fact that about evry tenth boot up the motherboard would announce &quot;System Failed due to CPU Overclocking&quot; and go into the bios setup, which my wife and kids had no clue how to deal with... </s>
<s> If I needed to restart the computer, the only way it would do it was to shut down and wait for several minutes before restarting, otherwise it would ALWAYS fail to boot due to the CPU overclocking error... </s>
<s> I had a high dollar solid copper heatsink, and used the best Arctic Silver heatsink compound... Asus had a utility to monitor temperature, and the CPU was not running hot according to the AsusProbe... </s>
<s> I have never overclocked a computer, since I always have reliability and stability as my highest priorities... </s>
<s> If I need more performance, I tend to buy a higher performance processor rather than tweak a processor to run faster than it is designed to... </s>
<s> I dealt with this for more than a year, and finally got pissed off... </s>
<s> Nothing would make this computer run reliably... </s>
<s> I was constantly trying to get it set up so that it would be reliable; absolutely nothing worked... </s>
<s> I finally decided to trash it and go back to AMD... </s>
<s> I bought an Athlon 64 3500+ fairly soon after they first came out, and an Asus A8V Deluxe motherboard... </s>
<s> It was more than I usually spend on an upgrade, but I was tired of messing with my computer... That computer has been completely bullet proof... Not one problem, ever. </s>
<s> It has been running flawlessly, day in and day out... Hardlock? </s>
<s> What's that? </s>
<s> At work I have a P4 3.2 GHz Dell Optiplex GX-280 system, and the AMD is significantly faster... </s>
<s> I use SDRC I-Deas, Solidworks, Pro Engineer and Ansys on both machines, and the AMD is very noticeably faster... (I am using 73GB 10,000 RPM Ultra-160 Fujitsu SCSI drives and Adaptec 29160 controllers in both machines... </s>
<s> I have my own personal hard drives in my machine at work, so they are exactly the same as far as storage performance) They are both very reliable, but the AMD is better... </s>
<s> The Dell has locked up running really large simulations a couple of times... </s>
<s> I have taken my work home several times to finish there, and I have never had a problem. </s>
<s> It's tough to beat absolutely flawless reliability! </s>
<s> Buy the AMD with total confidence! </s>
<s> I have used AMD for years. </s>
<s> No failures. </s>
<s> I have built three computers, over the last four years, and they are still in use and working well. </s>
<s> I am like you and believe that the brands or similar unless you are a gamer and then the AMD FX processor is a better chip. </s>
<s> I cannot think of any other difference except for gaming. </s>
<s> I use my AMD for gaming and I have two other computers with an Intel and an AMD respectively. </s>
<s> The 64 bit is over rated right now since there are not any programs built to take advantage of the processor. </s>
<s> I've been using PCs since 1981 and have built about 60 of them in the past few years. </s>
<s> I've stuck exclusively to AMD processors and have been thrilled with them. </s>
<s> Not one has ever been defective. </s>
<s> You probably don't remember the several &quot;scandals&quot; with defectively-designed Intel processors -- but essentially AMD processors have a clean slate when it comes to reliability and no defects while Intel has been problematic for years. </s>
<s> AMD has also taken the technology lead. </s>
<s> The real disaster you are courting is getting a computer made by HP (and that includes Compaq). </s>
<s> HP has a nasty tendency to cut corners and remove features from the motherboards it uses in its computers. </s>
<s> And it's tech support is the bottom of the barrel. </s>
<s> For example, when a friend had me help him update the BIOS on his HP computer, we followed the somewhat strange instructions on HP's website for installing the BIOS update. </s>
<s> Following their instructions corrupted the CMOS. </s>
<s> Normally this is easily solved by resetting a jumper on the motherboard. </s>
<s> But to save a few cents in manufacturing, HP did not include the pins and jumper for clearing the CMOS. </s>
<s> After an hour of talking to a very nasty person at HP tech support, she finally admitted that the instructions on HP's website had been wrong for at least 3 months, but it wasn't tech support's responsibility to get it corrected. </s>
<s> They had to send my friend a new computer. </s>
<s> And just this month it was revealed that HP's notebooks that use the AMD64 processor were being built with the Dual Channel RAM disabled. </s>
<s> HP spokesmen said that they did this because they couldn't trust consumers who wished to add more RAM to get the right RAM modules. </s>
<s> Now many folks know that AMD64 processors and their motherboards all support Dual Channel RAM (which runs much faster than single channel). </s>
<s> But nowhere does HP tell perspective customers that Dual Channel RAM is disabled on these notebooks. </s>
<s> The only HP products I've even owned that worked well and lasted have been their overpriced laser printers. </s>
<s> My 8-year old LaserJet 4000 is, unfortunately, on its last legs, and I know darned well that it will not be replaced with an HP printer. </s>
<s> Bottom line: Friends don't let friends buy HP. </s>

<s> The only thing I've heard on the &quot;grapevine&quot; is that AMD's tend to heat up (an issue that by now may have been fixed; but I'm not sure). </s>
<s> To counter that, I just removed my side panel all together to allow air in and out more freely (not recommended if your PC is within reach or kids, coffee or pets) and I make sure to dust it out every 2 months or so. </s>
<s> All in all, you will not be disappointed going with AMD. </s>

<s> ...but in my past experience, chip sets, and operating systems may be more of a concern for stability. </s>
<s> I used processors from Intels 8086 to their 80486 without problems. </s>
<s> I switched to AMD back in the K5 days due to better pricing. </s>
<s> I currently use an Athlon XP which has served its purpose well. </s>
<s> Today's Nforce and Via chipsets have eliminated stability issues and offer great performance when compaired to Intel systems. </s>
<s> I will be looking at an Athlon 64 when it is time to upgrade because of past reliability. </s>
<s> I to have owned my AMD for quit some time & have only had to replace a hard drive w/a new one, because I filled the old one up! </s>
<s> That is the only thing I've had to do to mine! </s>
<s> A very reliably machine it has been! </s>
<s> In fact, all I used to hear about the AMD, besides being a much more inexpensive way to go, is that compared to intel, both being equal, the AMD being much more faster than the intel.Also reliable. </s>
<s> So going w/AMD, as far as I'm concerned, is the best way to go! </s>
<s> You shouldn't be disappointed at all! </s>
<s> Though that is true that the OS and programs really do not take full advantage of the 64 bit architecture, it still is faster than the 32 bit chips. </s>
<s> I have a HP desktop with a 2.8Ghz P5-HT and a HP notebook with a 3200(2Ghz) Athlon 64. </s>
<s> For crunching video stuff, it is faster on the Athlon than my P5. </s>
<s> I haven't had any problems with locks on the Athlon. </s>
<s> It actually runs cooler and faster than my other Dell notebook with an Intel Centrino chip. </s>
<s> THe amd is fine but get the Turion if u can (note: I own an Acer Travelmet 4400 turion ml-37) its built as a laptop chip while the AMD 64 has a 62watt output and is a lap burner, the turion is either ml=35 watt (lap warmer) and mt=25 watt(nice lap cool) But if ur looking for a multi-media AMD look at Acer 5020, and Ferreri 4000 (nice but darn exspensive) Amd is great for people wanting to play games and do cpu intensive things, Intel is good for people wanting realy long batt life, but if ur watching moves and such and other things vid card and soundcard any cpu over 1.5 ghz should do u fine. </s>
<s> It all matters on what u want. </s>
<s> Don't know where you get your facts from tchai61! </s>
<s> I thought everyone knew that one of the selling points of AMD was their lower heat dissipation requirements. </s>
<s> BTW less heat because less power. </s>
<s> I ve got two computers that run AMD stabily. </s>
<s> The cooler the cpu is the more stable it gets. </s>
<s> The 754 sempron series is cheap, fast and cool making it a great overclocker. </s>
<s> The Athlon 64 is a great processor especially for gamers as it beats intel p4 all around and runs a couple of degrees cooler. </s>
<s> The turion is again faster that the intel centrino. </s>
<s> The athlon x2 in which i'm planning to get in the future beats intels 840 hands down, cooler faster and cheaper. </s>
<s> The athlon 64 has enhanced virus protection with windows xp sp2 installed. </s>
<s> 11 months ago I bought one and I have absolutely no complaints! </s>
<s> !never had to format (with the old one that was a regular event) never had any problems at all. </s>
<s> Both Intel and AMD processor are very good that you can't really tell which processor is better than the other. </s>
<s> Seems you never have a machine with AMD processor before, why not give it a try with AMD? </s>
<s> Then, you will be able to have the experience and better understanding with AMD processor. </s>
<s> If you want to get a very good performance system with low price, then I'll suggest you to get a AMD Athlon X2 3800+ or AMD Athlon 64 3200+ if you just want to use it to do office document and online. </s>
<s> I have owned PCs that have had cyrix, intel celeron & pentium 4 cpus that have all locked up but my amd athlon64 has yet to crash although I admit I've only been using it since tuesday. </s>
<s> I've bought 4 intel PC's before and decided its time for an amd one having heard that amds are supposed to be more stable. </s>
<s> Last year I was desparate for a pc so I got a pentium 4 3gz before intel made them with the 3 number designation and not only have I had numerous lock-ups/crashes but the very first time I switched it on I couldnt believe how noisey the cooling fan was and I nearly took it back then and I wish I had now. </s>
<s> It was so loud that even my flatmate could hear it down the hall with his door closed and I always thought it sounded like a loud dying chicken! </s>
<s> Then shortly after I got a HP with amd athlon 64 3400 hoping to return my pentium 4 pc but I left it too late so I've only just started using my amd HP but the very first thing I noticed is how virtually silent it really is and its cooler too so that for me is another major bonus in addition to the lower cost, equal if not better performance and running at lower clock speed means less heat, noise and power consumption so amd really deserves to overtake intel in the processor war which I'm not sure if they're winning right now. </s>
<s> I dont think I will ever go back to WINTEL processors ever again so take the plunge like me and be delighted! </s>
<s> I have built a number of computers and I have always used AMD processors. </s>
<s> They were less expensive and all have provided the power I needed. </s>
<s> Hope this helps </s>
<s> I have AMD also and it has ran perfectly for 7 years now, but niether my or your statement matters really since that was 32 bit not 64 like the person is asking. </s>
<s> The 64 did have lock up issues or something along that line but was supposed to have a fix for it. </s>
<s> I think it had something to do with 32 bit apps not running properly more than a lockup of the cpu. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> In my own computers, I have used exclusively AMD CPU's since my first home computer I bought in 1992. </s>

<s> Since then, I have run a half-dozen AMD processors in various motherboards, including my present Athlon 2400+ with NO problems related to the CPU. </s>
<s> Various PC's from my employers have run Intel CPU's, and I see no advantage to using the more expensive Intel chips. </s>
<s> marketwatcher, I use a self-built AMD XP 1.33Ghz Thunderbird box. </s>
<s> The only problem I have had in 3 1/2 years of operation was a fried mobo due to a severe thunderstorm. </s>
<s> As an aside, my system uses the afore-mentioned T-bird, an ASUS board, 1 Ghz of Corsair RAM, and a Western Digital 30GB HD. </s>
<s> Like you, I prefer to not use Intel products. </s>
<s> My next box will use an AMD FX-64 on an Abit board. </s>

<s> Dual Channel Memory is a prime example of this. </s>
<s> I am using an AMD now. </s>
<s> Generic maker, but a reliable machine. </s>
<s> The PROCESSOR has never caused problems, but the operating system has (in all three AMDs I have). </s>

<s> Hi Marketwatcher, Only a quick one, the amd 64's are very good chips and will be suited to the microsoft 64 bit software that is to be released soon. </s>
<s> Did you know that advance micro devices(AMD) used to actually make the the processors for intel before they branched out on there own. </s>
<s> Garrie. </s>
<s> In April 2005 I bought the AMD 64 Athlon 3200+ S939 in their retail box with heatsink & fan. </s>
<s> Comes with a 3-year AMD warranty. </s>
<s> Absolutely no problems and no worry about whether I have picked the right cooling combination. </s>
<s> But I don't go for overclocking. </s>
<s> untrue, AMD made flash memory devices. </s>
<s> When I got my degree one of my research papers was on the history of AMD. </s>
<s> I've built several computers because I own a computer store since 1993, and i have personally used AMD based computers since AMD K-6, AMD proccessors are excellent, cheap, reliable, and faster than Intel ones. </s>

<s> As i can see you are just supposing. </s>
<s> When you assure something, first you &quot;MUST&quot; be certain of what you say, you can't just suppose and assure starting from a not proven fact. </s>
<s> Speaking of Dual Core chips, AMD proccesors are technologically more advanced than intel's , do you know that AMD proccesors do much more operations for each clock cycle?, do you know that a 64 bit proccesor (AMD 64's) proccess double quantity of information than 32 bit proccesors (Pentium IV)? </s>
<s> Don't make laugh.... </s>
<s> There is no 64 bit software?, wrong..... </s>
<s> I know there is not too much 64 bit software, but you said &quot;there is no 64 bit software&quot;... </s>
<s> There is 64 bit WIndows XP, several Linux Versions are 64 bits too, and there are several 64 bit applications. </s>
<s> I can't speak about the 64 bit amd's but the few 32 bit amd's that I've used have been reliable. </s>
<s> and they process colors better then intel. </s>
<s> at least better than my dells that I have had. </s>
<s> and still have a 4700 with ati 128mb pci express card and pent.4 processor. </s>
<s> Why are going on about the very ancient amd 286 chip? </s>
<s> An thlon 64 and X2 run onne hell of alot cooler allowing it to overclock more, hence being more stable(before overclock). </s>
<s> They normally run a couple of degrees cooler. </s>
<s> This is because the intel's cpu are clocked much higher. </s>
<s> Plus AMd doesn't have a stupid cpu slot compared to intel's lga 775, in which you need a screwdriver and push with all your might, therefore you will be worrying about damaging your motherboard rather than fitting the cpu in. </s>
<s> When installing an athlon 64, you just slot the cpu in and push down on th mechanism. </s>
<s> The best thing about it is that that Athlon 64's have the best frame rates when it comes to gaming e.g. </s>
<s> Athlon Fx-57. </s>
<s> And they were first to develop 64 bit processors therefore it s future proof! </s>

<s> I have 12 machines in the office, 10 of them AMD. </s>
<s> Semptrons as well as Athlons. </s>
<s> No problem with any of them. </s>
<s> Intel licensed 286 to amd and intel sued amd over 386 tech, but amd prevailed. </s>
<s> ;) </s>
<s> but the Supreme Court ruled you cannot copyright a number, thats how the Pentium was born, to distinguish Intel from other competiters. </s>
<s> To all the techie wanna be, AMD first came out with their copy of Intel's x86 processor. </s>
<s> AMD kept copying Intel architecture that there was a time that they went to court that ordered Intel to release the 486 microcodes. </s>
<s> After this episode, AMD started developing their own architecture. </s>
<s> AMD's platform architecture is very different from that of Intel's. </s>
<s> AMD connect directly to the memory and its chipsets but the chipset has no direct connection to the memory. </s>
<s> This means that the processor has to work hard passing info from the memory to chipset and vice versa(aka multi i/o task). </s>
<s> But with the processor's direct connection with the memory, it could finish a memory task much faster. </s>
<s> Intel's way is processor to chipset to memory. </s>
<s> There is no direct connection to the memory meaning the chipset has to channel a lot of info between the processor and memory. </s>
<s> Chipsets are designed for that job (aka multi i/o task) therefore if could finish the multi i/o much faster, like memory caching, etc. </s>
<s> From an engineering stand point, both processors are good since they perform as adverstised, both uses nanometer technology meaning an error in the number of molecules per area means the difference between a functioning product and non-functioning one. </s>
<s> For enthusiast who build their own &quot;tower&quot; or desktop, the system that you built might have a problem but you can't blame it on the processor. </s>
<s> Your &quot;tower&quot; consist of many different parts that have been bought from different suppliers. </s>
<s> These parts generally work together but they have different tolerances. </s>
<s> You might have build two towers with identical parts but one would hung-up while the other works just fine. </s>
<s> This is the same with any branded PCs. </s>
<s> One might work fine but another may experience problem. </s>
<s> I've worked for one of the two. </s>
<s> I've even worked for DEC where we have the Alpha, the first true 64 bit proc. </s>
<s> But I woundn't say &quot;Intel sucks&quot; or &quot;AMD sucks&quot;. </s>
<s> One can never generalized. </s>
<s> These are marks of uninformed enthusiast. </s>
<s> I would rather go to their websites www.intel.com or www.amd.com and read up about the processors. </s>
<s> It make for interesting reading. </s>
<s> I've had a HP with AMD 3400+ 64 bit processor since last Xmas (2004) and have NEVER had one second of trouble with ANY software, except after upgrading Windows XP to SP2 the system would not restart when using the restart command. </s>
<s> After installing the last upgrade for XP from Windows this problem went away. </s>
<s> Don't know why since according to the lable on the upgrade it concerned keyboard drivers, but why look a gift horse in the mouth. </s>
<s> This system is considerably faster than all the systems of my friends using Intel Pentiums. </s>
<s> It screams and I'm tickled pink! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Advanced Micro Devices has made some great improvements the recent years. </s>
<s> As a student in Computer Sciences, I built my first computer from scratch using an AMD Athlon 1.2 GHZ Processor, back on 2001. </s>
<s> That was a great experience and as of today, that PC still running smoothly. </s>
<s> I have never experienced any harware failure related or linked to the processor itself. </s>
<s> I have used that machine as a test machine and I tried many crazy things with it. </s>
<s> Currently I am using a Media Center PC from HP with an Athlon 64 3500 in it and believe me, I am very happy. </s>
<s> One more thing is that in the 64 bits race, AMD has some advance against Intel and this is recognized by many analysts. </s>
<s> My advice is do not hezitate. </s>
<s> Go ahead, get your AMD 64 3700 PC and in the meantime you will get yourself ready for the future upgrade to Windows Vista. </s>
<s> Enjoy! </s>
<s> I have NEVER had an AMD fry out. </s>
<s> I did, however, have a Pentium 4 fry. </s>
<s> After THAT experience it is extremely unlikely that I will ever go with anything but AMD for one heck of a long, loooooooong, LOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time!! </s>

<s> AMD generally makes better CPUs tehn Intel. </s>
<s> High-end AMD pcu's defeat Intel. </s>
<s> Plus most of AMDs chips are 64 bit ready, while Intel makes us think that we have to pay more to get more. </s>
<s> They have 64 bit ready chips in I believe 3 of their series. </s>

<s> That's why I have AMDs in all my computers </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Sure you can buy Intel, but expect to have only about half of Vista work for you. </s>
<s> Microsoft designs their software for Intel processors. </s>
<s> AMD is always playing catch-up. </s>
<s> Did you notice that XP Media Center came out on all Intel chips and it took forever for it to finally to be released on a computer with and AMD chip. </s>
<s> Because for most of the computing world, Intel had dominated the processor market(it's like like Windows and the Apple OS), but those days are over. </s>
<s> Ever since AMD came out with the first 64 bit ready chip back in 2003, it has been downhill for Intel. </s>
<s> AMD currently has the fastest dual core CPU (AMD X2 4800+), the fastest single core CPU (AMD Athlon 64 FX-57), and generally have better value and better chips all around. </s>
<s> Think about it, you can get a 64 bit ready processor from AMD in almost every processor AMD sells, but with Intel it is in about I believe 3 of there series, their dual core 800 series, their 600 series, and I believe the dual core D series. </s>
<s> Intel even ditched the BTX form factor design only to go back to ATX. </s>
<s> Face it, the future is AMD. </s>
<s> Because Intel is now in trouble ALL over the WORLD for PRICE fixing and nasty business prictices they used to keep AMD down. </s>
<s> I have used Intel processors and AMD processors. </s>
<s> I have liked my AMD machines the best. </s>
<s> From an old AMD K6 to my current AMD 64 - all have run fine. </s>
<s> The only lockups I have ever had have been due to running Windows software back in the days of Windows 95, 98, ME and 2000. </s>
<s> Since I have moved along to XP I have few problems and no more 'blue screen of death.' </s>
<s> I was tempted to drop them all and move to Apple's Mac machines until XP came out. </s>
<s> I must admit no real problems with my Pentiums, but for the money I seem to get a whole lot more from myu AMD's. </s>
<s> I'd rather see that new 50cent movie a million times than replace my AMD with an Intel. </s>
<s> Intel is pure crap. </s>
