1.1.1	I have 3 computers all with WinXP all hooked to a linksys wireless router.	St
1.1.2	My notebook (HP pavilion n5435) is wireless and the others (emachine and Dell) are wired.	St
1.1.3	My problem is I keep on losing my cable connection (motorola pcx1100u bought from my cable ISP)The connection goes down for no apprent reason.	St
1.1.4	I have had other computers hooked-up (which have now been replaced with the ones I have now so I know it is not the compters)and had the same problem.	St
1.1.5	Therefore the problem must be with the router, the cable modem, or my ISP.	St
1.1.6	When it goes down sometimes all I have to do is reboot the cable modem other times just the router.	St
1.1.7	Sometimes both or even both and the computers.	St
1.1.8	This has been an ongoing aggravating problem.	St
1.1.9	Any help will be greatly apprecitated.	St
1.1.10	Wayne	St
1.2.1	Lost connections through cable can be confounding.	St
1.2.2	I found that the cable itself (RG59 or RG6) can cause an issue when split too many times prior to the modem.	St
1.2.3	I requested that my installer run one line directly off the main to insure a good signal.	St
1.2.4	You can eliminate the router as the problem source by taking it out of the mix and attach the modem directly to one PC.	St
1.2.5	If the problem persists, then the router is ruled out leaving just the cable or the modem or the ISP.	St
1.2.6	In any case I would make it their problem.	St
