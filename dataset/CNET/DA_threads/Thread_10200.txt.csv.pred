1.1.1	Just bought myself a new motherboard & AMD CPU .	St
1.1.2	while building my new system , some of thermapaste got leaked into the CPU socket placement ( i inserted cpu , put the paste on top of cpu and put the heatsink/fank on top.. but i did n't like the placement of my heatsink/cpu so i took it out , and took out the CPU but some of the thermapaste got leaked ) i tried to clean it with a paper towel , it was n't too serious of a leak but now.. nothing will start ( my cpu fan wo n't run ) im trying to start from a barebone ( just RAM , CPU , and Powersupply ) i checked the placement for PW switch and it is in the right placement.. would a little thermapaste leak cause enough trouble to mess up my CPU & motherboard , or do i need a new power supply ?	Ques
1.1.3	( 380 watt power supply.. brand new as well )	St
1.2.1	But the last one I built is a 1ghz athlon , and I never used that thermapaste stuff .	St
1.2.2	Its still running fine .	St
1.2.3	I guess it has to do with the new pc 's .	St
1.3.1	It sounds as if the board is n't powered .	St
1.3.2	Just check all connections , especially power supply to the motherboard .	St
1.3.3	Some motherboards have more than one connector .	St
1.3.4	In addition to the 20/24 pin , typical connector , many boards also have a 4 pin connector .	St
1.4.1	Mobo only , no CPU , no memory nada .	St
1.4.2	Plug the PS 20/24 pin connector into the mobo .	St
1.4.3	Plug the PS into a hot outlet and turn the switch on its rear on .	St
1.4.4	[ at this point most newer mobos will have a light on the mobo that indicates that the five volt standby voltage is present ] .	St
1.4.5	Rather than the front panel switch simply use a small metal slot screwdriver to momentarily short the two power switch pins together .	St
1.4.6	The supply should start as noted by its fan running , [ at this point the 4 pin 12 volt connector need not be present ] .	St
1.4.7	This test can be made with the mobo laying on a table and the power supply also there just out of the box .	St
1.4.8	Always the first step that this writer makes .	St
1.4.9	No use putting defective hardware into the case to find out .	St
1.4.10	Also mounting of the mobo improperly can lead to shoted artwork lands preventing operation .	St
1.4.11	To test an ATX supply by itself , only plugged into a wall outlet , simply [ from the rear of the 20/24 pin connector use something like a paper clip [ small on ] to jumper the green wire to any of the black [ ground/return ] leads in the same cable .	St
1.4.12	As long as that jumper is making contact to both pins the power supply will turn on , again as noted by the fan running .	St
1.4.13	[ from the mobo it only takes a momentary contact , because the mobo makes the connection between the green wire and ground [ logic low ] .	St
1.4.14	If the thermal compound is conductive , [ older arctic silver was , not true any longer ] that could cause problems with the CPU .	St
