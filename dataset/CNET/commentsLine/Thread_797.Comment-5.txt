ok..i see what your saying.
i think i will just at the wireless point.
i know this sounds crazy but the network is already sensitive enough, lol, i would rather add downstream.
i am on my 2nd router in 3 years and about every 3 or 4 days it seems i have to reboot the router for unknow reasons.
i starting to wonder if its my isp doing that somehow.
i know they would rather me pay an extra 10 bucks a month per ip address.. thanks again
