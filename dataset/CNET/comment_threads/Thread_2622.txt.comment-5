I'll put the most important stuff on a disk (my disk burner can be a hit or miss; that's why I thought the HD might be simpler).
But I'm not sure what you mean when you say the drives I talked about are a &quot;commoddity item.&quot; Isn't everything we're talking about, including the Mac itself, a commodity item?
