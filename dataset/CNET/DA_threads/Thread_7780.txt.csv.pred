1.1.1	I have 2 Dell 800 mghz computers with 256 mb of ram running windows XP .	St
1.1.2	When you boot up it will show the Dell logo and the time line for loading the BIOS but it takes a long time and then it will com up in dos with the message & quot ; no hard drive detected press f1 to continue or f2 to enter setup & quot ; If I press f1 it will boot up perfect .	St
1.1.3	If I go into setup it shows the hard drive .	St
1.1.4	I have flashed the BIOS , changed the ram , put in a new hard drive , and reinstalled XP because I thought it might be service pack 2 .	St
1.1.5	Any info would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.6	Thanks Robert Frazier	St
1.2.1	Look around in your bios , perhaps in the boot area .	St
1.2.2	See if you have an option something like 'delay IDE initial ' .	St
1.2.3	If so raise the amount up a little at a time .	St
1.2.4	What do you have the boot order set to ?	Ques
1.3.1	Did it just start doing this one day , or is this a new drive you upgraded to ?	Ques
1.3.2	Is there anyway to retain the drive config in the bios settings or does it have to detect each time you boot ?	Ques
1.3.3	I 'm suspecting a dead battery on the motherboard but more info would help .	St
1.3.4	Scott .	St

1.5.3	http : //support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kb/en/document ? dn=FA1022544 See specifically , Clearing NVRAM , about mid page .	St
1.5.4	Do n't know your specific model so you may want to find out how to set jumpers for maintenance mode before you clear NVRAM .	St

1.6.1	THANKS FOR THE INFO .	St
1.6.2	SORRY I TOOK SO LONG GETTING BACK .	St
1.6.3	I COULD NOT FIND THE FORUM .	St
1.6.4	HOW DUMB IS THAT ?	Ques
1.6.5	DID THE DELL IDEA FIX THE PROBLEM ?	Ques
1.6.6	THANLS ROBERT	St
1.7.1	Unplug the slave drive to see if the problem persists .	St
1.7.2	If not , my guess is an insufficient power .	St
1.7.3	Dell is known for installing minimal power supplies .	St
1.7.4	Extra drives can stress the undersized psu .	St
1.8.1	I fixed two earlier Dells by replacing the PS since it was having trouble recognizing the drives .	St
1.8.2	Be very careful with the new Dell systems as they have a Dell proprietary ( non-standard ) ATX design .	St
1.8.3	This means that pin 1 and 3 have ground on them where the standard ATX has +5 volts and a couple other pin mismatches .	St
1.8.4	see : http : //www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.asp ? p=339053 Warning : if you hook a standard ATX up you will blow the board .	Sug
