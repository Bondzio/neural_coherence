<s> Hi there, I've had this problem that's been infuriating me for close to a year now. </s>
<s> When connecting my computer wirelessly to a network (any network) my connection speeds are roughly half what they are when using a wired connection. </s>
<s> I have a Netgear router and I have Cox high speed internet. </s>
<s> My speed is supposed to be rated at 7 mbps. </s>
<s> Obviously when I try different internet speed tests I get wildly different ratings for my speed (CNET says it connects at 4 mbps, some other report I am getting the full 7.) </s>
<s> What is absolutely consistent though, is that whatever speeds the service reports, if I am using a wireless connection, they will be cut roughly in half. </s>
<s> If I connect the computer to the modem directly, I get full speed. </s>
<s> If I connect it to the router with an ethernet cord, I get full speed. </s>
<s> But when using any kind of wireless signal, it's half speed. </s>
<s> To fix this, I have: A) Used different computers on my router. </s>
<s> Same deal, they're all half speed. </s>
<s> B) Connected to a nearby neighbor's network. </s>
<s> He's close enough that I'm still getting excellent, 54 mbps signal strength. </s>
<s> Half speed. </s>
<s> (3.5-4 mbps) C) Updated the firmware to my router (twice), made sure MTU was set to 1500, and turned off WEP to test speeds. </s>
<s> None of it made a difference. </s>
<s> Having changed computers AND networks, I'm forced to consider that maybe wireless speeds are always half the speed of the connection itself. </s>
<s> However a Google search hasn't pulled up any information on this, other than a few people asking the same question as me in random message boards and always receiving deafening silence in return. </s>
<s> So could some networking guru set me straight here? </s>
<s> Is it really to be expected when you lose half your internet speed when using wireless connectivity? </s>
<s> Is there some other possibility I'm overlooking here? </s>
<s> Any info anyone has would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> If so, that's it. </s>
<s> Encryption adds validation to every data packet, thus slowing [actual data] transfer speed. </s>
<s> And remember this. </s>
<s> All advertised speeds, be they wired, wireless, analog (dial-up), digital, whatever, are in perfect laboratory conditions. </s>
<s> You'll never, ever, get any rated speed, period. </s>
<s> Wayne There are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't. </s>
<s> Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software. </s>
<s> I do have WEP enabled, but I've tried it with WEP turned off as well and it made no difference. </s>
<s> I have no other encryption options turned on. </s>
<s> The SPI firewall is turned off. </s>
<s> And I certainly take your point about rated speeds never been real life speeds, but like I said, I'm pulling close to 7 megs wired, and usually less than half of that wireless. </s>
<s> If that's an expected downgrade you'd think it'd be something the router makers would bring to your attention right away to stop people from calling into their tech support lines or something. </s>
<s> Thanks for replying though </s>
