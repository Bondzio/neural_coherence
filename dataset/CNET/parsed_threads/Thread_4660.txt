<s> I'm considering a netbook or other &quot;laptop&quot; and want to go as low budget as possible. </s>
<s> Here's what I want: portable with good battery life. </s>
<s> I don't travel a lot so can deal with a little more bulk and weight but I want battery life so I can run a photo portfolio in my art booth at festivals. </s>
<s> wireless internet: want to stream Pandora in my art studio off my wireless signal on my desktop. </s>
<s> Do some notebooks &quot;receive&quot; better than others? </s>
<s> The only 2 programs other than internet and email I care about running on this computer will be adobe photoshop for editing pictures and nvu for updating my web site. </s>
<s> I'll keep all files/photos on a memory stick. </s>
<s> I know adobe is a resource hog but is it possible to put it on a budget netbook if other applications are very limited? </s>
<s> Would the HP 110 mini work for these needs? </s>
<s> thanks, annb </s>
<s> An Acer with the big battery so it runs about 4 hours during shows. </s>
<s> Yes it could go longer if I wasn't playing the show. </s>
