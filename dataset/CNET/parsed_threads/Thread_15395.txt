<s> i have a dilemma ,please help me, i cant choose between sony xperia z tablet, Samsung Galaxy Note&#174; 10.1- 2014 Edition and nexus 10, thank u </s>
<s> The only advice possible, based on the information in your post: throw a dice. </s>
<s> 1 or 2 = sony 3 or 4 = samsung 5 or 6 = nexus Kees </s>
<s> But why even get one? </s>
<s> It's not that it can do as much as a common laptop and some folk are getting caught up in the fad without trying them. </s>

<s> ok i see ur logic , any recomindations on laptops? </s>
<s> Starting with a Chromebook I can get a lot done ( http://www.howtogeek.com/161662/living-with-a-chromebook-can-you-live-with-just-a-chrome-browser/ ) and then I can find laptops for about the same price as many tablets. </s>
<s> A notable exception is the Kindle Fire HD which we get lots of us as a video player (Amazon Prime, etc.) </s>
<s> and it's not much. </s>
