<s> ....this computer tries to come on the second you plug it in..the lights on the cdrom, cdrw and the floppy flash and then..it only goes to a black screen..the green power light stays on, but the light that shows the hard drive working doesn't come on......can't get into ANYthing, ANYway. </s>
<s> have also tried to boot from restore discs....no good. </s>
<s> I have a twin to this computer and I have switched some things trying to find the problem. </s>
<s> 1. the power supply 2. the video card 3. a different monitor 4. a different hard drive I have reseated all the connections. </s>
<s> I have taken the mentioned parts and put them in the other computer and all of them seem to work fine. </s>
<s> I do wonder about the power switch...I haven't traded that off with the other computer....should the faulty computer try to boot like this when it is first plugged in? </s>
<s> The working one just sits there when you plug it in..waiting to be switched on. </s>
<s> Would it act like this if the switch were faulty....It seems to be getting power, it just won't boot up. </s>
<s> Does anyone have suggestions as to what might be wrong that I could check myself....I don't want to spend a bunch of money on this thing, would just like to get it running and sell it thanks LKM </s>
<s> There were a few, but details are too sparse for me to tell if it's one of the usual issue. </s>
