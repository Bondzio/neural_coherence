1.1.1	I am getting ready to build a PC for the first time .	St
1.1.2	It 's time to retire my Dell !	St
1.1.3	I was wondering what type of video card I should look at .	St
1.1.4	I am not a gamer , but I primarily use my PC for video editing and encoding ( AVI - MPEG2 - DVD ) .	St
1.1.5	I have had lots of overnight encoding sessions with my Dell , and I am ready for some speed .	St
1.1.6	I am planning on going with an Athlon 64 3200+ , and my mobo choice depends on what type of video card will work better for me .	St
1.1.7	Thanks for your advice !	Polite
1.2.1	Go for a PCI-EXPRESS !	St
1.2.2	As for the motherboard , get socket 939 with at least 1 PCI-EXPRESS x16 slot .	St
1.2.3	As for the motherboard specifically , well theres lot to choose from .	St
1.2.4	Get what is right for you , try to balance price with features .	St
1.2.5	ROger	St
1.3.1	Avoid PCI Express .	St
1.3.2	It 's new , but not better .	St
1.3.3	Motherboards equiped with PCI Express sockets cost more .	St
1.3.4	16x PCI Express runs faster than 8X AGP only in theory .	St
1.3.5	In the real world , AGP comes out faster almost every time .	St
1.3.6	Graphic cards are n't nearly fast enough for AGP to become a bottleneck .	St
1.3.7	PCI Express tends to be less efficient , and tasks the CPU more than AGP , especially when a big game is running , and the CPU is working at nearly 100 % .	St
1.3.8	Also , the last time I checked , the fastest graphics card aviliable is still AGP .	St
1.3.9	It 's not a matter of paying a lot more for a little bit of speed increase .	St
1.3.10	By buying PCI Express , you 'll be paying a lot more for a slower machine .	St
1.4.1	When the first AGP cards came they were n't much faster than the top PCI video cards .	St
1.4.2	But then AGP 2x then 4x and 8x came along .	St
1.4.3	We are at the same point now in the switch from AGP to PCIx .	St
1.4.4	So at this point in time if I were to build a new PC I would still go with a good AGP card .	St
1.4.5	John	St
1.5.1	Right now there is hardly any game performance difference in AGP vs PCI-Express .	St
1.5.2	I have not read anywhere that AGP is faster than PCI-E. PCI Express x16 ( double x8 ) offers an increased bandwidth of 4GB .	St
1.5.3	As always , when there is more bandwidth available , developers will find a way to put it to good use , driving the technology into the mainstream .	St
1.5.4	It may take a little time until this will really show in any applications , especially games , but future 3D games and applications will continue to become more realistic and eventually will need more bandwidth .	St
1.5.5	It can be noted that the latest motherboards being produced are looking to the furure producing PCI-Express X-16 , x1 , and x4 slots .	St
1.5.6	Also ATI & Nvidia see the future and have shifted to PCI-E , but realize there is an awful lot of current AGP boards out there and do n't want to miss out on the $ 's so are producing AGP versions of their PCI-E cards .	St
1.5.7	As someone at Tom 's Hardware once said , & quot ; It 's a case of & quot ; If you build it , they will come ! & quot ; Something like finally Intel announced in February their shift to 64-bit ( EM64T ) .	St
1.5.8	The 5xx series Processors are being replaced with the 6xx series and 8xx ( dual core ) that contain EM64T .	St
1.5.9	There is not a lot of applications currently available for 64-bit , but it will be the wave for the future and even games will be forthcoming with 64-bit and dual core applications , re Intels announcement : http : //www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20050308net.htm ? iid=search & It should also be noted that companies like Dell , HP , etc ... are now producing computers with the 6xx series ( EM64T & PCI-Express ) , and as soon as they sell out of the 5xx series , then EM64T , PCI-E , and of course Dual Core will be the computers sold for Intel .	St
1.6.1	AGP have not became a bottleneck for graphic cards , not by a long shot .	St
1.6.2	What 's with the 4GB bandwidth ?	Ques
1.6.3	Does anyone 's computer even has 4GB of memory ?	Ques
1.6.4	O_o PCI Express is more complex and creates more overhead .	St
1.6.5	Identical GPUs will always run faster on AGP than PCI Express .	St
1.6.6	GPUs nowdays are nowhere nearly fast enough for AGP to become a bottleneck , and they wo n't for the near future .	St
1.6.7	Also , they 're putting more and more onboard graphics memory .	St
1.6.8	This reduces load on the bus , as the GPU do n't have to access the main memory bank as much .	St
1.6.9	It delays that date even further .	St
1.6.10	Chances are , by the time PCI Express actually becomes useful , your computer would be obsolete anyway .	St
1.6.11	Last time I checked , the fastest graphics card is still AGP .	St
1.6.12	If you look at the present , using PCI Express is the same as paying more for a slower computer .	St
1.7.1	& quot ; the fastest graphics card is still AGP & quot ; just what card is that ?	Ques
1.8.1	Where did I or anyone say AGP has become a bottleneck .	St
1.8.2	Perhaps you have been reading too many kiddie gamer forums .	St
1.8.3	Please read my post ... it is about the future .	Sug
1.8.4	Did n't I indicate AGP & PCIe are currently about the same in performance .	St
1.8.5	Please provide a link that shows what you say..re : & quot ; Identical GPUs will always run faster on AGP than PCI Express & quot ; .	St
1.8.6	I guess some people just can not bear a change or that PCI-e is currently taking over in motherboards and video cards ... ...	St
1.9.1	Thanks for all the inputs ... I think I will go with an AGP card .	St
1.9.2	As I said I am not a gamer , so I do n't need the top of the line card .	St
1.9.3	I was looking at this card : ATI ALL-IN-WONDER Radeon 9600XT 128MB 128-bit DDR VIVO AGP 4X/8X Video Card - Retail .	St
1.9.4	Newegg ~ $ 189 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814102352 I like the TV Tuner aspect , and since my primary purpose is video editing , being able to hook up my VCR/Video Camera directly is a big plus .	St
1.9.5	The price is about as much as I want to spend .	St
1.9.6	What do you think ?	Ques
1.10.1	PCI-Express is n't high-end .	St
1.10.2	It 's standard now .	St
1.10.3	You can get some pci-express cards cheaper than the agp versions ... Roger	St
1.11.1	since u r not into gamin , this card can meet ur video needs i think ... try go look http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814102345 its 40 dollars cheaper	Sug
1.12.1	That 's definately too expensive ... ^_^ As I said , it 'll be a long while before AGP becomes a bottleneck .	St
1.12.2	Definately not in the next few years .	St
1.12.3	The thing is , by the time graphics cards reaches that speed , and PCI Express becomes the standard , the rest of your PC would be obsolete anyway .	St
1.12.4	PCI Express is definately faster , a lot faster .	St
1.12.5	It 's just this extra bandwidth does not make a difference today .	St
1.12.6	I 'm not talking about 10 years from now .	St
1.12.7	Today , here and now , PCI Express gives you no advantage in speed whatsoever .	St
1.12.8	PCI Express also creates more overhead , which actually lowers speed , especially with chipsets designed for AGP , which is the overwhelming majority of GPUs today .	St
1.12.9	You 'll be paying extra for not speed gain , and in most cases , net loss in speed .	St
1.13.1	NIL	St
1.14.1	just like the 64-bit wave , pci-express would soon dominate the market and future gfx card will only support pci-express .	St
1.14.2	i bet the gfx card manufacturers will soon stop makin agp cards just as intel will stop makin the 5xxseries prescotts .	St
1.15.1	Definitely will be in the next year or two .	St
1.15.2	Soon , ati and nvidia will stop porting their high-end cards to agp .	St
1.15.3	So basically expect the 6800 ultra to be the last agp card ...	St
1.15.4	The manufacturers wo n't stop providing agp cards , but do n't expect new models , but models avilable now .	St
1.15.5	Like the 9200se , nvidia 5200 , etc .	St
1.15.6	AGP cards will soon be stuck in time .	St
1.16.1	I wonder if any of them will come true .	St
1.16.2	They made the same assumption about PCI Express a year ago , and you know how that turned out .	St
1.16.3	Of course PCI Express is faster , no arguements there .	St
1.16.4	There is no way such things will happen in the next one or two years .	St
1.16.5	Graphics cards cant become fast enough for AGP to be a bottleneck during that time .	St
1.16.6	I 's say 3 years at least , during which your PC built today will be obsolete in any case .	St
1.16.7	You have to think about the need for a new bus .	St
1.16.8	As long as AGP is not a bottlneck , the need for PCI Express does not exist .	St
1.16.9	Getting PCI Express now will mean paying extra for no benefits .	St
1.16.10	Also , they 've been saying the same thing about 64 bit applications for a long time .	St
1.16.11	Today , there are no 64 bit applications , because there is no need for it .	St
1.17.1	NIL	St
1.18.1	There are no true 64 bit applications , only a few test cases where they made a 64 bit variants of normal applications .	St
1.18.2	These do n't offer any significant advantages anyway .	St
1.18.3	It 'll be a long time before 64 bit replaces normal as standard .	St
1.18.4	By then , a computer you build today would be obsolete anyway .	St
1.19.1	y do u keep saying & quot ; y do u keep saying & quot ; By then , a computer you build today would be obsolete anyway & quot ; i dont think so as i dont think 64-bit apps r that far off as alerady has 64-bit windows , 64-bit far cry , and intel and amd all have 64-bit processors out and i 'm sure developers r soon gon na take advantage of dat and make 64-bit apps .	St
1.20.1	There is no significant difference between normal Far Cry and 64 big Far Cry .	St
1.20.2	It 's just an adaption for the existing software which offer no real benefits of 64 bit .	St
1.20.3	I would n't consider these real 64 bit software .	St
1.20.4	64 bit windows has been around for a while .	St
1.20.5	They said that 64 bit would take over immediately after the news breaks out .	St
1.20.6	That has n't happened .	St
1.20.7	Look at the old pattern here .	St
1.20.8	People are always eager to jump on new technologies .	St
1.20.9	Eventually times do change , just not as soon as you would think .	St
1.20.10	Right now , it makes no sense to pay a lot more for no benefits .	St
