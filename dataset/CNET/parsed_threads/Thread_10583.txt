<s> I've been using this drive on my vista machine for a while now, but apparently only to read. </s>
<s> I fire up a couple of burning programs and can't get them to see the drive. </s>
<s> So I look around, see that maybe I need to use Burnrights. </s>
<s> Nope, it can't see the drive. </s>
<s> So I read somewhere that I should flash the firmware. </s>
<s> So I download the firmware flasher (Binflash and K34503CQ from dell). </s>
<s> No go, they can't see the drive either. </s>
<s> NECWinflash also says no supported devices. </s>
<s> Freakin vista. </s>
<s> Geez. </s>
<s> Drive shows up in Device Manager, but none of these programs can see it. </s>
<s> Anyone got any advice on how to proceed? </s>
<s> That is running XP or an OS that will allow this to get done. </s>
<s> However if this is just busted why not make it a warranty issue? </s>
<s> It was previously on a XP machine, worked fine for burning and reading. </s>
<s> Moved to Vista, works fine for reading. </s>
<s> Just can't get any burn program to recognize it. </s>
<s> It's either a Vista problem or a firmware problem. </s>
<s> Get it updated by a friend. </s>
<s> The manufacturers won't be good on this since a new DVDRW is all of 30 or under bucks. </s>
<s> Good luck, </s>
<s> reboot. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Just for the heck of it download a free trial of Nero to the system and try that, you have nothing to lose unless of course you have a buddy who has a Nero or Roxio disk you can load. </s>
<s> For Vista it would have to be a pretty current version of either. </s>
<s> But I would give it a shot, especially since it shows in device manager.Good luck! </s>
