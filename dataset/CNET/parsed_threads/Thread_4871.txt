<s> First, let me say, I'm very impressed with the knowledge of the members here. </s>
<s> Last weeks question about sharing files and printer between PCs prompted my own question. </s>
<s> I have a MAC G4 OS 10.2 hooked up to a HP SmartJet printer. </s>
<s> I also have a Fujitsu laptop PC running XP Pro. </s>
<s> They're both on a Linksys wireless network. </s>
<s> My question is does anyone know if it's possible to share files and the printer between the MAC and my laptop. </s>
<s> If so, how would I go about doing that? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Hi Rhender105, Yes it is possible to setup file sharing between the 2 over your network. </s>
<s> Windows isnt very &quot;friendly&quot; with non-windows computers so your non-windows computers have to trick windows into thinking its just another windows pc. </s>
<s> The way this is done is via Samba. </s>
<s> Samba is used in Linux and MacOSX environments to allow sharing of files. </s>
<s> I dont have the exact instructions for MacOSX but I'm sure Apple's website provides good information about it (I've seen it there somewhere before). </s>
<s> I may not be a MacOSX user currently but I use Linux (which both run off Unix environment) and they use a lot of the same technics and programs. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
<s> Select a folder to share on the XP machine, say My Documents, and share it. </s>
<s> Go to the Mac and &quot;connect to server&quot; and you should see the XP machine there. </s>
<s> Double click, enter the username of the XP user and the password and it should just connect. </s>
<s> I connect to a W2K machine with no problem. </s>
<s> Hope this helps too P </s>
<s> mrmacfixit, Thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> Tried it. </s>
<s> Works great. </s>
<s> Because of my work environment, I have to work with PC's most of the time. </s>
<s> So I have to have a PC at home. </s>
<s> My wife is a graphic designer, so her world is MACs. </s>
<s> She gets to have all the fun. </s>
<s> Of course, I'm on the Mac every chance I get. </s>
<s> Anyway, at home I'm the go to guy when it comes to anything tech. </s>
<s> Lately, my wife has been having trouble with applications quitting unexpectedly. </s>
<s> Safari, IE, Photoshop, Quark, and others. </s>
<s> She has a G4 mirrored front tower. </s>
<s> Running OS X 10.2.8. </s>
<s> Do you have any idea how I would go about investigating/fixing this problem. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> Rickey </s>
<s> using the Disk Utility in the Applications/Utilities folder. </s>
<s> That's a start. </s>
<s> Disk Warrior is a must have for Mac users. </s>
<s> It is a directory rebuilder. </s>
<s> Download Onyx and run the routines in that. </s>
<s> In a worst cast scenario, a Clean Archive and Install will replace the system with a new one and save all your data and settings. </s>
<s> Do NOT start deleting things you do not recognize P </s>
