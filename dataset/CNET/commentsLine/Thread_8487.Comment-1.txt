im a cad operator, i get bad eye strain looking a a 17&quot; crt monitor.
the company i work for has agreed to upgrade my monitor.
i was always under the impression the the crt monitor is better on the eyes than a lcd doing this kind of work.
i've been getting mixed answers on this issue.
any thoughts would be appreciated.
