We have one site with the internet connection router to wirless bridge to bridge via ad-hoc connection. From there we have a switch connecting to another bridge via ad-hoc to the next bridge to a switch, and this is where we run into the problem. We can hit the internet at the first two sites but the last cannot get on the internet. The last site can ping, stream video from the main router at site one but unable to connect to internet. Any ideas? We have checked gateways on all bridges computers. We set up a laptop at site one and connected no issues, the took it to site three and was unable to connect to internet. Is there some limit on ad-hoc jumps, or are we missing something. Any inputs would be helpful.

However, the 802.11 standard only briefly mentions bridging and does not define it well. I have seen many issues with bridges trying to associate with APs. Some bridges have an option to clone the first MAC that talks. They then act as a proxy for all other devices behind the bridge. Try looking for an option like this. You did not mention address scheme so I can not tell if this is a routing issue or not. Did you try a traceroute on the PC at Site 3 to your ISP DNS server or router? Are you using managed switches? Check the forwarding database on the switch to see what devices have been learned. When bridging for the first time, same vendor equipment makes a big difference. Skrall
