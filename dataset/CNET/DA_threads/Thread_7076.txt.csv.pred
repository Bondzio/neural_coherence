1.1.1	Hello , I have an older machine and ca n't afford to really get a new system atm .	St
1.1.2	I play online games like wow and ffxiv mmo , and was wondering if buying a better video card would help my bad fps problem .	St
1.1.3	I know I have a piece of crap machine so here it goes..	St
1.1.4	I have AMD Athlon 64 Dual core 3.10ghz with a Asus M3A78-CM motherboard and a Nvidia Geforce GT 240 video card .	St
1.1.5	Running Windows 7 with 4 gigs of ram .	St
1.1.6	Atm until I can afford a newer machine , all I want is better fps and it does n't need to be ultra graphics or anything , just running around without being so choppy in 25 man wow 's and normal FFXIV gameplay would be good enough .	St
1.1.7	Would a better video do this for me , and if so can you recommend a video card that will use its full potential in my motherboard without bottlenecking a great deal ?	Sug
1.1.8	Thank You	St
1.2.1	a boost within your budget http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html Only caution ... make sure you have enough PSU to support the new video .	St
1.2.2	With GPUs , the faster they go ... the more power ( PSU ) they need to drive them .	St
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	The 240 is a 70w card .	St
1.3.2	A hd 7770 is a 80w card .	St
1.3.3	Just a guess your psu will support the extra 10w .	St
1.3.4	The 7770 is quite a bit more video power but that does not mean you will see more fp/s if video power is not the hang up .	St
1.3.5	You will need a pci-e power connector from the psu ... ... best check .	St
1.4.1	Your CPU is probably not a huge issue but upgrading a graphics card that significantly improves frame rates is tricky .	St
1.4.2	You have to see what speed your PCIe slot runs at ?	Ques
1.4.3	Plus , you have to possibly upgrade power supply to run any significant card upgrade .	St
1.4.4	As I said , your motherboard maybe somewhat limiting your options if your PCIe slot runs at a 2.0 or 1.1 speed .	St
1.4.5	If its newer it might run at the higher speed .	St
1.4.6	This makes a big difference on weather a new card can fully improve speeds or is de clocked because of your motherboard .	St
