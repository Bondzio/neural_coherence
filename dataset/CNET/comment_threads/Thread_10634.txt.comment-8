Has anyone with this phone been able to connect to a router?
I've tried the same things as jesseelev and haven't had any luck connecting this phone to my Linksys WRT54G.
There must be something beyond the user settings that is blocking the connection.
It does work at HotSpots, but have yet to get it to connect to any other unsecure wi-fi network.
Thanks for any help you can offer.
