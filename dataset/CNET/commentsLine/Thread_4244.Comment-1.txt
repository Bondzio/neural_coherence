my hard drive recently stopped working after my laptop took a fall.
i replaced the hd with a new one and re-installed the os (win7) so my laptop is up and running again.
here's the hard part, i used a usb to sata converter for my old hard drive to pull the data off, i've recovered a good portion of the files now how do i put them to use on my laptop with the new hd?
i've copied the files from the old hd and saved them in a folder already.
it's mostly pics, music, and documents.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
