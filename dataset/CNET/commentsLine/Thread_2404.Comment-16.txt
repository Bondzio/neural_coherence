part 1 well im going to ramble on with a long story.
unfortunately as it is right now ive got some time (laid-off) im downloading mandrake linux 10.0 iso #1 on hal the athlon upstairs and iso #2 on daisy my thinkpad 570e.while i type this.
this should tell you that im obsessed with being able to dump windows.
you see the last three attempts at migrating my pcs to linux have failed miserably due to the #$%$%^ dlink wifi cards that i have.
they use an acx_100 chip from memorex who apparently wont release a binary driver for linux and all the hacks and alleged roll-ur-own drivers have yet to get me a linux installation that will let me use my #$%$^% dlink cards.
but thats another story, ill never buy another wifi product unless its cisco.
first off let me just say that ive had a bazaar fascination with formatting hard drives ever since the days of typing debug g=c800:5 if you know what that does you are old too.
you see it all started when i emailed a guy named steve gibson about the new program he was selling called spinrite that could optimize hard drive interleave with a non-destructive low level format.
i had the only combination in the world that could not be optimized.
i had a seagate st-238rl in an amstrad 8086-8 that got hot-roded with a nec v20-10.
the particular combination with processor speed maxed best throughput at 10:1 while every other hard drive of the era interleaved at 3:1, finally gave up and just figured it was a processor wait state issue.
i think i spent about three zillion hours in the ibmhw sigs on compu$erve and genie.
