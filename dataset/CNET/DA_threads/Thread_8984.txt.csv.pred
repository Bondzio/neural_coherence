1.1.1	Can I use a USB External adapter instead of a wireless card for a laptop ?	Ques
1.1.2	Such as a 802.11g Wireless USB Stick .	St
1.1.3	Thanks for any assist .	St
1.1.4	mm	St
1.2.1	Then yes .	Res
1.3.1	My son is using a dell inspiron 4000 .	St
1.3.2	It does have usb ports so I think it would support the USB adapter .	St
1.3.3	I am new with wireless and I just wanted to make sure that the USB adapter would basically perform the same function as a wireless card .	St
1.3.4	Thank you mm	St
1.4.1	USB 1.1 or 2 ?	Ques
1.4.2	Either will work for plain internet , but the faster USB 2 is needed for reasonable network transfer speeds .	St
1.4.3	Is the operating system Windows XP ?	Ques
1.4.4	That is needed for the best security levels ( WPA ) as the older operating systems do n't support high security without additional software .	St
1.4.5	Also consider the physical equipment .	St
1.4.6	The wireless card slips into to the slot and just has the end sticking out .	St
1.4.7	The USB adapter has a wire that drapes across the desk and you have to find a place to put the antenna .	St
1.4.8	The USB ports are popular gathering places for all sorts of other external devices - printer , iPod , memory key , etc .	St
1.4.9	for which there are no other options for connecting , and this would just add to the competition for port docking rights .	St
1.4.10	And then there is the reason for having a laptop in the first place - portability .	St
1.4.11	When the laptop is moved from place to place , the card is one piece that just slips into its slot while the USB adapter requires an effort to set up and rearrange every time .	St
1.4.12	My suggestion for a laptop would be the card unless you have a compelling reason for some nuance that only a USB adapter can satisfy .	St
