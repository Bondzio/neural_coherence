1.1.1	My desktop is a HP Pentium 4 CPU 2.00 GHz, 512 Mg RAM, XP-SP2.	St
1.1.2	Sound card = 82801BA/BAM AC'97 Audio Controller w/legacy drivers.	St
1.1.3	The sound is yuk, scratchy, hissy.	St
1.1.4	When I plug speakers into my Toshiba Satellite A35-S159, it sounds perfect.	St
1.1.5	It has Realtec AC97 Audio with legacy audio drivers and Audio Codecs.	St
1.1.6	I don't understand all the tech spec's, but my hunch is my HP Pentium is an old PC and probably needs a better sound card; or, probably needs to be decommissioned and get another.	St
1.1.7	But, any ideas (reasonable priced) that I might consider that would make my music sound good from my old HP PC like it does on my Toshiba laptop?	St
1.2.1	a new sound card is only about $30.	St
