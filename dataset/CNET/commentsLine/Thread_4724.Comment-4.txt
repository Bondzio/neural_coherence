well i had a brain cramp when i set things up.
i did not set the router up for wpa encryption first.
for those interested, here's what i did.
i went to the router (wpn824) setup configuration screen and set up encryption for wpa accessing it through my wired computer.
funny thing after i did this, the wireless computer dropped out as it wasn't set up for encryption (since i was having problems as previously described).
i then set up the wireless wpn111 usb adapter for wpa encryption and all seems fine now.
funny how the netgear tech did not bother to run down the setup sequence and figure this out.
seems he must have assumed that i set up the router via the wired computer already but that wouldn't have made sense the wireless computer had access without encryption.
