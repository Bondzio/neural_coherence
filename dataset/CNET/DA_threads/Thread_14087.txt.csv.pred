1.1.1	I'm not stupid.	St
1.1.2	i know enough about Computers to happy call myself an 'Advanced' User.	St
1.1.3	not an expert yet, but I'm not far off (I'm not being cocky, I'm just trying to set the scene).	St
1.1.4	there is only one thing i have not being able to work out.	St
1.1.5	How the hell does Cache play a role in CPU performance.	St
1.1.6	i know there is L1 L2 and L3 (i think) and one is bigger than the other because its faster to search a small amount of memory.	St
1.1.7	but i don't fully understand it.	St
1.1.8	can someone give me either an overview, or if you can be bothered, an in depth explanation of Cache.	Ques
1.1.9	i tried googling it but all i got was the above.	St
1.1.10	Thanks in Advanced.	St
1.2.1	further to places like http:\\www.Tomshardware.com http:\\www.	St
1.2.2	anandtech.com Bottom line...if the CPU can cache commands or data...then it doesn't have to go off die to slower system RAM, or to disk.	St
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	http://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=what+is+cpu+cache&btnG=Google+Search&fp=vhWuhnUzW5w	St
1.4.1	But as I said I've done that little search, and gleamed what I can from it.	St
1.4.2	I want a nicer explanation of what it is, what it does, and how it effects performance.	St
1.5.1	The cpu wants data.	St
1.5.2	If that data is in the cache it's only a few feet away.	St
1.5.3	If that data is in the ram it's a 1000 miles away.	St
1.5.4	Think time.	St
1.5.5	Think supply chain.	St
1.5.6	If the cpu goes idle while waiting for data your perf falls out of bed.	St
1.5.7	If your looking for an in-depth analysis on how cpu cache works....magic....black box...data in/data out.	St
1.6.1	imagine you work at a desk and constantly have people asking you do some paperwork to files.	St
1.6.2	there are millions of files that you're responsible for and you handle thousands of requests each day.	St
1.6.3	all of the files are stored in a big warehouse and when you get a request you figure out what files you'll need.	St
1.6.4	since it takes a long time to trot out to the warehouse, you bring the files you need to the departmental file area.	St
1.6.5	some files that you work on often into your office filing cabinets.	St
1.6.6	since you're a smart worker, you move those files that you work on frequently and keep them in your desk drawers.	St
1.6.7	anything that you're actively working on is on your desk.	St
1.6.8	while you're working on files, you make notes and some calculations.	St
1.6.9	those stay in your office but you throw them away when you're done with the file.	St
1.6.10	since you only have so much room on your desk and you get a lot of work requests and make lots of notes, you have to constantly move files from your desk, to your drawers and cabinets and the warehouse.	St
1.6.11	if a file is on your desk you can process it quicker than one in your desk, and a file in your desk drawer is handier than one in the cabinet, and so forth.	St
1.6.12	when you take a lunch break or leave for the night, a filing clerk dutifully puts all of the files back in the warehouse.	St
1.6.13	a bigger desk would improve your efficiency.	St
1.6.14	likewise, bigger file drawers and bigger office cabinets would speed you up also.	St
1.6.15	but if you can't hold everything you're working on in your office and the departmental file area, you'll slow down a lot since you'll be shuffling files back and forth to the warehouse often.	St
1.6.16	in this analogy, the warehouse is your hard disk.	St
1.6.17	your departmental fire area is your ram.	St
1.6.18	your office is level 3 cache.	St
1.6.19	your desk drawers are level 2 cache.	St
1.6.20	your desk is level 1 cache.	St
1.7.1	That, was absolutely Perfect.	St
1.7.2	Thank you very very much.	St
1.7.3	well done good sir	Polite
1.8.1	Yes indeed, thank you.	Polite
1.8.2	I've wondered, asked, and danced on the edge of understanding till I read your analogy.	St
1.8.3	onionson	St
1.9.1	but with a few tweaks.	St
1.9.2	The warehouse is for seldom used files, this is the hard drive.	St
1.9.3	You have a row of filing cabinets right behind your table, this being RAM that stores frequently used programs and some files.	St
1.9.4	No desk, a table instead, where you keep what your working on &quot;now&quot; this is CPU cache storage.	St
1.9.5	(Still a little clunky but closer.	St
1.9.6	RAM and some hard drives also have caches.)	St
1.9.7	Why all this?	St
1.9.8	I CPU can not wait, if it waits, you wait.	St
1.9.9	I hate to wait.	St
1.9.10	Do you hate to wait?	St
1.9.11	Better yet, why wait?	St
