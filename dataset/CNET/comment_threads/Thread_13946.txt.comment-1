I am wanting to upgrade from my hardy yet outdated nVidia GeForce Ti 4200 64MB.
I was told by a Dell support person that 64MB was the highest I could go due to how the computer is made.
So that limits my options significantly.
I was wondering if anyone has any advice on this, like what is the best 64MB video card I can get.
I play games a lot, thus I am upgrading.
Any help would be great.
