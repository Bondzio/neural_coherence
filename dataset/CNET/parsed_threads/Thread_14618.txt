<s> I am having a problem with my computer itself, not the rest of the network. </s>
<s> My computer drops it's connection and it can't be repaired usually. </s>
<s> I have to reboot to get the connection back, and then it drops again. </s>
<s> I wasn't sure which forum to post in, so posted the problem in the Computer Help Forum. </s>
<s> I don't mean to cross-post or whatever it might be called and i apologize if I am inadvertently violating a forum posting rule. </s>
<s> The post in the other forum is Computer connection problems, please take a look at it if you can, thanks </s>
<s> As I said in my post over in the other forum, I posted here before checking the forums for some of the other software. </s>
<s> It seems that the problem COULD be some of the AVG exe's weren't given full permissions in my firewall and that might be the problem. </s>
<s> So anyone using AVG and a firewall having this problem should visit this post in the AVG forums: http://freeforum.avg.com/read.php?14,169312,backpage=,sv= And the link to my post in the other forum in case anyone wants to read a more detailed description of the problem I was having is: http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6620_102-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=328534&tag=unsubscribeForm;tracked-disc Again, sorry for posting in here before I checked the other forums, and sorry for posting in 2 different forums </s>
