this morning i tried turning my desktop PC on and it wouldn't boot.
No power light on, and on closer inspection the fan turns feebly for half a second or so, then it all stops.
I have tried unplugging the power cable and plugging it in again, which has worked before with this issue, but no luck this time.
any suggestions of what this could be?
How do I fix it?
