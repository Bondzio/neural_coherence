In fact my Hobby Truck was broken into and several high-dollar radio control planes and transmitters were removed. I would like to do some sort of video surveillance of my driveway, recording to a hard drive. Wireless would be ideal since this would have to mount over the garage door and is on the other side of the house from my office. What I would see as ideal is maybe a motion sensor that only records when theres activity, and I would like to be able to have it run passively on a spare PC, logging onto a hard drive Do you know of anything turn-key that would do this? Or is there some way I can cobble something together that will get me there? Im running WinXP Pro on some homemade boxes- willing to install large HDs if needed. Thanks for considering this.
