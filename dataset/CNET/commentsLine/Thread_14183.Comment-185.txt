i had my first computer on 1988, it was an imb xt, an old dinasour with 10mb hdd, 128kb ram, 5.25&quot; fdd and a very slow processor (intel 8088 - 4.7mhz).
with a dos operating system and monochrome crt monitor (green characters).
at that time i had to connect to the primitive internet (usenet) thru a dial-up us robotics modem of 9.6kbps.
a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then.
