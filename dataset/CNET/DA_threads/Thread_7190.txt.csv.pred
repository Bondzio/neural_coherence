1.1.1	I 'm getting a new computer for my mom .	St
1.1.2	She now has a four-year old emachine .	St
1.1.3	The only reason we 're upgrading is because she wants high-speed internet and her current machine does n't support it .	St
1.1.4	She basically does email , AOL , web surfing , word processing , printing , copying and faxing .	St
1.1.5	She may get into some low-in web development but nothing much .	St
1.1.6	I 've found two HPs both on sale at Best Buy .	St
1.1.7	I can get one with all-in-one printer , Pavillion a804n ( Celeron 335 ) , and 17 in flat CRT for about $ 616 , after rebates , including taxes .	St
1.1.8	The Pavilion a1000n ( Celeron 340 ) with basically the same features goes for about $ 675 , after rebates , including taxes .	St
1.1.9	She 'll end up with two printers either way , the one that comes with the bundle which we 'll probably trash and the all-in-one she really wants ( HP Office Jet 5510 ) .	St
1.1.10	My question : is it worth paying the $ 60 extra to get the Celeron 340 ?	Ques
1.1.11	My brother hates emachines ( awful experience ) and since he 's splitting the cost with me , hp is the way we 're going to go .	St
1.1.12	Thanks for you help .	St
1.1.13	Angie	St
1.2.1	the hps are not a bargain .	St
1.2.2	Get the emachines t6212 , when it 's on sale , its a lot cheaper and emachines has changed for the better recently .	St
1.2.3	I had problems and called them and their customer support was great .	St
1.2.4	They sent me a brand new dl dvd+_rw drive to replace the broken one .	St
1.2.5	Get the emachines , they 're not a bad company since acquistion by gateway .	St
1.2.6	I own 2 recent Compaq machines and 1 emachine t5026 also recent .	St
1.2.7	They 're both good , but for the value , i would go for the emachine ... You wo n't find many complaints of the t6212 by people here on cnet .	St
1.2.8	As for the question , the 335 and 340 , it 's just the clockspeed .	St
1.2.9	It 's not worth 60 to just get a higher clock speed .	St
1.2.10	Celerons are really bad processors .	St
1.2.11	The emachines comes with an AMD 64 , with 64-bit support for the future and a pci-express ( x16 ) slot for graphics upgrades .	St
1.2.12	ROger	St
1.3.1	cant seem to find the a804n at bestbuy .	St
1.3.2	however i dont think there is a difference just dat the a804n is a older model i think .	St
1.3.3	also , just out of curiosity , what was wrong with ur brothers emachine as i own one and so far it has been excellent and when i had a problem with my dvd drive , they sent me a replacement in 4 days .	St
1.4.1	my mom had to return her initial machine twice , but remember this was four years ago .	St
1.4.2	She ended up satisfied so my brother decided to go emachines .	St
1.4.3	A nightmare .	St
1.4.4	He finally returned the machine and got his money back , but American Express had to get involved .	St
1.4.5	It was the worst customer service experience I 'd ever heard of .	St
1.4.6	Even though my mom has had no problems with her machine , my brother wo n't even consider another emachine .	St
1.4.7	I liked them but I also want him to pay half the cost so I 'm giving in .	St
1.4.8	Oh , yes , it 's HP a804n-b or a804x-b .	St
1.4.9	I don'tlike what I 've been hearing about HP but I figure if it works out of the box , we 're good to go .	St
1.4.10	If it does n't , we take it back to BestBuy for a refund .	St
1.4.11	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.12	Angie	St
1.5.1	I 've tried but my brother is not budging .	St
1.5.2	His past emachines experience has soured him completely .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	Emachines is a great company and they make great computers .	St
1.7.2	They have risen from the bottom to one of the top dogs .	St
1.7.3	I was hesitant at first but now I 'm more than satisfied .	St
1.7.4	I 've had my T3256 for about 6 months now .	St
1.7.5	There has n't been any problems what-so-ever , not even one glich .	St
1.7.6	It 's performed like a champ , has taken everything I 've thrown at it .	St
1.7.7	( wow we 're such nerds ) Just search emachines in these forums and you 'll find maybe 1 negative thing .	St
1.7.8	Search Dell and you get Dell sucks ! !	St
1.7.9	blah blah .	St
1.7.10	Not that I dislike Dell , just Emachines has a much better rep. My next OEM computer purchase will probably be an Emachines again .	St
1.7.11	Cuz they 're just that good .	St
1.7.12	Haha	St
1.8.1	The machine needs more memory , a hard drive upgrade , a NIC , a new operating system .	St
1.8.2	It 's more than four years old so it does n't have a DVD or a CDRW .	St
1.8.3	I just think it 's time for a newer model .	St
1.8.4	We 've offered the present machine to a cousin who does n't have a computer and she does n't want it .	St
1.8.5	Too old , she said .	St
1.8.6	Go figure .	St
1.8.7	FYI : I went to Best Buy last year to buy a computer for my mom and had an emachine in my shopping cart .	St
1.8.8	The clerk advised me not to buy it ; said a lot of people had been bringing them back .	St
1.8.9	Honestly , I had it in my shopping cart and he talked me out of it .	St
1.8.10	I could n't believe it .	St
1.8.11	I left with a monitor .	St
1.8.12	Yes , her monitor went out last year .	St
1.8.13	Like I said , after the false starts , my mom did n't have any trouble with her emachine .	St
1.8.14	Let 's hope the HP holds out as long .	St
1.8.15	If it does n't , my brother will get it in both ears .	St
1.8.16	Angie	St
1.9.1	I work at BestBuy and emachines are by far the biggest selling computer out there .	St
1.9.2	You get more bang for your buck .	St
1.9.3	Our repair shop atleast in my store see 's more HP 's and Dells in for repair , and we dont even sell Dell lol .	St
1.10.1	I 've had both HP and eMachines and no trouble with either brand , they are both well made machines .	St
1.10.2	At least the ones i 've had .	St
1.10.3	I think a lot of the trouble folks have is the error message : PEBKAC , lol	St
