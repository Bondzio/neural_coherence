since the beginning i never trusted wifi open networks you see out there.
for years i knew about packet sniffing since i was designing electronics and firmware that did such things.
then meant i would never do much other than read the news on open wifi.
and i was very late to accept buying things on the net.
and even then i never do so on open wifi.
