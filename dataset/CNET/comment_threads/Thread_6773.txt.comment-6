I think you need to buy a new computer.
It is not a good idea to upgrade your computer's video card.
Reason: 1) Your on-board video chip You are going to spend time to figure out how to disable it before installing the new video card.
2) Your processor: Intel Celeron 633 is too slow to take advantage of today's video card.
The only upgrade I think is to add more hard drive if you just use your PC for browing web, doing some home work or using microsoft office application.
If you want to use your PC for gamming, throw away your current PC and buy a new one.
