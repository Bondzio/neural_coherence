I bought a used G4 and it worked OK for a bit but it used to lose the time and date.
One day, it wouldn't start at all, so I worked out it was probably a PRAM problem and changed the internal battery.
The new battery measures OK on my (admittedly very basic) meter but nothing happens when I try to power up the machine.
I have checked and there is mains voltage going to the power supply.
Any ideas?
