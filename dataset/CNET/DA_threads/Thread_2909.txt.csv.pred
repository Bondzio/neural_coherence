1.2.1	If you know you have a SATA HD , then you need a SATA port connection .	St
1.2.2	If you have -NONE- on mtrbd .	St
1.2.3	then you need to bet a SATA type i/f card to mount in mtrbd .	St
1.2.4	slot .	St
1.2.5	Since , you also provided nothing in the details of your mtrbd .	St
1.2.6	or PC in specific , I leave it at that .	St
1.2.7	Otherwise , check you manual , PC maker , or mtrbd .	St
1.2.8	maker support website if no manual and/or review details of adding a SATA HD if so ported .	St
