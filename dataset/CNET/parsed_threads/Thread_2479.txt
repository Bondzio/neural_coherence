<s> HI Currently i am using the Lacie 2 Big Qudra 1 TB Actually it holds 2 Hard drives of 500 gb each My Question: Is it possible to upgrade and replace the hard drives to an 2 TB each so i will have 4 TB total. </s>
<s> I notided that lacie have the same model with 4 TB hard drives. </s>
<s> I askd lacie support and got the answer that it might not work as the computer wont recognise the drives. </s>
<s> Cant understand why ? </s>
<s> Haim </s>
<s> The internal controller components might or not be the same or of the same firmware revision. </s>
<s> If Lacie released the two products at precisely the same time, I'd think your chances are better. </s>
<s> If the bigger disk was released later, your chances of success grow slimmer. </s>
<s> I replaced them with 1.5 TB drives each. </s>
<s> No Luck. </s>
<s> Funny thing is, the techs at LaCie told me: &quot;You can replace a 500GB drive with drives of other sizes, but it will only recognize the smaller drive.&quot; Oh yeah? </s>
<s> And replacing them with 2 larger drives does what, exactly? </s>
<s> If they were honest, they would have told us BOTH up front, that the computer would only recognize the original size drive, no bigger. </s>
<s> They DID get more of my money, but at what cost, LaCie? </s>
<s> Do you ever think I will buy another over-priced drive? </s>
<s> I thought I was buying from a quality company, not one with customer service nood-nicks who didn't know their products... </s>
<s> There is a real HD limit with both involved that a controller can'thandle above 3Tb using old h/w. </s>
<s> All those newer 3gb HDs or combo need a supplied i/f card or adapter in order to get things going. </s>
<s> As each maker/vendor can cutomize a setup, changing whatever the HD setup could cause issues. </s>
<s> While, I don't have the specs for each, the quick test is simply install them and try to use the new HDs. </s>
<s> If it doesn't work, then you come back and tell the outcome. </s>
<s> The physcial part of swapping the HDs out isn't hard to do but will it work. </s>
<s> Alas, maybe googling elsewhere could supply a hack on the topic. </s>
<s> Afterall, its going to be a proper subject as these HDs become more cheaper. </s>
<s> Also, understand that customize may mean also a limited setup as it won't support larger or outside what it was sold as to deter end-user upgrades. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
