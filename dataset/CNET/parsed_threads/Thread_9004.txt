<s> Hello, Currently I have DSL in my room for purposes such as using it for my computer and my Xbox 360. </s>
<s> However, my parents finally decided that they would like to create a network with my dsl, but the dsl is too slow when used with one object and another at the same time. </s>
<s> So, we've decided to pick up with cable, which means I will have to end my subscription with verizon dsl and begin with RoadRunner (timewarner). </s>
<s> I heard that cable is much faster then dsl which is a good thing, But when one of the guys came over to install basically (set up the modem on my moms computer, I asked him a few questions; because I wanted to know what I needed to look for. </s>
<s> Regardless, he told me that you can't set up a wired network with the cable. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> Second, he told me that I would have to go wireless, which means that its proabbly going to cost a lot more then if I go wired. </s>
<s> (Having to add an additonal $80+ for a xbox 360 network adapter) My main question is that is there anyone with cable that uses a router that is directly connected to all your devices? </s>
<s> Thanks for the time. </s>
<s> Get a cable modem and a wireless router. </s>
<s> I've had Comcast (now Time Warner/Roadrunner) for years. </s>
<s> One of the first things I did was get a D-link wireless router. </s>
<s> It has four ports for wired and can handle 11 wireless connections (one for each channel). </s>
