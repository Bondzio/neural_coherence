Hello, Today I got my 7.1 usb external sound card from Startech ( http://eu.startech.com/product/ICUSBAUDIO7D-USB-7-Channel-Audio-Adapter-with-SPDIF ).
The S/PDIF out works like a charm, but when I plug my Roccat Kave 5.1 headset in, I only get 2.1 sound (front speakers).
I cannot get the other speakers to work.I installed the driver from the cd I got with the sound card.&lt;div&gt; How could I get it to produce 5.1 sound instead of just 2.1?
Computer specs:&lt;div&gt;Laptop with Windows 7 Home premium 64-bit Intel i7 2Ghz, 6Gb ram &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Thank you in advance
