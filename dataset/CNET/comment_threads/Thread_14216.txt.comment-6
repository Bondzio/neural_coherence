I recently bought a Netgear WN2000RPT unit http://www.amazon.co.uk/Netgear-Universal-WiFi-Range-Extender/dp/B003LAD8BY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1352280572&sr=8-2 Within 5 minutes the extender was up and running and a strong-excellent signal across the first floor of our house.
If you want to use an old Netgear router, I have also tried this in the past and took it wired into another part of the house; not as flexible though as the above wireless unit.
