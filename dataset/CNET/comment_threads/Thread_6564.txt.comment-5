I have been using DVDCopy express (no longer supported) and used to get great burns.
I've since re-formatted and may have deleted some files(???
); the fact is I'm having the same problem.
Don't even &quot;see a disc&quot; message.
but plays well in the original burniong PC.
I am going to try another burner perhaps.
Please let me know if you have a solution.
Thanks.
