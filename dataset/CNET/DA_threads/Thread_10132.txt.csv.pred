1.1.1	New custom built PC .	St
1.1.2	MSI P965 Neo motherboard ( SATA , Core 2 Duo ) .	St
1.1.3	DVD/CD-burner via IDE .	St
1.1.4	Shop installed XP Media Center Edition and Nero .	St
1.1.5	Problems : 1 .	St
1.1.6	Playing an audio CD gives ticks and cracks , like a heavily damaged LP .	St
1.1.7	No problems at all playing streaming audio or mp3 's from the hard disk .	St
1.1.8	2 .	St
1.1.9	No obvious problems with installing programs from CD 's .	St
1.1.10	3 .	St
1.1.11	Very strange behaviour when burning a CD : - time to read the CD ( 700 Mb data or audio ) is rather long : about 5 minutes - time to write CD at 40x ( 6 Mb/sec ) is about 20 minutes in stead of 2 - Task Manager & gt ; Processes tabs is normal : idle 99 % , Nero : 1 % , as expected - Task Manager & gt ; Performance however shows one of the cores alternating between 0 and 80 % use , and that 's absurd - this practically slows other programs on the computer ( like MS Word ) to a crawl and totally unworkable ( why does n't the other core do it 's job ? )	Ques
1.1.12	- Nero reports some 600 buffer underruns avoided on a machine doing nothing else as this burning , and that 's absurd also The sales assistant in the shop suspected BIOS settings ( which I did n't touch ) .	St
1.1.13	I do n't have any idea except that it seems like a hardware issue to me , but I ca n't even guess if it 's the burner or the motherboard .	St
1.1.14	Of course I 've got warranty and I 'll bring it in for repair when I leave for a 1 week holiday in May ( do n't do so much burning ) .	St
1.1.15	And I expect that the tech will have the resources to find the problem .	St
1.1.16	I did n't dare yet to try to burn a DVD or install another burning program ; I leave that to the tech .	St
1.1.17	Does anybody have any ideas about a possible cause ?	Ques
1.1.18	Kees	St
1.2.1	Link about - & gt ; http : //winhlp.com/WxDMA.htm Then again I 've lost count on how many times I see shop installed Windows that are & quot ; not done yet. & quot ; Most will just use what CDs came with the motherboard .	St
1.2.2	Some wo n't bother with even that .	St
1.2.3	Also noteworthy is a recurring speed issue on CDR media .	St
1.2.4	The bulk back of CDR is marked 52X but if you examine the media with tools you find it 's only 16X media .	St
1.2.5	When you confront the seller they note it 's & quot ; compatible with 52X recorders. & quot ; If you have Alcohol 120 % you can record at full speed then get a graph of the speed achieved during the burn .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	The motherboard has 6 SATA connections , and 1 ATA IDE supporting one master and one slave .	St
1.3.2	In Device Manager , under IDE-controllers , there 's the 2 port SATA , then the 4 port SATA , then 3 primary IDE channels , then 3 secondary IDE channels , and then the Standard Dual Channel PCI IDE Controller .	St
1.3.3	All 6 IDE channels but the third primary can be 'disabled ' ( red cross ) .	St
1.3.4	All 3 primary channels are UDMA mode 6 .	St
1.3.5	All 3 secondary channels are & quot ; DMA , if available & quot ; , which is n't applicable for the first 2 ( apparently not connected to anything ) and results in PIO-mode for the third ( which is the CD-drive , because if I disable that the cd-drive disappears from Windows Explorer ) .	St
1.3.6	So the CD is PIO indeed , I 'd say .	St
1.3.7	The tech may find out why there 3 are instances of each of the channels in stead of 1 , why the CD is secondary in stead of primary , and why apparently DMA is n't available .	St
1.3.8	After all , he installed it like this .	St
1.3.9	That is , of course , if it 's really a PIO-DMA problem .	St
1.3.10	But you could very well be right .	St
1.3.11	Thanks for the help thus far .	St
1.3.12	Kees	St
1.4.1	Maybe go in there and waggle it while the thing is playing .	St
1.4.2	Obviously the ripped music to the harddrive plays ok , right ?	Ques
1.5.1	Bob , It definitely was a PIO-DMA problem on the IDE DVD-drive .	St
1.5.2	Later on I noticed I could n't even view a DVD movie on it : it went stuttering on half speed .	St
1.5.3	The tech checked everything , and all was fine , but she found the SATA hard disk highly unreliable with & quot ; several blue screens during the Repair & quot ; .	St
1.5.4	I never had any problems with it .	St
1.5.5	A clean install of Windows on that hard disk did n't help .	St
1.5.6	So she put in another hard disk , and after a clean install of Windows on that one everything was fine .	St
1.5.7	She even backed up and copied the full contents of my old hard disk to the new one ( $ 40 for half an hour work ) , not really necessary , because I had most of it backed up myself , of course .	St
1.5.8	All I have to do now is reinstall all my programs , apply some 50 hot fixes , make new users and in all of them redo all changed settings and all Firefox extensions , clean the desktop , reorganise the Start menu , that 's $ 0 for 2 evenings work .	St
1.5.9	I do n't understand why replacing a SATA drive would make any difference for the workings of IDE on this motherboard ( MSI P965 Neo ) .	St
1.5.10	The old one was a SATA2 Samsung SP2504C , the new one an SATA Hitachi HDS721616PLA380 SCSI drive , and Belarc 's description of the DVD-drive suddenly got & quot ; SCSI & quot ; inside it also .	St
1.5.11	I really do n't understand the hardware details ( SATA2 versus SATA , and why SCSI ) , but it seems to be effective : the IDE details in Device Manager do look different and the DVD movie is playing full speed .	St
1.5.12	I suddenly had a RAID driver icon in the system tray , that was a surprise I 'll have to evaluate .	St
1.5.13	The new hard disk even shows itself in the & quot ; safely remove hardware & quot ; dialog together with the USB-stick and the memory card reader .	St
1.5.14	That 's another surprise .	St
1.5.15	Any idea what will happen if I try to remove it with Windows running ?	Ques
1.5.16	Unluckily , the old drive was 250 Gb , and the new one 164 Gb .	St
1.5.17	That 's clear even to a hardware layman like me , so it 's back to the shop again .	St
1.5.18	All the sales lady ( I think she 's the owners wife ) could say was & quot ; sorry & quot ; , and it will be the first thing to redo for the tech on Monday .	St
1.5.19	But the prospects are rather good now .	St
1.5.20	Kees	St
1.6.1	But the reasons why Windows takes a dive is fairly well discussed .	St
1.6.2	The repeating issues I encounter are motherboard chipset drivers and that setting .	St
1.6.3	You may have seen me write about the DMA FLIP many times .	St
1.6.4	It 's a simple procedure and one that must be done even if you see XP report & quot ; DMA. & quot ; Why ?	Ques
1.6.5	It lies .	St
