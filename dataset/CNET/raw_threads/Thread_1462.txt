Just recently the keyboard typing rate on all applications has really slowed down. I have checked some of the standard things, spywear scan, accessibility setting, keyboard setting, but all look normal. I have re-booted into Safe Mode and the problem goes away!! Does anyone have a suggestion how to fix it? Thanks in advance for your help.

Disable the ATI HotKey Poller service in Windows. Go to Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Administrative Tools-&gt;Services You should see the ATI HotKey Poller Services listed. Right Click on it and select properties. Halfway down the screen you should see the &quot;Startup type.&quot; Choose disabled from the drop-down list, click apply, close out all applications and reboot. This should resolve your issues.
