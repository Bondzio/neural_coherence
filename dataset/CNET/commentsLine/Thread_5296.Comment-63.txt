ok integrated means that the hardware exists on the motherboard.
it's not a seperate one like geforce.
for laptops it may say intel gma something.
integrated cards are not, i repeat not for games.
especially if you are bying a laptop.
i have a geforce 8600 gs for my laptop and it can not handle all games.
anyway you need a graphics card lets say geforce 9 with at least 512 memory and ram 2 or 3 at gb especially with windows 7 depends on the games you want to play ps are you buying online?
you may upgrate layer if not if you are bying a laptop i recommend 3 or 4 years guaranty and if that laptop finally has a seperate geforce card you must get a laptop cooler sotiris baimpos msc computing
