<s> I have a microsoft optical mouse 2.0 and when I turn of my computer, the mouse stays on. </s>
<s> Should it turn off or do I have to do it manually? </s>
<s> From http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=325975 &quot;SYMPTOMS When you connect any of the Microsoft IntelliMouse products listed in the &quot;Applies to&quot; section of this article to your computer through the PS2 port, the light on the mouse stays lit when you turn the computer off. </s>
<s> CAUSE The PS2 port continues to supply power after you turn the computer off. </s>
<s> RESOLUTION To resolve this issue, you can use the USB port to connect your device to the computer. </s>
<s> If all of the available USB ports are in use, you can purchase a USB hub. </s>
<s> A USB hub increases the number of USB devices that you can connect to your computer. </s>
<s> If the continuous mouse light is acceptable to you, you can safely leave the mouse connected to the PS2 port. </s>
<s> &quot; </s>
<s> Is that a cordless, optical mouse? </s>
<s> If yes, the light better stay on. </s>
<s> If it doesn't, you will need to replace the batteries in the mouse. </s>
<s> I'm not absolutely sure if it's an optical mouse with a cord that plugs into your PC, but I would thing it the light should go off when you shut-off it's power source, which, of course is the PC it plugs into. </s>
<s> I've never heard of a mouse with an on/off switch. </s>
