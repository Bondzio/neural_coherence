that's the dilemma for you - it's not likely that the opterons will drop in price - they're not technically consumer chips, and the opteron division is healthy - no reason for them to cut prices.
the x2s will be dropping by up to 50% in the next couple of weeks in anticipation of competition with intel's conroes.
they next motherboard that i will buy for a 939 will be the dfi lanparty nf4 ultra.
pair that with an opteron 165 or 170 with 2gigs ocz pc4000 ram, and you'll likely hit 300+ x 9 or 10 = 2.7 - 3.0 ghz + with the proper settings.
so, you have to decide - go with an x2 in the $200 region, or spend another $150-200 on a chip that has the potential for 3.0 ghz.
