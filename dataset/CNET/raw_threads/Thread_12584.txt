I'd like to install the new base unit in a bedroom where my desktop PC is located. There's also a Linksys WRT54G router in that same bedroom. I've been reading some user reviews on some of the newer cordless phones, the biggest complaints have been interference with wireless routers. My old phone which I'm replacing is a Panasonic 5.4 model. Do the new 6.0 cordless phone models work good if they are set up in a room that also has a WRT54G wireless router?

Never a blip on either the phone(s) or the modem. I have changed channels, though. Since I researched the specific frequencies before hand, I'll let you do the same.

Gee, thanks. Correct me if I'm wrong here, my Linksys WRT54G wireless router operates at 2.4Ghz, my current Panasonic cordless phone which I want to replace operates at 5.8Ghz, 5.8Ghz phones are still being sold and there's the new cordless phone technology, DECT 6.0. Well before I set out to do my research what's your opinion on this? Which cordless phones are better? Panasonic phones or V-Tech? Can you answer that?

As far as the newer phones and higher frequencies, the higher frequency the better the transmission. Usually. Brands? I only have experience with Uniden, which I'm pleased with. If you decide to upgrade the router to N, they operate at the higher frequencies in and around the 5.x bandwidth.

While it should be fine there will always be someone that has a system that will be upset with what they added. No one can claim there will be no problem. But in this case there should be no problem. That's the honest answer. Bob

Proffitt - 11/26/09 12:28 PM In reply to: Re: Why vs. normal. by Big Steve The pumpkin pie is in the oven. Did you mean there is no more pie or that your Mrs. burned it in the oven and that there was no pie yesterday? If it was the latter, sorry to hear about that.
