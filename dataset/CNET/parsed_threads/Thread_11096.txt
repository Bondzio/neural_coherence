<s> Hi I've got the zero configuration set to start automatically (win xp home sp2) but when i restart the pc the service hasn't started and i have to start it manually. </s>
<s> How do i overcome this/ Thanks </s>
<s> Do you have some Linksys, Belkin, Dlink, NetGear, card? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The wireless adapter on my laptop is a belkin and I've a talktalk router. </s>
<s> The belkin software is at issue here. </s>
<s> You can see this discussed on the web but most of us just use Belkin's replacement for this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for that. </s>
<s> I found another solution on microsoft forum. </s>
<s> Open Notepad and type the following text (in lower case) net start wzcsvc Save this as wbt.bat (onto the desktop). </s>
<s> Then copy this bat file to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup Then restart the computer. </s>
<s> I've found another fix - I went into device manager and uninstalled my card, I then restarted my laptop and sure enough all is well - zero configuration starts every time. </s>
<s> A friend suggested this he thought that during the original installation something had gone wrong and zero configuration hadn't been configured correctly. </s>
<s> By uninstalling in device manager you just remove the cards driver it seeems. </s>
<s> You learn something new every day! </s>
