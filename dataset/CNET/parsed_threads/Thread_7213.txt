<s> Hello, Can I install an OS ( xp Pro) on an external HD and use it as a &quot;slave&quot; HD ? </s>
<s> I have a 64 bit Vista in my PC, but need a 32 bit for a few work programs that are not compatible for 64bit. </s>
<s> I am not REALLY interested in creating a dual boot sys. </s>
<s> Thanks, Jeff </s>
<s> If so, Microsoft does not provide a way. </s>
<s> I see you crossposted. </s>
<s> Try VIRTUAL BOX. </s>
<s> It could be either, I would be &quot;attaching&quot; to a Vista64 bit OS. </s>
<s> I need an 32bit OS for some needed work programs and would like to keep my 64bit OS with out going to a dual boot setup. </s>
<s> Does that help ? </s>
<s> Thanks, Jeff </s>
