1.1.1	Hey folks , This is one for anyone familiar with the Acer eNet Management software .	St
1.1.2	It consistently connects to wireless networks besides my own .	St
1.1.3	The & quot ; Auto & quot ; profile is unchangeable , so I created another profile , and put my network in the & quot ; WLAN perferred list & quot ; , but everytime the computer restarts , it selects the & quot ; Auto & quot ; profile instead of my own , and connects somewhere else .	St
1.1.4	Searching on other help forums , the solution I 've found has pretty much been to ditch Acer eNet Management and use another managment software , like the one build into Windows .	St
1.1.5	I do n't mind doing this , but I simply ca n't fathom that the people who developed this software did n't include an option to change the default profile .	St
1.1.6	If so , I think I 've just lost all faith in my fellow software developers .	St
1.1.7	But alas , after hours of googling and reading manuals , this seems to be just the case .	St
1.1.8	The only info I can find is that it & quot ; automatically uses the best settings ( changes profile I assume ) based on location & quot ; .	St
1.1.9	This would seem to indicate there somewhere there exists a setting mapping certain locations to profiles .	St
1.1.10	How the heck its supposed to know what location you are in ( home , office , etc ) without you telling it ( scan Wifi networks maybe ? )	Ques
1.1.11	is odd , but even so , since this particular computer never moves , there has to be a way to have it always use a certain profile , even it means I have to map this profile to a & quot ; location & quot ; .	St
1.1.12	These obviously are not the & quot ; best & quot ; settings for me since it connects to my neighbours unsecured wireless , instead of my secured wireless .	St
1.1.13	And it does n't just sometimes not select my connection , it ALWAYS does n't select my connection , even though it 's 5 bars vs 3 on the other connection .	St
1.1.14	I also went into & quot ; Settings & quot ; in eNet Management and deselected the & quot ; Switch Networks Automatically & quot ; and & quot ; Allow Acer eNet Management to connect automatically to an open wireless network & quot ; ( which are profile independent so they stay deselected ) but IT STILL DOES .	St
1.1.15	I think I just needed to get that off my chest , but if anyone has other solutions besides disabling eNet Management , is it possible to control what profile it selects on boot ?	Ques
1.1.16	Thanks very much !	St
1.2.1	You could use WZC but the issue you noted does n't happen on our pair of acers .	St
1.2.2	Something seems amiss but if you must , just try out the Windows native WZC .	St
1.3.1	Agreed .	St
1.3.2	I 've since disabled eNet an am using the built-in utility , and put my network at the top , which it has consistenly connected to after a couple of test reboots .	St
1.3.3	I 'm wondering if eNet grabbed from this list to decide connection order , but my network was always above the other , and eNet still connected to the other network .	St
1.3.4	Odd , odd indeed .	St
1.4.1	I agree it 's odd .	Res
1.4.2	Ca n't explain it but go with what works ...	St
1.5.1	I 'm having the same problem and honestley I just want to disable acer enet management .	St
1.5.2	I just do n't seem to be able do disable it .	St
1.5.3	Please can anyone help me ... Thank-you	Ques
1.6.1	I have an Acer laptop and I have disabled enet managmenet by right-clicking on the enet management icon that resides on the Empowering Technology toolbar and selecting & quot ; disable & quot ; .	St
1.7.1	Yes My 2 kids acer laptops have had connection problems for months , ever since we bought them .	St
1.7.2	I just thought it was Vista as my xp Acer has never had any problems .	St
1.7.3	After seeing a thread on this topic , I uninstalled this utility on both laptops and they now they work quite well .	St
1.7.4	I have to put this in the box of truly dumb software , maybe instead of wasting time and effort on this garbage they could get their touch pad software to work properly instead of it trying to emulate a random number generator !	St
