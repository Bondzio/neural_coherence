<s> Does anyone have any opinions on gateways? </s>
<s> I have looked all different computers. </s>
<s> I can have one built locally and purchase mass produced. </s>
<s> Any comments? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Personally I dont care for gateways that much. </s>
<s> My friend had a couple and I wasnt impressed with the machine given the price. </s>
<s> I recently purchased an HP and have had problems with it as well. </s>
<s> My so called warranty isnt worth anything since my DVD+- died on me and the experts at their India &quot;service center&quot; run me around in circles for hours until I finally have given up. </s>
<s> Heard the same thing about other major brands. </s>
<s> Basically for the money I would go with a Dell/IBM (if they still have em) low cost server and purchase the extras seperately or get a year old workstation with dual processor capability and jack it up. </s>
<s> Since most of the service/call centers have moved overseas I wouldnt put much hope in getting something fixed if it breaks &quot;under warranty&quot;. </s>
<s> Definitely would not purchase an HP but I am sure others have had better experiences. </s>

<s> The big computer makers put out an ok product. </s>
<s> Custom built machines can be tricky to compare because of what is put into the machine. </s>
<s> If you do not do a lot of gaming a cheap video card will do you as well as a highend one. </s>
<s> Computers are machines that run software. </s>
<s> Decide what you need and want to do on the computer then decide where to put your dollars. </s>
<s> (Your software will cost more than your computer.) </s>
<s> The one thing I do not like about almost all big computer builders, Gateway, Dell, HP/Compact etc, etc, etc. </s>
<s> Is that they come loaded with Salesware. </s>
<s> It seems like almost every program is trying to get you to upgrade and buy the &quot;full version&quot;. </s>
<s> This can create a situation where your machine is locking up due to all the programs trying to connect to their homepages. </s>
<s> Have someone help you clean up the machine before you end up with problems. </s>
<s> Happy Computing A custom rig will not have all this junk to start with. </s>
<s> BUY AntiVirus and learn how to use it. </s>
<s> Learn about spyware - AdAware by Lavasoft is good stuff. </s>
<s> I have only seen a few gateways and they were all older pentium 3's. </s>
<s> I have been very happy with my HP pc since 01, and just bought a new one, i think theyre the best, customer support was great, the one time i used it too. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> By the way, the old one still works fine too. </s>
<s> I forgot to mention, that new HP pc only cost 500 bucks with tax at walmart, it has a celeron D processor at 2.93 gigs and ddr ram so its fast. </s>
<s> the thing to do, since it has windows xp installed is: disable the windows firewall and the norton anti virus and get Zone Alarm firewall and the AVG anti virus, theyre bothe free and have served me well since 2001. </s>
<s> The windows xp has sp2 thats why i would do those things, theres been no problem since x-mas, hope i helped ya,later. </s>
<s> I have a brand new Gateway, a one year old HP at work and a Two year old HP here at home along with Dell laptops. </s>
<s> I had huge amounts of problems with all the crap software put on systems by HP. </s>
<s> I had to do a reinstall of the operating system to make it run right. </s>
<s> The Gateway came out of the box pretty clean. </s>
<s> Only had to deleat a couple of programs. </s>
<s> Don't get me wrong all the computers have served me well. </s>
<s> I don't think the brand makes any difference any longer. </s>
<s> All the parts on the inside are the same and the company is only putting them all together. </s>
<s> Pick the one that best works for you and always try to buy more than you need so you can get many years of enjoyment out of your investment. </s>
