1.1.1	Howdy all, I am an AV Tech, responsible for maintaining equipment at for an installation with about 300 staff.	St
1.1.2	Last week, one of our staff returned a ViewSonic PJ 658 projector, and they had broken the adjuster foor off.	St
1.1.3	The viewSonic Tech guys gave me the part number, but this is an out-of stock item.	St
1.1.4	It is the screw-height adjuster leg.	St
1.1.5	I am usually pretty good at finding these things, but have found nothing so far.	St
1.1.6	Does anyone know of a repository of oddball viewsonic parts?	St
1.1.7	Anybody buy these things when they are broken and part them out?	St
1.1.8	I kind of stinks that we can't use this just now because it is functioning properly...you just can't get a level image to project.	St
1.1.9	All Help appreciated.	St
1.2.1	It's strange you mentioned this.	Polite
1.2.2	A projector at the office lost a foot so one of the office staff whittled one from some wood.	St
1.2.3	If you want to not make a part, try Ebay, craigslist and place that part on order at Viewsonic.	St
