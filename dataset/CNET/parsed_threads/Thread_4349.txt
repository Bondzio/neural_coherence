<s> I have a 400Gb SATA drive which was purchased about 18 months ago. </s>
<s> I've been trying to use it as an external USB drive on Windows XP Pro (SP2), using two different makes of SATA USB 2.0 enclosure. </s>
<s> The drive connects OK, and shows up as an external drive, but as soon as I attempt to copy any data onto it I get problems: either Explorer hangs, or I get &quot;delayed write failure&quot;. </s>
<s> This happens within 2 minutes of initiating the file copy. </s>
<s> I've tried copying different folders and files, and I've tried it on 3 different machines (3 different motherboard makes, but all running XP SP2). </s>
<s> In each case I connected the drive to one of the rear USB ports (i.e. </s>
<s> not to an external hub). </s>
<s> I tried this with two different brands of USB 2.0 SATA enclosure, and got exactly the same result. </s>
<s> In both cases the enclosures were independently powered by DC power adapters. </s>
<s> I then installed the drive internally into one of the machines, to check that it wasn't faulty. </s>
<s> It installed fine, and I was able to copy huge numbers of files to it without any problems, so it looks as if the drive is OK. </s>
<s> I also left it running there all day without any problems. </s>
<s> I just purchased a Lacie 500Gb external USB 2.0 drive and this works perfectly well with all of the 3 PC's that failed my tests with the other drive enclosures. </s>
<s> Is there any reason why specific SATA drives may be unsuitable for use in external USB enclosures? </s>
<s> 400GB may be beyond some case capabilities. </s>
<s> I've also run into people who didn't start fresh by removing the partitions and making them anew. </s>
<s> Also some front USB ports have issues. </s>
<s> Use the rear ports. </s>

<s> Some SATA hard drives have different jumper settings for 3Gbps and 1.5Gbps operation. </s>
<s> The enclosure circuitry may require one of these to work properly with the HD. </s>
<s> Maybe someone else has experienced the same problem with your HD model or enslosure models. </s>
<s> Which ones are they? </s>
<s> It's a Hitachi Deskstar, dated December 2004, and doesn't have any jumpers at all. </s>
<s> The enclosures are unbranded (both from eBay), so probably not a great spec. </s>
<s> They have worked with other drives though. </s>
<s> the drive went &quot;kaput&quot;, i.e...the heads or pc card are bad. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> The drive is fine - I tried installing it internally and it worked flawlessly. </s>
<s> I should have re-read your first post where you stated the drive worked internally. </s>
<s> Has this drive ever worked externally? </s>
<s> If not, then it has to be the drivers for the external case. </s>
<s> Have you tried it without closing up the case? </s>
<s> i..e.. just laying the drive flat while connected to the case? </s>
<s> Could be this drive is defective in that it won't work with the USB interface for some reason. </s>
<s> Frankly, I've never come across this problem. </s>
<s> You may still have to migrate your files to a different drive and go that route. </s>
<s> Good luck and let us know what you end up doing. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Yes - I have previously used this drive successfully in the same enclosure. </s>
<s> I have also tried the drive connected to the enclosure without closing the case. </s>
<s> The curious thing is that I now have 2 different enclosures which were previously working fine, but which are showing the same symptoms (tried with 2 different SATA drives and 3 different PC's). </s>
<s> Could be just a helluva coincidence I suppose. </s>
<s> This is not a stupid question: Have you tried different cables? </s>
<s> I ask only because it hasn't been mentioned yet. </s>
<s> Just trying to cover all the bases. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Yes I've tried 2 different cables. </s>
<s> Are there different grades of USB cable? </s>
<s> Could it be that I used two low-grade cables which are not appropriate for this sort of application? </s>
