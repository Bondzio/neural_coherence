Now I ran out of black awhile ago and bought some at a discount online and things have been fine.Until I ran out of magenta, now nothing is printing, so I replaced all with Epson C80 ink from Office Depot, still no printing, I cleaned the heads 5 times, did all mantenience and nothing. So I thought it was the C80 ink. So I bought C82 ink at a discount online and tried printing just a cover letter and all I got is just some streaks, then I tried a photo setting and I got a very faint and streaked print.Sooo, I called Epson Customer Service and they want to charge me $9 for their help, forget that, can anyone help, or do I have to pay the $9 for a phone call? I want to throw this thing out the window, Help! Thanks Mike

Perils of lower costs. I will not write much about why removing free support lowers the initial cost of the printer, but I have learned to just pay the piper on ink cartridges. The Epson has some superfine nozzles and I can't say if non-Epson ink will clog. But will note that your warranty is void now and I'd open the window before tossing it. Bob

Yes, that will use alot of ink. However, if you really don't want to spend money on ink then buy a replacement as a &quot;on sale&quot; printer may be as close as the ink carts cost. Now, next time use Epson ink(costs alot, consider your past experience) and if it ever goes dry, install a new ink cart quickly. Epson printers work great when they do and just are a PITA when they don't, IMHO and I don't recommend them. sorry ... -----Willy

If so, does it show anything now that you have replaced the cartridges again. Be aware, that pulling out a cartridge and putting it back in is a NO NO with an Epson, it can leave a bubble in the nozzle that will not clear up easily. You really need to clean until you get a complete nozzle check pattern. At this point, about all you can do is try repeatedly, printing a nozzle check each time. It should improve with each cleaning. You can buy cartridges that have cleaning fluid in them, that may fix it.
