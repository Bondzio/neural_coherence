<s> Looking for suggestions for a gateway-gateway connection for a 4 site WAN. </s>
<s> Please don't respond with, &quot;use cisco&quot;. </s>
<s> Please respond with a model and resoning or personal expierance. </s>
<s> Price is not much of an issue. </s>
<s> Looking probably around $1k each. </s>
<s> (Of course lets not spend for something I dont need) Only needs to support around 200 machines. </s>
<s> Whats wrong with cisco At 1k each they have a number of smaller router that will do the job but you might as well go with the old linksys brand ones they now call small business in the RV line of product. </s>
<s> Things like a RV042 or 82 will most likely work and these are very cheap. </s>
<s> If you want something with more feature we use juniper (netscreen) SSG5. </s>
<s> We get a huge discount but they are well under $1000 and are full firewalls with vpn and many other features. </s>
<s> In theory you should be able to pass more encrypted traffic though them than the linksys but I have not ever tested it to see if its true. </s>
<s> We have a few hundred of these installed for various purposes </s>
