<s> I have a Linksys wireless router set up (WRT54G) and my PC desktop and laptop connect fine to the internet with wire and wireless. </s>
<s> I installed an airport card in our Power Mac G4 but this cannot detect my wireless network. </s>
<s> I have it connected now with an ethernet cable running through the kitchen but want to get rid of the cable. </s>
<s> Is there a compatibility issue with airport and a Linksys wireless network? </s>
<s> The Mac recognizes the airport card so I hope that means that it is good. </s>
<s> (I got it from eBay used) This Mac is the farthest away from the router so I guess my next try is to see if I can move the router a little bit closer. </s>
<s> I am a newbie to wireless so possibly I have a setting wrong. </s>
<s> I did tell the router the mac addresses of all of the computers that I want to connect. </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> Thanks, Karen </s>
<s> In fact, did you start with a simple router setup first (ie. </s>
<s> no security) or is it tweaked to the max? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't remember now if I tried that computer with security off. </s>
<s> I will try when I finish work later. </s>
<s> I have security set at WPA Pre-shared Key and WPA Algoriths at AES. </s>
<s> When that card was made, was such a standard on all products. </s>
<s> Try simpler or best... NONE to see if it works. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Set the router to allow mixed mode. </s>
<s> I don't see if your card is 802.11b or not. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I tried with security disabled and no luck. </s>
<s> Also the router is set for mixed mode and has been since I set it up. </s>
<s> Also I read that cordless phones can interfere so I disconnected the cordless phone for a bit and still no luck. </s>
<s> I tried changing the channel in the router and no luck. </s>
<s> And see if it works. </s>

<s> Although the computer could see the card and all looked correct, the antenna for the card was not plugged in! </s>
<s> I don't want to presume the obvious here, but if that card is working and everything is connected, it should at least &quot;see&quot; the wireless signal even the computer cannot join it. </s>
<s> Satisfy my curiosity, check the antenna on that card, please P </s>
<s> I can't bring the computer to a hot spot since it is a tower machine and not a laptop.I don't know where any hot spots are, anyway. </s>
<s> I am not that advanced in networking yet. </s>
<s> And mrmacfixit you were right about the antenna. </s>
<s> The plug got knocked out when I shut the machine up after installing the card! </s>
<s> BUT, after replugging the antenna it still is not recognizing any networks. </s>
<s> Here is what I did yesterday. </s>
<s> I brought my laptop to where the Mac is and it said the signal was very weak. </s>
<s> It would not connect. </s>
<s> So besides a possible airport card issue, I do have interference due to distance. </s>
<s> Airport card - the instructions I got from Apple tech web site said to install the card serial number side up. </s>
<s> I did that and it seems like the antenna should plug into the hole on the left side when the card is installed. </s>
<s> There is also a hole on the right side but it is smaller and the antenna plug would not fit. </s>
<s> So, did I pick the right spot to put the antenna? </s>
<s> Next thing I will do is reseat the airport card tomorrow or Saturday and test again. </s>
<s> Then, Monday I will move my DSL modem and the router to the phone jack closer to where the Mac is and see if it picks up a signal then. </s>
<s> I can't do this until Monday since I am on call for work and can't disrupt my working network in case I am called for an issue. </s>
<s> Thank you for all of your suggestions. </s>
<s> I am determined to get this network working! </s>
<s> Karen in CT </s>
<s> If you look closely at the end of the Airport card, not the end with all the holes in, you will see that each of those holes has a marking next to it. </s>
<s> II for one of them and I for the other. </s>
<s> The hole for the antenna is the one with the I next to it. </s>
<s> Thats the one on the left, as the Apple guy said, when the card is serial number side up. </s>
<s> The antenna is a really good fit in that hole. </s>
<s> I spent a long time trying to figure out a nice way to ask about the antenna. </s>
<s> No offense intended Good luck. </s>

<s> Power Mac G4 with airport card to Linksys wireless router? </s>
<s> kareng1947 - 10/11/06 11:41 AM Karen if you still need help in this matter please let me know. </s>
<s> I have the same router as you and Windows and Mac both work on the linksys. </s>
<s> Thanks, -J. Thacker Message was edited by: admin to remove personal email address </s>
<s> I am having trouble too, I can get the card to see my net work (wep) but it keeps say wrong password. </s>
<s> I have 4 xp windows machines, that work with the same password. </s>
<s> Then I read macs need a $ before the wep code, still wrong password. </s>
<s> So I called linksys they cant help with a mac but said apple could. </s>
<s> Well its late and I am tired. </s>
<s> So they said I would have to do it by way of static, I am a newbie to macs and dont know how to do it. </s>
<s> Take a look at this document. </s>
<s> http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106250 The salient points are: Many third-party wireless access points use a WEP key or a password entered either as a string of hexadecimal numbers or as five ASCII characters. </s>
<s> To connect Mac OS X to a third-party wireless access point that is configured to use WEP, format your password one of these two ways: 1. </s>
<s> Hexadecimal - precede the string with a dollar sign ($). </s>
<s> For example: $123456789a 2. </s>
<s> ASCII - enclose the characters in double quotes (&quot;). </s>
<s> For example: &quot;magic&quot; See what happens. </s>
<s> Whichever way you do it, you MUST know the correct password for the Linksys device P </s>
<s> Hey im having the same problems as her my mac say that the Internal Modem is configured but not connected i dont know what that means and what to do about it? </s>
<s> ive tried so many things to get it to work but they havent work if u cn help at all that would be great thanks -christina </s>
<s> is only used if you are using a dial up internet service. </s>
<s> Karen was not doing that. </s>
<s> Might be better if you started a new thread with all the details so that we can try to help you. </s>
<s> Again, the internal modem is for a telephone line only P </s>
