I'm about buying a new monitor and i've to choose between 22 and 24 inches.
What would be better for gaming/movies, and why?
Can i enjoy full hd on 22&quot; as good as on 24&quot;?
Also, I'd like to hear your opinion about this one: http://www.iiyama.com/gl_en/products/prolite-e2409hds-1/ Note: I'm from Poland, so don't need opinions on the price (it's very small ;)), but on the technical site.
I'll be grateful for your help!
