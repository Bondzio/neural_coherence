Maybe the Yahoo! anti-spyware program did not eliminate all spyware. Try using some other anti-spyware program like Ad-Aware (you can download the free version (Ad-Aware SE Personal) from http://www.lavasoft.com ). The problem could also be something else. Rahul

Zonealarm when installed has a learning mode. It tells about every program in your computer that accesses the net. When a new program tries to access the net, you get a popup window with the name of the program, a link for more info and the action you want to take (Allow or block access). Also Spybot has advanced tools that show whats run at startup and allows you to turn things off. It also includes the path of where the program starts from. Anything started from a temp directory is suspect. Happy hunting.

I just like the interface better. As for anti-spyware, Ad-Aware SE and Spybot S&D are both excellent programs. If you really want to get &quot;down and dirty&quot; into the system and see what's going on, try HijackThis. It's not for the faint of heart, though. It's a pretty powerful program. If you don't know what you're doing with it, don't guess... ASK! There are lots of people out here that are willing to help.
