you didn't mention diddy about who makes the product.
so, in this case contact them(manufacturer) for any reference for a replacement cable.
contact the orginal vendor and go from there for the &quot;exact&quot; cable replacement.
if none of this helps or resolves the issue then you're stuck with my first reply, that's the way it goes, especially on special or non-big selling products.
overall, going with what little you did mention, splicing and dicing is a quick resolution if the cable itself isn't so unique.
