I went with an AMD processor.
Unfortunately I do have a budget but think that I got a very capable system for the money I spent.
I got the AMD Phenon X 4 970 3.5 ghz Quad Core, which will overclock to 4.0 ghz.
I added an ATI 6870 video card.
I probabably spent a bit more than you had in mind, 1k-1.5k price range, but think I did pretty well.
My biggest splurge was for water cooling, but I think it will pay off in increased speed and reliability.
I did not mention it in my original response, but Centaurus overclocks the processor, ram and video card and warrants those parts in their overclocked condition.
Really would suggest that you speak with the people there to help design your system, they were very helpful.
