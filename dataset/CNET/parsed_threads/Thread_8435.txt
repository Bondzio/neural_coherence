<s> So i'm looking to purchase my first tablet and acknowledge up front that technology has never been my thing. </s>
<s> However, I think I've narrowed down my decision to the Google Nexus 7 comming out this month. </s>
<s> My questions are these: 1. </s>
<s> Does the tablet I purchase necessarily limit from where I can purchase eBooks and other media? </s>
<s> My concern is that if I buy a particular tablet that I may be limited it's proprietary online store limiting either my selection or charging unfair rates for eBooks that might be offered elsewhere cheaper. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If I am limited, how does Google (for Nexus 7) compare with Amazon (for Kindle Fire). </s>
<s> Please explain if I'm not understanding issue properly. </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Let's take on your question by asking more questions. </s>
<s> If you get some Android and install the Kindle app, wouldn't that let you get access to that? </s>
<s> And with that Android I can install the Barnes Noble app and get stuff there as well. </s>
<s> The Kindle Fire is a GOOD DEVICE but I don't see it being as open as other pads but then again, you can read PDFs and more on it. </s>
<s> Just don't expect to find the other competitor reader software on it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I got the Sony eReader. </s>
<s> The best part was the ereader app for my pc. </s>
<s> Also the ePub format gives you more flexibility and a better price point than the kindle does. </s>
<s> Why Amazon wants you to pay more than half price for an eBook beats me. </s>
<s> Common Amazon. </s>
<s> If eBooks cost you less than half to make and they're are looked down to you so you cannot lend them or borrow some-one elses book like you can with a hard copy, then you should pay alot less! </s>
<s> IMHO ebook readers are in general too small. </s>
<s> So the one thing Apple got right was the size of the iPad. </s>
<s> I will get the asus transformer android tablet soon as the ereaders are too small and too slow and you cannot read technical pdf files very well. </s>
<s> There are also lots of cheap android tablets that would most likely give you a better experience than an eReader device and way more flexibility. </s>
<s> That being said, if you only read novels and one at a time, then a cheap eReader might suffice, else the colour tablets are way more flexible. </s>
<s> Then it just comes down to reading at night in bed - go android or reading in daylight go eReader, and the battery life. </s>
<s> I have had three ereaders from the original Kindle to the Kindle Fire and Nook Color. </s>
<s> Recently, I put a microSD chip in my Nook that turned the Nook into an Android reader. </s>
<s> As an Android I have access to the entire Android Market (you don't have that with either the Nook or Kindle) where I downloaded the Kindle and Barnes and Noble apps. </s>
<s> When I want to download a book I go to both Amazon and B&N and download the one with the cheapest price (usually they are the same). </s>
<s> The Nexus 7 will be an Android reader so you will have the same capability. </s>
<s> The 7&quot; tablet is a good size for a reader. </s>
<s> It is easy to carry and hold while reading. </s>
<s> As to the response that the cost of ebooks should be much less that paper books is not true. </s>
<s> I worked for a publisher for 14 years and the cheapest part of the cost is the printing and binding. </s>
<s> The majority of the cost goes into the editing and author royalties. </s>
<s> Yes, ebooks should be cheaper than the paper version, but the reduction should be closer to 15% not 50%. </s>
<s> If your considering getting the Nexus then I'd have to say go with it. </s>
<s> From the reviews and my own personal interaction with it at previews I'd have to say that it is rather good for its price (around $299). </s>
<s> It is pretty cool, and with Google Play it is a god send. </s>
<s> You have no idea how better I feel when holding this and reading a book than holding an overpriced iPad instead and always worrying about losing it. </s>
