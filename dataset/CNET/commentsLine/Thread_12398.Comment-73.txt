i think it wakes itself up to stay warm.
when i bought it they told me to leave it in power save mode like you are doing too and sometimes i hear it from the other room just running and then it will go back to &quot;sleep.&quot; i think that saves it from going from completely cold to hot which is why it uses so much of the ink when it goes from power off to on.
do you have your metallics on a certain setting?
all the prints come out fine and look great, but it is almost like the ink isn't really completely stuck to the paper.
(like i said this is only on the metallics.)
try this and tell me if yours does this: print something on the metallic stock and cut through the ink with an x-acto knife - like you were cutting out an invite with a full bleed.
does the ink kind of ball up on the knife where you cut and you have to wipe it off?
maybe it is just my machine!
it is not super noticeable, but not perfection either.
