the dell psus are darn good, though many think they're not.
the point is they do deliver the juice until it fails like any other psu.
i suggest you calculate your actual power demands and add on top of that at least 50% or simply double it.
because you have a dell, you do need to be sure it is compatible to physically as well deliver the added wattage in its space.
you can check at:  and follow their lead on suggestions.
if price affects you then find what they offer in wattage and then look for another *namebrand* psu of similar rating.
