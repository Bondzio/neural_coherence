OK the format that the iMac made on the LaCie worked with Vista, but when I right clicked on the LaCie Vista had a option to reformat the LaCie to the NTFS file system.
I looked on the Microsoft's web site and they talked about how NTFS works with Vista, but don't work with earlier Microsoft OS?
Since I'm only going to use Vista I think having a NTFS systems is not a bad deal with it's better reliability and stuff.
Again thank you for your help.
