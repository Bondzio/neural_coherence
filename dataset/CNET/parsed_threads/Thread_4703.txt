<s> This is an explanation of a computer: 1) If the circuit is closed the current will continue until the circuit is open. </s>
<s> The reverse is also true. </s>
<s> Running a set of parallel wires will produce a constant brightness in lights, a standard in sound, amd the same effect in machine performance. </s>
<s> Items run in a series lose the quality of performance. </s>
<s> Let it be given that all the parts are the same. </s>
<s> The microprocessor, sound card, monitor, speakers, etc- everything- on the computer must apply to these simple rules of electronics. </s>
<s> The computer is a machine, and it is a machine which performs mathmatical equations. </s>
<s> Every item has a value. </s>
<s> The hard drive store items in a matrix pattern. </s>
<s> The operating system is a set of instructions for the machine. </s>
<s> This concept has been emphasized many times; and it has been ignored even more. </s>
<s> Using the operating system is no different than using a spoken language. </s>
<s> You must first learn the language and practice if you want to improve. </s>
<s> If you want to do more, learn more. </s>

<s> What in the world are you talking about and what is it in reference to? </s>
<s> A computer is only a machine. </s>
<s> Once people realize this and treat it as such then they can learn to use it better. </s>
<s> Macintosh, Windows, Linux-kernel, BSD, UNIX, Solaris, Minix, etc are operating systems. </s>
<s> Any machine can use any of them interchangably. </s>
<s> Ther are bo holes in my dissertation, I'm sorry that you see it as such. </s>
<s> The chip is a microprocessor, the original ones worked on vacuum tubes and switches which were on or off. </s>
<s> It's that simple. </s>
<s> This is not magic and it should not be appraoched as an unsolvable problem. </s>
<s> People should be steered in the direction of being able to help themselves, not being given half-ass advice from faceless individuals that have less skill than a twelve year old hacker. </s>
<s> Instead of continuously asking what this post is about, or, like the one before yours, flaunting the amount of stupidity one has, you can start helping people learn thier machine. </s>
<s> Another explanation: you're selling a product. </s>
<s> &quot;I like Dell.&quot; &quot;I like Compaq.&quot; &quot;Apple is better.&quot; Face it, that's crap. </s>
<s> Showing the person- or, in this case, telling the person- how to use whatever machine would be more beneficial. </s>
<s> What prompted your original post? </s>
<s> Are you trying to answer another question or just ranting? </s>
<s> Holes? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Your wiring description is in error. </s>
<s> Do some reading on electricity, Ohms laws, and Kirchof's laws. </s>
<s> You must be a newbie as I've been here since the '90s, build computers, and have over four thousand posts with correct answers. </s>
<s> Faceless? </s>

<s> Now, I am curious as to which forum post stimulated your initial posting. </s>
<s> While I don't doubt that you had good intentions with the original post in this discusstion, it reads like you are trying to regurgitate a condensed version of the first chapter in a Computers 101 textbook. </s>
<s> (I have read and used many of them in classroom settings.) </s>
<s> BTW, I agree with Coryphaeus on the holes in your statements about electrical circuits. </s>
<s> In a sense, yes. </s>
<s> I am answering your question as such because you did not act like a self righteous ass. </s>
<s> I do believe that it should be emphasized that people need to learn computer fundamentals. </s>
<s> They would avoid the spyware and malware. </s>
<s> people could find ways around faulty systems until a patch was released. </s>
<s> Random posts stimulated this. </s>
<s> I see answers that are advertisements and solutions for programs that only further clog up the Windows registries. </s>
<s> I do not see a forum which reads &quot;Please go here for the manufacturer's site of whatever hardware you are having trouble with. </s>
<s> They should be able to help you.&quot; I have done wiring in houses. </s>
<s> I know the basics of electricity. </s>
<s> I agree with your points regarding the need for many to learn fundamentals and that many offer solutions which trade one problem for another. </s>
<s> My initial reply in this discussion was not an attempt to berate you or ''act as a self righteous ass.'' </s>
<s> I was simply using a common English metaphor to respond to a set of statements that seemed either to be an orphaned reply or a frustrated rant. </s>
<s> I have no problems with either, especially since I have done both in one forum or another. </s>
<s> I thank you for clarifying the nature of your post. </s>
<s> This thread has crossed the line in more ways than one, and as a result has been locked. </s>
