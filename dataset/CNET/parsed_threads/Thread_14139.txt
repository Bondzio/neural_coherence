<s> I have a Linksys Wireless-G 2.4 gHz broadband router and ever since I put it in, some things have been going slower. </s>
<s> I was wondering if there is some kind of firewall, and if I could disable it. </s>

<s> well specifically bittorrent. </s>
<s> I used to get around 50-80 kb/s now I get a max of like 10. </s>
<s> Im pretty sure this started when I got the router. </s>
<s> Could it just be bitorrent? </s>
<s> Run Spywayre, Adware, and Virus Checks. </s>
<s> Do speed test with and w/o the router. </s>

<s> I run ad aware almost everyday so its not that. </s>
<s> I tried connecting the cable directly from the modem to computer instead of going through the router, but I couldn't get a connection </s>
<s> You need to find a forum that deals with P2P issues. </s>
<s> Here, there's not been any help for such. </s>
<s> Just so you know. </s>

<s> I've read tons of stuff on how to speed up torrents and I've imporved my speed somewhat. </s>
<s> But some people suggest to take off any firewalls like on routers and I wasn't sure if my router had a firewall and if i could turn it off, so thats the only real question Im asking. </s>
<s> Yes, any router is a form of firewall. </s>
<s> However there are some that claim that STATEFUL INSPECTION makes for a &quot;true firewall.&quot; You have to define what a firewall is before you can call it a firewall. </s>
<s> To turn off the firewall that what every router has by nature would mean that you would not have a router... Hope this doesn't confuse you. </s>
