The VoIP phones use hardly any bandwidth.
We only have two that are used with any regularity as most of what we do we do via email and sms.
We've had this number of phones connected before we had this problem (this problem is a recent occurrence, we have been running this setup for several years with a problem occurring only in the last few months).
