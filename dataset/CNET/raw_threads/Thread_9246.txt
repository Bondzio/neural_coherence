I don't want to partition too much or too little space (and I'm running out of storage in general) so I decided that it would be nice to run games off an external hard drive. I plan on using an ESATA drive and I plan on running games such as Left 4 Dead, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, Half Life 2, UT3. Essentially, the newest games (except Half Life 2). Would an ESATA drive be fast enough? Would I need to modify the external hard drive in any way? Is it even possible to run games of and external HD? Thanks in advance.

As I said, I've installed older games on an internal partitioned drive D: with no problems. Some other games will not install if you try to change the target to anything other than C:. Who knows what the newer games will or will not do? Here is a popular gaming site, maybe you could join the forum and get some information there http://www.gamespot.com/ Why not go ahead and get the new external drive, move all your other &quot;stuff&quot; to that drive to free up space on the C:?

I&quot;ve had my hard drives divided into primary (C:) partitions (active and inactive) and extended partitions containing logical drives (D:,E:,etc.) since the days of the 386's and MS-DOS 3.3 and up through today. I also own hundreds of commercial PC games. In all that time I have only come across maybe one or two games that required installation on the C: drive, and they were very old DOS games from the era when hard drives were not common in home computers. Now, maybe it has something to do with the kinds of PC games that I play that I haven't seen this C: drive-only install phenomenon, but in this day and age of huge hard drives and multi-boot systems it would be insane for a game manufacturer to REQUIRE a C: drive install. So, just so I, and others, can know what to watch out for: Which games require installation only on the C: drive?

There's some good reasons to have externals ... mainly portability, perhaps offsite storage but loading programs on 'em isn't one of them. VAPCMD

Chances are you might not have the speed of a RAID array, but it'll run decently. I use an external drive myself for all my documents and music, but I keep all my programs and games on my RAID.

If you do nothing more than read thru this FORUM and see how many have report problems with external drives ....you should get and idea of the problem(s)you will face ... the only question is when.

Some games may require a C: drive install (not sure how many or if any recent ones do), but other than that it should work fine!

Dont try this unless you know what your doing!

Windows Vista. Even Steam app and games. No lag, no high latency, no long load times. May be different on a Mac, but I doubt it, especially with ESATA. You should be golden.
