finds it's just another file system and not exclusive to netgear.
-&gt; are you aware why microsoft file systems such as fat32, ntfs are not used in small embedded systems?
that alone can lighten up your path to understand why things are the way they are.
also, where is your backup?
you seem to be falling into the single location or my files are only on this thing trap.
what happens when the fire, flood or thief gets that unit?
as to other nas's.
there are dozens and as you find each one i see that all 4 questions can be answered without effort.
so i'll share i use a simple nas with some linux compatible file system.
i know why it can't use fat32, ntfs or a file system that windows can access so i know not to expect that.
