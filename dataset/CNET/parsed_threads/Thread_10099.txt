<s> We've 3 desktop PCs and two laptops all with XP though one desktop is XP Home. </s>
<s> I built the desktops and configured them. </s>
<s> All share two networked printers and the network performance has been good. </s>
<s> I've got one nagging problem between my desktop and the wifes T40 Thinkpad. </s>
<s> I don't have similar users defined on each. </s>
<s> I do have simple file sharing off and have shares on both systems. </s>
<s> Each does at least one share allowing &quot;Everyone&quot; at least read access. </s>
<s> All PCs are part of the same network. </s>
<s> Here's the issue. </s>
<s> When I attempt to access the laptop from my desktop, I am presented with a login screen and can enter my wife's username/password. </s>
<s> But, If I attempt to access my PC from her laptop, I get the message that I don't have proper permissions. </s>
<s> Actually, this is what I'd expect from both as neither the administrator or user accounts share the same password. </s>
<s> I know I could just duplicate an account to make this go away but something is different between the two. </s>
<s> I'm not understanding why I get the login screen accessing the laptop from my desktop and not visa versa. </s>
<s> Is this a service or local policy issue I'm missing on one these? </s>
<s> BTW, hers is generally connected wirelessly but using the wired connection makes no difference. </s>
<s> Everyone with an account. </s>
<s> Sometimes you find people who thought &quot;Everyone&quot; meany &quot;Anyone.&quot; Does that help? </s>
<s> Blasted typos and English. </s>
<s> I'll monkey with it more. </s>
<s> This has been the case for a long time an isn't disastrous. </s>
<s> The other desktop PCs have similar user accounts/passwords on them so connecting and sharing is a no-brainer. </s>
<s> Interestingly, I can connect to my company provided laptop which is in a domain. </s>
<s> I am presented with a login screen and must provide the necessary domain information. </s>
<s> I don't have a similar account on this laptop as my desktop either. </s>
<s> Still, I can connect to a share I created to move files back and forth. </s>
<s> As for understanding the difference between &quot;everyone&quot; and &quot;anyone&quot;, yes, I certainly am aware of that. </s>
<s> The puzzle to me is why, without similar accounts on these two devices, I can connect from one but not the other. </s>
<s> The other desktops have an account with her username/password and so they connect readily. </s>
<s> Certainly I can create an account on either my desktop or her laptop that matches an existing one and it will work as expected. </s>
<s> That's not supported well. </s>
<s> Sorry but that didn't appear in your first post or I would have warned you off. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> My wife's laptop is not in a domain. </s>
<s> It shares the same workgroup name as the other PCs. </s>
<s> Curiously I am currently setting up another Lenovo laptop to replace her aging one and I am encountering the same issue with this one. </s>
<s> Attempted access from my desktop (wired or wireless) is greeted with a logon window. </s>
<s> Attempted access from the laptop to my desktop gets the (station name) not accessible message. </s>
<s> &quot;You might not have permission...etc.&quot; I will figure this out. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> Just so you can dismiss them. </s>
<s> a. </s>
<s> The firewall. </s>
<s> b. </s>
<s> The firewall in the router. </s>
<s> c. A mismatch or missing account on the machine you are on and the machine you are trying to connect to. </s>
<s> d. The permissions on the share do not include the account you are using. </s>
<s> Item d can confound most. </s>
<s> Tip: Create the share AFTER you create accounts. </s>
<s> Windows may not always add that new user to the share. </s>
