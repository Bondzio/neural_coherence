well said wolfie.
dprudlow, try putting smaller partitions on it.
like 295gb or less.
the case can handle 750gb but, windows xp can only handle less than 300gb partitions.
i have a seagate 320gb and the most xp will let me partition on it is, 298gb plus cache.
anything over that is a new partition.
good luck.
