<s> Does anyone know if there is a way to enable the USB port of a TV to access video files held on a NAS drive? </s>
<s> My aim is to access the drive via wifi or ethernet. </s>
<s> Presumably it would need to present the drive as a mass storage device to the TV's USB port since that's basically what the port picks up. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be most welcome. </s>
<s> The TV does not support DLNA and I'm trying to avoid having to buy a separate media player e.g. </s>
<s> WD Live TV box. </s>

<s> This sounds like the fellow I met yesterday that wanted to make cellular phone calls without a cell phone. </s>
<s> Rather than upset him I just nodded a lot. </s>
<s> For you my nod is to the Logitech Revue. </s>

<s> I hear what you're saying but the budget won't stretch that far! </s>
<s> Is there any kit which might achieve what I'm looking for? </s>
<s> I imagine others will have considered this as it would seem to be an obvious solution to centrally accessing media files for viewing on the telly. </s>
<s> A lot of modern TVs have pretty good built in media players. </s>
<s> But is it possible? </s>
<s> Because such needs some little computer in a box (like the Revue and such) and that I limit explanations to 3 or less paragraphs let's go with this. </s>
<s> -&gt; What have you found that does what you want for your price? </s>
<s> If nothing then what happens if you try the 99 buck price? </s>
<s> And wait, wait, don't tell me about the Roku Stick at http://www.tomsguide.com/us/roku-hdmi-smart-tv-usb-netflix,news-13751.html Bob </s>
<s> I was just hoping there might be a cheap and simple piece of kit which might achieve what I'm after. </s>
<s> I've done some research and haven't found anything - hence my question. </s>
<s> I realise that if it ends up costing the same as a media streaming box then it would be pointless! </s>
<s> Has anyone found a set-up which does this simply and cheaply? </s>
<s> I've seen the older Roku refurbs on woot.com for 49 bucks. </s>
<s> But I had that and gave it to my brother and now have the Logitech Revue which is now 99 bucks. </s>
<s> There is a ZERO cost solution you may have already. </s>
<s> Hook up your PC to the TV and you are done. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I suspect that might be the only realistic option! </s>
<s> There are 2 devices which do exactly what I'm looking for: http://hsti.com/wirelessmediastick/overview http://www.infinitec.com/ The first is reported to be the better device, and they're not that cheap so it's questionable whether these would be worth the money over a network/DNLA type media player. </s>
<s> And less capable. </s>
<s> Good luck and tell us how it turns out. </s>
<s> http://hsti.com/moboplay Today it looks like you can get both units for 89.95. </s>
