Hi, I am planning on getting a new video card, since my old Nvidia Geforce FX 5200 is fried after I overclocked it, and I'm wondering if anyone can tell me if a Nvidia Geforce FX 5700VE is a killer card for gaming.
I mean, if it is, would it be better than a 5700LE or a 5700 Ultra.
By the way, the card is PNY brand.
