So I bought a fan and was going to install it. I took out my card (with a little difficulty...just tinkered with it a bit but ended up getting it out seemingly fine). I took off the fan, and decided instead to do it later. So I put the old fan back on the card, put the card back into my pc and now I can't see anything on my monitor. I think I put everything in properly, and made sure there wasn't excess dust or anything. What could possibly be wrong?

As well, I wonder if your PC has on board graphics that have taken over the show. If you have another video card connection, try that one. Does the card have an external power source that might not be plugged in or seated properly? Can you try another monitor as well? Other than those thoughts, I've no idea unless the card was damaged. But a missing video card uses causes beeps during post.
