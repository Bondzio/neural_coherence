I really want one, but so far I've been disappointed with something about every tablet I've looked at. And when it comes to Android tablets, with all their proprietary or semi-proprietary software implementations, frankly I'm so confused I could stumble across the perfect tablet and not realize it. No matter what every other tablet maker has done so far, iPad is still the 800-lb. gorilla of tablets. Why? By now, you'd think it would have at least one strong competitor. So what is Apple doing so right that no one else is doing (yet)? What change would you tell the other tablet makers to make that would narrow the gap with Apple when it comes to popularity and sales? What should Google do with the next version of Android? Isn't the sheer number of Android versions being used a problem in itself? And for iPad owners: What have you seen in other tablets that you would like to see incorporated into a future iPad? I know what I think Apple left out of their iPads so far, and I have some idea of what I'd like to see in Android tablets. But this isn't intended as a rant, so I'll keep mum and let you state your ideas. What would you do to make a tablet that beats the iPad 2 in the marketplace?

Proffitt	7/18/11 2:46 PM	1.31100036E12	Since I have both, I am a little confused about your comment	As to the Apple, it's far from right as folk continue to buy one and discover it's not a laptop replacement. Something is being lost in translation to the consumers. As to the Android, the only confusion is that it's much like the PC industry. The consumers have a very hard time wrapping their head about the concepts about that. And your question about what I want to see an the iPad. It's a very short list. 1. microSD slot. 2. Support for Bluetooth SPP. As you your assertion about a sales gap, that usually means you can't aggregate the total sales of Android. -&gt; Both IOS and Android are on track to have 1 BILLION users in 10 years. Isn't second place grand? Bob
