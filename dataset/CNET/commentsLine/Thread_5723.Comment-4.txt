midi signals were &quot;stuck&quot; or &quot;added&quot; to game ports because it would be costly to put the then standard midi port onto the sound cards of the day.
as such there is never a need to think of this as a game port as a true game port would never have midi signals on it.
creative labs used what we called a &quot;15-pin midi/joystick multiport,&quot; those adapters simply had the connections and connectors required to connect the midi signals.
now back to your keyboard with midi out.
interesting unit so you can't send it midi commands.
most folk want the keyboard to play midi and now just send it.
maybe this is something to consider?
