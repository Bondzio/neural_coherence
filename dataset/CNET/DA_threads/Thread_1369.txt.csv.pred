1.1.1	Hey Guys , My 250 GB Hard drive looks like it 's nearly running out of space and I figured I would go out and buy a new one .	St
1.1.2	The thing is I 'm split between internal and external .	St
1.1.3	I have a relatively fast desktop computer with 3 SATA 2 connectors , so internal sounds like a clean , invisible fit .	St
1.1.4	However , They are n't portable .	St
1.1.5	What I wanted to know was which one had better seek time ?	Ques
1.1.6	Durability ?	Ques
1.1.7	And similar pros and cons of each .	St
1.1.8	Another thing that I wanted to know about was RAID .	St
1.1.9	Will RAID enable both of my hard drives to work as one ?	Ques
1.1.10	And are there different types of RAID or does every motherboard have the same compatibility ?	Ques
1.1.11	My last question was that some of the external hard drives that I 've seen had RJ-45 connectors on them .	St
1.1.12	This would be really handy because I 'm planning on buying a laptop soon and this would be handy !	St
1.1.13	But do you guys recommend this over networking my router ?	Ques
1.1.14	Any other info or personal details will really be appreciated too !	St
1.1.15	Thanks In Advance !	St
1.2.1	Why ?	Ques
1.2.2	Because I bought an external USB 2.0 case and used my selection of drives .	St
1.2.3	Parting hint : They do n't use different model drives in those ready to use externals than what you find internally .	St
1.2.4	The downside to external is the transfer speed is slower .	St
1.2.5	Yes someone will note ESATA , but many fail to get it to work .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	250GB HDD FAILS ?	Ques
1.3.2	VAPCMD	St
