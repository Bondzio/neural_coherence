1.1.1	I've searched Cnet and read a few threads but im still not sure.	St
1.1.2	I've read that vista 32bit only recognize 2gb?	Polite
1.1.3	and the 64bit one can recognize more.	St
1.1.4	I'm using Window Xp Pro,And recently I've added 2x 1gb ddr2 ram to my pc.	St
1.1.5	When i right click my computer,properties, it says there is 2.98 gb(2x 1gb,2x 512mb) installed.	St
1.1.6	But what i don't understand is that, why some of my other programs only detect my total ram as 2gb ?	Ques
1.1.7	I've installed some ram cleaner program(such as Ram Booster,and some other to cross check) and they says my computer ram is 2gb only.	St
1.1.8	I've ran cpuz and it detects all 3gb,all of them have the same specification except one.	St
1.1.9	Here's links to 4 printscreen of cpuz of my rams.	St
1.1.10	http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/foeqiwtctf.thumb500.jpg http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/hvuqexbnqc.thumb500.jpg http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/pfhsxfgngl.thumb500.jpg http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/nszhqaovdb.thumb500.jpg Does the mis-recognize affect the actual total amount of ram that my pc runs on?	St
1.1.11	Is there any methods i could use to make my pc recognize the other 1gb of ram?	Ques
1.1.12	Thnks In Advance.	St
1.2.1	http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366778.aspx writes &quot;User-mode virtual address space for each 32-bit process 2 GB Up to 3 GB with IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE and 4GT&quot; You can edit boot.ini and add the /3GB switch but the application must be compiled with a special switch to use more than 2GB.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	there's nothing wrong with your pc.	St
1.3.2	windows detects (and is using) 2.93gb.	St
1.3.3	most windows programs are limited to being able to access only 2gb.	St
1.3.4	so trust what windows says and not what your other programs say.	St
1.4.1	Oh..i see... 1 more thing.	St
1.4.2	i read somewhere just now that the &quot;msconfig&quot; u could set the max memory or somethign like that.but when i try to set mine to 3gb, the maximum is only 2gb(2048mb).It wont let me go higher.	St
1.4.3	Here's a picture of what im taking about, http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/lgkpkeqatf.thumb500.jpg And another question,=D,my computer actually can support window xp 64bit, should i format to 64bit?	St
1.4.4	does it affect my ram problem?	St
1.4.5	and from the link &quot; http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366778.aspx &quot; it says that it doesn't really affect because 32bit can support up to 4gb while 64bit can support up to 128gb.so what do you recommend??	St
1.4.6	=)	St
1.5.1	Without the /3GB in boot.ini, it is indeed limited to 2.0GB in many apps.	St
1.5.2	All is well but you may need to read the links.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	I've read the link.but im not quite sure i understand completely.	St
1.6.2	It says physical memory limits in xp ,for 32bit, is 4gb.	St
1.6.3	but that doesnt explain my situation rite?	St
1.6.4	hmm.. =s 1 more thing, What does loaded image and 4gt means?Where do the loaded image appear in?	St
1.6.5	xD Mind to explain briefly ?	Ques
1.6.6	thnks in advance.	St
1.7.1	Noted that XP limits applications to 2GB.	St
1.7.2	Since you are not reading the links I think we're done.	St
1.7.3	Not that you don't have a valid question but there is nothing busted here.	St
1.7.4	There is nothing to fix yet.	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	Oh...i see now..i understand.	St
1.8.2	sorry Bob.	Polite
1.8.3	i really did view the link.	St
1.8.4	but i dont really understand completely so i guess i kinda asked stupid questions.. =s.	St
1.8.5	sorry.. thanks a lot for explaining.	Polite
1.8.6	hope i didnt make you unhappy.=s Anyways.. thank you.	Polite
1.8.7	now that clear out my doubts.	St
1.8.8	=) But i still have 2 more questions, if you dont mind answering.	St
1.8.9	1.Where does my 1gb ram goes to?	St
1.8.10	Is it like,in cases when Applications used up the 2gb of ram, Xp will use the extra 1 gb??	St
1.8.11	2.If i turn off paging files will my pc run faster?	St
1.8.12	since no paging into the hard disk and all of the files are kept in the ram.Would you suggest me to turn off paging files??	St
1.8.13	=) Thnks in advance again ..	St
1.9.1	The OS will use the extra 1GB for other than the application things.	St
1.9.2	No, don't call any question stupid.	St
1.9.3	If you don't ask then you won't find out.	St
1.9.4	This issue is coming up a lot with people ordering machines with over 2GB.	St
1.9.5	As to the paging file, just let XP manage it and all will be ok.	St
1.9.6	There is no speed gain by changing that setting.	St
1.9.7	Bob	St
1.10.1	Oh i see.. thnks Bob.	St
1.10.2	=) u've been lots of help.	St
1.10.3	hehe.. ^ ^ i still got 1 last question.	St
1.10.4	Since you say the application is limited to maximum 2gb, would my pc run any faster or will i feel any difference if i add 2 new 1gb rams to get a total of 4gb ?	Ques
1.10.5	Froz, Darn limitations.	St
1.10.6	haha.. xD	St
1.11.1	That we can barely measure it.	St
1.11.2	For instance a pair of desktops we used to render DVDs gave me a good measure back then.	St
1.11.3	We could move the ram from one to another and the one with 1GB would finish the 6 hour task 5 minutes sooner.	Sug
1.11.4	For Vista I think 2GB is the hot spot to be.	St
1.11.5	You can try your own benchmark to see if going over 2GB helps but you will never find 4GB listed in any usable number since part of the 32-bit memory map must leave about .5 GB open for the video card, BIOS and such.	Sug
1.11.6	You will find common reports of 2.75 to 3.5GB reported in the tools but even with the /3GB switch XP doesn't let the apps use more... Bob	St
1.12.1	Oh..i see.	St
1.12.2	hehe.. thnks man.. for everything.	St
1.12.3	=)	St
1.13.1	i have 2*1 gb ram but my computer show only 2 gb ram i tried every thing 1 gb perfectly work and 2gb also i changed the slot but the result is still same 3GB(2GB usable) what will i do ?	Ques
1.14.1	what is the main difference between window 32bit and 64 bit?	St
