Graphic cards and motherboards designed for v2.0 will be able to work with v1.1 and v1.0, and vice versa. In some rare cases it is possible that a PCI-E 2.0 card will not work correctly on a PCI-E 1.0a slot. This is only limited to certain video cards.&quot; But since you declined specifics this is all that can be told.
12954	2	298252	2794016	2794014	Naku	6/17/08 3:53 PM	1.21371798E12	thanx	well this seems to be what i was asking for i couldnt give much specifics because im looking a graphics cards and almost everyone that interested me was a 2.0 and my motherbaord only has the standard pci express slots and my current graphics card is a pci-e x16

Of course if you buy from reputable place they'll have a fair return policy (stores near where I live give 14 to 30 days - one mom-n-pop store gives just 7 days for refund, but will return for store credit up to 4 weeks). I remember reading a report where they ran cards in PCIe 1x vs 2.0. Not only did they work well in both, but there wasn't appreciable performance difference -- the diffs between cards is much bigger than the diffs btwn old and new PCIe. As always, YMMV...
