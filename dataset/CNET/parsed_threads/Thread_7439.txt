<s> Ok so I'm planning on wirelessing the house cause running wires on the stairs and through halls isn't working for me anymore.... </s>
<s> But can I just get a wireles router and the adapters for the computers (PCI or USB) and/or labtops and be good to go..or.. do I have to have a WAP in each room where there is a computer as well as that computer having an adapter? </s>
<s> Would it be better to have WAPs even though just the adapters will do in terms on signal and speed goes? </s>
<s> &quot;Ok so I'm planning on wirelessing the house cause running wires on the stairs and through halls isn't working for me anymore....&quot; Using WAPs means stringing CAT5 to them, so you don't get away from this step. </s>
<s> A WAP in each room is a bit of overkill unless you are living in Buckingham Palace. </s>
<s> Try to centrally locate your router and see who connects from there, you may not need a WAP at all. </s>
