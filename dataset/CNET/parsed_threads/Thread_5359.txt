<s> Hello All, I have a FSB question, my current Motherboard is a Gigabyte 8GE667Pro I have it for about 3 years now. </s>
<s> I am currently about to upgrade my Processor which is a Intel P4 2.53 533 FSB to 3.0 800FSB. </s>
<s> My concern is will my motherboard which is 533 FSB can it hand 800 FSB will it work? </s>
<s> Thanks Tyrone </s>
<s> http://www.vr-zone.com/reviews/Gigabyte/8GE667Pro/ and the Gigabyte site notes it only has 533MHz FSB CPU support. </s>

<s> I understand that....I thought even tho the Intel Processor can handle 800 FSB it would be able to work on lower buss speeds? </s>
<s> Your gamble, but so far, I've yet to find the 800MHz FSB CPUs to operate at all on older boards. </s>
<s> I'm sure someone has had some success, but we've tried it on over a dozen boards. </s>

<s> How much a difference will 533 - 800 FSB To go through all the touble of buying another mother board how much of a difference would it be. </s>
<s> I currently use my PC for music. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> The boards I tried (over a dozen) either didn't boot or if they did booted XP in 30 minutes rather than the usual 1 or 2. </s>
<s> Of course you should try this so you don't have to take my word for it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I do beleive what you are saying about that. </s>
<s> As far as the difference in the 533 - 800 FSB for a Intel P4 with PC2700 DDR333 Ram Working with music programs, how much of a difference in speed and handling apps will there be. </s>
<s> The P4 2.4GHz with 533 MHz CPU. </s>
<s> It was rather incredibly slow. </s>
<s> Not many of the dozen boards even booted with the 800 MHz FSB P4. </s>
<s> Clear enough? </s>
<s> IF i had a motherboard that supported 800 FSB would it out perform a Motherboard that supports 533 FSB If so will it be noticable </s>
<s> My old P4 2.4 GHz 533 churns out a SETI unit in 6 hours on average. </s>
<s> The new P4 3.0E 800MHz FSB box does that in 3 or 3.3 hours. </s>
<s> Very nice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Keep in mind that Intel MB can be very processor family specfic!!!!! </s>
<s> Unless the MB specs say it can that a prescott cpu it can't. </s>
<s> Etc. </s>
