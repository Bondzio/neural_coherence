i have always used micro2000's eraser disk.
extract from their website reads:- &quot;protect the security and privacy of your confidential data.
sterilize old hard drives with eraserdisk, a utility for decommissioning drives correctly followed by low-level formatting the disk .
these actions exceed the us government's security requirements of d0d 5520.22-m, the most prevalent standard for cleaning a hard drive.
wipe the hard drive clean with up to seven disk erase passes that over-write with varied data, including a low-level format for complete sterilization, and use the test utility to make sure you've really wiped that drive clean.&quot; it costs around $40 but is well worth it.
i have also used the disk to low level format new drives.
