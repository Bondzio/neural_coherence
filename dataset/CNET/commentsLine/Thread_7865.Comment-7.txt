your posts seem to want to engage me in some other topic about credentials and more.
let's help this member now.
the bad device/pc was easy to find since only that wap was showing connection issues.
we used the old binary search method to find it.
as a seasoned tech you may know this one.
you install a wap in the area and you put half of the users on one and the other on the new wap.
if there is a troubled pc it will be in that wap that has troubles.
so from 15 or less pcs we're down to 7 or 8 and we only have a few more moves to find the machine.
then we can swap out that machine and see if we got it.
