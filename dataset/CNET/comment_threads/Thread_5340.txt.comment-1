I have Windows XP Pro (service Pack 2)AMD Duron Processor 945 Mhz and 384 MB of RAM.
I have an NVIDIA GEForce 4 MX 440 w/AGP 8x version 1.2.0.82..(which seems to be the latest version) I am having problems playing a game as all images keep flickering different color shades.
Need help on how to rectify this issue.
Thanks much.
