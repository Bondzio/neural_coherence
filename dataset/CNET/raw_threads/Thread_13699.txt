I have heard of people overclocking Video cards and even RAM but does anybody have any favorite OC programs? I am looking to overclock: Intel P4 530 LGA775 processor(3GHz) BFG Tech (nVidia) GeForce 4 Ti 4600 Graphics Card and 512mb Wintec PC2700 (333MHz) RAM -Thanks-

THERE ARE NO PROGRAMS TO OVERCLOCK YOUR CPU. yes its done in the bios, the ram timings are done in the bios, the video card, this is the third post that asked that. we posted links and our favorites. its called use the search bar.
4249	2	110999	1261223	1261176	law_john	6/24/05 8:29 AM	1.11960174E12	ok look	First of all you have no right to get angry with me. I have never delved into the aspect of Overclocking before so this is new to me. Sorry for trying to learn something new! By the way, there are a few programs like the Intel Desktop Board Controller and the nVidia System Utility. I have used search engines and nothing is making all that much sense to me, so in effect unless you have something helpful to say, tell me, otherwise in no way are you forced to reply to this post in a disparaging way (given you understand what the word &quot;disparaging&quot; means).

USE CNET'S SEARCH BAR. mean? i am trying to help you otherwise i wouldnt reply. yeah i post a link to programs that overclock in the OTHER thread that asked this SAME question. (given you understand what the word &quot;disparaging&quot; means what the hell do i care what that means? sounds like a nerd uses that word. konny

And if you have an Intel made mobo, it is very likely to not really support overclocking. [I'm not talking about a non-Intel mobo with an Intel chipset, many of those DO support some form of overclocking. I saw nothing wrong with you posting such a question, so stick around the forums.
4249	8	110999	1262626	1262495	law_john	6/24/05 6:05 PM	1.1196363E12	Thank you	Thank you Ray for being so nice. I will certainly stay with the forums. Thank you too Jonah for giving me such an informative link. My Motherboard is made by ECS and I just found out that the overclocking was for CPU speed but I think I also found a way to OC my RAM which will also affect system bus (learned that from the link:) )! Thanks again Ray, Jonah, and anyone else who joins this post.

4249	10	110999	1264001	1262703	law_john	6/25/05 2:46 PM	1.11971076E12	RE:	Does the same go for PCI-e video cards? in BIOS it says ''CPU speed'' and it is the same as the RAM MHz - i can put it on auto or manual and your saying that if I raise it will raise the FSB speed and OC the RAM, right? how far is too far voltage wise? last question is - if i want a FSB of 800mhz (Hyper threading) do i need DDR2 800 memory (which my MB doesn't support)?
4249	11	110999	1264509	1264001	ozos	6/25/05 10:40 PM	1.1197392E12	ugh, DDR2	this is one of the few things where I can do nothing but hang my head and say simply, i don't know I can tell you a few things: A) a PCIE video card overclocks identical to an AGP card (in terms of how it's done, a PCIE X800XL may do better than an AGP X800XL just because it's a different GPU (you could have 2 identical AGP cards, one won't OC 10MHZ and another gives you 150MHZ) B) when overclocking the video card, please consider the following, ideally the RAM is twice the core clock (on most cards, on some cards such as an FX 5900XT however this is not the case, just look when your OC'ing (with Coolbits2 for your GeForce4 Ti) if it's running with the core speed at 50% of the RAM speed, try to keep that ratio) C) only go up 5MHZ at a time, if core starts at 325, goto 330, then try 335, and so on you have to hit test settings wtih Coolbits2 each time, and hit apply each time it passes, if you don't hit apply it won't put the OC at your desired level D) raise the RAM accordingly as for volts don't go far from stock i'd suggest leaving the RAM at stock voltage (just leave it's voltage alone) as for the CPU leave it be as well in addition noone has bothered to tell this guy he doesn't have a PCIE slot... if your using a GeForce4 Ti 4600, you have AGP

Intel gets the 800 MHZ FSB by what they call &quot;Quad Clocking&quot;, mostly with PC3200. It is somewhat confusing because with some of the Intel chipsets they still give the 800 MHz FSB using PC2700. The confusing issue is that they still clock the memory at its native clock rate. Here's a link to the Intel data on your CPU. Numerous documentation that you can get to from there to download all types of info. http://developer.intel.com/design/pentium4/datashts/302351.htm I know that with the Intel 875p chipset they still run the 800 MHz FSB when using PC2700 memory. They are still running the memory at its normal speed. However, the memory bandwidth is less when using PC2700 than with PC3200. In order to get the maximum bandwidth that a P$ can use, you must use PC3200 AND be in Dual Channel mode. Whether or not the Gforce allows the 800 MHz FSB with PC2700, I can't be sure. Just seems that if you are an overclocker, you should also be running Dual Channel.

Those CPU's have the multiplier top locked, so you can't overclock by using the multiplier [the CPU simply ignores any mobo multiplier setting]. Also since the 800 MSB clocking is not simply a multiple of the memory bus clock, it seems that all you can do with the Intel CPU is clock the memory faster and possibly get a little better memory bandwidth. How one would measure this improvement, I know not. Use Ozos as your refernece for other info.
4249	14	110999	1265800	1264942	law_john	6/26/05 7:58 PM	1.11981588E12	I have 915	My Motherboard is made by ECS and is a 915P-A chipset (LGA 775) Link: http://www.ecsusa.com/products/915p-a.html I haven't heard of Dual channel except in DDR2, i think you need PC3200 RAM or higher to run Hyper Threading most effectively as the cards run at 400MHz and HT is really just two 400MHz bands right? Anyways looks like I'll be buying RAM soon.

4249	17	110999	1267344	1265800	Ray Harinec	6/27/05 2:08 PM	1.11988128E12	Hyper threading is actually two	processes running inside the CPU at the same time. Primary difference between that and DUAL CORE is that HT shares some of the various registers and things between the two processes, while with dual core each process has a complete set of registers and othe internal support functions. There are articles for which type of use that HT helps and those where its best to turn it off. I don't bother to remember which is which because I do so little with may computers.
