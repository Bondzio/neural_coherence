<s> I'm looking into setting up a system for a customer that wants to boot from an external drive and have no internal drive. </s>
<s> This is the control computer for a device that will be used in several locations. </s>
<s> They want to isolate the use of each disk drive to a specific location for security purposes. </s>
<s> I'm using a Dell OptiPlex GX270. </s>
<s> The system has USP 2.0 ports, but I'd consider IEEE 1394. </s>
<s> Has anyone tried this? </s>
<s> Will the system recognize the external drive as the only drive and boot from it? </s>
<s> Are there any special considerations for the installation of WinXP Pro? </s>
<s> Thanks, Dan . </s>
<s> If your setup allows boot from other, network or scsi then you should be able to do so. </s>
<s> Don't believe you can boot from USB. </s>
<s> I could be wrong but believe USB is loaded following boot to allow for hot swapping. </s>
<s> There is no reason the IDE connects cannot be routed to a rear connector and a hard drive placed in an enclosure with separate power. </s>
<s> Everything internal will need to be exactly the same as I'm sure you are aware. </s>
<s> I've yet to see WinXP pro boot from an USB 2.0 drive. </s>
<s> It's not supported. </s>
<s> What is done is drive racks. </s>
<s> Then the drive is removable. </s>
<s> What make put the kabosh on Windows XP is that it's ACTIVATION may kick in on each hard disk and you'll need a LICENSE for each install of Windows XP. </s>
<s> This could add some expense you were not expecting. </s>
<s> Do investigate this. </s>
<s> Dell has supplied drive racks for years. </s>

<s> Now that is SUPPORTED, and here's an external case... http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=35SATA-2148&cat=CAS Just for example. </s>
<s> The XP license issue may bite the budget. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Dell tells me that this should just, plain work. </s>
<s> I was a bit surprised to hear it, but it's their system and I can't readily argue the point without trying it. </s>
<s> In any case, it's not going to be that cheap for the customer, so we'll see what they want to pay for. </s>
<s> Thanks, Dan . </s>
<s> One of our laptop users made the mistake of leaving his USB floppy drive locked in a drawer in his locked office where anyone could get at it. </s>
<s> So I borrowed it for a little while to test the handling of USB booting. </s>
<s> I disconnected all internal drives and was able to boot successfully right off the bat. </s>
<s> So I'm pretty hopeful that it'll work. </s>
<s> Thanks for your input. </s>
<s> Dan . </s>
