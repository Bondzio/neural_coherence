1.1.1	My son wants to transfer VHS tapes into his Mac so he can edit them with iMovie .	St
1.1.2	Are there any reasonably priced Composite video to IEEE1394 converters available ?	Ques
1.2.1	It could be the easy way .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	What you are trying to do is convert analog video to digital video .	St
1.3.2	IEEE1394 ( Firewire ) is just the means of transporting the converted video to the Mac .	St
1.3.3	There have been a number of discussions about this subject recently .	St
1.3.4	If you have a digital movie camera , it almost certainly has a IEEE1394 connection on it .	St
1.3.5	It may also have RCA Video connections .	St
1.3.6	A look at the manual may reveal that it is possible to use the camera as a analog to digital convertor .	St
1.3.7	You may also want to take a look at www.canopus.com They sell analog to digital convertors that use IEEE1394 connections .	St
1.3.8	P	St
1.4.1	most video camera 's ( the good ones ) that are digital have a analog pass through for you to do stuff like that .	St
1.4.2	but if you do n't i would suggest the Data Video DAC-200 its a by-directional analog-digital converter .	St
1.4.3	yes it is a little steep in price but it is worth it .	St
1.4.4	http : //www.datavideo.us/fs/products/dac200_fs.htm	St
1.5.1	Thanks to everyone for your help .	St
1.5.2	My son does indeed have a digital video camera with that capability .	St
1.5.3	He just did n't think he could use it that way .	St
1.5.4	You should have seen the look on his face when I told him about it ... .Thanks again	St
