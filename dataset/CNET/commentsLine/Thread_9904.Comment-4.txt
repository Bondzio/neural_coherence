thanks, toni h and loren!
i just downloaded from the manufacturer websites all the drivers needed for winxp but i am not sure how to install them into my pc.
in fact, the drivers for the sound card, video card, and the modem now installed came from the winxp installation cd and they are all working properly.
but what i need now is to install the correct drivers for them but how?
