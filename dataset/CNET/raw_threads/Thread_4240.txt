Is it possible to hook up a wireless router without physically connecting it to any computer, or does there have to be at least one wired connection for admin purposes?

But without any connection to the Internet, such will not offer much of anything interesting Bob

As you probably already figured out, the default &quot;out of the box&quot; settings will typically work like plug-and-play. As long as nothing specific needs to be entered for your router, like names and passwords, then the router plugging into your cable/DSL modem will get your router on the air. Installing the wireless card into your PC is typically set up to the default of using any found, and open, wireless network. Of course, sometimes things don't work like they're supposed to, and you have to tweak. But that is how it is supposed to work. Just remember that without setting up some things away from those defaults leaves your wireless network exposed for others to gain access just as easily. You might want to enable some of the security measures.
