All information about SATA hotswapping is very unclear: Does this motherboard support SATA hotswapping? That is, does it have the ability to detect if you connect a external harddrive with SATA-II connector, to the SATA port (through an e-SATA connector at the back of my case, that is connected directly to one of the motherboard's SATA ports). If I try in Linux, nothing happens. If I try in Windows, nothing happens either. And if I disconnect it while in Windows, it crashes. So I assume that either my Linux and Windows will need some drivers to support e-SATA hotswapping, or the motherboard just doesn't support it. Does anyone know what the deal is, and how I can get it to work? I can connect the external HD through USB2.0 of course, but SATA is much faster, I want to play games from this HD and still have the ability to disconnect it from my PC and connect it again without rebooting.

If an owner missed a driver or has an outdated BIOS that the driver needed then it fails. I have not researched YOUR board but the number of times I encounter a missing driver is nearly 100% of the time. Bob

Back a long time ago it was thought it was when you didn't tell the OS you were going to remove a drive. Today you see this in the no-support zone. For Windows you'll have to eject the drive prior to removal. Bob
