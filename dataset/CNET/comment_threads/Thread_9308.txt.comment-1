I removed and refilled the black ink cartridge on my 880 and and could not get it to print.
Multiable cleanings would not improve quality of color so I removed it also and filled all the head wells with head cleaning fluid.
[read this was very effective on episons] Now black or color will not print.
Is this one of the Episons that has a chip to stop reuse of cartridges?
