buying asian parts is practically a mute point as most computer parts are from the pacific rim area.
just buy what you feel comfortable with and best warranty if any.
your system looks very capable, i see nothing that stands out as an issue from the h/w.
don't count on speed as a system measure, its more of the guts that can crunch all this in a reasonable time.
however, you need to consider the os(you didn't mention), thus a 64-bit one is better for you as you're using video or audio editing, etc, into the mix.
xp or vista 64-bit is probably a good choice and you can add more ram should the need arise.
i don't like to give advice on specs of an system has usually that's a done deal.
i part is suggesting, &quot;cheap is cheap&quot; so don't buy on cost alone, you'll be happier in the long run.
