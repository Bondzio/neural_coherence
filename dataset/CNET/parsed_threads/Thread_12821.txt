<s> So when I plugin something with a hard drive connector. </s>
<s> My PC will not boot from its Windows partition. </s>
<s> I don't know if this is a BIOS setting that I don't want on or something else that is what I need help clarifying. </s>
<s> I have also built this PC in June so keep that in mind. </s>
<s> Can you tell more about &quot;will not boot from its Windows partition&quot; means? </s>
<s> And what it does? </s>
<s> And the relevant history from June until now. </s>

<s> I've run across home built PCs and folk seem to forget one of the SATA connection rules which is &quot;Place the boot drive on the lowest numbered SATA port.&quot; Later they add another drive and because they had the boot drive on a higher port number, they are perplexed why it doesn't boot. </s>

<s> Can you provide us more info? </s>
<s> And what do you mean by &quot;...I have also built this PC in June so keep that in mind&quot; Hard drive connector? </s>
<s> Are you referring to an external drive with an USB? </s>
<s> Anyways, I agree with R. Proffitt, make sure your primary (boot) drive is connected to 0 or 1 (lowest SATA ports). </s>
<s> If the DVD is IDE, then each IDE port on your MB supports 2 drives (master & slave) - the ribbon cable should have 2 connectors, so you can do that. </s>
<s> You may need to change jumpers on the devices so that 1 device is master & 1 is slave. </s>
<s> If the DVD is SATA, no you can't plug your IDE into the same cable. </s>
<s> A quick search shows 2 SATA ports and 2 IDE ports on that MB. </s>
<s> Unless you already have 4 IDE devices in use, you can attach to 1 IDE port or other. </s>
