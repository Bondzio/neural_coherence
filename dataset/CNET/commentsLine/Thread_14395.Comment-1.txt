hi everyone.
i wonder if i can get some expert advice here - keep in mind this is somewhat greek to me.
i currently have a belkin 4-port wireless g router hooked up to 4 computers (wired) and a 5th laptop wirelessly.
i just got a rosewill rnx-easy n4 wireless n router which i am going to replace the belkin with.
nothing wrong with the belkin, except that it constantly loses the wireless signal and i have to keep unplugging it - really a pain.
the current setup has a printer locally attached to each computer, and printer sharing across the network.
the problem with this, of course, is that to use a particular printer, the computer it is attached to has to be on.
i've got a dell 3100n color laser now and i want to get rid of all these other printers (well, almost all of them - there are 2 i will keep).
the 3100n is network capable, but not wireless capable.
so i was wondering: 1. what's the &quot;ideal&quot; way to do this, and 2. can it be done somehow utilizing the belkin so i don't have to buy anymore equipment?
thanks for the help.
