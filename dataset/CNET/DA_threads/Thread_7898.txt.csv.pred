1.2.1	Some of your system hardware information looks , sketchy , but generally I would suggest looking here : http : //www.matrox.com/video/home.cfm Here : http : //www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Home/ or here : http : //www.avid.com/	St
1.3.1	Such hardware rendering were really just dedicated CPU ( s ) and some hardware on a board so it 's speed depended on how many dollars you pumped into it .	St
1.3.2	Now we have a simple financial issue to solve .	St
1.3.3	Since the real fast boards are over 1K why not go get that QUAD CORE Intel CPU from Gateway or HP that is hovering at the 1K mark ?	Ques
