of DBAN, as far as I remember, is that it wipes all hard disks it can find, including the c:-drive that has Windows and everything on it.
That might not be what he wants.
That's why I asked what program he would be using.
Formatting would be fine before using it as a backup.
But he asked about wiping, which usually means more.
