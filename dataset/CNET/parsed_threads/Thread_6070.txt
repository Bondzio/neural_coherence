<s> I haven't been able to find crap for user reviews of larger scanners for businesses so I'm hoping someone here can help. </s>
<s> I'm looking for opinions on the Fujitsu 5185601/518501 and Ricoh IS760 scanners on newegg.com. </s>
<s> Or any first hand reviews of other large scanners capable of 12x18 scanning. </s>
<s> Also, does anyone have opinions on the included scanning software from those manufacturers? </s>
<s> My answer here is that I have yet to encounter said software to be incapable of scanning. </s>
<s> So all have &quot;worked.&quot; What usually happens is the new owner had other criteria such as &quot;I want to put the sheet to be scanned in and it to scan it with a push of the button. </s>
<s> I want the software to automatically name it per my specification...&quot; That never happens. </s>
