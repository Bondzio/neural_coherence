I have heard that the 8800 series cards, though amazingly fast and powerful, take up substantially more space in your case (rhyme unintentional).
I wish I had your budget for a PC!
As for the power supplies I have heard of people using anything as low as 650w and as high as 1100.. :-/ sorry not too much help on that.
