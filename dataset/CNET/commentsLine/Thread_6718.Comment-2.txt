&quot;in order for a commercial blu-ray disc to play, you need to be able to decrypt the high-bandwidth content protection (hdcp) copy protection it uses.
this can only be done via a dvi or an hdmi connection to a graphics card that supports hdcp decryption.
currently, sony says there are no cards that support this.&quot; later we finally started to see a few cards but you discover you can't use most displays since they must have hdcp as well.
it's a minefield of issues so be sure you have return privileges if you find your selection doesn't work.
covers this as well as  tells more about the vista angle of copy protection.
