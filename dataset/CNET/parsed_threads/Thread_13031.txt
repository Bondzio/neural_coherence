<s> I've been thinking about buying a Kindle and I have a phone that contains all my music. </s>
<s> So, I'm thinking to get something with a hard drive that I can read books and have all my music on. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Maybe you are thinking of something where you put your collection in some cloud? </s>
<s> I really want a hard drive, not a flash drive or cloud. </s>
<s> I see Ultrabooks with 500GB drives but no tablet yet. </s>
<s> But you are seeing what I'm seeing. </s>
<s> Folk who want what their laptop has, in iPad form and size. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Exactly, Bob! </s>
<s> I want something that will last. </s>
<s> My phone was really good, for about 2 1/2 years but it's starting to blink out on me. </s>
<s> laptop or notebook or netbook. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I guess I should have been more specific. </s>
<s> I want an e-reader like a kindle, also I want something I can put my music on and never do it again, like a Zune with a hard drive. </s>
<s> So, this will cost me about $500 and I have two devices to carry around. </s>
<s> Is there something out there that will do both? </s>
<s> I already have a laptop and a desktop so I don't need to have internet on this new device, I just want to download books and music on this new device and be done with it. </s>
<s> There are tablet form laptops but at 3 to 4 times that price. </s>
