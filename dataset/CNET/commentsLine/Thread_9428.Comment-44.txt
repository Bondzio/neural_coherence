everybody on this thread is right, except maybe the e machines guy and the one who changes chips and boards and this and that every month.
he's right too, but he isn't right for you.
the person who cited r. profit's buying two notches below the top of the tech max is the most right for me, and that's what i did 13 months ago when i got a dell 8400 media center with maxed out everything.
it's great, and i'm sure it does more than i need.
but it's technically obsolete.
i don't care, cause it works for me.
and a couple or a few years from now i'll buy something else.
buy it now and don't be cheap cause you will regret that more than you ever will by waiting and waiting.
and once you buy it, stop looking at the advertisements because it'll just make you crazy for no real reason.
