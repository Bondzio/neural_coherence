1.1.1	Im stuck between the 7900 cards and the new 8800's.	St
1.1.2	I have a legit copy of windoes xp laying around, from which i will built my system with.	St
1.1.3	I dont plan on upgrading to Vista.	St
1.1.4	So if the dx10 doesnt work with windoes xp then i dont want to waste my money on a dx10 card, ill go for a 7900 sli instead.	St
1.1.5	Thx in advance.	St
1.2.1	Read http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb219721.aspx#Will_DirectX_10_be_available_for_Windows_XP	St
1.3.1	Man i almost went for the 8800 320mb.	St
1.3.2	Well now at least i can get better performance for less with 7900 sli.	St
1.3.3	Thx	St
1.4.1	I plan on buying halo2, will a dx9 card run fine with it, how far in the future will i be able to play games with dx9.	St
1.5.1	That's what my crystal ball said so I'm sticking with that.	St
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	^lol	St
1.7.1	As I burn rubber to the store...	St
1.7.2	Sorry, your guess is as good as mine on that one.	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	An 8800 GTS 320 will outperform a 7900 gt 512, 7900gtx, and 7950 with no problems and will even hold its own against 7900 in SLI.	St
1.8.2	Not sure how much you've looked into it, but just thought I'd throw in my two cents!	St
1.9.1	8800gts 320mb is faster in most games than 7900gs in sli.	St
1.9.2	and you don't have to worry about the niggles that sli can cause.	St
1.10.1	Im not as knowledgable about the specifications about videocards as u guys.	St
1.10.2	The way i compared how the 7900's in sli would be faster is, i just doubled the clock speeds and compared it to the single 8800, but i guess i was wrong.	St
1.10.3	If the 8800's indeed are that fast i have have no problem purchasing one of them or even sli'ing it later.	St
1.10.4	Cool, now i learned something new.	St
1.10.5	Isnt pc gaming so much fun (and lots of $, LOL).	St
1.11.1	I read somewhere that older cards like the 7900's with 512MB run better then the new 8800 with 320MB cuz of less memory or something.	St
1.12.1	the 8800gts/320mb starts to stumble at high resolutions.	St
1.12.2	however at resolutions below 1920x1200, the 8800gts is as fast as a 7950gt (dual 7900gtxs).	St
1.12.3	so unless you've got a 24&quot; widescreen or larger, one 8800gts/320 will smoke two 7900gs cards.	St
1.12.4	http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/msi8800gts-640_9.html	St
1.13.1	Everyone is familiar with Microsoft's subtle, gentle pushes to upgrade to the latest and newest and more expensive software, e.g.	St
1.13.2	&quot;We will no longer provide Security Packs or updates to this version of Windows after this date.&quot; What's the word with Win XP?	St
1.13.3	I agree with you, I see no point in moving to Vista.	St
1.13.4	My wife can get an outrageous educator discount, my system will handle everything but the highest Aero demands (128MB PCIe card) but I'm having a hard time figuring out &quot;WHY&quot;.	St
1.13.5	Win XP was a phenomenal jump over Windows 98SE in terms of stability, usability, PnP, security, etc.	St
1.13.6	but I don't see the radical need this time.	St
1.13.7	I know adoption of Vista has gone well but is not replacing XP all over the world.	St
1.13.8	Sooo...... anyone heard any rumors about how long Microsoft will continue to support Win XP before putting it out to pasture?	St
1.14.1	I'll pass on the web site but MS does answer that and the dates change with time so my answer will be incorrect as soon as it changes.	St
1.14.2	But let's look at Windows NT 4.0.	St
1.14.3	While it was left with a gaping security hole we fix that with a firewall.	St
1.14.4	Now what's left?	St
1.14.5	APPLICATIONS, not the OS.	St
1.14.6	Who needs Internet Explorer?	St
1.14.7	Bob	St
1.15.1	I think this is getting off-topic, but i would like to make a point.	St
1.15.2	I recently figured out how to backup and restore windows with 'Bart PE' so if anything happens (viruses, corrupted files) i can restore it as it was.	St
1.15.3	As for security updates, i think most hackers will move on to the new vista and most importanatly i won't be botherd by a massage like &quot;Secuity updates are ready to be downloaded&quot; in the middle of the game (LOL), if MS stops issuing them.	St
1.16.1	direct x 10 is a whole new patch over direct x 9c and will cause your directx 9 video card to crash if you can even get it to load	St
