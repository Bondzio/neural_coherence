oh i apologize for not being clear in my original post.
in other forums however, i stated that i am planning on purchasing the ps3 slim so i can't test it right now.
also its the summer break for all canadian unis so i am at home instead of at my uni, and since uni is in another province, i am temporarily keeping everything in a friends house thats why i have no access to any of these.
i do apologize for confusing you or whoever that may decide to post too, but as of now i am just gathering information and i need confirmation from more than 1 source.
however, thanks alot for helping out.
i had the feeling that calypso lcd was junk too so i will stick to using the acer x203w.
