you would need to tell more about your setup.
for example it's great you have it at wpa2 personal but did you do anything non-stock?
that is, we find some routers have issues if you turn on the firewall or deploy mac filtering.
why not talk about router flaws?
you are feeling it so let's get it out in the open.
