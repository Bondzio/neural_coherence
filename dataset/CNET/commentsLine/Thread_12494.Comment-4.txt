my desktop is connected to the internet via wireless (base provided access points outside the building) its the only internet we got.
what i wanted to know is if i could plug in a ethernet cable to my nic on my desktop and then plug the other end to the nic on my laptop and have them share the internet and access files between the two.
if this is not possible just say so and ill stop posting.
i dont want to get hubs or switches or routers because i lack the necessary funds to do so.
