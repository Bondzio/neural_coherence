1.1.1	I really would like to know how to safely overclock my eMachines T6412 with AMD Athlon 64 3400+ cpu on a MICRO-STAR MS-7184 motherboard with Phoenix Technologies , LTD BIOS that is version 6.00 PG ( date : 08/19/2005 ) .	St
1.1.2	The cpu is just about 2.2 ghz at stock and I already tried to look in the BIOS to change the clock multipliter , frequency settings , or voltage settings , but it seems like eMachines hid those settings from me , probably so they would get less service calls .	St
1.1.3	And now I would like to know if there are any software programs that wold let me overclock through windows or if there is anything to do in the BIOS , I tell you I looked everywhere and I ca n't find anything in there .	St
1.1.4	Any help would greatly be appreciated , thank you .	Polite
1.2.1	... but you can download ClockGen .	St
1.2.2	It 's not as good as overclocking through the BIOS , but it 's the only way .	St
1.2.3	Here 's a link to download it : http : //www.cpuid.com/clockgen.php	St
1.3.1	http : //sysbuild.corsairmemory.com/report.aspx ? id=2 and Scroll towards the end where they discuss overclocking , but be warned this is for a dual core X2 , and yours is different , so the settings will be reduced .	St
1.3.2	phantazy	St
1.4.1	... because it 's a proprietary motherboard .	St
1.4.2	All he can do is use Windows-based overclocking apps .	St
1.5.1	... well I understand .	St
1.5.2	Thank you for all of your help guys .	St
1.5.3	I guess I can just upgrade to an AMD Athlon 64 4000+ eventuallyand for now stick with the rated speeds .	St
1.6.1	... wait another 1-2 years and then build yourself a computer which you WILL be able to overclock .	Sug
1.7.1	I would be adding 200 mhz to the clock speed and 400 mhz to the front side bus .	St
1.7.2	I would also be getting a 128 bit memory controller , oppose to a 64 bit .	St
1.7.3	Not to mention , I would be doubling my L2 cache to a whole 1mb .	St
1.7.4	For about $ 250 , I think that might sound pretty good .	St
