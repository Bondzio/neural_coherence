I have 3 Vaios: 2 towers and a little travel notebook.
Both tower hard drives went bad very quickly.
My most recent is ticking on borrowed time.
Now I have 2 external drives backing all data, a drive image and a clone.
I do like the media features but Sony has used very unreliable hard drives.
Also, the DVD write grinds; the DVD read, if I let it activate ruins the DVD because it converts to &quot;0 space used and 0 space available.&quot; Many copies are in RAW image for no reason or selection.
