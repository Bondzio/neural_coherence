<s> for the new display port system. </s>
<s> All you need is the display port adapter, from the Apple store, with the correct connection for your LED monitors. </s>
<s> The extension cables that you need are then just ordinary, very long, video cables with the correct connections at each end. </s>
<s> For example: Display port adapter to DVI, then long DVI to DVI extension cables, then DVI to monitor. </s>
<s> Did you get the NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 with 512MB of GDDR3 memory with Mini DisplayPort and dual-link DVI video output option? </s>
<s> That has two DVI ouputs. </s>
<s> If so, then all you need is the long DVI cable. </s>
