problem is if you really only have one radio it is this unit that has to run in the different modes.
this is similar to the radios that can run b,g,n but not at the same time.
they attempt to switch back and forth but are only somewhat successful.
same with routers that claim to be dual band but only have a single radio that switches between 5g and 2.4g if you were to work for a chipset manufacture maybe you could integrate this type of switching function.
trying to do it with software external to the chipset would be quite the challenge.
the last time i was digging at that level you had to actually reinitialize the radio to change it from ap mode to client mode.
i have seen some newer devices that claim easy changing of these mode but i would suspect they don't mean changing back and forth trying to emulate both devices at the same time.
