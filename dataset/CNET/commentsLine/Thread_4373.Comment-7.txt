thanks for your input on the assessment of the sempron.
after leaving here i went and did some surfing and found a couple of excellent comparison sites.
basically, yes, the sempron is the old duron.
i did build my own 2 pc`s from scratch, and i have the basic knowledge required to keep em both running when parts and programs fail... but i just dont keep track of the high-spec of much of the procesing power these days as its fairly irrelevent to my needs.
to clarify from what i read elsewhere, if you can buy an athlon xp(number) somewhere , its the better choice over the sempron if only because of power/price ratios.
