<s> For a while my computer would stop dead. </s>
<s> Screen would freeze, keyboard wouldnt respond, I couldnt even turn it off by holding down the power button. </s>
<s> Now im lucky to get it to do anything. </s>
<s> A few times while changing out ram i got a boot screen indicating a change in memory, but then it would freeze again. </s>
<s> Ive tried my video card and power supply in another computer, and they are fine. </s>
<s> Ive disconneced everything but the ram, hard drive, and video card(no onboard). </s>
<s> ive even tried without the hard drive, and ive switched ram around. </s>
<s> Any every time i get no response. </s>
<s> If i have the keyboard plugged in it will light up at the very first moment of powering up, but even after several minutes it will not respond. </s>
<s> So a assume its a motherboard/processor problem. </s>
<s> I was wondering what things i can do to troubleshoot. </s>
<s> Im actually okay with one of them being a problem, because ive been meaning to replace them. </s>
<s> but i would like to be sure that would fix it first. </s>
<s> thanks for any help... </s>
<s> But that symptom is consistent with the BAD CAPS plague (google BAD CAPS.) </s>
<s> Not only you but a lot of members are leaving out details which makes any reply just a bad guess. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'll look in to that. </s>
<s> In the mean time, what other details should I include? </s>
<s> Watch as you post for the words in red. </s>
<s> I'm running windows xp pro sp2. </s>
<s> I have a pentium4 (3 ghz I think). </s>
<s> Motherboard - intel d915gav. </s>
<s> 2 512 600mhz corsair memory sticks. </s>
<s> Ati x1050 pcie video card. </s>
<s> Westerndigital 80gb hdd. </s>
<s> And corsair hx520w psu. </s>
<s> I've been testing all my components in another computer. </s>
<s> Everything seems fine psu, ram, video card, hard drive. </s>
<s> And I've tried the ram and psu from the other computer and I get the same results. </s>
<s> When I put the other computers ram in my computer I did again manage to get the motherboard boot screen telling me about the change in ram. </s>
<s> But it froze again at this point. </s>
<s> And I can't get that screen back again. </s>
<s> I've gotten it about 3 times out of at least 40 or 50 boot ups. </s>
<s> If I've got a case of bad caps, it's not apparant. </s>
<s> Everything looks okay and no smells. </s>
<s> But from what I read that doesn't rule it out. </s>
<s> The symptoms are consistent with bad caps, missing heatsink compound and just bad boards. </s>
<s> But remember there were never any diagnostics to test it down to the board so we use the story and inspect the caps to give our diagnosis the best results. </s>
<s> Sounds like a bum board. </s>
