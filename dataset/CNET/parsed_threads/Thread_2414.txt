<s> Ok I'm new at this and after debating for a while I want to upgrade my Dell XPS 420 (that's a few years old), I'm looking to put some money into it. </s>
<s> Right now everything is stock, Intel Quad Q6600 2.4ghz CPU, 500GB HD, 3GB RAM, 375W PSU w/ dual 12v rails @ 18a each, and a Radeon HD 2400 Pro (32-bit Vista). </s>
<s> I found out that I have a Dell OTP406 Mainboard/Motherboard with X38 chipset. </s>
<s> I'd like to OC my CPU to about 3.0-3.2ghz, but I think my BIOS is locked, is an over-clock even necessary? </s>
<s> So far my plan's are to reformat the HD and install Windows 7 (32-bit or 64-bit) Home Premium, add 1GB stick ram, put in a Corsair TX650 Watt PSU that has a single 12v rail @ 53a and decide on a mid-range GPU (MSI 560TI?). </s>
<s> I ultimately want to connect this PC to my 40&quot; 1080p LCD TV via HDMI, will a screen that big cause problems running a proper resolution @ X1080? </s>
<s> I'd like to be able to play game's such as Skyrim, BF3, Crisis etc...with possible mods on high-ultra. </s>
<s> Will this work? </s>
<s> I want to try and keep this Mobo/CPU. </s>
<s> Any input/advice is greatly appreciated, this is my first attempt at a PC hardware build/upgrade any help is huge, thank you in advance. </s>
<s> We had a similar HP d4999t and d5000t that we replaced the video card to go 1080p. </s>
<s> We didn't need to change the CPU speed. </s>

<s> Could I do it with: Dell OTP406 Motherboard w/ x38 Chip Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 2.4GHz CPU 650W PSU w/ single 12v @53a HD 6870/6850 GPU Specifically on a 40&quot; display @ x1080 resolution? </s>
<s> 4 GB RAM </s>
<s> Here it was not the CPU at issue or bottleneck. </s>
