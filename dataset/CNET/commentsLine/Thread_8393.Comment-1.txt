i made the mistake of choosing to try zone alarm pro when i recently got an automatic update of the program, which i'd been using for quite some time.
when the trial period expired, i decided to go back to the freebie version.
i'm pretty sure the prompts said it would remember all the settings.
it did not.
each internet-related program had to be re-allowed as i launched them.
no problem there.
however... networking is another thing.
i've never been real savvy with networking.
i have 3 other computers on my home network, and they can no longer access my main desktop (the one i've re-installed zone alarm on.)
i can't for the life of me remember how to configure za and add a local network to the trusted zone.
i can see where that is done in the program, and i can see how to add an individual ip address, and a range of ip addresses, and a subnet and all that...but i don't remember how the local network was entered.
is it a &quot;range of ip addresses,&quot; or is it a &quot;subnet&quot;...and where do i find the data to enter into the appropriate spaces?
i've done searches on the internet, but come up with little help.
evidently i did this at one point, because i've had this network in place and running for quite some time.
i am using a linksys wireless ap/router (physically connected to this computer) for my home network.
thanks, rag
