<s> When ever i plug in my external hard drive or a usb stick it always loads lightroom 2. im sure at some point i must have told it to do this but how do i change it back to when just a small window loads up asking me what i want to do with it. </s>
<s> All help greatly appreciated </s>
<s> Review any options, preferences, or startup portion to see if you can change it. </s>
<s> Once done, check it out. </s>
<s> If nothing seems to address the issue, look at the MSCONFIG file. </s>
<s> Goto-&gt;start-&gt;run-&gt;type in MSCONFIG-&gt;click startup button-&gt;uncheck Lightroom2-&gt;save or apply and exit out. </s>
<s> You may have to reboot and try it. </s>
<s> If none of this works, uninstall Lightroom2 entirely. </s>
<s> Make note where you installed 1st(directory) and totally delete it once the uninstall procedure has been done. </s>
<s> Reboot and then re-install Lightroom2, if it requires some preference then, make note of it. </s>
<s> Here you can now change how you want it to load. </s>

<s> You could have also set the autoplay/autorun feature to run when USB is plugged-in, what pgm. </s>
<s> to run. </s>
<s> To change/disable that or make at least ask again, try: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715 Once done and disabled, it won't autorun. </s>
<s> However, you still need to close the pop-up, do that and then the plugged-in device will be available. </s>
<s> If for some reason you want to act upon certain type files(association) then whenever those files are part of the autorun mode, this is what I believe what has happened in your case, IMHO. </s>
<s> Now that autorun is disabled, no pgm. </s>
<s> will autostart again, unless you change it as it will always ask during that pop-up. </s>
