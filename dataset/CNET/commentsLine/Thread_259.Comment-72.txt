(23:35 here).
why defrag?
and how to make a new partition on the drive?
not a standard xp function.
anyway, it's always a bad idea to mess around with partitions on a drive without having a backup of everything that's on it.
so that's a catch-22.
better wait for the external drive, imo, if you've given up on a repair and want to do a clean install of windows xp.
