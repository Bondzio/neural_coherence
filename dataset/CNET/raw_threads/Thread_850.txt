I am setting up a home network (or trying to) but my situation is slightly complicated; I have two computers at my home which I want to share a broadband connection (supplied by Pipex Homecall). However one of the computer is a dual boot with Ubuntu and I would like to have an internet connection using both Ubuntu and using WindowsXP. My plan is to use an ADSL router( i have my eye on a DSL-524T ) and connect everything to that. I assume that both Windows XP and Ubuntu will work with this router? I'm not entirely sure how the ISP fits into all this though? They provided me with a modem and an installation disk when I had just one computer. I have already contacted them and they don't know anything about linux, so they helpfully suggested I search on the internet! sorry to babble on. any help appreciated. I am sure that for many budding linux users this is a common problem. Richy.

The adsl 'modem' is supplied by them along with a disc, which i'm worried may contain stuff that only works with that modem. unfortunately the net is very sparse on information regarding this.

So to share that connection you'll want to replace it with either a combo DSL Modem+Router or some DSL Modem with ethernet to connect to your router. Your choice here. http://www.sagem.com/index.php?id=182&L=0 is the product I think you have. Bob
