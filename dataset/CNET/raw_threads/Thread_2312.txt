In the older PCs...also had ISA (usually black) and AGP slots...usually (AGP). Regards VAPCMD

The desktop model is: Gateway Select 1200 PC AMD Athlon 1200MHz Purchased Aug. 2001 (I know, overdue for a new system) The link and enlarged view of the motherboard does not resemble my computer. The slot that I had interest on was used by a 56K PCI Modem. I do not need a modem since I use broadband connection -Comcast- to access the Internet. My interest on identifying the slot is because I am in need of a PCI slot to set a USB 2.0 PCI card. The PCI Modem slot is a short size slot so based on the comments, this slot must be a PCI slot. I can only thank everybody that provided suggestions and when I receive the NEC USB 2.0 PCI card, I will know for sure if it works.

Then click system devices, in there is a list of all the devices for example my one says things like ''PCI express port - 2581'' something along thos lines is what you are looking for. This is the only way I know of other than looking at it and being able to tell the difference.
3483	6	182682	1996718	1995275	VAPCMD	6/11/06 3:55 PM	1.1500413E12	Based on the slot being occupied by a PCI modem....	pretty sure you're on the right track ! Years ago there were MBs with very short slots for specialized periperhals ...modems was one of those items. VAPCMD PS...Tried to find the model number you posted on the GATEWAY site (support) but no such luck. Was looking for a MB diagram.

The new NEC USB 2 PCI card fit easily and it came up right away. Unlike the other that I purchased from Worldstart, this one came with a mini-CD and simple explanations. I am still waiting for Worldstart justification as to why their card did not come with a CD or why it did not work. Last time I bite their hook. Cheap come on did me in.
