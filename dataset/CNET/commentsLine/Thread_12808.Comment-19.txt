previously i have always had - and - furthermore recommended dell systems.
from my early pii 300ghz & 1ghz piii.
this being in the main because they have always been very reliable and reasonably priced.
looking now however this seems to have changed with the dell web site basically going all out to snare the would be buyer to parting with hard earned cash - not on system components but on warranties etc...you seem to have now pay through the nose for what was once expected.
additionally i have found that upgrading system components through dell is very expensive.
this time i have therfore decided to try a build my own - with a specification i require for my needs - we will see if this was worth the gamble [assuming i do not trash any components during the build process !!]
