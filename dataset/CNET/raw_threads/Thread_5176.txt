I want to give my laptop to my daughter. Is there a simple device that I can get that will allow me to connect the PCMIA card to my desktop? Thanks!

It seems like there is always a way to convert anything to work elsewhere!

I think these are PC-Card The difference is 32 vs. 16 bit interfaces and causes much grief and lost time if you get a simple PCMCIA to PCI adapter. 3. Try http://www.google.com/search?q=JJ-PC0011 Bob

Otherwise I think the router is the way to go - it is available for 150 and allows flexibility for the future. I also see it hard wires to a PC so the desktop doesn't need wireless capability.

The card supports 3G (or not) so you've posed a question that should not be asked. Sorry if that seems harsh, odd or off the wall but that's the quick and bitter truth. As to supporting the Kyocera Air Card now that's something they might answer since they may have reports from the field. -&gt; The bottom line is that it's you that will have to install the PC-Card adapter it's drivers then the drivers for your card. Miss one of those items and it won't work. Support will be light so it's best you be a little self reliant and have done the usual driver installs over the years. Many dive in and plug the parts in but want to call in and have tech support walk them through the software drivers install. Those types have the worst experiences. Bob

I really don't understand everything you were saying about the question I asked, but I do appreciate your help! I do know about drivers but I will probably have some questions anyway. I find these forums to be a lot more plain speaking than the EVDO forums.
