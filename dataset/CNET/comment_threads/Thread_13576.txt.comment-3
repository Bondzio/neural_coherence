Having wireless technology will work very well in an office setting.
I have never used a stock HP cartridge with this one, except the very first one that came with the printer.
HP wants 70 bucks for them, and I'm getting them on amazon now for 11 bucks including shipping.
Our family has always had good luck with HPs.
Another thing to keep in mind is that (at least when I was shopping for a laser) you might want to see if the drum is a separate accessory, and if so, how many pages you can expect to print off of one, before replacing it.
When I was shopping, HP said that the drums are built into each cartridge so you don't have to worry about this, but they can be quite expensive for other printers.
Maybe they are all like this now (built into the toner cartridge), but when I was buying this, a Brother that I was thinking of had it as an extra part that would need to be replaced.
