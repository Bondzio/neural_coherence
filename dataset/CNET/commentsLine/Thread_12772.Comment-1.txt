i'm using an epson stylus d88 on winxp.i have some images i need to print by tomorrow but the black ink cartridge has run out, even though the images have no black in them the printer will not accept the files for printing because the black ink needs replacing.when this happened before i was given the option of switching to another mode where colours are combined to print any black content but i can't figure out how to set my printer to do this.
is there anyway i can over ride the printers settings and get it to print red and blue images regardless of the fact the black cartridge is empty?
of course i could just get the black ink but it's sunday evening and i need the documents to be ready tomorrow morning.
any ideas?
