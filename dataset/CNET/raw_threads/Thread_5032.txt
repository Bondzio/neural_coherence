Proffitt	11/15/03 9:10 AM	1.0688874E12	Re:printer installation	&quot;Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; No mention of the OS, but your mention of RPC gives a clue your machine may have become infected with one of the MS Blaster, Nachi or other worms. Before you think &quot;Oh, that can't happen because I run an Antivirus, be aware that these worms are not stopped by today's antivirus programs.&quot; Such worms can cause a posting like yours. Here's an article about MS-Blaster and it's removal. But before I give you this URL, be aware that there are VARIENTS such as Nachi and others and this article may not apply. http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.blaster.worm.html Bob
