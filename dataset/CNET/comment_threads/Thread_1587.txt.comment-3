You should load ethereal onto one of your 6 computers and sniff the connection for a wile.
All of that ARP traffic and those port scans will be traversing your wireless as well if you do not isolate it with a router.
I sure hope you have software firewalls active on all of those computers.
Cinderblocks really are bad for wireless.
Your best solution is to install 2 or 3 access points in the house about 80-100 feet apart.
You can use Netstumbler to measure signal strength around the house.
