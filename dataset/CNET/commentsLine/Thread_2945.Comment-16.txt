i agree, i trust the concept of registry cleaners, but unless im comfortable with the process involved, i won't use one.
there are scams out there, sure.
but most of it is common sense.
my husband, who has never used one, was having a problem with something on the computer that he couldnt resolve.
he got ccleaner and cleaned it right out.
i am familiar with the registry enough to know how to deal with it, how to stop processes from working, how to clean it by hand.
now and then it's necessary.
too many people, yes, can muck up what they have by seeing funny names in there, and deleting everything in sight.
it also helps to understand its purpose, which is to be a repository for every bloody thing that ever crosses your computer window.
you have to do your homework.
i like mine, my husband likes his.
we're comfortable with them both.
frankly nav caused me more headaches than a registry cleaner every has.
