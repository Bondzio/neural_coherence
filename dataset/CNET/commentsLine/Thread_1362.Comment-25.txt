dust acts as an insulator, and when you leave the side of your computer off you will expose the system to an increased amount of dust.
many components will overheat as the result of excessive dust collecting on them.
as a result you system will run slower and may shorten the life of your system.
just give the inside a good vacuum every so often and that will do wonders.
make sure that you are grounded when you do this or you could end up with a &#8220;kentucky fried computer&#8221;.
of course dust isn&#8217;t an issue when it comes to your hard drive, but as stated above it will affect your system if left unchecked.
