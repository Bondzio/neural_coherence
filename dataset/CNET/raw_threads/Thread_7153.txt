Can anyone recommend a video card with s-video inputs, perhaps bundled with some basic, yet decent video editing software. I have a VCR with S-outs and just need the video card. I built this computer a few years ago and it should be up to specs... It currently has Windows XP Pro; 512 RAM; and an AMD 2100 Athelon CPU.
