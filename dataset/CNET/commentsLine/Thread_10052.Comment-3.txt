you're still way ahead to use ethernet cable and network them.
you don't have to have internet access to do so.
if you've got xp, it's still even possible to install netbeui protocol and transfer files without even having tcp/ip on the one that doesn't go on the internet.
it's not installed by default but is on the xp cd rom.
