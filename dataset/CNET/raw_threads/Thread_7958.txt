Or try to play any game with decent graphics. My daughter gets on to play her sims game and it reboots 5 min into it. It actually crashed while running the screen saver. If im just browsing the internet or doing everyday stuff it is fine, but the second I do anything that puts any sort of pressure on the cpu and or video card it crashes. Maybe a video card problem or a overheating cpu. It gets to about 60c and then dies. Help Help. Any ideas? I have updated the drivers on the video card and updated the chipset drivers on the mobo.
