<s> Hi, Suddenly my previously reliable HP 950c printer has started giving me a &quot;Fail to print&quot; error message, followed by repeated printing of the top 1/4 of the page I wanted printed (I have to unplug the power cord to make it stop)printing page after page). </s>
<s> I unstalled it, removed drivers, HP software, deleted any mention of HP in the Registry. </s>
<s> Then, downloaded latest drivers from HP's website and reinstalled. </s>
<s> STILL have problem. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Try cleaning up the temp files with something like CCLEANER. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ran CC Cleaner with no luck. </s>
<s> I'm about ready to throw it out the window! </s>
<s> If you get 2 years from a printer you've done well. </s>
<s> I would open the window and don't hit anything valuable with it. </s>
<s> I'd write more but clues are slim. </s>
<s> About the last hurrah test would be to see if Linux prints ok on it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've had 6 years out of it and still prints fast and great. </s>
<s> It's got to be a software issue as the part of the page it prints looks fine. </s>
<s> No Linux on my computer. </s>
<s> I think for giggles I'll try a System Restore to before the problem began... </s>
<s> I don't install Linux but boot it from a LiveCD so I can test hardware outside of Windows. </s>
<s> If it doesn't work outside and inside of Windows that's a fine clue it's gone. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I still think this has something to do with a Windows Update conflict since I haven't installed anything else. </s>
<s> I can't believe it's the printer, since it will print a &quot;Windows XP Printer Test Page&quot; perfectly when the printer is installed. </s>
<s> Everything else prints 1/4 page then the Failed to Print error box comes up. </s>
<s> I really like(d)the printer, but I don't know if I like it enough to do a Reformat to fix the problem, and it's sure not worth paying someone to troubleshoot this. </s>
<s> Has anyone else run into this problem with a HP printer? </s>
<s> If you can't then look up HOW TO PERFORM A XP PARALLEL INSTALL and test from that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Disk Cleanup. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Uninstall, reinstall printer and drivers. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Test on another PC. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Test with another printer. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Move to another USB port. </s>
<s> That last item is cruel. </s>
<s> One owner dismissed it and the tech came out, moved to another USB port. </s>
<s> Bill? </s>
<s> $120. </s>
<s> Go figure why people don't try free advice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> #s 1, 2, and 3 (GeekSquad also printed a Windows Printer Test Page). </s>
<s> I have no other printer to test. </s>
<s> I'll try #5 </s>
<s> OK Bob, I owe $120. </s>
<s> I had the printer connected to a USB hub, where it has worked fine for years. </s>
<s> I pluged the printer's USB cable directly into the PC's USB port, and bingo. </s>
<s> Why the hell didn't the techs at HP think of that! </s>
<s> THANK YOU! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Wish I had read this post before spending countless hours trying to make my laser printer work. </s>
<s> It was working and just stopped responding. </s>
<s> Tried almost everything to get it going again. </s>
<s> Computer would not recognize it at all, even after uninstall and reinstall on same port. </s>
<s> Not sure what made me finally try a different port on same computer but I was instantly back up and printing. </s>
<s> Sometimes, things just work out. </s>
<s> =) Don </s>
<s> So does anyone know WHY changing the printer to another USB port works? </s>
<s> If the port still works for other things is there a software fix that needs to be considered as well? </s>
<s> Just curious as I have recently had the same experience. </s>
<s> It's not supposed to matter. </s>
<s> The reality is that it often does. </s>
<s> Sorry but without a long discussion about USB and more... and even then we only have a theory why yours did that. </s>
<s> Let's go with a working printer anyday... Bob </s>
<s> The thing that had me confused was that my computer was recognizing the printer and I could get it to print something from it. </s>
<s> Plus, everyone told me it must be the printer due to it's age. </s>
<s> Glad I hung in there and tried one more post that Bob was kind enough to respond to. </s>
<s> Happy to hear yours was a happy ending as well! </s>
