1.1.3	is there anyway to resoleve this problem please ! ! ! !	St
1.1.4	thanks Alan	Polite
1.2.1	See http : //forums.cnet.com/7723-6122_102-521254.html ? messageId=5103676 # message5103676 about moving programs and My Documents to the d-drive .	St
1.2.2	Also download ccleaner ( free ) and use that to clean your c-drive .	St
1.2.3	Or did you do that already ( you did n't tell ) .	St
1.2.4	Together , this might make a difference , already .	St
1.2.5	Then there might be other folders on the c-drive you created yourself , that could just as well be on the d-drive .	Sug
1.2.6	That 's different for everybody , so I ca n't tell .	St
1.2.7	You can .	St
1.2.8	If the e : -drive is still empty , and you do n't use it for backup ( let 's assume that you have another medium to backup to , which is better ) , you can : a .	St
1.2.9	Leave it empty as long as the c and the d are big enough .	St
1.2.10	b .	St
1.2.11	Move data to it ( like you move data from c to d ) c. Find a partition utility to combine d : and e : into one big d : partition .	St
1.2.12	Totally your choice .	St
1.2.13	Kees	St
1.3.1	You truly need to review just what is on your C drive .	St
1.3.2	If you have installed pgms .	St
1.3.3	to it more than likely any data will also reside there .	St
1.3.4	Thus , it all adds up over the long run .	St
1.3.5	At the same time if you save or back-up to it as well to include any restore points .	St
1.3.6	You can if there are no other problems , simply turn off the restore feature for the time being , save that setting and reboot .	St
1.3.7	Again , provided there are no problems other than what you mentioned , the restore points and thus all its space used can now be deleted .	St
1.3.8	Once done , you can then trun back the restore feature and restart the saving points again .	St
1.3.9	Hopefully , that will use less space .	St
1.3.10	Using any proper cleaner , like CCleaner or similar run it it and also do the std .	St
1.3.11	cleaning and return the used space back .	St
1.3.12	That 's one item , you can also once you saved any data to a peculiar pgm .	St
1.3.13	do a deletion as well .	St
1.3.14	Re-install on the D drive .	St
1.3.15	Make sure it stores it data there as well .	Res
1.3.16	Hopefully that returns some space to the C drive .	St
1.3.17	The saved data can be returned and be used as before .	St
1.3.18	The real solution provided the C drive was small to begin with , replace it with a larger one , rather used or new .	St
1.3.19	Since you have 3 partitions , it suggest you really have one physical hard drive .	St
1.3.20	Alas , since the back-up partition is empty you never actually used it for that purpose -OR- have backed-up to yet another partition , most likely C drive .	St
1.3.21	You system info is sparse , so do tell exactly what do you have installed .	St
1.3.22	ca n't you open the case and check it ?	Ques
1.3.23	You can use the pgm .	St
1.3.24	PC Wizard and run it to display the details of your system as well , once space is available to install .	St
1.3.25	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	thanks guys one thing i forgot to state was that when i go to my computer folder the C drive is colured blue the others are black as normal , when i open it some prgm are blue as well folders are normal i will try what you suggest again thanks	Polite
1.5.1	Follow what others have said here about moving any installed programs off of your c : Boot Partition .	St
1.5.2	Your PC hard drive was partitioned to left a specific portion free for your OS , the c : partition .	St
1.5.3	Nothing else should be installed there .	St
1.5.4	What this means is that every time you install a new program , you will have to tell the setup software to choose the d : Data Partition path to install to .	St
1.5.5	Almost all setup programs will automatically choose c : by default , so you MUST change the path to d : before you install new programs .	St
1.5.6	Having a full hard drive partition is very bad because nothing new , such as updates to the OS , can be installed .	St
1.5.7	Too , there is absolutely no room for a defragmenting program to work .	St
1.5.8	A partition needs at least 10 % free space to work properly , and for Windows virtual memory to use .	St
1.5.9	You should allow more space if you know you will need to install more data in that partition , such as updates .	Sug
1.5.10	Your e : Back-UP Partition is just that - space set aside to backup your d : Data Partition .	St
1.5.11	A good backup software program should be used from time to time to do this , unless you have nothing important on your data partition .	St
1.5.12	Win7 may come with one built in and might be found somewhere on your c : Boot ( OS ) Partition .	St
1.5.13	If you use the current Norton Security Suite , there is such a program built in to it for customer use .	St
1.5.14	( Comcast ISP customers are able to install this great software for free and use on up to 7 PCs .	St
1.5.15	It also has tools for cleaning the registry and deleting temp files not needed any longer , as well anti-virus , anti-malware , and anti-spyware functions . )	St
1.6.1	Second paragraph : ... was partitioned to leave a specific portion free ...	St
1.7.1	You data is all on the boot drive , under & quot ; users & quot ; .	St
1.7.2	Your pagefile.sys ( hidden ) should be moved onto all three partitions .	St
1.7.3	Boot Partition : 512 MB , Data : 1024 MB , and the backup partition should let Windows decide .	St
1.7.4	Do n't use Windows backup .	St
1.7.5	I use Cobian ( freeware ) , but might look at others too .	St
1.7.6	In Window , there is a lot of rubbish .	St
1.7.7	Get a Linux boot-cd , remove Adobe ( use Foxit ) , games , lanuages you do n't use , Norton or whatever other firewalls/ anti-virus you have .	St
1.7.8	Put your & quot ; Program Files & quot ; folder onto Drive DATA , use a good registry/ operating system cleaner ( & quot ; Advanced System Care & quot ; ) .	St
1.7.9	Get a & quot ; chkdsk /f & quot ; to remove any partition & disk faults on all your drives .	St
1.7.10	If you can , use NTFS ( not Fat32 ) on all your drives ; self-healing , less waste space .	St
1.7.11	On my Bott drive , I NTFS-COMPRESS every folder on the drive .	St
1.7.12	But do not NTFS-compress the files on the boot drive ; only the folders .	St
