1.3.1	It's part of a demo I setup to demo my software.	St
1.3.2	The one thing that wipes most out is they installed a firewall.	St
1.3.3	But you didn't note it so your issue may be elsewhere.	St
1.3.4	The machines were new so after Windows Update and installing the antivirus I selected a folder to share, set it to adhoc and rebooted.	St
1.3.5	The other machine I did the same and it asked if I wanted to connect to the adhoc network.	St
1.3.6	Very easy and I can't see how a step by step would be needed.	St
1.3.7	But a firewall could squash this.	St
