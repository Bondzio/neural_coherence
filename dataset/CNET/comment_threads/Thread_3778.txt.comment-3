Yeah I assumed the same thing and initally just installed it and booted the system.
But the SataRaid would not recognize then so I went ahead and formatted it.
I am amazed at the limited info out there on this kind of issue.
I would think replacing drives in Raid arrays happens all the time but I can't find any info on it or troubleshooting.
