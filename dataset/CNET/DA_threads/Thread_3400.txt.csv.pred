1.1.1	What kind of hardware would best allow me to share my PC monitor ( Sony SDM-HS73 ) with my XBOX ?	Ques
1.1.2	I 've heard TV tuner cards or special adapters ( e.g .	St
1.1.3	StarTech COMP2VGA Game-Console-To-PC-Monitor Adapter ) but would like specific feedback if possible .	St
1.1.4	I would prefer a solution that allows me to switch between both uses as easily as possible ( i.e .	St
1.1.5	do n't want to have to plug/unplug stuff all the time ) .	St
1.1.6	The main reason I ask is that I want to use XBOX live but my phone jacks are limited ( 2 in whole house , neither near our only TV where XBOX currently located ) .	St
1.1.7	I would LOVE to simply put my XBOX on my desk which is huge and share the DSL and HOPEFULLY the monitor too .	St
1.2.1	A KVM switch or a VGA switch are the best devices to share your monitor between the PC and Xbox .	St
1.2.2	You 'll need the XBox VGA cable .	St
1.2.3	Here 's an inexpensive KVM : http : //www.buy.com/prod/Trendnet_TK_205K_2_Port_PS_2_KVM_Switch/q/loc/101/10352473.html and a VGA switch : http : //www.buy.com/prod/Tripp_Lite_Monitor_Switch_2_port_s/q/loc/101/10259620.html The KVM switch should allow you to use your keyboard and mouse with the XBox also .	St
1.2.4	As for sharing the DSL line , you 'll need a router such as this : http : //www.buy.com/prod/D_Link_DI_604_4_Port_Cable_DSL_Router/q/loc/101/10326027.html It will connect to your DSL modem and your PC and XBox will connect to it .	St
1.3.1	... that I have a Linksys WRT54GS router that should work fine for the DSL .	St
1.3.2	Thanks for the info and the links .	St
1.3.3	In the meantime I have also found a few reputably reliable VGA adapters which have a quick switch between PC and console .	St
1.3.4	I am optimistic one of these will work well - the picture quality on the VDigi is supposed to be excellent , as well as a couple of others .	St
1.3.5	If not , I will likely get a TV Tuner card ...	St
1.4.1	... unless you want to record your xbox ( or use the tv capabilities ) .	St
1.4.2	the xbox VGA out is much sharper than TV out so go with the KVM/VGA switch if you 're going to a LCD monitor .	St
1.5.1	Although recording some of my XBOX stuff would be hilarious , I do n't really need that capability .	St
1.5.2	Thanks for the tip .	St
1.6.1	To display your x-box on your monitor your going to need a switch that converts rca signal to vga signal , key digital makes such an animal , http : //www.keydigital.com/ProductDetail.aspx ? categorycode=500 & itemno=KDCTCA3 & productname= , but it is pricey .	St
1.6.2	its called the clear video 3 .	St
1.7.1	they 're only $ 40 and specifically designed for connecting the XBox to a computer monitor .	St
1.8.1	does the x-box output in high def using this cable ?	Ques
1.8.2	and where can i find one ?	Ques
1.9.1	http : //www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Microsoft-Xbox-360-VGA-HD-AV-Cable-882224036955-/sem/rpsm/oid/138273/catOid/-13247/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do or search their site for & quot ; xbox vga & quot ;	Ques
