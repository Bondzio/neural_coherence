<s> Hi I have an office with 40 to 50 employees working with wireless connections. </s>
<s> I have a D-Link DI-624 802.11g AirPlus Xtreme G 108 Mbps Wireless Router. </s>
<s> Recently, we've been having problems with random connection loses. </s>
<s> One thing that I have experimented, is that if I have a PC that generates a lot of web requests it will make every PC in the office lose their connection. </s>
<s> Is there a business oriented wireless router that can be configured as easy as the D-Link DI-624. </s>
<s> Please no Cisco solutions. </s>

<s> In short. </s>
<s> Add another WAP. </s>
<s> Set it to a channel as far away as you can. </s>
