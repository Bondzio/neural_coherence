some isp vendors provide some diags to help resolve problems.
check your install cd or isp install directory for any such s/w.
further, if none or no clue to the problem, then your isp support(phone) can help under thier attention.
plus, you really didn't tell us what isp, system, os, etc.
is part of your setup to help you.
