I used these adaptors exstensively and exclusively for my Toshiba Satellite A55-S136 but after a year or so those adaptors die. When I plug them in the blue light on the brick flickers for less than a second and then nothing. I'm not an electrical engineer but is this a case of a short circuit? Any help would be super cool, Thanks.

But definitly I'll probably go with a toshiba adaptor this time. It's too bad though because I wish I didn't have to change out my adaptors so much. Maybe it's my computer's battery? Or is there a proper proceedure of plugging an adaptor in that I don't know of. Perhaps I should have always pluged in the adaptor first to my laptop THEN to the outlet? Thanks for the help.

I do know these can burn out if the old laptop battery is less than stellar. The ONLY thing I am religious about is to never move the laptop with the power plug in. I've repaired more than my fair share (other peoples). It's a lesson I learned by others making that mistake. Bob
