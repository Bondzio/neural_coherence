i was restarting my desktop when a power surge went through my room.
my atxpw550 power source was spewing dense smoke through both the front and especially the back of the pc.
i want to know if the damage would be isolated to the power source or could it have corrupted other vital components as well?
i know, i should have used a surge protector.
but times are tough.
i need this info to know what credit to claim from my landlord.
