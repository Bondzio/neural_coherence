now you see the reason for the post, bob?
actually most smaller print shops buy the 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cardstock (80#) paper, print and then have it cut to size.
all printers i have seen say they can handle custom sizes from width of 3&quot; to 8.5&quot; and height of 5&quot; to 14&quot;, which means they are all short by 1/8th inch in height.
why the hell a manufacturer wouldn't make a printer that accepts a1 flat card size is beyond me.
since it is a standard and not much of a difference.
geez.
thanks for the info on the fladbed printers, but i am not paying $10k for a printer.
so the question is still there: does anyone know of a laser printer that can print on an a1 flat card (3 1/2&quot; x 4 7/8&quot;) size piece of coverstock (80 lbs or 216 gsm)?
?
