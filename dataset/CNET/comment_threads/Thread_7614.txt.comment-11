Hi I think I got what you are saying I'm not knowledgeable about computing but I have looked inside the PC and it is all connected up in the normal way and it is a fixed hard drive the OS (XP Pro) is legal and updates via Microsoft.
But if as you say a copy has been copied from one drive to another it's still a hard drive and not removable.
Please forgive me if I'm sounding stupid to you but I am in the land of fog,mud and whats that burning smell at the moment, but many thanks for your responses.
