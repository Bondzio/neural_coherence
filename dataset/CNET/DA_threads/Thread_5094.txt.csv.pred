1.1.1	Got an acer aspire t135 with 80g hard drive which was partitioned 40g/40g .	St
1.1.2	Had virus problems so decided to wipe the whole system and install my windows home I have .	St
1.1.3	Have now only got a 40g hard drive though How do I get my other 40g back ?	Ques
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Get to the drive management console ( in XP ?	Ques
1.2.3	You did n't say ) and see if you can activate the second half .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	If you had split the drive after the machine came from the factory , then you may have used the restore CDs .	St
1.2.6	These wo n't respect your custom partitioning so I suspect what 's on the second half may vanish as you run the drive management console to format that second half .	St
1.2.7	You did n't reveal the OS or exactly what you did so I 'm left to wonder a bit .	St
