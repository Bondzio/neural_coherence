VAPCD The first post was probably not in the most appropriate catgegory and since I didn't know how to transfer it to this category I re-posted it.
I do like the idea of the tower sitting on top of the desk instead of underneath it but can see your point in minimizing potential problems.
Can you give me some examples of mid-towers to get me started?
I did see a full-size desktop that seemed to have everything I would want-Gateway DX 4720-03, NVIDIA GeForce7100, DVDRW/DVD-RAM w/Labelflash, 4GB RAM(8GB max)DDR2-800MHz PC2-6400, Vista Home Premium 64 bit, Pen.
Dual Core E5200 2.5 GHz, 640 HDD, Fax/Modem-56Kbps, 7.1 channel surround.
Opinion?
Dell is also having some good prices on their budget pc's.
