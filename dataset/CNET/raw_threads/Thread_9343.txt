My laptop really does not respond on the internet very quickly. How can I test the speed I am getting on my laptop? The laptop is Windows 7 64-bit with 2 gig of Ram and single core. I'm using Google Chrome for a browser. I have on order a D-link DWA 566 PCI wireless adapter for my desktop. It is Windows 7 32-bit with 4 gig of RAM. Will I have decrease speed with it upon installation of the wireless card?
