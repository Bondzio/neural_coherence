I actually have an extra case that i can use to transfer my system to so that wouldnt be a problem.
My main concern is the processors compatability with a new motherboard.
It would be nice to be able to pick up a new PCI express motherboard and grapics card and not have to drop $1000 on a new AMD processor.
