<s> As I am sure you know, part of the regular maintenance of a computer is to clean out the dust in it every so often. </s>
<s> I leave my desktop computer on the floor to have more room on my desk, so it accumulates lots of dust. </s>
<s> I was going to use my small, portable vacuum cleaner to clean my computer but was told by a friend not to use it because it may cause static or &quot;shoot&quot; something into the computer. </s>
<s> When I use the small compressed air cans, it often seems like they don't have sufficient power to thoroughly clean my computer. </s>
<s> 1) What is the best way to clean out the dust and debris in a computer? </s>
<s> 2) Can I use a portable vacuum to do the job? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> i don't think I would ever put a vacuum into the computer, maybe parts like in the front where some dust might collect I wouldn't be running it over all the parts in the computer. </s>
<s> I don't know what Air you are buying but all the time I have used Air it is way powerful enough to lean anything I need out of the computer. </s>
<s> After the Can of Air has been used for a while the presure does go down. </s>
<s> A Can of Air costs like $2.00 at Wal-Mart. </s>
<s> That is what I have always used. </s>
<s> a vac and a small brush for years...works fine. </s>
<s> Don't get &quot;ham handed&quot; with the vac. </s>
<s> I can clean most of the innards without touching anything with the vac...just get it close. </s>
<s> Heatsinks/fans/stubborn stuff..use the small brush and then bring the vac close. </s>
<s> There may be no right or wrong way to do this. </s>
<s> Heck...one forum member uses 409 and a garden hose. </s>
<s> I use my Campbell-Hausfeld 80 gallon compressor set at 80 pounds. </s>
<s> Really. </s>
<s> I take the case into the garage and blow it out. </s>
<s> Using a vacuum can cause a problem. </s>
<s> Air moving through the plastic hose generates static electricity. </s>
<s> Really. </s>
<s> Using plastic brushes will conduct static electricity. </s>
<s> Really. </s>
<s> Static electricity and ICs don't mix. </s>
<s> Before you have a stroke, remember this. </s>
<s> Anything in the PC that can be damaged by compressed air doesn't belong there. </s>
<s> Wayne There are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't. </s>
<s> Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about analog and digital data, internet connections, spyware removal, and download free software. </s>
<s> I suggest anyone using compressed/canned air in any form, beware of not blowing too hard(spinning) any fans. </s>
<s> The &quot;geewiz&quot; factor of blowing a fan into untold RPMs isn't good and can easily damage them. </s>
<s> Further, any jumpers need be noted in case they are blown out/off. </s>
