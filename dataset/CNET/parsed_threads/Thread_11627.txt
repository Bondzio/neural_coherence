<s> I think this is a good piece of software with one problem. </s>
<s> I can record music etc. </s>
<s> directly from my computer however since it is set to the Logictech webcam the recording will pick up any noises-speech etc. </s>
<s> in our room.I tried setting it to &quot;Line in Sound Max integrated&quot; but that did not record any sound.Any suggestions please.Thanks. </s>
<s> I asked this question before however here it is again.Thanks. </s>
<s> Assuming this is a forum in the hardware part of the forum, I think it's misplaced. </s>
<s> Better try our http://forums.cnet.com/computer-help-forum . </s>
<s> And be sure to tell more than you do now, because I don't find the problem very clear from your post. </s>

<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I will try the http://forums.cnet.com/computer-help-forum you suggested. </s>
<s> Basically this is the problem in an easy explanation. </s>
<s> On the mp3mymp3 window it states that for recording &quot;Logitech microphone&quot; is being used to record. </s>
<s> However when I am recording, all noises near to the microphone are also being recorded such as a cough or anything else. </s>
<s> I hope this is a little clearer as I do like the mp3mymp3 software. </s>
<s> Please let me know if you have any ideas. </s>
<s> Appreciated. </s>
