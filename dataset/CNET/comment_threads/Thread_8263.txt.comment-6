Any network storage is a &quot;file server&quot;, so don't reject servers out of hand.
Instead, look for reasonably priced units that perform the necessary functions you require (take time to learn what they are).
Low cost NAS generally are slow, awkward to administer and fail (or gag until they cool down) mostly due to built-up heat inside the enclosure.
Brands don't matter as much as the way they are designed.
Better units are larger enclosures with exhaust fan (or fans, ie.
noisy).
Linux units are cheaper obviously due to free OS; WHS units cost more obviously due to Microsoft.
You could be better off running a low power PC (such as Atom), attach a USB drive of your choice and &quot;share&quot; it over the network as your file server.
Again, take time to learn how if you don't know.
