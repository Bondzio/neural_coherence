1.1.1	Hey , guys ...	St
1.1.2	I 've got 1400 dollars to spend , no less , no more .	St
1.1.3	What do you think I should opt for in terms of a gaming system that I would n't need to update until maybe mid-2006 or early 2007 ?	Ques

1.3.1	Paul is mentioning what I have often suggested ... Monarch to build you one .	St
1.3.2	However , Dell had one a few weeks ago that outmatched anything I have ever seen from them for the price , http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html ? forumID=68 & threadID=61303 & messageID=744946 Apparently they were wanting to move their Pent 4 5xx 8400 systems to make way for the new 8400 6xx systems with the new 64-bit support .	St
1.3.3	Course ' Dell changes their free setups and juggle their prices every week , so it 's a waiting game with them to get the best prices .	St
1.3.4	Velocity Vector SX-V Value is also a good deal within your price range .	St
1.3.5	However , they have not switched yet to the Pent 4 , 6xx ( EM64T ) .	St
1.3.6	I would hold off for many weeks to search for the best PC for the dollar , and keep an eye weekly around Wednesdays for a good 8400 from Dell for $ 1400 .	St
1.4.1	The way I see it , you 've got two real options : 1 ) Buy a basic system and upgrade it yourself as you go .	St
1.4.2	( Make sure it 's got plenty of room for expansion ! )	St
1.4.3	2 ) Wait until you have another $ 400 ( more of less ) and then buy something higher up the food chain .	St
1.4.4	I hope this helps you .	St
1.5.1	I would n't recommend Dell to anyone .	St
1.5.2	They 've burned way too many people .	St
1.5.3	Getting a good system from them is like winning the lottery .	St
1.5.4	You might be lucky , but you might not .	St
1.5.5	You know they 're being sued in California , right ?	Ques
1.5.6	If you do n't believe me , you can always check things out at www.complaints.com .	St
1.5.7	Just type in & quot ; Dell & quot ; , and see for yourself .	St
1.6.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html ? forumID=68 & threadID=90954 & messageID=1043983 and http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-6142-0.html ? forumID=69 & threadID=65786 & messageID=1044029	St
1.7.1	If you buy from some OEM , like Gateway , Compaq , etc .	St
1.7.2	make sure to read the specs in to upgrade/expand later , that can be done .	Sug
1.7.3	I tend to like eMachine ( high end models ) .	St
1.7.4	Further , if you have a system build for you , it usually offers the greatest flexibility in order to update and maintain a level of freshness for continued use .	St
1.7.5	But , since you want a decent gaming system , you pretty much paint yourself into a corner , it maybe better to wait and save some more $ $ in order to at least start out with a decent system rather than compromise too much .	St
1.7.6	Still , a generic system at $ 1400 will go a long ways , just be sure you can upgrade , also have as much ram installed NOW in order to take advantage of it as you 're best bet plus a decent cpu .	St
1.7.7	Also , keep in mind a very good power supply is a MUST ! , it is takken for granted and so much depends on its operation , thus get a good one ( namebrand ) .	St
1.7.8	enjoy -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.8.1	Since you said gamming system check out AMD64 processors , when it comes to gaming AMD wins .	St
1.8.2	I know the P4 guys will complain but , oh well .	St
1.8.3	You could built one for yourself , with a $ 1400 you easly get AMD64fx processor with 1gb of memory , screaming video card .	St
1.8.4	If your interested in going this route just repost and I 'll post some links .	St
1.8.5	John	St
1.9.1	In my humble opinion- www.ibuypower.com You can get whatever you want for cheaper than anywhere else I have found .	St
1.9.2	People have recomended monarch computers , and I checked it out ... its not quite as cheap and VERY confusing if you do n't know EXACTLY what you want .	St
1.9.3	Make sure to upgrade your power supply from the stock case , other than that , pretty much anything you will get is good quality .	St
1.9.4	Also- what games/types of games , are you gon na be playing ?	Ques
1.10.1	go newegg and buy parts and build a customized pc	Sug
1.11.1	Are computers by Velocity Micro worth considering ?	Ques
1.11.2	Yes or no ?	Ques
1.11.3	Comments anyone .	St
