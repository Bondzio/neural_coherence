<s> My operating system is Windows XP. </s>
<s> I was given the subject video card by a friend. </s>
<s> XP picks up the card and loads the drivers; however, at the end of the boot process the screen goes blank showing nothing but a curser (I do see my desktop for about 30 seconds). </s>
<s> My monitor is plugged into a video port on the motherboard of a Dell. </s>
<s> Are there jumpers on the motherboard or something else I need to adjust/fix my problem, and keep the screen from going blank when I plug my monitor into the video card? </s>
<s> Asking the experts. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Find drivers (I suggest google.com) then boot SAFE MODE to install them. </s>
<s> That's a very old card, but your issue is typical for a clean XP install. </s>
<s> Many learn that Microsoft does NOT supply drivers for MOTHERBOARDS, Video and Audio cards. </s>
<s> All this is done by you, the installer. </s>
<s> Happy hunting, Bob </s>
