Hi I have a client who requres tablets for a number of users.
Am having problems sourcing the best tablet: Requirements: O/S Windows or Android as a vital app they/program they use is only available on Windows or Android 3G capability (either through direct sim or dongle) as they work rurally and will not always have a wifi connection Be able to print.
We have had trouble finding a printer in NZ that is cheap enough to purchase and is easily connected to by the tablets.
Seems to be a hard ask finding Samsung tablets in NZ at a reasonable price.
Any ideas would be really helpful.
