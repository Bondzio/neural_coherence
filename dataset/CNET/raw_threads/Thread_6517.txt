My 5 year old Linksys router (WRT54G) is dying a slow death (regarding laptops picking up the wireless connection) and I'm replacing it with a new router (WRT54G2). My desktop computer (Dell Inspiron 1720) is running Windows Vista Home Premium (32 bit) and I have a DSL modem. My question concerns unhooking the old router and hooking up the new router. What are the steps? Should the computer be on or off when unhooking and re-hooking? Is it advisable to turn off the firewall during this process (I'm using the latest version of Comodo's firewall)? Any help would be appreciated.

The salesperson at Best Buy told me I can use the included CD to guide me through setup. Is this necessary? Can I just type 192.168.1.1 and go through the tabs to mark the new settings the same as what the old settings were?

After you're done, save the configuration to your hard drive as a backup. You may need it if you ever do a firmware update. After you do an update the backup will put your settings back and you don't have to configure it again.
