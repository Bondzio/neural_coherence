I have a Motorola SURFBoard 6580 as my cable modem + router + 802.11n AP.
I wanted to add an AP on the second floor of the house for better signal.
I have read that APs from different manuafacturers are not necessarily compatible for seamless roaming.
I just want to see if anyone has experiences on it.
Well, I guess the worst case is to turn off wifi on the SURFBoard and get 2 identical APs, but that's not ideal.
Thanks for any suggestions.
