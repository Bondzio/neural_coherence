Hi Folks, hope somebody here can point me in the right direction.
I uninstalled McAffee Security in preparation for a Zone Alarm download/install, and it seems that that caused my Network adapter to stop connecting to the internet.
I'm running XP Home and its an Intel network card.
I've tried deleting and reloading the card driver but it doesn't seem to be able to accept automatically assigned IP or DNS adresses.
I've lost count of the variations of IPCONFIG that I've run.
I'm thinking a remnant of McAffee might be causing it the fault but can anyone here think of a fix or something else that I haven't considered?
Thanks Rich
