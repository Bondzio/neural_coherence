<s> Hello all, My problem is that whenever I insert a DVD in my drive, it causes the system to hang, and I have to remove the DVD and reboot the system. </s>
<s> Here are the specs: DVD Drive: SONY DW-G120A-B2, DVD/CD RW Drive unit OS: Win XP SP2 I tried locating the latest driver from Sony's website, but my particular model is not listed at all on the site. </s>
<s> From another site, I located a driver which is MYS3WIN, but my existing driver is MYS5WIN, so I have hesitated in experimenting. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any help in getting my DVD drive running! </s>
<s> Thanks, Sanjay. </s>
<s> These are not on Microsoft's CDs so I get the System Recovery CDs for the system and return it to factory conditions. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
