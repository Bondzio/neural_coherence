I'd be interested in such a monitor as my work has me working in multiple resolutions. Things are just a bit too blurry when not working at the native resolution (unlike a CRT monitor). Thank you all for your time, Paul

Microsoft and others attempt to clear it up with software like Clear Type but for now, for today you want to run at the native resolution and use the DPI and font size settings to get a clear image. Changing the video display mode is no longer the proper method to enlarge fonts, etc. However it taps some owner's computer skills to use the new ways so you have to be gentle about it. Bob
