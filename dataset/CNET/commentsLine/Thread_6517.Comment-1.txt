i know very little about this area and think my questions are stupid, but i don't want to mess anything up so i have to ask them.
my 5 year old linksys router (wrt54g) is dying a slow death (regarding laptops picking up the wireless connection) and i'm replacing it with a new router (wrt54g2).
my desktop computer (dell inspiron 1720) is running windows vista home premium (32 bit) and i have a dsl modem.
my question concerns unhooking the old router and hooking up the new router.
what are the steps?
should the computer be on or off when unhooking and re-hooking?
is it advisable to turn off the firewall during this process (i'm using the latest version of comodo's firewall)?
any help would be appreciated.
