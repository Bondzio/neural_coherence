<s> G'day, I have a Western Digital Home Basics eSata/Firewire/USB2.0 enclosure, which had come with a 1TB &quot;Green&quot; SATA drive. </s>
<s> I had hoped to put a 250GB Maxtor MaxLine II SATA drive into it - the one that had been inside my Power Mac G5. </s>
<s> But, when a firewire cable is connected, the drive light just flashes on/off at about 1 second intervals, and with a USB cable connected the light stays on full, but both options fail to mount the drive, or even make it visible to the computer - although Disk Utility does take a long time to decide it can't see them... (ie as if it's trying... but fails) Any ideas how I can get the Maxtor to work in there? </s>

<s> Um, that has no relevance... </s>
<s> I'm having the same problem - WD HD in an external enclosure connected to iMac, HD light flashes every second and doesn't mount. </s>
<s> Were you able to find a solution to this problem? </s>
<s> Enclosure works fine with another WD HD. </s>
<s> &quot;Enclosure works fine with another WD HD.&quot; Replace the WD HD that has failed. </s>
