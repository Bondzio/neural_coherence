<s> My system: Shuttle SN68PTG6 DELUXE AMD 6400+, 4GB, WD SATA III 600GB HD Want to add: WD 3TB SATA II HD and LG SATA 24X CD/DVD Burner Is there a SATA controller with at least 3 ports that I can put all these on one PCI-E x16 slot Will not be using RAID and have no FD. </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> Installing a 3Tb drive requires a special adapter from WD. </s>
<s> This not something to ignore or bypass, it should be explained in the docs, if you didn't get the whole kit. </s>
<s> If you got non-kit supplied 3Tb drive, then you need that adapter to fully be installable. </s>
<s> In your case, you already have an adapter to supply SATA ports, but does it support 3Tb drives. </s>
<s> Thus, it can get complicated real fast. </s>
<s> However, it can be in &quot;addition&quot; to other ports using the WD supplied adapter. </s>
