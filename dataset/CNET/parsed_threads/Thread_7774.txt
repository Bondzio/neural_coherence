<s> I would like to build my own PC soon and I have a few questions. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Is it easier to buy a PC with the processor, I want, then upgrade from there (graphics card, RAM, etc) or is it easier to just start from the ground up. </s>
<s> I have some computer experience, and have changed RAM, graphics card, sound card, drives, HDD's, etc. </s>
<s> I don't have any experience though with fans, mother boards, processors, etc. </s>
<s> I thinking of buying an HP with an Intel processor, at least 2GB of RAM, and upgrading the graphics card, etc on my own. </s>
<s> Also, is there one company that is better than another for buying PC's from and being most upgradable. </s>
<s> Finally, are there any books out there that can tell me how to build one. </s>
<s> Thanks alot! </s>
<s> upgrading the graphics in a pc from a mainstream manufacturer can be more difficult since hp/dell/compaq/emachines etc. </s>
<s> typically only size their power supplies for the graphics card that came with the system. </s>
<s> this usually means 300w power supplies that can't handle cards like a geforce 8800gt or radeon hd3850. </s>
<s> gateway's bought directly from their website ship with 400/450w power supplies so they're more upgrade friendly in that respect. </s>
<s> however, unless the pc only has integrated graphics, you're still paying for a graphics card that you're (effectively) going to throw away. </s>
<s> as for memory, most manufacturers use slower memory than what you'd probably upgrade to. </s>
<s> that and the fact that they sometimes fill all available slots may mean you're throwing away some or all of the existing ram. </s>
<s> if you're willing to build and can budget about $800, you can probably build a better pc than you can buy, but you've got to be willing to deal with the possible headaches of a self-build. </s>
<s> if you want to buy and upgrade immediately, then check the specs on the pc you're buying (make sure its has pci-express x16) and look for minimal ram and integrated graphics. </s>
