<s> Good Day, AS I was reviewing my systems information, something caught my eye. </s>
<s> I first read about my system on http://Cnet.com an Emachines T6524. </s>
<s> Their specification shows Ram DDR SDRAM PC 3200 @ 400MHZ . </s>
<s> When I received my system it came with 1 gig of ram. </s>
<s> I added another gig as my first upgrade. </s>
<s> Skip 6 months and I'm looking at my systems info and realize that I have 2 gig's of PC 3200 @ 200MHz. </s>
<s> So I have my system scaned to see if an upgrade of ram is out there. </s>
<s> Sure enough PC3200 @ 400MHz OK now the $64 question If I switch to the 400MHz will I notice a jump in performance? </s>
<s> Is it worth the switch? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> pc3200 is ddr-400 and its memory chips operate at 200mhz. </s>
<s> since the date rate is doubled, you get ddr-400. </s>
<s> more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM if you're upgrading, stick with pc3200 (ddr-400). </s>
