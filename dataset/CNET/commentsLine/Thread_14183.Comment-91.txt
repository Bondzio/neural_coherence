yeah, remember programming in basic?
remember the luxury of 80 column screens versus 40?
remember the vic (only 20 columns)?
remember how 64k seemed like oodles of memory then, and oh my gosh, affordable color computers (in just 256 solid colors)?
remember using cassette tapes and rewinding the tapes to store and find programs?
remember the luxury of actually owning your own floppy disk drive?
etc
