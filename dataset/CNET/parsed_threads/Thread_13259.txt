<s> I am trying to recover photos from a damaged Maxtor 80 GB Hard Drive. </s>
<s> I tried slaving it on my other computer, but my system would not start (tried all different variations of jumper settings). </s>
<s> I then placed it in a hard drive enclosure and it is visible under Disk Drives, but not listed in My Computer. </s>
<s> When I go to Disk Management, it appears as an unknown device and I am prompted to initialize the disk. </s>
<s> Will initialization delete the data on the drive? </s>
<s> The Cnet Storage Forum. </s>
<s> It's at the top of that other forum. </s>
<s> Read that. </s>
<s> In short, try other titles like ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY, GETDATABACK, RECUVA and Testdisk. </s>
<s> Good hunting and NO!! </s>
<s> DO NOT INITIALIZE THAT DRIVE!!! </s>
