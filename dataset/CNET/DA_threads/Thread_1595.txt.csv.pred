1.1.1	Ok , the story goes , I bought this Epson C82 inkjet printer about 4 months ago .	St
1.1.2	Now I ran out of black awhile ago and bought some at a discount online and things have been fine.Until I ran out of magenta , now nothing is printing , so I replaced all with Epson C80 ink from Office Depot , still no printing , I cleaned the heads 5 times , did all mantenience and nothing .	St
1.1.3	So I thought it was the C80 ink .	St
1.1.4	So I bought C82 ink at a discount online and tried printing just a cover letter and all I got is just some streaks , then I tried a photo setting and I got a very faint and streaked print.Sooo , I called Epson Customer Service and they want to charge me $ 9 for their help , forget that , can anyone help , or do I have to pay the $ 9 for a phone call ?	Ques
1.1.5	I want to throw this thing out the window , Help !	St
1.1.6	Thanks Mike	St
1.2.1	What will irk most is that service and support will cost more than replacing the printer .	St
1.2.2	Perils of lower costs .	St
1.2.3	I will not write much about why removing free support lowers the initial cost of the printer , but I have learned to just pay the piper on ink cartridges .	St
1.2.4	The Epson has some superfine nozzles and I ca n't say if non-Epson ink will clog .	St
1.2.5	But will note that your warranty is void now and I 'd open the window before tossing it .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Go ahead and throw it out the window .	St
1.3.2	But , before that try repeated cleanings as many as 10X or more .	St
1.3.3	Yes , that will use alot of ink .	St
1.3.4	However , if you really do n't want to spend money on ink then buy a replacement as a & quot ; on sale & quot ; printer may be as close as the ink carts cost .	St
1.3.5	Now , next time use Epson ink ( costs alot , consider your past experience ) and if it ever goes dry , install a new ink cart quickly .	St
1.3.6	Epson printers work great when they do and just are a PITA when they do n't , IMHO and I do n't recommend them .	St
1.3.7	sorry ... -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	Are you running the Nozzle check ?	Ques
1.4.2	If so , does it show anything now that you have replaced the cartridges again .	St
1.4.3	Be aware , that pulling out a cartridge and putting it back in is a NO NO with an Epson , it can leave a bubble in the nozzle that will not clear up easily .	St
1.4.4	You really need to clean until you get a complete nozzle check pattern .	St
1.4.5	At this point , about all you can do is try repeatedly , printing a nozzle check each time .	St
1.4.6	It should improve with each cleaning .	St
1.4.7	You can buy cartridges that have cleaning fluid in them , that may fix it .	St
