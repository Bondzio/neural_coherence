The main issie I'm having with the card is something in the device manager saying &quot;out of system resources (code 12)&quot;. I looked into this and couldn't find anything that might have conflicted with the Belkin card. I looked in the the &quot;resources by type&quot; in the device manager and opened up the IRQ settngs and couldn't find any devies conflicting or having a problem running except for the Belkin card. Has anyone run into a problem like this at all?

10845	4	64928	771054	770959	Dark_Chaos5	2/17/05 9:05 AM	1.1086311E12	sorry about that	The machine is an HP desktop (not sure model number because it diesn't belong to me) w/ a Pent 4 processor. I did notice there is a built in Ethernet connection on the mother board that may be causing the conflict. Are you suggesting that I turn off/disable something in the BIOS?

My problem is with an older system that I pieced together. We just happen to find we want it wireless. But I bought the Pre-N router and the card so why not(both for a total of $120). Just can't seem to narrow down what the conflict is yet.

Naturally, you wont be using it if you are going wireless. That should free up some resources. Also, just more food for though....try also uninstalling the Pre-N card and reboot and install the drivers/software again. Good luck.
