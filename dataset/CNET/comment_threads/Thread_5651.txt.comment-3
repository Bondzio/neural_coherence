DON&quot;T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED.
Be sure no free mounting post is touching the bottom of mtrbd.
That all cabling and cards, modules are fully seated and retry again.
If no recovery, remove all devices and see what the results are.
If still no display, disassemble system to bare, place on cardboard and using only PSU and mtrbd.
what are the results after powering-ON?
Any beeps moans or complaints?
Repost after results.
