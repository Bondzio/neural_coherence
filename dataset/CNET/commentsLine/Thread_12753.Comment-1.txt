i used gparted in ubuntu to shrink my ubuntu partition and enlarge my windows partition.
halfway through enlarging the windows partition, the windows partition was mounted for some reason, and the resize process stopped.
now i've got this discrepancy: [img]  [/img] how do i get windows to read this partition as the 62.5 gb partition it should be?
