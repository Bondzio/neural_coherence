<s> Is a Intel Celeron D a ok processor for a low end gaming computer, i think i might have heard that somewere. </s>
<s> i wouldn't recommend a celeron D for a gaming box. </s>
<s> here's a representative benchmark... google for more: http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/879/12/page_12_benchmarks_quake_4/index.html if your budget only allows $100 for a CPU and you're going with intel, then celeron D is your only option. </s>
<s> up your budget to $140 and get a pentium D 805 (2.6ghz dual core). </s>
