1.1.1	Hi there .	St
1.1.2	I 'm having some trouble with my wireless network : I use a Planet WL-8303 Wireless PCI Adapter to connect to a WAP-1963 Wireless Acess Point ( which is about 3.5 Km away ) which in turn is connected to a computer hooked up to the internet .	St
1.1.3	For a long time this setting has worked out for me and I have been acessing the internet without any problem whatsoever .	St
1.1.4	But for no apparent reason , my computer detects that there is a network ( WEP enabled and with network authentication - no news for me here ) avaliable but it just does n't connect to it .	St
1.1.5	Only SOMETIMES .	St
1.1.6	By that , I mean that out of the blue I suddenly get connected to the network and some time later ( which varies from minutes to hours ) I get disconnected for no reason whatsoever .	St
1.1.7	And not to mention that the connection is extremely slow !	St
1.1.8	I 've tried changing the PCI card in to different slots , tried fidling with the cable that connects to the antenna , tried fiddling with the antenna itself .	St
1.1.9	The same problem persists on a Windows system as it does on a Linux Ubuntu system .	St
1.1.10	I just want to stress that it was working fine just the way it was , and for some reason it has been giving me problemas .	St
1.1.11	The hosting computer ( with the AP ) has n't even been touched in the past few months , so I believe the problem lies somewhere between the AP and my computer .	St
1.1.12	Here 's some info of my pc : Windows Xp / Linux Ubuntu Dapper Drake AMD Athlon 1.24Ghz , 512 Mb RAM WL-8303 Wireless PCI Adapter , WEB enabled , Shared authentication , Power save : none , Fragment threshold : 2432 , RTS threshold : 2346 , Wireless mode : 802.11b , Preamble mode : long , Channel plan : FCC , Data rate : auto , channel 11 , frequency 2462MHz , network type : infrastructure .	St
1.1.13	Any suggestions will be greatly apreciated !	St
1.2.1	But what has changed over time is more people have more radio devices .	St
1.2.2	You may have to change or improve your equipment .	St
1.2.3	Yes it worked in the past .	St
1.2.4	Now you get to adjust for today 's RF environment .	St
1.2.5	I fear the fix will not be cheap given the 3.5 Km link .	St
1.2.6	But since it was done before , let the person who built it come up with a new solution .	St
1.2.7	I also hear you when you say it works sometimes .	St
1.2.8	An interferring signal can be on & quot ; sometimes. & quot ; To find that will be costly .	St
1.2.9	I know the last time I was on such a hunt it was with 20 other engineers and vans full of gear for Motorola .	St
1.2.10	When someone wants to find the interferring source , they better be ready to pay .	St
1.2.11	In closing the cheap fix could be to replace each part with known good parts .	St
1.2.12	You may exclaim that 's costly but troubleshooting and finding the interference is assuredly more costly by at least 10 to 100 times .	St
