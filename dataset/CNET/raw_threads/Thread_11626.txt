6366	0	16183	179811	NR	Robynn	3/18/04 9:17 AM	1.07960142E12	networking with AOL	I am currently trying to install a network within my home. Primary pc is on phone line connection, both are running XP pro. At this time I have them connected using D-Link hub, nic in first pc is set with ip 192.168.0.1. Second pc is set with ip 192.168.0.2 - gateway/dns 192.168.0.1. Am able to ping between both pc's with great reply times. Second pc is installed with the AOL software. I am still unable to pull up a website using either AOL or IE browser. Have tried using network setup wizard on pc one but continuely encounter &quot;Spooler Subsystem error&quot;. I know this refer to the printer drivers but it still occurs when the drivers are uninstalled. There have been two of us trying to figure this out, the other person is as perplexed as I am. Any ideas of what else to try????
