By PC, I will assume that you mean desktop pc.
The only battery that I'm aware of on a pc is the cmos battery on the motherboard.
It's the shiny round object,about the size of a quarter, usually held in by some type of spring, on the motherboard.
Carefully remove the old battery, being careful not to bend or damage the spring or clip.
Take it to your nearest computer store, (Best Buy, Circuit City, or other) to get a replacement.
