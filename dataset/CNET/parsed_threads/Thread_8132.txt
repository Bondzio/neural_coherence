<s> This is more of an annoyance rather than a problem. </s>
<s> Just recently when I start up XP Windows checks the FAT32 on my External Drive for &quot;consistency&quot; as it puts it. </s>
<s> I did it once, which took nearly 2-3 hours and it deleted some of my MP3 collection due to bad clusters or something to that effect. </s>
<s> Well, since then Windows still wants to keep checking the FAT32 on my external drive. </s>
<s> I can skip this process, which I do, but I just would like to know why Windows keeps on doing this. </s>
<s> I of course can simply turn my hard drive, but I usually keep it on 24/7. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> That's my fix. </s>
<s> While you're at it...turn it off when not in use. </s>
<s> Leaving it on 24-7 is sure way to bring on early and untimely demise. </s>
<s> Last....convert it to NTFS. </s>
