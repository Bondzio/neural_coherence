<s> Greetings, I am having BSODs with what seems to be increasing frequency. </s>
<s> The BSODs are not software specific and occur idle, in Word, and using Internet Explorer. </s>
<s> They started on 1/17/2010 and continue to this day. </s>
<s> I have used several programs scanning for malware/viruses and everything is good there. </s>
<s> I am running an HP desktop w/32-bit Vista. </s>
<s> I have included one of the latest BSOD minidump reports for reviewing in hopes it will help pinpoint a problem. </s>
<s> I see &quot;memory corruption&quot; in it and ran memtest and it passed with 0 errors and also performed a memory stress test which was successful as well. </s>
<s> Any help would be MUCH appreciated!! </s>

<s> post; it occurs to me that the source of your troubles lies in the memory, as it is stated throughout the debugging as 'Memory Corruption'. </s>
<s> You state that you have run a memory stress test, but do not state which one, here is a link for memtest86+ which will definitely show where your memory is corrupted. </s>
<s> http://memtest86.en.softonic.com/ </s>
<s> Sorry for long post, wanted to get all the info I had out there. </s>
<s> Yes, I used memtest86+ and it found 0 errors. </s>
<s> I used the Hardware Diagnostics Tool in Windows Vista for the stress test. </s>
<s> Sorry, but it doesn't really take a tech wizard to see that your memory is at fault; all reports show that there is corrupted memory in the system, therefore resulting in BSOD. </s>
<s> You paid dearly for that OS. </s>
<s> Now talk to the machine's maker and Microsoft about getting your money's worth. </s>
<s> I'd comment about the failure but look at what you posted. </s>
<s> It's incomplete but when I saw Windows Server 2008 I thought what a lucky person you were to have paid so much for that system. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What additional information would you like? </s>
<s> I have about 30 BSOD Minidumps since 1/17/10 that I could provide. </s>
<s> Would a system restore to factory settings be worth a shot? </s>
<s> I guess that if things still are haywire it would pretty much cingle out the memory, right? </s>
<s> I just can't beleive that the memory passed the memtest86+ and a stress test if it is faulty. </s>
<s> Is that possible? </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Why then does my memory pass ever test I have put it through? </s>
<s> I am perplexed by this and my your snideness as well. </s>
<s> Windows Server 2008 is a many thousand buck investment on Server Grade machines. </s>
<s> You should be hammering the supplier of the machine to get your SERVER up and stable. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> didn't mean to come across as being 'snide'. </s>
<s> You should heed the advice of Mr. Proffit though, and contact both the supplier of your computer AND Microsoft and get the rest of your SERVER programs sorted out. </s>
<s> This could be the point of your troubles as well...having at least 1 incomplete program installed on your system. </s>
<s> I see AVAST in that log. </s>
<s> http://forum.avast.com/index.php?topic=41382.0 noted this and they issued some fix/patch. </s>
<s> Avast must have cost quite the pile of cash for WINDOWS SERVER 2008. </s>
<s> I see it's 399 US DOLLARS so here's my advice. </s>
<s> FOLLOW THE MONEY. </s>
<s> Get the folk you paid for all this to support you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I see Mcshield.exe in that dump. </s>
<s> That's McAfee, not Avast. </s>
<s> While aswFsBlk.SYS is from Avast. </s>
<s> Could it be these programs don't like each other running? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Yes I think that should be explored. </s>
<s> I started investigating the antivirus issue last night and will continue again after returning home. </s>
<s> I uninstalled Avast and will be uninstalling McAfee this evening. </s>
<s> I will then reinstall Avast and see what happens and report back. </s>
<s> If there is a lesson here it's not to put more than one antivirus on such a machine. </s>
<s> I'd still want to hear what all those folk/companies have to tell you have spending a few thousand in Server 2008, and those many hundred buck antivirus packages. </s>
<s> You are out a lot of money here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
