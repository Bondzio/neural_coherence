1.1.1	Ello , I have a solid performing computer , but I 'm not sure if 500 Watts was enough to power the computer , which surprised me at first .	St
1.1.2	Hardware : Intel E6750 2.66 clocked at 3.28 Ghz and aiming for 3.6 .	St
1.1.3	2Gb G.Skill Ram ~800 mhz clocked at 820 mhz 8800 GTS 512 OC at Core Clock : 800 , Shader Clock : 2000 , Memory Clock at 1013 500 Gb Harddrive DVD Burner Vista Ultimate 32 bit Forton 500 watt PSU I was worried because once I clocked the GPU that high , I began receiving nlvddmkm errors and recoveries .	St
1.2.1	Having a good and stable psu is a plus for any system .	St
1.2.2	When OC'ing that is n't a real problem as any added wattage is minor as the same demands pretty much stay the same .	St
1.2.3	The real concern is cooling , thus the system MUST BE COOLED to handle all the added heat output and stress placed on the system .	St
1.2.4	SO your real problem is you OC and thus address that .	St
1.2.5	Find the stable OC level you can maintain and be happy , otherwise , you will find the weakest link and it is n't necessary the psu .	St
1.2.6	Once into extreme demands , then all componets must be rated or able to handle the extra demands placed on them , to include ram , video , and cpu being they are good devices & componets you find the level it can sustain .	St
1.2.7	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.3.1	you either have heat issues ( hard to tell since the 8800gts/512 runs hot to begin with ) or you 're OC'ing beyond the capabilities of the GPU/RAM .	St
1.3.2	go back to the original settings and burn in with an hour of 3dmark06 .	Sug
1.3.3	if that passes , start twiddling with core , shader , and memory clocks .	St
