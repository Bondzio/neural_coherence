1.1.1	Hi , I have an all-in-one desktop PC and it has two HDMI ports but I called the manufacture and they said its an input ( for gaming devices etc ) I am just wondering if its possible to change and HDMI input to an output ?	Ques
1.1.2	Maybe some sort of device or extension thingie ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thank you for taking the time to read and/or respond to this .	St
1.1.4	Guesswho	St
1.2.1	I would say no such device .	St
1.2.2	What brand and model is it ?	Ques
1.3.1	If the manufacturer says , & quot ; No & quot ; , then that covers it .	St
1.3.2	It 's build that way , you ca n't change it .	St
1.3.3	You could however check if any installable cards offer that option to an empty slot and provides any support s/w if applicable .	Sug
1.3.4	The only HDMI item that even comes to mind to output is for HDMI TV setup .	St
1.3.5	Thus , if you plan to replace or upgrade the video card/port , look for HDMI as a port .	St
1.3.6	A quick google for GT-610 should provide some idea .	Sug
1.3.7	The messy way of doing this would be some USB adapter setup .	St
1.3.8	As for your current PC , the manual should readily explain what it can or ca n't do .	St
1.3.9	You did n't offer what you have , so little given to fully answer you question other than basic generic answer .	St
