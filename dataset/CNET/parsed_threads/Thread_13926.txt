<s> Hey Gang, I'm going to be building a new computer and need some advice on RAM. </s>
<s> Im not going to be using dual graphics cards, but would like to have it run decently quick. </s>
<s> And I will be doing a little video editing too. </s>
<s> Components I Will Be Using: Mobo - Abit KN9 Ultra Socket AM2 CPU - AMD Athlon 64 X2 5200+ Socket AM2 3 x 300GB Maxtor HDD DVD/RW - Pioneer 111 DVD ROM - Mitsumi Video - ATI X800 XL Audio - Sound Blaster X-Fi PSU - Antec 430 or 480 watt RAM - 2GBs Here are my 2 Questions: 1. </s>
<s> Is Dual Channel Memory MUCH better than standard DDR2 Memory? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Which Brands Do You Prefer? </s>
<s> Corsair, Kingston, Mushkin, Crucial, OCZ, Other? </s>
<s> Thank You All In Advance and Have a Happy New Year! </s>
<s> The ram makers you offered are good enough by me. </s>
<s> Understand amongest those makers, they can classify thier ram produucts as budget, hi-performance, extreme or have heat exchangers/clips included, etc. </s>
<s> Depending on your needs buy what you cab afford or desire. </s>
<s> I see no problem with the brands again as you offered. </s>
<s> As an added warning, get the best PSU you can afford as you are pushing it with a 480W, even though Antec, if you can get a 500W+, go for it as your system is stuffed. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> there's only dual channel memory architecture on motherboards where matched pairs of DDR or DDR2 RAM are used to increase the data transfer bandwith. </s>
<s> Re the best RAM ... it usually pays to start with RAM 'recommended' by the MB mfg for your MB. </s>
<s> What's it say ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> they use DDR2 also. </s>
