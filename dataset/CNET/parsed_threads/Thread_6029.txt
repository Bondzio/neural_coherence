<s> I am in the market for a new (MAC-compatible) laser color multifunction printer that can handle printing, copying, scanning and faxing for my home office. </s>
<s> Does any one have any suggestions/recommendations? </s>
<s> I'm looking at the Xerox Phaser 6110MFP/X and would love anyone's thoughts on this particular model. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I am looking for same. </s>
<s> So far, I have Xerox in the number one slot. </s>
<s> Was disappointed by Canon; as far as Mac compatibility goes, they have zilcho in Color/MFP. </s>
<s> HP doesn't even work smoothly with Windows computers at work, so I believe what I've heard about shoddy Mac drivers - haven't even looked there. </s>
<s> Brother and Ricoh I believe have quality offerings, but neither offers Postscript 3 support as does the Xerox Phaser 6180MFP. </s>
<s> (The 6110MFP doesn't have Postscript 3) www.ameiva.co.uk has cost per copy statistics, and the Xeroxes compare favorably. </s>
<s> And the Xerox brochures seem to brag about their Mac compatibility - support for Bonjour. </s>
<s> I just want to know that the scanner functions nicely with DEVONthink Pro Office? </s>
