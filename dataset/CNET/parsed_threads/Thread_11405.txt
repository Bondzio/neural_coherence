<s> I think Samsung has an 8&quot; tablet coming out soon. </s>
<s> I want to buy a tablet but have been wavering between a 7&quot; for its compact size and 10&quot; because it would be easier to read. </s>
<s> I wouldn't be doing anything serious on it - maybe surfing and photos, solitaire, emails. </s>
<s> I have an ereader now I have to have the print on medium/large so 7&quot; might be hard to read (I'm a senior). </s>
<s> I'm wondering if anyone has used both a 7&quot; and 10&quot; and if they think an 8&quot; would be a good compromise. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I'm a senior, but I can read my 7&quot; Kindle Fire just fine. </s>
<s> Just because you're a senior doesn't mean your eyes aren't any good (I did have to have cataracts removed 3 years ago). </s>
<s> I'd say that how much you're going to travel and how much it would bother you to have something take more space, not to mention cost would be factors to consider. </s>
<s> You should consider battery life. </s>
<s> Another thing is typing. </s>
<s> The onscreen keyboard on my Kindle leaves a lot to be desired, and some web sites that require sign-ons are really difficult to position so that you can get your ID and password in. </s>
<s> Personally I travel very little and will take my nice 15&quot; laptop 95% of the time over a tablet. </s>
<s> Only you can weigh how these factors stack up for you though. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> what will be it's special feature other than having today's tablets ? </s>
<s> Both are the good and everyone have a different choice its totally depend upon your personal will and choice. </s>
