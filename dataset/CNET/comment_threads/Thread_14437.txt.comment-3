I would start by removing the Linksys card from the device manager in Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Administrative Tools&gt;Computer Management&gt;Device Manager&gt;Network Adapters.
Remove both instances of the card in this area.
Reboot your computer next and let the operating system detect and set up the card.
My bet is that this will resolve your conflict.
