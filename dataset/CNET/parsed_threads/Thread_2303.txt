<s> Update the router's firmware. </s>
<s> i dunt know how to update it any tips for me to do so ? </s>
<s> I think you stated that your router is from Linksys. </s>
<s> Find the model number for your router. </s>
<s> Then, go to Linksys.com Navigate to the page for your router Download the router firmware If the downloaded firmware is a folder that is compressed, right-click on the folder and select extract. </s>
<s> Go to your router's administration page http://192.168.1.1 Click on the ''Administration'' tab Click on ''Firmware Upgrade'' tab Follow the instructions on the page. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> here is it WRT54G. </s>
<s> If the firmware and calls to support don't work, pack it up as defective. </s>
<s> Do this quickly! </s>
<s> Have you gone through enough steps to isolate the probem? </s>
<s> When you loose signal, try connecting to your routers status page and check if you have an IP. </s>
<s> You may have comm but no internet. </s>
<s> Just connecting to the router will prove that. </s>
<s> Is it a cable modem? </s>
<s> often a week signal with multiple in-house splitters can cause you to drop the signal from the ISP, often at high traffic times in your area. </s>
<s> If this is the case a digital cable-ready distribution amplifier will help immensely. </s>
<s> my ip is working fine. </s>
<s> I think its with the frimware,the main problem now is have to reconnect to the router every 10mins or so. </s>
<s> Do you think the problem is really with the router firmware? </s>
<s> I have worked with many Linksys routers including the WRT54G. </s>
<s> I strongly suggest that you upgrade the firmware if you haven't yet. </s>
<s> There currently are five versions of the WRT54G (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5). </s>
<s> You need to download the firmware for the model you have. </s>
