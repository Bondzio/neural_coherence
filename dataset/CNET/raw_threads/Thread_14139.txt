But some people suggest to take off any firewalls like on routers and I wasn't sure if my router had a firewall and if i could turn it off, so thats the only real question Im asking.

However there are some that claim that STATEFUL INSPECTION makes for a &quot;true firewall.&quot; You have to define what a firewall is before you can call it a firewall. To turn off the firewall that what every router has by nature would mean that you would not have a router... Hope this doesn't confuse you. Bob
