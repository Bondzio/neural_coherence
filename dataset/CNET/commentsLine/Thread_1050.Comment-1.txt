hey all i need some help.
at work we are trying to put 2 computers in the same room, the room has only one port, and since we are renting our space from a larger company they don't want us putting a router or anything else up that would hide a pc behind its own ip.
so i was thinking of maybe a switch or hub?
are they the same?
and do they create there own ip?
thanks lee
