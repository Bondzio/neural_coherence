I use two displays, an Apple 30&quot; cinema display and a 27&quot; display, which I use side-by-side. Recently, my 27&quot; display has been having difficulties that are reminiscent of the special effects used in the Matrix movies when the character is dodging bullets - when moving an open document or window on the 27&quot; display, it suddenly begins leaving a trail of ghost images behind that completely muck up the screen. Generally, I can correct the problem by grabbing another open document and moving it all over the screen - in effect using it to &quot;wash&quot; away all the duplicate images. I'm trying to figure out if this is a problem that can be easily corrected (perhaps a memory or cache issue) vs. some sort of fatal hardware or video card issue. I have a screenshot of this, but I'm a newbie to this forum and unsure if I can easily link it to my post. I'd be grateful for advice with this problem.

I realized that I have four video cards in this machine, so I switched that display to one of the other cards and it seemed to solve the problem. Regarding the heat sinks, I recently vacuumed out the the entire unit, but prior to doing so, it had accumulated a lot of dust. Poor maintenance might have overheated my video card prior to the recent cleaning.. Regards, Jim
