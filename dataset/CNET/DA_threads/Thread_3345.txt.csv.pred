1.1.1	I am a digital photographer with a dye based modified Epson 1280 loaded with expensive quad tone ink.	St
1.1.2	I also have a new Epson Stylus R1800 for color photo printing.	St
1.1.3	I hate to print text in business letters, web pages, web receits with these.	St
1.1.4	I want a low maintenance printer that I can use only ocassionally that won't clog up to print text with.	St
1.1.5	I want the text quality to be excellent.	St
1.1.6	Any suggestions?	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	I agree with Bob.	St
1.3.2	Overall cost per page is less, you do not need worry about nozzle clogging during periods of non-use, and for black on white, there are several for under $200.	St
1.3.3	If you do want color for printing web pages, I think the Konica-Minolta for under $400 is a good buy.	St
1.3.4	I myself use HP and Brother lasers, but I have friends who use Samsung with good results.	St
