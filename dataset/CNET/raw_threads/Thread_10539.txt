Its a packard bell imedia 1529 pc and on the web site it says it supportes dual core but im not sure which one to buy. I have used cpuz and it says its using socket 775 LGA. Do i have to get a dual core pentium with the same socket, and i think its running at 800 bus speed Meny thanks

Hoever it's unlikly to support the new Core 2 Duo as these requre a newer chipset Intel 965, 975, however the Pentium D Duel core will speed things up for you. Good luck. John

If you have other credible links that show otherwise...post it for us to see too. EVen if a newer CPU will sit/fit in the socket doesn't mean it will work as it should Again .. you're better off leaving this system as is and saving the $$ for the next system. Big box PCs usually don't promote such upgrades which often require BIOS updates to recognize and take advantage of newer CPUs. The gain ain't worth the $$ or the pain.

Suspect you'll need a BIOS update for the system to properly recognize and operate with the new CPU. If you haven't already done so...see what advice your PC mfg has regarding this. What have you got to lose, especially about the CPU, BIOS updates a new GPU and perhaps new PSU. Before you know it you'll have the equivalent of a new system. VAPCMD PS: And by all means be cautious of the advice you're receiving. Some of it comes from a poster who can't figure out what to buy for his own PC. To wit...the poster recommends a higher performance GPU but fails to point out that it's likely to necessitate buying a more robust PSU to support it. No more need be said.

Maybe you should use the new OS from Microsoft instead..Vista.. or take a chance on a Full Version of XP-Professional.. This may increase the performance that you need.. .. The Dual Core Processors start at about $$300.00.. and even cost $$1400.00 .. I would check my software for Upgrade.. Because how do you know the CPU-specs w/o the Intel CPUID Utility..which only runs on an Intel Machine.. I would think that the Mobo you have w/P4 will NOT be recognized by Intel Diagnostic software.. .. But its safe to try.. Go to: http://www.intel.com and type in the Search Engine/CPUID Utility..you will get two choices..a Windows Download..and the Linux Download.. and some MS-DOS stuff..you should not need that.. RUN the CPUID Utility.....if it recognizes your Mobo Hardware you may be able to CONTACT Intel on whats-what..I doubt that the CPUID Utility will recognize your stuff..which should &quot;stop&quot; all other thoughts.. with the RAM changes your just createing alot of work/and worry.. Either work from the Intel website or rely on your Machine Support Team..don't quess.

That is the Conroe core developed by Intel's Israeli group. Totally different architecture. Do not waste your money on the Duo Core. Two different animals.

Just keep in mind if you go the CPU route....got to make sure the PSU is up to the task. Take a look at http://www.tomshardware.com ..lots of good info on the current generation of video cards plus GPU performance comparison. The good thing about the GPU upgrade or a better PSU is you can always move them to another system if you later decide on a heftier CPU. If you go this route ...post the proposed components and we'll give you some feedback. VAPCMD

Not WAGs, not conjecture, not guesses and possibilites. The recommendations should work as anticipated when installed, not if or when a BIOS upgrade is provided by in this case a big box mfg. It's likely they're going to spend hard-earned money on your recommendation ... they deserve real working solutions. If you're not sure of an answer, look it up or skip that post. For example you 'think' the C2D is LGA 775 ? If you're not sure, again you have no business recommending it. Again, users posting here assume people answering know what they're talking about and that the answers come from first-hand knowledge or hands-on experience. Recommend you refrain from muddying the water and stick to facts.

It will run Vista too. Core 2 Duo ..is faster ... but depends on the application or game. However it would be a real crap shoot that it would work at all or as designed with all features in your system. You really should have thought this through earlier...for all you've spent plus a few $$ you could have had a new better PC suited for gaming. Re doing it yourself vice paying someone .. I vote for the latter. Better to pay a few $$ to have it done professionally than botch the job and possibly lose the CPU too. It isn't quite as simple as slapping in a GPU or RAM and it's a lot more delicate. Let us know VAPCMD

Booted but nothing happened then i notice it uses a 8 pin power connector ahhhhh.just waiting to get a converter today. Any way themotherbord is a ecs p965t-a from pc world. It supports core 2 duo (have a look at specs). And apparently crossfire but One pci x16 runs at x16 and the onerone when two card a running runs at pci x4 do you have any reason on why that is and is it still crossfire cheers chris
