Do you think that the Asus UX32A might be damaged easily?
As a clarification, I am not going to &quot;throw it around&quot; and be rough with it.
I just want to know if it is able to last as long - I am asking because it seems really thin and might be a tad flimsy.
In general, are Ultrabooks good enough to program with and research with?
Thank you all for your excellent advice!
