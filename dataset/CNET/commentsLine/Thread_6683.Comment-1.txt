i am planning to replace my cd-rw drive with a dvd-rw drive.
i have performed some minor work inside a machine such as adding memory, replacing a modem, etc.
do you think a amateur like me would have a problem with replacing this drive?
also, is there a website where i could get some detailed instructions on doing this?
another stupid question: what is &quot;firmware&quot; and why does it need to be upgraded??
