<s> This could start a war but it isn't meant to. </s>
<s> Just like automobile brands are known for their particular strengths (or weaknesses), what about hard disk drive manufacturers? </s>
<s> For example is one brand of hard drives more famous for reliability than, say, speed? </s>
<s> Is another brand better known for its speed but maybe priced too high? </s>
<s> What's the conventional wisdom of those here who have worked with and know many of the various HDD brands? </s>
<s> Remember that any retail drive is a 5 year proposal. </s>
<s> If you want best, you will not find it at retail. </s>
<s> Look to EMC, IBM, HP, SUN and even DELL for their drive array solutions. </s>
<s> Bring a suitcase of money... Bob </s>
<s> I found it. </s>
<s> The answer(s) to my question are in this very forum under the thread &quot;Hard Disk Drives: Is there a clear Leader?? </s>

<s> The conventional wisdom of the thread's 47 posts seems to say Seagate, Maxtor, and Western Digital all both terrific and crappy at the same time. </s>
<s> However, it does seem that Maxtor was rapped more than lauded. </s>
<s> Western Digital has almost equal supporters and detractors. </s>
<s> Little is said about Seagate. </s>
<s> However, if warranty is a reflection of the manufacturer's belief in its own product, then I guess Seagate must know something the others don't with its recent 5 year warranty. </s>
<s> Yes? </s>
<s> I guess it remains that &quot;you pay your money and you take your chances&quot; &lt;grin&gt;. </s>
<s> They've not been around that long to prove it but neither have the Seagates. </s>
<s> I have a mix of Seagate and WDs (plus a few surviving IBMs). </s>
<s> I use the WD Raptors as primary drives. </s>
<s> These are not yet at the capacity of the others but run at 10000 RPM and are quite perky. </s>
<s> The Seagates I pair in RAID 1 arrays to store data and as part of my backup scheme. </s>
<s> RAID 1 provides some security against HD failure. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that a warranty does not get back your data. </s>
<s> It just gives you a replacement empty drive if yours fails within the warranty period and that replacement might be a &quot;refurb&quot; unit. </s>
