<s> Hey, I am looking to build my own computer and would like to know what I can get that will make the computer quieter. </s>
<s> I am only looking to spend about $1000. </s>
<s> Please list some of the following components that are quiet: Case Fans CPU Cooler Power Supply Hard Drive (Less than 150 GB) Optical Drive (DVD Burner) And any other parts that make noise that I forgot. </s>
<s> And I know there is a weekend project from CNET listing some of these, but that is from about 2 years ago and I figured things have been updated since. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Might check out this site. </s>
