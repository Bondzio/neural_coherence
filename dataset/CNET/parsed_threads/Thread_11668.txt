<s> After getting great advice from my previous thread, I was wondering if anyone has recommendations for a monochrome laser printer for $150-200. </s>
<s> Only big requirement is two sided printing ( i think this is called autoduplexing?). </s>
<s> Would like wireless/network capability for two or three users, but not a must have. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The HP LaserJet Pro P1606DN Printer retails at about 200 bucks but I'm sure you can find it discounted. </s>
<s> It has Ethernet and not wireless. </s>
<s> Brother makes one with auto-duplexing and is wireless. </s>
<s> I don't have the model # but it runs less than the HP. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that, in the long run, it's toner that will cost your more. </s>
<s> It's still far cheaper than inkjet cartridges. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
