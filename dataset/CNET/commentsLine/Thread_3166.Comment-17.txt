insurance and piece of mind is the first order for me.
with the technology issue the computer will have gone through two evolutions of advancement.
the question is, is the computer fast enough and has enough memory (or can be expanded with additional of the correct type) to put the additional money into it.
should the answer be &quot;yes&quot;, then replace the hard drive and clone the original drive to it.
the original drive then becomes a back up drive.
be advised that in some cases microsoft will require you to contact support to register the new hard drive to the computer.
