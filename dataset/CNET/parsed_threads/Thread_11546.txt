<s> I would not go with Shuttle. </s>
<s> I haven't seen them come out with a powerful gaming sff(small form factor) pc. </s>
<s> Those games you listed are really intense and you will need alot of power. </s>
<s> I suggest you go with the Falcon Northwest Fragbox. </s>

<s> It comes with the most powerful gaming processor the FX-57, nVidia 7800GTX, 1gb of memory, 2x 160 harddrives, an LCD monitor, dual layer DVD burner, everything you will need. </s>
<s> You can also expand with more memory and there are empty PCI slots. </s>
<s> It does cost 5 grand, but it is the only sff pc out there that can handle your gaming needs. </s>
<s> You can also check out Monarch. </s>

<s> Actually not, shuttle will work. </s>
<s> You don't need top-end to do all those games, unless you need all the eye candy and high resolutions, which is useless. </s>
<s> So unless you are rich, don't buy so expensive for a sff. </s>

<s> Sorry I didn't see the fact that you can customize shuttle pcs. </s>
<s> So you can customize Shuttle to your liking giving it all the high end gear that you will need. </s>
<s> I say go with the Fragbox. </s>
<s> It gives you a monitor and a great looking case. </s>
<s> Shuttle and Monarch should suffice as well. </s>
<s> I'm kinda looking for a pc with the higher resolutions. </s>
<s> I get a good paycheck, but my apartment is small and I'm a major packrat. </s>
<s> Plus, sff pcs just look cool. </s>
<s> Which Shuttle PC? </s>
<s> They seem to have a lot of SFF Gaming PCs. </s>
<s> they have 4 models u can customize http://sys.us.shuttle.com/BuyList.aspx?id=1003&type=u i would go with the 2nd one...p2500g, as there are dual cores and u can get a 7800gt. </s>
