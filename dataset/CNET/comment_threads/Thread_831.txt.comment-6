Yeah, I pulled the pins for the front panel switch, flipped the ps on and had same behavior.
There's nothing around the pins to suggest damage.
Its a normally open contact i imagine, so if it was that switch getting &quot;stuck&quot; on, it should have behaved properly.
I still think the PS ate itself
