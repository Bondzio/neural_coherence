<s> I have a 2003 Viewsonic CRT and have recently purchased a 22&quot; LCD. </s>
<s> The problem I will describe in the next paragraph is present on both monitors but much more noticeable LCD. </s>
<s> I have tried the LCD monitor on 4 different computer (Laptops and Desktops) with different hardware and the problem present with all so I am pretty sure it is the monitor not the hardware configuration. </s>
<s> PROBLEM: When viewing text some of the letters appear redish, greenish or grayish. </s>
<s> The redish hue is very apparent in a word which contains double letters like &quot;ii&quot; or &quot;ll&quot;. </s>
<s> The smaller the font the more noticible the discolorations. </s>
<s> Since I do a lot of wordprocessing and spreadsheet work, I am considering returning the monitor. </s>
<s> Has anyone else noticed this problem with Viewsonic or any other brand of monitor? </s>
<s> I am wondering if it is just a charactertic of the Viewsonic monitors. </s>
<s> My husband uses a Sony 19&quot; LCD which has a clear crisp display regardless of how large or small the text is. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I can't really afford the cost of a Sony. </s>

<s> I do and have found some difficulty in adjusting my Viewsonic CRT for a perfect edge to edge picture when looking directly in the middle. </s>
<s> I see some color distortion toward the edges which disappears when I move or turn my head. </s>
<s> Keeping it degaussed helps but isn't perfect. </s>
<s> I do get some color distortion my laptop's LCD screen as well. </s>
<s> It also lessens depending on my viewing position. </s>
<s> I suspect glasses cause some subtle color distortion when light is refracted and the color spectrum components separate. </s>
