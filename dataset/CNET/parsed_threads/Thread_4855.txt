<s> I have a new(ish) pc it is 3 years old and i have had problems with it since day one. </s>
<s> First the PSU failed then the mobo. </s>
<s> Lastly I've had three hard disk failures. </s>
<s> This is not fun at all, currently my comp is down and i need to get it fixed. </s>
<s> My specs are: Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.13 GHz, EVGA 680i, EVGA 7950gt, 750w psu, Original HDD was 250gb seagate sata, current is 750gb seagate sata. </s>
<s> The symptoms are recurrent blue screens where it says that it is deleting physical memory. </s>
<s> Then it turns off and turns back on just to get to the windows xp screen (the one with the blue bar) and then go blue screen again. </s>
<s> I have tried to reinstall windows and that works for a verry short time. </s>
<s> Then the blue screen comes back except this time it turns back on and the blue bar just keeps going across the screen. </s>
<s> Finally i shut it off and when it turns back on it doesn't even go to the windows screen cause it goes to the one where &quot;windows encountered an error and the start with safe mode (with or with out networking) pops up. </s>
<s> Lastly it does nothing and i turn it off till i can get a new hdd. </s>
<s> Thank you for all your help. </s>

<s> Have you looked for this? </s>
<s> It's difficult to say what to do from here. </s>
<s> I would check for simple things such as loose wires and bad capacitors, especially on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Also, make sure that everything is seated properly on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Next, consider where your computer is located: is it in a desk or a very warm room (or both)? </s>
<s> Computers don't like heat! </s>
<s> Also, make sure it is physically clean internally and stays clean. </s>
<s> In addition, ensure that it is away from any high powered devices (microwaves, tube tv's etc). </s>
<s> If all of this has already been done and it checks out ok, it's hard to say what is causing the issue! </s>
<s> I hope this helps. </s>
<s> Dependin on the age of the hard drive, you might want to check the following: http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=207951 Seagate had a problem with the firmware on some of it's HDD models. </s>
