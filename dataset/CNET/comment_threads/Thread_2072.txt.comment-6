I'm a little confused on the query you wanted me to look into 'HOW TO INSTALL XP TO A SATA DRIVE' because I already have XP on my RAID 0 array of 2x60GB drives.
This query is giving me information on how to install the RAID controllers so XP recognizes it for a new partition installation.
And also for just 1 or 2 drives.
My case is 3 drives.
In case you misunderstood my first post: My RAID 0 works fine but my 3rd SATA HDD hookup (the 500gb seagate) won't be recognized.
If I enable 'full mode' for the S-ATA config in BIOS (and how would I do that?
for the ports definition my other option is P0-2nd/P1-1st) how would I go about making XP recognize the drives?
If I install vista would this all go away or is it the same problem?
Thanks for your help, we're almost there but I'm still a bit stuck
