I seemingly lost four external hard drives within hours of eachother. For simplicity, will limit the scenario to two for the moment: Lacie #1 and Lacie #2. Initial Event: Lacie #1 External: I accidently used a different power supply adapter when trying to start Lacie #1 External. The one I used had slightly different amp output. Stupid mistake... The Lacie #1 External power light flickered for just a moment, then went out. The drive never spun up, nor made a sound. Result: Lacie #1 External would not turn on. *** I had an identical Lacie external - Lacie #2 - so I thought I might try using that to recover data from the failed Lacie #1 drive. *** Secondary Event: Lacie #2 External I tested Lacie #2 external with proper power adapter. It powered up normally. so I removed the hard drive from Lacie #1 housing and installed it into Lacie #2 housing. Then I tested Lacie #2 external with proper power adapter. Lacie #2 light flickered, then went out. Why? I assumed it failed to read drive #1, which must be corrupted. so Removed hard drive #1 from Lacie #2 housing, and reinstalled drive #2 into it's original Lacie #2 housing. Tested Lacie #2 again, with proper power adapter. Now Lacie #2 would not power up at all, where it just worked fine two steps ago. Final Result: Lacie #2 failure. What happened here? I understand how the initial event for Lacie #1 could cause failure in both drive #1 and/or the Lacie housing #1. But how could that lead to the second event failure in Lacie #2? Is it possible that the bad drive from #1 somehow corrupted the Lacie #2 housing power? How is that possible? And since drive #2 was outside of it's housing when the failure occurred in Lacie #2, does that mean drive #2 is most likely healthy? Any advice is much appreciated.

At this point, it does not seem to respond to power, period. So I am buying a used drive - same model, same firmware - and going to try and swap that logic board onto my Lacie #1 drive. Question though... what should I hook it up to from there? Can I simply plug the drive into an ATA Ultra compatible PC, and let the computer try to recognizie it? Because it was a standalone drive in the LaCie, is there any kind of boot/partitions configurations on the drive for the LaCie, that might cause the PC to not recognize it? This is beyond my pay grade, but I want to give it a shot, and save the $$$ of having some recovery firm do the work. Thank you!

14026	4	380427	3233897	3233700	burndawgz	1/28/10 7:48 AM	1.26466488E12	End game	Thanks Bob. Stayed up late last night and worked it out. Here's what most likely happened. 1. When powering on Lacie #1 with the the bad adapter, it instantly fried BOTH the #1 housing logic board as well as the installed #1 hard drive logic board. 2. When I swapped in bad #1 drive into Lacie #2 housing, and tried to power it up, the bad drive somehow fed-back it's power failure into the Lacie #2 logic board, frying it as well. (I still don't understand why this was the case - why didn't it just fail to read the bad drive. Talkin bout a widow-maker) For anyone counting, that's 3 logic boards down. 3. My hunch was correct about drive #2 being healthy. It was out of the housing when Lacie #2 housing fried. When I reinstalled #2 drive back into the #2 housing, the housing logic board was dead, so could not pass on any further failures to the #2 drive. 4. In answer to my own question about how to get a PC/WXP box to read the former Lacie #2 ATA drive, all I had to do was remove a jumper on the drive, making it a slave drive. Once I did that, my PC read the disc 100%, with all the old Lacie formatting, partitions, etc. 5. As previously posted, my drive #1 was not running when it fried, it just failed to power-up, so I was almost certain all my data, physical disc, and heads were healthy. It was just the power. I stumbled upon a great website: http://www.deadharddrive.com/ - can swapping logic boards be that easy? - and just so happens I had a Torx socket sitting in my mini computer kit, unused for the last 20 years - so I popped off the healthy #2 drive logic board and installed it on the #1 drive, plugged that into my PC/WXP box and... WOOHOO - there's all my 320gb of data. I had recovered my own hard drive! The local data recovery shakedown joint was ready to charge me over a grand per drive (I'm sure they would have too, despite it actually being an easy fix, especially for experts in the field, this would have been nothing.) 6. I found a matching model/firmware drive on Ebay cheap - sectors are bad - but all I need from it is the healthy logic board - so I will swap that in for the burnt out board on drive #1. Recall, I actually had four total drives go down, so still have to find another cheap matching logic board for drive #3. 7. That leaves me sitting with four worthless LaCie housing shells, all apparently with burt out logic boards of their own. Plus I have to find permanent, networked new housing for the four hard drives. I don't want a whole new PC just for that. What to buy???

Any old PC can be a server. Upside - Many are free. Downside - All of them seem to draw 100 Watts. 2. A simple server like http://www.iogear.com/product/GMFPSU22W6/ Upside - Found for 25 bucks. Downside - Not too speedy. Lesson - Not a single small NAS is what I call fast. The issue is the link. It's all of 100 megabit, usb 2 is 480 and sata is 1500 megabit. 3. Next up. A netbook. Walmart has a 228 buck netbook. Might be the cure to item 1. Bob

This would be more for long-term storage rather than speedy serve-backs. Soooooo, I could live with those slower speeds. I actually have a new (unpacked) HP EX495 - intended to be used as a media server for music, video, etc to my networked home devices. I quickly glanced at the manual last night - says it wants to reformat any new drive to become part of the server. Will it really not let me add a pre-formatted drive with content? I should take a second look. 3. Netbook - I'm confused. How will my four raw drives fit into that housing? Are you suggesting I buy new individual/external housing for the drives, and cable them in via USB/FW?

Upside - Cheap 1.5GB USB drive. Downside - A little noisy. Bob

All four existing disks are stuffed full of content, and if possible, I want them to stay that way... Reformatting into an JBOD RAID or other array is not mandatory with that hardware is it? I will take a closer look. Appreciate the tips Bob! J.

Have a $25 NewEgg gift card burning a whole in my pocket however, so will try out the Eagle branded version. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817193040&cm_re=3.5_external_disk_enclosure-_-17-193-040-_-Product

The drive arrived with almost zero documentation and in the dual drive, two drive letters show up mode. Since I wanted it to be a clone of another 1.5TB drive (for cheap) this is why I moved the jumper. Now I'm back to the my 3 copies to achieve some reliable backup system. Bob

14026	12	380427	3234040	3234047	R. Proffitt	1/28/10 10:55 AM	1.2646761E12	Mine is not very old.	So I can't speak about longevity. It runs about 2 hours when I sync the systems and then it's back to the storage bin for safety. I read the newegg review and since I'm handy with drill presses, wires, solder and more I think it is fixable. Or like one wrote they leave the cover off.
