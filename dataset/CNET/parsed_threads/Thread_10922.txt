<s> Hello Everyone, I am in need of a new software to connect to the internet wirelessly. </s>
<s> I currently have a waveplus wp 1200 802.11b wireless pcmcia card on the laptop. </s>
<s> It came with the Quetec connection software(quetec.ca). </s>
<s> Unfortunately I believe either the software or hardware is bad, maybe both. </s>
<s> The thing connected for a brief few seconds got lost it completely afterwards, the program sometimes can detect wireless networks and says that it connects to them but no browsing or pinging is able. </s>
<s> Anybody know of a program that is preferrably free that I can use with my adapter to connect to wireless networks(windows ME)? </s>
<s> If drivers, support, then head to http://www.quetec.ca/ BUT I see no mention of YOUR WIFI ROUTER. </s>
<s> Some do buy such cards but think they don't need to provide the access. </s>

<s> My router is a wrt54g linksys router. </s>
<s> It recognized my laptop because and is in the dhcp active ip table and was connected for a brief few seconds, pulled up google and yahoo, but lost it. </s>
<s> But my initial thoughts are... 1. </s>
<s> No mention of the gritty details. </s>
<s> Make/model laptop and most important, who installed that OS. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> Most will install the OS but laptop drivers are not something Microsoft will install. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If the product is defective. </s>
<s> Return it. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Try Linux. </s>
<s> Use google.com and see if DSL (Damn Small Linux) can use that card. </s>

<s> Dell Inspiron 5000e. </s>
<s> The os came with the laptop from store(don't know where, was my a friends laptop). </s>
<s> Quetecs support is nil. </s>
<s> Their website doesn't even work. </s>
<s> I don't think it works with linux/unix. </s>
<s> For compatibility the cards requirements said only windows versions. </s>
<s> You don't know how the OS was installed. </s>
<s> That's alright. </s>
<s> Now you can dig around Dell's site for all the drivers. </s>
<s> A clean install of the OS and Dell's drivers might fix this. </s>
<s> Before all that. </s>
<s> Go to some free hotspot and try again. </s>
