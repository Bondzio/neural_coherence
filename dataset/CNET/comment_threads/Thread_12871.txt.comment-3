If there is no other way to fix the problem you could use the system restore utility included in XP to restore the computer to a point before the updates were installed.
A restore point should have been created when the updates were installed if it is enabled.
This would eliminate the need to reformat or reinstall XP.
Re-installing IE 6 SP1 may also be an optoin.
