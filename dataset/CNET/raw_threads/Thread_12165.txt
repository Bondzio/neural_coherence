I have a laptop, and I'm just beginning to realize how inconvenient having only a touchpad is. I need a mouse. I see all these mice, great scores, by the reviews very comfortable, precise, etc. Then I see notebook mice. These never get as high a rating as the 'regular' mice and are usually said to be less ergonomic than full-size. I use my laptop a lot, and I would like to be as comfortable as possible. Can I get a full-size, regular mouse like the Logitech MX1000 or do I have to buy a mouse that has the word 'notebook' in the product name? Thanks.

They are usually simpler, slightly smaller, and ''fold up.'' That is, the cord will fit into an internal chanber, the wireless adapter will slide in and out of a slot, etc, making it easy to carry with you. However, if portability isn't an issue, and comfort and functionality/abilities are, you can use any other mouse on the market, including the MX1000. Hope this helps, John

It is smaller than a standard mouse, but not so tiny as to make its use difficult -- a problem I have had with some notebook mice. The USB receiver stores in the base of the mouse making a compact unit for storage, and it turns off the mouse so you won't deplete the battery. Hope this helps Frank

I think its the best mouse you can buy. It's a laser mouse, great features, and is wireless (and is as reponsive as a wired mouse). Just check it out and read the reviews. I'm giving them a Christmas presents...

I remove the battery and warm it in my palm . . . sometimes this makes a difference. Batteries are new from the store and am at my witts ends with yet another MS product that should still be maybe in beta!! Many thanks
