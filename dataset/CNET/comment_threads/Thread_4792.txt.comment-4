Sorry you just stepped over a line where you don't find a solution.
If I can install, I can copy.
Thanks for clearing up with an example.
There is no such tool today.
And very little call for it.
Yes you can cite Microsoft's &quot;Activation&quot; but are you ready to write such a thing?
The cost seems more than a copy of Adobe.
