<s> Run TWEAKUI and see if any drive letters are hidden. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> TweakUI shows no drive is hidden. </s>
<s> Also if the drive is hidden by windows, then why did my old CD-Rom drive worked? </s>
<s> So far you've only noted EXPLORER is hiding it. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> If you think it's E:, put in a CD with data on it and open the command prompt.... </s>
<s> Type DIR E: press enter and tell what happens. </s>
<s> Try D:, F: etc... Bob </s>
<s> Any softwares that access the drive with a letter won't see it. </s>
<s> DVD Shrink, etc.... Only Nero can. </s>
<s> Nero access the drive directly. </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> As it stands I can't tell if you tried the DOS commands. </s>
<s> Many will not do this since they are fearful of the command line. </s>
<s> As such, you get to take it to the repair shop. </s>
