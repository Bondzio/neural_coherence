i have a linksys wrt54g wireless router which also has 4 ports to support wired systems.
i use dhcp to give each system a unique address within the net.
if i connect one of those ports to my whole-house wiring, can any computer in the house that is connected to the wiring share that port?
will they still each get a unique address?
