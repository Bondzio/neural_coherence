I recently bougth this DVD/RW, but the problem is that I can't hear the sound of some DVDs, for instance I got the VH1 Divas Live 1998, and it comes with 2 music tracks, I can hear one of then but the other one is mute, the tracks are (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), (Dolby Digital 5.1). Why can I hear just one of them? What should I do in order to hear both tracks?

Also, when you open a new post, you are prompted for the following: Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. You have given none of this information, and you have apparently ignored an attempt to help you.

But I'll inlcude this kind of information every other time that I need some advice or help. Thank you both guys, for your time, for your advices. This community rocks, computer science rocks, the Internet rocks. Thx. Michael Borbor Snchez
