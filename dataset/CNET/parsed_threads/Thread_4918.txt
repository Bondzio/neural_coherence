<s> Everytime I try to open a file on my HP Tablet I get a message that says ''cannot open MIME type&quot; HP says they have no fix for this problem does anyone have suggestions? </s>
<s> All files? </s>
<s> Or only one? </s>
<s> If only one, what kind of file is it? </s>
<s> For example, to open a Quicktime Movie, you need Apples quicktime. </s>
<s> To open a Microsoft Project file, you need Microsoft project. </s>
<s> So it can very well be that you don't have the right program installed on your tablet to open this type of files. </s>
<s> But you didn't provide the details. </s>

<s> http://www.freeware-palm.com/download-palmpdf-1-3a.html says it has a free one that works on WebOS. </s>
<s> I can't confirm that because I don't have a WebOS machine. </s>
