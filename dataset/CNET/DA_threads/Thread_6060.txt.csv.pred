1.1.1	Hey guys thanks for looking in on this I need some help trying to power some cold cathode neon lights via an AC wall outlet and unfortunately power currents/transformation is not my expertise!	St
1.1.2	I'm trying to power several of these: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16800888072 with a regular old wall socket (I'm using them to outline a DJ booth if you're curious).	St
1.1.3	That product includes the option to plug a SECOND tube into the same sound-activation module that is included with the kit.	St
1.1.4	That module is then powered by a 12v molex 4-pin which has a 2nd 4-pin connector to daisy chain it to more neons I'm assuming.	St
1.1.5	I've looked into this a bit and have several questions.	St
1.1.6	Would it be best to use a $15 adapter such as this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812123309&cm_re=ac_12v-_-12-123-309-_-Product And considering that I could daisy multiple modules together, would one adapter be enough to power a few modules (with each module possibly powering 2 neons for up to 8 neons total)?	St
1.1.7	Or would I need to use one adapter per sound module (one adapter per 2x neons)?	St
1.1.8	The second option would be to use an ATX power supply unit.	St
1.1.9	I've heard that they need to be &quot;loaded&quot; as in connected to a motherboard to actually turn on.	St
1.1.10	I've also heard that you can &quot;short&quot; that specific connector to get it to turn on w/o a mobo.	St
1.1.11	I would really appreciate it if anyone could explain this a little more clearly to me.	Sug
1.1.12	I'm familiar with soldering wires but that's about as extensive as my electrical circuitry knowledge goes =/ Thanks for looking and any help!	St
1.2.1	Each light unit draws 700ma, and 8 units will draw 5.6 Amp.	St
1.2.2	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817822006ATX PSU pinout http://pinouts.ru/Power/atxpower_pinout.shtml Assembly at your risk.	St
