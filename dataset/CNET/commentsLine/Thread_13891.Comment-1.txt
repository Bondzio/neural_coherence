i have been a user of superduper!
for some time and understand the process of making a bootable clone of my startup drive.
the other day, my bootable backup drive crashed.
it was an iomega that had been partitioned and worked fine as a bootable backup until the drive itself failed.
the iomega was a firewire 400 drive.
when i bought a replacement, i bought a western digital fw 800/400, usb 2, esata connection system.
1 tb.
i partitioned it and created a bootable clone with the latest version of superduper!
the operation went smoothly until i tried to actually boot from the newly created clone.
i could select the clone from the startup disk panel, but my mac refuses to boot from it.
it looks, then says, &quot;hmmm!
i think i'll start up from the internal drive.&quot; i have another wd fw 400, usb 2.0 drive and it is bootable as well as a lacie fw 400 that i can make bootable.
only this one drive that has no specific fw 400 port will not boot.
i tried it as fw 800, no dice.
i connected with the adapter cable to the fw 400 port, no joy.
i can return this wd drive for exchange.
my question is should i expect the same results if i exchange it for another drive of the same type?
or is there a chance that a new drive of the same type will work?
powermac, dual g5 2 ghz, os x 10.4.11. it has a fw 800 port as well as fw 400. thanks for any advice you can offer.
