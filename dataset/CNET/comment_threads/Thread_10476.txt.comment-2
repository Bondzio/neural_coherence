I don't know if the Backup feature of this drive actually works with OS X, it may do but I did not find anything definitive about it on their website.
As it works with Windows and Mac OS, I have a feeling that this drive is formatted in FAT or FAT32.
This allows it to work, out of the box, on almost any machine.
It is, however, a notoriously fickle and unstable format for your data.
You would be well advised to format this drive in HFS+ (Journaled) for your data's security.
You can do this via Disk Utility.
