<s> Hi there, (system: xp home, 500MHz memory, 10 gig hard drive) I know, there must somewhere be, the details of the process of copying everything from old(5 years) small Hard drive drive to a new WD ide (160 Gig)hard drive, so that the old drive could be used as a second (slave) hard drive. </s>
<s> I have not succeeded in finding it. </s>
<s> Is it, at all, possible to copy without the special software? </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> And the caveat is this. </s>
<s> Since you noted &quot;XP&quot; you must keep the boot partition under 127GB in size. </s>
<s> I will NOT duplicate why this is but offer this link -&gt; http://www.48bitlba.com Next it's a snap to clone your 10GB to the new drive with the free software that comes with your drive, downloaded from your drives maker or even G4U copydisk (see google.) </s>
<s> &quot;Is it, at all, possible to copy without the special software?&quot; The software I noted so far is not special. </s>

<s> Thank you, both of you, for your quick and succinct advice. </s>
<s> For WD1600JB HD 160GB. </s>
<s> I have downloaded the dlgsetup 11- win.zip (that is being padentic and uninformed)although the WD advises, &quot;if you want to copy all the contents of the boot disc, that is precisely what I want to do,&quot; use DOS version of Data. </s>
<s> Should I use that instead? </s>
<s> I would not know the results of the exercise until after the Xmas holidays. </s>
<s> The product is a Xmas present for my grandson. </s>
<s> Thank for your help. </s>
