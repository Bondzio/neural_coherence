yes.
here's why.
if it's windows xp, the activation alone will try to activate again plus minor hardware differences will cause the drive and the os to not boot.
why not move your stuff over with your backup?
you do backup, don't you?
bob ps.
another nifty thing is that xp has a nasty habit of rewriting the partition table on a drive you add to some system.
i've seen and read posts here where people panic when they put the drive back and the slave on that system vanishes (along with the data they didn't backup.)
