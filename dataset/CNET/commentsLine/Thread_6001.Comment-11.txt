no crashes yesterday!
yay!
my fresh start this morning produced no errors.
however, after about an hour microsoft gave me updates, and i restarted.
got the following errors: configuring the page file for crash dump failed.
make sure there is a page file on the boot partition and that is large enough to contain all physical memory.
the eplpdx02 service could not be started.
dcom got error &quot;the service database is locked.
&quot; attempting to start the service netman with arguments &quot;&quot; in order to run the server: {ba126ae5-2166-11d1-b1d0-00805fc1270e} dcom got error &quot;the service database is locked.
&quot; attempting to start the service ipod service with arguments &quot;&quot; in order to run the server: {063d34a4-bf84-4b8d-b699-e8ca06504dde} and actually two of the last three are driver errors that i get intermittently (dont' know what netman is).
although i've followed directions to try to get rid of them, i've had no luck.
i have the computer open and still getting the ftdisk error this morning - but it could be heat related.
thankfully, no crashes since i opened the box, even though i've deliberately not held myself back from opening programs as i need them.
if there is one silver lining, increasing the virtual memory has erased the problem i had with photoshop and page maker being finicky to use at the same time.
any ideas about the error messages being related or not?
many thanks.
