i am a firm believer and proponent of a &quot;solid state&quot; (if i can use the term loosely) storage standard.
currently i don't believe flash memory manufacturers have reached the developmental level required to compete with mainstream hard drives.
mostly because of the relatively low storage amount and limited write life span.
perhaps we might see flash hard drives on high abuse laptops soon in the future, ie: military, heavy travelers, etc.
i think we have a better chance of seeing movies, music and other data on flash cards in the near future.
i'll be the first in line for a reasonably priced flash storage solution that wont scratch, can fit in my pocket, and comes with a cool little plastic carrying case.
