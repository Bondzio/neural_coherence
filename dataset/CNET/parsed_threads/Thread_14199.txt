<s> I had heard that Dells customer service/tech support had a lot to be desired. </s>
<s> Well I found that out first hand, needless to say I still dont know what brand, make or model the motherboard is. </s>
<s> Does anybody know who makes Dells boards and how I can find out which board I have. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Should be the 925X chipset, but not sure mobo manufacturer. </s>
<s> Install a new pci-express gfx card. </s>

<s> Whoever Dell choses. </s>
<s> Keep in mind the Dell's are NOT a standard ATX MB so you are &quot;stuck&quot; with it. </s>
<s> And your only going to find out what Dell wants you to know. </s>
<s> But you can do video cards, hard drives and memory upgades. </s>

<s> I think Intel makes Dell's mobos but it's not standard ATX so your stuck with it. </s>
