i have a 233 pentium with 256m of ram that i had windows me on and it was so slow that you started doing something and had to walk away for a while and do something else.
i just use it for extra network drive space, so speed isn't really an issue for me.
try windows 98 or, better yet, windows 2000. i loaded w2000 and am amazed how much faster it is.
linux is another option.
it'll still be slow but at least it'll be useful.
if you're doing much more than internet surfing or word processing, i'd have to recommend a new pc
