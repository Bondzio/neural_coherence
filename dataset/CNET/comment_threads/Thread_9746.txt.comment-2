&quot;VGA &gt; vga to dvi adapter &gt; DVI any advantage ?&quot; None at all unless that's what is needed to connect the monitor you have.
Why?
The adapter is just wires to send the signal to the proper pins.
&quot;Is there bigger advantage if i get a new vid card with dvi out?
Currently my machine has onboard Radeon X300/X550 series.&quot; I want to lump these two questions into one.
Almost any video card can outperform onboard video.
So there is an advantage there.
