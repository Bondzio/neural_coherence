<s> Hi I'm looking to set up a network drive for my small business at home .I now have 3 PC's and am using a Netgear router but need to access information using all three. </s>
<s> Two PC's run Win 7 and one Win 8. </s>
<s> I want to know a good network drive to use (not too pricey) and how to set it up. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help </s>
<s> My wndr3800 was a snap to set up. </s>
<s> I took a small (?) </s>
<s> USB 2.0 500GB drive and put it on the router. </s>
<s> I was done and for not much. </s>
<s> Of course you would have a few other copies of what's there for the usual reasons. </s>
