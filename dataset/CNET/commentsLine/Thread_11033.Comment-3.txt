your dell model, appears to have a common problem.
usually, it boils down to a bad mtrbd.
or in some way its not up to par.
since, you've tested the psu elsewhere, that pretty much leaves the mtrbd.. though, i would reduce the system to a minimum setup and check results.
if it still fails, replace the mtrbd.
or if any warranty use it.
if none, inspect the mtrbd.
for &quot;bad caps&quot; google for pix on such for examples.
also, remove all drives(unplug) and check results.
other users have reported similar &quot;amber status&quot;, as you've explained.
most, have been ref4erred to a bad mtrbd.
at fault(usually).
as a minimum setup can you see the bios display then?
