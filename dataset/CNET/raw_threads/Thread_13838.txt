11587	0	108133	1232324	NR	locus	6/8/05 3:29 PM	1.11824454E12	Monitor for Gaming	I need a monitor that can stand up to the rigors of gaming but I will also be using it for everyday computer use as well. I would like an LCD but I am open to a CRT. I have around $300 - $400 to spend. Somewhat flexible but that is my preferred range. I am going to buy in the next couple of days and am not very knowledgeable monitor wise. The card I have is the Nvidia 6800GT. Was thinking 17 inch would be the best size option when considering price and quality. Please, let me know your opinions.

You can usually get a generic 17 inch LCD for $200 to $300. The problem with larger CRTs is they have huge pixle size, it's like looking at a TV up close...

Since CRT monitors are desinged for close viewing they have a small picth .026 or less. much much smaller than a TV. Of all the display types CRTs are the oldest amd most reliable. LCDs can have bad pixils, the back lamps can fade/get dim, or just burn out. Also there is the speed of LCD or how fast it will respond to changes, this is measured in milli-seconds, the faster the better, this is important for games. They can be fragle, something can puncture the front of the screen and the liquid will leak out. You do have to carefull cleaning them. The big advanage of LCDs is in size and weight, they clearly win here. Yes get 19&quot;, good for watching DVDs. John

My main reason for using LCD's was that I heard it doesn't strain the eyes as much, but if the refresh rate is good on a CRT, it won't strain the eyes either, so I am looking for good CRT's now. what is a good dot pitch for a CRT?
11587	7	108133	1234174	1234045	ozos	6/9/05 5:31 PM	1.11833826E12	Flat is what you want	the dot pitch affects the flat-ness, not the refresh you can have a rounded CRT and have a good refresh rate but i'd suggest around .24MM (0.024MM would be sick, and cost like millions, if it were even possible)
11587	8	108133	1234541	1233743	dagger906	6/9/05 9:51 PM	1.11835386E12	LCD	LCD is better in just about every way, that is, other than cost. But still, at around $250 for 17 inches, it's somewhat affordable... A lot of people suggest that LCD is less reliable, which is not true. You just won't notice a few pixles go black, which amost never happen. CRT monitors, on the other hand, can break down completely. Have you ever had a CRT montior suddenly changing color tone, because one of the 3 color scanners stop functioning? I have, and it's to be expected. LCD creates less heat, uses less power, and has no moving parts (so to speak). It's only natural that it's more reliable. LCD is also a lot easier on the eyes. Besides creating much more UV, CRT monitors flicker. Just because you set the refresh rate higher than your eyes can follow, doesn't mean it stops flickering. The flicker is still there, and it hurts your eyes without you knowing it.

CRT definately emitt more UV, and UV definately hurt your eyes. Flicker, at any refresh rate, hurt your eyes. CRT always flicker. You don't punch your monitor for no reason, and saying LCD can be broken easier that way just doesn't make sense! o_O And finally, who would pay $300 for a CRT? Jeez! -_-

CRT does produce more UV than LCD, and UV does hurt your eye, so what's wrong with that? As for CRT looks better, that's just individual opinion. They just look a bit different. Some people are used to CRT, and don't like change. In any case, CRT flicker, no matter you notice it or not. Even flickers that you don't notice still hurt your eyes.

UV hurts your eyes, but your eyes heal aside the fact that professional graphics design is still done on CRT (ever see a &quot;Professional Color System LCD&quot; ??? no, want to know what all the high end graphics desingers use? CRT's costing between $250-$1700 (yes, there are $1700 CRT's, it's a Sony, it's one of the top 5 best monitors in the WORLD)) LCD's are only good as a gimmick and as a &quot;i'm so advanced I have everything LCD, aren't I cool&quot; statment LCD's are excellent in smaller devices, such as mp3 players, portable TV's, watches and PDA's but for computing the CRT is the only way to go also, i'm not saying that you should punch your monitor i'm saying if your a gamer, there is a good chance you'll goto a lan party thank you i'd prefer a monitor i can wipe off with a paper towel when something gets spileld on it, or a monitor that doesn't go down when bumped with an LCD, you spill something on the screen, it's basically done i'm not saying people aren't switching from LCD to CRT but you want to know why your statistics work? what monitor does Dell give away for free with the purchase of a computer? their 14&quot; LCD yes, Dell affects statistics that much (in graphics, Intel is actually the market leader, by volume, and Dell has stated many times that they cannot use AMD due to AMD's lower capacity (2 fabs vs Intel's 20+)) CRT is the choice for a serious gamer LCD's are fine if your needing a space saving solution/like blatantly wasting money but let's consider my pair of 17&quot; Flat CRT monitors cost in total $450 for the pair (one was $300, but it's not worth near that, so call it $140, along with the other one (Which is nearly identical) so let's say $280 for the pair that'd get you 1 comparable LCD or 2 lesser LCD's that still couldn't support the resolution that these things are using...all for what? a saved 6&quot; of desk space? well, considering that most desks have a keyboard tray most of those trays can take a mouse and most desks that don't are often deep (and most people don't use 2 monitors like me :D) you aren't really giong to benefit having an LCD your just gonna have this huge void where clutter will build...and it's going to be a lesser monitor...unless you spend $250 for it...which is outrageous and lots of people buy $200-$400 CRT's people like: gamers graphic artists web designers home users business workers coders and many many more people the higher image quality is more of a common view, than an opinion the CRT is the superior gaming monitor LCD's are more of a space saving system for example, in an RV or boat an LCD TV would be excellent, as it saves space in a cramped enviroment yet in a house/apartment it's not going to matter much, as the desk is taking the same ammount of space either way...

None have given me any trouble even in high end games like Doom3, Half-Life2, Far Cry, Riddick, Medal of Honor & Call of Duty series, etc..... From everything I have read in other game orientated sites and forums, gamers have traditionally favored CRT montors over LCD, many claiming that unless a LCD is a high dollor one, it just cannot keep up with the fast action of some games. If you do gaming along with everyday computer use and desire an LCD I would suggest you get one with a low ''ms'' (Response Time) at around 8ms (don't think anyone has mentioned that in this thread). Samsung has a nice 19'' model 715n with 8ms & 700:1 Contrast Ratio at Newegg for $312.99 Retail after a $20 mail-in rebate. http://tinyurl.com/8zrc3 The ViewSonic 19'' VX924 has a 4ms for $469: http://www.newegg.com/ProductSort/Category.asp?Category=19 Check around other stores locally also for low 'ms' LCD's and low prices.

There is just no way you can tell any kind of lag in monitor refresh rate. Graphics heavy games usually run at 30-40 fps on average systems. Compare that with monitor refresh rate. As the colors... You've got to be kidding me! These people are nuts! How can you tell the subtle difference between a few million colors!? -_-

Yes the newer ones are not as bad, but if you read some of the details at toms and anand's the faster use 6 bit rather than 8 bit and are not as good on color as the the slower ones. I'm colorblind but I ca read. In all honesty you seem to have never read anything at the gamers sites.

Now as for CRTs the first computer I worked on with a CRT was in the early 1970's so they have been used as monitors for a long, long time. The one thing about CRTs is X-rays if the high voltage on the CRT is over 25,000 volts it can generate X-rays. Now most computer CRT onlt are in the 12,000 range so you safe. And they use leaded glass on some to be safe. Since you keep talking about UV, lets see now LCD monitors are lighted by cold cathode floresent lamps and floresent lamps DO PRODUCE UV rays. Enjoy your LCD. John
