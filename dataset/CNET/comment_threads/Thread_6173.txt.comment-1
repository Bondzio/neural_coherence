While removing front of Compaq Presario to get CD rom out to put in a newer box, plug from off-on button pulled loose before I had the sense to unplug it by hand.
Don't know where to plug it back in.
Is it on the motherboard?
Does it mate with another plug?
On the power supply?
There's only enough wire length to reach about 1/3 of the way into the box, but I have only found places with not enough pins.
Can someone describe right where it connects?
