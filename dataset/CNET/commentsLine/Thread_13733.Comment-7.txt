1) if you stick with common timings (ddr2-800, 4-4-4-15), all four sticks should be able to run at those timings.
you get into the cas 3's then it's doubtful because that's really pusing things to their limit and way past the official spec.
there are some ddr2-800 dimms with 1t (example:  ).

those are oc levels that the manufacturer says are possible and will support (you can call tech support).
