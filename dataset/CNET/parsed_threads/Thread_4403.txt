<s> Bought mom an ipad and have been playing at home for two weeks on the device. </s>
<s> I'm ready to get mom an ISP set up at her home. </s>
<s> Since the ipad is the only device she will have, my thoughts were to get the cheapest service (DSL) a wireless modem and be done with it. </s>
<s> Because she only has an ipad device and no computer, I am limited to the most basic of connectivity devices. </s>
<s> I was looking at the Cisco Valet....but frankly...not sure from the website if the usb doodad has to dangle from the ipad. </s>
<s> That would be a non-starter. </s>
<s> Any suggestions for a single device connectivity set up? </s>
<s> Also, I have left a more technical request under the wireless forum related to wifi signals and hearing aid interference. </s>
<s> I have a horrible feeling I may have jumped the gun buying the basic device and not waiting for 3G. </s>
<s> I have my own issues with my iphone service and AT&T...so felt it best to get DSL separately. </s>
<s> Any thoughts, suggestions and feedback are welcome! </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>

<s> Hi GG. </s>
<s> Being into tech myself and a girl i really appreciated your post. </s>
<s> The simplest way to connect would be to get her a wireless router type system from a landline for connectivity without having the ISP connector dangling. </s>
<s> Once you are up and going, i would suggest DISH Network service for her as well. </s>
<s> I work at DISH Network and they have live-streaming content that she can choose to watch wherever she goes. </s>
<s> Your mom would also be able to be part of DISH Network's lowest digital pricing. </s>
<s> Let me know if you have questions about DISH Network. </s>
<s> There are a lot of TV providers like Comcast attempting to catch up to DISH's TV EVERYWHERE. </s>
<s> Nancy </s>
<s> Dish network!?!?! </s>
<s> And yes I have been with Dish for about 10-12 years, happy with them, there are good for tv but not broadband. </s>
<s> 1st have you done the 4.2 update for the iPad? </s>
<s> You do not need a dongle, it has built-in WiFi!!! </s>
<s> One you need a modem 1st, it is different then a router, I use a SpeedStream 5360, then you need a router; phone line too modem too (using cat5/6 cable) router. </s>
<s> d-link & Linksys/Cisco are the top routers. </s>
<s> You will also need a in-line filter for each phone in the house, about $5 each. </s>
<s> How big is her place? </s>
<s> That will determine what router you get, some have short range some much more. </s>
<s> Like mine I have extending 12&quot; dual antennas on my Linksys/Cisco router (few have that option) because I have 1/3 acre & also sometimes have to take me computer or iPad to the next-door neighbors, I have about a 500ft+ range with my router (WRT54GL) & run it open WiFi with no security set up like WEP/WPA on the router, it is useless to someone that knows how to crack them, safest to change the ADMI password something weird. </s>
<s> OK for DLS, I have the mid range AT&T package but because of how DLS works I only get .5mbps, when I first got it, no one on the street had DLS so I was getting the full 1.5mbps. </s>
<s> If you can, ask her neighbors that have DSL, find out their real speeds are; run a speed test if they do not know if they will let you (C/net.com has a speed test, there is also the FCC app & Speed test app, both are free, made for the iPhone/iTouch but work on the iPad) & find out what package they have. </s>
<s> Also what will she be needing the Internet for? </s>
<s> Video like YouTube or the ABC app which works very good on &quot;slow speeds&quot;, YouTube is slow on the my iPad but on my Panasonic tv or PC YouTube streaming is fine, not great. </s>
<s> .5mbps is fine for X-box live gaming. </s>
<s> If just web surfing with little videos watching & email the slowest package should be fine. </s>
<s> If she starts watching more & more videos she will not be happy with bottom end package & she be wanting to throw the iPad out the window then. </s>
<s> For Satellite broadband, get that only if you have too, only!!! </s>
<s> like if she lived outside of DLS coverage. </s>
<s> My uncle had to have satellite broadband (HughesNet) & I could never send him more then 2 photos because it is slow... upload speeds & download speeds, it was not much faster then dial-up & he had the mid range package, $68 (or so) a month, for the near DLS speeds your talking $160 a month about & still have a good lag. </s>
<s> So you need: A Modem A Router In-line filter for each phone An ISP provider Note AT&T has a 2in1 modem & router &quot;2wire&quot; they may force you to buy for an over charged price, they did that to me so that I could get special monthly rate of $18 & a 1 year contract (6 years later it is $28 a month, same package & slower real speed), I do not know if they changed that. </s>
<s> It is not very well built, kept falling over all the time, short range & it died 2 weeks after the warranty expired, $60 gone there. </s>
