thanks for your reply to my dilemma, brent.
however, i'm more concerned about whether the loud noises are an indication of malfunctioning hds rather than surpressing the noises.
have you had any prior experience(s) with maxtor drives exhibiting loud clicking sounds?
is it the nature of their hard drives?
