I know there is no argument that a dedicated SC is better than a basic on board however with the set up I have, will there be a noticeable difference on games, music and movies if I upgraded to the Audigy SE? &lt;br&gt; My current system specs are: &lt;br&gt; Win Vista, Intel Q6600 processor, 4 gb ram, nVidia 8800 GTS Logitech Z-5300e 5.1 speaker system. Any input would be much appreciated. Thanks!
