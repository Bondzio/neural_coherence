lexmark does make the dell model.
the whole difference is the mounting tab, in effect slightly different in order to interfere with using non-dell labeled carts.
this isn't an uncommon practice, but why deal with it, just get the same looking lexmark ptr.
model.
btw, lexmark tend to have more costly ink carts compared to other brands.
believe me, shop around and get a different non-dell ptr.
all those other ptrs.
will work, by heck, its your choice.
