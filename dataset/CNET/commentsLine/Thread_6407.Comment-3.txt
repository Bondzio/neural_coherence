that 2 2-gig sticks of ddr2 would beat 1 4-gig stick of ddr3?
or have i misunderstood?
i'm aware that there are different speeds of ram, as well as other things that could make a computer run more quickly, so if possible, we'll have to treat this with an &quot;all other things being equal&quot; condition.
