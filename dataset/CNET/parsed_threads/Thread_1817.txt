<s> I'd like to state that I don;t know very much about a computer's inner workings so... </s>
<s> Here's my question: I have a fairly crappy E310 with 1g RAM and 2.8 processor. </s>
<s> I'm trying to upgrade my graphics card, but first I've decided I need a new power supply first, which will be a 400w. </s>
<s> All I really want to do is play CounterStrike:Source and Quake Wars. </s>
<s> For about 40 bucks. </s>
<s> I really dont understand a lot of the specifications for these things so if you could give me some tips or card suggestions (preferably newegg.com) that'd be GREAT, thanks. </s>
<s> So this is the list I agree with -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/10/01/the_best_gaming_graphics_cards_for_the_money/ Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the site and the list, but how do I find if it is indeed a AGP slot? </s>
<s> Perhaps the manual? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I don't see anything about AGP, just PCI. </s>

<s> A proper ID of said machine is needed. </s>
<s> effective option. </s>
<s> The system docs indicate your PC has a PCIe 1X slot and there are PCIe 1X slot video cards. </s>
<s> Problem is the choices are narrow and the prices sky high. </s>
<s> Here's a link for some PCI cards ...note they are arranged by reviewer ratings...not by price. </s>

<s> Just wanted to make sure I was clear ...the Dell system docs show 2-PCI slots and 1-PCIe 1X but you need to check to see if they're being used or not. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> But I have another question. </s>
<s> Where it say's &quot;memory&quot; on the card info section does that have anything to do with my RAM? </s>
<s> I know what I have is DDR2 but I see video cards that say DDR or GDDR. </s>
<s> You asked...&quot;Where it say's &quot;memory&quot; on the card info section does that have anything to do with my RAM?&quot; No...it (usually) refers only to the RAM that comes on the video card. </s>
<s> The good thing is going from an onboard GPU (which uses system RAM) to a separate video card which has it's own RAM and leaves the system RAM for the use by the system. </s>
<s> It's really a 'twofor'. </s>
