<s> Hello all, Newbie here. </s>
<s> I am trying to use my pc's internet connection that I am getting from a cricket wireless device to go to a linksys wrt54g router. </s>
<s> I believe it should be possible to enable ICS and hook up a cable from the nic on the pc to the wan port on the router but have not been able to get it to work so far. </s>
<s> OS=Win 7 but would like to know how to do it on xXP also. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/7723-6035_102-539803.html?messageId=5194810#message5194810 is a comparable discussion. </s>
<s> But, apart from learning that it's difficult, nothing came out of it. </s>

<s> In XP it did work here but I can't offer any support. </s>
<s> There are only a few million PCs out there and I've never found 2 that were the same. </s>

<s> you could just bridge the wireless and wired NIC in the PC? </s>
<s> I've done this in reverse to turn a wireless NIC into an AP. </s>
<s> Perhaps it would work in either direction. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot !!!! </s>
<s> Very easy solution. </s>
<s> Just a few changes to the configuration. </s>
<s> 1. disable ICS 2. plug the network cable into the lan instead int oth wan port on the router 3. bridge the two connections Thanks Steven </s>
<s> just bridge the two connections </s>
<s> just disable ics and bridge the two connections </s>
