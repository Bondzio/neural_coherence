<s> I was trying a trial software for home networking and its a nice program, but it cannot settle for some reason me sharing files and folders. </s>
<s> So I decided to remove it and go along with windows xp network wizard. </s>
<s> BTW, I have a wirless usb adapter on laptop, which oddly, I am able to go on the internet with it via my router. </s>
<s> Getting back to XP networking, i ran the wizard on both computers, and only one has an ip address, the host when I do ipconfig. </s>
<s> The laptop comes back with: Desination host unreachable ( 4 X ).Packet 100% loss. </s>
<s> I disabled firewall. </s>
<s> just what else is there to do? </s>
<s> The message says check connections. </s>
<s> Someone told me to check Dchp i believe is the acronym..but the wizard does not give me that option...only my router does. </s>
<s> Given only the details in your post I can't comment why the unnamed software appears to be buggy. </s>
<s> Maybe you should do the setup without it? </s>

<s> Maybe you should do the setup without it?&gt;&gt;&gt; Which setup are you talking about...XP wizard or the magic network software? </s>
<s> I've reinstalled the software so many times even their techs are confused...which is not saying much these days. </s>
<s> Obviously, you don't mean the XP wizard...how else can one setup a network..Jeesh! </s>
<s> For instance the Wizard can't handle making the connection if we add or enable a firewall. </s>
<s> So it's my view we best do without such wizards and set these things up the old fashioned way. </s>
<s> There is a Magic Network software out there but I've never found it reliable enough to sort out networks for those that wanted an easy button. </s>
<s> I'm still pretty stumped since I know so little about your network. </s>
<s> Sometimes it's out of date firmware in the router, firewall settings or other oddities. </s>
<s> How do I setup a network? </s>
<s> I follow the directions on the router and know when and where to setup the firewall to allow what I want. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> First, I read somewhere that windows wizard for networking takes into account about firewalls...regardless, I had it disabled anyway on both computers. </s>
<s> Your right about Magic Network..it is fickled..so I removed it. </s>
<s> Now, my systems were working when i had a ethernet connection, and that was done with xp wizard. </s>
<s> Now that i got a usb adapter wi-fi for my laptop, i couldn't get to share files or folders although they were chosen in setup. </s>
<s> I am able to get to the internet though.The adapter is not at fault, because me and a tech of theirs established that, plus the fact I am able to get on the internet. </s>
<s> I was wondering if the software that came with the usb adapter may be at fault...if I remove it, then most likely I would not be able to get on the internet also. </s>
<s> So I am at a loss. </s>
<s> I had a 20+ back and forth discussion and it ended when we started to share details so I could point to the firewall in the router. </s>
<s> If you don't share the details I can't tell you about that setting in the router. </s>
<s> But you can look since you are there. </s>
