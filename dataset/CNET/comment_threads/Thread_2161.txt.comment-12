Firslty, i looked at other forums with people with this problem, and i havn't seen one good solution found.
I don't know where to find a newer driver, windows can't find one, my version is 6.14.10.0425.
This is really getting me down, i thought building a pc would be easy enough, but mine is pretty useless, its so frustrating.
I might try running memtest86 or MS memory diagnostic to test things.
Would that be a good idea?
If so, what kind of result would i be looking for?
