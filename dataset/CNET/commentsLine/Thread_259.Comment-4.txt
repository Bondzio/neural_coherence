i have little to work with as to if you know about scsi, drivers for such, and more.
so without some long &quot;interview&quot; i'm going to skip to some other solution i've seen.
1. get some usb hard disk.
2. clone your system to that with acronis.
3. run pc relocator and see if it would recover from that.
i've seen that work so for me this would be best to repeat former succeses.
&quot;i still can't use the drives, &quot; again, it wouldn't be funny to read your real issue and then have it one of those things we fix in the forums daily... for all i know it could be that old upperfilters, lowerfilters registry entry we delete and the drives show up.
or your choice of cd/dvd recording software went south.
we have replacements such as cdburnerxp.
i'm sure you would not be happy if it was one of the usuals.
