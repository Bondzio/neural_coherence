<s> I have gone through about 5 PC's now, and usually because out dated. </s>
<s> / With the newer computers I really believe its best to leave PC on and use the &quot;stand-by&quot; or sleep mode when not using it for longer than 3hours. </s>
<s> The only time I turn off, is if I am not going to be using it for longer than 48 hours, or for a Update-restart. </s>
<s> Not good for the hard drive to shut it off and on/ will shorten life. </s>
<s> / hope this helps. </s>
<s> I think that leaving the PC &quot;asleep&quot; or in the stand by mode is the same as shutting it off. </s>
<s> It would be better to leave in the &quot;always active&quot; mode so that the hard drive wont have to wake up and recover each time you move your mouse. </s>
<s> That will strain it and shorten its life as well. </s>
<s> Harddrive failures I have seen involve wear. </s>
<s> So I think not running it more than necessary is the better option. </s>
<s> I've also heard that to leave it on was better for the computer. </s>
<s> The expanding and contracting of the chips and boards wears them out faster. </s>
<s> I've used the same computer since 1998 and I believe that its lasted because of this. </s>

<s> Why waste the electricity? </s>
<s> If you aren't going to use it for at least 3 hours, turn it off! </s>
<s> The only condition I would make is do NOT turn it on and off frequently. </s>
<s> The repeated surges coming on, the temperature changes as the MB heats up and cools down are what are detrimental to the circuitry. </s>
<s> The longer the hard drive is running, the more likely for some part, especially the bearings and actuator arm, to fail. </s>
<s> If you will be using the computer within 3-4 hours, then put in stand by. </s>
<s> If more, shut it off. </s>
<s> Your computer need &quot;down-time&quot; (sleep) just like you do. </s>
<s> I turn mine off when not in use. </s>
<s> This is for two reasons - 1.To save risk of damage of components due to heat build-up, and shortening of the life of the processor fan and others. </s>
<s> 2.To reduce electricity use which mounts up over time. </s>
<s> My computer is a Windows 98 2E on 56K dial-up. </s>
<s> Those reasons are good. </s>
<s> Semiconductors have a limited life span, and heat shortens their life. </s>
<s> Computer monitors sometimes fail if they do not have enough ventilation as well. </s>
<s> Microprocessors have the same problem too. </s>
<s> If a computer draws 100 watts, that adds up to about 4 dollars per month if run continuously at about 8 cents per kwhr. </s>
<s> I also have only dial-up, I even use the high speed for $5 more per month because it loads pages faster and it lowers stress on internet servers, I think. </s>
