i have an older micron pc mellenia computer.
it has a 751mhz amd duron cpu.
i know that i can upgrade it to a 1000mhz amd thunderbird, cause i asked them a while ago, and i can find one that is not too expensive.
my question is, how hard is this to do?
is this basically a hardware operation, or is it very complicated?
i wouldn't bother to do it, but some of the programs i want to run could use the little bit of extra speed thanx kzolady
