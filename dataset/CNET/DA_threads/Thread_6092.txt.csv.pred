1.1.1	I have an iMac and will soon be buying a macbook .	St
1.1.2	The iMac is connected wirelessly to my Airport Extreme .	St
1.1.3	The macbook will be wireless as well .	St
1.1.4	do n't feel the Time Capsule is worth buying since I already have the Airport and do n't want to pay for another router .	St
1.1.5	Can I connect an external hard drive to the Airport and use it to backup both computers wirelessly ?	Ques
1.1.6	If so , would I need to partition an external drive to back up each one separately ?	Ques
1.1.7	Or are there ready-made options for backing up multiple computers wirelessly in this fashion ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	All hard disks require at least one partition and if you want more or required more this would be dictated by the backup software and optional otherwise .	St
1.2.2	Since you did n't share what backup software was being considered it 's unlikely we can discuss this further .	St

1.3.1	... for backing up and I 'm horribly delinquent in getting a solution in place .	St
1.3.2	SuperDuper was recommended as a good backup program .	St
1.3.3	But I 'm not sure if I need to hardwire each computer to an external drive separately or if there is a good way to take advantage of my wirelss Airport network in backing up both computers to a single backup unit .	St
1.3.4	It was suggested I would need to partition an external drive to backup the iMac and macbook separately on a single unit .	St
1.3.5	I have approx 100MB of videos , pics , tunes and documents that I need to backup .	St
1.3.6	Thanks for any advice .	Polite
1.4.1	http : //www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html seems to note you do n't need more than one partition since it looks like you can use a folder for each backup .	St
1.5.1	...	St
1.5.2	I can not ( or would not want to ) connect an external drive to my Airport and run my backups from each computer wirelessly ?	Ques
1.6.1	If you insist on specific non-supported file systems on said device .	St
1.6.2	That is , read the airport manual as to what it supports .	St
1.6.3	I do n't duplicate the manuals .	St
1.7.1	to answer questions 1 - yes your Airport extreme was made to share a USB HD 2 - no reason to partition 3 - the ready-made option = Time Machine or whatever you want to use	St
