it would be of more help if you would be able to offer suggestions rather than point out flaws.
yes, wifi is open and, therefore, never secure.
i am not ruling out third party interference, but given our environment i am not leaning in that direction.
there have never been firmware updates for the router, so it is obviously up-to-date, but again your willingness to waste my time with your lack of suggestion is noted.
the router has always been set to wpa2 personal.
i read through the introductory troubleshooting posts of this forum, which were of no real help solving my problem.
perhaps i am missing something.
i do not understand why a network that worked flawlessly for a year would suddenly and randomly become sporadic.
i do not understand why the devices &quot;see&quot; the network when they are disconnected yet cannot connect to it until the router is rebooted.
i am seeking suggestions and advice, not condescending attitude.
