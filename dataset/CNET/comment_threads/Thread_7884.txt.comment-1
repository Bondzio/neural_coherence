Hi all, I'm building myself a new &quot;budget&quot; PC as the old P4 one is getting ancient now The components I selected are as follows: CPU : INTEL Core 2 Duo E7200 2,53GHz (1066MHz) 3MBL2 WOLFDALE LGA775 - BOX VGA : ASUS EN8800GT/HTDP/256MB or 8800GTS (I'm still not sure but I'm probably getting the GT as its quite cheaper ) MB : GIGABYTE Sc 775 EP45-DS3, Intel P45 RAM : DIMM DDR2 2GB, 1066MHz, A-DATA, CL5-5-5-12 (KIT 2x1GB) Extreme Edition HDD : WD CAVIAR BLUE WD3200AAKS 320GB, 16MB cache Case : REDSTAR Happy16,400W,12cm fan Questions: Does this look like a nice &quot;ballanced&quot; PC build?
Is it OK to buy a case from Redstar?
Is 400watt PSU enough to supply all the power even if I buy the GTS video card?
Note: I'll be running XP, I'll update to vista only when it's absolutely needed (I want to keep my XP as long as possible) Thanks, J.M.
