<s> I want to find an Nvidia nforce motherboard to upgrade my current system. </s>
<s> I can't find one. </s>
<s> My preferences would be to have one with a PCIE connection (regardless 1x or 16x). </s>
<s> If not, at least an AGP 8x. </s>
<s> The RAM support needs to be at least dual cahnnel DDR 400 compatible. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> CPU: Intel P4 w/ HT @ 3.20 GHz Socket 478 current motherboard: Intel D865GVHZ (mATX) OS: Windows XP Pro </s>
<s> There are tons of socket 478 boards with AGP 8x. </s>
<s> I couldn't find one with PCIE x16. </s>
<s> Check this link out, 2 pgs. </s>
<s> of socket 478 boards with 8x AGP, see if that answers your question. </s>

<s> There are lots of SOCKET 478 motherboards with AGP 8X. </s>
<s> The are some really good ones that have Intel 865PE or Intel 875P northbridge chipsets. </s>
<s> I can recall a couple motherboards that that implemented PCI Express with SOCKET 478, but not all video cards work with it. </s>
<s> Buggy. </s>
<s> Here's one: http://www.asrockamerica.com/Products/P4Dual915gl.htm MY RECOMMENDATAION: Save your money and apply it to a new 64-bit AMD CPU system with PCI Express X16 slots. </s>
<s> Go for a dual core CPU if it fits the budget. </s>
<s> If you really want to upgrade the motherboard, I recommend going with a nice 865PE or 875P motherboard with that CPU and adding an AGP8X nVidia 6800GT if you want a good gamer. </s>
<s> You probably will need a good 450W PSU or better if you get that video card. </s>
<s> Not an Intel. </s>
<s> you mean the current nforces and discontinued nforces dont support my system? </s>
<s> with socket 468 that use the nForce chipsets [any of the nForce versions]. </s>
<s> Plenty for the LG 775 socket Intel CPU's. </s>
<s> I hope that you are not confusing the nForce chipset [made by NVidia] with the Gforce video chips. </s>
<s> Two totally different animals. </s>
<s> Basically any system with any chipset will run a NVidia chip video card. </s>
<s> i am not confusing gforce with nforce. </s>
<s> gforce is the term used with gpu's. </s>
<s> nforce is used for motherboards. </s>
<s> i didn't say i had socket 468. i have socket 478. </s>
<s> form factor: micro atx socket: 478 fsb: 800 mhz supports hyper-threading dual cahnnel ddr up to 4 gigs ethernet connection (LAN, GbE, whatever) agp 8x (not anything slower), preferably pci-e 16x (1x will not do) </s>
