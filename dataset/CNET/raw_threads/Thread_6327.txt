My usb ports suddenly stopped working. i had not installed any new programs, just one day i went plugged in my ipod, it charged perfectly but my PC did not know anything was there. Same thing with my printer, when i turn it on PC doenst know anything is there. i've tried uninsalling the usb drivers in device manager and reinstalling, but that didn't work. If anyone has any way to figure out what's wrong with them other than formating and reinstalling windows. thanks

If it does, the drivers should be automatically reinstalled. Now, you did not mention whether these USB ports were on an add in card or on the MB. If on the MB, you will have some fixed to the rear edge and maybe some cabled to the front. Front ports which are plugged in and not fixed to the MB can have the connectors come loose. Hope this gives a starting point.

My PC has 2 usb ports connected to MB, and another 2 in front of case that are connected by wire. I checked make sure the wire was firmly put in, which it was. It still won't recognize any devices i put in usb .

The two on the front most likely are a separate root hub than the two on the back. Doesn't sound like software unless you added something else creating a conflict (IRQ). Worst case scenario, get an inexpensive PCI card with a couple ports and has a connector for the front of your case. Less than $12 and disable the motherboard USB.

Look for one that has a matching connector on the card for your front panel USB port cable(s). Past that Newegg & Tigerdirect are good online sources. Once it works, then go into setup and disable the onboard USB chipset.

You may have the same problem here. Try reverting your computer back to before your most recent Windows update, reboot and see if it works after that. If it doesn't, then sorry I wasted your time. . . but you could just always reinstall the Windows update later :-D But that's what worked for me. . . Windows screwed up the update somehow, and after I backtracked and restored the computer to before that update, it was fine. Then Windows searched for new updates, and that update was now taken off the list and replaced with another update that went through just fine. Hopefully this will be your solution as well!

If you down load this software it might give you the name of the manufacturer: http://www.cpuid.com/pcwizard.php eSupport also has a free driver scanner to see if your drivers are up to date. Do the scan, if there &quot;not up to date&quot; you can search them out for yourself or pay for there service to do it for you. Cnet now has a service like this but the name escapes me at the moment. Here's eSupports link: http://scan.esupport.com/?CFID=1873774&CFTOKEN=53884679 eSupport is also a major BIOs supplier for HP. Are your BIOs current? This might also be the problem. If the drivers don't work for you then I think your board is shot. No, link here is an ad. That's all I have for you. This thread untracked.

I have Kaspesky full virus protection and ran a scan of &quot;riskware&quot;. It told me that I had outdated and dangerous old versions of Adobe Reader and Java. I went to &quot;Add/Remove programs&quot; on &quot;My Computer&quot; and deleted all of the above. Then, I added the newest versions of each and turned of my computer. Now I'm back up and running on all USB's and my computer is working faster. Play iy safe. Get a good V protection no matter what it cost's and scan frequently. Get updates on all programs and make sure the old versions are GONE. I hope this works for you. I tried everything else!

I think this is due to a recent driver update that I installed relating to a power management app. Has to be, because it didn't power down the ports before that. Thanks for the tip.
