I have search the net and found out that this is a typically problem with Compaq computers. But, it can't be impossible, or?! When I start the computer I first press ESC to se the Compaq logo and the text below on the screen &quot;Press F10 for Setup&quot; I do, then I read somewhere that you should wait untill a cursor flash in the left upper corner and then press F10. Despite all this there is no access to BIOS, XP starts almost immediate! I need to access the BIOS si I can uppgrade the memory. I appreciate if someone know more about this and could help me? Thanks!
