the price really isn't too good, and when you think about it, you can get a high-end macbook for a much better deal.
it's portable too, and though it is not as light, it is definitely more powerful.
1.6ghz is kind of low for a mac nowadays... wired was a bit off, but doesn't matter.
they were close after all.
in other matters... after i was playing around with my router, i ended up rendering it useless.
i wouldn't say i broke it, but it's now impossible to access it, so it will not work at all.
it was a terrible router anyway.
my new belkin router is much better and i'm happy with it.
i would have gotten a time capsule had they been available today and not in two weeks, but i needed a wi-fi network now.
currently, i've upgraded my laptop with the latest apple updates and i'm upgrading my touch!
see, apple released some goodies before the sdk went out.
glad i waited.
i want an apple tv now... those rentals sound good to me.
