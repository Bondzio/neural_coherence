your great article taught me a lot about wireless router choices.
i recently signed up for vonage viop service and will recieve their vonage/linksys rt31p2 router.
i would like to order a wireless router and agree that d-link and netgear look great.
i have a netgear 802.11g wg511 pc card.
i also have a d-link d1-704 router so things are about to get complex if i am not carefull.
i have three notebook computers.
one is used as a print server, one as my primary and one as a backup that i take with me for presentations.
the primary has a lacie usb powered 80gb external for backup and currently my keyboard and optical mouse run off a usb hub that the 80gb lacie will be connected to.
i also have 1 hp5250 usb printer and 1 hp6210 multi-function that will be wired on the network.
whew, quite a home office i am trying to put together here.
i would like to know if anyone knows of any compatibility issues between the netgear, vonage/linksys and d-link.
i can drop the d-link from the network if necessary and just go with the vonage/linksys and whatever wireless 802.11g or super-g you recommend.
any advice or shared experience would be greatly appreciated.
