yeah...dp-u50 is a processor only, no amp.
the rp-100 has the built in 30 watt per ch.
amp + a tuner; still only 2 channels (virtual dolby 5.1.
-you can find one for $99.- nice price).
also, if i'm not mistaken, you can check out the rp-u200: 5 channel discrete + a remote.
i picked up a pair of the ns-u50's for $17.99 (new) last week.
they're o.k with a sub, but my polk r15's sound much better.
i'm using the rp-100, mostly in straight stereo.
i got it to use with my g4 cube which only has usb sound interface- does everything i need & more for not a lot more than a pair of those tinny mac pro speakers.
good luck.
