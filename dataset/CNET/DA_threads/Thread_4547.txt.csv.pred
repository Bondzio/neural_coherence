1.1.1	hello I have this line FTP 21 21 TCP 21 21 192.168.1.150 on the DSL-2640B for port forwarding and the router is still not forwarding to the FTP server serv-u administrator in the corresponding computer with internal ip 192.168.1.150 Firewalls are not enabled in the computer 192.168.1.150 either in win xp or in the Eset antivirus which is currently installed.	St
1.1.2	So, I do not know what the problem might be.	Res
1.1.3	I do want to use ftp from the internet to connect to the PC 192.168.1.150 What I know is that the FTP server is working locally if i do ftp 192.168.1.150 but it is not working when I use the router's static ip address.	St
1.1.4	Any idea?	St
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	This is well discussed.	St
1.2.2	The bad news is that such is well discussed.	Polite
1.2.3	Let's dive in.	St
1.2.4	1, I see you list port 21 but what did you do for port 20?	St
1.2.5	2, Can you SET PASV I know some don't want to dive in and get technical but this technical.	St
1.2.6	Sorry if this upsets you but all kinds of folk come here.	St
1.2.7	If I make it too simple the advanced user flames about being treated like a newbie.	St
1.2.8	If I use the terms I use with my office workers on a newbie they might feel slighted.	St
1.2.9	Sorry if I don't get that right.	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	There was no problem.	St
1.3.2	The problem is that i was tring to ftp the router's external wan ip address from inside of the LAN and that's why it failed.	St
1.3.3	Now i tested it from the outside and it worked fine.	St
1.3.4	Thanks	Polite
