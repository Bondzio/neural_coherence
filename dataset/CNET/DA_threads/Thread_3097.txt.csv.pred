1.1.1	Hi !	St
1.1.2	I need to extend my DVI signal over 50 ft and maintain a 1920 x 1080 resolution .	St
1.1.3	I am using a Startech DVI over Cat 6 Active Extender ( powered transmitter/receivers ) with a 50ft cat6 cable .	St
1.1.4	& lt ; div & gt ; The computer is a Dell Optiplex 330 with a ATI Radeon HD2400 ( about 3 years old ) with DVI output .	St
1.1.5	I am connecting it to a NEC v422 - 42 '' LCD commercial monitor .	St
1.1.6	The first time I booted it , it worked fine .	St
1.1.7	When I restarted the CPU the problems started .	St
1.1.8	Every time I power on the computer I see the windows loading page , but then the screen loses the signal before it actually reaches windows ( it gets lost somewhere between the black windows loading page and before it get to the blue windows loading ) .	St
1.1.9	Sometimes it wont even catch any signal For troubleshooting I replaced the Optiplex with a mac mini - no problem there .	St
1.1.10	Then tried with a Dell Laptop with hdmi output and worked well even with a hdmi to dvi converter .	St
1.1.11	But everytime I connect it with the Optiplex it does the same issue .	St
1.1.12	I also plugged a 25 ft dvif from the optiplex straight to the LCD , worked fine too ( obviously ) .	St
1.1.13	What is the problem here ?	Ques
1.1.14	Do you think a more recent video card will be better ?	Ques
1.1.15	Does anyone have an idea ?	Ques
1.1.16	Thanks !	St
1.1.17	& lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.2.1	the video card is not detecting the monitor , thru the extender , when its Vista driver is loaded .	St
1.2.2	Does the monitor have an INF file for Vista that you can install on the PC ?	Ques
1.2.3	Also if you have ATI CCC installed , check settings for the display when PC and monitor are directly connected ; set it to auto detect .	St
1.2.4	Other things to try : update ATI driver/CCC , preferably from card manufacturer site and not directly from AMD .	St
1.2.5	Also StarTech might have a clue why the HD2400 ca n't work with their extender .	St
1.2.6	If all fails , you might as well try a different video card .	St
