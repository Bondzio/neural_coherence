Thanks for the help guys but I actually got it.
I had to install the NWLink IPXSPXNetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol on the laptop.
As soon as I did that, they all found each other and they were all able to &quot;talk&quot; to each other.
Once I found that, it took me 10 seconds to fix it.
Pretty frustrating when it is something that simple and I was looking for the answer for a week, but at least it's fixed and so far it seems to be working well.
Thanks again, Tracy
