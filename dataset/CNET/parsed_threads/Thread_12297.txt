<s> Hello, I have been having some trouble with my laptop. </s>
<s> I have a HP Pavillion DV8000 with Windows XP. </s>
<s> None of my USB ports seem to work, when I plug something in the error message titled &quot;USB Device Not Recognized&quot; pops up and the device does not operate. </s>
<s> I have researched this as much as possible for about 2 hours now and I have tried these methods. </s>
<s> - Unpluging power cord and battery - Deleting the items for USB under Device Manager - Checking for updates in windows update - Scanning for hardware changes in Device Manager I would really appreciate some help. </s>
<s> I have Service Pack 3. </s>
<s> If it ever worked since the OS was installed. </s>
<s> The most common failure here is the bum install of the OS. </s>
<s> This dv8000 has an onerous install procedure too similar to this -&gt; http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?threadID=271360#2699006 This is why I use the restore media as folk rarely will pay for the 2 to 5 days to install XP. </s>

<s> Do you get any error mark in device driver section of usb in device manager? </s>
<s> best bet is to update or reinstall the drivers and also check with another usb device on all the ports. </s>
<s> Also use the inbuilt hw diagnostic for any information in regards to this. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Unplug a USB device, wait 10 seconds. </s>
<s> Then hold down the Shift key on the keyboard while plugging the USB device back in. </s>
<s> Sounds like your laptop is missing the required drivers for the Motherboard, not Windows drivers! </s>
<s> Check your system, using the Control Panel, Device Manager and look for the USB tab. </s>
<s> If it has a question mark of 'x' beside it, you need to install the machines drivers, so that the computer itself can recognize the ports. </s>
<s> Download the required driver from the manufacturers website and install them, or (after downloading), Update the drivers from the control panel, using the download. </s>
<s> Should work perfectly after that MarkinTO </s>
<s> The Mac (OS X) and the PC (NTFS) use different operating systems and devices formatted specifically for one will not function in the other. </s>
<s> FAT 32 is a universal standard which allows external devices like HD's, thumb drives, and memory cards to be used interchangeably to transport data back and forth etc. </s>
<s> So perhaps you have some devices specifically formatted for the Mac, or perhaps some other system. </s>
<s> So you might check your formatting. </s>
