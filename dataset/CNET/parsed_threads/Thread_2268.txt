<s> I had a Dell system sitting in my living room for a year. </s>
<s> It was a system we used for the business, which went out of business, hence why it hasnt been used The other day, I attempted to start it up. </s>
<s> It booted to Windows normally. </s>
<s> The next day, I attempted to boot, and instead of the system booting, I am hearing a series of 4-5 long beeps. </s>
<s> The monitor light did not turn green, so the system is not starting up. </s>
<s> Also, the CPU fan sounds as if it is spinning at triple speed. </s>
<s> The motherboard light IS on. </s>
<s> (I believe its orange..not home other wise I would check) Troubleshooting steps I have already taken: I disconnected EVERYTHING except the monitor. </s>
<s> No keyboard, no mouse no CD-Rom drive no floppy no network connection. </s>
<s> The issue still occurred. </s>
<s> I also disconnected the monitor, and it still occurred. </s>
<s> For the hell of it, I disconnected the hard drive, and the same thing occurred. </s>
<s> I decided to give it a day and try again. </s>
<s> I started the computer up, and it did boot to Windows. </s>
<s> Knowing I need to repeat the process, I shut it down and tried again. </s>
<s> This time, as if repeating from yesterday, the system did not boot, with the same series of beeps and the fan moving in light speed. </s>
<s> I tried to start the system up 10 more times, and the same errors occurred. </s>
<s> If anyone can help: Im assuming its a hardware problem, but motherboard? </s>
<s> Power supply? </s>
<s> Hardrive? </s>
<s> Thank you for any help anyone can give. </s>
<s> Michael </s>
<s> the beeps are telling you where the problem is if you know how to interprit them.. call dell up and see if its still under warrenty? </s>
<s> if it is get them to fix it.. if not you may need a new one? </s>
<s> Note down the beep sequence and then get to Dell support website. </s>
<s> That sequence will explain what problem its having as determined by the bios error beep code. </s>
<s> Be absolutely sure of the beeps, 4-5 beeps seems not so. </s>
<s> If it sounds like long and short beeps, note that also. </s>
<s> Then at Dell, for your model#, proceed to determine cause. </s>
<s> As another poster mentioned, if you have warranty, use it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> the beeps sounds like memory problem try taking the memory out then back in if you have more than one stick try just one at a time see if that will help. </s>
<s> thank you To everyone who replied...It actually was an issue with the RAM being partially unseated. </s>
<s> So luckily fixing the problem won't end up costing me any money, as the warranty has expired </s>
<s> Grats and woot </s>
