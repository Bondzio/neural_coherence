i installed the chipset drivers, quickset, and several other drivers, and i'm still having the same problem.
the computer says that no wireless adapter has been installed.
when i install the wireless driver, it begins to detect it, but then the computer crashes.
is it possible that the wireless adapter was damaged somehow?
