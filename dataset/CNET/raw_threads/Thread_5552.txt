Which one? a6750t: Intel Core 2 QuadQ8300 (2.5 GHz); 4GB DDR2-800MHz dual channel SDRAM; 256MB NVIDIA GeForce grap. card; 500GB 7200 rpm SATA 3Gb/s HD; tv tuner a6712f: Pent. E5200 (W) 2.5GHz (65W); 6GB DDR2-6400MB/s 240pin SDRAM; video graphics integrated om motherboard; 500GB 7200 rpm SATA 3Gb/s HD There is a fair difference in price, but it is not as important as to get the best machine for the intended use: some video editing, some gaming and a lot of homework.

HOWEVER, I'm going to start writing to wait for Windows 7. The more I try it, the better it gets. I'm going to hold out. Bob
