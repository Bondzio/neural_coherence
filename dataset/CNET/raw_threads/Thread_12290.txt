6021	0	193150	2086802	NR	morningman82	7/23/06 7:50 AM	1.153641E12	No internet connection on laptop	Hi there, I have a wireless network using a DI-624 router and DSL internet. I have the desktop wired to the router, and the laptop has wireless access. All was fine until a few months ago when we kept losing our laptop connection sporadically. Come to find out that others were honing in on our connection because I didn't have it encrypted. Then I couldn't get the laptop to connect to the network at all. I've now got the laptop connecting to the network, but can't get an internet connection with it. The desktop works fine with the internet but the laptop sees nothing. I get the DNS error. The network settings are: WEP enabled, using HEX key Channel 4 Any suggestions?
