In Windows it shows I have my wireless connection as &quot;Excellent&quot; but when I go to Internet Explorer to browse I get a &quot;page cannot be displayed&quot; message. Helpful advice in another forum guided me to record my 10.5.7 settings which I assume are the numbers for the router etc., and this I did. However it didn't get me any closer to viewing a web page. I'm sure I must be doing something wrong or just plain dumb so if anyone has gone thru the same process it would be really appreciated if you could put me on the right track. Regards and thanks in advance. Tony

Someone has the PROXY set in IE. And since such is rarely used, that's incorrect. Just use any other browser next time. Bob
