now i think i understand a little more about the configurations of your systems.
would you look at a few things and tell us what they look like.
first, there is a cable from your adlink transceiver to your buffalo router.
second, there must be a cable between the fiber optic wall box and your wife's new internet system.
when you unplug the first cable from the adlink and the second cable from the wall box, do the plugs look alike?
in other words, are these two cables both standard ethernet cables?
if so, let's try step two.
what happens when you take the cable between the adlink transceiver and the buffalo router and instead take the end that was in the adlink and plug it into the fiber optic plug.
you will need to turn the router off and then turn it back on, and then reboot your computer.
if my hunch is correct, you'll be able to reach the internet using your router and your wife's fiber optic line.
of course, now your wife's system is unplugged from the internet (and she's angry too ).
plug it into one of the other ports on your buffalo router (right beside the cable to your computer.
again, if my hunch is correct, her new machine will connect to her isp's pages.
let us know what you find.
