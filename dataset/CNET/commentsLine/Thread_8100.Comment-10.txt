about not counting 100% on external hard drives for backup.
i had a 120 gig drive i used to backup all files,documents, pictures and such.
i am also from the old school about always double covering yourself with anything important.
i have pictures that can't be replaced so i also burned everything to dvds the external drive crashed after a year, but i really didn't lose anything because i have everything on dvd.
dvd/rw and cd/rw blank media is cheap and well worth the time and investment.
