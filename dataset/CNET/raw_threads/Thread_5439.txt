Games are for the most part maxing out pc video cards and games for the ps3 are using maybe 10% of its true power. using multiple cores is so much more efficient too. the writers of games and programs at that matter just need to start writing stuff for multiple cores. multiple cores are the future no doubt about it.

7722	9	233872	2406763	2406543	Gigity Gigity Goo	2/16/07 9:52 PM	1.17166272E12	and they were compairing to p4	p4 sux so much a 2ghz amd beats a 3.4 ghz p4 by alot from my expierence alone from my old pc and my moms she had ddr2 ram and i had ddr, one channel same amount but crappier. thats ridiculouse man. my cpu is prolly like twice as fast as the fasted p4.
