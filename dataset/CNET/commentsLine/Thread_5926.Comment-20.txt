colors.
i just looked at my stock.
all of the round ones are the colors mentioned.
however, i have three 80 conductor ribbon cables and they are different colors.
however it is easy to tell which should go on the mobo, and the middle is always the slave and the end the master.
pretty simple in that on the slave pin 24 has no wire connected to it, while on the master pin 24 does have a wire connected.
