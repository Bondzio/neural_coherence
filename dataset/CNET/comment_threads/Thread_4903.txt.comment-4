Hi!, I am getting the same problem.
Reasion I concluded is your main computer to which the printer is attached is using colour cartriage when take colour print, and uses black and white cartriage when u use black and white print, but nothing is like this with other computer on network.
The other computer on network always uses the colour cartriage, even if u select grayscale-black&white option, and the fact is your colour cartriage is about to empty.
Just refill your colour cartraige u will get rid of this problem.
U have only 2 systems on your network so don't have much problem but I have 15 systems so I am having a bit problem.
All computers except one is using the colour cartriage.
Thus colour cartriage is getting emply early.
If any body have solution of this problem kindly advice.
Thanks in advance... msnegi98
