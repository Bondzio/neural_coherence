I did not get an installation CD with the router so i set it all up on line. All that seemed to work fine and when i go to the &quot;see available wireless network connections in range&quot;, on my laptop it does show up, however i can not connect to it wirelessly. What am i doing wrong.....it has driven me potty - my grandparents have now gone away for a short break but i would love to have the solution ready to fix this when they return. They currently connect to the internet via virgin NTL - from what i can see i plugged all the cables in correctly to get it up and going however as soon as i unplug the blue lead belonging to the netgear wireless router from my computer the internet connection goes and i still can not connect wirelessly!! Any help would be hugely appreciated L

The reason you can't connect is that DSL can use PPPoE software to login. When you change to your router you don't need that since you'll set the router to handle the login. There was some clamor to ship the routers with the radio set to off. Did you turn it on and set it up like we note at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=264135&messageID=2584349 Bob
