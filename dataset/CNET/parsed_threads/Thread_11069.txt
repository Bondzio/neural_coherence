<s> Not a good idea to disconnect a device while current is flowing, although I have removed monitor plugs inadvertantly and reconnected without occurence. </s>
<s> A better solution to split a monitors usage between two computers would be a KVM switch. </s>
<s> Great idea. </s>
<s> I googled kvm and got some pretty nice all-in-one switch with cables under $30. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
