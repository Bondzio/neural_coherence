and sometimes even *other* D-Link adapters.
First, do you have a static or dynamic IP address?
If dynamic, you may need some info from your isp.
Anyway, you may want to try this, reset the router per D-Link's instructions (normally a little button you have to push, sometime with something like a pencil point).
Open up Internet Explorer, and under tools&gt;internet options&gt;General Tab, left click the Delete Files button in the middle to get rid of any cached router addresses.
RE-setup router per the instructions.
Then go through the setup page.
Did the router and Sony EVER communicate with the 'net?
Sometimes doing a repair of your lan connection will fix it, and check to see if the XP firewall is enabled.
