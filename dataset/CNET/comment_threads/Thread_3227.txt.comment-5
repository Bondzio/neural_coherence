I just want to look up on the internet for locations to plug into my garmin.
Like today I was out of town and wanted to find a dog park.
But gps isn't that detailed and up to date.
I don't have a budget.
I'm learning toward the iPad2 wifi only.
I suppose it does the most and has to most accessories?
Why would I want 32 or 64gb?
Is iPad the best?
Are the others comparitable?
If I just go w/ the iPad can I ignore the rest?
