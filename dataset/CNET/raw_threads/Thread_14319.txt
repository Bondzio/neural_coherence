I have a Gateway keyboard such as this one: http://www.oemliquidators.com/images/catalog/7003331.jpg I also have a cat, and she sheds... a LOT. I was wondering where I could get one of those keyboard protectors like those at doctor offices, cafeterias, and the like. Basically, a plastic mold that sits on top of the keys and doesn't allow entry of liquids, hair, or dirt. I don't think those extra buttons on top of the keyboard (view the picture linked above) should be a problem, even for a standard protector... I could probably cut that out, or something. Suggestions? Thanks...
