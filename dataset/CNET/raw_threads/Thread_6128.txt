I was hoping someone here with more knowledge could help me decide. The first system, an HP M7330N, is the cheaper of the two. I haven't been able to find out much about the system, but it does seem decent for the price. Right now, all i'm worried about it a decent media center pc. The second computer is a Dell Dimension 5150. This is about 200 dollars more expensive, but it comes with dual tv tuners (a feature that's important and one the hp lacks) and i'm used to going with dell computers. Couple of factors that are holding me back: the tv tuners (dell), i really want the AMD 64 X2 (hp), and i hear that hp computers suck (even moreso) if you want to add and expand in the future. But still, the price of the hp is looking really good to me. Can anyone here give me any ideas? I don't really play games on the computer, but i intend to more often (sims 2, the movies, half-life 2). Just a few games, really, and i'm not worried about having the visuals maxed out. I just photoshop and watch tv. Sorry if this is a bother.

One, is the lack of dual tuners. You can fix that either by an external USB tuner or a ATI All-In-Wonder card such as X800 or X1600. Two, is the integrated X200 Radeon graphics. That is resolvable by using the above AIW, or a card such as Nvidia's 6800GS or better. (Any faster card would require that you upgrade the pwer supply too...) The biggest advantages over the Dell are the X2 4200 VS the P4 3.0 and the MUCH bigger hard drive. PLUS that the 5150 is discontinued in favor of the E510 series..

On the Canadian Dell website, the 5150 is still available, so i had no idea it was discontinued. I checked the american site and sure enough, it's not there. I'm really glad you pointed this out to me. So, with the All-In-Wonder, i'll be able to record one show and watch another? That would be great, but like you said, i'd have to upgrade the power suply. Only problem, i hear that's hard to do if you don't use HP products (the style and size of the casing).

The X800 AIW shouldn't need a PS upgrade but it couldn't hurt. I just wouldn't want a card that old when newer ones aren't much more expensive! I believe you can watch one and record another but I haven't tried it yet (no tuner yet on my Media Center PC lol). As far as the PS upgrade itself, HP uses more standard sized PS, unlike DELL which is notorious for customized PS setups (try a standard PS and watch your MB fry)
