1.1.1	I have eMachines desktop T6212 , with pre-installed LITE-ONs SOHW-1633S DVD-RW drive .	St
1.1.2	Its a duel layer DVD writer .	St
1.1.3	I was using it ( read/write ) since last six months without any problem .	St
1.1.4	But last week suddenly , it stopped recognizing any DVD ( movie , recorded DVD-R ) [ Actually I tried to clean totally unnecessarily its laser lens using Philips Laser Lens Cleaner disc but not sure , that created this problem ] .	St
1.1.5	Anyway , I reported this problem to eMachines and they shipped me a brand new LITE-ONs SHW-1635S DVD-RW drive that I installed later .	St
1.1.6	But my problem remained same .	St
1.1.7	Symptoms of problems are : ( 1 ) when a DVD is inserted , windows explorer does not show any file in the drive ; in fact , drive never finish reading , it makes noise while trying to read it .	St
1.1.8	( 2 ) When CD is placed , the same DVD-RW drive reads it quickly and displays the typical small window asking to play with Media Player or Open the Folder etc ; windows explorer shows file within the CD too and it is recognized .	St
1.1.9	( 3 ) When you dont have any disk on the drive and try to click the drive-letter ( E : or F : etc ) in windows explorer , it typically gives an error message saying Please insert a disk in drive .	St
1.1.10	For this faulty DVD Drive , such error message does not appear ( but other drives in the same PC , gives such message ) .	St
1.1.11	( 4 ) In Device Manager , it is rightly recognized and shows working properly .	St
1.1.12	Above all symptoms are true for both old and new replaced DVD drives .	St
1.1.13	When I faced the problem with old DVD drive , I tried to change its firmware , with no success .	St
1.1.14	On suggestion , I tried to restore system from the date when my old DVD drive was working fine ; again no success .	St
1.1.15	I tried all familiar process of uninstalling the DVD-RW from device manager and then restarting the PC when new hardware got recognized and installed ; again no success .	St
1.1.16	I tried the same for new drive too no success again .	St
1.1.17	Now eMachines is suggesting to do the complete System Restore ( at the pre-sale status ) that is so undesirable and has no guarantee to the resolution .	St
1.1.18	I feel , it may not be any hardware or firmware problem .	St
1.1.19	I dont remember installing any new software since last rightly working DVD drive days .	St
1.1.20	I cleaned up PC from adware or spyware .	St
1.1.21	Please help or let me know any site/forum where similar problems were discussed or resolved .	Ques
