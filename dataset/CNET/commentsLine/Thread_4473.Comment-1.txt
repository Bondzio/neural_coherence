mk so many problems here... i recently got a hp g71 laptop from a friend who said thatit would not start up correctly and the bootmgr was broken.
well, in my attempt to fix it i found that the d: drive was also 'missing'.
so as i tried to fix bootmgr using a windows 7 repair disc and going through that crap i eventually found that the bootmgr cant be fixed till the hard drive is.
so, i ran this thing where it says at the top 'checking disk local disk (d:)' and i knew there was bad clusters so i checked the thing about attempt to clean up bad clusters.
so far this checking disk thing has been going on for almost 3 days.
and its at about 60% progress.. i would also like to wipe everything off the laptop before i give it to my girlfriend that way she pretty much has a fresh start and not a ton of crap.
my questions are.. is it supposed to take this long?
am i on the right path?
&gt; if i'm no,t how do i fix this?
will doing all this wipe my hard-drive like i want?
any questions i will answer to the best of my abilities
