<s> hey so i want to upgrade my ram and what is the most 32 bit windows 7 ultimate can take? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> 4Gb is the max. </s>
<s> amount it will report, HOWEVER!!! </s>
<s> it may not actually use this amount but probable 3.5gb. </s>
<s> You can install 4gb of ram in the ram slots, but as i stated only a certain amt. </s>
<s> will actually be used. </s>
<s> If your system is capable install win7 64bit as better solution. </s>
<s> Also, your system may need a bios update to handle such ram if not already installed. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The issue of less than 4GB is widely discussed. </s>
<s> To curb the phonecalls Microsoft changed the reported RAM to include all installed RAM but as you research this you find the same old 32 bit limits are still their. </s>
<s> Beyond that, apps are still limited to 2GB with one rare exception. </s>
<s> While interesting I'd skip any 32 bit Windows today. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> well i have 32:/// so i need to buy it again. </s>
