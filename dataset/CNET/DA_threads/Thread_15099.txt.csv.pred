1.1.1	I want some opinions out there .	St
1.1.2	If saving money and getting more for your money was your main concerns , what would be better , building your own PC from the ground up or buying a pre-configured one ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.3	I have a good source to build one , but I do n't know if I want all the hassle that goes along with that .	St
1.1.4	I 've had a PC built for me before by a family friend and it was just too much hassle to take it over and see if he had the time to fix it etc .	St
1.1.5	But I do n't want to pay huge inflated prices for a pre-config 'd system either , but have any repairs be easier .	St
1.1.6	The one I 'm considering has a few extended warranties built into the price already .	St
1.1.7	I 'm not a gamer , video editor-type , just a basic surfer , who does a little business on my system .	St
1.2.1	I 'm not a gamer .	St
1.2.2	If I price out the parts for a PC and a monitor and software I ca n't come close to what I can buy a package deal for .	St
1.2.3	But that assumes that all the parts of a pkg deal are of any value to you .	St
1.2.4	I 'm not looking to buy a new machine but every so often I visit Dell 's bargain shop ... ..nice stuff ... .yesterdays model ... .cheap .	St
1.2.5	There is a benefit to building your own .	St
1.2.6	You gain a certain amount of knowledge about how the parts fit together and when it does not work quite right 'you ' just go in an fix it .	St
1.3.1	low-end pcs ( $ 500 or so ) ca n't be beaten price-wise , but they are usually either bottom barrel components or have little , if any , expanision capabilities .	St
1.3.2	once you move up to a mid-range pc ( $ 1000 ) , building your own becomes more competitive .	St
1.3.3	when you build your own , you can choose where you want to put your money ( ram vs. cpu for example ) and tailor it far better than any custom configurator .	St
