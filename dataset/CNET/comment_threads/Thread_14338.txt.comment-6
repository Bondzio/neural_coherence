the date of that first post.
2005.
That says 2 things to me; 1] If the original poster was tracking this discussion in 2005, he probably no longer is.
2] The question the OP was asking then has probably been solved, in some way.
These forums are not a trading area or market place.
You may do better searching elsewhere on the internet for your stand.
Good luck in your search.
