7686	0	219495	2328093	NR	Ballinwithbach	11/21/06 6:34 AM	1.16409084E12	I recently purchased a D-Link DWA-542 desktop adaptor	and now the sound is somewhat corrupted. I mean that every minute or so music or DVDs or whatever seems to be warbled. I'm able to access the internet without a problem and I don't think that installing this hardware has interfered with the IRQ channels since sound is controlled by the mobo. Problem is, the drivers that came with the desktop adaptor were not XP verified. So if anyone could please tell me how to troubleshoot this, I'd be grateful.

Studdering occationally, as if my system is doing hard work, when really its just idle. I can tell something is happening because any audio playing will studder as if slowing down momentarily, as well as mouse speed studdering. I'm certain it has nothing to do with drm as suggested above, as it affects entire system, its just more noticable with audio playing (including game audio). i read people having problems with the drivers ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833127213 ), and that &quot;The chipset is made by atheros, which also is in the wpm7000 by linksys&quot; (from post in link above), but i can't seem to find the drivers for a wpm7000 by linksys, if it even exsists. this is really a pain in the ass. uninstalling the card gets rid of the problem, and it comes back when i reinstall it. its also auto starting the d-link wireless connection manager twice, so that two green bars appear in my notification area. i had a netgear wpn 311 who's drivers kept crashing to blue screen randomly, which is why i thought i was &quot;upgrading&quot; to this d-link card and router. so im not having the best of luck with wireless.

I figured out that the linksys drivers reffered are these : ( http://www-uk.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Download_C2&childpagename=UK%2FLayout&cid=1129319258516&packedargs=sku%3D1144912118458&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper ) the EU and AU version of the linksys card chipset is made by atheros, like the d-link cards. i tried this driver, and, while the card appears as WMP300N - Wireless-N PCI Adapter, it works, but still studders the same way (audio still studders). the studdering is making the mouse hard to controll too which is the biggest pain in the ass, cause i gotta photoshop for work.

Here's the article on the flip.	http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx It's a simple procedure that I've used a few hundred times to cure this. It's so simple that I do that first before doing anything else. Bob

7686	6	219495	2714693	2714691	shermanium	2/25/08 3:58 PM	1.20395508E12	also, i tried the DMA switch, no luck	forgive my ignorance, but what does switching the DMA of my IDE harddrive or cdrom help this issue with a driver for a network adapter card? or am i doing something wrong?

It's a quick, painless, no reboot procedure and we use that first to dismiss the usual. If this is unacceptable then please research it further or just take it to a repair counter. Bob
7686	8	219495	2714771	2714777	shermanium	2/25/08 5:47 PM	1.20396162E12	thanks	thanks for the reply, bob from what I can tell, both my primary and secondary are in DMA mode. i still seem to having the audio/video stutter issue thanks again for the reply i guess i will have to do more research
7686	9	219495	2714796	2714771	R. Proffitt	2/25/08 6:07 PM	1.20396282E12	The article above notes	We have to flip it to PIO and back in a specific manner since we can't tell if it's in DMA 0 or 5 or 6. If you decline the procedure I'd rather not explore all the other areas first. Bob
7686	10	219495	2714816	2714796	shermanium	2/25/08 6:34 PM	1.20396444E12	i will flip them both to PIO then back to DMA	i will do that now and i will let you know thanks!
7686	11	219495	2714817	2714816	shermanium	2/25/08 6:40 PM	1.2039648E12	ok	My primary channel devices 0 and 1 are both DMA mode 5 My secondary channel device 0 is mode 2 and device 1 is n/a
