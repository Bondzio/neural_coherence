<s> I first posted this in the Windows XP forums but it seems this is a software/hardware issue. </s>
<s> I'm having difficulty with my system booting. </s>
<s> I'm using Windows XP Pro. </s>
<s> The problem started while booting my system one morning and it froze midway through the process. </s>
<s> It was at the screen with the Windows XP logo and the boxes going across the progress bar, it would get roughly half done and then freeze. </s>
<s> I was able to log into the computer using the &quot;last known good configuration&quot; setting. </s>
<s> Windows informed me that the system had recovered from a serious error. </s>
<s> It said it was caused by a device driver. </s>
<s> The only thing I've changed recently on the system was the video card. </s>
<s> I installed a Radeon 9800 Pro about 2 weeks ago and up to this point it has worked fine. </s>
<s> But since I've gotten the system back up, I've tried reinstalling the drivers twice but to no avail. </s>
<s> Each time the system freezes during the boot process. </s>
<s> I've searched ATI's site for help but I haven't found anything that directly relates to my problem. </s>
<s> Screens now scroll strange (it's like it goes a screen at a time rather than a smooth scroll). </s>
<s> I've tried ScanDisk, Norton Anti-Virus, I've checked Spyware. </s>
<s> I then switched back to my old Radeon 8500LE card and the system boots fine. </s>
<s> I installed the drivers and there was no problem. </s>
<s> Could an insufficient power supply cause a freeze in the boot up? </s>
<s> Or is it likely a defective card? </s>
<s> Read http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ </s>
<s> You're new 9800 is far more demanding than your old 8500 model. </s>
<s> I would crtainly consider a new power supply in the 400W+ range. </s>
<s> Don't settle for a cheap one either, but at least get a 350W unit, but strongly suggest that 400W+. </s>
<s> Pricing isn't that bad, but better ones do cost, so be prepapred. </s>
<s> On top of that, since you mentioned it worked again after returning the old video card, don't try the new until the new p/s is installed. </s>
<s> You can further test by unhooking the CD drive(s) and verify under bios that they're gone for a temp. </s>
<s> fix and quick check. </s>
<s> If it boots up w/o a glitch, then p/s unit. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> So a lack of power could actually cause the boot sequence to stop midway through? </s>
<s> I had no idea. </s>
<s> How does this power supply look? </s>
<s> Is it too cheap? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=17-159-024&depa=0 </s>
<s> try removing some devices to see if the problem clears up (as the power draw decreases). </s>
<s> Disconnect the CD and floppy and see if it goes through a clean boot? </s>
<s> If yes add the devices back in one at a time until it fails. </s>
<s> If it always fails with the new video in, you probably need to look elsewhere. </s>
<s> Check file dates past last good configuration to see what else besides the drivers changed. </s>
<s> The Power Supply. </s>
<s> While I can't say your problems will go away by simply replacing the PSU, if you plan on upgrading your PC a properly rated PSU is a must. </s>
<s> Others will say their system is running fine on insufficient power....it is only a matter of time. </s>
<s> Your boot problems, I believe, are due to the card itself or flaky drivers. </s>
<s> Drivers not uninstalled before changing cards or out of date drivers can cause your ills. </s>
<s> ATI has been known for iffy drivers. </s>
<s> Install drivers from the CD? </s>
<s> I'd go to the site and get the most current. </s>
<s> Wish you luck, Tom </s>
<s> I tried the drivers from the ATI site three times and each time it caused the boot sequence to freeze up. </s>
<s> Then I tried the dirvers off the CD and had the same result. </s>
<s> The thing that really has me puzzled is the fact that the system worked fine for two weeks with the 9800. </s>
<s> I can't be sure if this will help you but I have a Radeon 9600 card that that has not worked properly with any issue of new drivers since September. </s>
<s> I posted my problem in these forums as well. </s>
<s> I waited through several new Catalyst sets thinking ATI would pick up on this if it were a driver issue. </s>
<s> My problem is that my monitor would go into what looked like a standby mode when the XP spash opened. </s>
<s> Then it would reboot and try again. </s>
<s> Eventually it would start but I received a message about recovering from a serious error pointing to the Radeon device or drivers. </s>
<s> So far the solution has been to use older drivers and wait for ATI to address the problem. </s>
<s> My OS is also XP Pro and my PSU is a 430w Antec. </s>
<s> The system is not overloaded with devices so I don't think my problem has anything to do with it since I have another computer with 9 IDE devices, a Radeon card and 3 more add in cards with only a 400w supply and it never wimpers. </s>
<s> Radeon has older drivers available so I'd get the oldest first and, if it works, move up as far as you can before the system hangs. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
<s> ....return/exchange the card. </s>
<s> If it's a few weeks old you shouldn't get a hassle about an exchange. </s>
<s> Good Luck, Tom </s>
