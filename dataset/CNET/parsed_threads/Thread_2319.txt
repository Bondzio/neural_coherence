<s> I didnt know whether to put this in the Case section or motherboards section But I thought more people in this section may know more about this! </s>
<s> I have a old Compaq p4 1.5 I was putting it in a new case for my little cousins and have ran into a few problems such as the Power switch hook up from the new case. </s>
<s> New case has plugs like this! </s>
<s> [IMG] http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/way_2_slo/PC2.jpg [/IMG] and here is a pic of the board [IMG] http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/way_2_slo/PC.jpg [/IMG] What I need is maybe a schematic of some sort. </s>
<s> That way I can put the pins in the correct spot. </s>
<s> I am a retard and pulled the wires out of the plug before I looked at it! </s>
<s> So now I have no idea how to wire this baby up. </s>
<s> Any help would be much appreciated Thanks in advance Jon! </s>
<s> You need to get a pin diagram/map for the front panel pin header on that motherboard. </s>
<s> Try to determine the motherboard make & model by inspection. </s>
<s> If you get it running Windows, you could Run Belarc Advisor to get the motherboard model number. </s>
<s> From there you should be able to download the motherboard manual. </s>
<s> You should be able to go to Compaq.com and go to the support page for your computer model name. </s>
<s> From there, you should be able to get motherboard info. </s>
<s> As a last resort, you can use the Intel recommended pin configuration for trial-and-error ( http://www.pctechguide.com/tutorials/MBoard_Panel.htm ). </s>
<s> But before resorting to guesswork, please tell us the exact model number of the Compaq computer. </s>
