Actually Dell did guide me through the install over the phone and we went through the Dell CD's one at a time.
With the &quot;Drivers and Utilities&quot; CD he followed a set procedure of which drivers to reinstall when.
I'm assuming he knew what he was doing.
So -- per my original post -- where might this leave me re the Epson driver(s) and how to install them?
Thanks.
