1979 - trs-80 level 1, 4k memory, cassette recorder input.
i made my first computer upgrade when i went to 16k.
still have a box of cassettes with games somewhere.
learned to tweak the system pretty well from articles by dennis bathory kisitz in 80-microcomputing.
learned native machine language to speed up some basic games.
the machine is still in by basement with the ten other machines i've had through the years.
