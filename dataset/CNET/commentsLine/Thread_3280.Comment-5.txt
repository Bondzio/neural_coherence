are disproportionately priced, it might be worthwhile to consider dual displays ...like two 23&quot; or 24&quot; equivalents.
i see great offers for monitors including dells on techbargains.com ....look right at the top of the webpage under 'top deals by product category'.
you'd probably spend the around the same amount but you'd have two displays ...more screen space and options if that would be any benefit to you.
let us know.
