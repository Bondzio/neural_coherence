<s> Sorry in advance for the length... </s>
<s> I couldn't really think of a good title to describe my problem, but that's as good as it could be, I guess. </s>
<s> Anyway, I've been doing a great deal of work on the hardware for my computer this summer, but I've been as careful as I can be. </s>
<s> The problems started around when I added a modem and installed SP2 for WinXP. </s>
<s> I turn the computer on, and at some point, it decides it doesn't want to work anymore. </s>
<s> Then, it just freezes up, and I cannot do anything, except reset - which sometimes doesn't work until I disconnect the power, wait till it all drains out, then plug it back up and set to work. </s>
<s> It's not the hard drive, because I put in a brand-new hard drive, and besides; it even locks up in BIOS sometimes. </s>
<s> Various things make me think it might be the power supply, but then again, I don't know - I still am learning about computer hardware. </s>
<s> SPECS --- PSU: Antec 300W MB: Intel Processor: Intel P4 (I think), 1.8 GHz RAM: Kingston DIMM (?) </s>
<s> 256 MB [PCI]Audio: Astron/Ensoniq/AudioPCI (Not sure - says all three) [AGP]Video: Some sort of AGP card with added S-Video support (Don't seem any names...) Case: It says MB on the front. </s>
<s> HDD: Western Digital 200 GB DVD: Lite-ON DVD +/- RW CD: LG CD-RW I also added an extra fan. </s>
<s> --- Any clue what could be up with this? </s>
<s> Also, what's up with the 20 pin AND 4 pin connectors that plug into the motherboard from the PSU? </s>
<s> I've seen 20 pin connectors, as well as 24, but never 20 + 4 (two separate connections). </s>
<s> Thanks, g'day. </s>

<s> Could be spyware,adware,etc. </s>
<s> Another reason would be the low amount of ram. </s>
<s> the power cable, you mean thye 4 pin connector that plugs into newer mobos? </s>
<s> not sure if yours needs that, and you understand about 24 pin cables. </s>
<s> i would highly recommend updating your drivers (video and sound) as that's where most problems begin. </s>
<s> what's your paging size set at? </s>
<s> i would upgrade ram, but xp can be used on 256mb. </s>

<s> &gt;&gt;spyware, adware... &gt;No; I forgot to mention... it was even with a new installation of Windows, and then again with a brand-new hard drive. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;power source/4 pin/etc &gt;My PC has a 300 watt power supply, with a 20 pin plus a 4 pin connector for the motherboard. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;updating drivers/paging size/ram &gt;Well, the thing is, it sometimes even locks up in the BIOS, as it gets ready to boot into Windows. </s>
<s> Anyway, I think the problem is most likely either in the motherboard, or the power supply, but I haven't another power supply that has the 20 & 4, so I can't try that. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions (thanks for those who have tried to help so far)? </s>
<s> Well, I tested the power supply the other day, and it ran fine, as well as the computer. </s>
<s> So the power supply works fine; now, I am thinking it is perhaps the motherboard, or maybe the RAM causing the PC to lock up. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on this? </s>
