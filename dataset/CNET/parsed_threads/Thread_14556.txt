<s> I was just told this video card was no good. </s>
<s> No good because of it's price. </s>
<s> My question is this. </s>
<s> It's a new Video Card with not 128MB RAM but with 512MB RAM. </s>
<s> Does this make any difference? </s>
<s> Well you know for future games. </s>
<s> Also crossfire only works if you have two video cards and two pci-e slots right, well and a mobo that can handle crossfire right? </s>

<s> in your original thread where you were NOT told it was no good, but that there were better cards for the same or lower price?? </s>
<s> I would suspect that the person could give you further basis for his reasons. </s>
<s> I know nothing about tvideo card performance, but have read many threads where a card with a lower amount of memory performed better than one with more memory. </s>
<s> There are other factors. </s>
<s> You know, I see a lot of that, the reply/new message thing. </s>
<s> I think people hit the Create a new message button instead of the reply message. </s>

<s> hey man I'm going to buy the new comp today so tell me which of all the video cards you posted is the best? </s>
<s> im not a hardcore gamer but I think ive heard of the nvidia 7800 gpu's. </s>
<s> knowledgeable about video cards. </s>
<s> Maybe make a post or email John Robie and ask him. </s>
<s> He is rather knowledgeable about them. </s>
<s> It is the interface that the memory is on that will tell you the speed, and in your case that is 128-bit. </s>
<s> Also the other variable is the clock speed of the memory. </s>
<s> However, think of the interface as the bottleneck. </s>
<s> You can have a 900MHz memory clock running on a 64-bit interface, it's going to be slow. </s>
<s> Ultimately look at the memory interface, 128-bit is fine for lower-end cards. </s>
<s> A note on memory size. </s>
<s> Most games right now do not use more than 128MB, and therefore 512MB would be considered unnessary at this point. </s>
<s> For the future we are seeing games that have more shaders and dynamic lighting for more realism. </s>
<s> And alot of games are also depend heavily on the CPU. </s>
<s> I would still buy the Sapphire X1600Pro, this card can run with a 6600GT while the vanilla X1300 is performing near a 6200. </s>
<s> A 7800GT is overkill for ZooTycoon games. </s>
<s> And you will definitely have to upgrade the powersupply to alteast 400watts. </s>
<s> A vanilla X1300 may run on a 300watt, but the X1300Pro wants a 350watt or greater. </s>
<s> Also the quality of the PSU is also important as well. </s>
<s> Make sure you have 12V rails... What computer are you buying? </s>
<s> He sums up the previous post nicely when looking for a second opinion. </s>
<s> Too bad hes going to get the same opinions... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The x1300 is the entry-level GPU from ATI. </s>
<s> Consider these benchmarks: http://www.hothardware.com/viewarticle.aspx?page=13&articleid=734&cid=2 http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1875353,00.asp The x1300 is slower than a 6600gt and x1600xt yet those cards are only $140 (compared to the $200 price for the x1300). </s>
<s> To quote ExtremeTech: &quot;We're starting to see a pattern: ATI's new low-end card is slower than all the other cards in its price range.&quot; Every card I mentioned in my previous post will PERFORM MUCH BETTER than the x1300 and cost less than $200. </s>
<s> Many articles have proven that 512MB offers no benefit except at super-high resolutions (1600x1200 and higher) with 8xAA. </s>
<s> The x1300 cannot support those resolutions. </s>
<s> At 800x600 and 1024x768 (which is really all that card can do smoothly), 128MB is adequate and 256MB is more than enough. </s>
<s> 512MB is just marketing gimmick on this card... like putting a spoiler on Kia. </s>
<s> It may look cool, but it won't make it go any faster! </s>
