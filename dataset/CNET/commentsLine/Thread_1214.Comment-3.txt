i use an ati tv capture device that is external and hooks up through a usb 2.0 port.
the advantages are: 1. it has its own power supply so it doesn't tax the pc, 2. i didn't have to open the pc case to install, 3. it has no perceptible lag time between the broadcast signal and what is diplayed on the screen, 4. it has coaxial, s-video and rca jacks for input which covers almost every device.
