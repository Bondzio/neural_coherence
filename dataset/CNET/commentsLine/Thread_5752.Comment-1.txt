i already have my os as well as other software programs installed on my western digital hdd.
i doubt it's possible because all the software is already installed on my current hdd, but i would like to add another of the exact same western digital hard drive in conjunction with my current hard drive to create a raid 0 or stripped system.
does anyone know if this is possible, and, if so, how i would go about it?
my second question about a raid 0 system is if it is possible to backup all its files onto an external hdd?
