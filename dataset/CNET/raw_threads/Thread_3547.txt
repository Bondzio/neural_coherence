Over the last year I've replaced everything but the motherboard and HDD which is a 320GB Samsung SATA HDD. Well now the HDD is starting to make a gring sound and failed to boot thrice. The bios came up on start but no OS until rebooting several times.Fans turned and everything lit up. I ordered this &gt;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/WD-Blue-Desktop-Hard-Drive/dp/B0088PUEPK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377289650&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=WD+Blue+1+TB+Desktop+Hard+Drive%3A+3.5+Inch%2C+7200+RPM%2C+SATA+6+Gb%2Fs%2C+64+MB+Cache+-+WD10EZEX and it's 1TB. When I install the os from my Image Disc will it formatt the whole disc so I can use it or will I need to create partitions? I will also be install some flavor of Linux. Thanks for your time Digger

When I use the Win 7 Image Disc's, It will do just that , give me an image of my 320 GB hdd. can use Acronis or something else to create other partitions for Linux or games or whatever. I still might need some coaching though. I've never installed a New hdd. Let the New Learning Experience Begin......Digger

5363	3	599948	5490154	5490166	itsdigger	8/23/13 6:01 PM	1.37728086E12	well no	I'm not sure about that but I am sure that the only thing going on the new hard drive is whats on the image discs I made but not sure what else to do yet.

You can get the computer working without it if you reinstall, but you never know when you're going to need to restore to factory settings. In fact you might want to do that with the new drive so you don't have the hassle of finding and installing the right ones with the new hard drive. I imagine you've seen posts in this forum where folks have reinstalled from scratch and had all kinds of driver problems - something you'd do well to avoid when you can. ` Good luck.

Just remember that Windows 7 can put boot info on other partitions unless you're using what came from Dell. This of course means that just saving and restoring C: isn't enough when the boot info is on a different partition. ` Good luck.

If you've installed it on a partition with Windows, it can really complicate things. If this is the case, I'd say rule #1 applies.
5363	7	599948	5490432	5490431	itsdigger	8/24/13 10:49 AM	1.37734134E12	well than wpg	would I be better off using the original disc's that came with the computer instead of using my image disc's ?
5363	8	599948	5490440	5490407	wpgwpg	8/24/13 10:50 AM	1.3773414E12	Rule #1	Rule #1: Know what you're doing!
5363	9	599948	5490425	5490432	wpgwpg	8/24/13 10:56 AM	1.37734176E12	What do you have on C:?	Digger, what do you have on the C: partition? If you have just Windows 7 with its boot info and no Linux, I'd go for a good backup/restore program like Ghost or Easeus. The Control Panel's Administrative Tools -&gt; Computer Management -&gt; Disk tool will tell you if C: has the boot info. Like I say though, if you've installed Linux inside that C: partition, you might want to go with the discs to restore to factory settings. It gets real complicated in this case.

5363	11	599948	5490443	5490441	wpgwpg	8/24/13 11:06 AM	1.37734236E12	(NT) Is the boot info on C: as well?	NIL
5363	12	599948	5490426	5490443	itsdigger	8/24/13 11:11 AM	1.37734266E12	everythings on C	this is pretty pretty much the way it was from the factory only a bunch of new parts I replaced. This is my learning/play machine.
5363	13	599948	5490445	5490426	wpgwpg	8/24/13 11:18 AM	1.37734308E12	Then where does the Vista/Windows 7 upgrade	Then where does the Vista/Windows 7 upgrade come into the picture? Vista is a complicating variable I don't understand. Also I'd use that Control Panel applet I mentioned earlier to verify that the boot info is actually on C:.
5363	14	599948	5490437	5490445	itsdigger	8/24/13 11:20 AM	1.3773432E12	well it only has one hard drive so and everythings on it	putting the hdd in now
5363	15	599948	5490488	5490092	itsdigger	8/24/13 12:39 PM	1.37734794E12	well that was simple	I installed the new hdd and used my system image disc's to load theOS. The new Hdd put 294.09 GB on the C drive, 4.00 GB Health Primary Partition and 633.42 Unallocated. Now I'm gonna change the optical drive than I'll play with that unallocated space . I'll be wanting to put a Linux Distro on there .....Digger
5363	16	599948	5490518	5490488	wpgwpg	8/24/13 1:54 PM	1.37735244E12	Good to hear - put Linux in a SEPARATE partition	Congratulations, Digger! It's a great feeling when something like that comes and runs like you want it to. When you get ready to install Linux, but sure to put it in a separate partition because it gets very complicated otherwise. Also even in a separate partition, once you install Linux you can't resize any partitions without making everything unbootable. This is the voice of experience! So be sure you've got your partitions set up like you'll want them for the rest of that hard drive's life before installing it.
5363	17	599948	5490548	5490518	itsdigger	8/24/13 2:06 PM	1.37735316E12	we'll be talking about that	soon WPG. I'm gonna start a &quot;How Too&quot; thread about that in the Linux forum so we can share the info with other people. Other folks will be interested in my question....Digger
