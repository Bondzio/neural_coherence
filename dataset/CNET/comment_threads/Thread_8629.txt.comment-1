Hi, I have an external WD Passport with 120GB of storage, formatted as FAT32.
Somewhere on this forum I heard that FAT32 storage is bad because it can break more easily then NTFS.
Should I reformat the WD passport as NTFS, what exactly is the difference.
To do this I'm guessing you Right Click --&gt; format --&gt;OK?
Thanks
