With power cord in, I tried resetting per the dlink website, but after several seconds of holding the reset button in, it stays frozen. I also tried something called a &quot;recovery reset&quot; and that didn't work either. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks!

I wasn't sure if that was too long. I didn't know what the expiration date for it would be. Just hoping for an alternative solution. Thanks for your advice.
