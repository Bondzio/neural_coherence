i bought the his radeon x1550 64 bit to help update my system, but i'm having a few problems and i have a few questions.
my gpu history was a diamond 9250 256mb ddr 128bit, then i got a pny 8400gs 512mb gddr2 64bit card, returned the 8400gs for fianance reasons, saved up and bought this instead.
both the 8400 and this are 64 bit, they both had problems with madden 06, glitchy, but the 9250 was perfect, at about medium settings.
if you know how to fix this please tell me.
next the gpu-z program says my bus bandwith is like 3.1 gb/s.
but the 8400 ran at 6.4 and so did the 9250 radeon, they both only required a 300 watt psu(i have a 250) but the x1550 says it needs 450watt, and on the tigerdirect site it said that it had a 12.8gb/s banwith, and the his site said 6.4gb/s(more beilivable) would this be a psu issue or something else i really want that bandwith, or could it be gpu-z.
