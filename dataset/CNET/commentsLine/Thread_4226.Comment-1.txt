we have a lacie porche external hard drive that we use for backup.
we lent it to our daughter wednesday.
today we tried to reinstall it but are having problems.
actually, it did come up once but it froze our system.
since then we have been unable to bring the hard drive up.
we are using windows xp.
how can we reinstall this drive without having problems?
thanks.
