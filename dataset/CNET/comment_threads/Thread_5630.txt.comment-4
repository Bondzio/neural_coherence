Okay, thank you both much...
I know that 512's enough, I was just wondering if it was worth it to use the extra stick of RAM, but I kind of figured that the overall performance would be better without the slower stick, as Stan said, though I knew there'd be no harm in asking.
Thanks again, good day to you all.
