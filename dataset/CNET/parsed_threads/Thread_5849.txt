<s> My buddy expects me to do everything technical with his computer. </s>
<s> I have NO experience with wireless. </s>
<s> I installed a new computer for him and it is great. </s>
<s> He uses a laptop as part of his job (he is an engineer) and wants me to connect his laptop wirelessly to his fixed DSL destop computer. </s>
<s> I am looking for the best suggestions from you guys with a plug and play mindset. </s>
<s> I would love to just plug something in the USB port and have his laptop find it and be able to use the DSL connection. </s>
<s> Choice is PCI or USB and security is an issue. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help:) </s>
<s> The best option is to create a home network by purchasing a wireless router. </s>
<s> Or you can install a wireless NIC in the desktop, bridge the wireless and Ethernet connections, and enable Internet Connection Sharing. </s>
<s> Either way you will have to do some homework to learn the basics. </s>
<s> Darton Fury gave you good tips. </s>
<s> I highly recommend purchasing a wireless broadband router. </s>
<s> Some DSL modems are actually combination modem-wireless router devices, so you need to confirm what model your buddy is already using before spending money on a wireless broadband router. </s>
<s> Regarding security, make sure that both the wireless broadband router and any wireless network adapter you use supports WPA-2 encryption. </s>
<s> WEP and and WPA are not as secure as once thought. </s>
