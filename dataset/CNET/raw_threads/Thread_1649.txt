5074	0	300121	2805624	NR	cyprusx	7/4/08 10:55 PM	1.2152121E12	Can Anyone Help Me?	I recently bought a new computer. Was very pleased with it (4600AMD,2gb ram) .The graphics card is an Gigabyte Geforce 8600GT 512. Works like a charm with the latest drivers installed. However yesterday I connected the tv-out converter for the first time and connected the graphics card to my standard PAL tv using an old fashion composite cable. I then turned on my computer and everything 3D including all games had Green Square checkerboard pattern. Re formating doesn't Help and there is maximum air flow. I Have searched the whole internet and it turns out other people have had this problem but no one has a solution. Can anyone here help me?
