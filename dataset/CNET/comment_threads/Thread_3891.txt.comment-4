I want to disagree, reason I feel that I have no internet or can't go online with my PS3 is that for some reason, the modem seems to shut down after I reconfigure.
NOW: CPU---CABLE (COX) MODEM---PHONE----with cable cord going into modem from wall.
AFTER: CPU---ROUTER----CABLE (COX) MODEM----PHONE----with cable cord going into modem from wall Before, after the reconfigure the link light on modem went out.
So after a week and being frustrated from not being able to play SOCOM for PS3 (ONLINE ONLY GAME wtf) I just added a USB from modem to CPU (so I have two connections to CPU--MODEM) I will just try USB after work....But the PS3 shows the NETGEAR router at 47% to 55% signal strenghtjust can't get internet light to light up on Router....I change IP address from another thread I seen on CNET and still nothing.... You call COX and get &quot;We don't support NETGEAR&quot; and you call NETGEAR and you can here LOCAL TV stations saying it's 80 degrees here in Mumbai, India today...
