1.1.1	alright i have a belkin router with 1 labtop ethernet wired , 1 host computer wired , and 1 desktop computer going wireless .	St
1.1.2	On the computer going wireless everytime i seem to play Counterstrike ( for those who know what i 'm talking about ) i would walk walk walk , then just randomly lag and get this HUGE lag spike for about 3 seconds , then its fine .	St
1.1.3	Occurs occasionally no idea why ... then after maybe about 1 hr - 2 hrs ... the wireless connection goes down .	St
1.1.4	So then i just right click my wireless connection icon and press repair.. ALL SET ... an hour later connection goes back down ... its starting to annoy me.. plz help	St
1.2.1	the only thing i can think of right now is that your machine may be set to switch off your wireless connection to save power .	St
1.2.2	right click 'my computer ' and select 'properties ' go to the 'hardware ' tab and then click on 'device manager ' locate 'network adaptors ' and click the little [ + ] next to it , double click on your wireless adaptor and then go to one of the end tabs , possibly called 'power ' ( cant really remember right now cos i 'm not using a windows pc ) clear any check marks that say something like & quot ; allow the computer to turn this device off to save power & quot ; this may or may not cure your problem .	St
1.2.3	like i say it 's all i can think of right now .	St
1.2.4	as for your LAG , are you within range of you wireless router , and have a good signal .	St
1.2.5	could anything be interferring with the signal .	St
1.2.6	i would expect a slight delay ( fractions of a second ) due to the lower bandwidth of a wirelss conection , but nothing that big .	St
1.2.7	it 's rediculous !	St
1.2.8	good luck , hope this helps	Polite
