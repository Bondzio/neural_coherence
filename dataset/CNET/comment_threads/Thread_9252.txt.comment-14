I purchased a 4GB PNY flash drive about three months ago.
Up until last week, it functioned OK even though it would constantly open when I carried it in my pocket.
Last week, it got bent while in our laptop computer's USB port.
The plug will still snap closed, but I sometimes have to pry it out of the enclosure.
And for about four days now, when I plug it in the USB port of our laptop (Windows 7), I hear the sound that indicates the computer recognizes the device, but the device doesn't appear in the list of removable media.
When I plug it into the desktop PC (WinXP), I see the removable drive in the list of drives, but when I click on it, I get the message &quot;Please insert a disk into drive [letter]:&quot; Any way to recover what's on this disk?
