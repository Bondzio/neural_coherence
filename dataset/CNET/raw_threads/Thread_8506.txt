We're having it wired for gigabit and are considering a gigabit switch. We have some new Dells with gigabit adaptors but some workstations are 100T. I read somewhere that your lowest connection speed is what everyone else runs at as well. Is this true? Will everyone with gigabit adaptors still run at 100T if even one computer does? Thanks. Johnny
