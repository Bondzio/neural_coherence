<s> I own a dvd burner with 4x burning on dvd+/-r media and 2.4x on dvd+/-rw. </s>
<s> I recently bought some 8x dvd+r media from memorex and I have a problem. </s>
<s> I can only burn at 1x my applications do not let me choose any other speed other than 1x and I've tried multiple applications. </s>
<s> I've noticed something different with the dvd media. </s>
<s> It says dvd+r but above the letters it has a logo with the letters &quot;rw&quot; in it. </s>
<s> It's like a square box with the two letters rw in it. </s>
<s> What does this mean? </s>
<s> It's obviously dvd+r media because the backside is purplish but it has a rw symbol and my burner can only record at 1x. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me out and tell me what this means? </s>
<s> I'm so confused!!! </s>
<s> I've been burning dvds for a whole year now, I don't get it. </s>
<s> How can I fix this problem? </s>
<s> HELP PLEASE!! </s>
<s> THANK YOU!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I have 5 recorders and Memorex dvds are not even recognised in any of them, First try another brand. </s>
<s> RW means read and write. </s>
<s> RW disks act like a floppy in that you can use them over and over like a floppy.Also they run at a slower recording speed. </s>
<s> (the 2.4 or less). </s>
<s> there is a free program called DVD info that you can get from a google search that will tell you all kinds of imformation on a disk inserted in your drive. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
