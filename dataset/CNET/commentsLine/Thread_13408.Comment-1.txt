i need help connenting my new printer (canon pixma mp620) to my new macbook pro.
i had no problem connecting the printer to my pc (dell xps 200,intel pentium d,3gb ram,running xp sp2)via a usb connection or wirelessly.
i connect through att 2wire gateway.
i have no problem using the internet with my mac but it doesnt detect my printer.i've read of others having problems with connecting a printer wirelessly with a mac but havent been able to get mine figured out.
any help/advice greatly appreciated.
