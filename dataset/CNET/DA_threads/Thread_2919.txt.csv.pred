1.1.1	Has your hard drive ( s ) failed on you before ?	Ques
1.1.2	-- Yes .	St
1.1.3	( How so , and were you able to recover the data ? )	Ques
1.1.4	-- No .	St
1.1.5	( Lucky you !	St
1.1.6	Anything you want to share about your luck ? )	Ques
1.1.7	-- Not yet , but I 'm starting to encounter some problems now .	St
1.1.8	( What problems , and have you backed up your data ? )	Ques
1.1.9	Share your experience with us if your hard drive has failed on you before .	St
1.1.10	Let us know what the end results were , was your data recoverable ( if yes , how was it recovered ) or was it lost forever ?	Ques
1.2.1	On my web server .	St
1.2.2	I back up my site regularly to DVD and external HD .	St
1.2.3	And every month or so I clone the entire drive to another external drive .	St
1.2.4	Bummer that it failed , but inserting the cloned drive put the system back on line in minutes , and adding the backups was easy .	St
1.2.5	I do n't go for the backup software .	St
1.2.6	I also clone my main PC drive to yet another external drive .	St
1.2.7	Recovery is ten times faster and simpler than restoring a backup .	St
1.3.1	A friend who is a real techie put it in the freezer .	St
1.3.2	Then , because he is very good and very fast , he installed the frozen hard drive into his computer and recovered and saved the info to another hard drive .	St
1.3.3	Then he fixed it good enough to store info and things like game patches .	St
1.4.1	I run Ghost12 on my PC and Acronis10 on my Laptop , both are image backup utilities so if either Hard Drive were to fail , I could be up and running in 36 minutes .	St
1.4.2	How do I know this ?	Ques
1.4.3	well I did a test run on the PC .	St
1.4.4	I purchased a new Hard Drive , took out the working one , put in the new one and did the image transfer .	St
1.4.5	I am still working from that image backup HD .	St
1.4.6	The initial HD I re-formatted and used it as my external backup HD for Acronis on my Laptop .	St
1.4.7	I know both Acronis and Ghost cost money , but for me a great investment and over time very reasonably priced I think .	St
1.4.8	So , I suggest you use image software then never worry about Hard Drive failure at all	St
1.5.1	Fortunately , I always keep disk image backups , and store multiple copies of important data on separate machines , external media , and online .	St
1.6.1	Paragon Drive Backup Express is free for personal use .	St
1.6.2	Get it here .	St
1.7.1	The only time my HDD failed was on a then 12-year-old Toshiba Sat Pro 400 CDT .	St
1.7.2	Did n't bother fixing it since I did n't have any important data on it ; except for Dark Forces and DOOM .	St
1.8.1	First , i had the hard disk on my Dell Optiplex break , no notice , it just stopped working .	St
1.8.2	The computer was just used for web browsing , so no important files to loose .	St
1.8.3	Just last week my 3 month old external hard disk broke , and the bad part is that it was the actual drive , not the casing circuits .	St
1.8.4	I had just reformatted my laptop , and this was where all of my archived files were .	St
1.8.5	I just hope Hitachi will send me a replacement , and i can find some software to recover the files .	St
1.9.1	Lost the hard drive in a not quite 3 yr old HP .	St
1.9.2	Luckily had the extended warranty with Geek Squad .	St
1.9.3	They replaced the hard drive BUT due to GS first telling me it was a software problem -- I took the CPU to another company ( FireDog ) .	St
1.9.4	The 2nd company was able to recover my hard drive and then I took the CPU back to GS to have it replaced .	St
1.9.5	Then BACK to Firedog to have them reinstall the information they burned to a CD .	St
1.9.6	Luckily I 'm not into downloading music or storing photos so much of my material was text .	St
1.10.1	I made a mistake & downloaded SP 2 for my pc running xt , after I installed it however I started having stop errors as many as 10 times in one day !	St
1.10.2	Pointing at everything in the pc !	St
1.10.3	Dell eventually replaced the drive .	St
1.10.4	I ordered sp2 on cd from microsoft , but it took me several months to work up enough courage to try to install from the cd , d & # 8144 ; id so finally & never had another problem .	St
1.10.5	Rich	St
1.11.1	It was a new Seagate Barracuda 320GB ( 3mths old , SATA - seemed to be a spate of these at one point which quickly tailed off ) It was a platter defect I believe - after a normal shut down it lost the boot sector and MBR - I was unable to restore either and had quite a bit of stuff I did not have duplicated on other drives in some form so after a SpinRite session which found the data areas to be fine , and no luck with free recovery applications , I bought a copy of Seagate 's recovery software .	St
1.11.2	Found all my files , and then some - internet cache ...	St
1.11.3	Except for a few mp3s the data was intact .	St
1.11.4	I then nuked the drive and tried a clean install on it - it failed right after the 1st reboot so it got RMA 'd	St
1.12.1	Paid a lot of money for a RAID 1 - if your main drive goes bad slowly you will lose the mirror .	St
1.12.2	It happened to me twice .	St
1.12.3	Viruses take both out also ( I Know - duh ) but the point is - can not use either to get the data off .	St
1.12.4	I lost both to a power surge - Lightening strike while the machine was off .	St
1.12.5	Now I have an internal 3rd drive using Norton and backing up the Raid - also two external drives which I alternate and backup the files .	St
1.12.6	I used the refrigerator trick and it worked - also sent one out for recovery and $ 500 later got most of the data back .	St
1.12.7	The biggest pain - reregistering software bought on line - find the old emails - contacting the companies .	St
1.12.8	The very worst - PTC engineering software - it took me weeks to get it installed and reconnected back into the server .	St
1.12.9	Some software upgrades require the loading of previous versions - MathCAD and Pinnacle ( have to go back 3 versions ) .	St
1.12.10	As much as I hate it - I buy the CD backups or you can spend weeks re-downloading everything .	St
1.12.11	Sure getting the data back is important but having to reload everything to include all the updates - is insane - mirror is the way to go .	St
1.12.12	If you are using RAID 0 - get ready the data is split between the drives - so what you actually retrieve is a crap shoot - unless you really pay attention - so which drive goes out ?	Ques
1.12.13	You are about to enter the twilite zone .	St
1.13.1	Three times in the company I worked for .	St
1.13.2	They were NOT happy when I insisted that they buy a NEW hard drive to replace the one ( s ) that failed , but when I got back ALL the data on the drives , they were thrilled .	St
1.13.3	I used File Scavenger .	St
1.13.4	I took a computer with a & quot ; blown & quot ; drive home , used a new hard drive in a hard case ( making it a second hard drive ) and ran it overnight .	St
1.13.5	No one noticed any difference .	St
1.13.6	And , after I did a format several times on the & quot ; blown & quot ; drives , they worked a charm , so the purchase of the new drives was not so much the blow to the budget they thought .	St
1.13.7	I used those drives to back up the idiots who lost the drives in the first place ( IIC did not want me to back up anything but the server ) .	St
1.13.8	Now that I 'm gone , I hear the entire server when belly up -- second time in two years -- and I am SO glad I 'm not there anymore .	St
1.13.9	I 've tried Spin Right on new boss ' computer , but did n't work -- File Scavenger did the work for me .	St
1.13.10	New that boss has a & quot ; blown & quot ; drive and the people she 's hired has said : get a new computer .	St
1.13.11	Well , she simply can not afford that right now .	St
1.13.12	I 'm telling her that I can TRY to get her drive back .	St
1.13.13	Plus , she has two other computers just sitting there .	St
1.13.14	The tech she hired told her they are & quot ; too full & quot ; to be rescued .	St
1.13.15	Baloney .	St
1.13.16	Get rid of all the stuff those folks downloaded -- music mostly -- and they will be just fine .	St
1.13.17	They are in the business of SELLING computers and I can not get her to understand that .	St
1.13.18	She 's been completely scared by her brother who worked there after I went on leave of absence , and she 's scared of me .	St
1.13.19	Sheesh .	St
1.13.20	What good would it do for me to mess up computers that she 's already been told are useless ?	Ques
1.13.21	I ca n't get that little bit through her head , bless her heart .	St
1.14.1	https : //www.grc.com/sr/testimonials.htm Pretty much the best HD recovery system	St
1.15.1	Yes Started getting windows system warning messages my harddrive was failing , and to backup critical files immediately ( or something to that effect ) I ignored it for about a week & then started to worry - I consulted my brother-in-law , a retired HP guru - well long & short I followed the advise he 'd been giving me for years and installed a second harddrive in the PC - created a Ghost ( Norton Ghost 2003 ) image on the new harddrive , and boot to that drive now - scrapped the old drive .	St
1.15.2	Now doing Ghost image back-ups on all PC 's in the house kids , wife 's no worries .	St
1.16.1	Yes !	St
1.16.2	Mine was a result of my own carelessness .	St
1.16.3	I did two & quot ; updates & quot ; for two differant programs : Windows XP and a spyware program .	St
1.16.4	Both required a reboot to finish installing the program .	St
1.16.5	When I rebooted I got to the & quot ; loading Windows & quot ; screen and never progressed past that .	St
1.16.6	It would not boot in safe mode either .	St
1.16.7	Nothing I tried worked .	St
1.16.8	I finally took it to my tech and he had to reinstall Windows over the old one ... twice .	St
1.16.9	Most of my programs and data were unharmed , however , there were some programs I had to reinstall and there is at least one program ( which I used a lot ) which I can not access even after reinstalling it ... twice .	St
1.16.10	The lesson learned : UPDATE ONLY ONE PROGRAM AT A TIME , ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF A REBOOT TO COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION !	St
1.17.1	I have been messing with PCs since the beginning ( think I still have a 10 mb drive around here somewhere ) and I have never ( ! )	St
1.17.2	had a WD drive fail out of the 15 or so drives used .	St
1.17.3	Now that its been said , watch disaster strike soon .	St
1.18.1	I own 3 Macs and a PC , and in the last five years I 've had to replace 2 hard drives on my PC and one in one of my Mac laptops .	St
1.18.2	The first PC failure was out of the blue -- I booted up one morning and it just would n't recognize the hard drive .	St
1.18.3	It was replaced under warranty , and even though the techies swore that the drive was toasted I made sure to get the original drive back so I could crack it open and destroy the media inside ; no need to risk my personal data being taken off of it .	St
1.18.4	On a lark I decided to purchase a hard drive enclosure and see if I could read the old drive ... good thing !	St
1.18.5	I 've been using the original drive as a secondary hard drive for the last five years without trouble !	St
1.18.6	I was even able to get ALL of my data off of it .	St
1.18.7	So for the cost of a $ 20 enclosure I learned that techies do n't know everything .	St
1.18.8	The other times I was lucky enough to recognize the first signs of trouble and back up my hard drive in time to prevent the loss of any data .	St
1.18.9	I now have two external hard drives -- both from the crash of my PC drives that techies swore were no good .	St
1.18.10	When my Mac drive crashed , it made a really bad screeching noise , so I 'm did n't bother trying to salvage that one !	St
1.19.1	I have had two HDD failures .	St
1.19.2	The first one manifested itself with some warnings flashed up on screen of read errors .	St
1.19.3	I ignored the first warnings but soon had to take notice , as the frequency increased .	St
1.19.4	A friend suggested that I buy Acronis True Image software and back the drive up pronto .	St
1.19.5	I did this and then made the new drive the master .	St
1.19.6	I was able to patch up the read errors with various re-loads of software and copies of missing data .	St
1.19.7	This was a slow and tedious process .	St
1.19.8	I then installed a slave HDD and aportioned the two drives , primary for software and secondary for data .	St
1.19.9	I also bought an external USB HDD .	St
1.19.10	I now back up each internal drive to the other and both to the external drive .	St
1.19.11	I do this about once per week .	St
1.19.12	My second failure was more dramatic .	St
1.19.13	The drive just stopped working .	St
1.19.14	The only problem for me was the relatively minor cost of buying a replacement drive and installing it with the backed up data restored to it .	St
1.20.1	GetDataBack & gt ; excellent ... but have to pay seperate for FAT32 and NSTF	St
1.21.1	I had a hard drive failure on my 2 year old Vaio desktop .	St
1.21.2	I was very distraught as I was in the middle of an important photo archival procedure .	St
1.21.3	I took it in to Geek Squad who told me none of my data could be recovered , but I could pay up over a thousand dollars to send it off and try and get it recovered and there was no guarantee .	St
1.21.4	I ended up looking in the phone book and found a local guy who went to Geek Squad , picked up my hard drive , recovered all my data , replaced the HD and loaded up all my programs for less than $ 200 .	St
1.22.1	I 've had five drive failures so far , one being Maxtor internal , three La Cie drives , and one OEM ( unknown manufacture ) internal .	St
1.22.2	The La Cie drives were fine after puting the internal IDE drive into new enclosures ( Avastor ) and throwing out the La Cie enclosures ( never will buy that brand again ) , the Maxtor drive was OK after freezing it overnight , letting it warm up slightly and then puting that into an enternal Avastor enlosure .	St
1.22.3	The unknown OEM drive became food for worms .	St
1.22.4	Nothing I could do for it .	St
1.22.5	Luckily I always back up my entire internal on an external once a week .	St
1.22.6	There are places that can gather data off of ruined drives , even fire victims , but it 's extremely expensive .	St
1.22.7	These drives of mine were all backed up .	St
1.22.8	This is a lesson actually : back it up just in case .	St
1.22.9	Almost everyone will eventually have a total or partial failure .	St
1.23.1	The first time was a hardware malfunction .	St
1.23.2	I noticed the drive making extra noises but was able to make a full backup of all my data ( which I was not doing regularly ) .	St
1.23.3	Whew !	St
1.23.4	The second was when I got up from the dining room table , caught my foot on my notebook 's power cord and sent it crashing to the hardwood floor .	St
1.23.5	The computer would not power up , but upon replacing it and plugging in the damaged drive as an external one , it turned out that only some sectors were bad and I was able to recover most of my data , which , again was not recently backed up .	St
1.23.6	Whew !	St
1.23.7	Now , with external drives as cheap as they are and the cost of data recovery so high , I have a couple of external backups and also archive everything that will no longer be modified , such as original photos and ripped music ( I back up all my CDs ) , onto discs ( two copies in the case of photos ) .	St
1.24.1	Yes it has happened to me 6 months back .	St
1.24.2	Bought a recovery CD from spotmau .	St
1.24.3	Intially the downloaded version did not work for soe reason .	St
1.24.4	I asked for money to be returned back and in the meantime recieved the original copy of the CD which I tried and to my surprise it worked .	St
1.24.5	I mailed them back and told them that I would be keeping the CD .	St
1.24.6	I am not sure how much it costs- probably around 30 .	Res
1.25.1	I found myself staring at a black ( not blue ) screen that announced & quot ; irreversible disk failure & quot ; ( or words to that effect ) , then the screen disappeared and I could n't restart the computer .	St
1.25.2	I have a Dell computer with XP on disk C , which was utterly , entirely , and completely gone with the wind .	St
1.25.3	Fortunately , with some sort of prescience , when I had the computer put together by Dell , I ordered two physical hard drives .	St
1.25.4	Thus , all my data is on drive D , so although Dell had to replace one drive , all my photos , manuscripts ( I 'm a writer ) and other irreplaceable data were untouched .	St
1.25.5	But now I do n't trust any hard drive , and have multiple backups -- an external hard drive , and Carbonite online .	St
1.25.6	Now , whatever problems I have , I will only have to contend with inconvenience , not real loss .	St
1.25.7	I strongly advise everyone to back up , everything , every time .	St
1.25.8	MKA	St
1.26.1	I 've been buying a new computer about every two years , and so far have had only one major problem , on a HP Pavilion .	St
1.26.2	However , that was not a hard drive , but a total motherboard failure .	St
1.26.3	As it was still under original warranty , it was fixed free of charge .	St
1.26.4	About 15 years now with no hard drive problems .	St
1.26.5	Hope this does n't jinx me .	St
1.27.1	I have one box that is all SCSI and has been bullet proof for almost seven years .	St
1.27.2	It had all IBM drives because IBM was previously the only vendor offering a five year replacement warranty on their drives .	St
1.27.3	I 'm a firm believer in & quot ; you get what you pay for & quot ; .	St
1.27.4	Four of the six 36GB drives died within 3-4 months but I ca n't really complain .	St
1.27.5	7-8 years of very hard usage and almost daily reboots with no errors .	St
1.27.6	Anyway , they started taking random data errors and finally two of them refused to spin up so I ordered 5 OEM Fujitsu 36 GB drives and a WD Raptor ( SATA 2.0 ) 36 GB for the primary boot drive .	St
1.27.7	Data recovery is trivial .	St
1.27.8	I am a fanatic about taking backups at least once a week to one of the two drives which are dedicated backup devices .	St
1.27.9	Once a month I burn the entire C drive to DVD ( s ) and take that off site to the bank lock box .	St
1.27.10	The house could burn down and at worst I would be out 30 days of work .	St
1.27.11	I also take backups of the Linux partitions when I am doing serious mucking with the OS .	St
1.27.12	One of the machines is a triple boot ( openSuSE , Fedora , and Vista all 64 bit ) , the other main box ( with the SCSI drives ) is a dual boot openSuSE and Vista x86 .	St
1.27.13	But I am going to nuke it with OpenSolaris x86 and use the entire box for a Solaris machine RSN .	St
1.27.14	I like toys !	St
1.27.15	Oh yeah , I only use Acronis products for backup/recovery/disk partitioning .	St
1.27.16	The only problem I have had with their latest versions is the inability to handle the Linux 2.6 kernel default inode size ( 256 vs 128 ) .	St
1.27.17	They have sent me custom ISO images for both Disk Director and True Image Echo but these still have the issue with the reformatted partitions .	St
1.27.18	However , if you preallocate the Linux partitions with Disk Director 10.0 ( current GA ) and then do not reformat with the Linux utilities during the install , there is no problem taking the Linux partition backups .	St
1.27.19	I have an open ticket and I 'm their test guinea pig because I beat the H out their software .	St
1.27.20	Waiting for the DD 11.0 beta and the next TIE beta or RC .	St
1.27.21	http : //www.acronis.com Tell them Rex Basham sent you with excellent reviews on all of their products .	St
1.27.22	Their tech support is fantastic , typically one day or two turn-around with a fix .	St
1.27.23	The inode problem has them though , it 's been open at least two months .	St
1.28.1	While using the laptop one day , the whole system crashes , that is ; it went hanging - therfore it was forced to stop inorder to reset .	St
1.28.2	But , unfortunately the windows 2000 would n't boot up , i.e .	St
1.28.3	would n't open up at all ... permanently .	St
1.28.4	Send to a repair shop and was told hard-disk suffers 'mechanical failure'-sommething like the motor-drive inside is sort of jammed and could no longer function .	St
1.28.5	You can hear the mechanical & quot ; Clacking & quot ; sound it produced .	St
1.28.6	In the end , replaced with a new drive to put back the laptop to operational service .	St
1.28.7	The faufty drive was thus set aside - considered unrepairable .	St
1.28.8	All my datas inside are lost , could not be recovered ...	St
1.28.9	Regards , Ray Quah	St
1.29.1	In April 2007 I encountered a virus that managed to attach itself to the core programs that run Windows XP .	St
1.29.2	I was able to remove it , but only through some DOS commands , as every time I booted up normally , the virus started running .	St
1.29.3	As a result I had to do a partial restoration .	St
1.29.4	Thankfully I had the appropriate CDs for restoration purposes which came with my puter ( a Dell ) .	St
1.29.5	I was able to salvage most of the files on my hard drive but did lose some .	St
1.29.6	The only problem the virus left is that I now have to activate my Quick Launch toolbar every time I boot up .	St
1.29.7	It is annoying but at least it 's better than having a virus .	St
1.29.8	I should also mention that I did have virus software ( AVG ) at the time I got the virus , but it was one of those types that did n't have a fix available for it when it happened .	St
