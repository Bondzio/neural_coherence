<s> I am trying to decide whether or not to purchase an external hard drive and I am looking for some advice. </s>
<s> Which ones are the best? </s>
<s> I would like something that is easily portable and that I can have access to whether I am in the office, car, beach, coffee shop, etc. </s>
<s> How secure in a sense are these drives. </s>
<s> For example if I drop it is data going to erase? </s>
<s> My flash drive has been through hell and back and still works (drops, wash machines, step on, etc.) </s>
<s> so I am looking for something like that. </s>
<s> Thanks in adavance. </s>
<s> M </s>
<s> The USB MEMORY STICKS tend to stand up to drops better than external drives. </s>
<s> For a LOT MORE MONEY you can find SOLID STATE EXTERNAL DRIVES that will survive better than many external hard drives. </s>
<s> The lesson here is simple. </s>
<s> &quot;We only lose what we didn't backup.&quot; These externals are useful things but do not count as &quot;storage&quot; but as &quot;convenient copies.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> Are their any you would recommend over others? </s>
<s> I feel this one is pretty good. </s>

<s> I've already covered SSD or Memory Sticks so the drop and survive issue is covered. </s>
<s> I don't think any make has any big advantage over another. </s>
