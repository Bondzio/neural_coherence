<s> Hello Everyone I'm glad to have found this site and happy to be here. </s>
<s> Can anybody help me with this? </s>
<s> I recently bought a i7 920 2.67Ghz wt 3 GB of ram, 64 bit operating system wt win Vista Ultimate. </s>
<s> It's a sweet computer but when I connect my HDMI out to the Panasonic Vierra TV, I only get video. </s>
<s> I know the 2 HDMI channels work on the tv. </s>
<s> Used DVD , Blueray and all types of receivers on them. </s>
<s> I was hoping to get help for my PC issue so that I can get Audio Thank you </s>
<s> You didn't tell what software was playing the media. </s>
<s> For example when I use HDMI I have to dive into WMP's settings to tell it to send audio to HDMI. </s>
<s> Sorry I don't have that screen shot today but here's one I have handy -&gt; http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=WMP_Speaker_NOT.jpg BluRay is not natively played by Vista. </s>
<s> You have to reveal the software's name if there is any hope of sharing a picture of where this setting is. </s>

<s> Thanks R. Proffitt for the help. </s>
<s> I use Nero 9 or VLC Media player 1.00 and mostly HD movies </s>
<s> Here's the insult. </s>
<s> (not from me!) </s>
<s> If we don't get bluray software bundled with the drive we discover it's costly. </s>
<s> The cheap seat is to get it bundled. </s>
