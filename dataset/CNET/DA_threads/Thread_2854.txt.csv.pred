1.1.6	I can't even get the disk out of the drive now.	St
1.2.1	Roxio is notorious for this issue.	St

1.2.3	Deleting the Upperfilters and Lowerfilters you find in articles about this and Roxio from the registry that you search about such on google.com 2.	St

1.5.4	Workaround?	St
1.5.5	Don't install DIRECTCD.	St
1.5.6	In fact, why bother with this old software when CDBURNERXP (works on 98/ME/NT/2000/XP) is free and does 99% of what I use a CDRW drive for.	Sug
