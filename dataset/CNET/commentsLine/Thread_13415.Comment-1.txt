i am trying to link up 3 of my computers to a 4-port hub.
the first two computers are running windows xp home, (first, dell, p4 2.4ghz 40gig, 300gig external, 512ddr, second compaq p4 1.8ghz 30gig, 256ram).
the other one is a bit older(amd k6333, 30gig 128ram), and is running windows me (which i know from past experences is a pain in the butt to network).
the problem is, network wizard on the dell does nothing.
i run it, restart, and suprise..... nothing has happened.
on the compaq i set it so that my main dial-up connection can be shared with my other two computers, but the other two computers dont even see the network to begin with!
on the windows me computer i truely dont know where to start... i got some advice from a friend who told me to dump the hub and get a switch (i belive thats what its called) he said that it would be alot easier.
would that help?
i'm kinda at the end of a burning rope here.
any help would be good help.
thanks!
