I currently have a Seagate ST-3160023AS (Barracuda 7200.7 160 Plus, Serial ATA) as my primary drive. I'm looking at getting a ST-3160812AS (Barracuda 7200.9 160, Serial ATA NCQ) which has SATA 2.0 w/NCQ as a second hard drive. Will the 2nd Barracuda with SATA 2.0 w/NCQ be compatable with my computer, although the primary drive is only Serial ATA? I plan on also purchasing Norton Ghost 10.0 and use that in conjuntion with the two drives. IOW: Will the SATA II drive work on my computer? ..with the SATA I cable? ...with the SATA II cable? ...with the SATA I to II converter cable? ...or do I have to buy a SATA I hard drive? I believe my motherboard is a ACPI Multiprocessor PC? (I have a Dell Demension 8400) Thanks, Jason Computer Specs: Dell Demension 8400 Pentium 4 Processor 540 with HT Technology (3.40GHz, 800 FSB) 1GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 533MHz (2x512M) 17, E173FP Flat Panel Display 256MB PCI Express x16 (DVI/VGA/TV-out) nVidia GeForce 6800 160GB Serial ATA Hard Drive (7200RPM) w/ Native Command Queuing Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition Dual Drives: 16x DVD-ROM Drive + 48x CD-RW Drive Sound Blaster Live! 24-bit ADVANCED HD Sound Card
