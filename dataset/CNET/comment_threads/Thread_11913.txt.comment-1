Hi, last week I findally had time to assemble my pc like I did it in school before, to be sure I also checked my mainboard manual, when I press the on/off switch on my power supply on the back of my computer and then I press the powerswitch in front of my case, nothing happends, only the leds are burning, the first time when I did this, I heard the air coming out in the back of my pc, but it went out after 1 min, and now I never getted that again and nothing happends except for the leds burning My leds are working so I don't think my mainboard is fried and my dad thinks there is something wrong with the power supply, it's 350 watt btw.
Anybody got an idea?
