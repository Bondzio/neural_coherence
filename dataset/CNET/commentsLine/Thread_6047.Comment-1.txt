folks, i've searched the forums, but can't find any simple directions for my question.
i have an 'old' 19&quot; dell e193fp lcd monitor i found in the garage and am wanting to use it to watch tv in my bedroom.
please keep in mind that i am totally techno ignorant, so instead of the old clunker i have now.
when i read things about &quot;cards&quot;, &quot;imputs&quot;, connections, etc., i am lost!
i have direct tv satellite right now in the bedroom and the tech hooked it up through an old cd/dvd player sitting on the floor.
i have the little satellite box on top of the tv right now.
when i want to watch tv, i just point the remote at the satellite box, click, and it turns on.
i don't think i have any 'speakers' per say to go with the computer monitor.
the speakers are now on the 'newer' monitor on my computer.
is there a simple way to connect this all up or do i have to have tech savvy?
do i need to buy a lot of things?
i am debating whether to try it or just give the monitor to my son.
thanks so much!
