the life expectancy of a hard drive will depend on how the device is used and maintained.
if the hard drive is not safely removed connecting via usb port, it will cause some problems in the rotating disk inside the device.
the data will be corrupted and damaged.
also, do not over-use defragmentation because it will also damaged the disk.
the time interval for defragmentation is from four to six months respectively.
another good preventive maintenance is to make the device virus-free.
do not use faulty cables in connecting the device because it might suffer from short circuit.
do not drop the device because it will suffer from damaging the sensitive parts.
hope it helps!
cheers!!
