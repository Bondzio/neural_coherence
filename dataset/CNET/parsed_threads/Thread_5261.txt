<s> I have an Intel 2.6Ghz which is working very well. </s>
<s> My temperature is ok but I still want it to be cooler. </s>
<s> It is always displaying 42 C and I would like to lower it. </s>
<s> I have not OC'd it. </s>
<s> I know that 42 C isn't a big deal, but I would like to have a more efficient fan/HS anyway. </s>
<s> I have three case fans (two exhaust fans in the back and one sucking air into the case on the side of the same). </s>
<s> Does anyone know about a top of the line fan for my processor in order to keep it even cooler? </s>
<s> I want a better fan/heatsink (NOT the thermal paste since I think that means that you can't get the HS/Fan off anymore) for top $50. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Charlie when you remove heat sink to put on a better one with larger fan/heat sink, the paste isn't a glue. </s>
<s> you have to i repeat have to use it to make contact. </s>
<s> make sure you remove old and use a quality paste. </s>
<s> in the shop i work in i use Arctic silver a very thin coating on the heat sink the size of the chip i all thats needed </s>
<s> Well if you want to play I doubt that you can go too far wrong with these folks. </s>
<s> http://www.pcpowercooling.com/ Looks like around 20 bucks. </s>
<s> I suspect you will still need the thermal paste. </s>
<s> After thought. </s>
<s> What happens to cpu temp if you take the fan on the side cover (input) and turn it around and make it exhaust? </s>
<s> A no cost test. </s>
<s> But does that mean that the thermal paste doesn't dry? </s>
<s> And one more, what would be a good quality paste? </s>
<s> nope stays pasty:) artic silver is good but when you buy new heat sink most come with either a tube with paste or heat sink has a pad which is the transfer medium </s>
<s> What do you think about these pastes ? </s>
<s> Anyone that you would recommend? </s>
<s> And then I would like to know if this is a good choice... </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> in my opinion the pastes are pastes i use the cheapy silver have had no probs. </s>
<s> and i dont know anything about that heat sink i use a stock amd recomended one for my computer </s>
