1.1.1	Hi all , I have recently tried to install a new video card into my old computer , the computer was built by me so its not as if I 'm just bolting parts to an OEM .	St
1.1.2	In any case I installed the new video card ( XFX Radeon HD 4650 , AGP ) Into my pc and it looks like safe mode , I have tried to uninstall and reinstall the drivers multiple times , using the drivers off the install disk , and the newest ones from ATI/AMD .	St
1.1.3	Still get a safe mode-like screen .	St
1.1.4	I put my old card back in it ( ASUS X850 Extreme ) and it worked .	St
1.1.5	So , I was wondering if there is maximum amount of graphics a mother board could handle ?	Ques
1.1.6	Here are my specs : Well ...	St
1.1.7	I reached the end of the allowed characters ...	St
1.1.8	I will post in a reply .	St
1.2.1	Motherboard : Abit IC7 ( 8x agp ) Memory : 1 gig Hard Drive : Baracuda 1Tb SATA Processor : Intel P4 3.4ghz HT New Video Card : XFX Radeon HD 4650 1gig Old Video Card : ASUS X850 Extreme 256mb PSU ...	St
1.2.2	I have no clue right now ... have to get home and look .	St
1.2.3	Operating System : Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit	St
1.3.1	The PSU is a 500w Ultra X-Connect	St
1.4.1	The drivers from ATI will be for PCIe and I did n't read if you found the HOT PATCH versions for AGP .	St
1.4.2	But you 'll also want to install the latest BIOS and MOTHERBOARD drivers for your machine so the AGP card would be detected .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Hmm , I 'd move off that since the memory mapping could be a problem .	St
1.5.2	The P4 I looked up has the 64 bit support .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	When you say screen looked like safe mode do you just mean that that the resolution got very small , making icons big or were there other indications you were in safe mode such as some devices not working or did it say safe mode ?	Ques
1.6.2	If the former , it might be just the screen resolution setting .	St
1.6.3	Did you try to change the screen resolution using the controls for the graphics card ?	Ques
1.6.4	Was the ASUS X850 Extreme an AGP card ?	Ques
