<s> The instability of my computer has been bugging me for a while now. </s>
<s> Computer specs: Inter i7 920 (not overclocked), Gigabyte 4890 Factory overclocked, Asus P6T, 6Gigs G-power (or smth like that) 1600Megahertz, and an iCute case. </s>
<s> My computer handles games quite well offline, but whenever I go online in games like: Battlefield 2, and Battlefield Bad Company 2, my computer crashes within 20 minutes (btw, i use lan cable, not wireless). </s>
<s> I think the source of my grief is my Graphics card, as once, directly after it had crashed, i reached my hand inside my case, and felt the air around different areas of the case, and suspected that the graphics card was overheating. </s>
<s> This was confirmed when my fingers brushed against it's scalding(-ish) hot metal. </s>
<s> My graphics card was already underclocked then, (for an 4890), with 750 clock and 950 memory. </s>
<s> Another interesting point is that when i used gpuz, the clock speed showed up as 900 for a second, before plummeting to 240. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me what is happening </s>
<s> What did you do when you found that hot board? </s>
<s> You didn't say. </s>
<s> That's a good question What should i do? </s>
<s> btw, i did a test with GPUZ, and i found temperatures as high as 90-95C </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Talk to the machine's maker about the issue. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Try leaving the cover off. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Add a fan to put cooler air to the area that's hot. </s>
<s> Now I can't tell if it worked OK before but if so, some folk install other than stock GPU speed control apps and the issues begin. </s>
<s> So no history? </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Get some fresh compound and refresh all heat sink contact areas. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks bob, I'll try those </s>
<s> yes, no history </s>
<s> Gaming in any form is going to push your system. </s>
<s> You already know that the video card is hot, so attack that issue. </s>
<s> Also, the exhaust of heat build-up is important as well to help overall cooling. </s>
<s> If none of Robert's tips help, then use direct better cooling of the video card by replacing its fan setup(HSF) or replace entirely and use &quot;water cooling&quot;. </s>
<s> The whole point being that cooling is so much a consideration now, you can't leaver it out. </s>
<s> Plus, prolonged playing will be a key issue as persistent hi-temps sooner or later find the weakest link and crash a system or worst start to destroy it. </s>
<s> If you fix the system now and it works for a longer time, then one of the above needs to be revisited and upgraded yet again to better handle the situation. </s>
<s> Understand, continued use of the system where it will crash or not last as long is a clue that it reached its peak of sustainability, thus more $ and/or cooling tips are required. </s>
<s> FYI- Just look at any decent pre-build PC offered for gaming, what it entails. </s>
<s> These are not basic systems anymore. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks willy, but I discovered a different problem Following bob's suggestions, I opened my case, pointed a fan at it, as well as cleaned my gpu fan + heatsink a bit (they were coated with dust). </s>
<s> Now moments before the crash, the highest temperature I see is less than 80, however, the GPU Load (btw i'm still using gpuz only) is at a constant 100. </s>
<s> What should I do now? </s>
<s> Btw, my gpu is a Gigabyte Factory overclocked 4890 (GV-R489OC-1GD), which is now left at it's original speed, so no more underclocking </s>
<s> With the clogged vents and the high temps these chips and boards age badly. </s>
<s> You may want to start thinking about replacing this card. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hopefully, it's only the worst case scenario </s>
<s> As I noted, you have to revisit the problem. </s>
<s> The video side has become the weakest link. </s>
<s> Even, if you clean it well, a &quot;very fine dust&quot; still coats the video card and only a true liquid cleaning with alcohol, etc. </s>
<s> will do or use of &quot;electronic cleaner&quot;. </s>
<s> Even so, the damage maybe already done and is too late. </s>
<s> Heat stress though not apparent is seen when repeated hi-end usage causes a faulty operation of all sorts to include crashes. </s>
<s> In most cases, replacing the video card is the fix AND must now include the newer and better cooling fixes, otherwise you will revisit the problem again. </s>
<s> Afterall, you did OC the video card and now you see the results of a &quot;shorter service life&quot;. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> How many case fans are you running to reduce the heat load ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I use a cheap iCute case, with a slow, but large fan on the side, and a small fan at the front of the case, which sucks in air Thought it'd be alright cus i have a CPU fan (Coolermaster Hypern N520) which expelled heat from the case in the same direction as if another case fan was present </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Coolermaster 750 </s>
<s> for the moment. </s>
<s> Suggest checking the GPU fan speed settings (should be SW that can adjust fan settings) to make sure it's operating at a high enough speed/RPM to remove the heat. </s>
<s> Next I'd remove the GPU, then remove the GPU HS Fan, clean/remove the thermal paste, reapply new thermal paste, reassemble and reinstall the GPU. </s>
<s> Post temp results. </s>
<s> I'd also suggest adding another case fan to intake cool air into the case. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> If you want to try avoiding replacing that card, do the DOLLAR work. </s>
<s> Example at http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=THERMAL-GREASE1-5&cat=FAN Want to upgrade that? </s>
<s> 3 bucks then. </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=AS-MTX-25G&cat=FAN Bob </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The heatsink is as hot as the card, the heat is passing from the card quite flawlessly It's just why does it produce so much heat </s>
<s> I think the overheating card has aged and needs replacement. </s>
<s> But for 1 to 3 bucks I would try this before I replaced the card. </s>
<s> It also gives me the chance to clean those heat sinks. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Couldn't hurt to try thanks </s>
