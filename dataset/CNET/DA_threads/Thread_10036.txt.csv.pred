1.1.1	I am looking for some benchmarks on database performance comparing Sybase ASE on a Sun/Sparc systems and MS-SQL on a WinTel box .	St
1.1.2	The key is someone matching the boxes to roughly the same level , so it is as like for like as possible .	St
1.1.3	I know this is not really in the domain of this forum but I was here so I figured I would ask .	St
1.1.4	On a pricing level I was looking at a 32 Core Sun M5000 and a HP Blade Server with 32 Cores , both with 72G of RAM .	St
1.1.5	However I really need database performance benchmarks .	St
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	http : //www.tpc.org/default.asp	St
1.3.1	I was there and they have some dated TPC-C for Sybase vs MS SQL but not TPC-E which is the one I really need to compare as it is modeled on OLTP & quot ; brokerage & quot ; type transactions .	St
1.3.2	That is a great site in general for benchmarking .	St
1.3.3	I may be stuck with vendor published results or bite the bullet and use the TPC tools to create our own , something I am really trying to avoid .	St
1.3.4	Thanks	Polite
