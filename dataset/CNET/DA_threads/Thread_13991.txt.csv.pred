1.1.1	i just got my new XION Solaris case from newegg.com It has 2 front audio and 2 front usb ports.	St
1.1.2	Using both the motherboard and case manuals i connected the cables for the USB to my motherboard and doublechecked that the pins were correct, but the ports are not working.	St
1.1.3	I did not connect the audio ports and left the pins jumped.	St
1.1.4	I am running Win XP SP2; this is my first case with front USB.	St
1.2.1	If there are other USB ports, are they active?	St
1.2.2	If not or only the frt.	St
1.2.3	USB ports make sure under the bios section, they are enabled.	St
1.2.4	Of course recheck the wiring, it can be confusing at times for anyone.	St
1.2.5	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	i've had my PSU (350W) for a while and done some upgrades to my pc since having it.	St
1.3.2	I wonder if there isn't enough power to run the front ports?	St
1.3.3	could anyone tell me how to test my PSU?	Ques
1.4.1	The wiring and bios area?	St
1.4.2	There is no real test other than a voltmeter and that only does voltages.	St
1.4.3	if everything else works, you should have enough for the USB.	St
1.4.4	USB doesn't need that much to run.	St
1.4.5	Since, this is a new build, you have to recheck before you start elsewhere.	St
1.4.6	Don't take things for granted.	St
1.4.7	tada -----Willy	St
