1.1.1	Hello: From what I can tell, computer headsets bifurcate at the ends, leaving one cable for the audio jack and one for the stereo jack.	St
1.1.2	This is fine when you are using a laptop and have both jacks literally right at your finger tips.	St
1.1.3	But what happens when you are using a desktop?	St
1.1.4	My tower isn't real close to where I sit and I question whether the cable would stretch that far.	St
1.1.5	Further complicating matters is that I have PC speakers plugged into one of the stereo jacks on the back of the tower.	St
1.1.6	As a result, I have two small speakers next to my monitor and when I want to use headphones I just plug the headphones directly into the speakers as opposed to the back of the computer.	St
1.1.7	So what can I do to resolve this issue.	Ques
1.1.8	Thank you.	St
