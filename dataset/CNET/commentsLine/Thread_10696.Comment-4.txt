i connected the gateway hard drive and the dell system and it acts like it did when the hard drive was in the gateway system.
it will not boot up at all with that hard drive connected to the dell system.
i ran an ide drive diagnostic on it and this is what it said: ide drive diagnostic drive 0: maxtor 6e030l0 -pass drive 1: wdc wd1200bb - 53dwao - fail.
reture code: 79 would this indicate that the data on the wdc hard drive is lost and gone forever?
