I can't even get that far.
And every time i run checkdisk it just give me lots of errors like this: The disk does not have enough space to replace bad clusters detected in file 3248 of name \Music\Artists\PHANTO~1\PH0781~1.WMA.
Anything I can do to fix that?
I still have 20 GB free space on the drive.
Is it fixing the problem?
