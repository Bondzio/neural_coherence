are the images cached somewhere on the smaller hd?
maybe if you delete your temp/cached files?
another possibility i can think of, is if you've set a limit as far as where you keep the image files; maybe you've reached that limit, and you're not gonna get any further until you clean that folder out.
just a wag.
