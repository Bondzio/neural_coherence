I've been running ipconfig /all on all computers I have in my house.
All IPs are different.
The only thing that's the same for every computer is the Deafult Gateway, DNS Servers, DHCP Server and Subnet Mask.
Here's what I get after running ipconfig /all in this computer: Connection specific DNS suffix: home Description : Atheros AT5005GS Wireless Network Adapter Physical Address: 00-0E-2E-A0-4A-B6 DHCP Activated: Yes Autoconfig activated: Yes IP Address: 192.168.1.88 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 DHCP Server: 192.168.1.1 DNS Servers: 192.168.1.1 Incase I haven't stated yet, I'm running on Windows XP SP3 and my modem is a Hitron Technologies Voice Wireless Gateway BVW-3653.
