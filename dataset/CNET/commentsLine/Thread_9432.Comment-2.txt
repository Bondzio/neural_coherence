you will need to use a dvm to see which pairs of wires connect to each other.
the one with 2 red and one white probably means one is a center tap but it could be on the primary side to accommodate either 200 or 240 v. the primary side will have more coils and will probably have wire that is more thin.
if you can see the which coils the colored wires attach to, that's a good clue.
i know a simple way if you have another transformer with a known and measurable output but won't get into this just yet.
i also know a way to use a 1 1/2 volt battery and your tongue to do a crude step up/ or step down test but it probably isn't advised here.
good luck.
