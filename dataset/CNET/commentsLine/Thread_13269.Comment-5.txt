thanks for all the replies.
it sounds like we have a couple differing opinions.
i already own acronis true image, so maybe i'll run the program and see what happens.
if the corruptions transfer over with new hard drive (which i would guess they would), then i'll have to try something else.
here's where i'm going to show my lack of computer savvy... could the problems i'm experiencing be a result of the physical hard drive problem or a corrupted os?
are both an option?
i'm wondering if i switch to a new hard drive, what the odds are that i could wipe the old one and it would be usable again?
secondly, assuming that making a clone doesn't work, what would happen if i run hp's system recovery disks on a new hard drive?
does that work?
or does it have to be run on the hard disk that windows was originally installed on?
thanks for humoring me while i explore my options.
