If I do get the XFX GeForce 8800 GS, what would be the reccommended PSU Wattage as I just purchased a new 450W PSU.
Im running: 2 Intel Pentium 4 3Ghz 2 1GB Sticks DDR RAM 1 SATA HDD 1 COMBO DVDRW/CDRW ODD 1 CDRW ODD 1 CPU FAN 1 SYSTEM FAN 4 USB Devices powered from PC.
Ive used a few PSU Wattage calcs but alot dont have the 8800GS as an option for the GPU.
Is 450W sufficient?
