there could be a number of reasons for this that i know about, and probably a bunch that i don't.
the first thing to check is the &quot;quick shutdown&quot; feature of windows.
use the start menu to access the windows help screen...then search for the feature to learn how to turn it on and off.
also, check the services you have running.
if you are not familiar with windows services (via control panel / administrative tools /) ....and you have &quot;always on&quot; broadband connection.....try disconnecting the broadband cable, rebooting, then shut down to see if your computer shuts donwn any quicker.
if it is quicker, then sp2 may be running a bunch of background services that you don't really need, or, a particular service is not responding to the new configuration provided by sp2.
just a few ideas to try, in case you haven't sloved it by now.
even if you have to suffer a longer shutdown..sp2 is worth the extra shutdown time because your security is greatly improved.
