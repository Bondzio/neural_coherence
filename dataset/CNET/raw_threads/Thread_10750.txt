Recently, my computer had to move from where it was living right next to, and ethernet cabled into, the wireless router (Linksys g) to another room across the house. The walls are extremely thick and everything from wireless telephones to baby monitors have trouble. I purchased a usb wireless adapter for the computer and while it works, it is quite marginal. It has a lot of trouble maintaining a connection to the router and when it does, it's a very slow one. My question is, how best to maximize the throughput? Would I be better off with a PCI card inside the computer, or stay with the usb? At least with the usb I can get a long cord and snake it closer to the door where the connection is slightly better. But if I can avoid having wires I'd like to do that. Is there something intrinsically stronger about a PCI setup than a usb one?

A PCI card with fixed antenna is fine for nearby stations. ------------------------------------------ software reviews
