<s> Hello, I am planning a new itx-build computer and I'm a bit unsure as to a video card. </s>
<s> Ideally, I would like to find a card that could sound as well as video through the HDMI port. </s>
<s> Would most video cards with an HDMI port be capable of sound output, or would I need to look for a special feature on the card? </s>
<s> (Also, I have no real plans on gaming on it. </s>
<s> The most graphically demanding operation is probably just playing Blu-ray on it. </s>
<s> If I can find a slim blu-ray drive.) </s>
<s> Here is the case and motherboard I am planning on purchasing in case this has any affect on a recommendation. </s>

<s> This means you're going with some Sandybridge CPU which will have on board graphics that should be capable enough for everyday use. </s>
<s> Have you selected the exact processor you want and checked to see which Intel graphics offering it has? </s>
<s> I might suggest something in the i5 range due to possible heat considerations and you don't need the unlocked versions. </s>
<s> You might want to put the box together and see how well it does before adding a discrete video card. </s>
<s> intel's sandy bridge graphics are (finally) respectable. </s>
<s> unless you want to do some gaming, the integrated graphics are perfect for in an ITX form factor. </s>
<s> I was thinking of getting the i7-2600 (non k version). </s>
<s> If I were to go the discrete card route, would any potential card with an HDMI port fit the bill of being able to output sound as well? </s>
