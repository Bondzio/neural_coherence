<s> I'm looking at getting a Core i7 920 and I wondering if anybody has already purchased one and if they could tell how well the stock heatsink/fan work. </s>
<s> I've heard that they are terrible, so I am just wondering. </s>
<s> Have been the best over the years. </s>
<s> I think I've replaced a few Intel fans where as all the others are a daily replacement in the shop. </s>

<s> Typical supplied OEM fans tend to work well as they don't want the warranty to kick-in within normal use. </s>
<s> If you plan to &quot;overclock&quot; then consider a higher rated or suitable replaceable fan that's rated for such use. </s>
<s> In most cases, just trust the supplied fan that came with the cpu. </s>
