<s> I'm getting a new PC with XP HOme and am trying to decide between 512 or 1 gig memory. </s>
<s> I don't do alot of gaming or video but I do tend to keep a PC for a few years. </s>
<s> Would the 512 memory probably be good or should I go for 1 gig. </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Since you're not going to be gaming or watching videos a lot, 512MB will be just fine. </s>
<s> However, with frequent sales on RAM, it is a good idea to bump it up to 1GB so that it's ready for the future. </s>
<s> While XP is happy with 512MB, Longhorn (due out sometime between late 2006 and the next Ice Age) and future programs will want more to run normally, and it certainly won't hurt your current programs either. </s>
<s> With prices as low as $35 for a stick of Kingston 512MB DDR400, there's little reason not to upgrade. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John P.S. </s>
<s> Just make sure what configuration it has...if it comes with 1x512, you can just pop in an additional stick. </s>
<s> However, if it's 2x256, you'll have to replace both sticks to make 2x512. </s>
<s> if its a lot stick with 512 then when needed upgrade to 1gb in the future. </s>
<s> since u arent doing any gaming or video, i would suggest just sticking with 512 till later. </s>
<s> I've done some tests and was surprised that 1G paid back 5 minutes over a 6 hour DVD render session. </s>
<s> But today's games are now using the 1G. </s>

<s> I installed 512 and found another 512 stick from Crucial at a good price. </s>
<s> The machine worked perfectly, but bumping it to 1 Gig seems to give me a little more speed. </s>
<s> And the price was right. </s>
