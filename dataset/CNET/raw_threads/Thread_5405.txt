I would like to clone the original to a larger hard drive and don't think this can be done from a computer. Is there cloning devices that will work outside the computer such as a power source with the cables for transfering info? Thanks, Steve

Most systems like that use a hard disk &quot;saint&quot; procedure that is specific to the make/model of the HD based recorder. Since you didn't name the make/model you disabled us from looking to see if such a procedure was known. Bob
