I would be concerned with a 450 watt PSU running that system.
It will probably be enough but you'd be better off going with something around the 600 watt range just to ensure that the computer has enough power.
Nothing worse than having your PSU blow from being overdrawn for too long (and risking blowing other parts if the PSU were to fail).
