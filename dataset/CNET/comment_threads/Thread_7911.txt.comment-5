It seems you carefully worded your post to leave out exactly what old system you have.
Apparently many a pre-installed OS suggests an OEM type install.
If that's case the OEM EULA makes transfer to any non-OEM brand system(still hard) outside of its intended usage.
The other posters pretty much covered the topic.
I just like to add, while you can get a &quot;generic OEM&quot;(for new DIY system) as your best bet to get your current swapped h/w plus any drivers required for that rebuild system.
In other words, you see the problems with &quot;pirated&quot; OS, the the same for old legit but non-original OEM system is the same result.
If you buy a retail version of XP(full/upgrade) you can install that on any 1 system and again, if that system fails on another system provided it remains on only 1 system.
The generic OEM version is likely the cheapest to get, though I exclude eBay and other sources.
