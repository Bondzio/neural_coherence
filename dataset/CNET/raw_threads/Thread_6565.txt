I followed instructions in another thread about measuring voltages with the computer on. The 12v and 5v rail checked out OK. I was not able to find an AUX connector. Is there a 3V aux with my computer? e machines T6420 Athlon 64 3400+ Here are the symptoms: On a few occasions, my computer would kick into a mode with the fans racing after I walked away for an hour or two. (had to hold power button in for 10 seconds to turn off) Sometimes the screen saver would be frozen also and I detected sounds. I turned off the hibernate mode thinking that might be causing this glitch but it recurred again with the fans racing. The last time this happened I turned the computer back on and the fans stayed in this racing mode and the screen remained black. (Won't boot} The video is nVidea GeForce 6100 and I assume this is built in as there are no other cards. Could this be why I have no monitor (amber light is on) yet monitor works with my other computer? Would putting another video card in the open pci slot bypass the built-in video? Thank you

You PSU is probably not the problem. And neither is your video card. Sooooooo.... guess that leaves the mobo. Sorry. and life goes on... Jack

This board is 1 yr. old though I understand it can happen with new ones too. How do I check for the 3.3V to the CPU as that's the one voltage I haven't been able to check. In another thread, someone posted a link with pictures showing how to check these voltages but it failed to discuss the details about the AUX if mine actually has one? There are 2 connectors from the power supply to the board. How would you know if it's the CPU or the motherboard if that is the problem?

Sadly you need a good board to test the CPU on. Power supplies are thankfully plentiful at the shop bench. -&gt; About the other items. Be sure to check the CMOS battery voltage too. On some boards if it's too low, the board never comes out of reset. Bob
