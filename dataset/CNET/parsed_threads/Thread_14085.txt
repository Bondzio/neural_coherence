<s> My external hard drive is not being recognized by windows, yet I can see that it detects it in device manager but not in My computer. </s>
<s> Will updating the drivers allow the hard drive to be seen in my computer? </s>
<s> And will updating cause me to lose the data that's on the hard drive? </s>
<s> Thanks for the suppport </s>
<s> Assuming you have Windows XP or Vista (not ME or 98) the answers are no and no. </s>
<s> There's nothing to update as your machine comes with all drivers to access the disk. </s>
<s> But if you do somehow, it won't harm, because those drivers are on your PC, not on the external disk. </s>
<s> Things to try: 1. </s>
<s> Try the drive on another PC. </s>
<s> If it works, that's a good occasion to make a backup of your data. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Try another USB-port (without intervening hub). </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> See what XP or Vista Disk Management tell about the drive. </s>
<s> It's unlikely they will find an errorless FAT32 or NTFS partition, but you might be lucky. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Put the drive in a new case, just in case the electronics is broken and the drive OK. 5. </s>
<s> Repartition and reformat. </s>
<s> You'll loose all data on it. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Buy a new drive. </s>

<s> It's likely to be a corrupt volume if there are no other bad sounds like clicking, clacking or such emanating from the drive. </s>
<s> Here's a few titles to try: GETDATABACK ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY As to loss of data if you install drivers that should make matters worse as none are required. </s>
<s> Also we only lose what we didn't backup. </s>

<s> Well I tried steps 1-3 already, although all XP says is that the device is working fine (via the device manager). </s>
<s> I can't do step 4 because I'm not that familiar with electronics and the only other hard drive I own is my sister's (who I don't think would be too happy about my taking apart her hard drive...) Hopefully I'll be able to find some way to fix it though </s>
<s> There actually is some clicking coming from the drive. </s>
<s> However, around two weeks ago when it finally broke there was also clicking but after fiddling with it a bit I managed to get it to show in My Computer although I couldn't access the files (I have another thread here that fully explains the situation http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7588_102-0.html?threadID=344602 ) I've tried getdataback and it worked, only it was a trial so I was able to see my files still there. </s>
<s> I turned off the drive because I needed to buy the program and didn't want it to overheat before I bought it, but now the drive won't show anymore. </s>
<s> those recovery programs might find it and be able to extract the data. </s>
<s> You only know when trying. </s>
