now that sounds pretty bad (or maybe i should say smell..).
first of all; thermal grease should not smell, at least i have not experience it.
it is obvious something is burning.
some may not agree with my method.
but here is how i would do it.
take the case cover off then turn on the computer.
when it start to smell, i would unplug the computer; then i would discharge myself by touching the chassis, and i would then use my hand and see if there are anything that is too hot to touch.
good luck.
