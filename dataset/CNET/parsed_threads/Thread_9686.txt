<s> This hopefully will be an elementary question for some on here. </s>
<s> I am attempting to set up 2 networks within an office location without a dedicated server computer. </s>
<s> As is, the first network has no DHCP enabled, is in the 10.x.x.x range and sits behind a dlink wireless router(of which a cable modem connects). </s>
<s> There is a hardware print and file server on this network. </s>
<s> Users of this network access the internet readily and also each other. </s>
<s> The 2nd network would offer customers and affliates of the office a wireless connection (192.168.x.x range) with minimal security, for ease of connecting, and would NOT allow communication with the 10.x.x.x network. </s>
<s> Purchasing an additonal ip from the cable company is not an option unfortunatly, as it seems most secure. </s>
<s> I have an AP with DDWRT which allows for creating virtual LANs, but I believe these VLANS are still on the same programed ip range as the main/default LAN of the network. </s>
<s> Is this the answer to my prob? </s>
<s> Please help before I have to invest in rogain. </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Sorry but I can't explain this in this small box but the double nat (see google) seems appropriate here. </s>
