<s> Does anyone have a Samsung HD103SJ with firmware 2010.08 they can sell me? </s>
<s> Mine crashed and stopped spinning. </s>
<s> I purchased the same drive and swapped out boards. </s>
<s> I did get the old hard drive spinning again but with the new board came a new firmware so the pc wont recognize the drive. </s>
<s> Any help? </s>
