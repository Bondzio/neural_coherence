<s> I took my ibm thinkpad r31 apart in an unsuccessful attempt at fixing a loose dc power jack. </s>
<s> When I put all the parts back everything worked fine, even the unpredictable internal wifi antenna, but the trackpoint mouse is no longer shown in system devices. </s>
<s> The keyboard works fine and the trackpoint is all one piece with the keyboard. </s>
<s> I bought a wireless mouse which is recognized and works well. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> ...the trackball is connected via one of those flexi plastic film things? </s>
<s> These are notoriously difficult to keep working as you disassemble devices. </s>
<s> Basically the thin platic film has small bared ends, which go into a very narrow slot (which is the problem). </s>
<s> Then a little clip slides in which is supposed to pull it fully home, and into proper contact. </s>
<s> It's easy to get it wrong, and even with it looking like it's right, and firmly clipped in, it's not contacting correctly. </s>
<s> Or maybe it's just broken? </s>
<s> GeeBee. </s>
