<s> Hi I'm looking at getting a QX6700 which I want to overclock to about 3.25Ghz. </s>
<s> Does anyone know which is the best CPU Cooler for the job as there's a big choice! </s>
<s> http://www.quietpc.com/gb-en-gbp/products/intelcooling gives a list of possible options including the Noctua NH-U12F, Thermalright 120 Ultra and Zalman CNPS9700NT but there are also others such as the cheap as chips Arctic Cooling Freezer 7 Pro. </s>
<s> Any help would be great! </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I'd prefer not to go to water just due to added expense, however can I just cool the cpu using water? </s>
<s> If so what's the best kit to go for and what's the best budget option?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> about, including CPU-only ready-to-fit but none of them seem to have the reputation of the usual watercooling systems... but clearly they are more effective than air. </s>
<s> The Cooler Master Aquagate S1 is such an example and it will work with the QX, but I can't give you any firsthand info as I haven't built a machine around self-contained systems like that. </s>
<s> Air-wise have you taken a look at the Thermalright Ultra 120 Extreme? </s>
<s> I'm running a Q6600 (non overclocked) with it and I'd say based on the stock temps I'm getting with a fairly low volume of air wafting over it, it's a good base for decent OC's with the QX. </s>
<s> The case is just as important as the cooler (if it fits for a start, especially with the larger heatsinks which can interfere with side intakes/fans) if you're going to go with air of course... but that's probably another thread. </s>
<s> Personally I kind of tired with all that pre-OCing futzing, which is why I picked up a couple of Dell XPS 710H2C's </s>
<s> lol! </s>
<s> The 710H2C's is an awesome piece of kit! </s>
<s> How come you ended up with 2??? </s>
<s> If I could afford one of those outright I wouldn't be bothering putting all the pieces together myself! </s>
<s> Although I'm enjoying the challenge of course! </s>
<s> I'll check out the Cooler Master Aqua, I like the idea of the self-contained system! </s>
<s> ...basically, because I wanted two. </s>
<s> The H2C was a compromise actually, especially as it has some corners cut for a supposedly uber-duper system. </s>
<s> But it is decent hardware I have to say, and the naysayers don't appreciate how much has to go into a stable overclock to a level that a major manufacturer is willing to support. </s>
<s> The other major reason for the compromise is that I'm a Dell corporate customer and I buy enough from them a year to secure good discounts, and this applies to everything they sell me including all the XPS machines I've bought from them. </s>
<s> Glad I was of some help, hoping you get some decent OC's. </s>
<s> check the results in this article here: http://www.anandtech.com/casecooling/showdoc.aspx?i=3010&p=3 btw, if you haven't purchased the cpu and mobo yet, look into a p35 based mobo. </s>
<s> they support 1333mhz fsb and will almost automatically OC any 1066mhz core2duo by 25%. </s>
<s> so a q6600 ($500) will hit 3ghz with little to no tweaking. </s>
<s> that's pretty close to your target but saves you $450. </s>
