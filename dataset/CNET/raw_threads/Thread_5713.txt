The power cord came out of the unit, and it fell over onto the carpet. I plugged it back in, and it makes a sort of grinding noise about 5 times before seemingly giving up. I plugged it into my Windows 7 computer once it was done, and it recognizes the drive as a USB disk, but not as the D:/ drive like it used to. What might the problem be? Can I get it fixed? Are all of my music and important documents gone forever? Thanks for your help!
