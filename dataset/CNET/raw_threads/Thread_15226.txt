I have created a public drive on my home network, can I run any apps through this harddrive. I would like to be able to work from my computer and run apps and edit my work on the harddrive. I don't want to store anything on my computer, just use the networked external harddrive is this possible?

To get you going you'll want to convert and use only PORTABLE APPLICATIONS. Here's a starting link for you. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=portable+apps
