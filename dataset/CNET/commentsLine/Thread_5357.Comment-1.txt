i just bought a dell.
recieved it in less than a week.
my problem is: when i call customer support, i get somebody that speaks english, but with a very heavy accent.
i find it really hard to communicate with them.
i think the next time i call...i'm gonna tell them i want somebody that speaks english clearly.
