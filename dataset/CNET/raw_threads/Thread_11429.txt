I am trying to save a little money - but if I have to pay someone then I will. My ISP is a wifi provider. I don't use a cable or dsl modem to access the internet. I connect with network adapter. Now, I want to network my other cpu's, my laptop, my ps2, and provide Internet connection for my PSP. My ISP told me that I need to purchase a Bridge and wifi router. They told me to purchase a Senao bridge and netgear router. I did both but I need to know how to set it up. Any info would help.
