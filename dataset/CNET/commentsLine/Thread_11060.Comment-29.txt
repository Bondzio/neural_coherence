i read somewhere on the 'net that a scanner that has film scanning built in interacts directly with the os in such a way that won't work with vista or 7. same scanner would not work on imac running osx.
i didn't give up on the 4200f, i keep a hard drive with xp that i only boot to run that scanner .. and a 2001 copy of picture it!
publishing.
