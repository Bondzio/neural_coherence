as i do not own your router i can only offer ideas.
i see &quot;the disconnect feature&quot; which if done proper will help out here.
you could set it to 8 hours or so and the last router i had with this would disconnect and then when a pc would need a connection the wan dhcp would fire and the connection would be all fresh and ready.
remember i can't know if you are running a torrent or such but isps are using ip changes at low hours to trip up the downloading crowd.
