&quot;...in a well designed flash ssd you would have to write to the whole disk the endurance number of cycles to be in danger...&quot; i wondered as much.
makes sense to segment and allocate the p/e cycles across all of the memory portions of the drive than concentrate them always to the most immediately available address and in unison treat the entire drive as a singular entity.
the article does seem to give credence to notion of a ssd lasting a very long time.
but a lot of these specification claims still feel very much like manufacturers' gloating over something that no one today will be around or--just as likely--remember to see proven.
a bit like gm's mystical chevy volt mpg numbers.
it also begs the question: if a ssd goes into read only mode as you described in one of your other postings, does that actually qualify as a failure, at least in samsung's eyes?
or is the continued data integrity part of that 114+ years?
(i'm still trying to get my head around that 1,000,000 hour number &lt;sigh&gt;...)
