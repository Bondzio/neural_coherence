<s> I'm able to get the SSID's in the range using vbscript and i would like to know is there a way to get the list of STA's (ie) systems under each SSID's using vbscript. </s>
<s> I'm not able to find any resources in the internet. </s>
<s> Anyone Plz help me out. </s>
<s> Thanks in Advance, Baskaran </s>
<s> The code is possible but if I were to do this I wouldn't hamper my efforts and limit my language choice. </s>
<s> If you want to get into this go look for WEPCRACK and such since the source is readily available. </s>

<s> Thnx for ur reply I think u r asking me to refer to the open source WEP cracking stuff. </s>
<s> Is there a direct vbscript or any other program sources available for listing the STA's under an SSID like a vbscript that i've got for listing the AP's. </s>
<s> I mean to ask is there any official and diplomatic way in knowing the STA's without using the hacking and cracking stuff.... </s>
<s> Hoping for ur reply.... Baskaran </s>
<s> Reuse the code that determined the SSIDs and such. </s>
<s> But no, I do not know of code that meets your requirements that is in your selected language and ready to use. </s>
<s> I bet you'll have to find working source in any language and modify it to your needs. </s>
<s> There is a fast way to cheat on this. </s>
<s> If this was my system I could get the status page from my WIFI router and it lists the currently connected clients. </s>
