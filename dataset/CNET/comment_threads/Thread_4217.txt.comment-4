But what if the CD Rom doesnt work and if you dont use floppy utilities then what do you use when things go wrong Im sure you Know of IT personal using floppies to boot up a system to work on a pc that has gone south Now keep in mind that Im just learning about Networking and batch files and such But I know the whole dos on disk was used to fix a lot of trouble, even to the point where portable floppy drives where made so one could still use such utilities.
So ok if Im way off base then what do IT pros use now to work on a pc that a CD Rom wont work and needs to boot into a messed up system thanks
