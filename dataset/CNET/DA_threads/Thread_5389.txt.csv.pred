1.1.1	Two of the three Optoma EP720 projectors we run in our training rooms have recently started displaying badly pixelated images , one worse than the other and the third is OK .	St
1.1.2	I have tried adjusting the resolution of the laptops and the projectors - no joy !	St
1.1.3	To prove the issue , I finally disconnected the laptop from the projector then restarted it with the laptop still disconnected - the result is that the projected 'image ' is still badly pixelated .	St
1.1.4	To my non-techie brain this shows that the problem is with the projector and not the laptop .	St
1.1.5	The possible soutions are to either repair or replace the projectors - methinks the latter will be quicker and cheaper and a lot less heartache considering we have three courses starting on Monday ! ! ! !	St
1.1.6	Any advice would be greatly appreciated ! !	Polite

1.2.1	If you happen to have a service contract for these projectors , I 'd call them first .	St
1.2.2	If you happen to still have warranty on them , I 'd call them also .	St
1.2.3	If you do n't , I 'd call the shop where you bought them or Optoma tech support to see what they advice .	St
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	Unfortunately , these projectors are a good 5 years + old ( outside any warranty ) .	St
1.3.2	We 've gone for the replacment option as we were up against the wire .	St
1.3.3	Thanks for the reply .	St
