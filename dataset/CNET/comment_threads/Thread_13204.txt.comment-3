Took the power supply apart and on the circuit board I found a burnt dyote (sp?).
I turned the power supply on and it started smoking in that area.
That piece on the circiut I guess directions current into one direction only.
So hopefully it didn't damage other pieces.
There is only one other part that seemed like it got burnt a little from the dyote, but it seems to be fine.
This part will probably only cost me 2 dollars at radio shack, so hopefully it will solve the problem.
