Alright, i have a Dell Inspiron E1505 laptop, and i have been having issues with the wireless card or something. Heres the problem: i turn on the comp, no problems, then i turn on the wireless, connect to the internet, no problem, then after 5-15 min's for some reason the little Wi-Fi light goes out and the internet stops. I go to show all connections, and it says that its still connected, but its not, i try to disable, it wont let me, i try to repair, it does nothing, i try turning the wi-fi switch back on, and it does nothing. The only thing i can do to get it to turn back on is resetting the computer. This has been like this since i recieved the computer. I have connected to a hotels wireless, mcdonalds wireless, and my neihbors wireless, and it still does all of what i have listed. Anyways, any thoughts on what the problem is? Because i think its a faulty network card, anything else i dont know, thanks for the help. Yes i posted in two differnt forums cause i dont know what it falls under.
