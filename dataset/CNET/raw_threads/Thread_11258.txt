It makes forwarding decisions based on the IP address. A bridge or switch is a layer 2 device (OSI) and it makes forwarding decisions based on the hardware address (MAC address) Most consumer routers are effectively a 2 port router (LAN side & WAN side). The LAN interface is usually attached to a 4 port switch. A wireless Access Point is a bridge that connects the wired to the unwired devices. The AP is an extension of the 4 port switch side of the router. SKrall
