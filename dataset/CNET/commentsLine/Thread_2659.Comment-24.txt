mainly because i've never had one break on me in my 6 years of building.
also when i was in shop in my high school there was a shelf with a bunch of old random hard drives pulled from various systems that still worked.
take a guess what brand showed up the most?
i mean i saw western digital caviars from 1992 that still worked lol.
