1.1.1	I have tried to get into my computer, however when I switch it on, the Microsoft windows xp professional comes up and I press enter, but, an error screen flashes on and then it goes back to the Microsoft windows xp professional menu again.	St
1.1.2	So, I created another partition on my computer with the basics and it works fine.	St
1.1.3	Trying to access my disk drive and it comes up &quot;Access is denied&quot;Tried to restoring, but, that failed.	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions, thanks?	St
1.2.1	XP Take Ownership.	St
1.3.1	Thanks, but, that doesn't work either.	St
1.3.2	When I try to go in safe mode, it kicks me back to the OS menu again.	St
1.4.1	Safe mode boot failures are now a solid sign of malware damage.	St
1.4.2	Over in the Storage Forum at the top post are ways to get your files out.	St
1.4.3	And a last chance.	St
1.4.4	DO NOT PLUG IN ANY USB OR OTHER THING.	St
1.4.5	Try safe mode again.	St
1.4.6	And I know what your question.	St
1.4.7	Can you fix Safe Mode boot failures?	St
1.4.8	I can but on pre-installed Windows I can't since they remove all the tools to fix it.	St
1.4.9	We get the files out safe then reinstall the OS.	St
1.4.10	Bob	St
