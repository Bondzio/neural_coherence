1.1.1	I just loaded on Vista RC2 , and was all excited to try out the new Vista Media Center with it , since I have never used Media Center before .	St
1.1.2	Vista automatically installed some drivers that were dated and signed as of 6/21 which is newer than the drivers on this page http : //www.hauppauge.com/pages/support/vista.html When it loads up , the screen is all snowy , I can hear some audio from the station , and only barely make out anything .	St
1.1.3	I tried to fore it and load the older drivers from the Hauppauge page on , but then it said after when I got into Media Center that my TV tuner was n't supported .	St
1.1.4	I was pretty sure there was support for my Hauppauge 500 in Vista 64 anyone have any idea to help me get it working ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks , ~J	St
1.2.1	Vista RC2 is & quot ; beta & quot ; and until Vista in whatever version does get released offically , do n't expect much help from the s/w vendors until then AND expect some drop-out of support as older s/w & h/w is phased out or simply no longer supported .	St
1.2.2	While you may have more luck with more popular devices or pgms .	St
1.2.3	as things settle down maybe all this will be cleared-up .	St
1.2.4	At this point you 're on your own or at the mercy of things forthcoming or not .	St
1.2.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I understand that .	St
1.3.2	But seeing a whole drivers page on Hauppauge 's site makes it look atleast like they are trying to continue to support it throughout the Vista beta .	St
1.3.3	The drivers now automatically load in Vista after installed .	St
1.3.4	I was wondering if there was anyone that might have had any luck getting it to work .	St
1.3.5	I know the Hauppauge 500 is a popular card , so I figure someone out there has tried it with RC2 , and was wondering if they were having the same unforunate luck I have had .	St
1.3.6	~J	St
