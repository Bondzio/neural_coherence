The issue with no security is that any child can interfere.
When you change to this forum's advised settings (which is WPA) then the interfering users are removed.
I've seen folk lose weeks, months, hundreds of bucks over this one lone setting.
They'll load drivers, post on forums, reinstall the OS and even buy a new machine.
