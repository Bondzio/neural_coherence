It might give you the best range, and you wouldn't have an external device that you can lose. Check with gateway to see if there is a recommended card: https://support.gateway.com/support/copilot/chat_sales.shtml?id=400010 There are many wireless-g PC Card/PCMCIA adapters and USB adapters in the stores. You may want to avoid USB adapters if you need to use the ports for other things. Also note that you have USB 1.1 ports (not 2.0), and some wireless adapters work best on USB 2.0 ports.
