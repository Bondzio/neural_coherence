I have a wireless network set up through MR314 Netgear wireless router.
I have two laptops connected to the internet through wireless and have One desktop connected through the a wire from the router's ethernet port.From the desktop i am able to connect to the laptops and access all the shared folders on them but from the laptops i am not able to connect to the desktop.
I have disabled the firewall on the desktop still it is not working.
I have the workgroup name of my desktop same as that of the wireless ESSID name.
All my computers have Windows XP Operating system.
Any help or suggestions in resolving this issue would be greately appreciated.
Thanks Nirmala
