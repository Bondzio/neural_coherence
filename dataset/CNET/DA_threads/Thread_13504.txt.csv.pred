1.1.1	Hey, I am trying to connect a front panel (I'm not sure what type but it has 2 USB's, a mic, and a headphone jack.	St
1.1.2	The 2 USB ports seem to worl already but the headphone and mic have never worked.	St
1.1.3	I've recently discovered the retailer I bought it from didnt install it.	St
1.1.4	I went to attach the wires to the motherboard and when I opened up the computer I saw there were 2 blue caps or something blocking the motherboard connections.	St
1.1.5	They spanned 2 connections between BLINE_OUT_L and LINE out_L BLINE_OUT_R and LINE out_R Does anyone know what these are for and if I can remove them?	St
1.1.6	ASUS tech support isn't open right now and I'm anxious to do this.	St
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	It sure would be helpful if you supplied what system/mtrbd.	Res
1.2.2	you have in order to get detailed help.	St
1.2.3	From what you described, now you know why the vendor didn't connect the leads to the audio, etc.. You should go back and see if they will replace the mtrbd.	St
1.2.4	with one that's more flexible to connects.	St
1.2.5	What do you mean by &quot;caps&quot;?	Ques
1.2.6	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	oops, sorry, I forgot to mention it is a A8N-SLI premium motherboard from ASUS.	St
1.3.2	By caps I mean little blue things that over the pin sticking out of the motherboard.	St
1.3.3	One cap covers two pins with the arrangement I mentioned before.	St
1.3.4	They are easily removed with needle nosed pliers but I didn't try plugging the wires in yet for fear of breaking something.	St
1.3.5	I'm worried they might be required jumpers that connect the pins because there IS metal inside.	St
1.3.6	Thanks for any help	St
1.4.1	The &quot;caps&quot; are jumpers, and are sending the audio to the rear panel of your computer.	St
1.4.2	You'll need to remove the jumpers and attach the front panel wires to BLINE_OUT_L and BLINE_OUT_R.	St
1.4.3	Of course, this will disable your audio from the computer's back panel.	St
1.5.1	Yeap, those are &quot;jumpers&quot; as another poster mentioned.	St
1.5.2	You need the manual and get the details it supplies to &quot;find where&quot; the connection is for the frt.	St
1.5.3	panel.	St
1.5.4	Using the the Asus support website, find your exact model mtrbd.	St
1.5.5	and then if you don't have a manual get the d/l'able one and then print it out or review it on screen.	St
1.5.6	Once you locate the true location of the connections you need plus what or how it is connected w/o too much guess work.	Ques
1.5.7	I'm sure there is a location to be found or re-route it if it is already being used to the frt.	St
1.5.8	panel, rather than a rear location.	St
1.5.9	That is what the jumpers(caps) probably are intended to do.	Ques
1.5.10	Understand you don't connect to mthose jumpers but rather there is a dedicated connection for the frt.	St
1.5.11	panel, you may in fact be able to use both frt.	St
1.5.12	and rear connections, again this info is supplied by the manual.	St
1.5.13	Try this link for manual: http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&model=A8N-SLI%20Premium tada -----Willy	St
1.6.1	Thanks for all the great info guys!	Polite
1.6.2	I'm still kind of confused though.	St
1.6.3	I have the manual that came with the motherboard right in front of me and it shows to use the connections I said in the original post.	St
1.6.4	I don't see anything else in it where it shows a different set of connectors for front panels.	St
1.6.5	Thanks for your help though, I'll look again	Polite
1.7.1	Well, I removed the jumpers and then plugged in the connections and it works perfectly.	St
1.7.2	If I plug my headphones in the fron tthe speakers stop working and the audio goes to my headphones!	St
1.7.3	The retailer had wired the front audio to a 10pin connector so I was hoping that they had jumpered the pins inside the connector to replace the blue jumpers the manufacturer installed.	St
1.7.4	I guess they did.	St
1.7.5	Thanks for all your help!	St
