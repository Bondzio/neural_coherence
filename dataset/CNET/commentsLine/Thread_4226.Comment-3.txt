thanks for your reply.
i gave up on the la cie for a while but tried again this week.
i am still having the same problems.
my daughter's computer uses windows xp.
i have contacted lacie and tired all their suggestions including downloading an update.
however, my computer still freezes if the lacie is on at restart.
then if i turn it on , the computer recognizes the drive but i have been unable to write to it.
my husband does not think it is the cable because it worked on our daughter's computer.
i'll try plugging into another port but i'm not sure we have a front panel port.
it worked so well last year on both my computer and one other that i thought it was terrific.
i am disppointed and frustrated with the current problems.
should i just give up and order another hard drive?
