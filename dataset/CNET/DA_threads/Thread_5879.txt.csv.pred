1.1.1	Hey there I recently contracted a virus to my computer .	St
1.1.2	Thinking that I had managed to clean it up succesfully , I switched off the computer and went to bed , big mistake as it would seem .	St
1.1.3	When I came to restart the machine , an error message appeared saying : & quot ; Windows could not start because of the following file is missing or corrupt : \windows\system32\config\system & quot ; I tried repairing this through the windows XP cd but the cd could not find the OS to repair it .	St
1.1.4	I have another computer that I thought I could install the hard drive to , clean it up and use it as a slave HD .	St
1.1.5	When I connected it , the computer recognised that there was another HD connected but in My computer I could not open the drive , but instead I would receive a message for me to format the drive .	St
1.1.6	Does anyone know of a soloution to this ?	Ques
1.1.7	If possible I do n't want to format this HD as I have some very important stuff on there .	St

1.1.9	Any advice is will be very helpful .	Polite

1.2.1	This might help determine it was a boot sector or file infection type .	St
1.2.2	You might want to get the driver manufacturer 's utility program and do a diagnostic and full erase proceedure with that before formatting .	St
1.2.3	As such you might be able to rule out possible problems with the magnetic media on the platters .	St
