It worked faily well until I installed new firmware. I would like to uninstall the firmware but can't figure out how. I tried System Restore but none of the restore dates would work. The Device Manager says that it is working properly. But whenever I put a disk into it, it prompts me to insert a disk. Any suggestions??

Click CD/DVD Drives, highlight the drive in question, right click, click Properties. Click the Driver tab, select Rollback Driver. Good luck, Telephony facts, analog/digital explained.
