<s> Hi all I need help I have an hp media center pc its the one with all the connections in the front One group of connections is for analog connections for a VCR, DVD, or analog camcorder. </s>
<s> On hps site it says that if you want to convert old home movies or tape recordings to a digital format is what the front analog connections are for. </s>
<s> When I connect my analog camcorder to it nothing happens I figure I need some type of software to recognize the front port am I wrong? </s>
<s> And if I do need some kind of software what do I need all the software I have looked at says it only reads from firewire or USB But not analog I know that I can buy a separate piece of hardware but that defeats the reason of why I bought the hp media center in the first place I wanted the built in analog ports. </s>
<s> I called hp but they dont know what to do (strange) Can someone plz help me </s>
<s> So let's start with http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx Remember this system may let you record content but will not create a DVD from such. </s>
<s> For that you have to buy something that will handle the usual DVR-MS files that Media Center creates. </s>
<s> The trick is to get the camcorder showing on the Tv settings. </s>
<s> http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/using/tv/recordtv.mspx and once there you can record it to the usual DVR-MS files. </s>
<s> For me this is far too much work so I move to other software fast. </s>

<s> Ok get this I called hp back and asked about the analog connections in the front of the media center and how to get it working. </s>
<s> I gave them all the serial numbers and model first the lady try to tell me that the connections arent real. </s>
<s> I told her Im starring right at it I finally got her to look on there own website and see that the connections are real. </s>
<s> Then she try to tell me that I need a device that would change my analog from analog to digital then back to analog again then send it to the analog connection on the media center. </s>
<s> Then I showed her on there website where it say you can capture video directly from analog devices such as vcr, or analog camcorder then she wanted to charge me $65.00 to talk to someone who would be able to tell me how the ports (that she said werent real) work. </s>
<s> This is proper since there is no detection that such were connected. </s>
<s> It's an old electronics issue and not a bug or omission by anyone. </s>
<s> If the unit claims you can convert your media and you can't find out how then why not ask for every dime back? </s>
