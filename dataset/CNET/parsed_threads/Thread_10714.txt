<s> I haven't done this in a while, and can't find the info on how to change the graphics settings from pci to agp. </s>
<s> I'm having some trouble with my tv tuner card It is ATI) and this is something that might help. </s>
<s> Can you tell me in simple terms, cause I did it before, but it has been awhile. </s>
<s> I'm using ME </s>
<s> enable AGP as the first video search. </s>
<s> it shouldn't help anything. </s>
<s> it just tells the system during the boot to search for an AGP &quot;card&quot; rather than waste time [milliseconds] looking for a PCI card. </s>
<s> once the AGP card is &quot;found&quot; you are running from the AGP slot. </s>
<s> ATI drivers can give one fits. </s>
<s> I can't help you there. </s>
<s> program that it comes with.....and enter all of the configurations there. </s>
<s> I about went crazy trying to get the correct settings of Svideo vs the other options only because I wasn't using the TV at all and was instead trying to configure it for my vcr. </s>
<s> A couple of emails back and forth with ATI tech support got me up and running pretty quickly and I kept the notes on what I needed to do.....but it was all in the tv player program settings and they were the same for a vcr as they would have been for the tv so start there. </s>
<s> If you need more help, post back and I'll hunt down the notes I took about this. </s>

<s> I also have ATI. </s>
<s> An All-In-Wonder Radeon 7500. </s>
<s> I've had it about 3 years and it hardly ever runs right. </s>
<s> I can get it just about right, and then the next time I want to use it nothing works. </s>
<s> I want to watch my DVDs on the TV, but the desktop is not displaying on the TV. </s>
<s> I got it to recognise the tv display, by uninstalling and reinstalling the tv monitor in the control panel&gt;systems&gt;device manager, and the boot screen displays on my tv, but the desktop doesn't. </s>
<s> Also the ATI remote control doesn't work. </s>
<s> Maybe it the Canadian stuff, if a US company had anything like this I would have gotten it here. </s>
<s> I know it is a complicated system, but I don't have these kinds of problems with anything else in the computer. </s>
<s> I've had it running about 4 different times but it always messes up. </s>
<s> Their customer support isn't much help either. </s>
<s> Sorry to complain so much. </s>
<s> The MPEG licensing authority (www.mpegla.org or .com) wants 2 bucks per video stream for DVD players. </s>
<s> This would add 2 bucks to the DVD player software so current players often disable the TV OUT for DVD play. </s>
<s> If only they would just tell you this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> unless you have a HDTV, it will look like &^%%^^. </s>
<s> The resolution isn't there. </s>
<s> I set mine up, looked at it once and blew it off. </s>
<s> Now, downloading from my PVR to my harddrive is another matter. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> It isn't just the DVD. </s>
<s> The TV goes through the boot cycle, and then nothing. </s>
<s> Can't get the desktop to display on the TV. </s>
<s> It would be nice if the DVDs would play on the TV though. </s>
<s> Don't have widescreen, alot of DVDs don't come in full screen, and WinDVD will play them full screen. </s>
<s> The few times I got the DVDs to play on the tv the picture wasn't too bad. </s>
<s> I'm not streaming videos, I'm playing my own. </s>
