&quot;we called a computer technician who sat in my chair and the screen immediately came on.
to my observation, he just hit a random keyboard key but i cannot be sure about that.&quot; i usually tap the del key to skip trying to load an possibly damaged os and see what hard disks and such show up.
i've re-read your posts and in short, the pc needs repair.
nothing in your posts gives a clear direction or indication of what part is dead or unplugged, but it does appear to need repair.
if it's one of those built-it-myself units, you can't imagine how many have loose nuts, bolts, cards floating around the inside of the box.
best of luck in your repairs.
