I'm running OSX 10.4.l0, and the drive mounts fine, and I can drag files on to it and everything. However, the one-touch feature does not seem to work. Maxtor Manager opens, but when I click &quot;Backup Now&quot;, nothing happens. How can I fix this?

I don't know if the Backup feature of this drive actually works with OS X, it may do but I did not find anything definitive about it on their website. As it works with Windows and Mac OS, I have a feeling that this drive is formatted in FAT or FAT32. This allows it to work, out of the box, on almost any machine. It is, however, a notoriously fickle and unstable format for your data. You would be well advised to format this drive in HFS+ (Journaled) for your data's security. You can do this via Disk Utility.

It also depends on how complete a backup you want. If you want to be able to boot off the drive and restore a completely usable backup, I'd suggest going for alternative third party software like Superduper (as opposed to the Retrospect that I believe is shipped with the Maxtor). http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html It's nowhere near as good as some Windows solutions, but it's probably as good as you're going to get on a Mac.
