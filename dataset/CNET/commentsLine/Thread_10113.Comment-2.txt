we have to have a firm grasp of networking but without that i can offer only a few suggestions (covering networking is something too large to cover in forums.)
1. put the recorder on your router into the router's dmz.
this is not going to be explained much further because networking is a rather deep subject.
if you can't find the dmz, please obtain on site support.
2. i want to comment about the fixed ip address.
given ddns capabilities why would i pay for a fixed ip?
