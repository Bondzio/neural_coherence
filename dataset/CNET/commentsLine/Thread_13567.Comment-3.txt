be sure to check the tv setup itself to direct &quot;input source&quot; as tvs are highly configurable as well.
the other half is that the laptop needs to be setup to show there is a 2nd display.
since, its shows that then the signal source is lost at the tv side.
i suspect you use the osd of the tv or whatever it needs, otherwise it defaults to std.
signal source, like cable, sat./or antenna, get the idea.
