the second option should have a total of $280.
and for the cpu's, i would go with the core 2 b/c of it's solid performance with better graphics cards.
better cpu's tend to work better with th faster video cards, you'll even see a 40-50 fps increase with the core 2 compared to the athlon x2, trust me.
