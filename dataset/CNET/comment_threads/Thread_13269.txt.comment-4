of my two laptops and three desktops.
The cloned drives sit in an anti-static bag in an old VHS tape box.
Once a month or so I reclone them.

And that's the key words here.
If you clone, any errors will be moved to the new hard drive.
Start from scratch and get a purring system, then clone the drive.
