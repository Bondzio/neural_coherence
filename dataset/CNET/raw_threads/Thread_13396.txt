I, on accident, lost the little black clips that holds it in place. Does anyone have any tips on how to fix this? My first instinct is vinyl electrical tape, but I'm worried what will happen if it melts, or by some odd turn, an arc or something. The connector is the one that holds they touchpad in place, so it's quite small. Any tips?

It's certainly isn't electrically conductive and sticky and strong and seems to work. Of course, you handle it the best you can and don't buy cheap tape, either. On some quick fix repairs, I have used &quot;clear labels&quot; used for mailing or folder labels, clear seem to be easy to work with and strong enough until a permanent fix is done or left alone. tada -----Willy
