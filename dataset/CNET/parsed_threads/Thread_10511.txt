<s> Hi there, I have a problem with my Twinhead 12D and if you could tell me what might be the possible problem that is occurring to my Twinhead. </s>
<s> I have been using my Twinhead for nearly 5 years and it has served me quite well. </s>
<s> I'm satisfied with my Twinhead but now this problem is occuring, I just can't accept it and it's making me sad knowing that I have to spend a few hundred bucks to repair it. </s>
<s> What happened was: I left on my Twinhead for a day and when I came back from work, I found out that my Twinhead was swtiched off. </s>
<s> The cooling pad's light which was attached through the USB cable was blinking though and the cooling pad was working fine. </s>
<s> Except for the laptop. </s>
<s> I thought my laptop was shut off accidentally because of a power trip or something. </s>
<s> So, I decided to turn it back on. </s>
<s> To my dismay, it wouldn't turn on!I checked all of my electrical appliances in my room, everything was okay. </s>
<s> I checked my modem and router too, turned out they were OKAY. </s>
<s> At that time, I wasn't using any battery with my Twinhead. </s>
<s> I was just using the AC Adapter connecting to the power socket.Then, I tried using the battery WITHOUT the charger, it WORKED PERFECTLY FINE! </s>
<s> It went to Windows and I could use it like normal with no problem at all! </s>
<s> But I tried it WITHOUT the battery, it DIDN'T WORK! </s>
<s> I tried the battery and the power charger, the battery will not charge all all. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what might be the problem. </s>
<s> Is it my AC Adapter or is it something inside the motherboard? </s>
<s> I can't afford to buy a new Twinhead motherboard. </s>
<s> What had happened? </s>
<s> When I charged it WITHOUT the battery, there's a small electric sound inside. </s>
<s> An abnormal electric sound. </s>
<s> Please reply me asap. </s>
<s> Regards, A. </s>
<s> Sounds like you will need a new power adapter, here is the link to Twinhead, from there you'll be able to get a new adapter http://www.twinhead.com.tw/index.php </s>
<s> The battery management and the circuits that control, decide which power source to use are on the motherboard. </s>
<s> 5 years is a very good lifespan for a laptop. </s>
<s> Not many go much longer. </s>
<s> I wonder how many will learn this as most new PCs are now laptops. </s>

<s> I have been using it for 5 years doesn't mean I have to change into a new laptop. </s>
<s> Like I said in my post, when I used the battery, everything will work perfectly fine. </s>
<s> If it's the mobo, I think I just have to change the mobo or repair the mobo, at least. </s>
<s> The backlight and more has aged and if you recall, almost all consumer gear is a five year design life. </s>
<s> You would be out all that for the motherboard only to eek out a few more months. </s>
<s> Then again, many have to learn this first hand. </s>
