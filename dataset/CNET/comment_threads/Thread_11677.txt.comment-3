Besides knowing the OS and details of the hard disk, as noticed by Toni, it would be nice to know what message you get from what program when doing what.
And why this is a 'very serious' problem for you.
I agree with Toni that it might be necessary to replace the hard disk.
That could hardly be called a serious problem, just a big nuisance, costing anything up from $10 ( http://shopper.cnet.com/Western_Digital_Caviar_ATA_33_4_3_GB_Hard_Drive/4014-3186_9-30015468.html mentions a refurbished 4,3 Gb drive for $9,41).
