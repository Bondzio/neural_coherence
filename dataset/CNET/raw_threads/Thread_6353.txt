It won't recognize it. Then I put another DVD with some files on it, also burned on my PC. Same thing. When I put a picture CD (from Ritz Camera) it opens it just fine. When I put a DVD movie it opens it fine. Is it possible that this problem comes from the fact that these DVDs were burned on the PC? Thanks a lot! Exp.

You'll want to stick with MAC's preferred (I hope I remember this correctly) DVD-R or you may see this instant issue. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=mac+dvd+recording+format Many PCs came with only DVD+R/W recorders and you get instant headaches. Next, the format of the data on the drive matters. Bob

The data is a bunch of .JPG pictures, nothing more. And the media I used is actually DVD+R, so that may be the problem. I'll get some DVD-R media and try it again. Thanks for your help. Cheers, Exp.
