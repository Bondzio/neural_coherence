I simply created a port with identical information (ip, name, etc) to the functioning workstations, extracted the oem drivers to a directory, created a dummy printer then changed its port to the new one and did a &quot;driver update&quot; to the driver directory.
I realize this has to be the most hassel-filled way to do it but it worked fine.
BTW, on printer, a DNS address was specified but enable DHCP was unchecked...may mean nothing.
Thanks again
