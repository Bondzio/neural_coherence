another huge help: if you have an amd athlon 64 cpu (or one of the newer semprons), make sure cool 'n quiet power management is enabled (power scheme set to minimal and the amd processor driver from amd.com installed).
if you have an intel cpu... well, you obviously don't care about cool .
also, use a high-efficiency power supply like the seasonic s12 series.
the power supply doesn't generate as much waste heat and its 120mm fan helps system cooling.
definitely make sure your next case has 120mm fans.
antec makes some good ones.
