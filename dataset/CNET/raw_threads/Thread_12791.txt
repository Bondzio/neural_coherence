I already tried installing W7 RC only to find that there was already an OEM reserved partition where Vista is, so I was only able to install W7 RC on the larger of the two partitions, and I'm pleased to report that W7 seems great, but I'd like to re-install it onto a cleaned-up hard drive that doesn't have a big Windows.old folder taking up a bunch of space. So could you tell me how to set my hard drive up that way for my next attempt at a W7 RC installation? So to summarize, I first want to completely wipe my hard drive clean, which currently contains two separate partitions: one small OEM-created Vista partition and the main one now containing W7 RC. From there, I want to set my hard drive up with one small partition I can install W7 RC on and another main one for storage and stuff, unless you hard drive experts think it's wiser to set a laptop up differently... Also, as a side question, could you tell me if a hard drive backup image includes everything like partitioning, etc, or if it only contains the OS, software, data, and things like that? Because I should probably make a backup image before doing anything drastic. Thanks for your time!
