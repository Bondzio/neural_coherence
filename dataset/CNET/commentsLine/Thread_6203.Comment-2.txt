after some research i figured what i'm looking for is a wireless bridge.
i'd prefer a netgear bridge because intuitively i feel like it will just &quot;work better&quot; than another brand with my netgear wireless router.
however, the netgear wn2000rpt is only single band n and 100mb ethernet while the linksys wet610n and the d-link dap-1522 are both dual band n and 1gb ethernet.
having 1gb ethernet is preferable so i can blast files between the two computers connected to the bridge.
which do you think is a better solution?
any ideas welcome.
thanks.
