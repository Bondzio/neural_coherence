all i can suggest is do some reading ... pcpowerandcooling.com is the best (and expesnive) and then there's seasonic, antec, enermax, fortron, sparkle power, ocz, etc., it's a core component so it doesn't pay to skimp.
tomshardware.com has some good reading on psus.
once you focus on some you like...check the buyer comments reviews at places like newegg.
when you're ready to buy and want some feedback..post your choices here for comment... you know most can't resist.
