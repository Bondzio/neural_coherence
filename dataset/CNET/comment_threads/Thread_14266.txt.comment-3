I usually edit a copy on the hard disk and copy to the drive.
I'm sure that many might edit such on said drive but that seems to push one's luck as these devices have limited lifespans which I can easily multiply by using it my way.
So the solution is simple.
Format the thumb drive and copy your files back on to it.
