<s> Hi, everyone i have philips 107e 17&quot; CRT monitor, and below monitor is bass speaker.Is it bad for my monitor because i listen pretty loudly music, and when i volume up speakers i see some lines on screen.And, yes my monitor picture is shaking.Could it because bass is draving power from sistem or it is just electromagnetic field?? </s>
<s> Thanx,Fema </s>
<s> This area is thankfully well discussed. </s>
<s> It's all about physics but to keep it short I won't write about electrons, CRTs theory of operation but just share that it was 1897 when this was discovered. </s>

<s> Move speaker(s) or monitor away from each other, distance them. </s>

<s> and most speakers do have fixed magnets. </s>
<s> The volume at which you play the speaker isn't, itself, an issue but excessive vibration can damage just about anything. </s>
<s> Much will depend on just how close the speaker is to the CRT and whether or not it's magnetically shielded. </s>
<s> Symptoms of damage from magnets are color and image distortion. </s>
<s> You can easily see this by moving a smaller magnet around near the screen. </s>
<s> Most minor magnetic damage isn't fatal and some will be produced by components within the monitor itself. </s>
<s> But, these tend to have automatic degaussing functions that reduce or eliminate the effects of magnetism. </s>
<s> Here's a youtube of what a magnet can do. </s>

<s> Maybe could be just an old monitor(8.5 years) Thank for replies,Fema </s>
