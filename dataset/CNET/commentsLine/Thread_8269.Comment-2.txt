has been the problem.
hp was going to release a very nice 11&quot; tablet with lots of usb ports + more that would run on window7 pro but after testing they found out that win7 was just not 100% ready to run a tablet & they are now looking into android o/s, so that has been push back to late fall of this year, that is if testing goes good.
no one is going to make a dent into ipad sales until someone can make a tablet that runs on windows 7 pro or ultiment with out problems, with good battery life & a competitive price to the ipad but by then the ipad gen 2 will be out, maybe even ipad gen 3. it is going to be sometime.
dell has their little 5&quot; andrioid thing, i do not consider it a tablet... just too small, more for a phone size then tablet.
