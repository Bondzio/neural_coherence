Many fall for the cheap bare drive buy without BluRay player software. Today I don't find such for free and if you don't get it with the drive the added cost vaporises your wallet (err, savings.) Hope that helps. Bob

I'm tossing over of just using PS3 instead of buying a stand alone blu Ray player but some guys here said that it isn't a &quot;smart&quot; thing to do. I think I'll agree. @ Bob Thanks for the tip. Regarding before, I thought you had any problems with my question. You said &quot;Seems fine here&quot;, I thought I did something terrible. Haha . I'll continue searching first.. it isn't that urgent.
