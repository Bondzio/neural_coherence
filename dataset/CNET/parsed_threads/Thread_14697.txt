<s> I have encountered a puzzler. </s>
<s> The Asus SK8V motherboard was designed for the AMD Athlon64 FX-51 processor. </s>
<s> Here's the problem: The registered, tested and recommended memory for the MB is non-ecc. </s>
<s> The processor requires ecc memory. </s>
<s> What do I do? </s>
<s> I suppose I should go with ecc since I plan to fill all of the dual slots with memory. </s>
<s> Correct? </s>
<s> Not correct? </s>
<s> I'm confoozled! </s>
<s> ftp://ftp.asus.com.tw/pub/ASUS/mb/socket940/sk8v/e1473_sk8v.pdf on page 11 noted either memory type. </s>
<s> I'd get your system supplier to stand up and exchange these out if it doesn't work out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for responding. </s>
<s> The system isn't built yet. </s>
<s> I ran across this conundrum while researching for my rebuild. </s>
<s> So, since I am responsible for whether or not things work together, I wanted to get some help with this before I spend a good chunk of money. </s>
<s> If a person could ever get a response from Asus, I'd ask them. </s>
<s> I sent them an email 2 years ago and haven't heard anything yet. </s>
<s> I guess the question is : What would the average computer genius use? </s>
<s> ECC or NON_ECC? </s>
<s> Uni </s>
<s> It's clear to me that it's your choice on the matter, except that I always COPY SOMEONE ELSE when venturing out on such expeditions. </s>
<s> http://www6.tomshardware.com/motherboard/20031117/athlon64fx-mobos-02.html answers your question. </s>

<s> If you truly have &quot;alot&quot; of memory, then using ECC type makes sense. </s>
<s> Understand, those that use ECC type memory are more &quot;server&quot; usage or business apps, in general and those usually ship with ECC type memory. </s>
<s> For the typical home user it isn't needed or required. </s>
<s> ECC just gives more room for &quot;error correction&quot; in intense demanding apps or math dependant usage. </s>
<s> Of course, if the system can'r be started w/o ECC installed that pretty makes everything mute, just install it. </s>
<s> In most cases it is an &quot;option&quot; that can be installable, but *all* must then be ECC type in order to work properly. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Almost no one uses ECC memory these days, the chance is one in many million that you will ever benefit from it's error correction. </s>
<s> It is capable of correcting single bit errors which are usually caused by being bombarded by cosmic rays/noise, an extremely rare situation. </s>
<s> Now it could also correct memory errors caused by bad memory, but in that case you are going to need to replace the memory anyway. </s>
<s> The only time ECC is really needed is with mission critical servers. </s>
<s> Both the SK8V & Sk8N require Registered ECC DDR memory. </s>
<s> It has to be Registered ECC for any socket 940 AMD M/B. </s>
