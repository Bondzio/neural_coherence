question: what if anything do you know about norton's anti-virus software?
i have norton av 2004 installed but haven't been able to receive any live updates for quite sometime.
what could possibly be causing me to not be able to receive any of norton's live updates?
i have had no success in contacting norton for an explanation and my av subscription is scheduled to expire in nine days.
