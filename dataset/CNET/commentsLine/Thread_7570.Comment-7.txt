you can get a pretty decent video card for about $50 and then just enter your bios as you boot up the computer before installing it and disable the onboard video there.
shut down after saving the changes, install the new card, hook up the monitor to it, then install the drivers once you get to the desktop from the cd that will come with it.
easy stuff.
