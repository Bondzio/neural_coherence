5515	0	597707	5479539	NR	Robie7642003	7/22/13 12:22 PM	1.37449572E12	Will my system work with these graphics cards?	I'm about to install a Radeon 7770 graphics card. (Considering GTX 650 Ti, but there is a huge cost difference now.) Current build is AMD A6-3500 Llano 2.1GHz MSI A55M-P33 FM1 AMD A55 (Hudson D2) Micro ATX AMD Motherboard with UEFI BIOS 850 Power supply (I know it's a lot--what was available on quick notice) 4 GB memory I'm wondering if the CPU is good enough for gaming, or will I need to upgrade the CPU. Games are Guild Wars 2 Fallout 3 GTA IV Minecraft Chivalry Midieval Warfare Thanks.
