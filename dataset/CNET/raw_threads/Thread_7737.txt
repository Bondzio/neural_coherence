What is the best HDTV TV Tuner card to use? I was told that I need to get a TV tuner card that comes with a remote and IR (infrared) receiver so that the Harmony 880 is able to control the functions for the Media Center PC. Could someone please suggest a good HDTV tuner card that you've used or know of. Thank You
