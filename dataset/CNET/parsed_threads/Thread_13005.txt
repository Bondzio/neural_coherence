<s> I've only had this laptop for about two weeks and I already have a few problems with it. </s>
<s> I'm no computer genius so that's why I need your help. </s>
<s> Basically, when I first got it on the hard drive I had 178 (or more) GB's of free space. </s>
<s> One week later it was down to 168 and two days later it was down to 161. </s>
<s> That same day it went down to 160. </s>
<s> I haven't really downloaded anything on my computer. </s>
<s> Is this drive just eating itself away? </s>
<s> Is it a virus? </s>
<s> or could it be that I have torrent's even though the program is never on? </s>
<s> Please help, before I have to spend hundreds of dollars on getting it fixed. </s>
<s> Also, sometimes it tells me a flash drive has been inserted when I haven't inserted anything and within a few seconds it disappears again. </s>
<s> It does this dozens of times randomly and it's really bugging me. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
