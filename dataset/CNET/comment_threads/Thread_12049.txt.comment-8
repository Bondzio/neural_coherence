Every time I decide it's not worth it, something about it suggests that it is really really close to working : Just now I set up things to print, with the &quot;Devices And Printers&quot; window open, ready to plug in the printer.
Next to the icon of the printer it said &quot;HP 2100 PCL6 : Offline&quot; When I plugged in the usb end of the cable, that changed right away to &quot;HP 2100 PCL6 : Ready&quot; So it's seeing the printer, but just not being cooperative.
(Because when I tried a print, it changed to &quot;Error&quot;).
And refused to print, of course.
Okay.
Last chance for inspirations, anyone ..... ?
