<s> I just picked up a CF-28 Toughbook, 800mhz Mst xp. </s>
<s> I want to hook up a Bluetooth GPS to use in my truck with my existing mapping software. </s>
<s> Any reccomendations or experience with a particular card and car mounted receiver? </s>
<s> Since it would be surprising that I run your un-named software title I'll have to pass on answering your post. </s>
<s> However I will share that if I were to do this I'd look for a WAAS enabled NMEA compatible Bluetooth GPS. </s>
<s> I wonder what &quot;card&quot; you are asking about. </s>
<s> I use a variety of 20 or less dollar USB Bluetooth dongles in my system. </s>

<s> Sorry I use Fugawi Map of America, it uses the USGS topo maps. </s>
<s> I had a mouse type setup with my PocketPC but the screen is so small and hard to see. </s>
<s> &quot;Garmin (including USB models), Magellan, Lowrance, Silva/Brunton MultiNavigator, and any other with NMEA v2 or greater output &quot; I've found nice looking Bluetooth WAAS NMEA GPS units for under 99 bucks. </s>
<s> Add another 20 for the USB Bluetooth dongle and you're done. </s>
<s> Just check the GPS for NMEA v2 . </s>
<s> I'll let you research why I think WAAS is needed. </s>

<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I know what WAAS is. </s>
