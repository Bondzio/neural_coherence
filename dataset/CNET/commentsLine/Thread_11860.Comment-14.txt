i have never owned a laptop, but i am currently looking to buy.
i am confused on the difference between wi-fi and wireless internet.
if i buy a computer that says it has 802.11g, is that just good for wi-fi at a starbucks or some other &quot;hotspot&quot;, or will 802.11g work for wireless with a phone provider like alltel for wireless internet access?
maybe i should also ask if 802.11g is a card built into a laptop?
