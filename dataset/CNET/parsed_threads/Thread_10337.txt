<s> Hi, Operating system win xp pro sp2, machine hp 1029.uk with 2gb memory. </s>
<s> My wireless adapter is a talktalk snu5630ns 05. using the administrative account it connects fine, but if i go into the limited account it doesn't connect (or just says connection is limited so no internet). </s>
<s> Any thoughts please? </s>
<s> http://www.threatcode.com/admin_rights.htm There are indeed products that don't work when using a limited account. </s>
<s> There's a Belkin WIFI product in that list but I didn't do further research on this other than to write &quot;yup.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> So what's the point of a limited account if next to nothing will work on it? </s>
<s> This is yet another area where linux wins. </s>
<s> If everything worked then what good would it be? </s>
<s> For finer control one could look at XP Pro and it's finer controls on accounts plus we have NTFS permissions, ownership as well as the registry. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Limited accounts are just what it describes it to be &quot;LIMITED.&quot; A user is not able to do much with these accounts unless an administrative gives these accounts rights to make modifications to a computer operating system. </s>
<s> Limited accounts are used to prevent others from changing computer configurations. </s>
<s> I accept and agree that there should be such restrictions but why do some wireless adapters work ok and others don't? </s>
<s> Or am I about to answer my own question? </s>
<s> I offered the hall of shame as proof you aren't the first to find this issue. </s>
<s> The maker of the device has to update their drivers and installer to allow limited users to use it or give the option during install to ask &quot;Allow use by Limited User Accounts?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Yup - you are right, now just got to think of 6 numbers for saturday </s>
