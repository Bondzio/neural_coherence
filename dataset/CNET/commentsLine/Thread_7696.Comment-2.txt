you're going to have a particularly hard time finding a large-sized company that will still sell a windows xp system.
your best bet in that regard is to look for a local independent store (i.e.
not best buy, circuit city, or others like them) and see what they have on offer.
they can usually custom-order hardware that will get the job done, but don't be surprised if you're really pushing the limit by asking for an hd dvd drive -- they're usually a few hundred or more by themselves.
as for the question of hd dvd versus hd television, that's something you can blame on tv networks.
most are terrified that you'll copy their shows.
there are tuners that will catch free over-the-air broadcasts, but you'd need a special cablecard tuner (and the requisite cablecard from your cable or satellite provider) to get most of it.
i have to ask: do you really want to buy into hd dvd on your computer when it's as expensive as it is now, and we don't know whether it or blu-ray will win the movie format wars?
i'd rather save the money for a stand-alone player for my tv (if that much!)
and stick to a dvd drive in the computer for now.
