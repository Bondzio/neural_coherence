with one of my PCs getting on line.
After a boot it works perfectly and will for hours.
But if I let it sit idle for a while I can't get on line.
A reboot fixes it.
I've tried everything short of a format and reinstall XP Home SP-2.
(See previous thread.)
Changing router ports (broadband connection), Winsock Fix, reinstall networking, everything I can find at Windows Help, nothing fixes it, not even repair connection.
Can someone recommend a little cheap, free utility like some sort of keep alive to ping something every once in a while?
