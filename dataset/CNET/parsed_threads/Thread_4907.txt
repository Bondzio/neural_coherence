<s> Hi I just ordered a new computer, and was curious if I would be able to add my old video card to the system and have both cards work together. </s>
<s> I have found a fair amount of conflicting information about it and am not clever enough to know of my own intuition. </s>
<s> The new system comes with a NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GT over-clocked video card that I believe fits into a PCI-E x16 slot. </s>
<s> The older card is a PNY XLR8 GeForce 8800 GT 512MB, and made for just a normal PCI-E slot. </s>
<s> Is it possible to make these two work together, or am I wasting my time on a foolish pursuit? </s>
<s> you can only run dual pci-express x16 cards in a motherboard with dual x16 slots. </s>
<s> and for sli, you'd need two nvidia cards of the same type. </s>
<s> since your cards are different, it won't work regardless of if your mobo supports sli. </s>
<s> I think Sli'ing GPU's is similar to RAM, It needs to be in pairs and you need an Sli motherboard. </s>
