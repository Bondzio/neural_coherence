<s> I have a HP LaserJet 1100A that used to be connected through a standard parallel port, and of which both printing and scanning functions worked properly. </s>
<s> Last year, I had to purchase a new computer (Windows XP Pro included). </s>
<s> Since it has no parallel ports and installing a parallel port PCI card did not work, I connected the printer through a parallel-to-USB cable adapter. </s>
<s> The printer works perfectly as a standard printer. </s>
<s> However, when I install the scanning software from the CD, I am prompted for a physical parallel (LPTx) port, which of course makes no sense for my environment. </s>
<s> And while Windows XP detects the scanner as a &quot;Parallel&quot; peripheral, I have no driver to configure it and make it operational. </s>
<s> So my question is: is there an existing driver that supports such a parallel-to-USB connection for the scanner module? </s>
<s> If so, where can I get it? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any helpful information, Jeff </s>
<s> This is why older devices get abandoned due to old age and connectivity to include s/w issues. </s>
<s> I don't see why the LPT/pci parallel port card didn't work, it should have. </s>
<s> However, answer LPT1 for the parallel port question or check in &quot;device manager&quot; what LPTx get listed. </s>
<s> You also lack details of your system, maybe there is a LPT port available and/or some bios setting to be done. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you've gone as far as the legacy device allows with its dated drivers and s/w. </s>
<s> The real fix is to replace that device with supported USB connect. </s>

<s> &quot;installing a parallel port PCI card did not work&quot; They work for me on XP just fine. </s>
<s> But many don't know to dive into the cards settings to change the address to the old LP1 standard addresses and claim it fails. </s>
<s> This knowledge is fading so research what those addresses are. </s>
<s> (It's partly because I want you to fish for the answers since it will help you understand the problem in depth.) </s>
<s> Here's the card I used last time -&gt; http://www.lavalink.com/index.php?id=247 &quot;Configurable for standard ISA parallel port addresses (0278 and 0378) for compatibility&quot; That's the ticket. </s>
