Help!!.
When staring up, my machine will show that the mouse keyboard, hard drive ect.
has been installed.
Then The Windows 98 screen is displayed.
In a few seconds the initial screen reappears indicating the mouse, keyboard, etc has been installed.
The Windows 98 screen appears again and the cycle continues.
It never gets to the point of displaying my desktop.
What is wrong?
What can I do to get this thing to work?
