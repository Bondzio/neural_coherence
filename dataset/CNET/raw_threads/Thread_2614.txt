7716	0	277605	2664783	NR	Steve16	12/28/07 8:46 PM	1.19887476E12	I was in Safe Mode	I was in safe mode doing some trouble shooting with Hewlett Packard. Anyways the girl on the phone told me to jsut restart my computer and everything should be back to normal well it isn't. I am using windows vista and well the taskbar looks like the old grey taskbar you'd get with the older windows and the sidebar is all grey as oppose to the taskbar being balck and the new look for vista. What's the heck happened? how can i fix this and put it back to normal? And believe me I've tried going back on the pc and putting back to &quot;windows normally&quot; or put back to &quot;configure original&quot; or something like that. thanks.

A right click, personalize to see if the resolution is not right you didn't share much detail other than HP and Vista. Our forum note asks for a little more such as the model number. Armed with that I could have found if there is a new video driver or if others are reporting a similar issue (and cure.) But without details all I can do is note the above and think it's the video driver. Bob

Try Vista with the capitals proper or a paragraph just about these details. -&gt; I didn't see where you tried right click on the screen and the Personalize where you set the screen settings. It could be in some 16 color mode. Or a theme of that color is applied. Bob
