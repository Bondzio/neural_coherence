<s> I am setting up a home network. </s>
<s> I am currently using a wireless net work. </s>
<s> I would like to hard wire 5 PCs using Cat 6. </s>
<s> I am not presently concerned w/ internet speeds but I would like to have fast PC to PC speeds. </s>
<s> Can I attach a Gigabyte switch to my router and get wired gigabyte speeds of transfer from PC to PC? </s>
<s> each PC supports GigaByte speed. </s>
<s> If each PC only has a 10/100 NIC, that's all you'll get. </s>
<s> Since all switched PCs route through the router, the router must support GB also. </s>
<s> In short, all devices must support GB speeds to get what you want. </s>
<s> The wired path between the PCs all needs to be gigabit capable. </s>
<s> Since the whole network could run just fine without a router, it doesn't need to be gigabit capable. </s>
<s> The switch routes via the addressees MAC address all by itself. </s>
<s> It doesn't need to hand off the data packets to another device. </s>
<s> The router could be Cat5 and so could the cable to it. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Every component supports gigabyte but the router. </s>
<s> will the communication ( video streaming) from PC to the server be sub gigabyte if all pcs are hooked up to the switch? </s>
<s> In the old days we had HUBs and that rule about the lower speed setting the speed on every port was true. </s>
<s> With SWITCHED HUBS or &quot;Switches&quot; (use that name you want) the packets are switched with a store and forward scheme so speeds are switched up, down as needed. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> and the 100 mb limit between your switch and the router isn't going to matter. </s>
<s> 1,000 Mb/s speed, it'll never happen. </s>
