Actually, the majority (say 6 or so) data loss issues my company has had have been due soley to hardware error.
Several went to data-recovery services (who confirmed the hardware-based error base), while several just ended up on a stack of &quot;bad&quot; drives.
The worst case was a single external Lacie 1Tb drive.
We run multiple levels of security (hardware/software firewall, site-licensed anti-virus), and our user base is extremely familiar with proper saftey protocols.
The drive configurations I'm asking about will be for single-user workstations, so I'm actually leaning toward no RAID data redundancy, since the most critical data WILL be saved to our network storage (which IS data-redundant).
Thanks for your input anyhow.
