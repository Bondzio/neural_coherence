i have an olevia 27 inch monitor/tv.
i have it connected to my hp media center m7360n via the vga connection and it works perfectly well.
on black friday i decided to get a bigger monitor/tv but i am cheap, so i bought the emerson 32 inch that wal-mart had on sale for $388, and then gave my old tv to my roommate.
i thought i was getting a good deal, however, now, maybe not.
the problem is my pc has no hdmi port and the new tv has no vga port.
i tried connecting them using rca cables with no luck.
i think that problem lies with the pc as the dvd player connected to the new tv with no problem.
my question is, do i have to buy a new computer with an hdmi slot, or is it possible to upgrade my existing computer?
i would appreciate any help.
thanks.
