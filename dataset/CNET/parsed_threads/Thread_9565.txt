<s> im looking to get a netbook just for surfing around the house. </s>
<s> right now im looking at the hp netbooks but i dont know how good they are. </s>
<s> all my computers have been hp and i havnt had a problem yet. </s>
<s> this is what im looking at sofar http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?langid=EN&logon=&sku_id=0926INGFS10125195&CMP=ILC-BBY_hmpg1_slide2 anyone know if it is good </s>
<s> Some want good to mean 10 year machines. </s>
<s> We have the Acer Aspire One Netbook and just like other netbooks you discover that it is not a laptop replacement. </s>
<s> If you are in the home, why not a nearly the same price laptop? </s>
<s> because i dont want a giant laptop to use at home. </s>
<s> i already have a regular laptop. </s>
<s> i want something i can sit in a chair or lie on a couch and surf the web. </s>
<s> also for traveling . </s>
<s> I however use a Logitech Nano V450 Mouse on ours. </s>
<s> As long as you're not planning on playing cutting edge 3d games a netbook is fine for casual surfing the net, photo manipulation and even music recording. </s>
<s> you can always plug it into an external keyboard and larger monitor if you tire of the smaller 8.9 inch or 10.1 inch screen. </s>
<s> The new Acer aspire one comes with 160GB hard drive, 1 GB of RAM and an atom processor for under 300 bucks. </s>
<s> These specs are fine for most home users and you can't argue with the price. </s>
<s> MSI's U100 Wind is also worth a look, I've had one of these for almost a year of trouble free use. </s>
