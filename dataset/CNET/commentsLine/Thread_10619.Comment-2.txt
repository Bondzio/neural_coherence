here's a start: pricegrabber.com with filters 1. external hard drive 2.
&gt;=300gb  also check sites like  for good limited time deals and rebates.
you just missed a 300gb external seagate drive (usb 2.0, 7200, 8mb) at compusa for $199 (after rebate) last week.
i know you want an external solution and, but if you decide to go internal, you can get awesome space for the price.
for less than $140, i have been using 500gb of extra storage (2 x 250gb western digital wd2500jb ata100, 7200rpm, 8mb).
got each one with $80 rebate.
you may need to pop in a cheap ata100/133 pci card to connect the drives to your system (used ~$5-10).
