i have 2 computers both win xp, a network laser printer, and a broadband internet connection, all hooked up to a linksys befsr41 router.
i had the 2 computers networked to each other but now i lost the connection between them and can't get them to find each other.
however each computer can access the internet through the router.
how come they can't find each other?
i have run the necessary xp programs and rebooted.
what could be the problem?
