hey guys.
i just got an hp pavilion a1010n pc bundle.
it has an 340 intel celeron d processor (2.93ghz), 512 pc2700 ddr sdram memory.
160gb 7200rpm ultra dma hard driveand dvd+-rw / cd-rw.
my &quot;know it all&quot; brother in law fried the processor i had bought from ebay because he did not do what ray had suggested to do and what i told him he had to do.
and i got so mad that i just decided to get a new pc/laptop for now.
so since i couldn't see the laptop i wanted before buying it (they didn't have it in the store, only online, and the other one wasn't put out on display), i went for the pc at best buy.
i'm still going to fix my old pc and maybe sell it or just keep it as a back up.
(any other suggestions?)
after the rebates, i'll be paying only $540 plus tax.
i think it's a good deal compared to what my old presario ended up costing 4 years ago.
but i will like your opinion, like always, cause you guys are the experts!
have a great day!
