&quot;i will move everything over to the new drive, and then make it the master.
is there a need to change anything in bios, or do i just switch the jumpers around and let the system boot up?&quot; too dependent on the machine in question.
the last time i did this, the bios settings were on auto and not even a jumper was moved because 80 conductor ide cables use the drives in cable select mode.
&quot;as far as transferring data, the new drive is a western digital and came with data lifeguard tools, which should do the trick, i believe.&quot; i've used that.
seems to work for most.
&quot;i will then use the old drive as my back-up drive.
is it okay to just leave the old drive in as a slave, and back-up to that on occasion?
or is there a chance that if the system crashes, both drives could be obliterated?&quot; i removed the drive for various reasons.
- the drive was smaller and slower and created too many questions about where to store files.
- i didn't want to upgrade the power supply or worry about cooling issues.
- yes.
data on writeable devices is at risk during any disaster.
bob and thanks for the tip about preferably limiting movie files to 1 hour.&quot;
