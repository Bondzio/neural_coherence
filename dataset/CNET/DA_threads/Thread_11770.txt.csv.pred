1.1.1	Hey everybody!	St
1.1.2	I've read the article titled &quot;Double Vision: Add a second monitor to your system&quot; and got interested.	St
1.1.3	I attached another monitor to my laptop and everything had been working just great until my notebook's screen started glitching - something wrong with LCD matrix, I guess.	St
1.1.4	So, my question is - how can I make my second monitor my primary screen?	St
1.1.5	I tried going to the Display-&gt;Properties-&gt;Displays (or something like that :)), where one can choose the primary screen, but all the option boxes are gray, and I can't click them... My nephew has been messing with my computer, so it could've been him... Could you please help me out?	St
1.1.6	Thank you!	St
1.2.1	anyone?	St
