i'm seeing close to 100% cpu usage in most things i do with my pc.
surfing the web or moving files around show normal usage for the most part, but games, my tv tuner when recording, or playing video files make it shoot up.
task manager shows nothing unusual.
scanned with spybot, ad aware, and avg anti virus.
i asked this question on another board, was told to post my hijack this log, nothing unusual showed up.
i identified and removed a half dozen processes, and removed some startup items.
no change.
so i unplugged my logitech usb gamepad, removed and cleaned my cpu fan and the cooling fins, then removed my video card and cleaned the fan.
both fans were pretty filthy, but it didn't make much of a difference.
any thoughts?
