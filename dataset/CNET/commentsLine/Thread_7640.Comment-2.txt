go to my computer &gt; properties &gt; advanced &gt; [performance] settings &gt; advanced &gt; virtual memory and tell us what it says.
also tell your total and free disc space from the properties of the drive the virtual memory is defined on (probably the c:-drive).
this will give a clear picture of the situation, so we can tell you what to do.
