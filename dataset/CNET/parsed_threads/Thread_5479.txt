<s> Which type of graphics card is better: ATI or NVIDIA? </s>
<s> One could point to those ATI 1GB video cards and call them the winner but that's as much money as some spend on the entire machine. </s>

<s> Nvidia. </s>
<s> The Best Gaming Video Cards for the Money: January 2007 </s>
<s> i think NVIDIA would be better for you becuase my 7600gs doesnt use a lot of power but it can do a lot of things for me </s>
<s> and so far I am very impressed. </s>
<s> It is $275 (newegg has a $45 rebate also for the next few days.) </s>
<s> I have only tries one game, Knights of the Old Republic 2 and although it's not the most graphic intensive game I am running everything on make and it's doesn't even seem to be trying. </s>
<s> ATI is AMD happy. </s>
<s> So do you mean that ATI would not be in its best performance when paired with Intel processor and NVIDIA with AMD processor??? </s>
<s> How do you know that ATI is AMD happy??? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
