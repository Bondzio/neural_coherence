Yeah, the movies are a big chunk.
I've discussed it with my ISP manager and he says he watches 3-4 movies per week and is still only using about 30G per month -- well below half of our use.
We average one per week or even per two weeks, so I don't think it's that.
I have unplugged a few devices, including the PS3 and so far haven't seen a decrease, but will continue to try that.
Thanks.
