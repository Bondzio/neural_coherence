I am currently doing research on a new computer.
I suggest the Athlon 64 socket 939 and compatible socket 939 motherboard.
It appears that socket &quot;A&quot; is going away, socket754 will be for Semprons and socket 939 for Athlon 64.
You no longer have to buy the high end Athlon 64 for socket 939 as it is available in the Athlon 64 3000+ on up.
Go with the latest technology to avoid premature obsolesence:)
