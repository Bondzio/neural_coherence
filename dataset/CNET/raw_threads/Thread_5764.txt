I had been having troubles with my printer...it would print part of the document and then print garbage on lots of other pages! I tried a complete new catridge...tried a different printer and yet the same problem occured! I also recently formatted my hard drive hoping that would help...but it didn't! Would i be right thinking that the port is the problem?? Can i use a cable that will connect to the printer and to a usb port instead of the seriel port?? Cheers Stuart
