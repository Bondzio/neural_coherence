I stupidly formatted the wrong hard drive when there are two external hard drives connected on my computer.
It is a WD external hard drive.
I heard about the data recovery software which could help restore the saved data back from a formatted drive.
But, I am afraid the program may make things worse.
Do I have to use a data recovery program to get back my videos?
Is there any one that could give me some suggestions?
Thanks!
