I would like to get her a wireless router and a wireless mouse for her unit. My question is, would all Linksys routers and all wireless mice work with Mac computers? I have never used a Mac and know very little about them. I don't want to get talked into buying expensive made for Mac Hardware when I don't really need to. Thanks

Unless there is some sort of specific functionality that the Linksys does that you require. 802.11g is standard and the built-in MacBook wireless does that. That said, a Linksys wireless router running 802.11g will work just fine with the MacBook. Please reference http://www.apple.com/macbook/wireless.html Wireless mouse: I use a Kensington. Works great.
