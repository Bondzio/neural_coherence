Since I have an enclosure, I thought it would be so much easier to clone the new drive externally. I didn't know it could be done through the USB port. Thanks for the info BOB

(for speed)	After doing this too many times over the years I noticed that write speed is slower over than read speed. This has lead to me putting the new drive inside the machine and the old drive outside in the USB case. DOWNSIDE? I have to watch my answers and clicks to what drive is the source and which is the one to write to but it may save me an hour. Bob
