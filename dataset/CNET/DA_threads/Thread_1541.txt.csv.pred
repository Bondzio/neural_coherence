1.1.1	I'm hoping someone here can help me.	St
1.1.2	I am using a D-Link DI-524 802.11g wireless/wired router.	St
1.1.3	I have spent the past several days trying to get everything working properly and quickly.	St
1.1.4	I have two computers that I want to connect wirelessly to the router.	St
1.1.5	When I connect using WiFi, I can generally maintain connection speeds of 54mbps.	St
1.1.6	However, when I run speed tests (and I have run many, many of them) I only get between 1 and 2 mbps using wireless.	St
1.1.7	When I plug my laptop directly into the router, I can get anywhere from 5-7 or so mbps.	St
1.1.8	Wireless transfers are even relatively slow when transfering files between my two computers.	St
1.1.9	I have tried several different types and brands of routers and I have changed all of the settings that I know about.	St
1.1.10	I've messed around with changing encryption levels and nothing really changes.	St
1.1.11	I have also tried changing channels, but nothing seems to really speed things up.	St
1.1.12	The fastest transfers I can ever get between my two systems run a little over 1 mb per sec, but it is usually around 300 k/sec or so, which is way too slow.	St
1.1.13	Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.	Polite
1.1.14	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	Wired speed can be 100 megabit full duplex on a switched hub when maintains speed due to the switch.	St
1.2.2	I'll leave you to learn why a switched hub matters.	Sug
1.2.3	Wifi might be 54 megabit HALF DUPLEX and is on a SHARED AIRSPACE which can easily be interfered with.	St
1.2.4	Your numbers are quite normal and you need to learn about the technology you are using.	St
1.2.5	I can't educate you about all this in this small space, but there are fine web contents that you can keep reading till it sinks in.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	a wireless &quot;G&quot; environment, will result in the lower speed being obtained.	St
1.3.2	A pure &quot;G&quot; network will yield better throughput.	St
