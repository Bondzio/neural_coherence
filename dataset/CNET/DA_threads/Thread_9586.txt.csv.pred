1.1.1	I have tried to make the best desktop possible with the budget I have .	St
1.1.2	CPU i-3 3220 3.30Ghz 16gb RAM GPU AMD 7750 2Gb 64gb SSD for the OS 250Gb HDD with 65 % free I Cant play Far Cry 3 , Whats going on ?	Ques
1.1.3	?	Ques
1.2.1	Two pieces of info that might be useful : 1 .	St
1.2.2	A link to the system requirements of the game 2 .	St
1.2.3	More information about WHY you ca n't play it , like & quot ; it does n't recognise the mouse & quot ; or & quot ; it says the monitor does n't have a supported resolution & quot ; or & quot ; it fails to install because it 's the 64-bit version and I have a 32 bit OS & quot ; .	St
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	The list looks like a nice run of the mill machine that should run the game .	St
1.3.2	But the OS setup could be incorrect in some way so ask the maker .	St
1.3.3	As no maker was noted , I ca n't look into this .	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	Are you saying , everything else works well even other games ?	Ques
1.4.2	But , when you play FC3 , it craps out .	St
1.4.3	What is the OS type ?	Ques
1.4.4	Does FC3 even start to play ?	Ques
1.4.5	What are the results of any other game ?	Ques
1.4.6	have all the latest drivers and patches been installed ?	Ques
1.4.7	How does the PC in general operate ?	Ques
1.4.8	http : //babysoftmurderhands.com/2012/12/far-cry-3-max-settings-graphics-system-requirements/ tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	Requirements are met , The peripherals are fine , during the game it crashes , which is only 30 seconds into the cut scene .	St
1.6.1	The maker ?	Ques
1.7.1	No , total war does not run that well , I am running windows 8 , I just downloaded AMD catalyst and maxed out the clock and memory speed .	St
1.7.2	It ran through the beginning cut scene and into a few minutes of game play then crash .	St
1.7.3	I made sure to download the latest drivers and patches for the game .	St
1.7.4	It is based off Uplay , and patches the game before I play .	St
1.7.5	PC began with issues , MEMORY MANAGEMENT when I installed the RAM in a 2,4 pattern in the sense 1,2,3,4 slots i used slots 2 and 4 .	St
1.7.6	That did n't help so I switched it to 1,2 and then installed another set of RAM in 3,4 .	St
1.7.7	I dont have that issue anymore .	St
1.8.1	Members need to tell all about the machines .	St
1.8.2	If they leave out details we lose a few rounds asking for that detail .	St
1.8.3	We know that self built units usually suffer from lack to updates to the hardware such as BIOS , drivers for EVERYTHING plus those helper apps .	St
1.8.4	For example I got my old desktop out and what a dog .	St
1.8.5	I got lucky in that I do this a lot and did a quick research about what drivers and apps were needed .	St
1.8.6	I started with the BIOS and the missing nugget for this one was Intel 's RST app .	St
1.8.7	That one is not a driver but for this machine , it 's needed to get the performance up .	St
1.8.8	Ask your machine 's maker for such a list .	St
1.8.9	Bob	St
1.9.1	I 'd try with default settings for clock and memory speed .	St
1.9.2	If it still does n't you go back to the shop where you bought the PC and let them fix it under warranty .	St
1.9.3	What happens if you reinstall the game from the original disk without any patches ?	Ques
1.9.4	It should work then.It 's the first thing the shop will ask you : stock settings and a stock game to prove the machine is defective .	St
1.9.5	If you assembled it yourself ( & quot ; tried to make & quot ; can be interpreted so ) it 's your own task to find out what 's wrong .	St
1.9.6	Kees	St
1.10.1	I & quot ; tried to assemble & quot ; myself , this is the first pc I ever built .	St
1.10.2	I understand its my own task to find out whats wrong .	St
1.10.3	I am in this forum to learn from other peoples oversights , I may have missed something .	St
1.10.4	I will try to reinstall the game .	St
1.10.5	thanks	Polite
1.11.1	Are folk that install Windows and think it gets all the drivers and helper apps .	St
1.11.2	Even in Windows 8 this fails today .	St
1.11.3	It 's up to the designer , builder and such to find all the updates , drivers and helper apps .	St
1.11.4	I ca n't guess all of them but if there is a downside to building it 's this .	St
1.11.5	The upside is you learn more than you bargained for .	St
1.11.6	My short check list is to work from the bottom up .	St
1.11.7	I update the bios and if cards have firmware updates I do all that before I install the OS .	St
1.11.8	Then the OS goes in and I find drivers for motherboard , audio , video and then the helper apps such as Intel 's RST , media controls , wifi control and more .	St
1.11.9	Figure on 10 to 15 packages on average .	St

1.12.2	The BIOS and Updates I will look into but I have updated both the hardware drives and helper apps like the AMD catalyst helped me actually get some play time , but still crashes .	St
1.13.1	I find fixing gaming problems too much of jumping thru the hoops .	St
1.13.2	What works for one game may not for another .	St
1.13.3	If you 've a bunch of gaming , you 'll find that easily is so .	St
1.13.4	Which is why i asked in my prior post .	St
1.13.5	Generally , speaking you have to settle the PC issues themselves before anything else .	St
1.13.6	In other words the PC must be in stock or default form , no hi-end setting or user introduced tweeks .	St
1.13.7	Just make sure it works beforew you move to gaming levels .	Sug
1.13.8	Then fine-tune the game to what the PC can offer .	St
1.13.9	The game setting are easier to adj .	St
1.13.10	than the PC , because the PC was working before you went the gaming route .	St
1.13.11	Which is why I offer in yet other posts , that basically want a & quot ; top-end PC & quot ; for gaming needs , because gaming is so power hungary for *ALL* resources whatever they may be .	St
1.13.12	Further , cooling is a big issue as i see it and better be good .	St
1.13.13	.	St
1.13.14	The i3 is a decent cpu but it is n't all that great for gaming , though better than older cpus .	St
1.13.15	Next , the Win8 OS , well that 's still open as how it handles gaming or what is still required for the best operation .	St
1.13.16	So , if you can accept basic or FC3 levels as they initially install , because it finds its own level of sorts .	St
1.13.17	If it seems to run then or not at all well , then maybe the PC itself still needs to be tweeked .	St
1.13.18	Tweeked as NOT simply asking for hi-performance setting but what makes the PC works with everything else besides gaming .	St
1.13.19	Any patches and drivers MUST be Win8 ready or capable , if MUST state so or be allowed using older Win7 offering .	St
1.13.20	Last , the game itself should support whatever is being given it .	St
1.13.21	Even , it accepts cpu level much lower than yours , it has to say somewhere , it supports the i3 from the makers itself .	St
1.13.22	Now , with all these drivers and patches and what have you , you basically create a new PC of sorts but do all these accept each other and not fall into a toxic mix .	St
1.13.23	Which is why i state , gaming problems tend to create issues regular PC wo n't see anywhere near as soon as loading some new game .	St
1.13.24	Also , since you build this yourself , you need to recheck all your work , do n't take anything for granted , yeah sometimes a boo-boo takes along time accept if some small detail was forgotten .	St
1.13.25	If you like , I suggest you get PCWizard 2012 and load it to see all the variables of your system PC has .	St
1.13.26	It provides deep details and important real facts of just what you have installed h/w and s/w .	St
1.13.27	Google for it .	St
1.13.28	Last , sometimes you 're too ahead of the gaming world .	St
1.13.29	Your h/w mix or system just needs a fix NOT YET available from the game maker .	St
1.13.30	You may want to check gaming websites to query there as those hot gamers may offer greater clues , tips , and/or hints to help you .	St
1.13.31	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.14.1	As I read you are changing clocks from stock I see a big reason to crash .	St
1.14.2	- & gt ; Did you go get the RAM & quot ; specs & quot ; and see if your BIOS settings match ?	Ques
1.14.3	That 's a pretty deep area that the maker of the PC ( you in this case ) have to sort out .	St
1.14.4	It 's an area that can really torque folk since they never imagined how much detail is required to integrate parts .	St
1.14.5	Bob	St
1.15.1	I never knew RAM had to be BIOS matched I always thought as long as it fit the slot it was fine .	St
