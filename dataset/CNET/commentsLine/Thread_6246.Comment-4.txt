you do make valid points.
it is important to know how long a business has been runing, especially when they are offering warrenty information.
if you visited archive.org, you would notice that in 2007, that visualdreamers was a movie selling company.
in 2009, it started selling computers.
if you feel like shellinng out 2000+ dollars to them, be my guest.
i don't like seeing people get sucked into these.
i was a victim before, luckily it only costed me 30 dollars.
