<s> My iomega (model GDHDU) external hard-drive has stopped working (I think it's approx. </s>
<s> 3 yrs old). </s>
<s> I've tried a new power cable and it still doesn't work. </s>
<s> Is there anything else I can try? </s>
<s> ( I was considering opening the case and using compressed air to clear any dust) Is there any way I can access any data stored on it? </s>
<s> Put the drive in a new case. </s>
<s> After that we have drivesavers.com But because we all have backup copies, it's usually cheaper to get a new drive. </s>

<s> Thanks for the advice, I will try that. </s>
<s> I have backups of files with Skydrive, but didn't know whether to still invest in an external hard-drive to back up. </s>
<s> As to getting another drive, even a memory stick has come way down in price. </s>
<s> For some folk, the stuff they can't lose fits on 2 to 32GB memory sticks. </s>
<s> And a nod to DROPBOX for another 2GB free. </s>
<s> I have a few photos there with things I can't lose as the fifth copy in another place. </s>
<s> It would be hard to delete all 5 copies. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks, I will bear this in mind as I do keep photos also on an SD card. </s>
