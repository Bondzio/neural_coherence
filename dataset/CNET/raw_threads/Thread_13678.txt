I've seen several 500GB drives on NewEgg.com for under $140 or so, but I would like to know what's a good one to get. The main host computer currently only has a USB 1.1 interface, runs Windows 2000 SP4, has the 137GB limit, a Promise Ultra-100 TX2 IDE controller (not that it matters for an external drive), a MSI K7T266 Pro2 mobo, a 1.4GHz Athlon CPU, 256MB RAM, etc. I don't know what (if any) hardware/software upgrade I will be able to do on this computer, but I am considering trying to get my dad (it's his computer - I don't have my own yet and can't afford it, especially considering the multimedia-intensive things I will be doing with it) to put in another GB or so of RAM, and upgrade to Windows XP. I WOULD be willing to consider putting in a USB 2.0 and/or Firewire and/or SATA interface card. I basically would like: fast transfer speeds - preferably no more than 10-15% slower than the internal 7200rpm 8MB buffer HDs. (Note referencing above: comp has 1.1 USB interface, I'm willing to get an upgrade card) don't want to spend more than about $100-130 or so (plus no more than $15-30 for an interface upgrade card) I don't know that I need one-touch backup or things like that. I will be using this as supplemental storage, not primarily as a backup drive. A couple reasons I'm getting an external drive as opposed to an internal one are because there really isn't a whole lot of room left in the tower, and I often will want to take the drive with me and plug it into other computers (some of which may have lesser specs than our computer, btw). (Also, we're running AVG Free edition (antivirus), which insists on scanning every single installed hard drive every single day (thankfully it lets you pause/cancel when it comes up, but it slows our computer down by a factor of 10 or more when it's running.)) So what are some models I should look at?

Sorry.	&quot;preferably no more than 10-15% slower than the internal 7200rpm&quot; Even USB 2.0 is a fraction of your normal IDE speeds so there are no USB drives that meet your spec. -&gt; However I find such to be quite useful.

(keep in mind I'll be using it with a 4+ year old computer.) Also, what about firewire, or external SATA interfaces / drives? I DO need to be able to stream high-definition uncompressed audio and video, often multiple streams, for editing and viewing on my local machine, allowing for any bottleneck RAM / CPU / etc might present. And, for a 500GB (or 400GB) drive, is there a level below which I should avoid (meaning drives more prone to failure, for example, not necessarily having fewer features), even if I have to up my budget to, say, $135-150 or so?
6931	3	256030	2538494	2538489	pianoplayer88key	7/12/07 11:55 PM	1.1842845E12	should have looked around a bit before hitting submit post..	what do you think of the first two on &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010150414%20131021357%201310221309%201035920386&bop=And&Order=PRICE&quot; &gt;this newegg site&lt;/a&gt; - the Cavalry CAXM37500 and the Western Digital ES WDG1SU5000N, both 500GB with USB/eSATA interface? Or is there something else I should look at? (btw, the WD drive is pushing my price limit a bit, but if it's otherwise a really good drive I may be willing to consider it.) Of course I'll need to get a USB 2.0 / Firewire / SATA interface card for our computer. (And, I still have that dang 127GiB 28bit LBA to deal with...)

However for the Mac you'll get firewire. Let me wrap this up in a nutshell. PC = USB 2.0, Apple = Firewire. About SATA and eSATA. The only problem here is the OS and drivers. If you can find good support to get it working this it can be exactly the same speed as the internals. I've seen some that never got it to work. Bob
6931	5	256030	2538793	2538574	pianoplayer88key	7/13/07 11:00 AM	1.1843244E12	yes...	Windows 2000 Professional SP4. Dad may consider an upgrade to XP, but I don't know when/if (within the next year or so) that'll happen. So with the software and hardware (plus an add-on adapter card (all we have now is USB 1) that we currently have, should I try SATA/eSATA? And how much slower is USB 2 than internal IDE?
6931	6	256030	2538831	2538793	R. Proffitt	7/13/07 11:29 AM	1.18432614E12	The issues you have to deal with...	Are more than usual. SATA came out long after Windows 2000 so you need to research not only if you can fit the SATA card but if that card has drivers for Windows 2000. As to the USB 2.0 it's under 1/2 the speed of IDE. This is why it didn't meet your criteria. But since it's just nearline storage why would it matter? I use mine and can play music, video just fine. Why such a hard criteria on speed? Bob
6931	7	256030	2538946	2538831	pianoplayer88key	7/13/07 1:23 PM	1.18433298E12	...	Oh, if it's only like as bad as 35-40% or so, whatever... I could probably live with that. When you said &quot;fraction&quot; in an earlier post I was thinking it was like 1/5 the speed or something like that. I just need to be able to stream uncompressed video (at least 640x480 24bpp 30fps) and audio (44.1kHz 16 bit stereo, maybe more channels) to/from the drive in real time. I was just looking on wikipedia, and the max burst speed of USB 2.0 is 480mbit/sec, or 60 mbyte/sec. Would that be enough for the data transfer I'll be doing? Also, is it possible to get a drive that maybe I'll use USB 2.0 for now, but later when I get a new computer I'll be able to take advantage of a faster interface?

6931	9	256030	2539126	2539089	pianoplayer88key	7/13/07 7:44 PM	1.18435584E12	yes there's a spare PCI slot...	and I'm leaning toward USB2 & SATA on the controller AND ext HD. Also, in case I want to use it with another device (don't have any right now though) that supports it, should I get a card that supports those PLUS firewire? And, should I specifically get an external hard drive, or should I get an internal + USB2 / eSATA enclosure? And, any recommendations on what specific model to get? I looked at NewEgg, and they have a Cavalry CAXM37500 for $122.99 (- rebate + shipping & tax) and a Western Digital My Book Premium ES WDG1SU5000N for $154.99. (They also have a Seagate FreeAgent Pro for $171.99, but that's more than I can afford. I DO need to buy the adapter card too.) Then... which add-on card to get? ENCORE ENLADP-402 - $19.99 - 4 ext USB 2.0, 2 int SATA Koutech USB2.0 & FireWire & SATA Combo PCI Card Model IO-PC820 - $49.99 (more than I want to pay) - 2 ext firewire, 1 ext SATA, 2 ext USB ports Or is there another one I should look at? I'd like to spend no more than $25-35 and get at least 4 - 6 external ports, distributed between USB 2.0 & SATA, with at least 2 of each type. I am leaning away from firewire for now, cause I don't think I need it just yet. I may have 2 available slots... should I get separate cards for USB & SATA?: the $20 ENCORE card mentioned above, plus... BYTECC BT- PCI-SATA150 - $21.99 - 2 ext SATA ports (total combined price would still be less than the $50 card, and I'd have 2 each of internal AND external SATA ports.)

It is too slow for my liking. As for internal vs. external, internally you might save $20/$30. Of course externally has its own advantages though.
6931	11	256030	2539232	2539149	pianoplayer88key	7/13/07 9:06 PM	1.18436076E12	seriously considering external....	...cause I will be frequently moving it from PC to PC, and therefore it won't be plugged in all the time.
6931	12	256030	2539514	2539232	R. Proffitt	7/14/07 6:37 AM	1.18439502E12	Moving from machine to machine = No fun.	eSATA has not reached the point I would consider this. With each machine you have to not only obtain the eSATA card and connectors but do battle with the OS to install SATA support. If you haven't installed Windows 2000/XP onto a SATA drive you may be in for a rude shock. -&gt; I also get the feeling you want to put a game that you want to run on various machines. Even with the drive being portable the big problem is that with Windows programs rarely move with the external drives. That is the owner installs an external drive, installs BattleField on it and then takes the drive to a friends house. BF won't run! Let me be frank, honest and offer my best advice here. Go get your USB 2.0 card and your USB 2.0 drive and let it work without you heading down a dark path to a blind alley. You will read those that will push eSATA but did they get it working on your Windows 2000 machine? Bob
6931	13	256030	2545013	2537353	froasier	7/21/07 12:15 AM	1.1849769E12	for moving around	I would get a USB 2.0 card, just because that's useful for lots of things. Then get a drive or enclosure that supports USB 2.0, and possibly also firewire and/or eSATA. I have a 320GB WD 7200RPM IDE drive in a USB2/Firewire enclosure. I normally use it with firewire and when i move between computers with firewire or usb it works fine. I assume switching from eSATA would work just as well, but don't take my word for it. So to sum up: if you want maximum speed, go with eSATA. If you want easy compatibility and portability, go with USB 2.0. I use firewire because I already have so many USB devices plugged in :P and it's about the same speed as USB 2.0. One final tip: when you get everything bought and plugged in, make sure the firmware is up to date. My enclosure was pretty unstable with firewire until i updated the firmware. Now it hardly ever glitches. (What was happening was during a large or continuous transfer randomly the transfer would hang and windows would say &quot;delayed write failed&quot;, so I'd have to unplug the drive and plug it back in and restart the transfer.)

6931	15	256030	2545435	2545038	rsternb	7/21/07 2:30 PM	1.1850282E12	shop around	For your hard drive. I agree with above but I also dissagree with maxtor or western - well western may not be bad - havent heard much on it. I live with seagate - I have some that have been runing for 10 years. maxtor has a 13month avg. life span. ted
6931	16	256030	2545502	2537353	santuccie	7/21/07 3:15 PM	1.1850309E12	Not even CLOSE	I am of the understanding that your motherboard has 4 USB 2.0 ports, and 4 USB 1.1 ports, no? Anyway, you have a 66 MHz PCI controller. Depending on the speed of your internal drive, you could get up to 200 MB/s transfer rate, compared with only 60 on USB 2.0. On 1.1, it's much, MUCH slower. Your transfer rate on a USB 1.1 port maxes out at 12 mbps, or 1.5 megabytes per second. That's slooooooow.
