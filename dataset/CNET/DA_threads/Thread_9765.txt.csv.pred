1.1.1	Hello , I have an & quot ; Optiplex GX280 , I have 4 slots for memory and & quot ; Crucial says after a scan that I can max out at 4GB 's .	St
1.1.2	I have purchased 4 1GB sticks of memory , I 've installed them and when the PC turns on it says it has 4 GB 's of memory but when I click on & quot ; system information , it reads only 2.99 Gb 's .	St
1.1.3	what 's the deal ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.4	I appreciate any help , thanks !	Polite

1.2.2	My Windows 7 system ( where I type this ) says & quot ; Installed RAM : 4 GB & quot ; , & quot ; Total physical memory 2.93 GB & quot ; .	St
1.2.3	I assume most of that missing 1 GB is used for video , because it does n't have a separate video card .	St
1.2.4	But I do n't really care .	St
