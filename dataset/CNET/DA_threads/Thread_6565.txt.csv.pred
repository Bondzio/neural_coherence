1.1.1	Trying to rule out power supply and video card , before motherboard .	St
1.1.2	I followed instructions in another thread about measuring voltages with the computer on .	St
1.1.3	The 12v and 5v rail checked out OK .	St
1.1.4	I was not able to find an AUX connector .	St
1.1.5	Is there a 3V aux with my computer ?	Ques
1.1.6	e machines T6420 Athlon 64 3400+ Here are the symptoms : On a few occasions , my computer would kick into a mode with the fans racing after I walked away for an hour or two .	St
1.1.7	( had to hold power button in for 10 seconds to turn off ) Sometimes the screen saver would be frozen also and I detected sounds .	St
1.1.8	I turned off the hibernate mode thinking that might be causing this glitch but it recurred again with the fans racing .	St
1.1.9	The last time this happened I turned the computer back on and the fans stayed in this racing mode and the screen remained black .	St
1.1.10	( Wo n't boot } The video is nVidea GeForce 6100 and I assume this is built in as there are no other cards .	St
1.1.11	Could this be why I have no monitor ( amber light is on ) yet monitor works with my other computer ?	Ques
1.1.12	Would putting another video card in the open pci slot bypass the built-in video ?	Ques
1.1.13	Thank you	St
1.2.1	sounds more like a mobo problem to me .	St
1.2.2	have you tried clearing your cmos and booting from default settings ( i doubt if it will help but if its a bad mobo there 's not much you can do besides replace it ) .	St
1.3.1	Your fans run on 12v .	Sug
1.3.2	The 3.3v are for the processor and memory .	St
1.3.3	Look for & quot ; bleeding & quot ; capacitors .	St
1.3.4	You PSU is probably not the problem .	St
1.3.5	And neither is your video card .	St
1.3.6	Sooooooo ... . guess that leaves the mobo .	St
1.3.7	Sorry .	St
1.3.8	and life goes on ... Jack	St
1.4.1	How do I check for 3.3V AUX as I do n't see a connector like that to test ?	Ques
1.4.2	What exactly am I looking for with a bleeding capacitor .	St
1.4.3	Is this a visual check , and what will you see ?	Ques
1.5.1	Pictures galore ...	St
1.6.1	Thanks R. Proffitt , I found no leakage or expansion so at least visually they look OK .	St
1.6.2	This board is 1 yr. old though I understand it can happen with new ones too .	St
1.6.3	How do I check for the 3.3V to the CPU as that 's the one voltage I have n't been able to check .	St
1.6.4	In another thread , someone posted a link with pictures showing how to check these voltages but it failed to discuss the details about the AUX if mine actually has one ?	Ques
1.6.5	There are 2 connectors from the power supply to the board .	St
1.6.6	How would you know if it 's the CPU or the motherboard if that is the problem ?	Ques
1.7.1	How would you know if it 's the CPU or the motherboard if that is the problem ?	Ques
1.7.2	Sadly you need a good board to test the CPU on .	St
1.7.3	Power supplies are thankfully plentiful at the shop bench .	St
1.7.4	- & gt ; About the other items .	St
1.7.5	Be sure to check the CMOS battery voltage too .	St
1.7.6	On some boards if it 's too low , the board never comes out of reset .	St
1.7.7	Bob	St
1.8.1	Battery voltage was 3.3 for a CR 2032 .	St
1.8.2	After doing this I read you need to write down settings which I did n't do .	St
1.8.3	Of course the system is not booting up anyway and the monitor is blank .	St
