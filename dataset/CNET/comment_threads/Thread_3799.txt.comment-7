wow, I'm considering the p5k MOBO.
too bad I cans use graphics cards in SLI, or can I?
I'll do more into it.
I just saw that the MOBO promotes ATI crossfire, can i use the geforce 8 series on these, and if i can, can i SLI them?
Sounds like a stupid question, but i just want to through it out there to understand the role a MOBO has in relation with graphic cards and the cards manufacture.
Thanks for the link, I am looking at getting the intel core 2 extreme QX6800 with a clock speed of 2.95 and overclocking it.
I figured with the QX6800 stock speed, when I overclock it, it will be less stress on the CPU and heat output.
I read in a forum that the max overclocking of those are in the 3.4 range to be stable, I'll probably sit just under that around 3.3 or 3.2. does this make sense?
