<s> Last night I installed a brand new Western Digital hard drive into my wife's PC. </s>
<s> I partitioned it and set it up so window's sees it. </s>
<s> Problem is, now the system keeps crashing every so often....it will either crash a game being played or completely shut down the computer. </s>
<s> The one thing that I noticed right off the bat was that the main hard drive is set to Master and this new drive is set to Secondary Master, but after the computer started up I figured it must be ok. That's the only conflict I can think of that might be screwing things up. </s>
<s> Any ideas on why it might be crashing? </s>
<s> Thanks!! </s>

<s> Ideally you want the second hard drive on the Primary controller as Slave. </s>
<s> What is the Wattage rating of your Power Supply Unit? </s>
<s> your crashes could be coincidental. </s>
<s> if possible, use cable select drive settings and place the new drive on the middle connector, not the end. </s>
