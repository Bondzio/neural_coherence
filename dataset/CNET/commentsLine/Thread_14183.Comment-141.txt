i had a commodore vic 20 with expanded ram - 8kb and used it for essays and word processing in school.
my printer, top of the line wouldn't print superscripts and best font at the same time!
i moved on to a sinclair - i think they called it an z80 with an amazing 128 k of ram.
finally, around 1982 or 83, i leaped forward to an xt clone.
