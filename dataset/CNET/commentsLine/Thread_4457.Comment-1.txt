i have a hp dv6000 laptop.
it is almost 2 years old.
since yesterday, the display has not been working.
whenever i switch on the laptop, i can only see 'static', sort of like the image old tv's would show when the signal was lost.
i can hear the hard drive starting up, but there is nothing on the display...what should i do?
thanks
