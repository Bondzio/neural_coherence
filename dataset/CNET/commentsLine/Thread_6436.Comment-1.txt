i just bought an lcd tv, a toshiba, and i also own a ps3 80gb.
i will be putting the tv on this media stand i got from office depot, with the ps3 under it.
i want to get a surge protector that you directly plug into both sockets on wall, has minimum 6 plugs, and protects the cable tv line.
the reason for the number of outlets is i will also be plugging in my cell phone charger and a lamp, as the stand is next to a desk.
i want it wall-mountable to save room.
