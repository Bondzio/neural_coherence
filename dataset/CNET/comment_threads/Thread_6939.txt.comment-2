and you can use a boot floppy to see what happens.
Have you tried the BIOS jumper to reset the BIOS to the default???
Is this a Gigabyte mobo with the dual BIOS???
If so read the manual as to how to get the backup BIOS to be used.
All Mfr's say to only update the BIOS if it is needed to correct a specific problem that you are having and that the new BIOS is intended to correct.
I know that Robert tells everyone to update the BIOS, but it can be a risk.
The Gigabyte dual BIOS systems that I have seen have the CMOS chips [2 of them] soldered in, thus getting a new chip is not likely, unless mobo is sent back to Gigabyte.
Let us know what you find out.
