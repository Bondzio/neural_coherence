1.1.1	I currently have 2 Seagate 500GB SATA II HDDs in a RAID 0 array with 128k stripe.	St
1.1.2	The RAID controller is an Intel Matrix Storage Manager.	St
1.1.3	First question, is that a software implementation?	St
1.1.4	Second, I would like to buy 2-10k raptors and put them into a RAID o for perforance, image the Seagates to a 5th &quot;working drive&quot;, copy that image to the raptors setup in a RAID 0, clean everything but the OS and apps, and then use the Seagates in a RAID 1 array (mirror) for pictures, mp3s, etc.	St
1.1.5	Is this possible?	St
1.1.6	Do I need a hardware controller to do it?	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions/recommendations would be greatly appreciated.	St
1.2.1	It's in the FAQ at http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/imsm/	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the link.	St
1.3.2	I will do some reading there.	Sug
1.3.3	If anyone has any recommendationas they would still be appreciated.	Ques
1.4.1	I keep coming down on RAID 1 since it's not a viable backup solution.	St
1.4.2	I can't count how many think it is but when I delete a file from one, it's gone on the second drive too.	St
1.4.3	Also I've see the primary drive corrupt and find the mirror is corrupt as well.	St
1.4.4	A dead end for most in my view.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	I also backup my sensitive files (pictures, spreadsheets, etc.)	St
1.5.2	on an external HD.	St
1.5.3	If the internal gets corrupted is it likely that they external will as well?	St
1.6.1	With RAID 1 it's automatic...	St
1.7.1	I understand that the RAID 1 will automatically mirror the files....is there anyway to check files that are being backed up to the external to determine if there is corruption?	St
1.7.2	And then to automatically fix them?	St
1.8.1	Articles about MD5SUM.	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	using SATA drives.	St
1.10.2	I can't say the same for PATA, however.	St
1.10.3	Of course accidental deletions or copying of corrupt data is a pure loss but I've had &quot;hiccups&quot; on one drive in a set that were recoverable and have lost a drive in a set that allowed the other to run ok until I could replace it's dead mate.	St
1.10.4	Another time I had a bad power connector that caused one drive to spin down intermittently causing a data mismatch which was recoverable by booting to the hardware rebuild utility.	St
1.10.5	It took a doggone long time...overnight in fact...for the rebuild...but it did survive.	St
1.10.6	I'd agree it's not a sole basket to keep your eggs in, however as I have lost other data due to human error.	Res
