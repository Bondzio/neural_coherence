<s> What is the best way to set up a laptop with multiple LAN's? </s>
<s> I need one set up with a static IP address. </s>
<s> Can I designate a priority of which LAN connection to use? </s>
<s> I know I can enable and disable the connections but thought there might be a better method. </s>
<s> The laptop uses Windows 2000 over ethernet cabling for internet access and is sometimes removed from the internet and used to connect to an industrial printer with a cross over cable in a different location(different building). </s>
<s> The laptop is being shared for these two tasks. </s>
<s> Thanks for your input Mike </s>
<s> For that I would consider http://www.netswitcher.com Bob </s>
<s> I'm sorry for posting a message in others people post, but I thing its related to the topic .. What is the 'Alternate Location' setting in TCP/IP for? </s>
<s> Can it be use for multiple LAN in question? </s>
<s> If indeed it could be used, how do you configure it? </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
