1.1.1	I have the MERCURY p1845gvm-p Motherboard .	St
1.1.2	I earlier had 128mb ddr 440 or 490 RAM .	St
1.1.3	I purchased a new 256 DDR-2100 ram .	St
1.1.4	When i installed the new ram and restart , the display stays off and there is a beeping sound .	St
1.1.5	Do i have to make any changes in ths BIOS please help !	St
1.1.6	!	St
1.2.1	the mobo does n't seem to like the new ram .	St
1.2.2	try clearing your cmos and attempting to boot again .	Sug
1.2.3	i could n't find a manual on your mobo , but typically there 's a jumper on the mobo that must be closed ( a pin block placed on it ) for about 30 secs , then opened again ( the pin block removed ) .	St
1.3.1	Make sure it is pushed in correctly , if that doesnt work , take out the & quot ; watch battery & quot ; on your mobo , and let it sit for 30 seconds .	St
1.3.2	Put it back in and see if it works , if not , put the old memory back in and see if that works , than try again .	St
1.3.3	You shouldnt have to change any bios settings	St
1.4.1	Heard of DDR 400 [ PC3200 } , never heard of DDR 490 , [ DDR 500 is PC4000 , DDR466 is PC 3700 ] nor DDR 2100 .	St
1.4.2	If that , perchance , is PC 2100 , that is DDR 266 , much slower than the other memory and certainly ca n't be expected to run at the DDR 400 clock rate .	St
