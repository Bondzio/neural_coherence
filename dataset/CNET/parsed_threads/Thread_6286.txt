<s> Hello All, I just started collecting and buying parts to build a PC. </s>
<s> I want to take your opinion on what type of processor I should get. </s>
<s> I am looking for a GREAT performance processor. </s>
<s> I will be doing moderate work and multitasking. </s>
<s> I am not big on gaming, so I do not want processor that will make me go broke. </s>
<s> Any recommendations will be great Thanks </s>
<s> ...then we can eliminate the fastest (and most expensive) CPU's. </s>
<s> You may not even need a quad core processor if you're only doing multitasking and work - so long as none of that work involves intensive calculations; e.g., video and audio file processing. </s>
<s> Given that, I'd recommend one of the midrange Intel or AMD processors. </s>
<s> Intel CPU's tend to be faster at a given range than AMD, but AMD CPU's tend to be less expensive at a given performance level. </s>
<s> Try the manufacturers' websites, as they both offer tools to choose the right CPU for you. </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com (click on &quot;Play - Intel for consumers,&quot; then &quot;Find the right processor.&quot;) http://www.amd.com (click on &quot;At Home&quot;, then select &quot;Help Me Decide&quot; under the &quot;Tools&quot; heading on the right side of the page.) </s>
<s> When you've narrowed the choice down, then start searching online vendors as well as local brick and mortar vendors in your area for prices. </s>
<s> Two notes: 1) You don't say what operating system you'll be using, but I'd recommend that you get 3 GB RAM. </s>
<s> 3 GB RAM is the best amount if you'll be using Vista, and it certainly wouldn't hurt in an XP system. </s>
<s> 2) Remember that a choice of CPU immediately dictates what motherboards you can use; make sure that the mobo you choose has the features that you'll need and that the CPU will support those features (usually not a problem). </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Paul </s>
<s> You were a great help, THANK YOU! </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010340343%201050722265&bop=And&Order=PRICE the e7300 is a great processor for $125 and e7400 is $140. </s>
<s> the 3ghz e8400 is $170 and will give you top-notch performance. </s>
<s> (it's as fast as last year's $900 extreme processors.) </s>
<s> My computing needs are, I think, very similar to yours, so let me fill you in on the machine I bought when my ancient PC finally gave up the ghost. </s>
<s> Now, I bought, not built, but it might give you an idea of what I was saying. </s>
<s> Gateway GT5654 AMD Athlon Dual Core 5000+ (2.60 GHz actual clock speed) 3GB RAM 300 gig SATA hard drive DVD-RW drive Multiple format card reader Windows Vista Home Premium All I've added to it is a 320 gig hard drive, a second DVD-RW drive and a Creative sound card to replace the onboard audio. </s>
<s> I'm considering adding a midrange Nvidia video card, but haven't decided whether I really want to do that. </s>
<s> I web surf, do word processing/spreadsheets, watch video and listen to music and other routine tasks. </s>
<s> With a cable broadband connection, the machine's plenty fast for me... </s>
