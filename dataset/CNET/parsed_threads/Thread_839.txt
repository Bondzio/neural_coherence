<s> I am wondering your thoughts on the Dell Vostro 220. </s>
<s> It seems to have descent specs and I found it under $400. </s>
<s> My goal is to buy a new pc to use as a home media center. </s>
<s> I want something with a dual or quad core, good speed, over 2 GB memory, plenty of hard drive space, etc. </s>
<s> Do you think this is a good reliable pc? </s>
<s> Or do you recommend something else? </s>
<s> Thanks for any suggestions and/or advice. </s>

<s> plenty of hard drive space How much? </s>
<s> I'm leaning towards the Dell Latitude D630. </s>
<s> And yea, I guess it's reliable. </s>
<s> Someone I know had a Vostro and he liked it. </s>

<s> also check the Asus EEE net/notebooks, HP net/notebooks and DELL net/notebooks. </s>
