Ok I just changed it to port forward to another web server I have and it will connect to that in the browser outside the network no problem.
This leads me to believe it's an issue with the PI and not the network.
I will have to do more research.
I can connect to the pi by it's internal IP address however so I am not sure why I can't connect by port forwarding.
