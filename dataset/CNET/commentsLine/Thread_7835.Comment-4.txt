based on the information from d-links website, i would say windows 98 first edition may have a problem with this adapter.
workarounds are: 1) upgrade the os 2) place the wireless router near the 98 machine and use a cat5 cable to it.
of course some type of ethernet adapter would need to be installed in the machine.
a multiported wireless router which feature both wired and wireless capabilities from d-link or linksys are among the most popular devices used.
