<s> Hi, I am planning on getting a new video card, since my old Nvidia Geforce FX 5200 is fried after I overclocked it, and I'm wondering if anyone can tell me if a Nvidia Geforce FX 5700VE is a killer card for gaming. </s>
<s> I mean, if it is, would it be better than a 5700LE or a 5700 Ultra. </s>
<s> By the way, the card is PNY brand. </s>
<s> an FX 5700VE and no, it wouldn't be a killer card for gaming consider something like a GeForce 6600GT or maybe a 6800nU...if you have the cash for it i'd avoid Radeon X series, with the exception of RAdeon X1800, but that's REALLY EXPENSIVE vs the performance it offers </s>
<s> and capability. </s>
<s> I'm pretty well pleased with my GeForce 6200TC. </s>
<s> I just gave 47 dollars for it at Newegg and am surprised how well it plays games. </s>
<s> But, of course, how well any card plays depends greatly on system specs. </s>
<s> A 5700 Ultra is generally much costlier than the cards of the same number and if you are going to spend $120 to $160 or so, I certainly look at a GeForce 6600GT. </s>
<s> Now I know that 6600GT and 6800 are way better than my 5700VE, but they are overpriced! </s>
<s> I am looking for something that costs like 5700VE, around 120-140 bucks, but couldn't find 6600GT or 6800 video cards with these prices anywhere! </s>
<s> but if cant afford try going for a vanilla 6600. it is just a tad bit slower than the 6600gt and is much better than the 5200 so u should see an improvement. </s>
<s> You said you have about 140 so get the geforce 6600gt from newegg. </s>
<s> You will not regret it unless your'e looking forward to playing games with 1434 fps with outstainding ultra maximum anti aliasing. </s>
<s> Oh and make sure your power supply is good. </s>
<s> I've heard people say not enough power supply and the old power supply might die. </s>
