my desktop hard drive recently failed, and i need to purchase a new one.
problem is, i've never replaced a hard drive before.
my desktop's specifications are here:  what kind of hard drive should i purchase?
will any sata hard drive be compatible with my computer?
i can't afford something exceedingly expensive.
space should be between 1-2 tb.
would this work with my computer?
thanks, and sorry for all the links.
