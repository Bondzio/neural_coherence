i've had that problem also as you describe.
it seems to be a problem with wd drives.
i had a wd book drive and used it for the same purposes as you.
frequently it would not recognized by the computer.
i hooked it to a laptop, sometine it would work, other time it would not.
i finally read somewhere that you should plug the power directly into a wall plug and use extension cords or the bricks we use to protect against power surges.
tried that and it worked most of the time.
finally i did a check disk on it and found it had developed bad sectors, fixed those, lost the data that was in those sectors, but was finally able to get most of the files off onto another disk.
you can be sure its replacement was not a wd.
try plugging it right into a wall socket.
even then, it goes to sleep after short period of inactivity and has to be unplugged and plugged in again to access the data.
