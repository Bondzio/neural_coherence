(I'm in UK by the way and have a BT Homehub with three ethernet ports, one of which is free) Knocking about somewhere I have an old Tecom router that I could use if that's the route that I need to go down I know there's a lot of questions there but can someone tell me in words of no more than two sylables how I can set up a network? Thanks
