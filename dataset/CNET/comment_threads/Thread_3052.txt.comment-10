To use recovery CDs we must follow their instructions.
If we use XP CDs then we use what you see on the internet.
Of course this begs the question if Avertec has proper restore CDs.
Such (in my opinion) should work when we put in a new black drive since hard disks do fail.
Your choice on the matter but why not wipe the drive and find out?
