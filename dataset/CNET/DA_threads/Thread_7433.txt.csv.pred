1.1.4	Nowhere have I run into any DVD ROM driver info for this seemingly generic device .	St

1.2.1	Windows 98 did n't know about DVDROM drives and would report it as a CDROM except in some well installed instances .	St

1.2.3	99 % of the time , the motherboard drivers do n't get installed .	St
1.2.4	Beyond that , it 's just a very old OS that did n't know about such a drive .	St
1.2.5	If it plays a DVD with the DVD software , then it 's done .	St
