1.1.1	Hello all , I was wondering which set DDR3 would be faster for a gaming computer ... 4xGig DDR3 1066Mhz with a Cas Latency of 7-7-7-20 or 4xGig DDR3 1333Mhz with a Cas Latency of 9-9-9-27 Thank you in advance !	St
1.2.1	the tighter timings for the ddr3-1066 wo n't overcome a speed grade and the ddr3-1333 will still be faster .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.anandtech.com/memory/showdoc.aspx ? i=2989 & p=7 p.s .	St
1.2.3	: notice that ddr2-1066 performs best .	St
1.2.4	if you have n't bought the mobo yet , you might want to save money and stick with ddr2 .	St
1.2.5	if you want the best performance , go with ddr3-1600 cl6/7 or faster .	St
1.2.6	it will outperform practically any ddr2 configuration .	St
