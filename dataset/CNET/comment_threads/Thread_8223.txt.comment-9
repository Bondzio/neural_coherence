To have you think about the question.
Given the Ford vs. Chevy nature of the products, how would we choose?
I still like internals for the very simple reason they last longer because: a.
It's more protected.
b.
People tend to not drop a PC tower.
c. They turn it off to move it.
d. All of the above.
c. All of the above and more.
e. None of the above.
I hope you see the Chevy vs. Ford issue here.
