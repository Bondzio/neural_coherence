ok, i have 3 computers all running xp home.
i networked them and the only thing that is shared should be the shared documents folder (which i can see).
one of the computers has the printer shared to the laptop when i go to print and i am not sure why since i did not share it.
is it because there are multiple users for that computer (ex, mom, dad, kids)?
