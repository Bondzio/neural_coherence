1.1.1	I am seeking an external hard drive to serve as the backup medium for all of the PCs in my home.	St
1.1.2	Preferences are at least 500 GB of space, capable of backing up a PC hard drive as a disk image, ease of use software (simple enough for my wife and daughter to use), and incremental (daily) backup option .	St
1.1.3	Any suggested drives, or any to avoid?	St
1.1.4	I'm considering Iomega Pro, Transcend Store Jet Mobile, Seagate FreeAgent Go Flex.	St
1.1.5	Also would appreciate suggestions for online storage sites with no frills, easy to use, free or low cost.	Polite
1.1.6	Thank you in advance.	St

1.2.3	Moreover, you should avoid all maker specific backup software, because of possible incompatibility with anothe drive, another PC, recovery software and what's more.	St
1.2.4	Go for well-known drive-maker-independent software.	St
1.2.5	So any basic 1 TB USB2 drive would be perfect, hardwarewise.	St
1.2.6	Kees	St
