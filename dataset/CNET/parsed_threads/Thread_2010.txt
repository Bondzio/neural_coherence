<s> I have an old computer, AMD XP at 1.1Mhz. </s>
<s> 60GB HD. </s>
<s> I guess it's about 3 years old, maybe more. </s>
<s> I have run W2000 from the gitgo. </s>
<s> Sometimes it runs slow and I think it's time to reinstall windows. </s>
<s> I have the original W2000 disks. </s>
<s> I would like to copy all pertinent information. </s>
<s> Programs are no problem since I have all original disks. </s>
<s> My problem is with things like passwords saved, email messages saved, favorites etc. </s>
<s> My data files, like Excell spreadsheets I have created are no problem since I am able to save those to CD. </s>
<s> My problem is I don't know exactly what else to save and how. </s>
<s> For example, I don't know the location for my favorites that I use when I'm on the web. </s>
<s> I am using IE, latest version. </s>
<s> Lastly, should I consider just junking this computer and getting a new P4? </s>
<s> I would still need to know how to copy pertinent information. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Have done any maintance?? </s>
<s> Disk cleanup or Defrag?? </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> I defrag regularly. </s>
<s> Run Norton antivirurs etc. </s>
<s> Also MS anti-spyware. </s>
<s> I just think it's time to reinstall W2000. </s>
<s> I'll feel better if I do </s>
<s> You seem more of the user variety and may have difficulty with motherboard and more drivers that Microsoft will not find and install for you. </s>
<s> Since you don't backup, it's too likely you will lose something or everything since your skill levels appear to need a little work. </s>
<s> But there is hope. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Look up EWIDO on download.com and use that to eject what it finds. </s>
<s> Your tools are known to have a few holes in them. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> BACKUP. </s>
<s> That's the big issue along with you might make ONE BACKUP only to discover it can't be restored. </s>
<s> Make 2 or 3 (I have no less than 3.) </s>
<s> Now is not the time to entertain a wipe and install. </s>
