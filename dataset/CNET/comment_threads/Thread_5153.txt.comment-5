Several reasons may explain this: 1) You may have a driver problem that does not handle the network adapter correctly; This may happen is at times, you have installed a wrong driver that appears to work perfectly with the hardware.
2) Your cable modem may require a firmware upgrade-consult your modem manufacturer site for more details.
I suppose you are using a router.
3) You may have a trojan horse on your computer.
4) Too many p2p software tend to burst connections.
I would advise you to disable p2p applications and test the connection anew.
In any case, I have written a small program that you can download at: http://rapidshare.com/files/4122211/loose_connec.rar.html Please send your feedback.Thank you.
