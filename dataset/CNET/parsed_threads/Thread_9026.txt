<s> This should be a fairly easy question I was just wondering if i buy a graphics card that is pci express 2.0 will it run in a standard pci express x 16 slot? </s>
<s> &quot;PCIe 2.0 is backward and forward compatible with PCIe v1.x. </s>
<s> Graphic cards and motherboards designed for v2.0 will be able to work with v1.1 and v1.0, and vice versa. </s>
<s> In some rare cases it is possible that a PCI-E 2.0 card will not work correctly on a PCI-E 1.0a slot. </s>
<s> This is only limited to certain video cards.&quot; But since you declined specifics this is all that can be told. </s>
<s> well this seems to be what i was asking for i couldnt give much specifics because im looking a graphics cards and almost everyone that interested me was a 2.0 and my motherbaord only has the standard pci express slots and my current graphics card is a pci-e x16 </s>
<s> Sometimes our members will share they did that or find reports of it working fine or not. </s>
<s> thats the thing i havent decided which one i want yet other than i know i want it to be a Nvida and most of the ones that i have looked are 2.0 </s>
<s> details and specifics are where things potentially can go wrong, so like Bob said, when you have details it'd not be a bad idea to run it up the flagpole. </s>
<s> Of course if you buy from reputable place they'll have a fair return policy (stores near where I live give 14 to 30 days - one mom-n-pop store gives just 7 days for refund, but will return for store credit up to 4 weeks). </s>
<s> I remember reading a report where they ran cards in PCIe 1x vs 2.0. </s>
<s> Not only did they work well in both, but there wasn't appreciable performance difference -- the diffs between cards is much bigger than the diffs btwn old and new PCIe. </s>
<s> As always, YMMV... </s>
<s> The PCIe 2.0 cards are backwards compatable to PCIe x16. </s>
<s> I just installed a GEforce 8800GT PCIe 2.0 card in a computer that has PCIe x16 motherboard and it installed without a hitch and is working fine. </s>
