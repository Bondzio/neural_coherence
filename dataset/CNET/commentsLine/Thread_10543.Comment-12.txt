first no matter what version of windows is installed, a single harddrive will hold the operating system and unless you have some reason to reformat this drive or double boot then i would suggest that you keep it as is .... note: .... before you start .... pull the power cord out...its a must as the motherboard still has power to it even when shut off!!!!!
next; ground yourself and the computer case to ground to avoid electrostatic discharge, before touching any internal components try to keep contact to the metal chassic to equilize your body potential which can rise to 2500 volts or more just by body movements i,ve measured them, leather soled shoes would be better but constant chassic contact is best....... installed harddrive; change the jumper to master or leave, if installing new hd on the secondary channel new harddrive; strap as a slave or install on the secondary channel as master or cable select bios recognition may be automatic but if its not you may have to go into setup, i believe f2 at boot.
now just install on the cables.... note: the cable has a polarity ie.
there is a pin 1 and an end pin .. you have to put pin 1 to pin 1, the power cable connector has a specific shape.
look befor you jump ok... now use partition magic or another partitioning tool to set partitions on the drives you have.... why?
well if your operating system is on one partition when you encounter a operating system failure via a virus or inadvertant driver loss then rebuilding wont mean the loss of all of you computer data ... eg.
partitions examples apps, data, downloads, temporary, video, music anything you want ..... think of it as a large file cabinet with specific drawers .... old addage &quot;don't put all your eggs in 1 basket&quot; if it drops what happens.... hope thats of some help have fun
