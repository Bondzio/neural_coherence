1.1.1	I 'm trying to flash my Liteon LTC-48161H DVD/CD Combo Drive .	St
1.1.2	I downloaded the lastest fw from Liteon & quot ; KHOR & quot ; and when I try to flash the drive i get this error : & quot ; NO MATCHED DRIVE DETECTED !	St
1.1.3	THIS UTILITY IS ONLY FOR LITE-ON COMBO LTC-48161H DRIVE DETECTED DRIVES : 1-0-0-0 D : LITE-ON COMBO LTC-48161H KTH2 & quot ; It has the drive listed as a LTC-48161H KTH2 but I ca n't find any reference to that drive on Liteons site , and my disc utlity has the drives fw as KTH2 which I ca n't find on any fw history for the LTC-48161H drive .	St
1.1.4	The drive wo n't recognize the majority of my DVD media and I just figured the fw needed upgraded but I 'm having no luck .	St
1.1.5	Any help would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	The reason I ask is that a discussion on a firmware forum mentioned such and & quot ; yup & quot ; there is no firmware update .	St
1.2.2	Also how old is the drive .	St
1.2.3	If 2 or more years I just swap the drive out after a pass of a CD/DVD lens cleaner .	St
1.2.4	While some owners will want to try other fixes I 'm usually on the clock to get it fixed .	St
