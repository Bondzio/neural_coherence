I was able to use it for a few times but after that when I click on properties it has 0 bytes capacity and the file system is RAW. I could not format it because it says &quot;write protected&quot; but I know that it is not write protected, since it is not the type with a write-protect notch/switch. I always safe-remove it whenever I use it. Please help, thank you.I am using Windows XP Service Pack 2

My flash drive of 2GB stopped writing at under 1GB and I got the usual write protected message and tried a number of things on the internet. In the end I started the PC in safe mode and right clicked the drive to format it. It started but then near the end came up with a cannot complete this action message. Having restarted the PC normally I right clicked the drive again and this time it began formatting normally. Problem solved I hope!! Mike Farnham mikefarnham
