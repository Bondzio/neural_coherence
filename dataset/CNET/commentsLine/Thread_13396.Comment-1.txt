so, while removing the hard drive on my brother's asus eee 1005hab.
i, on accident, lost the little black clips that holds it in place.
does anyone have any tips on how to fix this?
my first instinct is vinyl electrical tape, but i'm worried what will happen if it melts, or by some odd turn, an arc or something.
the connector is the one that holds they touchpad in place, so it's quite small.
any tips?
