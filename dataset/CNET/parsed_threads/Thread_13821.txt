<s> I hope this is just a simple question from an amateur. </s>
<s> Does a wireless router (thinking of the Linksys 54G) need to be wired to at least one computer? </s>
<s> Or can it ''standalone'' and be installed away from a computer? </s>
<s> In another room for example. </s>
<s> I know it needs to be hardwired for initial setup, but can it then be transferred and be 100% wireless after install? </s>
<s> Some routers come with the radio (wifi) off by default. </s>
<s> Pretty tough to setup wirelessly. </s>

<s> I am trying to set a wireless up at my church. </s>
<s> I went out and bought Linksys 54gs, PCI card. </s>
<s> I set it up as per the instructions (?). </s>
<s> The router is in the parish house and the remote is in the church office. </s>
<s> The distance between the two points is approximately 80 feet. </s>
<s> The setup didn't work. </s>
<s> I recheck the password, ddis and chanel with no results. </s>
<s> I didn't put in to effect the security. </s>
<s> I thought it is maybe out of transmitter limits, so I bought a range extender-same results. </s>
<s> My question is: Is there a way to check the transmetter opower eminating from the router? </s>
<s> If I got the gist of the range extenter, it receives from the route. </s>
<s> With the results I got, I hard wired it and it is working fine. </s>
<s> I, still want to go wireless. </s>
<s> If not, feel free to start your new discussion. </s>
