On my main computer, I have msn dsl and Norton AV and AVG antispyware and Spy Bot And Ad Aware. On the other computer I have AVG free antivirus and spy bot and adaware. Now the installation disc runs fine untill you get to the part of putting your password in. Then it will not take your password or go any further. Now strange as it seems at this point. The other computer in the spare room is connected to the internet. But my main computer where my dsl and the router are connected will not connect to the internet. I have installed and uninstalled the linksys many times and the installation stops at password. So don't know why other computer is connected to net and main one isn't. Defective disc??? But why won't my computer connect to net? Thanks for any answer. Barb

So had the Geek Squad from Best Buy set it up with all the security and things. Seems when the QWest DSL set up my dsl account they put a static ISP address instead of automatic and that was causing a problem. It was worth the $89 I paid the Geek Squad to set it up for me. Working great now. Barb
