Since you can't attempt the free or free to try apps at the top of this forum ( http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-354911.html?tag=contentBody;threadListing ) then I suggest you have the work done at http://www.drivesavers.com Some folk think there is only one answer to data recovery.
And there is.
It's not one that folk take too well so I won't write it so you won't be upset.
