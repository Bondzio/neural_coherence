<s> ok, so i am trying to figure out whether to set my internet connection through my linksys router as &quot;keep alive&quot; or &quot;connect on demand&quot;. </s>
<s> I had it on connect on demand but during an online game it kept thinking the connection was idle, so it would disconnect messing up the game. </s>
<s> So I set it up on keep alive, well it would keep the connection, but everytime it wasnt used for a few hours it would disconnect and I have to go into router settings and reconnect manually. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> What model router? </s>
<s> Try downloading the latest firmware. </s>
<s> It sounds like your router software sucks. </s>
<s> Dial on Demand is pretty self explanatory. </s>
<s> Any packet destined for the internet constitutes &quot;demand&quot;. </s>
<s> There should also be some &quot;Idle Timer&quot; settings that are used to disconnect the router after some time of no traffic. </s>
<s> Setting these to 0 usually means never hang-up. </s>
<s> Some ISPs automatically disconnect you after many hours to prevent you from setting up a Mail or FTP server. </s>
<s> You might try rebooting the router before a really long gaming session to get a fresh login and restart the ISPs timer, if you think it is your ISP screwing with you. </s>
<s> Check you IP address on the router once a day and see if it is changing. </s>
<s> SKrall </s>
<s> Thats the model number. </s>
<s> It is currently running firmware version 1.00.6. </s>
<s> When going to the linksys site they have 5-6 different &quot;versions&quot; of my router. </s>
<s> How do I know which version I have? </s>
<s> I tried putting a 0 in under the idle time, but must be greater than 1. </s>
<s> I am thinking the losing of the connection must be someting to with the internet because the wireless signal usually remains at a constant 54 Mbps without dropping. </s>
<s> Look on the bottom of your router to get the version # </s>
<s> Ok, so i got the version number and downloaded the latest firmware. </s>
<s> So we shall see what happens. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help, guys. </s>
<s> so I downloaded the latest firmware and put the setting on keep alive. </s>
<s> It is still dropping the connection, sometimes. </s>
<s> I even set my laptop up using an ethernet cable, to see if it was wireless signal interference. </s>
<s> So that can't be the case. </s>
