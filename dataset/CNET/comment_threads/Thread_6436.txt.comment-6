I just bought an HD TV and I found this on line at the APC web site.
It has a mountable wall bracket, 12 outlets, 3400 Joules surge rating, noise filtering, RJ-11 Modem/Fax protection (two wire single line),RJ45 10/100 Base-T Ethernet protection,Cable modem / Video protection,Co-axial Video / Cable protection, etc.
It's on sale at $99 at APC.
I mounted the unit to the back of the cabinet but it an be mounted to the wall too.
The mounting bracket allows you to mount the unit in a number of configurations.
