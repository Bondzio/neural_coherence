use a flash drive that way the lost of only that data is at risk.
the resolutions robert provided is about it, if your problem persists, you're stuck.
also, backup should include any data burned to cd/dvd as well for yet another source of backup.
up to you on a recovery process, the value you place on it.
as for the probable cause, if you read these forums anything is possible.
someone could have handled the ext.
hd not thinking it was on.
