1.1.1	Windows xp pro N/A Hello!	St
1.1.2	Fan sticks.	St
1.1.3	need to prod it to get it turning.	St
1.1.4	(not all the time though) After removing fan wire cover, what is the best way to clean it.	St
1.1.5	Should I use a cue tip with alcohol, then lube?	St
1.1.6	Not sure what to do.	Res
1.1.7	Any advice on this would be appreciated!	Polite
1.1.8	Thanks~Furdgeo	St
1.2.1	Blow off the dust with a can of compressed air.	St
1.2.2	While you're at it, blow out all heatsinks, fans, and filters inside the case.	St
1.2.3	Lube might work, but replacing the fan would be my preference.	St
1.2.4	Not very expensive if purchased online.	St
1.2.5	Note that some fans aren't supposed to spin all the time.	St
1.2.6	They only spin if a certain temperature is reached.	St
1.3.1	I agree.	St
1.3.2	The best option would be to replace the fan.	St
1.3.3	They can be as cheap as $1 or $2.	St
1.3.4	Generally, the power supply will create enough heat idoling that the fan will always be on.	St
1.3.5	Also, be careful when working on a power supply as a deadly dose of juice can still be running through the the box long after the ac cable in unplugged.	St
1.3.6	Good Luck Evan	St

1.6.1	You could attempt to clean out any dirt..	St
1.6.2	But first check the wired connector..unplug it and then replug it and try again.. Don't go spraying compressed air all over the PC..take things on one at a time..don't confuse the issue.. ..	St
1.6.3	If the fan is stalling on start up it is most likely a ready to die item..I would first check out the price of a replacement..and think from there.. .. A simple approach might be to unplug everything in the whole house or room..let the complete electrical system just sit for about 1-HOUR..and then check your AC-outlet PLUG for AC-voltage..it should be like 115-121 VOLTS AC..don't worry about AMPERAGE..and if you have never used a Multi-Tester before/don't mess with AC-voltages(YOU COULD BE KILLED)..even being careful I have been shocked(a little)is still ALOT.. .. How-ever..unplug all Appliances and Devices in the house..wait one hour..and replug your SURGE Protection..Plug in your PC.. And do a Start-Up..	St
1.6.4	Does..this eliminate the Fan Problem..	St
1.6.5	If so..you need to CHART the PLUGS from the wall.. Be sure you NOT over-loading some AC-circuit..thats being used by other Large demand Appliances..	St
1.6.6	I number my AC-outlets..1,2,3,4,5....from the Switch Box..and attempt to Isolate MY PC and Air Conditioner first..then my Stereo System..I use energy saving light bulbs..and even at times just unplug stuff.. especially when I leave my apartement/I unplug stuff all over the place.. ..	St
1.6.7	Learn to use a Multi-Tester....but be careful..learn on Batteries first..like for your re-Chargeables..for the CD-Player and the Camera..later you learn to analyze power supplies..or even your AC Wall Outlets&lt;&lt;---which can KILL YOU....But I find all of this necessary.	St
1.7.1	Your hired!	St

1.9.1	If I read this right your talking about the fan built in the power supply, If so I would replace the entire thing.	St
1.9.2	They seem cheap to me.	St
