Given today's support costs it's too cheap to fix that fix.
Also there is little that fits on a diskette that would help get in.
Now I'm writing about the systems I run into and not those old DOS based Windows.
The DOS networking would incur TOO HIGH A SUPPORT COST and few would find the needed DOS driver for the network card do that's a dead end.
Maybe if you had unlimited time and no budget but why would anyone go there?
