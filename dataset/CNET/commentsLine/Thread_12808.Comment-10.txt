i use 2 thinkpads and have owned 3 earlier ibm thinkpads.
earlier poster is correct, they're the easiest systems to upgrade; 'system update' grabs bios, driver, and even windows updates all at one time.
the updates are tuned to the specific machine, no non-applicable updates.
only notebook that you can place on the ground and stand upon.
see their well-written blog at  they remind me of michelin tires; pricey, but once you make the switch you never buy anything else.
