you either have a defective, disabled, or a device without drivers installed.
you can check the sound device status under device manager (right click on my computer, go to properties and then hardware/device manager.
you should see a listing for sound and gaming devices.
a yellow exclamation point usually means no driver, a red x means disabled, and no listing means no sound device.
if your rca jack is along the motherboard card edge, you have an on board device.
it may be that it's not enabled in the bios.
do a good search for a sound device on your system as a first step.
