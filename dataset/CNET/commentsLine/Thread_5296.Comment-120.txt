i have a major problem with that word &quot;absolute&quot;.
you can only upgrade to a better graphics card if the motherboard has an upgrade slot.
that is not necessarily the case.
it has been a while since i upgraded my computers, but the last time i looked there were motherboards out there that did not have a graphics slot.
i also have not bought a full production case since my first 25mhz 486 gateway.
i have gone the upgrade route ever since that first computer and looked for the best buy available for the money for only the components i required (what was broken or about to die).
