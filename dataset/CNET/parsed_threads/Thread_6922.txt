<s> Hi; Got a 3-4 yr. old Acer Aspire 4738Z that does the following sporatically: * refreshes web pages * changes default browser * reinstalls Windows updates that it's already installed * external keyboard (internal no longer works) suddenly won't type certain keys * opens MS Outlook all_the_time (close it, reopens) Once (wrote about this earlier) it shut the whole computer down and wouldn't even let me into BIOS, let alone boot Windows. </s>
<s> Where do I begin trouble-shooting this? </s>
<s> TIA, John </s>
<s> Boot off any Live OS CD (too many to choose from today) and see if the keyboard works. </s>
<s> If not, start with fixing that as stuck keys can do what you noted. </s>

<s> Occasionally it's the keyboard. </s>
<s> But it works fine in another computer, and goes back to working fine in this one as well when I reboot. </s>
<s> Like I said originally in the first post where I enumerated all sorts of strange problems, that's just one of many. </s>
<s> No stuck keys. </s>

<s> A clean install will clear that up. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It sounds as if you have a corrupted system possibly due to virus/malware infestation(s). </s>
<s> You said nothing about A/V security software, scans etc. </s>
<s> Mr. Proffitt suggested a reload (Windows)..IMOP likely the easiest way out. </s>
<s> Thanks, all! </s>
