since, you don't want any data from the old &quot;c&quot; partition, then proceed to use the same info i posted earlier for the current &quot;c&quot; drive.
now, you want to do w/o clearing or making a mess, but you already did that when you accepted the old &quot;d&quot; partition as &quot;c&quot; making this process diffcult.
you have to start all over again and remove *anything* as in prior formats, fat setup, data, etc., in order to start fresh.
once all that is done, install os again and retrieve any data you saved back to re-installed pgm.
folders/directories or simply from scratch again.
no matter what you do outside of what i already suggested is going to be a hassle or require intense effort and still not be 100% sure it will work.
if you acquire any s/w to do this, then you rely totally on it doing the job again you build on a framework of the old, even if corrected.
so, if that s/w if free and available get it, otherwise you need some partition s/w to do this.
look at pm, partition magic or similar.
more than likely if it works will be a one-time use unless repeated faults.
hopefully one of the above should work.
however, in the time involved you can do this as i suggested and clean the mess and re-install.
imho, partition manager and gparted i like.
