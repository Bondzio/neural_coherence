1.1.1	I just removed a laptop hard drive ( HITACHI_DK23DA-30 ) , and put it into an usb external enclosure .	St
1.1.2	When I plug it into a usb port of my Dell XPS M1210 machine ( OS : Vista Home Premium ) , I was told the driver can not be found .	St
1.1.3	But when trying with XP and Linux , the driver can be installed automaticaly without a problem .	St
1.1.4	Could anyone here give me some help on this issue , like where I can find the driver .	St
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	The Vista is not installed by Dell .	St
1.2.2	Ask Dell for the & quot ; other & quot ; drivers for that laptop .	St
1.2.3	Or if you do n't want to call it in , check dell.com for what Vista drivers they offer .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
