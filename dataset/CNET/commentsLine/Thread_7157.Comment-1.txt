i recently installed a cd-rw drive in my computer.
it was purchased from an electronics store as rebuilt.
it's frankensteined.
before the cd-rw was installed, the cd-rom drive worked fine.
now, after the install, it doesn't recognize and cd, including music cds, games, or blank discs.
i have uninstalled and reinstalled the drive in device management, i have physically re-installed both drives, swapping the cables (and the master/slave jumpers), i have checked the drive properties and they say the device is working properly.
i have also checked to see if there is a hardware conflict.
none.
i booted in safe mode and the drive still won't read discs.
i have also cleaned the drive with a cd drive cleaning disc.
i'm thinking that my 40-pin cable connecting the cd-rom drive may be faulty at the connection.
anybody have suggestions or ideas?
not wanting to replace the drive as i know it's good; it works in my other computer.
