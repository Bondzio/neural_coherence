<s> What was your original problem ? </s>
<s> Why did you have to reformat your hard drive. </s>
<s> Can you get it as far the F2 post ? </s>
<s> I had to go to work and was alredy late. </s>
<s> It's a long beep about 1 sec. </s>
<s> and 2 secs between beeps. </s>
<s> only seems to happen when a hard drive is pluged in. </s>
<s> once I unpluge the HD I can load the BIOS. </s>
<s> dose this to all hard drives I try. </s>
<s> Found this website: http://www.amptron.com/html/bios.beepcodes.html You didn't indicate what your BIOS version is, but this should help narrow it down somewhat. </s>
<s> It's the cheap part. </s>
<s> Also your lack of detail has me ask if the hard disk spins up or did you forget to connect power? </s>
<s> If it spins up, it's likely the power supply has an issue or the motherboard. </s>
