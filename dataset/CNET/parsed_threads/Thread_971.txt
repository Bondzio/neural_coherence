<s> I live in a fraternity and we set up a network that looks something like this: Cable modem goes to a router (the router's wireless is disabled). </s>
<s> This router then sends and ethernet cord to each floor and connects to a wireless router and sends a signal. </s>
<s> Now the problem is that only the router on the third floor seems to be connected to the internet, the other two won't. </s>
<s> Even when I plug my computer into one the problem routers I can't connect to the internet. </s>
<s> On the problem routers the internet light is solid and not showing activity. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea of what could be wrong. </s>
<s> You didn't tell if it ever worked or if you tried it like I shared in post 17 of our forum sticky. </s>
<s> One the other floors, you need wireless &quot;access points&quot;. </s>
<s> Perhaps your other routers have the ability to act as such but it's a waste of extra time and may always be flaky. </s>
<s> Trade them in for APs and you'll be better off. </s>
