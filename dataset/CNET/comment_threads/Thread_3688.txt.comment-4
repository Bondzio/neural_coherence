would work with your laptop (if your laptop has a wireless adapter) instead of a physical cable (ethernet) connection.
The troublesome statement is: &quot;I had ethernet for quite a while and it suddenly stopped working.
My ISP (Mediacom) and I troubleshot.
We ended up trying different ethernet cards, different cables, different modems and different PCI slots to no avail.
When we switched to the USB it connected right away.&quot; This indicates a problem within either the computers networking hardware/software or the modem.
The prevalent cause of lost connections is some type of viral/spyware/malware infection which if not cleaned off will eventually come back to haunt you.
