<s> Last week I bought a new PC (compaq CQ5700F-OS Windows 7). </s>
<s> I am using it with my old monitor (eMachines E17T4W) Problem-there is about a 2 inch strip of black from top to bottom on the right hand side. </s>
<s> I ran through the monitor menu, nothing fixed the problem though &quot;Auto&quot; made the black space smaller by a couple of inches. </s>
<s> I did a chat with a compaq tech who could not identify and fix the problem. </s>
<s> eMachines web site offered no help either. </s>
<s> So I turn to you techies hoping someone might have an idea what is going on and have a possible solution. </s>
<s> Note-monitor worked perfectly with old PC (eMachines), it never had this problem. </s>
<s> Old PC has been taken to recyclers so there is no way to plug it back in and see if it would still work correctly with that PC. </s>
<s> I see that a lot when the monitor driver is not installed, I'm unsure why but many need this setup at the shop. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I did consider it might be a driver issue but did not feel comfortable trolling the web looking for a needle in a haystack-correct driver. </s>
<s> I did check out the Windows 7 compatibility center. </s>
<s> They listed 2039 monitors/TV's that are compatible with windows 7. </s>
<s> They listed only 3 eMachines monitors. </s>
<s> My eMachines monitor wasn't listed. </s>
<s> I don't have the money to take it to a tech and have them fix the problem. </s>
<s> So I think I will live with the black bar on my screen since it is not really a distraction. </s>
<s> Just thought I'd try and fix it if I could. </s>
<s> We have the two name brands and the model numbers but the driver would be the monitor driver. </s>
<s> This is not so much a driver but a file called monitor.inf that let's Windows know what settings to show for that monitor. </s>
<s> You can google MONITOR.INF if you want to learn what these files do. </s>
<s> As I noted, I find many don't want to install these so a trip to a good shop is often the cure. </s>
<s> Then again, you just bought the machine from who? </s>
<s> Maybe they'll fix this for you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Found this driver updater on CNET site. </s>
<s> It was just added 6/8/11. </s>
<s> I'd like to think this would be a safe download that wouldn't cause my PC to get the wrong drivers and thus create problems only a PC tech could fix. </s>
<s> Do you have any opinions about this software? </s>
<s> http://download.cnet.com/SlimDrivers-Free/3000-18513_4-75279940.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody;1d Also to answer your inquiry about returning item to place purchased to have drivers updated, that is not an option. </s>
<s> I ordered the PC online from Target and had it shipped to me. </s>
<s> I'm never had to use such. </s>
<s> I'd head to e4me.com or whatever the emachines site is to find the monitor driver. </s>
<s> I've yet to see driver packs include monitor.inf files. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The first place I checked for monitor drivers was at eMachines website. </s>
<s> For my monitor there are no driver updates available. </s>
<s> I think since the monitor is four years old they don't bother to offer driver updates. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info about driver packs not including monitor.inf files, I did not know that. </s>
<s> http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:GnknDGno75AJ:www.talkcomputer.com/homebuilt/Wide-Screen-help-from-Windows-guru-needed-16245-.htm+Westinghouse+17&quot;+monitor.inf+download&amp;cd=9&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=mozilla&amp;source=www.google.com That notes the hide feature and you can try other settings there. </s>
<s> However it's possible that since the monitor is PnP (more praying?) </s>
<s> that you'll have fun trying video card drivers too. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Yes, it was sold with the Westinghouse label and maybe other names. </s>
<s> So I went to the link you provided and read about how to find what graphic resolutions the graphic adapter supports. </s>
<s> But because I have windows 7 (I think directions were for vista) it took me a little bit of time to find access to the list (under control panel, change display settings, advanced settings). </s>
<s> Then I went to my monitor menu, and under advanced went to information.The monitor info reads &quot;1280 X 720 60 Hz&quot;. </s>
<s> Then I went back to supported graphics resolutions and switched it from where it was set, &quot;1280 X 720 True Color (32 bit) 59 Hz&quot; to the same but at 60Hz. </s>
<s> instead of 59Hz. </s>
<s> Clicked apply and now I have full use of the screen. </s>
<s> One strange note. </s>
<s> When I first changed the setting from 59Hz to 60Hz I encountered a wavy screen problem. </s>
<s> So I went back into the supported resolutions list and tried a few of the other 1280 X 720 choices. </s>
<s> Those did not solve the problem. </s>
<s> So I decided to go back to the above 60Hz setting. </s>
<s> And for whatever reason the wavy screen problem was gone. </s>
<s> Thank you for all your help </s>
<s> 59Hz was indeed a little strange as almost all LCD panels are 60Hz things. </s>
<s> Sorry but it's quite odd to find such a number today in the video settings. </s>
<s> Makes you wonder how that happened. </s>
<s> My theory is that it had some CRT display as default. </s>
<s> Good you sorted it out. </s>
