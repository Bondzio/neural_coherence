one day my wireless was working and then it quit.
then the next day i lost the entire network.
i couldn't even open the connect to menu.
i have a gateway t-1628 and on the internet connections where it has the icons for the broadband and dial up networks the wireless is no where to be found.
i thought if i tried reinstalling windows vista home edition everything would go back to normal but it didn't.
i don't know what to do.
i read another guys message saying he had a similar problem where he lost his wireless network and someone said to call the laptops company and tell them about it.
i'm tempted to do that but i just wanna know if there's a way past this before trying to call somebody.
