When I hit the button to turn it back on nothing happened. I've checked the surge protector, outlet, power cable to the back of the tower, and the connection to the surge protector. There is a green light on the back of the tower located by where the power cord plugs in and when I push the power button on the front of the computer it lights up but the computer doesn't seem to start booting up. Also when I shut it down last night it didn't make any odd noises and I didn't smell anything like an ozone smell or a burning smell. Any ideas and or help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all.

You can purchase a tester or take it to a shop, it is an easy test to do with the right test equipment. If it is a PSU failure it is usually a fairly easy fix, just replace PSU. Unless it is a very old system it is typically worth doing.
