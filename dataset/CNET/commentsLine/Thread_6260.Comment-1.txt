my computer can't run games very well, like for example: fable 3, skyrim, star wars tfu2, call of duty etc.
i really want to play games like that.
here is my pc  i have a 250watt power supply, do i have to get a new power supply to get a new graphics card since mine is kind of low?
somebody recommended this video card because it doesn't require a very big power supply.
will this card run those games good?
if not, what should i get?
under 60$
