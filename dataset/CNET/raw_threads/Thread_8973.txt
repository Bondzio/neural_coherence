My son , a university student , is printing a lot of lecture material. I had an old Epson 400 printer that worked quite well until he started using cheap cartridges and refills which totally clogged the heads. I have a HP7900 photo printer I use for printing photos , I need a printer to print B&W text inexpensively, I assume that laser would be a better choice than inkjet . The printer would be run on a new PC with Vista. Thank you Cesia
