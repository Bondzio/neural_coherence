<s> hi everyone, good day. </s>
<s> I 2 have 3com 5500g switch and I installed new transceiver which is 1000BASE-LX SFP 3CSFP92. </s>
<s> How many LC connector do I need to buy? </s>
<s> is it recommended to have 2 for transmitter and receiver or it is being fused? </s>
<s> please guide me. </s>
<s> thank you. </s>
<s> Not sure what you are asking. </s>
<s> You can only plug a single cable into each SFP . </s>
<s> It has 1 strand for transmit and 1 strand for receive. </s>
<s> You want to cross transmit to receive, most cables you can very carefully swap the pair at the end. </s>
<s> What you need is a dual strand LC-LC cable the proper length. </s>
<s> I assume even though you have LX SFP you are going a short distance so you can use multimode cable. </s>
<s> If your question is do you buy 4 SFP and run 2 connections between the switches for redundancy then you get even more questions since you must have configurations to allow for it. </s>
<s> If you are running a fiber within a building it is very unlikely it will ever fail. </s>
<s> The failure for fiber is that someone physically breaks it. </s>
<s> When you look at fiber redundancy you must run the fibers in different paths since things that break 1 fiber tend to break all at the same time. </s>
<s> Ok rereading I see what you are asking. </s>
<s> You can buy 2 single strand cables but it is a pain. </s>
<s> Buy what you call a fused cable which is called dual strand in most sites. </s>
<s> The ends can be unsnapped and swapped very easy if the orientation is not correct... generally most companies they are crossed on short cables just like you need. </s>
