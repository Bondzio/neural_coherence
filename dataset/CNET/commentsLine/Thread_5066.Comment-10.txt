thanks.
i'm not looking for speed.
its really fast as it is right now.
more speed would be nice, if that happens.
i'm really interested in having more memory so i can have many applications and windows opened at the same time without a problem of few seconds lag or freezes when having too many opened/running at the same time.
your information helps too.
i'm in process of looking for a manual online and will try to see if i can get someone thru live support from compaq.
