<s> Is it the CPU or Video card that is the main culprit in lowering game performance? </s>
<s> In other words, I have an AMD 2700+ (~2.01 GHz) and a 9600XT. </s>
<s> If I were to uprade one, which one should it be to boost gaming performance? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> thus you got the NT [no text], went back and added text but failed to remove the NT. </s>
<s> So then it looks as if your message has a subject line only. </s>
<s> The subject line is so vague that many won't bother. </s>
<s> Possibly make the post again without the NT, and then send a mod alert from this post of yours and ask them to remove it. </s>
<s> They can then also remove my reply. </s>
<s> Most times the Mods will comply. </s>
<s> Hi. </s>
<s> What mobo are you on? </s>
<s> Some of them (like my Abit NF7S2) will allow you to overclock Athlons. </s>
<s> My 2700+ is running at the same speed as a 3200+ by upping the bus from 333 to 400 and has been for 6 months. </s>
<s> If you want to upgrade the processor to a worthwhile level, it will mean going to a new motherboard as well. </s>
<s> For video, try an agp nvidia 6600GT. </s>
<s> It REALLY makes a difference over a 9600XT, honest. </s>
<s> Mine plays Battlefield 2 and CS source at 1280x1024 no problems. </s>
