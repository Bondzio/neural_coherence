<s> Hello.I am new to this so please bare with me.I just bought a new desktop that has the NVIDIA GeForce 6150 SE Integrated graphics card.It has a open slot for a PCI-E card.Can the integrated card be upgraded? </s>
<s> Or will this card work for gaming? </s>
<s> You can buy a PCI-Express card and set it as the primary card in the BIOS, so that the PC will prefer the PCI-e card as its video output. </s>
<s> A 6150 will &quot;work&quot; for gaming, but is not the best choice given the plethora of cheap cards on the market that will easily outperform low-end cards from the past. </s>

<s> power from the PSU. </s>
<s> So make sure you check the video card power requirements before making the final purchase. </s>
<s> Otherwise you might end up forking up another $50 to $100 for a new Power Supply too. </s>
