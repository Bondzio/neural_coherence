1.4.1	you 'll be able to play most games released before 2007 ( oblivion , prey , fear , call of duty 2 , etc ) on medium detail at 1024x768 or lower .	St
1.4.2	it will struggle with this year 's titles ( world in conflict , company of heroes , bioshock , etc ) though and you 'll need to replace it for crysis and hellgate .	St
1.4.3	as a rule of thumb , if you want to play current games at high detail levels and/or high resolution , budget at least $ 150 for a video card .	St
