bob, thanks again for your help.
i thought i might have to buy a new drive.
any ideas where i could buy a new drive that i could install myself.
sony is asking for $350.
btw, i exchanged my external (drx-710ul)dvd burner (another posting you had helped me with) for another one and it works like a charm.
