I have a seagate goflex network drive (connected to router w/ ethernet cable) that I store all my pictures, movies, and files on.
It is connected to every computer in the house and is constantly being changed.
I was just thinking the other day that if this drive goes down, we're pretty much screwed, so I got a backup drive, a seagate goflex desk (works through usb, which is also connected to router).
After the initial copy paste of files from one to the other, how can I set these two up so that if you copy files to one, it will also automatically be copied to the other??
Thanks in advance!
-I work on both mac and pc
