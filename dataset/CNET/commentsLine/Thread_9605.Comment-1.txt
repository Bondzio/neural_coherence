my pc consistently reboots once the windows xp load screen completes.
in other words, when the logon screen should display, instead the machine restarts.
this problem originated after my house lost power; i'm not sure if that has anything to do with it.
i ran a memory checker based on a friend's advice and everything seems fine there.
i can't boot into safe mode or anything else.
i fear a hard drive problem but hoping its something else.
any suggested tests/remedies?
