<s> I am trying to borrow my Uncle's shared broadband internet connection by unplugging the ethernet cable from his laptop and plugging it into my laptop. </s>
<s> At first, my computer tried to acquire the network address on the LAN connection but it ended with limited or no connectivity. </s>
<s> I eventually fixed that problem by changing the IP address on my laptop to my Uncle's IP address and making the last digit different. </s>
<s> While it now says LAN connection is connected, I still cannot browse the internet. </s>
<s> I checked the status on my internet connection and it looks like it receiving packets but is not sending packets. </s>
<s> Any solutions would be great beccuase this is frustrating. </s>
<s> I know I can use my Uncle's internet connection withmy computer but I just don't know how. </s>
<s> but XP is ipconfig/release and then renew from a command prompt. </s>
<s> Or reboot the router and PC. </s>
<s> when I try to renew my IP, it just remians idle until my connection attempt is timed out. </s>
<s> Is my only other option network wizard setup because I'm not sure how to configure it correctly. </s>
<s> It seems my only problem is on the receiving end and not the sending end. </s>
<s> My OS is Windows XP Pro btw. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions would be great... </s>
<s> If this is a direct connection to a broadband modem, then you may require user names and password for DSL, or a cycling of the modems power in the case of cable. </s>
<s> I can't get my cousins laptop to renew its Ip address I have tried reseting the router the cable modem uninstalling all of the networking adapters, tried Ipconfig -renew & - release the thing that kills me most is the it tells me the signal strength is Excellent Anymore suggestions? </s>
