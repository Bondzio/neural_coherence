Hi I have an office with 40 to 50 employees working with wireless connections.
I have a D-Link DI-624 802.11g AirPlus Xtreme G 108 Mbps Wireless Router.
Recently, we've been having problems with random connection loses.
One thing that I have experimented, is that if I have a PC that generates a lot of web requests it will make every PC in the office lose their connection.
Is there a business oriented wireless router that can be configured as easy as the D-Link DI-624.
Please no Cisco solutions.
