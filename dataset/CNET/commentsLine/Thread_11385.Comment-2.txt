does the school use a ms windows network?
if so, adding a file server to the environment should be as easy as adding the server, creating the file structure, organizing the &quot;access permissions by user account&quot; setup.
windows 2003 is pretty easy to setup, but i do recommend that you consult with an mcse, to achieve the proper design.
in regards to the access/permissions, again, windows 2003 will provide the tools to setup such an environment (its all about the ntfs configuration).
in regards to having all the files &quot;upload or something like that...&quot; use file shares and roaming profiles.
