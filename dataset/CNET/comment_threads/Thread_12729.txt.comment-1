Have an old HP Pavillion that hasn't been used for quite some time.
Decided to clean it up before getting rid of it.
Started it up, and it botted fine.
Couldn't find a mouse to use, so when I shut it down did it through task manager.
I tightened up the monitor connection after finding an old USB mouse in garage and plugged it in, turned computer back on and got nothing.
Monitor black, no power to keyboard or mouse, no beep on start up.
Any ideas?
