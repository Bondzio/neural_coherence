I already have 2 hard drives, a dvd burner, and a cd burner installed, thus using up all the ide channels on the board. I don't want to buy a PCI slot ide controller in order to add more drives unless I have to. So I am wondering if I can make use of the SATA controllers on the board at the same time as the ide primary and secondary channels.

I would think the PSU could handle another drive but I don't know anything about the power requirements of a SATA drive verses an ide drive.
