<s> The Dynex stuff is just Best Buy's label and gear. </s>
<s> Nothing to get excited about. </s>
<s> I like 2 or more cores in today's machines. </s>
<s> But you didn't tell what this machine would be used for. </s>
<s> Let's see if a gamer would like it? </s>
<s> http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?product=3820307&lc=en&cc=tr&dlc=tr&lang=tr&cc=tr The video is &quot;Integrated on motherboard (see motherboard and chipset)&quot; and is the fair performer for Visa Aero GeForce 6150SE. </s>
<s> - This is not a gaming machine. </s>
<s> It's a nice machine for most things, just not ready to play today's high end games. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yea, it will be used for gaming mostly. </s>
<s> I am trying to save money on it, and then upgrade it. </s>
<s> Do you have any thoughts on a good gaming PC that is reasonable? </s>
<s> As you are getting Vista 64, I'll write that you have to check if your games, printers and such are supported by that. </s>
<s> http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01357135&lc=en&dlc=tr&cc=tr&lang=tr&product=3820307 is the motherboard. </s>
<s> Yes it has a PCIe x16 slot. </s>
<s> Let's find the power supply rating. </s>
<s> It's a 300 Watt PSU so if you go too far out you'll have to replace that. </s>
<s> This leads me to suggest the lower power video cards from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2064.html &quot;The Radeon HD 4670 slaps previous generation high-end performance squarely in the jaw of mid-range pricing. </s>
<s> With 320 shader processors, this card means business, and will provide awesome 1600x1200 gaming. </s>
<s> Compared to the 9600 GSO, its main advantage is a low power requirement. </s>
<s> It doesnt need an external power cable, which for some upgraders is a really important feature.&quot; Unless you want to change the PSU, I'd shop this card. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> just my humble opinion... if you want to game, and you want to upgrade, save the time and the money and go buy what you want now. </s>
<s> i just built a 9850BE quad on asus for under $1000 (already had dual monitors), overclocked a little and it screams. </s>
<s> not saying your wrong, just something to consider. </s>
<s> shop parts at tom's or newegg... always good deals. </s>
