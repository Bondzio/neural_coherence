or an older athlon but i'm gonna say pentium 4, as their far more common i'd suggest just building now as it's a willamette p4 or an athlonxp on the palomino or t-bred a core either way, it's going to be slower than a dog in most modern games i feel the lack of power in my athlonxp 3200+ whenever i run any modern game (hl2 and 3dmark05 feel it most, doom iii is fine) or stress an fps, it can handle it, but it'll hiccup and my chip is equivalent to a 2.8e you have a 1.7 i'm not trying to bash it, i'm just trying to put things into perspective, i'd say instead of sinking any money into that box just build a new one
