1.1.1	I'm a gamer looking to build a NICE system.	St
1.1.2	whats the deal with dual Opteron 280's.	St
1.1.3	I know they require a server class motherboard, which scares me as far as compatability.	St
1.1.4	Should i stick with the fx 60 (or the upcoming fx62) or is the extra cost involved in the opterons worth it.	St
1.1.5	Second question, dual nvidia geforce 7800gtx's at 512mbs a piece vs. dual nvidia quadro fx 4500's at 512 mbs a piece.	St
1.1.6	are the quadros worth the money for gaming performance.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Look over http://www.tomshardware.com and see the monsters they build.	St
1.3.2	Your list looks like something from last year.	St
1.3.3	Today you can use dual core CPUs and dual SLI video cards (plus that kilowatt power supply) to hit the top.	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	both quadros and geforces can be run sli, which is what i'm planning.	St
1.4.2	I'm asking which to use, the twin sli quadros or twin sli geforces.	St
1.4.3	Secondly, both processors I listed are dual core.	St
1.4.4	While the fx60 can only be run single chip, the opterons can be run as two dual core processors on a sinlge motherboard.	St
1.4.5	The system im talking about is far past last years equipt, it is the highest quality currently available on the market...	St
1.5.1	Frankly I plan on playing high end games at the best quality available, I would also like to do basic video editing and video encoding.	St
1.6.1	Your concept machine will cost 2X what you can get today with top notch performance.	St
1.6.2	Since you paid 1/2 the price you can sock the money away to replace it with something 4 to more times better then.	St
1.6.3	I've seen people attempt your path and their attitude soars and flames in about a year as their leading edge machine is eclipsed.	St
1.6.4	Just sharing I've seen this too many times and hope to dissaude you.	Polite

1.9.1	If an XPS could be shipped &quot;bare naked&quot; to you - that is without any factory installed &quot;free-trial&quot; software, then you'd have no one to blame but yourself for the heartache and frustration that you will likely encounter.	St
1.9.2	You can expect to spend hours on the phone with the techies trying to troubleshoot issues that, in my opinion, should have been resolved at the factory before the unit was ever shipped.	St
1.9.3	For this kind of money I expected &quot;plug and play&quot; but was instead frustrated and very disappointed in my $3,000 XPS600.	St
