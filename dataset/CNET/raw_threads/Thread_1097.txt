The drive shoudl be either IDE or SATA. More likely SATA if it is newer and IDE if it is older. Once you have the drive out of the case, you will be able to slide the contoller off the HDD and see the type of connection the HDD uses. At this point all you need to do is plug the drive into a computer using the IDE or SATA cable and then boot up and see if the drive is recognized. Make sure when you do this you do not disconnect the drive currently in the computer because you will need to boot from it. The drive in question should show up in my computer as a secondary drive if it still works. If you do this and do not see the drive, the drive is bad.
