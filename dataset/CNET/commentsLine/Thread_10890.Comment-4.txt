are best found in the reviews.
and expect wide numbers such as 2 to 14 hours.
my office has a few tablets and on the transformer with the dock it gets over 10 hours of use.
but that's with items turned off when not in use.
i could easily get half that with everything on and the brightness turned up.
finds prior discussions and models so i defer to those answers.
