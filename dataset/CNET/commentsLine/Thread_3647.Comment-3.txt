the clamping mechanism is two parts... the black lever, which is fine, but then the main heatsink assembly is clipped down - that's what seems to require a lot of force to unclip... feels like i'm having to attempt to push it through the motherboard in order to release the clips got a busy weekend ahead of me so will have to give this another go next week.
re: thermal stuff... does that come off easily enough, and any recommendations on what brand to use when i put it all back together?
