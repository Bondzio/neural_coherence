I use a four button scrolling mouse that is wired, not wireless. I don't want to loose it or hassle with recharging it so I go wired. I'll also link to this Cnet article that discusses Laser mice touted as being more accurate then the optical mouse I'm using. A feature I'd also like to have. http://reviews.cnet.com/4321-3148_7-6589998.html?tag=nl.e501 More then likely I'll be hanging on to my mouse for awhile but I like to remain informed.
