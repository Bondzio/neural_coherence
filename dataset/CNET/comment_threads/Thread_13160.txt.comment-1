I currently own a low-end monochrome laser printer (the Samsung ML-2510, which replaced a Brother laser printer that was a hand-me-down from work) and an Epson Perfection 3490 flatbed scanner (used for approx.
90% of my product images in my eBay auctions).
The scanner sits on my computer desk, while the printer is on a repurposed rolling wooden TV cart (quite roomy)next to the computer desk.
When the time comes to replace either the printer or the scanner, should I replace both at once with a (prob.
inkjet) multifunction machine (no more expensive than the combined cost of 2 single-function machines ($200?
), but pref.
much less)?
Or (assuming one can still get standalone flatbed scanners priced for home-office use by then) should I stick with my current setup of a separate printer and scanner (bulkier, but roomy scanning surface, and (theoretically) cheaper per/copy cost for laser toner)?
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
