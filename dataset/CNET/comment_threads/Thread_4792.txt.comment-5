Many thanks Proffitt.
But note that i was just using Adobe as an illustration.
I have some softwares that cost several thousands of dollars and that need to be prevented from copying but can be installed.
I would'nt mind buying the tool if available.
Pls, Proffitt, what do you suggest i can do?
Thanks for your reply
