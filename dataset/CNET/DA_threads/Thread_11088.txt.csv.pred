1.1.1	My GTX480 has recently passed on ( Rip ) .	St
1.1.2	However , I need to get my PC up and running pretty soon .	St
1.1.3	I do n't really need an upgrade but I need something able to run at the same speeds or better than that of the 480 .	St
1.1.4	I do game and do some rendering .	St
1.1.5	The catch : I need it for 200 or less .	St
1.1.6	Any help is appreciated .	Polite
1.1.7	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Is that 200 will get something far better IMO .	St
1.2.2	Stick to this list in a link to follow .	St
1.2.3	Bob - & gt ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html	St
1.3.1	From what I gathered there for 200 dollars a HD 7950 ( This coming from a NVIDIA fanboy ) is the best bang for my buck for what I 'm doing .	St
1.3.2	Link : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814202026 Would you agree ?	Ques
1.4.1	but its a few more $ $ .	St
1.4.2	http : //www.hwcompare.com/14813/geforce-gtx-760-vs-radeon-hd-7950/ You can see how the different card compare .	St
1.4.3	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	I doubt your going to get any better than that card at the 200 buck area .	St
1.5.2	Looks like equal to or slightly better than the 480 .	St
1.5.3	If you have more bucks then the mix changes .	St
