i was sharing we've discussed this before and there are solutions that get the usb working again.
however once in a while someone wants the &quot;true fix&quot; which means you get the makers and driver writers to correct the root cause.
i am more than willing to discuss this in deep detail.
and if you want to truly give the forum the kindness you say you have, all you need to do is share how you are solving it.
