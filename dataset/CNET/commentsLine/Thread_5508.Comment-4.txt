it sounds like xp is in an autoplay loop.
right click on the usb drive under the file explorer and adjust the &quot;autoplay&quot; settings to &quot;ask me what to do every time&quot; or &quot;take no action&quot;.
or you can go to the usb drive under in &quot;computer management&quot; -&gt; &quot;administrative tools&quot; -&gt; &quot;disk management&quot; and select &quot;do nothing&quot; for autoplay.
the usb drive may have to be inserted for it to be seen with either method.
