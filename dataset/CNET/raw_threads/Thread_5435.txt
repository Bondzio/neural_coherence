And many USB 2.0 hard disks don't work in USB 1.1 ports. Since there is nothing to work with in your post, try http://www.usbman.com Bob

I can then proceed to tell you the Video Streaming Support (API) is absent in that USB implementation. The lack of information on your part makes a discussion sputter and die. Bob
