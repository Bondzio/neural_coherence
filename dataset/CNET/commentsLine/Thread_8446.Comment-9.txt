to be honest, i am only marginally familiar with autonet.
i came across it once while searching for wi-max availability.
isn't it really just the same network that your cell-phone would use?
unless you have some reason to connect a whole bunch of devices to it, couldn't you just connect your laptop (or whatever) to your cellphone over bluetooth or a cable, or get a cellular modem?
why pay, what, $30/month or something for yet another subscription to something you probably already have?
