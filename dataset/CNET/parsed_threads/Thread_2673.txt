<s> I play Luxor a lot also star wars etc. </s>
<s> Video starts to shake, then starts to jump ball in one place now three balls over, person on left now on right. </s>
<s> System will either restart or end game play. </s>
<s> If I stop the game will get blue screen and restart, system will not shut down completely using proper shutdown procedures after game play. </s>
<s> Works fine with office 2003 and all associated programs. </s>
<s> System fans increase and decrease in speed at any time, checked AC power in via UPS and its a solid 120VAC out. </s>
<s> Need help on this one. </s>
<s> THanks in advance </s>
<s> I forgot to tell you that I have an ATA power supply tester and it is all green when testing this power supply. </s>
<s> CD/DVD's are not running when fans slow and +5V dip down below +4.9Vs. </s>
<s> Your power isn't too stable, replace it. </s>
<s> While 450W is pretty good enough, each leg of power can be lagging, so now is a good time to replace before it starts to stress componets. </s>
<s> Plus, a top-notch AGP video card is very demanding and if you're wanting hi-end output the system starts to lag as well, perforamnce wise. </s>
<s> Decent generic psus are in the 500W range and namebrand if 400W are stable. </s>
<s> Heck, some users are putting in 600W in order not to worry about power. </s>
<s> An ATX tester only checks for presence of power not necisarrily if clean&stable output, so its only good to say, good/bad power present if undeterminable. </s>
<s> However, power should flucate with 5%(good) and 10% now and then and now always. </s>
<s> A good AC line conditioner can help too as an extra measure. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I am montering both +5v and they are spiking up from 4.82v on one and down from 4.92v on the other. </s>
<s> Have a APC 500 back-UPS and it is steady on the output side/input to puter. </s>
<s> +12 and the rest seem to be okay except for a major downward spike then it spikes up a bit. </s>
<s> Any brands you would suggest? </s>
<s> I found that &quot;generics&quot; when in hand and that are heavy usually can be trusted and be 500W+. </s>
<s> I have found huge rating on similar looking genercis of 400W+(and others) but are light as a feather sorta speak, they don't last long. </s>
<s> I recommend on namebrands, Antec, Enermax, and Deer, plus Sparkle, though Enlight could work if not too demanding. </s>
<s> Check the websites of Geeks and NewEgg for decent psus. </s>
