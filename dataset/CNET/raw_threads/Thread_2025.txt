Helloo,, Im starting CAD course next term in university then 3dmax the following one, so I need to upgrade, I currently own an ASUS Intel(R) core(TM) 2 Duo CPU 8400 @2.26 GHZ 4 GB with 32 bit operating system. Its either I buy a heavy duty desktop computer and still use my old laptop for any work in university, Or I just buy a laptop with better performace, Im going to be doing a lot of rendering and I only worked 2d on my current laptop works just great, didnt starts any 3d work so I dont know how it would actually do. problem is I will need a mobile device not sure if my current one is adequate

Ask the instructor if they have a list of machines they suggest. -&gt; For really heavy work I am still going back to the desktops. Bob
