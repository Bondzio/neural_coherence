After trouble free operation of my Belkin N Wireless Modem Router, it has suddenly started failing to connect with the internet (the amber internet light is flashing).
I have disconnected it and re-connected my old Voyager 2091 router which is working perfectly.
Finding that this worked, I replaced the Voyager with the Belkin, but it still fails to connect the internet (amber light flashing so I am back on the Voyager!).
I would prefer to be using the Belkin - any suggestions to cure the modem?
Thanks
