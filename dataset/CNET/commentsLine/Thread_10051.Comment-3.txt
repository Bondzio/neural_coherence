the company i work for installs secuirty cameras and we have tested just about all the lower end cameras.
we found d-links (depending on the model) to be ok but not impressive.
most of ours now use axis cameras.
the 206w can be bought for under $190 if you shop around.
the new 207w (has audio) can be found for as low as $260.
these cameras have excellent picture quality up to 30fps at 640x480 and good color quality.
i've never tried the wilife ones but their obvious lack of specs makes me wonder just how good of cameras they are.keep in mind that you will want a camera that can handle low lux levels like 4 and under.
otherwise video will get grainy in lower light levels.
