<s> I have an Inspiron 8600, and I've been using a Seagate 100GB external USB hard drive for media storage (music, videos, etc.). </s>
<s> While in a hurry the other night, I made the mistake of unplugging my external hard drive before &quot;safely removing&quot; the hardware via the &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; icon in the taskbar. </s>
<s> It immediately caused the &quot;Power Surge On Hub Port&quot; warning (which will not go away), and the external hard drive no longer works on my computer. </s>
<s> It works just fine on anyone else's computer. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> It is very important to me that I get that media back (I am a musician). </s>
<s> I can deal with the Power Surge messages with the R89758 driver, but I need to be able to use the hard drive. </s>
