i have not had very good experiences with our it guy at work--he has some odd ideas like saying that mozilla products are for &quot;home users&quot; only and insisting we can't use firefox.
i went ahead and purchased a new dell studio desktop with win 7 for my office (without his advice, which annoyed him) and he is now insisting that i can't run win 7--that all computers on the network must be on the same operating system (most are using xp), and he claims all computers must have same software, and has moved people &quot;back&quot; to excel 2004, etc, removing newer editions.
i can't find any evidence to support this.
he claims that the server won't run properly if we use different operating systems.
i think he is misguiding us.
any input?
