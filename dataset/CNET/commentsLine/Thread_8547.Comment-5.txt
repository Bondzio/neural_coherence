i use a targus notebook chill mat for my 12&quot; powerbook.
it works pretty well but it might be a bit small for your laptop.
my boyfriend has a 15&quot; widescreen laptop and got an antec notebook cooler.
it has two (two-speed) fans and the surface is large enough to cover the entire base of his laptop.
the only annoyance may be that the antec has a bright blue led light that turns on when you have the fan plugged in (via usb).
otherwise, it might be the best one for you.
