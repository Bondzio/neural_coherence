my situation is that if i boot on any hard drive with an nvidia driver, something in my motherboard will not boot.
if u look at this picture, http://www.winsupersite.com/images/showcase/winvista_install_clean_002.jpg you will notice this is my so called loading bar.
when it scrolls across 3 or 4 times with an nvidia driver, it will get stuck ad hand the boot process.
Ntune, an overclocking utility, has a fan speed controll ive always liked.
the 8800 GTX, i said gts on accident earlier, but it has a wierd fan speed glitch and needs to be sped up by ntune or riva tuner.
if u play crysis at 1920x1200 medium settings and very high textures like me, that would chew up an 8800 gtx after 2 hours, it will get up to 87-90C at 60% fan speed and itl stay at 70ish with 100% for me.
i also play CoD4 and unreal tournament 3 1920x1200 max settings with 60 capped fps never changing.
basicly anyway i need a way to uninstall ntune on my other hard drive so i can boot successfully every time.
