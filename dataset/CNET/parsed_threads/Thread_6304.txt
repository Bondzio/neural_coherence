<s> ''As the title says, i'm building a cheap, but usable computer.'' </s>
<s> You can't have a usable computer running Windows XP with only 256MB of RAM. </s>
<s> 512MB is the bare minimum for Windows XP; you'll want 1GB if you're going to be playing games. </s>
<s> Are you going to be playing ANY 3D games on this computer? </s>
<s> If so, you'll want to get a better video card; the whole GeForce MX series sucked, and the FX5200 is the worst of them all. </s>
<s> Also, I don't recommend that you go with the socket 754 platform; it's old, it doesn't support dual-channel RAM, and most motherboards have only an AGP slot. </s>
<s> AMD has greatly dropped the prices of Athlon 64s; you can pick up a socket 939 Athlon 64 3000+ (this is the lowest model) for only $66. </s>
<s> I'll post a parts list off of newegg (along with URLs) tomorrow morning; it's 11:45 here, and I'm tired. </s>
<s> that would be great, thank you. </s>

<s> I didn't include a power supply because I assumed your case has one already. </s>
<s> Am I correct in my assumption? </s>
<s> you need a bigger case for the 'puter. </s>
<s> its not worth saving money on that. </s>
<s> airflow is very important and you need fans for the case. </s>
<s> the bigger ones have several fans installed. </s>
<s> also get a good power supply. </s>
<s> 550w should be the minimum with today's gear. </s>
<s> antec has lots of 'em and good ones. </s>
<s> ''you need a bigger case for the 'puter.'' </s>
<s> He has a mid-tower case; the only thing bigger is a full-tower case, and those are for servers. </s>
<s> ''airflow is very important and you need fans for the case.'' </s>
<s> His case has an 80mm front fan, and a 120mm rear fan. </s>
<s> IMO, that's good enough for a budget computer. </s>
<s> Here's his case on newegg &quot;also get a good power supply. </s>
<s> 550w should be the minimum with today's gear. </s>
<s> 550W is way overkill for a budget computer. </s>
<s> That parts list that I posted will run fine on a good 350W PSU. </s>
<s> You only need 550W for a really high-end computer with multiple hard drives, video cards, etc. </s>
<s> yes, it already has a power supply. </s>
<s> one problem that i can see is that it appears that my powersupply only supports a twenty power pin mother board. </s>
<s> the mother board you put down has 24. is that a problem? </s>
<s> You can get a 20-24 pin adapter. </s>
<s> More importantly, what's the brand and model of the PSU? </s>
<s> What's the total wattage and what's the amperage on the 12V rail? </s>
<s> these pages tell about the case specs, and the power supply specs. </s>
<s> http://www.antec.com/specs/sl350_spe.html http://www.antec.com/specs/solu_slk3700amb_spe.html# it's good to know i can get an adapter for the 20 pin plug, that helps alot. </s>
<s> That power supply will work fine with the parts list; the motherboard should come with a 20-24 pin adapter. </s>
<s> great, thank you very much for your help. </s>
