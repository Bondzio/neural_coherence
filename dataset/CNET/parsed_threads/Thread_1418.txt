<s> I been having alot of restarts and lockups so I checked everything out. </s>
<s> I noticed my -v5 is at -61.93 in the Bios. </s>
<s> What would that do? </s>
<s> I figured it means a bad power supply. </s>
<s> So I swapped it out and the voltage looks better but the pc is still slow. </s>
<s> Think it might of screwed the ram, cpu, or mainboard up or just need to reinstall XP? </s>
<s> Let me know what you think.. All Voltage numbers before the swap. </s>
<s> CPU temp 56C/132F Vcore 1.64v Vcc1.5 1.48V Vcc3.3 3.28V +5v 4.41 +12V 12.82 -12V 12.77 -5v -61.93 Vbat 3.28 5VSB 5.40 </s>
<s> You are saying that's -sixty voltages, not six volts? </s>
<s> Since, you swapped the psu out and it still a problem then be sure to reduce the system to the bare minimum. </s>
<s> Remove all devices, etc. </s>
<s> and just make a bare system, remove/uplug all drives at least. </s>
<s> that way you can return devices if voltage become stable before doing so. </s>
<s> The device that seems to bring it down, then that's a iffy part. </s>
<s> When a psu problem blows-up a system it may take down other components/devices. </s>
<s> Be sure also that all cables, etc. </s>
<s> are firmly attached/seated. </s>
<s> I'll check the wiring crimps as well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> sixty. </s>
<s> I already swapped the PSU and all voltage is now fine. </s>
<s> Could it of done damage to the processor or mainboard or even both? </s>
<s> The pc takes forever to boot up. </s>
<s> Once it boots up it won't play mp3's without skipping. </s>
<s> Pc locks up with the mp3s playing also until its done or it still skip like a record would. </s>
<s> Did you reduce the system? </s>
<s> You want to find bad component/device? </s>
<s> If bad voltage did any damage yoy need to troubleshoot. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> You must not know much. </s>
<s> Nothing in the system besides ram/cpu/mb would cause the pc to be slow. </s>
<s> So what are you telling me to unconnect stuff. </s>
<s> Stop wasting peoples time. </s>
<s> I ended up reinstalling everything and all is well. </s>
<s> Must of been a root kit or something that wasn't detected. </s>
<s> You did nothing to troubleshoot any devices and fell back on a reload. </s>
<s> If the reload didn't load what would you have done? </s>
<s> If any voltages aren't h/w dependant then yeah, I don't what is. </s>
<s> You will report if your problems resurfaces later. </s>
<s> good day -----Willy </s>
<s> I cdrom floppy ect is not going to cause a slowdown. </s>
<s> If the voltage is normal then why would you do that. </s>
<s> Again wasting peoples time as only thing that would of been messed up and caused a slowdown would be the processor or ram or even the mb. </s>
<s> So don't reply when you don't know. </s>
<s> Any hardware that can cause an interrupt ( cd-rom, floppy, ethernet etc... ) request to occur can cause a slowdown. </s>
<s> If your computer is constantly servicing interrupts from faulty hardware your system will slow to a crawl. </s>
<s> faulty hardware can be easily caused by bad voltages... you should listen to him </s>
