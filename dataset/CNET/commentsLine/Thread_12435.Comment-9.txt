the situation is not very encouraging at all, as hdd health, the hard disk monitoring application on my pc, shows a bad reading (-2) for seek time performance including a -59 reading for an unknown attribute, resulting in a t.e.c.
date of 2/16/2005, which means eminent hd failure sometime very soon.
