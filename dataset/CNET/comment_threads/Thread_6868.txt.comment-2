You could try it with the existing but at some point suspect you'll have to replace.
If the budget permits...I'd replace now while you're doing the GPU.
Re replacement options...I wouldn't consider either of those you've listed.
I would however recommend something with a better warranty, longer MTBF, better buyer ratings, greater efficiency (uses less electricity), better tech site reviews like the one below.
