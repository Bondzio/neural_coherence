Hey thanks for replying, O.k well i.ve tryed the new processor (celeron d 335+) and no go my computer or motherboard or whatever wont reconize it.
So i've looked all over the net and have found out that intel no longer supports my motherboard but the last info on it that they posted was it supported a celeron 1.8 i think it was, so i'm thinking that if i change my bios to read the new processor it will work (i'm new to this stuff so if i'm totally wrong dont hold it against me.)
