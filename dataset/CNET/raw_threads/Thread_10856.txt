Upon power up, it gets to the Windows XP startup screen, the blue dots scroll back and forth for about 20-30 seconds, then the monitor goes blank. I can start the computer in safe mode OK. I used system restore to go backwards a couple of days, but no luck with that either. What am I missing here?? Thanks in advance.

I have noticed that when the Windows startup screen goes blank, I then hear the hard drive spin down. I have disabled all the services and startup entries in MSCONFIG, that made no difference. I have removed RAM sticks one pair at a time, as well as individually, also with no change.

In this case I would head back to safe mode and research all items in MSCONFIG and see what I could disable. Remember I would not leave any any entry enabled unless I knew why. Bob
