Pop in another PSU.
There are PSU testers but for years when I head 3 beeps it was a dead board or incompatible ram or bad sockets or the chip that interfaces with the RAM (still means a dead motherboard.)
I've seen techs lose months on boards like that.
I learned to get them out of the shop fast to save us from wasting hours trying to recover the dead boards.
