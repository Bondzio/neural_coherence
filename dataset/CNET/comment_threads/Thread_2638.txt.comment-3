hey -- spoke with ATI, they dont have anything to offer.
again the problem is that Im *not* trying to watch over-the-air because that will be dead real soon.
I'm trying to use the cable signal that is already coming into my house.
ATI guy said that the problem is that the cable companies encode their signals so tht only their boxes can decode, forcing me to rent their large boxes for $150/yr.
Im looking for a better solution.
