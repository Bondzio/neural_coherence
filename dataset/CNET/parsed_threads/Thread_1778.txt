<s> My simpletech 500gb external hard drive was working fine a few months back on Windows Vista. </s>
<s> However, it doesnt work any more. </s>
<s> When I tried to run the external hard drive today, the system asked me to find software drive for the device. </s>
<s> It cannot find any driver by itself. </s>
<s> I believe the drive is pre formatted as I didnt have to install any drivers when I first ran it, and it worked just fine then. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Does another USB drive work? </s>
<s> If so, call them up and ask for the warranty exchange. </s>
<s> Also, move the USB cable to the rear USB port of the desktop. </s>
<s> Try your other USB cable and then make the call. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> There are no drivers needed. </s>
