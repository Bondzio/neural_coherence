<s> I am a Soldier serving in Iraq, trying to help my stepson back home with a computer problem. </s>
<s> He has a Viking Interworks 512 MB USB 2.0 Flash Drive. </s>
<s> His computer at work (running Windows XP) does not recognize it and always goes to the download wizard to look for drivers. </s>
<s> It does work properly on a different computer, and he has tested all of the USB ports on the problem computer, and they all work. </s>
<s> In the past when plugging a USB 2.0 device into a USB 1.0 port, I have seen a pop-up window come up that says it can run faster, but it still works. </s>
<s> Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> ...make sure the problem computer's XP is SP2 and fully updated. </s>
