that's not good.
the area from vents to the heatsinks and that fan act to collect cat fuzz and more.
when i clean up i use a can of compressed air and blow the opposite direction of the air flow.
if possible i insert a wood stick in the fan to keep it for spinning during the air blast to prevent damage.
these are generic instructions.
you can find on the internet details about how to get inside if you can't clean it up with the air can.
