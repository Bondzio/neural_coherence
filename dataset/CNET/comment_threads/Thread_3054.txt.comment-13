I built a little project awhile ago.
It is a solar garden LED lights powered with single LiON 1000mAh battery.
PIC microcontroller is monitoring battery voltage and prevents it to drop below 3V, as well to rise above 4,10V.
Charging current is 50mA at max., meaning 0.05C.
Maximum discharge current is about 0,02C.
My question is, how will forementioned conditions affect battery lifespan.
I read somewhere that when charging LiON battery below 0.18C, battery voltage of 4,2V means that the battery is virtually full, is this true?
