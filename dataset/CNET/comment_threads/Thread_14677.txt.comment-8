Thank you again for your help.
Ive taken the cover off the existing power supply but have not unplugged any of the cables.
Is it as easy as it appears to be to replace the power supply..ie.
do I just unplug the old and plug in the new, or is it something I need to go and pay $70 for a pro to do it.
Thanks
