What monitors do you have - inputs - DVI/VGA/ other?
and what are you going to use it for?
Don't know the radeon card but I suspect that the 2 dvi outputs will be separate, and the HDMI and display port will be alternatives to the DVI, but I could be wrong.
I use 3 monitors - 2 driven by a high end Matrox card via dvi and the third by a separate old pci card, as I don't need anything special on that screen which is just used for browser and email.
