1.1.2	Now my CPU is shown as a single core 1.8 GHZ processor instead of dual core 1.8 (Task manager, system) Also, the tab for &quot;processor&quot; disappeared in device manager.	St
1.1.3	Maybe it's a driver for the motherboard?	St
1.1.4	I already installed everything and updated a few audio drivers, etc.	St
1.1.5	And the box clearly reads: Supports Intel Core 2 Duo and Quad.	St
