<s> Is water cooling a good investment for the AMD ATHLON 64 cpu? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> if not, a zalman 90 should do the trick. </s>
<s> you can still oc pretty good with the zalman 90. wc is for pure oc'ers and people that want a really quiet pc. </s>

<s> Water cooling is an over kill with a AMD64 they DO NOT RUN HOTeven with some over clocking!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> i don't do any overclocking on my cpu so there's no need for water cooling. </s>
<s> water cooling may enable a higher overclock but the cpu might not last as long due to the overclocking stress. </s>
<s> plus i'd worry if the water pump all of a sudden decided to fail, and my cpu in its overclocked state stopped receiving a steady stream of cool water </s>
<s> Yes,We install water cooled systems in our systems But we only use IT professionals and highest quaility hardware. </s>
<s> Having been there and done that, water cooling did help my CPU temps and did wonders for my GPU temps, but decent air cooling (case with 120mm fans, Zalman or Thermalright heatsink, Zalman VF700-AlCu GPU heatsink, Seasonic S12 series power supply) will get you quiet without the complexity and additional power consumption from a water pump that you'll get with water cooling. </s>
<s> Well, OK, if you have a reasonably high-powered system and want quiet, air cooling might not cut it. </s>
<s> Water works well there. </s>
<s> Plan on spending about $300 in parts to do it right. </s>
<s> See http://www.dangerden.com and some of the better water cooling forums like http://forums.overclockers.com.au/forumdisplay.php?f=24 if you're serious. </s>

<s> I am cooling an AMD 2600 CPU and a NVidia GPU with water for at least 2 years. </s>
<s> The water cooling did cost $300 and required some case moding but it is absolutely silent. </s>
<s> It does require maintenance, adding coolant semiannually. </s>
<s> I can hear my CD, DVD, and HDD spinning. </s>
<s> The water cooled system is quieter than my laptop, Dell Latitude D600. </s>
<s> Yes, the system has been OC'd and it was amazing what I could do with it! </s>
<s> I've got 2 AMD 64 systems (3000 + 3400) running with the retail package fans installed on the CPU and 120mm case fans. </s>
<s> Yes, they are hot but not as hot as those 32 bit AMD 2600. </s>
<s> They are very quiet. </s>
<s> Save your money and spend it on other hardware. </s>
<s> Only if if it is on fire! </s>

<s> I have built many pcs and yes i have overclocked a few, though I am not generally in favour of overclocking, but I have never found water colling necessary. </s>
<s> I have seen a couple which are older models and overclocked to the max, which get a bit war! </s>
<s> but if you are running at standard spped it is absolutely unnesessary </s>
<s> The AMD 64 cpu's were designed to run cooler. </s>
<s> And there stupid fast already so no need to overclock them. </s>
<s> Of all my buddies with super fast systems only two of them use the water cooled sulutions and they both run overclocked Intel P-4's. </s>
<s> My AMD 64 FX is just as fast and I have no problems with cooling it. </s>
<s> Can't wait to get my new AMD Athlon 64 X2 processor. </s>
