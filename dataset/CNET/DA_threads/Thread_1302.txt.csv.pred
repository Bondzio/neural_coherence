1.1.1	Hi all !	St
1.1.2	With the switch off of analogue television transmitters in the UK fast approaching , and me being a bit of a cheapskate , i was wondering if it is possible to share television from one PC to others on your wireless network .	St
1.1.3	For example , i have 4 PCs , all over the house , all but one in rooms that have a TV on an internal aerial , and the other with a TV card connected to an external aerial .	St
1.1.4	Is it possible to share that television over my home network ( perhaps in a similar way to printer sharing ) , so that i could browse TV from any computer as i please , or am i going to have to pay up for more digi boxes ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks , Alex .	St
