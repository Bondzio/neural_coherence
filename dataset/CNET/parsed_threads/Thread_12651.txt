<s> I rececently purchased a wireless network adaptor, while I am waiting for my router to come in the mail. </s>
<s> But for some reason I have internet connection in my apartment. </s>
<s> I guess I might have connected to someone elses netowork or maybe a &quot;hot spot&quot;. </s>
<s> Now while I am using this network, which is not mine, can other people steal file from me? </s>
<s> Your wifi and the internet is a &quot;network&quot; so your request fails on the gitgo. </s>
<s> However, we often turn on WEP, WPA and even MAC filtering to harden the home network. </s>
<s> In answer to &quot;can other people steal file from me?&quot; the answer is very likely. </s>
<s> Do a little research about the EVIL TWIN problem of wifi hotspots and you quickly learn to distrust unknown spots. </s>

<s> So what you are trying to say is that I shouldn't connect to other netowrks or WiFi because they can hack into my computer? </s>
