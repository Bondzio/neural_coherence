<s> Hi AMD Athlon Processor, 1.01Ghz, 768MB RAM ASUS AGP-V7700/32M (TVR) NVIDIA GeForce2 GTS/GeForce2 Pro I am trying to fix my parents computer, but as a bit of a novice to pc hardware I am struggling to find the solution. </s>
<s> I feel it could be the graphics card, but need confirmation from you clever cnet-ers. </s>
<s> A while ago (months) the pc loaded up and the screen is strange - where there is a dark box (such as the banner on this webpage) a dark shade continues from the edge of the banner, the width of the banner, to the edge of the screen. </s>
<s> Wherever there is text, a faint dark strip extends from the text to the edge of the screen. </s>
<s> I have tried the monitor in my laptop as an external screen, and it works fine. </s>
<s> I have taken the ASUS AGP out and got the dust off, re-connected and still the same. </s>
<s> Have you seen this before? </s>
<s> What could be the problem. </s>
<s> I dont have another graphics card to test, so I'd need to purchase one, but want to be sure it wont be a waste of money. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time Andy </s>
<s> Seems like it's done well and time to get something else. </s>
<s> Is it worth 10 or 20 bucks? </s>
