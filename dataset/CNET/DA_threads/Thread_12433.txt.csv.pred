1.1.1	Hello, I installed a couple of PCI 2.2 compliant devices (ADSL modem and Ethernet adapter) on my old Win95 PC and I can't make them work.	St
1.1.2	I'm sure drivers are right for my OS, so I think it's because my PCI slots are 2.1 compliant.	St
1.1.3	Now, I'm looking for a BIOS upgrade.	St
1.1.4	Here are informations about my mobo and BIOS BIOS Type: Award BIOS Date: 01/16/98 BIOS ID String: 01/16/98-I430TX-ALI5135-2A59ITJAC OEM Signon: IT-586TX1 Ver:1.31N FIGHTER TX ITALIANA TECHNOLOGIE Chipset: INTEL TRITON 430TX REV 1 Super I/O: ALI M5133 REV 0 FOUND AT PORT 3F0H I know my mobo was produced by Totem but their website ( http://www.totem.com.tw ) is no more online.	St
1.1.5	So I asked a BIOS upgrade to eSupport.com ( http://www.esupport.com ) and they told me they have the right one for $24.95.	St
1.1.6	Could any of you please answer my questions: - will the BIOS upgrade make my PCI 2.2 devices work with my mobo?	Ques
1.1.7	- have I any other way to get the right BIOS upgrade without paying money for it?	St
1.1.8	Thanks in advance Andrea	St
1.2.1	&quot; I think there is also may be some lack of understanding here.	St
1.2.2	The changes between PCI 2.1 and PCI 2.2 are very minor: www.pcisig.com/specifications/conventi..	St
1.2.3	The main thing people have been making a big deal about is 4.3.4.1, were 3.3V is now required on a 2.2 slot.	St
1.2.4	That has no contribution to the random lockup sort of problem.	St
1.2.5	If the slot didn't have 3.3, the card wouldn't work *at all*.	St
1.2.6	Very few motherboards with 2.1 compliance didn't hook up 3.3V to the slots.	St
1.2.7	In fact, motherboards that were designed for 2.1 could almost always just say &quot;now we support 2.2&quot; with no work, since the spec changes were mostly for 64 bit concerns or clarifications.	St
1.2.8	I think the comment by IQ179 about AMD motherboards not implementing a standard is kind of more lore than fact.	St
1.2.9	There's really not anything you could do wrong implementation-wise that would cause these sort of hangs.	St
1.2.10	There would be more generic problems with other PCI boards, or the boards would not work at all.&quot; http://www.pcisig.com/specifications/conventional/conventional_pci/2_2sum1215.pdf http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,9086546~mode=flat~days=120~start=100 If your machine does not hang on boot with that card, the real issue is likely to be zip-zero-noway-nohow support of Windows 95.	St
1.2.11	In fact, the 200 to 512 byte leak on each socket open/close was NEVER resolved by Microsoft.	St
1.2.12	Reference ... &quot;Windows 95 leaks about 200 bytes of main memory for each thread creation.	St
1.2.13	Each connection in MySQL creates a new thread, so you shouldn't run mysqld for an extended time on Windows 95 if your server handles many connections!	St
1.2.14	Other versions of Windows don't suffer from this bug.&quot; http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Windows_vs_Unix.html I don't expect any BIOS to solve your issues.	St
1.2.15	Bob	St
1.3.1	Using your: BIOS ID String: 01/16/98-I430TX-ALI5135-2A59ITJAC goto http://www.wimsbios.com and find the required match and then proceed to a support website.	St
1.3.2	While you mention the &quot;orginal&quot; support is no longer online, some friendly website many have your bios update.	St
1.3.3	Also, beware to properly follow update procedure and whenever, save you're old bios info as a possible safe bet.	St
1.3.4	IMHO, if all this is too much, etc.	St
1.3.5	and since you're trying to update an old system, please understand in the long run you maybe too far gone as older mtrbds.	St
1.3.6	just don't cut it.	St
1.3.7	The PCI2.1 complaintancy should be a build-in feature and not really a bios issue, other than what is possible.	St
1.3.8	In other words, if it doesn't work even after a bios update, there is no cure, just get a newer mtrbd.. good luck -----Willy	St
