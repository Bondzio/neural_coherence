I believe that 220 volt electricity is transmitted from the power companies in Central and South America at 50 Hertz not 60 hertz as is true in the US.
Make sure the voltage switch on the power supplies are set properly.
I suggest that you check with your power company to determine what they supply to your locality.
You may need an autosensing power supply similar to those used on laptops if the power is as variable as you say.
