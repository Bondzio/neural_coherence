I would like to buy a cable so that i can use my wireless keyboard and mouse from my bed. THe only thing is i am not sure which cable to get. I see that there are DB15 and HD15. what is the difference?

Pure guess would be that the HD is a better made and shielded cable to allow possibilities of running with a longer cable. Price may show the difference.
