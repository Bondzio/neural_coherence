How do I figure out if my mobo is PCI express?
It says it has 5 PCI ports is this the same as PCI express?
This is what I have... http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=607 This is stressing me out.
I need a new GPU and don't know if I can get PCI-E cards.
Thanks for any help or suggestions.
