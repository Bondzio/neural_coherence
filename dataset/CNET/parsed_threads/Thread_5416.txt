<s> Our computers (1 desktop, 1 laptop,and our Xbox) are presently connected to a Dynex DX-E401 4-Port/Cable/DSL Router. </s>
<s> We would like to keep this arrangement for the XBox & desktop for gaming purposes (general consensus seems to be a wired connection is faster than wireless). </s>
<s> However, I would like to add a Linksys WRT54GL Ver 1.1 wireless router for another laptop to roam around the house. </s>
<s> Can I just connect the Linksys wireless router into the Dynex wired router, or does everything now have to go through the wireless router first? </s>
<s> To connect the wireless router, do I run the setup CD in the laptop that I want to primarily use the wireless router? </s>
<s> I'm not the most savvy when it comes to this stuff, but can follow detailed directions. </s>
<s> If there are any links/videos, etc. </s>
<s> you can refer to me to that already addresses this issue, that would be great. </s>
<s> I greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide. </s>
<s> At the top of this forum is a welcome post and about 18 or 19 this is covered. </s>
<s> BUT why not just try it. </s>
<s> Some of the better router firmwares just work without you changing it to how we note in this forum's sticky. </s>
