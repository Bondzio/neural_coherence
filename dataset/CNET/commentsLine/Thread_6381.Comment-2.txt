the 2 page text email is about 60 characters per line of 50 lines, so that's 3,000 bytes per page or 6k for 2 pages.
now let's bump that up to 10k to allow for overhead and make the calculation easy.
16 gb is 16,000,000,000 and 10k is 10,000, so now we can just knock 4 zeros of that 16 gb and get 1,600,000 emails.
is that enough for you?
