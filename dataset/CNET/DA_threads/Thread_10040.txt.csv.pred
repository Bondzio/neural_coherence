1.1.1	ASUS M2N32-SLI Deluxe AM2 motherboard , AMD 64 X2 3800+ CPU / 1 stick of 1 gb Corsair pro 800 ddr2 ram / 500 watt Antec PSU .	St
1.1.2	I have Windows XP home sp2 that is installed on a IDE drive that was running fine on a older Asus A7V 133 system .	St
1.1.3	I have installed the new components and windows wo n't boot even in safe mode .	St
1.1.4	The system goes through POST fine with standard 1 beep , I can access BIOS and all components and memory are recognized without problems .	St
1.1.5	My skill level is a novice at these problems , any input would be helpful .	St
1.1.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Windows for many versions and years will cease to boot after we change the motherboard .	St
1.2.2	Look up XP REPAIR INSTALL and see if that fixes it .	St
1.2.3	Remember to install all those motherboard drivers after you get it booting .	St

1.3.1	The problem lies in that each system board uses a different chipset and subsequently , different IDE controller and hardware logic .	St
1.3.2	The A7V system board uses one of the VIA KX-133 chipset , but the M2N32-SLI uses a NVIDIA nForce 590 SLI MCP chipset , which is entirely different .	St
1.3.3	Unfortunately , when Windows sets up the OS , it bases the boot sequence on the hardware that you have at present and sometimes when you upgrade , the new hardware is n't common enough to allow the OS to make the transition to the new hardware .	St
1.3.4	The only thing that can be done is to put the old system board and components back in , transfer all the necessary data to CD or DVD media ( do n't forget your Favorites folder ) , then replace the old board with the new board and re-install from scratch .	St
1.3.5	A couple things you might want to try first before you have to swap everything out again .	St
1.3.6	Try booting from the XP CD to see if the new board will even be recognized by the OS .	St
1.3.7	If the CD will boot and you can get to the point where you can see the hard drives and partitions on the hard drive , then you know that the new system board is working fine .	St
1.3.8	At this point , you should press F3 and exit the install process .	St
1.3.9	If the system does n't boot properly , then you know that something is wrong .	St
1.3.10	It could be that you have a bad system board ( I 've see fresh out-of-the-box system boards have bad IDE controllers ) , possibly bad RAM , or possibly ( but not likely ) the BIOS needs to be updated ( usually not the case , but it 's always good to check ) .	St
1.3.11	Anyway , that 's the reason and the possible solutions to the problem .	St
1.3.12	Good luck !	Polite
1.3.13	Timothy	St
1.4.1	Thats the only solution !	St
1.4.2	Another reson to use Linux !	St
