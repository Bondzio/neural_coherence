<s> Every morning i have this trouble turning on my PC. </s>
<s> I turn on my AVR, then push the power button on cpu case. </s>
<s> What happened, the power LED only blink and the PC don't open/power on. </s>
<s> The first time this happen, I opened my case and look for the suspected culprit. </s>
<s> I detached my psu and have it check by qualified technician to see if it is bad or damaged. </s>
<s> It wasn't (use tester, it's good; did some switching on pins and got no problem!). </s>
<s> So I put back psu, and for other suspected culprit, this time: check the wires connecting my SW to power button. </s>
<s> I pull and replugged the pins/connector thinking it just need some &quot;refreshing&quot; and it will be good again. </s>
<s> Then, I turn on my PC again pushing the power button on the case. </s>
<s> It start my PC! </s>
<s> But the next morning, the same fate happened. </s>
<s> I've gone again to the same ordeal, repeating what I did the past day... And these have been my practice every morning since then.. Until, I got tired of doing it over and over again. </s>
<s> So, while my AVR is turn on i just let it sit there (perhaps 3-5 minutes) and out of disgust I pushed on the power AND my PC start again! </s>
<s> So every morning, I let my AVR turn on for several minutes (5 minutes) or even more before pushing my power button. </s>
<s> Sometimes, successful sometimes NOT. </s>
<s> I also observed that during COOL temperature (e.g when rain down poured the past night) I have this problem, but not on a HOT temperature (e.g. </s>
<s> no rain the past night). </s>
<s> I don't know what's exactly the culprit. </s>
<s> Please help me on this. </s>
<s> Suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Here's my PC's specs: Pentium 4, 3.06Ghz Mobo: Foxconn 865G7MF series Total Physical Memory (RAM): 1,024.00 MB OS: MS Windows XP Pro, version 5.1.2600 SP3 Build 2600 HDD: 2 (Hitachi, 80g; Fujitsu 6g) Optical: CDROM generic FDD: generic psu: 600watts generic avr: 500watts generic Thanks in advance guys! </s>
<s> Type BAD CAPS into google.com and what you find is one of the side effects is the machines won't start when cold. </s>
<s> As Robert stated, &quot;bad caps&quot; can be a fault. </s>
<s> Google for images to verify yours. </s>
<s> Its a known problem. </s>
<s> Next, while the PSU was tested, I believe it was simple voltage &quot;LEDs&quot; on small tester rather than a full-blown power test. </s>
<s> Some PSUs can appear OK on the little tester but fail as when a real power demand is required not just the presence as the &quot;pumff&quot; to get things going isn't there. </s>
<s> They too suffer from bad caps as well as caps are everywhere in electronics. </s>
<s> If your system case isn't well cooled, a PSU can falter over time on that alone. </s>
<s> Switches are tricky, they can work and not if of cheap make-up or faulty, period. </s>
<s> Though, switches are rarely a cause of problems, simple as they, only an ohm meter can verify that. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I've read the link you suggested re: bad caps. </s>
<s> One more info, power outage is a regular occurrence in my place. </s>
<s> I believe this can damage electronic equipment, but I'm still not that aware of which equipment will be easily affected by this power outage. </s>
<s> Thank you Robert and Willy! </s>
<s> I'll go check my capacitors. </s>
<s> If you experience re-occurring AC outages and the returning surges can cause havoc on any electronics, PCs being very prone. </s>
<s> I suggest besides a simple surge protector(a good one), the likes of a decent UPS(orderly shutdown) plus a &quot;line conditioner&quot;. </s>
<s> This all costs, but it can be worth the value if it reduces or eliminates much of AC problems which in turn can cause PC issues. </s>
<s> FYI- I use solo AC surge protectors for each line and placed on a surge protected strip which in turn in plugged-in to a surge outlet socket at wall. </s>
<s> Sensitive devices are routed to a line conditioner which is also plugged-in to a surge protected outlet. </s>
<s> Why, all this protection, because I live in a wooded area where &quot;lighting hits&quot; are common. </s>
<s> I do unplug everything when things get hairy when home. </s>
<s> I've been saved more than once just replace the surge protection that got hit. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
