<s> I'm trying to setup a WD My Book Live in a small office and am having a bit of trouble. </s>
<s> I can access the drive from any computers on the network by mapping the drive via IP address, but I'd like the computers to recognize it automatically. </s>
<s> I think the problem is our overall network setup. </s>
<s> We have an at&amp;t modem that connects to a Netgear router and a Netgear switcher. </s>
<s> When I plug the drive into the router, all the computers that are connected wirelessly see the drive automatically as another computer on the network but the computers connected via ethernet to the switcher don't see it. </s>
<s> When I plug the drive into the modem, all of the computers can access it from its IP address, but none sees it automatically. </s>
<s> Is that just how this stuff works or is there something I can do so that all of our computers see it automatically? </s>
<s> I could not find the make, model of the modem so I'll suggest you google this: &quot;How to use a router as a WAP?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the response. </s>
<s> I found the following article http://www.dslreports.com/faq/11233 Is that basically what you're suggesting? </s>
<s> Following this, would I leave my wireless router plugged into the modem or plug it into the switch that is already plugged into the modem? </s>
<s> Do I leave the My Book plugged into the wireless router? </s>
<s> For clarification, I have an AT&amp;T 2Wire wireless router/modem combo unit that feeds internet to a Netgear N750 wireless router and a Netgear FSV318 Firewall into a Netgear FS516 Ethernet Switch. </s>
<s> The My Book Live is currently plugged into the AT&amp;T 2Wire. </s>
<s> But I see your network is something beyond the norm. </s>
<s> I think you must learn all about it and make your own decisions. </s>
<s> Sorry if this disappoints you but what you supplied confirms you are experiencing the DOUBLE NAT issues. </s>
