Cable select should with the newer type 40-pin/80-wire IDE cables provide the fix. If not, then the HD jumpers may need an added jumper for solo or dual operation, if applicable. So visit the HD makers website to see how they expect their operation to be set for dual install or check that decal/sticker found on the HD. tada -----Willy
