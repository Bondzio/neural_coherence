After spending several hours researching the archives Im ready to buy a DVD+Ram burner. Searching my price range ($50.00) I have found three brands im contemplating on. 1)-Asus 2)-BenQ 3)-LG Any users input as to pros or cons would be greatly appreciated! I dont minding spending up to $100.00 if its really worth it so im open to other options as well. Also many thanks to those hundreds of responses (especially those including links to great spec sites) covering everything I needed to know about DVD burners and thanks to CNET for its comprehensive (19 pages) ''Burner Buying Guide''! Looking at other posts I plan on checking out Toshiba and NEC burners as well but absolutely want one that burns DVD Ram as my first priority is for my C drive back up. Many thanks, Ken Ps: Whats the scoop on making sure I get drivers and software w/purchase? I read that some units do not come with these? (OEM bulk units)? I understand the concept and wondering if I should make sure what I do and dont get w/purchase. Will I need a cable as im replacing my CDRom with the new burner (as the master) and keeping my CD burner/DVD Rom as a slave.

At least the sub 50 dollar units are not a big bite in the budget anymore. I will share that I always record at 1/2 the rated media speed. I don't want to debate why but feel it's a key reason why I have so few problems. Bob

Makes sense to me and when I burn im in no hurry anyway. Thanks for the heads up on that idea. Mostly just wondering if anyone here has any pros or cons on brands LG, Asus, and Benq. As I have found these 3 at comparable prices. I will head back to the stores online review panel for more input. BTW I did read here somewhere that someone said they did not have a problem w/less costly blank media for burning DVD Ram. ie: Ram is not as picky as to which brand of media as compared to DVD R/RW media in general. I ask because I have found blank Ram media from $14.00 each (Memorex) to $6.00 each (unknown name) both not in the cartridge form. I did read a review on the more expensive Memorex label from a office tech who has used them exclusively for years witn never a single problem. Thanks again, Ken

Its also one of the few that will work with a slower processor. (and the site I found it at offers free shipping) Thanks, Ken

Also can the software for a burner be installed on an external HD and use that Hd's storage room for operating the burner? The unit im looking at needs a min. (.5G) processor where as most of the others need a min. 1.2G speed. What will this affect? My old computer which im on now is only a small .5G processor with a 6G HD so im wondering if I can use the extra space on my external HD. I have a more recent unit which had a fatal crash and I havent restored it yet as I need to start from scratch but its bigger and faster. (many lessons learned!) Do I need to wait untill I get my better computer back up and running? Thanks again, Ken

Depending on the crash, (software or hardware) you could either piece together the bad components with your other computer - or use your reboot disc - if software, to reinstall windows. It is really easy to do with XP, but you will lose all your files.

The Lite-On DVD +/- RW SOHW-1693S was just $59, so I purchased that. (By the way, the same drive is just $44.99 at thetechgeek.com). I have a dual boot with Windows ME and XP on an IBM Net Vista 850 mhz Pentium III. My video capture device is a Belkin USB Video Bus. I also have an Intel Pocket PC Camera attached by USB. Whenever I try to capture video with my Nero software, I get a &quot;blue screen of death&quot; that flashes on the screen for about 2 seconds saying something about not enough memory. So, if the purpose of your getting a DVD burner is to capture video, your limited memory may be an issue. For capturing video, the standalone DVD recorders attached directly to your cable system/dvr/TV are much better. I also have a $98 ILO DVD recorder which I got at Walmart, and it's so much easier than using the Nero software that comes with the LiteOn DVD burner...no 'blue screens of death'. But if you are just wanting to use it to burn data, the LiteOn DVD burner is very good from my experience with it so far. It also plays back DVD in the formats burned from my ILO DVD recorder.
