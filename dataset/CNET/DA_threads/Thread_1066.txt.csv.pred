1.1.1	I'm sure this is Networking 101, but here goes.	St
1.1.2	My home network utilizes a Verizon Actiontec MI424-WR router - 100 mbps.	St
1.1.3	I have a DLink DNS-321 for Network storage.	St
1.1.4	And I'd like to have at least one computer (hardwired) in my network connect at 1000 mbps.	St
1.1.5	My question is this...	St
1.1.6	If I buy a 1000 mbps Switch, add it to the network and connect it to DNS-321 and the NIC of my workstation, can I access the DNS-321 at 1000 mbps?	St
1.1.7	In other words, will my data flow thru the switch directly between the two devices without having to go thru the (slower) router?	St
1.1.8	Thanks, ...Jerry	St
