The computer runs from a cord, to a router, then to an internet modem, the same as another comp, which works fine. There has been no chnges to the comp. The computer im on now, runs off a weireless USB adaptor that picks off the net from the same router as the teo other comps. Ive done a fair bit to try and slove it, and here are all the facts so far... I can ping websites, and i normally get all packets recieved, or some. I can send packets perfectly. When i double click my LAN connection, it comes up with like 60million packets sent, and only 200,000 recieved. I'm pretty sure this is the problem, but i dont know how to fix it.... ive tried a different cord, ive tried with the wireless USB, both dont work. Ive done /release all /renew all, and a fast virus scan.Ive also tried a system restore to when my net last worked (yesterday) My ip, DNS and all look ok from what i've seen on other forums. I'm running on Windows XP!! Please hhelpppp!
