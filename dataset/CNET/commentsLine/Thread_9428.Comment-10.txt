however, i have decided to wait until vista comes out before purchasing a new one..having an older operating system does make your new computer seem obsolete much faster!
mr. gates has enough money, i am not gonna pay for xp now and then upgrade to vista later on!
have 2 older computers that still function, in about a year i will buy a new amd machine of some sort..
