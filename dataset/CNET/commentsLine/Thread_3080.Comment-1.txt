hello folks, ok i have a laptop upstairs (winxp) networked to a downstars desktop (win2k).
works great.
now i have a second desktop in that downstairs office hooked up to the same wireless router, but while i can control it remotely via tightvnc, i can't network it via windows explorer.
wires are obviously there i created an identical user and password on that computer i can see new computer's name under the collective workgroup name i configured all drives to share but when i click on it it says i don't have access to this resource ??
what am i missing?
thanks - fj
