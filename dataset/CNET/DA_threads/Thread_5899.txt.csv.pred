1.1.1	I have a hard drive out of a Dell Inspiron Mini1012 that has the original O/S (Win7) and all factory info on it (replaced it with a SSD and did a fresh install of Win7).	St
1.1.2	Is it possible to put this drive in a Dell Dimension that I have upgraded with a decent graphics card, sound card, 3gb RAM, new 3.06gb NorthwoodHT processor, and am running Windows 8 Consumer Preview on?	St
1.1.3	I have the original Dell install discs and all.	St
1.1.4	I also have Acronis True Image that I can back-up with.	St
1.1.5	I see that I don't have anything to lose to try, but would like to have some input on proper procedure/technique if possible!	St
1.1.6	I can always put the old drive back in if it doesn't work.	St
1.1.7	Also, I have a IDE to SATA conversion board, so hopefully the new drive will be recognized.	St
1.1.8	I should also mention that I no longer have the Inspiron Mini, which may be an issue if info from it is needed.	St
1.2.1	There is not all the details here but many machines had a SATA port so I'd look for that, use it and skip the adapter.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Would the port be located on the motherboard?	St
1.3.2	It is a 2Y832.	St
1.3.3	I've had this thing apart several times and don't recall seeing a SATA cable, but if I could plug in to the motherboard I'll do that and save the converter for something else.	St
1.3.4	Also, can I use the cable from the old CD player.	St
1.3.5	I believe it is SATA and does'nt work anyway.	St
1.3.6	In doing this, how would I change SETUP?	St
1.4.1	You're asking some pretty basic questions and you should be careful in at least the application of your new found knowledge.	St
1.4.2	Let's be clear, if the HD you plan to install uses the same type of connection from old to new PC, then you simply connect properly.	St
1.4.3	If not and you need some converter, then attach and connect again properly(instruction provided?	St
1.4.4	), etc.. next, if you plan to use the HD &quot;as is&quot; with the current OS present from old PC to new, that's not going to work under typical OS restrictions and it was intended that way.	St
1.4.5	You can possibility reload the OS and have a go at it and see where that gets you.	St
1.4.6	If your version of the OS is non-OEM and some retail/upgrade version, it should work, but full details on that side aren't provided.	St
1.4.7	On top of this, I see Win8 in the mix are you planning to install that on your mix of parts?	St
1.4.8	Overall, it seems you got the items needed to proceed, so as you say, &quot;I don't have anything to lose to try&quot; and as long proper connections, etc.	St
1.4.9	are done you try it all.	St
1.4.10	Alas, if there is call for OS key#(located on sticker), then you need that as well, have access to that?	St
1.4.11	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	I went to google and put in Dimension 4600.	St
1.5.2	The FIRST HIT was the documentation.	St
1.5.3	I clicked on that and saw I/O ports then clicked on that to land at http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4600/en/4600i/sm/specs.htm#1105813 Hmm, RIGHT THERE IT TELLS YOU &quot;Serial ATA two 7-pin connectors&quot; Sorry if this upsets you in any way but you have the connections for new and old drives.	St
1.5.4	There is no issue there.	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	Thank you!	St
1.6.2	I was actually going to research this myself when I get off work.	St
