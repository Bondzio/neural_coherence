<s> I am currently running XP pro sp2. </s>
<s> I currently have 3 hard drives a 20gig(C) 120gig(D) and a 230gig(E) and a multi platform dvd/cd burner. </s>
<s> I know I can only have a total of 4 IDE devices in my rig at any one time...My question is this, I want to remove the 20 gig move all the files to the 120 and make it the new c drive, move everything from the 120 to the 230 making it the d drive, and and move every thing from the 230 to the new 400gig making it the e drive...what would be the best way to accomplish this...PS I do not own ghost, but I do own nero... </s>
<s> Temporarily disconnect the optical drive. </s>
<s> Install the 400GB drive in its place. </s>
<s> Boot to XP and use Disk Management to create one partition on the 400GB HD and format it with NTFS. </s>
<s> Make three folders on the 400GB HD: 20GB_FILES, 120GB_FILES, 230GB_FILES. </s>
<s> Transfer the files from each HD into its corresponding folder on the 400GB HD. </s>
<s> When transferring files from the 20GB HD, just transfer your personal files and settings (as a temporary backup) and not the XP system files and installed programs. </s>
<s> Reinstall XP, all drivers, and all programs onto the 120GB HD. </s>
<s> If you don't want to reinstall everything, download the utility software from the maker of the 120GB HD that allows you to clone the image of the 20GB HD to the 120GB HD. </s>
<s> (Personally, I take these opportunities to wipe the drive clean with DBAN or KILLDISK and then reinstall everything fresh.) </s>
<s> Remove the 20 GB HD and reinstall the optical drive. </s>
<s> Transfer files from the 400GB HD to other drives as desired. </s>
<s> Note that you will want the 120GB HD with XP to be the primary master when you are finished. </s>
