I have Comcast cable and it completely stopped working along with my internet access to my laptop that feeds from my desktop PC's home network. I have the following network configurations: ~Ethernet Cable connected from Cable Modem to desktop PC ~Cable connected from Router to Modem ~DI-614+ Router ~DWL-G510 Airplus G 2.4 GHz Wireless PCI Adapter on Desktop PC ~DWL-650+ 2.4GHz Wireless Cardbus Adapter connected to Laptop PC My M1 and M2 green lights are not lit but the power light is. I believe that Microsoft has installed an automatic update regarding home networking on my PC during this time so this may or may not have been the culprit. I called Comcast Tech Support and they couldn't assist me with the D-Link Router, which is understandable but they did assist me with my internet connection. They instructed me to connect the Ethernet cable from my modem to my desktop PC. This only solved the internet connection problem. I will call D-Link tonight to speak to a live person and have them walk me through the home network set-up again. I've had my D-Link peripherals for 5+ years now. Does anyone think that my equipment is at the end-of-life because it is so old? Thank you all for your support and suggestions on this matter.

For example http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=WGT624NAR&cpc=HPM and even cheaper units are out there with full retail N class units at 99 bucks or less so there is no money in repair and you won't pay any counter to test your unit since for less money you get a new wifi router. Does that help? Bob

I just got off the phone with D-Link and since my router is discontinued and end-of-life there is no technical support available for my router since March 1, 2008. I would come out way cheaper just to purchase a brand new router and call it a day. It's not worth my stress level at his point. I did, however, get my money's worth since it was about 5 years old. Tech support recommended that I upgrade to the WBR-1310 or the WBR-2310 router. I googled these units and both are considered pieces of crap and junk by a lot of the reviewers. I will have to steer clear of these units when shopping for my next D-Link router. Thanks for the advice and the link.

I've been reading reviews on a lot of D-Link products, i.e. Routers and it's a hit and miss type of situation with varying reviews. I just want my PCI card and laptop adapter to be compatible with whatever D-Link router I purchase. I don't have a lot of funds to purchase lots of unneccesary peripherals so I need to keep this very economical and basic. Once again, thanks for your suggestion.
