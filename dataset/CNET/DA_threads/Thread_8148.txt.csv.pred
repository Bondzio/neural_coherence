1.2.1	Go here http://www.crucial.com/ and input the PC specs.	St
1.3.1	first check your motherboard and ensure it will allow you manually enter the SPDs *and* can accomodate 2.1V ram (many only handle 1.8/1.8V).	Sug
1.3.2	if you can't manually enter the SPD timings, you might wind up paying for performance you can't use.	St
1.3.3	you didn't mention price, but both should be about $100 before $35-40 rebates.	St
1.3.4	here's newegg pricing for corsair and ocz 2gb ddr2-800 kits.	St
1.4.1	Hi im not sure how to check those things but my motherboard is an ECS P965T-A motherboard and off there web site all im getting is this http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Products/ProductsDetail.aspx?detailid=681&DetailName=Specification&MenuID=1&LanID=8 So im not sure is they a way of checking in bios Thanks Chris	St
1.5.1	the regular bios for that mobo will not allow you to set memory timings so you should stick with 1.8V ram (which is cheaper than the fast memory you mentioned).	St
1.5.2	newegg choices for 1.8V DDR2-800 ) you can download a revised bios from the ecs site that will allow some memory tweaking, but you could screw up your system if you don't know what you're doing.	St
