Ok so I'm planning on wirelessing the house cause running wires on the stairs and through halls isn't working for me anymore.... But can I just get a wireles router and the adapters for the computers (PCI or USB) and/or labtops and be good to go..or.. do I have to have a WAP in each room where there is a computer as well as that computer having an adapter? Would it be better to have WAPs even though just the adapters will do in terms on signal and speed goes?

A WAP in each room is a bit of overkill unless you are living in Buckingham Palace. Try to centrally locate your router and see who connects from there, you may not need a WAP at all.
