1.1.1	I took a glance at my old motherboard , and I noticed that it has some DDR RAM in it .	St
1.1.2	The pink sticker ( this was a built computer , so the various parts have pink stickers labeling them ) says it 's PC266 32x64 256MB DDR RAM .	St
1.1.3	I was wondering ... could I possibly use this in conjunction with my PC3200 512MB DDR RAM ?	Ques
1.1.4	I checked out the slot with the 256 stick , and it 'd fit in there if I put it in , but I do n't know if it 's compatible with the motherboard , or maybe with the other RAM .	St
1.1.5	Two other things about the 512 stick - it 's Kingston , and it 's 184 pin ( the 256 probably is 184 , too , because it fits ) .	St
1.1.6	My new motherboard is an ASUS K8N motherboard , AMD processor , etc .	St
1.1.7	More info needed , please ask .	Sug
1.1.8	Thanks , -Christopher	St
1.2.1	bus will now only run at the speed of the slower memory [ 133/266 rather than 200/400 .	St
1.2.2	Possibly the 255 stick could be overclocked , but only by a skosh .	St
1.3.1	Just my two cents , but I 'd ditch the 266 in favor of the 512 mb of pc 3200 .	St
1.3.2	512 mb is enough memory for almost any operation in xp .	St
1.3.3	You 'll get better overall performance .	St
1.3.4	If your a gamer , you can add more ram later .	St
1.4.1	Okay , thank you both much ...	Polite
1.4.2	I know that 512 's enough , I was just wondering if it was worth it to use the extra stick of RAM , but I kind of figured that the overall performance would be better without the slower stick , as Stan said , though I knew there 'd be no harm in asking .	St
1.4.3	Thanks again , good day to you all .	St
1.4.4	-Christopher	St
