When I looked at the power button on my tower, it was just flashing and my computer system was not doing anything. I have an 1.1 gig Athlon...Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks

Typically you strip it down to motherboard, CPU/HSF, power supply and a speaker and hope that it beeps. If no beeps then you are looking at the four possible bad parts. Bob
