1.1.2	Distended capacitors I am told .	St
1.1.3	No one knows why .	St
1.1.4	I took out the hd and want to add it to another computer so user can continue work in same disk , HP Vector , pentium 3 with windows xp pro .	St
1.1.5	And so I can learn how to do it .	St
1.1.6	I can add this hd to the HP power supply , but both buses are female , and I ca n't find a way to plug into the master bus and make the this hd a slave .	St
1.1.7	Nor am I sure of any config requirements , drive d etc .	St
1.1.8	If anyone can direct me before I electricute myself or blow up the second computer I would be grateful .	St

1.2.1	Read http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=bad+caps & btnG=Google+Search More at http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague where the cause is revealed .	St

1.3.1	Since you appear clueless , its hard to tell what you want from the HD described as female ?	Ques
1.3.2	Just visit the Western Digital hard drive support website .	St
1.3.3	Look under the IDE HD section and get the & quot ; basic & quot ; info of what appears to be the Gb or Mb size you have in order to become familiar to HDs in general .	St
1.3.4	You need to know master/slave setups or CSEL type , etc .	St
1.3.5	Most HDs have some decal/sticker affixed to them explain what model they are , so go with that , it HAS to be there , otherwise you need to post some pics to allow details to become evident .	St
1.3.6	HP provides some infop as well through thier support website .	St
1.3.7	Check under adding a 2nd to your model # and take it from there as another option .	St
1.3.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
