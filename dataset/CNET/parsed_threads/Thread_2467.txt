<s> Sorry for if this sounds ludicrous but I wanted to troubleshoot as best as possible w/ as little headache as possible. </s>
<s> I just finished building a new PC from scratch. </s>
<s> When I went to plug in my monitor (HP w2207h) I see that the mobo accepts DVI (and HDMI) and the monitor has VGA (and HDMI). </s>
<s> Since there is no VGA to DVI adapter, I am thinking I may need a new monitor (which is fine, if this is the case). </s>
<s> I tried to use the HDMI but the monitor says that is does not detect the HDMI input and goes to sleep. </s>
<s> Does something else need to be installed, perhaps? </s>
<s> I need a screen so I can access the BIOS and later install my OS but, as of now, I can not get my current monitor to work with the new build. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
<s> Like I said, this sounds ridiculous and I feel stupid typing it but I'll take the heat. </s>
<s> If I have to purchase a new monitor, is there anything in particular that I should look for so that the monitor &quot;works&quot; without installing software, etc. </s>
<s> since this is a new build? </s>
<s> Thanks for any feedback that can be offered. </s>
<s> Trying to troubleshoot w/, as I said earlier, as few headaches as possible. </s>
<s> more than 1 HDMI input on the monitor? </s>
<s> Mine has 2 , if I select the wrong input I get the same results your'e getting.. </s>
<s> port on the monitor. </s>
<s> Use the OSD setting of the monitor to select or default to HDMI, instead of SVGA if that is the method of setting for use. </s>
<s> be sure if required to save that setting as well. </s>
<s> Make sure by reviewing the manual for your monitor but a quick check of the OSD should be enough. </s>
<s> The same applies to your PC, it may need to know where to output the video stream to that device. </s>
<s> I checked manual on page 3-8, the HDMI supposely works as an output from an HDMI device like a player, so it may not work as direct HDMI-to-HDMI but still the setting might be the fix regardless. </s>
<s> the manual does offer an adapter should work. </s>
