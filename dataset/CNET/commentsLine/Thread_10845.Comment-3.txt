i'll write that what you are asking for is ancient tech.
also i've never found any bios &quot;detect&quot; that the second floppy drive was added.
&quot;the bios only recognizes one floppy drive even though the motherboard has a standard floppy controller.&quot; true for 100% of the machines i've used (some 1000s now).
instead i have to tell the bios that drive b is the 3.5 or what type i added.
also a fading memory is what cable to use, where the twist goes and in very rare cases what to set the jumper to.
find someone that mumbles about dos and have grey or no hair left to help you out.
-&gt; adding a pci floppy card is a bad idea.
