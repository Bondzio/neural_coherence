<s> if my motherboard has a pcie x16 can a put a pcie video card in that slot that is not x16? </s>
<s> card that is not X16??? </s>
<s> There are X1, X4, X8, slots on some mobos, likely only an X1 on yours. </s>
<s> I hope that you are not confusing PCI X with the old 33 MHz PCI bus. </s>
<s> No not confusing them at all, just want to know in the even a card i get is not 16x will it still work in a 16x slot? </s>
<s> are different for each the X1, X4, X8, and X16. </s>
<s> The difference is the number of serial busses they have in parallel, but not sure how the power connections are made. </s>
<s> But I doubt that an X1 would work in an X16 slot. </s>
<s> However, there is a X1 video card made by Matrox. </s>
