1.1.1	Ok guys, I am currently in the process of building a new desktop computer case with Kikboxes Mod Nation.	St
1.1.2	The theme is a Nuclear!!!	St
1.1.3	lol.	St
1.1.4	I need some creative minds and possibly artists to help me do the finishing designs on the computer.	St
1.1.5	The case they have already made that I will be modeling after can be viewed Here ----&gt; http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=425947408&albumID=836385&imageID=8352504 My main detailed theme is a nuclear missile launch silo, one that has been through some fall-out and been abandoned for years.	St
1.1.6	From the case above, I will be taking the acid was finish; and a modded front fan grill.	St
1.1.7	Changed: 1.	St
1.1.8	The red acid wash, will be replaced with a dark green acid wash. 2.	St
1.1.9	The fan grill, will be a chrome mushroom cloud with yellow/red light behind it.	St
1.1.10	There will be a glass panel on the left side, and most of the airbrushed designs will be visible on the right.	St
1.1.11	Ideas: Replace the on off button with a red &quot;launch&quot; button, with a flip up glass cover over it.	St
1.1.12	A &quot;bolted on&quot; sign on the right; the sign will say something like &quot;launch silo&quot; or &quot;caution!	St
1.1.13	radiation zone&quot; something like that.	St
1.1.14	Place nuclear hazard symbols over the top right and bottom left corners of the glass panel.	St
1.1.15	I am thinking about either a acid drip over the top and back panels to make it look as if the thing has been aging for years.	St
1.1.16	&lt;b&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where you come in&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/b&gt; I really need new ideas for this case.	St
1.1.17	My uncreative mind cannot think of anything else to add to the cases design.	St
1.1.18	The case REALLY needs a name, so please pitch me some cool name ideas that can be airbrushed into the side somewhere.	St
1.1.19	I also need some possible designs drawn, &lt;b&gt;If I use your design, you will get payed for permission to use the artwork.&lt;/b&gt; Price is really no object here, so pretend its totally free no matter what.	St
1.1.20	Please let me know ANY and ALL ideas/designs you have; all are much appreciated.	Sug
1.1.21	THANKS!	St
1.1.22	!	St
1.2.1	Any help is appreciated!	St
