thanks for your reply.
i will try the  you suggested.
basically this is the problem in an easy explanation.
on the mp3mymp3 window it states that for recording &quot;logitech microphone&quot; is being used to record.
however when i am recording, all noises near to the microphone are also being recorded such as a cough or anything else.
i hope this is a little clearer as i do like the mp3mymp3 software.
please let me know if you have any ideas.
appreciated.
