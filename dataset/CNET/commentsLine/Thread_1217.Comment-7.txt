hi bob, my main os is run off a sata hd and the external is also a sata drive, so when i placed the external into the pc there were two sata drives present only, therefore as far as i know there are no cable settings etc to worry about - the only thing to be done it turn the drive to auto in the bios settings - which i did (the drive was read by the bios as a hard drive type with 0 capacity i.e.
it was not reading the hd correctly - then on bootup it gave the error described above before it would automatically reset) thanks for all your help, ger.
