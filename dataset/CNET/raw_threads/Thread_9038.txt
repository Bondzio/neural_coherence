Personally I could care less about Microsoft's implementation of DRM in every orifice of my computer, as long as it doesn't cause more major problems than Windows normally does. However, if I'm forced to upgrade more than my graphics card to run it, I'm gonna be one really unhappy camper. John

Proffitt	8/7/05 7:31 AM	1.12339986E12	It's called... &quot;Plugging the analog hole&quot;	The move to HDTV and other all digital connections is to plug what the recording industry calls 'plugging the analog hole.' To be effective all analog signals have to be designed out and the OS revamped as well to disallow programs that can record content. This is not me agreeing with such, but just stating what I'm hearing in the various seminars and conferences I'm attending. I wouldn't worry too much, the genie is out of the bottle so there's not any known method of putting it back in. Bob

A DRM monitor is just a monitor with a DRM chip embedded in it.
