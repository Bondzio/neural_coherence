i like hp.
love the technology, always reliable (at least in my experience), but their so-called &quot;tech support&quot; sucks, ever since outsourcing to india.
i've had hp's for many years, and i loved when i had a problem and called the &quot;american-based&quot; tech support...they always helped me resolve whatever it was ailing my pc, but no more, i can't stand talking to an indian as most of my calls have been so frustrating.
i usually can't understand their &quot;english&quot; or they don't know jack about my problem(s), so i gave up calling a long time ago and usually either resolve it myself or thru someone on the net.
otherwise, i have no problem with hp's technology.
there, i said it, that's my vote.
