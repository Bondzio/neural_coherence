My home and work computers both run Windows XP Home Edition and both are connected to the internet via ADSL broadband. I want to network my 2 computers through the internet. I understand that VPN is usually the way to do this, but does XP Home Edition have the facilities to act as a server? So far I have been unsuccessful at trying to set it up through Windows Network Connections. Or do I need a different software programme. Surely there is a very simple way of networking these 2 computers through the internet? Am I just too dumb to do it?
