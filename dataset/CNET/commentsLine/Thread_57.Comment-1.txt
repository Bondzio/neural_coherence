i have physical access to a network printer working fine on a network but when i add my notebook to a cat5 connection and try to find the printer it cant.
when i check other workstations control panel printer is &quot;ibm 1145 on myserver01&quot; and i even have a printer name (&quot;lxk485dc8&quot;) and an ip address but nothing helps find it in the printer find window after selecting the server name to find.
other info states i need to specify (e.g.
&quot;server.host1.printer/lxk485dc8&quot;) but that doesnt work either.
i also try searching under the share name &quot;ibm1145&quot; and that doesnt work.
again, i have printed the printers network configuration info.
and have access to printer setup gui from the notebook but dont know how else to setup.
