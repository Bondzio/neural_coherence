michael, thanks - the motherboard has the two ide channels printed on the mob as 1 and 2 so that is what i am using for explanation.
i did try booting with the hard drive on each channel with nothing on the other and encountered the same problems.
i have an email and a call in to the vendor.
thanks for your help.
