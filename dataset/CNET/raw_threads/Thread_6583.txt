Now I would like to share the ADSL with 2 more computers, but my ethernet port is taken by the modem. Question is: Can I install a second ethernet card in my machine, and connect the two other computers with a crossover cable (via a US Robotics Broadband Router) If the answer is Yes, please specify what Ethernet Card is needed. Your advice will be cert much appreciated Regards Leo

10201	5	211094	2250997	2250176	leolmtak	10/8/06 5:30 AM	1.1602854E12	to kwkid	kwkid sorry to confuse you. Let me try to explain: My old PC was connected with an Alcatel Speedtouch USB. I had my ethernet card free to connect to 2 other computers. I had a crossover cable running from my PC to a US Robotics Broadband Router placed in another room 20 yards away. From there 2 straight cables were connected to the other 2 computers. This setup worked fine. When needed I also could unplug the crosscable from my machine to connect a laptop. In the current situation my ISP connected my new PC with a Copperjet 810 LAN connection. (The technician informed me that they were replacing all Alcatels with Copperjets) Fine, but now my ethernet port needed for my network is taken. So all I want now is a free ethernet port to continue with what I was doing before. I was not sure if a second ethernet card would do the job, so I posted in the forum to hear from the experts. I hope You ain't confused anymore. I appreciate your help. Regards Leo

You don't need more.	http://www.csolutions.net/cdsl/pdf/InstallationManual.pdf#search=%22Copperjet%20810%20LAN%20connection%22 I see you only need to plug the other machine into the copperjet. No extra card is required. Unless there is something you are doing that you didn't share, you are good to go. Bob

10201	9	211094	2251236	2251185	leolmtak	10/8/06 8:03 AM	1.16029458E12	Given the new ports on the router, why not use those?	Because the cables and the router from the old setting are allready installed. Please take notice that the router is not in my room, so if I need to connect a laptop (any laptop from friends who drop in) to my PC, I will need a port. I thought that a second ethernet card would solve my problem, but I wasn't sure, that's the reason for my visit to this forum. So please tell me if my proposed setup will work. I appreciate to learn better methods. so I may consider those for future use. Bob thank you for responding Leo

Since you have to buy another ethernet card why not just use a small switched hub this time? Certainly a lot easier than slugging it out with ICS. Bob

The 2 network card setup while possible can be hours or weeks to get working (depending on skill and luck) where the switched hub should just plug and play. Sorry I didn't find the smaller one but you seem to catch one quick and nail this issue fast. Best of continued (self made) luck, Bob
