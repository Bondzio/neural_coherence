Therefore I do not want to purchase all the color cartridges. However, even with a full black cartridge I cannot print. This is true if the color slots are empty or filled with spent cartridges. In both cases the status monitor displays &quot;Printer is not ready to print&quot;. My question: Is there any way to tell the 1400 to print with the just the black cartridge installed? Thanks, Eliot
