<s> I need some help but please be gentle as I have NO tech knowledge whatsoever! </s>
<s> I have just bought my first laptop and set it up for wireless internet access. </s>
<s> It's not based at my house so my connection is purely mobile (at my workplace) I work at an airport which is wi-fi hotspot for the provider I'm signed up with but it seems my actual office is that little bit too far from the main terminal (which I assume would be the strongest point) for a decent signal. </s>
<s> I get a sporadic signal (usually about 1 bar strength at its best) it appears and disappears at will! </s>
<s> I've heard varying things from people but could someone help me by clarifying exactly whether its possible to buy some kind of signal booster? </s>
<s> My laptop is a TOSHIBA EQUIUM A200-1VO and the specs are... Intel Pentium Dual Core Processor T2310 (1.46 GHz, 533 MHz FSB, 1 MB Cache) Windows Vista ....if thats of any help. </s>
<s> Any advice would be hugely appreciated. </s>
<s> If you're paying them....or someone's paying them on the premise that the service is available to employees where you work then they should fix this. </s>
<s> It can be done by using repeaters that will extend the signal range to those who are expected to be able to use it. </s>
<s> Here's a link for both. </s>
