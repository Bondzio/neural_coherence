I have a Gigabyte 7VM400M-rz motherboard, AMD Sempron 2400, 256mb of RAM and im running XP pro.
Im currently using the onboard video that is sharing 32mb of my RAM.
I just purchased 1gig of extra RAM and an APG 8x video card that is to be installed this week.
I was just wondering the benefit I would get, if any, of overclocking.
In my CMOS the clock speed is set @ 166mhz.
Is this where I would overclock it?
If so how much would be &quot;safe&quot;?
