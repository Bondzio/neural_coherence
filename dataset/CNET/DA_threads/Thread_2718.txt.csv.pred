1.1.1	I have an ASUS P4P800-VM Micro ATX mainboard with 4 rear panel USB 2.0 and two internal USB 2.0 headers .	St
1.1.2	I have a USB 2.0 all in one card reader ( 3.5 floppy , SD , SM , CF , etc ... ) connected to one of the internal headers and an additional two ports on the front of the case connected to the other internal header .	St
1.1.3	I keep getting a balloon popping out of the toolbar ( WIN XP ) saying the device can perform faster , when I click on the balloon it gives me a list of available 2.0 ports but does not identify the component that & quot ; can perform faster & quot ; I suspect it is the media reader .	St
1.1.4	Why is this happening when there is no 1.1 USB anywhere on my system ?	Ques
1.1.5	How can I identify the component that needs to perform faster ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Maybe the usb2 driver need to be install .	St
1.2.2	Take a look at the & quot ; device manager & quot ; ; are the ports are all & quot ; enhanced USB & quot ; ( it should be ) ?	Ques
1.3.1	I encountered this in the PC my wife uses ( also an ASUS P4P800 series ) .	St
1.3.2	One thing you do need to be sure of is that , if using front panel ports or others with cables connected to the MB , that connection hardware needs to USB2 capable or speed will scale back .	St
1.3.3	Anyway , go to your hardware list and remove all the USB devices , root hubs , etc .	St
1.3.4	Shut down/restart and let XP ( make sure you have SP2 ) redetect them .	St
1.3.5	Windows should load the USB2 drivers this time .	St
1.3.6	It worked for me .	St
1.4.1	Steve , How do you ensure SP2 is redirecting the device , other than being at SP2 level on XP .	St
