<s> Hey everyone. </s>
<s> Here's the deal. </s>
<s> I have a 500gb WD Passport Essential. </s>
<s> I had formatted it to NTFS right when I got it. </s>
<s> It works fine with my Vista laptop. </s>
<s> But I now wish I could use it with more. </s>
<s> I'd like to be able to connect it to my PS3 and 360 to get media off of it, and I use Windows and Mac both very much on a daily basis, so I think I'd like to convert to FAT32, but before I do, I'd like to ask if this is a good idea. </s>
<s> I've heard things that FAT32 doesn't accept files more than 4 gigs? </s>
<s> Also, if I do go through with this, how would I convert it? </s>
<s> When I go to the format section of explorer, the only options are NTFS and exFAT. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>
<s> Only way is to copy files off, reformat then restore files. </s>
<s> Might want to rethink FAT32. </s>
<s> With all the gadgets you're planning to connect to, someday you'll crash the disk and lose all. </s>
<s> Get a flash to move your files around. </s>
<s> I know I'd have to reformat, so that's not a problem. </s>
<s> Also, I already have a flash drive, but I would prefer the convience of just keeping everything on the one hard drive. </s>
<s> Is FAT32 that bad? </s>
<s> I mean, it's the default format of the drive. </s>
