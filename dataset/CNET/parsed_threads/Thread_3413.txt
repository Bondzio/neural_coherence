<s> I have a server (old PC I used) with a Asus P4G8X Deluxe motherboard and a Geforce 6800 Ultra (Asus V9999) video card on it. </s>
<s> The system uses liquid cooling. </s>
<s> I decided to get the tower back up and running for various purposes, but that story aside, I have a problem. </s>
<s> Two to three drops of coolant leaked (which is fixed) and somehow managed to land on the AGP card right at the AGP slot. </s>
<s> After not running for a large amount of time, these drops solidified (for some reason). </s>
<s> Recent reuse made it hot, and the contacts on the AGP slot (about 3 of them from what I can tell) melted. </s>
<s> This also caused burn damage on 2 of the contacts on the AGP card itself. </s>
<s> The AGP card still works in another AGP board. </s>
<s> My concern is, will these two blackened marks (partially covering contacts) cause the contacts/AGP slot of another board to overheat/melt? </s>
<s> Thanks, guys.... </s>

<s> Thanks, guys.... http://www.darkfalls.net/damagezoom3.jpg This shows the damage. </s>
<s> A single contact is melted upwards. </s>
<s> Any information would be helpful. </s>
<s> I'm primarily concerned that it might cause damage to a new motherboard. </s>
<s> I apologize about double pasting my statement- I don't know how I did that. </s>
<s> That'll teach me to preview posts in the future. </s>
<s> You have to ***** the risk in re-using the AGP slot and system in general. </s>
<s> Do you want to take a chance with known contact problem provided you did a fix? </s>
<s> It really comes down, is it worth it to you. </s>
<s> If yes, go forth knowing you're attempting a restart after your fix. </s>
<s> -OR- don't and try fresh with another mtrbd. </s>
<s> and/or system. </s>

<s> I'm with Willy on this -- If this machine were a client's/customer's, you'd not even hestitate to say it's time to scrap the main board. </s>
<s> Even if it were your employer's, your hourly wage is worth more than the board is. </s>
<s> In the photo, it's obviously a mess. </s>
<s> The card is reasonably nice, was once quite nice, in terms of computing power. </s>
<s> But the mobo isn't. </s>
<s> Finding a replacement local could be tough, but if you gooogle or ebay, the price for an AGP board isn't much more than what you'd pay for shipping it. </s>
<s> I've gotten a new motherboard, but I'm concerned the damage on the video card may damage the agp slot on the new board. </s>
<s> Any idea if that would occur? </s>
<s> The AGP card does obviously have issues. </s>
<s> It runs stable (For whatever reason) in a board, I'm just concerned of possible overheating/further damage being caused by the card. </s>
<s> THe original damage was caused by the board. </s>
<s> Maybe this is the excuse you need for new mtrbd. </s>
<s> or old yet new tech such as PCI-e or 16x plus whatever step-up on that mtrbd. </s>
<s> For the money and effort, you'll be leaps ahead and you can try newer stuff. </s>
<s> Sometimes, its worth it to leave well enough alone and step forward. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> The card in the pic looked pretty icky, I assume you cleaned it up and polished the contacts. </s>
<s> If it's working, I'd go for it, if it were mine. </s>
<s> Seems like really the only risk (now you know it's working) is increased risk of corrosion. </s>
<s> But if you eek out another year's service from that guy, it's a win, eh. </s>
