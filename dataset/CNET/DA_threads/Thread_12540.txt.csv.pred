1.1.1	Ok boys and girls , I have a few questions .	St
1.1.2	I have a dimension 4700 and I 'm thinking about a few upgrades .	St
1.1.3	First , I 'll tell you what and how I have it running .	St
1.1.4	Here are my specs : 4700 RAM : 2 x 512 433Mhz DDR2 interrogated video Intel Pentium IV 3.4 HT 140 gb HD Running Vista Enterprise ( same as Ultimate , minus Media Center ) I tried to max it out as best as possible when I bought it .	St
1.1.5	Now as to what I want to put in it .	St
1.1.6	I 'm planning on adding 2 extra gigs of ram 2 X 1gb .	St
1.1.7	Here is the URL for the product .	St
1.1.8	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820134046 Now I do n't think I will have a problem .	St
1.1.9	They match specs with the exception that this runs at 533 and the ram in the system is running at 400-something .	St
1.1.10	From what I understand , it 'll just run at the slower speed , right ?	Ques
1.1.11	Now a graphics card is needed .	St
1.1.12	This is the one I had in mind .	St
1.1.13	http : //www.buy.com/prod/XFX_GeForce_7600GS_256MB_PCI_Express_x16_Video_Card_Dual_DVI_S_Video/q/loc/61905/203000306.html Again , I have the PCIe card , so there should n't be a problem .	St
1.1.14	My only concern is my 305watt power supply .	St
1.1.15	I do n't use all the features with the computer ( all 6 USB ports ) and things like that , so I 'm not too worried .	St
1.1.16	So at the end I 'm hoping to have these specs Dell 4700 RAM : 3 gb 2 x 1 gig and 2 x 512 Video : Geforce 7600GS 256 MB Pentium IV 3.4 Does that sound like a mean system or what ? ?	Ques
1.1.17	What you you all think ?	Ques
1.1.18	Will I have issues with those parts ?	Ques
1.1.19	Anything I should know ?	Ques
1.1.20	Should I pull out the 512mb ram cards and leave it with 2 x 1gb or will it be fine with all four dimms taken ?	Ques
1.1.21	Thanks for all the advice .	St
1.1.22	JF	St
1.2.1	your ram choice is fine as long it supports ddr2-533 , but you need to determine what your current ram is running at .	St
1.2.2	( cpu-z can figure it out for you . )	St
1.2.3	the dell comes with ddr2-400 or ddr2-533 , not ddr2-433 ( which does n't exist ) .	St
1.2.4	personally , if you 're running ddr2-400 , i 'd dump the existing ram and use all ddr2-533 .	St
1.2.5	as for the graphics card , what do you plan to use the pc for ?	Ques
1.2.6	the 7600gs is an entry-level 3d card , can play some games , and will work fine with your 300w power supply .	St
1.2.7	this evga 7600gs is a better buy at $ 85 before $ 20 rebate .	St
1.2.8	if you do n't plan on playing an games and do n't like rebates , this evga 7300gt is $ 66 straight up .	St
1.3.1	Get what your mobo support .	St
1.3.2	Some memory can be touchy .	St
1.3.3	You can buy 433Mhz DDR2 in 1GB sticks .	St
1.3.4	Good choice to max it out .	St
1.3.5	Your Video card choice is also a good upgrade , especially at 256 .	St
1.3.6	Some will argue for ATI .	St
1.3.7	Consider a good replacement P/S if the Dell shows any age/wear but their supplies are better than the watts shown .	St
1.3.8	But a really good supply is a positive upgrade to consider .	St
1.3.9	Past that a new Mobo and a Core Duo would be next and what you buy now will be usable .	St
1.4.1	I 'm pretty sure it 's ddr2-400 .	St
1.4.2	I bought it over two years ago .	St
1.4.3	As for what I use the PC for , I usually use it for school work and some games .	St
1.4.4	I used to play America 's Army , before it got too intense for the integrated video .	St
1.4.5	Same thing with War Rock .	St
1.4.6	I 'm really looking for something that I can play some games and have enough .	St
1.4.7	Oh and get out of vista basic hell !	St
1.4.8	I have a laptop that has a GeForce 6150 .	St
1.4.9	That has actually made it like night and day when switching back and forth .	St
1.4.10	So I 'm hoping a 7600 will be even better .	St
1.5.1	Dell Dimension 4700 : http : //support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4700/sm/specs.htm # wp1043338 Crucial.com says : http : //www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx ? model=Dimension+4700+Series	Ques
1.6.1	evga cards are good overclockers so you can get more performance easily if you wish .	St
1.6.2	this evga 7600gt is another option for $ 110 before $ 20 rebate .	St
1.6.3	a 350w power supply is recommended but i 've seen folks use in dells without any issue .	St
1.6.4	anything faster than a 7600gt will require a new power supply though .	St
