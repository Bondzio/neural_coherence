Hello, Currently I have DSL in my room for purposes such as using it for my computer and my Xbox 360. However, my parents finally decided that they would like to create a network with my dsl, but the dsl is too slow when used with one object and another at the same time. So, we've decided to pick up with cable, which means I will have to end my subscription with verizon dsl and begin with RoadRunner (timewarner). I heard that cable is much faster then dsl which is a good thing, But when one of the guys came over to install basically (set up the modem on my moms computer, I asked him a few questions; because I wanted to know what I needed to look for. Regardless, he told me that you can't set up a wired network with the cable. Is this true? Second, he told me that I would have to go wireless, which means that its proabbly going to cost a lot more then if I go wired. (Having to add an additonal $80+ for a xbox 360 network adapter) My main question is that is there anyone with cable that uses a router that is directly connected to all your devices? Thanks for the time.

One of the first things I did was get a D-link wireless router. It has four ports for wired and can handle 11 wireless connections (one for each channel).
