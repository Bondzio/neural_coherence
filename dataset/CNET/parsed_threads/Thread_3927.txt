<s> Has anyone installed a distro of Linux onto a Mac before. </s>
<s> Can you do so? </s>
<s> If possible do you need boot camp or can you install a dual boot config similar to a pc? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/ is the only item I've seen do this. </s>
<s> As I wrote in another response, no one I know installs Linux on the Intel based Mac due to MacOSX already being UNIX based. </s>
<s> Given that and X11 being available, any app can be run natively that needs to be so the need for Linux is subdued. </s>
<s> &quot;Strong OS Support: A sophisticated virtual machine engine that offers the broadest support of x86-based operating systems, including: * The entire Windows family - 3.1, 3.11, 95, 98, Me, 2000, XP and 2003 * Linux distributions from popular distributors like Red Hat, SuSE, Mandriva, Debian and Fedora Core * FreeBSD * Legacy operating systems like OS/2, eComStation and MS-DOS.&quot; </s>
<s> If so I would like to ask you a few questions. </s>
<s> You see I have an oppurtunity where I'm looking to purchase a Macbook. </s>
<s> I have been a Windows person my enitre life, and I'm about as close as you can get to being certified by Microsoft without actually being certified. </s>
<s> However for the past few years Apple and it's products have really impressed me, and I am very curious to see what their products are all about. </s>
<s> I would never give up Windows this is for sure. </s>
<s> But I would like to explore Mac, however I am a little concerned about making the change, even though it is only from a laptop standpoint. </s>
<s> If you do have a Mac PC, first off do you like the PC? </s>
<s> Is it better or equal to Windows? </s>
<s> Does it have all the finctionality that Windows offer? </s>
<s> Is it a quality laptop for an IT person like myself? </s>
<s> Again I know these are questions I can research however I would like to get an opinion from an actual user, not to mention when researching you get locked into the battle between Windows and Mac. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> We try things on it. </s>
<s> It's not my main machine. </s>
<s> With the new OS coming out and COHERENCE there is a chance I'd refresh my laptop this year and that will be it. </s>
<s> I'd seen you pose similar questions many times. </s>
<s> Can we bring it down to some question you really wanted to ask? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
