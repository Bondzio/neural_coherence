It's why I just get it from Crucial for many machines.
I have XP on a few machines with 512MB and a few with 1GB.
One XP machine has 2GB but I can't say it's any faster as to computations due to the RAM.
Bob PS.
I have a simple, cheap dv6910us that I run VS2008 on.
I have this CRC routine that does some 4 billion CRCs in a little over 3 minutes.
I'm impressed.
