in real world testing.
consumer base wireless is a lot less than its spec.
i've tested some linksys and netgear wireless routers.
802.11b mode goes anywhere between 3-6mbps and 802.11g mode goes anywhere between 7-9mbps.
the &quot;rest&quot; of the bandwidth are overhead for wireless transmission.
100mbps switch goes around 80mbps with overhead.
