I currently share an office with another company and want to restrict them from seeing my computers. I have 3 machines all running XP. I have a linksys wireless router that all three are connected to. I have an connection from the internet going to the correct port on the router. I only want two of the three machines to have internet access but I would like all three machines on the intranet because they all share files. How can I configure my machines and router to accomplish this task?

If so, after all your PCs are set up and running wireless, turn off SSID on the router. Make sure you are running WPA/2 for encryption. SSID broadcasts its presence to all PCs. When you turn it off, only PCs that have been identified and logged in will see it. Yes, this can be overcome by specific software that sniffs out signals. But hopefully the other business is more professional.

But the one additional question I have is I do NOT want one particular computer on my network to access the Internet, but I do want it to be able to communicate with other computers and network printers. How would I do this? Setup ip's on router? I'm not certain. Thanks to anyone who can help.

Proffitt	11/17/09 8:21 AM	1.25844606E12	For example.	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=linksys+router+setup+block+ports finds how to block ports on your common linksys router. Sorry that I can't offer a STEP BY STEP but what you want to do is two steps. 1. Use DHCP RESERVATION so that machine always gets a specific IP assigned. 2. With that IP noted we use the articles above to block PORT 80 (example) to that one IP entry. Blam. No more Web browsing for them. Now block more ports as needed. Bob
