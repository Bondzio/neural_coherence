one thing else to keep in mind, is that all of the new graphic cards require a 300watt minimum power supply.
all of the hp's and gateways that i have looked at have a 250watt power supply, so a power supply upgrade may be in order.
then of course you have to consider the motherboard to see if it can handle a higher power supply.
