1.1.1	I'm trying to wirelessly connect an XBOX 360 and Panasonic TV with Viera Cast to a network.	St
1.1.2	Right now I only have a cable modem with my desktop connected to it through ethernet cable.	St
1.1.3	My idea is to plug a wireless router to the cable modem and the desktop to the router again via ethernet cable.	St
1.1.4	In another room I would set up a wireless access point and connect the TV and XBOX to its ethernet ports via cable again.	St
1.1.5	My confusion is, do I need to connect a second access point to the wireless router to enable communication between the two or can the access point (with TV and XBOX) talk directly with the wireless router?	St
1.1.6	Also, can the TV and XBOX access the internet at the same time using this set up?	St
1.1.7	Thanks for any input.	St
1.1.8	I would also appreciate any suggestions for specific equipment to accomplish the described scenario.	Polite
1.2.1	It's very close to what you describe.	St
1.3.1	There are ways to do what you are trying to do that might be easier.	St
1.3.2	Go to Linksys web site and look at some of their hardware, specifically gaming adapter hookups hardwire and wireless and see what you think.	St
1.3.3	Good luck and have fun!	Polite
