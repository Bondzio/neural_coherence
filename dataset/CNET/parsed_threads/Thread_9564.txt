<s> I have dual displays on my PC and would like to add a third and I'm seeking advice on what I need hardware wise. </s>
<s> I have the monitors. </s>
<s> I just need an appropriate video card (i.e. </s>
<s> a second video card). </s>
<s> I DON'T want to spend much money on this. </s>
<s> Here are my specs: -I'm running 64-bit Vista, to be upgraded to 64-bit win7 shortly. </s>
<s> It's a Dell Studio XPS Core i7 PC. </s>
<s> -I believe this is my motherboard: http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/435MT/en/SM/techov.htm -My current video card is an ATI Radeon HD 3450. </s>
<s> It handles two displays fine. </s>
<s> -Ideally I would have DVI and VGA connected monitors to this video card (1920x1080 and 1680x1050) I would like add a third monitor, which I have already, 1600x900. </s>
<s> From what I understand, I can do this by adding a second video card. </s>
<s> But I don't know what to buy. </s>
<s> I know an internal video card has to be compatible and can't go beyond what my motherboard and PSU can take. </s>
<s> But I know there are also external USB video cards and I'm wondering if one of those would be the way to go. </s>
<s> I'm not into gaming, but I do video editing. </s>
<s> The ATI card works fine for such purposes. </s>
<s> So my third display will be used for work - displaying documents, web browsing, etc. </s>
<s> I would have no problem unplugging the USB attached monitor during video editing if need be. </s>
<s> So I want a cheap solution that will allow for a third display, one that will support the resolution and give a decent picture and not impact the quality of the other two displays. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> You could fret about the compatibility (I don't) or move forward. </s>
<s> That is, I can't assuage fears here but if I wanted another display as you noted I'd get a PCIe x1 video card (newegg and amazon have them) then pop it in then install the drivers. </s>
<s> Or I'd look at the Sewell USB video solutions. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My radeon graphics card also has an HDMI port. </s>
<s> So it has DVI HDMI and VGA. </s>
<s> Does that mean it can support 3 monitors? </s>
<s> I've yet to see one that allows all three to be used like you wanted. </s>
<s> Can you give me an example of a PCIe x1 card I could buy? </s>
<s> I'm not sure what PCIe x1 means exactly. </s>
<s> I'm assuming that it has something to do with the fact that there is only one slot on my motherboard that is the specs that fit my current graphics card? </s>
<s> Here's the 5450 on newegg. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814161354 The PCIe x1 is what those slots on the motherboard are. </s>
<s> If I were to bet, the x16 slot is in use but I can't tell from the post so far. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If you look at my motherboard in the above link it's the one plugged into slot #25. </s>
<s> So the one you're recommending would be plugged into slot # 27 or 28, right? </s>
<s> And they'd both be in use simultaneously? </s>
<s> Just to follow up: -I'd rather spend less money. </s>
<s> What's the cheapest one I could get that would work on my system with a 1600x900 monitor? </s>
<s> -second, will my PSU have enough juice to support 3 displays? </s>
<s> I think you can figure out that. </s>
<s> As to cheapest, you go shopping. </s>
<s> I only go as far as this then you get to do the work. </s>
<s> Sorry if that upsets anyone but this is all volunteer and I only go so far. </s>
<s> The juice issue is a good question and why I picked this card. </s>
<s> So you don't have a juice issue (unless there is more added to the machine that we know about.) </s>
<s> Bob. </s>
