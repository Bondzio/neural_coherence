I need to auto power on the pc and to controll the bios to change the time to power on the pc remotely. (I find that to auto power on the pc is there a config called Power on by RTC Alarm and so I needto config this maybe with a system like this -&gt; http://www.delltechcenter.com/page/Dell+Client+Configuration+Utility+3.0 ) What others people suggest to me is to buy 1 pc with 2 video cards that support 1080x1920 resolution or to buy 3 mini pc and connect one with the modem and share the connection to the other 2 but for the other needs that I have I do not found someone that suggest me something good for all. Can you provide me a solution for my needs? Thanks in advance!

Since we know the web browsers do this, we don't have to discuss the software end. Sorry I can't provide a solution. But you can buy it and it should be fine. Bob
