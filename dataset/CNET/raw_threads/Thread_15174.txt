All drivers were reinstalled successfully and system properties show that dvd is running correctly but it remains the same. Any kind of disc is recognized. My operating system is Windows Me. Thanks

Drivers are properly reinstalled, and the last time it works was a few months ago... Something curious is that dvd is recognized by system, however it remains bad.
