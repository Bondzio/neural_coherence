A documentation error on another motherboard showed the drive LED to some jumper but it was marked on the board as reset. 1/2 the time the board would not boot. Lesson? You don't need all those connections when troubleshooting. Finally one owner spent weeks on this and the power button had failed. We used a pen tip on the pwron contacts and it started up. Lesson? Don't trust such to work. Finally some new builders don't plug the cards in firmly. Bob

Verify all marking and waht they do and properly routed to thier setting/connection. Recheck the mnaual and all that, then power-UP. If it fails, retry again to see what is wrong. Verify nothing is grounded on the mtrbd. backside, etc.. tada -----Willy :
