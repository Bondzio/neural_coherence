i have a few questions about netbooks.
i want to buy one in a few days and am a bit confused about there power.
can someone answer these questions.
this is the netbook i was thinking about getting (  ).
1. can we put more ram into it?
2. can it play divx movies and tv shows?
3. there is one game that i want it to play.
it's an old game but i'm not sure if it has the power to play it.
it is called fitness yourself and can be found at  .
if you look at the requirements they are for very old computers.
that's why i am hoping i can run it.
my plan is to hook up to a monitor and do all of the above.
is this possible or am i expecting too much out of a netbook?
