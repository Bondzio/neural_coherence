Good day, I Have the following, eMachines T6524 AMD Athlon 64 3500+ 2.2GHz / 1GB DDR / 200GB HDD / Dual Layer DVDRW/ Integrated ATI Radeon Xpress 200 / Flash Media Reader / Windows XP Media Center 2005.
I have looked at the ATI web site and am confusied as to what would be the best next step up on the graphics card.
I have 1 gig of memory and a 200 gig hard drive..
There seems to be many choices just not sure which one would be best.
Thanks in advance for your reply
