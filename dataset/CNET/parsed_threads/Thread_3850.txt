<s> Why does my desktop computer (Windows Millennium ME)performance start up at only 45-50% when I have 896 MB of memory, even when I haven't logged onto the Internet? </s>
<s> Why does the defrag process stall on the c:drive? </s>
<s> It can't get past 10% complete. </s>
<s> I ran spyware and I have current Norton Internet/Antivirus security. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help you can give me! </s>
<s> There are some bugs in Windows ME memory management that causes &quot;issues&quot; when its run on machines with &quot;large amounts&quot; of RAM. </s>
<s> Microsoft documented this and you should read about such at http://support.microsoft.com No patch was supplied but a workaround to tell ME to keep itself to 512MB. </s>
<s> The defrag issue is noted in the Windows ME forum in a note I keep on the first page. </s>
<s> Here's an article about Windows ME memory -&gt; http://aumha.org/win4/a/memmgmt.php Bob </s>
<s> Since Windows ME is well past 4 years old, why are you asking now about this? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your prompt reply. </s>
<s> I am asking now because I am just starting to have the problem. </s>
<s> I use my computer for word processing and surfing the net. </s>
<s> I started out with 128MB and added a 256 card because Gateway recommended it when my computer started taking a while to load pages when I had multiple programs running during an online college program. </s>
<s> I also had to uninstall AOL 9.0 and go back to 6.0 and that seemed to help. </s>
<s> Then recently when I checked the resources and saw they were very low upon booting up I added another Gateway 256 card but that didn't help. </s>
<s> Resources are still low and the defragging process stalls. </s>
<s> No viruses, no spyware, no cookies, etc. </s>
<s> What's wrong? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
