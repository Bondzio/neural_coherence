I have been transferring files over to my new computer and I made some new folders just for my Turbo Tax info and some very important pictures.
Now I need to reuse it ( it's already filled up) so I can finish up.
How in the world to I overwrite, erase or otherwise reuse this thing?
All of my previous transfers are not overwritten and therefore are copied into another file!
It's a Lexar 512 MB if that helps.Thanx
