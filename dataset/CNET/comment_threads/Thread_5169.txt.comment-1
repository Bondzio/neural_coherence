Hi!
When trying to play &quot;Age of Conan&quot; or &quot;FreeRealms&quot;, or the Star Trek online beta after a few minutes I get a crash, which according to Win7 is being caused by ATIKMAG.... Just upgraded drivers and Catalyst control center to 09.12 (also tried removing the catalyst control center because a post on the web said that might be the problem (it wasn't).
Tried switching off Aero, tried 9.12 hotfix, tried re-seating memory (ran windows &quot;memory diagnostics utility&quot; showed no problems) nothing doing any good... Help please!
