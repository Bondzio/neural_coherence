have your computer connect.
start, run or hit the windows key and the r key at the same time.
typr cmd hit enter type ipconfig /all (space between the g and /) hit enter look for the default gateway.
might look something like 192.168.1.1 what ever the default gateway is, open your browser and type the default gateway in the browser.
it will then prompt you for your username and password.
hope this helps.
