I went and got another one, plugged in the new power cord, which is a 12v2A and it is still doing it. How can I fix this so that I can retrieve my documents?

If it fails there, the next stop is http://www.drivesavers.com Just wondering. Where are the backup copies of these files? Externals are not &quot;storage&quot; but copies. Bob
