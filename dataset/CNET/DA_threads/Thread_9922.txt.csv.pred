1.1.1	Does any one know if there are any Windows 8 ( not RT ) tablets out there that will also do Intel Wireless Display ( WiDi ) ?	Ques
1.1.2	I see the Acer W700 has a CPU that is WiDi capable , but it will NOT do WiDi .	St
1.1.3	Greg	St
1.2.1	I know those that promote or love it will disagree but due to built-in limitations on playing of certain content , which changed a while ago with WiDi 2.1. http : //www.geek.com/articles/chips/intel-widi-2-1-adds-hdcp-and-blu-ray-streaming-2011056/ So that left all those early adopters with broke systems .	St
1.2.2	The result of all this is low sales and low interest over all .	St
1.2.3	To solve the HD wireless connection I use one of those wireless HDMI solutions .	St
1.2.4	Good luck on your search .	Polite
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob , Thanks for the come back !	St
1.3.2	Care to point me at & quot ; one of those wireless HDMI solutions. & quot ; that you use ?	Ques
1.3.3	All of the reviews I have seen about them do not look so hot .	St
1.3.4	If I found one that worked well , I would go that way .	St
1.3.5	Greg	St
1.4.1	http : //sellout.woot.com/offers/philips-wireless-hd-net-connect-8 I picked this up since I could pop that in , power the transmitter with USB .	St
1.4.2	All the reviews are tainted with folk that , well I apologize , are expecting more than the product can deliver .	St
1.4.3	That is I see folk read & quot ; good for 20 feet & quot ; then they stick a wall and hope it will go 40 feet .	St
1.4.4	That will result in a bad review .	St
1.4.5	I 'm guessing here you want that iPad screen over WiFi solution .	St
1.4.6	Maybe that 's out there .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	Bob , Looks like a few of them have shown up since I last checked into it .	St
1.5.2	That model is not available just now , but I think I have a few other ones on Amazon .	St
1.5.3	Not using an iPad , need to use a windows pad for other requirements , so wan it to work with that , and actually only from the couch to the TV ... .. Greg	St
1.6.1	At home we have the usual Kindle Fire HD 7 .	St
1.6.2	I was going to use this on that but went with a HDMI cable instead .	St
1.6.3	I used the usual miniHDMI to HDMI , coupler , then HDMI to HDMI for the last stretch .	St
1.6.4	Overall it 's 31 feet long and works great without much to do and under 20 bucks .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	Here 's what I use .	St
1.7.2	http : //www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B006KYY1AU/ref=mw_dp_mpd ? pd=1 & qid=1360395638 & sr=8-8 Samsung series 7 slate I have windows 8 pro on it and the WiDi has some bugs in connecting sometimes , where it does n't synch right on first connection and I have to disconnect , close the WiDi management program and the .	St
1.7.3	Restart and reconnect .	St
1.7.4	Then , if the tablet hits sleep mode the connection and software will need to be reset again as well .	St
1.7.5	I do n't recall those issues when I used Windows 7 , however .	St
1.7.6	And it comes preloaded with Win7 Home Premium .	St
1.7.7	Otherwise , it is good for my uses , presentations in the office and streaming WatchESPN and movies to the TV at home .	St
1.7.8	The system has some limitations to note , primarily no built in SiM slot for cellular data hook ups ( only a minor inconvenience to me , as I just tether my cell when needed , and WiFi is pretty obiquitious where I travel .	St
1.7.9	Also , there is no pen slot on the device for the stylus which is just a hassle .	St
1.7.10	Also , the battery life stated is obviously wrong ( 7 hours ? ! ? !	Ques
1.7.11	I wish ) .	St
1.7.12	I end up with about 4.5 - 5 hours of just using word , onenote , email , some web surfing and some other non-intensive windows programs .	St
1.7.13	I get about 3 for steady video streaming , say from Amazon or Netflix .	St
1.7.14	Otherwise , it 's a solidly built system that comes in at about the same price point as a surface pro tablet with 128 GB SSD , and no WiDi .	St
1.7.15	I 'm happy with it for now .	St
1.8.1	That 's not right .	Res
1.8.2	After decades of bringing products to the market with bugs , why should we keep such today ?	Ques
1.8.3	Take it back .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	I hear you Bob , but my point was that it is a stable and usable system on a Windows 7 machine .	St
1.9.2	The bugs only occurred when I upgraded the tablet to Windows 8 Pro , and as I recall , the upgrade assistant and the Intel website noted that there were issues using the platform on Windows 8 at the time .	St
1.9.3	So it was my decision .	St
1.9.4	I like Windows 8 so I was willing to put up with the buggy WiDi driver in hopes that it gets resolved soon .	St
1.9.5	Someone who bought the same machine and kept Windows 7 on it , is likely not to have my issues , as I never did when I had solely the Windows 7 Professional installed .	St
1.10.1	Would think with the 128 GB SSD you coud do a dual boot but I guess with it being an update you would hav to install W7 twice and upgrade just one partition .	St
1.10.2	Is that possible ?	Ques
1.11.1	yep that does the trick more fage than fage , , , did you get it to work..	St
1.12.1	And yes wireless HDMI does work .	St
1.12.2	Too many folk use it today and there are too many models that work so it 's considered a good solution .	St
