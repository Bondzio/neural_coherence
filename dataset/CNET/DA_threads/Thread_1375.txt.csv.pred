1.1.1	Hi my mother board has this slot that looks like you could put and AGP slot in i was wondering if it was possible to do so.	St
1.1.2	The board is an Intel Desktop Board D915GVWB.	St
1.1.3	Thnnx!!!	St
1.1.4	!	St
1.2.1	I'm not sure if you are asking if you can put an AGP card in there, or put an AGP slot in there, but either way, the answer is no.	Res
1.2.2	If you are wanting to put a graphics card in there, it needs to be a PCI express card.	St
1.2.3	Those are better than AGP anyway; they offer faster transfer rates.	St
1.3.1	to know.	St
1.3.2	Should also be able to locate info on WEB if you can't find your manual.	St
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	If you had the motherboard for a couple off years it may be and AGP slot.	St
1.4.2	If it is an AGP slot you can not put and PCI Express card in that slot.	St
1.4.3	If the slot is a different color than your PCI slots it most likely is a video card slot, but you got to make sure which one AGP or PCI Express slot.	St
1.4.4	Is this a computer you built or is it store bought.	St
1.4.5	If it is store bought supply us with the make and model #.	St
1.4.6	Thank You: Wendell H	St
1.5.1	in his MB docs or at the Intel WEB.	St
1.5.2	Shame not to use the DOCs or the WEB when they're so close.	St
1.5.3	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	I checked at the Intel site and found his MB.	St
1.6.2	As you mentioned it is a PCI Express Slot on his MB.	St
1.6.3	I did not go to the site and should have trusted the model # that was given.	St
1.6.4	Thank you for reminding me trust first until proven wrong, in this case the model # was correct.	St
1.6.5	I would have given the same info if there was know model #, but there was.	St
1.6.6	Thank You Very Much: Wendell H	St
1.7.1	As noted by VAPCMD.	St
1.7.2	This writer only knows of TWO video cards for the PCI X1 slot.	St
1.8.1	whether it's the hard copy manual or the online version.	St
1.8.2	I'm not sure whether PCIe video cards are backwards compatible or not so I recommend choosing carefully.	Res
1.8.3	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	Well thank you all so much for your help.	Polite
