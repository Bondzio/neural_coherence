i have a wired network using a linksys hub a p4 with xp pro and a p2 (laptop) with win98.
the internet access is through the p4.
messenger will sign on using the p4 but will not sign on using the p2.
i can access all other msn pages.
also, on the p2, ebay will let me sign on but will not allow me to d/l the items for sale just the categories.
can anyone help?
thanx woody
