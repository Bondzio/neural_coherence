i was expecting to hear the &quot;siren&quot; type of beeps if the cpu had a problem instead of hearing nothing.
when you mentioned hearing nothing along with my previous testing of other items, i realized it almost certainly had to be a processor problem.
what's your opinion on amd's using such weak pins on these 939 pin processors?
they are so close together though i don't think they could make them too much thicker and still have a socket that could take them.
are you finding them difficult to get properly installed?
the 754 and down have never presented any problem for installation to me.
i'd rather have these newer processors mounted on a circuit board with bigger, stronger pins to fit in a bigger socket.
if they did that they could still go super nano on the processor itself but make it easier for those who install them.
