Is it in my best interest to convert the FAT32 to NTFS...and format/partition the new 80 gig to NTFS or run the 40 as is and run the 80 as NTFS? 2. When/if I convert the FAT32 to NTFS, should I just use the XP convert ''tool'' since I have the OS/programs/files on the drive? Or should I backup the drive and format? Benefits/Drawbacks? 3. I am in search of a way (if possible) to backup my operating system and programs so I do not have to reinstall everything from scatch...(if not the best idea...suggestions?) Background Information: System will eventually have an external HD to use as a backup of drive #2, while drive #1 strictly runs OS and Program files.

Older OS, such as Windows 95, cannot read NTFS because it does not support the newer file system. If you have Windows NT, 2000, XP or above, it doesn't matter what kind of mix of file systems you have. You can partition one harddrive into two drives, one running on FAT and the other on NTFS, and it will work fine.

Spend the &quot;few&quot; extra bucks and go get a large capacity HD. You didn't say if you were planning on running a RAID setup. But if you're a gamer RAID is NOT the way to go. In fact a RAID setup is actually slower for gaming then a single HD. Save yourself the headaches and get a larger HD

What I said in my post was valid. If he makes the operating system FAT 32 he won't be able to read the files data et al that would be on the NTFS drive.

It says if he has XP running FAT32 on the boot drive and the other drive or partition is in NTFS, he can't read them from the boot operating system. Exactly the same as if the second drive was formatted using an overlay program. We sure live in different worlds.
3825	9	108138	1237984	1237906	dagger906	6/11/05 3:05 PM	1.1185023E12	Not true!	Haha! Where did you get all your ideas!? You've got to be kidding me! It doesn't matter which drive is the boot drive. Windows XP, the software itself, supports both formats and can read from both formats. Poohoo... ^_____^
