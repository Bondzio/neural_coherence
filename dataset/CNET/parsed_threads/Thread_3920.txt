<s> Hi, I recently bought a Gainward Golden Sample 6600GT off of Ebay - it was listed as new and looked like it when I got it. </s>
<s> It worked fine on Call of Duty: United offensive and a few other games for a few days until I played Quake 4 on high settings, it was fine at first but then the screen blacked out.. </s>
<s> I rebooted for a notice to come up which said i had a lack of power ... this seemed strange for 350w should be ok for a single hardrive and a couple of dvd players ... i checked a power estimator site and it said I would only need 250w so It should of been fine. </s>
<s> Anyway I checked the card and then put Quake 4 back on this time it was fine until it blacked out again ... </s>
<s> I rebooted again and it seemed ok until I tried out Call of duty and a few other games including Quake again - the screen now was covered in black lines and squares across it, and it seems like the screen couldn't refresh quick enough. </s>
<s> They scroll diagonally but you can see the game behind the black lines etc . </s>
<s> The thing is that only happens in games and is fine apart from that... </s>
<s> The card never overheated i checked that ... Can i fix it? </s>
<s> Did I not have enough power? </s>
<s> Unfortunatly I can't return to gainward because I need proof of purchase from a registered partner. </s>
<s> Here are my system specs, if it helps: Dell Dimension 5150 Pentium 4 640 3.2ghz Sony DVD RW Dell DVD 1 gb RAM (4x256mb) 80gb HD 350W power supply and i am using a X600 graphics card at the moment.. thats working fine! </s>
<s> Thanks for any help! </s>
<s> I suspect that when you are pushing the graphics card in the games, your power supply cannot provide enough stable 12v power, thereby causing the &quot;graphic card crash&quot;. </s>
<s> The 350 supply is just above the bare minimum of 300 that the 6600GT requires and I suspect if we actually measured it, it falls short. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help I will keep that in mind, unfortunatly I know have to look for a replacement. </s>
<s> Which PCI-E card should I get? </s>
<s> I was thinking maybe a INNO3D 7300GT but would that &quot;crash&quot; too? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
