Since reinstalling the OS from the Gateway recovery disk, her DVD player will not read DVD's. You can put a CD or a DVD in and open Explorer and view the contents. But, when you use a DVD Player program (and I tried several to see if it was just a software problem) the programs come back with a message stating that no DVD player was found. Everything looks good in device manager, My Computer shows it as a DVD player, and I've gone through an updated all the drivers. Any thoughts on this??? Thanks, Cameron

OS (Win 98) was reinstalled after a full reformat of the HD. I can't remember now why she felt like she needed to do that. The DVD was a Gateway installed ... the manufacturer started with an &quot;M&quot;, but I can't remember exactly who it was. I'll e-mail her and find out. Thanks for your help. Cameron

The motherboard, audio, video and such drivers all need to be installed before I would expect a DVD to work. BUT if I look at PowerDVD, it's default install in some versions needs a little help in finding the drive letter of the DVD. Its in some options menu but since there are any number of versions, I leave it to you to find the menu and setting. Next, the CD/DVD drives must NOT have any driver in CONFIG.SYS. PLEASE share the contents of the CONFIG.SYS file to make sure it's ok. Bob
