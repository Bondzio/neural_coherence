Whenever I play music or view content with audio the sound stutters occaisionally. The problem is more likely to occur when I am opening a program, which leads me to belive that it's a memory issue, but I have a 256 in there already. Any ideas? Also, my battery now only lasts for 15-20 minutes or so when not plugged in. The machine is about 1.5 years old, is this normal? Thanks

No reboot needed and it's documented at http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx If it is this issue, that will cure it. If you do not perform the procedure, please tell why. Bob

Switching from DMA mode to PIO only and back didn't seem to do anything for my audio problem. Any further suggestions, or did I not performed the procedure correctly? Thanks, MAtt

Either someone flips it back and forth then OKs it (that was not the procedure) or they were rebooting at each step (again, not in the procedure.) It's in the noted web link so if you are unsure you followed the steps, just read it one more time and do the steps exactly as written. Next up? 1. Drivers. 2. No spyware. 3. Scan the machine with HOUSECALL. Bob

If you just switched it and back, the procedure doesn't work. It's all in the details and if you could... Either write you did it exactly as described or wrote your exact steps I could call this step done. As it stands, I'm not sure you completed the procedure. Bob
