i'm not stupid... i have a dell studio 540 i purchased recently, and it's running 64 bit vista premium.
when i go to control panal/hardware and sound, all i get is bluetooth local com, which is not a bluetooth wizard, just a list of com ports.
if i search for bluetooth wizard, i get no result.
it is also not in the accessories file like everyone says.
when i run fsquirt.exe, i get an error saying windows cannot find it.
how do i not have the wizard/where can i get it?
