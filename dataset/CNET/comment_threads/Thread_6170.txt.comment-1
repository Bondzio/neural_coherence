I have a Gateway GT5622 and I am planning on setting up a home network and using the desktop as a file server/media streamer.
I have a realtek ethernet attached to the motherboard.
According to the specs on the Gateway website and on the specs for my motherboard it is 10/100, but in my device manager it says gigabit.
How can I tell if I have gigabit or not?
Would a PCI networking card give me better network performance?
