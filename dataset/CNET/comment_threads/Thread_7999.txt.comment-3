I tried every possible combination using the original pair in different slots but I still get the same result.
The manual doesn't say much about memory except that it can support three 184-pin DDR DIMMs up to 2GB and it doesn't have any sort of troubleshooting in regards to memory.
Should I try one of the BIOS or Mobo drivers from their site?
