so here's the deal.
i had a belkin n f5d8236-4 router.
i have 2 laptops and a desktop (plus a dvr, wii and xbox that are currently of no concern).
i switched to a linksys wrt160n v3 and the desktop adapter in my comp.
i guess i should start with specs: laptop 1: mini-pcie g adapter (what came in it, not worried about it) laptop 2: mini-pcie atheros ar5008x chipset with 8.xx drivers loaded (latest) internal card btw desktop : had a linksys wmp110, now a linksys wmp600n, both ralink chipsets, latest drivers installed when i had my belkin, my desktop got 135mbps link (about 30 feet and 3 walls in the way) on the wmp110.
i figured that was good enough, since it's a single band adapter anyway, never expected to get 300 out of it.
my laptop #2 was getting a 300mbps link.
i was getting intermittent drops of the wifi link on the router (wireless just turned off for whatever reason) and throughput from laptop to desktop was about 300-400kb/s if i was lucky.
so i decided to get something more stable (with the option to do dd-wrt) and got the wrt160n.
i figured it was a good time to update the desktop adapter to a 300mbps card and that prompted the wmp600n (dual band capable card) to be bought.
now, my desktop connects at 130mbps and the laptop at 130mbps.
wtf?
so i start playing around with settings, and have wpa-aes, using mixed mode b/g/n.
i have to use either 20mhz or 20/40mhz mixed (my only 2 choices), neither of which makes a difference.
under one of the settings, it has the speed set to auto, but the max it shows it connections available to 130mbps.
sooo, anyone who knows, how can i get something out of it, like the 300mbps it says on the front of the box?
it is a single band 2.4ghz radio.
i'm currently getting throughput of 3mb/s consistently transferring files from laptop to desktop, does that sound about right?
i'm thinking even at 130mbps i should be getting 10mb/s or so.
i'm getting to the point of frustration, cause i don't understand why i can't get a good and fast connection at the same time.
maybe someone has some light to put on thie subject.
i'm sure i left out vital info about my setup, so don't going throwing around the hate, just let me know what you need and i'll give you all the info you could want for help.
i haven't tried putting my wmp110 back in yet, but plan on it tomorrow, cause it will save me $80 to dump the wmp600n (and the netgear 300t is $50, rated at 300 so i might just exchange for that if i can get the 130/300 problem figured).
i will take screen shots of my config, whatever you guys need... thanks for reading this whole thing, and for your help in advance...
