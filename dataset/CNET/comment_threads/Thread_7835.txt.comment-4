Based on the information from D-Links website, I would say Windows 98 first edition may have a problem with this adapter.
Workarounds are: 1) Upgrade the OS 2) Place the wireless router near the 98 machine and use a CAT5 cable to it.
Of course some type of ethernet adapter would need to be installed in the machine.
A multiported wireless router which feature both wired and wireless capabilities from D-Link or Linksys are among the most popular devices used.
