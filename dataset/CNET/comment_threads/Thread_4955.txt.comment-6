on intel lower latencies barely affect performance.
On an amd processor (which is much faster than an intel on nearly all games in existance) they benefit from lower latencies.
Fortunately if you have 2gbs on an amd you will not have any lower performance.
An athlon 64 processor has such a high bus speed (thanks to hyperthreading) that it would take many sticks of ram to for it to bottleneck your ram.
For example the FX-55 has a clock speed of 2.6GHz, the bus speed would also be 2.6GHz.
Perhaps you would also be thinking of a new video card?
