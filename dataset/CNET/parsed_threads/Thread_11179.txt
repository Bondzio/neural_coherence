<s> Hey all, I'm trying to bring some life to an old computer - Dell Dimension 8200, by installing a SATA HD controller card. </s>
<s> I also have a small footprint Dell that I have been using that does have a SATA drive, however the spring-loaded 'circuit breaker' that breaks an electrical connection when the interior overheats has broken in that machine. </s>
<s> I'm still using it, thanks to the use of a jumper wire, but am not happy with that solution - thus prompting me to upgrade the older machine. </s>
<s> I've already tried a SATA controller card that I now see was designed as a RAID controller. </s>
<s> I'm not using a RAID system, but I naively put that card into the Dimension, hooked up the SATA drive from the other computer, and booted up. </s>
<s> Shortly into the Windows XP splash screen, I got a Blue Screen telling me that the system was stopping in order to prevent something dangerous from happening to the system. </s>
<s> Hmmm... </s>
<s> Question - will a SATA controller card designed for a RAID system not work with a single hard drive? </s>
<s> What I'd like to happen is that I put in a controller card and my existing hard drive into the Dimension, the XP OS on the HD automatically recognize the controller and then boot up. </s>
<s> Is this a reasonable thing to expect? </s>
<s> If so, can anyone recommend a SATA controller card that will do this in a plug-and-play fashion? </s>
<s> I'd think there would be a chicken-and-egg issue with respect to installing drivers on a hard drive for recognizing a new HD controller card. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help, John </s>
<s> A SATA CARD with the onboard ROM to enable it to boot. </s>
<s> &quot;Is this a reasonable thing to expect?&quot; Sorry no. </s>
<s> This is not something that has been designed to do that. </s>
<s> We had a member go though all sorts of trials and they seemed to never try the SATA card that could boot. </s>
<s> The ones that can boot have an onboard ROM (or flash) that enables this to work very closely to what you ask. </s>
<s> But then again you wrote &quot;XP&quot; which does throw a wrench in to the works. </s>
<s> XP has that nasty 127GB limit and will be tough on some to install. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply - a couple of things: The 127 GB limit won't be a problem as the SATA drive I want to use is only 80 GB. </s>
<s> I've looked some more and saw what might be another option - an adapter that connects between a SATA drive and the IDE socket on a motherboard. </s>
<s> Found one on Amazon for less than four bucks including shipping, so I'll give that a try. </s>
