I plan to use it on an older laptop running xp and hopefully a new pc (haven't bought yet) running Vista. My question is: How can I get a bunch of data off an old PC running windows ME ? The machine recognizes the device as a USB disk; but it is not available to browse in My Computer. Thanks in advance, s

You boot a CD, some windows show up with drive letters and files and you copy them as you learned in Windows. Now, what Linux skill did that involve?
