1.1.1	I have 3 comps hooked up through a switch.	St
1.1.2	I can't move files larger than 600 megs between computers or I get cyclic redundency, time out, and unable to find file errors.	St
1.1.3	The same happens if I try to transfer more than about 2 gigs of files at one time.	St
1.1.4	Normal moving works fine.	St
1.1.5	The problem happens if I try to take or move files from another computer .	St
1.1.6	I get more data through if I take files though.	St
1.1.7	2 comps on xp pro and 1 on xp home.	St
1.1.8	I was wondering what might cause this prob and if I switched to a router it might help.	St
1.1.9	Also, 1 xp pro is sharing the internet connection.	St
1.1.10	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	for what you want to do, a router is.	St
1.2.2	Get a router and remove the switch.	St
1.2.3	A switch is only used behind a router for adding more computers.	St
1.3.1	Guess you get what you pay for.	St
1.3.2	Thanks	Polite
