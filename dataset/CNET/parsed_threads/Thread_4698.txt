<s> I recently replaced the motherboard in my system and when i hook everything back up, I get an error that NTLDR can't open multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1). </s>
<s> I know for a fact that absolutely nothing happened to the hard disk during transition, so i really don't think it could be a hardware problem, can anyone maybe point me in the right direction? </s>
<s> -Motherboard is a socket 754 Nvidia Nforce 3-a w/ Athlon 64-bit 3700+ -Drive is a Samsung 160GB SATA disk. </s>
<s> -Windows XP Pro SP2 -2 GB DDR 400 RAM Any thoughts or assitance would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Ok good to know my drive is ok. </s>
<s> I've checked into those links and most seem to suggest a repair install of XP. </s>
<s> However, here's what's happening now.... </s>
<s> I boot off of the xp cd, ignore the first option to repair, it detects my previous install which i then tell it to repair. </s>
<s> Once i do this, it copies all the files and reboots my machine but when the machine comes up nothing happens. </s>
<s> Nothing boots, setup does not continue. </s>
<s> Ideas? </s>
<s> Details are far too slim to offer much yet. </s>
<s> But think about any item you can unplug or disable since XP can't handle USB or much else until we get the drivers on it. </s>

<s> ...if the new mobo has a different chipset. </s>
<s> reinstalling will preserve your apps. </s>
<s> if you've got an xp cd w/sp2, the reinstall won't be that big of a deal (just time-consuming to apply the patches). </s>
<s> if you only have an original xp cd, be prepared for frustration though. </s>
<s> Ok so i tried a few times to repair the install and each time the machine would reboot itself, but on reboot setup would not re-launch. </s>
<s> Now, when i try to boot the machine i no longer get a NTLDR error, the system does a POST, gets to the line about verifying DMI pool data, and does nothing. </s>
<s> No errors, no activity, just a blinking cursor, keyboard is useless for anything other than ctrl+alt+del.... My question at this point is even if i reinstall, what happens when i install xp, and it reboots during the process and this happens again? </s>
<s> It's usually something like a dead drive, bad IDE cable, noisy power supply or &quot;other.&quot; I have yet to see it be a Windows issue. </s>
<s> At the very lease, try the FIXMBR command. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> and I checked and replaced the IDE cables for the floppy and CD for testing. </s>
<s> The SATA cable cam brand new with the new motherboard so i think that can be ruled out. </s>
<s> Power supply is fine, and I know for an absolute certainty that the hard drive was working as of last week, nothing has happened to it since. </s>
<s> BIOS can see the drive, so can Windows setup, it just refuses to boot. </s>
<s> I tried FIXMBR and FIXBOOT from the recovery console and it is still hanging at verifiying DMI pool.... Anymore ideas? </s>
<s> The SATA repair is complex when we change the motherboard. </s>
<s> Besides disabling USB, sound, ethernet and what ever else we can we can't use XP's repair and have a booting system. </s>
<s> On top of the repair we boot the XP SP2 CD then hit the magic F6 key to supply the NEW SATA drivers for this new board. </s>
