<s> I need to do some crowd sourcing. </s>
<s> I currently have a DIR 655 that is dying. </s>
<s> The problem seems to be the power cord. </s>
<s> I thought about trying to replace only the cord but, we all know that once something like a router starts getting hit with electrical issues its only a matter of time before it dies altogether. </s>
<s> So my question then becomes, which router to replace it with. </s>
<s> Ordinarily, I'd stick with what's worked for me. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I don't have that kind of money right now. </s>
<s> There is also a timing factor that keeps me from going online for a really good deal. </s>
<s> I literally have about $ 50 to spend and I'm in a small town with a Wal-Mart and a radio shack to serve my tech needs. </s>
<s> So I'm pretty much stuck picking from three routers. </s>
<s> Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G 54Mbps Broadband Router Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G 54Mbps Broadband Router Cisco Linksys Wireless N Router, WRT120N Belkin Surf N300 Wireless Router Now,, I have to say the belkin is one I'm not really interested in because, I've never ever had a good experience with them. </s>
<s> However, I'm willing to be fair. </s>
<s> The only thing that bothers me about the cisco is, it claims to be wireless N 2.0 but they aren't willing to say what the top speed of the wireless radio is anywhere on the box. </s>
<s> As for the net gear, I've had a hit or miss relationship with them. </s>
<s> Had a great hub once, but also had a horrible router once. </s>
<s> The last thing I'll say is, obviously , I want to get the best overall router for the money and while the wireless is certainly important in that regard, right now everything is wired, so I just need something to get me by until I can get a better router. </s>
<s> In other words, something that doesn't need power cycled every other day. </s>
<s> So what do you think? </s>
<s> You are pretty much limited if you are going to buy from a retail store in a small town and not buy online. </s>
<s> I would not buy a G router any more. </s>
<s> Eventually all your other equipment will get upgraded to N and then you have to upgrade your router again. </s>
<s> I suspect N will be the best you can get for many years to come. </s>
<s> As far as speed goes in the short run they will exactly what you have today since you will need to run in G mode unless all your PC's have N already. </s>
<s> In the future when you upgrade your N speed will be based on which features both the router and the nic cards support. </s>
<s> Most say they will do 150m and some say 300m. </s>
<s> Your limiting factor is the internet so it does not really matter a lot. </s>
<s> These numbers are all best case numbers anyway. </s>
<s> Buy the router for the other features, firewall, url filter etc etc. </s>
<s> The radio part are pretty much the same. </s>
<s> I would stay wired once it works it works... until the hardware fails. </s>
<s> Let's ditch/scratch that one without further ado. </s>
<s> The DLR 655 at http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=530 seems to gain favor in reviews and owners. </s>
<s> If you need that. </s>
<s> My older wnr2000 and similar 3700 run for months without power cycling. </s>
<s> That 614 is well known for it's lockups when folk try to run TORRENTS. </s>
<s> But go figure. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, you can pick either or. </s>
<s> Maybe the prices are a little bit different but it's really up to you. </s>
<s> I have the Cisco Linksys wireless router for a long time now and so far it didn't give me no problem. </s>
<s> I really like Cisco Linksys wireless routers. </s>
