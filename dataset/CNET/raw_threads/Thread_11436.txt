I might be able to salvage the old PC (Dell 4600 P4) as a server. But the PS is NOISY. The hard drive is NOISY. I've had it for 6 years. I'm thinking of replacing the hard drive and PS, and using the old machine as a backup unit. I may need to format the old hard drive, but will I need to install a new OS? New computer is win7. Old computer is XP. They don't network nicely. I should know. It took a bit of wrestling to make the two OSes see each other (lotsa help on google for this). Thanks for your help. If I have to buy an OS, I might as well just buy an new backup unit outright and recyle the old PC.

Better run the scan: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor My guess is, nope. By the time you make it compatible it might be cheaper to buy a new one. Might be a real good PC, for awhile for someone without one or some much needed up grade parts for an older PC or possible yours if some of them are new. You will need to replace that hard drive though, noise is never good on a hard drive. It maybe failing now. Other uses for old PCs: http://www.pramnos.com/story69-2331.html There is always the Linux OS.
