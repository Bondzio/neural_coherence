1.1.1	Here 's a hypothetical question , if I received a new laptop for Christmas which came configured with a wireless & quot ; N & quot ; card could I use the new computer with my current Linksys & quot ; g & quot ; router , ( Model WRT54G ) or would I need to upgrade my router to a wireless & quot ; N & quot ; model ?	Ques
1.1.2	Is wireless & quot ; N & quot ; faster than my current wireless & quot ; g & quot ; ?	Ques
1.2.1	Wireless N laptops will work for Wireless G router , they are all backward compatible .	St
1.2.2	Wireless N is 2-3 times as fast as G and has a longer range .	St
1.3.1	If I stayed with my present DSL speed which is DSL Lite through AT & T , their entry level DSL speed , with a new laptop having a wireless N card inside instead of a wireless G card inside are you saying I 'll be able to notice a much faster speed while surfing wirelessly on the laptop in another part of the house or are you saying the time that it takes my DSL signal to go from my router to the laptop in another part of the house will be faster ?	Ques
1.3.2	In other words to get a faster DSL speed I 'd probably have to upgrade my level of DSL service with AT & T ?	Ques
1.3.3	Thanks for your comments .	Polite
1.4.1	Router speed , be it wireless or wired , have no effect on connection speed .	St
1.4.2	Your DSL speed will not increase .	St
1.4.3	Router speeds , wired or wireless , affect your home LAN only , between computers .	St
1.4.4	Wireless G is advertised at 54 Mb/s , wireless N is advertised at ~100 Mb/s .	St
1.4.5	And wireless N is supposed to have a slightly longer range due to it 's higher frequencies .	St
1.4.6	Do n't hold your breath on speed or distance .	St
1.4.7	To get faster DSL speed you need to upgrade to higher speed DSL or move to cable .	Sug

1.4.9	There are 10 types of people who understand binary ; those that do and those that do n't .	St
1.5.1	If wireless N offers more speed and distance should I be concerned about someone down the street being able to access my high speed service and use it ?	Ques
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	Turn on security , but NOT WEP .	St
1.8.1	So no WEP ? , thanks .	Polite
1.8.2	Let me ask you another question , I dropped a Dell notebook in January 2008 which I have n't been able to use since that time , it was my brother 's notebook .	St
1.8.3	He came to see me last week , took the notebook back with him , said he 'd try to have it repaired or just buy me a new one .	St
1.8.4	He said he 'd buy me whatever brand I want .	St
1.8.5	I 've only had experience using a Dell , nothing else .	St
1.8.6	I do know if the new notebook comes with any form of Windows Vista to be sure that it has at least 2GB of system memory .	St
1.8.7	I 'm still up in the air on which processor to select just for basic computing needs , email , web surfing , etc .	St
1.8.8	I still have a Linksys wireless & quot ; g & quot ; router hooked up just as it was set up for me in the spring of 2006 .	St
1.8.9	Until I get another notebook should I go ahead and disconnect the router from the Dell desktop computer that 's still here in the house and pack it away ?	Ques
1.8.10	If I should disconnect it , which cables should I disconnect and reconnect to make sure that I can still receive the DSL on the Dell desktop ?	Ques
1.8.11	Is it possible that a neighbor right now could be tapping into my signal and me not know it ?	Ques
1.8.12	How would I check or where would I check ?	Ques
1.8.13	Thanks for your comments .	Polite
1.9.1	No , with WEP security there 's little chance your neighbour will be tapping into your internet .	St
1.9.2	You do n't need ( or want ) to start changing the wiring .	St
1.9.3	As you do n't currently need wireless the only thing you need to do to reduce any risk is to have a look at the manual for the router ( download a copy from the maker 's site ) and address the router 's user interface via the browser in your desktop machine and in the router settings turn off wireless .	Ques
1.9.4	You might as well familiarise yourself with these procedures as , when you get the new laptop , you 'll probably have to mess around in the router 's settings to get it to work with the laptop 's wireless .	St
1.10.1	You need to use security but not WEP .	St
1.10.2	WEP can be hacked in about 30 seconds .	St
1.10.3	You need to use WPA , either flavor , WPA or WPA2 depending on what your router and/or laptop support .	St
1.10.4	Neighbor ?	Ques
1.10.5	If you have security turned off , ANYONE can get into your system .	St
1.10.6	If you are running WEP , ANYONE can .	St
1.10.7	.	St
1.10.8	.	St
1.11.1	I never supply links on how to crack a WEP network but the faster software is about 2 minutes to get connected .	St
1.11.2	The idea that MAC filtering could bolster WEP is also dead .	St
1.11.3	Let 's move to security that is not fully exploited yet such as WPA and if you can , WPA2 .	St
1.11.4	Bob	St
1.12.1	Where or how would I check to see which security setting I have ?	Ques
1.12.2	Should I leave my router hooked up even though I do n't have a working notebook to take advantage of the signal or should I go ahead and disconnect it ?	Ques
1.12.3	These terms , WEP , WPA , WPA2 only relate to wireless correct ?	Ques
1.12.4	If you have DSL but no router you should have nothing to worry about ?	Ques
1.12.5	Correct or not ?	Ques
1.12.6	Thanks for the comments .	St
1.13.1	Security available is in the router 's settings .	St
1.13.2	Look there .	St
1.13.3	Then look at the computer 's settings .	St
1.13.4	I ca n't help any further from here , you have to look .	St
1.13.5	Wireless only , yes .	St
1.13.6	Some DSL modems contain a built in wireless router .	St
1.13.7	But if you 're connected wired , no worries .	St
1.14.1	My Bell South DSL modem does not contain a built in wireless router , thanks for the post .	St
1.15.1	My brother who lives in another state called me earlier tonight to inform me that he had received his laptop which I dropped in January 2008 and damaged and he has decided to buy another one rather than spend the money it would take to fix the other one .	St
1.15.2	He told me to get a few configurations together for a replacement laptop I 'd like and send the information to him soon and he 'd try to get me another laptop before Christmas .	St
1.15.3	Should I configure the next laptop to have wireless & quot ; g & quot ; like the other one had or should I switch to wireless & quot ; N & quot ; ?	Ques
1.15.4	I 've looked at Dell 's Inspiron 1525 laptop which comes standard with a Dell wireless & quot ; g & quot ; card or for less than $ 50.00 I can upgrade to a Dell wireless & quot ; N & quot ; card .	St
1.15.5	Is wireless & quot ; N & quot ; what everyone 's now going with or is & quot ; g & quot ; still popular ?	Ques
1.15.6	I looked at some Linksys routers for & quot ; N & quot ; and new models for & quot ; g & quot ; .	St
1.15.7	If I switched from & quot ; g & quot ; to & quot ; N & quot ; I would have to make a change in my router I would think .	St
1.15.8	Is Linksys still considered the best router brand to go with or are there other brands out there I should consider ?	Ques
1.15.9	My current Linksys router , a WRT54G is over 2 years old .	St
