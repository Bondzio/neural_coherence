I want to connect manually to the network with my XP netbook; i.e. I don't want Windows to store the key, I want to type it in each time I connect. It is probably a simple thing, but I can't figure it out in XP (in Vista I just uncheck a box...). I am using Windows XP Home. Thanks!

I won't bore you with why Windows is coded to remember it and why it would cause users to erupt into flame as the connection dropped and they would have to re-enter the password. But think about these tools to research where it is stored to write a script. (you do this!) http://labnol.blogspot.com/2006/11/microsoft-combines-regmon-filemon.html So there is it. Regmon, Filemon or just use the new thing. Sorry but you ask a good question but it flies in the face of ease of use so you get to craft your own solution. Bob

The kids are glad to know it's soon to be history. We bought that family pack Windows 7 upgrade for the home.
