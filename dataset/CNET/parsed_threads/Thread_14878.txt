<s> I got a computer with INTEL 2.4 GHZ prosesor and 256 mb of memory with two hard drives, the master drive runs XP Profesional and the slave drive has XP Home, my cuestion is, how can I reboot my computer from the slave drive since this drive is a old drive and it dosen't have the motherbord drives installed. </s>
<s> Any ideas or suggestions? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> One of the truly odd things that XP does when it boots is to mark the other drives in such a way that they will not boot. </s>
<s> As such, the second drive may never boot if XP saw it in the system. </s>
