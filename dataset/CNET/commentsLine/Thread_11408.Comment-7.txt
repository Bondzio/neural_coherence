i am using wpa2 in enterprise mode, and you are right, the vulnerability that i am talking about would be exceeding difficult to exploit, (someone would have to do a black bag job on my residence, which isn't real likely) so i'm not overly concerned about it.
i'm just one of those folks that if i know of a security hole, i like to plug it.
