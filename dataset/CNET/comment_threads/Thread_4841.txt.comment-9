Thanks!
My CPU is an Intel Pentium D socket 755.
The PC is an HP Media Station m7170n that I use primarily for video editing.
(Adobe Premiere Pro; Adobe After Effects, Adobe Audition, Adobe Encore, and Photoshop.)
If by price range you mean what I'm willing to spend on a heatsink, then I think I have to spend what it takes to get my system back working - within reason.
It looks like most heatsinks are under $100.
Thanks, Dan
