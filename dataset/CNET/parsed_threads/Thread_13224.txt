<s> About 6 months ago, a thunderstorm was in the area and caused lightning to go through my computer (which was turned off, but unfortunately not unplugged). </s>
<s> When I attempted to turn it on the next day the only thing that came on was a fan somewhere in the computer. </s>
<s> I tested out the hard drive in another computer and it came up fine; the CD-ROM drive works as well. </s>
<s> Is there anyway the problem could be the Power Supply Unit? </s>
<s> Or is that not likely the problem? </s>
<s> Remove baattery, or unplug push poweron button </s>
<s> Just unplug and push power on button? </s>
<s> I took the side panel off the case and here is what happens when I plug the computer into the wall: The power supply fan comes on. </s>
<s> A light on the motherboard comes on. </s>
<s> When I press power on, the computer does nothing! </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> or the power supply is fried. </s>
<s> You can take the power supply out and take it to a computer store and have them plug it in and test it. </s>
<s> It's usually free. </s>
<s> If the supply is ok, the motherboard or the RAM sticks are dead. </s>
<s> The problem with lightning is the problem(s) could be anything. </s>
<s> Once, you figure it out, something else could go in short order or make the fix fail quickly. </s>
<s> I find that replacing the psu is about the quickest and safest bet to attempt a repair on first try. </s>
<s> I suggest you unplug AC for about a min. </s>
<s> then replug and retry. </s>
<s> If it works, great, if not then remove AC again and allow it be left alone for 30min. </s>
<s> unplugged. </s>
<s> Retry again a fter that, otherwise if it fails again, test *ALL* componets one at a time elsewhere. </s>
<s> Basically, the mtrbd. </s>
<s> or psu usually are the cuprits in such cases. </s>
<s> Take my advise and ''do not take anything for granted, test it''. </s>
<s> FYI - Lightning hits my area often and 6/21 last night hit my p/u truck(pretty sure). </s>
<s> It works but is acting strange, so lightning does weird effects. </s>
<s> Oh yeah, I unplugged my system. </s>
<s> Further more, I use several surge protector and line conditioner to quelch such hits and surges. </s>
<s> You should look into that as well once your system is up and running. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The power supply fan comes on when you plug the power supply in????? </s>
<s> Not normal. </s>
<s> The light on the mobo is a light that tells that the 5 volts standby power from the power supply is present. </s>
<s> This powers the logic that turns on the main power supply rails [voltages] when you hit the power button. </s>
<s> Normally the power supply fan would not come on until one hits the power button for the system. </s>
<s> You may have multiple hardware failures. </s>
<s> Easiest is to try a new power supply [might as well get one with a50 or 100 more watt capability]. </s>
<s> You don't have to install the new one to test it. </s>
<s> just unplug the AC to the old supply. </s>
<s> Unplug all of its connectors to the mobo. </s>
<s> Plug the new supply connections to the mobo, and plug it in to the AC power. </s>
<s> Disconnect all other old supply connections from the various devices. </s>
<s> Then turn system power on soley to see if the power supply turns on and the CPU's HSF powers up and the front panel LED's etc. </s>
<s> If that is a go, then remove the old supply and put the new one in. </s>
<s> In a previous post I stated: &quot;I took the side panel off the case and here is what happens when I plug the computer into the wall: The power supply fan comes on. </s>
<s> A light on the motherboard comes on. </s>
<s> When I press power on, the computer does nothing! </s>
<s> Help!&quot; I reconnected all the components that came with the PC i.e. </s>
<s> hard drive, cd-rom drive, etc. </s>
<s> Now not only does the power supply fan come on along with a light on the motherboard, but the whole system seems to be turning on. </s>
<s> Upon plugging the computer into the wall I can literally open and close the CD drive, I can hear the hard drive booting up, the fan that cools the processor even comes on. </s>
<s> However, the green light on the power button does not light up showing that it is on, and I get no signal from the monitor. </s>
<s> It is like the computer is turning on - but not really! </s>
<s> Has anyone ever heard of these symptoms before??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I tried to reseat the ram, and made the system bareboned (only motherboard, processor, psu). </s>
<s> Still the same symptoms. </s>
<s> that the mobo power turn on logic circuit has failed. </s>
<s> The main rails of an ATX supply are turned on when the mobo puts a logic low on pin 14 of the power supply to mobo connector [pin 16 on a 24 pin power connector]. </s>
<s> Thus, I would suspect that the circuit in the mobo has failed in the low state [or of course, a failure of the supply's control circuit inside the supply could fail and cause the same indications]. </s>
<s> The ATX power supply can be turned on while sitting on a table in its box by simply plugging the supply into a hot outlet and connecting pin 14 of its mobo connector to any one of the pins in the same connector that has a black wire [ground, common, return, you name it]. </s>
<s> Thus if the power supply had the failure internally the supply would turn on by simply plugging it in to a hot outlet [the connector to the mobo unplugged]. </s>
<s> If it doesn't turn on under that condition the problem is the mobo connection to pin 14. </s>
<s> When not connected to the mobo the fact that the supply turned on is noted simply by noting that its' fan is rotatiing. </s>
<s> Seems that this simple problem has been around way too long. </s>
