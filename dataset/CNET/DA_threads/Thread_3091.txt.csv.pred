1.1.1	I 'm not in the repair or resale business , rather the school of WHY .	St
1.1.2	This was part of the Compaq Presario 4550 given to me last year .	St
1.1.3	It also contained CD-Rom , Floppy , and Zip drives .	St
1.1.4	I only used the ethernet nic to backup data from my XP and then disconnected the power connection .	St
1.1.5	( SYNCBACK 5 STARS ! )	St
1.1.6	I have a guess why the 4550 was changed this way but not sure .	St
1.1.7	Anyhow , this year I was given an HP Pavilion 6746C .	St
1.1.8	I had to replace the PSU , Floppy , and Hdd .	St
1.1.9	So , I traded the AT PSU ( 4550 ) for an ATX , and the old Floppy ( 4550 ) for another at my computer club .	St
1.1.10	Then , I put the above hardware into the 6746c .	St
1.1.11	( Celeron 733MHz ) The more I read about ATA the confusier I get .	St
1.1.12	I 'm guessing this setup in the 6746C maybe should just be connected to the motherboard and remove the Promise IDE controller .	St
1.1.13	I still use the 6746C for backup to the XP system with an ethernet connection and SYNCBACK .	St
1.2.1	The Promise add in cards had several possible uses .	St
1.2.2	They could increase the number of IDE devices one could put in older PCs whose motherboards only allowed for 4 .	Sug
1.2.3	As well , some older motherboards could n't take advantage of the size or speed of newer drives .	St
1.2.4	By now , this is all past .	St
1.2.5	If your motherboard specs say they support ATA-133 which your drive can handle , you can yank the Promise card .	St
1.2.6	There is n't much use for these anymore .	St
1.3.1	drives larger than 137GBs ... even if the MB BIOS wo n't .	St
1.3.2	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.4.2	I now understand how to ask a better question .	St
1.4.3	The Pavilion 6746C Trigem Cognac board supports PIO Mode 3 and 4 .	St
1.4.4	So , does the 40GB HDD run at the 133 speed , or revert to the lower speed of the mother board ?	Ques
1.4.5	The history is interesting to me since I started clicking in the PC world in 2004 with a Dell 2400 .	St
1.4.6	Promise no longer sells the 133TX2 .	St
1.4.7	The 6746C sold for $ 800 real money in Y2K .	St
