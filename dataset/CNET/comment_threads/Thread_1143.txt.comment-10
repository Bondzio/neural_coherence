I did one with 8 connections initially but expansion capability was also a desire.
I would have needed 8 outlets for this setup and the injectors were already rather large.
As well, 8 additional lengths of ethernet cable would have been needed.
In this case, a more reasonable solution was a POE switch that matched the needs of the APs.
The switch allowed individual ports to have power turned on or off through its web interface.
Using a POE switch just made for a neater installation.
Your OP suggested that you were looking for a 24 port switch and that you needed POE.
I presumed you meant the switch needed to supply the power and was just making sure you were aware that not all POE devices use the same standards.
If you already have compatible injectors, you already have POE capability.
