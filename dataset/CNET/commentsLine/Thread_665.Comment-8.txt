arms were powerfull processors.
i thought that they were embedded for pocket pc's and what not.
as for the dev kit, x86 emulators are available online for the cell processor, so you can run windows in the emulating enviroment.
which of course i know would limit the power of windows over the hardware, but the emulator is open source and i thought maybe i could tweak it.
if not i could boot the debian kernel then run a virtual machine or emulator program directory from the kernel.
as for a ps3 i wouldn't buy one for two reasons the first being i wouldn;t use it as a pc, it's a game console.
second i wouldn't use it as a game system, i am an xbox fan and as such already have an xbox which i enjoy.
all this was just a far off option one that i would have to consider when i came across it.
it was always my intention to go with an x86 processor, but i was curious if it was available for purchase.
