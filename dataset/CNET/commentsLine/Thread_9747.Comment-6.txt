you may have what some call, &quot;componet creep&quot;.
the off/on thus hot/cold operation of the system can cause wiring/harness, ics, and/or cards some movement preventing a good contact.
one reason, i mention reseating cards and harness several times to break the metal-metal contact crust/tarnish plus fully reseat, same.
it happens from time to time, especially in systems that experience alot of heat build-up.
just like a car after running a longtime, upon shutdown you notice the pinging/tweeking of metal as it cools.
good luck -----willy
