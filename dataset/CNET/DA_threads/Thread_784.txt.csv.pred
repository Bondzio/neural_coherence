1.1.1	I just upgraded my graphics card from an old NVidia GeForce4 Ti 4400 128MB, to an ATI Radeon 9550 256 MB, and I'm totally confused (system is an Athlon XP 2100+ with a Gig of RAM by the way).	St
1.1.2	I was running some framerate tests on Counterstrike Source, and they are shockingly MUCH lower with the new card.	St
1.1.3	On one test, the old framerate was 61.42, and with the new card 37.55.	St
1.1.4	In another test with slightly higher settings, the old card 53.51 and the new card 29.93!	St
1.1.5	Now I know the 9550 isn't a monster of a card, but it should still be faster than that old GeForce4 (probably a 4 year old card).	St
1.1.6	At the VERY LEAST it shouldn't be drastically slower.	St
1.1.7	Any answers/opinions/suggestions?!?!?!?	St
1.1.8	Thanks, - Joe	St
1.2.1	ANY change will toss the results into question.	St
1.2.2	There could be other factors such as outdated motherboard/other drivers.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	The settings were identical.	St
1.3.2	The mobo drivers are outdated (I am about to update them), but wouldn't that have affected the old card as well?	St
1.3.3	- Joe	St
1.4.1	a geforce ti-4200 is comparable to radeon 9600pro.	St
1.4.2	a geforce ti-4400 is a bit faster.	St
1.4.3	a radeon 9550 is a cut-back radeon 9600 so it will be noticeably slower than a ti-4400.	St
1.4.4	here are benchmarks which include the geforce ti-4200/4400 and radeon 9500/9600.	St
1.4.5	you can interpolate to estimate the performance of the ti-4400 and 9550. http://www.tomshardware.com/2004/10/04/vga_charts_iv/page7.html	St
