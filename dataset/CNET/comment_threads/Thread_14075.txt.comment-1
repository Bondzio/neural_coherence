I have a Samsung TS-H552 DVD+RW.
A website for the SPECS is http://www.overclockersclub.com/reviews/samsung_ts-h552_dvd_burner.php Now my problem is that the burner will allow me to read/write to CD's, but wont read/write DVD's.
Perhaps someone could help me?
My pc specs are as follows: Custom Built P3 1.31 GHZ NvIDIA GEFORCE 4 64MB Windows XP PRO 768 MB SDRAM More than enough to support the drive, i jsut need some help...thank you for your time.
