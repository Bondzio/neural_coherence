is there a web site you would recommend to help navigate through the process of understanding what upgrades are possible given a current motherboard?
i am in a similar situation to the earlier writers in this thread, want to upgrade a p4 3.0 ghz with ht, 925x mobo in a dell dimension 8400 and don't quite know where to start.
