<s> Hi guys.. i've previously got valuable info from the cnet community, and hope to get the same. </s>
<s> I purchased a SATA hard disk. </s>
<s> On my system, while formatting, the only option is to format it as a simple NTFS disk. </s>
<s> After fomatting computer management&gt; storage&gt; Disk management shows the disk as a simple volume and partition magic fails to recognize it. </s>
<s> However, i am able to access the hard disk normally. </s>
<s> On other systems, Partition magic fails to recognize it and computer management&gt; storage&gt; Disk management shows the drive as a dynamic disk. </s>
<s> Here the disk is not shown in &quot;my computer&quot; and i'm not able to access it. </s>
<s> Other attempts to format the disk results in formatting as a simple NTFS volume again. </s>
<s> Any solutions? </s>
<s> Thank You. </s>
<s> Sorry guys. </s>
<s> Its a IDE hard disk & not a SATA hard disk. </s>
<s> If Windows sees it then I suspect the drive is connected to a RAID IDE PORT or such. </s>
<s> You didn't tell all the details. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes Bob, the disk is connected to a RAID IDE PORT. </s>
<s> But the same works on my system, whereas doesn't work on any other system i tried on. </s>
<s> I tried partitioning the drive with partition magic, but with no luck. </s>
<s> Which other details am i supposed to list. </s>
<s> I'm sorry. </s>
<s> I'm not very well versed in this. </s>
<s> Thank you for your reply. </s>
<s> Since it works, what is the REAL ISSUE here? </s>
<s> Maybe you are asking about why Partition Magic doesn't work but I'm unsure. </s>
<s> I don't need or use Partition Magic since I can use what Windows or Linux offers. </s>
<s> This also saves me money since PM needs updates at times. </s>

<s> Hi bob, I'm sorry i dint mention what really i wanted. </s>
<s> I use the hard disk in 2 systems and it wasn't detecting in one of them. </s>
<s> The problem just got solved. </s>
<s> I partitioned the whole drive again while installing fedora and they are shown as primary partitions and logical partitions on windows, which wasn't the case earlier. </s>
<s> Thank you for your time Bob. </s>
<s> I really appreatiate it. </s>
<s> You look up GPARTED as a viable substitute for PM. </s>
<s> Glad you got it all to work out in spite of my replies. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
