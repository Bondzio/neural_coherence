1.1.1	Everyone talks about top of the line processors and video cards , but we do n't seem to & quot ; hear & quot ; ( pun intended ) as much about sound cards .	St
1.1.2	So , now I 'm asking you all -- who 's sound cards really rock ?	Ques
1.1.3	-JDM	St
1.2.1	also , Creative Labs is usually revered as the best BUT nVidia 's Soundstorm should not be forgotten ( only avliable on AthlonXP platforms ( it 's integrated ) Turtle Beach 's Riviera , Santa Cruz and Catalina are also nice cards , but offer a lower sampling rate ( CD quality , Creative offers 4x the sampling rate ) Personally I would stick with my Auidgy 2 ZS Platinum ( which afaik has been discontinued ... while the Audigy 2 ZS and Audigy 2 ZS Platinum Pro are still out ( ? ? ? ) )	Ques
1.2.2	the Audigy 2 and Audigy 2 ZS are great cards avoid the Audigy ES , and Audigy LS ( and the 2 ZS Value ) Turtle Beach is the best choice if your on a super tight budget , and want a sound card ( Which you buy to offload work from the CPU ) for professional cards you can look to M-Audio , E-MU , and higher from that I 'm not sure ( used to know the name of the Audio version of 3DLabs ( 3DLabs does n't have an audio branch , 3DLabs is a Creative company , but they are also like the super elite for professional stuff , and I used to know the super elite for audio too )	St
1.3.1	I 've been using Creative cards since I started building my own systems going on about ... 9 yrs .	St
1.3.2	or so .	St
1.3.3	Always been happy with them .	St
1.3.4	I currently use an Audigy SoundBlaster Platinum .	St
1.3.5	But no matter how good your soundcard , you ca n't neglect quality speakers .	St
1.3.6	I have a relatively cheap set of Logitech 5.1 speakers ( forget which model ... Z something ) ; cranked up , it rocks the walls .	St
1.3.7	That said , I 'm pretty impressed by some onboard sound on the newer motherboards .	St
1.3.8	My daughter has a cheap Biostar motherboard , and the sound was so good , I did n't even bother to put a soundcard in- it supports 5.1 sound also .	St
1.3.9	I 've heard good things about M-Audio also ; have one of their cards as a matter of fact , but never installed it .	St
1.3.10	I do n't think you can go wrong with Creative .	St
1.3.11	I have the internal bay for input/headphones etc- I think I chose this card when it came out simply cuz I thought having a remote would be cool .	St
1.3.12	It is , but I never use it , lol .	St
1.4.1	I 've always had Creative cards and been very happy with them .	St
1.4.2	I just thought I should get a few opinions concerning other makers .	St

1.9.1	yea i think creative is pretty much the standard .	St
1.9.2	i ended up going with an audigy 2 ZS and coming off of a super old stock SB 16 i think ti was that was a huge upgrade .	St
1.9.3	like ozo 's mentioned though i heard some good thinkg about turtle beach cards too .	St
1.9.4	thought about going taht way initially but decided not to .	St
1.10.1	Thanks for the comments !	St
1.10.2	JDM	St
1.11.1	Now who would you rank in second and third place ?	Ques
1.11.2	-JDM	St
1.12.1	Of course the best setup I can think of is a Sound Blaster Audigy 4 with an optical cable connected to a home theatre .	St
1.12.2	But I would have to say Chaintech makes a good second place .	St
1.12.3	Followed by Maya .	St
1.13.1	Wins the & quot ; budget card & quot ; category .	St
1.13.2	-JDM	St
