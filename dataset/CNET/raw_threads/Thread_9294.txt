Recently purchased new LCD flat panel and needed digital connection so purchased new graphics card - NVidia MX4400 by Asus. Installed card fine, no problems. In last two weeks have had crashes. First one said drivers bad for card and not acceptable to windows, so went to NVidia site and installed new drivers, had problems but finally got all working again. Crashed again tonight with following windows error &quot;STOP 0X000000EA THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVISE_DRIVER (Q293078). Finally got computer back up after three false starts of quitting in mid load and shutting down by itself. Choose go to last known good settings and finally got back up again. Do I have a defective card?

Even tried going back to old card but couldn't get it to work as it was still recognizing new card even after deleting drivers. Any good suggestions??

Also shows this mostly happens when Symantec PC Anywhere is installed. First off, I would completely uninstall the video card and drivers. Reboot and reinstall, being sure to disable any anti-virus (and PC Anywhere, if it is on the machine). Probably things are out of sequence. Also,LCDs have a native resolution. You don't a lot of choices like a CRT. Good luck. chuck
