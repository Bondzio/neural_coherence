hello arrow_0042000.
i replyed way back at the beginning of your post to your first question.
with so many replys (and a whole lot don't have a clue what they're talking about!
)it must have been a hard choice.
but i think you made the right one!
i just finished building a system for someone and the specs along with the prices follow.
and it's all in canadian dollars so add about 15% to the total for us price.
i don't think you overpaid a whole lot for your system or have you bought it yet?
to try to answer your new questions might be a little tough as a bit more info is needed but on the surface it looks like it should work for your needs.
however, it is going to depend on a few things not listed.
take a look at what i had to buy.
that is what you need to put a system together, parts wise.
what i built is a slighty above ''middle of the road'' system but it really flies.
you can research cnet on how to build a computer (or better yet, take their on-line course!)
or just google for instructions or ask for help like you just did.
anyway, i agree about your amd choice.
it's all i use.
i am a bit concerned however, with your power supply.
it might not be big enough to do all you want.
the more devices you add, the more power you need.
you also did not say if it's a sata or ide drive.plus you should have a floppy drive as you may need to download a program to a floppy so that the motherboard will recognize the larger drive (it's a windows thing!).
to answer the noise issue, it should be quite quiet.
the gaming issue i think is more of a personal one; a matter of choice.
as far as vista is concerned, newer is not always better.
i only use xp pro because it was built better for working with media than 98 was.
i prefer 98 otherwise i would still have 98 on my main computer.
i use 98 on all my others.
vista is going to have a tremendous amount of bugs to start off, as did all the other releases of windows.
i usually wait at lease a year or more to change operating systems (if i do!).
anyway, go over my list of what i had to buy to build a computer and if you want or need more help building it, just post a message or you can e-mail me direct (see my profile).
hope this helps.
lloyd.
