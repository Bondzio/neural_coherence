my cable contract allows me to connect to multiple systems on my premises only.
intentionally sharing with a neighbor (if discovered) would be a contract violation, and could result in termination of service.
of course, if the neighbor were tapping in without my permission, i should be off the hook.
but then in florida, some parts of calif., and possibly in some other areas, he could then be charged with theft of services.
so, it all depends -- frank
