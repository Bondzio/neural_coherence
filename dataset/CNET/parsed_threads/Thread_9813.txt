<s> Hi, Is there any practical differnce between a drive described as &quot;pocket&quot; versus a similar drive described as &quot;External&quot;?. </s>
<s> I once heard that the Pockets are designed to be sturdier, since they are intended to be carried around, hence the &quot;pocket&quot; term, whereas the externals are a bit more fragile, and not really designed for portability.However, I only saw that comment one time so I am not very confident about its legitimacy. </s>
<s> Any confirmation or clarification will be appreciated. </s>
<s> &quot;pocket&quot; to me means maybe you can put it in your pocket (small). </s>
<s> Studier has got nothing to do with it. </s>
