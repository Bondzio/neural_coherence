Almost half price of right this moment's price. However recently while I am researching about dell computer, I found out that quality of dell computer parts are really low and they are using cheap parts. Return policy period is not past and I kept every boxes and every parts of set. Thus I am able to return the product. Do you guys think that I should return the computer?

If you go around the web you will find a 1000 post bitching about Dell. Why is that?......................Dell sells a gazillion machines. I'm looking at a couple of year old Dell desktop.......works fine.

The only way to get a zoot kick butt whiz bang set up is to BUILD IT YOURSELF, which many of us do or spend a bunch of loot and get an ALIENWARE UNIT...or the alternative go to MAC.

IMHO, Dell uses the same parts except for the mtrbd. that everyone else uses. Sure, they buy in bulk, but so does everyone else. Unless, your Dell falls apart, then it's just as good as any other OEM based PC out there. If you want, check 3rd party builders and check prices. Also, remember you get the s/w bundle and OWS which in many cases a huge hunk of the purchase, so beware of other vendors that offer a PC, yet you pay extra at least for the OS or its a billable item. tada -----Willy

I got the fact that Dell's parts are same with any other OEM computers, but how about compare with &quot;Building my own computer.&quot; If prices are equal, for sure, quality of built computer will be better compare to manufactured computer, but how much different? Because I also considering about building my own computer with money i receive from dell if i return the desktop. What you guys think?
