1.1.1	My system is no punk but could use a good boost for gaming .	St
1.1.2	O.k .	St
1.1.3	so , my specs are as follows : Amd64 3000+ ( Venice no oc ) 2 GB geil dual channel pc3200 Asrock 939-dual ( pci and agp ) 256mb ati aiw x800 agp 2 x 160 GB Seagate drives Lite-on dual layer dvd-rw Lite-on DVD-ROM Blah , blah , blah So what I am wondering is , say Im limited to about a 500.00 upgrade which way should I go ?	Ques
1.1.4	I mean I love my all-in-wonder but should I go with a newer gaming card and run both ( agp and pci ) or do I really need more ram ( 4gb seems excessive ) .	St
1.1.5	Or the motherboard does support the dual core CPUs .	St
1.1.6	Any input is appreciated .	Polite
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Before I begin , that machine looks solid : Good Job !	St
1.2.2	Let 's go !	St
1.2.3	I 'm gon na skip the CPU and talk abt in the end .	St
1.2.4	The 2GB is good , very good actually .	Polite
1.2.5	Storage/Removable storage looks good .	Polite
1.2.6	For clarifcation , this is your motherboard , correct : http : //www.asrock.com/product/939Dual-SATA2.htm Motherboard looks good , I like the hybridish combination of AGP and PCI-e. ( btw , is that a typo in the mobo description ? )	Ques
1.2.7	The only thing that is n't very very best in it 's field is just the CPU and GPU .	St
1.2.8	If you are getting solid numbers in games , I would upgrade the CPU .	St
1.2.9	If it is sluggish in non-gpu intensive apps , like uh ... word ?	Ques
1.2.10	( lol ) jk , but you know that I mean , right ?	Ques
1.2.11	Also , whats the wattage , make , and maybe rails of the PSU ?	Ques
1.2.12	Name and series would work , too .	St
1.2.13	A reasonable upgrade for the mobo would be either semi-entry line X2 , maybe the 4200+ or if you look hard enough , you could squeeze in a 4400+ .	St
1.2.14	( Mobo does support X2 ) I think they have the same clock , not sure though .	St
1.2.15	Think it is more advanced in other things .	St
1.2.16	Anyways , if you get a GPU I 'd go for a 7800GT , easily in your budget .	St
1.2.17	Or do want to buy both a GPU and a CPU ?	Ques
1.2.18	Otherwise , the machine looks good .	St
1.2.19	Good luck , and remember in the end : Its your call .	St
1.2.20	~Ibrahim~	St
1.3.1	Yes that is the board and I thought that was a neat feature myself .	St
1.3.2	they can be used together believe it or not , one for editing ( aiw ) one for gaming ( hmmm ) at the same time as I understand it .	St
1.3.3	I had not thought of the psu , it 's some off brand 480w that came with my transformers case ( yes , I am that geek with the autobot case ) .	St
1.3.4	unfortunatly i am pretty sure i 'm limited to either a cpu or the gpu ( i think i 'll upgrade the psu no matter what ) .	St
1.3.5	so i know it 's up to me in the end but if it was your system and your money which would you choose ?	Ques
1.4.1	i found a 4200 x2 and a 7800gt both for around 680.00 , not sure if i can pull another 180.00 out of nowhere though .	St
