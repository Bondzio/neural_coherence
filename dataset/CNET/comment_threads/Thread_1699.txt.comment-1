I am about to build my first PC (attempt really but being positive) and wanted to get some feedback on what I have came up with so far.
I am working with a limited budget and chose my components based on being able to add &quot;more&quot; later when money is not so tight.
Basically I am going for a mid-low high end gaming PC that has some customization options for the future.
Motherboard and CPU - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4179115&CatId=3586 Memory - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3404049&Sku=O261-8038 HDD - also use a 500GB ext.
for media http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3255389&CatId=2458 CD/DVD - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3970770&Sku=L12-1166%20OEM Power Supply - I am curious about this one and what you all would suggest.
Since I wasn't sure I made room for a 750w power supply.

From what I understand 32 only uses 3GB and recognizes the other 1GB as &quot;virtual memory&quot; if I have this fouled up please explain.
Also since I fully plan to upgrade later to the full 8GB that the mobo allows it seemed like the best choice.
Ok so let her rip and let me hear it, have I covered everything?
Would you make different choices and if so why?
I appreciate any and all help in this matter since I am very excited at the prospect of building my first &quot;rig&quot;, and am somewhat anxious to get underway with the contruction.
