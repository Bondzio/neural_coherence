i would prefer to build my own.
but can't afford everything i want in a desktop.
so buy dell and then upgrade later( memory,graphics).
there prices are within my budget.
i have never had a problem with my dells (laptop and desktop)that i can't fix myself.
i haven't had any yet.
the laptop is a year old, desktop 5 years.
