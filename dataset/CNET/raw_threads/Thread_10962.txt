Does anyone have any experience with Netgear's WGE111 gaming adapter? Its configured for 802.11g at up to 54 Mps. I am looking at this one because of our current network setup. Dell computers (one withXP Home and the other with XP Media for OS) Comcast broadband Netgear wireless router, WPN 824 (802.11g/MIMO). Main computer is hardwired to the network while the other has WPN111 USB wireless compatible to WPN824. Currently network is configured with WPA encryption. The wireless computer is often used to play WOW and will compete with other computer and XBox for bandwidth. My concerns are: Compatability of gaming adapter. (I expect staying with Netgear should cover that even though the adapter is strictly 802.11g - Yes?) Bandwidth sufficiency. Netgear works well with XBox? Any comments would be appreciated. Thanks, Jim

That particular adapter is not listed as compatible with the xbox, however, any ethernet bridge will &quot;work&quot;. By work I mean it will connect you to the live service. However, depending on range and environmental factors, you may notice some lag. There are adapters that are specifically adjusted to reduce lag time on the service. I can tell you from experience that people who lag on Live are picked off and hated for &quot;teleporting&quot;. The best solution is, of course to run the system wired, but if that is not possible make sure you get an adapter that is Live compatible. With an MIMO router, bandwidth and sharing with the other wireless computer shouldn't be an issue. Hope that helps.

I hate the thought of wired (another network outlet to put in and wire) although it does have the advantage of avoiding interference. Boys do get lag playing WOW now but that may because they have too many programs running simultaneously on their PC. Today I get to clean their startup menu to see if that helps. Thanks again. Jim

Most computers should be able to handle WOW without too much trouble with anotehr program running in the background as long as you have good quality memory and a good quality graphics/sound card. The bottleneck may either be your service (Cable slows down with increased traffic in the area) or your router.

Today I cut down on the startup programs through msconfig. I'll see how that works and cut more if it helps. They won't like it but the parental controls (MacAfee) stays on. I don't think the lag should be the router/wireless USB as they are capable of 108 Mbps which is almost twenty times the broadband connection rate (6 Mbps) which should cover the bandwidth consumption between multiple computers in-house, encryption, etc. Computer memory may make some difference as their computer has 784 MB of RAM along with a GeForce 5500 with 256 MB onboard. CPU is 1.4 GHz which should be fine for WOW. I'll see how the startup config works before looking at more memory. By the way, I decided to go hardwire on the XBox setup. For about $10 bucks I picked up two Cat5e female connectors, cable, wall outlet boxes and faceplates. I am simply going to wire from the office through the wall to the game room and connect via cable. Already have the junction cable put together and tested. Tomorrow I'll install the outlets in the wall for the cable hookup. Thanks for your help. Jim
