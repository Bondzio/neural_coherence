my computer is gone.
unfortunately, while i was waiting to get into college, i was staying at this very bad place and it got very hot and even when my computer wasn't on or plugged in but i lost everything (but i still have everything backed up so i can re-install everything again) and when i tried to do that, it crashed once again.
is it too late to do anything about this?
am i wasting my time?
am i going to have to replace it??
it is a compaq with memory card readers.
right now the fans turn on high and all it has is a blank screen where the &quot;windows xp&quot; loading thing should be at.
i probably need to replace my samsung color laser printer.
look at the items on my profile for pictures of what they look like.
at least i don't have to get an entire system since i have a mouse & keyboard & 19&quot; lcd monitor.
