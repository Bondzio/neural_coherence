1.1.1	Hi My computer is 3 years old and I am thinking of getting a new one but I am considering two options .	St
1.1.2	I have some idea about what goes on inside the case and am pretty sure that I could break the comp down and build it back up .	St
1.1.3	I have removed and reinseted my modem , my video card , my burner and I have installed a new hard drive and have dual booted my system ( not anymore though , cause I have a new scanner and do n't need Win ME for my scanner ) .	St
1.1.4	I want to use back some parts from my old machine : 1. modem 2. hard drives ( I have two of them ) 3 .	St
1.1.5	I have a 32MX Nivda card , and I think that its good for me .	St
1.1.6	I think thats about it I want to get some new parts 1 .	St
1.1.7	Upgrade from a 1.3 GHz to something faster ( not sure what speed is best ) 2 .	St
1.1.8	I have 2 x 64MB RD-RAM .	St
1.1.9	Need new RAM not sure what brand ?	Ques
1.1.10	3 .	St
1.1.11	DVD/CD-Burner So I think that its time for a new comp and was wondering which method is cheaper and why I should choose to buy or build my system .	St
1.2.1	This question is full of more questions .	St
1.2.2	The goals of building it yourself must be revealed as well as if you are your own best support .	St
1.2.3	Keeping in mind what you wrote and that you may get to reinstall the OS since Microsoft does n't handle motherboard changes well , you could look at some motherboard+CPU+HSF+PowerSupply+RAM to move up to what you feel you want .	St
1.2.4	Keep in mind that all the old parts will run at the same old speed .	St
1.2.5	There is no & quot ; best & quot ; in the CPU brand , so you choose AMD or Intel and move on .	St
1.2.6	For me , it 's AMD 's 64-bit or some Intel CPU since I 've tired of dealing with the Athlon ( non-64-bit ) heat issues .	St
1.2.7	As to RAM , no current boards take RDRAM , so you 'll get new sticks to match .	St
1.2.8	And DVD-/+RW drives are plentiful .	St
1.2.9	Just make sure you get bundled recording software .	Sug
1.2.10	Bob Bob	St
1.3.1	IMO .	St
1.3.2	If you build it then you are the support .	St
1.3.3	Can you handle that ?	Ques
1.3.4	If someone else builds it and it does not work then it is their headache .	St
1.3.5	As for cost , it is tough to beat some of the pkg deals .	St
1.4.1	Stan : I am not an expert by any means , but I have built a computer .	St
1.4.2	I did it just to see if I could .	St
1.4.3	It was a great experience and I learned a lot from it .	St
1.4.4	If you think you are going to save money by building , forget it .	St
1.4.5	You can buy Dell , eMachines , etc .	St
1.4.6	a lot cheaper .	St
1.4.7	If you like tinkering , build your own .	St
1.4.8	There are dozens of sites on the web that have advice on building .	St
1.4.9	Do some research , read some forums , then decide .	St
1.4.10	You will need a Case , a good Power supply , a Motherboard , CPU w/heatsink and fan , new RAM , and a Phillips head screwdrive .	St
1.4.11	BTW , the RD Ram is probably out , but save it .	St
1.4.12	Older Gateway users may have use for it .	St
1.4.13	If you have all the Program CD 's from your present computer , and they are not proprietory , you can install them on the new rig and save some money .	St
1.4.14	Otherwise , you will have to buy new software .	St
1.4.15	I do n't mean to discourage you from building , but as an example , my home built cost me around $ 900 US .	St
1.4.16	and it 's just a 1.83Ghz .	St
1.4.17	I could have bought a Dell for $ 400 US and maybe got a new Printer thrown in .	St
1.4.18	But then I would not have had the fun of building .	St
1.4.19	Good luck Hal	Polite
1.5.1	I am going to buy a cheap customized dell without a modem , soundcard , ( i 'll get a better video cad ) and without an Operating system or hard drive .	St
1.5.2	I have all the software I 'll ever need so thats why I did n't want to get a brand new comp .	St
1.5.3	My main motivation was saving money .	St
1.5.4	I get all my support from this forum and from the net so I do n't really care much about getting support from dell .	St
1.5.5	So does my plan sound like it make sense .	St
1.5.6	?	Ques
1.6.1	Stan the man , I 'm actually at the same cross roads .	St
1.6.2	My machine is old and very slow compared to todays standards but it treats me good .	St
1.6.3	I update and upgrade some components but somtimes feel as though i 'm spinning my wheels .	St
1.6.4	Think of the Future whats gon na come out next ?	Ques
1.6.5	Your gon na want to build an expandable computer .	St
1.6.6	1 ) .	St
1.6.7	Get a quality case w/500watt power supply 2 ) .	St
1.6.8	Asus P4C800 motherboard or the comparable intel board both have the i875P chipset .	St
1.6.9	3 ) .CPU whatever you prefer this board can handle over 3ghz .	St
1.6.10	I 'd stay w/ hyperthreading Technology .	St
1.6.11	4 ) .	St
1.6.12	Quality hard drive ( seagate , western digital ) 7200 rpm , capacity is your preference .	St
1.6.13	I 've priced out a dream system for close to $ 1000 but you can build a very good system thats fully expandable from $ 600- $ 800 .	St
1.6.14	The best part about doing it yourself is its your creation .	St
1.6.15	Asus provides good support if you have problems but these forums are the best way to solve issues you may encounter .	St
1.6.16	Do your homework and enjoy .	Polite
1.7.1	Thanks alot but that sounds like too much trouble when I can buy a cheap dell and move the good parts from my old comp into the new one .	St
1.8.1	Well Stan , I did n't know you could get a Dell without a OS , and Hard Drive .	St
1.8.2	You can get a Dell with integrated sound and video , but I would suggest a Dell MB with a sound card and a Video Card more capable than the MX you have .	St
1.8.3	Dell selling without sound & video ?	Ques
1.8.4	Please let us know how you are ordering this Dell sans a OS , HD , Sound & Video .	St
1.9.1	It would depend on how much you have to pay for this Dell .	St
1.9.2	What about Shipping Charges ?	Ques
1.9.3	I was not aware that what you are trying to buy is available .	St
1.9.4	I would also check with a local dealer and compare prices .	St
1.9.5	Either way , good luck Hal	Polite
1.10.1	just curious , just how easy will it be to put non-dell stuff into a dell ?	Ques
1.10.2	I have no direct experience with them but when I help friends who own dells and gateways it always seems like the companies tell me & quot ; you ca n't add that component to the system unless you buy one of ours. & quot ; you 're married to them and their bios downloads and whatnot .	St
1.10.3	.	St
1.10.4	.	St
1.10.5	any real mucking about ( like overclocking ) can void the warranty real fast and you 're back here talking to us !	St
1.10.6	( not that there 's anything wrong with that ) in my experience , my home built computers are more expensive to start but they are a lot more expandable ( at least in the near run , before the whole system becomes obsolete ) in terms of adding cards and drives and so on .	St
1.10.7	.	St
1.10.8	.	St
1.10.9	and what can I say , I love messing around with this stuff .	St
1.10.10	-- fj	St
1.11.1	First of all , you should n't do ANYTHING if you are n't prepared to solve unexpected problems .	St
1.11.2	So , the answer to your question is & quot ; maybe & quot ; .	St
1.11.3	It depends on some other factors .	St
1.11.4	Like , are you A+ certified ?	Ques
1.11.5	If not , why ?	Ques
1.11.6	Do you not have the knowledge to pass the cert test ?	Ques
1.11.7	You should n't even be attempting it if any of these answers are & quot ; no & quot ; .	St
1.11.8	The reason being you may do something wrong and ruin the brand new components you 've purchased .	St
1.11.9	Or you may mess things up to the point that you have to pay a tech to fix it anyway .	St
1.11.10	I would say , if you have the knowledge , prove it .	St
1.11.11	Get certified .	St
1.11.12	Then build a system .	St
1.11.13	At a Microsoft TechNet meeting I attended a few months ago , the Microsoft rep giving the lecture was giving some acronyms they had made up .	St
1.11.14	One of them is a & quot ; STITE & quot ; , meaning a & quot ; Self Taught IT Expert & quot ; .	St
1.11.15	By reading some of the advise given in these forums , I would venture to say that probably around 60 % of those giving advise are indeed & quot ; STITES & quot ; .	St
1.11.16	They have little knowledge of what they are saying , and following their advise would be foolish .	St
1.11.17	Per my A+ book ( yes , I have my cert , as well as N+ , Windows 2000 Professional , and Windows 2000 Advanced Server certs along with a college degree in Computer Science ) , the main point to consider when you build your own is this ; YOU ARE the technical support .	St
1.11.18	You ca n't call Compaq or whoever when you have a problem .	St
1.11.19	That is why you MUST know EXACTLY what you are doing .	St
1.11.20	Otherwise you will end up paying someone like me to fix it .	St
1.11.21	The biggest advantage to building your own is you get to chose what you want in your computer .	St
1.11.22	You can get a motherboard where the NIC , video , sound , and other components are n't integrated into the motherboard .	St
1.11.23	Also , you buy the components at a computer supplier or wherever , so when it goes out , you can go to the same store and buy another one .	St
1.11.24	Compare that to Compaq , Dell , HP , and others that are using integrated parts as well as proprietary parts .	St
1.11.25	There computers are cheaper to buy , but there is a reason .	St
1.11.26	Say the power supply goes out after a few years .	St
1.11.27	Dell likes to use a proprietary power supply that has a unique shape .	St
1.11.28	That way when it goes , you have to call Dell and buy a new one at whatever price they want to charge you ( usually two to three times more than a generic power supply ) .	St
1.11.29	Many of the manufacturers are putting out systems that do n't allow you to disable the onboard sound , video , or whatever .	St
1.11.30	That way , when the part goes , you must order a new motherboard ( they are hoping from them ) .	St
1.11.31	That is why they are so cheap .	St
1.11.32	Anyway , the answer to your question is & quot ; how much do you know ? & quot ;	Ques
1.12.1	Hey stan .	St
1.12.2	I personally have built my own computer and bought from a major OEM .	St
1.12.3	I actually found that building your own computer was quite a bit cheaper and not to say the least ... fun .	St
1.12.4	You have the ability to buy parts at the cheapest prices from verified resellers such as newegg.com and zipzoomfly.com .	St
1.12.5	If you dont decide to purchase parts online , you can shop in your local store and look for sales .	St
1.12.6	Besides , it 's a great feeling to put all your components together and have your system work lol .	St
1.12.7	One thing to watch out for is bad parts .	St
1.12.8	If you buy online , then you have to go through the whole process of sending the parts back , and they will often charge you a small fee .	St
1.12.9	If you buy from stores such as Fry 's Electronics , Best Buy , CompUSA , etc .	St
1.12.10	then the process is simplified quite a bit .	St
1.12.11	You have stated that your computer is 3 years old .	St
1.12.12	What are the current specifications of your computer ?	Ques
1.12.13	For example , the cpu that you would like rated at 1.3 Ghz may not be compatible with your current motherboard etc .	St
1.12.14	In addition , you have to make the choices between major brands such as Intel and AMD .	St
1.12.15	Weigh your choices and choose .	St
1.12.16	You currently dont know what RAM to get .	St
1.12.17	There are different types of ram such as RDRAM , SDRAM , DDR SDRAM etc .	St
1.12.18	These days , DDR RAM is pretty cheap as well as SDRAM .	St
1.12.19	You have to know what your motherboard supports before you go off and buy new RAM .	St
1.12.20	I suggest that either 256 or 512 MB of RAM would be enough for your everyday applications .	St
1.12.21	What do you plan to use your computer for ?	Ques
1.12.22	If for example , you just need it to do the basics of word processing and spreadsheets then you wont need top of the line components .	St
1.12.23	If you game or run graphic intensive programs , think about buying higher end components and more memory .	St
1.12.24	When you buy an optical Drive such as a DVD/DVD Burner/CD Burner , then the minimum speficiations are generally located on the box .	St
1.12.25	I personally think that you should drop Windows ME as it has shown a great deal of instability , however , some people like that OS .	St
1.12.26	I hope I have helped you stan .	St
1.12.27	If not , turn to the other users of this board .	St
1.13.1	It sounds like a good idea , just watch out for some differences .	St
1.13.2	For example , my DELL Hard Drive had an IDE cable with some of the wires switched .	St
1.13.3	This ensures that any new hard drive you put on wont work .	St
1.13.4	At least I think so .	St
1.13.5	I 'm not an expert .	St
1.14.1	I agree with what was said here .	St
1.14.2	I looked at many packages , none seemed to have quite what I wanted , building my own ( with some help from a tech friend ) taught me a fair bit and I am now a lot more confident about future re-builds .	St
1.14.3	It did'nt really save me money , I shopped around a lot on the net and at computer fairs , but I enjoyed it and do now understand more about what goes on inside a computer .	St
1.15.1	Stan , Dell will not sell a computer without an operating system .	St
1.15.2	So , you have no choice other than building your own if you want try using your own software .	St
1.15.3	If you are using Windows XP , you will not be able to activate it over the internet .	St
1.15.4	You will have to call in and take your chances .	St
1.15.5	I have found that Dell is extremely competitive with low end machines , but if you are building a higher end machine , you can save money by building your own .	St
1.15.6	That 's where they make their profits .	St
1.15.7	There are some mail order sites where you can buy hardware at virtually wholesale prices .	St
1.15.8	But watch out for excessive shipping and special charges .	St
1.15.9	Buy a new hard drive .	St
1.15.10	THey are cheap .	St
1.15.11	Your modem is about the only thing I would save .	St
1.15.12	Maybe your case and power supply are salvagable .	St
1.15.13	I assume you have an ATX Powersupply with the extra power connectors for either Intel or AMD CPU 's ?	Ques
1.15.14	If not , get a decent powersupply .	St
1.15.15	Do n't fall for those 450 watt PS for $ 9.99 ads !	St
1.15.16	As far as AMD vs Intel goes , I prefer Intel .	St
1.15.17	I personally only use Intel motherboards and Intel CPUs .	St
1.15.18	However , standing up for one or the other is somewhat like attacking a religion .	St
1.15.19	People support their favorites with religous fervor !	St
1.15.20	I believe you can build a good system for a fair price and have a lot of fun doing it .	St
1.15.21	There is one bit of technical advice I want to give you : The order of software installation is - 1 ) load the OS , 2 ) load the motherboard drivers ( THe disk that comes with the motherboard ) and finally , install any other required drivers such as the video card drivers .	St
1.15.22	If you use an Nvidia based video card , get the latest driver from their site .	St
1.15.23	They offer a unified driver that suports their entire family of graphics products .	St
1.15.24	Good luck	Polite
1.16.1	I have just had a new computer built .	St
1.16.2	Used the following components : Plextor 708A CD/DVD burner Pentium 4 2.8E GHz & quot ; Prescott & quot ; 1MB KingMax 512MB PC-3200 DDR400 SDRAM ASUS P4P800-E-DLX Intel 865PE , 800MHz FSB , Dual DDR400 Very pleased with the machine .	St
1.17.1	Well , Stan , I 'd like to say , in defense of all us STITE 's out here , that the proof is ALWAYS in the pudding .	St
1.17.2	While certs look really nice on your wall and your resume , they wo n't do you a lot of good if you do n't need them to get your job done .	St
1.17.3	In addition , many of the certs are easily bought today , so having one does n't necessarily reflect what you know .	St
1.17.4	Lots of good old & quot ; hands on & quot ; experience , however , is , IMHO , the key to knowledge .	St
1.17.5	So please do n't be discouraged by the first paragraph in ereedks post .	Sug
1.17.6	Instead , pay close attention to what he/she says in the second paragraph of the post .	St
1.17.7	The last sentence of the post is key , & quot ; how much do you know ? & quot ; Be realistic about your knowledge limitations , ask as many knowledgeable people as you can , verify answers to your questions with others , and , most importantly , learn as much as you can about the components you plan to use ( starting with the motherboard ) BEFORE you buy .	St
1.17.8	In my experience , building your own is definitely NOT cheaper than buying a pre-built system , but , as has been said many times here , you can avoid the problems associated with integrated and proprietary components as well as get exactly what you want in your system .	St
1.17.9	And , if you 're careful and do well , you may just eventually gain enough knowledge to become a proud STITE yourself !	St
1.17.10	Much luck to you !	Polite
1.18.1	You wo n't save much money by building your own , reason being builders like Dell get their parts in huge quantities much cheaper than you will be able to buy them .	St
1.18.2	Building your own is fun and you get exactly what you want .	St
1.18.3	Keep in mind , the most expensive parts of any computer are the processor and the RAM .	St
1.18.4	Suggest for your first build , you buy a so-called & quot ; bare bones & quot ; system from any number of online suppliers .	St
1.18.5	They get the same big discounts as Dell so you are not disadvantaged going this route .	St
1.18.6	You 'll get the case/powersupply/fans/motherboard/processor/heatsink , all compatible and all assembled and tested .	St
1.18.7	Your old RAM wo n't work so you should probably buy your RAM from the barebones supplier .	St
1.18.8	Do the research and compare bare bones packages terms of cost and processor speed , get the best motherboard money can buy ( they 're cheap ) and then add video/audio/modems etc .	St
1.18.9	depending on which on board features you have on the motherboard .	St
1.18.10	Add drives of your choice and you 're done .	St
1.18.11	For an operating system , suggest buy and OEM version of Windows XP for about $ 100 .	St
1.19.1	Ok Stan Before I disperse my STITE knowledge , I feel that you should know I am one of those people that think experience leads to understanding what you 're talking about .	St
1.19.2	But a good degree is obviously better looking in an interview .	St
1.19.3	So then ; I have built all the computers I have ever owned from bits and pieces of other computers .	St
1.19.4	They have all turned out to be good machines for the time I had them .	St
1.19.5	( approx .	St
1.19.6	5 machines ) I chose what parts to use .	St
1.19.7	Whether or not I needed to change a part ; and that was all pretty simple .	St
1.19.8	Building a PC is alot easier than most people think .	St
1.19.9	It 's kinda like a labeled jigsaw puzzle .	St
1.19.10	( if you have a motherboard diagram ) BUT , if there was ever a problem , I had to figure it out my self .	St
1.19.11	I was always taking care of the computers .	St
1.19.12	They never seemed to work how I wanted , when I wanted .	St
1.19.13	It was a major hassle .	St
1.19.14	Then , for graduation , my dad bought me a Gateway PC .	St
1.19.15	I got to choose certain parts over other brand names , but that 's about all the customizing I could do .	St
1.19.16	When it finally came in , all that was required of me was to plug everything in and turn it on .	St
1.19.17	This was very nice .	Polite
1.19.18	Now my computer was virtually free of the problems I had before ... untill I installed my programs .	St
1.19.19	Then I had some of the same problems , and some new .	St
1.19.20	I had a file manager stuck on my desktop for a while , and I figured that my Tech Support I paid for would help me out .	St
1.19.21	I was WRONG .	St
1.19.22	Help Desks , Tech Support , they all pretty much stink .	St
1.19.23	Granted they are getting better , but they could not solve my problems .	St
1.19.24	For the prices I paid to get that 3-year warranty , have my PC shipped , and the PC itself ( not to mention the customization I did later on ) I could have built my own PC , FULLY customized to my liking , and ended up with the same problems .	St
1.19.25	Building your own PC can be cheep .	St
1.19.26	Buying a PC from Dell , Gateway , HP , etc .	St
1.19.27	can be cheep .	St
1.19.28	It all depends not on how much you know , but do you understand what you will get either way .	St
1.19.29	Build your own : Get what you want ; some online places it 's cheep ; no tech support ; you know what 's there ; may have limited warranty on individual parts ( varies ) ; if there 's a problem , you fix it Buy from & quot ; Big Company & quot ; : may get what you want ; can be much cheeper than building yourself ; some tech support ; warranty on all parts ; you may not be able to upgrade from other than & quot ; Big Company & quot ; ; some problems tech support ca n't fix better than you can .	St
1.19.30	I recomend building it yourself IF you have the knowledge to fix the problems that will arise or have a buddy that does .	St
1.19.31	It is fun , and a great experience as we move into the & quot ; computers run the world & quot ; era .	St
1.19.32	But if you are just some average joe that goes to work everyday , and plays with his kids , has BBQ parties and likes relaxing while fishing-and you think it would be interesting to build a PC because it would , then find a friend who will let you help build his .	St
1.19.33	You 'll get the same experience , but wo n't have to deal with the problems .	St
1.20.1	From my own experience , for low-end to mid-range PC 's , the better value are prebuilts .	St
1.20.2	But for bleeding-edge gamer/graphics systems , I can build systems with top-of-the-line components ( thanks NewEgg ) hundreds cheaper than what Alienware or Falcon Northwest can put out .	St
1.20.3	But irrespective of what kind of system you buy or build , I would encourage you to strive to be the best STITE you can be .	St
1.20.4	As lvfinch noted , & quot ; hands on & quot ; experience is the key .	St
1.20.5	Do n't be turned-off from building your own system just because you lack the & quot ; papers & quot ; .	St
1.20.6	As a self-confessed STITE since the Intel 8088 days ( padded with a Computer Science & Engineering degree , and well over a decade of IT work experience ) , you do n't need certification to build your own computer .	St
1.20.7	I 've built a fair amount of systems for myself and others , and along the way I 've & quot ; burnt & quot ; some components .	St
1.20.8	But you learn and get better .	St
1.20.9	What with the Internet , peruse the many Modz and Overclocker sites to garner knowledge and understanding .	St
1.20.10	I 'll bet most Modders and OC 's do n't have and do n't need certification .	St
1.20.11	But do purchase one of those & quot ; Build your own System & quot ; books to fill-in the holes .	St
1.20.12	Also , do your research before buying any component .	St
1.20.13	As there are so many variants out there , compatibility is a big issue .	St
1.20.14	Lastly , seriously consider upgrade-ability .	St
1.20.15	What with the upcoming PCI-X format , many of todays components will be obsolete in regards to performance .	St
1.20.16	Once these new boards are out , my next system will be an AMD 64 running Linux-64 .	St
1.21.1	I have built many computers and consistantly find that if I need all the parts ( and software ) it is a lot cheaper to buy a fully assembled computer .	St
1.21.2	If you want to reuse the parts you listed you can build your own computer and save some money although a bare bones computer with Memory , MB and Cpu will probably be cheaper then buying the parts seperately .	St
1.21.3	You can easily check this out on line with some of the larger online retailers .	St
1.22.1	Think first about your budget and what you want your new pc to do .	St
1.22.2	Buying a new pc will be easier and more cost effective in the short run , especially if you do n't do much besides word processing , internet and older games , but you may still have a machine that 's behind the times .	St
