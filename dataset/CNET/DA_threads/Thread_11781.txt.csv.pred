1.2.1	There is no solution for you .	St

1.3.1	It appears your flash drive is n't supported by the 'school system ' as it was n't installed on it .	St
1.3.2	It just is n't generic enough to be accepted , though I 'm sure a plain flash drive is .	St
1.3.3	See , if the school will allow an install so you can proceed , if not see what products are supported .	St
1.3.4	It may mean the school system needs to be updated as a possible another source of the problem .	St
1.3.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	My teacher said that they do n't have much more rights then we do , and we tried it with the teacher and it did the same thing .	St
1.4.2	= ' [ .	St
1.4.3	Is there any alterations that I could make to the flash drive and not the computer ?	Ques
1.4.4	I can run programs just not install them .	St
1.5.1	also* generic flash drives do work on these , but this is 10x more not likely to be stolen if I leave it in my computer class .	St
