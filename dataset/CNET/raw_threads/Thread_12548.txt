BIG THANKS TO ANYONE THAT CAN HELP

Since it works, the printer prints they may leave such a bug unfixed. This can upset those that have no history with MSFT. Ok, one idea. MANUALLY clear the print queue. Here's a google on that. But my thought is if it is printing, why fix this? http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Clear+Printer+Spool+Queue Bob

Upon doing so I noted that the printer status window still showed that there was &quot;1&quot; document, although none listed in the queue. It appears to me that the OS is creating something that is put &quot;first in line&quot; before my document Ultimately, MY document never printed from the laptop. (no problems printing from the desktop) I hope my attempt at this clarification is helpful. Thanks again.
