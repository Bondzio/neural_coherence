It worked fine until I moved a computer to another room and tried to resume the net. Nothing works. One computer recognizes one other but the other two won't recognize either. Someone suggested I disable the firewall, which I did, but no help. He also suggested I ping, but I don't know how to do this. I have run thru the set-up procedure many times and tried all the different ways. I'm using a Netgear model #FS605 If any more info is needed please let me know and I'll try to furnish it. Thanks

From the command prompt you can type &quot;ipconfig&quot; to view the computer's IP address, or &quot;ping &lt;address&gt;&quot; to ping another computer. First, use ipconfig to determine the IP address of each system, and write them all down (the IP address should begin with &quot;10.&quot; or &quot;192.168.&quot; - as a side note, your default gateway should begin with the same digits and generally end in &quot;.1&quot;). The IP addresses of the computers should be the same except for the last octet, i.e. 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, etc. If they're different (192.168.0.2, 192.168.1.3, 10.0.100.2) then you have a configuration problem. If any computer has an IP address beginning with &quot;169.&quot;, this is a default Windows-assigned address which indicates that the system can't talk to your router to get an IP address. Provided all the IPs are correct, go to each computer and try to ping all the other computers; for example, if computer B is &quot;192.168.1.3&quot;, you would go to computer A and type &quot;ping 192.168.1.3&quot; and hit enter. You should get four lines beginning with &quot;Reply from 192.168.1.3:&quot; - if you get &quot;Request timed out&quot;, &quot;Destination net unreachable&quot;, or another error, either something's not connected, or one of the computers isn't configured properly. If you are getting &quot;Request timed out&quot;, it may indicate the Windows firewall or another security program is active - check the Security Center in each computer's control panel, &quot;Windows Firewall&quot; should be off (even though it will complain that it's not recommended... your router is acting as a firewall and makes the Windows Firewall redundant and next to useless). Please reply and let me know if these tips helped. If you still aren't able to connect, let me know what your ping responses/error messages were and I can try to help you out some more
