I'm planning on building my first computer soon and I was wondering if it is possible to have Windows installed on a small capacity hdd and store all of my data on a second large capacity hdd? Thanks. P.s. For example: Using a WD Raptor 36gb that has windows. and' Using a 200gb hdd for all of the data and files. Thank you again.
