You got all thos goodies stuffed into the system, you bet you're generating heat.
Even with all those case fans, they still need to exhaust all the hot air, as some get stuck between HDs, CDs drives and such due to spacing, wire harnesses, and plain bad air flow.
Open the case and place a household fan to blow-in does it improve any?
Also, the HSF, should be dusted/blown off to best allow the fins full heat disapation to work.
good luck -----Willy
