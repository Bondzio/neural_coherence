It is running a lot better and faster now.
Internet Explorer still freezes up every now and then.
Do you know any test to see if it is running right!
The system should be clean.
I have run everything on it from Spyware to Security.
Here is what the system config is saying now: Processor Memory Network Card Storage Hardware Software General Information Service Tag J1F1J71 Express Service Code 41444596333 Computer Model Dimension 4700 BIOS Vendor Dell Inc.
