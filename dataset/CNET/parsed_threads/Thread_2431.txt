<s> I have a 20.1&quot; DELL monitor that I use with my notebook in my office when I'm not traveling. </s>
<s> My setup used to be that the monitor on my notebook had a different resolution (1024 x 768) than the external Dell monitor (1680 x 1050). </s>
<s> Something happened and now I don't have that 1680 x 1050 resolution as an option, and the external monitor and laptop monitor are now set the same. </s>
<s> I redownloaded the drivers from the Dell CD that came with the monitor, but I still can't set the resolution correctly. </s>
<s> HELP! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I use dual monitors as well, but as a clone. </s>
<s> How does yours work? </s>
<s> Right click the desktop and click properties. </s>
<s> Go over to the settings tab, and click your monitor, the 20 inch. </s>
<s> Try changing then. </s>
<s> I know you somehow turn off the Laptops monitor, I have a Dell Laptop and you press Ctrl Alt F3 to switch the onboard monitor on and off. </s>

<s> Thanks for your post. </s>
<s> When I go to the settings tab, the Dell isn't even an option. </s>
<s> When I go into advanced, it is there but it doesn't seem to register anywhere else? </s>
