1.1.1	I have a Seagate external 160 GB HD that I was using successfully over the last 4 months and then all of a sudden now when I connected it via USB (same way I have been doing in the past) it is not recognizing the drive and asking me to re-format.	St
1.1.2	Called Seagate and they said that reformatting is my only option.	St
1.1.3	Also checked out a couple data recovery softwares to see if I could get my data back...but wanted to see if there was anything I could do to get the drive working to how it used to.	St
1.1.4	The drive shows up in My Computer but I cannot access the files anymore....please help.	St
1.1.5	I am running Windows XP Pro and also have a Mac at home.	St
1.1.6	I was using the HD straight out of the box (FAT32 I believe)...just plug and play before...have all my data on it...please advise!	St
1.1.7	Thanks in advance!	St
1.2.1	I only know what you write in your post.	St
1.2.2	In XP Pro SP1 and SP2 the limit was raised to over 127GB (reference http://www.48bitlba.com ) Install the SP1 at least to see if the drive comes back.	St
1.2.3	Also review http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=28919&messageID=328179 for solutions found there.	St
