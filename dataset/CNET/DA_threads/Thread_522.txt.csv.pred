1.1.1	Just a bit of advice , I 've just started overclocking and want to see what the max voltage I can safely send to my CPU as Ive been told that this will help increase my FSB speed , here 's my setup - Asus A7V600 ( KT600 chipset ) Motherboard Athlon XP 2400+ 512MB 2700 Samsung RAM Radeo 9800 Pro 450W Power Supply Initially , the FSB was set to 133/33 in the BIOS , this gave me a CPU speed of 1.99GHz , I 've took it step by step to 149/33 ( anything above this and the PC wo n't start ) , this gives me a speed of 2.23GHz .	St
1.1.2	However , as stated above , I 've been told that if I increase the voltage going to CPU , I can overclock even further .	St
1.1.3	the current voltage is 1.650V .	St
1.1.4	What can I safely increase this to so I do n't damage the CPU ?	Ques
1.2.1	With more voltage and heat , you are decreasing the life of the component .	St
1.2.2	It 's a simple issue , but your choice to trade off speed for life .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	So if it 's got a reasonable heatsink and fan on it , this should help matters .	St
1.3.2	It 's top temprature at the moment is 46 degrees C. That 's when I 'm in the BIOS , I 'm led to believe that this puts a 100 % load on the CPU .	St
1.3.3	Windows is averaging around 40-43 degrees .	St
1.3.4	Whats the acceptable temprature limit ?	Ques
