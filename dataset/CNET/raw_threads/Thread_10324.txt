I'm sure the other one has WPA security. Just remember to update the firmware for your router, since most come shipped with outdated firmware. Rick

I just switched from a Linksys wireless G router to a DLink Extreme wireless N router - DIR 655. The difference is night and day. Now the kids play their online games and the internet works perfectly. No one complains of slow load times. I had to many issues with the Linksys. Set up with the DLink was a breeze. Consider this one another option.
