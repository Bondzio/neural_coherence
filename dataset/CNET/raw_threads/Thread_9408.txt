Hello all, I'm trying to access files off my old hard drive (which is slave) to copy to my current hard drive (master). I can get to program files and such ... but cannot get into Documents and Settings ... and into my personal folder. Says Access is denied. Both drives have Windows XP, master hd is Maxtor DiamodMax Plus 80gig, slave hd is Seagate Barracuda 60gig ... can anyone please help? Thanks in advance.
