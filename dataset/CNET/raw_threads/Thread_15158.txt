No doubt its better quality but understanding all of the specs etc... Anyhow The other day I was at bb and noticed they have high-def monitors with the high-end cpus. What I was wondering is ... isnt this just a gimick. Aren't all lcd, + monitors by definition high-definition?

Basically, to be considered 'high def' a computer monitor just needs to support reolutions greater than 640x480 (VGA). Nearly all 15 inch or larger monitors -- crt as well as flat panel -- support Super VGA (800x600) and higher resos, and hence are high definition. The most succinct definition of 'hdtv' I've found so far is this: a television screen offering at least double the resolution of the highest quality standard definition TV screen (NTSC standard picture quality = 648 X 486 at 60 Hz refresh rate). So ... if you want to know if a monitor really is 'High Def' then find out what it's highest resolution is.
