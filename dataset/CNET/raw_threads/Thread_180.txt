I brought a computer with a video card and now I found out that I need a more powerful power supply to run my GPU. I purchased this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16883102675 computer with this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814150130 video card. It recommends a 450watt or higher PSU, the video card. Can somebody give me a some power supplies from Newegg or TigerDirect that will work with this computer. Also, the GPU has a 4-pin power conect not a 6-pin like most PCI-E cards.And it needs to have a 24-pin main connecter. Along with that I would like to upgrade the ram to 1gig. Now can I just add another CORSAIR ValueSelect 512MB 184-Pin Unbuffered DDR 400 in there and it will work? Thanks in advance.
