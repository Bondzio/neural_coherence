I get the same problem if I try to access the desktop from my PC. They are in the same workgroup and password protected sharing is off, what else could be causing this problem?

More issues are covered at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6127_102-0.html?threadID=381203&tag=forums06;forum-threads Yes you wrote password protected sharing is off but that does not mean you don't need an account on the other machine.

I followed the steps on here http://www.tannerwilliamson.com/2009/09/windows-7-seven-network-file-sharing-fix-samba-smb/ and it still doesn't help.

This leaves us with firewalls (in any machine or router) and security suites too. Yes, I can't help you. I am not there to do all this for you. There are quite a long list of things that can be wrong and what confounds some is why those that help can't just tell which item is wrong. What works is if we keep going down the list. Bob

I am not sure if the firewall of the network adapter could be causing problem, it is a Mac Time Capsule which I can guarantee is running the default settings. What is next on the list?

Create the shares AFTER the accounts. I've run into this oddity if the share was made and later I straightened out the accounts. Since there is an Apple device, consider installing Bonjour from http://support.apple.com/downloads/Bonjour_for_Windows Bob

Also, time capsules are also wireless network adapters. http://reviews.cnet.com/network-storage/apple-time-capsule-500gb/4505-3382_7-32818588.html

When makers rewrite the networking book we'll have to match the old names to what they write today. That's a bridge mode and can harbor a firewall. Domains are going to tax even the most season IT staff as the Domain Servers must be configured just so. But I wonder if you have confused domains with workgroups? If you have different workgroup names you have to correct that. Bob
