Allow it to run its tests, if they report or still show that square area is present with no error to report, then you have either a true h/w fault. The quick test is to unplug the monitor from PC and then the OSD(reset) testing or simply access it. Once there check the setting or review them. If the small square still appears then some fault is present with the display itself. If it goes away once you unplug, then returns after you reconnect to PC, then maybe some driver or s/w issue. If there was some recent video upgrade or display issue and you tried to correct, then the problem appeared, undo that work. You may try using the system restore feature in such a case. tada -----Willy
