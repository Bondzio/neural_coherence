i have had the same problem in the past and now.
my old pentium 233mx windows 98 se with 128mb of ram a 1.2 gb harddrive.
the first time the 166mx processor burned up.
it was under warranty at that time.
the second time the power supply went out.
now my motherboard is fried.
i will have to get a new motherboard and new case and start all over again.
in your case it can be your processor out or something else.
if your have friends who know a lot about computers that would be your best bet.
for them to check it out.
