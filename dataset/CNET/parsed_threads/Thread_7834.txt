<s> I am looking at getting a Linksys WRT350N router and a Maxtor 750GB One Touch III from Office Depot. </s>
<s> We have 4 computers on the network 1 being wired and the rest wireless. </s>
<s> All the computers that are wireless have draft n. But 2 of them our macs. </s>
<s> What i want to do is connect the Hard Drive to the router and have it on the network for my parents when they offload photos onto there mac computer and have a backup of them. </s>
<s> Will this even work? </s>
<s> And what do you thing of the products? </s>

<s> I was considering a NAS but i need a new router, so i thought that if i got this router with USB then i could get a regular hard drive encloser and have it work like a NAS. </s>
<s> Will my option do this? </s>
