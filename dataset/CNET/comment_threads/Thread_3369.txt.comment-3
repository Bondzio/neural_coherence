what store?
whichever got the best deal of course!
i would recommend getting the a1250n.
it features a dual core amd processor, 1gb of ram, and 250gb hd.
i would also look into the gateways with the btx case designs and pentium d processors.
usually cost around $1000 in ads.
i dont recall the model # though.
