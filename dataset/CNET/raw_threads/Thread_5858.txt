And what make and model of disk are they reporting on? And let me repeat what I asked before. What characteristics of the drive do you want to know? Kees

7882	6	558445	5287134	5287086	islandporgy	3/15/12 6:19 PM	1.33183554E12	Did That	I did that and Western Digital did that The Serial # do not match the specs on the hard drive that was sent to me. The Serial # matched on what I ordered not what was sent to me. I got two different statement confumation emails. Before i opened up the hard drive Plastic casing I Called Western Digital because if it was not what I ordered I would have sent it back I do not care what is on the Lable. The Software Puriform Speccy says something way diferent. It is not OEM I do not know what it is.The Vender might have decieved me not the MFGS. Thank You Wendell
