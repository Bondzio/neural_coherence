oem motherboards of well known for having &quot;bulging capacitors&quot; these will sometimes cause the system to shutdown when the cpu is throttled up, such as during a bios post check of the cpu.
but it could also be heat related.
i would just look at all your capacitors and check to see if any are bulging, if you don't know what the difference is check out this.
and  i remember trying to fix the schools broken dell gx270's which were plaqued by bulging capacitors.
hope this helps anymore questions post bigboy73
