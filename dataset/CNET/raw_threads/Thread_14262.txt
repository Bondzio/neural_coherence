Is it possible to hook up a zip drive using a 3 device ribbon cable. I would like to put it on the same ribbon cable as the two cd roms I have now. The zip drive was given to me and works fine. I just do not want to loose a cd rom or hard drive in order to hook it up.

You can cable up more, but it won't work. Having dealt with those that insist, I have such a cable handy so they can try it themselves. About 1/2 are angry it doesn't work. The other 1/2 seem to like trying. 2. IDE PCI cards may not support CD, CDRW, DVD or ZIP drives so be sure your selected IDE card supports what you are going to plug into it.
