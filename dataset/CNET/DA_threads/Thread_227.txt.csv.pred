1.1.1	g'day , I am a technical neanderthal who is looking to connect my kids xbox360 to xbox live .	St
1.1.2	Current configuration is single port modem connecting to Apple Airport Express .	St
1.1.3	Current home wireless network of mix of 2 x PCs and 1 x mac desktops works well .	St
1.1.4	The issue is whether to get the xbox 360 wireless adapter or connect via ethernet cable .	St
1.1.5	Have heard that wireless causes lag in live gaming , so looking at wired option .	St
1.1.6	Xbox is on same room as modem , so no issues there , but given single port , looks like I either need a new modem/router combo or just a router connecting to existing modem , and then connect Airport and xbox ethernet cable to that .	St
1.1.7	Do n't know what is best , so hope you can help .	St
1.1.8	Cheers	Polite
1.2.1	WIFI can be interferred with , smacked down at the wrong time so gamers eventually learn to get wired .	St
1.3.1	As noted , you should definitely go wired .	St
1.3.2	You can go with either the router or modem/router combo .	St
1.3.3	Adding a router is the easier solution since your modem is already configured with your ISP and you know it works fine with their network .	St
1.3.4	You may have to consider the Airport 's compatibility though .	St
1.3.5	You might have to make some adjustments to the Airport 's configuration settings if possible ( e.g .	St
1.3.6	turning off DHCP ) .	St
1.3.7	If you 're willing to loose the Airport Express , you could just purchase a wireless router to simplify the LAN configuration .	St
1.4.1	Will go with wired connection from xbox360 .	St
1.4.2	Appreciate you help on this .	St
1.4.3	Regards .	St
