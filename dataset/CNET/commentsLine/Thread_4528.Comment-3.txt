thanks.
i checked dell support, this was all the info they were able to give me: storage drive type drive size total available space used space c: ntfs 70.70gb 12.40gb 58.30gb and disk drives wdc wd800jd-75jnc0 74.50gb i know it says i have 12 gigs left, but that's only because i've maxed out my ipod's storage space with all of my video files.
is there any site that would tell me the specs that my dell supports?
from there i can just copy and paste the specs into newegg or something.
