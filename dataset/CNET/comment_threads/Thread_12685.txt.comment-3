Thanks Bob for replying I'm new at this graphics card stuff and just want this thing to run correctly.
In regards to your question about clock stability I'm lost.
If I have to adjust something in the BIOS I could do that if you steer me in the right direction.
I looked in Device Manager and under Display adapters I'm showing Radeon 9550 and Radeon 9550 Secondary they both seem to have Driver dates of 8/2/06, versions 8.282.0.0 and they're digitally signed from MS.
Concerning the DXBUSTER after use do I retain the system32 folder that's on C: or can I delete it?
In case it helps here are my computer specs DFI LP875B Rev.B1 Phoenix-Award Bios v6.00PG date 01/20/2005 Intel P4 2.8 GHz fsb 800 Ram: 1GB Corsair Value Select 512x2 DDR400 Plextor 708-A DVDR/RW 8-in-one Lite-On LTR-24102B (52x/32x/52x CD-RW) Video: ATI Radeon 9550, Audio: Sound Blaster Audigy 2 Value, HDD: Seagate 80GB,120GB 7200RPM, Ultra-ATA/100) Monitor: LG L1732TQ LCD OS: Windows XP Pro SP2
