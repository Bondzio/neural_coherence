Nintendo is no longer selling the one they had and i wanted a better brand name than some of the ones i am seeing. The others allow you to plug it into any PC with an internet connection and it will send out a wifi signal to be picked up by wii/ds/psp/ and other pc's in the home. thanks, tina

You have found a discussion forum so this is not your technical support. Here's the article about using such a thing and its ADHOC setup -&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx Now that the host is setup, see if the others can find your adhoc connection.

Which means it is basically a cell phone that dials into the verizon network and then connects to the internet. I have found a wifi max that says it connects to the usb port and acts as a wifi hub without the need for a router... which is what i was hoping the CNET CNTCUA-854 Wireless USB 802.11-G UBS Dongle was going to do. but maybe not....

BEWARE that you will find no support for this. I'll note this article and then never speak of it again. That is all I can offer. Bob
