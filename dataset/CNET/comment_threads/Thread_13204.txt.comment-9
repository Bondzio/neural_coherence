In most cars when the motor conks out and needs replacement, it is cheaper to buy a new car than to replace the motor.
If you can jerry rig it to work for a while, when it breaks down again the car most likely won't explode.
It will simply need more motor repair.
In a computer everything is very sensitive to incorrect voltages and amperage.
An incorrect soldering in the PSU can cuase a short.
I have seen a fualty psu kill a mobo, proc, videocard and all the HDDs at once.
In this case, a new PSU is usually 1/10th the cast of the rest or less.
Put it in prospective.
That is a tiny cost.
