1.1.1	I have a broadband provider at a convention I 'm attending who insists I purchase a separate IP for every computer I will be using ( 22 of them ) and states that I ca n't use a router on their network or I 'll screw it up .	St
1.1.2	I know the latter is likely BS , and they just want me to pay for IPs , but I run a file server so need to run a router for the broadband connection or I ca n't get the computers both seeing the file server and accessing the internet .	St
1.1.3	The connection is a shared pipe , where we lease a certain amount of bandwidth and IPs for the week .	St
1.1.4	Can the provider detect my router if I run it anyway ?	Ques
1.2.1	Trying to figure what they are getting at ... whether it is more than simply a scam to extract as much money as possible .	St
1.2.2	If you use a nat masquarade of any type , it wo n't & quot ; mess up their network & quot ; .	St
1.2.3	It might be that someone has attached a router to their network before and has caused problems through misconfiguration .	St
1.2.4	Make sure all dynamic routing or other & quot ; chatty & quot ; protocols are off - so you do n't end up inadvertently adding routes to their network .	St
1.2.5	And turn off SNMP .	St
1.2.6	Can they detect it ... theoretically know ( other than visually ! )	St
1.2.7	but it depends on the behaviour .	St
1.2.8	If they were really intent on detection , then it is feasible I guess .	St
1.2.9	For example , a PC making multiple http connections will increment the source port each time .	St
1.2.10	With masquarate NAT ( PAT ) the source ports are modified as the router is traversed .	St
1.2.11	Depending on the router used , it might use a random sequence for the source port rather than increment .	St
1.2.12	Or OS finger printing techniques could be used if the two devices are different .	St
1.2.13	But I doubt it is in the realms of reason that they would go to this trouble .	St
1.2.14	More likely someone will wander around and ask why you have a network device plugged in .	St
1.3.1	Hi , yes your ISP can detect of you 're using a router because all router IP 's are 192.168.1.1 BUT !	St
1.3.2	they are lying about it messing with they 're network .	St
1.3.3	They just want you to buy more IP 's .	St
1.3.4	I know all this cause I went threw that same exactthing with my ISP .	St
1.3.5	Needless to say I won thAt battle .	St
1.3.6	There 's no way legally they can stop you from using a router	St
1.4.1	Not really true .	Res
1.4.2	Most router come with 192.168.1.1/0.1 as a preset IP address , but almost all routers will allow you to change the address .	St
1.4.3	Also , with NAT , it should be impossible for anything outside the router to see which internal IP orginated the request .	St
1.4.4	They could check MAC addresses , if they require you to register your computers MAC address , then the Routers MAC address will be different , but good routers will allow you to change their mac address to your computers instead .	Sug
1.4.5	As was said before , apart from OS fingerprinting , or checking the MAC address , there really should be no way to tell that you are using a router .	St
1.4.6	And , even if there is , set up a computer , with two network cards , and use bog standard microsoft ICS , and you have the network shared between as many computers as you need .	St
1.4.7	Craig	St
1.5.1	Most routers have the ability to spoof the MAC address .	Sug
1.5.2	First set up one computer on the & quot ; pipe & quot ; .	St
1.5.3	Then use the router menus to tell the router to say it has the same MAC address as that pc ( just enter the pc 's MAC address into the correct field ) .	St
1.5.4	Now plug the pipe into the WAN socket of the router and it will pretend to be that PC which does make it difficult ( not impossible ) for the ISP to see the difference .	St
1.5.5	ps : the IP number that the router shows to the pipe is the one assigned by the ISP using DHCP .	St
1.5.6	The IPs used behind the router are invisible to the ISP and usually default to the 192.168.1.x range stated in an earlier reply .	St
1.5.7	jdenenberg	St
1.6.1	ISP offers a dedicated line for $ 2300 for the week , vs the shared line for $ 1200 and will allow a router on the dedicated line , but still require $ 150 & quot ; machine charge & quot ; per machine using the broadband after the first two .	St
1.6.2	Can you believe the nerve !	St
1.6.3	Because their tone seems like they might well do onsite inspection , I 'm going with the dedicated and just not paying for the additional machines .	St
1.6.4	No way for them to augue that the other machines are 'using ' the broadband .	St
1.6.5	I 'll just say they 're not .	St
1.6.6	Crooks .	St
1.6.7	Would be one thing if they just said they charge for the IPs to make money , but to charge double for the dedicated so I can use a router THEN try to bleed me for $ 150 per machine is criminal .	St
1.6.8	Should run a free hotspot and screw them out of some of their wifi income in the convention center as well .	St
1.6.9	Thanks again .	St
1.7.1	This is truly bizarre .	Polite
1.7.2	I know that per machine charges are typical if you get real internet addresses for each machine but I 've never seen such a charge when we use a NAT ROUTER and have the usual single internet IP address .	St
1.7.3	Even a business connection here is well under 1,000 a month with no machine charges .	St
1.7.4	What country are you in ?	Ques
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	Unfortunately , the line being rented is in a convention center in the US , and these places make their own rules .	St
1.8.2	Lucky they are not making me pay the local union crew to carry my router in for me !	St
1.8.3	Have kept costs down somewhat in the past by paying $ 400 for a dry-pair to the broadband company that owns the lines in the cenvention center just so I could then pay a local DSL outfit to provide the bandwidth at a much cheaper rate and the local DSL guys do n't care about a router or number of machines .	St
1.8.4	Do n't really have the time to find a trustworthy ISP for DSL before this convention though .	St
1.9.1	Just like renting a car vs. car payments ( short vs. long term commitment ) the rates skyrocket for such venues .	St
1.9.2	Have a great show !	St
