<s> I am running WinXP Prof and have SP2 installed. </s>
<s> I purchased a Belkin 802.11g wireless card for the desktop but it is not recognized as a device. </s>
<s> I tried to search for new hardware and no luck. </s>
<s> Can this be a SP2 problem? </s>
<s> I know the slots are working because it will recognize other cards. </s>
<s> (NIC and Sound card). </s>
<s> I also know the wireless card works because I installed in another machine and it detected. </s>
<s> The only thing was the 2nd machine was a Dell without SP2 installed. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> &quot;I tried to search for new hardware and no luck. </s>
<s> Can this be a SP2 problem?&quot; I'm used to installed drivers for such things. </s>
<s> Your post didn't tell, but let me share that Dell preloads some drivers so you don't have to. </s>
<s> A stock install of XP will not have the drivers. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> The machine I'm having problems with is not a Dell but just a generic machine. </s>
<s> I have the disk with the drivers and they are installed on the generic machine. </s>
<s> It seems like the PC doesn't even see the card. </s>
<s> &quot;Generic machines&quot; may use a motherboard with a chipset that Microsoft may run on but you need to have latest BIOS and a MOTHERBOARD DRIVER PACKAGE before cards or USB things work properly. </s>
<s> Your post didn't share the information so I can't tell if this is the issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The motherboad has VB-601 on it and on the corner there is a label which has MI413s. </s>
<s> The BIOS is Award Modular BIOS 4.51PG. </s>
<s> It says verison: MI413 Award Plug and Play BIOS Extension v1.0A </s>
<s> If this is a BX based board (only you will know) then this google... http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=VB-601+&btnG=Google+Search seems to agree, the issue can be.. 1. </s>
<s> You need the latest BIOS. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You need to &quot;Reset Configuration Data&quot; in the BIOS. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> You try another PCI slot since... the one next the AGP can be ... problematic. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> The card is just incompatible with this board. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Someone disabled the IRQ PNP features in the OS. </s>
<s> I offer this since I lost a day over that. </s>
<s> The owner was thinking DOS days where IRQs couldn't be shared. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This info doesn't give us a clue about the age of the system. </s>
<s> What processor is in it, how old is it? </s>
<s> The PC is probably from 1999 or so. </s>
<s> I got it from a friend and put a Pentium III 500Mhz processor and it has 768 of RAM. </s>
<s> I tried all the PCI slots and also verified the PnP option in the CMOS is enabled. </s>
<s> I flashed the BIOS using the MI413 one from this site: http://www.fic.com.tw/support/motherboard/bios.aspx?model_id=16 . </s>
<s> I also uninstalled SP2 and reinstalled XP without any luck. </s>
<s> http://www.netstumbler.org/archive/index.php/t-10573 It would be amazing to expect owners to exchange cards, do such gyrations on drivers and more. </s>
<s> You should try another card. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have a dell D610 running win xp2. </s>
<s> The wireless card is a dell 1470. </s>
<s> I pulled the card and installed in another D610 and have wireless internet on that machine.I then took the good card and installed it in the 1st D610. </s>
<s> No wireless internet. </s>
<s> I plugged in an Ethernet cable to get internet. </s>
<s> No Problem. </s>
<s> I reformatted the hard drive ,did a fresh install,checked the bios and upgraded to A06 and still no wireless. </s>
<s> any thoughts on this problem? </s>
