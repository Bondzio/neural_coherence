I would say get a portable computer a XPS system is not needed if you want to go Dell one of there inpiron systems would do nicely.
They tend to be a bit lower end and a bit less expensive.
If all you Granson would be playing is wow then any of todays systems should be fine.
Reason why I say portable is because you like to sit at the couch and and be on the computer.
