i am totally computer challenged, so my advice is just a simple &quot;home-cure&quot; remedy.
the only computer i have or use is a laptop and sometimes i leave it on for a long period.
i was worried about the drive heat also as they do get so hot.
i sometimes had cd drive failure which i thought was because the cd got so hot, so i put my computer on a woven wooden hotplate mat (one that is open weave so air can circulate) on top of a shortlegged cookie rack.
on warm days i keep a floor fan circulating in the area of my computer, other times i keep a small desk fan close to the computer.
since doing that my computer stays only warm to the touch.
think putting your laptop on your lap or any flat surface only can add to the heat concentration.
just find a way to raise it an inch or so.
