i've built a lots of computers and used many types of hard drive's but i must say ibm drive have served me very well unlike the others.
and now that hitachi has purchased them their even better with newer technology built into them.
they are very smooth running very little noise, if i were to rate hard drive manufactures it would be in this order hitachi,western digital,seagate,maxtor.
but this is my opinion only i have been a tech for 30 years i worked for a major company all this time, when we got into computers in 1982 my company sent me to school for this type of training it needed to stay competitive so i think i know a little about quality.
