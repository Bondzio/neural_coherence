<s> just recently my mate built me a computer and it has 2 hard drives a C drive and E drive. </s>
<s> the problem is that the C drive only has 4gb while the E drive has 600gb. </s>
<s> I dont know alot about computers so im worried about playing aorund with it 2 much without help but windows etc is stored on the c drive and it is always at low disk space. </s>
<s> How can i get windows to load and install programs on the E drive so there is plently of room. </s>
<s> Is there any advantages to the way it is set up now. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> This is a quite ridiculous setup, that won't last long to break down. </s>
<s> Back to your mate and let him redo it. </s>
<s> He should use Windows XP setup to delete both partitions and then create a new one covering the whole 604 GB disk and install XP on that. </s>

<s> That setup was for them and not you. </s>
<s> I'd heard many reasons why to do such a thing but to saddle a new user with such an onerous setup is just not nice. </s>
<s> Do it over. </s>
