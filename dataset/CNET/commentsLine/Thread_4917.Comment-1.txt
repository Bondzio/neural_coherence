hi, what limitations does the kindle fire have versus some other tablets?
i've heard it only lets you use the amazon apps store(although it seems to be you could use any app store with the silk browser, i guess they're incompatible?).
that is the sort of limitation i'm concerned about.
does the hd have these limitations?
