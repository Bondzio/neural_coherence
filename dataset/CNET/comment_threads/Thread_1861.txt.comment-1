I have a main desktop computer as well as a laptop.
I also have an HP printer connected to the desktop via USB.
I would like to be able to print wirelessly from the laptop using the same printer.
The printer is also able to connect via &quot;built-in networking to connect to 10Base-T/100Base-TX networks.&quot; I'm not sure what that means, but there is an ethernet port on the back of the printer as well (or maybe LAN??
I don't know the difference).
So, how can I accomplish this?
Let me know if you need computer info.
Thanks!
