hey dgogoi, i have the exact same problem with my sony viao (now 2 years old) that you did.
did you end up getting a new dvd-rom, if so which one and did it work out all right?
i'm also curious if you had any trouble switching them out.
i took a look at mine, and it didn't look like the removal/installation was anywhere near as straight-forward as with most laptops.
thanks, steve
