8943	2	309377	2863972	2863442	Willy	9/22/08 4:59 AM	1.22205954E12	NIL	youre going normally fry pc however due cooling effect coat certain parts pc constant spray point poster explained momentary freeze area recover become liquid gas power applied during short liquid state short components andor due rapid heat expansion components stress area break contact wont happen allow pc simply sit few minutes apply power why asking question bad experience tada willy
