1.1.1	I bought some new DDR2 memory , but it wo n't fit .	St
1.1.2	Both my old and new memory have 240 pins .	St
1.1.3	The memory I had has 64 pins then a gap then 56 pins ( each side ) , which looking at google images and Wikipedia seems standard .	St
1.1.4	The new memory , ( HYF2536481G ) has 68 pins then a gap then 52 pins ( each side ) .	St
1.1.5	The gap is 73mm from the edge I thought all DDR2 memory had the same layout ; has anyone come across this ?	Ques
1.1.6	I thought they might have sent DDR because of the gap position , but DDR has fewer pins .	St
1.2.1	What help do you need ?	Ques
1.2.2	You ca n't change that stick .	St
1.2.3	So return it and buy the right one .	St
1.2.4	The memory finder at www.crucial.com surely will lead to that .	St
1.2.5	Or - if you prefer a physical shop above a webshop - take an old stick with you when doing the exchange .	St

1.3.1	I would buy the 'right one ' if I was confident of what that is .	St
1.3.2	I would also like to find out if it was my mistake for ordering the wrong memory or the retailer has the wrong information on the memory ; Wikipedia describes DIMM DDR2 as being specifically identifiable by a gap 70mm across ( which would fit ) and not 73mm .	St
1.3.3	Crucial does n't have the system listed or I would have ordered from them .	St
1.3.4	The motherboard is MS-7301 , which supports up to 2GB DDR2 memory .	St
1.3.5	I did a bit of research and ca n't find any information on different pin positions in DIMM DDR2 memory , so I am a bit apprehensive about reordering until I find out so the same mistake is n't made ; PC5300 DDR2 DIMM should be the right memory .	St
1.4.1	I ca n't find it on crucial.com , indeed , but http : //www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx ? model=MS-7302 % 20 % 28K9A2GM-F % 20V3 % 29 & Cat=RAM is the page for the 7302 .	St
1.4.2	That says : DDR2 PC2-5300 , DDR2 PC2-6400 , DDR2 PC2-8500 ( non ECC ) .	St
1.4.3	Might apply to the 7301 also .	St
1.4.4	What does the manual say ?	Ques
1.4.5	Back to the retailer seems the best way to go .	St
1.4.6	Kees	St
1.5.1	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File : Desktop_DDR_Memory_Comparison.svg Note the notch moves from ddr2 & gt ; ddr3	St
1.6.1	HYF2536481G That shows to be ecc ram .	St
1.6.2	Is that what you want ?	Ques
1.6.3	I 've never played with the stuff ... ... .perhaps the slot location moves .	St
1.7.1	It 's not on their system list , despite being a Packard Bell , but the system scanner link worked on that page you posted .	St
1.7.2	Memory suggested is 2no 1GB DDR2 PC2-5300 .	St
1.7.3	I do n't think the ones Misco sent are proper DDR2 , so I 'll see if I can get a refund then reorder else where .	St
1.8.1	the right RAM for your PC ?	Ques
1.8.2	Exactly what is the PC model , series and number ?	Ques
1.8.3	Last did you , check your PC manuals or check the mfgs WEBsite ?	Ques
1.8.4	VAPCMD	St
