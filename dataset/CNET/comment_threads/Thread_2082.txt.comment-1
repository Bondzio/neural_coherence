I am a small business owner looking to backup my important business documents in case my older model Acer Aspire 3680 laptop unexpectedly crashes before I fully transition to a new computer.
The documents are primarily Word and Excel with the occasional photo album.
I have been looking at 250GB external hard drives but started to think a flash drive might be a simpler, cheaper solution.
Good idea?
Bad idea?
Thoughts?
Thanks!
