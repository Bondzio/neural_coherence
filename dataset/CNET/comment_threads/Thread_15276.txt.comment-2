When you OC, you're pushing things.
You have to find a happy medium and then it'll settle down.
Cooling is very important as well as adding a slight voltage increase for the cpu to be OC'ed.
This is a go or no go process, until you finally get there.
As you increase cpu voltage then cooling even in a default system is critial it becomes even more so with an OC'ed one.
So you take your chances as it wre.
good luck tada -----Willy
