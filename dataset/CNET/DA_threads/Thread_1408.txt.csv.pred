1.1.1	I've got a bunch of mp3's and WAV files on an external HD on my PC.	St
1.1.2	I'd like to give them to a friend with a Mac.	St
1.1.3	Both computers have USB2 ports.	St
1.1.4	If I take my external HD over to his place and plug it into his Mac thru the USB2 port, can he copy the files to his computer?	St
1.2.1	To do this you want a partition in FAT32.	St
1.2.2	But FAT32 on USB is somewhat flaky so don't put what you can't lose on said drive.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks, Bob, I wouldn't want to lose any of it.	St
1.3.2	What alternatives are there?	Ques
1.3.3	Obviously a DVD won't hold as much as an ext.	St
1.3.4	HD, but would a DVD burned from a PC be able to be read on a Mac?	St
1.4.1	It's a standard filesystem so unless you do something odd like use UDF (InCD, DirectCD, DLA) then it just works.	St
