I have b running through a Netgear hub where I have a Laser copier as well. The thing is that the laser copier is identified in the network but the win NT machine is not. I tried to ping one machine from the other and no luck. They seem to not see each other on the network. However when I enter the IP address of the NT machine in the XP one a message flags instantly on both machines, they can't shared the same IP. I am not a wizard at all on networking, to my disgrace, but if they are not seeing each other on the network why is this message coming up in both machines simultaneously? Now I realize that in the NT machine there are two protocols installed: TCP/IP & NetBUI while XP does not carry NetBUI anymore. Could this be the bloody reason why XP is not picking up this machine on the network? I have tried a million things that have come to my mind to no luck. What suggestions come to your mind guys? Please enlighten me... Gelson

Focus on workgroup names set as the same and file sharing being enabled. Also look for those link lights on the NICs flashing. Check your IPs, see that they are not the same.
