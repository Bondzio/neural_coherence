1.1.6	AMD Athlon 64 3500+ Venice 2000MHz AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ Manchester 2000MHz HT Dual Core Budget-wise, I'd go with the AMD Athlon Venice, but I'm not sure if I'd be better off performance wise with the dual core Manchester.	St
1.1.7	Your thoughts, anyone?	St
1.2.1	There's little to discuss here as dual core is the answer to video work.	St
