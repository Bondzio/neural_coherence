I am truly perplexed, but upon reconnecting the power cables, etc., I had everything spinning up as it should....so I proceeded to hook everything back up and it is working like a charm.
What's so odd is that when I first began, prior to doing the short test, the switch (which I never reseated at all) would not invoke the slightest bit of life.
I verified that the two box fans, the two cpu fans, and the graphic card fan all spun up, the scsi devices are all correctly recognized, etc...behavior normal.
I am totally perplexed but very, very happy!
I still have no clue what happened but this appears to be a happy ending to the story.
Thanks!
Ross
