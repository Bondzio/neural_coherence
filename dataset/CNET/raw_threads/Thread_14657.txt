Based on what I have, read I guess I will never see it. As to the quality of the monitor, it has performed without any problems for me and one other employee. I am not picky about how true the colors are so I cannot comment on that subject, but functionally, it has been fine. I have nothing to say that it is exceptional nor anything to say that is poor.

I did wish it had some more options with regard to turning the monitor up and down and around, but its been fine. I never recieved my rebate either, which is highly dissapointing, maybe this is an issue others are having? The monitor only have with one dead pixel, which as I understand it, is much less than the industry average. I'm happy with it. If you want more reviews, go to Newegg.com, its been reveiwed hundred's of times.

I mean, have you ever heard of fujiplus? My second monitor is a 20&quot; HP LCD and I dont have one dead pixel. I think Industry standard is that they will replace monitors if they have 6 dead pixels or more.
