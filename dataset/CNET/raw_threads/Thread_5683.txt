I cant figure out how to get them to work together, even after releasing and renewing my ip. I have also made sure that my DHCP is enabled. I am running two routers- one that has a modded DD-WRT, but I dont think thats an issue.. Any ideas?

Do I need to have dhcp activated? Why am I the only one with the problem? Shouldn't messing with my router settings affect all? Ths prob is unfixible. I also don't know what wps is...s

Then again if someone has hand assigned IP numbers and used one that is in the DHCP range, they created a problem. Fix? Don't do that! I wonder about your ROKU. I can not check mine today. I just moved and I have my ROKU remote but we haven't found the roku unit. I'm left to guess you have not explored all menus. As to the laptop, changing the SSID should help. If not, the OS may have been damaged by malware or registry cleaners. -&gt; I asked for which Windows OS and can't find an answer. This severely limits me since I can not write tcpip resets for all 5 versions. Bob

Just dont understand why its just MY computer having problems... Especially since nobody has a fixed IP - nobody in my apartment knows how to mess with that stuff... Any help would be greatly appreciated

That's two different issues unless you meant something else. Review http://www.troublefixers.com/fixed-there-is-an-ip-address-conflict-with-another-system-on-the-network/ and then consider changing the DHCP range in the router. Now that I know .14 is conflicting, we can change the DHCP range to .100 to .200 -&gt; As you are running a modded DD-WRT I have to think this would be trivial for you. If not, supply a link to your modded DD-WRT's manual so I can find the config screen. Bob
