i was going to post this in the norton forum, but they wont let you post anything unless it relates to having a problem with their products, so i'll give this to any software developer: over the past 20 years ive been able to recover fried hdd's simply by powering it on and off multiple times, sometimes 20 or 30 times.
it would be nice if a developer would automate this process, perhaps as part of their existing hdd diagnostic software.
the software would have to power on the drive, wait to verify access or no bad error messages, and if fails power off for 30 seconds.
its a simple program, but but it needs to be put in place.
(im still waiting for them to develop a device that will gently slam a hdd on a countertop repeatedly [because that sometimes works!]
heh heh)
