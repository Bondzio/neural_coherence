<s> i have an old external LaCie CD-RW that i no longer use. </s>
<s> So I decided to trash the burner and use the enclosure to make a new 500GB external HDD. </s>
<s> I swaped the ide burner for a Seagate Baracuda 500Gb ide hdd and made sure that its jumper was set to master. </s>
<s> Then i pluged it into my toshiba notebook running xp pro media edition. </s>
<s> using the Disk Management utility in Administrative Tools, the new 500GB drive is visible but the device is still recognised as a cd-rw. </s>
<s> I can't format the drive or manage to load it as a hard drive. </s>
<s> Windows automatically loads a cd device driver and i can't seem to get arround it. </s>
<s> does anyone have a solution to this problem, i'd rather not have to buy a new enclosure. </s>

<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> How about some specs first, like OS, service pack, etc... Paul </s>
<s> But has that computer seen this external box as when it was containing the CD drive? </s>
<s> It could be the OS is assuming it is the same as it was when it was connected before. </s>
<s> Check the Device Manager under &quot;DVD/CD-ROM drives&quot; when it is connected. </s>
<s> If it shows up there as a CD, delete it by right clicking on the drive and then let Windows reinstall it. </s>
<s> If that does not work, try a different computer. </s>
<s> Another thought would be try a Linux live CD. </s>
<s> Boot from that to see what that OS does with it. </s>
<s> If that still shows as a CD drive, then the external box must have an identifier built into the front end. </s>
<s> In that case, a different box will be needed. </s>
