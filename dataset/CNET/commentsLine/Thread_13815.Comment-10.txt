we have a small home network with this desktop computer and i want to be able to network with my work laptop and a new laptop we plan to buy for home use.
since our desktop is strained, we are going to get either a network attached storage drive or a regular external hard drive.
i am reading reviews and suggestions on each but am not sure how i should choose betwen the two.
the high rated, lwer costs nas is in the $300+ range (on up to very expensive); while the high rated external is in the $175-200 range.
so what would spending the extra $100-$150 for an nas get me now and in the future when i upgrade things?
please advise.
thanks
