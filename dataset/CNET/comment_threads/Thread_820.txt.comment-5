I tried every combination of deleting document and deleting printer and reinstalling driver, restarting print document.
What's most interesting is that not one, but TWO local USB printers were &quot;stopped&quot; after installation of network printer.
No document was being printed to one of those USB printers, only the laser.
Yet Printer Setup Utility shows both &quot;stopped.&quot; Are you suggesting I search for files with names of either USB printer and delete them?
