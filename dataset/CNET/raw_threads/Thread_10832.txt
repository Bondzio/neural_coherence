It is also asking for a disk when it boots up but by hit the X it bypasses it. This computer in the past had a lot of trouble with spyware it was my daughter's computer. She has a new one and we want to keep this one it was $$$ and a nice computer at one time. TIA

You haven't given any information about the computer, other than it is an HP. Details would be nice as asked for in red above each posting window. Can you boot up into the Safe Mode list of options? Instructions here; http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial61.html#winxo If so, what happens if you choose the first option, start in Safe Mode. Assuming this is Windows, what happens when you insert the Windows CD when you boot up? Mark
