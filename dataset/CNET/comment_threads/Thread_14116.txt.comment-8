Could you give me a link to the one you got?
or does it really matter what brand or w/e your cantenna is?
I am thinking of getting one off ebay because they seem to have them for pretty cheap.
But back to my previous unanswered question: &quot;plus how would I hook it up?.
I want to hook up a cantenna to a wireless pci card on my computer and connect to a wireless internet connection...is this possible?.&quot; Is it?.
What I mean by wireless connection is....wifi...a wireless router..etc
