If not today, it will be soon.
Here's why.
The power supply is rated for that many Watts new.
In a year it may lose from 10 to 50% of that rating depending on too many factors.
To keep out of trouble I add it all up and toss 100 more Watts into the supply rating.
Those machines never show up due to an overtaxed power supply.
