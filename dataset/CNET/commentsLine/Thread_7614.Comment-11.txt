hi i think i got what you are saying i'm not knowledgeable about computing but i have looked inside the pc and it is all connected up in the normal way and it is a fixed hard drive the os (xp pro) is legal and updates via microsoft.
but if as you say a copy has been copied from one drive to another it's still a hard drive and not removable.
please forgive me if i'm sounding stupid to you but i am in the land of fog,mud and whats that burning smell at the moment, but many thanks for your responses.
