I have replaced my video card (ATI 1800X Wonder Card) with the new Radeon 3870.
I have tried using the Wonder card for video capture only but it seems to conflict with the primary 3870.
It gives me 2 extra displays, but I don't need them and disabled those displays.
ATI Tech Support said it doesn't support the 1800X anymore so I cannot get any advice from them.
Does anyone know how to set up the two cards to work in the same machine.
They are both PCIx.
I hesitate buying a new video capture card when the 1800 model is also a video capture card.
Any suggestions?
