1.1.1	I have recently encountred a very weird problem .	St
1.1.2	I turned off my computer , and came back the next day to find out it did n't work .	St
1.1.3	The weird thing is , the fans will work and power supply and motherboard fan all turn on when I push the switch , but normally when i push the switch , there 's a green light at the front that will light up .	St
1.1.4	It no longer lights up and my monitor remains completely idle .	St
1.1.5	Can anyone advise me as to what could be the problem .	St
1.1.6	I 've already checdk to make sure the video card is pushed in solidly and I 'm really confused .	St
1.1.7	Thanks for your time and my specs are below .	St
1.1.8	Asus P4S8X-X motherboard Geforce 4 Fx 5600 1 Gb of ram 80gb harddrive	St
1.2.1	Check out this dicussion .	St
1.2.2	http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html ? forumID=68 & threadID=63656 & messageID=757575	St
1.3.1	This is a common problem .	St
1.3.2	All too often the power supply is the culprit , however a bad componet can give the same result .	St
1.3.3	You really need to inspect the mtrbd .	St
1.3.4	up close to see any fault or possible blown capacitors .	St
1.3.5	If not found , what seems to work is simply reseat any cards and try again .	St
1.3.6	If your system had alot of & quot ; heat stress & quot ; what may look good is really poor componet ( s ) that have become a weak link .	St
1.3.7	Try , shortening the & quot ; power-ON & quot ; lead that come from the frt .	St
1.3.8	panel for a monent .	St
1.3.9	It should respond with the system trying to start just like pushing the ON button .	Sug
1.3.10	If it still fails , some success is found in removing the mtrbd. , try a simple test with it out of case , on some non-conductive material like cardboard and see if results are different , then re-install into case is postive ( no power ) .	St
1.3.11	All the suggestions are ed .	St
1.3.12	guesses as this problem may go away then return but usually its power related even if fans run , the logic to fully turn-ON system is low or faulty .	St
1.3.13	Remove cpu and check the socket , if brown looking or cyctralized , you have heat problem .	St
1.3.14	If black or super dusty , you conductive materials allowing static to play havoc .	St
1.3.15	Oh yeah , real bugs can die their last across some contacts .	St
1.3.16	But , the best bet is to replace the power supply with one of 400W or better .	St
1.3.17	good lcuk -- -- -Willy	Polite
