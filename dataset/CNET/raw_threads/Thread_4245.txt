After the tech support rep had me do a number of procedures to no avail, he had me open up the tower and reseat some of the circuit boards. Does anyone know whether touching the circuit boards is potentially harmful to the performance of the computer? I know it sounds like a silly question and I admit I am a complete novice when it comes to these things, but I have heard that with other things (like a halogen light bulb), it's important not to get oil or fingerprints on it. Was wondering if the same holds true for circuit boards and other internal &quot;guts&quot; of a computer. My hands were clean, but obviously there's going to be some oil on them. And when you see pictures of workers assembling computers in factories, you see them all wearing rubber gloves. Thanks very much in advance.

THEREFORE immediately and frequently ground yourself by touching any metal of the tower before touching things. Also remember that there is ALWAYS 5 volt standby power on any ATX system, so be sure to remove that by turning the power supply off by the switch on its rear or unplugging it from the wall outlet.
