1.4.1	using ethernet cable directly to the Modem or Router , then the problem is not in the Airport .	St
1.4.2	You have to establish a connection to the internet first to rule out all the variables .	St
1.4.3	Shut down everything , modem/router/switches/airport/computer .	St
1.4.4	Connect the computer directly to the modem .	St
1.4.5	Make sure the computer is set to expect an IP address via DHCP or if you are using PPPoE , that everything in that section is correct .	St
1.4.6	Connect should be via Built-in Ethernet .	St
1.4.7	Bring them back up in the same order , waiting for each one to become ready before firing up the next one .	St

1.6.1	Why/how do you have both a regular router and the airport ex ?	Ques
1.6.2	How about using just the Airport Extreme to serve as the main/only router ?	Ques
1.6.3	It 's N , but backwards compatible to work with your old G or B wireless devices .	St
1.7.1	two separate networks , one upstairs and one downstairs , and for this he uses two routers .	St

1.8.1	both my mini-mac and my powerbook have a strong airport signal from my airport extreme base station .	St
