http://www.intel.com/products/chipsets/gma950/ notes the chipset can be moved up to 224M.
But for the Apple side it's programmed at 64M.
I think I read that with bootcamp they set it to 128M but you can research that.
It's an optional setting that is not exposed to the user to tweak.
I think that's a good thing.
