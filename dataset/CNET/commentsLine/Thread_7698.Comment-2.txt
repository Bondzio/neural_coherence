i've got the corsair voyager 4gb... it's fast, comes with a nice lanyard with metal clip, usb extension cable (nice for tight spaces with mulitple usb devices connected) and 10 year warranty.
so far it's served me well.
take a look at the linke below...lots to choose from.
the patriot extreme performance 4gb flash drive (usb2.0 portable) model pef4g200usb looks interesting too.
fast, lifetime warranty, lanyard (hard to see what it looks like), no extension cable.
let us know what you decide on and how you like it.
