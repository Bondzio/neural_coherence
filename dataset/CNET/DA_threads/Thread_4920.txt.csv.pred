1.1.1	I'm using a Sony VIAO notebook PIV 2.6 w 512 RAM.	St
1.1.2	It has three USB 1.1 ports.	St
1.1.3	As an additional bit of information, this notebook as a Sony Memory stick reader assigned to drive &quot;f&quot; I have a Dell issue 64 MB memory key/stick.	St
1.1.4	The key works fine; I've transferred data using it from other PCs, including my desktop at home.	St
1.1.5	However, when I plug it into any of the USB ports on the VIAO, I can't find it recognized by Windows Explorer or My Computer.	St
1.1.6	It makes the &quot;Noise&quot; that says new hardware has been installed, but I don't see it anywhere.	St
1.1.7	I tried to &quot;map a drive&quot;, but I don't know what or where to map a drive to.	St
1.1.8	My op system is XP Home, SP1.	St
1.2.1	Go get TWEAKUI for XP and make sure no drive letters are hidden.	St
1.2.2	Yes, you may not have hidden such, but you have to check.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well, your answer may not have hit the bullseye, but it sure pointed me in the right direction!	St
1.3.2	The detail I forgot to mention was that I had assigned the G drive designation as a shared network drive.	St
1.3.3	I guess the Sony VAIO had by default assigned the &quot;G&quot; drive for the USB ports.	St
1.3.4	When I remapped the network drive to another letter, I was able to &quot;see&quot; the USB key when I plugged it in.	St
1.3.5	I didn't need to use tweakUI to fix the problem.	St
1.3.6	Thanks again.	Polite
