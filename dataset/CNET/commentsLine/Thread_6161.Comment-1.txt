here is my issue.
i work in an i.t.
office but our wireless guy left and we havent gotten a replacement yet.
this is probably a simple question but i have googled it and cant find the answer.
i have a few doctors that when they take their laptops home and connect wirelessly, the laptop will not find our work wireless when they come back.
we are running vista business with cisco g wireless.
any basic troubleshooting tips would be very much appreciated.
thanks, dean
