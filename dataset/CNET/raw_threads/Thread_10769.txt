Today I noticed in the router status her machine has 3 connections to the internet, while mine has only one. Can someone explain why?

8322	8	559810	5294340	5294324	mccfrank	4/2/12 9:17 PM	1.33340142E12	I'll check that when I get a moment.	I am much more familiar with Linux than XP but I will take a look tomorrow. More to satisfy my curiosity than anything else Should have thought of that myself.
