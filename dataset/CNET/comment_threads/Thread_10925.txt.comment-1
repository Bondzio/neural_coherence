Hi, I am building my own custom rig, and at this point I am trying to pick out parts.
Right now I am looking at trying to find a cpu.
I want to use this rig for mainly Gaming (Battlefield Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3), however I also want to use it for some photo editing and video editing as well.
So my question is what do I want to look for in the cpu?
What speed do I want?
How many Cores?
things like that
