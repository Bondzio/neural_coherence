<s> hi about 6 months ago i purchased a refurbished hp media center m7160n. </s>
<s> Just rencently i purchased a new ati radeon x1600 512 meg PCI-E Graphics card. </s>
<s> After i physically installed and booted up i noticed that there was no display on my monitor. </s>
<s> So i checked in troubleshooting and they said to upgrade my BIOS. </s>
<s> Which is where i am stuck, i cant seem to be able to indentify my motherboard so i can upgrade my BIOS. </s>
<s> I cant seem to find the model # on the motherboard or in BIOS. </s>
<s> I looked up my computer # on the internet and it says that a new one has a Intel 945G Express mainboard. </s>
<s> Would that be the same for a refurbished one? </s>
<s> This issue is making me very frusterated, moderator please HELP. </s>
