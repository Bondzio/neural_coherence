1.4.2	Rick	St
1.5.1	correct!	St
1.6.1	The ADHOC setup would apply.	St
1.6.2	But you might be asking for more than a connection.	St
1.6.3	But until you decide if its worth asking, this will the the ANSWER.	St
1.6.4	Set it up as ADHOC and you can connect to the PC.	St
1.6.5	But missing from your post is what such a connection would do.	St
1.6.6	What documentation?	St

1.8.1	It appears you want your PC to substitute for the router.	St
1.8.2	I will NOT help you get this to work but will tell you the articles and methods that were used a few years ago.	St
1.8.3	The problem is that there are so many steps involved and with today's firewalls most owners can't get it to work anymore.	St
1.8.4	Since it's a TARPIT of issues the smart people don't do this anymore.	St
1.8.5	They get a router.	St
1.8.6	So here goes.	St
1.8.7	You will be installing ICS on the PC.	St
1.8.8	You can use this link as example on what to do next -&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx	St
1.9.1	i success with the first part but the &quot;client&quot; is a PSP so i cant do the setting shown there	St
1.10.1	You have to understand networking.	St
1.10.2	Some can't deal with anyone telling them a generic answer such as &quot;set the gateway&quot; but need a video or pictures that match the exact screens you'll encounter.	St
1.10.3	I have yet to find a cure for such an issue.	St

1.12.1	The cheapest I found is a refurb at frys.	St
1.12.2	20 bucks.	St
1.12.3	Since you can't accomplish the ADHOC and ICS setups you need to move to the usual solutions.	St
1.13.1	i know that i can buy but i want to use with what i have sorry that i dont mention yet but with &quot;MSI US54G&quot; i was able to make a access point with this chipset and i success to connect to him with my PSP and surfing internet and playing multiplayer games because in this chipset there is the &quot;gateway mode&quot; that sharing my cable modem throw &quot;us54g&quot; to PSP or other devices, but now it broken therfore i bought the DWL-g122 eventualy its quite the same device (the &quot;us54g&quot; and the G122) but in this device there is no &quot;gateaway mode&quot; so i ask from you to give me another driver that include that thanks for who will help now i am sure you got me PLEASE HELP!	St
1.14.1	Try other wifi gear since you seem to have hit a dead end with the DWL-g122.	St
1.15.1	there isnt out there some generic driver that i will able to configure the dwl-g122 as a access point or gateaway it must have some	St
1.16.1	All that we have has been discussed above.	St
1.16.2	Sometimes owners really don't want to dive into it so they move to the router and software like Network Magic.	St
1.16.3	In closing, if there was a clue in your posts I'd point it out but as you present the issues there is nothing amiss unless you didn't do the setup proper or firewalled it.	St
1.16.4	Bob	St
1.17.1	i guess i will move to routher	St
