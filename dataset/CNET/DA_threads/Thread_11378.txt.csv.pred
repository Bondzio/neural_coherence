1.1.1	I have 2 Western Digital external drives .	St
1.1.2	The problem I am having is sometimes my photos will be 'gray ' half way down to the bottom .	St
1.1.3	And they become unusable .	St
1.1.4	The wierd thing is this .	St
1.1.5	I recently purchased a slide program that I can SEE the whole photo but if I try to use it I only see a blank black space .	St
1.1.6	But when I click on the photo again from within the program ( not putting it in a slide show ) , what I see is 3 of the same photo one each on top of the other at different levels .	St
1.1.7	I hope this is making sense .	Polite
1.1.8	I am afraid to open my photos on the externals as it ruins them ... has anyone else had this problem or know what it might be that is causing this ?	Ques
1.2.1	It 's unlikely a photo will be ruined by opening it in a viewer .	St
1.2.2	Reasonably speaking , it is n't updated so stays unchanged .	St
1.2.3	To ensure that , set it to read-only from Windows Explorer , My Computer or command prompt .	St
1.2.4	That way it 's safe to experiment with these weird problems , both on your external drive and on internal drives .	St
1.2.5	Kees	St
1.3.1	If you watch these forums you find some are thinking of these drives LITERALLY as & quot ; storage. & quot ; They are storage but should never be thought of your archive or backup .	St
