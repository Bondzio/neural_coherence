i already have 5 partitions showing up, and that i am able to use on the 200gb drive, but the last 2 partitions (of 7 total) are not showing up except as free space in disk management.
i don't want to delete or reformat these partitions because that was where i had all my mp3's stored.
in fact the whole hard drive was full of needed data but i'm only having problems seeing those last two partitions.
even though i have loaded the same drivers as i used before part of me questions whether it is still related to the drivers.
is there a way of verifying that the latest drivers are all installing correctly or is there a program that would detect a faulty driver in this situation?
i'm asking also because i did have a few problems with installing some of the via drivers crashing the system before and causing conflicts in device manager, even though they are supposed to be the standard updated drivers to use.
my other line of thinking goes towards the master boot record being corrupted, but i know very little about that area of expertise.
thanks again.
a.
