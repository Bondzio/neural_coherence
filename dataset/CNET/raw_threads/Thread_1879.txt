Its stays black with a factory message stating that it has no problems and to check the cable connection. I have unplugged, restarted from scratch several times with no luck. I can hear the computer working and doing something but nothings comes up to the monitor. I even have restarted with no other devices connected to my computer. I have a Gateway PC1500, XP, Thanks... ...

If that does not work, can you borrow another monitor to plug in? If it works, then your monitor needs to go to the shop for a new cable. If the substitute monitor does not work, then your video board may need to be replaced. Hope this helps Frank
