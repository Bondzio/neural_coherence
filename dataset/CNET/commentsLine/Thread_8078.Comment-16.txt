please help!
i just got this dell wide screen monitor 19&quot; and it is doing what everyone is complaining about.. making all pictures too wide!
how do you adjust the monitor to correct this distortion?
i use my computer for creating web pages with clinical photos of faces to shoe pre and post operative changes, and this distortion is impossible to work with.
please help!
