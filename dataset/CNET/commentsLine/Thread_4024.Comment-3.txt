thanks for the reply.. i read up on it, and it looks like the x1600 pro is just what i need, and well within my budget.
it also has both vga and dvi interfaces, so i can use it now on my current lcd monitor, and also later if i choose to upgrade to a digital monitor.
btw.. it mentions 'crossfire ready'... what exactly is crossfire?
