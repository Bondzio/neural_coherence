7177	0	243906	2464515	NR	wifi64	4/19/07 3:19 PM	1.17699594E12	New Biostar Motherboard	My Emachine T2682 desktop's motherboard recently died. I replaced the motherboard with a Biostar P4M80-M4 from TigerDirect. Even though it is my first time, I believe I have replaced the motherboard properly and all the wires are firmly connected but when I tried to turn on my computer, no display turned up on my monitor and the lights on my keyboard wouldn't turn on. However,a usb device receives power when plugged in, the fan inside the computer still spins, the lights on the hard drive and power button still turn on and the computer sounds as though it is turning on like it did before the motherboard was replaced. I don't understand why there is no display on my monitor as I have tested it 2 different monitors. Any help would be appreciated.

You need to re-install the OS, but that invalidates the OS as it was supplied, read the EULA. You need a retail version of the OS, as the OEM version won't allow to install or be 100%. Google away but the answer lies as I explained it, any other solution is outside your EULA provided. tada -----Willy

It is true that the computer will not like to boot up when you do a major change like the MOBO but you should at least get to a point where you get error messages that new hardware is found ETC. What was the problem that occurred to make the MOBO change? It could be that it is something else. Was the CPU changed also? How about RAM. When you boot up unplug all except the HDD,Mouse,Keyboard and one optical drive. Post back.

I replaced the blown MB in my eMachines T1742 with the Biostar and now the CPU fan spins, but I don't get any POST beeps or display. I sent the first MB back and got a replacement, same thing. I replaced the memory DIMM, same thing. The board has built-in VGA, LAN, etc and nothing shows on my monitor when I power up. I have double checked all the wiring and it's OK. I sent Biostar an email asking for some tech support. I re-seated the CPU and even tried another of the same CPU I have here and still nothing. I've run out of ideas.

That processor is based on the Wiilamette core and is not supported. Check your manual for CPU support. The original poster in this thread has a T2682. Most of those had a 2.6 Celeron. It's probably too late to help him, as his last post was 4 days ago and he was heading out to buy a video card. If a board has a port to plug in a monitor, then it has onboard video. That is not your problem. Your CPU may have been damaged when the motherboard died. The only way to find out is do what the previous answers said. Plug in just the motherboard, cpu, keyboard, mouse, ram, and monitor. If you don't even get a bios screen, then you'll know it's a hardware problem, and nothing to do with Windows, because you don't have a hard drive plugged in yet.

I double checked, and the CPU is a Northstar. I don't have any spare socket 478 CPUs here, so I'll have to take the box home to work on. Still, it's striking me odd that this particular model is showing up as much as it is on the search engines. Anyone else?

I remove the mtrbd. and place in on cardboard or any &quot;non-conductive&quot; surface. Attach only the kybd., psu, ram, speaker, and video. You don't even need the cpu, power it up and check results and see if the psu fan remains on and if beeps at all. If it does beep like crazy, then add the cpu(it supports) and see if beeps goes away. of course add cpu with power-OFF. Attach more as things progress. If problem remains at the beginning, then the psu is kaput. There's a chance the mtrbd. maybe at fault, you can't do much if you can't get the bios at least to display. It suggests something power or the mtrbd. itself. That's about as basic it gets. I certainly would look at any possible jumpers, or sws. it may need to be set and review the manual, etc. to verify all that. But, if a user intriduced mistake is at fault from the begiing it may have taken the mtrbd. down, especially if the real problem is a bad psu. You just won't know that unless you have a spare psu to check things out. AND if the psu took out the mtrbd. it may reproduce the same symptoms as bad psu, it won't display. In other words you have dual problems at least. tada -----Willy the mtrbd. is now kaput due to bad psu.

Biostar may not like the slower PC2100 ram if it expects at least PC2700 and can't be changed if no bios display if possible to accept slower ram. Just FYI. -----Willy
