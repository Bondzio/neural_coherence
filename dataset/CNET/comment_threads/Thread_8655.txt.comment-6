I have been on the phone with Sun a little bit and got some reccomendations on which machines they think would suit my needs.
I have also done some researching on IBM, Dell, HP and a few others machines also.
I would just like to get some information about what others out there are doing and how it is working out for them.
Not to mention we WILL NEED long term support for this hardware so if Sun is in financial disaray that could be disasterous.
It is imperative that we not have this hardware be unsupported.
If it were to go down.....lets just say many bad things that would effect us all WOULD happen.
