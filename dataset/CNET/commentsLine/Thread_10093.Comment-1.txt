i just purchased a new maxtor 200 gb usb 2.0 hard drive because my old drive was going to crash.
i transfered all of my files to the external drive and everything went fine.
i then installed a new internal hard drive and set up windows.
i loaded up the software for the maxtor hd and everything was installed but the drive isn't showing up in my computer.
i set it up in disk management but when i try to double click the drive it says that it's not formatted, do i want to format now.
what do i do?
i don't want to have to reconnect the old drive and transer stuff over again.
is there something i did wrong?
