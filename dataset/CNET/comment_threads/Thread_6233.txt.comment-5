I was disappointed with sata when I fist tried it because of the messy drivers for it.
IDE is still much easier.
I have a new AGP mobo because I couldnt afford to upgrade my vid card at the same time.
I regret it.
PCIe video cards are much cheaper for performance than AGP.
However because PCIe is taking over, you should be able to make a really nice budget agp system that will handle older games like counter strike source on low settings and anything older than that on high settings.
