<s> Hi I have just bought a Samsung Series 7 Ultra touch laptop (model:NP740U3E-S04UK). </s>
<s> I want to upgrade the stupidly small capacity 128GB SSD to at least 240GB maybe 512GB. </s>
<s> [Samsung only sell the 128GB SSD here in the UK because we are a 3rd world country and that's all we deserve. </s>
<s> Whereas Germany gets not only a 256GB SSD but also an i7 rather than an i5 CPU, but don't get me started...] I phoned Samsung and they refused point blank to tell me what SSDs would fit and said I *had* to go through one of their Authorised Service Centres. </s>
<s> &quot;Or lose the warranty.&quot; But this would cost &#163;90 just for them to look at it! </s>
<s> I understand that my laptop uses mSATA. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me if any mSATA disk would work in fact? </s>
<s> Is it hard to install? </s>
<s> What would be the best mSATA SSD that money could buy? </s>
<s> (in UK) Btw, should I worry about parts of the SSD wearing out and if so what action should I take? </s>
<s> (e.g. </s>
<s> partitioning the drive, having a v large drive etc) J </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-ram-endurance,3475.html I'm curious why folk are buying into limited life span products. </s>
<s> At least you know and will keep a few spare backups. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> As to the other items, too risky to answer. </s>
<s> Samsung was pretty clear about this. </s>
<s> Speaking to Samsung they told me it as an mSATA disk. </s>
<s> However according to the Samsung instructions ( http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201307/20130715120101546/Win8_Manual_eng.pdf0 it has a: &quot;7mmH SATA HDD SSD&quot; (which I assume specific type of mSATA, but surely it's not a Hard Disk Drive (HDD), it's just a Solid State Drive (SSD)... </s>
<s> (! </s>
<s> ). </s>
<s> And they install both a SSD and a HDD. </s>
<s> I can't write at length since I'd be duplicating the web. </s>
<s> You could get the laptop, decide to forgo the warranty and then open it up to figure it out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Got it - no, the manual was being vague and covering several models. </s>
<s> Bob nods a lot today. </s>
<s> OK so if I stuff my PC with enough RAM it might double the life span of the SSD. </s>
<s> I think my NP740U3E-S04UK can take 10GB although I have seen 14 and even 16GB quoted. </s>
<s> I always keep the data mirrored and archived, but I suppose it would be worth doing backups of the entire SSD using whatever Windows 8 provides. </s>
<s> Well that's an understatement. </s>
<s> With each Windows release I hope the backup and restore would be without issue but so far, without fail you find folk backing up but can't get the restore to work. </s>
<s> Here I have a few new Windows 8 laptops and the factory restore fails. </s>
<s> Fortunately Samsung didn't rely on Microsoft. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> utility that will identify your system components down to the mfg/make, series and model number of the SSD. </s>
<s> Armed with that info, you should be to go on the WWW to get the dimensional info on the SSD allowing you to find a drive of choice that fits within the dimensional limitations. </s>
<s> From there it's up to you. </s>
<s> Re RAM...you need to check your system specs as you SHOULD use RAM in matched pair....2 SODIMMs at 4GB for 8GBs, 2 SODIMMS at 8GB for 16GBs and so on. </s>
<s> When you mix capacities like an 8GB SODIMM and a 4GB SODIMM, you usually lose the benefit of systems dual channel (128bit) operation. </s>
<s> Let us know how it turns out. </s>
