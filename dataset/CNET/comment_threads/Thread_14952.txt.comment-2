If don't want to spend too much money, the Intel PRO 3945 is a wireless-a/b/g adapter, so you don't need to purchase a wireless network adapter.
Any plain wireless-g (or a/g) router will work with that network adapter.
You can get one for as little as USD$30.
Stick with major brands like Netgear, D-Link, and Linksys.
