I have had to replace the hard drive and so I am currently installing a new copy of xp. I have downloaded all the drivers from asus.com and will start installing those when the operating system in completely installed. I was wondering if anybody had thoughts on the order in which the drivers should be installed. I would also like to know what is not necessary and which optional programs I should install. I have been to the asus site but they had no suggestions that I could find. Thank you.......
