The initial reviews and hands on use are coming up short.
While I'm sure there is a market for tablet PCs that market has been attempted some dozen times with too many dead bodies of company to say that it's finally here.
Initial reviews often write &quot;clunky&quot; when you see Windows Icon Mouse Pointer (WIMP) interfaces.
For tablets it's different enough that you don't want WIMP.
