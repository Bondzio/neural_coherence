<s> I recently had to replace my computer running XP to a new one with Vista. </s>
<s> I am using an HP photosmart 2610 Printer. </s>
<s> When using XP I had the option of printing both sides Manually, I do not have this option with Vista. </s>
<s> Has anyone else had this problem? </s>
<s> Do you have driver version 080.001.237.000 from http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList?os=2093&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&product=421139&lang=en ? </s>
<s> Yes I have downloaded that software & drivers but still do not gat the option to manually print on both sides Dave </s>
<s> In word I can print the odd pages then re-insert the sheets and then the even sheets. </s>
<s> -&gt; Yes, you have to ask HP if they dropped double sided printing. </s>
<s> They have done so many times before. </s>
<s> Or there is another reason like Office 97 on Vista. </s>

<s> I have the HP Photosmart 8250 and have the that problem since day one with Vista, so it's not just your model. </s>
<s> After many calls to HP I was told they have no plans on fixing the problem. </s>
<s> My neighbor bought a new HP computer and printer and it wouldn't print two sided, so it appears that HP has totally dropped double sided printing just as Bob said. </s>

<s> Thanks to all of you for your reply's, Guess that when I go shopping for a new printer it will not be an HP. </s>

<s> My cousin just bought a Kodak all in one, I don't know the model number. </s>
<s> It prints two sided documents using Vista without any problems at all. </s>
<s> That will be my next printer, enough of HP. </s>
