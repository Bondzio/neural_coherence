i ordered a hp 400 watt micro-atx power supply from hp.
what are the amps on the 12v rail of that psu?
the 12v rail powers the cpu, video card, motherboard, and some other important stuff, so you want to have at least 20a on the 12v rail.
the more amps, the more power that can be delivered to the devices that it's powering.
ie: if the psu has 10a on the 12v rail, you multiply 10x12, and get 120. that means that 120 watts are available for all the devices powered by the 12v rail.
a single high-end video card can use more than 100 watts of power, so you get the message.
