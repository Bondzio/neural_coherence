upgrading motherboard and cpu means purchasing another xp license, too.
add a video card upgrade and it's likely you will also need to upgrade your psu.
i'd keep it &quot;as is&quot; and use it as a general purpose machine (word processing, internet, music/video watching, etc.).
i'd build a new machine centered around an intel core 2 duo cpu as a first choice.
another option would be to start with an amd athlon 64 x2 (socket am2) cpu.
