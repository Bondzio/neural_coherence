<s> Hi, is anyone using Credant/Mcafee/Winmagic/CoSosys for Mac in order to encrypt USB devices? </s>
<s> I'm trying to find the best solution for encrypting devices and have many questions about the whole thing... thanks! </s>
<s> Which discussion should we use? </s>
<s> I know the easylock solution from my officer where we have to use with USBs on Windows to encrypt data but it also works in the same way on Mac. </s>
<s> I also use it at home (Mac only) and cannot say how simple it is. </s>
<s> haven't even considered trying another USB encryption tool. </s>
<s> I have to agree with Carl. </s>
<s> Since I've lost a usb stick with some personal stuff, I decided not to use this type of tiny device without encryption ever again. </s>
<s> EasyLock is the easiest tool I found. </s>
<s> I'm telling you...you just have to drag and drop the files in the encrypted side, and it's all done. </s>
<s> Does EasyLock encrypts the entire drive (like a zip file or something) or each file? </s>
<s> (trying to understand can I have an encrypted and non-encrypted folders on the same device?) </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> I use easylock like you say, with easylock all files go in a folder but are separately encrypted so not like a zip. </s>
<s> And I keep some files also unencrypted on the device. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your answers guys! </s>
<s> Still will be happy to hear about the solutions of Credant / Mcafee / Winmagic if anyone had tried those...? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
