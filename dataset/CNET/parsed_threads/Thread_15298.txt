<s> Hi, My Acer Aspire M1640 desktop of two years died suddenly. </s>
<s> It was checked by an IT chap who noted that it doesn't even give a beep on start up. </s>
<s> We can hear the fans and the HDD calibrate but then nothing else. </s>
<s> He checked that the right voltage is flowing through. </s>
<s> So it seems that the motherboard is gone kaput. </s>
<s> So my question is, if I am going to replace the motherboard, could I upgrade to a new motherboard, chipset and processor (like i3 or i5). </s>
<s> Does is make technical and financial sense. </s>
<s> It is for my daughter who is a keen artist and does do a lot of drawing/ painting stuff on it. </s>
<s> Upgrading OS and other software is not an issue. </s>
<s> You will need to verify the physical sizing aspects of the new mtrbd. </s>
<s> but in most cases they follow the baby ATX size factor, to include the required mounting holes. </s>
<s> You need to consider buying yet another PSU to help power it all when done. </s>
<s> The current PSU maybe too skippy on power, probable 250-300W unit thus typical new system is in the 500W range or better. </s>
<s> You may want to try the new PSU just to see if it corrects the present problem. </s>
<s> That and getting the feel for the repair/swap process. </s>
<s> Otherwise, for the cost of new rebuild system, you can check pricing on new entry level systems. </s>
<s> They are quite decent now in price for the Xmas season and selling before the end of the yr.. At least compare it all to a total DIY project. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks Willy, you have understood the dilemma of a dad at Christmas time!! </s>
<s> New machines with an i3 processor seem to still cost about ?500 here in the UK. </s>
<s> But the poor girl likes (and is good at) drawing pictures so don't want to burn my fingers again if the new system is underpowered! </s>
<s> The mobo is a mini-ATX so I will look out for a similar sized replacement. </s>
<s> The IT person who checked my PC found a steady supply voltage of 12V and 5V in the relevant areas so I am interested in your suggestion about replacing the PSU. </s>
<s> Would that give more safety and peace of mind. </s>
<s> Also, what if I just upgraded the motherboard/CPU/RAM to something more contemporary (built around an i3 processor). </s>
<s> Would I be able to use the rest of my components or have to change them too. </s>
<s> Apologies if that is a silly question, but I am a novice in hardware but keen to get the most bang for my buck. </s>
<s> Cheers, Vivek </s>
<s> I mentioned the new PSU as you're already doing a mtrbd. </s>
<s> replacement, it's a good time to swap the PSU as well. </s>
<s> Plus, you mentioned the system just up and died. </s>
<s> That usually means to me the PSU, even though voltages are present doesn't mean the &quot;amps&quot; are there to power things. </s>
<s> Regardless, it would be a good move to swap the PSU during this time and buy a larger wattage unit. </s>
<s> That along with the new demands of a new mtrbd., etc., is a good match. </s>
<s> As for the rest of the components, test elsewhere if possible. </s>
<s> Build small, then add as you expand the system, that way you do a simple test and get a feel for what's installed. </s>
<s> You also help yourself by reducing what could be causing a problem, should one arise. </s>
<s> Verify any jumper/setting/config that maybe needed, take your time and proceed at your own pace. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
