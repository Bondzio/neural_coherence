The connection is *very good*, but when I try to download the speeds vary from 8kb/s-&gt;20kb/s. I have tried everything from calling Netgear to cleaning out my computer, nothing has worked. If anyone might have any suggestions it would be very helpful. Thanks

Add this that the wifi signal can travel out and reflect back to distort the transmission means that only under ideal conditions it's all good. You didn't tell much in your post such as if you are following our suggestions in the forum sticky so I hope you can use that or tell us the full details. Bob

I had the exact opposite problem in which my two oldest using wireless would almost steal the entire bandwith, even though I was hardwired to the modem. To slow them down and give me back bandwidth I disabled the WMM support and gave me High priority and them both Low priority settings. Bandwidth control can also be enabled in such section. Since you seem interested in faster wifi, just do the opposite.

Just 2 weeks ago I was downloading at a constant 120 kb/s. 10 days ago I installed a video card but I left the network card untouched, but after that the card has been acting weird. I download at speed from 8-12kb/s which is very depressing. Help would be appreciated.Thanks!
