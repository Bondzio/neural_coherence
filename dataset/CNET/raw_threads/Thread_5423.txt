If I connect my scanner, the printed wont' work. I also can't get an embroidery digitizing program to recognize the scanner.

Proffitt	11/23/04 3:02 PM	1.10122212E12	What Printer won't work when scanner is connected	You didn't tell much, but let me share that parallel port scanners are fairly DOA for support since they were problems even back then. You get to dig out the trouble guide and try it all again. Bob

Then try scanning something simple, like text, to see if you are getting a printing connection. I always try to stick to One MFG if I have 2 separate devices....just for the reason of compatibility.
