my 2-cents... you have a very good chance of having the hd work if you replace the pcb itself.
you don't ever need to remove the hd cover, just the card.
while data can be recovered i consider more than a 50/50 chance of doing ok. whatever made the pcb smoke in the 1st place can resurface, but usually these are the stepper or controller ics burning up provided there is no physical internal disk damage will work with a pcb replacement.
