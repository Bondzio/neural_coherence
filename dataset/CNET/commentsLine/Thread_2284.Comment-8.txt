the above answers are fine for imovie or idvd, but not for real-world editing.
users of premiere pro, final cut or after effects know that 1) a fast cpu and lots of ram are 100% necessary, and 2) real-time rendering of your effects operations (anything other than straight cuts) requires a faster video card with more ram.
why?
because when you do cross fades, color corrections, and any number of special effects like transitions, compositing and the like, the mac must process your video frame by frame so you can preview it.
if you don't have a pretty fast cpu and several gigs of ram, you will have to wait for the processed video before you can watch instead of making changes and seeing the results as you work.
special effects in particular (think apple's motion) flatly require a mid-level or higher video card to work at all.
(as an aside, you want the biggest screen you can afford, like the 24&quot; imac for example, to edit and hold all your palettes and windows.
small screens make editing miserable.
even a second monitor such as a 22&quot; dell would be a smart purchase.)
so you may need a mid-to-high-end imac or macbook pro to do real-time editing without choppy or delayed playback.
and a mini or macbook probably won't be fast enough unless you like to sit on your hands while your minutes of footage render.
i bought a mid-level mac pro for that very reason...and even upgraded to the top-end $300 ati x1900 video card to guarantee good performance.
it wasn't cheap, but it will run anything you throw at it and be useful for years.
consider this purchase an investment that will pay itself off after three or four decent editing gigs.
