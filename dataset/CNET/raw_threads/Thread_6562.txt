Belkin Wireless G Plus MIMO	Hey everyone, I've just purchased a new Inspiron E1705 with the Intel PRO/Wireless 3945a/g card, and I'm going to have Comcast as my provider. I've read through the CNET and user reviews for both extensively, as well as a few other reviews on the web. I've done as much research as my brain can handle, and I think I've narrowed my router choices down to these two. Range is no issue right now, but I'll probably be moving to a larger house next year. I do plan on downloading files which can run several gigs. I'll probably do some online gaming, although I'm not really a hardcore gamer. I'd like to eventually upgrade to n wireless once the technology stabilizes. Also, for now, just the laptop will be on the network, although I might add devices to it later. My only other concern right now is price, but if the Pre-N is worth the extra, I have no problem making that investment. Does anyone have any recommendations about the pros and cons of each of these routers? Thanks in advance for your time!

Your current laptop cannot use the pre-N capabilities. 2.) Since this is Pre-N (in other words the standard has not yet been established) why not wait for the Real N to debut and know that you have the standard, not just someones interpretation of the standard? Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.

In the review, it was stated that the Pre-N router is compatible with b and g: &quot;Belkin's router is compatible with standard 802.11g and 802.11b gear for now, but in order for you to reap the router's full performance benefits, you'll need to use it in combination with Belkin's Pre-N PC Card adapter.&quot; Am I misinterpreting this?

So, why not wait till the &quot;real N&quot; debuts and get the proper standard, not just someones interpretation of the standard? You can buy a cheap G class router for about 30 bucks and use it with the notebook. Then, when real N debuts and you get your &quot;other&quot; system you can upgrade knowing that you have a defined standard that can be used by almost any card/router combination. As it stands now, you will have to use all of one manufacturer's card/router combination, forcing you to lock in with one company. What happens if the card or router go bad say eighteen months down the road? You may not be able to find that exact make/model that you have locked yourself into forcing a complete new setup. There are just too many unknowns to lock yourself in this way in my opinion. Gosh I hope all this makes sense.
