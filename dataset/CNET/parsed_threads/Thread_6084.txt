<s> Hi, i just bought a Nvidia 64mb PCI video card for my custom made computer, before it had a AGP ATI Rage Maxx Fury video card that wouldn't work with windows XP, so i bought the Nvidia so i could upgrade to windows xp. </s>
<s> The problem is that i installed it, and when i went to turn on the computer, nothing shows up on the screen. </s>
<s> What can i do to fix this problem? </s>
