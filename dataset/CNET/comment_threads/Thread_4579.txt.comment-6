Ok there!
I'll buy that product as soos as I can....problem is I live in Italy, so if I buy it in US via AMAZON it will take ages before being dispatched at home.
Maybe I'd better buy here in my local town even thogh at present don't know where to go (PC shop??)
Did you have ever experience similar cases as mine?
I mean, could the two issues mentioned above be really due to canned air and dust inside the radiator of my Acer laptop?
