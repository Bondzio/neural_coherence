you didn't supply full details of your system.
what wattage psu, amount of ram, etc.
age of mtrbd.
the whole 9 yds., we can only guess and even then it could be anything when it comes to such issues.
my preference has always been to swap out the psu for a higher wattage unit.
on top of that, since its a reoccurring problem you need to recheck your work from day 1. i'll say it in simple terms, &quot;don't take anything for granted&quot;.
use ram tester, memtest86, google for it.
next, sometimes reducing the system to the simplest it can be may help.
if you doubt the case, then a teardown and check all cables, etc., and see if that's an issue to include mounting brackets, posts, proper grounding, you name it has to be checked.
there's also the chance of a bad mtrbd.
to include the infamous &quot;bad caps&quot; issue, google for it.
then there's the outyside chance there was damage due to heat stress.
the damage is already done but it works now and then until final failure.
a power leg of the psu could be lacking, better psu or less power demands.
cheap or old components that finally start to show why they're cheap, it happens.
a mismatch of components dragging out ram into new system where its being pushed or if you've oc'ed , it reaches a breaking point.
i'll leave it at that...come back with results.
