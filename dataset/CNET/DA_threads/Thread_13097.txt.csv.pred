1.1.1	I have a home entertainment system setup with a Toshiba HDTV as a second monitor.	St
1.1.2	It works fine, except that both monitors keep on resetting their resolutions upon boot-up.	St
1.1.3	Both monitors would normalized to their original resolutions if I launch Media Center (in full screen) and then close it.	St
1.1.4	I use a Norwood Micro 15.4&quot; LCD as my primary monitor set to 1024 x 768, and the Toshiba 62HM15A 62&quot; DLP Projection HDTV as my secondary monitor set to 1280 x 720.	St
1.1.5	Both are maximum settings.	St
1.1.6	The display is set-up to &quot;extend Windows desktop&quot; onto the Toshiba.	St
1.1.7	Any advice is greatly appreciated.	Polite
