i'm not so sure what you really want to do, but let's give it a shot.
if you cloned your desktop, your mouse pointer shouldn't pop-out on the other mnonitor.
sound like you decided to span your desktop instead?
anyway, most games would lock your mouse to the primary monitor when full-screened.
that way theres no chance of your mouse moving all the way to the secondary monitor.
the only way you can play a game and work at the same time is if you open a game in window-mode.
also, active windows shouldn't minimize automatically even if you activate another one on the other monitor.
life is good
