i have an external usb drive and i tried to get 2 drives working on the ide side of the usb inards but when i hook up the drives (1 master and 1 slave), only one drive shows up in windows xp pro...i figured that usb does not support multi-ide drives as master and slave but not sure...can anyone help?
(drobos are too expensive!)
