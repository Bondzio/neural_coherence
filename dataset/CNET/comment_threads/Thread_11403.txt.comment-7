Thanks, Josh.
To clarify, the main PC (which is connected directly to the router) is in the living room.
My PC (connected via wireless adapter) is up a very small flight of stairs and down a corridor, so the distance between them is not quite *THAT* dramatic.
But I do see your point.
Right now, it is set on channel 6, so I am wondering is switching over to channel 11 might make a difference?
FYI, the speed appears to be pretty much the same on both computers.
My bigger concern is the fact that, previously, I have tried to enable WEP protection for our network, only to have problems when I would then try to enter the passcode when prompted on my PC.
I have yet to try this again since we got the cable internet working, but I am wondering if the same thing might happen?
I would like to have *SOME* level of protection, but it was not allowing me to do so before.
