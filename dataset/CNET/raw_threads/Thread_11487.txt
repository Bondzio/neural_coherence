I also have a notebook computer that will use wireless to connect to the Internet. How secure are my wireless connections to my router via the notebook and what keeps someone else (like a neighbor) from connecting to my router? Is there a way to exclude unauthorized users? What do I need to do? Thanks!

It no longer is enough since I could have KISMAC and walk past the usual WEP/WPA/LEAP in minutes. Link to video -&gt; http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1021256519470427962 Bob PS. There are more tools out there but I'll just note one.

Then you need to change the password and just my suggestion because it is known to work and there is less holes in the encryption is to use WEP 128 bit encryption and change the password from Admin to whatever you want. I would do all this by consoling into the wireless router by typing the IP addess into the web browser.Make sure you are hard wired into the wireless router into the internet port once you have connected your ISP modem to the router. For linksys I know it is 192.168.1.1 and that will take you into the router. You also need to setup the drivers and so forth. Anyway I hope that helps and if not let me know if this did not make sense. Zerochaos

I've determined not to do any secure browsing on my notebook, but I don't know how to determine its address.

During the setup of your Linksys, the setup software should have generated an alpha-numeric code for you to either write down or print. You would then have needed this code to connect your wireless hardware to the router. Otherwise, the router will not let you connect. If this never took place, or you bypassed it in some way, then your network is unsecured. Anyone outside your home or in a home nearby would be able to log in. But if you went through setup properly, and got the generated code from the router, you have nothing to worry about.

That's your MAC address. It is also on the NIC's themselves unless it's integrated with the motherboard.

Of course you should also enable the other security measures such as encryption and MAC address filtering.

Nobody seems to have mentioned to disable broadcasting your SSID, so that your wireless network is invisible to the casual drive-by. Routers and access points are normally set to broadcast the SSID because it makes it easier to set up but once set up, you should change the SSID to something other than the default value and stop broadcasting it - all on your router control panel. You then enter your new SSID in your notebook's settings and the wireless card/chip will seek out that SSID but nobody else will see it. As others have said, enable WEP/WAP at the highest bit setting your router supports and enable MAC filtering.

9679	13	200346	2157360	2151997	schlice	8/25/06 7:53 AM	1.15649238E12	I must only disagree slightly	While no wireless security is yet unbreakable, WPA offers you significant advantages over WEP: IV Length is twice as long and IV values are not replayed WPA does not directly use Master Keys Message Integrity Checking is far improved WPA includes secure key management So if your router and network card offer it, I would strongly suggest enabling WPA-PSK (pre-shared key) over WEP. It's at least more secure than WEP (which as you saw in the video, isn't saying (too) much. But it is the precursor to 802.11i, which will be even better than WPA. As you all correctly indicated, WEP/WPA, much like locked doors, are only designed to keep honest people out. Anyone who truly intends to break in to your wireless network will indeed do so. What you should aim to do is make it hard enough to do that the casual hacker won't be able to do it in 10 minutes like the guy in the video. WPA will provide that level of security. You also talked about being afraid to do secure transactions over your wireless connection. If the site you are working with is secure (i.e. you see https:// in the address bar, or you see the lock icon on the bottom of the browser window), the data is encrypted end to end from your browser, over your network, to the host computer. This includes the transit between your computer and the wireless router. In short, as long as you're on a secure site, there is not an issue regarding someone seeing your secure-type traffic over the wireless.

Internal Networks are not accessable from the outside, wireless networks are accessable within 'the zone'. I have wanted to use this link for quite a while http://www.cs.umd.edu/~waa/wireless.pdf#search=%22Wireless%20Network%20No%20Cloths%22 Now what you should ask is WHY someone would want to hack your net. The answer is simple, simply obserbing over the air transmissions can allow a person to gain access to sensitive infromation (such as your name, credit card, and possibly your SSN). This, of course, would be infromation gathered though your daily use of the net. Most people have their names associated with their accounts, many people shop online, and some people use online bill paying. Now before you go proclaiming that it is https remember that this guy is not hacking the WEBSERVER but just listining in to what you are broadcasting. Now the real issue is the chances that a person would be skilled enough or care enough to try hacking YOUR network WOULD try hacking your network. I guess that it would better depend on where you live... Personally, I say that the chances are negligable, Identity theft may be common, but getting a wireless network sniffer working and learning how to filter the infromation out takes time. Lots of time... Eventually people may start making a practice of it, but when can not be said for certain.

Basically, if your browser DOES encrypt the data that means it must recieve a encryption key or generate one. Both of these can be caught durring the transmission. If the encryption key is generated via algorithm and you are sent the algorithm then all you need is to procure the algorithm and inplement the propper variables.
9679	21	200346	2166278	2156885	Merranvo	8/29/06 7:33 PM	1.15687998E12	Only if..	Only if a person does not attempt to hack it. I can not say for certain what protocol LinkSys employs but the sad fact is that Wireless protocols are flawed. It can be beat even if it is automatically set up.

A) WEP or WPA protection is the primary defense B) Limiting MAC address's. Takes very little time to bypass but it is a 'little more' protection C) Some routers will allow you to set IP Ranges. (Basically the amount of 'ports' allowed) I am not certain of the weakness' here except that if an additinal person needs to access your network you need to add an extra port. D) Disabling SSID Broadcast Note, D can cause issues with older hardware.

Now given that you are using a palm you may beable to find a software hack that with patch it. I am not certain if it is purly software or hardware causing the limitation, but it may be worth a try.

In addition, wireless extenders, game wifi adapters (zero config ones especially), wifi cameras and more fail spectacularly without SSID broadcasts. It's not much of a security leak issue so I only disable it when asked to do so. Also some drivers (even new ones) on some wifi cards fail without it. This advice in my view has made money for my tech friends as they roll out to fix it. Bob

Just WPA/PSK with a dictionary	For most run-of-the-mill routers these days, if they support it, choose WPA/AES. Better yet, if you can, choose WPA2/AES (although WPA/AES is about the same). The links proclaiming WPA is cracked all seem to say the WPA machines which were WPA/PSK, and were cracked by using a dictionary-type of crack on passcodes that were short words from the dictionary. So if you use a long password full of gobblety-**** characters, you are still very safe. Something like: a3k58f8wey53di238skd3i2201w1 or whatever number of characters you can put in for a max.

For one, any hacker that wants to see you can EASILY do so with just about any hacking program. Heck, my stupid little $40 wifi-finder finds hidden SSID's now. The only advantage to hiding your SSID is to keep free-wifi hopefuls from finding you easily and stealing your bandwidth. And if you have any form of security on, these types of people won't want to waste the time trying to hack your wifi -- they'll just move on and try to find another open wifi signal somewhere down the street. Don't waste your time with it.

If you are looking for a 'how-to-hack' guide you need to look past simple blog sites. First, I am no expert in the matter but the fact is that with wireless networks may be. A) Encrypted, meaning that to gain access to the data in the stream you need a decryption code and/or algorithm B) Protected, to procure your own stream you need to meet certain requirements and send it to the router. Encryptions is just a matter of procuring or generating an algorithm, and protected is just a matter of sniffing out the key. There IS no 'safe' wireless network protocol because they all involve the transpher of infromation in the open. Getting an encyption algorithm probally is much harder then simply breaking a protection seal, but it is not impossible.

Wireless communication is inherently insecure as evidenced by the articles presented earlier in the topic by several contributors. The key issues to understand are: 1.) Am I susceptable to an attack? If you are using wireless then the answer is unfortunately yes. 2.) Will I suffer from an attack? That depends on where the wireless is being used. For a typical home network, the prevalent answer is probably not. With basic precautions - WPA/PSK and MAC filtering, the odds are quiet small as the time required to break the key involves days of hacking. Most of us would be observant enough to notice a strange vehicle or person sitting within 100-200 feet of our house, using a computer, to attempt to hack there way through the authentication process. The hacker would simply look for the ''unsuspecting'' user who isn't using any, or very little, protection. Also, lets be honest here, the odds of an interception of critical information, at the exact time of transmission, are rather remote. The more important issue is leaving confidential data vulnerable should a network breach occur. By instituting strict firewall rules, eliminating shared folders, and encrypting sensitive data (credit card numbers, password files, etc.) you present a profile that the neighborhood hacker will avoid. A dedicated hacker will always get through eventually, but the average home user just doesn't have data ''worth'' the time and effort required. Parking lot attacks on businesses are a much more attractive target for these hackers. While security should always be a concern, it should be tempered with common sense.

Many routers will sense a flood attack and block it these days. But that's just the start of it. WPA/PSK has NOT been broken in any other circumstances, such as where the password was something like a38fnn38aeaj38ayu322adeo. If it has, please provide us with a link. And WPA/AES is even stronger.

The MAC computer had to be connected to that access point. Any wifi dummy knows that you shouldn't connect to a random open access point belonging to some unknown individual and expect to be fully secure. It doesn't matter if you are running all of the security in the world, if you connect to a foreign machine, you have to know that you are taking a risk. This was NOT a demonstration on someone using their laptop to grab a signal from a random company's wifi access point out in the field, and then hacking into it via device drivers. This is a demonstration of a 3rd party computer hooking into their access point, then they were able to do damage to the other computer. I also saw absolutely no mention of whether WPA or even WEP was employed. That wouldn't matter much anyway, if you connected to a 3rd party AP that wasn't part of your own system.

It was a great idea but the extra AP was not the target of the attack. You seem to think this stuff is secure. It's not.

I agree, with all bits being utilized, with random numbers and letters, it has not been proven to be broken, based on your criteria. By the same token, my point was that the average hacker will/can not make themselves vulnerable by sitting within 100-200 feet of your house, trying to break your key for hours at a time without being noticed. The average home user doesn't have data valuable enough to warrant that type of attack, and if they did, they wouldn't be using wireless, they would be using an ethernet cable, IPSec encrytion, and L2TP at the bare minimum. I just want people to use a little common sense along with there security. That's all I was trying to say.

They have not demonstrated how they can &quot;sniff out&quot; a signal from another laptop and just hack into it. I really am bummed that they used a 3rd party card with a MAC. Actually, I am very suspect because they never told us the card's brand name. It's as if they tried to keep it as annocuous as possible so they wouldn't get sued and have to prove it all or something. With that said, I can't disagree with you that eventually, just about anything seems to be compromised eventually. People can be pretty creative in figuring out ways to hack stuff. The more technology there is, sometimes, it seems like the more holes develop. For now, though, I think WPA is pretty safe. Especially for the average home user. I never saw any mention of a firewall in use during that video, or a good live virus scanner. Have to watch that one again.

The keys are generated with a combination of information that is indeed exchanged plus information that is generated locally and kept secret by each party. So even if a &quot;man in the middle&quot; attack sniffs out the info that is traded between the two parties, the keys still cannot be guessed because the eavesdropper cannot determine what info is being held back in secret. That's the miraculous part of the whole affair: that locally-held secret info, together with the info exchanged, can still generate identical keys. Of course if someone hacks your machine and installs a keystroke sniffer, then you're in trouble. But let's not forget how public-key encryption works: that's the standard for secure browsing.

To be absolutely sure, is this statement correct: You also talked about being afraid to do secure transactions over your wireless connection. If the site you are working with is secure (i.e. you see https:// in the address bar, or you see the lock icon on the bottom of the browser window), the data is encrypted end to end from your browser, over your network, to the host computer. This includes the transit between your computer and the wireless router. In short, as long as you're on a secure site, there is not an issue regarding someone seeing your secure-type traffic over the wireless. Is it a sure thing. This is VERY important. If not, please explain. Thanks, Bob

You may be the &quot;show me&quot; type and I'd have to offer exploit with proof for every setup. If one did post all the exploits in one place then that's the cookbook page. You are right that https is great but how to get around the evil twin issue? That one is a stumper. In closing, I hope you understand that wifi needs a rock solid security solution but various governments don't want it to be that secure. I know this because I was on a team doing 2 way wireless paging. Bob

I've always found your answers, to my posts, to be correct and insightful. I'm assuming it's a no. I know of but not about the Evil Twin. Time for some in-depth research. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction! The original statement gave me a false sense of security. I apprecite the background material though. Thanks Bob

Based on what has been discussed (security issues), it probably would not be prudent for me to install wireless IP cameras, unless it is connected to the wireless router via an ethernet connection. Is this correct? I'm looking at the linsys wvc54g model, only because I have a linsys wireless cable router (wcg200). Also, can someone recommend another brand of camera that will work with my current router because based on reviews, this model is some what difficult to set-up, especially for a novice - like me. Thanks.

But beware that I've found most wifi cameras to fail a simple test. Here it is. Set it all up, get the video going. Now drop power to the camera. Count to 20 and then turn the camera power back on. Every single wifi camera system so far never recovers. -&gt; This means this system would never make a good surveillance solution. Too unreliable. Bob

At present the only effective attack against WPA/WPA2, is an offline dictionary attack. If you use a paasphrase for your PSK that consists of a word found in the dictionary, then you are extremely vulnerable. In one demonstation the word sausages was used. I took a little over 3 minutes to retrieve the PSK. When precomputed hashes were used it took only 0.2 seconds. To mitigate this threat, complex random PSK's must be used. Ideally, you want to use a 64 digit hexidecimal. Using a hex of this size negates the offline dictionary attack, since a hex is not going to be in a dictionary file, and a 64 digit hex is used as the Pairwise Master Key, avoiding the hashing procces that creates the vulnerability. This leaves an attacker with one optio, a good old fashion brute force attack. If a 64 digit hex is use then each of the 2^256 possibilities must be check. That comes out to 1.1579208923731619542357098500869x10^77 possibilities. If you could produce a device that could check a billion billion possibilities (no such device exists at present), then it would take you 3.671x10^51 years to check each possibility. Needless to say, this make the brute force method computationally infeasable. If you do not have a tool to produce such a value, simply go to: https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm While there is no such thing as forever secure, (Once upon a time it was computationally infeasable to brute force DES) with a little effort you can make WPA/WPA2 reasonably secure.
