<s> Please help!!!! </s>
<s> My PC keeps re-booting and I couldn't resolve this. </s>
<s> I just got my pc motherboad upgraded with the following: Abit NF7-S (NFORCE2/AGP8X/DDR400/SATA/RAID/1394/LAN) AMD MB AND ATHLON XP3000+ 512MB DDR400 And it's using an old video card and IDE 40GB hard disk: INNOVISION/INNO3D TORNADO GEFORCE2 MX400 (64MB) The system is running on Win XP Pro. </s>
<s> Sometimes, it will re-boot after loading the personal settings. </s>
<s> And sometimes, it reboot before seeing the window setup page. </s>
<s> What could be the possible problem? </s>
<s> Anyone can help? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If it keeps rebooting go to my computer and do a right click then properties then advanced then setting under startup and recover then under system failure unclick automatically restart. </s>
<s> Normally its a driver problem so now you might get a blue screen and it should tell you what problem you have Hope it helps Germansal </s>
<s> Can you get to your desktop at all? </s>
<s> Does your system sometimes freeze up? </s>
<s> What were you doing when the problem first started or was it this way as soon as the upgrade. </s>
<s> If there are not any freeze ups I don't believe its a driver problem. </s>
<s> I think it could be a memory problem or cpu problem. </s>
<s> Go into your Bios and find your memory readings. </s>
<s> make sure they read right. </s>
<s> Look at your clock speed and see if it is right and also check the tempature of your cpu. </s>
<s> It could be running too hot. </s>
<s> It may also be not seated right. </s>
<s> The heatsink and fan may not be seated right. </s>
<s> Did you reload xp after the upgrade? </s>
<s> Did you download SP2? </s>
<s> Give more details. </s>
<s> it could be a lot of things. </s>
<s> maybe even a virus. </s>
<s> Skip </s>
<s> Hi Skip Thanks for responding. </s>
<s> Sometimes, it keeps re-booting so many times that I didn't even get to see the desktop at all. </s>
<s> The system freeze up at detecting the IDE hard disk when before this, there is a series of re-boots. </s>
<s> It will also re-boot itself when I am on the desktop. </s>
<s> When this happens, I will be prompt to start up at safe mode. </s>
<s> And it re-boot itself even when I try starting it up at safe mode. </s>
<s> After the upgrade, I formatted my old 3 yr old 40Gb IDE hard disk which is running on Win98. </s>
<s> And install XP with SP1. </s>
<s> I have not downloaded SP2. </s>
<s> I had installed a 15-day trial Norton Antivirus 2005 to temporarily prevent any virus infection. </s>
<s> When you say the heatsink and fan may not be seated right, do you mean that it is not installed properly on the motherboard? </s>
<s> Would it be any case of IRQ conflict? </s>
<s> I notice that 2 or 3 drivers are sharing 1 IRQ or memory address. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Hi Germansal Thanks for responding. </s>
<s> Yes, I tried what you had recommended and the following message is prompted. </s>
<s> &quot; A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer. </s>
<s> if this is the first time you've seen this STOP error screen, restart your computer. </s>
<s> If this screen appears again, follow these steps: Check to be sure you have adequate disk space. </s>
<s> If a driver is identified in the STOP message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. </s>
<s> Try changing video adapters. </s>
<s> Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </s>
<s> Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </s>
<s> if you need to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and then select Safe Mode. </s>
<s> Technical information: *** STOP: 0x0000008E (0xC0000005, 0x8053DD91, 0xF897CF74, 0x00000000) Beginning dump of physical memory Physical memory dump complete. </s>
<s> Contact your system administrator or technical support group for further assistance. </s>
<s> &quot; I don't quite understand what is to be done from the above message. </s>
<s> Could you advice? </s>
<s> Thanks a million. </s>
<s> GL </s>
<s> Try going to the bios and hit default setting and see if that works. </s>
<s> To get into the bios hit the F1 or the DEL button after you turn the computer on. </s>
<s> But be carefully the bios is nothing to play around with if you don't know what you are doing good luck </s>
<s> I think were both on the right track. </s>
<s> Has this been a problem ever since your upgrade? </s>
<s> If so, I still believe it is heat related. </s>
<s> It will also give you a blue screen to protect your computer. </s>
<s> Try what GL said and see if it works but, in addition to Delete or F1 to get in your bios, I have seen some computers use F2 and all the way up to F8. </s>
<s> You can also try to clear your bios memory by manually changing your jumper on the motherboard. </s>
<s> refer to this in your motherboard manual. </s>
<s> We'll get to the bottom of this. </s>
<s> Mean while I will try to look up your error number on the net. </s>
<s> Talk to you soon. </s>
<s> Skip </s>
<s> your fix may be in SP2. </s>
<s> from what I have read. </s>
<s> you can try it and if it doesn't work you can uninstall it. </s>
<s> If your system will let you get that far without rebooting. </s>
<s> Try to reset bios first, then try removing memory modules if you have more than one. </s>
<s> If you have 2 or 3, take them all out and try putting one in at a time in the first slot and try booting with one. </s>
<s> do this with each one. </s>
<s> If thats not the problem try to uninstall your video driver and reinstall it or look for an upgrade at the manufacturer. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work try to get service pack 2. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work open a side panel and try blowing a fan inside while booting. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work I would wipe the drive clean and reinstall xp. </s>
<s> sometimes an install doesn't always setup properly. </s>
<s> let me know what you have tried. </s>
<s> Skip </s>
<s> Hi Skip As I am not familiar with the resetting of Bios, I have not done the bios reset. </s>
<s> However, I had attempted to remove the memory modules and replacing it back 1 at a time. </s>
<s> It continues to give the same problem. </s>
<s> Next, I uninstall the video driver and reinstall an upgraded one. </s>
<s> This time the problem seems to have gone off for a while. </s>
<s> I can use it for 2 days. </s>
<s> This problem seems to resurface under a particular user account. </s>
<s> (note: I had created a 3 user accounts) The other 2 seems to work fine. </s>
<s> I had disable the automatic re-boot, and a blue screen is presented with the problem messages. </s>
<s> One of the recommendation is to get the windows update. </s>
<s> And I am doing it now. </s>
<s> I will continue to monitor if the problem still persists. </s>
<s> Afterwhich, I will perhaps install XP sp2. </s>
<s> And hopefully it could solve the problem. </s>
<s> I will keep you posted of the development. </s>
<s> By the way, I had another piece of the 40Gb hard disk, and I had tried to reinstall xp. </s>
<s> And it just hang and give me a blue screen with similar error messages. </s>
<s> Hence, I don't think reinstalling would help. </s>
<s> And thank you for taking the trouble to give me all the advice. </s>
<s> GL </s>
<s> If you tried to install windows xp on another partition and, it wouldn't load then either your bios needs to be reset or more likely, i think the problem is where I started in the beginning. </s>
<s> The processor or heatsink fan is not seated right or you are over heating. </s>
<s> There is a cmos jumper on your mainboard. </s>
<s> your motherboard I mean. </s>
<s> It will be shown in the book that came with the board. </s>
<s> There are 3 pins with a plastic cap over 2 of the pins. </s>
<s> The cap is the jumper. </s>
<s> It is small. </s>
<s> Refer to your book to see where exactly it is on the board. </s>
<s> All you need to do is move the cap to pins 1 and 2 for a few seconds and then put the cap back on pins 2 and 3. </s>
<s> Turn off your power to your computer but don't unplug from the back. </s>
<s> the 3 pronged plug is a ground. </s>
<s> also hold on to the metal frame with one hand to stay grounded. </s>
<s> this prevents static which can harm your computer. </s>
<s> After you try SP2 try to reset cmos which is part of your bios. </s>
<s> I want you to do this to reset the configurations mostly for your memory. </s>
<s> reseting the cmos setting by the jumper will clear the bios memory and set it to default. </s>
<s> Hope you can understand this. </s>
<s> If not let me know and we will take it one step at a time. </s>
<s> skip </s>
<s> Hi Skip I tried updating win SP2, but it could not be updated. </s>
<s> Not sure what is the problem preventing it. </s>
<s> Next, I proceed to resetting the cmos, following the instruction stated on the mainboard's installation guidebook. </s>
<s> After this, the problem still persists. </s>
<s> Do you have any idea what these 2 messages mean? </s>
<s> 1. page_fault_in_nonpaged_area 2. </s>
<s> IRQL_not_less_or_equal These appear on the blue screen How do I check if the processor is overheating? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> GL </s>
<s> What is the power supply? </s>
<s> OK, this takes us back to, probably a driver error or possibly a program you have that is not compatible with xp. </s>
<s> What is the exact error code? </s>
<s> Is it the same error code as before? </s>
<s> STOP: 0x0000008E (0xC0000005, 0x8053DD91, 0xF897CF74, 0x00000000)? </s>
<s> If so when you updated your video driver did you uninstall the driver first? </s>
<s> The power supply is 400W. </s>
<s> I got it upgraded together with the motherboard, CPU and ram. </s>
<s> hi there buddy , appears that u r struggling with this problem for quite some time.i have an exactly similar problem on a compaq presario 700 laptop.here's what i did : a. format the drive b. install winxp pro c. after the install , maintain only one account d. do not install any drivers at this stage - let the system run only on the native windows drivers. </s>
<s> e. go to regedit , to the following key - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon f. right click on the right pane and click on string value g. rename this `new string value' to msgina h. right click on msgina , click on modify i. enter the value `c:\windows\system32\msgina.dll j. restart load the chipset driver load the audio driver after all drivers are loaded , load the video driver if this does not correct your problem , NOTHING on earth will. </s>
<s> However , on the positive side , i have noticed this problem on quite a few AMD machines , but hardly never on an intel machine - there might be a problem of overheating of the CPU also. </s>
<s> I have an older emachine with XP Home that is continuously rebooting. </s>
<s> It has the config below. </s>
<s> I searched for pcdsm30.sys on the net but didn't find any references. </s>
<s> Does anyone know which component is failing? </s>
