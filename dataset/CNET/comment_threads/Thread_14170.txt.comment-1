Did advanced search on Canon and info that came up was 1 to 2 years old I have had it with HP.
After buying over a dozen HP printers over past 20 years, seeing HP quality steadly go down hill, I am looking to buy a CANON ALL-IN-ONE printer.
I am looking at various Canon printers (prefer under $150) and would appreciate input on opinions of which is best for ink usage, decent draft printing and reliability.
(My current HP AIO locks up after about every 3 use) I don't print photos, so photo print quality not important.
Thanks Ben
