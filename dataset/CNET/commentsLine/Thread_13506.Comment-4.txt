it works pretty much the same as when you're connected to your cat5 network.
in addition to the set-up described in the previous message for the &quot;client&quot; computer, you first need to make sure the printer is shared (start -&gt; printers & faxes -&gt; right-click on printer to be shared & select &quot;sharing&quot;.
you may also need to check to make sure all computers are members of the same workgroup in order to share resources (right-click on &quot;my computer&quot;, select &quot;properties&quot;, then click on the &quot;computer name&quot; tab.
click on the &quot;change&quot; button if you need to change the workgroup name.
you'll need to restart the computer for the change to take effect.
i actually did this just this afternoon on my home wireless network.
