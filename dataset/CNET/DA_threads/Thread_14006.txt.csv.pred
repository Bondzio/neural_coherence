1.1.1	Hi i was wondering what does superclocked mean i bought a geforce 8800 gts superclocked because it had little better specs but what does it exactly mean?	St
1.2.1	It just means that the clock speed on the GPU was increased by a certain amount (in your card 15%).	St
1.2.2	This gives you increased performance, but really it is just fancy term for overclocked.	St
1.3.1	Can i overclock it more?	St
1.4.1	EVGA e-GeForce 8800 GTS 320 MB Superclocked Today, we are evaluating the EVGA e-GeForce 8800 GTS 320 MB Superclocked (SC) video card.	St
1.4.2	It comes out of the box from EVGA with the GPU core frequency clocked at 576 MHz, the stream processors clocked at 1.35 GHz and the memory clocked at 1.7 GHz DDR (850 MHz actual).	St
1.4.3	The EVGA e-GeForce 8800 GTS 320 MB Superclocked utilizes 1.1ns GDDR3 memory.	St
1.4.4	At 1.1ns we have a theoretical maximum attainable frequency of 900 MHz, so there is room for overclocking.	St
1.5.1	I have the 640mb version and thanks for the info	Polite
