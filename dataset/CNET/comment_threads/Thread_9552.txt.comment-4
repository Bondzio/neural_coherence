I have 5 supermax cards still in the box.
They're there because I procrastinated long enough to see the &quot;pre-n&quot; standard come out.
Even though the W3C hasn't fully adopted the standard (they will) yet I'm going to install Belkin's pre-n routers and controllers.
Good Luck!!
and life goes on... Jack
