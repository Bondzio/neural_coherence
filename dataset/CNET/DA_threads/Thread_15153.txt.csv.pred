1.1.1	hi , i recently bought a 2TB external drive ( Seagate ) .everthing is fine except a small issue.when i access the hard drive or using any files on it , it is ok.if it is left idle for some time ( say 5-10mins ) or no files on the drive are being used the hard drive turns off.And few secs later turns on and i get the autoplay options.Is there any way to get over this ?

1.2.1	First check your windows power settings in control panel , that could be the issue .	Sug
1.2.2	If not it may be a setting in the external drive software , sounds like one or the other .	St
1.3.1	But if I read page 9 of http : //www.seagate.com/staticfiles/support/freeagent/fa_win_ug_en.pdf it looks like you can change it .	St
