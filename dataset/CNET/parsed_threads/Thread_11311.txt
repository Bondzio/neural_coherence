<s> Hello everyone!! </s>
<s> I have a P4 system with an Ausus P4P800-VM motherboard based on the Intel 865 Chipset. </s>
<s> It came with a sound card onboard. </s>
<s> Now I would like to add an additional sound card (any one) to my system. </s>
<s> My Questions are 1) Is it Possible to have both the cards working simultaneously 2) Would it cause any performance losses to the motherboard ? </s>
<s> I would really appreciate your help in this regard!! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If you use Windows, then not any old sound card will offer dual sound card usage. </s>
<s> There is hope for this in Linux, but you didn't tell. </s>
<s> If you use Windows, the answer will be no. </s>

<s> I have Win XP and Win 2k running on my system. </s>
<s> but I didn't quite understand &quot;not any old sound card will offer dual sound card usage&quot; Thankx! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Windows doesn't offer a system to route sound from an application to a specific card. </s>
<s> If it did, this would have made for some very interesting applications of the PC today. </s>
<s> Since you don't run Linux, then it becomes a costly endeavor with cards or devices like http://www.protools.com/products/digi002/systems/002hw.cfm and software to match. </s>

<s> Well Thankx anyway!!!.. </s>
<s> I wanted to use one set if speakers for gaming and another for Music. </s>
<s> But could you suggest anyoyher means of doing this (without using splitters etc..) ..?? </s>
<s> Yhankx!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Get a sound card with both analog and digital audio output. </s>
<s> Use the speaker selection tool that comes with it to select which speaker set to use. </s>
<s> Awkward, but would work. </s>
