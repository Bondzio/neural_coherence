<s> I'm looking for the best deal on a new printer where money is an object (Mine died - a sad and ugly tale). </s>
<s> I've looked at a low end Canon and Dell's web site, which keeps teasing me with low prices. </s>
<s> Anybody have a favorite to recommend? </s>
<s> HI.....I was also looking for a printer that used cheaper ink. </s>
<s> I was tired of paying almost 100 bucks for a black and color cartridge. </s>
<s> I bought EBSON C44 printer for 39.00 on sale and the ink costs 6.95 for black and 7.95 for color.The printer prints better than my expensive printer and the color photos are just fantanstic. </s>
<s> I don't know where you are from, as I live in Canada. </s>
<s> Hope this helped you. </s>
