<s> Looking to buy a desktop under the price of 800 ( but willing to spend a little more to pump up some specs); willing to spend a little of my money after all that hard work for three months (: I have never used a desktop before, since I've always bought laptops. </s>
<s> Despite their portability, I find them lacking in power. </s>
<s> I will be dabbling in video editing so I need huge hard drives as well as a discrete (dedicated) video card. </s>
<s> Also a bit of gaming, but not the high powered, intense kind. </s>
<s> I DON'T CARE WHAT BRAND THEY ARE, JUST PLEASE DON'T HAVE ME BUILD IT MYSELF, BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE A WARRANTY WITH THE COMPUTER SHOULD ANYTHING GO WRONG. </s>
<s> I ALSO DON'T CARE WHAT TYPE OF PROCESSOR IT HAS (AMD OR INTEL ARE BOTH FINE). </s>
<s> -- I already have my monitor and peripherals picked out. </s>
<s> Therefore the computer shouldn't include these. </s>
<s> I decided on a 22&quot; Asus monitor. </s>

<s> http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/Se...mp;sku=L23-6335 And this wireless mouse/keyboard combo for 35. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/Se...mp;sku=L23-7048 -- Thanks in advance </s>
<s> the 'best desktop' is constantly changing once you consider sales and rebates. </s>
<s> here's a $680 tri-core HP with 3gb ram and 640gb drive: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8773455&type=product&id=1203815923971 you'll be able to find similar systems from Gateway, Acer, and Dell. </s>
<s> for some reason, pc manufacturers (and retail shops) charge way to much for video cards. </s>
<s> so its best to add the card to the pc rather than overpay for wimpy card. </s>
<s> here's an $80 8600gt (before $30 rebate) that would cost $150 at retail: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130085 if you don't want to install the card yourself, order it before you buy your pc and let the shop install it for you (about $30). </s>
<s> One that you build yourself. </s>
<s> A refurbished, a used, a donation. </s>
<s> Any of these may work for you. </s>
<s> If you buy those brand pc make sure you save some money for a better video card and some Rams(if need) Most brand pc sell under $800 are include those onboard intergrate videocard. </s>
<s> Once you upgrade the video card your pc will run so good.. </s>
<s> You provided lots of information but still need a. </s>
<s> For $800 the hp mentioned is a nice machine. </s>
<s> There are 3 major companies that still make desktop (HP, IBM, and Dell). </s>
<s> The others only do it as away of supplementing their laptop sales. </s>
<s> I would stick with on of those 3 or go to your good/trusted local computer dealer (not best but/CompUSA) and tell them you want to spend $750 including tax for a decent box with a large hard drive and a full 1 year warranty. </s>
<s> You should get a decent system without the head ache. </s>
<s> I myself an looking for a desktop for under $800, and I've decided on the Lenovo K430. </s>
<s> If you don't like that, another good one is the Lenovo H520. </s>
<s> Either one will do you well, they both come with warranties. </s>
<s> The H520 comes with Windows 8, a 3rd generation Intel Core i7-3770 Processor( 3.40GHz 1600MHz 8MB), NVIDIA GeForce GT630 2GB Graphics, 8GB DDR3 SDRAM at 1600MHz, 2TB 7200 RPM Hard Drive. </s>
<s> The K430 comes with Windows 7 or 8, 3rd generation Intel&#174; Core&#8482; i7-3770 (3.40 GHz, 8MB Cache), NVIDIA&#174; GeForce&#174; GT620 1GB Graphics, up to 32GB SDRAM, 2TB (7,200 rpm). </s>
<s> So in conclusion, the K430 is better in terms of RAM, but for everyday use, both will do you great for a low price. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
