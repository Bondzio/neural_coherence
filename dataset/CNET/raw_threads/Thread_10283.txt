FYI, the reason the poor machine was abandoned is likely due to what happened when the former owner learned about the cost of RDRAM. Be sure to get PAIRS or the RDRAM since... it's installed in PAIRS. Bob

You probably have 4-slots of ram, but being pairs, you quickly fill half of that. Dell, orginally shipped that system with 128mb -OR- 256mb as RDRAM was expensive and still is. For all practical reasons, 256mb is a real must but 512mb is just dandy. Cost for 1gb of RDRAM maybe too high, but ebay should have some reasonable vendors. For the cost of RDRAM alone, you maybe better off buying a cheap entrylevel NEW system like eMmachine or Compaq, that's pretty close to similar amounts of $. tada -----Willy
