1.1.1	Hello, I have a question regarding the compatibility of SATA II on my current rig.	St
1.1.2	I currently have a Seagate ST-3160023AS (Barracuda 7200.7 160 Plus, Serial ATA) as my primary drive.	St
1.1.3	I'm looking at getting a ST-3160812AS (Barracuda 7200.9 160, Serial ATA NCQ) which has SATA 2.0 w/NCQ as a second hard drive.	St
1.1.4	Will the 2nd Barracuda with SATA 2.0 w/NCQ be compatable with my computer, although the primary drive is only Serial ATA?	St
1.1.5	I plan on also purchasing Norton Ghost 10.0 and use that in conjuntion with the two drives.	St
1.1.6	IOW: Will the SATA II drive work on my computer?	St
1.1.7	..with the SATA I cable?	St
1.1.8	...with the SATA II cable?	St
1.1.9	...with the SATA I to II converter cable?	St
1.1.10	...or do I have to buy a SATA I hard drive?	St
1.1.11	I believe my motherboard is a ACPI Multiprocessor PC?	St
