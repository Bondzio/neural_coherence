<s> Hey guys, I was wondering, is it possible to put an LCD and CRT togther for dual monitor?? </s>
<s> If it helps at all, this is my video card: XFX Nvidia 5200 http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=588461 mine is the same except it is 128mb instead of 256. </s>
<s> I no this most likely isn't possible but just wanted to make sure. </s>
<s> Also, would it be possible with a better video card? </s>
<s> It's possible with your existing card provided you have a VGA adapter for your DVI port. </s>
<s> Conect the CRT to the VGA 15 pin D-sub, use the analog adapter (fits on the DVI port and makes it a VGA 15 pin like the other one) connect the LCD, and configure them using the Nvidia drivers. </s>
<s> *Note* you may want to update the Nvidia drivers for your card from the Nvidia website. </s>
<s> Once you've accomplished this, if you have trouble configuring the driver settings, post back here and I'll try to help you out. </s>
<s> Ok, I just checked on the net and I am 90% sure I can use a CRT with an LCD togther in Dual Monitor setup. </s>
<s> And, i checked the box for the video card and I am 99% sure I can support dual monitor. </s>
<s> My question is now, If I am wrong about these 2 statements, let me know. </s>
<s> My main question is tho, how would I use dual monitor. </s>
<s> Like, would it play the game for example on both monitors, or could I use one monitor for the game and another for another program? </s>
<s> Lastly, ius it easy to setup up dual monitor? </s>
<s> Was both analog, then a got a gard with both analog and DVI out and am running the LCD in Gigital mode. </s>
<s> Paid a big $40.00 for the video card. </s>
<s> LOL </s>
<s> ok, so, my question is: if I go to play Worldo f Warcraft or another game, will it play on one monitor and i can do whatever with the other one? </s>
<s> You can move between the screens if you can run the game in a window. </s>
<s> Some games like WOW allow you to do that. </s>
<s> You just have to select that in the games video options. </s>
<s> For the games that run in a window it's great so that you can IM or run other apps at the same time as playing. </s>
<s> After you go with Dual monitors you'll never want to go single again, it makes so many things so much easier. </s>
<s> Also, I use a CRT and LCD combination. </s>
<s> My Desk </s>
<s> as long as I play the game in a window, I can do 2 things at once. </s>
<s> What if I didn't, would it be split across the 2 screens? </s>
<s> Also, what about regular programs. </s>
<s> Like, say I was using Mozilla and iTunes at the same time. </s>
<s> Could I make it so one monitor has iTunes on it and one has Mozilla. </s>
<s> Also, whatever I did on one monitor, would it happen on the other? </s>
<s> Like, if I am on Mozilla on the CRT, and I moved my cursor to say close the window, would it be moved on the other one as well? </s>
<s> If not, how would I switch between monitors? </s>
<s> Sorry about all the questions, I am just very new on this whole thing. </s>
<s> it really depends on how you configure your monitors, if you set-it up to span two monitors, you actually have one large desktop. </s>
<s> if setup as clone, you'll have two monitors showing the same desktop. </s>
<s> anything you do on the primary monitor would only be ''cloned'' by the secondary a whole new world of computing will open up for you when you go dual-monitor. </s>
<s> and don't worry about making any mistakes, nothing you can do on screen can damage your monitors. </s>
<s> its pretty easy enough to understand when its already infront of you. </s>
<s> try it then tell us how it went. </s>
<s> life is good. </s>
<s> After you install the second monitor and reboot, it will be running in clone mode (identical display) by default. </s>
<s> Right-click on the desktop and select properties. </s>
<s> Select settings. </s>
<s> You should see two monitors (1 and 2). </s>
<s> Below the monitors should be two check boxes (probably greyed out). </s>
<s> If you see two monitors, click on &quot;2.&quot; The two checkboxes should now be available. </s>
<s> Select the second box (Extend my Windows...). </s>
<s> Full-screen applications like WoW will run on one monitor only, but will change the resolution of both monitors. </s>
<s> Maximized apps, like Mozilla will maximize in one screen only, but can be dragged to whatever screen you want. </s>
<s> You can also resize them manually to both screens at the same time. </s>
<s> (Be aware that, although you can have different resolutions on each monitor, I don't recommend it. </s>
<s> It makes screen swapping much harder to get used to.) </s>
<s> With two monitors, you will be able to have, say, your word processor and web browser up at the same time. </s>
<s> Moving between them is easy; just move your mouse to the monitor of your choice. </s>
<s> It's like an extension of your desktop. </s>
<s> Gwee </s>
<s> Inital set-up can be a little intimidating, Gweezel gives a good explaintion on setting up your monitors. </s>
<s> Some one else posted that after using dual monitors you will never go back to one. </s>
<s> To this I will agree. </s>
<s> Set it up and enjoy.... Bill </s>
<s> But how do u guys play games with an LCD and CRT on split screen...doesn't the big gap in between annoy u? </s>
<s> Or do u just play it on 1 screen? </s>
<s> Purpose of dual or quad monitors is to allow multi-applications to be open and seen at the same time. </s>
<s> Your choice on laying out which applications will open on which monitor. </s>
<s> Game on one, IM /e-mail on the other. </s>
<s> In my case left monitor -&gt; Thunderbird/MSN & Yahoo messenger center -&gt; primary tasks right -&gt; Files and using other applicatiions for Internet reference, comparision, creating documents. </s>
<s> 4th monitor is for show and tell hanging on wall across from desk. </s>
<s> Helpfull? </s>
