1.1.3	I bought a CoolerMaster case and there doesn't appear to be an internal speaker to count the &quot;beeps&quot;.	St

1.1.8	I'm hoping someone can help me out.	St
1.1.9	I'm stuck.	St

1.2.1	Got a video card?	St
1.3.1	Yeah.	St
1.3.2	Sorry.	St
1.3.3	I realized I left it out when I submitted it.	St
1.3.4	I have an EVGA 640-P2-N821-AR GeForce 8800GTS 640MB GDDR3 PCI Express x16 HDCP Video Card.	St
1.4.1	Why?	St
1.4.2	I've run into boards that need a BIOS update but you can only do that if you install the CPU that the BIOS supports.	St
1.4.3	So we install a supported CPU, update the BIOS then we can install the CPU we really wanted to use.	St
1.4.4	Don't ask me why the board comes with an outdated BIOS... Bob	Sug
1.5.1	So are you saying I need to install a Core 2 Duo, update the bios to accept a Core 2 Quad, and then my system should work?	St
1.5.2	Thanks for your time.	Polite

1.7.1	Makes sense.	St
