512k is too little if you like speedy drives.
get the 2mb cache drive.
i don't have a problem with multiple dvd+/-rw drives.
you just tell your burning software which drive to use when you go to burn discs--very easy.
i think it is wise to purchase a second dvd burner instead of a read-only drive since your old drive will fail at some point (as all drives do), and the dual layer dvd burners are so inexpensive these days.
nevertheless, the bottom line is always your budget.
