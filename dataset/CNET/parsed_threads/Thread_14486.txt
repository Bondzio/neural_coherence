<s> Hey guys, I'm looking into possibly upgrading a few components of my PC, but I'm a bit out of the loop regarding current compatibilities between some of my hardware/software. </s>
<s> I really need to upgrade my RAM, but its the area giving me the most trouble. </s>
<s> I'm currently running a eVGA, nForce 680i SLI 775 T1, LGA775, nForce 680i SLI, 1333MHz FSB, DDR2-1200 8GB /4, PCIe x16 SLI /2, SATA 3Gb/s RAID 0+1 /6, HDA, GbLAN /2, FW, ATX motherboard, with Windows XP Home, and I'm unsure as to what the best RAM choice would be that is compatible with this. </s>
<s> I know I have a 4G limit at DDR2-1200 speed, but if anyone had some suggestions please let me know. </s>
<s> I'm also running a GeForce 8800 GTS 320 MB RAM, that I am thinking about upgrading or maybe running two with SLI, what do you guys think would be the better option? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot everyone. </s>
<s> or is that your MB's capacity? </s>
<s> If you're running XP Home, your limit will be around 3.5 GB and any more will either be ignored or will cause trouble. </s>
<s> What I'd do is head to Crucial memory and input your motherboard make &amp; model number. </s>
<s> It's doubtful you'll notice any improvement above 2 GB but don't get more than 4 GB. </s>
<s> The 8800's were nice in their day. </s>
<s> Time to look at &quot;the list.&quot; Link -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card-gaming-performance,3042.html </s>
<s> The motherboard can support 8 Gigs, but since I'm running Windows XP Home 32 bit it maxes at 4 GB. </s>
<s> I just don't know what kind of DDR2-1200 ram to get. </s>
<s> Getting any so-called hot ram isn't really going to help even if you're a gamer. </s>
<s> It will still operate at 1200 mode. </s>
<s> Though, the heat tolerate or those offered with &quot;heatsinks, etc.&quot; will be better to get, if gaming or demanding situations isn't your bag then typical high grade ram will suffice. </s>
<s> If that's the reason for your query, then look for the various ram offering that suggest they're capable. </s>
<s> Most ram vendors, offer some tier-level of ram tolerances, etc., suggesting they do better than the entry level as in &quot;cheaper&quot; or bargain type. </s>
<s> Common sense will dictate to you what to get or desire. </s>
<s> If getting a whole kit or re-install of ram, then be sure they match or come similar to what you have for best install. </s>
<s> If you like to consider upgrading the OS to win7 at 64-bit, you'll may like the added ram and new win7 as it seems your present PC supports it. </s>
<s> Though, you can use the Win7 adviser from MS to test that, just a thought. </s>
<s> Alas, as a parting thought as well, have you checked the bios updates. </s>
<s> it *may* provide for better ram handling abilities if so directed. </s>
<s> Not increase ram but how it handles ram or your mtrbd. </s>
<s> per se. </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt; tada -----Willy &lt;/div&gt; </s>
