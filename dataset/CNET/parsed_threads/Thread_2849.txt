<s> Hello, I have an older Intel D845PEBT2 motherboard and it has both the Primary and Secondary IDE channels, but it also has Primary and Secondary channels for onboard RAID. </s>
<s> I am not interested in setting up a RAID config, but I want to know if I can just add more drives and run them each independantly. </s>
<s> I tried hooking up a 3rd drive but it does not show up under My Computer in Windows XP. </s>
<s> I have enabled the RAID in the BIOS (I enabled it only, not set up a config) but Windows still will not show the icon for the drive. </s>
<s> I know the drive and the cable are good. </s>
<s> Is this possible on my motherboard? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Intel doesn't seem to have a specific answer to my question about just adding additional drives. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>

<s> What is the SATA HD model number? </s>
<s> * * * * * Don't set up a RAID config. </s>
<s> Download the &quot;Integrated Serial ATA Driver&quot; from R. Proffit's link. </s>
<s> While you're at it, get the PDF manual for that board, as well. </s>
<s> If the SATA HD is not SATA150, then you may need to jumper it as such (depends on the model). </s>
<s> Attach SATA HD to primary SATA connector. </s>
<s> Check to see if the SATA HD shows in system BIOS. </s>
<s> Does it? </s>
<s> Make sure the HD with XP is still the primary boot drive and boot into XP. </s>
<s> Install SATA Driver from XP. </s>
<s> Partition and format the new SATA HD in Disk Management (use NTFS). </s>
<s> Note that it is common for a new HD not to show in My Computer until you initialize it in Disk Management. </s>
<s> If the HD is larger than 137GB, then you may need to update the motherboard BIOS and make sure that XP is at least SP1 (just update to SP2). </s>
