I have two computers,1 is a compaq presario using XP home edition the other is a E machine using Home XP edition.
I used the wizzard to set up a network and can get connectivity but the slave wants to use the modem to dial up instead of seeing the network?
I get the icon network connected.
Do i need to disable the modem on the slave?
what am i doing wrong here?
Jerry thanks
