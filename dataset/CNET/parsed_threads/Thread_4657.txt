<s> Rahul Get into your router and check to see if you had set a filter (IP or MAC), as you may of locked yourself out. </s>
<s> You could of mis-typed one of the characters. </s>
<s> Also, check your ethernet cable is plugged in correctly, phone line (dsl) is plugged in, or cable is securely attached. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> reach the Internet when connected directly to the modem? </s>
<s> Some with DSL have to add the proper user name and password as well as choosing PPPoE as the Internet type, in the routers setup page. </s>
