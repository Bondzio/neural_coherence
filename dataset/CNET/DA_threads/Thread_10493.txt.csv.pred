1.1.1	I wanted to add another DDR stick on my sister 's comp ; so at first I looked for free slots ; there are 3 slots-2 of them are in use.So I wanted to check if that free slot is actually working ; I moved a stick from those already installed into the free slot , then when i tryed to power it up i did n't work ( the monitor stays black-not even the & quot ; no signal & quot ; message ) .I moved the stick back on , still not working.What did I do wrong ? What could possibily happened ? I installed rams before , i worked all just fine.Is it true that there is a risk of electrostatic charge damage ?	Ques

1.2.1	I beleive that in most motherboards you have to fill specific slots first before moving on to the next empty slot for example , lets say you have 3 slots ( you do ) if it only has one stick you will have to choose correctly what slot or you get that screen.If there are two sticks you will need to buy another stick to test it , also make sure its the right kind of memory that you buy and watch out for static !
