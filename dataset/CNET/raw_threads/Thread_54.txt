However I intend to use a bit more stuff in it (Nvidia AGP, Sound Blaster card, Combo CD/DVD/RW) and was wondering if anyone was aware of a 3rd party replacement that fits the slightly non standard form factor Dell uses. Dell's has the power plug and a 110/220 slider directly below it, but no on/off switch. The mounting holes seem to match a standard ATX supply. Looking from the back, the fans on the right and the power cord connector is upper left. Any thoughts, thanks, John

If you decide to replace your Dell PS, I think PC Power and Cooling makes Dell replacement power supplies. Their stuff is excellent I have used it before with excellent results. I have total faith in that company and no I do not work for them. They are in Calif. and I am near Cleveland, Ohio. Their power supplies are also very quiet. Remember to consider getting a larger PS than the one you are replacing, for future expansion. My Dell Dimension 8100 has a 330watt PS. I prefer not to go lower than that size PS. bob t

Dell uses an ATX connector but the wires may not be connected the same way they are on a standard ATX PS. If you put a standard ATX PS in a Dell that uses the &quot;Dell&quot; wireing the MB and the new PS will fry. John
