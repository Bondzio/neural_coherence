<s> Hi, I haven't used my Presario in about 7 months now. </s>
<s> After trying to play Terminator 3 the computer would lock up and I would get graphic errors. </s>
<s> So I uninstalled Terminator. </s>
<s> Then my screen started to show lines through it and it would lock up. </s>
<s> Finally, my monitor could no longer read my computer. </s>
<s> My computer remained on but nothing would show on the monitor. </s>
<s> At first I thought it was my ATI Radeon video card. </s>
<s> So I removed it and uninstalled the drivers. </s>
<s> That didn't work. </s>
<s> I could turn on my computer but then the screen would freeze, show lines through the screen and then my monitor couldn't read my computer. </s>
<s> I then tried a different monitor. </s>
<s> It didn't make a difference. </s>
<s> So I did a quick restore on my computer. </s>
<s> It worked for about 20 minutes and then it happened again. </s>
<s> I think the cooling fans may be bad. </s>
<s> They make a strained noise, but they still blow air. </s>
<s> I just can't figure it out. </s>
<s> Today I restored it to the last known working configuration. </s>
<s> It worked for an hour. </s>
<s> Please help!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Leave the cover off and see if it makes a difference. </s>
<s> If so, replace the failing fans. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I was thinking it could be the power supply or the fans. </s>
<s> I will try that. </s>
