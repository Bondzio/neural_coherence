<s> I'm looking for a NAS Server (with 2 SATA bays or more) that, besides its ethernet connection, may also connect to the PC via USB (as a mass storage device). </s>
<s> Most NAS servers have usb connection but only to add more devices to its storage capacity. </s>
<s> Why you may ask... </s>
<s> I want to use it as a NAS server, connected to my house network, but also directly to my LED TV (which has media player software and a USB port for mass storage devices such as pen drives or ext.drives and, hopefully, this NAS server). </s>
<s> Can you help me? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/Media-Network-Attached-Storage-mv2120/dp/B0015313O8 And since it has gigabit networking that sidesteps why most of us want to connect it with USB to our PCs. </s>

<s> But.. </s>
<s> I don't want to connect it to the PC via USB.. (the thread title has &quot;PC&quot; so that the readers understand the kind of connection I want, to use the NAS as a mass storage device) I want to connect it to the TV directly via USB.. That's the reason I posted the question.. </s>
<s> I can' t find one that has that USB connectivity </s>
<s> These new TVs with USB connections have OTHER issues. </s>
<s> Since the TV determines the format of the drive and more than why not a simple USB Drive and be done with it? </s>
<s> You may want to forget USB and use the network feature if your TV supports it. </s>
<s> Again this area is full of broken promises. </s>
<s> All you need to do is read the Samsung and other forums to discover the pitfalls and more. </s>
<s> Next time, supply the links to the HDTV so others can see what other solutions are out there. </s>
<s> My advice? </s>
<s> Go get a common USB hard drive for under 99 bucks and we are done. </s>

<s> My TV is a Samsung LED 40B7000 that plays (via USB) every format I use from avi to mkv, from SD to 1080p. </s>
<s> Everything is perfect via USB... </s>
<s> It also plays those same formats via ethernet (DLNA) but with minor glitches (depending on the network load) and 2 huge limitations on the media player itself: 1) the TV doesn't allow to use a folder-based-view, it ignores the folder structure and presents every file as if they were all in the root dir. </s>
<s> ...bye bye &quot;tvshows/lost/season6/hd/*&quot; 2) the TV doesn't allow to FF/RW or even Pause in some cases which is a huge pain... That's why I started looking for a NAS with both connections.. for all the benefits of a NAS but also to use it as a USB device for the limited-network-capability-TV... </s>
<s> http://www.boxee.tv/box I hear what you are saying but have yet to find such a thing. </s>
<s> storage doesn't exist for the reason that conflicts will occur when more than one device attempts to write at the same time. </s>
<s> Doesn't matter that your TV is a reader and not a writer, the storage is designed to avoid simultaneous dual connections. </s>
<s> You'll have to research this more on your own time. </s>
<s> Nothing neat exists in this space. </s>
<s> The closest device you will find was the Buffalo Drivestation Flexnet. </s>
<s> Why past tense? </s>
<s> It's being phased out but still available in some stores. </s>
<s> Grab one quick if you deems it meets your needs. </s>
<s> Otherwise, buy or construct a PC DLNA server and you'll have all types of interfaces to choose from. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Hi nunocruz79, were you able to find a NAS that could do this (and dealt with the problems others have mentioned)? </s>
<s> Or come up with another idea for how to get your TV's USB port to be able to access files on your network somehow? </s>
<s> I am facing the same issue with my TV - it only has the USB port (and expects a USB mass storage device). </s>
<s> And it's the best media browsing/playing device I've seen. </s>
<s> So it is annoying to think I need to use another (sub-standard) media box because I want ethernet access. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Hi Barney_R! </s>
<s> I couldn't find a solution.. there was only a Lacie NAS that had a specific partition for direct USB access and other (partition) for the NAS storage itself. </s>
<s> In the end I decided to put my NAS (Iomega iX2-200) somewhere else in the house, connect it to the LAN and access it via ethernet using a very affordable WD Live TV (media player, no storage, HDMI connection to TV), which plays every video/audio format I need, adds subtitle on the go, reads DTS sound (my LED doesn't) and has no problem with 1080p video on a 10/100 LAN or a 802.11n WLAN. </s>
<s> Very nice PS3-style base interface too (and it's even customizable). </s>
<s> It's an additional cost I know.. </s>
<s> I simply gave up on what I was searching for but I'm very happy with the player I bought. </s>
<s> Today I wouldn't buy a Samsung xxB7000.. </s>
<s> I'd go with the &quot;xxB6000 + WD TV Live&quot; combo.. (If Samsung solves the never-ending-DLNA-issues i'll put the WDplayer in another TV/room and use the LED to browse and play my files over the LAN.) </s>
<s> Thanks for everything. </s>
