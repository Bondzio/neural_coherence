1.2.2	The reason I personally partition is to keep various forms of data separated for ease of backing up ... .. MP3 and movie files on one , documents and downloads on another , my website and all data and graphics that goes with it on another , jpg/bmp/gif and camera pics on another ... .. you get the idea ... .plan it out ahead of time so you are giving the appropriate amount of space to each partition otherwise you end up with too little on one and too much on another .
