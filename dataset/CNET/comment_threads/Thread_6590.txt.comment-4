I am doing exactly what you are trying to do.
Transfer old LPs to my hard-drive and to CDs (I assume).
I guess ignorance is bliss, because I installed RealPlayer (after many annoying pop-ups, etc.)
and found that for $19.95 I could have (among other things) the option of recording from &quot;line-in&quot; or &quot;mic&quot; jacks on my sound card.
All I did then was run a cable from the &quot;phones&quot; jack on my old turntable to the &quot;line-in&quot; jack on my sound card.
After opening RealPlayer, I chose &quot;record from line-in or mic&quot; and followed the step-by-step procedure which was kind of intuitive.
With a few trial & error guesses, you will be off and running!
I have not found this option with Windows Media Player, and queries to MS produced no satisfactory replys except for computer generated &quot;FAQ&quot; answers.
If they can't be bothered, neither can I.
