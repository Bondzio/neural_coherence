One flea isn't going to do anything unless of course you're veryyyyy unlucky, so don't sweat it.
Why, do I know this, my cat is kicked out until winter sets in.
No inside cat for her.
Yeah, I know about fleas and nope, I just pick them out and drop them into a solution of Ka-Boom cleaner and water into a jar.
That way, I know how bad it gets, I count them.
I bomb(x-times) every year and yes the cat gets flea medicine but that works only if the cat doesn't go outside, yeah right, she flys out the door.
Now roaches do cause problems plus ants, so beware of larger insects.
Place screens on windows.
