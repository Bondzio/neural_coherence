1.1.1	I have a Compaq Presario 6000.	St
1.1.2	The DHCP server is not getting a valid IP address.	St
1.1.3	How do I troubleshoot?	St
1.2.1	That's OK.	St
1.2.2	The DHCP server (your modem or router) is GIVING the IP-address (when being asked by the client PC), not GETTING it.	St
1.2.3	But something isn't OK indeed if it doesn't work.	St
1.2.4	For example: - the client isn't asking, because it isn't configured to ask - the wireless password is wrong (resulting in limited or no connectivity) - the wrong encryption method is used - an error in your IP-stack of programs - the modem/router is defective or configured wrongly - the ethernet card is defective or the driver corrupted Time for more details and experiments.	St
1.2.5	In http://pcworld.about.net/news/Jul262002id103355.htm I read a positive story on the Compaq Presario 6000.	St
1.2.6	May I hope you have installed more than 256 MB of memory in the nearly 10 years since it came out?	St
1.2.7	And how about a new PC or a clean reinstall of Windows XP?	St
1.2.8	That should work, unless it's an issue with the modem/router.	St
1.2.9	The easy way to test that is to find a friend or family member or neighbour with a laptop and see if that can connect.	St

1.3.1	I will try your suggestions!	Sug
