for a desktop user the math of mtbf, which i am sure thousands of scientists and engineers have performed, can be rendered practically irrelevant by using ssds only for the os and apps.
keep your data on a comparatively durable hdd and back it up multiple times of course as you know.
the speed gain, noiselessness, low power, low heat and 3-yr warranty of ssd make it a no-brainer choice as system disk for w7(trim) desktops (not servers and not laptops unless backed up after every session).
pro photogs and worry wart ams should replace their flash well sooner than specified lifetimes or warrantees.
still no guarantee of failure free operation but buys a teeny bit extra peace of mind.
