1.1.1	Hello .	St
1.1.2	I have an nvidia GeForce 7600GS video card connected via PCIe .	St
1.1.3	I am running a 32 bit Vista Home Premium OS .	St
1.1.4	The card is a PNY Manufactured card .	St
1.1.5	Anyways , when playing games such as Call of Duty 4 , the card overheats after a few hours .	St
1.1.6	I can tell when colored artifacts appear on the screen and the PC crashes .	St
1.1.7	I installed the nvidia nTune utility in hopes of increasing the fan speed to prevent the overheating .	St
1.1.8	The nTune utility can not do this .	St
1.1.9	I installed 3 different versions of RivaTuner and there is no Fan tab when I go to change the settings .	St
1.1.10	I read someone that disabling driver signing can fix this but that is only for 64 bit Vista and I am running 32 bit Vista .	St
1.1.11	I also installed ATITool and it can not change the fan setting since it thinks the card isnt in use by the OS .	St
1.1.12	I am at a loss .	St
1.1.13	I have already bought a new 450W $ 100 power supply because PNY said it was a power issue .	St
1.1.14	I am experienced with PCs and have a good knowledge about all this but I cant seem to get ANY tool to change the fan setting .	St
1.1.15	Im not the only one with this issue but really need a viable solution .	St
1.1.16	I do know for a fact that the card itself supports fan speed adjustments .	St
1.1.17	Any help is appreciated .	Polite
1.1.18	Thanks .	Polite

1.3.2	I have started thinking about getting a new card .	St
1.3.3	The only reason I didnt already was because I have a 3 year warranty with PNY .	St
1.3.4	Out of those two you showed , I would perfer the one with the heatsink and fan ( 8800GS ) just to prevent future overheating .	St
1.3.5	I havent heard nice things about the & quot ; Silent & quot ; cards .	St
