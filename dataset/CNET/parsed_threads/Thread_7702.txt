<s> I am looking for information on what I need to do. </s>
<s> I have a system running win98se, added a hard drive with winme on it. </s>
<s> What I would like to be able to do is boot from the second hard drive running winme which I believe is set as a slave. </s>
<s> Any will would be nice. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Windows doesn't like being moved around like that. </s>
<s> Save yourself a lot of time and kiss what may be worst Windows version ever goodbye. </s>
<s> I'm not the only one that thinks that. </s>
<s> See http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Worst+Windows+Version%22 You'll see Windows ME repeated far too often. </s>
<s> For another winner, look what people wrote about &quot;Microsoft BOB&quot;. </s>
<s> Bob (no relationship to above product.) </s>
<s> Well maybe if I tell you why I want to do this it might help. </s>
<s> Win98 drive has problems and I do not have any of the software because I bought it second had. </s>
<s> WinME ran fine and I have all of the software from when I purchased it. </s>
<s> The WinME does not have any burners but the Win98 does. </s>
<s> So I thought if I took the WinME drive and put it in the tower of the Win98 I could boot from the WinME and use the Win98 as extra storage. </s>
<s> But I do not kown how to get it to boot from the d (WinME) instead of the c (Win98). </s>
<s> I think you might undersand now why I am trying to do this. </s>
<s> Move it to the primary and it will boot. </s>
<s> Have the Windows ME CD handy so it can fix itself. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Will I need to change the plasic piece that makes them a master and a slave? </s>
<s> Once this is done should I remove the os from the Win98 so it can be used for storage only? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The master and slave position is dictated by where we plug in the drive. </s>
<s> Very old (10 years?) </s>
<s> we configured hard disks on 40 conductor cables with the jumpers. </s>
<s> Follow the method for what hardware you have. </s>

<s> I have windows 98 se, i happen to love it. </s>
<s> My second tower is windows me, i want to use me for storage. </s>
<s> I don't know how to go about connecting the two towers or how to make one primary and other secondary or how to change the slave pins. </s>
<s> If anyone could take the time to explain I would so much appreciate it. </s>
<s> than you </s>
