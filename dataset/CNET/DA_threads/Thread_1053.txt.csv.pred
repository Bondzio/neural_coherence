1.1.1	Ok , first the desktop ...	St
1.1.2	I 'm trying to figure out how to get a decent computer for a low price - like $ 400 to $ 700 or so .	St
1.1.3	( including a monitor / LCD especially if the price is toward the high end ) What I will be using it for is net surfing , graphics editing ( including pics captured by my digital camera ) , audio recording and editing ( at least stereo , maybe sometimes 4 or more simultaneous channels ) ( from cassette , CD , 33rpm , reel-to-reel , etc ) , video capture ( from VHS and other formats ) and editing , games ( Half-Life , maybe Half-Life 2 when it 's under $ 20 ( or when Team Fortress 2 comes out and is down to $ 20-30 ) , etc ) ...	St
1.1.4	I will want to run Windows XP on it , and be able to simultaneously dual boot Linux or a similar OS .	St
1.1.5	I already have an 80GB hard drive and a 250GB hard drive in my dad 's computer .	St
1.1.6	Some specs I am thinking I might need/want : 1.4 to 2GHz CPU ( I 'm flexible on this - if I do n't need something that fast I 'm willing to go as low as 1 to 1.2GHz ) a quiet power-supply RAM - at LEAST 1GB ! ! !	St
1.1.7	2 or 4GB or even 8GB would be better .	St
1.1.8	hard drive - I already have one , but an extra one equal to the total capacity of what I currently have ( this could be used for backups as it would take more dual-layer DVD 's than I want to use , and my & quot ; backups & quot ; consist of a complete bit-for-bit mirror of the hard drive .	St
1.1.9	dual-layer multiformat 8X or faster DVD burner high-end sound card ( for example Creative Audigy Platinum with front / external controls and plugins , or something else that 's recommended , preferably with at least 4 or 8 channel ( or more ) simultaneous input capability .	St
1.1.10	a good video card ( with capture ( or a separate capture card ) The monitor/LCD depends on where I put my computer .	St
1.1.11	If I integrate it into my full-sized upright piano , I could put a 15 & quot ; LCD monitor in there .	St
1.1.12	I would want to be able to run AT LEAST 1280x960 , preferablly 1408x1056 or 1600x1200 or higher .	St
1.1.13	If I put the computer somewhere else ( although I may have trouble finding a place for it ) I would want a monitor capable of at least 2048x1536 @ 80 Hz , preferably as high as 2560x1920 @ 75 Hz .	St
1.1.14	a good high-speed network card multimedia/internet keyboard and multi-button optical wheel mouse ( wireless might be nice , name-brand is a huge plus ) front USB 2.0 , sound , etc .	St
1.1.15	ports Ok , now for the notebook : This one is more severely budget limited , so my specs wo n't be as demanding ... ( max of $ 350 , preferably $ 250 or lower ) This one I mainly would be using for transfering stuff from my mp3 player/recorder and digital camera , and maybe occasionally other things CPU speed probably up to 1GHz RAM - 256MB would probably be OK OS - Windows 2000 ( although XP would be nice ) sound - decent - does n't need to be professional quality , but not a cheapie solution display - at least 1280x960 , preferably 1600x1200 or higher resolution hard drive - either 20GB ( if I also get a USB 2.0 external hard drive enclosure which would be included in my budget ) or 40GB to 80GB if I do n't get the external enclosure USB 2.0 ports ( 1.1 is too slow ) battery holds at least a 3 to 4 hour charge ( 2.5 under heavy use ) Any other suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.16	And where should I look for something ?	Ques
1.1.17	I realize ebay is probably the most likely if not the only option for the notebook ( in which case I would insist on one with a good/new battery ) but what should I look for ?	Ques
1.1.18	I could wait several months to get a computer and/or notebook , but I do n't want to be rushed into a buying decision when the time comes .	Sug
1.2.1	That 's one fine computer .	St
1.2.2	Good luck finding one .	Polite
1.3.1	If that 's US Dollars ( USD ) then we 'll all want to know where these machines are , at that price .	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
