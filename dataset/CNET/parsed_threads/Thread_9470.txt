<s> Hello, everybody I bought a used D-link DI-514 wireless router on eBay a couple days ago. </s>
<s> Here's the problem. </s>
<s> When I plug the power supply in the light indicator for power lights up and the one for WiFi starts to blink. </s>
<s> However, when I connect my modem to it nothing happens and the light remains off. </s>
<s> The same happens when I try to connect my computer to the router. </s>
<s> Moreover, I don't see the router in the wireless networks list. </s>
<s> I'm sure I'm doing everything according to the manual and plugging all the cords right. </s>
<s> I already tried to reset the router a dozen times. </s>
<s> Do you think something can be done or is it a hopeless case and the router is simply dead? </s>
<s> That's how you'd set it up. </s>
<s> If it's working it should be able to give you an IP address and you'd see the router as a gateway when you run &quot;ipconfig&quot;. </s>
<s> Knowing that gateway, you'd use a browser to enter the web interface and configure the router. </s>
<s> It's possible that you might need to reset it to defaults first. </s>
<s> You'd need to find a manual to let you know how to do that. </s>
<s> If you don't have one, check D-link's support site. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> You MUST enter the router setup to test it. </s>
<s> This must be in the wired mode. </s>
<s> http://192.168.0.1/ You need to turn the wireless option on, as in turning on the transmitter. </s>
<s> You need to set the router for discovery, as in turn on SSID. </s>
<s> This enables the router to broadcast a signal your PC can find. </s>
