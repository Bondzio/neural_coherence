when OC'ing you'll need to tweak your FSB and ram speed seperately.
a 400mhz fsb is the simplest OC for that processor.
it will raise the CPU from 2.66ghz to 3.2ghz and you'll still be able to run your ram at ddr2-800.
any good motherboard will be to do this with a good cooler(like the noctua) and all that might be necessary is a gentle vcore push.
if you want to go higher, you should probably opt for ddr2-1066 and be prepared for a lot more tweaking.
with a 420mhz FSB you could run at ddr2-840 or ddr2-1050 depending on the ratio you choose.
heat will also become more of an issue over 400mhz FSB.
