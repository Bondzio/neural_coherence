<s> i just got my new XION Solaris case from newegg.com It has 2 front audio and 2 front usb ports. </s>
<s> Using both the motherboard and case manuals i connected the cables for the USB to my motherboard and doublechecked that the pins were correct, but the ports are not working. </s>
<s> I did not connect the audio ports and left the pins jumped. </s>
<s> I am running Win XP SP2; this is my first case with front USB. </s>
<s> If there are other USB ports, are they active? </s>
<s> If not or only the frt. </s>
<s> USB ports make sure under the bios section, they are enabled. </s>
<s> Of course recheck the wiring, it can be confusing at times for anyone. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> i've had my PSU (350W) for a while and done some upgrades to my pc since having it. </s>
<s> I wonder if there isn't enough power to run the front ports? </s>
<s> could anyone tell me how to test my PSU? </s>
<s> The wiring and bios area? </s>
<s> There is no real test other than a voltmeter and that only does voltages. </s>
<s> if everything else works, you should have enough for the USB. </s>
<s> USB doesn't need that much to run. </s>
<s> Since, this is a new build, you have to recheck before you start elsewhere. </s>
<s> Don't take things for granted. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
