I have recently aquired a MicronPC PIII MB (MBD00-1136).
The mnual at BuyMPC's website does not have the front panel lights/switch positions listed.
I get the MB to power on, but when I try to install any Windows(98,ME or XP), it will restart during install, usually at the same place.
This is not an overheating problem, as I can let the MB run diags for hours with no problems.
I believe the problem to be the FP switch connections on the MB.
Does anyone know the proper switch positions for this MB or where I can find a more complete manual for it.
All help is greatly appreciated.
