<s> Im in the market for a new desktop after using my last PC for over 5 years. </s>
<s> When shopping today I noticed a triple-core processor and was curious because I've never seen anything but duals and quads. </s>
<s> Is there a reason why they are not as popular? </s>
<s> Or are they just an upgrade from a dual, but a slight step down from a quad? </s>
<s> Is there any known issues I should be aware of? </s>
<s> The desktop I was planning on getting is an HP a6702f, which is an AMD 8550 Triple Core @ 2.2ghz, 4g ram. </s>
<s> Honestly, the most graphically intensive thing I'll be running in the foreseeable future is warcraft, Im assuming that this will be more than enough to cover what I want it to do, I was just wondering if theres any issues I Should be aware of before buyng a X3 processor. </s>
<s> tri cores are just another computing option. </s>
<s> amd 'created' them to compete with intel's core2duo. </s>
<s> amd's cpus couldn't match the performance of core2duo at the same clock frequency, so they offer an extra cpu core to offset the slower performance. </s>
<s> they're a good cpu and certainly fast enough for most users. </s>
<s> the a6702f you mention uses integrated graphics. </s>
<s> as long as you can be satisfied playing WoW at medium settings or at a low resolution (1024x768) you should be ok. if you want to run at the full resolution of a widescreen lcd, consider adding a radeon hd 4670 (about $80 from buy.com). </s>
<s> Actually I beleive the video card is a Nvidia 9100, I honestly have no idea how good that is compared to everything else that is avaliable. </s>
<s> I was using WoW as a bench mark that would be the most intensive thing I would be running graphically, atleast for the time being. </s>
<s> If the processors are reliable, and worth the money, then i have no problem buying that system, so much as the video card can preform for what i want. </s>
<s> After looking at the website, I belive it is this system. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> it can use shared memory and only peforms like integrated graphics. </s>
<s> here's your pc. </s>
<s> the video ports are on the main i/o panel and no slots are occupied. </s>
<s> HP Pavilion A6720F </s>
<s> So your saying its just a intergrated graphics card, and would not preform as well as a dedicated card? </s>
<s> any geforce below a 8500/9500 or radeon 3600/4600 will only give very low performance in games. </s>
<s> is there any where I could see a list of video cards so i can tell what is good vs. bad? </s>
<s> or recommend a few that could run at medium to high settings? </s>
<s> I'm just not in the loop on video cards being produced now, the last card I bought was a ATI 9250, which was aces when I bought it. </s>
<s> $500 GTX295 $400 HD4870X2 $300 GTX285 $200 HD4870 $175 HD4870(yes they are that cheap now a days $150 HD4850 $125 don't buy any card in this range, the extra $25 for a 4850 is worth it $100 HD4830 $75 HD4670 $50 9400GT or HD4550 don't buy anything lower end for gaming, please </s>
<s> amd dropped the official price of the hd 4870 512mb to $150 and the hd 4850 will be $130. </s>
<s> might take a few days for the new pricing to go in effect and there'll likely be a rebate involved. </s>
