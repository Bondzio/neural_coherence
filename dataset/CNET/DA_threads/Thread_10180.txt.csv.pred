1.1.1	An IDE hard drive marked as ATA and one marked as Ultra ATA ?	Ques
1.1.2	My older 60 Gig HD will work in my external USB-2 case but my new 160 & quot ; Ultra & quot ; will not .	St
1.1.3	It works perfectly in my desktop as a slave , but it will not work in my external case .	St
1.1.4	Windows ( XP Pro ) does not notice the USB device .	St
1.1.5	But if I put the older 60 Gig drive into the case , XP sees it perfectly .	St
1.1.6	Just wondering .	St
1.1.7	And yes , the jumpers are correct , master while in the case .	Res
1.2.1	Some really old cases had issues with drives over 127GB ... Bob	St
1.3.1	so on .	St
1.3.2	Here 's what the & quot ; Wisegeek & quot ; had to say about it : http : //www.wisegeek.com/what-is-ultra-ata.htm & quot ; ATA ( Advanced Technology Attachment ) refers to a common standard used to connect hard drives and other storage devices to a motherboard .	St
1.3.3	It is also referred to as IDE ( Integrated Drive Electronics ) , though the terms are not technically interchangeable .	St
1.3.4	Ultra ATA is simply next generation ATA with improved transfer speed and architecture .	St
1.3.5	There are several buzzwords surrounding Ultra ATA that can make it a little confusing for consumers , but each buzzword refers to an aspect of the standard that forms the overall architecture of Ultra ATA .	St
1.3.6	UDMA ( Ultra Direct Memory Access ) : To begin , Ultra ATA is based on a joint venture design between Intel , Quantum and Seagate .	St
1.3.7	It is written around a specification that allows a hard disk or drive to transfer data directly to the computer 's system memory without having to use the CPU to direct this action .	St
1.3.8	This saves processor resources and increases performance .	St
1.3.9	Therefore , Ultra ATA is also called Ultra DMA , or UDMA for short As if all this is n't enough to make the average consumer hire the neighborhood geek to buy a hard drive for them , there are also escalating grades of Ultra ATA defined by transfer speed ceilings .	St
1.3.10	For example , there is Ultra ATA/33 , Ultra ATA/66 Ultra ATA/100 and Ultra ATA/133 .	St
1.3.11	As you may have guessed , ATA/133 is the fastest , with a transfer rate of 133 megabytes per second , roughly comparable to the earliest version of SATA .	St
1.3.12	While SATA drives have long out-paced Ultra ATA drives for performance , the latter is still an excellent economical choice .	St
1.3.13	Aside from their use as system drives , Ultra ATA drives are also popular backup and archive drives .	St
1.3.14	If purchasing an Ultra ATA hard drive or ATAPI device , you will need a UDMA controller to take over the responsibility of directing data flow between system memory and the component device .	St
1.3.15	This controller is built into the motherboard chipset in most cases .	St
1.3.16	For motherboards that are not Ultra ATA compliant , a UDMA controller card can be purchased and added to an open PCI slot on the motherboard .	St
1.3.17	Ultra ATA drives and controllers are available everywhere computer products are sold. & quot ;	St
1.4.1	I actually have two of them and they 're probably 3-4 years old .	St
1.5.1	Which brand model 160GB is it that does n't work ?	Ques
