<s> The HP seems to have a better processor and much larger hard drive. </s>
<s> I plan on playing some games such as CoD4 and using Photoshop CS3. </s>
<s> I would also like to have the option to have the tv tuner thing which the hp has and the dell charges extra for. </s>
<s> Seem like a better buy with the HP but the dell may let me expand more down the road easily. </s>
<s> Any experience or ideas are appreciated? </s>

<s> The HP has a faster and cooler runnign processor, a faster hard drive with more than twice the capacity, a better sound card, built-in HDTV tuner and record, but a weaker video card. </s>
<s> The 8600GT can struggle in games unless you're willing to turn down the resolution and the effects/detail level. </s>
<s> To make the HP a good gamer, you'd need to upgrade to at least a 9600GT and replace its 350W power supply with a 450+W unit. </s>

<s> Which means SLI compatibility. </s>
<s> The PSU has more leeway as well. </s>
<s> It is the better gaming PC, especially if you think a couple of years ahead. </s>
<s> You'll be able to drop a price-dropped faster 1333Mhz FSB chip in there, and also slap in a second 8800GT (or a single power-hungry card) in there to keep your gaming current. </s>
<s> As far as the gaming experience right now is concerned, the Q6600+8800GT combo will also slay a Q9300+8600GT. </s>
