(the files sound fine when played off the c: drive.) anyone have any idea what is causing this? is this a defective drive? I tried xferring files one at a time, no help - fj
8824	1	20921	225587	225584	frankzxcv	4/25/04 9:36 PM	1.08292896E12	my system info	this an 1800 AMD chip system on an MSI mobo running windows 2000. the C: drive is a 30 gb WD drive. the 120 gb e: drive in question is on the same cable as the C:, cable select jumpers, so it's the primary slave. has a soundblaster live card, never had any problem with it before. --fj

See if it shows under Advanced settings that it is using Ultra DMA 5. If you forget to change the BIOS and set it to Auto for a new drive it will work, but it will not work at the optimal speed.
8824	4	20921	226397	225791	frankzxcv	4/26/04 1:44 PM	1.08298704E12	what is PIO mode?	in device manager, under IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers, clicking on properties/ advanced I see the c: drive is in ultra DMA mode BUT for the new troublesome drive, the transfer mode says &quot;DMA if available&quot; but the &quot;current transfer mode&quot; says PIO Mode. -- what the heck is that? ??? thanks for your help! (I think everything was set to auto in the BIOS but I can check again) --fj

Device manager, system, view by resource connection. It could be each disk access is causing an interrupt on the same address as the sound card. Just my thought but I tend to make hard drives masters on each IDE and let the less used devices be secondary.
8824	7	20921	226544	226538	frankzxcv	4/26/04 4:11 PM	1.08299586E12	solved	well I put the drive on the secondary IDE cable and all is fixed. fyi PIO mode is a really slow mode. . . probably caused by faulty cable. time to get to microcenter! - fj
