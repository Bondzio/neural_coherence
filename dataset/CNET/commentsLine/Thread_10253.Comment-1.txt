hi i want to upgrade my pc i know what i need/want my mobo has to have one agp slot for my vid card and i want ddr 2 thats alot to ask for i know but i found a mobo that handles that but every one i talk to says it sucks i have never heard of the bradn but if you dont plan on overclocking it shouldnt matter right.
i mean im gunna get a 3.6 processor 2gb of ddr2 ram so i wont need to over clock any thing.
basicaly all im asken is does the mobo really matter unless u plan to overclock.
if i could find a better mobo i would get it but there is only one iv found that handles what i want heres the mobo i was thinken about getten  ps if any one knows about mobos that handle ddr2 and has one agp slot tell me pls
