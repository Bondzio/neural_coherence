<s> I have the following configuartion: Intel Pentium IV 2.4 GHz (Non-HT) Intel D845GEBV2 Board 512 MB DDR Inno3d GeForce FX 5500 256 MB, VIVO, AGP 8x (supporting 4x) Yesterday i moved my system upstairs and tried to connect it to the TV and it worked. </s>
<s> After about 3-4 hours i experienced some strange hangups (but the card - graphics card) was still working. </s>
<s> I removed the card and the hangups discontinued. </s>
<s> The graphics card to me was okay. </s>
<s> Today, when i tried to install the card again in the AGP slot. </s>
<s> it simply refused to boot up the system. </s>
<s> As soon as i start it, it hangs up, No Display, No moving forward. </s>
<s> No respone whatsoever. </s>
<s> Then, when i removed the card from the slot, the system works fine (&lt;-- i am on the same system atm). </s>
<s> I also noticed one of my DDR was not tight. </s>
<s> But i tightened it, and tried to repeat the process. </s>
<s> No luck! </s>
<s> I also tried to clear CMOS by removing the battery/cell. </s>
<s> and then still NO LUCK! </s>
<s> The card doesnt give any smell. </s>
<s> It is still in good condition. </s>
<s> No burning sings on it. </s>
<s> Except that I can't see whats beneath the heat sink. </s>
<s> It's the 2nd week since i bought this card. </s>
<s> I believe my Graphics card is blown? </s>
<s> Anything to check out? </s>
<s> Your motherboard supports the Intel D845GE Chipset. </s>
<s> Besides your AGP connector you have Integrated (on board) Intel Extreme Graphics controller and 'Integrated retention mechanism'. </s>
<s> It is possible that your graphics switched to the integrated and you need to disable it in the BIOS for your AGP Card to operate properly. </s>
<s> I haven't checked in a long time, but sort of remember for WinXP you keep clicking the F8 key while booting to get safe mode & the BIOS. </s>
<s> Let me write it this way, Whenever I try to put the Graphics Card in the AGP slot and try to restart the PC. </s>
<s> It just not responds. </s>
<s> I can't go the BIOS, Windows or anything if i have this card inserted. </s>
<s> As soon as i put the card out, it auto. </s>
<s> goes to onboard graphics and works abs. </s>
<s> fine. </s>
<s> I tried switching the graphics. </s>
<s> The only thing i can do in VIDEO CONFIG. </s>
<s> is select AGP/PCI, FRAME BUFFER AND APERATURE SIZE. </s>
<s> I switched between AGP/PCI, failed!. </s>
<s> I cleared CMOS, nothing again. </s>
<s> The card was working tremendous yesterday. </s>
<s> What that suggests? </s>
<s> Graphics card has gone bad? </s>
<s> Depending on different computers, many automatically just switch the on board graphics to the new AGP card in the BIOS without doing anything. </s>
<s> If you have also tried disabling the on board graphics while the AGP card was out and then putting the card in without results, then you may have a defective AGP card. </s>
<s> AGP cards normally come with instructions and a disk. </s>
<s> Your mobo or computer instructions should also talk about the integrated/and AGP enabling/disabling features. </s>
<s> Sorry I can't help further. </s>
<s> Altough, i am going to call for repair/replacement on Saturday on warranty. </s>
<s> But, connecting to TV matters?. </s>
<s> Can it blow up a card. </s>
<s> I inserted another card in the slot. </s>
<s> It worked fine. </s>
<s> So i am 98% sure its the card now! </s>
<s> I have played with my comp on a tv a few times... didnt have any problems. </s>
<s> No chance that the card was hit by a static discharge? </s>
<s> If everything was properly grounded, sounds like it's just a defective card. </s>
<s> It could be that some specific driver files for the card have become corrupted. </s>
<s> I seem to remember something like that happening to a friend of mine, however, I can't quite remember how he resolved the issue. </s>
<s> Probably by removing/replacing the corrupted driver files and then re-installing the card. </s>
<s> I also seem to remember something about video card and monitor conflicts...but in that case I don't think the card would've worked at all. </s>
