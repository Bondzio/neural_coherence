hey thanks a lot for the comments everyone!
i have bought the acer 5112 which i was looking at for a long time.
its a great computer...for me its incredible!
it runs new games on high speed (the one i tried was oblivion) very well.
the battery life isnt the greatest but thats cuz its a powerful notebook.
if you have any questions or if you wanna buy this laptop and cant find any reviews anywhere *arrrr* then you can ask me and i shall answer again thanx a lot!
