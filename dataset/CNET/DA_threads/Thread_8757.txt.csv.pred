1.1.1	My Dell AIO 964 scanning and copying facility just packed in and I 'm on the lookout for a new one .	St
1.1.2	I purchased a Dell wireless adapter to enable wireless capabilities and it worked well .	St
1.1.3	My question is , will this adapter work with any other make of printer and if so , will it work with any printer that has USB connection .	St
1.1.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Sorry after dealing with too many print servers , someday , somewhere you will find a printer that wo n't play with this .	St
1.3.1	That does n't make much sense to me .	St
1.4.1	I 'm just someone that gets called up when things do n't work .	St
1.4.2	My view is from the area where it has failed and I share that not all printers work with all print servers .	St
1.4.3	If you can , see if they publish a list of what works .	St
1.4.4	Mind you they ca n't keep an Area 51 of printers to test so the lists are always out of date or incomplete but if you are lucky you may see your printer on the list .	St
