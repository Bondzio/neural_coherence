<s> Hi, Im looking to turn my old desktop pc into a dvr to record some TV shows and watch them through my TV I hate to miss. </s>
<s> The problem is that Im a poor collage student so I dont have the mega-bucks to spend on the project. </s>
<s> Im torn between the Hauppauge wintv-150 and the ati TV wonder elite. </s>
<s> I know that the ati card has a better picture than the 150 but I dont think my pc can handle it. </s>
<s> The newest OS I have to run on this machine is Windows 2000 pro. </s>
<s> My machine has a 1 GHz pIII processor and as much ram as I can put in it. </s>
<s> Bottom line I just dont wont to waste money on something with poor resolution. </s>
<s> I also welcome alternatives </s>
<s> so your CPU isn't an issue. </s>
<s> the ati may have better video processing (slightly sharper image especially in still frames), but both will have the same resolution. </s>
<s> i think you'll be satisfied with the winTV. </s>
<s> ...particularly on the PVR software. </s>
<s> I believe 1.6GHz is the normal cutoff point for MPEG-2 recording, so your box will probably only be capable of encoding in MPEG-1, which leaves a little to be desired in terms of resolution quality. </s>
