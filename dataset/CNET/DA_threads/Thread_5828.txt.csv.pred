1.2.1	give you the option to mute the modem (normally done at initial set-up) but you can usually access this from your sign in screen.	St
1.2.2	If not, call your ISP for procedure It's actually not a good idea to mute the modem.	St
1.2.3	You could have a dialer placed on your machine & a hacker could make phone calls from it.	St
