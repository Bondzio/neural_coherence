<s> Ok here is my question. </s>
<s> I have an Emachiene T5212 ( http://reviews.cnet.com/eMachines_T5212/4507-3118_7-32085027.html?tag=sub ) and the specs say it has a max Video RAM of 128MB. </s>
<s> I was hoping to put in a direct x10 video card, but now it doesnt seam to be possiable. </s>
<s> My question is, can I add 2 video cards each having 128MB or can my computer only handle a total od 128MB, and does anyone have any suggestions on a good card. </s>
<s> Thanks!!!!! </s>

<s> Dual video board is not possible as far as I can see. </s>
<s> but dx10 is possible; look at some of the pci-express board above $300. </s>
<s> I think some of them have dx10 support. </s>

<s> Your emachines 5212 has a pci-express slot allowing 1 video card to be added. </s>
<s> (The pci-express video card will override your built-in video.) </s>
<s> The main contstraint is your power supply. </s>
<s> Its power rating is not listed in the PC's specifications but it's probably 300W. </s>
<s> Without upgrading your power supply you could add a geForce 8500 based card. </s>
<s> here's a msi 8500gt/256mb for $100 . </s>
<s> if you're willing to add a 400W (or better) power supply ($30-$40 or so) you could move up to a 8600gt for about $150 or a 8600gts for $170-$190. </s>
<s> 8600GT- 300W recommended minimum PS. </s>
<s> I have one in my Dell E521 which is 305W. </s>
<s> Big improvement over what I had (X1300 Pro). </s>
<s> BTW ati recommended minimum is 350W even though Dell offers it on the E521. </s>
<s> Dell underrates their PSU's a bit though. </s>
