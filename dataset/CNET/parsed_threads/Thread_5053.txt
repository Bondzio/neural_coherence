<s> Hello, I have been trying to play games like call of duty 2 and doom 3 and they run really slow and choppy. </s>
<s> I took this system requirements test and my graphics card was the only thing that failed the test. </s>
<s> So my question is if I want to upgrade a graphics card, can i just upgrade to any graphics card or does it matter what my pc specs are? </s>
<s> I have a Pentium 4, 3.06 ghz, 896 RAM, 146 GB hard drive, ATI RADEON EXPRESS 200, and i have a PCI express slot. </s>
<s> Get a card with as much RAM as you can afford, and make sure it'll fit/is designed for PCI Express. </s>
<s> Do you have an AGP slot? </s>
<s> If so, maybe a better choice. </s>
<s> but just because it has more doesn't mean it's better. </s>
<s> The memory interface is just as important if not more. </s>
<s> For example my system came with a 7300LE turbocache card listed as 256MB. </s>
<s> It was configured to use 512MB.64bit memory interface. </s>
<s> Most half decent cards now are true 256MB cards with a 128bit memory interface. </s>
<s> The higher-end cards are 256MB+ with 256bit+ memory interfaces. </s>
