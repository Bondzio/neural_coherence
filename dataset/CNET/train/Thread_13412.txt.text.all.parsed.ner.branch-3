(a brew pub / restaurant - which explains why i visit often.) they have customer wireless that's actually pretty good. but they're smart enough to not have a fixed password. when you show up, the hostess will give you a unique wifi key on a printed slip that's good for a couple of hours. when you sign into their web-auth, the key will give you access, but clearly expires after the normal guest access window. i don't know which system they're using, but it struck me as the most serviceable option i've seen in public use. it's certainly not something they're administering manually - something has to be generating the keys en-masse and setting the expirations.
