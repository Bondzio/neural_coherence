i have an hp pavilion 8750c / upgraded to 512 ram, just upgraded from win98se to windows xp home ed, and have an nec multisync fe700 monitor.
it started just before upgrading to the extra ram and win xp.......when i turn my system on, what i see on the screen comes up expanded, ie oversized, spread out so to speak, then sometimes normal.
after doing the upgrades, it now comes up expanded all the time.
i have gone into control panel and checked the &quot;sizing&quot; and it is all correct, i can only get the screen to fit my monitor if i go into the monitor controls and shrink it as much as i can there.
i lean towards thinking it is the monitor but could use some advice.
i have alwasy gotten great help here, thanks in advance.
