<s> The title explains itself. </s>
<s> I have had this computer since 2004 and I am surprised how long it has been before I attempted to put an expansion card or look for more RAM. </s>
<s> I bought an expansion card recently and I don't think it fits. </s>
<s> I did not know there were different kinds, so now I need to know which expansion cards will fit into a Compaq SR1053WM. </s>
<s> And obviously RAM chips are not the same type either. </s>
<s> What is the name or whatever for the type of RAM Chip and Expansion Slot that Compaq SR1053WM uses? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Also, kingston.com </s>
<s> exact info you need. </s>
<s> If you can't locate the manual...you should be able to locate it online. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I have figured it out for both issues, but that just gave me even more questions... Now that I have the memory chip, how do I install it?? </s>
<s> I know it just can't be as easy as inserting it while computer is turned off and unplugged; I am sure there has to be come kind of software configuration or something like that. </s>
<s> The expansion slots are called PCI. </s>
<s> But My computer has some other kind of expansion slot. </s>
<s> It has 3 white slots I have identified as PCI slots, but there is a mysterious brown colored expansion slot. </s>
<s> It is wierd. </s>
<s> I was sure that the PCI device would not fit...but it fit?? </s>
<s> and it is working perfectly!! </s>
<s> So I don't think I will have any problems with adding new PCI cards. </s>
<s> I moved recently and not unpacked yet, but I am sure that online manuals for Compaq SR1053WM is not difficult to find...And I might even find the answer of how to install a memory chip.....and also what the name of the brown expansion slot is... </s>
<s> Today's machines use just that method. </s>
<s> It was in the 80s and 90s that you needed to set jumpers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I found some phrases that might help: &quot;Unbuffered&quot;... &quot;Set Timings&quot;... After reading about setting timings, It sounds very important but I am even more confused...I found another topic on the message boards about this one person with a completely customized computer and had 2 different types of timings and that resulted in crashes. </s>
<s> This new chip will be 2 of 2 chips because that is what my present motherboard has. </s>
<s> It only has 2 slots. </s>
<s> How do I read what the timings are on my existing chip to make sure they are the same as the additional chip?? </s>
<s> Which timings are the most recommended...?? </s>
<s> I do not know the name of the motherboard. </s>
<s> It is just whatever usually came with a SR1053WM machine. </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7591_102-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=280242&messageID=2681201 This is the link to what I read. </s>
<s> That person's motherboard has Intel processor. </s>
<s> Mine is AMD. </s>
<s> I am not sure, but that part might have been important. </s>
<s> This is where you send them to crucial.com or kingston.com since they will get you the right parts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That brown colored slot is an AGP slot and is used to run a video card. </s>
<s> The most current slot is the PCIe. </s>
<s> If you get a video card you would need to get one that runs in the AGP slot not PCIe. </s>
<s> Your Compaq specifications say you have a AGP 8x slot Go back to crucial and run their scan. </s>
<s> This will tell you the specifications for the RAM you need. </s>
<s> You must get RAM that meets these specifications. </s>
<s> Print them out and take them to the store you intend to buy the RAM from they will know what you will need. </s>
<s> From the specifications from Compaq we can find this much information about your RAM: PC2700 MB/sec 184 pin, DDR1-333 SDRAM Here is the scan: http://www.crucial.com/store/drammemory.aspx About your PC hardware: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00088950&cc=us&dlc=en&lc=en&jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN#N323 </s>
<s> I have added the new chip for about 10 days and it has doubled my memory and I haven't had the problems that I did before. </s>
<s> So ...is it running better, noticeably better with the additional RAM ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> It is running better. </s>
<s> Much better. </s>
<s> =] Thanks for checking. </s>
