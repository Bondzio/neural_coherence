A month ago I did three things: -disconnect one of the two optical drives -remove one of the two RAM modules (now I have only 256MB on this system) -clean ALL the dust from the video card, and it was a LOT, especially below the cooler near the GPU I then booted it and it worked.
It hasn't frozen once for a month!
Today I wanted my 512MB RAM back and put in the second module again.
However, when I turned on the PC, the screen was just blank, nothing happened.
So I removed the RAM module again and now it works again.
Is that RAM module broken?
Or did I insert it wrongly?
I know that I inserted them in a different order than they were initially (there are 3 slots on the mobo, I used the two on the one side instead of the two on the other side, simply for reasons of easier to reach), does that matter?
So, freezing problem fixed, I don't know which of the 3 actions described above fixed it, and I have only 256MB RAM now.
