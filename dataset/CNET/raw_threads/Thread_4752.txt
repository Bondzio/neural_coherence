669	0	231610	2392130	NR	Mr Flibble	2/1/07 10:12 PM	1.17036792E12	System stability	Since I upgraded my computer, basically a full new one. ========================== abit mobo athlon 64 2.2ghz 512 ddr2 ram 80gb hdd gforce 7600 256 gfx card 19&quot; lcd monitor =========================== My computer is very unstable. If a hibinate it, I get a blue screen when it tries to reboot from hibenation point. It quite often blue screens while in windows, sometimes when i've left it on all day, I wiggle the mouse to bring it out of screensaver, then try to open say firefox, and it blue screens. I downloaded a memory test, to see if its the ram, but after a hour of running it returned no errors. I has the new system running on an ide hdd before I got the 80 gb sata, and it still had the same problem then. I've change the ram from slot 1 to slot 3, no difference. Has anyone got any ideas?
