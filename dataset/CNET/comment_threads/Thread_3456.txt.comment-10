I have a dell D610 running win xp2.
The wireless card is a dell 1470.
I pulled the card and installed in another D610 and have wireless internet on that machine.I then took the good card and installed it in the 1st D610.
No wireless internet.
I plugged in an Ethernet cable to get internet.
No Problem.
I reformatted the hard drive ,did a fresh install,checked the bios and upgraded to A06 and still no wireless.
any thoughts on this problem?
