<s> I currently have 2GBs of ram installed and want to know if It's possible to upgrade to two 2GB sticks for 4 total. </s>
<s> Also I want to upgrade my current video card http://tinyurl.com/7tcpllp to this one http://tinyurl.com/7e2q8wj will it fit? </s>
<s> I know I should just get a new computer and mine is old, but I really just have to make due with what I have right now. </s>
<s> If anyone has any suggestions on how I can improve my computer they will be appreciated. </s>
<s> Looks like 2GB is the limit. </s>

<s> The first link works. </s>
<s> The second is busted.....at least for me......does it work for you? </s>
<s> http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4700c/en/SM/specs.htm I was going to suggest a video card but the 160w PS stopped that idea as you'd need a better PS to go with it. </s>
<s> I seriously doubt adding RAM will provide a noticeable performance boost either. </s>
<s> You might consider banking the cost of it until you're ready to move on. </s>
<s> I know that's not what you're asking but, IMO, it's reasonable advice. </s>
<s> Did a quick check on the specs and it states it will support 4Gb, that's 2x2gb sticks of ram. </s>
<s> You have to remove the current 2x1gb to do that. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, if you're running the 32-bit OS, it will report 4gb of ram but can actually only use 3.2gb of it, due to OS limitations. </s>
