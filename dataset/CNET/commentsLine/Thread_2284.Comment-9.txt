if you are not in a hurry, i am editing video on a 900mhz g3 mac with 768megs of ram.
i use imovie, and though it is slow, it works not bad.
my 1.5ghz g4 powerbook works much faster and i have no complaints - it has 1.2 gigs of ram.
bottom line is, unless you are professionally in the business of editing video a lot, any mac with do just fine, as long as you have the ram - don't try it with 512megs!
