<s> I have been struggling for a couple months now to get my computer to burn a DVD-R disk. </s>
<s> The computer works fine with +R but when I try to create a -R the disk writes a little information on the disk and then the drive and computer lockup. </s>
<s> I have tried just about everything I can think of without lick. </s>
<s> Drive Type - I currently have an I/O magic drive but even purchased an Pioneer. </s>
<s> With the I/O Magic I could write +R but not -R. With the Pioneer I could not get either to work. </s>
<s> Windows - I was using Windows2000 but just spent the weekend upgrading to Windows XP and it has the same result. </s>
<s> Software - I have used many software packages including Nero, ROXIO, and Pinnacle. </s>
<s> Disk Types - I have tried both Teon and verbatim Disks. </s>
<s> I have read other forums and found others having similar situations but no smoking gun. </s>
<s> Ideas welcome! </s>
<s> See if there is some updated firmware and my trick of recording at 1/2 (or lower) the rated drive or media speed. </s>

<s> I checked IO Magic for the latest firmware and loaded an update already without any change in operation. </s>
<s> Have also tried all the various speeds also without progress. </s>
<s> Other thoughts? </s>
<s> If it isnt the oldest bad doctor joke in history, its probably close: A guy goes to the doctor, moves his arm in a funky way, and says, Doc, it hurts when I do this. </s>
<s> Dont do that, the doctor inevitably answers. </s>
<s> Until you sort it out, stop doing that. </s>
<s> It's likely the drive needs firmware or is failing, but you didn't supply the exact make/model of the drive. </s>
<s> Hint: I/O Magic didn't make that drive. </s>
<s> It's something they got in bulk and had their label put on. </s>
