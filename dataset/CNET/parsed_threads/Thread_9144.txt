<s> Hi everyone, I am in dire need of a control Pod for my logitech Z-5500 Speaker system. </s>
<s> This is just the silver box with volume dial and control buttons. </s>
<s> If anyone has one they would like to sell me, or knows where i could get one, Please let me know. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>

<s> Have you cheked with Logitech to see if they have that item available? </s>
<s> It's possible you might be able to order a replacement control pod direct from them. </s>
<s> Im asuming that you have 1 full system and a &quot;headless system&quot;. </s>
<s> If so you can run both systems off of one control pod. </s>
<s> All you must do is make a 15 pin Dsub splitter. </s>
<s> A standard VGA splitter (powered or not) will not work. </s>
<s> You must have all 15 wires. </s>
<s> You must go to radio shack, buy 2 female, and 1 male 15 pin D-sub connectors. </s>
<s> Than solder 15 wires (the largest guage you can fit) than split those wires in to 2 wires, making a Y connector. </s>
<s> Than using an ohms meter to trace wires, tape and number each wire. </s>
<s> than on the 30 wire ( 15 split into 2) solder wire 1 onto pin one of both female plugs, continue to do this to all 30 wires. </s>
<s> once you get done let a glue gun get really hot and squirt glue into wires soldered onto plugs to help them hold on. </s>
<s> The reason this works is because there is 18+ volts being sent and recieved amoung the amp and pod. </s>
<s> You must have both systems plugged in, this will still allow the same amount of volts to be sent and recieved. </s>
<s> This is time consuming, but it works Great! </s>
<s> you will have 1000 watts of sub!! </s>
<s> The volume doest get worse, there is no power issues like many claim. </s>
<s> George P.S. </s>
<s> this isnt hard im 15 years old and figured it out! </s>
<s> Hey I'll give you $40 if you make this for me. </s>
<s> I know this is 6 months late and you probly already threw it out...but if you didnt email me at monkeyman93@msn.com, id be glad too. </s>
