Hi, using a hp desktop with windows xp home.
352mb ram.
I used to be able to copy a cd with no problems.
Now when I try to burn a cd,it will get to 65%, and my computer will shut down and restart.
I checked the heat inside of the computer, and it seem to be ok.
I left the side panel off, and the fan is working ok. Any help would be appreciated.
Other then this my computer is working real good.
