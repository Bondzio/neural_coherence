You mention &quot;generic&quot; and that what can happen, especially on a loaded-up system.
At least 400W is better than 300W whcih many a home build system case comes supplied with, so at least you started out decent.
The problem with a blown p/s unit is that it *could* cause other problem(s).
So don't discount it should after replacing the p/s unit flaky problem(s) may appear.
The better p/s units are Enermax or Antec(sp) or those supplied by pcpowerandcooling(dang good).
It not surprising that 500W+ units are now available and even if generic is better than 400W unless name brand.
good luck -----Willy
