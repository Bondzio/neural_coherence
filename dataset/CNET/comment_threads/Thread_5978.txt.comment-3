As the other post says you haven't told us much, you say you get the error but dont say if your system crashes!
Anyway SHDOCVW.DLL is a IExplorer file so it is likely you have spyware as (i assume) a program at startup is trying to load a web page.
Therefore run spyware programs and if that doesn't work stop items in the startup folder of msconfig from loading until you find the culprit.
