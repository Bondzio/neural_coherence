1.1.1	I installed a new 40GB HDD and attempted to install XP.	St
1.1.2	The XP CD didn't start so I changed the BIOS to load from the CD first.	St
1.1.3	When I restarted my monitor says no signal received and nothing works.	St
1.1.4	I tried a boot disk (floppy) with the same results.	St
1.1.5	Any ideas?	St
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Put everything back to when/where it worked.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	During the installation of the new HD you may have dislodge the Video Card?	St
1.3.2	Try reseating it properly.	St
1.3.3	You said you were able to boot into the BIOS to change the boot sequence to CD-ROM?	St
1.3.4	So the screen wasn't blank right?	St
1.3.5	Just recheck your video card and all cables inside the PC and try again.	St
1.4.1	I have no idea if this makes any sense but I got it to boot into safe mode and changed the power setting from home/office to always on (which it was before) and it took off on restart...Loading XP now...Thanks for your suggestions anyway...	St
1.5.1	I spoke too soon.	St
1.5.2	XP formatted the disk, loaded the initial programs and did the first reboot.	St
1.5.3	There was a small amount of activity on the CD drive, the screen went blank and it been like that for 15 minutes.	St
1.5.4	What do I try next?	Sug
1.5.5	Thanks	Polite
