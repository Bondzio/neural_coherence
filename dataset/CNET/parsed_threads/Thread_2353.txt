<s> OK, I have an issue that I'm not sure how to solve. </s>
<s> I live in college apartment where the building provides internet access with one network jack in every room. </s>
<s> In the living room we set up a Netgear wireless access point with DHCP turned on so all the hosts on that network have a private IP address (IE 192.168.1.5 ect... with a subnet of 255.255.255.0) In the bedroom we have a Netgear gigabit switch which has no web interface, it simply splits the bedrooms private IP address assigned by the apartment into 3 IP address (IE 172.17.105.68 for my roommates computer, 172.17.105.162 for my computer and 172.17.105.59 for my HP printer. </s>
<s> They are on the subnet 255.255.252.0 ) The 172.17.105.___ is the block that my apartment uses. </s>
<s> My problem is that I am trying to access the files on my PC in my room on the switch using my Mac in the living room with the wireless access point. </s>
<s> How can I go about accessing these files without putting them online and being able to print from the wireless to the hosts on the switch? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> It may be you need to make a route but there is some machine that hands out the 172 range. </s>
<s> You would need to learn a lot more about TCP/IP routing but the simple answer is no. </s>
<s> But look up GOTOMYPC and similar for solutions that avoid learning about networking. </s>
