I work from home taking inbound calls for a satellite TV provider and we are now transitioning to a different type of system and there are new pc requirements that my current pc no longer meets.
can someone please give me a good suggestion on what make and model desktop or laptop I can get that meets these requirements, P.S I'm looking for the absolute cheapest option and I live I Oklahoma city, ok I am willing to buy online and would appreciate any suggestions on legitimate financing options &#8226;
