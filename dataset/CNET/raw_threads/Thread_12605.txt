Although I'll probably follow these requirements, I was just wondering why the size of hard drives in laptops is limited. Anyone know? What if I put in a 320GB hard drive? Would it work? oh yeah, if I did upgrade my hard drive, is there some kind of program already installed (I have XP Media Center Edition) that can make a complete transfer of all my data to the new drive or would I have to download a special program?

Dell does, but maybe you can tell us? To clone the drive, you'll need some place that has access to both drives. And that won't be your laptop if that has only one drive. The best thing to do: use the cloning software that comes with your new drive and mount it in an external enclosure to do the cloning. Hope this helps. Kees

I just built a desktop pc, and it had no such restrictions. What's so different between the two, besides their bulk?
