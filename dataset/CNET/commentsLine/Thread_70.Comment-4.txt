i knew i needed a new hard drive.
i got a new one.
the fans broke, as in the blades fell off... wow.
but the people that fixed it installed new fans and thermostats that says what the computer's temperature is, and has a control of how high the fans are.
right now the fans are set to 100%.
there are several other things that came with the repaired computer.
