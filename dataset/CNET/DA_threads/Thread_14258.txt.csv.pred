1.1.1	First off , my hardware : AMD Phenom XII 955 no overclock Asus M4A79T Deluxe Mobo Corsair CMPSU-650 650w PSU VisionTek Radeon HD4870 512MB LG WH08LS20K 8x BluRay burner WD Caviar Black WD7501AALS 750GB 7200RPM HD Mushkin Blackline 4GB ( 2x2GB ) DDR3 1600 SDRAM Encore ENLWI-N PCI 2.3 Wireless Adapter Monitor Vizio VX32L Windows 7 64-bit Norton AV My computer will freeze and become totally unresponsive , mainly when watching HD video on youtube , downloading torrent files via uTorrent , or if my background is set to a photo album and rotating pictures .	St
1.1.2	Those are the 3 most common ways it will freeze right now , though it happens very occasionally other times .	St
1.1.3	No error messages , the screen just freezes and I get static coming through my speakers .	St
1.1.4	All of my drivers are updated , and in the past I have reformatted my HD for a fresh install , but still getting stuck .	St
1.1.5	I can watch full 1080P video no problem in Media Player classic and Windows Media player , but when I try to stream anything in HD , I have problems .	St
1.1.6	No issues watching youtube at 480p or lower , but if I dare click for 720P it will play for a little bit , maybe even make it through a whole video , but the inevitable always happens .	St
1.1.7	I have tested the memory with Memtest86+ , no issues there .	St
1.1.8	I have also ran the trial version of PCMark Vantage and got a score of 7599 .	St
1.1.9	Nothing looks fishy from that , except it says my graphics memory is 1MB .	St
1.1.10	If needed I can try to provide a link to the online results from that test .	St
1.1.11	I am about to run 3D Mark Vantage also ( trial version ) but have a hard time believing it may be my video card , since I have no issue watching HD Video any other time other than in a browser and have no issue running the Unreal Editor Kit .	St
1.1.12	I currently am running IE8 , but have had the same issues with Firefox , actually seemed to have more issues with Firefox which is why I went back to rocking IE8 .	St
1.1.13	I also thought the problem somehow might be the wireless adapter could n't handle the bandwith of HD video , so I plugged the computer directly into the router , and still had issues .	St
1.1.14	I have also run CC Cleaner to fix any registry errors .	St
1.1.15	I have to restart the system to be able to use it again .	St
1.1.16	Anyone have any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.17	Any other tests I can run to find the problem ?	Ques
1.1.18	If more info is needed , I will post it right away .	St
1.1.19	I would greatly appreciate any help .	Polite
1.1.20	Thanks for your time .	St
1.2.1	I would add more RAM if possible just to cover 64-bit capability .	St
1.2.2	Plus , check cooling is well maintained .	St
1.2.3	If no error pop-up , then the system is basically trying to keep up .	St
1.2.4	The reason I mention more RAM is it becomes a buffer in order to handle the stream .	St
1.2.5	While , I think your video card is capable , if its not well cooled , it will start to falter .	St
1.2.6	Freezing PCs are hard to fix as no real clue is present .	St
1.2.7	I would at least allow it to remain in freeze state and see if it recovers giving at least 10-15min .	St
1.2.8	more before rebooting .	St
1.2.9	You can check your error/event log and review it .	Sug
1.2.10	http : //www.windows7update.com/Windows7-Event-Viewer.html Further , the AMD cpu maybe at fault .	St
1.2.11	Check online and see if yours has any history or patches that may cover the issue .	St
1.2.12	Also , heat is very critical for AMD cpus and chipsets , so its a possibility as an issue .	St
1.2.13	Also , is this direct or wi-fi connection ?	Ques
1.2.14	Why , because wi-fi connection can vary for whatever reason and could be hitting a sore point .	St
1.2.15	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Thanks Willy , I will be checking all of that out today .	St
1.3.2	I really appreciate the help !	St
1.4.1	It is a wi-fi connection most of the tikme , but I have plugged in a hard connection and still had the same issues , so I assume my wi-fi isnt the problem .	St
1.5.1	I checked the event log , to be honest , I am not real sure what I am looking for , though I thought I would be able to spot a problem if I saw one .	St
1.5.2	It could be & quot ; user error & quot ; that I did n't notice troubling though .	St
1.5.3	I am not too sure how to check my temps on the CPU , but was able to check my GPU and it runs between 75C-77C it seems .	St
1.6.1	In the event log , look for any obivous clue .	St
1.6.2	Since it freezes it wo n't be able to report but there 's a chance it may .	St
1.6.3	As for any heat issues , run the PC with cover off and fan blowing IN and see if it lasts longer or gets further before a freeze .	St
1.6.4	I mentioned a possible AMD issue as together with the AMD chipset could be an issue , but check the AMD forum and query there and/or review what 's posted .	St
1.6.5	Also , you may want to & quot ; repaste & quot ; the cpu to HSF setup using the thermo paste like Arctic Silver for better operation instead of any & quot ; thermal tape setup .	St
1.6.6	Check Arctic Silver website for such details .	St
1.6.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	even when minimized .	St
1.7.2	Is that GPU temp at idle ?	Ques
1.7.3	If yes ... .I 'd if there 's a GPU utility that will increase the GPU fan speed to reduce the heat .	St
1.7.4	VAPCMD	St
