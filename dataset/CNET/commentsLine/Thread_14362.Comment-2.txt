some boards which offer dual channel ram access are rather touchy with the brand and speed of memory sticks installed, but matched pairs are not absolutely necessary.
however, a matched pair has been tested in tandem prior to packaging, so one has a bit of a leg-up there!
remember that the sticks need to be in the designated slots on the board, as described (hopefully) in the manufacturers manual, to run in dual mode.
