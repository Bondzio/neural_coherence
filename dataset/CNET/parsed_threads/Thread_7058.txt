<s> Hello all, My comp is in the process of crashing out on me and I'm currently trying to find a new computer tower to replace it. </s>
<s> I'm not very tech savvy so I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for, and more importantly, where to find it/get a good deal online. </s>
<s> I don't need anything that is completely decked across all specs and is an &quot;absolute beast of a machine.&quot; I'm really only in the market for something that has good memory, good speed, and the ability to support at least dual DVI monitors. </s>
<s> I have found a few places online but they all seem to charge what appears to be astronomical prices (&gt; 1200 and up to 3000). </s>
<s> I assumed that something like this should be achievable at or around 600-900 at least, but I simply do not know. </s>
<s> Anyone have any good suggestions here? </s>
<s> I truly appreciate it... </s>
<s> Thanks and have a Merry Christmas, - Jon </s>
<s> We just use the usual Dell machines. </s>
<s> Why not Dell? </s>
<s> practically any new $700 laptop will do what you require. </s>
<s> That's a 549 buck laptop and a 165 buck screen at http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=desktop2.jpg That's a HP dv6910us with the debranded 22 inch HP screen. </s>
<s> This machine has been very nice and not a single crash since day one. </s>
<s> I use it mainly for here, Vistual Studio 2008, Palm application development and a little stock trading. </s>
<s> The lightscribe works ok with the supplied and free tools. </s>
