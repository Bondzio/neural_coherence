i have just installed my first hard drive and the hardware installation was smooth.
now i have a problem with the partition of the hard drive.
i don't understand what it means to partition the hd, and most importantly, how much to partition it.
i have a western digital 160gb eide .
i understand that i won't get all that 160gb, but i want to get the most out of it using ntfs because i read that it is more secure than fat.
my computer specs are 900 mhz, 512ram, western digital 160gb eide please explain what partitioning the hard drive is in lamest terms and please explain how many sections should i partition it into as well as any recommendations.
thank you so much .
