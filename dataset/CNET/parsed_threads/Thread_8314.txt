<s> My grandson installed a new graghics card in his computer and his LCD monitor wouldn't work right. </s>
<s> After doing the calculations and going to the Antec website to verify the numbers it turns out he needs to upgrade his power supply. </s>
<s> There are so many brands out there, which is the best brand? </s>
<s> He wants to stay in the $100 or below range. </s>
<s> We are going to put in either a 500 or 550 watt unit (he has a 300watt now) and am looking at the Antec or Thermaltake brand. </s>
<s> Is there any difference dependability wise of these two brands or are there better ones. </s>
<s> Any advise would be appreciated. </s>

<s> Why? </s>
<s> The Thermaltake's could be fine but I find SLEEVE BEARING FANS in much of their gear with the better ball bearing fans in the Antec's. </s>
<s> Why bother? </s>
<s> The sleeve bearing fans tend to last about 2 years here. </s>

<s> The two you mentioned are decent brands. </s>
<s> Some users *may* complain of noise levels but even with good brands, there are so many models it does get confusing. </s>
<s> I suggest besides using a wattage calculator buy the biggest hunking psu and brandname and provide for a stable system. </s>
<s> The better the psu the more the cost, but cost does pay back in a stable system. </s>
<s> Take into acct. </s>
<s> if it fails it may take other devices/components with it. </s>
<s> As for noise, look for the dB levels as part of the specs.,, however as stated so many psus out there check at these websites and others: http://www.geeks.com http://www.newegg.com httpp://www.cyberguys.com for cost comparisons. </s>

<s> I had a little more time to research power supplies and have decieded to get the Antec NEOHE 550 watt power supply. </s>
<s> It does go over his $100 buget, but I will make up the difference as this looks like a very good supply from the reviews. </s>
<s> They have it at Circuit City here in town, so we don't have to worry about the shipping. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>

<s> they've gotten bad reviews. </s>
<s> the antec basiq 500w ($50 at circuit city) is probably the best $50 power supply. </s>
<s> here are some other suggestions: coolermaster extreme 550w ($55) and coolermaster extreme 600w ($70) (good budget choices but somewhat noisy) enermax liberty 500w antec neo-he 550w ($88) but it's difficult to recommend any over the basiq for most PCs. </s>
<s> Thanks for those links. </s>
<s> I just picked up the Antec neo-he 550 and we are going to put it in the computer tomorrow AM. </s>
<s> That should take care of the problem. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
