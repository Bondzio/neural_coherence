1.1.1	I just decided & quot ; what the heck & quot ; and bought the 8800 GTS .	St
1.1.2	my question is about my processor .	St
1.1.3	I am confident with my other system specs , so they are not important .	St
1.1.4	but currently i have an AMD 64 3200+ .	St
1.1.5	Is it stupid of me to spend that much money on an 8800 GTS when i have this processor ?	Ques
1.1.6	I dont want the card to run slower because of my processing power .	St
1.1.7	so what should i do ?	Ques
1.1.8	Spend the money to upgrade to a dual core processor ?	Ques
1.1.9	or should a game like crysis use the card fully with the processor i have now ?	Ques
1.1.10	also , if i was to upgrade , what is a recommended processor that wouldnt bottleneck the 8800 GTS ?	Ques
1.1.11	Any helpful suggestions are welcome..	St
1.2.1	you 've got a high-end gpu , but a somewhat low-end cpu .	St
1.2.2	since more new games are going to be multi-threaded , you should get a dual-core .	St
1.2.3	an x2 4200 has a 200mhz bump over your cpu so it will be a bit faster in single-threaded apps also .	St
1.3.1	ok , thanks for the help .	Polite
1.3.2	x2 4200 or better huh ?	Ques
1.3.3	should i look at anything over on the intel side ?	Ques
1.4.1	but do you want to get a new motherboard then ?	Ques
1.4.2	There are a few 939 dual-core CPUs that you could upgrade to if you want to keep the same motherboard assuming that you have a 939 now as Googling that CPU brought up a 939 model .	St
1.4.3	If you do go for the Intel side then a Core 2 Duo or better would be my suggestion .	St
1.4.4	Regards , JB	St
1.5.1	Look at Intel .	St
1.5.2	Otherwise , you 're better off saving the money and working with what you have .	St
1.5.3	A processor upgrade is n't a big deal , and even a 4200+ would be able to handle whatever you throw at it .	St
1.5.4	I know ; I use one and have a 7900GT , and I have no problems running games at all .	St
1.5.5	Except Oblivion , of course ... but who does n't have problems with that ?	Ques
1.5.6	Anyway , look at the X2 4x00+ line .	St
1.5.7	You wo n't be disappointed .	St
