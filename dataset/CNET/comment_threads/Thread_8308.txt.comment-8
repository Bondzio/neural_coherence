just being hopeful.
I see somewhere on my PSU &quot;3.3 volts&quot; but can't honestly say what the heck it refers to,lol.
Well, I guess I can call myself lucky after all these years of my home-made systems.
About the only piece of hardware that's ever failed on me was FDD- twice.
Never a psu, optical drive, or anything else for that matter that I can recall.
The time I had my case open with the case fan sharing the power via a Y cable falling over and ripping out the ciruit board from my brand new 80 gig HD doesn't count, I think, lol.
This has NOT been a fun day.
All I need is rain, lol.
