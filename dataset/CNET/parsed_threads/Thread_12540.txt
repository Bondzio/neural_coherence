<s> Ok boys and girls, I have a few questions. </s>
<s> I have a dimension 4700 and I'm thinking about a few upgrades. </s>
<s> First, I'll tell you what and how I have it running. </s>
<s> Here are my specs: 4700 RAM: 2 x 512 433Mhz DDR2 interrogated video Intel Pentium IV 3.4 HT 140 gb HD Running Vista Enterprise (same as Ultimate, minus Media Center) I tried to max it out as best as possible when I bought it. </s>
<s> Now as to what I want to put in it. </s>
<s> I'm planning on adding 2 extra gigs of ram 2 X 1gb. </s>
<s> Here is the URL for the product. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134046 Now I don't think I will have a problem. </s>
<s> They match specs with the exception that this runs at 533 and the ram in the system is running at 400-something. </s>
<s> From what I understand, it'll just run at the slower speed, right? </s>
<s> Now a graphics card is needed. </s>
<s> This is the one I had in mind. </s>
<s> http://www.buy.com/prod/XFX_GeForce_7600GS_256MB_PCI_Express_x16_Video_Card_Dual_DVI_S_Video/q/loc/61905/203000306.html Again, I have the PCIe card, so there shouldn't be a problem. </s>
<s> My only concern is my 305watt power supply. </s>
<s> I don't use all the features with the computer (all 6 USB ports) and things like that, so I'm not too worried. </s>
<s> So at the end I'm hoping to have these specs Dell 4700 RAM: 3 gb 2 x 1 gig and 2 x 512 Video: Geforce 7600GS 256 MB Pentium IV 3.4 Does that sound like a mean system or what?? </s>
<s> What you you all think? </s>
<s> Will I have issues with those parts? </s>
<s> Anything I should know? </s>
<s> Should I pull out the 512mb ram cards and leave it with 2 x 1gb or will it be fine with all four dimms taken? </s>
<s> Thanks for all the advice. </s>

<s> your ram choice is fine as long it supports ddr2-533, but you need to determine what your current ram is running at. </s>
<s> ( cpu-z can figure it out for you.) </s>
<s> the dell comes with ddr2-400 or ddr2-533, not ddr2-433 (which doesn't exist). </s>
<s> personally, if you're running ddr2-400, i'd dump the existing ram and use all ddr2-533. </s>
<s> as for the graphics card, what do you plan to use the pc for? </s>
<s> the 7600gs is an entry-level 3d card, can play some games, and will work fine with your 300w power supply. </s>
<s> this evga 7600gs is a better buy at $85 before $20 rebate. </s>
<s> if you don't plan on playing an games and don't like rebates, this evga 7300gt is $66 straight up. </s>
<s> Get what your mobo support. </s>
<s> Some memory can be touchy. </s>
<s> You can buy 433Mhz DDR2 in 1GB sticks. </s>
<s> Good choice to max it out. </s>
<s> Your Video card choice is also a good upgrade, especially at 256. </s>
<s> Some will argue for ATI. </s>
<s> Consider a good replacement P/S if the Dell shows any age/wear but their supplies are better than the watts shown. </s>
<s> But a really good supply is a positive upgrade to consider. </s>
<s> Past that a new Mobo and a Core Duo would be next and what you buy now will be usable. </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure it's ddr2-400. </s>
<s> I bought it over two years ago. </s>
<s> As for what I use the PC for, I usually use it for school work and some games. </s>
<s> I used to play America's Army, before it got too intense for the integrated video. </s>
<s> Same thing with War Rock. </s>
<s> I'm really looking for something that I can play some games and have enough. </s>
<s> Oh and get out of vista basic hell! </s>
<s> I have a laptop that has a GeForce 6150. </s>
<s> That has actually made it like night and day when switching back and forth. </s>
<s> So I'm hoping a 7600 will be even better. </s>

<s> evga cards are good overclockers so you can get more performance easily if you wish. </s>
<s> this evga 7600gt is another option for $110 before $20 rebate. </s>
<s> a 350w power supply is recommended but i've seen folks use in dells without any issue. </s>
<s> anything faster than a 7600gt will require a new power supply though. </s>
