<s> I have a 400 mhz computer that I put in a sound card and plays cd music that is hooked up to the cd rom drive. </s>
<s> but when I conect to the sound card no sound I think it had an onboard sound card on irq 9 how do you disable it. </s>
<s> Go inside of Bios and you will be able to disable onboard sound there. </s>
<s> 1) Reboot after you disable onboard sound 2) If the sound card is installed then you install the software for the sound card. </s>
<s> 3) Then you configure your card if you have digital speakers, make sure the card is set up for that, if not disable digital sound. </s>
<s> 4) Good luck Wendell H </s>
