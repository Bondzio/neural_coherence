Sometimes I can restart. Sometimes it won.t restart for hours. I think its overheating, but cannot proof this ther. I have opened the case to keep it cooler but it still shuts off. Some days it does not shut off. Help

Further, make darn sure all *fans* are working 100%, not intermit. Makes ure the psu fan itself is running, if itsn't it won't be apparent and the psu becomes weak and cuases power problems, plus it may blow. Also, verify the cpu HSF(heatsink) is OK, not dangling at an &quot;angle&quot; or such, because it must be fully in contact with the cpu to disperse heat and do its job, in other words don't take anything for granted, check it. Finally, being 6yr. old it could be on its last legs and showing that the psu just has degraded to a point to become, &quot;iffy&quot; and replacement is the real cure. Further, all componets together due to age taht any one componet is dragging down and being old system it won't take much. However, you probably have a weak psu, rep;lace it. tada -----Willy

Thanks willy, I just went through a recovery cycle and was putting XP back on over an old windows 98 when it shut down in the middle of installing xp. Is there a fan that will fit over the cpu? Is the psu plugged into the mother board? RKILLGORE

Further, a HSF over the years can creep away or fall abit due to gravity and heat/cold cycles of running on/off. You should inspect closely to see or simply reseat the whole HSF setup. This is located on the cpu itself. depending on your model HP you may(or not) have a secondary fan blowing on or away for greater cooling effect of the cpu, it may also be just a platstic tube or tunnel to allow the cpu fanm outside air. tada -----Willy
