first, have the drive detected and defined in the bios and not set to &quot;auto&quot; where it will detect with each restart.
next, consider whether your power supply is adequate.
it's possible the drive is not spinning up quickly enough.
you might also disable any &quot;fast detect&quot; options in the bios or such that does only a quick memory check.
it might mean that your entering the bios and doing nothing just adds enough delay time for the drive to get ready in time before windows starts.
