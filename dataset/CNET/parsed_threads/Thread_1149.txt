<s> As the title suggested. </s>
<s> How do you achieve optimal hard drive parition? </s>
<s> Or what do you think is the best way to achieve it? </s>
<s> For me, I use Partition Magic but I am not sure if it is the best and whether I doing the right way with it. </s>
<s> It depends on what/how you want to partition. </s>
<s> For creating new partitions (including logical ones) I use Window's Disk Management and that has never gone wrong for me. </s>
<s> However if I want to do more of the complex stuff that Partition Magic offers (merge partitions, rename a partition, redistribute free space, resize, etc. </s>
<s> ), I would use that. </s>
<s> Oh and for installing a new OS, even though PM offers that I don't use it, I like doing it the conventional way. </s>
<s> But if you like it, use it. </s>
<s> I'm just stating my opinion </s>
<s> IS there an optimal way to partition a hard drive? </s>
<s> In general or in any particular situation, like &quot;tell me the details of your PC and what you do with it, and I'll tell you the optimal configuration for that machine&quot;? </s>
<s> If there isn't, the only possible answer to your question is that it is an question without an answer. </s>
<s> Something like &quot;how do I walk to the moon?&quot;, or even &quot;how do I reach the end of the rainbow?&quot;. </s>
<s> I think for most of us one partition per drive is optimal. </s>
<s> And that's easy to achieve the first time you use it. </s>
<s> No magic needed. </s>
