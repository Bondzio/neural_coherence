to my friend's issue.
secure tightly all connections, that includes the graphic card, connector pins, etc.
the last time it happened was a loose cable not secured tightly.
the next possible is the power scheme you've setup for the system.
have you done similar procedure before without any problem?
check your bios for the power settings as well.
disable sleep mode to, wake-on-lan, etc.
run as normally power-up/power-down instead of putting it to sleep, and work from there.
