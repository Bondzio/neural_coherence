if you use your laptop mostly on the road, then you should probably get a portable external drive.
it doesn't need to be any larger than your laptop drive if it's for backup.
lacie drives come with excellent backup software, including drive cloning software.
you could choose to carry a portable drive with your laptop that contains a clone of your laptop's internal drive.
i have two external hard drives connected to my desktop.
one uses a firewire connection to my desktop computer and lacie's silverkeeper software &quot;clones&quot; my desktop drive to that one.
being firewire, it means that i could boot from it if necessary.
i also have a usb hard drive for storage of archived data, backing up my home folder (i'm paranoid about backups!)
and i will start keeping movies, music and pictures on it eventually.
both drives are idiot-proof in that you just have to plug them into the wall, connect to the computer and turn them on and they're recognized by your computer.
you can then decide whether you want to reformat them for some reason.
having only used lacie drives, i do know that they come with pretty simple instructions if you want to do that.
