the panasonic ip camera is very nice.
i will not know any prices, but the cctv models from panasonic give the usual tv quality or a little less.
what some expect are digital camera quality.
but that's not going to happen at 352xsuch pixels.
that pixel cound is ok for tv, but pc users will revolt at the terrible pictures.
another option is a 60 buck camaera and capture card like this...   you might find some usb capture dongle, but the framerate will be what it will be.
