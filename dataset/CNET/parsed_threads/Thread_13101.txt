<s> I'm hooking up a network for someone, while I know a fair amoout about computers to work things out, I am still new to networking. </s>
<s> THe thing is, this person has his HOME PC running on a USB WIRELESS (2wire/sbc) because the closet wall jack is upstairs. </s>
<s> Also, he wants his laptop to have internet access at home, so he can take it to work and home. </s>
<s> If I am correct, he needs a router right? </s>
<s> He has the DSL modem, and when I installed the PC/wifi card in his laptop it connected, but it says there is limited or no connect. </s>
<s> Generally speaking, its as if two computers are trying to get connect to one DSL modem, therefore I need a router? </s>
<s> THanks for the help and clarification </s>
<s> You say it is connected, but to what? </s>
<s> Could you be picking up the neighbors WAP? </s>
<s> It says it is connected to my DSL MODEM. </s>
<s> it is number 223 or something, and the one on the HOME PC is connected to 223, so I did the same for the laptop and it detects it and all that jazz, but there is no acivity. </s>
<s> Something about being assigned a network somethin? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> into the workings of this modem/router? </s>
<s> Name the product and/or look through the manual. </s>
<s> Don't know what your setup is, but I had the same problem at home using a cable modem. </s>
<s> It was because the cable modem can only give 1 IP address at a time, so only one PC can be connected at a time. </s>
<s> The first one turned on will get a connection and the other won't. </s>
<s> Short term, power off both machines, reset the modem, then power up the machine you want to connect. </s>
<s> Do this each time your want a different machine to connect. </s>
<s> Ideally though you do need a router. </s>
<s> The router will take the 1 IP address from the modem, then give separate IP addresses to the PC's. </s>
<s> If you follow the manual with the router it's relatively straight forward </s>
<s> He has a 2wire home wireless DSL modem, not sure on the specific model, its the one with 4 ethernet ports in the back. </s>
<s> It makes sense about only being able to give one PC an IP address at a time. </s>
<s> Really, I dont know if he needs both PCs on at the same time, it would probably be convenient, but I can try just connecting one at a time if thats the case. </s>
<s> What kind of router would I need to set up two wireless PCs to work at the same time with one DSL modem? </s>
<s> THanks again </s>
