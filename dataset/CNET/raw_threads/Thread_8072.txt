I have bought two Kingston 512 MB of RAM and I have propely put it in the soket. The problem is that on Windows, it says that I have 896 MB of RAM. Please help!

If not this could be the issue. That is why many mamory manufacturer sites have a configuration tool. This will allow you to put the make and model of you board in there and it will tell you the part numbers that you should purchase. This is really a big factor. Does not matter if you set the memory in there correctly or not. For example on SOYO board only takes dual sided RAM in slots 1 and 3 and in slots 2 and 4 it must be single sided. Which leads me to another factor. You could try moving your RAM into differnt slot combinations because you may have the same issue. The final thought would be that you have a bad stick.

6075	4	161406	1791520	1790812	decjenson	3/6/06 1:45 PM	1.1416527E12	Yes	I did not find anything like the sort.
6075	5	161406	1791634	1791520	linkit	3/6/06 2:38 PM	1.14165588E12	you still haven't told us...	...where you get this number. Also, is it listed as total RAM, free RAM, used RAM? What is the computer model? Does your computer use integrated video or a video card that has shares system memory? If so, some places will display the total system memory minus that which is being used for video display. What does PC Wizard ( http://www.cpuid.org/pcwizard ) say about your installed memory?
6075	6	161406	1791637	1791634	linkit	3/6/06 2:42 PM	1.14165612E12	whoops, you did tell us...	...that you got it from the System Properties window. Sorry about that. Still, try a system utility program like the one I previously mentioned.
6075	7	161406	1792183	1791518	VAPCMD	3/6/06 8:18 PM	1.14167628E12	Did you say you had integrated video in the MB...	If you subtract 896MBs RAM from 1024MBs RAM you get 128MBs. Since you've added RAM, maybe plug and play and the OS sets aside more RAM ... maybe 64MBs, for the onboard video.
6075	8	161406	1802728	1791634	decjenson	3/11/06 5:57 PM	1.14209982E12	Thnkx!	I also have to inform you that I made this custom. It has an ATI Express 200 and I think that it takes 128 MB of my RAM. Thanx!
6075	9	161406	1803311	1802728	VAPCMD	3/12/06 6:23 AM	1.14214458E12	2nd try...does your system have an integrated video ?? or	a separate video card ?? Or one of the new video cards that has some RAM on the card but can use some of the system memory too ?
