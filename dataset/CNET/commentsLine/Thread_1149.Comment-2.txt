it depends on what/how you want to partition.
for creating new partitions (including logical ones) i use window's disk management and that has never gone wrong for me.
however if i want to do more of the complex stuff that partition magic offers (merge partitions, rename a partition, redistribute free space, resize, etc.
), i would use that.
oh and for installing a new os, even though pm offers that i don't use it, i like doing it the conventional way.
but if you like it, use it.
i'm just stating my opinion
