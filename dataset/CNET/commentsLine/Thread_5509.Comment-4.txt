i would upgrade ram, then video(replace) and finally the cpu in that order.
just getting more ram for a xp based system in practical terms is 512mb for good operation with 1gb for best overall.
the other upgrades depending on your wallet should be considered but can wait provided you're happy with the ram upgrade alone.
imho, that is the route i would go.
