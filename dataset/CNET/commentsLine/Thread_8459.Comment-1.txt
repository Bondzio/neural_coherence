i'm home from college with my laptop (apple powerbook) sitting in my room without any internet.
my brother, one room over, has road runner.
i am confused as to what to buy if i want to share that internet connection with him wirelessly.
do i get a router/gateway or an access point?
i'm a little confused.
should i just buy a cable modem/wireless router all in one if i am planning on moving out anyway?
any help would be appreciated.
thanks.
