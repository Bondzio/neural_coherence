my current hard drive is getting ready to fail.
is it possible to build the new hard drive (main os and so forth) using another computer and then transfer the drive over to the original.
i would then make the bad hard drive the slave to copy over data.
i would like to do this to save downtime while building the drive.
is it possible since they are different hardware?
i would be using xp pro sp2
