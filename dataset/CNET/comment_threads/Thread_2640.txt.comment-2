Just get the router and don't tell anyone it's a network.
Heck, I don't even tell some that the Internet is a network.
Ok, I lied a little.
At my home, there are 2 DSL lines.
They do that in newer tracts for the future.
You can activate both here and connect a DSL modem to each.
It runs 2X the price of one line.
And believe it or not is a network connection to the Internet.
