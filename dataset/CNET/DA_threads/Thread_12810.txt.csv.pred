1.1.1	I am thinking of ordering a AMD Phenom 9650 2.3GHz Socket AM2+ 95W Quad-Core Processor Model HD9650WCGHBOX.	St
1.1.2	Two questions, is this CPU a good one for gaming and what would be a good motherboard under 125$ that would work with this CPU?	St
1.2.1	No idea what your budget is.	St
1.2.2	If your planning on building a mid-range gaming machine you might be better served to build it around an intel I5 2000 series.	St
1.2.3	The 9650 is way down on the perf charts.	St
1.3.1	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-overclocking,3077.html http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-overclocking,3077-3.html gives you TWO CPUS for 125 or less that are far better than what you started with.	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	first off, thats actually a pretty old cpu.	St
1.4.2	second off, its hard to find a motherboard with an AM2+ socket nowadays since most of the motherboards being manufactured now are all, at least AM3 so i guess my suggestion is to try and find a cpu that's more current thats compatible to a motherboard thats, also, more up to date.	St
1.4.3	if thats not the case, the you can try looking here: http://www.eio.com/c-287-motherboards.aspx?pagesize=12&amp;expand=459 ive looked at few, but theres not whole lot of AM2+ selections out there.. better move fast on getting the motherboard before it become obsolete.	St
