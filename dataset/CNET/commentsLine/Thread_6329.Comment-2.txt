assuming that you likely have a dsl connection that possibly shares a line with one of your telephone lines, you will cut off phone and internet if you disconnect this shared line.
once you plug the phone line back in, the internet service should return to normal within minutes without intervention from you.
one thing to take into consideration is that you may want to warn users that they will temporarily lose internet and phone service while you perform this check.
p.s.
does a regular phone work at the jack where the fax plugs in to?
if a regular phone works, then your problem is probably not the phone line.
