actually i am trying to use a commercial cd, fleetwood mac/rumours to be exact.
i did go in and specifically set the drive to analog.
it was in digital so i had to change it.
is is possible there isn't sufficient output power or whatever from the cd-rom itself to drive the koss headphones?
it did work when i listened from the sound card output (but then, that wasn't what i wanted).
