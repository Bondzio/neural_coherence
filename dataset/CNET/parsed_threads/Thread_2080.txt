<s> My roommate bought a new wireless router, installed it on his desktop and it worked fine. </s>
<s> Then, when he shutdown his computer the signal cut out for the router and when the computer is turned back on the connection stays off. </s>
<s> So far the only way to get it working again is to re-install every time. </s>
<s> The router is still on, it's just everyone loses connection when the desktop turns off, and we can't figure out why. </s>
<s> He's using Windows Vista sp2 and the router is a D-Link Xtreme N Gigabit router. </s>
<s> Could you let us know how exactly the wireless router fits into your network? </s>
<s> Is it connected this way? </s>
<s> Internet -&gt; Modem -&gt; Wireless Router -&gt; Desktop Or is it configured differently? </s>
<s> Is there another router in the mix somewhere? </s>
<s> There shouldn't be any need to reinstall anything on the PC to get the wireless working for others. </s>
<s> I'm assuming that a simple reboot of the router doesn't work? </s>
<s> It's connected as you said Internet -&gt; Modem -&gt; Wireless Router -&gt; Desktop and rebooting it didn't work either. </s>
<s> Are you losing the actual wireless signal? </s>
<s> No signal strength on the laptops and does the WLAN light on the router go off? </s>
<s> If that's the case, then I'm thinking the router is faulty or possibly the NIC in your desktop is bad. </s>
<s> Test by connecting a laptop by wire to the router and turn it off as you did with the desktop. </s>
<s> If the problem reoccurs, then it's likely the router is bad. </s>
<s> If you are just losing access to your network (wireless still operates but can't access resources/internet), then it's likely some kind of configuration problem. </s>
<s> You may want to refer to the forum sticky for network setup tips. </s>
<s> It's the router that has the issue. </s>
<s> thanks for the help. </s>
