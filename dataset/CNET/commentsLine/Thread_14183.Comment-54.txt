well actually, although my first cpu was a trs-80 from radio shack, mine only came with 4k, yes, that was no typo, 4k of ram.
later, we upgraded to 16k.
the best part was having to use a monochrome monitor and tape cassette for storage.
remeber the bbs (bulletin board service), otherwise known as the internet.
it was so primitive back then.
who would have guessed it would develop into what it is today!
i think our first modem was 9kbps and all our computer games were text.
they went something like: you have entered a dark room with a door on the right.
ahead of you is a creature leering dangerously.
would you like to: a) run back the way you came b)head for the door to the right c) fight the creature.
ahhh, those days were great.
