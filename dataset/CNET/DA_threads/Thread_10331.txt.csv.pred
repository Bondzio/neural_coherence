1.1.1	I am thinking about upgrading from my 5-year old 19 & quot ; LCD monitor to something that would be better for both simple photo editing and also as my primary screen for watching DVD movies ( no jokes please ! ) .	St
1.1.2	Is there any reason why I should n't choose a 26 & quot ; or 32 & quot ; LCD television instead of a PC monitor ?	Ques
1.1.3	And would a graphics card do anything for me ?	Ques
1.1.4	I am not a PC gamer but notice that DVD scenes with motion can look choppy on my current monitor and I am not sure if it is the monitor 's fault or the PC 's built-in graphics card .	St
1.1.5	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	If your DVD watching is producing noticeable choppiness , then it could be several reasons .	St
1.2.2	It could be the video card , motherboard , CPU , or OS .	St
1.2.3	Or even a combination of these .	St
1.2.4	It might be the monitor if the refresh rate is too slow or the response speed of the monitor is too low .	St
1.2.5	Changing to a TV for a monitor would only make it worse if the system is at fault .	St
1.3.1	Inexpensive TVs wo n't have the color range or accuracy of a good 22 & quot ; or 24 & quot ; monitor ( $ 300 - $ 400 ) .	St
1.3.2	They 'll also have a lower resolution ( 1366x768 or 1280x720 vs 1680x1050 or 1920x1200 ) .	St
1.3.3	If you 'd also like to watch high def TV , consider this viewsonic with an HD tuner and high resolution : http : //www.viewsonic.com/products/lcdtv/NX2232w/ Choppy DVD playback could be due to a slow ( by current standards ) CPU .	St
1.3.4	Most new video cards offer decoding assist to help the CPU so they may help you in that respect .	St
1.4.1	This is really a no brainer a LCD is much better that a moniter .	St
1.4.2	Video card if your a gamer and like to watch movies on your computer [ I DO ] upgrade it if you can afford it .	St
1.4.3	RThe newer VC 's are so much better you wont believe your eye 's how much more detailed your games and movies will be .	St
1.4.4	One more thing get a good sound card to make the expierance a whole lot better .	St
1.4.5	I have a sound blaster X-FI high fidality extreme music with creative 5.1 surround sound and love it .	St
1.4.6	/just a thought\ tregister2	St
1.5.1	My newest upgrade - a dell 24in monitor .	St
1.5.2	powered by an asus x1900xtx video care ( 512mb ) I have an asus p5w dh mobo w/2g ram and a digiwave cable tv card .	St
1.5.3	tv never looked this good on my tube 32in .	St
1.5.4	same with dvd 's .	St
1.5.5	if you can afford the 32 lcd - go for it .	St
1.5.6	you will need a good video card that has HDMI output to get best pic .	St
1.5.7	ted	St
1.6.1	I bought this superb 'LG M228WA 22 & quot ; TFT Monitor with HD TV yesterday from Comet for 229.99 .	St
1.6.2	The idea really was just intended as an upgrade from my 19 & quot ; Acer Monitor ( which was perfectly good anyway ) , I just felt it would be nice to have a bigger screen , but in all honesty I have just spent the last 11 hours glued to this thing with no squinting problems what-so-ever , I would normally by now be rubbing my eyes after spending that length of time on any computer .	St
1.6.3	Clearly without any question of doubt in my mind 'it is an absolutely fabulous monitor , it really is an amazing piece of kit , also functioning as an HD Television .	St
1.6.4	Also very useful it has an enormous array of inputs and outputs , I can and will highly recommend this unit , it 's certainly as good as , any dedicated monitor ... FIVE STAR Rating to LG .	St
1.7.1	For both photo editing and DVD watching you want good CONTRAST & color accuracy .	St
1.7.2	For photos you probably want high resolution -- I assume your current monitor if not wide screen is probably 1280x1024 , so 720p is like a shortened version of that at 1280x720 ( or many TVs are 1366x768 ) .	St
1.7.3	You can judge for yourself how much resolution you need but also keep in mind the same resolution on a larger screen will be more pixelated ( at the same viewing distance ) .	St
1.7.4	Personally I would get a 24 & quot ; widescreen monitor , which is big enough to be good for movies in a small/medium room , and has a resolution of 1920x1200 which is like a slightly taller version of 1080p and is a pretty huge computer resolution .	St
1.7.5	If you get a TV you may be less comfortable sitting close to it for normal computer use , and unless it 's 1080p the resolution might be limiting .	St
1.7.6	As for your graphics card , it would probably be a good idea to upgrade it but I would have to know more about your system to tell if that 's what 's causing the choppiness .	St
