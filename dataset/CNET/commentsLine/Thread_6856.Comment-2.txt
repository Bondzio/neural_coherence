and given they could download junk that gets you into trouble the answer must be no.
given you'd have to replace the router or create one from a linux box, it's just not worth it to most folk and again it's back to just say no and then change the router to channel 14 (i will deny i wrote this) and then set your wifi to europe settings and they won't even see the wifi router to ask you.
