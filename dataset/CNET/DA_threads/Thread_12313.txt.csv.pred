1.2.1	The cables are specific to the monitor in question .	St
1.2.2	In other words , they 're not that generic .	St
1.2.3	You still had n't explain your problem does the monitor work ?	Ques
1.2.4	Have you tried anything yet ?	Ques
1.2.5	Is the monitor cable at the monitor side or at the video port ?	Ques
1.2.6	If not , you maybe able to return cable provide no real physical damage is done , just loose .	St
1.2.7	Otherwise , disassemble the back cover and see what 's what , again only if you 're capable .	St
1.2.8	Get back .	St

1.3.1	yes the montior does work , my son did not unscrew the video connector plug he puled it out and the who ; e thing came out of the monther board in the back or can i get another video card and install that will it work .	St
1.3.2	richard	St
1.4.1	So what you are saying is , the monitor port & quot ; where the cable plugs into & quot ; was yanked off the motherboard .	St
1.4.2	Fortunately , you can buy a graphics card or basic monitor card and put one in .	St
1.4.3	HOWEVER , I wo n't say there was n't any damage to the motherboard itself further than where the port got yanked from but if you are lucky , there is n't .	St
1.4.4	Paul	St
1.5.1	If the video port is ashew then yes you can replace it .	St
1.5.2	You will need to & quot ; disable & quot ; the build-in mtrbd .	St
1.5.3	video and install a new video card .	St
1.5.4	The new card should contain instructions for all this or at its support website .	St
1.5.5	Place electrical tape to prevent the video port from moving to possibility cause a short or whatever , just keep it from moving .	St
1.5.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
