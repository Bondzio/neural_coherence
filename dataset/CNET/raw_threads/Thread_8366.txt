I don't know if I can post links, but I was considering buying http://cgi.ebay.com/600W-Power-Supply-4-Dell-Dimension-3100-5100-E310-E510_W0QQitemZ330239908401QQcmdZViewItem that. Right now I have 250W. The couple things I'm curious about, is if that is a PSU, 'cuz it seems very cheap (or maybe I'm underestimating them), and how I would install it, when in fact it does come (if that's just something that's on the Dell Manual, those things are really hard to read). I have a Dell Dimension E310. Sorry if my question is jumbled, thank you in advance.

With a Phillips screwdriver remove the four mounting screws on the back. Remove the PS. Place the new PS in the same spot and replace the four screws. Plug in the leads, they will only go one way. Depending on the supply you may have leads left over. Done.
