<s> This one explains it a little better. </s>
<s> Its like in the old days of beta max and VHS. </s>
<s> Whose better. </s>

<s> Gee. </s>
<s> I went and read some of the chatter at the links provided earlier, and came across someone arguing that if DVD+ does not play in one's set top DVD Player (not a computer, but what most of the public uses for viewing DVD movies), then you should not switch to creating DVD- videos, but instead purchase a new DVD+ compatible set top player. </s>
<s> How more ridiculous can advice be??? </s>
<s> Yes, if you do this, YOU will be able to watch those home movies you've written to DVD+. </s>
<s> But what about your 10 relatives whom you will be sending copies to? </s>
<s> You want THEM to have to buy new DVD players in order to watch your video masterpieces? </s>
<s> Nope! </s>
<s> The best compatability and least expensive avenue is unquestionably DVD-. </s>
<s> DVD- media is less expensive. </s>
<s> More players can play DVD- than can play DVD+. </s>
<s> These are the facts of life. </s>
<s> Do your family a favor and create your videos in DVD-. </s>
<s> As for long-range benefits to be derived from DVD+? </s>
<s> Perhaps in a technical sense. </s>
<s> But by then, DVD's will be obsolete and the new media of choice will be some type of digital flash card, like one now sees in digital cameras. </s>
<s> Stick with DVD-. </s>
<s> Save yourself and your family some $$$. </s>
<s> If you personally are the geeky type and want to use the slightly better technology, then purchase a combo drive which will write to both DVD+ and DVD-. </s>
<s> But please, for those movies to be distributed, create them using DVD-. </s>
<s> If you already have a DVD drive in your Windows computer and just want to know which disk to purchase: 1. </s>
<s> Right click the START button 2. </s>
<s> Click Explore 3. </s>
<s> Find your DVD drive in the listing and Right click it 4. </s>
<s> Click Properties 5. </s>
<s> Click the Hardware tab All of your hard drives, floppies, CD, and DVD drives will be listed. </s>
<s> The name of your DVD drive should be apparent, and it will include info as to whether you have a DVD+ or DVD- drive. </s>
<s> Examples: Philips DVD+RW Pioneer DVD-RW </s>
<s> AND WHAT ABOUT PANASONIC WHICH WILL NOT, REPEAT NOT, PLAY ANY OF THE DVD+'s THAT I'VE COPIED OR CREATED ON MY PC???????????????? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Thanks for that imformation I now know what my Dvd drive is thanks again </s>
