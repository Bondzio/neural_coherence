<s> Hello Friends, I want to attach my HP Deskjet D2560 Inkjet Printer with my Dell Inspiron 1525 laptop. </s>
<s> I buy this printer from my friend and I ask him for driver CD but he don't have it. </s>
<s> Please help me... </s>
<s> You should be able to download it from www.hp.com. </s>
<s> Be sure they have the driver you need for your laptop. </s>
<s> For an older printer, it could be that there's no Vista driver. </s>
<s> In such a case, return the printer to your friend. </s>
