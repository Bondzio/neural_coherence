i bought an lcd monitor with a: dvi-d dual input ..and a vid card with a: dvi-i dual input ..and i have a dvi-i single input ------------ picture for details:  the picture shows the cable in red, the vga and lcd's complementary inputs in green and violet.
------------ now the dvi-i cable won't fit into the lcd's hub, but will fit into the vid card's.
the only thing preventing fitting to the lcd is the 4 pins (around the flat pin) you see in the photo.
would removing them manually cause any conflicts?
because the alternative choice now is to buy a dvi-d cable which has no pins around the flat thing.
what do you think?
thanks.
