i have a belkin pre-n router and it's a kicker.
yep, does real well.
it hits the next street over with no problem.
it hits about a whole lot better than the belkin wireless 54g.
neither though gets around concrete buildings.
in my situation/area, it hits around five hundred feet with a good and consistent signal.
at three hundred feet and a wooden house, the signal is about 50%.
at two hundred feet and a cb house, it dies on the other side of the house.
range and speed are great.
it gets kicked off the laptop when the wireless phone is used, so i need to get another phone.
would i buy it knowing what i do with a month under the belt?
yep.
as a note, if you are all ready running a wireless router, delete it before instaling the new one.
it'll save you lots of hassle.
