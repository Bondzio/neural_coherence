i have an old system with spyware, but i still want to use it.
you can take the memory and add it to your surrent computer (given it's the right format), you can build a totally new machine with your parts.
get a new motherboard, a new case, and use the parts in your dead emach like hdd, memory, optical drive, and before you know it, you have a brand new computer.
