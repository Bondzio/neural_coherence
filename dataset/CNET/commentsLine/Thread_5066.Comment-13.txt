i mentioned &quot;cas latency&quot; because you wanted to know why there was a price difference between two seemingly similar ram modules (sticks of memory) offered by newegg.
if you click on the links you posted and click the &quot;specificatinos&quot; tab that describes the memory product, you will see that lower cas latencies are more expensive than higher cas latencies.
the type of memory your computer takes is ddr266 (the higher the number the faster the speed).
since ddr memory is backwards compatible, you can install newer and faster ddr modules such as ddr333, ddr400, and ddr500.
the big point you need to understand is that that your motherboard determines how fast a memory module will run in your computer.
your motherboard's memory speed limit is ddr266; therefore, all those faster memory types will work but the motherboard will force them to run at ddr266 speed.
the reason crucial.com offers you ddr400 (pc3200) and ddr500 (pc4000) modules for your computer is that it's compatible with your ddr266 (pc2100) computer and they no longer carry pc2100 ram modules.
they aren't offering it to you because you will reap some speed benefit.
read this:  yes, in terms of computers, yous is rapidly aging and is many generations behind today's computers.
aging, however, doesn't mean useless.
i still use some computers older than yours.
if you want to reach 1gb (the max your computer can hold), then get something like this:  that's two 512mb modules of inexpensive ddr400 (pc3200) ram from a good company.
i made sure the specifications for the module stated 2.6v.
