<s> I have the same problem with an iPod nano connected to the USB port. </s>
<s> The message arises even if the iPod is not connected and only the cable is connected. </s>
<s> I am using Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> The port on the back is used for a printer and another port on the front is used for a Blue Tooth device. </s>
<s> They function OK. </s>
<s> When the &quot;Power Surge&quot; message appears the curser for the BlueTooth mouse is frozen. </s>
<s> Anyone familiar with this problem? </s>
<s> &quot;You can supppress the &quot;USB Surge Alert&quot; message with the following process: - Click on Windows &quot;Start&quot; Button - Go to &quot;Settings&quot; - Enter in &quot;Control Panel&quot; - Click on &quot;System&quot; - Go on &quot;Hardware&quot; panel - Run &quot;Device Manager&quot; - Open the list &quot;Universal Serial Bus Controller&quot; - Right Click on &quot;Intel(R) 82801DB.DBM USB Universal Host Controller&quot; (or equivalent, as 82801G...), and go to the &quot;Advanced Panel&quot; - Enable the option &quot;Don't tell me about USB errors&quot;. </s>
<s> - Click on OK&quot; From discussion above. </s>
<s> problem is if you have a device on the usb port, windows will disable it and tell you to reinstall the program and the device which is my case as I have a high gain antenna. </s>
<s> I have not found any solution yet. </s>
<s> Is for the record books. </s>
<s> The solution is in the long discussion. </s>
