the modem and your isp as the source of the problem, you are left with the router, cables, nic's and software issues as the possible culprits.
i would first upgrade to the latest router firmware.
if that proves futile, you may wish to engage the help of a friend's broadband and try out the router there.
what's left are software disruptions caused by the various malware residing on the pc's.
