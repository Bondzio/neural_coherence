because usually in the benchmarks you see now, the intel test systems are not optimized, while amd is, because the amd one usaully has dual channel ddr400.
in order for a system to be optimized, the cpu's fsb must match half the ddr frequency.
amd with 400mhz fsb + dual channel ddr400 = optimized intel with 800mhz fsb + dual channel ddr800 = optimized
