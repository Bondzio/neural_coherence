1.1.1	Ive been using computers for about 17 years and Ive always been far behind the times in keeping a system updated .	St
1.1.2	I recently purchased a new system from a random dealer and thought I would be happy with just average .	St
1.1.3	My problem is this , It gets old looking at the hourglass all the time more than I think I should have to .	St
1.1.4	I dont have many programs in the background and I keep my system clean daily from spyware , reg probs and other slow downs .	St
1.1.5	I know its a lousy system atm but here is what i have .	St
1.1.6	- 3200 sempron ( I know , Iknow ) - asus socket 939 motherboard - ati chpipset ( dont like nvidia ) - 1 gig 3200 400mhz ram - ultra ata 133 HD ( I cant aford 2x WD raptors on a raid 0 config lol ) - ATI x550se - pci-e ( added this ) These are the main thing i am working with here .	St
1.1.7	I dont want to drop alot fo cash on this system but I want to replace a few peices to make my daily internet and gaming use runnning smooth enough .	St
1.1.8	I play WoW so nothing that is graphically strenuous .	St
1.1.9	I like to play at mid high setting and I can raid in a high end guild quite easily .	St
1.1.10	Processor is a big concern but I just want someones knowledge as to what should really be my first priority because a higher processor with a sub par things around it is usless .	St
1.1.11	I have run several benchmarks on my system after several tweaks I have done .	St
1.1.12	I have used SiS sandra and PC Mark05 , keep cpuz and passmark 's performance test ( I get roughly a 310 score ) I know its a convoluted questiosn but I just dont want to drop money on parts that are going to make the biggest diff .	St
1.1.13	Any information anyone can provide would be awesome	St
1.2.1	man your system is a t-bone compared to my hot dog computer .	St
1.2.2	Anyways , your motherboard is a 939 socket which is nice so you can upgrade the processer , and check out the ati x800 all in one its a nice card for overall computing , and just buy an external harddrive , i have seen nice 200-300gb ex hardrives for around $ 200 dollars .	St
1.3.1	Nothing , and I mean NOTHING , will ever have a bigger impact on your system than your cpu .	St
1.3.2	Do n't waste another dime before you upgrade to an athlon 64 , preferably dual core .	St
1.4.1	ok cool thanks , ive been looking at the 3800+ X2 and they are running for a descent price right now .	Polite
1.4.2	Anyone think iI should address the HD ?	Ques
1.5.1	Just a guess but the price is right .	St
1.5.2	http : //www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx The gist of this is dma might fib .	St
1.5.3	If dma shows off then turn it on , exit out and test .	St
1.5.4	If dma shows on , turn it off , exit out , go back and turn dma on , exit out and test .	St
1.5.5	Some folks have a whole bunch of unnecessary tasks and processes running in the background ... dead weight .	St
1.5.6	I 'm not an XP user but I suspect if you were to search around in the forums for how to shutdown unnecessary task/processes you might get some hints .	St
