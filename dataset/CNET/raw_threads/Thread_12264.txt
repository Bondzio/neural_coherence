Attempting to convert an mpg file to avi in order to burn it to dvd....get an error message I've never seen before and haven't got a clue about what it wants me to do. Can anybody help? Error message: Connect video stream to Tee Filter It's a file on my harddrive and not being streamed via the pc so I'm clueless. Attempting to just burn it straight as mpg to dvd isn't working, and I have all the correct codecs installed as far as I know. TONI
