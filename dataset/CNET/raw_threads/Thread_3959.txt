The box of the CPU shows the CPU as Intel PD 940 3.2GHZ OEM. However my WINXP system info (settings/Control panel/system) shows Intel(R) Pentium(R) D CPU 3.2GHZ 1.60GHZ 1.93 GB of RAM Physical Address Extension Is this correct? Is my CPU running at 1.6GHz or 3.2GHz? If I am only running my CPU at half speed, what can I do to change it?

After I click it, control panel/systems now show 3.2 GHz. I guess it was set at a lower rate when it first installed and started up. This may be the &quot;normal default&quot; of the BIOS.
