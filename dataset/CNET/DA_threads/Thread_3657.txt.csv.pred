1.1.1	ok well i know on the microsoft website it says you have to have 1GHZ Processor and 1GHZ of ram to run vista but i am wondering if you could have lower processor like a pentium 3 or 4 if it is possible to run vista and 512MB or 192MB of ram to run vista Home Basic.	St
1.1.2	anyways if anyone knows anything please say all will be appreciate thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Just get the Home Basic, it's well worth the try.	St
1.3.1	is broken on a modern fast machine.	St
1.3.2	Holler back when you can't get it to work.	St
1.3.3	Your description will not run Vista.	St
1.3.4	Just wondering, noting all the complaints, why you are interested in installing it?	St
1.3.5	Have a look at the Vista forum before you waste your money.	St
1.3.6	Please.	St
1.4.1	I agree with you.	Res
1.4.2	Don't upgrade to Windows Vista for at least 6 months, until you can get the drivers and software compatable with Vista for your peripherals.	St
1.4.3	I have a HP scanner that I am now told the drivers won't be released until the end of July at the earliest.	St
1.4.4	Mine is a newer scanner and they are going to start releasing the drivers from new to old so the older scanners and printers may get the Vista compatable drivers some time next year at the rate they are going.	St
1.4.5	And yes you do need at least a 1 gig processor and 1 gig of ram.	St
1.4.6	My computer has a 2.20 gig duel core processor and 2 gig of ram and runs fine, but is using 48% of ram just setting there running Vista.	St
1.4.7	My neighbor has a 1.6 gig celeron processor and 1 gig of ram and it runs terrible.	St
1.4.8	I like Vista very much, but if I had it to do over I would wait.	St
1.5.1	anyways after many searchings over this fact my computer (s) were slow so i went out and now i got myself a new Compaq Presario SR2180NX with Intel Viiv Technology Dual Core 2.7 Each Processor.	St
1.5.2	1GB OF ram.	St
1.5.3	runs really well with vista thanks a lot to all that helped thanks ciao	Polite
