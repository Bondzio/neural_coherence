1.1.1	i have installed an internal dvd rw drive externally using an ide-usb2 adaptor into my pcs' usb1.1 socket.	St
1.1.2	I get a message saying it wont work due to an I/O problem.Will this be cured by replacing my usb1.1 card with usb2.0	St
1.2.1	My thought on this is..if you have a usb 2 device then by all mean get an usb 2 adapter card.	St
1.2.2	If the usb card can't handle the power that is require by the device then you will also need a hub with external supply also (I think that maybe your problem right now; just guessing).	St
1.3.1	The data rate of USB 1.1 is too low for DVD recording.	St
1.3.2	Let's attempt a DVD write at about 600 kbps?	St
1.3.3	That's about 4 hours.	St
1.3.4	A CD-R at 4x is some 700 MB that at top speed completes in about 25 minutes.	St
1.3.5	I actually see 30 minutes.	St
1.3.6	So at USB 1.1 and 4,700 MB to a DVD that would be 4,700 / 700 or 3.3 hours.	St
1.3.7	And this is if all went well... You'll want an USB 2.0 card since for a PCI card it's the cheap solution.	St
1.3.8	Here's one I used -&gt; http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=A-6202-4 Be sure to read more at http://www.usbman.com about USB 2.0 on the OS in question.	St
