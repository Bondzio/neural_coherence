I installed a piece of 512MB DDR3200 400MHZ but it will not start. It boots and flashes the bios part where it recognizes the CPU but at that instant it shuts itself down. I removed the piece of memory and of course it will not boot but it does not however shut itself down (it remains on). I thought it could be a piece of bad memory but I grabbed a 512MB DDR2700 which supposedly it's supported by this MoBo but yet it does the same thing: it shuts itself down after displaying the kind of CPU it has. Could it be a wrong set jumper of some sort. I memory form ULTRA and they say it's 100% compatible. Could it be the CAS latency of this memory? the MoBo manual says it does not support other than 2.5 CAS latency. What should I try next? Thanks guys

CL [CAS] 2 will run at 2.5 if the mobo only supports 2.5 Not sure that the shuts down/not shuts down is a clue. AMD CPU's don't shut themselves down, the mobo detects the overheat signal from the CPU and shuts down. I do not think that the mobo shut down function can work without memory. I would worry that your CPU is getting too hot too fast and explore that entire area before powering up again. Of course I could be totally wrong, even incorrect. LOL

Also check that heat sink fan is pluged into the correct port. Also look at capactors for leakage or crowning. Ray System only appears to be running w/o memory. You will see the fans running and if speaker is attached a beep code will be heard. M/B, most models, will detect CPU over heat and shut down the system. Bill

Two different versions [1 and 2] of Soyo mobos and one PC Chips [three of them] simply do not beep. They do have the pins on the mobo for a speaker, the &quot;normal 4 pins. Some give the signal name for three of them, one of which is Vcc. All of the cases I am using only provide a little cylindrical gadget [assume that it is a speaker] with the two outer pins wired. Have tried moving one of the outer pins to the third slot, still never get a beep. Have no idea what a third wire for a speaker is for. [BTW, also have tried speakers removed from older cases].

Some boards do have speakers attached permanently to themself, haven't seen one that could be moved. Model and make of board? Bill

All that I have seen, and have here only have two wires, the other pins empty. BUT some have the wires on pins 1 and 3, others on pins 1 and 4.[that's why I move one of the pins to try both configurations. These mobo manuals give designations to 3 of the 4 pins, one being Vcc. Makes zero sense to me. BTW I know that the little cylinder is a speaker because I heard one work in some devicw some time ago. The manuals for these mobos make no mention of beeps or beep codes, and I really miss that beep at startup. LOL [also get no beeps for error configutations ie no video] BTW, the &quot;speaker comes with the case, not with the mobo. sounds as if the mfrs may not be talking to each other. I had a question for Soyo and they responded in two daysm well written. I guess that I'll have to ask them. I made a prior post about that subject. Hope that you Floridians are finished getting attacked by nature for a while.
