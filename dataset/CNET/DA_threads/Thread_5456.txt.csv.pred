1.1.1	Are you considering a Blu-ray disc burner for your computer?	St
1.1.2	-- Yes.	St
1.1.3	(Please explain.)	St
1.1.4	-- No, the write speed is still way too slow.	St
1.1.5	(Please explain.)	St
1.1.6	-- No, not until Blu-ray recordable discs come down in price.	St
1.1.7	(Please explain.)	St
1.1.8	-- No, not until it becomes a standard.	St
1.1.9	(Please explain.)	St
1.1.10	-- I'm already using a Blu-ray burner.	St
1.1.11	(How do you like it?)	St
1.1.12	-- Undecided.	St
1.1.13	(What's holding you back?)	St
1.2.1	I really see no benefit of getting one for the time being.	St
1.2.2	Its not a run out and gotta have it sorta thing.	St
1.2.3	Sure, it may provide more storage but even that is offset by cost and plain DVD will do fine for now, IMHO.	St
1.2.4	adios -----Willy	St
1.3.1	I do have a BluRay burner in my PC.	St
1.3.2	I got an LG HD-DVD reader/BluRay reader/burner for my Home Theater PC but I don't use the drive for backup.	St
1.3.3	I have an HDMI out on the PC so it can be used to watch any DVD I own, BluRay, HD-DVD or standard DVD.	St
1.3.4	I got 1 BD-RE with the drive and a few on ebay for a good price.	St
1.3.5	We'll see where the drives go from here, maybe I'll get a faster one later(they are really slow burners currently).	St
1.4.1	As of this post over half the respondents selected, &quot;No, not until it becomes a standard.&quot; Am I missing something?	St
1.4.2	The HDDVD vs Blu-ray war is over, and Blu-ray won.	St
1.4.3	The prices of players are on their way down due to a deflationary economy.	St
1.4.4	Contrary to some opinion Blu-ray players gained in popularity this winter.	St
1.4.5	I think the high price of blank Blu-ray disks remains a hindrance for many to accept Blu-ray as a &quot;standard.&quot; If you choose to go for it, look for one that can play the AVCHD format.	St
1.4.6	It's a consumer choice, but I believe this format will hit our markets very soon.	St
1.5.1	We all will.	St
1.5.2	Of course, the price MUST come down, and the speed of recording (and rerecording) must increase greatly.	St
1.5.3	Why will we all go Blu-Ray?	St
1.5.4	Because it holds more data.	St
1.5.5	The 800 pound gorilla, however, (FLASH MEMORY) may well make even the blu-ray obsolete, perhaps before it even has a chance to become established.	St
1.5.6	One thing is certain, BLU-RAY will be replaced by something.	St
1.5.7	I am betting on flash memory, which I suspect will also replace the hard drive before long.	St
1.6.1	I can back up my PC onto 3 blank DVD-R disc's currently using backup software which also compresses data.	St
1.6.2	But even if I needed 25 gb worth of storage, (5) blank DVD-R discs cost around $1.25 now, less than a quarter each.	St
1.6.3	The burners are about $20 including shipping, less than one blank blu-ray disc costs.	St
1.6.4	So until the price of the blank media drops tremendously, I can't see paying another $200 for the burner all for a little convenience.	St
1.6.5	I can live with changing blank dvd discs during a backup or restore at these prices.	St
1.6.6	And with 22x speed of dvd blank media, it's probably faster than using one big blu-ray disc at 2x burn speed, right?	St
1.7.1	...I have only a few vices and indulgences.	St
1.7.2	Foremost among the few is finding the latest bell or whistle I can afford to stuff into my computers.	St
1.7.3	I survived when SyQuest drives went by the wayside, so if Blu-Ray standards shift around, I'll cope.	St
1.7.4	Besides, computing has always been mercurial and that's part of the fun -- eventually we all get to play the crusty old timer, boring kids with our tales of the Bernoulli Box and the Osborne 1.	St
1.8.1	my DVD burner's work just fine for what I do and the cost is way too high in Australia.	St
1.8.2	So for now I will just stick with my 2 DVD burners.	St
1.9.1	1) If I were in the video production industry then I would definitely get it.	St
1.9.2	2) The cost to benefit ratio over my DVD-R is not even close especially here in South Korea, where things cost 30% to 50% more for these things.	St
1.10.1	and the price is still too high.	St
1.11.1	Well there are quite a few issues to be sorted out, atleast in India: It is definitely not the standard yet.	St
1.11.2	If it is for just backing up my data, I would definitely prefer an external Hard Drive, Easy, Cheaper, Faster...	St
1.11.3	The Blank Blu Rays are next to impossible to find!	St
1.11.4	They are very expensive... Of course I would love to watch movies and listen to music in the latest PCM 7.1 Audio.	St
1.11.5	So the answer is a no.no.	St
1.11.6	for data purposes and YES for Media, but as and when it is available freely, covering all titles especially my choice and taste...	St
1.12.1	The concept of physical media is dead.	St
1.12.2	Blu-Ray is the last bastion of a former era.	St
1.12.3	Going forward the idea that you will put media on a physical disk just won't make sense.	St
1.12.4	Electronic transfer and solid state storage along with cheap on demand access means there is no need.	St
1.12.5	Only a few years ago I would use a cd/dvdrom cake every few months.	St
1.12.6	Now I can't remember when I last burned a disk.	St
1.12.7	All my media is stored on external portable drives or my iPod.	St
1.12.8	Eventually these will be replaced by solid state then by universal wifi access for use on the move.	St
1.13.1	Hey everyone, I am in the process of ordering some blu-ray burner drives for data aquisition PC's at work.	St
1.13.2	We're always backing up 40+GB of data from the system and storing them on DVD.	St
1.13.3	Blu-rays will make that a million times easier!	St
1.14.1	I see no compelling reason to consider a Blu-ray burner, particularly considering the format incompatability with most other common devices.	St
1.15.1	I am almost certainly going to include a Blu-Ray burner in my next computer, which I anticipate obtaining sometime in the fall after the release of Windows 7.	St
1.15.2	I intend to build the new machine from scratch with the highest-end components including an Intel i7 960 (if I were buying it now -- there might be something better available by the third quarter and if so that's what I'll get) and monstrous heaping gobs of fast, fast, fast DDR3 RAM.	St
1.15.3	I am also going to get two 1.5TB drives.	St
1.15.4	And it's these big drives that make me want the BD burner.	St
1.15.5	I presume by then that drives will available that will be able to burn multiple layers, and at 25 GB per layer there is actually hope that maybe, just maybe, I could start to back up annually or so to removable media again -- once they get the price of the media under control.	St
1.15.6	Of course, at today's outlandish prices, it would be MUCH cheaper to buy a few external drives and use them as backup media.	St
1.15.7	But still... A Blu-Ray burner, a really fast fiber-optic internet connection, and good old Usenet might a way to build a nifty HD movie collection were I the nefarious type to ignore copyright laws.	St
1.15.8	Heaven forfend!	St
1.16.1	I had to make a decision about bluray a few years ago when purchasing the home theater set up.	St
1.16.2	Had a great sales rep from Myer Emco who told me a up-converting DVD player would make regular CDs play at a higher level.	St
1.16.3	Got a Denon up-converter and have not been sorry.	St
1.16.4	I don't want to make the mistake I did in the Beta vs VHS wars of years ago.	St
1.16.5	Jon	St
1.17.1	For less than the cost of a blu-ray player I bought the burner for my computer.	St
1.17.2	Since my computer is also a source for my home theater, it does give me the function of a blu-ray player plus the ability to test the other functions.	St
1.17.3	In spite of the costs, blu-ray rw discs are the best method I have found for backing up my photos and audio on a durable media.	St
1.17.4	Try reading that external hard drive after dropping it.	St
1.17.5	For burning DVD's (yes DVD's are still my standard), I have had some compatibility issues with discs burned on the LG unit.	St
1.17.6	I continue to use my Lite-On drive as my standard DVD burner as I rarely get a bad burn from it.	St
1.18.1	When I bought my DVD burners I expected to use them for backup as well.	St
1.18.2	But now I look at a few terabytes' worth of external hard drives instead.	St
1.18.3	It is ironic: To back up my first hard drive (32MB) I needed about 70-80 diskettes of 360kB each - that was a lot of disk-jockeying.	St
1.18.4	Today, to back up a a modest 300 GB drive I need - you guessed it - roughly the same number of DVDs.	St
1.18.5	Somehow I am not winning here - and by the time the BluRay disks are commercially viable the common hard disk size to back up will be a few terabytes, so I would be right back where I started.	St
1.18.6	And in the long run I may well find that my DVDs don't last any longer than my diskettes did.	St
1.18.7	I haven't tried 360kB diskettes in a very long time, but occasionally I find me using a 1.44MB one and I usually need to try about 4-5 of them before I find one that works across all of its sectors.	St
1.18.8	In contrast, hard drives that are kept off and offline for most of their lives seem to age much more slowly.	St
1.18.9	Or so I hope ...	St
1.19.1	What's the purpose?	St
1.19.2	I guess I could watch a 2 hour movie in my computer chair, not gonna happen.	St
1.19.3	I won't buy one for my computer until I can stream it to my XBOX or Apple TV or TiVo or something.	St
1.19.4	I see no point.	St
1.19.5	I already have an external HDD for backups.	St
1.19.6	It's cheaper and I can rewrite / reformat as often as I want.	St
1.19.7	If I could stream it to my TV in some way, then maybe.	St
1.19.8	But wouldn't it just be easier to buy a BD player for my living room?	St
1.20.1	Hard drives are becoming amazingly cheap and digital distribution is the new way.	St
1.20.2	Why bother backing your files up on disk when you can just buy a huge hard drive?	Sug
1.20.3	1TB drives are only like a hundred bucks now, and Blu Ray discs are still like ten dollars each.	St
1.20.4	The choice is pretty clear.	St
1.20.5	And, with flash media becoming ever cheaper, blu ray is rapidly loosing any advantages it may have had.	St
1.21.1	From my experience in Australia blu ray is only offered as an additional option [or when I purchased my computer about a year ago it was ]with the disc price and the associated charges of instalation and purchase it is prohibative for me at least.I will stay with my existing system which is faster and costs far less to use.	St
1.22.1	I have to go agree with the above poster.	St
1.22.2	And standards are not what they used to be a &quot;standard&quot; used to last for many years, now with the huge oneupmanship going on between the companies, they do not.I have taken the stance that I am going to skip every other &quot;standard&quot; it saves me money and if enough people follow my lead then companies wont be so quick to crush each other in the market place.	St
1.22.3	That being said I will be the first on board when media starts keeping up (or close to it) with hard drives.	St
1.23.1	If I were producing movies, I would, as that is where the industry is headed.	St
1.23.2	As a back-up, It just isn't cost effective.	St
1.23.3	DVDs are only a buck, and within a year (or 2, at most) spinning media will be just another legacy technology that everyone wants to get away from.	St
1.23.4	Plus, (and this is big for me) blue-ray players and blank media are not expensive because the technology is new and hasn't paid for itself yet, they are expensive because the 'wow factor' is still there for enough people that have to be the first to have the best and are willing to bend over and do what it takes to impress their 'friends'.	St
1.23.5	Blue-ray players and disks are too similar to CDs and DVDs to warrant such high prices.	St
1.23.6	This is simply gouging.	St
1.24.1	NIL	St
1.25.1	But only because I have a specific need to archive database projects.	St
1.25.2	A 25GB BD-R is able to house 100GB+ of data with compression and two copies are only costing me $15.	St
1.25.3	Well worth the price to free up the diskspace for additional projects.	St
1.26.1	I need a good one for my blackbird.	St
1.26.2	Unfortunately, one make does this really well, another does other stuff well.	St
1.26.3	I`m waiting for something with all the features I need as well as price.	St
1.27.1	Funnily enough, I just ordered a BR/HD-DVD reader online before coming here.	St
1.27.2	As for a burner, it's just overkill for what I do.	St
1.27.3	I have a CD burner that gets TONS of use.	St
1.27.4	I think I've put over 1000 blanks through that thing.	St
1.27.5	And when DVD burners became affordable, I got one of them, too, thinking it would be used just as much.	St
1.27.6	WRONG; I haven't even gone through my 50 stack of blank DVDs, and I'm still burning CDs like crazy.	St
1.27.7	I think that all those gigabytes of space must intimidate me, or something.	St
1.27.8	So when I think about getting a BR burner, I wonder to myself, &quot;What's the point?	St
1.27.9	I'll probably use it less than the DVD burner I have now.&quot; Especially since the burners are still, for me, prohibitively expensive.	St
1.27.10	I found one on clearance because our Circuit City was going out of business; it was 200 dollars.	St
1.27.11	The plain old reader I got online was 105 dollars (both were LG).	St
1.27.12	To me, the extra 95 dollars isn't worth it for something I don't even know if I will use.	St
1.28.1	As of now Blu-Ray has become a standard for some dvd media via TV.	St
1.28.2	How ever for computers Blu-Ray is still non-existent as there is poorly software and the drives themselves are not really too good.	St
1.28.3	Then aside from that buying a blu-ray drive most of the time does not come with software, you have to purchase it.	St
1.28.4	It is not a standard, Blu-Ray is still, in 2013, on the fence from being a 'Standard' all around.	St
1.28.5	So Blu-Ray 'IS NOT' standard as of yet.	St
1.28.6	Plus most media via tv still use regular DVD over Blu-ray, even in 2013 buddy.	St
1.28.7	Your post was from 2009 and it wasn't even close to standard than either.	St
1.28.8	We are closer to making it a standard but it is not.	St
