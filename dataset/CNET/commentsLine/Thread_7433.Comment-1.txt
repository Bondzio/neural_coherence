hello, i just replaced a customer's faulty cable to bring back their cd-rw and dvdrom drive.
the dvd rom drive functionality is in question.
windows sees this as a cd-rom drive.
nowhere have i run into any dvd rom driver info for this seemingly generic device.
i tried the aida and sandra utilities, and both cannot id the manufacturer, and every description of the device is simply &quot;dvdrom 1 0x&quot;.
wondering if anyone has encountered the same situation and can lend any expertise as to this drive's true identity.
happy weekend jay
