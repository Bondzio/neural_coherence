just got back and had some time to review.
here's what i've come up with so far.
cpu: amd athlon 64 x2 $210 -as per suggestion.
motherboard: asus m2n32-sli deluxe $140 -made a decision and picked this one instead of the crossfire.
ram: ddr2-800 pc2-6400 2x1 gig (a-data $28x2= $56) and 2x512 mb (wintec $20x2= $40).
-as per suggestion.
hard-drive: western digital wd1600ys 160gb 7200 rpm sata 3.0 gb/s, 16mb cache.
$60.
-still not wanting space as much as speed.
i wanted something with higher rpm, but i wasn't sure if sata 150 was compatible with the motherboard, so i went for this.
video-card: geforce 8800 gtx video card, pcie, sli.
$500.
-as per suggestion.
and if i have the need, i can always get another.
cd/dvd drive: lite-on dvd-rom dh-16d2s-04.
$18.
-as per suggestion.
case: lian li pc-g70b atx full tower.
$200 -as per suggestion.
psu: coolmax ctg-850 atx 12v 850w.
$230 -i tried to find one under the manufacturers that was recommended, but they didn't have anything on newegg.com that was near the wattage i wanted.
i think this one has all the cables i'll need, but i'll research it more later on.
total: $1454.
let me know what you think.
