1.1.1	Hi, I want to add a USB Printer and USB Hard Drive (or two) to my wireless network.	St
1.1.2	I currently have a 2wire 2701HG-G ADSL modem/router.	St
1.1.3	The only device I've seen that allows for multiple USB devices is the Airport Extreme.	St
1.1.4	I'm thinking of connecting my USB printer and 2 hard drives via a USB hub to an Air Extreme.	St
1.1.5	The Air Extreme would then connect to the 2701HG-G via 802.11G.	St
1.1.6	- Will this set-up work?	St
1.1.7	- Have I missed any other devices that will add muliple USB devices on an 802.11 network?	St
1.2.1	Given the speed or lack of speed in copying files many spend time, money only to go back to connecting those drives to their machines.	St
1.2.2	Have you done the math to compute copying your files over?	St
1.2.3	Will you be upset at some file that took seconds to copy now taking 20 to 30 minutes?	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
