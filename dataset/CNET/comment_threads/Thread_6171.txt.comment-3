I agree with Robert, bundled s/w isn't a given to work on other drives, but you can try.
Now, maybe a good time to try a &quot;retail&quot; versions and understand they offer alot more than when you got your older s/w.
The most notable are Roxio and Nero.
I lean towards Nero, but you can check your CD/RW burner support website they may provide an OEM for your use.
If you like a very cheap retail version(older), try this website: http://www.pcliquidators.com/ and look for CD Creator v3.x, I believe under s/w area.
good luck -----Willy
