1.1.2	I want to combine them to send them as a single document by email attachment ( it 's a brochure with 8 pages ) .	St
1.1.3	The HP Photo & Imaging software program I downloaded on my computer does n't seem to allow me initially to scan all the documents into a single file nor allow me to combine them later .	St
1.1.4	I 've also tried playing with the attach files command of my Hotmail account to combine them there , without success .	St
1.1.5	I 've read all the documentation and used the help function to no avail .	St
1.1.6	Does anyone know how that can be done ?	Ques
1.1.7	Many thanks if you can help .	Polite
1.2.1	The easiest way would probably be to open each image in an editor ( Photoshop , Paint , etc ) and copy the image , then paste it into a Word document .	St
1.2.2	Just paste all the image in , then blow each up so that there is one per page .	St
1.2.3	Hope this helps , John	St
