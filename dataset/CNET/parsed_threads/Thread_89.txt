<s> I recently changed my 4 years old iMac (obviously with MacOS in it) with a Toshiba laptop with Windows 7. </s>
<s> I own a Lacie external hard disk which I used before with the iMac: now that I have a Windows computer it doesn't recognize it anymore. </s>
<s> I can hear the sound of the USB connection port but other than that nothing appears. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> Clearly it's an issue from Mac to Win but how do I solve it? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> Your post did not tell what file system you selected on the Apple nor did it write if files needed saving. </s>
<s> To start over and format this drive I head to Disk Management (click start, type same) and remove the old partitions, create new ones and format the volume. </s>
<s> All levels of expertise arrive here so I can't know if you know the basics of Windows, so hope this helps, Bob </s>
