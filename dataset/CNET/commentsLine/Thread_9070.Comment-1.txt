hi unfortunately i have this problem with my brand new seagate 160gb sata drive but i've runned some benchmarks(freshdiagnose) with this score: write 8mb\s , read 480mb\s .
its a bit frustating seeing this slow write speed compared to the too(?)
high reading speed... i have the newest drivers(intel ultra/sata storage controllers) and the whole computer is just 1month old.
i've runned the seatool and it took 4hours to complete with the result of failure of the extended test but it didnt say why... so it work properly but slow.
i checked the main ide channel it is in ultradma5 mode.
i have two partitions on it (135-15)but i dint thin so this make the problems... how can i make it work on proper speed like 40-50mb/s?
i took year to copy my olda data to this drive so i dont want to foramt it again.
specs: drive - seagate barracuda 7200 (st3160811as) windows xp pro s2 1gb ram intel pentium 945d 3.4ghz motherboard : msi 945pl
