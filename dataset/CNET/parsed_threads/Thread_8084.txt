<s> Hi there everyone, this is my first post, so bear with me if I mess up (I'm sure many of you have heard that plenty of times before lol...) Anyways, I'm planning on building a new computer, and I want to get a Nvidia GeForce 9800 GTX graphics card. </s>
<s> I know it's a two slot card, and I know that I only need 1 PCI-Express 2.0 slot to use it, but I don't know whether or not there needs to be a second PCI slot next to it for it to rest on. </s>
<s> If it does, will the motherboard I'm getting work? </s>
<s> I want to get an Asus P5QL-EM Intel G43 Socket 775 Motherboard (from TigerDirect.com). </s>
<s> If you need any more info, just ask. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> You are right that it only needs one pci 2.0 express slot to use. </s>
<s> ABut you dont neccessarily need any slot for the second space it takes up. </s>
<s> While it doesn't need a second pci slot, it does at least need space available to be in. </s>
<s> So it doesn't need the second slot, but it will still take up all the space in that second slot making it so you can't use it for anything else. </s>
