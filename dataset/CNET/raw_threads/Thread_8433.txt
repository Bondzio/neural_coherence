(In order) 6600, (High spec card!) 6200 OR (Mid range run most games well) 5200 (Low range I have one, runs Doom 3, HL2 and Halo sluggish still nice card!) You need to tell us more on your compter specs ...

Do not think these boxes handle heat well. I will check the current supply, but I think it is 350W. Is the performance between the current GeForce2 and the 6600 significant? Thanks All!!! (My sons are the gamers, not I).
10407	6	106294	1216926	1215568	ozos	5/30/05 8:44 PM	1.11748584E12	um, quick Q	what CPU and how much RAM does this machine have? the reason I ask is the gamer statment the 6600 vs the GF2 MX is about a 10x performance increase aside from that, the issue is CPU whilea 6600 can handle Half-Life 2 like no1's business, a slow CPU probably cant (3 years means it, at best, would be around 3GHZ) but i'm just wondering what CPU you have, and what ammunt of RAM you have and the ammount of hard drive space is also something to think about if your system has a sub 2GHZ chip, with under 512MB of RAM, and a 40GB or lesser hard drive, considering an new system might not be so unrealistic (and for a new system, i'd suggest you build it yourself to save money)
10407	7	106294	1220260	1216926	outcast	6/1/05 4:59 PM	1.11764514E12	sub processor	at 1.7 GHz, 512 RAM, 40 GB and perhaps even worse the supply (I now think) is 250W. My son wants to build soon, but we were checking to see what could be done in the meantime.
10407	8	106294	1220465	1220260	ozos	6/1/05 7:31 PM	1.11765426E12	meaning you got a Pentium 4...	or an older Athlon but i'm gonna say Pentium 4, as their far more common i'd suggest just building now as it's a Willamette P4 or an AthlonXP on the Palomino or T-bred A core either way, it's going to be slower than a dog in most modern games I feel the lack of power in my AthlonXP 3200+ whenever I run any modern game (HL2 and 3DMark05 feel it most, Doom III is fine) or stress an FPS, it can handle it, but it'll hiccup and my chip is equivalent to a 2.8E you have a 1.7 i'm not trying to bash it, i'm just trying to put things into perspective, i'd say instead of sinking any money into that box just build a new one
10407	9	106294	1222139	1220465	outcast	6/2/05 8:08 PM	1.11774288E12	agreed	no sense using the $ for the existing PC when it could be better used to build the new. Thanks!
