i see this and crucial noting you can installl 2 (two) 512mb sticks for a total of 1gb.
this is no offer to detail why 1gb sticks show up as 1/4 or 1/2 size.
they should and do.
-&gt; but about the stick order.
that would take a too long discussion about chip selects and circuit design.
it's a common issue and why we stick with supported sticks on the list.
