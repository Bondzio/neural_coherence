<s> Dont buy ink from overstock! </s>
<s> I bought my very first generic ink cartridge from overstock.com, and I never got around to using it until half a year later, and I found out then that it doesnt even work! </s>
<s> And I contacted their live support, and they said they would have someone get back to me, but no one ever got back to me to help fix the cartridge, and then I did the live chat support again, and they terminated the chat, they said they couldn't do anything past the 20 days policy. </s>
<s> Terrible experience and a waste of money! </s>
<s> I personally feel that generic ink is a bad idea from anyone, but I would not expect them to do anything about a 6 month old item that probably carried a 90 day warranty at best. </s>
<s> Six months later and you expect support? </s>
<s> I've used Overstoc.com for years; bought DVD/VCRs, laptops, desktops, etc. </s>
<s> But I wouldn't even think about buying generic ink from anyone. </s>
<s> Don't be stingy on ink, buy what the printer is supposed to use. </s>
<s> Well im sure no one buys ink cartridges and tests them right away, and ink is a ripe off, 30 bucks for a hp cartridge, would u buy ink and test it right away? </s>
<s> I buy the Universal (brand) ink refill kits from Walmart. </s>
<s> They are the best combination of price and quality I've found, allowing me to refill my HP cartridges ~6 times for under $15. </s>
<s> Of course you have to trick the printer into thinking it's using a new cartridge (HP and most others use methods that deter refilling their cartridges despite the fact it's perfectly legal), but that's not much of a problem at all. </s>
<s> Just a suggestion. </s>

<s> Thanks John, Ill b sure to check that out at walmart(brick and mortar or online? </s>
<s> ), and what hp cartridges do you use and what do you mean by trick the printer? </s>
<s> I never checked to see if it can be ordered online...I just stop by the local store and pick it up. </s>
<s> As to the type, my main printer is an HP Photosmart 7450, which uses the 56, 57, and 58 cartridges. </s>
<s> However, I've done this on a few others as well. </s>
<s> ------------------------------------------------------- What I meant was that HP and the others don't like it when you refill the cartridges yourself because they lose money. </s>
<s> After all, they barely make a profit on the printers themselves...most of the proceeds come from the ink and paper. </s>
<s> So what they's done is make it difficult to refill your own. </s>
<s> First, each cartridge has an expiration data...after the data has passed it will cease to function, even if there is ink remaining. </s>
<s> Next up, the printer has built-in memory and stores the serial number of the last 3 cartridges you used, along with the 'predicted' ink level. </s>
<s> This is based on the length of the documents/pictures you've printed and the average coverage area per sheet. </s>
<s> Thus it could report ink remaining when it's bone dry, or say you're empty when you're not. </s>
<s> That's a nice little problem with the 'ink level notification technology,' but something they fail to accept. </s>
<s> Now, if the printer remembers the cartridge and that it was empty, it will refuse to print, reporting an empty cartridge, even though you just refilled it. </s>
<s> (Remember, it doesn't check the actual ink level.) </s>
<s> Thus, you have to fool it into thinking it's a new ink cartridge. </s>
<s> Right now the cartridge is in slot #1 in the printer's memory. </s>
<s> Remove it, place a piece of tape over the top contact of one of the two 'points' and pop it back in. </s>
<s> This 'new' cartridge fills in slot #1, pushing the 'real' cartridge to slot #2. </s>
<s> Now repeat covering the other top contact. </s>
<s> 'Real' moves to #3. </s>
<s> Remove the pieces of tape and pop it back in. </s>
<s> The 'real' (untaped) cartridge now moves back into slot #1, and it's old entry in slot #3 is pushed into non-existence. </s>
<s> (It would be moved to slot #4, but there is no slot #4.) </s>
<s> The printer now recognizes the cartridge as new (no previous record of it in memory), and assumes it's full. </s>
<s> At this time you can successfully print with the cartridge. </s>
<s> You could actually try printing after placing the first piece of tape on, but one contact is being covered up, so the print may be faulty. </s>
<s> That's why you must go through the process 3 times over. </s>
<s> It sounds lengthy, but is quite easy, and understanding the logic in unnecessary...just trust me, it works. </s>
<s> Using that method I am able to successfully refill each cartridge 4-5 times before either the expiration date is reached or the cartridge goes south. </s>
<s> At that time I buy a new cartridge. </s>
<s> (I get a new HP because I don't trust those from third-parties...bad experiences.) </s>
<s> Overall I only have to buy 1 in every 6 cartridges I would have gone through, meaning I spend about $35 instead of over $120...not bad at all for a few minutes of work. </s>
<s> ------------------------------------------------------- Now, there are a couple of notes I'd like to make: * The Universal brand ink is the best I've come across at a reasonable price, and it fairly close to HP's. </s>
<s> However, it's not guaranteed to last 100+ years, so for photo printing, don't skimp. </s>
<s> * Refilling the cartridges is fine and will not invalidate you printer's warranty. </s>
<s> However, it does invalidate the cartridge's warranty. </s>
<s> In addition, HP is not responsible for any damage caused by a refilled or third-party cartridge's use. </s>
<s> The only real risk, though, is it leaking, which just makes a mess. </s>
<s> * It's wise to leave the cartridge sit out overnight on a piece of plastic to make sure it doesn't leak before reinstalling t. You should also print out a couple of pages for the quality to be restored. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, and enjoy! </s>
