<s> There are thousands of folk with this issue so my question is why your suppliers have left you out on the road with a dead car and no gas? </s>
<s> As you can tell it's rarely the same thing and the advice repeats often. </s>
<s> That is, start with less parts and never skimp on the PSU if you can't add up the Amperes and know why you get a single rail when you can't add it up. </s>

<s> I agree with Robert's post, something is amiss and you have tear it down and get to the basics. </s>
<s> Recheck your work and that means tearing it down out of case. </s>
<s> Using cardboard, rebuild the system on it and make that a &quot;MINIMUM SYSTEM&quot; just what it needs to boot. </s>
<s> In fact you need no drives at all, see what it does upon applying power, it should at least get to the error display or try entering a bios display. </s>
<s> In other words, its up and running but can't go far but remains, &quot;ON&quot;. </s>
<s> Don't take anything for granted and don't be in a rush to build, check and verify it all. </s>
