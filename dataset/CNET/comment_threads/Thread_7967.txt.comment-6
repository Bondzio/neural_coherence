&quot;Besides the frequent disconnection (even though the laptop is few inches away)&quot; You have failed hardware, or incompatible hardware or out of date firmware or drivers.
Fix that first.
My brand new Dlink right out of the box did that.
I don't think it was funny that I had to update the firmware on a just opened unit, but this is the state of affairs.
-&gt; You have not written that you updated firmware, drivers or changed to other make/model devices.
