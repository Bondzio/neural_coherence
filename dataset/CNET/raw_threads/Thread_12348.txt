I'm sure many of you have had a black screen and curser blinking top left to the screen. I tried my F-keys and so on to no avail. All I want to do is go for a clean reinstall 98 from my cd. Can anyone please walk me through the process. Your help is appreciated. I head maybe booting up from CD drive in the Bios? Not sure. Thanks Christian

In 98 most will use a 98 boot floppy, fdisk/format and install from their cd. Some have a bootable 98 cd, in which case the boot order of the Bios needs to reflect that choice of media.
