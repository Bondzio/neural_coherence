<s> I have got a new 4gb flash drive. </s>
<s> When I insert it into my laptop it automatically display AutoPlay diaolg. </s>
<s> However, when I plug it into my desktop PC it doesnt display automatically, so i have to use 'my computer' to navigate my way to it and open the files. </s>
<s> This is a bit of a nuisance, is there any way I can re-instate this action on my desktop PC? </s>
<s> Strangely, if I insert another flash drive it opens up on both computers as normal! </s>
<s> Has anyone any ideas as to why? </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> I am discover that flash drives with FAT32 don't have AutoPlay on my desktop PC, FAT work fine, NTFS i am not tried. </s>
<s> That's only the beginning of troubleshooting autoplay issues but given so little information (I won't be asking) let's note the usual cure all. </s>

<s> I have Windows XP which is new and clean and my PC has USB 1.1 standard. </s>
<s> I have discovered that when i plug in flash which is under FAT file system, on my monitor AUTOPPLAY dialog shows and then i can choose action. </s>
<s> When i plug in this USB, with 4 GB memory, which is under FAT32 system, this dialog does not appear, so i must go to MY COMPUTER and then i can go to USB.When i put one USB FLASH, which belongs to my friend, which is under NTFS, the dialog box automatically appears? </s>
<s> What is the problem? </s>
<s> Is the file system in some connection with running FLASh? </s>
<s> Can i use FLASH under NTSF? </s>
