<s> If you are getting a message then some thing is talking to you. </s>
<s> No signal feed HMMM have you changed anything In the last day or so??? </s>
<s> What operating system XP?? </s>
<s> Can you access the bios? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Need more info of the message and your system. </s>
<s> If old system, replace the cmos battery and then enter bios and reset values for setting and save upon exit. </s>
<s> Reboot and recheck again, if OK proceed with boot and hopefully that solves your problem. </s>
