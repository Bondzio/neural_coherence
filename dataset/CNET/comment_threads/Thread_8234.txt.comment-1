I have been told that a hard drive is most likely to crash within a few weeks of purchase.
I recently bought an external hard drive, and backed up all of my files to it.
I plan to reformat my computer.
How long should I wait before doing so?
I assume that the hard drive should not be sitting in the box while I wait.
Is it enough to plug it into my computer, or should I regularly move files in and out of it?
