1.1.1	I 'm a student looking to buy a netbook , but I 'm torn between the Asus Eee PC 1005HA and a few others .	St
1.1.2	What do you guys think would be the best netbook ?	Ques
1.1.3	Here are my specifications : ( 1 ) excellent battery life ( I mean , over 8 hours ) ( 2 ) under $ 400 ( 3 ) 10 inch screen ( 4 ) able to use wordprocessing program and 2-3 internet tabs at a time ( 5 ) preferably white , but that 's not a biggie at all .	St
1.1.4	I can deal with other netbooks if they fit my other requirements .	St
1.1.5	So , what do you recommend ?	Ques
1.1.6	Also , I 'm loving the upcoming Asus Eee T91 because of the touch screen , swivel screen , and overall look .	St
1.1.7	But the price is a little on the steep side , plus the battery does n't last more than five hours .	St
1.1.8	Should I just wait for a more updated model to come out ?	Ques
1.1.9	When do you think that will be ?	Ques
1.2.1	Is that & quot ; real hours & quot ; or some spec , test ?	Ques
1.2.2	Here I get about half those hours on all machines .	St
1.2.3	Why ?	Ques
1.2.4	Because we use the machine .	St
1.2.5	So can you share if that 10 hour netbook comes in at 5 hours will you be upset ?	Ques
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	I understand that what the manufacturer states as the battery life is not the real deal .	St
1.3.2	But at the very least , the netbook should last at LEAST 6 hours while being used as an e-reader ( which will probably be my primary use ) or for note taking .	St
1.4.1	The batteries are only 300 cycle units so that in one year the battery will need replacement .	St
1.4.2	This is not hearsay , conjecture but reality and real world testing .	St
1.4.3	The E-READER is very close to what we use the machines for .	St
1.4.4	While it is a presentation either with Adobe Reader or PowerPoint we get 1/2 to less the hours that you see from the maker and reviews .	St
1.4.5	Look for 12 hour units like the Nokia Booklet 3G .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	The Nokia Booklet 3G has n't been released yet , so I 'm not sure how great it will be .	St
1.5.2	Also , the estimated price is well above my budget at app .	St
1.5.3	$ 600 .	St
1.6.1	Are you sure it must work 6 hours continuously without taking a break ?	Ques
1.6.2	The time I 'm noting is for continuous use .	St
1.6.3	No breaks that would let the display or CPU nap .	St
1.6.4	Also why not the real thing ?	Ques
1.6.5	That Kindle display is absolutely readable .	St
1.6.6	Have you seen it ?	Ques
1.6.7	Bob	St
1.7.1	Sorry , I 've been so unclear !	St
1.7.2	I never meant 6 hours without a break .	St
1.7.3	I would use the netbook uniquely for each class .	St
1.7.4	Meaning , in one class I would use it as an e-reader for about 1.25 hours .	St
1.7.5	And then perhaps an hour break , and on to my next class , where I would use it to take notes for another 1.25 hours .	St
1.7.6	Then , another half hour break .	St
1.7.7	And so on .	St
1.7.8	I just would n't want my netbook to die out on me on a day where my classes last from 8 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon .	St
1.7.9	I 'd also like to check my email every now and then , so Kindle 's a no-no for me .	St
1.8.1	The Acer Aspire One with 7.5 hours battery is hovering at 310 bucks on amazon with free shipping .	St
1.8.2	I own the 6 hour unit and while it is not a laptop it is what we use for presentations and when we need something small to run out the door with .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	I bought an asus 1000h refurb off ebay and am very happy with it .	St
1.9.2	It is rated at 4 to 7 hours and you will get max life if you turn off the radios ( bluetooth and wifi ) unless needed and you can use the function buttons on the keyboard in windows to do that .	St
1.9.3	On a flight from maui to missouri ( 3 legs ) I was able to watch 2 1.5hr movies with the screen brightness turned down as much as possible and still had over 50 % battery left .	St
1.9.4	I was using vlc media player and watching 700MB xvid videos .	St
1.9.5	So with being a little frugal you can go all day , also another 3 cell battery is n't heavy or too expensive if needed .	St
1.10.1	I ran across one of the new 11+ inch Acer netbooks NEW on amazon.com with 11 hour battery .	St
1.10.2	Why would I bother with Ebay ?	Ques
1.11.1	I do n't see an eleven hour acer netbook , just the 8hr .	St
1.11.2	but amazon has an 11 hr asus for 409.00 .	St
1.11.3	Of course things change so fast ( daily ) it 's hard to keep up .	St
1.12.1	As the models change so fast I ca n't keep them all lined up .	St
1.13.1	... why you would recommend the Acer over the Asus 1005HA ?	Ques
1.13.2	As far as what CNET is telling me , the battery life of the Asus exceeds that of the Acer .	St
1.14.1	That 's why .	St
1.14.2	Having dealt with both company service centers I ca n't give any nod to the Asus today .	St
1.14.3	Also , go get reviews on battery TIME .	Sug
1.14.4	Battery LIFE is equal at 300 cycles .	St
1.15.1	I have two Samsung NC-10 netbooks , one for myself and one for my wife , along with three other Fujitsu standard notebooks .	St
1.15.2	The Samsungs have become our main use machines .	St
1.15.3	They will last for +/- 5-6 hours with the 6 cell battery .	St
1.15.4	This of course , includes utilizing power saving features enabled and tweaked for reasonable power conservation , and not having your screen up over the 2nd from the dimmest setting , which I find more than acceptable .	St
1.15.5	In fact the brightest setting is TOO bright for my preferences .	St
1.15.6	There are also aftermarket 9 cell batteries available ( +/- $ 65 . )	St
1.15.7	which may give you an additional 1.5 - 2 hours or so when it 's time to replace the original .	St
1.15.8	If you set it up to go into Standby when you close the lid between uses , you should have NO problem achieving your time/usage goal of +/- 5-6 hours , and will probably have power to speare .	St
1.15.9	Samsung has several updates to this original machine , including the nc-12 , the nc-20 and others .	St
1.15.10	They run from about $ 340 .	St
1.15.11	- $ 500 .	St
1.15.12	on Amazon , last time I checked .	St
1.15.13	I did upgrade the ram in both from the original 1 gb to 2 gb at an addtional $ 23 .	St
1.15.14	( ? ) .	Ques
1.15.15	I would n't trade my Samsung netbook for ANYTHING !	St
1.16.1	Hi !	St
1.16.2	Try looking at the hp mini 311 or the toshiba nb 200 and the nokia booklet 3g .	St
1.16.3	they are the somehow very cheap and very nice and very portable to bring .	St
1.16.4	it is very handy and somehow also wifi available .	St
1.16.5	but i 'm not very much with the battery life but these netbookse are one of the best .	St
1.16.6	also msi wind netbook	St
1.17.1	Hi , I think the hardware is no problem , just care the price .	St
1.17.2	there is a laptop accessory for your reference when you need it .	St
