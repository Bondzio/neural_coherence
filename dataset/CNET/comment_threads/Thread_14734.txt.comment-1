Last night I was using my cousin's network and suddenly the connection showed no Internet access but connected.
But my iPhone and iPad is connected to the network and still able to access Internet,I tried to shut down and restart my laptop, and also turn off my wireless, even remove the record of the network and re-entry again, but still no Internet access.
And now my laptop is sometimes connected with limited access, sometimes connected with no Internet access, and sometimes disconnected the network and keep trying to join the network again.
Could anyone solve this situation for me, I dun wanna ask my cousin to turn off the router, many thanks.
