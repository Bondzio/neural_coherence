<s> Hello, I am wanting to upgrade my video card from a nVidia 8300 GS 128 MB to a card that is good enough to play Half-Life 2 Episode 2 and above. </s>
<s> Left4Dead2 Demo did not play that well either. </s>
<s> I have a 300 watt power supply, and some claim that the Radeon 4650 , and 4670 will work? </s>
<s> I have had others claim that I need to get a (uhm.. crappy) 8500 GT nVidia ? </s>
<s> Then there are others that say I need to upgrade my power supply before I even think about getting any upgrades? </s>
<s> Any more ideas? </s>
<s> And it was too much for a 350 Watt supply so without doubt your card will not be happy with 300. </s>

<s> Should I try to get a nVidia 9400 GT? </s>
<s> nVidia's &quot;help me select&quot; said it was able to be used in a 300 watt. </s>
<s> I have the 9500 GT in PCI form and total Watts (I use a Watt meter) for the entire machine tops out at 120 WATTS. </s>
<s> I know that sounds confusing since some may hit the wrong button and read 120VAC but I know the diff. </s>
<s> The 9400 is not a screamer but the 8400 PCI card in a machine that had no PSU upgrade is running fine. </s>
