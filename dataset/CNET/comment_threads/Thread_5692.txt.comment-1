I am in the market for purchasing a new computer.
I am deciding between a desktop which is upgradable or a laptop which is portable.
Now I am a home user however I want to be able to multi-task and be able to play the latest games.
I was considering building a PC but I dont want to bother buying parts and what not.
Can Someone Give me Some Ideas?
