My understanding, although I don't claim to be an expert, is that while many &quot;home&quot; printers do a very nice job printing photos on glossy or matte photo paper... the ink isn't the same as photo processing ink and eventually your home printed photos will fade.
Which is to say the pictures will fade faster than if you had them professionally processed.
Having said that, back up your home photos on CDs, make your glossy prints, and if you have to print them again in 5 or 10 years, so be it.
In my humble opinion the ability to crop and adjust the photos is such a big plus it outweighs any issue of permanence.
My HP Officejet 5510 all-in-one does terrific photos.
I wish the cost of ink cartridges were lower, but such is life.
