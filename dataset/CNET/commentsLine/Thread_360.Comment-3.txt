i did forget to list a psu.
this is the one i was suggested by a friend but i don't know much about.. well any parts; pc power and cooling silencer mk iii 600w  as for the wifi, with my current laptop setup i get a consistent 1.6mb/s download speed from my bedroom.
problem is to go wired, i would have to tunnel a wire from my basement all the way into my bedroom by my desk, so unfortunately i'm stuck with the wifi
