1.1.1	I 've currently got a Dell Inspiron 9300 .	St
1.1.2	It 's a great computer and all , but the 80GB hard drive is quickly filling up .	St
1.1.3	Dell set up a partition that alone takes up 10GB , and I 've got Windows and Linux running so I 've partitioned Linux for another 10 .	St
1.1.4	My question is , are external hard drives capable of properly running programs such as games , at the speed of my regular hard drive ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks in advance .	St
1.1.6	Scottie .	St
1.2.1	While you can install such to said drives , gamers usually hate the speed loss .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	When you say gamers hate the speed loss , are you talking about online games and laggyness , or just games in general , single and multiplayer would run slower ?	Ques
1.4.1	The effects will vary game by game , but the time for a game to load will increase as well the levels .	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the info Bob .	St
1.5.2	As long as it 's just loading times that will slow down I 'm not too concerned .	St
1.5.3	Now I 've got another question .	St
1.5.4	You would n't happen to know of any reliable external hard drive brands would you ?	Ques
1.5.5	I 'm looking for something around 120-160GB .	St
1.5.6	Thanks Scottie	St
1.6.1	Ordered cases and drives and put them together ourselves .	St
1.6.2	Since we pick out cases that look like they do n't overheat , we get about as reliable as the drive you stick into the case .	St
