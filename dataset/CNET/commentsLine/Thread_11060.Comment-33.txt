when i installed wins 7 32 bit on the release date, all my peripherals worked correctly.
on 4/10/10, i upgraded to the 64 bit version of win 7. so far everthing is working with no hitches.
this includes my 10 year old scanner.
either all the driver updates were included with win 7 or my automatic driver updates ran.
