I get the ratings screen, and then just the circle spinning around as though it's buffering. My connection is fine and it runs Netflix great, this is the only app giving me problems. HBO has no troubleshooting info on this. Can anyone help? P.S. yes i have an HBO account and am signed in when this happens. It also runs on my xbox and pc just fine.

In other words the tablet maker's work is done once the app launches so now it's up to HBO's support. You see this issue on BD players too so it appears that HBO, Netflix and others have work to do. Why do you think it's yours to fix? Bob
