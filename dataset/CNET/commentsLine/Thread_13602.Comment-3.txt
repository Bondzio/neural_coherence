you could always try doing a live-usb linux boot, go in the partition settings and check your 80gb hard drive.
you can still see your hard drive of 80gb in your partition.. it just won't be mounted.
i doubt you'll need help doing that (live-usb) but if you do i suggest debian live... that's where i do my partition work.
&quot;unetbootin&quot; is a very useful program to push .iso images to your usb to make it bootable.
p.s.
at my old school, when we had those &quot;os not found&quot; errors.. we had to refresh the ram by taking the sticks out then putting it back in.. sometimes it would work.
so... make sure your ram is properly connected and the hinges are properly securing it so it's not shaky.
hope that helped.
