1.1.1	This scanner is driving me nuts ! !	St
1.1.2	I am hooking it up to a relatives computer running Win XP Home .	St
1.1.3	It worked perfectly when they had Win 98SE .	St
1.1.4	I am getting an error message saying to unlock the scanner .	St
1.1.5	There is no physical lock on the thing .	St
1.1.6	I went to Visioneer 's website and they talk about this error message saying that the scanner can not calibrate and that is the default message the driver gives .	St
1.1.7	They suggest updating the driver .	Sug
1.1.8	I did that , and I still have the same message .	St
1.1.9	I even tried to install it in my laptop and I received the same message .	St
1.1.10	Per their website the scanner is compatible with xp .	St
1.1.11	I am at my wits end .	St
1.1.12	Since the scanner is over a year old there is no free support for it now per their site .	St
1.1.13	Has anyone experienced this and gotten anywhere ?	Ques
1.1.14	I would appreciate your help .	Polite
1.1.15	Thanks !	St
1.1.16	!	St
1.2.1	The new drivers ( you did download and install the new drivers ? )	Ques
1.2.2	may work differently and as such you now get to try the scanner on Windows 98 .	St
1.2.3	This is an annoyance to some that some devices do n't work in XP .	St
1.2.4	In closing , the XP install could be incomplete .	St
1.2.5	Many are unaware that Microsoft does not install motherboard , USB and many other drivers for them .	St
1.2.6	The OS installer ( you ? )	Ques
1.2.7	gets to do that .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have to say , what you wrote confused me .	St
1.3.2	lol .	St
1.3.3	Yes , I did reinstall the driver I had downloaded from their site and it still did n't work .	St
1.3.4	What is also confusing is that the same thing has happen on both machines with windows xp .	St
1.3.5	I 'm wondering if the thing is n't compatible with xp as the state .	St
1.4.1	That 's why I noted a test on the 98 box is needed to be sure .	St
1.4.2	I read your reply and see you did load the scanner drivers , but nothing about the motherboard drivers , USB drivers and if a parallel port connected scanner , if you tried the other modes in the BIOS .	St
1.4.3	And nothing about the BIOS being latest since this can be an issue for XP & quot ; upgrades. & quot ; In short , it 's not as simple as it would appear to be .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Hi , I do n't have the 98se anymore because it is now win xp home so I am out of luck testing it on that .	St
1.5.2	Also , the bios is the latest version on both of the computers that I have tried to use it on .	St
1.5.3	I checked the setup and usb is enabled for both computers also .	St
1.5.4	It does not have a parallel connection on the scanner .	St
1.5.5	I 'm not sure what you mean about the motherboard drivers , As for usb drivers , I have hooked other usb things up and they work correctly .	St
1.5.6	I also agree with you , it is n't as simple as it seems : (	St
1.6.1	I 've dropped hints that there issues around USB , but without knowing the MAKE AND MODEL of your machine , I ca n't tell if requires an USB filter driver , SP1 from Microsoft or any trick as noted by USBMAN .	St
1.6.2	Just because one thing works , does n't mean that another will without error .	St
1.6.3	And the lack of a 98 test machine means that the possibility that the scanner is simply broken is still there .	St
1.6.4	I 'd love to see you succeed , but such information can be vital to find out if the OS is installed completely since Microsoft does n't do it for you .	St
1.6.5	Here 's an example tricks about USB on Via based boards .	St
1.6.6	I 'd supply yours , but you have n't revealed the make/model/chipset .	St
1.6.7	http : //www.usbman.com/Guides/VIA % 20Tips % 20and % 20Tricks.htm	St
1.7.1	The chipset for the computer is CA810 and the maker of the motherboard is Intel .	St
1.7.2	It does have SP1 already and all patchs/updates on Windows Update .	St
1.7.3	I 'm sorry if it appears that I 'm a complete moron when it comes to this scanner issue but I have never run into a problem like this before .	St
1.8.1	1 .	St
1.8.2	USBMAN noted an Intel download for XP !	St
1.8.3	& quot ; INF Update Utility [ INFINST.EXE ] ( 1428KB ) 5.1.1.1002 12/12/2003 Download This utility installs INF files that inform the operating system how to properly configure the chipset for specific functionality such as USB and AGP. & quot ; That 's DECEMBER 12 , 2003 .	St
1.8.4	VERY FRESH STUFF you wo n't have on your XP CD .	St
1.8.5	Just 4 clicks from this GOOGLE - & gt ; http : //www.google.com/search ? & q=usbman+intel+810 I land at http : //support.intel.com/support/chipsets/sb/CS-009247.htm 2 .	St
1.8.6	While that 's very interesting to me about the motherboard drivers are still being updated by Intel , the other issue is that Scanner 's drivers and APPLICATIONS .	St
1.8.7	http : //www.visioneer.com/products/flatbed/5800usb/ shows a DRIVERS link , but a note read & quot ; Technical Support Tip : It is important to properly remove any previous versions before installing this driver. & quot ; I do n't remember you doing this step .	St
1.8.8	Remember NEVER PLUG IN ANY USB before the instructions tell you .	St
1.8.9	The results are long discussions ... Bob	St
1.9.1	I downloaded the inf file and when I ran it my system told me I did n't need it .	St
1.9.2	I also downloaded a usb patch from the usb site and that did n't work .	St
1.9.3	I followed the instructions to the T on visioneers web site and I still can not get the stupid thing to work .	St
1.9.4	I think I am going to end up ripping the thing apart and just make sure there is nothing jammed in there .	St
1.9.5	I appreciate your help on this .	Polite
1.10.1	But we knew that .	St
1.10.2	Best of luck !	St
1.11.1	I also have the Visioneer 5800 scanner .	St
1.11.2	I too attempted to install on Win XP Home machine .	St
1.11.3	It would not work properly .	St
1.11.4	I often got the same & quot ; unlock scanner & quot ; message .	St
1.11.5	I later upgraded to Win XP Professional and the scanner installed and works great .	St
1.11.6	I also installed the latest version of driver software from Visioneer .	St
1.11.7	I know this is n't a solution , but I can certainly sympathize .	St
1.12.1	I do n't see me ever buying a product from the company again .	St
1.12.2	Their tech support is no support at all .	St
1.12.3	The scanner is about 2 years old and already they do n't want to support it .	St
1.12.4	If you want to talk to someone with a & quot ; non supported scanner & quot ; they want you to call a 1-900 number .	St
1.12.5	Hello mcfly , catch a clue and invest some of that money into real tech support .	St
1.12.6	Thanks for the support on this issue .	St
1.12.7	I 'm not done messing around with the scanner just yet .	St
1.12.8	Vacation awaits so that has to wait , Vegas here I come !	St
1.12.9	! .	St
1.13.1	When I read such ... With all due respect and not to rattle you too much , scanners used to run over 1,000 dollars and you would get nice people on the phone and free shipping to have it fixed .	St
1.13.2	Today you get a few years from a 50 to some number dollar unit and nothing more than a web site .	St
1.13.3	Some do n't consider this progress ... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Take 2 .	St
1.13.4	You would be writing the same story with any other maker .	St
1.13.5	There is n't any product made now that at 2 years you can get the support you want at a price you 'll be happy with .	St
1.13.6	This is the way of things for the PC .	St
1.13.7	Imagine how torqued people will be in one year as 64-bit PCs become the norm ?	Ques
1.13.8	Bob PS .	St
1.13.9	I really do feel for you , but consider that I do n't want to go back to thousand dollar scanners .	St
1.14.1	That is a good point .	Polite
1.14.2	The price tag for technology has come down alot the past few years .	St
1.14.3	You would think that a company would give better support no matter how cheap they can make their product .	St
1.14.4	If you do n't have any support for the product , the customer base eventually will become non-existant and then where are they ?	Ques
1.14.5	Out of business .	St
1.15.1	With such cheap items , the support vanishes to lower that initial purchase price to levels that it costs more to ship a balky unit than it is to buy a new one .	St
1.15.2	Your plight/complaint would be with all scanner makers ( which is my point here ... ) And you can extend this to that 10-20 dollar CDRW drive .	St
1.15.3	It busts in 2 years , what will one do ?	Ques
1.15.4	Bob	St
1.16.1	Sorry to butt in at this late date .	St
1.16.2	Anyway , here goes .	St
1.16.3	Have same final problem , ca n't get past & quot ; unlock scanner & quot ; .	St
1.16.4	For what it 's worth , this scanner worked fine for over 2 years on this computer with ME .	St
1.16.5	( Gateway laptop ) I had to reformat hard drive still using ME , and now it sounds like your problem .	St
1.16.6	I tried origional installation disk and then latest drivers .	St
1.16.7	I really want to say that I had this problem once before , but then would have to admit to old age memory loss as I ca n't remember what resolved it .	St
1.16.8	Have you had any luck yet ?	Ques
1.16.9	Richard Than	St
1.17.1	I could n't get mine to work and I let it sit around for a while .	Sug
1.17.2	When I lookeded at it again to see if I could get it to work it kept on giving me the same message .	St
1.17.3	Then I found the bulb was burnt out .	St
1.17.4	Time for a new scanner .	St
1.18.1	Hi there - same problem here , no luck finding any info .	St
1.18.2	online from my end either .	St
1.18.3	Please post a solution if you get one ! !	Sug
1.18.4	Thanks , Jenifer	St
1.19.1	Hi there - just saw a post on another site that mentioned to check and make sure you are using the correct power supply , I had just plugged in another power supply but I guess it has to be the original that reads the following Bestec or you will get the error lock message .	St
1.19.2	Anyway , I found the original power supply and now the scanner is working again .	St
1.19.3	Good luck !	Polite
1.20.1	the Visioneer 5800 usb has a factory defect and Visioneer refuses to replace the unit .	St
1.20.2	It can not be used without unlocking from the bottom , yet this scanner does n't have a lock ... it even says so on their website , they do n't offer a fix , but will be happy to give a 25 % discount on a new one .	St
1.20.3	BAD BUSINESS ... do n't buy from Visioneer !	St
1.21.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7590-0.html ? forumID=67 & threadID=12971 & messageID=638745 notes a power supply issue .	St
1.21.2	Are you ranting or looking for a cure ?	Ques
1.21.3	Bob	St
1.22.1	Thanks Jenifer !	St
1.22.2	I have been having this same problem for months now .	St
1.22.3	I tried uninstalling both scanner and software , installing new drivers , pretty much all of the advice posted here earlier on .	St
1.22.4	I tried plugging in a ne poer supply out of desperation ( after seeing your post ) and poof !	St
1.22.5	Works like new , or rather like it used to .	St
1.22.6	The power supply looks to be a UHI Power Adapter.Thanks ! !	St
1.22.7	!	St
1.23.1	This scanner has issues with XP , completely separate from the unlock issue folks are apparently seeing .	St
1.23.2	I picked this up and it worked fine for months on XP Pro .	St
1.23.3	I also religiously patched my machine .	St
1.23.4	Eventually , the PC started crashing .	St
1.23.5	No blue screen , no error message , just the BIOS screen and rebooting for no apparent reason .	Sug
1.23.6	I thought I had a hardware issue .	St
1.23.7	I then formatted the hard disk and rebuilt the XP installation from scratch .	St
1.23.8	The machine worked perfectly .	St
1.23.9	Until I installed the scanner .	St
1.23.10	It then began getting CPU spikes to 100 % and other odd behavior .	St
1.23.11	Removed the scanner and driver , and everything was fine again .	St
1.23.12	( This was all prior to XP SP2 . )	St
1.23.13	The USB on the PC is fine with two different digital cameras and with a USB mouse .	St
1.23.14	My conclusion : The scanner worked with XP at the time the drivers were written .	St
1.23.15	A Microsoft patch after that conflicts badly and unpredictably with the driver .	St
1.23.16	No updated drivers from Visioneer .	St
1.23.17	It 's now a paperweight .	St
1.23.18	doctorcisco	St
1.24.1	I installed the scanner on Win 98 and it worked..but quit and now tells me to unlock the scanner .	St
1.24.2	Installed it on laptop WinXP ... same message ... have decided to buy a new one but it wo n't be anything from these guys ... no support .	St
1.24.3	If you find a way to make it work , let me know .	St
1.25.1	Jennifer I am experiencing the same problem , have u received any answers ?	Ques
1.25.2	I have deleted the software and reloaded to no avail .	St
1.25.3	It seems to be a hardware problem .	St
1.26.1	Let me add my two cents .	St
1.26.2	I 'm pretty sophisticated about computers and periphery and my children and grandchildren rely on my assistance .	St
1.26.3	My daughter bought three Compaq Prosario computers for herself and children ( my grandchildren ) .	St
1.26.4	The computers came with as a package with Visioneer5800 scanners and XP home installed .	St
1.26.5	All worked fine until the warranty period ran out ( of course ) .	St
1.26.6	Then we started getting the message ''unlock scanner '' .	St
1.26.7	At one point , I got one of the scanners to work by moving it to another machine .	St
1.26.8	That worked for about a month , then the error re-appeared .	St
1.26.9	I then uninstalled , deleted , cleaned the registry , etc. -- everything the Visioneer website insisted on -- downloaded and reinstalled the drivers .	St
1.26.10	Worked fine .	Polite
1.26.11	FOR ONE DAY .	St
1.26.12	Then stopped .	St
1.26.13	Called the 900 number for tech support , paid them the lousy $ 4 a minute for support .	St
1.26.14	After 5 minutes , was told it was a hardware problem .	St
1.26.15	All three scanners !	St
1.26.16	Hung up the phone in disgust ( I did n't believe them , but what could I do ?	Ques
1.26.17	) , went out and bought an Epson scanner for my grandchilden , and it works fine .	St
1.26.18	From the discussion , a couple of ideas occur : ( 1 ) as they age , the voltage output of the power units might be dropping .	St
1.26.19	New power units might work .	St
1.26.20	( 2 ) Somehow , one of the Microsoft updates is conflicting with the Visioneer drivers and Visioneer wo n't fix the drivers .	St
1.26.21	I would appreciate hearing if anyone else ever figures our the solution .	Polite
1.26.22	I would hook up the old Visioneer scanner to one of the grandchildren 's computers -- I would use it if I could fix it , but would not buy another product from this compnay .	St
1.27.1	They wo n't fix it since the devices : a .	St
1.27.2	Generate no income ( except for those phone calls . )	Res
1.27.3	b .	St
1.27.4	The devices have reached the end of their service life .	St
1.27.5	Everyone wants them to last 10 years .	St
1.27.6	Here 's an analogy .	St
1.27.7	Let 's say you buy an add-on for your car .	St
1.27.8	A few years pass and then you replace the car .	Sug
1.27.9	The device now fails .	St
1.27.10	Does anyone fix it for free now ?	Ques
1.27.11	This is what we ask for when we want the drivers fixed for the newer OS .	St
1.27.12	Drivers are not cheap and the code monkeys demand to be fed and paid .	St
1.27.13	If you wo n't feed or pay the code monkeys , you wo n't get your drivers .	St
1.27.14	Unless you run Linux , but that 's another system .	St
1.27.15	Bob	St
1.28.1	I do n't find the analogy with the automobile very persuasive .	St
1.28.2	Automobiles do last 10 years or more , and the manufacturers supply replacement parts for even longer .	St
1.28.3	When an automobile breaks down , you can repair it -- you do not need to junk it .	St
1.28.4	Visioneer abandoned this product after only one year or two .	St
1.28.5	Nor is the fact that support is & quot ; free & quot ; a justification .	St
1.28.6	I was willing to pay for the fix ( provided it did n't cost more than replacing the whole damn thing ) , paid for a telephone call , and still was brushed off .	St
1.28.7	Moreover , everyone knows that operating systems are constantly being upgraded and patched and buysrs have a reasonable expectation that the company selling you a peripheral will provide updated drivers during the life of the hardware ( within reason ) .	St
1.28.8	Visioneer misled all of us purchasers when it reneged on this implied ( but very real ) representation .	St
1.28.9	( Any class action litigators listening ? ? )	Ques
1.28.10	This is a company that has no interest in establishing customer loyalty , and it certainly wo n't have mine .	St
1.28.11	Why in the the world would I buy something from a company that wo n't update drivers the day after I buy the hardware ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.28.12	While I 'm posting this message , let me add to my prior description of the problem : 1 ) first , we acquired the scanners from E-Machines ( now a Gateway subsidiary ) , not Compaq ; 2 ) I tried to install two of the scanners on a ''clean '' machine running ME .	St
1.28.13	Same problem .	St
1.28.14	So it is n't a question of something corrupting the drivers after they are installed .	St
1.29.1	The auto analogy works fine .	St
1.29.2	The consumers did n't want to pay for drivers so how to pay the code monkeys ?	Ques
1.29.3	Bob	St
1.30.1	Where can I find the correct power supply for a visioneer one touch 7100 scanner ?	Ques
1.31.1	Same problem here & everything had been working fine for over a year .	St
1.31.2	Yep updated the drivers , then uninstalled everything paperpaort etc .	St
1.31.3	re-installed then updated drivers then connected the scanner which is still locked ! !	St
1.31.4	YOUR NOT ALONE ! ! !	St
1.31.5	GOOD LUCK .	St
1.32.1	I have not upgraded anything except security updates from MS and now I am hearing that one party upgraded and the other did not and I am without a product that worked fine .	St
1.32.2	Yes it was cheap but I will certainly think twice before giving anymore dollars to visioneer .	St
1.32.3	Interestingly enough their website states that the 5800 will now carry the MS logo ! !	St
1.32.4	If it works do n't fix it !	St
1.32.5	More non-biodegradable waste , that sucks .	St
1.33.1	I had the same problem , then i put the darn thing away.I lost the power supply , so i talk to a friend who told me.To run 12 volt output , but i was concerned about the amp.should be 1.2 i believe.But i just found one at the thrift shop that was 12volt op.I believe the amps were like 1000ml.amp , works fine i run xp sp2.Its beyond me .	St
1.33.2	David	St
1.34.1	I have read read all the messages regarding the named scanner .	Polite
1.34.2	So out of coursity I did some testing on the exact same scanner that I have .	St
1.34.3	I tested it on Win 98 , Win 98Se , Win 2000 , and also win xp .	St
1.34.4	It seemed to work perfect with the exception of Win 98 .	St
1.34.5	Which does not support the USB of that particular scanner .	St
1.34.6	Which the computer that I have the original 98 on seems you can only hook up HP scanners to .	St
1.34.7	I do n't know if this is of any help .	St
1.34.8	Other than it seems that on the Win98 SE computer the scanner does work , however it has issues with some of the software .	St
1.34.9	So what I did was installed the software that came with the HP Scanner .	St
1.34.10	Then it worked great .	St
1.34.11	I do n't know if this is of any help .	St
1.35.1	WHAT IS THIS ABOUT A LOCK ?	Ques
1.36.1	I 've been reading your comments .	St
1.36.2	I have the same problem .	St
1.36.3	Worked great on Win98se .	Polite
1.36.4	Totally sucks on XP .	St
1.36.5	I still have a laptop with Win98se on it and when I connect it to that it works just like it had good sense .	St
1.36.6	This uses a TWAIN driver .	St
1.36.7	How much difference is there between Win 98se and WinXP concerning TWAIN drivers ?	Ques
1.36.8	Any way the scanner is not broken .	St
1.36.9	It just wo n't run on XP .	St
1.36.10	Well that 's my take on it anyway .	St
1.37.1	As soon as you plug the power supply up to this scanner the bulb lights .	St
1.37.2	That 's the only thing that works .	St
1.37.3	Having a burned out bulb would be quite obvious to me .	St
1.37.4	How about you all !	St
1.38.1	Just read some of the forums .	St
1.38.2	I replaced the power supply with one which has 2A .	St
1.38.3	That is more than enough current but it 's all I had .	St
1.38.4	Anyway , it fixed the & quot ; Unlock & quot ; problem .	St
1.38.5	Hope this helps .	St
