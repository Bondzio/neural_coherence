1.1.1	I'm hoping to get advice on what the best/fastest cable modem/router device is?	St
1.1.2	I currently have a motorola surfboard sbg6580.	St
1.1.3	It works good, but it interferes with my direct tv so I can't use it and need to find another....	St
1.1.4	So, what is the best???	St
1.1.5	Price doesn't matter.	St
1.1.6	I just want the best one.	St
1.1.7	thanks!	St
1.2.1	Not sure why this or any other would interfere.	St
1.2.2	Is there more to this story?	St
1.3.1	I have no clue, neither does Directv, but they are the ones that told me I can't use this modem with their service.	St
1.3.2	So is there any other modem/router combo unit that is better?	St
1.4.1	I have to guess at this point you are dropping the cable internet service so with that out of the way, your new service will determine what modem is required.	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
