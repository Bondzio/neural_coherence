thank you for the reply and for the good advice and link!
i had never thought about a linux based pc.
i am pretty clueless about other operating systems.
my brother is a programmer and is always complaining about windows (heard he is not the only one).
my only concern is if i can use photoshop on a linux based system?
i bought cs2 some time ago and have been using other versions of photoshop for almost 10 years.
i am really familiar with it.
looking at the site freebsd ports you gave me, am i correct in assuming there is a way to run photoshop?
i did a word search and it came up with gimpshop (love the name!)
regarding the actual spec.
do you have any comments or advice?
