I have been recently using up a lot of storage space on my computer ( 275GB out of 350GB) and my pentium 4 processor seems to be taking a long time opening applications ( it take me 16 seconds to open Word 07!! )
My current Intel Pentium 4 is measured at 3.4GHz- Is there any point investing in a slower 2.0Ghz Core 2 Duo?
My motherboard is compatible and I have a ATI HD3850 as a Video card
