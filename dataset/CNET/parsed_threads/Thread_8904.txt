<s> I have an industrial application (measurement instrument) which has a SCSI-2 connector (HD-50 male) which is used to connect to an external SCSI drive. </s>
<s> Since the external SCSI drive we used is no longer available, I need to find either: (a) An external drive that has a SCSI-2 interface (or one which I can adapt to), or (b) A SCSI-2 to USB converter to allow the use of a USB drive or stick. </s>
<s> For (a), I have not been able to find anything other than SCSI drives which have VHDCI connectors, which I'm told cannot be adapted to a 50-pin SCSI-2 interface. </s>
<s> Is this correct? </s>
<s> For (b), all I can find are adapters which treat SCSI as the peripheral, not the host (i.e. </s>
<s> the host is our instrument with the SCSI interface, and the peripheral would be a USB device). </s>
<s> Any suggestions for either solution? </s>
<s> No, we cannot re-design our product to use a different bus architecture (too costly, and the product is going EOL shortly). </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> I still have some scsi drives in the closet and see numerous scsi drives on ebay. </s>
<s> Some companies insist on new parts but as such fall out of production you have to get the used parts. </s>
<s> You are right about the lack of new hardware or adapter. </s>

<s> as profitt said, ebay is the best place to get legacy equipment. </s>
<s> i think have a couple of scsi-2 drives, a 4gb and something else that are in working order. </s>
<s> pay for shipping and i'll give them to you... my wife is pleased when i reduce my inventory </s>
<s> Thanks guys, if it were for my personal use I'd take your offers, but this is for a customer who would expect a brand new product, not used. </s>
<s> I did find an internal SCSI drive from Adtron which uses Compact Flash media ( http://www.adtron.com/products/Sdds.html ), but I need an external drive. </s>
<s> I looked for a drive enclosure for SCSI, but all are either IDE, USB or SATA. </s>
<s> The SCSI drive enclosures I saw were not the right form factor ... bummer. </s>
<s> No more emails, hitting their websites, etc. </s>
<s> Most have some reserve for situations like this. </s>
<s> They may have refurbs too. </s>
<s> I know we had to do this for SUN machines. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I know the scsi train pretty well. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>

<s> adaptec just discontinued their scsi/usb adapter. </s>
<s> if adaptec (whose name is synonomous with scsi) is dropping these type of products, it means that external scsi is about dead. </s>
<s> http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33354 </s>
<s> I forgot to mention that to replace that 25 pin boxed SCSI drive you'll likely have to piecemeal a solution from a few makers. </s>
<s> I'd look to GRANITE for their adapters from 50 or 68 pin SCSI drives I see for sale all over (Newegg.com has those drives) to the 25 pin outlet. </s>
<s> You'll either find a new drive housing or modify one to get over your last run. </s>
<s> You can finish this but I doubt you will find NIB ready to use 25 pin SCSI drive in a box like we did 10 years ago. </s>
<s> This is going to be not so much fun but is par for the course as old technology exits. </s>
