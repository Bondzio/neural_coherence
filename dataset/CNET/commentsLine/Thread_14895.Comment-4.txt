excuse if repeated... besides getting a 400w at least or more, you should seriously consider a &quot;quality&quot; unit as pricing pretty much separates the two.
also, a build-in 2nd or dual fan setup for the p/s unit is practically a must to better handle its own heat plus any from the system.
if you don't do this, sooner or later you pay the price either in a failed system, of not only a doomed p/s but possible other componets going down as well.
