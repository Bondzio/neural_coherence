There are versions that are socket 754 and offer higher front end buss speeds but are still 32 bit. The 3100+ is $112 at newegg. But for $124 at newegg you could get the AMD64 2800+. Two years ago I built a PC with a AMD Athlon 2400+. A few months ago I did another one for a friend who wanted to keep the cost low, used a Sempron 2400+. The only difference between the two is the cost of the processor. John

The Socket 754 version is and Athlon 64 with lower cache and no 64-bit extensions. However, AMD IS MAKING 64-bit semprons and should be coming out around July 30, according to xbitlabs.com
