So I recently found a great online deal for an Asus cm6870 for the purpose of using as the base of a gaming rig. I replaced the PSU with a Coolmax ZU-900B to power my GTX580 GPU. After testing 3 or 4 games, I launched Skyrim with some graphic mods and the PC rebooted. This happened within about 30 minutes of testing. After trying the game again about 15 minutes later, I realized that the audio was playing very slowly and was pitch-shifted really low. I also heard the fan blowing loudly, so I turned it off immediately. The back the case was painful to the touch. Here's some info that may be useful: - The case does not have a fan in the front. - The PSU did not initially align with the screw-holes in the current case until bending some guide-rails out of the way. - The PSU did not have direct connections for the video card but had some additional cables that connect manually via the PSU's housing. (I used common sense in using only connections that fit naturally) - The motherboard is pretty small (1 x16 pcie, 1 x1 pcie). - The case has non-removable covers where additional slots would be. (possibly restricting airflow) First off, did fry my GPU already? And why is it overheating so quickly? Is it the case? The PSU? The motherboard? Could not having a front fan or any apparent frontal ventilation on the case lead to that quick of an overheat?

The exchange obviously replaces hot air for cool. If you have some restrictive path or simply one that is block or not yet fully used, you need to make it happen. Best explained by visiting gaming websites to review pix of all those gaming rigs out there. If you have no frt. fan, then get one and mount as it should(empty space/mounting) and draw air, &quot;in&quot;. Better fans have an embossed &quot;arrow&quot; showing air direction or label/decal. You mention, no side cover, well either that's a poor gaming rig or it wasn't for gaming in general. Now, you know why gaming rigs cost more, everything is geared to make it stay running longer, even the case. What some users have done, make a &quot;blow hole&quot;, by cutting on side or top(or both) and mount a fan there. It would appear the Asus cm6870 is capable, so investigate what's what. Maybe a plate is blocking air, you have to remove it by flexing it off(knock-out?). Better PC cases have the PSU mounted on the bottom to better assist heat exchange as they too cause heat. heat rises and its better exhausted by upper fans and all is expelled out. Also, if a filter is mounted at frt. maybe remove it, as you need better airflow even unfiltered as demands are greater than can be supplied &quot;as is&quot;. These are areas to look at, so they're suggestions and using common sense you may zero-in on problem area. Also, visit gaming websites. GPU in general will run hot or at least uncomfortably so, but if too hot, they will stress out and worse, fail. Be sure that if the GPU is fan cooled it is working as well and clean. http://www.maximumpc.com/articles/reviews/hardware/cases tada -----Willy

I also heard the fan blowing loudly, so I turned it off immediately. The back the case was painful to the touch. QUESTION: Which fan.....the CPU fan ? The GPU fan ? or the PSU fan ? Here's some info that may be useful: - The case does not have a fan in the front. - The PSU did not initially align with the screw-holes in the current case until bending some guide-rails out of the way. - The PSU did not have direct connections for the video card but had some additional cables that connect manually via the PSU's housing. (I used common sense in using only connections that fit naturally) - The motherboard is pretty small (1 x16 pcie, 1 x1 pcie). - The case has non-removable covers where additional slots would be. (possibly restricting airflow) QUESTION: Have you tried running it with the case's side off ? First off, did fry my GPU already? And why is it overheating so quickly? Is it the case? The PSU? The motherboard? Could not having a front fan or any apparent frontal ventilation on the case lead to that quick of an overheat? ANSWER: Fry GPU ....not way to tell. Try running system with case side off. ANSWER: Overheating so quickly....almost anything and everything overheats when it cannot dissipate heat. Again, try running system with case side off. QUESTION: How many power connectors from the PSU are connected to the GPU and exactly which GTX580 (mfg/series/model #) do you have ?? SUGGESTION: Download,install, run and minimize PCWizard 2012 ...the system temps including the CPU, the GPU will remain on the screen....let us know what the temps are. VAPCMD
