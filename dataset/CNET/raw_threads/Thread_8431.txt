I have a six year old HP d325 mini tower and I was curious about switching out the processor (currently have an Athlon 2800+). I checked the Internet to find who makes my motherboard and one site called it a Compaq motherboard. I wanted to check with the maker and see what the fastest processor I can go up to is. Thanks
