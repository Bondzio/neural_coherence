I am looking for something inexpensive but reliable. I don't need more than 80GB. The purpose is to store iTunes software and mp3s. Does anyone have any recommendations?

While USB hard disks make fine fast second copies or easy access, they are not any more reliable than what's in our PCs today. You can read pleas for help in recovering what's on said drives in these forums. I've yet to find any maker to stand out as to reliability. I'd get some 99 buck unit and keep a backup of what I can't lose on DVDRW or your choice. Bob
