It is showing up in device manager ,so i know it has installed ok. Anyone know how i can access it?I'm using WIN98SE.

Windows 2000 likely formatted it in NTFS and Windows 98 doesn't do NTFS. There are two solutions if the data is intact. 1. Boot a KNOPPIX CD and copy the files you want off. 2. Look up NTFSDOS and see if that works. A maybe on this one. Bob
