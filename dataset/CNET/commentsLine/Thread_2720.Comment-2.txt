open case and place it where it seems not to work.
using some non-conductive probe, plastic stick or pencil(erarer end) wiggle or jiggle this or that and see if it makes a difference.
i would also swap out the hdmi cable, those are simple cables.
it helps to know what's what, pc?
video card?
etc.. there also the possibility the mtrbd.
has been compromised, minor crack or component in some fashion, unless you can fix, replacement is only option if found so.
