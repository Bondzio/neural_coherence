i'm considering purchasing a dell 960 printer.
i believe that the printer is manufactured by lexmark.
one thing that concerns me is that dell says you must purchase the ink cartridges from dell and the lexmark cartridges will not work with this printer.
does anyone know if that is true?
i sure would like the option to purchase my ink cartridges locally.
