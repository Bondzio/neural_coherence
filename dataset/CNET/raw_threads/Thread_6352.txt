When I hook everything in, turn on the PSU, and turn on the power, the fans run for less that one second before turning off. I am positive the motherboard is not shorting out on the case, nor is any other component. I've triple-checked all of the connections, but I still get the same problem. It's possible that on the trip back, one or more of the parts may have sustained damage. Can anyone diagnose this problem?

While you mentioned you're sure no shorts on mounting, you should return the system to a minimum level plus have it on a non-conductive surface(aka, cardboard). No drives, only video, some ram, and mtrbd. with kybd. and mouse. Power-ON and see what it does. Take steps to proceed if it boots or signals its OK. I further suggest you inspect the mtrbd. for any leaking, bulged, distended, blown capacitors(looks like small soda cans). Try all that... tada -----Willy

This board may need the four wire plug to be used. If all else fails one can short between the green and any black wire on the wide plug to see if the PSU fires up and stays on. And lastly do the drastic. Sometimes it is necessary to bench check a computer that will fail to start. This involves Pulling the Power Supply and Pulling the motherboard. Remove everything from the motherboard and place the bare board and Power Supply on a piece of Styrofoam or cardboard. With the power supply on the table connected to the motherboard and Power supply plugged in, Use a small tool to momentarily short the two power on pins. The Power supply should turn on and stay on noted by the supply's fan running. Power off. Now put the CPU/HSF on, add one stick of RAM, and mount the motherboard And power Supply back into the case. Connect the Power Switch wiring, no mouse, keyboard or monitor or case fans and again see if the power supply turns on and stays on. Get past this point power off and connect the keyboard, mouse and monitor, If needed Get into the BIOS to set boot options. Add one thing at a time checking each item. Case fans first. First drive to add should be your CD. drive then hard drive.

When I tried it, it would only function when the two wires were touching. I have already taken everything off of the motherboard and hooked it up to the PSU, and it still would only work for a second.

It should be like the day it was build, blank. Attach PSU and speaker and power-ON, it should beep like crazy or some beeping. If you like leave a fan that gets power from mtrbd. connection. If that fan stays on plus the PSU fan you have a possible mtrbd. issue. If not or it simply twitches its a PSU problem, replace with known good/new one, retry. If you continue to get no fans running or no beeps the mtrbd. has had it for whatever reason. Some people may try to short the bios pins in order to clear the bios and return to defaults. ATX mtrbds. have a start ckt. and/or VRM area(maybe module) which may have failed and unless you're capable and able to find parts, its a wash. Replace the mtrbd. with a new/old one and march on. tada -----Willy

In my previous tests, I always left the processor in because I thought it would have no weight on the matter. When I performed your test I removed EVERYTHING (including the processor) and only connected the PSU and the case speaker to the motherboard. When I did this the PSU fan ran consistently until I cut the power, and when I replaced the processor, it went back to only turning on for a second. Does this mean that the processor is the problem?
