most hard drives have &quot;smart&quot; technology that can report read/write failures.
as the drive error rate goes up the smart technology contionue to retry the request.
but most utility don't read this information so it is usually useless informtion.
however, i have used software (spinrite) that that can read this information.
this software is mainly used for hard drive recovery but it may be help to evaluate whether a drive is having problems and detecting when the error rate is high, hopefully allowing someone to replace the drive before failure occurs.
but it may be cheaper to just buy a new hard drive.
