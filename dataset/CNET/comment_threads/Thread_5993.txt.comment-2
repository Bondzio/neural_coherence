eww biostar, anyway have u gone into bios and set the boot order , recheck all the cables / power n data connected ?
Is your cd drive IDE ?
Is it cbl select or set as master or slave ?
Usually set the cd as master alone with 1 hdd sata connected.
Or if hdd and cd are IDE , use the same cable with hdd as master and cd as slave.
