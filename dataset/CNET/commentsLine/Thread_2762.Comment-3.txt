no matter what chip you get, you should be able to overclock it if you want to.
if money is no object, go for a quad core.
if it is...well, depends on your price range.
e6600 would be a good choice for a midrange budget.
if you just want something cheap to overclock like nuts, get an e4300 or e6300.
