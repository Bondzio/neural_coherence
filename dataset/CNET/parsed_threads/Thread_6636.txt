<s> I just bought the Coby MP305-2G MP3 Player and everything works fine but when I plug it into my USB to transfer songs, my 3 1/2 floppy disk drive keeps checking for a disk until I remove the MP3. </s>
<s> I looked for solutions on the web but haven't found anything useful. </s>
<s> This really gets annoying and isn't normal at all...HOW DO I MAKE THIS STOP? </s>
<s> Thanks I appreciate your help! </s>

<s> Clear Recent Documents. </s>
<s> If you forgot how, google or bing that. </s>
<s> Thank you but it still does not work when I do this </s>
<s> Some newer pests jump onto machines due to a vulnerability. </s>
<s> So let's plug that gap. </s>
<s> Research AUTORUN EATER. </s>
<s> Free over at download.com </s>
<s> I tried downloading AUTORUN EATER, installing it, ran it and the ran my MP3 player...it detected an autorun but then I couldn't use the software to transfer music ect... </s>
<s> It appears their software is causing this. </s>

<s> Do you really need a floppy drive? </s>
