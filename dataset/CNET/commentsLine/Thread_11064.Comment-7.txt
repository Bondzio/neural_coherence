my concern lies in making sure that all my private documents and data are kept well away from anyone who might wander in and try to hack my information.
anyway, what is nat?
where does it reside?
disabling the firewall within the router does not disable nat?
i'm really showing my networking ignorance here.
if you know of a source where all this is explained in non-technical terms, i'll be happy to review the information off line and not waste your time with trying to bring me up to speed on it.
