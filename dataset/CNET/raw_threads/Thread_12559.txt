I have purchased a second SATA hard drive from Dell. The first one came in my 4-year-old Dell Dimension 8300. I finally figured out, with help from someone here, that I need jumpers to designate one drive as master and the other slave. In a chat with Dell, I was given a phone number to talk to the folks at Dell spare parts. I can't repeat here what I said before I hung up on the &quot;tech,&quot; but he told me that Dell does not have jumpers for Dell's hard drives. I need to be directed to an online or on-the-street store to purchase them. It would be better if it were online or by telephone, because I live in rural Kentucky, gas is $4.50 a gallon and I lost my job recently. In addition to telling me where to go -- people love to do that -- but exactly what to ask for. Asking Dell for jumpers sent me to a guy that sells ribbon cable. SATA drives, as you all know, don't have a ribbon cables. Thanks in advance. I know someone here can and will help me. KYB

IF you find the new drive is showing as master then move the drive you want as master to the lowest numbered SATA connection first.
13742	2	298347	2794439	2794413	KentuckyBlue	6/18/08 11:53 AM	1.21378998E12	I'm in the dark here	The &quot;tech&quot; in the chat gave me the web site: http://www.wdc.com/en/library/eide/2579-001037.pdf and I thought the info on the second and third pages show how to set up a master/slave arrangement. I don't doubt your information. You've been correct about almost all questions I've asked here. (I can't say where you were wrong, but nobody's perfect.JOKE!) I don't know anything about speed as it applies to the drives; I learned about the jumpers from someone here, I think. Whatever, Dell says I need jumpers and said to come back to the chat, they would help me install them. They told me to be very careful about installing them, and if I don't have to buy and install them, it's OK with me. I can, and have switched the HD cables on the MB of this Dell Dimension 8300. Are you suggesting all I need is to do that is make that switch and then install the OS, Windows XP HE, the necessary drivers and that will make the new, larger drive the master/boot drive and turn the original drive into the slave? Since I don't need the jumpers, how do I make the new master drive the boot drive? TIA KyB

Is there anything else I need to do to make the new master drive the boot drive?

Now I don't offer support or much for G4U COPYDISK since it's free and I type just 3 words to perform that copy the rest of us may have to use ACRONIS, software listed at http://www.duxcw.com/digest/Howto/hd/cpyhd/index.html or &quot;other.&quot; Sorry but I don't use much other than the first 2 I noted. To set one as master I plug the sata cable into the lowest numbered sata connection.

There are some things on the old drive I'd like to keep, but that's for another time. I'm just going to install the SW for which I have the original CDs. KyB
