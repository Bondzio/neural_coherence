there are backup solutions available that could save your data from a nuclear holocaust, but they cost a fortune.
or, you can use faith-based backups for free.
the determining factor should be &quot;what is my data worth?&quot;.
maybe you only use your computer for web-surfing and personal email, and you don't have anything worth saving on it.
then it isn't worth backing it up.
maybe you have all of your photos on it.
definitely worth the time and money to at least burn a couple of dvds once in a while and store them at some friend's and relatives houses.
maybe you have a thousand hours worth of work on it.
what's that worth to you?
backups are like taking care of anything valuable, the more that it's worth, the more you should invest in protecting it.
