<s> I bought these some 6 years ago and never had a single problem. </s>
<s> A couple of months ago bought new Dell computer and just connected them and they sound better than ever. </s>
<s> I noticed, however, over the last couple of days I can hear this very annoying squeak coming out of them ... volume is turned right down ... what could be causing this? </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> There are various possible reasons for this happening. </s>
<s> Mostly likely it's either the speaker or the connection. </s>
<s> Try disconnecting and reconnecting all connections. </s>
<s> Also try switching the left and right speakers. </s>
<s> If the same speaker makes the squeaking noise, the problem is with the speaker; it might need to be replaced. </s>
<s> Speakers don't last forever, although most good ones should last more than six years if not abused. </s>
<s> If you switch the speakers and the other one makes the noise, the problem is with the source. </s>
<s> Make sure the sound card (if you're not using onboard sound) is firmly seated in its slot. </s>
<s> Try using a different sound card, if possible. </s>
<s> Like most such problems, isolating the cause is a matter of trial and error, and a process of elimination. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I believe mine were made just before Creative Labs took over the product and they are quite nice except for the volume control which is an in line potentiometer rather than a control on a speaker. </s>
<s> Anyway, what do you mean by squeak? </s>
<s> Do you mean a high pitched noise that is there all the time or just when you play music or hear sound? </s>
<s> If only when you are listening to music or other sound, does it come from both speakers. </s>
<s> If ''yes'', reverse the left and right speaker leads to see if the sound follows the speaker or the channel. </s>
<s> If ''no'' can you try them in another PC or connect them to another input source. </s>
<s> Mine started to act up a while back and would produce a raspy sound intermittently. </s>
<s> I had to pull the sub woofer assembly apart to get at the amplification circuitry and eventually found a bad solder connection or two in the output transistors stages. </s>
<s> I had to resolder these. </s>
<s> Getting into the electronics of this thing was a bit tricky. </s>
<s> I suspect the solder joints were not that good and the vibration eventually broke the leads loose from the board. </s>
<s> They're on another PC now and working fine. </s>
<s> Thanks for your response Steven Haninger! </s>
<s> Before digging in too deep, I disconnected and reconnected everything. </s>
<s> Fingers crossed, at this very minute they are silent and the only thing which is not on, is the desk lamp. </s>
<s> I noticed last night when switching off the lamp before the computer, the speakers let out a big &quot;rasp&quot;! </s>
<s> Very odd! </s>
<s> The squeak coming from the speakers was very faint, intermitent and not noticeable with music. </s>
<s> But when I sat here quietly, was irritating. </s>
<s> I am hoping they stay dumb for now! </s>
<s> These speakers have bounced around with me from country to country and am amazed they have lasted this long. </s>
<s> I bought new set from Creative Labs, but still in box; don't have the heart to throw these away - they still sound so amazing! </s>
<s> The volume control is fidly (it's called a potentionmeter eh? </s>
<s> ), but means I can have the speakers far back, away from monitor (flicker) and mobile phone (buzzing). </s>
<s> I do have new hardware since purchasing new computer; cordless mouse and QuickTV which, I suppose, could suddenly be interfering - too many wires and signals around! </s>
