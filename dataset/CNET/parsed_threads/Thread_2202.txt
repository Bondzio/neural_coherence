<s> AthlonXP 2500+ Generic (Hercules) 400W PSU 1GB RAM 1 DVD-ROM 1 DVD+\-RW Radeon 8500 (64MB) Floppy SB Audidy 2 Plat, with Live Drive installed XP SP1a all updates OK, so I'm playing a game of War3 and suddenly the system just seems to lock up. </s>
<s> The monitor just goes black and then into power save mode. </s>
<s> I smell what smells like popped kettle corn coming from the PSU. </s>
<s> No other parts seem damaged after visual inspection. </s>
<s> Including the CPU core. </s>
<s> If I turn the system on, the fans all start up and the DVD drives flash like they should. </s>
<s> The floppy is silent, and I get no signal to the monitor including the pre-POST diag messages. </s>
<s> The monitor displays a message about how there's no signal. </s>
<s> I've tried switching video cards, monitors, reseating the video card, making sure the other PCI cards were still seated properly, nothing works. </s>
<s> The only way to turn the system off is via the switch on the power supply. </s>
<s> The power and reset buttons don't work. </s>
<s> My thinking at this point is that the PSU has blown out enough that it's unable to power everything in my system. </s>
<s> I know AthlonXP's are known for putting high demands on PSU's, and I suppose I'm lucky the potentially dead one lasted as long as it did. </s>
<s> But before I run out and spend about $80 on a replacement PSU, I want to see if others agree with my assessment. </s>
<s> I'll supply an article about how to select the size and then another about how they lie about the rated size. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ In closing, we lost about 5 motherboards and a few power supplies due to failing motherboard capacitors. </s>
<s> Be sure your PSU loss isn't due to some other issues. </s>
<s> But with what parts you've listed, that PSU may have been just too small. </s>

<s> On a side note, after you get your P/S problem fixed(I hope), could you tell me how you like the XP2500? </s>
<s> I'm trying to decide between the XP2500 and the XP2600 Barton. </s>
<s> Not sure the XP2600 would be any faster for the extra money. </s>
<s> Can't find a side by side comparison. </s>
<s> Good luck on the PSU. </s>

<s> You mention &quot;generic&quot; and that what can happen, especially on a loaded-up system. </s>
<s> At least 400W is better than 300W whcih many a home build system case comes supplied with, so at least you started out decent. </s>
<s> The problem with a blown p/s unit is that it *could* cause other problem(s). </s>
<s> So don't discount it should after replacing the p/s unit flaky problem(s) may appear. </s>
<s> The better p/s units are Enermax or Antec(sp) or those supplied by pcpowerandcooling(dang good). </s>
<s> It not surprising that 500W+ units are now available and even if generic is better than 400W unless name brand. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
