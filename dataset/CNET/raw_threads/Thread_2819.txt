I have fdisk'd the hard drive and reinstalled Windows XP and at some random point after XP is installed. I start getting errors on boot up and some programs won't open. I believe it is a bad sector on the harddrive, but not sure how to fix it with XP. It could also be bad RAM. I might have an old memory stick to swap out and try. The processor is an INTEL P4 3.2ghz (Preston chip) if that matters.

These are usually non-destructive processes. Often HD manufacturer's use these to validate warranty claims by having the user run the utility which returns a code describing the health of the drive. Download and run the utility. As for RAM, free diagnostics are also available. Use google to look up MemTest or memory testers. There are a couple of good ones that will create a boot floppy or an .iso that can be burned to a CD ROM disk. They work well. If your problem is memory or the HD, these free utilities will let you know.

Analyze the disk using disk management and see if it reports a bad sector or locked sectors. You can as you stated swap out memory modules to test those besides memtest (but still a good idea). Running disk diagnostics is limited if it not allowed to actually write to all sectors, such as to your disk. If in doubt get a new drive copy everything over (Ghost or new drives utilities), reformat the old one and use it for backup unless its bad.

If you don't have a floppy drive, you'll need burning software that can create a bootable ISO image CD. SpinRite analyzes your HDD (or even floppies) sector by sector, removing and recovering data from a bad sector to a good one, and quarantines the bad sector from future use. SpinRite will also warn you of a failing HDD, hopefully in plenty of time to either save your data or clone your HDD to a new drive. It will also work on TIVO hard drives, although you have to connect the HDD the drive from the TIVO to your computer. The only downside is the price. $89 for the download, but when compared to the cost, downtime and inconvenience of dealing with a failed Hard Drive, it's cheap. If you need to clone your HDD to a new drive, I recommend Acronis. They have a free trial period so you could probably do a quick hit & run to check it out: http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/index.html

Note to old timers: This is NOT the old Maxtor data transfer program for a new HDD that never worked right. It is actually Acronis' Migrate Easy.

I run an error check on my hard drive virtually every week. It's supposed to look for and fix bad sectors and file system errors. I once had a Word document go bad on me and lost an entire edition of a magazine that I had stored to floppy. This utility also works on floppies, so I had a chance to see it in action. It restored my damaged file - even though it put in some squiggly marks to indicate unrestorable damage. I got that edition back though, essentially intact. As a complete novice I assumed, hopefully, that the same utility would also do a similar repair if I got a bad sector on my hard drive. In case I didn't use the correct name I'm talking about the checking utility that you get by clicking &quot;my computer&quot; then right clicking on &quot;C&quot; drive or whichever drive you want to check, click properties, select &quot;tools&quot; tab and then click &quot;check now&quot; for error checking. Then check the two boxes, restart the pc and wait....... while the drive is checked. Then run a disk clean up to get rid of any check disk fragments. So I expect you techie people will now tell me why this isn't the best way to fix things. Mostly I get told that Microsoft utilities aren't as good as XYZ alternatives. My laptop is getting on a bit and so I might need this information myself one day.

Microsoft had an update recently that broke a lot of drivers and I had to restore to fix the problem. Sometimes you can boot up - but have errors like yours. However, in my experience I have seen these things happen in this order of likelyhood: 1. Sometimes a simple scan disk with both repair options checked can fix the problem; followed by defragmentation. 2. Malware recently infected can be the problem but others here have already covered this. 3. I already assume you didn't replace any hardware but Microsoft and driver updates can cause problems with the boot process. A quick check of the Device Manager for &quot;splats&quot; on your hardware is well worth looking at. If there are any yellow ? signs then it is time to have it scan for hardware changes, update the driver, or reinstall the driver. If this doesn't work go to the vendor for that device and download updates. Make sure XP is fully updated before doing this. 4. Now it is time to try the most likely reason your having problems; but this will take more effort and so I list it last. Some hard disks need to be low level formated with their in-house disk utility before the operating system is installed, if you don't do this from the get go, the disk geometry can be off set and can cause serious problems later; including loss of all data. The advise to use the original manufacturers diagnostic utility is a good one; but remember if you don't find anything physically wrong with the hard disk, you may have to start over and format the hard drive with the manufacturers utility. Usually this is on the same disk as the diagnostic utility. All major manufacturers usually have a floppy or CD maker download so you can make the disk(s) yourself. I have had better luck with the ones that burn a CD-ROM as a more complete formating of the MBR area is done more easily that way. 5. There are many RAM test utilities that can check your RAM modules. The vendor there again is the best source but I have had great luck just using the top rated utilities here on CNET at download.com. This is also well worth the time compared to messing inside your system units.

I've been able to get past the place that I would most often error. So I think its fixed. Thanks for all the great troubleshooting advice. I will hopefully retain some of that if I have future hardware problems.
