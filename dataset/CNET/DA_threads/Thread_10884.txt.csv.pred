1.1.1	Ok ...	St
1.1.2	I have n't worked on it for this yet .	St
1.1.3	( Gateway , 933mhz , 128 ram , 40gig hdd . )	St
1.1.4	2 weeks ago I worked on my sisters gateway replacing the modem and cd/rw drive that were bad as well as removing a lot of spyware and adware .	St
1.1.5	I ended up just reformatting and reinstalling windows .	St
1.1.6	She could n't do anything with the computer as it was .	St
1.1.7	She called me last night saying the pc wo n't start now ?	Ques
1.1.8	She says she does n't hear anything , the power start light comes on she says , and the 3 keyboard lights flash and that 's it .	St
1.1.9	I guess by that , I 'm leaning towards power supply , without seeing it yet , going to do that tomorrow .	St
1.1.10	Is there a way to test the PS , I have a voltmeter and am very good with figuring things out .	St
1.1.11	Wondering if anyone here could offer anything ?	Ques
1.1.12	Any help with this issue would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	It 's also windows ME , I 'll check on this post in the morning .	St
1.2.2	Then after checking the computer , I 'll add anything sles I find .	St
1.2.3	Duane	St
1.3.1	Observe the fans when you turn on the PC .	St
1.3.2	IF they just twitch and stop , the PS has tried to start but has shut down .	St
1.3.3	This is usually a detected overload .	St
1.3.4	It could be in the PC or the PS .	St
1.3.5	Disconnecting the PS from the PC will not help troubleshoot it .	St
1.3.6	You can not easily start an ATX supply without it being connected to a load .	St
1.3.7	Even if you can jump the start switch connectors , it will refuse to start if no load is attached .	St
1.3.8	If the above symptom is true , strip the MB connections of add in cards , RAM CPU etc .	St
1.3.9	and disconnect the drives .	St
1.3.10	Turn on the PC and see if the fans will run .	St
1.3.11	If so , the PS has started .	St
1.3.12	You can measure voltages if you can find a diagram showing where to read them .	St
1.3.13	If the PS starts , you can reconnect things to see if it continues to shut down .	St
1.3.14	If it does , the connected device might be bad or the PS has reached its load limit .	St
1.3.15	If the PS never starts even with just the MB attached , you are probably looking at a bad MB or PS .	St
1.3.16	It 's a matter of logically ruling things out .	St
1.3.17	Good luck .	Polite
1.4.1	with real thin/sharp test leads , you can probe the voltages from the rear of the molex connector on the mobo from the power supply .	St
1.4.2	The voltages of interest are the Main 5 volts , the 3.3 volts , and the +12 volts .	St
1.4.3	The minus voltages are of no interest .	St
1.4.4	The 5 volt standby voltage should be there anytime that the power supply is plugged into a live outlet [ and the switch on the rear of the supply is on ] .	St
1.4.5	This voltage is what allows the logic circuits to turn on the main voltages by a momentary contact power switch .	St
1.4.6	I 'm accusing you of being a human being , LOL and 30 plus years of troubleshooting taught me that 95 % of the time the trouble was caused by a human being having been working inside the equipment .	St
1.4.7	First simply recheck evcery possible connection et al that might have gotten disturbed whether intended or not .	St
1.4.8	BTW , I include myself as a human being that can screw things up unintentionally .	St
1.5.1	I powered it up with all hooked up and got nothing but lights .	St
1.5.2	I disconnected the floppy , cd/rw drivesall cards except video and after starting it up about less than a minute later the cpu fan started and then stopped like 2 seconds later .	St
1.5.3	So I took the memory out and restarted it , well same thing with the cpu fan but this time it stayed running , although I did have to manually spin the fan for the PS to get it going .	St
1.5.4	They stayed running without booting up until I reconnected the cd/rw drive then I heard the cpu fan gradually start to slow , it stopped then I heard 6 loud beeps , and 3 more beeps sefore it shut down .	St
1.5.5	Voltage at yellow wires is 1 V , red is 11 V. PS is a newton power ltd. model nps-250CB A 250W max .	St
1.5.6	If it is determined that it is bad How do I know it is an ATX type ?	Ques
1.5.7	Being that the computer is already 4 years old , already having put in a new cd/rw drive and a new modem , is it worth it to keep going on parts ?	Ques
1.5.8	Being as cheap as you can get PC 's now ?	Ques
1.5.9	Thanks for all y'alls help on this .	St
1.5.10	Duane Miller	St
1.6.1	It was actually .01 volts and .11 volts..	St
1.6.2	So I put everything back together and the computer started up and the right voltages are there 5 and 12. this time ... hmm ...	St
1.6.3	But I still have to manually turn the fan for the power supply , so could this issue have possibly have caused the PS to go intermittently bad ?	Ques
1.6.4	It also is not booting up all the way .	St
1.6.5	ok I hear the HHD spinning , but there is no Display .	St
1.6.6	I do n't know where to go with this now .	St
1.6.7	Duane Miller	St
1.7.1	fan , or the Power Supply as most prefer .	St
1.7.2	PS 's are not expensive .	St
1.7.3	If the tower shuts off automatically after using the normal Windows shutdown , it is an ATX type supply and mobo [ system ] .	St
1.7.4	If an AT type there is a bundle of heavy wires from the power supply to the power switch .	St
1.7.5	This is the AC Power going up to the switch and return as the way an AT supply gets turned on .	St
1.7.6	It 's your [ your Sister 's } judgement as to buying a new system .	St
1.8.1	Works in computers also , he loaned me an extra tower , ( functioning computer ) so that I could swap out hardware to eliminate issues .	St
1.8.2	Ends up his good power supply would boot her system .	St
1.8.3	But no video ( his video card did n't work in it either ) ( bad MB problem there ) Although her HDD , and Video card worked fine in his .	St
1.8.4	Her PS would n't boot up his working PC .	St
1.8.5	So looks like her PS and MB are bad .	St
1.8.6	Thanks for all the help , unless y'all have anything else to add , I appreciate the help on this issue .	St
1.9.1	Check the mobo for bad capacitors [ leaking electrolyte or bulging ] and if it is an ABIT mobo read the posts about the class action suit and possibly get the mobo repaired/replaced free .	St
1.10.1	anything that shows what type of motherboard it is , I see markings but nothing comes up on a search , although I do n't see anything visibly wrong with the capacitors either .	St
1.10.2	Thanks again Mr. Harinec	St
