Your post is light on details so I can not check for you, you didn't tell what the BIOS reports or if you looked as WINDOWS which can mis-report ram.

Was it giving you problems that might have been related to RAM? If you took it somewhere or sent it away, did you pop the cover from the bottom that covers the memory slot to see if the RAM was still there? If it is, maybe you could reseat it. Just a thought.
