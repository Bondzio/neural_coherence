hi, i have a 2wire 1000hg router in an office in my shop hooked up to a desktop system using a direct ethernet cable.
i have another desktop hooked up using a 2wire wireless unit(about 30 feet away and works great).
i have another desktop in a home office about 300 feet away(not working to great).
i tried wrieless a couple years ago but it was just to far away.
i had at&t wire the same phone line to my house as i was using for the dsl service.
i then hooked this home office computer up using the 2wire pc port adapter and it worked so so.
now it hardly ever works.
what can i do to make this a wireless connection?
or what can i do?
when this is solved i need to network these three computers if its possible.
thanks for any help.
