<s> you could buy an LCD TV/monitor combination, in which case you'll get a lower quality (by computer standards) monitor and a TV OR buy any monitor you want, and a PCI capture card (around $70) which allow you to use the PC as a DVR, and you can watch TV whenever you like (you may have to hook the sattilite box into it, i'd contact them on it (i know it should be possible, but i've never had sat. </s>
<s> TV to try it out)) </s>
