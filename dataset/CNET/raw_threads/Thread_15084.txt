Will there be a significant increase in performance( meaning I'll be actually be able to tell )by getting a newer one with a 16MB cache also running at 7200 rpm? Also will getting a larger one make a difference? In other words is there any performance benefits in having a 250GB HDD vs 120GB one assuming both are exactly the same otherwise? I really don't need more storage since I barley use 1/4 of the current 120GB, but if getting a 250GB will mean better performance then I'll spend the extra $$$.

HDD mfgs have managed to increase the data density per platter significantly over the past few years from 10GBs, 15GBs and 20GBs/platter to 100GBs or 125GBs per platter. So if you look at HDDs that rotate at the same speed, 7,200 RPM (some IDEs run at 10K RPMs), but the data density increases significantly over the same distance ... it stands to reason there will be some increased speed for both disk reads and writes due to increased data density alone. The question is, if the files are relatively small, how much gain will you actually see the day-to-day or normal use of your computer ? Hope this helps. VAPCMD

For GP usageage..doubt you'll get your money's worth. If this is a perf issue... Unless I could prove the HD was the cause I'd take my money and look elsewhere.
