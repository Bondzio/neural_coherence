A Machspeed P4M800 Pro motherboard. The computer was custom built so I don't have any special model or brand. I was wondering if anyone knows why my processor max's out every time I open a new program? Or is this normal and should I not worry about it?

There is an issue with DMA that can cause some sluggishness but without details about the machine all I can offer is this -&gt; http://winhlp.com/WxDMA.htm Bob
