When i insert them the LED starts blinking and shows orange light. But after some time when i insert the disc again it works fine. At first I thought that this problem might be due to scratches on the disc but there are very few scratches on the disc surface which normaly should not cause the problem. Is the problem due to bad quality of the disc. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Awais Rauf.
