I want to upgrade the video card, but I'm told that there aren't any agp ports on my comp. My question is, is there a good enough pci video card out there that can fairly run cs source, c&c generals, hl2, at a decent fps rate? Or do I have a better shot at building an entirely new computer? Here are my specs: Intel Celeron 2.4Ghz 2.39 Ghz, 1.00 GB of ram PC 2700 (2 - 512mbs) Dell Dimension 2400 Thanks.
