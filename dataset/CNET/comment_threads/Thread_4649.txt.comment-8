It's not too bad.
This is my first full build, so I haven't had experience with other cases.
The handle, which is plastic, was what made the sale for me.
I still have to see how it'll hold up once I've finished building it.
The fact you have a 500w PSU thrown in is a big bonus.
Having said that, I'm not sure how long the PSU is going to last.
The price is ridicules.We'll see.
Value wise, it's a winner.
