I am in the market for a new laptop. I run quite a few database intensive programs as well as multitask extensively. With all the new laptops out there my question is should I opt for more Ram (12GB) or would the performance be better with say 8GB of Ram and a 32GB mssd. Thanking everyone in advance for their help

An example long ago is where we had identical PCs and was able to swap the RAM from one to the other. The job would take 6 hours. So we doubled the RAM and re-ran the tests on both machines. The machine with double the RAM finished 5 minutes sooner without fail. So RAM in that case was not the bottleneck. 12GB of RAM on a netbook in my opinion is a bad investment.
