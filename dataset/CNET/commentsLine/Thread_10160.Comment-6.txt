hey the new hard drive is 40 gb.
i am really just needing to put the hard drive in my gateway computer with a 700 mhz cpu and 256 mb memory to install the operating system for a friend.
i am at work now, but i am getting ready to go home to work on the drive.
i am going to master the drive and try to install the operating system that way.
i do need to know if the windows xp home disk has fdisk on it.
thanks again laraine
