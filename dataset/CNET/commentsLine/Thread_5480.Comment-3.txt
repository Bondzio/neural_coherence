well my tv now has the standard s-video ports (red, white, yellow) although i suppose in the future i could get an hdtv.
the make of the tv is sansui, i'm not even familiar with the company.
not sure what the model is, but does it matter?
i thought all that mattered were the connections.
i have no fancy connections on the computer, just the outlets and the monitor.
