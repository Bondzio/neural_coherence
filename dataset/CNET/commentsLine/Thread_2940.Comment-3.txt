i found a similar situation with my wifi laptop.
i had been to another person's house to help her set up some wireless equipment - linksys in this case.
the linky equipment comes from the factory with &quot;linksys&quot; as the default ssid, so we had to work with that long enough to get to the administration pages and change it to something more secure.
however, my winxp system &quot;remembers&quot; having been to an access point named &quot;linksys&quot; in case it ever has to associate with it again.
back at home, there is no such access point, never was (i don't have any linky wifi stuff, but that's a different discussion), and none of my nearby neighbors either.
but whenever i take down my primary wifi network and put up a substitute (for testing and other reasons), the dialog boxes of the wireless zero configuration utility on my winxp system always include opportunities to re-establish contact with that non-existent &quot;linksys&quot; access point.
i suppose i could do some down deep and dirty editing of the registry to find and delete that little devil, but it hardly seems worth the risk of turning a working system into a boat anchor.
