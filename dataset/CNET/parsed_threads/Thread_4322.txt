<s> Hi, In my home we have an iMac G5, two laptops running Windows XP, and one desktop, also XP. </s>
<s> We have an O2 wireless box iv (which I believe is a rebadged Thomson SpeedTouch TG587nv2) to which the mac and desktop pc are wired and the two laptops connect wirelessly. </s>
<s> One of the laptops is mine, and i would like to be able to connect to the mac to share files etc, and possibly to the other pcs, but this is not imperative. </s>
<s> I have a printer connected to the mac, and one to the pc, which I would like to be able to access from any of the laptops. </s>
<s> I haven't got a clue how to start setting this up! </s>
<s> could anyone offer advice please? </s>
<s> can i use the wireless router as a print server? </s>
<s> what are the security implications of having all the computers networked i.e if a virus infected one, could it spread through the network? </s>
<s> Most of the people in my house are even more clueless than me, I wouldn't want one of them clicking on an email attachment and infecting everyone! </s>
<s> thanks in advance for any help and advice. </s>
<s> Why not get a wireless (WiFi) printer since any printer server will cost just as much. </s>
<s> Also, the setup is not the only thing you would learn but when another machine won't print you dive into another deeper pool of issues that you don't seem ready for. </s>
<s> There is no single paragraph I could write to begin to cover it all (unless I wrote to google it?) </s>
<s> so the simplest solution is to get a WiFi printer and then let them print to it. </s>
<s> As to sharing files. </s>
<s> I can start by using DROPBOX (see google). </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Get a wireless printer for about $100. </s>
<s> Load the software on each laptop and desktop, make it the default printer on each michine and save a lot of time and trouble. </s>
