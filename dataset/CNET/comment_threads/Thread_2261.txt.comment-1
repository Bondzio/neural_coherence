I have a Compaq Presario SR1620NX with an AMD Sempron processor running Windows Vista (did not come with PC).
I am currently running the manufacturers video card which is an ATI Radeon Xpress 200 and I just recently bought Halo 2 for PC and it does not meet the required graphics standards to run it so I am looking to upgrade but I cannot find a decent graphics card that can run on a 250w power supply, that is compatible with windows vista, and that is 512mb.
if you have any suggestions or comments on what i should do or buy they are greatly appreciated.
Thank you in advance.
