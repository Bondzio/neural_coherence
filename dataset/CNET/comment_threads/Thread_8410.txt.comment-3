I do have WEP enabled, but I've tried it with WEP turned off as well and it made no difference.
I have no other encryption options turned on.
The SPI firewall is turned off.
And I certainly take your point about rated speeds never been real life speeds, but like I said, I'm pulling close to 7 megs wired, and usually less than half of that wireless.
If that's an expected downgrade you'd think it'd be something the router makers would bring to your attention right away to stop people from calling into their tech support lines or something.
Thanks for replying though
