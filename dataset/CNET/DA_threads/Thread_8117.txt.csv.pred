1.1.1	Hi There I Have been building a new PC I installed a MSI K & KM3M-V Motherboard which has a VIA KM266Pro + 8237 Chipset Based .	St
1.1.2	The cpu I used is a 1700AMD XP Athlon which came from a working PC the memory is 256mb which is new and a 40GB hard drive scandisk checked with no problems and partitioned and formated into two halves.I tried installing windows XP Pro and the CD ROM drive kept stopping , to determine weather it was the CD ROM or the CD I tried to install Windows Home , the same thing happened .	St
1.1.3	As this was an old CD ROM I thought that this might be the problem .	St
1.1.4	I ordered a DVD writer from my supplier .	St
1.1.5	As the writer was out of stock and that was the one I wanted I decided to wait for the one I wanted .	St
1.1.6	With days passing I decided to dismember my main pc and use the DVD writer out of that computer .	St
1.1.7	A similar thing happened I tried several times to install windows and most times it stopped at the & quot ; Windows is loading the Setup Files & quot ; on three other times it came up with the message I have typed below .	St
1.1.8	I personally think this is a motherboard problem but wanted to get your opinion and expertise before I contact the supplier , so I can give them a better analysis of the Mater I have tried everything sugested on the Error page and set the BIOS to Failsafe setup .	St
1.1.9	the ERRR message is as follows A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer .	St
1.1.10	ACPI_DRIVER_INTERNAL If this is the first time youve seen this stop error screen , restart your computer .	St
1.1.11	If this screen appears again , follow these steps : Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed .	St
1.1.12	If this is a new installation ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any windows updates you might need .	St
1.1.13	If problems continue , disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software .	St
1.1.14	Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing .	St
1.1.15	If you need to use safe Mode to remove or disable components , restart your computer , press F8 to select Advanced Startup options , and then select Safe Mode .	St
1.1.16	Technical Information : *** STOP : 0x000000A3 ( 0x00000001,0x00020052,0x00000000,0x00000000 ) Many thanks to all who try to answer this .	St
1.1.17	Kindest Regards Tony B .	St
1.2.1	XP will glide onto good hardware .	St
1.2.2	You 've found a bad combo , setting or part .	St
1.2.3	You may be nonplused to learn that today 's machines still have poor to nonexistant diagnostics , arrive with out of date BIOS or FIRMWARE and can be setup ( BIOS ) to be nonfunctional .	St
1.2.4	A call to the machine 's supplier for warranty replacement of parts or machine is the next call .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	As Bob implied , be sure your motherboard has the latest bios updates .	St
1.3.2	That chipset has been around for a while and has likely been updated .	St
1.3.3	Check the mfg .	St
1.3.4	website for the the latest bios updates .	St
1.3.5	I recently replaced a board ( new out of the box ) in an old PIII machine .	St
