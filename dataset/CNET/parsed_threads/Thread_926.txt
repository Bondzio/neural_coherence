<s> During the beginning installation of XP for my newly built computer... i see that i do not have all the components of XP (such as a calculator or windows media player). </s>
<s> I'm suspecting that the error i saw during the installation (Windows needs some files from the windows xp cd please insert into D: D:\i368) well it is in... and everytime i click on OK doesn't do anything... so i'm suspecting that not sure. </s>
<s> Anyone know of any ways to resolve this issue of missing XP components ? </s>
<s> usually during win. </s>
<s> xp install, it saves the i386 folder somewhere. </s>
<s> so go look in ur main partition (c: drive probabbly ) then windows&gt; should be in there </s>
<s> the folder wasn't there... so i just moved it from the cd onto my harddrive but dunno what to do with it...? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> not sure...as this is the pc hardware forum..try the xp forum....best of luck to you tom </s>
