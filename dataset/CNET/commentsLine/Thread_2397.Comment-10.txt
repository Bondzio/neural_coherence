-- resolution -- 1. extract the file wiafbdrv.dll, from &quot;c:\windows\driver cache\i386\driver.cab&quot;, place this in &quot;c:\program files\visioneer onetouch\&quot;.
2. in device manager find the &quot;usb scanner&quot; under other devices, right click and tell windows to update driver.
-- windows does not have automatic updates for the driver so you must install the drivers from the cd first.
not sure if the file in step one is required, i have not had a 3rd chance to try witout the file first.
if you have this issue, please try installing the software then updateing the driver before extracting the file, and let everyone know if that worked.
-- i have done this on 2 diffrent systems, with 2 diffrent models (8920, and 8320).
one system was a clean install of windows xp (8920), the other an existing windows xp install (8320).
-- if you are thinking about buying this scanner, i would stay away from this brand entirly: it should not take some one with my techincal experince to install a driver.
one problem is ok, this is why people like me have jobs.
same issue with 2 diffrent models that aren't even the same year is a bad manufacture.
