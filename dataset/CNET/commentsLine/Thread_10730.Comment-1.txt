i have no local c: or d: drives visible in disk management, nor nero backitup 3 nor ghost 14. but i boot okay and they are visible in windows explorer.
i have an xp sp3 hp mediacenter 3.2 ghz, 2 gb ram, raid 1 230 gb hard drives.
interestingly enough, when i boot up in safe mode diskmanager shows c: & d:!
thank you.
