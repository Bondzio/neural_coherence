that the ethernet is only 100 meagerbits per second (typo intentional) whereas the sata rate is far beyond that.
there is no speed issue here.
as to the specific card, you note &quot;inexpensive&quot; yet this sounds mission critical.
sorry to read that.
-&gt; let me be blunt.
you can fit a 10 buck sata card and move on or spend time to research the better adapatecs.
how are they better?
support and features.
