<s> A friend called me up from Texas asking for help - his floppy disk has changed to Read Only. </s>
<s> I assume he has WinXP but that's all I know. </s>
<s> read only tab. </s>
<s> It's on the corner of the floppy case. </s>
<s> Open the file(s) in Explorer, click Properties, uncheck the Read only button. </s>
<s> My friend has this to say: I HAVE TRIED MANY THINGS, BUT NO RESULTS. </s>
<s> THE LATEST IS TO SELECT THE FLOPY, CLICK &quot;PROPERTIES&quot; AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE I SEE THREE BOXES AS FOLLOWS; 'READ ONLY' - &quot;HIDDEN&quot; AND &quot; ARCHIVES&quot;. </s>
<s> USUALY THE READ ONLY IS CHECK, SO I CLEAR THAT AND TRY THE OTHER TWO ATTRIBUTES OR NONE . </s>
<s> AN &quot;APPLY&quot; BOX APPEARS AND I CHECK THAT, BUT NOTHING CHANGES. </s>
<s> DO YOU KNOW HOW I CAN GET RID OF THE &quot;READ ONLY </s>
<s> Do a Google or Microsoft search on &quot;Take Ownership&quot; </s>
