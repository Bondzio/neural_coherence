at it and tried pulling on the RTC, it didn't seem to budge, so it probably is soldered in.
As for the JP11, I thought I located it, but the item I was looking at seems to be soldered to the board too.
I noticed on the board were some other things with JP's so I looked for JP11 on the board.
I saw that printed next to the RTC and the BIOS chip.
The item next to the print &quot;JP11&quot; is two pieces of metal pointing straight up.
I know that's not the right technical jargon but it's the best I can do.
I'm not sure what I can or can't do from this point on.
It is odd that last night when I was looking for the RTC to check on prices, I got the idea that anyone could buy one and replace it like it was RAM or something else, but I guess that's not true.
