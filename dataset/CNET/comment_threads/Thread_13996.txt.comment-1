i just payed for the ATI 1300 PRO 256mb PC AGP card.
after i installed the carded i started to play a game online.
then with in 30mins of the game my pc CRT monitor went black & gave me a message saying &quot;monitor is out of range & told me to fix the settings.&quot; but how would i fix the settings if my monitor is all black ?
