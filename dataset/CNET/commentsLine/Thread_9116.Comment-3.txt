many thanks for your excellent help.
in fact, disk utility reports that the volume is mac os extended format, so i think i followed the instructions when setting up the disk.
this wasn't with disk utility, but with the supplied software on the drive.
i don't have a backup to the data - photos and music mainly - so this is a huge problem.
from what you say, disk warrior may well do the trick?
