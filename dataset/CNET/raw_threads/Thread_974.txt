I dont like a lot the Blu ray burner because each disc cost around $22.. its a lot of money for only just one. So I saw this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827129015 , but i dont now anything about blu ray. I know that nmy video card its a BFG 8800 GT HDCP ready, and my procesor Intel E6850 3.0GHZ with Corsair XMS2 4GB 800MHZ . Thanks you!.
