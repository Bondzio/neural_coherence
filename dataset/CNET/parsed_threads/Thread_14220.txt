<s> I have a Mitsubishi WD-52627 and I intend to use it as my computer monitor, it has an HDMI input for a computer as well. </s>
<s> My PC is a Dell Dimension 4700 with an Intel Pentium 4 CPU 3 GHz and has 512 MB of RAM. </s>
<s> The card I have now is supports S-Video but I do not care for the picture quality whenever I plug the PC into my Mitsubishi. </s>
<s> My question is what kind of card should I buy to support HDMI? </s>
<s> Or can this be supported? </s>
<s> And finally is this an easy install? </s>
<s> (easy is a relative term, I know) </s>
<s> You'll need to first purchase a video card that has a DVI output. </s>
<s> (You should check first to make sure that you don't already have this, but I'm pretty sure the Dimension 4700 does not. </s>
<s> It would be a white port, not the usual blue one.) </s>
<s> You can purchase any PCIe (PCI express) video gard with DVI output, which most cards have. </s>
<s> You can get a nVidia 7300GT for under $100 from retailers like zipzoomfly.com. </s>
<s> Just pop that into your PCIe port on the motherboard and you're ready for the next step, which is to purchase a DVI to HDMI cable. </s>
<s> It's a simple cable with DVI on one end, and HDMI on the other. </s>
<s> Just plug the DVI into your video card port, and the HDMI into your TV, and viola, you're ready to go. </s>
<s> Just google DVI to HDMI if you need help finding a cable. </s>
<s> this 7600gs hdmi also supports hdcp so if you move to vista, you'll be all set: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127237 you'll still need to attach audio cables between the pc/card and tv since only video is piped through the hdmi port of this card. </s>
<s> Thank you very much... </s>
