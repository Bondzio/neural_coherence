<s> I have been reading ways of setting up a 2 router network, and could use some help. </s>
<s> What I am trying to do for a small local business is this: DSL internet, in the house, PC in shop (40 to 50 feet away), and wireless access while in the shop. </s>
<s> What I was thinking of doing is taking a router from the house (that connects to the DSL modem and from router to PC) to the garage where a router would be set up as a switch with wireless capabilities. </s>
<s> I need the PCs to have file sharing. </s>
<s> I would love to see diagrams if anyone has links to them. </s>
<s> Thanks TC </s>
<s> My wpnt834 connects 2 houses away at over 200 feet. </s>
<s> Maybe you can try yours? </s>

<s> If might, but my experience with a WRT54g linksys router I have trouble connecting to my livingroom 20 feet away. </s>
<s> Maybe it is the PCI wireless card I have connected. </s>
<s> What hardware do you suggest. </s>
<s> With files sharing, the wireless might be slow. </s>
<s> The small business is in a country setting, and I and iffy on broadcasting unsecure, open wireless. </s>
<s> How can he keep track of who is using the wifi without too much trouble. </s>
<s> I have this setup. </s>
<s> cable modem -&gt; WPNT834 (w/wifi) -&gt; Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 (with White Russian WEBIF firmware). </s>
<s> The &quot;-&gt;&quot; are ethernet cables. </s>
<s> Nothing special in the settings. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> the hard wire goes to the lan or the wan connection of the R2? </s>
<s> From what I read it goes in he lan 1 or R2. </s>
<s> Will the router be able to turn the internet connection into wifi? </s>
<s> So if I had a cable modem -&gt;R1 -&gt;Pc and -&gt;R2 lan1, and able to wifi and hardwire from it like a switch. </s>
<s> cable modem to wan of first router the the wan of the second router goes to one of the lan ports of first ports. </s>
<s> Nothing special as to settings. </s>
<s> Besides my usual settings of ssid broadcasting, WPA there isn't a thing I changed. </s>
