and  this url reads..... will my iomega product work with windows vista?
question will my iomega product work with the new microsoft windows vista operating system?
answer iomega is currently working to complete testing with the new microsoft windows vista operating system.
in most cases, windows vista includes the drivers necessary to recognize iomega drives.
vista's native drivers should assign a drive letter to most iomega drives in my computer.
important note: this compatibility information is based on testing only with 32-bit platforms of windows vista and does not indicate compatibility with 64-bit windows vista platforms.
iomega is still evaluating product compatibility with 64-bit platforms and will have more information available in the future.
rev users: a new version of rev system software is now available from iomega that improves compatibility and makes several features available under windows vista.
to download the rev system software version 5.0.0.8 for windows vista, please choose your windows vista platform: 32-bit | 64-bit.
important: a rev disk formatted under vista without the new system software (version 5.0.0.8 or higher) will not work in previous operating systems, such as windows xp, windows server 2003, or mac os x. zip users: iomegaware software will not work with windows vista.
you will still be able to use your zip 100mb, 250mb or 750mb usb, atapi, firewire or scsi drives in windows vista, but certain features supplied by iomegaware will no longer be available, including: long format (short format will still be available through native windows vista tools) password protection parallel port zip drives will not be supported in windows vista.

hope this helps
