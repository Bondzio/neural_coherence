All sound from the speakers works, but when i try to use a microphone it doesnt pick up any sound. Ive checked all the advanced options and it isnt muted anywhere. I tested the hardware but it never picks up any sound. All the sound drivers under the device manager work, except for one driver, called &quot;multimedia audio controller, which is labeled as unknown. What i dont get is that the mic worked with this exact setup a month ago, and it just stopped working one day. I tried the mic in another computer and it worked, so i know it is not the mic itself. I've tried updating the drivers from the creative website and everything. Any help would be appreciated.

My Shure SM58 Cardoid microphone required a jumper to be put in on my CLabs X-FIdelity card. Try one of the cheap PC microphones and see if it works if you are trying a high quality vocal or directional audio Mic.
