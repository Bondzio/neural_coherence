1.1.1	I recently installed windows 8 on my laptop and have had some problems burning dvds and playing them .	St
1.1.2	Windows burning software would not work burn them and neither would imgburn or dvdflick .	St
1.1.3	So i downloaded Freemake video converter and successfully burnt 30 dvds onto tesco dvd-r disks .	St
1.1.4	Every single one plays without problems on my dvd player and xbox 360 but not one will play on my laptop .	St
1.1.5	They are on Pal .	St
1.1.6	The computer views them as blank dvd-rs and says they are empty not sure how this can be though as they are dvd-rs not dvd-rw so should not be re-writable .	St
1.1.7	I have tried updating the drivers for the drive but windows says it is upto date .	St
1.1.8	I also uninstalled the drivers and re installed but still no luck .	St
1.1.9	Any help on this would be appreciated Thanks !	Polite
1.2.1	http : //www.howtogeek.com/127774/how-to-play-dvds-on-windows-8/ tells how to fix this .	St
1.2.2	This may confuse folk but DVD Player Software is not free .	St
1.2.3	VLC Player is free due to where the folk that write it are and the laws of the land there .	St
1.2.4	Since Microsoft would have had to pay a license fee , many Windows 8 versions ca n't play DVDs .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	It 's by design that they do n't play : Windows 8 does n't come with DVD-player software .	St
1.3.2	A retail DVD wo n't play either .	St
1.3.3	http : //www.extremetech.com/computing/142796-how-to-play-dvds-and-blu-ray-discs-in-windows-8 tells more .	St
1.3.4	But it should n't show as empty , I think .	St
1.3.5	Can you read a data-DVD ?	Ques
1.3.6	Kees	St
1.4.1	You might want to try Nero software .	Sug
1.4.2	It works well on my Windows 8 computer .	St
1.4.3	I have a $ 20 LG DVD/CD drive there .	St
1.4.4	Good luck .	Polite
1.5.1	Thanks everyone for the reply 's , i should have been more clearer in my first post but i have VLC installed and i can play retail DVDs on the computer through VLC .	St
1.5.2	When i insert a burnt DVD-R autoplay opens and gives me 2 options one is to burn disk and the other is do nothing .	St
1.5.3	The burnt DVD-Rs also wont open directly in VLC as it says error please check log .	St
1.5.4	So basically everything works fine accept on burnt DVDs which show as empty , it literally offers the space on the disk to copy to .	St
1.5.5	I will try nero now and see if they will play but would really like to find a solution to this situation as i have burnt 30 DVDs that wont open Thanks !	St
1.6.1	If the person making said DVD did n't make a single closed season or used that drag and drop method to create the DVD , all this should happen !	St
1.6.2	Bob	St
1.7.1	Hi bob , i made the DVDs using freemake video converter , i opened freemake , choose video at the top and browsed to the desired movie file .	St
1.7.2	I then clicked to DVD and choose settings Pal and burn to disk when finished converting .	St
1.7.3	They all converted then burnt to the DVD-Rs and as far as i could see the disks where finalized .	St
1.7.4	So the problem is freemake ?	Ques
1.7.5	not correctly burning the disks ?	Ques
1.7.6	although they do play on the xbox and dvd player .	St
1.7.7	Thanks !	St
1.8.1	But why create a Video DVD at all if you have the source file ?	Ques
1.8.2	With the source file on a DATA DVD it can be played in many apps and I would not lose resolution .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	The reason i created DVDs was so i could play the movies directly in my xbox and DVD player but also be able to play them on the computer .	St
1.9.2	I gets awkward when you have to use a VGI cable to watch your movies on the TV .	St
1.9.3	Basically i just wanted to be able to play the movies on the computer , DVD player and xbox which is why i did n't just keep the avi , mp4 and mkv files on disk .	St
1.10.1	Something in the creation is broken .	St
1.10.2	You can play the files directly on the computer so for now it appears you are able to do what you need .	St
1.10.3	Maybe not what you want .	St
1.10.4	In closing , I use DVD FLICK to create such DVDs .	St
1.10.5	Bob	St
1.11.1	Yeah , DVDflick would n't work for me , it make the video_ts and audio_ts files but would not successfully create a dvd .	St
1.11.2	I can still do what i need but its abit of a inconvenience so will give nero a shot .	St
1.11.3	Thanks !	St
1.12.1	think i could just convert the files to the required format then play them on xbox through the media player ?	Sug
1.12.2	think that would avoid the need to create a DVD .	St
1.13.1	I can create those to drop onto a DVD in a custom way .	St
1.13.2	Most of the time I have DVD Flick create an .ISO so I can create a few copies or even better , play the .ISO in VLC PLAYER .	St
1.13.3	In closing , I use IMGBURN to create the DVD from the .ISO .	St
1.13.4	Bob	St
