I was planning to install it myself, but he claims we have to download all sorts of drivers and involves more than either of us can handle. He purchased the board without consulting me, but claims he verified with the seller that everything should match. The computer is custom-built (from a barebones kit), Windows XP Pro, DDR. It was built by an acquaintance, but we live more than two hours away now, and none of the local computer shops have good reputations. Please let me know what's involved and whether I should try installing the motherboard myself. I've installed and formatted a hard drive, and stuck extra memory chips into the motherboard, but wouldn't consider myself a computer whiz by any stretch of the imagination. Many thanks.

Also I can't comment if you'll need a new OS. For instance some HP/Compaq/other owners get a rude shock when they replace their boards. Bob

Here is the type of MB my hubby purchased: INTEL P4 HT LGA 775 FSB 800 DDR 400 ATX MOTHERBOARD+L+S I asked hubby for more info on the computer (he bought the kit and helped his friend build it), but he said he couldn't really provide any more info than I did initially. According to the USPS, it's now in Maryland (we live one state over). Thanks, Bindarra

The only issues will likely be that XP may not boot. Don't panic since there are articles aplenty to deal with that. Here they are -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=XP+CHANGE+MOTHERBOARD&btnG=Google+Search Most of them offer advice on drivers as well. Bob

Unfortunately, we ran into an unexpected delay -- Best Buy misinformed us about the type of board I have. When they diagnosed it as dead, they told me it was a socket 775. When we opened it up, however, we discovered the malfunctioning board was a socket A/462. Thankfully, the gentleman my hubby bought it from consented to a switch, and we're waiting for the 462 to arrive. I do have one question from reading the links you posted: if I need to reinstall some Windows files, will that erase my hard drive? I have a lot of stuff on there I want to preserve! I'll post again once we get this done -- I'm sure I'll run into problems and will need your expert advice once again. B

It will note &quot;Change motherboard and save OS.&quot; Also known as the XP REPAIR INSTALL. Of course with any such change there are no guarantees your hard disk will keep your files. That's why you read so much about backup. Bob

The first Socket 462 motherboard wouldn't fire up, although the power supply came on. A friend gave us another one, never removed from the box ... and the power supply wouldn't even come on. So I'm giving up. Repairing this computer is obviously a money pit, and no one seems to be able to diagnose just what is wrong with it. I'll probably buy another barebones kit from Tiger Direct, although I'm so bitter about this, my third consecutive faulty computer, that I may not buy another one. Anyway, thank you for your assistance.

Much easier to figure out what's wrong and try different parts should the need arise. Better luck on the next one. VAPCMD
