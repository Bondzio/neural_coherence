I have a B&W G3/350MHz machine that I received a NewerTech G4/400MHz processor with. The problem is this: To run this processor, it requires a Firmware Update that originally came with the processor (when it was new). I do not have this needed Firmware Update. Is it possible to get this update online somewhere or do I have a processor that is no good to anyone? Thanks, Jason

I found a link to another site where all the Newer Technology drivers and firmware updaters were available. As long as the processor still works, the machine will run OS 10.4 quite comfortably, albeit a little slowly. Tip: You have the manufacturers name, try their website first. newertechnology.com P
