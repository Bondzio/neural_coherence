Hi, i am trying to export songs, mp3's from my computer onto my Samsung A920. I am using my belkin and my transflash card to put music on to so i can then put it on my cell phone. However when ever i try and move an mp3 file onto the transflash card it tells me that there is write protection and to try and use another disk! i have no idea what that means and i need to know how i can remove the write-protection on the mp3's so i can get them onto my cell phone.... PLEASE HELP! thank you.

First you will need to have a USB-Micro SD Adapter. Circuit City sells them. Plug it into your USB port. Make your the Micro-Transflash adapter is not set to lock (this is what enables write protection, it is on the side of the adapter). Copy files into the Media folder created by your phone on the disk. Now you can play those MP3s. E-Mail me at csamples@sw.rr.com for info if you need help.

The phone detected the card and said it was unformatted, &quot;do you want to format?&quot;. No matter what I kept failing. Remember, first use, brand new SanDisk. I then took out the card, placed it in the adapter, switch by default in the open position and tried to format using my built in reader. No luck. Dazzle high speed reader, same thing. My question. Is this &quot;electronicaly locked&quot; or a malfunction (bad batch of cards? Maybe SanDisk can help here. Colonel Terry

Then when I went back to add more and delete a couple it wouldn't let me do either, said it was write protected. There are no buttons on the data stick itself, there is nothing in the properties box to check or uncheck or that says it is write protected. it just says to remove the write protect to keep on using but doesn't tell me how and there seems to be no way to do this. Help please, please.

Many out there clearly have a problem with removing write protection. They are not idiots. Unfortunately some people giving advice are not very good listeners. so for you in particular Id like to state the facts. Unchecking read only, though cute, does not work Downloading to hd is another cul-de-sak And the most obvious suggestion, unlock sd card, is obvious. So whats the problem, well its most likely that the write protection message is in fact a smoke screen to hide the fact that your card reader is at fault, alot of multi card readers seem to be the problem, other than that there really is very little else that can go wrong. Swap card readers and find out. Regards cnet 2007

The tab on my card is not locked, and I've tried with two different card readers. Also, when the card is in my digital camera, the photos save to it just fine. Do you have any other thoughts on this? Thanks!

This really is a pain..Whenever I had an issue with write protection I always managed to solve it by changing card readers, but it sounds like youve done this. How about going into a dealer and ask to try out a spangly new card reader there and then, take your memmory card and try and download in the shop. Most shops will let you try before you buy, especially if you say something like &quot; I dont trust buying online any more. we should all support our local retailers&quot;. You know the kind of thing. Anyway it seems like its really hit or miss out there regarding writ-pro, with some people sailing fullsteam ahead without a sign of an iceberg whilst others resort to the WHY ME senario so good luck and remember when technology goes bad its not personal. Dont get angry, get even

I was using the card reader that is built into my Canon MP830 printer. Then I remembered that my printer has a built in read/write lock in the printer itself. I went into the setup menus for my printer and changed the card reader from read only mode to read/write mode. Then I put the card in and I was able to copy files to my mini-sd card. Chances are that if you are having this issue, your card reader is set in a &quot;read only&quot; mode. -Thanks, RP

If your Sandisk is write protected and you've already set it to &quot;unlock&quot;, then you card reading device is most likely in read only mode. Give the dude some credit!
