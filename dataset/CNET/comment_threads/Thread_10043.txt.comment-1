Hello there i'm new here, My name is Daniel and i have a question for you: I currently own an e-machines t3256, with this specifications: Windows XP Home sp2; 2.2GHz AMD Athlon XP 3200+; Nvidia Nforce-2 chipset; 512MB DDR SDRAM 333MHz; 64MB (shared memory) integrated GeForce4 MX; WDC WD1600BB-22GUA0 160GB 7,200rpm So i would like to play this games: Quake 4 and Doom 3 on it, but just the demo of Doom 3 makes an awful performance on it, so i would like to know what would be the recommendations to upgrade my system to make this games very enjoyable on it.
I know for a fact i have an agp port, and as i saw a graphic of it, it can take up to 8x agp video cards, and the memory maybe i will have to change it to 1 gb of ram?, but still i haven't made a decition, i could use a lot of advice on it, btw i can invest like 300-400 $ to upgrade, any suggestions?
Thx.
