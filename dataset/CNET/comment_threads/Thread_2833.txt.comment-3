Thanks.
I disconnected one wire from the router and then reconnectged it and tried again.
I got a connection on the other desktop, but the signal was so low, I couldn't connect to the Internet.
I am on the laptop now so that gives me more information, but doesn't clarify what the real problem is.
I have heard that vertical connections work better than horizontal ones.
