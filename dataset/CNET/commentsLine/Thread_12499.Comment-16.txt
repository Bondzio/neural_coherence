a lot of hp's machines use noname power supplies.
i have met a lot of people who have found that the psu will die after 1-2 years.
they seem just good enough to survive beyond the standard warranty and not much more.
meanwhile, i have found anecdotally a lot of white box machines with name brand psus seem to last 5+ years.
i don't have enough data points to speak authoritatively, but i don't think the name on the outside of the computer is as important as the names of the components inside.
in that respect a byo or a white box build by a knowledgeable local vendor may be a much better choice for reliability.
another slightly more expensive option is to buy a business model pc.
they tend to cost slightly more expensive(10-25%) than their consumer edition versions for the same hardware, but they tend to use slightly higher quality components and their confidence in the quality of the hardware typically extends to the point that they have better warranties on the business models as well.
consumer hardware tends to focus on value rather than reliability.
business users on the other hand aren't as concerned about performance or gee whiz features as they are in reliability.
business users still obviously want performance, but they aren't as willing to compromise reliability in order to get it.
