<s> Aloha, I need to buy a traveling case for my new LaCie external hard-drive. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me find a secure case to travel with. </s>
<s> I'm a video editor and it would be much better than what I do now (carry around the factory packaging). </s>
<s> If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks... </s>
<s> http://www.plasticase.com/content.asp?node=7 has some very nice models. </s>
<s> I did see that, but I think I'm going to look for a multi-purpose/less expensive case. </s>
<s> I found these two Case Logics, if you wanna look and let me know what you think... http://www.amazon.com/Deluxe-External-Storage-Travel-Case/dp/B0016OZ05O/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&m=A2QHBM8MEN9W65&s=electronics&qid=1232585478&sr=1-17 http://www.amazon.com/Deluxe-External-Storage-Travel-Case/dp/B0016P02WE/ref=sr_1_24?ie=UTF8&m=A2QHBM8MEN9W65&s=electronics&qid=1232585478&sr=1-24 </s>
<s> I looked at the plasticase because we use such on our gear today. </s>
<s> But we make some custom electronics and when we travel we can't replace our gear easily so we put it in cases we can carry on and will survive an 8 foot drop. </s>
<s> It's all about the need. </s>
<s> Yours is the fine case to avoid small bumps and drops. </s>
