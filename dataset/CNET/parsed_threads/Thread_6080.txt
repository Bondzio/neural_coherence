<s> I own the following 500gb external hard drive, attached constantly to my Windows XP PC, saving the bulk of my non-EXE or program files (docs, pics, etc) effectively on a constant backup. </s>
<s> I've owned it for about two years and never had any problems with it until now. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.co.uk/Western-Digital-Elements-500GB-External/dp/B000OS54TA The drive is formatted to Fat32 - got it that way and just never reformatted it. </s>
<s> Now, with just 107gb of its space used up, I try to save one image file today to my very large (over 19,000 files not counting subdirectories) image folder and this happens. </s>
<s> Over and over. </s>
<s> http://yfrog.com/j3clipboard01dlp The drive seems to hate saving files *with a long filename*, which I gather is a complaint of some external hard drives. </s>
<s> But the problem is: Why is it complaining about this NOW? </s>
<s> Up until now I've been able to save any file whatsoever onto there with any filename I wanted. </s>
<s> There are files on there with names like '00711385595004928.jpg', really. </s>
<s> So why does this cause error now? </s>
<s> The actual size of the picture doesn't seem to make any difference, just the filename! </s>
<s> If the name is short, images do save onto there. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Is there any way I can get this drive to accept long filenames once again? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Would reformatting to NTFS help? </s>
<s> Would it involve deleting or corrupting anything? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Would using more subdirectories help? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> Try a new folder. </s>
<s> Stuffing many files into one folder is frankly, dangerous. </s>
<s> Even more on FAT32 volumes. </s>
<s> Yes we can usually convert to NTFS with no loss but the moderators all know &quot;We only lose what we didn't backup.&quot; So before I go one step further, could you tell where the backup copies are? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> ATM, the external hard drive has no backups (&lt;_&lt;; &gt;_&gt;;). </s>
<s> All files stored on there are just there; it's where my main collected files are kept. </s>
<s> If it comes to that I can easily copy all/most/some of them over to my internal C: drive, however it take up like 75% of the free space, so I'd prefer to do it sparingly. </s>
<s> It would take some hours, but I have some hours free. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I could also use more subdividing my Image folder, which is indeed far too stuffed. </s>
<s> It already has about 30 subs. </s>
<s> If I use either of these methods, would I be able to save files freely once again? </s>
<s> I could do both, but is it going to be necessary to also backup? </s>
<s> Again, would reformatting to NTFS solve my problem, or help is some way? </s>
<s> (BTW, my C: drive is NTFS) </s>
<s> I know better than to convert it to NTFS. </s>
<s> Yes it should fix it but since there is no backup the conversion while it works 99.99% of the time is it worth the risk of no backup? </s>
<s> Only you can answer that. </s>
<s> Since I know the risk I won't tell you how to convert. </s>
<s> But you can find out with a google like &quot;Windows XP How to convert to NTFS?&quot; Sorry to hear another no backup story. </s>
<s> These rarely end well. </s>
<s> Need evidence? </s>
<s> Look at entries in this very forum. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, as I've said, I CAN easily back it up - I just need to copy the files over to C. That's a backup, yes? </s>
<s> I don't want/need to reformat C, it's NTFS already. </s>
<s> So really I'm not taking any risks. </s>
<s> I'll certainly make a backup before messing around with my external. </s>
<s> OK? </s>
<s> Thankyou for your advice. </s>
<s> You are right about my irresponsibility regarding the drive. </s>
<s> For not beating me up over the repeating comments about you know what. </s>
<s> Hope it all turns out great! </s>
