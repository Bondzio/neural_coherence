<s> I am in the process of trying to make to most of my new super-router. </s>
<s> One of the challenges is to allow two work laptops tied to respective corporate domains to share not only the basic WLAN/Internet connection (that bit works already), but also to use the HP LaserJet 10221 printer connected via USB to the WL-700gE and hopefully also access the disk drive. </s>
<s> My home network is a Windows Workgroup (W2K Pro SP4) and I cannot change the network settings of the work laptops (with Windows XP). </s>
<s> I there a way to solve this problem? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance P.S. </s>
<s> IMHO, ASUS has some unutilized opportunities to improve the WL-700gE Manual... </s>

<s> I there a way to solve this problem?&quot; Yes, beer. </s>
<s> Usually beer when your IT staffer that controls all this is how you loosen them up to get them to relax the locks. </s>

<s> Dear Bob, My point is that I own and control the ASUS WL-700gE and would like to use it without any need to make changes on the work laptops. </s>
<s> I fail to understand what my bona fide quuestion has to do with forum policies. </s>
<s> Since I am using my work laptop via VPN it would be detrimental to mess around its setup in any way. </s>
<s> I hope someone can help me with this. </s>
<s> To configuring the router to make it work since most &quot;work&quot; laptops need a domain to log into. </s>
<s> You can't fake that with a router. </s>
<s> The forum policies are very clear about help to thwart some business or IT's control. </s>
<s> You may feel it's ok to discuss such but the forum policies forbid it. </s>
<s> Sorry and hopefully it will dawn on you why the router settings are not the cure. </s>
<s> I have found the beer solution to work on most IT staff. </s>
