1.1.1	My Hard drive as we speak works a bit than goes silent, I don't have a light where my hard-drive is like most PC's to tell whether its working but its &quot;somewhat&quot; loud, but normally only while playing games.	St
1.1.2	Lately (perhaps I&quot;m paying more attention) I can hear it working but it stops, much like hard drives I've had in the past.	St
1.1.3	Is this normal?	St
1.1.4	Also its 750g, I'm only using around 80g of space atm, so I'm not sure why it's thinking so much?	St
1.1.5	I run Virus/Malware Scans daily (quick scans)...is that ok to do, or is that working a HD to much?	St
1.1.6	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	My computer has a problem similar to what you have described: It makes a very loud noise whenever there is activity on the computer.	St
1.2.2	I am uncertain if the noise is from the hard drive or from the cooling fan.	St
1.2.3	If it is the fan, I would rather have a steady fan noise than the intermittent noises.	St
1.2.4	Don	St
