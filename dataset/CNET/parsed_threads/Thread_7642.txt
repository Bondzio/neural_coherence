<s> I have heard of wi fi or something? </s>

<s> You see I really have no requirement for xbox or the wish to spend so much money, if it can be avoided. </s>
<s> So any other suggestions would really be welcome for the reasons already given. </s>
<s> Thanks dave </s>

<s> You'll come back to what I found. </s>
