however i am aware of enough information on the topic.
the cell processor itself is not an embedded computer chip it is a full fledge microprocessor connected to the board via a socket, not soldered on like an embed.
as far as sbc that is a single board computer, it means everything needed to make a device a computing device is put onto one circuit board.
i am not interested in sbc, but i am pretty sure that the cell processor is not an embed.
