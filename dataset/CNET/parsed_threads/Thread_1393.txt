<s> I'm considering buying a LCD monitor w/ HDMI. </s>
<s> My question is, if the monitor has a HDMI input, can I plug it to DVD player and watch movies? </s>
<s> or does it have to be a monitor / TV? </s>
<s> the model I'm considering buying is the HP W2207h http://www.shopping.hp.com/product/display/display/1/storefronts/GM757AA%2523ABA would it be up for the job? </s>
<s> playing movies from the DVD? </s>
<s> you need to buy an HDMI-to-DVI cable or if you have the HDMI cable already, go get an HDMI-to-DVI adapter. </s>
