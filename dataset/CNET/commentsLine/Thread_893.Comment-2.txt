it wasn't a bad card and was a great last upgrade to our last agp machine.
your cards are even better but these do require some upgraded power supplies so be sure your machine has in the 500 watt or better power supply to avoid coming up short.
nice choices and look to see if tomshardware gave any benchmarks.
