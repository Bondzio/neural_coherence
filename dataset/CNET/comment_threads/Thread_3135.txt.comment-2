If you're running XP, the system OS sees that too much has changed or it appears so, thus the OS will not run/boot.
You need to re-install the OS, but that invalidates the OS as it was supplied, read the EULA.
You need a retail version of the OS, as the OEM version won't allow to install or be 100%.
Google away but the answer lies as I explained it, any other solution is outside your EULA provided.
