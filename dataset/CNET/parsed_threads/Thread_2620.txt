<s> Hello, Every so often my connection drops out on my network. </s>
<s> I have 3 comps connected through the router.Linksys BEFSR41 Firmware version 1.45.7 I just reset the router and it works fine. </s>
<s> I am using Win XP Pro VER 5.1 SP1 and a cable modem. </s>
<s> I have no other issues with any of the computers. </s>
<s> (win98se on both other comps.) </s>
<s> I have checked and my network connection details which look as below... </s>
<s> Physical Address: 00-0C-6B-1A-CC-63 IP Address: 192.168.1.100 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 DHCP Server: 192.168.1.1 Lease Obtained: 30/10/2003 5:39:33 PM Lease Expires: 31/10/2003 5:39:33 PM Is it normal for the lease to expire daily like this? </s>
<s> Has anyone had this type of issue? </s>
<s> Thanks Mike </s>
<s> Mike--don't know why your connection is dropping. </s>
<s> Have you called Linksys support yet? </s>
<s> I have to say that they are extremely helpful over the phone and very willing--no sighs or disdain, just good help. </s>
<s> The phone number should be at the back of your booklet or else go to their web site to tech support (if web access is available nearby, ie. </s>
<s> town library) </s>
<s> The lease is handed out by your ISP, not Linksys. </s>
<s> I have my Linksys connect on demand which seems to work fine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The lease time you want to adjust is the LAN side. </s>
<s> You can control that lease time, it on the password page of that router. </s>
<s> Turn off UPNP with in the router, that may stop it from locking up. </s>
<s> This router has a bad reputation of locking up. </s>
<s> Hopefully a new firmware up date will be out soon, as I have 6 of these units in place. </s>
<s> When 0 is equal to 1 day... what number should I set..? </s>
<s> Is it better to leave it on 0 (one day) or should I put a number of minutes? </s>
<s> Should I enable the 'Block WAN request' (default is off) Thanks </s>
<s> i would leave it at 0. i have enabled &quot;Block WAN requests&quot; on all my routers. </s>
<s> I found that this version firmware with this Router causes the problem. </s>
<s> Returned to original version which came with the router and all is well. </s>
<s> I should learn to leave well enough alone!!!! </s>
<s> Mike </s>
<s> what version is that? </s>
<s> i have version 4 and it sucks. </s>
<s> i cant get Gunz online to run on more that one pc at the same time in my internet cafe. </s>
<s> didnt have that problem before lightning took out my D-Link DI-704P router. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the store only had this crap of a router available,a Linksys BEFSR41. </s>
<s> It's been a week, and I still can't get the damn thing to do what i want it to, which is to let Gunz online be what it is, an online multiplayer game. </s>
<s> Another thing wrong with this piece of sh.... is the frequent disconnection problem. </s>
<s> What makes it worse is that you cant set the reconnect time to less than 20 seconds! </s>
<s> Soon as i get my DLink replacement, this junk will get my hammer award. </s>
<s> Or maybe somebody wanna router cheap? </s>
<s> I'll throw in some aspirins... </s>
<s> Is out of date firmware or possibly a tip from the router maker what firmware to install. </s>
<s> Many are under the impression that these products come ready to use. </s>
<s> Surprise! </s>
