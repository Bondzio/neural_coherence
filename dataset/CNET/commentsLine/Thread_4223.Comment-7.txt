i just want to say firefox has solved a lot of my browser issues.
(i was using the term &quot;browser&quot; wrong in the previous post, sorry).
i got rid of ie, and downloaded the latest firefox, imported my yahoo toolbar, etc...and wow!
things are soooooooooooooo much faster!!!
no hanging, no freezing!
amazing!!!!
i wish i knew about firefox before.
even the typing issues i've had in the past have gone away!
i knew it had something to do with my homepage, but i was assuming it was because of yahoo, not ie.
what makes firefox so superior to ie????
?
