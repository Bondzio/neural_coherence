It is a Socket 775 Motherboard, with a Pentium D, 3.4 GHz. First of all, its a 24-pin power supply slot in the motherboard, but I only have a 20-pin power supply connected. I've read that that shouldn't be a problem as long as I don't use any PCI cards, thus I haven't used any. However... Everything is hooked up as it should be, and it powers on and everything, but my monitor remains in standby mode. I tried to turn it off, and turn it back on, and that didn't work. I have no clue why the integrated graphics aren't working. Does anyone else know? So after this all happened, I put in a graphics card. However, the graphics slot is PCIe x16, and the only card that I have that will fit is a dual-DVI-E. No problem, I just bought a DVI to VGA converter. So I put that in, plug it all in, and it still doesn't work! This is driving me crazy, and I need to come up with a solution quick because this is my dads main computer.

Try a DVI or HDMI display next. For me to check further, I'll need MAKE and MODEL NUMBER on that &quot;Radeon HD2600Pro, 256MB DDR3&quot;.
