<s> An old lady asked me if there is any digital frame with internal memory beyond 4GB in order to put all of her entire photo collection in it. </s>
<s> Initially my answer to her was no. </s>
<s> Then I searched more and found no answers. </s>
<s> I was thinking the best tool for her would be a tablet. </s>
<s> Then, my questions to you are as follow: Q1- I wonder if anybody knows about any digital frame with 16GB internal memory? </s>
<s> I was not able to find any Digital Frame in Google or any other sites. </s>
<s> If the answer is no, then Q2- What is the cheapest tablet 10&quot; - 12&quot; LCD with 16GB internal memory? </s>
<s> I found the tablet NATPC with 16GB in Amazon. </s>
<s> The second choice is AlphaPad - Android 4.0 Tablet with 9.7 Inch IPS Capacitive Touchscreen (16GB, 1.2GHz, 2.0MP Camera, 1080p) Do you know any similar cheap tablets with 16GB or more? </s>
<s> I should mention she does not have any computer knowledge, and she primarily would like to use the tablet for viewing her images. </s>
<s> Q3- Is it possible to turn off all of the programes in the tablet except the photo section? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Given the price plunge of 16GB memory cards, why not any other tablet and your card? </s>
<s> All these questions can be answered by all these affiliate site like Amazon, ClickBank and others. </s>
<s> It is just that you try to use more time in browsing these sites Just spend more time on these sites. </s>
<s> That all </s>
