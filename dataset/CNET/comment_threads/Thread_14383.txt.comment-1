okay so i own a HP compaq nx9030 laptop.
I use to mave around alot with the laptop and now my USB ports do not work.
I could be wrong but i dont think it has anything to do with the operating system, because everytime im connected to the internet and i move the laptop it disconnects.
The USB ports actually move...so i was wondering if someone could PLEASE help me, i'm not ver familiar with these types a things.
THANK YOU in advance.
