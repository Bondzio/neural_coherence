vista itself is riddled with bugs so you should expect the hardware drivers for vista to be even buggier than the os itself, creative are the largest mainstream sound chip manufacturers for pc's.
if the creative drivers dont get along with vista dont expect vista to play nicely with anyone else.
yet another poor sucker that fell victim to microsoft marketing.
my advice, switch back to xp for 12 months until vista becomes a little less microsofty.
