12264	0	554561	5267196	NR	PiersonRon	1/29/12 2:54 AM	1.32780564E12	Old Gateway 2000 Computer	I am looking for an old Gateway 2000 desktop computer, preferrably with Windows 98. MUST have a Telepath II (14,400) modem and the Faxworks program that came with the computer. Doesn't have to look great; just run so I can replay some old sentimental voicemails of a deceased family member. For what it's worth, the one I had was a Pentium 75 with about 64mbs of RAM and a 720 mb hard drive. Doesn't have to match those numbers necessarily. Any suggestions???

I have limited knowledge of such things but done a fair amount of research and can't seem to find another solution. At this point, it seems easiest to try &amp; go back to the original setup with Windows 98 and Faxworks. I have the files on CD (along with an installed version of Faxworks) and also on my hard drive. Each .VMF file has a sister .CTL file. Two files with the same name, just different file extensions. Thanks for your interest!

His advice was to do as you are asking here. About all I can find is a suggestion that something called &quot;Iwave Media Player&quot; can handle that format. It also seems that the extension isn't unique to the voice mail program mentioned. I've found plenty of hits using google to search for converter programs for that format but none seem like solid leads. My guess is that you may have already explored many of these sites already. I don't think I can offer much help here but thought knowing the file format might be useful. Good luck in your efforts anyway.

It seems like a lot of hits on Google lead to nonexistant websites or have changed since the introduction of the inet wave player. However, someone, somewhere should have an archive of such things I would think they we we use data storage and archives. Thanks again for your interest. If you come accross anything that will help, please keep me in mind. P.S. I think it was suggested to try a Google's virtual machine ( or virtual box??) or something to that effect. Is this something you'd agree could work?
