came after he removed the jumper that seagate normally has on their 3.0 drives to force it to 150. it is possible that the system assembler had already had the jumper in the proper position and i fouled him up.
i tried to tell him that but he probably has some trouble with english.
he probably shouild first replace the jumper and then possibly you can suggest a speed test to run.
i think that his data seemed weird.
i wonder if the seagate diagnostic was run after the jumper change or before.
certainly he should give the exact text of the seagate diagnostic test results.
