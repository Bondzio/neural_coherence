I think this is possible but not sure how to do it. Switches are cheap but if I could save a few bucks with some tweaking I'd prefer that. Plus I figure I'd learn a bit about networking. Dlinks site on the DI-604: http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=62 My main problem is I have Uverse and I'm out of wired ports on the Residential Gateway. I would like 2 more ports to network my PC and NAS, so my laptop and Xbox can access their files.

How about this tutorial, looks detailed enough but I have never done this before and don't have a lot of networking experience. http://www.speedguide.net/articles/how-to-set-a-wireless-router-as-an-access-point-2556
