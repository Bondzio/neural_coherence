lets see if i can explain this right.
i now have one computer running xp hooked up with a ethernet cable to a links wireless router.
that router is hooked to dsl.
i have a second computer running me with a wireless usb adapter.
it works ok but at times seems very slow.
so i want to change the second computer (the one running me with the usb adapter) and hook it up with a ethernet cable.
what will i need to do besides installing the drivers for the networking card?
i hope i have given enough info.
if not i am sorry but will try to what ever else is needed.
thanks ahead of time.
