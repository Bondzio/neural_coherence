1.1.1	I 'm having an issue with my network adapter .	St
1.1.2	My daughter was surfing the web when she says the internet stopped .	St
1.1.3	I looked and the network adapter is not picking up the network from a router two feet away .	St
1.1.4	The wireless network is working fine - I can connect with the other three devices in the house .	St
1.1.5	But this CPU will not recognize the network .	St
1.1.6	I have updated the device drivers for the adapter and run a basic Windows diagnosis - it says the drivers are up to date and the device is operating properly .	St
1.1.7	I have also run anti-virus software just in case she picked up something while browsing .	St
1.1.8	What am I missing ?	Ques
1.2.1	but i ca n't connect to the internet ... it 's weird .	St
1.2.2	what is the problem ? ?	Ques
1.2.3	if anyone knows..help me plz	St
1.3.1	You said the wireless network is fine so shall we presume this one is wired ?	Ques
1.3.2	If so , how far from the device is from the router does n't much matter .	St
1.3.3	If wired , have you tried to ping the gateway ?	Ques
1.3.4	If not , you could try that but first check to see if you have a proper IP address .	Sug
1.3.5	If using Windows , you type & quot ; ipconfig & quot ; ( without quotes ) from the command prompt .	St
1.3.6	It should show several sets of numbers .	St
1.3.7	One will be the gateway address and another will be the IP address of the network adapter ( s ) .	St
1.3.8	If ping returns and error , the easiest thing to do would be the try a new cable .	St
1.3.9	See what more information you can provide and post back .	St
1.4.1	What exactly does the computer show or say ?	Ques
1.4.2	My guess is that there is some basic physical connection to a wireless router but that it shows as & quot ; limited or no connectivity & quot ; .	St
1.4.3	Limited connectivity means that it 's not the full connectivity needed to go through the router to the public internet .	St
1.4.4	Usually this means that the PC did n't get it 's IP-address from the router for some reason .	St
1.4.5	And that reason usually is some error in the configuration of either the PC or the router .	St
1.4.6	That 's not weird , because it 's a rather comples area as soon as something is wrong .	St
1.4.7	But there might be other causes .	St
1.4.8	For example , the ISP might have shut down the connection because you did n't pay .	St
1.4.9	Or the cable outside your house is damaged .	St
1.4.10	I 've seen many people without Internet for a month or more , while the ISP tried to fix what was broken with them , especially if they had accepted an offer like & quot ; Make your internet faster .	St
1.4.11	Add interactive TV .	St
1.4.12	Add VOIP .	St
1.4.13	Save money .	St
1.4.14	Excellent service .	St
1.4.15	Highly capable techs .	St
1.4.16	Sign here and enjoy next week & quot ; .	St
1.4.17	- Please tell more about your connection ( wired , wireless ? ) .	Sug
1.4.18	- Did it ever work ?	Ques
1.4.19	- If wireless , does it work wired ?	Ques
1.4.20	- Does it work elsewhere ( if wireless and a laptop ) ?	Ques
1.4.21	- Does another PC or laptop work with you ?	Ques
1.4.22	- Finally , run ipconfig /all from the command prompt and post the full output in your answer .	St
1.4.23	Kees	St
1.5.1	No , this adapter is a wireless adapter card installed on a desktop CPU .	St
1.5.2	I am currently trying to bridge a connection from the laptop via USB to see if maybe the card is damaged ?	Ques
1.6.1	We know Norton can do this when it expires .	St
1.6.2	There are some models of laptops that do this too often .	St
1.6.3	And some laptops have a wifi on/off feature/button .	St
1.6.4	Tell more .	St
