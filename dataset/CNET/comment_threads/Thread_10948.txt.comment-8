It could be that some specific driver files for the card have become corrupted.
I seem to remember something like that happening to a friend of mine, however, I can't quite remember how he resolved the issue.
Probably by removing/replacing the corrupted driver files and then re-installing the card.
I also seem to remember something about video card and monitor conflicts...but in that case I don't think the card would've worked at all.
