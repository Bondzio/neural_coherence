well the reason i ask is, i am afraid of the consequences of screwing it up.
(i am reasonably experienced but i've never done this particular task before, and many people [and bios websites] have told me not to do it if not absolutely necessary) i guess if the power stays on it should be okay.
are there any tricks to it other than reading the instructions?
will a bios upgrade allow me to use bigger than 30 gb drives?
(which i currently cannot use?)
i have a soyo 6ba+ and a 6ba +iii.
fyi, tiger direct sells 30 gb seagates for about $60.
thanks fj
