<s> I've been researching alot of web cams and reading many reviews the past few days. </s>
<s> However, I can not find a web cam that is affordable and able to transmit video at night. </s>
<s> Can someone help me? </s>
<s> I've already ordered one web cam from Logitech, because it seem to generate great reviews and able to work in dimmed light. </s>
<s> Is there any other cams that is able to deliver great video quality in dimmed and/or total dark? </s>

<s> Cameras work with light. </s>
<s> Sorry to go over the obvious but some miss that. </s>
<s> So total darkness is not an option. </s>
<s> For this we use IR Illuminators and black&white cameras. </s>
<s> You may have to skip the USB web cam for such a specific application and use some video capture port and the right cameras. </s>
<s> Here's one example. </s>

<s> Add IR light if you want to really see in the dark. </s>
