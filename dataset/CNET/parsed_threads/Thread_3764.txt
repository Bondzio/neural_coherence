<s> Alright...I have recentely built a computer and am having early trouble. </s>
<s> I have a p4 3.0e, 1024 of ram, 6600gt vcard, asus P4800SE, a harddrive from a dell( ATA IV seagate barracuda), and a cd/rw drive from the dell, and a floppy from the dell. </s>
<s> My computer recognizes the p4, ram, vcard...but i keep getting an error message &quot;Primary Slave Drive - ATAPI Incompatible&quot; My harddrive was quick formated, and I have not installed windows, due to the fact that I can not. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance </s>

<s> Try unplugging that. </s>
<s> Any chance that you have the drives improperly jumpered?? </s>
<s> Or using cable select and have them plugged into the incorrect connectors? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> the Master [boot drive] as the problem, can't you simply proceed?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Using one IDE port or two...or simply just how is your IDE ports being used with the devices attached? </s>
