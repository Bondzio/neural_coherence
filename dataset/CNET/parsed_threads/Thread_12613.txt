<s> My son has a rather new Gateway with a celeron processor, 256 RAM and running Won XP home. </s>
<s> Very little has been added - a file sharing program of course. </s>
<s> It ran pretty fast out of the box, but is now slow - even opening the control panel is slow. </s>
<s> I don't think a celeron should run slow like this, but who knows. </s>
<s> We have defragmented, all windows updates are current and same for Norton Anti-Virus. </s>
<s> Anyone have any tips for speeding this thing up? </s>
<s> Most install any number of spyware that slows a machine to a crawl. </s>

<s> You'll want to be parasite free with clean passes by Spybot, Adaware, Cwshredder and Housecall. </s>

<s> Thank you - can you explain a little more about how one becomes parasite free? </s>
<s> The programs I listed do a fine job in a nearly automatic way. </s>
<s> Each has been used by many (just check in the Security Forum) with little to no loss besides the pests. </s>
<s> The list is one that is very safe to use with the supplied defaults. </s>
