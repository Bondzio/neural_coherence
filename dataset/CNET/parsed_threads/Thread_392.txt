<s> Does the NB255 use a SATA hard drive, I think it does ? </s>
<s> And is there a limit to hard drive capacity on the 255 ? </s>
<s> I might try a 500gb HD. </s>
<s> Also, HD thickness ? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> If you research the tool BELARC ADVISOR it can list the make and model of the existing drive as well as other machine and software details. </s>
<s> Armed with the drive make and model you could answer the question about SATA. </s>
