<s> Has anyone on the forum bought or used the Toshiba Thrive? </s>
<s> I have been waiting for a tablet that has USB2, HDMI and a SD slot and it appears the Thrive has them all plus a replaceable battery. </s>
<s> Before I retired I worked for a Toshiba dealer, but that was Key Telephones and PBX systems and those systems were excellent... That is the reason my laptop is a Toshiba, just because of the name. </s>
<s> I plan on going to Bestbuy tomorrow as they now have them in stock and I can get a hands on one, but would like to get some thoughts if anyone has used one. </s>
<s> Thanks Wayne </s>

<s> I'm guessing here you are trying to avoid a laptop. </s>
<s> So far, that's a painful lesson. </s>

<s> That link told me a lot before I actually pick one up and play around with it. </s>
<s> I am not trying to substitute a tablet for a laptop. </s>
<s> I have a very nice laptop which I plan on keeping. </s>
<s> My main reason for the Tablet is because I will be doing a lot of traveling starting this summer and really don't want to haul my laptop around. </s>
<s> It will give me something to do on those long flights other than reading all those magazines the airlines stuff in the seat in front of you. </s>
<s> Another reason for the Toshiba is I still get a discount through my old company on Toshiba products. </s>
<s> http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-toshiba-thrive/6260686?tag=nl.e099 If I wanted such a tablet I might opt for the new dual boot Windows and Android thing instead to get more use from it. </s>
<s> Tipping my hand I am in a company porting apps to android and get to play with a few more units that some folk however this model is just out and doesn't stand out in any way for us to ask for one. </s>
<s> Some folk are returning pads as they discover what they are not or that it's video file compatibility isn't what folk expected. </s>
<s> Tip: I use Handbrake and settings found on the net for the tablet in question. </s>
<s> How to sum it up? </s>
<s> Android tablets seem needy when it comes to care and feeding. </s>

<s> I just recently got the thrive as a birthday gift. </s>
<s> It was something I have been researching for a long time! </s>
<s> I LOVE IT! </s>
<s> The functionality is great, I dont have to haul my laptop around and I can use it for all of my school work... </s>
<s> I can put my sd card from my camera in it to look at pictures and email them, the USB is a big plus in my opinion and I use it constantly and the battery lasts really well... </s>
<s> The only issue I have had is finding the right silverlight download for it... Kim </s>
<s> Owned it for about a month now. </s>
<s> Absolutely delighted! </s>
<s> Primary uses are looking at Email and the Web while watching TV. </s>
<s> Battery lasts for 5 days with moderate usage. </s>
<s> Discovered several additional uses that I had never intended, such as using it as a GPS Navigator in the car! </s>
<s> Still experimenting with additional Android tablet apps. </s>
<s> Much more useful than I had originally thought, and way cheaper than the iPad that I originally looked at. </s>
<s> Love the full-size ports and the ability to easily replace the battery myself if and when it becomes necessary. </s>
