<s> A bit of a newbie question - I have a Linksys WRT54G and a single computer, a wifi-enabled laptop. </s>
<s> Is it possible after going through the setup wizard, to simply have the wifi router connected directly to the modem, without the ethernet cable to a computer, so I can use wifi to my laptop? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> A broadband modem connected directly to a broadband router does not need a host computer connected. </s>
<s> In your case, you just make the wireless connection when you desire. </s>
<s> Just remember to make administrative changes to the router using a network cable. </s>
<s> Internet --- modem --- router --- computers * * * * * If your setup is for Internet Connection Sharing (ICS), then you need a host computer to be connected at all times. </s>
<s> Internet --- modem --- host computer -- router --- other computers </s>
<s> That's great. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
