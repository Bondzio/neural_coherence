<s> I have a &quot;Simple Drive&quot; external hard drive with USB port. </s>
<s> I have used it on Windows XP Home, Windows XP Pro, and now Windows 7. </s>
<s> From time to time, it just vanishes. </s>
<s> I have tried unplugging and replugging the USB cord with no luck. </s>
<s> In the past, I have restarted each computer and it has come back. </s>
<s> Last night, I unplugged the electric cord and plugged it back in, and it came back. </s>
<s> This problem has existed on all four computers I've used it on. </s>
<s> Is there a way to get my current computer to just be friends with it and remember it? </s>
<s> It has a defect and should not be trusted. </s>
<s> Get your files out and contact the maker to get it repaired under warranty. </s>
<s> The Cnet Storage Forum is full of this sort of problems and the answer is simple. </s>
<s> Don't trust a flaky unit. </s>
