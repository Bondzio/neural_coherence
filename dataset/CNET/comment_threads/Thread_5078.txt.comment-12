good latencies are needed for performance with AMD K7 systems with Intel and AMD K8 systems the latency doesn't matter as much as the bandwidth does in addition no, 2GB of RAM is not a good idea it's worthless also, the &quot;OC&quot; version your thinking of is the BFG it's their own version XFX's &quot;Max OC&quot; version clocks in at 490 it'd be worth the purchase if the RAM is the correct spec to do 1300MHZ (meaning a lower ns rating = it can clock higher) the thing to think about the 6800 Ultra Extreme Edition's were clocked faster yet usually overclocked to a lesser degree than 6800 Ultra's could i'd suggest a normal 7800GTX to save money mainly also QA = Quality Assurance
