1.1.1	Hi , I have an external WD Passport with 120GB of storage , formatted as FAT32 .	St
1.1.2	Somewhere on this forum I heard that FAT32 storage is bad because it can break more easily then NTFS .	St
1.1.3	Should I reformat the WD passport as NTFS , what exactly is the difference .	St
1.1.4	To do this I 'm guessing you Right Click -- & gt ; format -- & gt ; OK ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	You can use disk managment to convert FAT32 to NTFS , ( it does not work in reverse ! )	St
1.2.2	Apart from being more reliable , if my old memory serves me correctly , FAT32 uses 32kb clusters and NTFS uses 4kb .	St
1.2.3	What that means to you is , if you have a file in FAT32 1kb in size it actually uses 32kb of hdd space , whereas an NTFS file of the same size would only use 4kb .	St
1.2.4	If the above is not correct , no doubt Bob or someone else will give the correct figures .	St
1.2.5	In advance , I claim old age for my memory deficiancies .	St
1.3.1	the only advantage of fat32 is the disk can be moved between systems easier .	St
1.3.2	sometimes ntfs volumes have to be imported ( they 're considered foreign ) .	St
1.3.3	a fat32 disk can be moved to practically any pc or os without issue .	St
1.4.1	and it seems to caution against NTFS because : * Data can not easily be recovered * File system structure can not be manually checked and repaired * Malware can not be scanned for and cleaned http : //cquirke.mvps.org/ntfs.htm	St
1.5.1	Every week I have someone at the office show up with a corrupted Fat32 volume .	St
1.5.2	It 's too prone to damage .	St
1.5.3	Just do this .	St
1.5.4	Copy a file to it and then yank the USB cord .	St
1.5.5	Our NTFS volumes survive and I can kill the Fat32 volumes on demand .	St
1.5.6	Yes we can format them and start over but where 's the fun in that ?	Ques
1.5.7	Bob	St
1.6.1	formatting have an effect on how stable the data is ?	Ques
1.6.2	Is this just your experience or is this because of the new technology of NTFS ?	Ques
1.7.1	I leave it to you to research file systems but let 's highlight the basic issue .	St
1.7.2	NTFS is damage resistant ( not damage proof . )	St
1.7.3	Fat32 is very compatible but suffers from not having any resiliency to most damage .	St
1.7.4	Hey , it 's YOUR choice here .	St
1.7.5	I will not spend 20 posts telling you all the reasons and duplicating web pages .	St
1.7.6	How important is your data and your time ?	Ques
1.7.7	Bob	St
1.8.1	I plan on reformating the drive as ntfs , the problem is that I need to transfer the data temporarily to another drive , and the other external drive looks like it is failing , so I am just going to buy another external hd and use that as a dual backup .	St
1.8.2	Also people on this forum have convinced me that backing up to a dvd is also a good idea .	St
1.9.1	you can convert to ntfs on-the-fly .	St
1.9.2	How to convert a FAT16 volume or a FAT32 volume to an NTFS file system in Windows XP	St
1.10.1	I deleted your post .	St
1.10.2	Sorry , no advertising in these forums .	St
1.10.3	Mark	St
1.11.1	Is it true that a hard drive formatted in FAT32 can only hold files that are 4GB or less ?	Ques
1.11.2	I 've experienced this in the past when transferring videos and have changed my external drives to NTFS .	St
1.12.1	That is correct .	Res
1.12.2	The FAT32 filesystem only supports files 4GB or smaller ( 4GB less 2 bytes if you want to be technical ) .	St
1.13.1	Why do they make it so that the new tvs pretty much have to use hdd in fat32 or wont load sometimes / freeze etc ... when I want to play saved dvd , blue-ray , and personally recorded game vids that trump the file size ... Is there some better way I am suppose to go about this or suffer without a , larger files or b , not being able to get to data 1/4 the time ... ?	Ques
1.14.1	There are TWO hurdles to get support for such file systems .	St
1.14.2	1 .	St
1.14.3	Microsoft Licensing and fees .	St
1.14.4	It 's not cheap , and may not be easy .	St
1.14.5	2 .	St
1.14.6	Microsoft has been pretty tip lipped about NTFS over the years .	St
1.14.7	Most of what was created in Linux was done via reverse engineering .	St
1.14.8	And while the other file systems do exist , if you used them on the TV the users would blow up at you for using them .	St
1.14.9	Bob	St
