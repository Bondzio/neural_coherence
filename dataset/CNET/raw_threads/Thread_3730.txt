I mostly use it for school work, and so over the years (I'm graduating soon) I've accumlulated quite a bit of data and information. I also like to play games on it, but have hit a wall because I cannot install any new games because there is no more space on my internal hard drive. Can I run/play games off of my external hard drive? Meaning I would install the program files onto the hard drive. I'm assuming there wouldn't be an issue but just though I'd check.... Thanks.

Once you've done that, then pursue the game initiative. Gaming will put a lot of additional stress on your laptop so take the time to protect your data before you start. Keep in mind data in only once place ... an internal hard drive or especially an external hard drive, it just a second away from complete, permanent loss. Hope this helps. VAPCMD PS...Putting games on an external...you can. Would I recommend it ..no ! Why .... not matter where you install the app ... Windows apps will almost always put at least some files on your C: drive. Perhaps you should consider getting a much larger hard drive for your laptop.
