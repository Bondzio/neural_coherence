Sadly your posts are incomplete so replies fail to get to the answers since you haven't made a good complete post. Solve one issue at a time. Such as that bridge. To try to solve the printer and the bridge at the same time will usually be too hard. Bob

Proffitt	8/28/08 1:56 PM	1.21993176E12	Looks grim.	http://support.dlink.com/emulators/dwlg810/wireless.html I see from it's setup that this is not going to be easy enough for me to solve here. While I have setup these things, unless I was privy to every detail it's too likely what I didn't know had an error. Find a local network guru and offer pizza and cherry coke and accolades to get this all working. In closing I used this one -&gt; WGPS606 (see google.com) Its instructions are no better but since I used to write embedded web servers and routers a long time ago it wasn't all that hard to see what they wanted me to do.

Now I use ethernet to the bridge and follow the directions. I'm not privy to what you may have changed on the bridge so let me note that I use the bridge's defaults and only set the SSID and password word to the wifi network I want to connect to. Remember not to lock down any IP here. We want to get it to work as a bridge first. Good luck. Bob
