I'm looking at buying a new computer and I am thinking of getting a Hewlett Pakard, specifically the HP Pavilion a1230n (Athlon 65 3700).
I was wondering what people think of HP's; I've heard rumours from some people that they cut a lot of corners, but others are really happy with them.
Are they reliable computers, or should I look elsewhere?
I'm thinking of getting a custom built computer too, but that would be a bit more expensive and I don't know if it would be worth it.
