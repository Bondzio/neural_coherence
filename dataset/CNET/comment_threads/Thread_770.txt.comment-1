My printer has suddenly decided to cut off items that I print from the internet or emails.
Sometimes it's just the first couple of letters on the left side, other times it can be 3 to 5 words on the left side.
I don't know why it is doing this and I have tried and checked everything I can think of to get it to print everything.
There must be something I'm overlooking and if anyone can help me I'd sure appreciate it!
I use Windows 98 on an IBM clone.
