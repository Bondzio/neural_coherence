<s> Recently my computer has been crashing for no apparent reason. </s>
<s> I originally thought that the processor was overheating so I vacuumed out the cooling fan on the CPU. </s>
<s> I also vacuumed the power supply box. </s>
<s> I've reformatted the hard drive and reloaded Windows XP SP2. </s>
<s> I also replaced the network card after the crashes started. </s>
<s> It worked fine for about 4 days and then started crashing again. </s>
<s> I have 1GHz of memory and a 1.86GHz processor. </s>
<s> A local computer store ran some utility programs on it. </s>
<s> They didnt find any problems. </s>
<s> Im stumped at this point. </s>
<s> It usually happens after a lot of applications have been used. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any suggestions that you may have. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Is this one of those old Socket A systems? </s>
<s> As they age you might find some BAD CAPS (see google.com) and the fix is to replace the boards with the bad caps. </s>
<s> I can assure you the reason for the crash is not revealed in your post. </s>
<s> The clues are not there. </s>
<s> Keep telling more and try to tell about your PC since you may not have 1 GHz of memory. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> I meant gigabyte of memory. </s>
<s> I hadn't thought about a bad cap on the motherboard. </s>
<s> I need to research it further. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
