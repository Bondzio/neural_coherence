I have an HP 7160 Media Center PC, (old, I know, but good enough, not ready to upgrade yet) Comcast cable modem, and linksys WRPT54G broadband router.(2 phone ports, wired ports, wireless) I am constantly disconnected from the internet, have to get up to go across the house to unplug/replug/reset the router so much I count it as &quot;exercise.&quot; It takes forever to do anything on the net. If I had a more constant connection, I might find time to actually do some REAL exercising! (-: What router should I buy to replace it? Thanks for your suggestions. Synthia
