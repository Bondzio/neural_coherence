<s> My hard disk and graphics card seem to get quite hot after only a few minutes of operation. </s>
<s> My PC has been suffering from overheating problems for a few weeks now and I have installed a new fan, but the problem still persists (the PC will turn off after things get 'too' hot). </s>
<s> My graphics card, is so hot that I can't actually touch it (in operation) without getting a slight burn! </s>
<s> The hard disk is not as hot, but still feels unnecessarily hot. </s>
<s> Is this normal? </s>
<s> The problem ceases when I use a household fan, so should I invest in a more expensive, more powerful fan? </s>
<s> If so, should it act as an 'exhaust' or should it blow in air? </s>
<s> I only have space for a fan at the back on the top, just under the PSU. </s>
<s> Apologies for the rather long post, and any help would be greatly appreciated Thanks, Marc </s>
<s> The machine's maker? </s>
<s> Some smaller shops don't test for proper airflow or skimp on a needed fan. </s>
<s> You didn't tell if you are the designer. </s>
<s> If so, you get to solve heat buildup issues if your case fails to expel the heat. </s>
<s> Common fixes are to cut new exhaust holes, fit a few more fans or just leave the case cover off. </s>
<s> There is no ready to use formula for this, but I endorse making the system maker aware of the issue and letting them resolve it (as no cost) first. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't know if you've heard of &quot;Tiny&quot;... they were a UK-based company that didn't too well, so I'm no longer covered by them. </s>
<s> In any case, I'm well past my guarantee's duration. </s>
<s> A friend has told me it may be the motherboard that is messed up, but I can't afford investing in that so I'm likely to just buy a couple of more fans. </s>
<s> I have tried leavin the cover off but that hasn't solved it. </s>
<s> The bad motherboard capacitors issue is one that creates a lot of heat and issues. </s>
<s> You should inspect for this issue since fans won't cure it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> also a place for a front fan. </s>
<s> This should pull air in. </s>
<s> The rear fan should be an exhaust. </s>
<s> For the rear fan, and your problem put in a 92MM fan if possible. </s>
<s> Seems that you may in England, else I could point you to a fan at cyberguys that is a very high rpm fan. </s>
<s> remember high rpm = more noise. </s>
<s> Yes video cards get hot as hades. </s>
<s> You need to dress the cables to make a minimum of restriction to airflow. </s>
<s> You could also use more of a dynamic flow of air, by cutting a hole in the side panel, more of less in line with the CPU/HSF, and install a fan that blows air in. </s>
<s> This will stir things up. </s>
<s> If your system is shutting down due to heat look your CPU's HSF over closely. </s>
<s> It may not be rotating fast enough. </s>
<s> If the top of the case were readily accessible placing an exhaust fan in it is a very effective solution. </s>
<s> I wish there was, but there isn't... </s>
<s> I've been told I have a crap case! </s>
<s> I guess it's true... before, I could have a household fan blowing into it and that would stop the blue screen from appearing, but just now it seems to have happened again even with this fan blowing in. </s>
<s> It appears the problem is getting worse and worryingly more frequent Now I'm concerned this isn't even an overheating problem since my previous temporary solution doesn't even work now! </s>
<s> I've replaced the PSU, and a friend of mine will lend me a processor and graphics card so that I can work out if it's anything to do with those. </s>
<s> This same friend suggested it could be a problem with the motherboard, and I'm not looking fwd to replacing that! </s>
<s> Any tips on replacing a motherboard? </s>
<s> securely to the CPU??? </s>
<s> I have just run into two cases where one of the platic clips broke and reduced the tension between the HSF and CPU [yes actually it is compression, the tension is in the clips. </s>
<s> LOL]. </s>
<s> Wht type mobo?? </s>
<s> Is it a micro ATX??? </s>
<s> They have a great dea;l at newegg every few days for an Aspire case with 350 watt supply $58 and free shipping. </s>
<s> If installing mobo into a new case, we can provide that info. </s>
<s> For putting in an existing case, we can also help. </s>
<s> just some differences to discuss. </s>
<s> If your CPU is getting too hot, I'm not keen on blaming it on the mobo. </s>
<s> Was thermal compound put between the HSF base and the CPU surface??? </s>
<s> Any chance that the HSF is on 180 degrees out?? </s>
<s> The CPU is NOT centered on the HSF, there is only one CORRECT orientation for the HSF. </s>
<s> See http://www.2cooltek.com/blow2.html for a step by step guide to blowholes. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The HSF is definitely clamped securely to the CPU, and the mobo is a micro ATX, but like you suggested, it might not be the mobo and I should try out other things 1st I'm not sure what thermal compound is but there was a sticky-ish white residue both on the HSF base and CPU surface... what does that mean? </s>
<s> I'm sure that the orientation of both the CPU and HSF is fine, since there is only one way they can fit. </s>
<s> That blowhole idea looked interesting... scary but interesting! </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Get a turbine fan its a fan that uses a PCI port to suck air out. </s>
<s> If your graphic card constantly over heats, seat one of these fans on the port above your graphic card. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Make sure your Graphics Card has a Heatsink AND a fan on top of the heatsink If it doesnt, you can pick up a small fan at a computer junk store or at stores like Fry's Electronics. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> You need more then one fan and your Powersupply doesnt really count as a system fan. </s>
<s> Try to have atleast one fan sucking air in and sucking air out. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> To really know how hot your computer is getting when your running windwos [and can't access the bios] get a PC Monitoring System like Cooler Masters: Aerogate II. </s>
<s> Not only does it let you monitor the air temperature of 4 seperate computer componenets such as CPU, Graphic Board, Hard Drive, and Case {in general}, it also acts as a fan controller. </s>
<s> It even tell you how fast your fans are spinning [rpm] and lets you adjust that speed. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> If your case cant support more then 1 fan, trying looking at new cases. </s>
<s> Most new mid ranged cases [$50-$80] today can support beyond 2 fans. </s>
<s> My XDreamer Case can support 5 fans: 1 on the side, 2 in the front, 1 in the back, and 1 on the top of the case [sunroof]. </s>
<s> Really shouldn't be oozing out but??? </s>
<s> Thethermakl paste coating should be very thin. </s>
<s> Too big a glob can cause to impede heat transfer rather than help it. </s>
<s> Maybe get another HSF with a larger HS and faster fan [more noise LOL][make sure it will fit. </s>
<s> It just seems that possibly the fan might not be running fast enough. </s>
<s> The micro ATX case is rather small so I can see why cooling can be a problem. </s>
<s> The fact that case open and external fan didn't keep it cool enough, does sound unusual. </s>
<s> Don't have too powerful a fan [your house fan] blow directly at the CPU's HSF because it could actually slow the HSF down. </s>
<s> Have it blow on the video card and memory sticks. </s>
<s> There are other reasons for a system shutting down. </s>
<s> One is the bulging or leaking capacitors. </s>
<s> I have one awaiting a decision on what to put in it. </s>
<s> Too much overkill for what I have built lately. </s>
<s> my pc does this too i dunno what to do i have a normal fan home fan on it as well and it still over heats ive bought this week a new fan. </s>
<s> my pc gets to about 50degrees 122 farentheit is it actually heat that makes it crash im not sure but ill update you when i got my new fan. </s>
<s> chow </s>
<s> you should allow the interior air of the case get over 100 F. What room temperature do you live in??? </s>
<s> When you talk temperature let's be very specific whether we are talking CPU temp or internal ambient air. </s>
<s> If you have 122 F ambient internal something is drastically wrong. </s>
<s> You have virtually no airflow. </s>
<s> Any chance that the fans are fighting each other rather than creating airflow?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> The first thing I'd check is the air temp that your power supply is pumping out. </s>
<s> The power supply is probably, depending on the config, the biggest producer of ambient air temp increase inside your case. </s>
<s> Most people fail to realize that an extremely dirty power supply willl produce far more heat than a clean one, and if it's a single fan unit, the cooling effect of the fan maybe insufficient. </s>
<s> If you have more than just the power supply venting air to the outside, check the temp of the air the other fans are expelling. </s>
<s> The power supply should be the only expelling fan with a temp markedly warmer than room temp. </s>
<s> Being a bit of a cooling freak (I have sixteen rotating fans and a water block cooler in my Thermaltake Xaser II) my suggestion to anyone is to start with a reputable dual fan PSU. </s>
