go ahead and throw it out the window.
but, before that try repeated cleanings as many as 10x or more.
yes, that will use alot of ink.
however, if you really don't want to spend money on ink then buy a replacement as a &quot;on sale&quot; printer may be as close as the ink carts cost.
now, next time use epson ink(costs alot, consider your past experience) and if it ever goes dry, install a new ink cart quickly.
epson printers work great when they do and just are a pita when they don't, imho and i don't recommend them.
