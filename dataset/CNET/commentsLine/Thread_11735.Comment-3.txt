i havent bought a machine for 5years so i really appreciate any advice!
anyone have specific experience with the athlon ii x2?
or the ati 3000 onboard video?
i really like this machine but don't want to find out it cant display my .mkv or .mp4 videos smoothly.
also is there something else out there that i might be overlooking?
some things that i don't know anything about would be: hd, blue ray, usb 3.0, new pci standards...&lt;div&gt; thanks again!
&lt;/div&gt;
