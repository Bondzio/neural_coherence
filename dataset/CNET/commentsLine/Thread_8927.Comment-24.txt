i am using a 20&quot; wide format dell fpw2005 for my gaming pc and it is incredibly smooth.
one thing to remember when buying a flat panel for gamin is to have 16ms or better on the response time or you will see ghosting.
i chose the dell for a few reasons a) it is using the same lcd panel as the apple cinema series monitors.
the panel is made by lg.
2) the price was unbeatable on the size.
was able to find a deal on  that allowed me to pick this monitor up for a little over $400.
now this is the price range that you can get a fairly decent 19&quot; from samsung with a 12ms response.
and 3) the clarity was unbeatible on my radeon card.
and it allows you to hook up 2 pcs and a few other devices on it's 4 inputs.
