<s> I am new in the market for an external hard drive. </s>
<s> I have a dell computer w/ xp pro operating system. </s>
<s> This is for office use. </s>
<s> My question is if this hard drive is right for me. </s>
<s> Can it copy my entire system (programs, operating system, data) or do I still need to purchase software (Acronis, Norton Ghost)? </s>
<s> My need is for disaster recovery. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> CMS BounceBack Pro is also good for tracking folders and changes to them, It also includes a rescue disk. </s>
<s> Available thru Dell software. </s>
