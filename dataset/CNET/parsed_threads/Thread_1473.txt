<s> I recently upgraded my computer from ASUS Motherboard and Intel 1.8 to a new ASUS MOBO and Intel 2.8. now when i went into the device manager, it has exclamation marks next to: system timer, system speaker, Direct memory access controller, system CMOS/real time clock and numeric data processor. </s>
<s> I am running WIN ME, 512 DDR, and 64 bit video card. </s>
<s> can anyone tell me what all these exclamation marksmean and how to fix these? </s>
<s> I have gone into the BIOS but i dont see anything there that looks out of the ordinary. </s>
<s> please help. </s>
<s> if possible, you can email me at zena3546@aol.com. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Download current drivers. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Did this new mobo come with a cd? </s>
<s> If so and with a little luck if you place it in your cd reader unit it will auto play and present you with a nice menu to load the mobo drivers. </s>
<s> If you can do that then many if not all of those exclamation marks will go away. </s>
<s> Be aware that the drivers on the cd may be quite old so a trip to the mobo makers site to check for updates would be a good thing to do. </s>
<s> Upgrade to XP or reinstall Windows ME. </s>
