1.1.1	The case I aquired has a LCD panel to indicate temperature labeled CPU , HDD , & VGA .	St
1.1.2	How are these best positioned ?	Ques
1.1.3	CPU : at the base ( side ) of the heat sink ?	Ques
1.1.4	HDD : On the drive itself or near the Controller IC ?	Ques
1.1.5	VGA : Controller IC ?	Ques
1.1.6	I am hoping someone has experience with these devices and can advise what is considered optimum use .	St
1.1.7	Thanks , rbul	St
1.2.1	Virtually all mobos have a thermistor located in the CPU socket that is probably the best place to sense CPU temp .	St
1.2.2	Your BIOS probably reads it and you can download speed fan to read it in real time .	St
1.2.3	Google it .	St
1.2.4	For your sensor , maybe have the sensor about 1 inch above the hub of the CPU fan .	Sug
1.2.5	Both AMD and Intel recco the temp there to be under 38C for their heat sinks .	St
1.2.6	This gives a high but in spec CPU temp , thus adjust your air flow/fans to get that well below that temp .	St
1.2.7	If I had such an item [ mine only has one sensor ] .	St
1.2.8	I would simply move them around every now and then and get a temp profile of the interior temps in the case .	St
1.2.9	If you go to a new hotter en hades video card you certainly want to be sure that the air is moving through that section .	St
1.2.10	[ VGA should be considered to be the video cards ATI or Nvidia chip on the card , if you have a card . ] .	St
1.2.11	Once you establish the steady state temps at the various locations , they wo n't change unless you change the airflow situation .	St
1.2.12	Of course they will also move up and down with your room ambient temp .	St
1.3.1	Thank You Ray !	St
1.3.2	Just the 3 probes , all connected to the LCD front panel .	St
1.4.1	What products are used to afix heat sensors to pcb 's , HDD 's & CPU 's ?	Ques
1.4.2	Tape , gum adhesive , what 's available ?	Ques
