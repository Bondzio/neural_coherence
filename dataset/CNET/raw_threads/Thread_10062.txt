Hey everyone, not only is this my first build but it's also my first dream PC, so I'm really trying to get everything right the first time. My budget is $2250 so here is a list of what I'm looking for. Some I've found specific items, but feel free to suggest otherwise if you think there's a better choice! Case: Zalman GS1000 http://www.zalman.co.kr/ENG/product/Product_Read.asp?idx=310 Motherboard: ASUS P6T, the only diff between this and the Deluxe 2 is 12 vs 24 Gb RAM? CPU: Intel i7, but I've heard the Core 2 duo is the best? Help here.. RAM: Around 12-18Gb, what's the best quality RAM for least money? HDD: Around 2 Tb, I'm thinking 2 Seagates of 500Gb each GPU: I want SLI with 2 cards for starters, I was advised two NVidia GTX 280's or 285's? Advice needed PSU: Kingwin Mach 1 Modular Power Supply - 1000-Watt? Monitors: Two Samsung 23&quot; 16:9 LCDs Drives: Blu-ray is a must, I'd LIKE to have burning ability but if price hits the mark, I'll cut this option for just read only Accessories: Quality mouse, keyboard, and 5.1 speaker set Thanks in advance for any help!!

I'd pick the GPU from this list: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-geforce-price,2323.html About RAM. Still can't see any increase in speed past 2GB here. Maybe Windows 7 will address this. My kid just picked up the 23 inch Samsung. You'll like that except that is a lot of desk space. Get out the tape measure. Bob
