<s> Can I connect two pcs on lan using just a LAN cord? </s>
<s> The 8 wires in the cord have some extra wires. </s>
<s> You could split the pairs at both ends of a single cord to connect to 2 ports of a router, then that single cord can run to your PCs and split again to the 2 PCs. </s>
<s> But that's a lot of wiring just to avoid running a second cable. </s>

<s> Um... couldn't I just connect them just connecting one end to each ethernet port? </s>
<s> There are CROSSOVER CABLES (google.com) that you can do that. </s>
<s> Great for fast file transfers. </s>

<s> okay ignore him, the answer, yes, just make sure its a crossover network cable, just go in2 ur local place where u buy cables (i have no idea of store names in america) ask 4 a cross over cable, buy it, and plug it in2 the backs of ur 2 computers, no splicing or rewiring of cables required, I have no idea where this guy got that idea :S </s>
