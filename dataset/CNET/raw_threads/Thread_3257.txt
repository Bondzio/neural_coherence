Does it do what you want or do you find it lacking or even more troublesome than a std. HD? Since, these have been out for some time and early problems resolved(I think) just are your thoughts on that? I like to exclude any costs here, just your real PC experiences. thanks -----Willy

Got all handily and never bothered with benchmarking. Have them in dt and notebooks. No problems if FW is good. Unfortunately not all mfrs support their SSDs with up-to-date FW and that has given SSDs a bad rap. User reviews will point out the brands that satisfy more than others. Not worried about longevity; 3 yr warranties cover me with replacements should they die prematurely and I have system image backups, in case. After 3 yrs who cares, it's time for a new machine anyways; small businesses feel differently, but they shouldn't because it's a bad decision to stall due to HW wearouts. Don't &quot;store&quot; data on system drives, be they HDDs or SSDs. Therefore only buy SSD up to capacity necessary for OS and apps to save money and heartaches.
