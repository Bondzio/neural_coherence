<s> I have two monitors. </s>
<s> One is no more than two or three years old. </s>
<s> It has started blinking off. </s>
<s> The monitor is on but the screen goes black with a bright line going across once every few seconds. </s>
<s> If I turn it off and on it comes back: sometimes for the rest of the day, sometimes for a few minutes. </s>
<s> Could it be dying already only after three years? </s>
<s> The primary monitor is fine. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> And you tried hooking it up as primary (or stand alone) and then? </s>
<s> That's a scary thought. </s>
<s> If I remove the good monitor and hook up the malfunctioning one and it goes out, what then? </s>
<s> if I switch assignments for the monitors and the bad one goes out, what then? </s>
<s> BTW. </s>
<s> I just updated the driver and it went out again so it's not that. </s>
<s> And everything had functioned normally, suddenly this happened? </s>
<s> If that is the case the chances are fairly strong that the monitor is toast. </s>
<s> The real test would be to hook the suspect unit to a different computer and see how it does. </s>
<s> That sounds like a failing deflection circuit. </s>
<s> While that was repaired years ago, today there are very few shops that can repair this for less than a replacement display. </s>
<s> As to your query about what happens if you change display settings and then it fails, that's Windows 101 material. </s>
<s> Let's keep that answer short and write &quot;change it in Safe Mode.&quot; Bob </s>
