<s> In 2003, my wife bought me a Sony Vaio PC for Christmas. </s>
<s> 3 1/2 years later, I have unsuccessfully attempted to upgrade my video card. </s>
<s> First, I tried a Radeon 9600. </s>
<s> Didn't work. </s>
<s> Then, I tried a GeForce 6200. </s>
<s> Didn't work. </s>
<s> Both cards were unstable. </s>
<s> Finally, although this is hardly an upgrade, I installed a Geforce FX 5500. </s>
<s> The original card was a Radeon 9200. </s>
<s> I am getting ready to attempt my final upgrade - a Radeon X1300 Pro. </s>
<s> I know the simple solution would be to buy a new power supply. </s>
<s> However, Sony Vaio power supplies are proprietary - a standard atx PSU will not fit the case (tried that too). </s>
<s> Another solution is to build a new system. </s>
<s> I plan to do this early next year. </s>
<s> I have read other threads that discuss power supply overloading issues when installing a video card in a system with an under performing PSU. </s>
<s> My solution is the following: I have disconnected the second internal hard drive. </s>
<s> I disconnected the second DVD ROM drive. </s>
<s> Disconnected the floppy drive. </s>
<s> My goal is to create more power for the X1300 Pro. </s>
<s> Does anyone think this will work? </s>
<s> Has anyone successfully installed an X1300 Pro or similar card with an underperforming PSU. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any additional advice? </s>
<s> System Specs: 300W PSU Pentium 4 2.8 CPU 2 GB DDR 2700 RAM GeForce FX 5500 GPU Seagate 500 GB Hard Drive Dual Boot XP Pro - Vista TV Tuner (Possible power hog) Thanks, Michael </s>
<s> Now this is a Celeron socket 775 3.06 GHz, 256 MB RAM (1 stick) no hard disk, no cd/dvd drive and Radeon x1300 PCIE but the result was a power up and the system would reset when the video started. </s>
<s> I upped the box power supply to 480 watts and now with the hard disk and cd/dvd it works fine. </s>
<s> I also have recently hacked a Sony. </s>
<s> We used a stock ATX supply but bolted it externally. </s>
<s> A short power extended was needed but it worked and they haven't changed it yet. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You know, I have wondered if an external solution would be possible. </s>
<s> Would you be willing to provide details of how you successfully completed this modification? </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> Michael </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=ATX24POWEXT-DT&cat=CAS There are many such for all such cables if you don't make your own. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I understand the cable extention. </s>
<s> How did you externally mount the PSU? </s>
<s> We drilled a few holes and screwed it on top of the PC case externally. </s>
<s> I think the other method could involve duck tape. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...I think I'll skip on the duct tape. </s>
<s> Mounting the PSU on top of the case may be my only option; if I truly want to force power into this old thing! </s>
<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> -Michael </s>
<s> Hey..Glad your lady got your system man. </s>
<s> My thoughts are that since you are bumping up your power supply; You should at least get a 450W one? </s>
<s> ...I'm working on it. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if an upgrade on this PC is practical. </s>
<s> I would like at least 500W, however. </s>
<s> As a novice enthusiast, I began to become more and more frustrated with trying to upgrade/mod my OEM Sony Vaio PC. </s>
<s> A couple weeks ago, after a &quot;few&quot; drinks, I hit the Newegg website, and ordered the parts for my first custom machine. </s>
<s> Here it is: EVGA nForce 680i SLI Mainboard Q6600 @ 3.15 GHz Zalman 9700 LED 2GB Corsair Dominator @ 1166 MHz 2X EVGA GeForce 8800 GTX 2x 160GB WD Raptor (Raid 0) 1TB Hitachi Deskstar Quad Silencer 750W PSU Antec Nine Hundred Case Windows Vista Ultimate This machine is a beast! </s>
<s> The build went flawlessly, although it took several hours to put everything together. </s>
<s> The Antec Nine Hundred is great, however, I will probably move everthing into a full tower case in a couple months - very little room to work with. </s>
<s> Overclocking the CPU and memory was a breeze. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the Q6600 (B3 stepping) started blowing chunks above 3.2 GHz. </s>
<s> From what I've read, every processor overclocks differently, and I'm satisfied with the results. </s>
<s> As for the Sony, it's attached to my home network and being used for miscellaneous backups and file transfers. </s>
