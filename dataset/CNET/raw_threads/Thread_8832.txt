I have a Emachines T1860 PC with XP home When cleaning out my hard drive, I accidentaly deleted a program that I believe may have been the driver for my Avance AC'87 speakers. after I deleted the program, I checked the audio and it was working properly. Since a litle over a week ago, however, I have been experiencing frequent problems with the audio. Every 3-5 minutes, a loud buzzing sound will come on and off through the speakers repeatedly and the screen will shake at the same quick intervals as the sound. I do not believe this is a virus, becaus I have had mcaffee installed on my computer and I rountinely check. Is this a driver problem, or something else, and does anyone know what to do?

(designed for computer use). Go to your control panel, device manager and remove the audio drivers and reload the drivers with the manufacturers CD, (or their website). Its also possible that you may have a faulty audio cable.
