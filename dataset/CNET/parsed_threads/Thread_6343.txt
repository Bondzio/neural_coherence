<s> I've had my second strange experience with memory in a week. </s>
<s> Must be something in the air (does that expression really apply???) </s>
<s> Anyway I'm working on a Compaq PC with a Celeron 733. </s>
<s> PC has all original equipment. </s>
<s> I noticed it was a little light on memory (256MB) for what the owner wanted to do so I bought another stick of 256MB - both PC100. </s>
<s> I installed the memory and BIOS recognized the new total - 512MB. </s>
<s> Then Windows XP wouldn't load. </s>
<s> The PC loads to a Windows option screen to boot into Safe Mode, Load Normally, Last Known Good Configuration etc. </s>
<s> No matter which option I choose Windows won't load. </s>
<s> So I pulled both sticks of RAM and put one in slot one. </s>
<s> Windows loaded. </s>
<s> Then I did the same thing with the second stick of RAM. </s>
<s> Windows loaded. </s>
<s> Then I installed each one (separately)into the second slot and both times Windows loaded. </s>
<s> So . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> any idea why the system won't complete the boot process with two sticks of memory installed but can do it with either stick in either slot independently??? </s>
<s> Thanks for the ideas, Matt </s>
<s> if it sees one too many hardware changes. </s>
<s> But, generally when this happens, it ignores you when you return to the original configuration. </s>
<s> My only other thought is that Windows during it's own memory check found the two modules not working well together. </s>
<s> This might be remedied by installing either 1 512 meg module or two identical ones. </s>
<s> Small performance variables exist with memory modules. </s>
<s> What you might try to do is change these to more conservative settings in the BIOS if the memory is configured by SPD. </s>
<s> Set the timings to a higher number and try that. </s>
<s> Otherwise, I suspect one of two conditions above is possible. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I'm not sure what motherboard and BIOS version are in place. </s>
<s> I'll have to check. </s>
<s> You think there might be a setting relative to that specific BIOS that can help? </s>
<s> I didn't make any other key hardware changes either. </s>
<s> I replaced the CD-ROM bot if I'm not mistaken Windows doesn't check for this device as one of it's key configuration components, right? </s>
<s> Do you think starting and than shutting down the PC with the CD-Rom installed and only one stick of memory in place will make it easier for the PC to 'digest' the second stick for the next startup? </s>
<s> I might be able to rob a stick of 256 from an older machine - could that make a difference? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help/answers so far. </s>
<s> Po </s>
<s> If you have a generic, no-name box ... download and run 'CPUZ' and give us the MB info under the 'Mainboard' tab. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> PC100 hasn't been made in years. </s>
<s> There was also deep problems with many 256MB sticks and i810/i815 chipsets (and others.) </s>
<s> Given 2 possible strikes it's too likely you tripped over this bug or found some old RAM that has been returned to the store or sold on ebay. </s>
<s> Not a cure but just my bet. </s>
<s> More details could point to an exit but I still think we won't be using the new stick. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I grabbed two more, different sticks of 256MB SDRAM and installed them. </s>
<s> Still no difference. </s>
<s> Would a BIOS flash overcome the problem? </s>
<s> Good call on the chipset - it's an Intel 810 PO </s>
<s> It's a matter of the chipset. </s>
<s> The issue was well known years ago but techs forget it. </s>
<s> Crucial.com will give you the right sticks of memory. </s>
<s> While I can get all technical why this happens it will not fix it or lead to any method or BIOS that will make the sticks work in i81x based boards. </s>
<s> So I'll skip why this is so. </s>
<s> There are other chipsets with this issue but since the details are not in this discussion I can't tell you if your motherboard chipset is the cause. </s>
