The old system specs were an Intel 810e chipset with a 1.4 GHz Celeron processor.
I installed a new heatsink (it already had the thermal glue on the bottom so I couldn't have screwed that up) and CPU fan which is running properly and was rated high enough for the 2.8 GHz processor.
I now have 256 MB PC2700 DDR SDRAM in one slot with another of the same on the way.
The RAM is brand new from Office Depot, so it better not be faulty.
I was told I could install any 266/333/400 DDR memory and at bootup it says mine is at 333.
The graphics card is the same one I had before, an nVidia 5200 128 MB PCI card.
The fan seems to be working on that one still.
I really appreciate all the help, this problem is starting to get pretty annoying.
