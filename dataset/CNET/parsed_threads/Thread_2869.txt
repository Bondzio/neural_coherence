<s> Hi - When I first bought my 100gb maxtor external hard drive for my desktop dell, I plugged it in, set it up correctly, but couldn't locate it. </s>
<s> After researching I found on this site, a link I followed that I think (I can't really remember) I downloaded something wich located this new drive. </s>
<s> I just moved my room around, unplugging everything, and now I again, can't locate my drive. </s>
<s> I don't want to reformat it b/c I have everything saved on it. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me locate it again? </s>
<s> Thanks - Al </s>
<s> I hooked the Maxtor up to my Dell laptop, copied that archive, then hooked it up to my Desktop. </s>
<s> I am running XP-Pro on a Pentium with C: drive and 2 DVD drives (D: and E:). </s>
<s> The system found it and labelled it as F: ..so far, so good... </s>
<s> Created an archive directory, copied 4 folders, then had to wander off. </s>
<s> When restarted, the desktop can no longer find Drive F:, the Maxtor. </s>
<s> ..bummer!... </s>
<s> Oh yeah, if I power up with the Maxtor attached to a USB port, the system hangs in POST..double bummer!!... </s>
<s> Have you TOO been thinking about getting an archival portable drive..? </s>
<s> was told... </s>
<s> Check to see what type of USB connection you have in Device Manager. </s>
<s> In the Universal Serial Bus connection section, look for the Intel 82801 chipset. </s>
<s> If you have this chipset, you will have communication issues with the PS 3100. </s>
<s> There is a hardware conflict with this particular chipset and the PS 3100. </s>
<s> There are two possible solutions to this problem. </s>
<s> You may purchase a USB cardbus adapter card, install it and connect the drive through that USB connection and the drive will work fine. </s>
<s> The alternative would be to replace the drive with any other Maxtor drive model other than the PS 3100. </s>
