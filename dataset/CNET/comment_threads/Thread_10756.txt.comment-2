I would try HP/Compaq, both are made by the same company- HP, compaq being the budget part of hp, they have some really good desktops, and laptops, and some of their laptops do come with a really good webcam, and Hps are very reliable, ive owned several compaqs thru the years, none gave me any issues.
I would look on newegg.com for webcams, the customer reviews do help.
