<s> Ok this is weird and annoying any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Running win XP home SP1 on a new comp P4 2.8 . </s>
<s> Everythin was working fine for the first 2 weeks. </s>
<s> Then one day I go into my comp and (C:/ hardrive) (a 120Gb Seagate Sata drive) no longer has a little HD icon as it used to but rather that ugly little icon for unrecogised file types. </s>
<s> When i try to click the drive to access it win XP tells me &quot;Please go to the control panel to install and configure system components&quot;. </s>
<s> The drive is working apart from this little annoyance all programs on the disk run and all files can be read i just have to change to expanded view and click a subfolder on C:/ and things go fine. </s>
<s> As long i dont try clicking on C:/ HD in explorer. </s>
<s> Explorer is convinced i dont have a HD ! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> So i go into device manager the HD is there under disk drives and its 'properties' tab says device is working fine. </s>
<s> I try uninstalling The hardware from device manager and reistalling. </s>
<s> Windows detects and reinstall the HD correctly only the problem is still there ! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Anyone know whats wrong, or how to fix it? </s>
<s> I would be really grateful if you could tell me. </s>
<s> You give us no info about the system this is in. </s>
<s> Did you build it yourself? </s>
<s> did you install the Motherboard drives so the IDE/SATA controllers can be correctly configured? </s>
<s> What does it show in device manager for the controllers? </s>
