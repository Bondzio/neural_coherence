Thank you for the reply, so from what I gather you are saying a 2.0 drive will work with my computer I will just not be taking advantage of the fast speeds I could be if I had a 2.0 usb correct?
My only other issue is the question about will storing music on an external hard drive degrade the quality of the music file if I was to move it between computers using the hard drive.
From what I have read and gathered it does not but I just wanted to ask to be sure as these things are not my expertise.
I planned to just copy My Music folder onto an External drive for a bit of extra protection as my collection is becoming large.
Thank you once again for your insight.
