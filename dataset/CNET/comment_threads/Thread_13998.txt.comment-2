If you are planning on going to XP Pro when replacing the drive, you really do not need too much.
When you buy the new drive, just put XP Pro on it.
If the program is really an upgrade, it just asks for the location of the previous version's install.
I never really tried it with restore disks but you can try that.
If that does not work, then install the old drive in for just the verification (maybe could be in an external enclosure) and then proceed.
Others may be able to give you more info on this for a workaround, or you could just use any qualifying OS install disc.
