<s> Install a better (game capable) video card? </s>
<s> I'd go with the HP. </s>
<s> I've had a HP desktop since Jan of 2002 and it still runs pretty good, granted I've re-formatted it about 4 times due to viruses and such. </s>

<s> you don't want to be too far behind in technology come 2 or 3 years from now and core 2 duo has already been around for some time. </s>
<s> you should expect your computer to give you a good 5 years. </s>
<s> I've had my HP for 6.5 years now </s>
