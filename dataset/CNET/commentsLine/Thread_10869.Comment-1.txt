to be exact.
i got a dlink 624 m super g mimi wireless router!
and i must say i havent had a problem with it so far.
( i read some of the horror stories in the review.
i ain soon to add mine) my problem is.
how do i get to share files of the network.
i figured out how to share the printer, well first of all let me list the items in my network.
i have a compaq presario 6320us and the main computer it is connected to the net ethernetly wired through the dlink 624 m super g mimi wireless next i have a hp pavilion dv4217d laptop.
which i have wirelessly connected.
it has centrino!!!
and i am using the built in wireless b/g adapter.
then i have and hp photosmart 2575. which i have connected to the the compaq by way of usb.
but i also have it connect by way of ethernet to the router.
yah it is a networkable printer.
i went through the set up and all of that good stuff of the router.
i had a secured network so i have my laptop a network key.
i also gave it a ssid i set up the printer and all of that blah blah.
i can print from any room with my laptop.
now!
my problem is that.
i wanna connect to the compaq from the hp and vice vera to share files and remotely use the computer.
is there any way i can do that.
becasuse soon i wanna clean of my hp hard drive and transfer all the files to the compaq.
and when i finish preparing the compaq.
i wanna transfer all the files back to the compaq.
thanks for reading this long essay.
ill be anxious for an response.
