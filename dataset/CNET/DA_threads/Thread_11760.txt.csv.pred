1.1.1	I have two CD/DVD burners on my pavilion xv998 .	St
1.1.2	Every time I try to add data/music to a CD that has something on it , I get an message that says to & quot ; insert a blank disk & quot ; .	St
1.1.3	This happens no matter how much space is left on the CD .	St
1.1.4	I just can not write anything to a CD/DVD that has anything on it .	St
1.1.5	This applies to RW 's as well as R 's .	St
1.1.6	With the RW 's it will allow me to erase whatever is on the disk and then it will record but if I try to put anything else on the disk it will tell me that there is n't room even though it has 600GBs left .	St
1.1.7	And occurs no matter what software I am using to write with .	St
1.1.8	I have several CD/DVD burning applications and it happens on all of them .	St
1.1.9	Has anyone else experienced this ?	Ques
1.1.10	Can anyone explain what to do about it ?	Ques
1.1.11	Can it be a hardware or software problem ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //www.cdrfaq.org/ tells you more than you need to know .	St
1.2.2	Read about multi-session and be aware that CD AUDIO disks are not going to allow this if on CD-R and only if you erase the disk if on CD-R/W .	St
1.2.3	In short , nothing seems wrong .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the info .	St
1.3.2	But I can add to a partially completed CD on my other computer if there is sufficient space .	St
1.3.3	It asks me if I wish to erase on an RW and when I reply & quot ; no & quot ; it allows adding data or music .	St
1.3.4	The computer that wo n't allow adding to a partially filled disk has lots of DVD/CD burning software on it so there may be a conflict somewhere .	St
1.4.1	That 's a mult-session CD .	St
1.4.2	Just so you know , CD-Audio has NO such method .	St
1.4.3	Be clear on your terminology and use the CDR FAQ to get up to speed on what is what .	St
1.4.4	I do n't see any issue yet .	St
1.4.5	Things seem to be working just fine .	St
