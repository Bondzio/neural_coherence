My setup, all D-link: DCM-200 cable modem DI-614+ four port wired/wireless router DFE-530TX+ NICs in three desktops DWL-650 wireless NIC for a laptop Since you already have the modem and NICs in the PCs all you need is the router and cables.
D-link has excellent support both on line and email (don't ask me how I know).
Good luck, Telephony facts, analog/digital explained.

I think computer viruses should count as life.
I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive.
We've created life in our own image.
