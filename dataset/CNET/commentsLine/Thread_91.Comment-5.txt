will the drive spin up and the read/write heads track.
as, if i remember correctly, the freezer trick was for bad sectors.
on drives that do not spin up i use an external enclosure.
this allows me hold the hdd in various position, shocking the drive with the power switch.
when and if the drive spins up i hold that position, cross my fingers and start copying files.
