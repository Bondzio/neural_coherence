1.1.1	My residence and office are close but not close enough.	St
1.1.2	I would like to share the Internet access and eliminate one bill but the distance is straightline about 300 meters(1000 ft).	St
1.1.3	There is not a lot of structure between the two places but some.	St
1.1.4	Been trying to figure out how to boost signal from one to the ohter to make the connection but the information is hard to decipher without an EE degree.	St
1.1.5	I was figuring one would have to either buy a significantly upgraded attenna for the router and an WAP whose antenna can similarly be boosted, since receving and and transmitting is generally desirable.	St
1.1.6	Or am I talking about so much power that I fall into a category that requires a license?	St
1.1.7	Thanks Phil	St
1.2.1	Go get a pair of CANTENNAs (see google) and some bridges (see google.)	St
1.2.2	NO ONE WILL TELL YOU THIS WILL WORK!	St
1.2.3	If they do then you've found either someone that hasn't done this or someone that is always the optimist.	St

1.4.1	Hi there, I had the same problem about 2 yrs ago.	St
1.4.2	I cured the issue by using 2 biquad antennas.	St
1.4.3	Then I made it even better by combining the remote computers biquad with an old DirecTv dish (Raises biquad gain to about 30db) Then,If you use a dish on both ends you can up the range even further (as much as 8-10 miles with clear terrain) Anyway, I'm getting a full speed connection at an excess of 700ft with the router antenna mounted inside and the dish on the remote system outside.	St
1.4.4	So I'm going through walls and trees and still getting a very reliable connection.	St
1.4.5	It worked so well that I started manufacturing and selling the biquads.	St
1.4.6	I've sold well over 100 of them, with nothing but excellent feedback from the buyers.	St
1.4.7	Get them here, or follow the link on this page to ebay.	St
1.4.8	www.thewifipro.net I know this will help.	St
1.5.1	If you do, then those posts are removed.	St
1.6.1	Sorry Bob, Guess I tooted my own horn here a bit.	St
1.6.2	I know this will help Phil though.	St
1.6.3	Thanks, Jeff	St
1.7.1	That website has something for sale.	St
1.7.2	We can't allow for sale links or the forums will fill with spam.	Ques
1.7.3	It's a very low bar but set there for a good reason.	St
