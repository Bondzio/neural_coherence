11627	0	505563	5026256	NR	jmsfmtex	11/14/10 9:25 AM	1.2897267E12	Network	I would like to have my desktop PC interact with my netbook. They are both connected (wired) to a LinkSys 2.4 Router. What and how is the best way to connect them?

I do not have much patience, when it is something that does not matter one way or the other, so I gave up. Just have too much time on my hands.

Call up some local talent and tell them what you want done. Then have them tell you when it's working so you don't have to wait or invest personal time in the effort. Bob

I continued to play around with this set up and discovered that on the desktop I can access the netbook by accessing the &quot;workgroup&quot;. On the netbook I can access the desktop with &quot;network places&quot;. I do not know if that is the best or correct way but I have been able to transfer data and that is what I wanted to do. When I delete a folder in the &quot;Share Document&quot; folder it does not delete the original, does it?
