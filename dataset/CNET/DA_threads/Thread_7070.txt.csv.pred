1.1.1	I 'm thinking of building of a new pc and I have looked at some components that I think are good and will work together and I was curious if they really will work together , and if there are similar components for a better price .	St
1.1.2	Finally should I just by a version of windows xp , or vista ?	Ques
1.1.3	The parts are as follows : XFX nForce 680i LT SLI Motherboard , Diablotek CPA-901 Black ATX Mid-Tower Case with Ultra LS600 600-Watt Power Supply , Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 Quad-Core Processor , 2.40 GHz , 8M L2 Cache , LGA 775 , Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 250GB Hard Drive - 7200 , 8MB , Serial ATA-300 , OEM , Sony DRU-V200S/BR DVD Rewritable Drive SATA , Corsair XMS2 2 GB ( 2 X 1 GB 240-pin DDR2 800Mhz Dual Channel Memory Kit , EVGA GeForce 9600 GSO - 384MB GDDR3 , PCI-Express 2.0 , Dual DVI , HDCP , DX10 .	St
1.1.4	Thanks in advance for any help .	St
1.2.1	they seem like they are from a list 3-4 months old .	St
1.2.2	the q6600 processor is a still a good choice but i 'd lean toward the q8200 instead .	St
1.2.3	likewise , 680i motherboards have been replaced by 780i mobos which address data corruption and cpu compatibility issues .	St
1.2.4	and if you 're not going to use SLI , mobos based on the p35/p45 chipset are a better alternative .	St
1.2.5	seagate 7200.10 hard drives have been superseded by 7200.11s and a 500gb .11 is only $ 20 more .	St
1.2.6	and the 9600gso never gained a lot of manufacturer support and a $ 90 9600gt is certainly a better all-around choice .	St
1.3.1	I choose them basically for the performance for the cost , and apparently I made a few decisions which obviously were n't the best , but thats why I made this thread in the first place and your help is appreciated .	St
1.4.1	What are you going to be using it for ?	Ques
1.4.2	What is your budget ?	Ques
