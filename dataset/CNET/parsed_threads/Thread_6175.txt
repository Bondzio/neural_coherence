<s> Is this graphics card compatible with my moniter. </s>
<s> I have an HP vs19d moniter. </s>
<s> And I want to get this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814150202 </s>
<s> As long as you have your inf file in there specifying the refresh rates, there shouldn't be a problem with your monitor. </s>
<s> You should open up your computer though and make sure your card is a PCIe. </s>
<s> And not only that, make sure your power supply has a 6 pin connector dedicated to the PCIe card. </s>
<s> If it doesn't, you're going to need a new power supply. </s>
<s> And thats going to be a hassle to track down. </s>
<s> Otherwise, great card. </s>
<s> Great price too. </s>
<s> A few of the reviews have it running at 64 degrees. </s>
<s> That's pretty hot, but one guy said thats normal. </s>
<s> and I put my computer right next to it to keep it cool. </s>
<s> I was going to run a plastic pipe to it but was afraid of moisture getting in there. </s>
<s> These high performance cards are great, but they generate a lot of heat. </s>
<s> Some people even have liquid coolers. </s>
