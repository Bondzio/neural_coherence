I have an hp pavillion dv6000 with vista premium, and use a wireless conection.
It all worked fine until one day the wlan disappeared!
It doesn't even show it in device manager, nor in the &quot;view network connections,&quot; and the wireless switch doesn't do anything.
It also doesn't load hp wireless assistant anymore... No hardware problems, and I'm pretty sure I didn't manually change anything... any ideas?
