In case others out there are still struggling with this vexing and msot annoying problem, the solution appears to be simple.
In the first instance, though, it has to be said that after googling my around the net for several days in search of help, it appears the problem with USB recognition being occasionally flakey is widespread.
2nd observation is that people try to be helpful but none of the solutions (aand some are dire and dramatic like reformatting disks) seem to work----except one.
Close everything down, remove all peripherals ANDm importantly, remove the power supply.
Leave the computer for about 30 minutes so that all residual electricity goes out, then reboot.
Attach USB devices and other devices one by one - XP has been forced to restore all its drivers and away you go!
Well, it worked for me, and I've read three other cases where it worked similarly (which is where I got the idea from).
so why not try it?
