5234	0	64894	770401	NR	J.Y.C.	2/16/05 11:52 PM	1.10859792E12	Urgent...need immediate help	I have finally got a hold of the mobo that I ordered from Newegg.com. It was quite easy to put in, thanks to Ray's heads up regarding the jumpers. But I have problems already. The new MB is a PC Chips' product, and its model # is M811LU. I have put in everything onto the MB and into the new case without any problem. And the MB recognizes every components quite easily. But then problem came up, when I plug the ethernet cord into the RJ 45 jack, the screen went to the good old &quot;white text with blue background&quot; telling me either the hardware does not have the latest driver or it's not installed properly. Though every card in the PCI slots were found and installed properly, and I am certain they all have the newest driver. I have double checked over and over again, still no luck. At first I thought it's just the on board LAN's not acting correctly, therefore, I disabled it and put in my own NIC. Still, same blue screen with white text appeared when I plugged in the ethernet cable. Can someone please help me verify and solve the problem, it'd be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Joe

And that's when I found out it was my Kerio Firewall was playing tricks on me. Anyway, my problem is fixed now, and the MB is pretty decent as of now. Thanks, Joe
