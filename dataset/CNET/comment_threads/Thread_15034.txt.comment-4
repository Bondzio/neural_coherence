...across virually all windows platforms, that says the computer failed to find the operating system!
It does that by looking for a few vital but hidden system files on the hard drive....if it can't find these, you get the &quot;NTLDR not found&quot; (NT LoaDeR) error.
If you've just installed the Operating System from CD, without any problems, it's a good indicator that you'll likely have to enter your computer BIOS, and set boot &quot;Hard Drive #1&quot; first.
It's likely set to &quot;Boot From CD&quot; at the moment, which dending on hardware can stop the system booting from Hard Drive, even if that is listed as another boot option.
Good luck, GeeBee.
