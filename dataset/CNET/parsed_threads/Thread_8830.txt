<s> Hi I recently got a TL-R470T+ I got it running with one modem with a dd-wrt router hooked up with it. </s>
<s> I'm trying to get my pepwave on the go to help speed up the internet a bit my neighbor let me use his wifi . </s>
<s> So I'm trying to hook up both to work and I can't seem to get it to work. </s>
<s> The pepwave and the modem work well by them selves but I cant get both of them to work. </s>
<s> Can I get some help please. </s>
<s> It's not clear from your post. </s>
<s> Hard to answer generic problems like this. </s>
<s> The short answer is you have to read the manual and configure you r470. </s>
<s> There is no standard solution for load balancing, each vendor does it their own way. </s>
<s> I suspect you need to make sure your IP addresses blocks are not overlapping. </s>
<s> As general comment...internet speed will not increase just because you use this. </s>
<s> The only thing it can fix is if you were at 100% utilization of your primary link and you were going to offload traffic to the neighbors. </s>
<s> You cannot combine the circuits to increase the bandwidth just by placing a box on one end. </s>
