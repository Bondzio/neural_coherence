I have an ECS K7S5A Motherboard, I guess it has onboard video and graphics cards. I don't have the driver disc. There is no sound, and I monitor is showing everything in 640x480. Help! I don't know which are the right drivers to download, and I don't know how to install drivers. Thanks in advance! Robert
