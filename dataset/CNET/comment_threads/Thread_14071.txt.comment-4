Pentium IV systems can operate with single channel RAM, it'll just be slower than...slower than you'd think a system should operate Dual Channel RAM is better for Pentium IV's due to how their FSB works, but they can operate with out it (and some did/some still do...most VIA chipsets do not have dual channel capabilities, and any Pentium 4 using SDRAM is using single channel) but yes, for normal use (non-troubleshooting) you want and should have dual channel (in any system that can support it) i'm guessing it's the connection for the front panel some boards don't tell which is which (my DFI and Abit boards give no such information, but my old Asus board does (we are talking ancient though) I would suggest switching the power on cables so if you have one that is on top but it on the bottom power on pin and vice versa for the bottom connection are you sure your connectors are all plugged into the motherboard right?
(both power cables?
the 20-pin and 4-pin connectors) or if you have a 24-pin board, is the adapter correctly connected?
i would suggest making sure all connections are secure including the CPU HSF i would ensure the front power on switch is wired correctly beyond that, the only thing i can think of is to check that your not running power back into the PSU (easy to do if your using adapters for your fans (3pin small to 4pin molex) and connected everything to everything (so there are no open ends) and it can easily run power back into your PSU, and it won't run with power going into an output
