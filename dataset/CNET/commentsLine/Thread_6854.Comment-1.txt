hi there.
my internet will just cut off ramdomly near enough every day.
some times 3-4 times a day.
the only i can get it working again is by restarting the computer which i quite annoying.
i am running windows vista.
i connect to a 3com office adsl wireless router ive have narrowed down some problems though.
i have also got 2 other computers connecting via a wire (1 vista & 1 windows server 2003) and 2 laptops (1 vista & 1 2000) connecting wireless.
none of these ever disconnect.
i brought a 10/100/1000 network card as i thought there might be a problem with the onboard lan.
which there can't be if it cuts out with this card.
when it cuts out it still says that it is connected at the bottom and disabling and enabling doesnt work nor does repairing it.
it could cut out when im using it or when im not.
it will keep me signed into windows live messenger but i none of my messages go through to people.
can anyone help please.
thanks amd sempron 2400+ cpu foxconn motherboard 2 gb of memory 512mb ati 1650pro agp
