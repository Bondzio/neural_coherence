(assume latency and speed cannot be changed) Case 1: Two 1 GB RAMs (DDR2 800, 5-5-5-12, 1.8V) with each RAM sold separately. -OR- Case 2: Two 1 GB RAMs (DDR2 800, 5-5-5-12, 1.8V) with both RAMs sold in one package under the name &quot;Dual-Channel&quot; My understanding is that as long as the motherboard is connected to two RAM slots through two different bus and if the RAM sticks have identical configuration, then what we get is a &quot;dual channel&quot; RAM system. So, I am not sure if buying &quot;Dual Channel&quot; RAMs (Case 2) is better than buying two RAMs with identical configuration (Case 1). Can you please clarify?

9079	2	262985	2577556	2577469	renegade_0503	9/5/07 9:17 AM	1.18898382E12	Intel P965 express motherboard has a limitation on RAM	The Intel motherboard (P965 express chipset) which I plan to buy comes with the following notice: &quot;Notice: Only DDR2-800 memory supporting JEDEC approved 1.8V operation with timings of 5-5-5 or 6-6-6 is supported on Intel Desktop Boards based on Intel 965 Express Chipsets.&quot; (click on SPEC tab in http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16813121035 ) The dual channel package RAMs (Case 2) I found have 2.2V, 4-4-4-12 latency and cost about $70. Since I could not find dual channel RAM packs with 1.8V and 5-5-5-12 latency, I was thinking of buying two individual identical RAMs which would meet the motherboard requirements. The two RAMs cost higher - about $97 ($48.5 apiece) I am afraid of using the dual channel RAMs since they require about 2.2V for their operation (atleast, that is what I think so) whereas the motherboard would power them up only till 1.8V. If you think the dual channel RAMs would still work fine, then I would be more than happy to go for them at $70.

Second recommend getting all the RAM for the target PC in 2 DIMMs (2@1GB) vice 4 DIMMs (4@512MBs). If you get one DIMM now and one DIMM 6 months from now it's unlikely they'll be exactly the same. Whenever you buy RAM....test the RAM with Memtest86+ as soon as you receive and install the new RAM. By the way...there's no such thing as DUAL CHANNEL MEMORY...there's only RAM that works in systems with DUAL CHANNEL MEMORY ARCHITECTURE. VAPCMD

This would match the 1.8V and your latency requirements: http://www.ocztechnology.com/products/memory/ocz_ddr2_pc2_6400_system_elite_dual_channel This is the only memory they make that is 1.8v You can check prices at Amazon, Buy.com, dell.com I got the 2GB Kit and the 1GB Kit for about $175. I read several excellent reviews on this particular brand and model.

It helped me to narrow down my choice to buy the 'kit' RAMs. The deal I found from VAPCMD's link turned out to be the best: Kit dual channel RAM - 2 x 1GB, DDR2 800, 240 pin, 1.8V, 5-5-5-18 latency, heat spreader: comes to around $65 (after rebates, incl shipping).
