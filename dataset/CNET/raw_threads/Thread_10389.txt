I will do just that and get it repair/replace under warranty. By the way, what does &quot;Bus Type : default (0) -&gt; ATAPI, detected: ?&quot; means?

Here's a short reading about that. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Technology_Attachment All the message means is &quot;I found this.&quot; The ? mark may mean it didn't understand it. This is common if your version of Nero doesn't support said drive. -&gt; Try this. CDBURNERXP (google.com) It's free and supports more drives than most. Bob
