hi nelsonrh, i just bought a cheap cable &quot;5M VGA HD SVGA Extension Cable For PC Monitor Projector&quot; from ebay for 3.90 it work for my computer but when i turn the computer off and the LG monitor on, it will show &quot;check signal cable&quot;.
i think is about the pins, some only have 14 pins connected(not 15 pins) but i am not sure.
