1.1.1	I have an ASUS A7N8X-LA that needs to be replaced .	St
1.1.2	I would like to upgrade but do n't know what would fit into my cpu case .	St
1.1.3	I have the Compaq Presario SR1050NX .	St
1.1.4	I 'm want a faster processor and better graphics if possible .	St
1.1.5	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	Compaq.com says the motherboard is micro-ATX form factor : http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document ? docname=c00072236 & lc=en & cc=us & dlc=en & product=405454 & lang=en So , it 's likely you need another micro-ATX motherboard to fit the case .	St
1.2.2	HOWEVER , if you upgrade , it 's also likely you need a new XP license .	St
1.2.3	Hmmm , you 're probably better off getting a new computer or building one yourself .	St
