People said that i should try gettin a ps seperately from the case but i dont know if ill have enough money. Can someone suggest one of these cases or if possible find a good case - ps combo on newegg for like under 70 bucks if possible? Thanks

It would help a lot if you provide some specs for the cases or a link to the cases. Given that generic power supplies can be purchases for less than $30 and decents cases that provide good cooling solution and space and be purchased for less than $40, purchasis the P/S and chassis seperate might be the best way to go. It really depends a lot on the parts that you will be installing in the case. Antecs usually provide better cooling. I haven't heard much about Liteon cases and to be honest I didn't Liteon made CASES. If you get a P/S with more than 350 watts then you will have more room to work with on future upgrades.

I picked these based on my preference since you didn't indicate your preferences. http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=11-199-005&depa=1 This particular case does not come with fans for cooling but at $26 for the case and 430Watt you can afford fans. It takes up to 4 fans to keep your mainstream products at a optimal temperature. I have an IT classmate that has 1 of these cases with a P4 installed. http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=11-195-004&DEPA=1 This case is for gamers who like a flashly looky cases to show off. It comes with 430 watt P/S and 1 fan. You can install 2 extra 80 mm fans in the rear. http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=11-144-035&DEPA=1 I picked this 1 as an option because it comes with a P/S (420 Watt) and its a professional looking entry-level server case. And best of all, unlike to other cases, its aluminum when means dissipate heat better. It only comes with 1 fan but you get another 80mm fan and still make your $70 budget. However with the $10 shipping fee, you will spend a little more than intended. http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=11-154-013&depa=1 This is just another professional looking case that would make a good option. I hope that this gives you some idea of what you can get. For a $70 budget the options are almost countless, especially if you're enthusiastic about it. All of these came from Newegg.com. Just take a look on there. In the future, you will get a lot more useful help if you provide some indication of how the parts will be used, as in, for gaming, home entertainment, or office or server use. Oh yeah, I kind of figured that the Antec Case that you were considering is the Antec Solution Series Mid-Tower Case w/350 W PS. For the price of that case I don't see anything special. It's a basic case. Its made out of steel. It does not come with fans (I have 1 system with this case.) And lastly, 350 W is rather limited when you add future upgrades as a factor. Its a decent case but would be better if it came with a larger PS and was aluminum. Thats my opinion of it but I'm a semi-gamer and I like to loaded systems. Good Luck.

End-users can then install the desired p/s unit, usually what they consider best. The whole point is, if you skip on cost for a decent p/s, you'll pay for it later, especially in a stuffed system. While generic p/s will do fine upto a point, basically they drop down considerably under stressful conditions while a quality unit tends to maintain its wattage levels for longer periods and at stable outputs. If you've a simple system, get the 350W for now and upgrade later. When you check on pricing for p/s, you can see a wide difference besides the bells and whistles. If you want your system to be as problem free from the start and you know you'll be putting high wattage demands, then start on the right footing, get the best p/s unit you can afford, of course a decent case with a good p/s just makes it all better. Think, &quot;long term&quot;. good luck -----Willy
