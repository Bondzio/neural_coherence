1.1.1	i have all standard g adapters and a b router, would there by any advantage to buying mimo over just a regular g router.	St
1.1.2	would there be any difference in range?	St
1.1.3	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	well you are doing now.	St
1.2.2	With G adapters and B devices, you will only achieve the lower speed of the two standards.	St
1.2.3	In most home scenarios with a broadband throughput of 6 mbps max, this is of no issue.	St
1.2.4	It becomes an issue during LAN transfers (transferring files for one PC to another).	St
1.2.5	MIMO will give you more distance and a speed bump on the LAN, Internet will stay the same.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
