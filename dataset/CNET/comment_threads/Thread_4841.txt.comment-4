heat related.
Maybe while in the BIOS screen, you could watch the CPU temperature, if you can find the screen that shows it.
Continue to watch that temperature to see if it approaches 70 degrees.
Most systems will give a warning if the CPU is too hot but it might be off in your setup.
Give it a look see.
