i bought a pci esata card and cable from fry's to connect to my 750 gb freeagent pro.
the drive will not power on (no light) no matter what i tried.
the card appears in the xp media center configuration.
the base of the drive is warm but no orange light.
usb and firewire work fine.
i have a sony vaio desktop with xp media center edition.
has anyone experience this problem?
thanks
