My first computer was a Dell laptop about 4.5 yrs ago and now I am looking into purchasing and building a desktop rig for college. I'm an architect student at the University of Hawaii and have been interested all my life on how things are put together and work.(Love to DIY, when I can) I plan one using my new rig for graphic design, like adobe, 3d modeling, like revit, maya, 3d studio max, CAD work, personal gaming, video editing and everything else that I could possibly use on a computer. This is my up and coming project: *Case: Antec P182 Gun Metal Black 0.8mm cold rolled steel ATX Mid Tower Computer Case $169.99 *CPU: Intel Core 2 Extreme QX6700 Kentsfield 2.66GHz LGA 775 Processor Model BX80562QX6700 $968.00 *CPU Heatsink/Fan: ZALMAN CNPS9500 AT 2 Ball CPU Cooling Fan/Heatsink -$49.99 *MOBO: EVGA 122-CK-NF68-A1 LGA 775 NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI ATX Intel $219.99 *Ram: Kingston HyperX 2GB (2 x 1GB) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 (PC2 6400) Dual Channel Kit Desktop Memory Model KHX6400D2LLK2/2GN - $138.49 *Graphics card: EVGA 640-P2-N821-AR GeForce 8800GTS 640MB GDDR3 PCI Express x16 HDCP Video Card - $379.99 *PSU: SeaSonic M12 SS-700HM ATX12V/EPS12V, 80Plus, Active PFC, RoHS, Dual-Fan, 700W Power Supply - $209.99 *HD: Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 ST3400620AS 400GB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s Hard Drive - $99.99 *Optical Drive: Lite-On super write dvd burner - $45.99 *OS: Microsoft Windows Vista 32-Bit Home Premium for System Builders Single Pack DVD - $111.99 system Total: Just over $2,400 including shipping. I am buying most of my parts from newegg.com I already own a gateway 22&quot; HD monitor and plan on purchasing the Logitech MX 3200 keyboard/mice combo. Questions: 1. Tools: I will be purchasing a tool kit for this build, but there is also other misc. tools, such as a static mats. I am looking into purchasing the Rosewill RTK-045 45 Piece Premium Computer Tool Kit - $29.99. It comes with a static strap and I have been reading up on cautionary steps such as working on a wooden table. Will the tools be enough? or is the static mat a must? 2. I have done research on these parts and everything checks out according to the manufacture sites and manuals. But, I do not know the mathematics for choosing a PSU. Every part has its own power demand so do I just add it up? How do you calculate the total wattages and amperage for a system psu? is 700W sufficient for this build? 3. The graphics card needs a 12v with at least 26amp, but all psu's are maxed at 18amps. manufacture site certifies this psu but how do you do the math? 4. I am pretty confident and familiar with hardware but now I am researching bio's. How can i understand Bio's. I understand that I input the power current to each part and make sure the system recognizes each component but what else can i expect? 5. Benchmarking/Testing: What are some key software to test system performances after build to break in all the components? I read about Mark** so what are the others? 6. RAID: I have done research on RAID system but can anyone point me in the right direction for a description on the differences on each setup? Which one is superior or a liking amongst everyone? 7. I know I must learn to crawl, walk, and then run. but, overclocking sounds like a goal. I don't want to kick myself in the ass, so overclocking is an afterthought right now, but its not too early to try and understand it. With that being said, what are your professional opinion on someone like myself understanding overclocking? if not this build than maybe the next. These are questions that I have come across so far. Any information and answers will be taken with great consideration. Also, if any of you could give me tips on what to look out for in a first build, that would be great too. Thanks a million and hope to hear from you all.......

(most will OC to 3ghz by simply selecting a 1333mhz fsb.) the evga isn't a bad mobo, but if you don't expect to use sli, you can certainly get a mobo that matches or exceeds its features and performance for about $150: http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=3042&p=1 msi p35 platinum: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130097 asus p5k: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131180 ocz platinum ddr2-800 has the same timings as the hyperx but has a $40 rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227179 western digital's new 500gb drive is only $10 more and matches or beats the seagate 7200.10 in most benchmarks. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136073 as for raid, that's basically up to you. i prefer intel's matrix raid (available on some of the p35 boards) since it allows you to create a mirror (raid-1, data redundancy) and a stripeset (raid-0, fast read/write speed) on just two drives. apps that use a lot of scratch space (like cs3, maya, etc.) can benefit from stripeset. unless you're overclocking, i don't think any type of burn-in is necessary nowadays so long as you stick to good quality components like the one's you've spec'd. even if overclocking, an hour or so of super pi and a dvd rip to mpeg-4 will ferret out almost any problem. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_PI benchmarking is a matter of choice. futuremark has free versions of most of their testing routines: http://www.futuremark.com/products/

12537	3	257465	2548139	2546286	tubaloth	7/25/07 9:50 AM	1.185357E12	ok	&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Tools: Just make sure you ground yourself by touching the power supply before you do anything with the parts. I have never bought any anti-static parts and been fine. &gt;&gt;&gt;But, I do not know the mathematics for choosing a PSU. Every part has its own power demand so do I just add it up? How do you calculate the total wattages and amperage for a system psu? is 700W sufficient for this build? There is a PSU Calculator on the internet (search google.) It isnt to bad, I feel it is a little on the high end (over calculates) but should give you a good idea. &gt;&gt;&gt; but now I am researching bio's Do you mean the BIOS for a computer? Im not exactly sure what you were asking here? &gt;&gt;&gt;Benchmarking/Testing Search the internet you should be able to find some. &gt;&gt;&gt;RAID: Again searching the internet well explain this way more then you ever would want. &gt;&gt;&gt;With that being said, what are your professional opinion on someone like myself understanding overclocking? if not this build than maybe the next. Overclocking now days isnt really that hard. You are just changing some of the settings in the BIOS for the computer to run faster. It really would come down to the motherboard you have and how it is build to overclock. (And from what I remember the 680i isnt to bad). The only thing is the Quad Cores dont over clock very much. Dont expect a lot. (the new G0 stepping should help some).

I am looking online. also, im considering a diff cpu cooler, ant idea's? i've, lookedn at a bunch and they are huge. i prefer a tower/heatpipe design but am afraid of space, and weight issues. should i be worried about the weight? looking at the TT 120 extreme.
12537	5	257465	2548393	2548292	ramarc	7/25/07 5:27 PM	1.18538442E12	overclocking a q6600	here's an article about OC'ing a q6600. with an asus p5k, the overclock to 3ghz is almost automatic. the p5k reached a higher final OC than the 680i based xfx board and 680i board required more tweaking. http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2007/07/25/overclocking_intel_core_2_quad_q6600/1 as for a cooler, if you don't plan on OC'ing agressively any good heatpipe unit will suffice. if you don't OC at all, the intel stock cooler is fine.
12537	6	257465	2548485	2548393	808marq	7/25/07 7:30 PM	1.1853918E12	thanks again	wow, I'm considering the p5k MOBO. too bad I cans use graphics cards in SLI, or can I? I'll do more into it. I just saw that the MOBO promotes ATI crossfire, can i use the geforce 8 series on these, and if i can, can i SLI them? Sounds like a stupid question, but i just want to through it out there to understand the role a MOBO has in relation with graphic cards and the cards manufacture. Thanks for the link, I am looking at getting the intel core 2 extreme QX6800 with a clock speed of 2.95 and overclocking it. I figured with the QX6800 stock speed, when I overclock it, it will be less stress on the CPU and heat output. I read in a forum that the max overclocking of those are in the 3.4 range to be stable, I'll probably sit just under that around 3.3 or 3.2. does this make sense?
12537	7	257465	2550144	2546286	Argotec	7/27/07 8:48 PM	1.18556928E12	Couple of points	Might be worth having a look at a couple of 250/300 Gb h/d's and set them up in raid formation, much easier to replace and recover from a crash than doing it on one drive in sectors. Also make sure you can access all available USB ports on the motherboard, with a lot of graffics add ons, tablets, printers plotters, etc. You will need all of them!
12537	8	257465	2550271	2546286	Ace_One	7/27/07 10:59 PM	1.18557714E12	Sites to look at	I don't know what your experience is, so, forgive me for being simple. My suggestion is that you visit &quot;www.computerhope.com&quot; this site has some very useful information; i.e. definitions of processor protocols, raid arrays, compatability of hardware, etc. Also, have a look at this site &quot;www.overclockers.com&quot; ...eventhough you may not be planning on overclocking your processor, this site may have some very useful pointers as well. Oh, as for static electricity, just be sure to discharge onto the case that you are building in before grabbing any components each and every time. Just go at it carefully and slowly. It's fun...enjoy.

Nortua makes really good quiet fans but sizes are limited. Your going for lots of graphics capability you might consider water cooling especially for overclocking with a Quad core. Look for slot capability with your MoBo. You might want to make changes in the future. Four RAM slots might be better then two, six would be ever better. Just some points to ponder
12537	10	257465	2551362	2546286	denkile	7/29/07 11:17 AM	1.18570782E12	Strategy for Such Questions	I have done three DIYs and two upgrades in three years of retirement. My Strategy: 1.Shop Newegg using the &quot;Power Search&quot; Speed read the customer reviews. Link to the Mfg site for: manual, drivers, BIOS, etc. (Newegg is the best for price, shipping, service, returns.) 2.Do advanced Google searchs for specific product reviews and issues. Your choices look great if cost is not a conisideration. Some other considerations to Google research. 1.Vista problems vs XP Pro. 2.XP Pro 64bit vs 32bit for availabity of drivers. 64bit is better supported by an AMD System. SOME LINKS: Great DDR800, NO mfg support: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16820211174 EVGA motherboard( note extreme overclocking review): http://www.google.com/search?as_q=motherboard&hl=en&num=100&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=EVGA+122-CK-NF68-A1&as_oq=reviews%2C+ratings&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&as_rights=&safe=images Good fortune with tour DIY !
