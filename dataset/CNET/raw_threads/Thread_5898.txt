Shortly thereafter, we both purchased laptops. Obviously, if we would have known we were buying laptops, we would have purchased a printer with a wireless card. A rep on the live chat with HP tells me that the J3680 is not Bluetooth compatible, but I'm not sure I trust him/her - they seemed to have a poor grasp on what I was asking. My question is two-fold: a) is the J3680 Bluetooth enabled? and if not, b) is there an wireless printer adapter out there that we can get to be able to print to the J3680 without physically connecting the USB cord to our laptops?

HOWEVER I find these too hard to setup for most owners. Even I was taken aback following a 15 plus foldout sheet of instructions. While you could research wifi print servers, you seem to want more support than I'm seeing in the field. I'd contact a geeksquad and ask &quot;how much to get it working?&quot; Bob

It's still debatable about how terrible these things are to setup but here's one I one -&gt; http://www.iogear.com/product/GMFPSU22W6/ from http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=GMFPSU22W6&cat=PRN HOWEVER this is still too rough on setup in my opinion but the price was right and I have some USB memory stick served up too. I put a Watt meter on it and it sits there drawing 2 Watts so it's not as bad as some others. Bob
