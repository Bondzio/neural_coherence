sorry to resurrect a dead thread but i totally forgot about this forum.
i tried the dma trick to no avail.
so lets see...more info.... i use several burning software and it ranges from jetaudio to nero, to dvd shrink, all of which have noticably added about 10 minutes to the burning process.
im not sure if ive mentioned this before but i used to be able to multitask alot while burning dvds, but now just to be sure that the burn comes out without errors i have to refrain from strenuous activity.
for example i could listen to music, play a flash game, burn a dvd, and surf the web with no slow down at the same time.
now i justsurf the web when when im burning something & theres still a slowdown.
is this slowdown normal?
