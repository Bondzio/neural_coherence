not trying to be one of those pia grammar police posters, but since you put it in quotes, i was compelled to correct.
i think you meant moot (as no longer applicapble or relevant)rather than mute.
in an otherwise intelligent post, i know i appreciate if someone points out i use a word wrong - don't appreciate it when it's just typo, as we all do that when our fingers can't keep up with our brains!
