<s> I could not find a specific forum for video/graphic card, so here it goes. </s>
<s> I am thinking about upgrading my graphic card to a Sapphire Radeon HD 3850 AGP card. </s>
<s> On its web site it states the power supply requirement is 450W. </s>
<s> The current power supply on board is only 400W. </s>
<s> So I am wondering if the power supply requirement is &quot;sticky&quot;, or if there's any room to wiggle. </s>
<s> Has anybody &quot;exceeded&quot; the power supply requirement and experienced trouble with their machine? </s>
<s> I certainly don't want to upgrade the video card, then have to upgrade my power supply after. </s>
<s> But it all comes down to amps per rail and we have to get very technical. </s>
<s> And to head off any question, YOU get to find the numbers. </s>
<s> That said I am running an old AGP HIS (another maker) ATI 3650 512MB on a 230 Watt PSU. </s>
<s> The entire box averages 140 Watts on a Watt meter so I'm just there. </s>
<s> I don't suggest anyone exceed the 50% mark. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> unless you're willing to upgrade the PSU too. </s>
<s> Some indicate PSUs deteriorate over time so if your PSU is not new, it may be further below the spec than 50 watts. </s>
<s> Make sure to note what connectors the GPU requires so you have the right PSU support. </s>
<s> Mfg specs state &quot;450Watt or greater power supply with 30Amps on 12 volt with 2x4 power connector recommended&quot; http://www1.sapphiretech.com/us/products/products_overview.php?gpid=227&grp=2 VAPCMD </s>
<s> So your power supply is only 230W, and it's running the 3650 card, which uses 140W of that power alone? </s>
<s> The entire system is drawing that much. </s>
<s> I have the advantage of being equipped with Watt and Amp meters so I can measure what's going on. </s>
<s> I also have the 3650 and not the 3850. </s>
<s> Not many will trouble themselves to measure Watts and Amps so can't do this. </s>

<s> hello there, donot worry about the power supply too much if you donot overclock or if you are not a hardcore gamer to the core.In this link here *************************************************************** http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp ************************************************************** you can calculate the power requirement.It works good. </s>
<s> But power supplies never run at there stated power and realistically you only get about 85% efficiency of that number. </s>
<s> So keep that in mind. </s>
<s> Also, stock PSU's typically do not come with the 2 4-pin connectors. </s>
<s> They barely come with SATA power. </s>
<s> You can easily pick up PSU's cheap these days, so it may be within your means to pick one up with your card. </s>
<s> That way you pave the way for future upgrades. </s>
<s> Also, if it's a stock dell, I do not recommend adding an aftermarket PSU as Dell has been known for it's proprietary hardware. </s>
<s> but it's definitely lower for run of the mill PSUs and older/aging PSUs. </s>

<s> Well.. this is more than sufficient, and its on sale at my site for $80. </s>
<s> its perfect even if you will be upgrading down the line.. take a look.. the APEVIA ATX-AS680W-BL 680W Power Supply http://pcreviewer.org/neweggcom-double-shellshocker-supersale/ </s>
