look for a techky friend and don't use that repair shop anymore.
you need a new harddrive or did they put a new one in?
try solving one problem at a time.
sometime it might be cheaper just to get another computer.
you have a floppy drive?
if yes, try booting up the computer in dos.
this way you will bypass the harddrive.
that's how i do it when i check out a new computer.
computers are very complicated when you don't know what you are doing but it's very simple when you do.
