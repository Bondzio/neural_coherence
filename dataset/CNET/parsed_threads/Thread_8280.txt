<s> This may be something that has already been discussed...I have a PC now and take a lot of large digital pictures. </s>
<s> I am looking to get an external harddrive to store my photo's on. </s>
<s> I am also going to be purchasing a MAC soon...That brings me to my quesiton...If I buy a hard drive and connect it to my PC and dump all of my pictures on it, will I be able to then connect it to my MAC (when I get it) without losing any of the pictures? </s>
<s> or is it better to wait to get the hard drive and continue to store pictures on CD's for the time being? </s>
<s> hi if you're buying a new mac i can't see a problem cheers pod </s>
<s> If it were me and I wasn't going to use the PC after getting the MAC, I'd continue as you're doing now. </s>
<s> Once you get the MAC and get the PICs moved, then take the PC HDD, put it in an external enclosure and use it as extra backup. </s>
<s> You might also consider putting your important stuff on DVDs and store them offsite ... just in case. </s>
