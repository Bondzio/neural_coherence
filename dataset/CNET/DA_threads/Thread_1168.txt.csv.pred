1.1.1	Excuse me about my poor English ( I 'm Italian ad use an automatic linguistic translator ) .	St
1.1.2	I do n't know whether to insert this question and I hope both the correct topic .	St
1.1.3	I do n't succeed in finding the solution for a problem that I probably think banal .	St
1.1.4	Meanwhile I attach you all the characteristics about my Maxtor and my laptop .	St
1.1.5	************************************************** MAXTOR ONE TOUCH II - E14W300 - Combo I use exclusevely in firewire 800 .	St
1.1.6	My Laptop is a Sony Vaio VGNA297Xp SP2 - Dothan M 1,800 Ghz .	St
1.1.7	- 2 Gb Rma - 100 Gb Hd - sk PCMCIA firewire 800/400 pccard DIGICOM - 32bit type II I use EMC Retrospect professional 7.5.370 ( 7.5.11.100 ) software .	St
1.1.8	The problem is redundant .	St
1.1.9	**************************************************** When the turned on laptop : I turn on the Maxtor and the & quot ; plug and play function & quot ; recognizes the peripheral one and does to see it to me among the & quot ; Computer Resources & quot ; .	St
1.1.10	If I detach the Maxtor with the PC turned on ( Hardware Removal Secure or I close it ) , if I want to see it again in the Computer Resources , ( my empirical solution ) I must unplug the cable and to put it again .	St
1.1.11	The & quot ; plug and play fuction & quot ; recognizes it , and see me again .	St
1.1.12	Perhaps , this is normal and/or regular .	St
1.1.13	But If I do a XP reboot , the Maxtor is not seen anymore .	St
1.1.14	To see it again , I am forced to use the procedure above described : unplug/plug cable .	St
1.1.15	For so much my question is this : how I can avoid this ... ?	Ques
1.1.16	less unplug/plug the cable firewire 800 ... . ?	Ques
1.1.17	Because the management is very annoying .	St
1.1.18	Is this is a problem about Maxtor ?	Ques
1.1.19	or DIGICOM SK ?	Ques
1.1.20	Is It resolvable ?	Ques
1.1.21	Is it a XP service that misses ?	Ques
1.1.22	( or ) a parameter ( or ) a flag that I must be lifted in XP ... ?	Ques
1.1.23	Thank .	St
1.1.24	Sergio LEONI .	St
1.2.1	Sorry but I see Windows and firewire connected drives to go down in flames so many times .	St
1.2.2	I have to write that if you feel this should work then take to the man in Redmond .	St
1.2.3	If you want this to work , go back to USB .	St
1.2.4	If you were on an Apple then I write & quot ; use Firewire. & quot ; Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob .	St
1.3.2	But the problem also exists in USB .	St
1.3.3	And then , the speed between USB and FIREWIRE is notably different .	St
1.3.4	Without under to value the fact that in firewire , you can be connected and to also disconnect to warm .	St
1.3.5	For Apple ... . excuse me ... . but I am cold to feel its name .	St
1.3.6	Sergio .	St
1.4.1	I 'm seeing firewire ( on Windows ) connections corrupt the drive .	St
1.4.2	Your choice here .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	You keep in mind that have already more times reinstallation the drivers ... . cleaned to deep the regedit ... . also cancelled the directories ... . and the all in different combinations .	St
1.5.2	I try again however to regenerate the drivers of windows ... . and then I do you to know .	St
1.5.3	for now thanks .	Polite
1.5.4	say you soon .	St
1.6.1	hi BoB , I thank you for your help ... . unfortunately I believe there is no solution ... . ! ! !	Polite
1.6.2	I have made tests on tests ... . also departing from different driver of the maxtor and windows .	St
1.6.3	I repeat that the problem is also in USB - the drivers of my model have primarily been written for USB ... the firewire 800 probably ( even if very more perfomante and then & quot ; top & quot ; for the plug/unplug ) more than so much it does n't interest on the market .	St
1.6.4	In fact , on the site Segagates there are not contemplated driver ... . and in more , further to a technical absence , they have me & quot ; recommended & quot ; to use the doors USB ( as from you already said ) ... . clearly with the result that you know .	St
1.6.5	The doubt was tied only to the fact that could exist a some parameter or flag or tip to manage in XP and that it allowed the hardware to understand that the external disk was present and accedible ( because indeed in the use of the function of & quot ; sure removal & quot ; of the hardware the visibility of the same is precise and evident ) .	St
1.6.6	hi and thanks still .	Polite
1.6.7	Sergio .	St
