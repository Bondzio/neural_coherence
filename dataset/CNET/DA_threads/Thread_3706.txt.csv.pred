1.1.1	I have purchased a new Seagate 400GB Ultra ATA/100 internal HD and an Adaptec USB/Firewire enclosure .	St
1.1.2	I have followed the installation directions to the letter .	St
1.1.3	Here 's the problem : when I plug in the enclosure to my computer ( by USB or Firewire ) , the computer thinks that it is a different drive ( one with only 80GB of space ) .	St
1.1.4	I can format it and partition it and use it satisfactorily , but I am limited to 80 GB .	St
1.1.5	I have checked device manager and its properties , and everything refers to this other drive .	St
1.1.6	It makes no difference as to whether I have the jumper on Master , Slave or Cable Select .	St
1.1.7	Seagate 's support speaks of many different capacity issues - usually refering to the Bios .	St
1.1.8	But , they specify certain GBs and 80GB is not one of them .	St
1.1.9	I do n't think that this is the problem as my computer is not very old and is running XP with SP2 .	St
1.1.10	Any suggestions ?	Ques

1.9.1	Many people have damaged OSes or use non-standard methods or the list goes on and on .	St
1.9.2	So far the clues are not there to pinpoint what 's going on for you .	St

1.10.1	But , should it ?	Ques
1.10.2	The new HD is connected by USB .	St
1.11.1	The question is , where is the system coming up with the value that just happens to correspond to the size of the old HDD which has been removed ..right ? ?	Ques
1.11.2	And when you look at it under disk management , the drive shows no unallocated space ?	Ques
1.11.3	Are you using any utilities like Tweak UI ?	Ques
1.11.4	?	Ques
1.12.1	I still have the original internal HD in the system .	St
1.12.2	The new HD is an additional internal HD but in an external enclosure , connected by USB .	St
1.12.3	The system is coming up with a completely different HD ( one that I have never owned ! ) .	St
1.12.4	It is made by Seagate , the same manufacturer of the new HD that I am trying to use .	St
1.12.5	Yes , there is no unallocated space .	St
1.12.6	No , I am not using Tweak UI .	St

1.15.1	Did you install the drive or did someone else do it ?	Ques
1.15.2	What does it say about the drive under properties ... under the Hardware tab ? ?	Ques
1.15.3	It should show you the Seagate model # .	St
1.16.1	I installed the drive .	St
1.16.2	Later , I will test it on a friend 's computer .	St
1.16.3	For now ...	St
1.16.4	Under properties or in the device manager , the drive is listed as ST380011A .	St
1.16.5	Seagate 's website describes this as Barracuda 7200.7 with 80 GB .	St
1.16.6	Cylinders 1023 , Heads 256 , Sectors 63 .	St
1.16.7	On the drive itself , there is a sticker from Seagate stating that it is model # ST3400632A .	St
1.16.8	Barracuda 7200.8 with 400GB .	St
1.16.9	Interestingly , I can find the drive on Seagate 's warranty validation section .	St
1.16.10	However , when I search for the drive from the main page , it does not come up .	St
1.16.11	There is a drive with model # ST3400633A .	St
1.16.12	It is described as Barracuda 7200.9 with 400 GB .	St
1.16.13	Cylinders 1024 , Heads 256 , Sectors 63 .	St
1.16.14	When I use Seagate 's formatting/partioning software that came with the drive , under drive info it states : Cylinder = 9729 , Heads 255 , Sectors=63 .	St
1.16.15	Notice that it says cylinder not cylinders .	St
1.16.16	Does all of this info indicate what the problem might be ?	Ques
1.17.1	I tried the drive on 2 other computers running XP with SP2 .	St
1.17.2	They also identified the drive as the 80 GB model .	St
1.18.1	Just to confirm ... what other hard drives ... make , model number , etc .	St
1.18.2	do you have in the system ? ?	Ques
1.18.3	What model number does the Seagate diagnostic SW indicate ?	Ques
1.18.4	Where did you buy the drive ?	Ques
1.19.1	The internal HD that came with the system is a Toshiba 60 GB with model # : MK6026GAX I have another external drive ( designed to be external ! )	St
1.19.2	that is a Western Digital 120 GB with model # : WD1200B015-RNN The Seagate online diagnostic tools identify it as ST380011A .	St
1.19.3	I bought it on-line through E-Bay ( I 'm beginning to regret that decision ! ! ! )	St
1.20.1	It could be a simple mistake by the mfg where they applied the wrong label to the drive or installed the wrong logic board on the drive in the mfg process .	St
1.20.2	Alternatively ... it could be a case where someone is buying quantities of small HDDs at low prices , duplicating labels for the bigger drives , putting the new labels on the older , smaller drives and reselling them to unwary vendors .	St
1.20.3	Better get in touch with vendor quick and maybe Seagate too so they can resolve the problem .	St
1.20.4	Did you buy with a credit card ?	Ques
1.20.5	If yes ... you might be able to dispute the charge until it 's resolved .	St
1.20.6	Was the price much lower than other sources ?	Ques
1.20.7	If you get prices lower than NewEgg or ZipZoomFly ... something 's wrong .	St
1.20.8	PLEASE let us know how this turns out .	St
1.20.9	VAPCMD	St
1.21.1	Well , you could never guess how this turned out .	St
1.21.2	It seems that someone , either my vendor or his distributor , was pulling a fast one .	St
1.21.3	The drive was , in fact , an 80GB HD instead of the 400GB that was on the packaging .	St
1.21.4	Further , the label turned out to be suspicious .	St
1.21.5	An expert suggested that it was counterfeit .	St
1.21.6	I notified my vendor and he agreed to exchange it .	St
1.21.7	But , he sent me a new HD with the exact same issue !	St
1.21.8	80GB with a suspicious label .	St
1.21.9	Finally , I spoke in person to the vendor and , after threatening all kinds of action , he agreed to exchange it again .	St
1.21.10	This time , he & quot ; tested & quot ; the drive before sending it .	St
1.21.11	The drive arrived and was as described .	St
1.21.12	Finally !	St
1.21.13	So , 2 months and two additional shipping charges later ( to get the 2 imposters back to him ) , I finally have what I initially was promised .	St
1.21.14	Lesson to be learned - do n't buy computer hardware through e-bay .	St
1.21.15	Especially when the price is lower than anywhere else .	St
1.21.16	Thank you for pushing me in the right direction !	St
