Steven, For both PCs, I only have one account...which is administrator.
For example, when I hit START, the top says ADMINISTRATOR.
I've tried to share files and printers....all I can see the PC name.
Under files and printers, I do see a &quot;hand.&quot; From the research I've done, it appears that Windows XP Media Edition is similar to XP Home.
But, I should be able to connect XP Home with XP Pro.
Thanks, Tom
