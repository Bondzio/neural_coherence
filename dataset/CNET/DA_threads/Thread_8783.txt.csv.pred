1.1.1	When I upgraded my RAM to 3 Gig yesterday , I took notice of the specs of the PSU ( Bestec ATX 300 12E REV DR ) .	St
1.1.2	From reading various posts on this site as well as the PC mag & quot ; Games for Windows & quot ; ( 12/06 ) , I saw many reccomendations calling for upgraded PSUs in light of higher spec requirements with Vista and Directx 10 in the near future .	St
1.1.3	I was not even considering the possibility of upgrading the PSU until this AM when my computer went to & quot ; stand by & quot ; mode while playing GTA SA 2nd edition ( which is full of bugs to begin with ) .	St
1.1.4	My computer has sometimes crashed to the windows screen before , but never to stand by mode .	St
1.1.5	So , I am guessing I may need a new PSU .	St
1.1.6	But I do not have the first clue on how to choose one that matches my system .	St
1.1.7	There was a very informative article , http : //www.firingsquad.com/guides/power_supply/page3.asp that I read , but I am now more confused than ever .	St
1.1.8	I guess I assumed that more watts would be better .	St
1.1.9	I would really appreciate it if someone could tell me first of all is a new PSU needed ?	Ques
1.1.10	And if so , which one would be right for my system ?	Ques
1.1.11	I really hate Gateway and I am scared that a PSU bought online wo n't fit their case or match their motherboard etc .	St
1.1.12	It would help too if you can explain it to me in really simple terms too .	St
1.1.13	I really do n't want to take to a dealer .	St
1.1.14	I was hoping to make a high end gaming machine out of my PC while I take a break from console gaming ( plan to re-visit the PS3 vs Xbox360 war again in a year or 2 . )	St
1.1.15	Thanks again for any help/info you can provide .	St
1.1.16	Gateway GT 5056 AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Processor 3800+ 2.00 Ghz , 3 Gig DDR PC32000 RAM Radeon x1900 ( was expecting to upgrade next year when Vista and directx10 arrives ) Gateway FPD2185w monitor HP Officejet Pro K550 Series printer gateway mouse Logitech gamepad w/dual controllers ( which I have unplugged for the moment ; I think they 're part of the problem ) I can provide more info on specs if needed .	St
1.1.17	Thanks again ... James	St
1.2.1	My guess without looking is you 're way underpowered .	St
1.2.2	The question is whether you can use a generic PSU or something proprietary to GATEWAY .	St
1.2.3	Here 's one of the BEST PSU mfgs made ... it does n't list GATEWAY as a mfg but I 'm sure they can tell you if they make a unit that works with your PC as configured .	St
1.2.4	It 's definitely worth a call .	St
1.2.5	PC Power & Cooling , Inc. , 5995 Avenida Encinas , Carlsbad , CA 92008 USA 1-760-931-5700 1-800-722-6555 Fax 1-760-931-6988 VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Thanks , I 'll give that a try	St
1.4.1	I did go the ATI site .	St
1.4.2	It said that particular card requires & quot ; a 400 Watt power supply or greater , 25 AMPs , 12 volt rail reccomended ( assumes fully loaded system ) ; For CrossfireTM 550 watt power supply or greater , 38 AMPS , 12 volt rail & quot ; I do n't know if I should be feeling really angry or really stupid .	St
1.4.3	I mean when I bought the system at Best Buy last summer , the BB employee and I must have talked for an hour or so about getting a & quot ; high end gaming machine & quot ; and it was he who suggested that card be bought with the system .	St
1.4.4	And it alone is 100 volts over the Gateway PSU 's 300 watt supply ? !	Ques
1.4.5	I will admit I do not know much about technology/electronics , but how have I been using the PC all this time with relatively few problems ?	Ques
1.4.6	I do n't know if I should blame Best Buy or Gateway .	St
1.4.7	I feel like I would have never known to even ask about the PC 's internal power supply specs and whether or not it would be compatible with the system they sold to me .	St
1.4.8	It just makes me mad .	St
1.4.9	I think you should get what you are told you are buying .	St
1.4.10	But at least I have learned a little more and know what to ask in future .	St
1.4.11	I will call PC Power & Cooling tomorrow abnd see what can be done .	St
1.4.12	I hope they will have good news as I have invested so much $ $ $ $ already .	St
1.4.13	Thanks again ... James	St
1.5.1	and sold the system that way .	St
1.5.2	If anyone is to blame .	St
1.5.3	.	St
1.5.4	I 'd say it 's the salesperson at BB .	St
1.5.5	Not so much for suggesting the upgrade card but for not telling you about the additional power requirement and affect if any on the system warranty .	St
1.5.6	If it 's any comfort ... you 're not alone .	St
1.5.7	This happens often as people buy PCs off the shelf and afterwards start adding stuff .	St
1.5.8	At some point the system starts showing signs of instability or spontaneous reboots , etc. , Let us know how it works out .	St
1.5.9	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	Hey VAPCMD , I did contact PC Power and Cooling as you suggested .	St
1.6.2	Unfortunatley , they did not have a model for my Gateway PC .	St
1.6.3	I did contat Gateway who sell a series of Startech PSUs ranging from about 300 to 550 watts .	St
1.6.4	If I remember right the 550w startech was about 68-69 $ ( seems kinda of budget/low end to me ) .	St
1.6.5	The tech at gateway assures me that these PSUs will work with the PC I got .	St
1.6.6	But I thought I would try to enlist some help before I buy .	St
1.6.7	So far I have not found any pages to find a review of startech although I am still looking .	St
1.6.8	If you need to see the specs , this is the link to the PSUs that gateway sells/reccomends : http : //accessories.gateway.com/AccessoryStore/PC+Accessories_316441/PC+Components_316805/Power+Supplies_316811/Default.htm Thanks for any help you can give ... James	St
1.7.1	James ... Based on the info from GATEWAY , here 's what I located on the 550 PRO and before I forget .. the GATEWAY price is as good as any I 've seen .	St
1.7.2	Looks like this is the Startech SKU ATX2PW550PRO and here 's the web site .	St
1.7.3	Not sure what the warranty is from GATEWAY but warranty thru retail chains is 3 years .	St
1.7.4	Given the price and the GATEWAY recommendation .	St
1.7.5	.	St
1.7.6	I 'd go for it .	St
