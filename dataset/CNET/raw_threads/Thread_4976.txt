I'm looking for a &lt;100 NAS device. I've had a look around for one, but am finding it hard to choose one. As the ones I like have more features than i would need, and have a fairly large price tag. I really like this one for example. http://reviews.cnet.com/external-hard-drives/synology-disk-station-ds/4505-3190_7-32987447.html All i really need here is a storage device for my external hardrives, that i can connect to over my home network. I also need to be able to connect to this device from my xbox 360, as i'd like to stream media to it. Hopefully someone can suggest a product that would be best for both my needs and my budget. thank you, sam
