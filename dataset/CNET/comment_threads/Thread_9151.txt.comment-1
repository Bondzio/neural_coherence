I have two monitors.
One is no more than two or three years old.
It has started blinking off.
The monitor is on but the screen goes black with a bright line going across once every few seconds.
If I turn it off and on it comes back: sometimes for the rest of the day, sometimes for a few minutes.
Could it be dying already only after three years?
The primary monitor is fine.
Can anyone help?
