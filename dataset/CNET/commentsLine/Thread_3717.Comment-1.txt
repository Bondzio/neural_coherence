i have a data disk that i recently burned on my dvd burner.
the disk was nearly full.
now, when i try to access a couple of the files on the disk (towards the end of the list) on either one of my dvd drives on my system (i have both a burner and a straight dvd drive), i can't access them.
it just stuggles with them and does't play (the files are movies).
but i tried playing them on a system at staples, and they played fine with no problem.
i have noticed some problems before accessing files on full dvd's.
my system consists of a pentium 4 running at 2.53 ghz., 256 meg memory, 2 160 gb hd's, 1 dvd +r burner and one dvd drive, all running under windows me.
i know windows me has a 4 gb file size limit, thought maybe that limitation was causing the problem.
any input would be greatly appreciated.
