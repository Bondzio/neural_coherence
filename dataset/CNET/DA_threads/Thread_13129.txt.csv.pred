1.1.1	i have recently purchased a gainward 7950gt golden sample 256mb i do alot of gaming so this cam to quite a dissapointment for me i used to have a 6600 512mb geforce(dont know the make) and in bf2 i used to get an fps of 50-60 average and ever sinse i put this 7950gt in im getting 10-20-40 fps averaging between them i have been told that i need a better power supply i currently have a 400w bog standard psu and i have been told i need one with a special slot for the graphix card http://www.hipergroup.com/English/products/power.html HPU-4R580 the pink one at the bottom i looked on reviews of this card and should be getting 100+fps and on quake 4 around 178fps at the moment i am getting 10-40 fps in bf2(battlefield2) would this power supply really make all the difference from 20fps to 100fps i just dont see how a power supply could make that much effect if anyone could please answer that would be grate thanks	Sug
1.2.1	when I looked here: http://www.mvktech.net/content/view/3482/39/1/8/ I would say check to see if you installed the drivers and also check the connection where the power supply connects to the card.	St
1.2.2	The last picture on the right shows where that extra power connection is: http://www.mvktech.net/content/view/3482/39/1/3/ If that is all ok, then I would try talking to the place you purchsed the card.	St
1.2.3	It could be that your PSU is not adequate, but I would think you would be having other problems also if the PSU is overloaded.	St
1.3.1	You have a different gpu chipset and from 512mb to 256mb ram difference, expect a slight change in output.	St
1.3.2	If the gpu box/manual suggests a PSU rating, then you need that.	St
1.3.3	Of course be sure all the drivers, etc.	St
1.3.4	are installed right.	St
1.3.5	The old drivers as well should be removed before the new video card was installed, it can cause conflict(s).	St
1.3.6	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	means you have to re-install your games so that your games can setup for that new card.	St
1.4.2	The different characteristics of different cards are setup in the software.	St
1.4.3	You might want to even go to the microsoft website and download the latest directx after you put in the drivers for it (I wouldn't even use the CD that came with it.	St
1.4.4	I'd just go to nvidia.com and download the latest drivers from there).	St
1.4.5	Also I'd check the bios and make sure the card is seated properly and plugged into the power supply.	Sug
1.4.6	I got battle field 2 and that's a terrible game, imho.	St
1.4.7	Call to duty 2 is way better.	St
1.4.8	And now there's a call to duty 3.	St
