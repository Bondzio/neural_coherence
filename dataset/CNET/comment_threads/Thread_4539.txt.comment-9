The heat has to go somewhere.
It will still be in the room if the radiator tower is in the same room.
Theoretically, it should take longer to heat the room because the computer has to heat the liquid, then the liquid will heat the cooling fins on the radiator, and finally the cooling fins have to heat the surrounding air.
Remember that water and other coolants take longer to heat (and lose heat) than many other liquids (including air).
Q: ''And what about water cooling the air entering the case?''
A: Possibly an air conditioning unit for the window...or some type of air conditioning unit for the room?
