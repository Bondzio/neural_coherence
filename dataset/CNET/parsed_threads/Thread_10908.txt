<s> first off, apologies if this was already asked. </s>
<s> I searched the forum, but found no solution to my particular problem. </s>
<s> I'm having problems detecting my hard drive. </s>
<s> Now, what I did: got a new 160Gig HD (my slave, D: ) and installed it. </s>
<s> I was able to format (via: AdminTools &gt; Comp Mgmt &gt; Disk Mgmt) it and put some data onto it. </s>
<s> I formatted and reinstalled WinXP Pro onto my master HD. </s>
<s> Both were formated as NTFS. </s>
<s> No Problem. </s>
<s> Now, when I went to MyComputer, my D: didn't show up. </s>
<s> I checked the jumpers, the BIOS and Device Manager, they all say the HD shows up/is running okay. </s>
<s> Went back to the DiskMgmt screen and the HD is innactive. </s>
<s> Right clicking on it prompts me to change it to a basic volume (which would delete everything) in order to use it - which I obviously can't do since I have some data I need on it. </s>
<s> What can I do to view the drive?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> For instance, XP doens't support over 127GB drives until SP1. </s>
<s> This drives people to frantic states since many will install XP and such a drive will do as you wrote. </s>
<s> Next the drive, if not partitioned with XP may indeed vanish. </s>

<s> You were right! </s>
<s> The service pack upgrade was the issue. </s>
<s> Very much appreciated! </s>

<s> Many lose the drive contents over that one. </s>
<s> Just asking. </s>
<s> Why didn't you tell you had reinstalled the OS? </s>
