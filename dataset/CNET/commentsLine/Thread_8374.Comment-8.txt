the general area you should go looking.
find your exact board at this site and make sure you download and install the chipset drivers and usb drivers in that order.
worst case, you blow do a fresh install again but collect the asus drivers for your board from their web site.
chipset drivers should be the first to be installed as other drivers may depend on getting these right.
