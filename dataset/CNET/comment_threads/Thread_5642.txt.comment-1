I often come across terms like the following when reading posts concerning broadband, networking and wireless: Routers, bridge, bridge modem, access points, switches and wireless adaptor.
What are these, and how, and when, are they conneted with one another ?
Yes, I can google for them, but what I can get is often technical.
What are they, in layman's language ?
I am quite sure a lot of readers of this forum would like simple explainations of the terms.
Thanks.
