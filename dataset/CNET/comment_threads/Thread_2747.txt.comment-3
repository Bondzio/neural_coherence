Speaking to Samsung they told me it as an mSATA disk.
However according to the Samsung instructions ( http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201307/20130715120101546/Win8_Manual_eng.pdf0 it has a: &quot;7mmH SATA HDD SSD&quot; (which I assume specific type of mSATA, but surely it's not a Hard Disk Drive (HDD), it's just a Solid State Drive (SSD)...
(!
).
