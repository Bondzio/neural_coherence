The recovery DVD i have created did not work. so i when online to get support. HP have this online chat thing. ok, so in the end HP support said ill give you &quot;free recovery cds&quot; it asked me for informations and stuff. so give my address and everything. (everything is good, it took about 30 mins) then when it was about to be done then it says that discard everything he have said before and asks me all the information again. Now I know that i was F#*%ing talking to a F#*$King AI. so i guess they are not sending me the recovery cds. &quot;HP have the worst support i have seen in years&quot; Ill never buy a HP computer again. People have been telling me not to buy HP, but i did not listen. Now i have learned. GO DELL. F#&$K HP. SOrry for all the miss spelling and typing errors. IM IN RAGE.
