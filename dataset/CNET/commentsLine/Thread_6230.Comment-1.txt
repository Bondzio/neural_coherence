i've received alot of great help here, and i'm hoping you can do it again.
i live in a long ranch house.
on one end i have my desktop computer and a netgear wndr3300 wireless router.
in another room, approximately 70 feet away, is another desktop computer that is not near a cable jack so i'm using a d-link airpremier dwl-g550 pci card with antenna to connect to the internet.
the connection is so-so and reception depends on the placement of the antenna.
approximately 20 feet further away is a wii which cannot detect the wireless signal.
i would like to replace the router with one that has a stronger signal that is able to reach the 90+ feet necessary to establish good connections to the computer and wii.
are newer routers able to dependably cover long distances?
most usually have disclaimers about walls, building materials, etc.
what i don't want is to buy a new router and spend several hours setting it up only to find that it's no better than the one i have now.
i was looking at the asus rt-n56u model.
i would appreciate any opinions on this or other models that would solve my problem.
thanks.
