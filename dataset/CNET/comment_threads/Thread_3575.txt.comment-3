For your situation and the age of the machine, I'd recommend starting over.
Replacing the motherboard and processor will require new memory, since your old is not likely to work with the newer hardware.
If you don't require the very latest technology, just an everyday machine for email and surfing the web, as well as business purposes, you can pick great deals on kits that will save you a bundle.
Heres a link to one such machine and there are many others.
