lets set a clear point: well made things are precious monuments from that hidden and beautiful side of human being.
firms and their brands are after our money, but when that is done with the quality reward to consumers, that is simply wonderful.
apple does that job quite like that, and also for quite a long time.
then i love linux and open source; it lives well with apple.
then i need windows too; it runs on apple.
sure, apple does play some bad tricks, but that happens one in a thousand of times you times, and on my personal experience it has never happen to damage my work.
thank you mr. jobs, commerce is a wild land and may make also of you to act as a wild and nasty person, but i understand you and support your brand.
