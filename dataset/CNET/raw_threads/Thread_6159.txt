The computer that has the booster has it's own separate built-in Wi-Fi. Is this possible? For example, the booster gets a signal from Wi-Fi network A, and I want Network A to be broadcast to the computers who can't receive Network A's signal. I really don't mind how this is done, preferably without having to buy new hardware.

My old setup at the farm was to place a WiFi BRIDGE on the window sill and then run that to a common WiFi router. I might use post 19 in the CNET NETWORKING FORUM STICKY to aid in such a setup. Bob
