i'm fairly new at setting up networks and could use some advice with this setup.
i've accomplished a wireless setup on 5 machines, but that's about the extent of my hands on experience.
i would like to network three machines for file sharing.
they all access the same t-1 line.
2 machines running windows 98se.
1 machine running xp home.
i would like for the xp machine to be the host.
i've read about different methods for setting this up.
frankly, it's a little confusing to a novice.
i would like to hear from those of you who have experience with t-1 line network setup.
also, what, if any, hardware is needed?
(router, switch, etc.)
thanks for any suggestions.
ernie
