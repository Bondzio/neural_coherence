If you want autocad, you can go to the Autodesk - student site.
It will require a school based email address to register with the site.
Once you get registered you can down load a student version of autocad for free (last year they were giving a choice of the civil engineering or the electrical engineering versions... which both include the basic version).
One thing.
autocad only runs in a windows environment.
If you have a MS machine or if you have a mac-intel capable of booting up in windows you will be covered.
If you have a power pc mac then you are out of luck in running autocad.
