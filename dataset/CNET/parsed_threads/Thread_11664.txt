<s> I recently acquired an old PowerSpec PC (model 7670) that I want to use as a simple home file server. </s>
<s> I want to stick a couple of 400 GB SATA harddrives and a RAID controller card in, and I also think I'll need to upgrade the 150W power supply (I've removed the floppy & extra CD-ROM drives). </s>
<s> This is the one that's in the system now: http://www.mecbatec.com/Documents/FP150N80.pdf I'm thinking I just need a 300-400W power supply (plus either no fan or silent running fan) but I'm not quite sure what to look for. </s>
<s> All products on newegg seem like the ATX version might not be compatible with such an old system. </s>
<s> Based on some research I *think* I could get by with an ATX 12v 1.x unit, or perhaps older would work. </s>
<s> I'm just wondering what exactly I should look for, if anyone had any suggestions, and what sites would be good for looking up / purchasing an older power supply. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I see what looks like a bog standard ATX supply. </s>
<s> Today's newer ATX 12V units even with the newer 24 pin ATX connection let me slip off the 4 pins and it's back to 20 pin ATX. </s>
<s> All that you need to do is check the mechanical or &quot;does it fit?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> 24 pin connector that separates into a 20+4 should work. </s>
<s> If used for a server running 24/7/365, pay attention to efficiency as cheap PSUs are not usually efficient power wise. </s>
<s> Getting a better quality, high reliability, high-efficiency PSU would be the way I'd go. </s>
<s> PSUs that meet the aforementioned criteria should be easy to find online or at your favorite local vendor. </s>
