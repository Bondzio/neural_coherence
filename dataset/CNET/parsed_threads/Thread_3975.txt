<s> My cimena display connect using the minidisplay port is not showing any image, but everything else is working. </s>
<s> Any idea? </s>
<s> And do other computers work with this port/display? </s>
<s> Hello, Every Mac with a Mini DisplayPort allows you to connect an external display or projector using an adapter. </s>
<s> You can use an external display as your main workspace or to extend your desktop, or you can work in mirrored mode with a projector so you can view what your audience sees. </s>
<s> Use the Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter to connect an advanced digital monitor, such as the 20- or 23-inch Apple Cinema Display, that includes a DVI connector. </s>
<s> Review the documentation or check with the manufacturer of your monitor to make sure you're choosing the right adapter. </s>
<s> The new CinemaView displays will be available in 19, 20.1 and 24-inch sizes, with display resolutions of 1440 x 900 pixels, 1680 x 1050 and 1920 x 1080 respectively. </s>
<s> Each of them complements Apple's industrial design cues -- they feature aluminum stands, black bezels and glass fronts. </s>
