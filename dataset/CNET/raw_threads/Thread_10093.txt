I transfered all of my files to the external drive and everything went fine. I then installed a new internal hard drive and set up windows. I loaded up the software for the Maxtor hd and everything was installed but the drive isn't showing up in my computer. I set it up in disk management but when I try to double click the drive it says that it's not formatted, do i want to format now. What do I do? I don't want to have to reconnect the old drive and transer stuff over again. Is there something I did wrong?

Don't format or even attach such a drive to avoid this trouble until the service pack and all drivers are installed. Bob PS. More details at http://www.48bitlba.com

It's a common problem and could be easy to solve. Use http://www.usbman.com as well as Google.com to find BELARC ADVISOR, EVEREST to identify your machine's parts. Best of luck, Bob

Proffitt	2/12/06 10:02 AM	1.13973852E12	Link with some fixes.	http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7590-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=28919&messageID=328179 lists other items such as assigning a drive letter, connection to the rear USB ports and more. Since you have a Dell, use Dell's drivers for your machine. Installation of said drivers are not automatic. Bob
