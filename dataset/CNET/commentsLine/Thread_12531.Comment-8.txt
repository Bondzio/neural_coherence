re: &quot;...not all esata are hot-swappable, so was this unit power on before bootup?...&quot; what exactly is the desired sequence?
i tried a couple of times, thinking along those lines, but not quite sure what my objective was.
the lacie documentation says they are, but i have little faith in the drive documentation.
its been pretty bad so far.
one thing i did notice on the drive that may be of interest is that the on/off switch is actually a 3-way rocker switch with &quot;auto&quot; being the middle position.
with usb, the auto position causes the light to be blue.
with esata, only the on position will put the blue light on.
i read that auto means it will hibernate when not in use.
sounds like an ok feature, but maybe not true for esata cnx.
thx for the heads-up on firewire warnings.
