Sorry folks...as I have noted in the past I know very,, very little about the technical aspects of computering.
What information do I need to provide in order to elicit some educated guesses??????
__ Today (Thursday) I also had dropped connections; inability to get on the internet at times (page cannot be displayed is tiring to see) and emails not going through or being received (&quot;server interrupted&quot;).
THe internet provider says the telephone line connection looks fine but...who knows????
I'll try to provide whatever information is requested.........
I have Microsoft XP Professional operating system.. but I don't know what else to add.
Thank you to everyone who has given me suggestions during past &quot;crises&quot; Mill
