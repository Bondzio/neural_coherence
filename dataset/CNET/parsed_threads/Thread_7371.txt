<s> Hello =) I recently got my Desktop repaired,it got a new motherboard =) Now with this new motherboard,there's an intergrated video card(GeForce 7 series),or at least thats what the box says. </s>
<s> I'm having a hard time choosing between which one of my two video cards to use. </s>
<s> My ATI Radeon 1600x Saffire Crossfire or the intergrated GeForce 7 Series?Is there any ways to know which video card is stronger? </s>
<s> My Motherboard is MSI P6NGM(Nvidia MCP73 Series Chipset Based,if that can help) On a side-note,any way to know which GeForce 7 is it is exactly? </s>
<s> NOTE:Apparently because the GeForce 7 is intergrated into the motherboard,it will have to use memory directly from my computer,so that might be a con. </s>
<s> Sorry for bad english, -DigitalFrost </s>
<s> After a little bit of research I think I found the name of the intergrated video card,its an GeForce 7150. </s>
<s> I tried VideoCard comparison website but none had the GeForce 7150 listed. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
