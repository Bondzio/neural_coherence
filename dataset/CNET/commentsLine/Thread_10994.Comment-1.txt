i just wanted to mention that i was so upset about the teck support at dell i wrote a letter on 1/20/05 and i received a call from the head office today.
he was very nice and i told him there were many many customers who are unhapply about the support.
he said he wished more people let him know about a problem with the support so they know where they stand.
i am only posting this to suggest that anyone who has had problems write a letter so they are aware of how many customers are/were dissatisfied.
