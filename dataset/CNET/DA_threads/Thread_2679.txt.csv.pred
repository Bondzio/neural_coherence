1.1.1	i have laptop running windows xp pro and a desktop with windows98 that i would like to network together.	St
1.1.2	ive tried with no success.	St
1.1.3	the laptop is wireless and i use a linksys router.	St
1.1.4	the desktop ,however, is connected through the modem via USB due to the fact it does not have ethernet.	St
1.1.5	on both when i go to the network they just have themselves on there and not the other.	St
1.1.6	another problem is i can ping from my laptop to my desktop but i cant the other way around.	St
1.1.7	can anyone tell me how i could network these together?	Ques
1.2.1	as a router, it supposed to have several rj45/ethernet port.	St
1.3.1	a USB connection, you will need to ask your ISP for an ethernet type of modem or buy a router that does.	St
1.4.1	Have you checked the Network Properties, in particular the configuration of your network card?	St
1.4.2	I played with the different speeds and eventually found some settings that let all my computers talk to each other.	St
1.4.3	Double-click on the network-connected icon in your taskbar, then Properties.	St
1.4.4	Before you click Configure, just see if both your computers have the same things under 'This connection uses the following items'.	St
1.4.5	It's not important that they do, but the experts say that they should.	St
1.4.6	Best, Jack	St
