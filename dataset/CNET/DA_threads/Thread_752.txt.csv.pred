1.2.1	Have you tried using a wireless booster first this my work as it lets use position then through out the house so that you can get a stronger signal down stairs and farther.	St
1.2.2	http://www.frys.com/product/7229603?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG	St
1.3.1	A wired home network would be ideal if you don't mind doing the work of running wires.	St
1.3.2	Once you run the wires, you can even add wireless access points at those places where you need better wireless coverage.	St
1.3.3	If you want to avoid the work though, you may want to try out power line network adapters.	St
1.3.4	They have worked well for me in a variety of situations, and allow you the flexibility of moving the adapters to different areas of the house to give you connectivity.	St
1.3.5	You can even add WAPs to these as well for wireless coverage in weak areas.	St
1.4.1	As another poster mentioned, if you can run the cables I'd do it since that would give you some options, wireless access points etc.	St
1.4.2	If you are going to do the cable runs use CAT-6 instead of CAT-5, if you can, since chances are you will eventually upgrade your hardware, specifically the modem/ router from a G series to a more current N and CAT-6 would give you a potential for better throughput.	St
1.4.3	Good luck!!	St
1.4.4	!	St
