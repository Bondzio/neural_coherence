the error explains upon getting the error, open cover and remove the *right* inkcart then close cover and open again.
if the light remains lit(non-blinking) ink cart you removed is the a problem.
if the led continues to blink, then the remaining ink cart still mounted is the problem one, buy a replacement for the one that it refers to.
review your error again:  does it make sense now?
