I decided the best bet was to swap the hard drive into another old system to get back up and running ASAP. The first time I started up with the two drives in the second unit, I got the warning the CMOS battery was critically low. I worked on the system getting everything right and shut down. I added more RAM (have since removed the extra RAM after the problem) but now I can't get the second system even to POST. I removed everything back to its original setup, changed the CMOS battery for a brand new one and still nothing. I am at a loss and am limited to what I have started as fixes. Any help?
