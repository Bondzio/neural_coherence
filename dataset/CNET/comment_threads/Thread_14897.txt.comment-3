Thank you for your initial help.
Here are the macmall.com bundles: http://www.macmall.com/macmall/families/macbook/ are any of them really a deal though?
And while I have you do you have any recommendations on how to save a little money?
Also, should I be waiting for the next generation of the macbook?
could you tell me the most optimal configuration for small business (business plan writing, creating brochures, web design and management) and personal use (lots of pictures, tons of music, web surfing, file sharing).
You will be the final piece of my research.
Thanks again.
