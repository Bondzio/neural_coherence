1.3.1	Not sure if your still haveing a problem but .	Res
1.3.2	I went to the GIGABYTE Website and notice that they have 2 BIOS upgrades for the motherboard that im seeing .	St
1.3.3	About updating BIOS ...	St
1.3.4	The whole BIOS updating procedure should be treated with extreme caution .	St
1.3.5	If you do not encounter any system instability or bugs with the current BIOS version , we suggest that you keep it .	St
1.3.6	If you determine to flash BIOS , you are taking a personal risk of BIOS flash failure .	St
1.3.7	Please contact your supplier or our distributors/resellers for further remedy in case system crashes unfortunately because of BIOS flash failure .	Sug
1.3.8	Before you begin ... 1 .	St
1.3.9	Please make sure the BIOS version you want to flash matches your motherboard model .	Sug
1.3.10	2 .	St
1.3.11	If your BIOS is flash protected , please do not enable BIOS Flash Protection under Advanced CMOS Setup ( AMI BIOS ) or Advanced BIOS Features ( AWARD BIOS ) in BIOS menu .	St
1.3.12	3 .	St
1.3.13	Never interrupt when you BIOS is being updated .	St
1.3.14	GA-6OXET Intel 815EP chipset F11c ( Beta ) 2002/5/15 Update Micro code http : //biosupgrade.notlong.com/ *DOWNLOAD* F10 2002/1/23 Support I/O chip : ITE8712 G version Fixed FAN control in suspend item function not work http : //biosgigaf10.notlong.com/ *DOWNLOAD* *Please remember to & quot ; Load Optimize Defaults & quot ; ( in the BIOS Setup ) after updating new BIOS And im not sure if this is the case , But i went to the Intel Website because the motherboard has the Intel 815EP AGPset Right ?	Ques
1.3.15	I seen that it said for that you used the Intel Chipset Software Installation Utility http : //IntelChipSet.notlong.com	St
1.4.1	& quot ; Fixed FAN control in suspend item function not work & quot ; This is typical Pidgen English from Gigabyte .	St
1.4.2	They make great mobos , but have no one that can write a clear English sentence .	St
1.4.3	I had the Dual Bios in a later version mobo and never could figure from the wording in the manual .	St
1.4.4	The following , again from Dragons good input , is an example of a Gigabyte statement that seemd to make no sense .	St
1.4.5	& quot ; 2 .	St
1.4.6	If your BIOS is flash protected , please do not enable BIOS Flash Protection under Advanced CMOS Setup ( AMI BIOS ) or Advanced BIOS Features ( AWARD BIOS ) in BIOS menu & quot ; Somehow how I think that the flash protection is preventing you from flashing the BIOS .	St
1.4.7	Email Gigabyte and instead of clarifying the answer , they will simply send reference the exact same statement back to you .	St
1.4.8	Decided to use ABIT mobos , simply because their manuals and website stuff is written such that one can understand them .	St
1.5.1	Maybe it 's time to get a new board ?	Ques
1.6.1	Thanks for the help but have downloaded all bios updates and intel chip updates .	St
1.6.2	Installed intel updates fine , but would not update bios .	St
1.6.3	Even used gigabytes own bios flash program .	St
1.6.4	It flashes the bios to the version I want , but then after I load optized defaults and reboots the bios goes back to f7 .	St
1.6.5	Will have to stay with 98se for now .	St
1.7.1	Thanks for the math lesson Mr.Moderator , Seriously though I 've got a couple other computers with the kids and all , but made this one a while ago .	St
1.7.2	Just wanted to update and upgrade everything , but seems I ca n't at the moment .	St
1.7.3	thanks again	Polite
1.8.1	I was born in somerset , England	St
1.9.1	found the problem , one word 'JUMPERS ' The jumper for the flash protection was n't on default .	St
1.9.2	Did n't even think of the jumpers .	St
