Will the camera come with software so that if I bought two I could connect with my daughter, or will we have to use Messenger, ICQ, Yahoo etc.?
If so, which one of those should I use?
Yes and most end up using either the supplied or one of the packages you listed.
I can't say why people choose one over the other.
On the Mac they use what it comes with because &quot;it works.&quot; Bob
