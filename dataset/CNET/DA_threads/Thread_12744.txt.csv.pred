1.1.1	My HP laptop of 4 yrs died this last summer and at the time I was pretty sure that something on the motherboard or power supply had burned up because of the awful smell .	St
1.1.2	I thought I would pull the hard drive out of it and use it for a backup drive .	St
1.1.3	I went out to Newegg and picked up a NexStar CX external enclosure and put the hard drive in it and connected it to my desktop via a USB cable and my desktop wo n't even recognize it - its like its not even hooked up .	St
1.1.4	So then I tried hooking it up to another laptop I have and got the same results .	St
1.1.5	Is there anything in Windows 7 that I need to do to get it to recognize it ? ?	Ques
1.1.6	Or is the hard drive just dead ? ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	If the enclosure is OK and it has enough power ( can you use an power adaptor , a powered USB-hub or an USB Y-cable ) it most likely is the disk .	St
1.2.2	Try with another disk to be sure ?	Ques

1.3.3	2 .	St

1.3.5	If no data recovery is an issue I just wipe it and start over .	St
