first off, i have never dealed with power supplies before.
the specs of my system are 512 mb ram, 2.5 ghz pentium 4, 80 gb hard drive.
it's decent for what i need.
anyway, i went to class this morning (i'm a college student) and i turned it off before i left.
when i returned, i went to turn it on and it didn't respond.
i tried flipping the switch in the back, didn't work, flipped it back, didn't work, unplugged it for 20 minutes then came back and tried it again, didn't work.
there is a small red switch on the back, one way says 15 the other says 230 on my power supply.
i tried flipping that, didn't work.
my computer is a northgate i-1, power supply is an iso-300 and my computer won't turn on.
someone help me please!!
!
