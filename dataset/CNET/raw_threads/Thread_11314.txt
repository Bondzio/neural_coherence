Twice this week, my keyboard simply stopped inputting any characters--either in a browser or MS Word document. After the first time, I looked in the Device Manager and the keyboard wasn't listed at all. I rebooted and everything was back to normal again--until just this evening. Another reboot took care of this. But I'm wondering now why this is happening. I am using a Dell Inspiron 1501 (Vista) and the drivers for this laptop on their support site don't have one for the keyboard.

A typical laptop is already provided its drivers for the system itself by the maker and/or the OS. No separate driver should be required unless unique. What you may need to do, is either try a &quot;restore point&quot; when the problem didn't exist or a OS repair. An OS repair will make the required fixes by refreshing the OS. This method shouldn't replace or delete your current pgms. etc. already loaded. It will however require access to the Vista restore/recovery(OEM) discs or from the hidden partition for same purpose. Vendors and makers provide OEM discs for some small cost or free(maybe?) if not shipped with system, contact them or website to order, it always good to have these discs &quot;in hand&quot;. Review your manual or visit the maker support website in order how to access this process. As always, backup any critical data or use the maker's process to create a system recovery/restore disc. Again visit the makers' support website for detailed info. I exclude any possible real h/w fault and this maybe a cause of your problem. Only a kybd. replacement will fix it if nothing seems to work. If you have any warranty, use it or call service support to attempt fix. When asking for help provide all details of your system, etc. in order to better respond to your query. tada -----Willy
