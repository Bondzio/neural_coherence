pentium 4 2.4 ghz os: windows xp video card: 7600 gs each time i'm going in intervideo home theater(the recording software with the installation cd) or virtual dub to try recording, my computer freezes.
i have remove sp2(you need sp2 to install everything) and reinstall it and it's still not working.
the light on the gamebridge is green, it means it is ready to record.
