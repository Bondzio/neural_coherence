<s> Hi Guys, I hope I am in the right place. </s>
<s> I am plannign on building a new computer. </s>
<s> I did it several years ago and then went to buying the dells. </s>
<s> Currently I have a dell 4600. </s>
<s> It just does not do the trick anymore. </s>
<s> I want to build a really decent machine. </s>
<s> I prefer intel chips but I could be swayed. </s>
<s> I currently have an ATI 9600 AGP video card which is good enough for now. </s>
<s> It would be great if I can use my existing memory but I am okay if I can't. </s>
<s> So here is the questions Which MB shoudl I buy Which Processor chip should I buy Case? </s>
<s> Currently I am fine wiht my HD's Just want to know what I should be looking for. </s>
<s> I would like to keep the system under $1,000 being that I have the video card, hd's and possibly some memory I don't thik it should be that hard. </s>
<s> Please let me know what I shoudl buy. </s>
<s> I try and keep my machines for abour 3 years. </s>
<s> I want this to be totally compatible with vista and run fast as well. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> I am assuming I am going to get a 64 bit processor. </s>
<s> Do I need to use xp 64 bit (I have it) If I do, are some of my components not compatible? </s>
<s> Or.. Do I need to go with a duel boot? </s>
<s> not much of a use...wait till vista... dont think u can dual boot 2 versions of xp u will need a motherboard. </s>
<s> list the specs of your current computer...such as ram specs? </s>
<s> motherboard? </s>
<s> processor? </s>
<s> etc. </s>
<s> processor...right now i would go with an amd athlon x2 3800+. </s>
<s> amd outperforms intel and runs cooler. </s>
<s> ram...dpeending on whether u can salvage case: your choice... powersupply- i would recommend antec, seasonic, enermax, pc power and cooling, has to be at least 400-450watts optical drives- dvd burner? </s>
<s> and for the graphics card? </s>
<s> i dont think it is that good...and considering the prices of graphics cards have dropped so much.... i would recommend the 6800gs which can be had for about $160. </s>
<s> if u want to spend like 100-150 more...get the newer 7900gt. </s>
<s> but both are way faster than the 9600 u use. </s>
<s> with a better graphics card, you can play newer games or older games at higher resoultions and settings and have much better visual quality. </s>
<s> and keyboard, mouse, speakers, and monitor </s>
<s> a link http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/expert/russel_september10.mspx </s>
<s> there are many threads about people with athlon x2's having weird problems while playing games. </s>
<s> in a few years, all games will be designed for dual cores, but in the meantime... </s>
<s> okay so here is where i am so far I just got the MB and processor any comments? </s>
<s> Thank you for all of your responses. </s>
<s> So far here is where I am at with this: Processor http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103562 AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ Manchester 1GHz HT 2 x 512KB L2 Cache Socket 939 Dual Core Processor cost $295 motherboard ASUS A8R32 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131004 cost $209 Before I go any furthur am I heading on the right track? </s>
<s> Just a tip. </s>
<s> Don't buy your computer yet. </s>
<s> Wait until the neew AMD processors com out so that the price of the AMD Athlon X2 3800+ goes down. </s>
<s> The same with the motherboard. </s>
<s> I also recommend the Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe. </s>
<s> Its not a new MB but it has won a lot of awards. </s>
<s> &gt; I think I may go with the ASRock 939Dual-SATA2 ATX. </s>
<s> This MB has a AGP slot as well as a PCI express slot. </s>
<s> So I can use my old agp video card which is still a very powerful card. </s>
<s> Wait for AMD Socket AM2. </s>
<s> It supports DDR2 memory which is better than DDR. </s>
<s> It will also work with Vista like the other 64bit cpus. </s>
