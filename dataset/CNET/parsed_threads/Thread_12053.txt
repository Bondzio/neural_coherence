<s> I really dont know much about computers, I would definitely build my own gaming rig if I did. </s>
<s> If I had tons to spend I would go with something a site like FalconNW or something, but Im looking to spend around $850. </s>
<s> Im looking at Cyberpower, Im thinking an AMD PhenomII X4 cpu with a Radeon 5760 gpu. </s>
<s> 1)Is this pretty good for gaming? </s>
<s> If so, how long will it be sufficient for running most games? </s>
<s> 2)What should I know about matching the mobo with the cpu, if the mb says amd...is that all I really need to worry about? </s>
<s> 3)Case size...I dont ever think I will need to run a setup with more than one gpu, I dont play high end fps titles. </s>
<s> Can I just go with the default case? </s>
<s> 4) What is an internal usb extension module? </s>
<s> What is a motherboard expansion card? </s>
<s> Do I need these? </s>
<s> Any help would really be appreciated, Im in over my head a little </s>
<s> also...I found a few extremely negative reviews about cyberpower. </s>
<s> Lots of positive ones but the negative ones are scaring me a bit, a couple said they dont test the systems before shipping. </s>
<s> Does anyone have suggestions as far as comparably priced vendors? </s>
<s> ibuypower perhaps? </s>
<s> CyperPower is nothing more than a 3rd party building systems with typical off shelf components and putting them in a glitzy case. </s>
<s> You can do all that just as well. </s>
<s> What many consumers complain about is generally they ordering a top-end PC and putting through its paces on gamers demands. </s>
<s> These users are generally the most demanding punishing out there. </s>
<s> Make no bones about it, they want the best for the least yet don't really put the effort to really get things going smoothly. </s>
<s> You can't OC and expect things to always be good. </s>
<s> You can't push the PC to the extremes and expect good results. </s>
<s> You can't allow the PC to cook in heat bath for long. </s>
<s> You really can't play for hrs. </s>
<s> on high output and then expect to run every day like that. </s>
<s> You CAN only if the $ is spend, wisely installed components and everyday TLC. </s>
<s> Usage of only the best components and pay attention to the small details. </s>
<s> Cooling and more cooling and make it work. </s>
<s> Follow the hints/tips/clues of any hic-up via some gamers forum, drivers forum, s/w forum and/or basic google hits. </s>
<s> Of course, if CyperPower ships a piece of crap, well that speaks for itself. </s>
<s> Check your wishlist against all those gaemr PC systems and see what makes them tick. </s>
<s> -OR- look into high-end PCs and just what they offer and see if you can build one. </s>
<s> I generally advise now, is to get a big case, big and namebrand PSU and any cooling options. </s>
<s> Then build on that because those 3-items I mentioned are not overlooked or taken for granted and/or shortsighted with regard to the classy items a PC will need. </s>
<s> That's all..... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Unless you are very rich there is no such thing as a off the shelf 'gaming computer'. </s>
<s> The majority of gamers build their own. </s>
<s> That way you can assemble a computer without spending mega bucks. </s>
<s> As you claim you are not too computer literate start by googling the web for the fastest CPU, the best video cards and the best motherboard. </s>
<s> Make a note on the specifications, and price of each component. </s>
<s> This would give you an idea of the cost. </s>
<s> Don't get caught up with the 'speed' hype. </s>
<s> A good dual processor will blow the doors off of a quad or even a six CPU. </s>
<s> Remember that Intel is better than AMD. </s>
<s> You also would want to get the best power supply, and RAM you can afford along with a good mid size case. </s>
<s> Goto all the forums and glean them for information. </s>
<s> This way you will be able to get a good computer without buying a ready made one. </s>
<s> My saying on this is 'Get a PC at Bestbuy,Walmart etc Get a Computer by building it yourself'. </s>
<s> With modern computer parts it is quite easy to assemble your own. </s>
<s> Gone are the days where you had to jumper motherboards and needed an engineering degree to set one up. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> thanks guys, i appreciate the feedback. </s>
<s> at this point i think i am actually going to attempt to build it myself. </s>
<s> i have been watching build your own pc vids on youtube like crazy, and i really think i can do it! </s>
<s> i have learned more about computers in the last four days than i have in my entire existence on this planet. </s>
<s> im really excited, thanks alot guys </s>
