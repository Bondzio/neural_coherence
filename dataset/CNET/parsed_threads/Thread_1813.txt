<s> Hi Everyone Can anyone tell me when installing a hard drive I usually put the jumper to Master or Slave but there is normally another option called &quot;CS&quot; What does this stand for &quot;Cabke Select&quot; or something else and when would you use this jumper position. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> If you use the cable select jumper position, placement of the cables connector determins whether drive is master or slave. </s>
<s> The 80 conductor cables use color coded connectors. </s>
<s> The easist thing to remember is that the master drive resides furthest from the motherboard connection. </s>
<s> Thanks to all who answered this question. </s>
