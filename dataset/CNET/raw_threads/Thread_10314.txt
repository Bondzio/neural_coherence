Where is that red x? I've never seen a router with a red x, so that's unclear. The thing to look for, I think: the encoding (WEP, WPA, WPA2) and the password. Those must match between the router and the laptop/ps2. If your father changed that, all existing devices won't work anymore. The workaround will cost your father some 60 dollar: buy a new router and set it up exactly like you did setup the old one. That should work, shouldn't it? Kees
