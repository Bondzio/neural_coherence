<s> So, i am on a somewhat tight budget and am looking for a projector costing around $500... </s>
<s> It will be mostly used for movie watching and occasional gaming. </s>
<s> I would of course like it to be HD (at least 720p) but i understand it may be a stretch for the price? </s>
<s> Perhaps you know of some sort of sale or clearance (with the whole black friday or cybermonday ordeal)... Any help is appreciated, thanks. </s>
<s> Hard to find for that price, look at Optima or Epson, they both make decent reasonably priced units. </s>
<s> 1. portability 2. big projection, otherwise I preferred a regular TV. </s>
<s> The bad part about projectors are; the good one are very expensive also the great screens are also very expensive (and I don't think $500 budget will do). </s>
<s> Of course a white wall would do (but crappie). </s>
<s> Personally I probably look for a 32&quot;-40&quot; TV instead. </s>
<s> What your reason/s for the projector? </s>
<s> Portability is the main reason why I would prefer a projector over a large TV... </s>
<s> I just thought that since its the thanksgiving weekend and cybermonday is coming up there might be some sales that would bring a decent projector down to my price line. </s>
<s> thanks for your help. </s>
