Mac/Apple anyone?? May be the right time right now with the Mac/Intel connection. $$$$$$ Wow and maybe. Just a guess on my part. Bob, have you purchased that Mac/Intel laptop for your son yet? Really sound amazing to me. Wish I had some extra cash to send one to my son also. Impressive stats. Just as a note, how long would it take in a learning curve to switch over to a Mac/Intel platform for an average student that was used to a Windows PC? -Kevin

Unfortunately, every version with Mac or Windows introduction still presents a new and longer leaning curve for all. More bells and whistles that will never ever seem to stop. Learning the bells is like buildind a sand castle. Learning the whistles, is akin to stopping the tide from coming in and to prevent it from destroying your sand workNice try! Until the next version. -Kevin
