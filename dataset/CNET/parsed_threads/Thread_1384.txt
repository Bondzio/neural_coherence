<s> Hi all, I'm having a particularly annoying problem with my PC at home. </s>
<s> At seemingly random intervals, the power will just die. </s>
<s> Then it won't come back on. </s>
<s> I have to unplug the power cord from the outlet end and then plug it back in before the PC will turn on again. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what would cause such a bizarre problem? </s>
<s> The sudden power loss isn't as baffling as the fact that I have to unplug and plug it back in again. </s>
<s> Could a flaky power cord be the culprit? </s>
<s> (It's never that simple, I know...) </s>
<s> I have a machine that requires such a power up and the cause is a malfunctioning motherboard. </s>
<s> Since it will power up, the kid has learned to do this and we'll wait for the day it dies altogether. </s>
<s> Cost to repair? </s>
<s> From 25 to 99 bucks for the replacement motherboard. </s>
<s> Another machine had a too small power supply. </s>
<s> For under 30 bucks I found the 680 watt PSU at newegg or geeks.com. </s>
<s> That fixed that. </s>
<s> I never skimp on the PSU size. </s>
<s> While it can be an issue, you can sniff out if it's a cooling issure by leaving the case cover off. </s>
<s> Thest machines do need a yearly dusting but no one tells everyone. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I did notice that it tended to stay running longer with the side of the case opened. </s>
<s> The cooling issue would explain the sudden power loss, but what about the weird unplug thing? </s>
<s> Here I know it's a bum motherboard on the kid's machine. </s>
<s> However with heat issues the board or PSU can be in an odd state and needs the full power off to reset. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> After a thermal event a power supply will not...supply power until the power has been cycled or the temperature has returned to normal operating levels </s>
<s> Good to know. </s>
<s> I'll give my PC a thorough dust cleaning tonight, as the problem has only recently begun. </s>
<s> Thanks for everyone who helped out on this one! </s>
