The whole thing runs like a dream. The video card I have installed is an ATI Radeon X1600/1650 . Recently, I moved and I now have my PC connected to two monitors: my usual monitor, an LG, on which the graphics are fantastic; and I am also now using a 32 inch widescreen Insignia TV monitor as well. I've been using the same video card for the past two years, but when I connected it to the TV monitor, the resolution was awful. Text is fuzzy to the point of being unreadable, and the graphics for my usual PC games is really, really sub-par. It is so bad that it hardly makes sense to use the TV monitor. I tried updating the drivers, but to no avail. I read here and there that there was no driver for my card that would fix the resolution problem. Thus, I'm in the market for a new video card. It's about that time, anyway. My question is, what should I be looking for in a video card in the market now to make sure it will fix the resolution problem? I've read that a lot of video cards now are capable of widescreen resolutions specifically for using TVs as computer monitors, but I don't know what I should be looking for in the specs. Can someone give me some advice? Or tell me that I'm an idiot and there's an easy fix for my current video card's woes? Thanks all!

Like I said, I've tried installing new and old drivers, and nothing has fixed it. But sure--I'll e-mail ATI. Thanks for the tip. Still looking for input, however.

It's just text and gaming that are awful. My boyfriend kept telling me that the resolution was something like 1300 x 700, but I just checked it and it's 1024 x 768 right now. Another strange thing about the resolution is that if you go any higher than 1024 x 768, the desktop doesn't adjust to fit the screen. Instead, you would have to move the mouse toward one of the edges of the screen and it will scroll to show you the whole image.
