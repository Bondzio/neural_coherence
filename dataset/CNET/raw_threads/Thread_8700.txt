I already have a VSAT connection to the Internet that I use for my Internet Cafe. I am trying to extend my wireless service to some homes in the immediate vicinity (1 mile radius). I have installed a 15dbi omni antenna at the top of our buliding connetected to a DLINK (Dl-614+) wireless router. I also have an amplifier connected to it. Length of cable (between omni and AP) is 98 ft. What is ideal for the end-user computer to receive good signal? Driving around with my wireless enabled laptop, I can see my wireless network, and can connect to it but within a very short distance of the building. I have tried connecting from within a prospective subscriber's living room just 1/3 of a mile away and could not see the AP. Do subscribers need special equipments to connect? How come I cannot connect with a regular wireless card or USB wireless adapter?

You could use multiple wifi routers or more correctly WAPS and use a directional antenna for north, south or north, south, east and west while setting each WAP to a different channel. As you move out, you have to populate your system with RANGE EXPANDERS. Good luck. Bob

My intended coverage area is actually less than half a mile. Is there any other solution for my current setup? Are there external Wi-Fi antennas that would work for my subcribers to receive signals from the AP?

Look over http://www.freeantennas.com/projects/template/ which is probably the best trick in the book without having to heat up any solder iron. You can help out the user's end this way. If you are looking for magic, there is none here. Bob
