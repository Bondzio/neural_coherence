<s> Hi All, Any recommendations for a good passive wifi antenna that I can plug into the USB port of my Win7 laptop? </s>
<s> I want to pick up a weak wifi signal. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Not sure what you mean by passive. </s>
<s> If you want a USB device to in effect amplify the signal to your internal wireless card I have not see such a device. </s>
<s> To be truly &quot;Passive&quot; you would have to hook a antenna directly to the internal wireless card. </s>
<s> You have 2 options. </s>
<s> You can use what is called a signal extender to amplify and repeat the signal or you can use a USB based card that allows you to attach external antenna. </s>
<s> Some signal repeaters also can take external antenna. </s>
<s> All depends if you must have it USB connected or you can tolerate a second box. </s>
<s> The extenders are a little easier to get a store if that is a consideration. </s>
