Ellie, As soon as possible, have her run the Recovery CD-DVD creator to make System Recovery DVDs and a Recovery Tools CD.
(t is good you didn't make a set and send them to her, because according to the documentation, you can only make 1 set of each.)
I don't know exactly where your documentation is; with my HP, the necessary information is in the PC Troubleshooting and System Recovery Guide manual.
My system required 2 DVDs for the Recovery disks and 1 CD for the Recovery Tools.
You also use the Recovery Tools Cd to remove the partition if you want to.
Glad all is well.
