Hi I'm having a post message issue that i need to resolve.
My specs are as follow: Operating System System Model Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2 (build 2600) ASUSTeK Computer INC. A7N8X REV 1.xx Processor a Main Circuit Board b 2.00 gigahertz AMD Athlon XP 128 kilobyte primary memory cache 256 kilobyte secondary memory cache Board: ASUSTeK Computer INC. A7N8X REV 1.xx Bus Clock: 133 megahertz BIOS: Phoenix Technologies, LTD ASUS A7N8X ACPI BIOS Rev 1017 Beta 005 T9 12/06/2002 Drives Memory Modules c,d 80.02 Gigabytes Usable Hard Drive Capacity 54.18 Gigabytes Hard Drive Free Space ok my issue is that when i boot on my computer roars then after 1 min it also it will stop.
But when it first boots up it says, System failed due to CPU overclocking.
I've never changed the bios i did the troubleshoot in the bios and everything is in default/optimal.
So i have no idea what the problem is and i really would appreciate the help.
Thanxs sweety249
