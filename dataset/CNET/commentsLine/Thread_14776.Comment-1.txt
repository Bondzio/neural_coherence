have a belkin play n600 router with tomato v 1.28 on it.
both the 2.4 and 5 ghz frequencies often seem to reduce throughput speeds substantially when i use them and then completely disable completely (both bands disable at same time even when i'm using just one).
to get back online, i have to either turn on/off router or manually enable the wireless bands again through a wired connection and the tomato gui.
what's going on?
