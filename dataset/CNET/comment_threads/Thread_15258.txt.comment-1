I have an Emachine T5026, had it for about 2 years.
If you look at the Cnet reviews the big flaw with it is it has no AGP or PCI-Express slot.
My question is should I just get a regular PCI graphics card or upgrade my motherboard, which means I would be upgrading my CPU to a dual core(just because I want one) and would need new memory.
Are regular PCI graphics card any good, I know that the PCI-express is the current technology, but would I be able to get by maybe another year and just use my free PCI slot.
Thanks
