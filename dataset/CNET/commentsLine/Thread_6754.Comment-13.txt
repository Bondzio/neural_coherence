i will take my laptop either later today or tomorrow to a place that has wifi connections to see if i can connect and/or see other network connections.
where would i go to find the what i'm using to manage the network connections?
in the mean time i didn't know if you needed to know this but when i right click my wireless network connection and click properties i then go to wireless network tab and the box that says &quot;use windows to configure my wireless network settings&quot; is checked.
i have also removed the networks listed under &quot;preferred networks&quot;.
i really appreciate all the help you are trying to give me as i've talked with linksys and done what they have suggested and they're saying its not the router but the laptop and i'm just wanting to make sure which is before i do anything.
