Thanks to all of you for your help.
Bob & Willy, both of these HDs are indeed in the same system and one mounted on top of the other, so overheating looks like the problem.
In that case, I can expect it to happen again if I don't take action, which I will.
nerdyboy1234, I think you've reassured me as to Maxtor's durability.
So I can stop looking at other makes...
Thanks again, Chalkbel.
