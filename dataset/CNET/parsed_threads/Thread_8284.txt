<s> I recently got a new power supply for my Dell Dimension 8100. </s>
<s> And now i can't turn my computer on. </s>
<s> The on/off button flashes orange when power is going to the computer and when i touch it, nothing happens. </s>
<s> I know power is getting to the motherboard, so i think the power supply is fine. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> check ur connections. </s>
<s> must not have plugged in the psu to something maybe hard drive, cpu fan, etc. </s>
<s> make sure everything has power and its connected securely. </s>
<s> it would also help if u mention the make of the new psu. </s>
<s> If this is a dell from '96 to 2000 they used a different power supply and mobo and if they were not hooked up just right, they got fried. </s>
<s> I hope this didnt happen to you. </s>
<s> They werent interchangeable with industry standard stuff. </s>
<s> FINALLY started using the standard ATX wiring. </s>
<s> At least I hope so for the sake of this gentleman. </s>
<s> He has to check with Dell. </s>
<s> The reverse could also have happened if he bought a supply for an older Dell model, that is not wired to the ATX standard. </s>
<s> A standard ATX connected to the older Dell's definitely zapped the mobo. </s>
<s> Thanks guys - ill check the connectinos and whatnot. </s>
<s> One thing though - the light on the motherboard turns on when power is going to it... </s>
<s> Does that mean it is not fried? </s>
