many oem's that provide thier &quot;bundled s/w&quot; already have made prior agreements or deals to get that s/w either as a trial or basic service for the system in order to have as an offering at certain $$$ value.
you of course have the option of either using and becoming an end user, thus pay or buy the s/w and/or service and thus continue it use.
otherwise, you can de-install as well and just be rid of it.
this is all an effort to get you to spend more but again the effort is lost if not ever there.
but again, you may like what you have and continue its use.
all-in-all most can be de-installed and be done with it.
however, most users pretty much find that out within the 1st yr. of operation or less if any is kept.
if you used your system for 3-4 yrs.
and now find it sluggist you may have other issues/problems, but again you need to review what you want to keep in the old s/w or services.
then, do the typical housekeeping of the system wares and see what needs to be cleaned out and there you have to make decisions on what does this in s/w.
like registry cleaners, past old/new pgms.
never used, defrag, and pssibility your old data that can be saved offline like to cds or ext.
hds.
to lessen their storage needs.
on top of all this using av pgms.
malware checkers.
plus active firewall, etc.
makes sense now ever done just to verify none is present.
in this regard all pgms.
used must be updated for best eff4ect.
if all of this doesn't seem to make things better and yes sometimes restarting from scratch makes sense.
you get to reload from a clean starting point redo the above suggestions and get a better handle on things from the git.
