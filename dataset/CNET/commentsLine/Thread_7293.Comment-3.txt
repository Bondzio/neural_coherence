did you read anywhere in the manual that came with the monitors about setting them up to use a vga signal?
are you using an adapter to go from the dvi connector to a vga connector?
have you adjusted the properties in the video card to a resolution and refresh rate that the lcd monitor will support prior to hooking it up?
a little more info might be helpful as i'm just suggesting general ideas.
