i have a model 5100a hp photosmart scanner which worked fine until i got a new computer.
now the scsi card that came w/the scanner won't fit this machine.
i have looked quite a few places on the net plue my own computer person - no luck.
hp wants to sell me the complete kit for $80.00 - i said no.
here's what i need: scsi pci 50 pin card - it goes inside the computer & attaches to the motherboard - which in my case is on the side of the computer tower not the bottom.
someone suggested i get a used hp photosmart scanner which is usb compatible - that would be truly easier however i do not have money to buy another scanner (this one does my slides & negs & up to 5x7 prints - is not a flatbed scanner).
i really need this scanner - have lost business because i cannot deliver scans for comp images.
i expect to pay between $15.
to $25.00 for this card (probably) if it can be found.
thanks to anyone who can help!
