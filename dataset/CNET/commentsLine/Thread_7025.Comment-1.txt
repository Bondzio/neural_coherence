my current desktop is old, slow and failing.
i need to buy a new one soon, but i can't afford a high-end system.
i would like to be able to connect a stereo to my new desktop to transfer old vinyl and cassettes to cd.
i would also like to transfer digital video from my computer to a vcr.
it seems everything i can afford has integrated audio and most have integrated video also.
if i buy such a system, can audio and video cards be bought and inserted later?
(i'm particularly interested in the audio in/out.)
