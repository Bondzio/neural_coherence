your hard drive will probably slow down to match the dma (or even worse, pio) level of the optical drive.
and reading/writing from/to both simultaneously will be even slower than normal.
suggest you convert your hd to sata (  ) or get a pci ide controller for your optical drive (  ).
both are less than $10.
