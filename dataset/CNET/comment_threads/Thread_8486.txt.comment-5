Downloaded the Nforce 5.10 update from Asus site.
Seemed to only update the audio drivers.
Saw on another site that this update would &quot;update&quot; the whole mobo.
Not sure what the video card has to do with it.
The network worked ok before this problem started and the video card has not changed.
