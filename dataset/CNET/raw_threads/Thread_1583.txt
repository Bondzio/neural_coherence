Can I just use device manager to turn off device?

Decided to pull card and return computer to original status. everything is as before and no added graphics card.Should I go into device manager and remove onboard graphics or will I make matters worse?

But leave the moniter attached to the onboard graphics. Boot windows, then go to the display properties, then to the settings tab there will be two graphic cards listed. Highlight the one you want to use and then check the Use this device as my primary display check box. That should solve your problem. You dont even need to disable the old graphics card, although you can but it wont hurt anything.

I switched monitor cable to the new card and monitor came back on.The new card now appears in device manager window and everything appears to be working. Thanks to everyone who contributed to this question.

Step 1 Go to your start button and left click on my computer and select properties http://www.electronixeshop.com/HelpArchive/OnboardVidcard/Step1.JPG Step 2 When a window pops up showing you your comp info select the Hardware Tab http://www.electronixeshop.com/HelpArchive/OnboardVidcard/Step2.JPG step 3 select device manager http://www.electronixeshop.com/HelpArchive/OnboardVidcard/Step3.JPG Step 4 click the drop down icon beside Display Adapter.select the integrated one and left click on the onboard card and select properties http://www.electronixeshop.com/HelpArchive/OnboardVidcard/Step4.JPG step 5 the vid card shown in my picture is not a integrated card(VGA) Its my new card i installed only reason i cant show you my integrated one is because it dosent show in device manager once disabled. http://www.electronixeshop.com/HelpArchive/OnboardVidcard/Step5.JPG Step 6 once disabled it will ask you to restart your computer click yes it is a must that you restart your computer. as it is getting ready to shutdown or startup dosent matter. plug your monitor into the new card you jsut installed.

Sorry guys, don't mean to rain on anyones parade but anytime I have installed a new graphics card in a machine it is automatically set as default. The onboard graphics automatically switches off and the computer boots fine with a low resolution until the new graphics drivers are installed. I have never seen the need to disable the onboard graphics and I have never seen a conflict occur. Is there something about this particular motherboard that I don't know about?

In this particular set-up,The onboard graphics cards had to be switched in the BIOS section.The asus board has 3 options for the card.pci-slot,agp-slot, or onboard graphics.Also since the agp slot was selected, the speed and memory of card had to be adjusted in the Computer Bios.Apparently each system has it's own quirks and sometimes to a beginner,the error's can be overwhelming.It's nice to know, the people who responsded to this string were thoughtful and sincere in their response. Thanks

Later on, I wanted a better video setup, so I got myself an ATI card for a PCI slot (not having an AGP slot) and figured out after a bit of swearing that I had to go into the BIOS and defeat the on-board graphics before things would work correctly. However, even after succeeding at that, I would occasionally have graphics problems and once or twice actually had to pull the ATI board and reset everything. You would think at this point in the Wintel universe that you could leave the onboard graphics alive alongside a PCI video card and run a dual monitor setup, if you wanted, but there must be serious contention where the graphic routines are embedded. Also, where the motherboard carries the graphics subset built in, the usual setup is that the onboard video will draw from main system RAM for video RAM, bringing down your overall available total (a standalone card, obviously, carries its own RAM, and usually can handle a lot more of it).
