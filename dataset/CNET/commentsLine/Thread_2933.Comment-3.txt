i think i have an energy star bios because whenever the information screen pops up, you can see the logo, but it stays there for less then a second, so i can't read the rest of it.
the problem is i can't get into the bios.
it says press &lt;f1&gt; for setup, and it won't let me in.
i have tried other common buttons (delete, esc) and they don't work.
i am reall concerned that somthing may be wrong, and if that's the case, i'm kind of screwed.
