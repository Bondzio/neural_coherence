1.1.1	Hello Team , I 'm running Windows XP Pro SP3 .	St
1.1.2	I 'm using an Acer 5738Z and I use the Atheros AR5B91 wireless network adapter .	St
1.1.3	In the Network Connections window , Wireless Network Connection shows a red X and says Not Connected .	St
1.1.4	In the device manager , the Atheros driver is listed under Network Adapters .	St
1.1.5	Also , in the Atheros Client Utility , I can see the available wireless network to connect .	St
1.1.6	But , when I connect , its not connecting .	St
1.1.7	I believe its because the Wireless Network Connection has a red X and its not connected .	St
1.1.8	I tried reinstalling the Atheros drivers .	St
1.1.9	Turned off the firewall , etc .	St
1.1.10	to no luck .	Polite
1.1.11	Also stopped and started the Wireless Zero Configuration in the services .	St
1.1.12	I 've tried all possible steps from my side .	St
1.1.13	Just not sure what to do to get the Wireless Network Connection to get connected , so that I can use my wireless .	St
1.1.14	It was working absolutely fine around a couple of months back .	St
1.1.15	Did not make any major changes in my pc since then .	St
1.1.16	I 'm struggling with this for the past many weeks .	St
1.1.17	Please help me out .	Sug
1.1.18	Expecting to get a reply very soon .	St
1.1.19	Regards , Reeza	St
1.2.1	From what I can tell this machine never shipped with XP .	St
1.2.2	Your post seems to hint that it never worked with XP so my advice is to install the OS that the machine came with so it can work .	St
1.2.3	Or use some USB WIFI device .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yes , that 's right .	St
1.3.2	The machine did not come with Win XP when I bought it .	St
1.3.3	I believe , it came with some Linux OS .	St
1.3.4	I reinstalled the Win XP Pro in the comp .	St
1.3.5	I can see the sticker on the bottom of the laptop , saying that it contains Atheros card .	St
1.3.6	Also , I was able to use the wireless with Atheros , till around 2 months back .	St
1.3.7	I 'm sure that the wireless would work if the red X is removed from the Wireless Network Connections in the Network Connections window , but I dont know what and where to check , to get it connected .	St
1.3.8	Apprecaite your assistance .	St
1.3.9	Regards ,	St
1.4.1	If Device Manager shows nothing wrong , and it does n't connect , consider the possibility it 's broken .	St
1.4.2	The easiest way I see to check that and possibly get it working are : 1 .	St
1.4.3	Back to Linux .	St
1.4.4	See if it works .	St
1.4.5	2 .	St
1.4.6	If it works in Linux , repeat the installation of Windows XP exactly as you did it the first time .	St
1.4.7	Then it should work like it did the first time .	St
1.4.8	That 's rather time-consuming .	St
1.4.9	Adding a new ( USB or Ethernet ) wireless device is far easier .	St
1.4.10	Kees	St
1.5.1	To be honest , I 'm not willing to install Linux just to check the functionality of the wireless as it has worked earlier with WinXp Pro .	St
1.5.2	Any other suggestions please ?	Ques
1.6.1	& quot ; Adding a new ( USB or Ethernet ) wireless device is far easier. & quot ; That 's what I 've been doing a lot .	St
1.6.2	Folk wo n't pay for the hours of troubleshooting Windows or even Linux and will pay the 20 bucks or less for the USB wifi that works in a few minutes .	St
