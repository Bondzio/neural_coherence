a quote from your last post as a reminder and if you want to truly give the forum the kindness you say you have, all you need to do is share how you are solving it.
i see 3 options here bob: 1: you are schizophrenic 2: you are trying to be annoying & difficult 3: you just do not read things posted in this forum.
i started this stupid thread by posting the fix from the very start!!!
you scoffed at it and pointed me to a useless link saying this was well covered i disputed you and you called me don quixote.
you have refused to acknowledge a proper resolution that i provided to this forum , even though the symptoms make perfect sense.
any professional worth their weight in salt should remember that a large percentage of older systems could never properly manage waking from hibernation & sleep without causing a barrage of strange problems.
it should always be the first option to disable before crippling other system settings & devices.
i posted here because i saw people struggling with something so simple and attempted to save someone aggravation and instead i have spent more time exchanging non pleasantries with you than i did fixing my clients pc and posting what i found to be the fix.
a fix that is mentioned nowhere on any forum!
whatever!
im so done with this ridiculous nonsense & this thread.
if someone needs help with this they can email me i will help them.
if they feel like it they can post here and report back to you.
i kindly posted the fix for you in my first 2 posts.
while it may not fix every usb surge problem, it is the fix for a sony viao pcv-rs310 aka pcv-2222 that was fine prior to factory restore and no has usb devices attached when the message appears.
