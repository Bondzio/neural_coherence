you know, when i started repairing computers not he early 90s, there was no internet, so no forums... how did i manage?
guys like you make my life liveable!
and of course, as you realise, i didn't do a search.
at least i don't think i did it was late at night here in england.
but i think i assumed this was a one-off... thanks again will get the hot poker out tonight!
