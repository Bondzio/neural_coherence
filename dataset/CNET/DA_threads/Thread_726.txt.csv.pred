1.1.1	When I attempted to install the second geforce 8800 gts card into my system , I was greeted with a high pitched squeeling noise the moment I turned on the power .	St
1.1.2	I tried it twice more , once after flipping the sli bridge around and then again with no sli bridge connection .	St
1.1.3	I ensured the card was properly seated .	St
1.1.4	All had the same high-pitched noise .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas ?	Ques

1.2.1	Overheating , you need BIOS update , or you 're overclocking .	St
1.3.1	Either you forgot the power connections to the cards ( can be 2 on each ) or that extra 100 Watt video card you added pushed the power supply over the edge .	St
1.3.2	Let 's say you need 650 Watts or more on your power supply rating .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the quick responses guys .	St
1.4.2	Yup , I was just a tired moron last night and didnt plug in the power for the second card , d'oH ! .	St
1.4.3	However , while the second card is hooked up and working , with sli-enabled in the nvidia control panel , I have a bit of a snag .	St
1.4.4	Under graphics settings in GTA iv , my & quot ; resources available & quot ; is exactly the same and I see minimal graphic improvement .	St
1.4.5	I have found changing the view distance from 1 to 70 ( max amt it will let me push it ) there is very little difference in viewing distance or graphics improvement .	St
1.4.6	The only difference is when its maxed out my camera movements are a little jagged .	St
1.4.7	Otherwise the game runs pretty much the same as on one card ( it fairly good to start out with , i suppose ) .	St
1.4.8	Any thoughts by anybody ?	Ques
1.4.9	Thanks for your time -Hendrik	St
