<s> I have 3 ram slots, I have one 1gb stick of ddr ram and two sticks of 512mb ddr ram, my computer works when i put the 1gb stick and one 512mb stick in, it says i have 1.50gb. </s>
<s> but when i try to add the last stick of 512mb my computer does not boot up. </s>
<s> I installed a program called sisoft to check out my motherboard to see the max amount of ram that can be installed and it says 2gb, I also have tried adding one 256mb of ddr along with the 1gb stick and one 512..but still will not boot up. </s>
<s> The motherboard i have is the &quot;ASUSTeK P4PE&quot; I am sure every stick i have works, i have tried each one individualy. </s>
<s> The 1gb stick is dobule sided DIMM. </s>
<s> One of the 512 sticks is also double sided DIMM. </s>
<s> The last 512 stick is single sided DIMM. </s>
<s> But the computer boots with either of the 512mb sticks along with the 1gb stick. </s>
<s> does anyone know whats wrong? </s>
<s> =( </s>
<s> One of the 512 sticks is also double sided DIMM. </s>
<s> The last 512 stick is single sided DIMM. </s>
<s> I think these need to be an identical pair to work &quot;together&quot; </s>
<s> While you mention the MB size of the memory, its important to know what class&type the memory is. </s>
<s> If they differ too much of amongest the total of the ram installed you have computability problems not to include the system itself. </s>
<s> In the system, the bios must be at its latest level as it *may* correct or help in this regard. </s>
<s> The RAS and CAS rating of the ram are part of its make-up so if they differ, expect problems. </s>
<s> One way I look into the make-up of a ram module is to use Everest Home Edition, gotten from some download file service, like www.download,com or www.majorgeeks.com or similar websites. </s>
<s> Once installed and used, find the differences of ram installed and proceed from that. </s>
<s> It usually makes sense to have very similar memory installed, besides Mb sizes. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Therein lies the answer. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I believe this has been answered for you...but I am no expert. </s>
<s> what you have is mis matched. </s>
<s> either all 2 sided or all 1 sided... it's a conflict. </s>
<s> you can only install 3 single sided ram,if you install a double sided in slot 2 you must leave slot 3 empty as slots 2 & 3 'share the same rows'.so you can have either single or double sided in slot 1 with either 2 single sided in the remaining 2 slots OR 1 double sided in slot 2 with slot 3 remaining empty. </s>
<s> What you have is a timing problem. </s>
<s> It is likely that you have a newer stick that is too fast for the slower 512mb stick. </s>
<s> Without seeing the specs on each stick it is hard to say exactly which one has an issue, but it sounds like the newer one is causing the timing problem. </s>
<s> Count of the chips on the stick should not matter. </s>
<s> Look each stick of memory online to see the specs and that should help you determine what is the conflict. </s>
<s> Your motherboard only supports memory with speeds up to 333mhz. </s>
<s> Now, if each of the sticks works individually, then that is the test to see if each is at or below this limit. </s>
<s> Memory Matching: It is not advisable to install memory of different speed/type/size in any one machine, much less paired slots. </s>
<s> When I advise freinds (or build systems for them) I always make them buy new RAM. </s>
<s> Why recyle those old POS sticks? </s>
<s> To save $20? </s>
<s> A 1gb stick of value priced RAM can be purchased for less than $60. </s>
<s> 2x2gb for less than $160. </s>
<s> There is no excuse for cheap RAM. </s>
<s> Or maybe your MOBO's fried/bad socket. </s>
<s> I had the same experience when replacing a 128MB RAM in slot 2 of an Intel 810 Chipset with a 256MB RAM in the same slot 2. </s>
<s> PC would not boot with 256MB chipset. </s>
<s> Removed 256MB chipset and PC did boot with the existing 256MB chipset in slot 1, slot 2 empty. </s>
<s> PC also would not boot when I inserted the original 128MB RAM in slot 2. </s>
<s> PC manufacturer said my PC would only hold 256MB RAM. </s>
<s> Intel website said capacity was 512MB in two slots. </s>
<s> Intel website suggested upgrading BIOS. </s>
<s> Since Intel no longer supported the 810 Chipset I had to go to a second party provider for $40. </s>
<s> Upgraded BIOS allowed the PC to boot with 512MB RAM. </s>
<s> A side benefit was improved performance from the PC with the new BIOS. </s>
<s> About six months later I reinstalled Windows XP which deleted everything from the hard drive to clean up the computer. </s>
<s> Low and behold the PC booted with 512 MB RAM without the new BIOS. </s>
<s> Apparently when I had the original problen adding RAM something happened so that the slot 2 RAM was causing a conflict. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>
