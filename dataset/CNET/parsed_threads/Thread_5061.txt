<s> So I just got a motherboard to work with, and I need some help with its graphics. </s>
<s> It is a Socket 775 Motherboard, with a Pentium D, 3.4 GHz. </s>
<s> First of all, its a 24-pin power supply slot in the motherboard, but I only have a 20-pin power supply connected. </s>
<s> I've read that that shouldn't be a problem as long as I don't use any PCI cards, thus I haven't used any. </s>
<s> However... Everything is hooked up as it should be, and it powers on and everything, but my monitor remains in standby mode. </s>
<s> I tried to turn it off, and turn it back on, and that didn't work. </s>
<s> I have no clue why the integrated graphics aren't working. </s>
<s> Does anyone else know? </s>
<s> So after this all happened, I put in a graphics card. </s>
<s> However, the graphics slot is PCIe x16, and the only card that I have that will fit is a dual-DVI-E. No problem, I just bought a DVI to VGA converter. </s>
<s> So I put that in, plug it all in, and it still doesn't work! </s>
<s> This is driving me crazy, and I need to come up with a solution quick because this is my dads main computer. </s>
<s> It's a shame the make and model of the video card was not supplied. </s>
<s> Some will never drive a VGA display. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My bad. </s>
<s> I tried it with a Radeon HD2600Pro, 256MB DDR3. </s>
<s> If that won't drive a VGA display, thats fine, but I still am wondering about how to get the integrated graphics to work. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> There are too many cards that fit your description but DVI does not mean and adapter will work. </s>
<s> Try a DVI or HDMI display next. </s>
<s> For me to check further, I'll need MAKE and MODEL NUMBER on that &quot;Radeon HD2600Pro, 256MB DDR3&quot;. </s>
<s> I found the problem - two of my RAM sticks were ECC, and I didn't know it. </s>
<s> As far as the adapter goes, I'm happy to believe that the graphics card couldn't support VGA. </s>
<s> Thanks all! </s>
