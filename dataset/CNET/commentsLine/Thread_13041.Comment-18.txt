update: im pretty sure i have all the dependencies started, i read somewhere that ndsuio and nativewifi filter needed to be on as well, well they arent listed under services but i went into registry editor and made sure the values for these two services were set to 2 which means started.. i restarted and tried to start the wlan autoconfig but still wouldnt work.. im running out of ideas
