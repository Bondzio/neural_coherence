i just installed a 160 gb and w2k new install, the partitions in fat32 and large hd support.
after i set up all my progs i wonted to create an image of the hd.
when drive image restarted the computer, something stopped it from booting.
it was like the hd was missing, or had no os installed, or the boot log was gone.
i look up the wd and ms help and no one could help.
so i reinstalled the w2k and all the programs form the beginning again, and after i installed the norton a/v and reboot, the same thing happened all over again.
here my fault because i left the nav cd in the drive and i gat the choice menu (boot from hd, or from cd) at 1 second to boot the computer stopped responding???????
what is going on?
any one observed this before?
my computer is an old pii 350 mhz with 384mb ram.
then i switched the 160 gb hd to slave position and used my other hd, i was trying to replace, in master position and the machine boot as usual and i can see and access all the directories on the 160 gb hd.
