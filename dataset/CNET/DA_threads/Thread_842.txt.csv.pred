1.3.1	Hello Ibrahim, Thank you for the advice.	St

1.3.4	Just I sent a mail to Realtek to get some help.	St
1.3.5	I do not know now whether it is a hardware problem or driver problem.	St

1.4.3	~Ibrahim~	St
1.5.1	I did system restore but it did not help.	St
1.5.2	I reinstalled the OS and all the softwares last week since then I have this problem.	St
1.6.1	Do you know what model your motherboard is, by any chance?	St
1.6.2	You can use this program to find out: http://www.cpuid.com/download/cpu-z-140.zip I'm going out on a limb here, but you don't have radios, cell phones, microwaves, etc.?	St
1.6.3	Try moving the speakers as far as you can from the computer and the monitor.	St
1.6.4	Any better?	St
1.6.5	~Ibrahim~	St
1.7.1	The sound problem has been solved.	St
1.7.2	The computer's motherboard GA-K8NF-9 nForce4-4X chipset's manual audio driver is Realtek so I have installed.	St
1.7.3	VDO card is GeForce 660GT 128MB Memory.	St
1.7.4	I got two CDs the NVIDIA n Force4 series Utility CD and the WinFast 3D Graphics Series.	St
1.7.5	Last night I installed AGP Update+nVidia+nForce+nForce AMD since then Realtek AC97 has been replaced by NVIDIA(R) nForce (TM) Audio Codec Interface and then the problem has gone.	St
1.7.6	As well as i lost the &quot;Sound Effect&quot; so I do not have feature for Jack-Sensing for audio connectors error-detecting function.	St
1.7.7	The sound is pretty good and satisfactory but I do not know which driver is the right driver of the hardware of the machine, Realtk or Nvidia.	St
1.7.8	Regards, Wildbird	St
1.8.1	Well, I'm glad it is solved.	St
1.8.2	I actually didn't know nVidia made sound drivers, weird!	St
1.8.3	I'm pretty certain Realtek drivers are the correct ones, but if they are working OK with nVidia, I wouldn't mess with them.	St
1.8.4	Good job!	St
1.8.5	~Ibrahim~	St
