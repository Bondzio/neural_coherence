<s> I'm trying to print business cards from a card stock that's 80 lbs 216 g/m2 or 28.76M weight from Oki data C5500n and got jammed. </s>
<s> Is there any color laser printer that you would recommend to print this type of card stock paper without jamming? </s>
<s> Xerox Phaser 7700/DX Color Laser Printer 22 ... </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Is there anything lower in the budget area? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Select a printer that provides a &quot;straight-through&quot; paper feed path. </s>
<s> In other words, one that doesn't need to bend the paper in order to print and eject the finished output. </s>
<s> This allows for less pinch&grab roller action and reduces jams, stuck, etc. </s>
<s> in t he printer. </s>
<s> Regardless if capable of handling 80lb. </s>
<s> paper, it just makes for less hassle. </s>
<s> While Robert provided a printer to think about, you responded in cost consensus way, remember, &quot;cheap is cheap&quot; and in printing the results are easily acknowledged as such. </s>
<s> So spend what needs to be spent or respend again to replace. </s>
<s> Since 80lb. </s>
<s> is serious paper stock, that usually delves into serious printers that have always costed more. </s>
<s> You may want into Canon and Mintola(sp)models as well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> A print shop I know in Vancouver, BC never paid for such printers. </s>
<s> These were those monsters you know are in the 5 figure range so rather than bet the business on that they rented or leased them. </s>
<s> That also cured issues of repair since the lease included maintenance calls and more. </s>
<s> -&gt; What this also did was make sure the printing income paid the costs of these printers. </s>
<s> If the market or sales didn't support such a printer they could end the lease. </s>

<s> Okidata C5500n finally works with 80 lbs cover. </s>
<s> Do you have any idea where they rented their equipment from. </s>
<s> This sounds like a good option, I'm just not sure where to find a rental company. </s>
<s> Xerox.com and such and use the phone. </s>
<s> Ask them directly what you are looking for. </s>
