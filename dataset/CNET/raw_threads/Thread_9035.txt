System: Dual monitors (before, 2 CRT, now 1 LCD, 1 CRT) Windows XP Before I took my PC to shop, system monitors were going to sleep 10 minutes after boot up. At shop, both screens working without going to sleep. When I brought back home, unpacked new LCD monitor, cabled both monitors to machine, booted up, both went to sleep at first within a few minutes, now they're both going to sleep at boot up. Graphics card was replaced, so this is not the problem. Please help, this is my business and I am losing money.

Since you don't see the BIOS, Windows booting or even a beep (not noted in your post) the machine has likely failed. Nothing in your post tells me that its not the machine. Bob
