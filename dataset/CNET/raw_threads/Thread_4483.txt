All I've done is ran partition magic and created a small partition in addition to the main partition. Basically, when i boot up, it tries the floppy, the cd, then the HD, and when it tries the HD it just stops....a failure message. so...I've formatted it via a usb link to my other computer and put it back in my desktop. Same problem! so...I ran the xp disk on the newly formatted HD, and it does what it needs to do, then restarts --&gt; at this point it would usually boot to XP branded software to setup windows bits and pieces...instead it just runs the CD again, and goes through the process of installing windows! So, as far as i can see, it boots from the CD to load winxp, then restarts, then boots from CD again, missing the HD. I've tried another cable, with no luck, and check jumpers etc.... ANY IDEAS? PLEASE HELP!

For some reason Partition Magic still has control of the Master Boot Record . This utility will write 1 & o's to the HDD destroying all information on the drive. Luck Bill
