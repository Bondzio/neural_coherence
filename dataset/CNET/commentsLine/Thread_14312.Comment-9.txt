well i finally took the plunged and aquired last night the samsung i had mentioned.
wow!!!
talk about an improvement.
i'm still tweaking the settings but already i am impressed.
after much research my fears about how older games would look like had abated a bit.
i loaded up master of orion 2 and found out that i could play with native resolution by &quot;changing&quot; it to what was required for me to play (640x480 for this game).
i'm not sure if that is standard but my video card allowed me this.
it looks a tad bit soft but its nothing major.
came with a dvi corde so i was all set.
yay!!
!
