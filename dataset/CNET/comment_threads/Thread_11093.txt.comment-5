With ASUS cards I've seen, you just tap the escape key beginning right after power is applied.
But, if it just beeps immediately, you won't get that far.
If you can enter the BIOS, you need to look for the the option regarding on board devices.
I can't tell you exactly where they are.
If it is the video chip, these have sometimes been known to have solder connections go bad.
There isn't much you can do about that unless you can find the bad connections (need magnification) and are very good with your soldering skills.
If it is the video chipset, you can just get an add in video card.
Bad RAM or the CPU can cause beep codes but you'd need a listing of those for your BIOS to narrow down the probable causes.
Good luck.
