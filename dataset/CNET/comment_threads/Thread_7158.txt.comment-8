under USB devices somewhere not have it default to auto with each restart.
I've forgotten the process but I had to halt during POST and go USB device setting and restart until the drives appeared by model #.
I exited and saved the settings.
I also can allow more time for USB devices to present themselves.
I had to add a few seconds for one of my drives that was a bit slow to spin up.
You might see what options you have in your BIOS to remedy this.
