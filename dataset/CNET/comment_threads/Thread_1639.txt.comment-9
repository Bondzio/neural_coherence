Today we have more choices and each has speeds matching the connections but we have USB , Firewire, Ethernet, Wifi and what else?
Since even a simple server could autosync these I'll share I tried that and now have settled to a netbook as a server.
I tried various computers over the years but most would draw 100+ Watts.
Today I have a simple netbook and it runs under 10 Watts after the screen goes out.
How do I know?
I put it on a Watt meter.
So here's my home grown solution.
A netbook with a big for today 1.5TB USB hard drive over wifi and in a remote place of the house then syncback to that from the work machine.
