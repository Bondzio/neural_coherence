thanks, yes to recent install, yes to new os, 95 to 98se.
i have tried reinstalling win98 with a boot disk and got no drives found when it wanted cdrom support.
i attempted to load drivers, screwed up config.sys, had to go back into dos to change back to previous config.bak not a skilled worker here.
