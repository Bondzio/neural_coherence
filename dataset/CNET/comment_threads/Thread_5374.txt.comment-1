I built a tricked out machine running the Pentium Dual Core Extreme Edition and SLi 6800 ulta's.
Sounded great at first, but my system runs extremly hot.
I have an aftermarket 120mm fan and huge heat sink for the cpu and the case is filled to the brim with fans, yet I still have to under clock my system to get it to boot.
Any suggestions other than liquid cooling?
I have limited space (dorm) and would like to avoid resorting to refitting everything with a liquid system as I would like to easily move this system.
I read about refrigerated case a few years back in Wired magazine, anything like that still exist?
Any suggestions would be appriciated!
Thanks!
