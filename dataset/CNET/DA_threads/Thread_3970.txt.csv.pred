1.3.1	If you have an Nvidia card running Forceware drivers , you may be able to unlock an integrated OC called Coolbits .	St
1.3.2	I have a 5700LE OC'ed to over 100MHz from stock core and mem on stock cooling .	St
1.3.3	To unlock Coolbits : 1 .	St
1.3.4	Open the Start\Run dialog box , and type Regedit and hit OK 2.Browse to : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NVIDIACorporation\Global\NvTweak\ 3.Then right click and go to New and choose DWORD Value 4 .	St

1.4.1	Buy a graphics card that you know has locked pipelines .	St
1.4.2	Then with riva tuner or some other program from guru3d.com you can unlock it and proceed to OC'ing	St
1.5.1	How can I tell if a video card has locked pipelines ?	Ques
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	Research your GPU .	St
1.7.2	Search enthusiast sites and forums ( anandtech.com , hothardware.com , guru3d.com , beyond3d.com , etc . )	St
1.7.3	since they 'll be the ones with the info .	St
1.7.4	Locked pipes are sometimes present in 'baby-brothers ' ( next-to-the-top-of-the-line products ) and product line 'refreshes ' since they often use scaled back versions of the same GPUs .	St
1.7.5	For example , the X1800GTO ( product line refresh ) has locked pipes but it 's the same GPU as an X1800XT .	St
1.7.6	Unlocking those pipes effetively turns a cheaper video card into its bigger brother .	St
1.7.7	Pipes are unlocked with a 'soft-mod ' that usually consists of flashing your card 's bios with either a bios from another card or a hacked bios .	St
1.7.8	A bad flash/bios can sometimes render a card useless , so watch the hardware sites and let others burn their fingers and figure out how to do it right before you jump into soft modding .	St
