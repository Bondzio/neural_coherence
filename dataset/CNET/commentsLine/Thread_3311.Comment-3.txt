skip: i read your reply to a post concerning questions asked about which parts to buy and use to custom build a new pc.
i'm contemplating such now myself but have no idea as to which brands of parts are best to use in a custom built pc configuration done by a computer repair shop/custom builder.
does this website or to your knowledge any other website offer a list of parts that should be included when someone is considering having a new pc custom built by a computer shop rather than built by one of the big guys; dell; hp; gateway; and others?
if such a sight does exist would it also list name brands of parts to consider for a good custom built pc?
i've been to new egg.com which seems to list all of such but i know absolutely nothing about what i need to buy.
it's like my experience with radioshack; radioshack carries tons of products but you better know what you need when you go in there because if you don't; you'll be at a total loss because most of their store's employees also don't have a clue as to what they're selling.
if you can help me out; i would appreciate it.
