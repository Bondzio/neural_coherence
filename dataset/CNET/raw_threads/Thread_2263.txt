What hardware are you running, what computer motherboard, processors, how does the external drive connect? When it doesn't come up what happens, where does it stop? IF you plug the drive in while it is running does it work?

Motherboard make/model, if the BIOS is current in such and whether you updated the motherboard driver package.

You may want to either become more familiar with what you have or just make this a warranty issue with the machine's supplier. Bob
