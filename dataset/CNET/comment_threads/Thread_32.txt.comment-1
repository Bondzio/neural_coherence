I just built my first computer and was checking the CPU temp through the bios and it was at 49 to 50C with no load.
Is this too high?
I'm not sure what determines just what the CPU temperature should be, but my components are: MOB: DFI LANPARTY UT nF3 250GB CPU: AMD athlon 64 3200+ Newcastle (Socket 754) HD: WD 160Gb serial ATA 150 7200rpm Video Card: ATI Radeon X700 PRO AGP 256mb Mem: OCZ Ultra High performance Dual Channel Kit 1Gig 3200 (2 x 512mb) Monitor: Viewsonic VA1912b OS: Windows XP Pro Optical Drives: Lite-On DVD and Plextor DVD burner Power: Antec True power 480W Thanks
