Use only the PS/2 type mouse and kybd. connection(use real PS/2 mouse & kybd., no adapters). Now find the bios/CMOS clearing pins on the mtrbd. and use them to reset the bios to defaults. Now, try to boot or use the immediate clearing pins(momentarily) at that time and hope it boots. If the you hear the beep code again, jot them down. Now, find the beep code and what those mean for your type of bios. Proceed on that info, get back to us for any further action. tada -----Willy

Thanks for the help....this is a learning experience for me as i'm doin A+ i can use this as an example for the future, that is why i would like to solve the problem...

Reset the system by doing the following: unplug the power cord , pressing the button over 20seconds to discharge the mainboard and connect the power cord again. Power on the PC and see if your PC boots with the CPU, RAM, HDD, VGA and KB/mouse only. Hope this helps. Bill

Please verify the proper PS/2 is just that using the one for mouse and kybd. correctly(review manual). Now, if the problem persists, then yes, swap it out with a replacement since this is so new. Since, you need to remove anyways, tear it down and inspect it, sometimes a cold solder joint at the PS/2 connections and/or possible grounding/short there. Since, this is so new and you tried a &quot;minimum system right, install only the basic essentials, you need no drives, just see if it gets anywhere and proceed to the next level. Again, if it persists problem wise, return. tada -----Willy :

If you remove and reinstall the boards etc.the computer may not set up the driver for the USB ports so it won't boot from a usb port. You might try holding the Ctrl key down while the machine is booting after performing the previous suggestion. You should see a selection like NORMAL or SAFEMode or 2 or 3 other selections to boot up with.Safe mode will allow the computer to boot up with just the basic OS. It would be easy if you had an A drive and a windows stsrt up or boot disk If you remove and reinstall all the boards and the HD oper sys is inop, then you will need a bootable CD to boot up . Like Norton Utilities. Any year 2001-07. Borrow one! The computer should boot and the screen should show C: or something. What ever your cd drive is.At the prompt Type C:space)dir/p and then you should be able to see and run chkdsk on the hd. The dir will show everything on the boot drive (cd drive) that you can run. Also you should be able to run fdisk or format to reinstall the OS if that is bad. There is more /other things that can be done but this should work if the OS is ok. Good Luck
