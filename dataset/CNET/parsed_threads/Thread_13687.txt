<s> I was ready to buy a 22 inch LG LCD monitor that doubles as a television. </s>
<s> It is 1080p ready and has analog and digital TV tuner. </s>
<s> I thought it was great when one of my collegues proposed to sell me his 36-37 inch LG TV second hand at a very good price. </s>
<s> Will this be an acceptable/good computer monitor? </s>
<s> I have a HP 2510p notebook which I plan to hook it up to, will it work with it? </s>
<s> Will it be any different with a regular LCD monitor? </s>
<s> Will it have a glare problem if I do reading with it? </s>
<s> Is it ok to buy a 1-1.5 year old LCD tv at half present market price? </s>
<s> Would it be outdated in a general sense? </s>
<s> Any tips to make it work at its best whether monitor or tv? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> if it's a 720p tv (most likely) set the resolution for either 1366x768 or 1280x720. </s>
<s> if it's a 1080p tv, then set it for 1920x1080. </s>
<s> as for glare, that depends on where you'll be using it and how it's positioned. </s>
<s> you should place a tv that size at least 3 ft from your eyes (much further than a 22&quot;) or you may cause eyestrain and have to move your neck/head too much to see the full image. </s>
<s> If your colleague's TV has matching inputs, it'll work fine. </s>
<s> Use the VGA out on your laptop + a standard VGA (dsub) cable. </s>
<s> A heads-up: resolution on TVs is lower than computer monitors, in the sense of pixel size. </s>
<s> Which is just fine because we usually sit next to our computers, but view TV from a distance. </s>
<s> So it's not any different than a regular LCD monitor, but it is what it is. </s>
<s> 1080 lines is great for TV, not going to be crystal sharp up close as a computer monitor at that scale. </s>
<s> For a business/mobile style laptop, even a 19&quot; monitor will feel like a nice big screen when working at a desk, so I'm confident you'd like the 22&quot; LG, too. </s>
<s> But hey, bigger is better, eh. </s>
