if you slave your xp harddrive to his, w98se won't be able to see anything on it unless somebody created that xp drive to be fat32 instead of ntfs.
but, if it is fat32, then w98se will be able to see the xp drive and you will be able to access stuff on that drive.
you cannot pop that xp drive in as master in order to hook the w98se drive as the slave because of the activation issue.....xp will know immediately that none of the originally installed hardware matches up with what's in that other computer and won't boot up.
you will have to then reinstall xp, and probably have to call ms to get it reactivated....and this is just a temporary solution since you plan to get your other system fixed that got dropped and you would have to go through the reactivation process all over again.
i would suggest instead that you wait until your computer is fixed.....and then if the motherboard or cpu had to be replaced, you would only have to reactivate xp once since xp will see the computer as a brand new system.
if only a couple of things like video or soundcard has to be replaced during the fix, you wouldn't have to reactivate at all.
