There I am enjoying myself playing a game and then the monitor suddenly goes back to the desktop. It happens with all the games I've been playing and it happens every 10 mins or so. Ran a virus scanner but it's still happening. The monitor is a Videoseven 17&quot; tft panel and the graphics card is a 9600 pro. Cheers
