<s> I think my cd/dvd rom drive is the problem. </s>
<s> whenever i play dvd's it will play for a bit and the kind of freeze up where it comes to a complete stop and appears the same way as if i had put it on pause. </s>
<s> but it isn't. </s>
<s> i know its not the dvds because they work in a normal dvd player and it happens with any dvd's ive been putting in my computer. </s>
<s> However i have had no problem with cd roms or audio disks at all. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how to fix this problem? </s>
<s> or if it is a problem with my computer and not actually the drive itself? </s>
<s> Did you supply enough information? </s>
<s> Try installing the latest version of the DVD player on your computer. </s>
<s> Try other players if possible like VLC media player ( www.videolan.org/vlc/ ). </s>
<s> If it does not help , try swaping your DVD drive. </s>
<s> I think it is your DVD drive which causing the problem. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>
