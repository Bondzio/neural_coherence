1.3.4	the only clue i have for you guys is that without installing video card drivers everything is just fine .	St
1.4.1	I wonder if you forgot some BIOS or flash update , the motherboard drivers ( some try what 's on the CD and that 's buggy or out of date . )	St
1.4.2	With such slim details all I can say is to call the maker and ask what they want to be exchanged .	St
1.4.3	Another nutty thing is overclocking .	St
1.4.4	Imagine the poor soul that tries that .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	I just got XP home edition updated with service pack2 the video card drivers ( latest omega ) randomly worked last night however when I restarted I got the same error I have never overclocked .	St
1.5.2	BIOS is stock , as it came on the mobo , I checked ASUS website for an update however the only BIOS on their site for labeled as & quot ; initial release & quot ; so im assuming im on that now .	St
1.5.3	here are the numbers in the error 0x0000009c ( 0x00000000 , 0xf7ac3050 , 0xp02000040 , 0x00000800 )	St

1.7.1	This is a low-level hardware issue cause by : Memory errors that may include parity or Error Correction Code ( ECC ) problems Cache errors in the processor or hardware Translation Lookaside Buffers ( TLB ) errors in the processor Other CPU-vendor specific detected hardware problems Vendor-specific detected hardware problems First , you 'll need bios v 0310 ( a beta bios ) to support your CPU and RAM .	St
1.7.2	http : //support.asus.com/download/download.aspx ? SLanguage=en-us & model=P5N32-SLI % 20Deluxe The & quot ; stock & quot ; bios is not fully compatible with either .	St
1.7.3	From ASUS ' spec sheet : CPU : Socket775 for Intel Pentium Processor Extreme Edition / Pentium D / Pentium 4 / Celeron CPU Memory : Dual channel memory architecture 4 x 240-pin DIMM sockets support max .	St
1.7.4	16GB DDR2 667/533 non-ECC memory You could try manually setting your RAM to DDR2-667 since DDR2-800 can be problematic even on boards with explicit support .	St
1.7.5	Lastly , the p5n32 has been known to be troublesome with dual core intel CPUs since its release .	St
1.7.6	IMHO , you be best off exchanging the board for one based on the intel 946 , 965 or 975 chipset .	St
1.8.1	the problem seems to have been solved by some random reinstalling ... .thanks for your help ... it 's gone through 2 restarts now and no bluescreens	St
