<s> Before I pay for a disk recovery service, I was wondering if anyone has had problems with XP and the 1394 Fire wire Maxtor 80 gb external hard drive. </s>
<s> I use this drive to store music and pictures. </s>
<s> I was in the process of backing this up to a different Maxtor One Touch 250GB hard drive when I received an error and my computer froze. </s>
<s> After rebooting, unplugging the firewire cables, I was no longer able to see the 80gb drive. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, only half of my 75GB worth of data was saved on my 250GB drive. </s>
<s> Anyone help!! </s>
<s> Also, can you removed the hard drive from the external case and plug it into a IDE controller internally and make it a slave drive? </s>
<s> THANK YOU ALL! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> You'll find some reports of such. </s>
<s> I know this may be too late, but can I ask where the BACKUP was for this system? </s>
<s> Hard disks of the consumer variety are designed to last 5 years. </s>
<s> And some won't make it that long. </s>
<s> We must save what we can't lost on our BACKUP media. </s>

<s> Bob, Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I had no problems removing the hard drive from the case and hooking it up to the IDE channel internally. </s>
<s> When I booted my PC, I was able to see the drive, but WXP said that the drive needed to be formatted and I could not browse the drive. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I read somewhere about trying the Knoppix CD? </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help! </s>
<s> It supports a wider variety of disk formats. </s>
