i dont know if anyone has run into this problem but i was trying to install my new 200gig hd ,in windows xp, and it wouldnt install it with the install software cd or any possible way and then all of a sudden it started clicking and it shows on another computer that the drive is locked, is there any way to unlock it?
i want to use the drive as a second one on my computer but im afraid that i might have a new paper weight, any help would be appreciated
