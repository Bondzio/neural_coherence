1.1.1	Does or can anyone identify this video card ?	Ques
1.1.2	I wasnt to use it in an old D955 intel MB but I do not know which card it is .	St
1.1.3	I also can not find any ATI software that does an ID .	St
1.1.4	http : //sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/hs057.snc6/168747_1464924437706_1671363695_881189_140772_n.jpg Thanks !	St
1.2.1	A decent pix , but no label or decal to refer the model # .	St
1.2.2	So , if possible are there any model # on the backside ?	Ques
1.2.3	A firm answer lies under that HSF setup , if you could remove the HSF , the large IC chip IDs the product or what it is .	Sug
1.2.4	Which in turn provides the basic driver s/w .	St
1.2.5	If there is an FCC tag # , visit the FCC website and enter it to locate the model # .	St
1.2.6	If no labels/decals or silkscreened info is provided , its a hit & miss process to have the right driver s/w or install package .	St
1.2.7	In most cases , you can use the ATI driver s/w suite to load and it gets used by various video cards provided they 're driven by that same IC chip .	St
1.2.8	Installing the AGP mtrbd .	St
1.2.9	driver from Intel can also help install a video card as at least the basic install is present .	St
1.2.10	You can then use Belarc or PC Wizard 2010 to ID the product once the system is up and running .	St
1.2.11	With what you provided , that 's as far as I can go in help .	St
1.2.12	good luck tada -- -- -Willy	Polite

1.3.2	The numbers are visable .	St
