<s> I have a Seagate Barracuda 7200 rpm, SATA 200 GB hard disk, which I recently converted into a portable one by using one of those USB aluminum casings. </s>
<s> Everything was working fine until I copied some files from my friends computer, when a virus also lodged itself on my harddisk. </s>
<s> Now whenever I connected my harddisk to my laptop, the data was accessible but it always tried to autorun a program but thankfully my antivirus (Bitdefender V10) always stopped it from doing so. </s>
<s> One day I did a virus check on the harddisk using the same antivirus, It found a virus in one of the files but could not repair it so I deleted the file . </s>
<s> From that day on I am not able to access any data on my harddisk. </s>
<s> Whenever I connect it to my laptop, the harddisk is detected and I know this by: 1) The eject icon in the status bar 2) It lists the harddisk in the device manager 3) It also shows the harddisk on the BIOS settings menu at startup. </s>
<s> But the hard disk is not displayed in the explorer neither in DOS. </s>
<s> THERE IS AN OCCASIONAL BLIP-BLIP SOUND THAT COMES FROM THE HARDDISK AND THAT'S IT. </s>
<s> and there are two continuous blips at a time. </s>
<s> Also this harddisk does not have any OS on it and it has four equal partitions. </s>
<s> Please help me out........... preferably without formatting the harddisk. </s>
<s> And I didn't drop the hdd at any point of time however, I might have dropped the adapter at some point of time but still the lights on the adapter and the casing light up whenever I plug it in. </s>
<s> and connect direct to a desktop PC... You could also run the Seagate diagnostics too. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> It's now suspect. </s>
<s> Try another or go direct connect in some desktop. </s>
<s> As to the autorun you could have fixed that fast by deleting the AUTORUN.INF file in the root of the drive... Bob </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I have tried it connecting directly to another computer but still there is no response. </s>
<s> In case if you want to know the sound that comes from the harddisk it is at http://www.mediafire.com/?5fn1dglyixm </s>
