if its too much trouble for even you... yeah charter told me it would cost an extra 2 bucks/mo, and i've more than made up for the price of the modem ($80 or so iirc) by avoiding that fee over the 5 years of service.
of course i'm experiencing the drawbacks of my strategy now... anyways, hopefully someone can come up with some magical way/software utility that can help me see if my modem is working right..
