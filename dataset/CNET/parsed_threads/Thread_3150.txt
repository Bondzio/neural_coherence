<s> I know I recently made a post on this, but things have now changed. </s>
<s> I have a printer installed on this laptop (Vista Basic). </s>
<s> I need to share this printer on a network with another laptop (Vista Premium). </s>
<s> I have no idea how to do this. </s>
<s> I know the computer names. </s>
<s> I DON'T know how to find the server or printer names. </s>
<s> And Vista likes to be so damn difficult, I can't find a run feature to use the CMD thing. </s>
<s> Someome please explain to me what the hell I have to do. </s>
<s> a lot of very helpful links on the first page of http://www.google.com/search?q=printer+sharing+vista No need to copy content or links, I'd say. </s>

<s> And, Merry Christmas, if you celebrate it. </s>
<s> This thread is untracked </s>
<s> I think I have found the root of my problems. </s>
<s> Haha, technical problems, that is. </s>
<s> My printer is not showing up in the networks window. </s>
<s> The previous printer that was installed was there instead. </s>
<s> I uninstalled the old printer and restarted the computer but the new printer still isn't there. </s>
<s> I updated the driver and tried to add the printer and choosing the ports, but nothing happened. </s>
<s> The new printer IS plugged into the (Vista Basic) laptop. </s>
<s> The Local Port option says that I shouldn't use a local port if it has a USB plugged in. </s>
<s> I managed to create a shared folder and it is working perfectly. </s>
<s> I am CERTAIN that if I could get the printer to show up on the computer at all, I could share it. </s>
<s> Just to clarify, I go to Start &gt;&gt; Network and then add the printer there. </s>
<s> If I try to add the printer inside one of the computers on the network screen, Vista says I have insufficient rights. </s>
<s> Whatever the hell that means. </s>
<s> Thanks Dango and Kees for the help. </s>
<s> Merry Christmas to you both. </s>
<s> Whether you celebrate it or not. </s>
<s> :P </s>
<s> create a shortcut to the printer which probably will go to the desktop. </s>
<s> Put a copy of that shortcut into the shared folder. </s>
<s> On the other computer clk on that shortcut and see if it will access it then. </s>
<s> I do not know if this will work on Vista, so curious about it myself. </s>
<s> &quot;If I try to add the printer inside one of the computers on the network screen, Vista says I have insufficient rights. </s>
<s> Whatever the hell that means.&quot; Go into admin mode and do it, then allow all users to use it. </s>
