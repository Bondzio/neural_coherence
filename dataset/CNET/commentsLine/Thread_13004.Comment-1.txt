have ecs k7s5a board, dimm, dvd, cd burner.
first pc would start intermitently, then it stopped turning on.
i only have power to hd and floppy.
pc appeared to post,saw monitor scroll for a few seconds then go blank.
hd ran for a few minutes then system shutdown and will not start.
i have connected monitor to another pc and it is ok. using antec power supply tester ps seems to be ok; ps is 250w which may be low but system has been running for a couple years without a problem.
what else should i check?
