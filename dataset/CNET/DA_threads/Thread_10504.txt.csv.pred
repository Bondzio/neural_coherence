1.1.1	Hello All, I've been using this dvd writer for the past year and had no problems.	St
1.1.2	Recently I've written 3 dvd's and weirdly enough it doesn't playback on the dvd writer itself but plays in any other player or dvdrom, so you could say data verification in nero is always a failure.	St
1.1.3	Any solution how I can play the dvd on the dvd writer, or is there any other problem?	Sug
1.2.1	These drives have plummeted to 20 bucks at newegg and only last a year or 2.	St
1.2.2	-&gt; Save yourself!	St
1.2.3	Swap the drive out and carry on.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	are they dvds from a stack youve used before, or a new stack?	St
1.3.2	if so , maybe you should check your drive to see what kind of dvds it can run/burn	Sug
