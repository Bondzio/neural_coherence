1.1.1	So I ordered the Sound Blaster Audigy 2 to replace my onboard Realtek AC97.	St
1.1.2	My question is, can I just uninstall it from my Device Manager??.....	St
1.1.3	because I heard you had to do it through the BIOS which is something I've never tinkered with.	St
1.1.4	Also, if I uninstall it through Device Manager, will it kep trying to reinstall itself through windows detecting it?	St
1.1.5	Thanks for any help	St
1.2.1	Don't fear system BIOS, just respect it.	St
1.2.2	It never hurts to browse the menus in BIOS.	St
1.2.3	When you exit BIOS, you will always be asked to save any changes you have made.	St
1.2.4	If you are worried that you changed something you shouldn't have, just say NO to saving changes.	St
1.2.5	Go into the BIOS menus and find the option to disable the onboard sound (Realtek AC97).	St
1.2.6	Don't do anything else.	St
1.2.7	This is not difficult.	St
1.3.1	haha.. ok I'll do it.	St
1.3.2	no fear.	Res
1.3.3	If I rememebr correctly when I restart my computer, some key input (F10 or something along those line) will bring me to the BIOS settings right?	St
1.4.1	If you are a fast reader, the early black screens will display the proper key to hit to enter system BIOS (sometimes called &quot;Setup&quot;).	St
1.4.2	It's ususlly one of the function keys or Del.	St
