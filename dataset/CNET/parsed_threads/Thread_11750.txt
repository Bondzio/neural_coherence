<s> Hi, Is the a reason why some program CD are not recognized by the CD Drive. </s>
<s> I am trying to load a new program and after I insert the CD the light flickers I don't hear it spinning then I check under My Computer nd the CD doesn't even show that it is in the drive. </s>
<s> I will repeat with another disc and everything works fine. </s>
<s> Why would some CD work and others don't. </s>
<s> Any Help! </s>

<s> If they're all originals, I'd suspect your drive is going bad. </s>
<s> If they are burned copies, they are as much suspect as is the CD ROM drive. </s>
