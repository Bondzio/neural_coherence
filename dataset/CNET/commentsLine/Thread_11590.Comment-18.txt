you've helped a lot with your information.
i've decided that i still need the trackpad, so i'm crossing the latitude 10 off the list.
now, all i have left to decide on is whether to get the samsung ativ 500t, 9hr, for $680 total or the asus vivotab tf810c, 12hr, for $900 total.
if i calculate purely based on battery life, they have almost the same value/price.
i'm also about to order in some parts for a diy lithium ion battery pack @ 14.8v, 9.6ah going through a car dc port and adapter for any device i choose.
