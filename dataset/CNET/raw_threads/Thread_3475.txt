But 667 may not work correctly or cause errors in a 533 motherboard. It might &quot;underclock&quot;. I know memory will lower the clock of the fastest cards to the lowest. For example, if you put in a 512 of 533 and a 512 of 667, the 667 will clock itself down to 533, making the extra few bucks getting 667 spent gone. I may be confusing myself, are you talking about Memory and FSB? Don't think so, but making sure. ~Ibrahim~
