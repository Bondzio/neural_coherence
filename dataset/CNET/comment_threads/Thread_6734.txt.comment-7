This stupid chime kept happening on my computer and I had no idea what was causing it.
I finally typed &quot;can't get rid of chime sound on computer&quot; and got to this page.
I realized I had installed a netgear product for wireless internet a couple months ago.
I then followed your instructions and no sound since!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've spent hours and hours trying to figure this out.
Thank you so so so so much!
