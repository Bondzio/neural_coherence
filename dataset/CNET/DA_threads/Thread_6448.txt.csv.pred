1.1.1	I have a desktop with 2 drives a C which shows up as windows and is 50gb and a D which shows up as Data and is 1.8tb.	St
1.1.2	I was told that everything would automatically go where it was supposed to go.	St
1.1.3	However when I tried to save a programme - it defaulted to C drive - the computer said I did not have enough space on the drive.	St
1.1.4	It said I needed 15gb and I only had 13 gb.	St
1.1.5	When I go to my menu I see that just about everything is on C drive and my D drive is just about empty.	St
1.1.6	Can I just decide to save everything to D, or can I rename D to C and what do I do when things automatically want to go to C. Can I just change this to D. If necessary will have to get a technician in, but I'm hoping someone can give me hints.	St
1.1.7	I back up both drives on an external drive.	St
1.1.8	Thank you - June	St
1.2.1	But I've never found this to be automatic.	St
1.2.2	I never suggest a small C drive unless the owner is very PC savvy.	St
1.2.3	It's far too much to ask new owners to cater to such a setup.	St
1.2.4	No.	St
1.2.5	You can't rename D to C. Bob	Ques
1.3.1	with 2 partitions like &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;?	St
1.3.2	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Yes there are definitely 2 drives.	St
1.4.2	The C drive has 59 gb and that is the one that is nearly full.	St
1.4.3	The D drive has 1.8 Tb and that is the one that is nearly empty.	St
1.4.4	Thanks - June	St
1.5.1	as most systems have only one HDD....sometimes split or partitioned into two or more logical drives.	St
1.5.2	But if you're sure there are 2 separate physical drives mounted internally...the options are to replace the smaller HDD and image the smaller HDD to it.	St
1.5.3	Or you could image the smaller drive (C) to the larger drive and use the 1.8TB HDD as your internal HDD.	St
1.5.4	Personally I like the idea of two internal HDDs as I use the 2nd HDD solely as a backup to the 1st HDD.	St
1.5.5	With a second drive mounted internally, backups and restores are quick and easy.	St
1.5.6	External HDDs are OK but usually less reliable as you can see from reading in this forum.	St
1.5.7	VAPCMD	St
