<s> I have a EA6300 set up in my small duplex and it is crippling my download speeds. </s>
<s> Ran a program called Network Logger for 24 Hours hard wired into modem, had an average 88.03Mbps Download and 19.1 Mbps. </s>
<s> Another 24 Hours wired into router 84.11Mbps down and 19Mbps up. </s>
<s> Awesome. </s>
<s> 24 Hours on 2.4Ghz network roughly 30 feet from router 9Mbps down and 4.4Mbps up. </s>
<s> 24 Hours on 5 Ghz network same place in house 11Mbps down and 997 kbps up (I would trim this upload, but its 24 hours with a 30 second refresh rate) I have no cap on my usage, and I also pay for 70+ Mbps. </s>
<s> This wireless is killing my speed, what gives? </s>
<s> Linksys says they want to replace the router, but the **bleep** thing is brand new. </s>
<s> I have the router set up exactly as Linksys told me to, prioritization is disabled. </s>
<s> Other information (This is from inSSIDer) 5 Ghz RSSI -70 Channel 36 + 40 WPA2 Personal Max Transfer Rate 450Mbps There is no (0) other traffic on the lower 5 Ghz freq 2.4 Ghz RSSI -52 Channel 3 WPA2 Personal Max Transfer Rate 130Mbps There is a bit of traffic on the 2.4Ghz freq, but Channel 3 and 4 are not used (except by me) Channel 7-11 are extremely clogged and Channel 1 has about 5 networks on it. </s>
<s> Also to note, on the 2.4 Ghz channel my PS3 gets 2-4Mbps down and 700kbps up in roughly the same place as the laptop. </s>
<s> If anyone has any ideas on how to speed this up that would be quite useful. </s>
<s> Note: Up until about a week ago the only thing I knew about wifi was how to use the wizard when you get a new router. </s>
<s> I am catching up, but bear with me. </s>
<s> Those WiFi speeds are under the best of conditions. </s>
<s> i.e. </s>
<s> laboratory results. </s>
<s> Also, if the wifi card in the laptops are well, not current or from the same maker as the router, speeds do fall. </s>
<s> I've only seen full speeds under ideal conditions and when I used a linksys router and matching linksys wifi cards. </s>
<s> Why not let linksys swap that router? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What wifi speeds would you be referring to? </s>
<s> I think that a 80% decrease in download speeds should not be warranted, given I've seen wireless hit almost 30Mbps on this laptop on other routers. </s>
<s> I'm not looking for 80-100 Mbps, but something over 9 or 10 would be nice. </s>
<s> Keep in mind this is an average over 24 hours. </s>
<s> There were times when it was as low as 4 or 5 Mbps. </s>
<s> This is my only router at this moment, and if I send it to linksys I go dark for awhile. </s>
<s> This wouldn't be an issue, but me and the wife use the internet for work. </s>
<s> The cards and routers have to negotiate and if they are not matched up, they can negotiate it wrong. </s>
<s> There are consumers that don't want to get into the dirty bits but in short, try setting it all as 802.11g and hope that helps. </s>
<s> Why would you go dark as you can run wired? </s>
<s> Something's not right here. </s>
<s> Also there's always Virtual Router to stand in. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think that's sad. </s>
<s> The wireless card seems to be fine, but I understand what you mean about the cards not syncing. </s>
<s> I'll try g, thanks. </s>
<s> Yes, I can leave a MacBook down near the modem and Internet share, but wired is mostly out of the question unless I want to buy a few hundred feet of cat 5 or sit on my washer to chart. </s>
<s> I don't know what you meant about something being wrong there, but I meant what I said. </s>
<s> You wrote you got it to work wired then wrote you would go dark. </s>
<s> This didn't make any sense to me as it worked wired and we have Virtual Router for our Windows PCs and Apple has it's own way of doing that. </s>
<s> We also have a dozen settings on WiFi routers to try but I can't do that on a forum. </s>
<s> I will offer the usual that works for most and not get into the other area (that's for support folk to do.) </s>
<s> This is only a discussion forum and I'll share or discuss this but in no way am support. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah it works fine wired, but check this out. </s>
<s> My work space is not (not) next to my modem. </s>
<s> So in order to do this, I would have to haul all my stuff to my modem to work. </s>
<s> This is not feasable, therefore I require either wifi or 150 ft of cat 5 for my wife to trip over or complain about. </s>
<s> As it turns out, I don't have an extra computer to use as a router, and buying one to do that seems counterintuitive. </s>
<s> Is that more clear? </s>
<s> The cost of the ethernet cable is about the price of a cheap wifi router. </s>
<s> In fact, I was on travel and in a pinch needed a temporary router. </s>
<s> I went to Fry's and for under 20 bucks was done. </s>
<s> A 150 foot Ethernet cable could cost as much. </s>
<s> -&gt; But are you saying you have wifi out at 150 feet? </s>
<s> I missed that detail and it can explain almost all of the troubles. </s>
<s> You may have to deploy another system to move the WAP closer to your PCs. </s>
