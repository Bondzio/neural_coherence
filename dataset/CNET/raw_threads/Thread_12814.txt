I've had friends that have had HDTVs and they just use regular over the air antenna's the picture is nice and clear except for some mild lag sometimes. My tuner right now is old and analog... it looks like this http://www.flickr.com/photos/14405843@N06/1466646422/?addedcomment=1#comment72157602216062912 when I have bad reception. If I get an HDTV Tuner for my computer will it still look like that or would it be nice and clear... even when using an ordinary over the air antenna and not satelitte or cable (cause I'm not getting that any time soon). Also recommendations for a Tuner would be nice and here are my computer specs... 3.2 GHz Intel P4 HT CPU x800GTO 256MB PCI-E VideoCard Dual monitors one being a 24&quot; SyncMaster 245BW and other being the Sync Master 712 (I'd only watch probably on my 24&quot;... would this tuner match to the WideScreen aspect that my monitor gives?) 1 GB RAM P.S. In the future if I get a 360 or a PS3 would I be able to connect these and be able to play from the tuner or my computer? Thanks a lot fot the help.
