hello kritz, as your hard drive is not being detected, you need to contact some data recovery service provider, such that they can recover your data back.
as you said that your hard drive head is alright, i think the changing of ic board will do the job and you will recover 100% of your data.
you can contact stellar information for the data recovery service.
