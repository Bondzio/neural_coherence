I suppose you are refering to the L1 L2 cache not getting flushed?
I can see where some files could get screwed up in a situation like this but for the life of me I can't see no way in hades the entire system folder or more especially the Windows directory could actually vanish off the hard drive.
Like it's POOF they're gone.
Where can I find more info on machines not flushing the cache, Bob?
Thanks for your responses by the way.
