Some times PC not power on, mobo led bulb works, but not booting But after 2/3 days its working normally, Once starts it working completely normally, No over heatings, 45-49 C processor temp, 70-72 C while games playing. (71 C normal in Core2Quad Kentsfield cpu) 2. Some times processor identified wrongly as Core2Due, but after restart it shows correctly as Core2Quad. 3. Computer booting and no display, after 4-5 seconds it is restarting and still no disply and keep restarting. But it is works fine when I re-install the battery,VGA or Ram cards until I turn off the PC. When next day same problem continues. (This problem arise when PC is shutdown around 10-12 hrs, boot completely normally otherwise.) 4. Some times take too much time to pass the POST screen. What are your ideas, please reply

If I were you, I'd consider an aftermarket CPU HS Fan....check out http://www.FROSTYTECH.COM . I'm running an i860 that runs at 30C 95% of the time and only reaches 50c when I run 4 to 6 queries simultaneously. Running at max TDP is a recipe for premature death or erratic behavior. VAPCMD

12448	7	574287	5366988	5366827	R. Proffitt	9/28/12 9:29 AM	1.34882454E12	Sorry, no.	And details are too slim about the existing system and there was no link for me to see what this Axel is. Did you measure the CMOS Battery with a Volt meter? What was it? Sorry but troubleshooting this one is not easy on a forum. Unless some clue pops up. Bob
12448	8	574287	5367168	5366823	VAPCMD	9/28/12 4:35 PM	1.3488501E12	Ok on the CMOS battery....re the CPU	HS Fan.....the high ambient temp is even more reason to opt for a good CPU HS Fan like the ones reviewed over at Frostytech.com. I've used a number of them and I really like the ones from Xigmatek. Decent price....good thermal performance. Might be good to list the exact system components to see if there are other possibilities. VAPCMD
