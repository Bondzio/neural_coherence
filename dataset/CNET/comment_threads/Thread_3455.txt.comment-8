Geez Randun I didn't mean anything negative.
My post was directed to steve and not you.
I think it's great that your on the backup route.
You can learn from all the mistakes that others have made or do it the hard way and make all the same mistakes on your own.
I was just trying to point out that there are two parts to a backup.
BACKUP RESTORE You can spend hours daily/weekly/monthly doing backups only to find that when you need them the restore function does not work.
It's a heck of a time to find out the backup compressed the data better than was expected.
(bummer) Anyway no slight intended.
