some power-on switches do go bad, its not that common.
the atx power supplies when pushing the power button takes time to react and its best maintain pressing until the system starts to power-on.
the frt.
panel power sw. is usually has a wire harness to the mtrbd.
it maybe not seated fully or the crimps of connector pins are flimsy, check all that by opening case and inspect.
the power supply itself maybe flaky and starting to fail.
if this is a new system, use the warranty or call-in the problem.
you may have other problems, but if you feel uncomfortable in fixing it, it maybe best to allow a pro at it or a &quot;trusted, but knowledgable&quot; friend at it.
good luck -----willy
