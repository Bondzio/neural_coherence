michael: i regularly run ad-aware and spybot and often have very few items to remove.
will also use registry mechanic to clean registry.
i am running xp sp2, 512 ram, amd athlon xp 1.47g.
harware includes a motorola sb4200 modem, logitech wireless mouse and keyboard, xtasy 9200se 128mb video card, audixy sx usb sound card, creative tv card, and a pinnicle video capture card.
i have 5 usb ports in the rear and all are full.
2 up front are used infrequently.
2 firewire ports are on the same pci card that has the 3 usb ports.
ehternet card is a d-link dfe-530tx+ so what we are running into is even though there is something wrong with the ethernet connection on the desktop i would be able to keep the wired usb connection and add a wireless laptop via ethernet through the wireless modem??
thanks
