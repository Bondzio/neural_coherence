<s> I don't like to complain but consumers should be informed before they are victimized, as well. </s>
<s> In May, 2007 I contacted HP Technical Support and was sold a new printer. </s>
<s> Upon receipt, I learned it was remanufactured. </s>
<s> No one had told me this fact beforehand. </s>
<s> In June, 2007 I returned the printer. </s>
<s> In July, 2007 I had not been issued a credit. </s>
<s> I called and was told not to worry and then the call was disconnected. </s>
<s> In August, 2007, the same thing occurred. </s>
<s> I asked to speak to a supervisor and then no one answered the telephone after a 15 minute wait. </s>
<s> I can't believe that such a large company can stoop to such underhanded business practices. </s>
<s> I finally contacted VISA to handle the problem. </s>
<s> What would have happened if I had paid by check. </s>
<s> Typical HP Parts Store problems, I don't have an exact link, however its well documented that HP Parts Store is the absolute pits for anything, which would probably explain why you got a remanufactured printer, and could explain the poor service. </s>
<s> I agree that that QoS is pathetic on their part though, and that (among other reasons) is why I haven't purchased an HP product in almost 10 years. </s>
<s> Another thing to note on HP support (and most printer manufacturers) if the printer costs less than the ink, they won't offer support for it (even if they say they do), and will instead just try to replace the unit without asking you any troubleshooting questions (because the printers are designed as throw-aways, internally). </s>
<s> This may seem advantageous, however I personally don't want a product thats designed to be trashed every 4 to 6 months because its cheaper to do that than it is to provide technical support for it. </s>
