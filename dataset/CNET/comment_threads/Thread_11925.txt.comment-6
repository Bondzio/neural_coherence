Since this is still in the CES loop and not readily available and/or in initial stages of possible purchase, it's all too new.
If a user has a need for 1,000s yrs.
of media storage, heck that's the way to go.
Me and you as home users, well wouldn't there be something more advantageous in the future.
Of course, they're expensive, it's all new and such.
It's nice they can be played on std.
players/drives that is a plus in IMO.
What value of this new media is still left to the open market.
