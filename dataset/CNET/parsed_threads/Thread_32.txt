<s> I just built my first computer and was checking the CPU temp through the bios and it was at 49 to 50C with no load. </s>
<s> Is this too high? </s>
<s> I'm not sure what determines just what the CPU temperature should be, but my components are: MOB: DFI LANPARTY UT nF3 250GB CPU: AMD athlon 64 3200+ Newcastle (Socket 754) HD: WD 160Gb serial ATA 150 7200rpm Video Card: ATI Radeon X700 PRO AGP 256mb Mem: OCZ Ultra High performance Dual Channel Kit 1Gig 3200 (2 x 512mb) Monitor: Viewsonic VA1912b OS: Windows XP Pro Optical Drives: Lite-On DVD and Plextor DVD burner Power: Antec True power 480W Thanks </s>

<s> install a program that will allow you to monitor temp while the sytem is doing various level stress tasks. </s>
<s> Such as &quot;Speed Fan&quot;. </s>
<s> Google it. </s>
<s> building a computer, so I appreciate your help. </s>
<s> I am going to google your suggestion. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> There are many really helpful people here. </s>
<s> Feel free to ask as many questions and as often as necessary. </s>
<s> If you do not understand a reply fully, simply ask for more of an explanation. </s>
<s> Always nice, if you then let us know if you got the problem solved. </s>
<s> As you may find, many prefer to try to get that temp lower. </s>
<s> And with improved case cooling and maybe a better HSF you can get the idle down to 38 to 40 C. It just isn't necessary unless you are a gamer and the running temo gets into the 60 C's. </s>
<s> I only use caes with top exghaust fan and a side fan that blows in. </s>
<s> These in combination with a rear exhaust fan [in addition to that of the power supply]. </s>
<s> Most cases come with more locations to locate fans, than fans that they provide. </s>
<s> If you add any fans, get dual ball bearing type, they last longer. </s>
<s> I'm going to get the program to check the temp when the pc is used for gaming, and then if I need more cooling I'll check out the fans as you suggested. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
