A Fry's electronics is having a grand opening and they had the Riviera for only $20.
Had to get it.
I know Soundblaster has good high-end stuff but I'm not a real audiophile.
It sounds awesome to me.
Besides, I put it in an eMachines, with an AMD processor, I figured I'd continue with the underdog company theme... (Yeah, eMachines is owned by Gateway now, but even Gateway is an underdog compared to the great &quot;Dell&quot;.)
trw.
