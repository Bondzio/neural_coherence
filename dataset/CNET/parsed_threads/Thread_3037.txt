<s> On the hardware side you need: 1) A network card or adapter in each computer 2) A length of CAT5 cable long enough to connect the two cards On the sofware side: 1) Internet Connection Sharing read all about it here&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.practicallynetworked.com/sharing/ </s>

<s> Two places to look: 1) Device Manager under Network Adapters 2) The back of your computer for a connector slightly bigger then a telephone jack. </s>
