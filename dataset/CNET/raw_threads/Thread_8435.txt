However, I think I've narrowed down my decision to the Google Nexus 7 comming out this month. My questions are these: 1. Does the tablet I purchase necessarily limit from where I can purchase eBooks and other media? My concern is that if I buy a particular tablet that I may be limited it's proprietary online store limiting either my selection or charging unfair rates for eBooks that might be offered elsewhere cheaper. 2. If I am limited, how does Google (for Nexus 7) compare with Amazon (for Kindle Fire). Please explain if I'm not understanding issue properly. thanks!

If you get some Android and install the Kindle app, wouldn't that let you get access to that? And with that Android I can install the Barnes Noble app and get stuff there as well. The Kindle Fire is a GOOD DEVICE but I don't see it being as open as other pads but then again, you can read PDFs and more on it. Just don't expect to find the other competitor reader software on it.

Also the ePub format gives you more flexibility and a better price point than the kindle does. Why Amazon wants you to pay more than half price for an eBook beats me. Common Amazon. If eBooks cost you less than half to make and they're are looked down to you so you cannot lend them or borrow some-one elses book like you can with a hard copy, then you should pay alot less! IMHO ebook readers are in general too small. So the one thing Apple got right was the size of the iPad. I will get the asus transformer android tablet soon as the ereaders are too small and too slow and you cannot read technical pdf files very well. There are also lots of cheap android tablets that would most likely give you a better experience than an eReader device and way more flexibility. That being said, if you only read novels and one at a time, then a cheap eReader might suffice, else the colour tablets are way more flexible. Then it just comes down to reading at night in bed - go android or reading in daylight go eReader, and the battery life.

Recently, I put a microSD chip in my Nook that turned the Nook into an Android reader. As an Android I have access to the entire Android Market (you don't have that with either the Nook or Kindle) where I downloaded the Kindle and Barnes and Noble apps. When I want to download a book I go to both Amazon and B&N and download the one with the cheapest price (usually they are the same). The Nexus 7 will be an Android reader so you will have the same capability. The 7&quot; tablet is a good size for a reader. It is easy to carry and hold while reading. As to the response that the cost of ebooks should be much less that paper books is not true. I worked for a publisher for 14 years and the cheapest part of the cost is the printing and binding. The majority of the cost goes into the editing and author royalties. Yes, ebooks should be cheaper than the paper version, but the reduction should be closer to 15% not 50%.

From the reviews and my own personal interaction with it at previews I'd have to say that it is rather good for its price (around $299). It is pretty cool, and with Google Play it is a god send. You have no idea how better I feel when holding this and reading a book than holding an overpriced iPad instead and always worrying about losing it.
