Hello, thank you for taking the time to read and help me with my question.
I've slowly been buying parts for my new computer build over the weeks and I just tried putting it together last night to no avail.
After assembled correctly, (all wiring checked and rechecked), The power button immediately starts every fan in the system (All 5 casefans, psu fan, cpu heatsink fan, gpu fan) but I hear no sounds similar to that of the actual computer starting.
The monitor stops displaying *No signal* when I plug it in, and it's light just goes orange.
Nothing plugged into usb ports will light up (Mouse/usb storage).
There are no beep codes during any of this and I am seriously perplexed.
System specs- Foxconn AMD AM3 Mobo - ATX 16GB Ripjaws RAM (Only one 4gb stick inserted for test) Sapphire Radeon HD 6850 GPU (Unplugged and sat aside after first test, no difference in result) 650 watt Antec PSU AMD Phenom II X4 3.8ghz Processor SATA 500GB Laptop HDD (Test purposes only, havn't bought the one I want yet.
This has Windows 7 already installed onto it.)
I would appreciate if anyone could look at this and give me any fresh input, it's very discouraging .
