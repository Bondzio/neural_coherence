Here's what I'm looking at: AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+(65W) Windsor 2.2GHz 2 x 512KB L2 Cache Socket AM2 Processor DFI LANPARTY UT NF590 SLI-M2R/G Socket AM2 NVIDIA nForce 590 SLI MCP ATX AMD Motherboard SAPPHIRE 100162L Radeon X1300XT 256MB 128-bit GDDR2 PCI Express x16 CrossFire Video Card OCZ Gold 1GB (2 x 512MB) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 (PC2 6400) Dual Channel Kit Desktop Memory Now a few questions, how does the config look? I plan to upgrade to 2gb of memory later. One question I have is about dual video cards, this is my first setup like this (always been Intel) and I need to know if buying two of those video cards will give me the advance graphics I'm looking for. Any help is appreciated as always!

I have done many upgrades and I have to say the best upgrades I ever did was to get a better monitor and speakers. If you are using anything less than 19inches or cheap speakers you will definitly enjoy improving those first. I know it sounds stupid, but these are investments that are worth it becuase they DONT get outdated. My next upgrade is going to be a new desk so that I can type easier. Sometimes whats around the box is more important than whats in it.
