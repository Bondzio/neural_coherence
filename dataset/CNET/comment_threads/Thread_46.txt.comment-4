apologies for omitting these bits of information.
yeah, i'm using a patch cable, and oddly enough that same domain works with my laptop; that's what puzzles me the most, it doesn't want to work under seemingly the same conditions.
i also tried different domains to verify if that was really the problem, but i still don't get a response.
