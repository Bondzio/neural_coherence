<s> I am having trouble connecting to my desktop PC (running Windows XP SP2) from other laptop PCs on my local network. </s>
<s> I have set up folder sharing on all the XP PCs but I am not able to &quot;see&quot; folders on the desktop PC. </s>
<s> I try to open any folder on my XP SP3 PC from a laptop, and I get: &quot;\\JEFF-AMD\jeff-amd Documents is not accessible. </s>
<s> You might not have permission to use this network resource. </s>
<s> Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> Not enough server storage is available to process this command. </s>
<s> So, I would appreciate any help you could give me to allow me to access files on the desktop PC from the client laptop. </s>
<s> When I go the other way, I can open directories on the laptops from the desktop PC no problem. </s>
<s> So I don't think it's a router/firewall problem. </s>

<s> Many don't understand that Norton and others continue to work in spite of us setting them to disabled. </s>
<s> Some don't have control of the firewall in the router. </s>
