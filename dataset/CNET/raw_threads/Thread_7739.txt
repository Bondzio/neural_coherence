I had to take lots of time to size it up my screen to look nice. the problem is when i play battlefield vietnam, it doesnt have 1280 x 1024 resolution meaning i play with two big black bars across the sides of my monitor. I dont want to make my screen fit and get rid of the black bars because when i exit out of my game my desktop resolution will make my screen all screwed up. Is there anyway i can fix this problem.

My only GUESS is that you can try another REFRESH RATE setting for that game. I will not know how to change that for that one game. You may have to ask the game supplier. Bob
