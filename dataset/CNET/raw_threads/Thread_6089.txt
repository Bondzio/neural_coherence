It just freezes up and the light stays on as though it is operating. Those it will not recongize it will not format either. Lets say that I have 7 zip disks. Four will be read and writable. Three have files and Folders on them but are not at least readable. Nor can I format them. This does not make any difference whether they are 250 or 100 size disks. I also have a paralel 250 drive that stopped reading 250 zips and will only read the 100's. Anyone have any suggestions. I am mainly interested in the USB drive. Thank you

If you have used older zip disks and found them to be failing, they've reached the end of the line. Further, a bad ZIP disk can effect other good disks as the wear&tear on the drive itself could be at at fault -OR- become faulty due to bad disks. Once, you experience a bad disk, save whatever data and try to another one, swap data. Overall, I don't recommend ZIp drives unless you got to have them. They have fallen out of favor with users due to this. tada -----Willy

Only thing that I don't like is, the files on the disks, I can not retrieve unless i send them to Iomega and for a price they will get the files off. This i don't intend to do, as they got enough of my money. Also they are of no help with the problem. Thanks for your replies, larry
