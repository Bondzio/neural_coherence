ACER sent another computer. A month later ALL the USB ports were dead. They would be recognized only one out of ten times the computer was powered on. ACER overnighted a new mother board and promised a tech support guy to provide their &quot;on-site&quot; support. Guy never showed, never called. We finally called corporate and after an hour or so got his pager number. Claimed his car was towed and he was at the Chrysler dealership. Asked to speak to someone at the dealership to conform. Ooops....he hung up...caught in a lie. Now waiting 30 minutes for ACER &quot;technical support&quot;. STAY AWAY FROM ACER......you have been warned!!!

What do you expect? I beat you can't see what I'm talking about. By the way, HP and Compaq are the same company. This thread is untracked.
