<s> Hi there, My O/S is corrupted and I need to install it into another machine as a slave, so i can transfer the files I cannot afford to lose off of it, before I format it. </s>
<s> Is this possible, and if so, can someone explain how. </s>
<s> thanks Daren </s>
<s> Sorry, should have said need to transfer hard drive to another machine, not O/S. </s>
<s> Today's machines use 80 conductor IDE cables and all drives set to CABLE SELECT. </s>
<s> I only need to find an open IDE connection and plug the drive there and then the power, then power up to get at the files. </s>
<s> If you don't have 80 conductor IDE cables then you get to learn about jumpers. </s>
