<s> Here is a common question I think. </s>
<s> I have a perfectly working Windows XP setup, 160 gb drive. </s>
<s> I see a lot of 'backup' solutions and I regularly burn off photos and docs to a CD-rom archive. </s>
<s> I see 'raid' options and a lot of external hard drives that do 'incremental' back ups. </s>
<s> I do not want a real time fail safe. </s>
<s> I think my issue with this is that if I have a dual/redundant drive that is storing data in two places, its real time and so its always mirroring what the environment looks like. </s>
<s> I am not seeking that. </s>
<s> I also do not want to crack open my case if I do not have too and make any jumper/switch settings or change the CMOS (because everything works right now). </s>
<s> Here is what I DO want to do; I want to take an exact image of everything on the PC. </s>
<s> not a 'restore' point. </s>
<s> I am talking every file, every registry setting, every thing. </s>
<s> A true image of the hole enchilada. </s>
<s> Every save game on every installed application, just as it is. </s>
<s> not an incremental anything, a true image. </s>
<s> Then if I should mess things up on the PC or get bombarded with issues, I want to be able to blow away everything and go back to things EXACTLY as they are on the image. </s>
<s> I have heard of a product called 'Arconis True Image' and my understanding is you can even create a shadow drive that is sitting on your hard drive you can revert from, but I am afraid then I go from 160gb to 80gb effectively. </s>
<s> So I am not sure that is the best option. </s>
<s> I have seen some interesting external hard drives, but they are not bootable, and so I think that while I may be able to push my data there, I am not sure that I can do a complete swap of what was on the external for the internal. </s>
<s> I know this much; you can't yank the hard drive from one and put it another, because the OS sees this change and will now not register windows XP to the new drive. </s>
<s> Significant hard ware changes seem to cause problems. </s>
<s> Please give me a simple solution to creating a perfect image on an external drive or a virtual drive (as a last resort). </s>
<s> Type that into google.com and enjoy. </s>

<s> Hello Kaenash. </s>
<s> Acronis True Image creates an exact image of everything on the PC, every file, every registry setting, every save game on every installed application, just as it is. </s>
<s> You can restore this image at any time, so you'll get everything back as it is when you create the image. </s>
<s> Acronis has a secure zone it's a hidden partition where you can keep the imagies. </s>
<s> But you may not use is, if you want. </s>
<s> True Image has a high level compression option so if you make a backup from 160 GB the image file will be much smaller. </s>
<s> If you use an external HDD, you can create a bootable media CD, boot from it and restore the image from an external HDD. </s>
<s> At least if you need to upgrade to another HDD, you'll be able to restore the image on a new drive. </s>
<s> http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/ </s>
<s> It's MaxBlast. </s>
<s> It'll clone a drive and the utility is free from Maxtor (or whatever the name is now). </s>
<s> I'd just buy a new HD, clone your PC drive to the new one, and put it away for safe keeping. </s>
<s> I am not sure I follow the advice. </s>
<s> Let me clarify and make sure I understand. </s>
<s> First, this maxblast software comes bundled on external hard drives? </s>
<s> Basically, my vision was buying a 160gb external drive and then either having this arconis or something bundled with it make a bit by bit back up of the whole thing including the boot sector. </s>
<s> Then lets say I get so inundated with worms and spyware that I say ''Hey, I want to go back to when it was good again'' rather than select 'system restore' which is going to do only partially what I want, I go hook the USB of this external drive that has been sitting on the shelf since I took a healthy image up. </s>
<s> I press a 'button' that basically wipes EVERYTHING from the current hard drive and replaces it with this image on the external hd. </s>
<s> That is the part that to me seems surreal. </s>
<s> I see how if its just data files going from one place to another (MPEGS, MP3) it would work. </s>
<s> But how do you wipe out one and replace with another? </s>
<s> The OS would have to be erased so once its erased what allows it to access a usb drive and overwrite? </s>
<s> I saw the part about the bootable CD and that sounds like what I would do is wipe things out, then plug in the bootable CD with fingers crossed it didn't get scratched. </s>
<s> Then plug in the USB and let it load to the C drive of my freshly formatted PC drive the image from the external drive. </s>
<s> I do not have a problem buying the arconis and the external HD OR just buying a maxtor if it has what I need bundled. </s>
<s> just tell me what to do. </s>
<s> thanks guys. </s>
<s> I think we are on the right track, I just don't want to spend 400 bucks on a external drive and software only to find out 'oops, you aren't backing up your pictures? </s>
<s> well you can't restore these settings and registry' I understand the CMOS itself is not something I can back up or restore. </s>
<s> Some one could probably make a nice dollar bundling a perfect archived healthy backup product that you touch a button to save and touch a button to replace and this process is all automated. </s>
<s> Do you use it for a backup or just when changing drives ? </s>
<s> Only thing I would be concerned about is there's no compression and just one copy to affect the restore. </s>
<s> I use Ghost and do image backups with it regularly. </s>
<s> to a second internal hard drive. </s>
<s> It's only weakness is no automatic incrementals. </s>
<s> After I do the backup to a second internal hard disk...I copy the backup images to an external and store it off site. </s>
<s> I'm a believer...backup or prepare for the heck that one will endure when your hard drive fails....not if..just when. </s>
<s> http://www.farstone.com/home/ensite/products/restoreit-pro.shtml This tool &quot;Sounds&quot; like what I am seeking. </s>
<s> Anyone know about it? </s>
<s> it has two options, incremental and a complete backup. </s>
<s> The idea was as I said to make a USB copy of my hard drive down to every last detail, then put it on a shelf. </s>
<s> eventually I get tired of sluggishness and I can zap this new copy back on there in place of the old one. </s>
<s> This thing claims it loads before windows does, which is why you can do that. </s>
<s> My big concern with it, (other than it is only available online) is that I have concerns that it will do harm loading before windows does potentially. </s>
<s> I once owned &quot;System suite 5&quot; which is perhaps why I say all this paranoia. </s>
<s> It had a ridiculous restore function that I had trusted. </s>
<s> Sadly, it required a mouse. </s>
<s> I have (as most do) a USB mouse. </s>
<s> What idiot disabled the tab keys or arrow keys to navigate around and requires a mouse for restoring? </s>
<s> Anyway, it was pure junk that did a lot more harm and no good. </s>
<s> thanks for the help </s>
<s> For the time being I'll use GHOST 2003 for my image backups/restores and will continue testing True Image 9.0 and NovaBackup 7.3 (as soon as it arrives). </s>
<s> I tried Norton GoBack a long time ago and it too did something at STARTUP that conflicted with other utilities I used so I stopped using it. </s>
<s> Having used NovaStor/NovaBackup before GHOST...I'm hopeful their new product will give the backup and restore capabilities I'm looking for. </s>
<s> I definitely don't want to have to install Windows and a backup program to effect a full restore. </s>
<s> That's what Norton GHOST has done so well for me and the handful of freinds and relatives I help for these many years. </s>
