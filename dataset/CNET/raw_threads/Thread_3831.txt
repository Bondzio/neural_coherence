How can you know how many wireless signals are in the neighborhood? And how many are too many? Janet

Turn it on and it should show you the wireless networks in range. If you can find the reviewer's email address, ask him.

We found it causes network drop outs but who are we to give out advice that could stop owners from calling in hired help? That is, please try it our way. There is NO added security by hiding the SSID. It's in each packet that's sent out so newer software will show the hidden ones. Only those that stuck with what Windows uses will call it more secure. You can used wired now, wireless cards can be added later. Bob

I live in an apartment building and my laptop can easily pick up 10-15 wireless networks. I recently installed a Belkin N+ router. I am using an HP pavillion notebook running Windows Vista. If the laptop is fairly close to the Belkin router, I get fairly quick webpage downloads. If I move the laptop to a different room, maybe 30-40 feet away from the router, I have very slow connection and frequent network drops. I have already tried changing channels. I am beginning to wonder if I purchased the wrong router. Any thoughts? Thanks

I had the Comcast guys come and check the internet signal, which was strong and uninterrupted. I took the usual steps (power cycling the modem and router, changing wireless channels, resetting modem to factory defaults, etc.) to no avail. I have seen rumblings around the internet about problems with this router. There is no new firmware upgrade to address these issues. It's a shame because I was getting great speed and throughput on the router before these problems arose. I ended up returning the router and getting a Linksys N router - that seemed to solve my problems.

For a little while the router worked alright, but it's digressed to the point where its un-usable on most of my laptops unless you're within 5 feet of the unit. When i try to load a page from the next room (10-15 feet away) the signal slowly fades from 160+mbps, with strong signal strength, down to 11, then disconnects from the network completely, even with a full strength signal. The page times out, after which i can re-connect to the network at full strength and repeat the whole frustrating ordeal again... sigh. Interestingly, my netbook connects fine throughout the house. Not sure how that works out... Im going to give this to one of my friends and get a Netgear or Linksys. This unit has caused me endless hours of frustration.

This problem occurs with my Dell Studio 15 laptop running Win7 Home Premium which I purchased early this year. But I don't have this problem with my 4 year old Lenovo Thinkpad T61 laptop running WinXP SP3. So that tells me that there is a compatibility issue between the internal wireless adapter in the Dell and the Belkin. I did try to muck around with the advanced wireless card settings in the Dell but I had to be careful as I am not a networking expert and was afraid of making the problem worse. I was hoping to find a posting somewhere that specified some settings that could be changed to fix this problem but my broader searches on this issue seems to point to a firmware problem.
