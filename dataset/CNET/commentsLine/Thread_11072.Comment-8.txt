directly from dell's website: what processors does my system support?
the poweredge 400sc supports a single processor and been tested, validated and manufactured in these configurations: intel celeron processor at speeds of 2.0 and 2.4ghz, 400mhz front side bus (fsb), 128kb cache intel pentium 4 (northwood) processor at the speed of 2.26ghz, 533mhz fsb, 512kb cache intel pentium 4 (northwood) processor at speeds of 2.0ghz, 2.4ghz, 2.8ghz and 3.4ghz, 800mhz fsb, 512kb cache intel pentium 4 (prescott) processor at the speed of 3.4ghz, 800mhz fsb, 512kb and 1mb cache.
these processors fit into the intel &quot;socket n&quot;, 478 pin, ziff processor socket so if it supports a prescott at 3.4ghz, wouldn't that mean a 3.0ghz processor (prescott) would work?
back in the days of the 80486 computers this stuff was much easier!
