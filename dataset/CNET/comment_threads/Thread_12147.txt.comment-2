Get reviews of said notebooks and use the video benchmarks to compare.
Pros for Shared Memory Graphics: - Less power required.
- More time on battery (same size battery!)
- Less heat.
- Cheaper.
Cons for same.
- Gamers loathe such.
- 3D performance pales to dedicated video memory and GPU.
- Some CPU performance loss as video memory access causes the CPU to &quot;wait.&quot; - More money.
Hope this helps.
