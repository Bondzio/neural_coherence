newer to computers: just out of curiosity...i'm thinking about extra storage and flexibility in the case of something ever going wrong with my computer.
i've looked at internal and external hard drives.
if i were to buy an external (usb), such as an iomega 40gig, would it be possible to install windows xp on it and use it as the main hard drive.
new to all this stuff.
thanks for the help.
