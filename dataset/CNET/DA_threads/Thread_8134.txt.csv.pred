1.1.1	I have bought a DI-524 wireless router .	St
1.1.2	I followed all the instructions to configure the router 's hardware and software and after several calls to D-Link , I achieved success .	St
1.1.3	I have my notebook connected to LAN Port 1 on the router and an old Windows 98 computer has a D-Link wireless PCI card in it .	St
1.1.4	It all worked .	St
1.1.5	Both computers could access the internet and I set up a small home network successfully .	St
1.1.6	When I turned my notebook on the next morning , my entire D-Link folder and contents had disappeared -- evaporated .	St
1.1.7	It was as though Windows xp had decided it could do a better job of running a wireless newtwork than D-Link configuration could .	St
1.1.8	Much to my surprise , the wireless network still works -- sort of .	St
1.1.9	Every 10 to 60 seconds , a balloon pops up in the system tray of my notebook telling me a network cable is unplugged , but it is n't .	St
1.1.10	The system instantly reconnects itself and I can carry on surfing the internet .	St
1.1.11	My internet phone which I use for long distance calls and my Live365 radio , both of which I have used for years without problems , disconnect each time the balloon comes up -- but these two applications will not automatically reconnect as the internet will .	St
1.1.12	So , I can not use my PCPhone or listen to internet radio anymore .	St
1.1.13	The strangest of all is that yesterday , I had a whole day of no balloons or dropped signals .	St
1.1.14	Everything worked perfectly .	St
1.1.15	I listened to the radio and made several VOIP calls .	St
1.1.16	The days before I had problems .	St
