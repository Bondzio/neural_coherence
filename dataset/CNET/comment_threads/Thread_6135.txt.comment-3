For reasons I won't go into-my workplace had a WD 1200JD (?)
8mb buffer drive they wanted converted back to Fat23 from ntfs,(GRRR) It resisted several efforts but what finally worked was to get a W98se boot disk, (bootdisk.com) make the disk, and also find and put on the disk &quot;DELPART&quot;, so that once I booted with the floppy-( the WD I was working on connected as only Hd-Primary master) I could type delpart at the A:\ prompt,( the usual message from the boot disk about there being no drive present)then rebooted, floppy again- then Fdisk, make whole drive primary and active, even though the W98 fdisk lists the total space incorrectly,then rebooted with floppy again and formatted-took ages, but it's what finally worked-then put it as primary slave in a computer with XPpro which we have left as Fat32, XPpro sees complete drive, then used Partition Magic 9 to gradually break into 30ish partitions -one at a time-reboot each time.. and it finally worked all the way thru-now I can,if need be, make any of them into NTFS, or not// whatever they decide....I may have been able to leave out a reboot here and there-but this had made me so crazy I decided to go for the smallest verifiable steps and reboot..
