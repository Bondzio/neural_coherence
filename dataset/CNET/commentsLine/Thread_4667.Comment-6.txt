you said you have about 140 so get the geforce 6600gt from newegg.
you will not regret it unless your'e looking forward to playing games with 1434 fps with outstainding ultra maximum anti aliasing.
oh and make sure your power supply is good.
i've heard people say not enough power supply and the old power supply might die.
