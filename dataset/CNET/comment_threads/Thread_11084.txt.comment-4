Some get bulk CDRs and run into a bad batch.
For instance I get a bad batch and the CDR needed help since the ATIP information called the CDR 40X but the speed was really 16X.
Nero allowed me to set the record speed to 16X and the CDR was usable.
I felt this was OK for me, but not for others.
If you want to know about ATIP and more, type CDR FAQ into google.com Bob
