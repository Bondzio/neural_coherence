If the CD drive is shown in Device Manager, then there is another problem. Google for a fix or look in these forums, as there are many with the symptom lately. As for the audio controller, we need some additional information as to where you should go from here. What is your computer make, model #, and OS? You mention HP, so one assumes this is an HP product.
