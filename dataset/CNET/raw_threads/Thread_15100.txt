What is better? Quad Core or Dual Core? IF I buy a dual core to overclock(my friend has done it, I'm a pure nub) what should I get and how much should I overclock?(Running on air) Exactly how fast would a 2.4 overclocked to 3 ghz dual core run? how does it compare to a 3 overclocked to 3.5 ghz? Are there possibly any releases in the near-future that would greatly affect the performance or price of cpus? Please Answer the Questions... Thanks A Lot!!!

Not being rude but, those people will know exactly what you need. Hmmm. If you need something that will require a lot of CPU power, then go for the quad/double-dual core systems. Go ask in a gaming forum about graphics cards. Again, not being rude, just saying that they will know better than anyone here.
