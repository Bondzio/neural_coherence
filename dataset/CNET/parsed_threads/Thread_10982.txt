<s> My computer is a Dell E510 desktop. </s>
<s> I bought a SATA controller card and the driver is an up-to-date &quot;Silicon Image Sil 3132 SATALink Controller&quot; I have an internal LG DVD R/W drive attached to one of the two SATA ports on this controller and it works fine. </s>
<s> I have a cheap Calvary CAUA37250 external hard drive that runs fine with a USB cable. </s>
<s> Since it also has a SATA port I thought I would connect it to the Controller with an ESATA cable. </s>
<s> Well, the drive doesn't show up in Disk Management or on the Silicon Image BIOS screen on start-up. </s>
<s> Calvary Support says: &quot;My drive works fine when I connect it via USB to my computer; however, when I connect the eSATA bracket to my computer and connect the drive, my computer does not recognize it. </s>
<s> Please try the following: 1. </s>
<s> Shut down both your computer and your Cavalry product. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Plug your unit in using the eSATA interface and turn it on. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Turn on your computer. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Windows should automatically detect your unit. </s>
<s> If Windows does not recognize it, please go to Disk Management. </s>
<s> Right-click My Computer and select Manage. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Once the window is open, select Disk Management. </s>
<s> Your unit should show up on the right. </s>
<s> Select the box, and right-click. </s>
<s> Assign a drive letter and your unit should be ready to go.Note that not all eSATA ports are Plug & Play compatible. </s>
<s> This depends on your computer's hardware, not Cavalry hardware.&quot; Well, that isn't much help! </s>
<s> I am tired of searching with Google for answers and decided to post this to see if anyone had a suggestion. </s>
<s> I suspect this drive just doesn't work with a SATA connection. </s>
<s> you could have a faulty cable or connection in your external box. </s>
<s> I use the same controller card with 2 Welland cases and off the shelf WD hard drives a 160gig about 3 years old and 1 year old 640gig without any problems. </s>
<s> The last Welland case cost me about $43 Australian, probably about $25-30 US. </s>
<s> I bought the Calvary drive at Newegg and the reviews there are not very positive. </s>
<s> I can't tell if any of the reviewers used the SATA port. </s>
<s> I just turned on my computer with the Calvary drive attached to the mother board SATA port and my second hard drive attached to the controller card. </s>
<s> The controller card runs both my DVD drive and hard drive just fine. </s>
<s> The Calvary drive is still not recognized by the computer. </s>
<s> I will have to decide if I want to spend the money for another ESATA cable or just run the drive via USB. </s>
<s> I did a pin-to-pin continuity check (which is difficult to do)on the cable and it didn't check out correctly. </s>
<s> I bought a new cable at my local electronics parts store and the Cavalry drive works fine. </s>
<s> I use the Cavalry drive for backups. </s>
<s> Acronis True Image backup runs faster with the SATA configuration...as it should. </s>
