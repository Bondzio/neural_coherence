when i put the dvd in auto run starts and a window opens and wants to know what program i want to use.
i chose windows media player.
another window opens and says '' windows media player cannot play the dvd because a compatible dvd decoder is not installed on your computer''.
there are two buttons under that one is ''close'' and the other is ''web help''.
web help takes me to a site to buy a plug in.
is that what i need or is there something else?
