<s> hi... i have AMD 2000+ &quot;PVCLE266M-L&quot; i want to make it fast so wat should i do, like what should be added to it for egs ram, some PCI accesories, etc </s>
<s> Add system RAM, a hard drive, a video card, a PSU, and an operating system and it should work. </s>
<s> Not what you were expecting? </s>
<s> That's because we have no idea what you already have installed on that motherboard besides an &quot;AMD 2000+&quot; CPU. </s>
<s> i have 512+256mb ram 40gb hdd, and this PVCLE266-m is a mercury motherboard and processor (builtin processor) so what changes can i do, i have windows XP and Windows 2000, and windows 2000 is extremely fast and win Xp is like below average, so wat should i do to make XP fast, other than diskdefragment,etc only components </s>
<s> In terms of hardware upgrades, probably adding a PCI (not PCI Express) video card with its own dedicated (not shared) video memory will provide the best performance boost. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, new Core 2 Duo and Athlon 64 X2 systems are a steal right now. </s>
<s> I'd lean towards investing in a new computer. </s>
