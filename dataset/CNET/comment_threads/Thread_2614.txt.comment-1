I was in safe mode doing some trouble shooting with Hewlett Packard.
Anyways the girl on the phone told me to jsut restart my computer and everything should be back to normal well it isn't.
I am using windows vista and well the taskbar looks like the old grey taskbar you'd get with the older windows and the sidebar is all grey as oppose to the taskbar being balck and the new look for vista.
What's the heck happened?
how can i fix this and put it back to normal?
And believe me I've tried going back on the pc and putting back to &quot;windows normally&quot; or put back to &quot;configure original&quot; or something like that.
thanks.
