1.1.1	My Eeepc 1000HA has a 160 GB SATA Hd , an Atom N-270 , 2 GB DDR2 .	St
1.1.2	Is it worth the trouble to replace the HD with an SSD ( I have a USB adapter to use to clone it ) now that some 80GB -120GB SSDs are down to & lt ; $ 110 ?	Ques
1.1.3	This HD is partitioned with C : = ~80GB and D : = ~60GB-Used space = 1 % ( used space never grows for D : ) .	St
1.1.4	What is this D ; drive all about , recovery ?	Ques
1.1.5	It 's awful big for that function .	St
1.1.6	For the SSD ( 80GB for example ) hoiw big should I make the D : drive ?	Ques
1.2.1	But you would never be sure if the OS was installed to support the TRIM or other functions so it 's life span may be a little shorter .	St
1.2.2	Please google about SSD TRIM functions .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	It ; s running Windows XP SP3 with all the updates available .	St
1.3.2	I 'm guessing from your reply that it won ; t likely support TRIM .	St
1.4.1	XP as far as I 've found does not support this .	St
1.4.2	Sure , YOUR MONEY , your choice .	St
1.4.3	Did you consider a HYBRID DRIVE since it will get you the speed without that issue ?	Ques
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Sounds interesting but the smallest capacity drive I 've seen is The Seagate Momentus 500GB drive .	St
1.5.2	That seems pretty large for a machine that has only consumed 27 % of it 's 82GB C : partition in 3 years .	St
1.5.3	I 'll check it out further though .	St
1.5.4	That adaptive firmware sounds pretty cool .	Polite
1.6.1	Updated , faster .	St
1.6.2	I have a pair of the 500GB and in about a month may change to the 750. Review at http : //www.anandtech.com/show/5160/seagate-2nd-generation-momentus-xt-750gb-hybrid-hdd-review This is not so much about space but speed without as much of the worry .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Am I correct in assuming a simple cloning to a Momentus XT would give me a direct functional physical replacement for my EeePCs HDD ?	Ques
1.7.2	Is there any problem with XP home 32 bit addressing a 750GB HDD ?	Ques
1.7.3	I know there 's a RAM address-ability limit of 4GB .	St
1.8.1	My bet is you do n't have XP but XP Sp1 , Sp2 or Sp3 .	St
1.9.1	I stated that assuming some universality since the update to it has always been free .	St
1.9.2	Does SP2 or SP 3 correct that HDD size problem ?	Ques
1.9.3	Might that be part of the reason for Asus establishing such a large D : partition on my Eee PC ?	Ques
1.9.4	What about physical drive size , can it be overcome via multi-partitioning ?	Ques
1.10.1	But the issue was first corrected in XP SP1 so you wo n't have to deal with that issue in any way at all .	St
1.10.2	Bob	St
1.11.1	... but to answer your question about the D : partition : For some odd reason , Asus splits the hard drives in their netbooks into 2 similar sized partitions .	St
1.11.2	There is a third , hidden , and much smaller partition used for system recovery .	St
1.11.3	You can use something like EASEUS Partition Manager to change the size and number of partitions on a drive .	St
