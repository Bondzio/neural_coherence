if you want absolute savings then yes... u could use a flash drive instead of a loppy so im not worried.
the card reader you can get from microcenter for 12 bucks if you wana use an sd card instead for updating bios.. i did forget OS but updated so wif vista ultimate its 2988.88 bucks my wireless mouse lasts about a mounth in battery life.
the unique scrolling mechinism would help too.
ur right about the keyboard being expencive(i use a 30$ microsoft media keyboard that types just as nicely), but for gaming the other keyboard has amo count, and some usefull keys lieing around.
have fun....
