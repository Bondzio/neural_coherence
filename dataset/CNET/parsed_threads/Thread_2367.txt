<s> Hi I am interested in purchasing a netbook. </s>
<s> I am a medical professional that travels overseas often to give presentations on various topics. </s>
<s> Would a netbook be powerful enough to run Microsoft Powerpoint? </s>
<s> Would the connection be compatible with every projector? </s>
<s> Are there any netbook specifications (amount of RAM\CPU etc) that would be optimal for my needs? </s>
<s> Are there any specific netbooks that you can recommend? </s>
<s> Thanks Rael </s>
<s> Our office has no less than 3 netbooks. </s>
<s> All have run our powerpoints fine. </s>
<s> HOWEVER none have embedded videos so this is why it works. </s>
<s> Would the connection be compatible with every projector? </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> I've yet to find this to be true since it never fails that you will find one projector that has DVI and laptops don't have that. </s>

<s> I use my Toshiba netbook all the time showing Microsoft Powerpoint presentations. </s>
<s> AND some of those even have linked video files, which play fine. </s>
<s> When connecting to a projector, I have found that netbook running Windows 7 starter edition syncs with the project without a hitch. </s>
<s> I do these presentations on the road a lot, and being able to just carry the lighter weight netbook is great. </s>
<s> Also, the 7+ hours battery life means that I don't need to plug in the netbook's power cord. </s>
<s> Much nicer set up than even my 13&quot; laptop. </s>
<s> PowerPoint works great on some netbooks, though I would get one that can hold at least 2 GB of RAM. </s>
<s> since running the software taxes the netbook more than projecting. </s>
<s> The only power required to project is enough to send a signal to the projector or TV monitor. </s>
<s> Nearly all netbooks have a VGA (15 pin) port which connects fine to either. </s>
<s> I got an Asus 1005PE in April 2010 and am impressed as can be. </s>
<s> I've loaded MS Office Pro, Acrobat Pro, Quicken Premium and Google Earth with no problems. </s>
<s> The weight and 11 hour battery life makes it great to travel and give presentations. </s>
