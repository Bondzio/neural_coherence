I've done some research about this online, but I'm still not sure exactly what I need. The apartment I'm moving into this summer already has wireless access via another person in the building, so I guess this works the same way as a wireless hotspot. I'm just not entirely sure what hardware/software I need for my computer to be able to access the network. I have a dell dimension desktop 4500 that's about 3 years old. A friend told me to get netgear's wireless pc card, something like the WG511. Will installing this card allow me to access the wireless network? If not, what would I need to buy? Thanks for any help.

After rereading my original post, I realize it could seem like I'm stealing someone's wireless connection. I'm going to be chipping in for whatever fees are involved. I was simply trying to explain the situation so that anyone who read my question would understand that I'm not directly involved in the set up process and so can't answer any specific questions regarding the setup. In any case, and whether you believe me or not, thank you for your response.
