recently i purchased an enclosure for a 3.5&quot; 120gb seagate hard drive which was slave in my desktop.
after installing the hdd in the enclosure, plugging it into my laptop, and turning it on, i could hear the disk spinning, but the light on the enclosure didn't come on and the pc showed no signs of recognition.
i tried all usb ports, turning the hdd on and off, restarting the computer.
the hdd only contains folders of pictures and mp3 files, and both machines use xp home.
am i missing something, or is something faulty?
thanks for your help in advance.
