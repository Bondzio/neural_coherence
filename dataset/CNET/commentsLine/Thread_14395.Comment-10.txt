you know, thinking back, i had this router with the current configuration, using a winxp laptop with a netgear card.
i never, ever had a problem with the connection.
it only happened when i upgraded to a new laptop with vista home premium with an internal realtek g network adapter.
hmmm..... well, thank you very much for the print server suggestion.
i see it is oos, so i'll have a look around and see if i can find it any place else.
but, for the dell 3100n laser, (which is network capable), can i just plug it into a router port (using sticky 17 setup)with an ethernet cable and assign it an ip address somehow?
then i would only need 1 print server, i think?
thanks!
