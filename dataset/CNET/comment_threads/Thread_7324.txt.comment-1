I was all set on getting the 6250 emachine when i called dell to see what they would do.
They claim they can give me a similarly configured 4700 (i know they say its not sold anymore and they did not mentioned it was refurbished) for $100 more than the emachine.
The only real difference is the Hard drive 160 dell vs. 200 emachine.
Anyone have any thoughts?
