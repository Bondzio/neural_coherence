<s> Hello, Can anyone tell me how to easily back up (make a copy for safekeeping or future use) emails from Outlook Express? </s>
<s> I don't know where they are stored exactly, so even though I regularly make backups of my important files, I have lost important emails in the past after a hard disk failure. </s>
<s> And, how do I reactivate that file later on, after installing a new hard disk and reinstalling MSOffice for example? </s>
<s> How do I get the back-up email file to be accessible in my Inbox? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help. </s>
<s> While this is a hardware forum the answer is in Microsoft articles I find at google.com with these two words. </s>
<s> OLEXP BACKUP Bob </s>
