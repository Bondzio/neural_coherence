1.1.1	Hello , I 'm looking to know what the upgrade capabilities are on a Dell Dimension 3000 .	St
1.1.2	It 's like a 5 year old computer and I just upgraded to Windows 7 but here are my questions : -Largest Hard Drive ( Hard Drive Size Not that Important , more Important is RPMs ) -How Much RAM Can I put in this ( I want 6 Gigs or More ) -What Kind of Dedicated Graphics Card -Upgrade Processor Let me know .	St
1.1.3	My I 'm a web developer & amp ; my website is Current Century Media if I ca n't upgrade this system much I 'll just continue to use it for Microsoft Office/Notepad Editors/XAMMP I also plan on buying a Lenovo IdeaPad U410 from the Windows Store ... is this a good buy or not .	St
1.1.4	I want to start working with Illustrator & amp ; In-Design .	St
1.1.5	Thanks , Ted Cacciola Current Century Media	St
1.2.1	I went to look but came away with what must be 100+ models in that line up .	St
1.2.2	Also , there appear to be some prior discussions on upgrading various Dells .	St
1.2.3	But without a specific model , no one can be specific .	St
1.2.4	As to RAM , use crucial.com .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Dell stopped driver support for that machine at XP .	St
1.3.2	If you installed W7 I suspect your running windows generic drivers ... ..not good for perf .	St
1.3.3	Crucial says 2GB max ram .	St
1.3.4	That 's ok for XP ... ... .not so good for W7 .	St
1.4.1	You need to visit the Dell support website and using your service tag # , enter it and find the exact details of what your PC was build as .	St
1.4.2	Then find any upgrades that Dell provides , but you need n't buy from them , buy similar from other vendors .	St
1.4.3	However , IMHO , you should chuck this PC if you really want this for some business as it already too dated and any upgrades wo n't really make it a swift or real dependable PC , it has to work real hard to keep up and/or become stressed .	St
1.4.4	Check your local Craigslist and find out what that PC is going for and then check what others are selling that maybe more upgradeable and/or simply better to begin with .	St
1.4.5	In other words put you possible upgrade funds to better use on a newer PC .	St
1.4.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
