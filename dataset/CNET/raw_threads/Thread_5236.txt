It is being hooked up to our network in the office which uses Windows NT 4.0 on the server. All the workstations are Windows 98SE. We use a D link router and a cable modem. Thanks

For instance if your IP PLAN is 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254 then you pick one of those unused numbers. You'll also want to copy the DNS, Default Gateway and Netmask. Nothing in your post reveals your IP PLAN. Bob

That's what you'll need to figure out, how (on your DVR) you can access a setup page to set a static ip. For a temporary fix, if you have other computers on your network, give them all static IPs. Then tell your router to only give out 1 ip for the dhcp network, and your dvr will always have the same IP. For instance, set your IP range for the DHCP to 192.168.1.2 - 192.168.1.2
