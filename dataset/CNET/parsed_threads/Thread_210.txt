<s> I have an iMac with a 2.4 GHZ Intel Core 2 Duo running OS 10.6.2 that I wish to set up in a local Firewire network with a Mac G4 Power PC Processor 867 running OS 10.5.8. </s>
<s> The Firewire is securely attached to both computers, I have carefully followed the first directions in the &quot;Help&quot;, In the &quot;Assist Me &quot; boxes and in Pogue's &quot;Missing Manual for Leopard&quot;, but neither machine responds with the same dialogue boxes as I was led to expect from any of the directions. </s>
<s> I would be VERY thankful if someone would help me (with detaiis, please) set up this network and connect it to the internet </s>
<s> But when that fails I go back to Ethernet. </s>
<s> Try that. </s>
<s> R. Profitt, huh? </s>
<s> The firewire networking failed. </s>
<s> Let's go back to Ethernet networking. </s>
