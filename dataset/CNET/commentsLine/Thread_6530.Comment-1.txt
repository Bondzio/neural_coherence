hi, i'm new here and not too network-savvy.
i'm trying to go wireless with a desktop pc running windows xp sp2.
i've got a 2wire router which works fine when plugged into the computer via an ethernet cable.
i purchased a netgear n300 wireless usb adapter and installed it - it seems to be working fine.
the trouble is that my wireless connection shows &quot;limited or no connectivity,&quot; although the signal strength is &quot;very good.&quot; when i try to repair the connection, it tells me that i could not be assigned an ip address.
at the moment i'm working via the ethernet cable with no difficulty.
can someone suggest a reason why the wired connection works but the wireless (from the same router) doesn't, even though it should?
thanks in advance for any help!
