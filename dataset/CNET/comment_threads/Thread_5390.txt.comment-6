I solved my problem of upgrading my PSU, Bigger case!
After going to Tom's Hardware and doing research there about the video card I want, I seriously started thinking of just getting a different case.
I don't know why I balked at that.
Since I'm self taught about working with my pc thanks to the excellent forums and websites on the net, that was just one area I overlooked.
Don't know why,When that is such a simple why to go, because my case is a pain.
Any video card I did get would have to be smaller physically to fit inside,(which I forgot to mention) so problem solved!
Why is it sometimes the simplest things never cross our minds?
Thank you for the help, Faerie
