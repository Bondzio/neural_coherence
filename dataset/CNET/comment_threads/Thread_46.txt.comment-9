I have followed your information pc-to-pc connection with cat-5 cable LAN.
The cable is ok sincce I have a cable tester.
I am using Windows XP p2 I have configured the IP addesses and connected two computers with a cross wire.
192.168.0.1 (dell8300) 192.168.0.2 (dell3000) When the computers are switched on the Local Area Connection icon on the tool bar status becomes connected but I can not see the other computer.
I have tried to ping other computer but no avail.
Is there something else I need to do?
I wouls appreciate for your help kthy2003
