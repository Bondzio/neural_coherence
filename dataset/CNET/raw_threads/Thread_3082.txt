Does the the dvi port support: a) component b) DVI-I RGB? If yes to a) and/or b): The tv is old, 10 years or more. It has 2 scart ports. How do I determine whether the scart ports support a) component b) DVI-I RGB? Thanks.

I don't want to know whether the tv can be a replacement for a computer monitor. From an older computer that had tv out, I know that the reso- lution supported, is to low for that purpose. But for watching movies and videos is was sufficient (800x600). And that is my question, can I use the dvi port to connect to the tv scart port, and by that obtain the above purpose. Still thanks for your effort.

A quick search finds no such cable which verifies that you'll have to stick with known solutions like S video to SCART. Bob
