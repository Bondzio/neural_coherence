1.1.1	I do n't know why this is happening , it used to be that my cpu was always hotter until I cleaned the inside of my computer and removed all the dust .	St
1.1.2	After that my Hard Drive is usually 10-15 degrees celcius hotter than my cpu .	St
1.1.3	After a while of usuage my computer will automatically shut down .	St

1.3.1	I cleaned the inside first then I used the SMART feature in speedfan .	St
1.3.2	( IMPORTANT : NOTE THAT , I 'VE JUST STARTED MY COMPUTER AND USED SPEEDFAN , MY COMPUTER WILL FUTHER INCREASE IN TEMP .	St
1.3.3	AFTER TIME ) Your hard disk is a MAXTOR 6L080J4 with firmware A93.0500 .	St
1.3.4	The average temperature for this hard disk is 43C ( MIN=30C MAX=56C ) and yours is 48C .	St

1.7.1	SpeedFan is pretty reliable , but as with all sensor programs , there are sometimes errors .	St
1.7.2	That 127*C is 260*F , yeow ! ! !	St
1.7.3	Try : Everest Home Edition ( may not work on very new hardware ) PC Wizard ( cpuid.com ) SANDRA Lite ( Download.com )	St
1.8.1	actually I am just trying to cool down the hard drive .	St
1.8.2	I think that there might be something wrong with it ( I keep hearing this sound ( sounds like one of those machincal saws people use to cut wood ) .	St
1.8.3	I checked with Asus Probe - I got 29C for cpu and 44C for HD .	St
1.8.4	I also checked all the fans and the sound does n't seem to be coming from them .	St
1.8.5	Is it possible that the sound is coming from the hard drive , if so what should I do ?	Ques
1.8.6	My computer is new ( 1 year ) and should I contact Asus ?	Ques
1.9.1	Many now are rated only to 45C ( used to be 50C . )	St
1.9.2	I 'd leave the cover off to help the heat get out till you figure out why the case fans are not working .	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	I checked the fans , they 're working perfectly , besides my cpu is not hot at all ( 29C )	St
1.11.1	You 'll still want to cure the hot hot hot hard disk before it decides to melt and take what you did n't backup .	St
1.11.2	Let me be blunt .	St
1.11.3	Heat is bad .	Polite
1.11.4	Bob	St
1.12.1	Are there any case fans blowing over the HD ?	Ques
1.12.2	If the HD 's are up front , sometimes you have to purchase and install a front case fan for the HD .	St
1.12.3	There are other solutions as well , but it depends on the particulars of your case .	St
1.12.4	Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and modify your case or get a better one .	St
1.13.1	I am pretty sure that I wo n't need to add any more fans to my noisy computer .	St
1.13.2	Also this problem just started 3 weeks ago after the strange noises began appearing .	St
1.13.3	Before then my computer was fine , the HD was always 30C or so .	St
1.14.1	You can have success in cooling a computer system with many or few fans , but that is not the issue here .	St
1.14.2	I repeat : Do you have a fan that blows over the hard drive ?	Ques
1.14.3	This is usually the front intake fan .	St
1.14.4	Many cases have a place for that fan , but mfgs .	St
1.14.5	do not install one there .	St
1.14.6	ASIDE : You can get larger and quieter fans to take care of your noise problem .	St
1.15.1	Check to see if the drive is functioning properly with the PowerMax utility from Maxtor.com .	St
1.16.1	to a location where it can dissipate heat OR add a fan directly infront of or on top of the HDD to reduce the heat .	St
1.16.2	Many if not not most PCs have fans at the bottom front of the case to induct cool air and move it directly over the internal HDDs .	St
1.16.3	There are lots of choices for case fans with different CFM and noise ratings ... ..with and wihtout temp and speed controls .	St
1.16.4	I was running SpinRite one day and noted the HDD temp .	St
1.16.5	Just for the heck of it I connected an 80MM case fan to blow air over it .	St
1.16.6	It was interesting to see how quickly the temp dropped .	St
1.17.1	I do not have a intake fan on the front of the computer ( have those open slots for air flow ) but I am sure the problem is not the fans because before my computer was working perfectly .	St
1.17.2	Also I changed the position of the HD so that there would be more air flow but there was n't a big difference ( about 1C lower sometimes ) .	St
1.17.3	I am using power max right now to check my HD , I 'll post the results in a couple of minutes .	St
1.17.4	thanks again for your help	Polite
1.18.1	fans and system cooling is ...	St
1.18.2	I 've never bought a case that did n't have at least 1 fan located at the front of the case .	St
1.18.3	One case I have has 3 80mm fans .. one at the very bottom front of the case and two more located at the front of the two drive cages .	St
1.18.4	And if get a chance look at some of the better cases ... they all have fans located at the lower front of the case..check Lian Li VAPCMD	St
1.19.1	A friend of mine was having problems with his computer , so I stopped by his place yesterday to look at it .	St
1.19.2	He told me that he turned it on , and there was nothing on the monitor , and the activity light was not flashing at all .	St
1.19.3	The hardware was working fine though ( Fans turning , DVD drive opens and closes , etc . ) .	St
1.19.4	When I stopped at his house to look at it , it was working fine .	St
1.19.5	I decided to update his video card driver , and make a few tweaks while I was there .	St
1.19.6	After about an hour or so , I restarted the computer and it showed the previously mentioned symptoms .	St
1.19.7	I reach in and touched the bay holding his hard drive , and it was effin ' toasty .	St
1.19.8	I told him I 'll swing by with an extra fan or 3 and we 'll pop those babies in .	St
1.19.9	I 'll let you know how that works out .	St
1.19.10	Unfortunately , if it was working fine before , and now it 's overheating , I think the drive is on it 's death bed .	St
1.19.11	I say back everything up now .	St
1.19.12	A few fans might delay the innevitable , but it 's not going to keep it alive forever .	Sug
1.19.13	I 'd back everything up and prepare to buy a new hard drive .	St
1.19.14	These other people can keep recommending software to monitor the drive all day , but if you know it 's hot , you do n't need a program to tell you what you already know .	St
1.20.1	did I mention that my computer was only 1 YEARS OLD ! ! !	St
1.20.2	I still have warrenty on my Hard Drive , 3 year warrenty	St
1.21.1	How much do you think I can sell my computer for ( computer works fine in a room under 23C ) .	St
1.22.1	For pricing , search ''Completed listings '' on eBay.com for similarly configured computers .	St
1.22.2	Personally , I would try the largest fan that fits the front intake before giving up .	St
1.22.3	This can be done for under $ 10USD .	St
1.22.4	Much cheaper than a new computer .	St
1.22.5	I have a P4 3.0GHz ( Northwood ) in a mid-tower case ( Antec SLK3700-BQE ) .	St
1.22.6	It has a 120mm rear exhaust fan and a 120mm front intake fan that blows over three HD .	St
1.22.7	The only other exhaust fan is in the PSU .	St
1.22.8	Each HD is below 40C .	St
