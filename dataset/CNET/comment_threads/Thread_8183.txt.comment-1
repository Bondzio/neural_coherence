Accompanying screenshot: http://www.imagedump.com/index.cgi?..._id=20&warned=y After my driver woes, I discovered that the MSI app that controls my GPU(s) doesn't work anymore.
It displays clearly false information (check the amount of ram it claims I have ) and I cannot tick the PCIEx16 box, or any others for that matter.
They aren't greyed out, but clicking them won't tick the box nor make any other changes.
I no longer have this program, I searched MSI's site but cannot find it on there either.
I have no idea how to tell if my PCIEx16 is actually being used or that my slowdowns are originating from exactly that problem.
