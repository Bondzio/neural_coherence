I think your going to spend a bunch of bucks and not get much.
920&gt;3570......there will be a bump in cpu perf....as to how that will xlate to some game.....unknown.
I doubt it will much.
W7&gt;W8......No......Let the dust settle with W8.
Get enough ram that the swap file stays quiet while your gaming.
If your games are hammering your HD for data......think about a SSD or a hybrid.
