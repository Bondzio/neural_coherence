Actually I just watched Tom Merritt talk about this App that led to my posting this question (something that has been bugging me since people have been bringing up having a camera for the IPad and stating that this is a bad thing on the part of Apple for not including it).
I am not looking for a APP that does this.
I am asking why would you want to do this using the IPad (it's dimensions make it impractical to use as a camera)?
I stated my logic for this question is the previous posting.
I am really curious for the reasoning people have for wanting a camera for the IPad (I mean a camera in the back of the device, not a web-cam [like I said earlier that makes sense]).
