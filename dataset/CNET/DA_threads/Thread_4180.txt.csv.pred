1.1.1	I am using a Dell 46000 computer ( 4-5 years old ) with Windows XP Professional .	St
1.1.2	My graphics card is an NVIDIA GE Force FX 5200 .	St
1.1.3	Several days ago I bought a new monitor - an LG W2061TQ , 16:9 monitor .	St
1.1.4	I set the resolution in my Control Panel & gt ; Display & gt ; Settings to 1600X900 , the highest setting available there .	St
1.1.5	The problem : As soon as I boot my computer , instead of the typical , initial screen appearing ( typically for a few seconds ) which shows the keys to press to enter the BIOS , and other preliminary screens then appearing , a little error message box appears with the following : & quot ; Digital out of range - 74.3kHZ/60Hz. & quot ; Then the Windows & quot ; Welcome & quot ; screen appears and looks fine .	St
1.1.6	Once my computer finishes booting , my desktop screen also looks fine .	St
1.1.7	1 ) What does this error message mean and what can I do to eliminate it ?	Ques
1.1.8	2 ) Even with this error message appearing when the bootup process starts , do I still have access to the BIOS if I press the correct keys to access it when the bootup process starts ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks .	Polite

1.2.1	I have an old machine with the FX500 which is close enough to that 5200 to discuss .	St
1.2.2	It does n't produce the right video output for my new big screen and I see that message and others when I try .	St
1.2.3	To fix this I 've ordered up a newer card .	St
1.2.4	I bet there are some that will think some driver will help .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	FYI- More than likely its the monitor generating that message rather than the video card .	St
1.3.2	So nothing you can do if the FX5200 is just too old or ca n't provide a matching setting for best performance .	St
1.3.3	If it continues to display the message but yet works , then be happy .	St
1.3.4	Because , the only real solution is to replace the video card to a later model .	St

1.4.1	Even with this error message appearing when the bootup process starts , should I still have access to the BIOS if I press the correct keys to access it when the bootup process starts ?	Ques
1.4.2	I wanted to ask before I try it and potentially screw something up .	St
1.4.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.5.1	I lucked out and a 25 buck ATI 9600 card has cured this old machine .	St
1.5.2	And the new card kicks the old card 's gas .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	With the system-OFF , power-ON the monitor it may generate a message like & quot ; no signal detected & quot ; or similar .	St
1.6.2	That 's why i mentioned the monitor generates some messages .	St
1.6.3	Now , when you access the bios that will be a basic video setting/level which any video card will be capable of handling .	St
1.6.4	If for some reason , it ca n't display the bios display then you have other issues .	St
1.6.5	You should then check the monitor int .	Sug
1.6.6	setting ( on-screen diags . )	St
1.6.7	and see what 's being done .	St
1.6.8	If all this gets too involved or becomes such a hassle , again the best course is to replace the video card to newer one .	St
1.6.9	FYI- If you monitor came with a install CD , read the manual .	St
1.6.10	Any s/w , install it for a possible better marriage of video port and monitor .	St
