As has been said, Pentium D is the dual core rendition of the Pentium 4, using the Smithfield and Presler cores, while Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Quad are P6 derived and much more efficient in terms of FP performance and memory efficiency, which increases overall performance. The advantage to multi-core CPUs is the ability for the CPU to do more than one thing at a time, which increases system performance (it is not 2.0x, or anywhere near 2.0x), and allows more complex calculations to be completed, which means a quad core can do more than a dual core, however this ability to do more won't usually manifest performance increases in situations where it can't be utilized (just because you have a Ferrari doesn't mean your daily drive is any shorter).
