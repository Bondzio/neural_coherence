we rarely use an outside the cab solution as that would have the installer drill holes and more.
the simple bluetooth gps units we used are on amazon.com and sit somewhere inside the cab and get power from almost anywhere.
the power draw is very low.
are you writing you use your laptop outside the cab area?
isn't that a bit hard to drive in winter?
