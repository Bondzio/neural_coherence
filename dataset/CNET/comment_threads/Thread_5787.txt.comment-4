But writing a tutorial on benchmarks in one paragraph and doing it justice is not possible.
It's a shame that the PC has no make or model but I will part with this.
Gamers are a finicky lot and won't be happy with this.

The ones that jump from PC to PC or change cards to get a few more FPS.
You often hear them use the word lag in less than 5 minutes.
It's a great system noted there and games should be fine for that GPU.
