My understanding of the description -- Not getting to BIOS at all, i.e.
failing to POST even.
If that's true, then the problem is hardware, not the OS.
Strip down (unplug everything except 1 stick of ram, cpu, psu, and video) and test the usual culprits.
If needed, the motherboard should have a couple pins you jumper together to reset the CMOS or something similar to get back to default BIOS.
No disrespect intended, but might get better help from a forum in one's native language.
