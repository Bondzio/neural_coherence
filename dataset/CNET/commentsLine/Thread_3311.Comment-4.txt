well the reason i was only going to go 512 now was to let the price drop a bit more then go up more.
originally i was looking at a gig or so of 533 but scaled that back also, let's say i did go with an amd 64, would the dual proc fit into the same 754 socket?
plus from what i've seen of amd boards the fsb isnt as easily defined as on intel comp boards.
i've seen some that list the fsb in mhz but for the most part they dont.
so win longhorn; should i go with me or xp home til then than upgrade or xp pro as i had planned?
what's new in it?
heard of it but not about it.
i'm not trying to build a cutting edge machine or even update it to that for that matter, but i'm looking to be just behind the curve in most places.
thing with comps though is that a year from now theres always going to be lots of new stuff.
if i wait til next year then there's going to be more new stuff to wait for.
then the hd.
could i use a 10k rpm as primary for my os and office apps then use a 7.2k rpm for my gaming use and media file storage?
part of my caution about dropping too much over 1500 or so is that i have other things that i want to get too and i've got very limited resources as i'm a college student.
