advice for jose: be cautious about the power supply and motherboard of the computer that you buy if you plan to upgrade the graphics card.
the integrated graphics in some systems can't be upgraded due to motherboard or power supply limitations.
a computer that has a 450w to 500w power supply and an already installed graphics card is the best bet if you plan to upgrade the graphics card later.
