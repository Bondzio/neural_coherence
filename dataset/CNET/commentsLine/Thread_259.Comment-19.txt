i was reading the site you listed in your message before this one.
i have and use both nero and roxio, but i had come up on sonic as i read thru my software and was trying to uninstall it.
the help site you listed suggested i uninstall all such software, and i'm in the process of doing what the site recommends.
i'm going to continue that and i'll get back to you when i've finished.
you and it have too many suggestions for me to do at the same time.
i don't know what most of the information you provide below means.
i have to do this one step at a time.
