Thanks for your help!
It turns out after all of that, I didn't even have the cable with me to connect the two machines.
So...
I just ended up transferring things via my jump drive.
Thank you for the information, though, because it was something I had been wondering about, anyway.
It ended up taking me another 4 hours to get it up and running, but that is mostly because I had to download things over a dial-up connection.
Anyway, if you want to hear all the gory details about it, you can read about it on my other post: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7584-0.html?forumID=63&threadID=61372&messageID=742320 Thanks again!
