1.1.1	This could start a war but it is n't meant to .	St
1.1.2	Just like automobile brands are known for their particular strengths ( or weaknesses ) , what about hard disk drive manufacturers ?	Ques
1.1.3	For example is one brand of hard drives more famous for reliability than , say , speed ?	Ques
1.1.4	Is another brand better known for its speed but maybe priced too high ?	Ques
1.1.5	What 's the conventional wisdom of those here who have worked with and know many of the various HDD brands ?	Ques
1.2.1	Remember that any retail drive is a 5 year proposal .	St
1.2.2	If you want best , you will not find it at retail .	St
1.2.3	Look to EMC , IBM , HP , SUN and even DELL for their drive array solutions .	St
1.2.4	Bring a suitcase of money ... Bob	St
1.3.1	I found it .	St
1.3.2	The answer ( s ) to my question are in this very forum under the thread & quot ; Hard Disk Drives : Is there a clear Leader ? ?	Ques
1.3.3	? & quot ; ( 11/04/04 ) & lt ; http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7588-0.html ? forumID=70 & threadID=43920 & messageID=516939 & gt ; .	St
1.3.4	The conventional wisdom of the thread 's 47 posts seems to say Seagate , Maxtor , and Western Digital all both terrific and crappy at the same time .	St
1.3.5	However , it does seem that Maxtor was rapped more than lauded .	St
1.3.6	Western Digital has almost equal supporters and detractors .	St
1.3.7	Little is said about Seagate .	St
1.3.8	However , if warranty is a reflection of the manufacturer 's belief in its own product , then I guess Seagate must know something the others do n't with its recent 5 year warranty .	St
1.3.9	Yes ?	Ques
1.3.10	I guess it remains that & quot ; you pay your money and you take your chances & quot ; & lt ; grin & gt ; .	St
1.4.1	They 've not been around that long to prove it but neither have the Seagates .	St
1.4.2	I have a mix of Seagate and WDs ( plus a few surviving IBMs ) .	St
1.4.3	I use the WD Raptors as primary drives .	St
1.4.4	These are not yet at the capacity of the others but run at 10000 RPM and are quite perky .	St
1.4.5	The Seagates I pair in RAID 1 arrays to store data and as part of my backup scheme .	St
1.4.6	RAID 1 provides some security against HD failure .	St
1.4.7	Keep in mind that a warranty does not get back your data .	St
1.4.8	It just gives you a replacement empty drive if yours fails within the warranty period and that replacement might be a & quot ; refurb & quot ; unit .	St
