1.4.1	When I get a Blue Screen its all about Hardware.. .. Did you ORDER the Correct machine for the Software and hardware.. ..	St
1.4.2	Example ... for Multi-Media you really need a Pentium 4 Processor as minimum..the Celeron D is a Audio ONLY CPU.. .. Also if you ordered a Video Card installed I might check that for the problem-since that 's an ADVANCED User 's part..your supplier might have that installed wrong.. ..	St
1.4.3	If this is your First PC/your definitely in trouble on the money side..	St
1.4.4	It may have a Built in Defect from the Supplier..and if you intercede thay can PULL the WARRANTY.. You may want to CONTACT a Consumer Advocate in your Local Area for help on the issue of a defective PC .	St
1.5.1	There are TONS of good PC's.. Go to Circuit CITY to make a purchase..Circuit CITY has a Good Customer Service policy..	St
1.5.2	I just built my first PC/but the LENOVO Brand seems really interesting.. .. DELL makes great PC 's and Laptops..but you fairly well get stuck w/the configuration you intitally purchased..upgrades are risky.. .. TOSHIBA makes great products.. .. SONY/is expensive ... .I quess there are SONY fans out there..I have a SONY Burner Drive ( its excellent ) .. .. PanaSonic makes LapTops called TOUGH-Books..take a look there.. ..	St
1.5.3	ACER ... I saw an ACER at Circuit CITY-a LapTop ... did n't need a LapTop but was vert tempted..nice Priced LapTop.. .. $ $ 5000.00 will get you one heck of a PC .	St
