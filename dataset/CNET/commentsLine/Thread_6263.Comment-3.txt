two methods: swap files over/transfer -or- buy a larger hd.
save your data to any media(cd/dvd) of installed pgms.
besides the os and its default pgms.
once done and proper, de-install pgms., reboot and then re-install in drive &quot;d&quot;.
you can then swap data to the new location, etc.. once done, you've free-up space.
however, just buying a new hd that say 250gb, to replace your drive &quot;c&quot;.
then use its own manufacturer's provided s/w can transfer the whole old to new hd, then remove old hd entirely.
you gain more space and the system is more capable.
in fact, get a real large hd and replace both old drives, as a 250gb and larger is very common now, easily outstrips a 80 or 70gb old drive.
buying a new hd is pretty simple with manufacturer's s/w involved and using the instructions.
review them at support websites to see what's involved.
