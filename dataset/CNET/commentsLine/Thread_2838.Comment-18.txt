the problem is the external case.
if you check whatever passed for documentation included in the external box's packaging, i'll wager it has some information on how that case handles drives and partitions.
the specific problem you're experiencing here is the bios chip that's built into the external case that translates pata or sata to usb.
many cheaper external cases don't support large drives very well, if at all.
case in point: a few years back, i bought an external drive box for a laptop drive i had laying around collecting dust.
the drive box's rather sparse information sheet said that it had to be formatted in a specific way - no partition could be over 20 gb in size and had to be formatted with fat32 or the whole thing would not work.
the drive was 40 gb - so the only way to make it work was to create two 20 gb partitions and format them to fat32.
i'll wager your external case has similar limitations.
if you still want to use your 400 gb drive as an external drive, you probably will want to do a bit of research and find another external case that will specifically support huge partitions.
