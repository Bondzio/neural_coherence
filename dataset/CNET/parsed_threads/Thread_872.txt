<s> Equipment: Netgear 2200 modem / router Vivotek SD8311E camera Windows XP pro IP Camera is wired to router. </s>
<s> IP cam has static local IP. </s>
<s> I can see the IP cam on my *wired* laptop and wired PCs. </s>
<s> I am unable to connect to IP cam when I use my laptop *wirelessly*. </s>
<s> As soon as I plug in the CAT5 cable between the laptop and router, IP cam connects again (I connect by typing the local IP cam address into a browser window). </s>
<s> I am able to see the wireless HP printer. </s>
<s> I am also able to connect to the IP cam from outside the LAN since I have forwarded the appropriate ports - just fyi. </s>
<s> What do I need to do to connect to the local IP cam from my local wireless laptop? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Many routers have firewalls today so you have to know your router. </s>

<s> Bob, I went through all the menus in the router multiple times and couldn't find anything that could be related to the issue. </s>
<s> Do you have any suggestions under which menu item to look? </s>
<s> And could not find the make/model of the router so could you put that in your post? </s>
<s> If you disliked my answer, I can remove it for you too. </s>

<s> First four lines in the post :-)) Equipment: Netgear 2200 modem / router - updated to latest firmware Vivotek SD8311E camera Windows XP pro Thanks! </s>
<s> Sometimes I wonder how I miss such things. </s>
<s> But the 2200 might be the DGN2200 which is why I asked. </s>
<s> http://www.netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/work-and-play/dgn2200.aspx Keep in mind that Netgear's latest may not be their best version (research their iPad connect issues.) </s>
<s> As Netgear does not publish an user manual I won't be able to provide an exact answer. </s>
<s> Again, I see you may dislike this but in the future be sure to select routers that have a manual. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You are correct, it is the DGN2200v1. </s>
<s> I am hoping this link will get you to the manual: http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GDC/DGN2200/DGN2200_UM_3Feb11.pdf Thank you so much for your effort! </s>

<s> &quot;Your modem router has a firewall that blocks unauthorized access to your wireless network and permits authorized inbound and outbound communications. </s>
<s> Authorized communications are established according to inbound and outbound rules. </s>
<s> The firewall has the following two default rules. </s>
<s> You can create custom rules to further restrict the outbound communications or more widely open the inbound communications: &#8226; Inbound. </s>
<s> Block all access from outside except responses to requests from the LAN side. </s>
<s> &#8226; Outbound. </s>
<s> Allow all access from the LAN side to the outside&quot; Notice how an inbound access from WiFi is blocked? </s>
<s> You'll want to change that. </s>
<s> Page 44 (using the page counter in the PDF viewer) shows the default is BLOCK ALWAYS. </s>
<s> Again, firewalls like this are a cause for many of these issues. </s>
<s> Your choice to allow communication. </s>
<s> Sorry it took this many tries but the thumbs down on my first reply looks uncalled for. </s>
