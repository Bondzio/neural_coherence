first, an integrated graphics controller is never as good as a dedicated graphics card, especially if you do 3d visualization or play graphics-intensive games.
but, it costs less.
however, even if you buy a pc with an integrated graphics controller and later on it turns out you don't like it, you should be able to install a dedicated graphics card, and turn off the onboard controller in the system bios.
not certain about this, but reasonably sure.
second, an integrated graphics card saves energy.
this does not matter with a desktop, but it does make a difference with a laptop, if you travel a lot and battery life is an issue.
