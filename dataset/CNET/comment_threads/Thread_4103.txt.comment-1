Have had a external 1T WD I use for backup for about 3 years.
Have run tests on it about every 3 months.
Everything passed.
The last two times it shows Random seek test and Funnel Seek test failed.
When I run CKDSK on it, it will go for about 3 hours and says test can't be completed and locks up where I have to reboot it before Windows can see it again.
I assume this drive is about ready to crap out on me or is there something else I could look at.
External drives are pretty cheap right now so is it even worth messing around with the old one?.
Thanks Wayne
