<s> I moved one of two computers to another room not wired for computer internet. </s>
<s> I purchased and installed a NetGear Wireless Router. </s>
<s> I connected my DSL modem via connector-cable to the NetGear Wireless Router. </s>
<s> One hardwire connection was made to a regularly used computer nearest the router. </s>
<s> My remote computer has a mating NetGear pc-Wireless card attached and everything works with one exception. </s>
<s> That exception is that the hardwired computer (nearest the Wireless Router) for some reason needs to be on and online in order for the remote computer to actually have an internet connection. </s>
<s> My question is, &quot;If I connect the DSL modem to a hardwired Router with one connection for my computer and then one connection to the Wireless Router would the remote computer have internet access without having a host computer power on and online?&quot; My intention was to have the remote computer have the capability of achieving a real wireless connection to the internet without any other computer running. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be appreciated! </s>
<s> Sorry, but what you said was very confusing to me. </s>
<s> Here is what should happen. </s>
<s> You need: 1. </s>
<s> Your two computers, each with some kind of Network Card(Your first with a wired and the second with the wireless) 2. </s>
<s> One DSL modem 3. </s>
<s> One Wireless router with an internal switch. </s>
<s> [I believe you have both 2 and 3, although it would help if you included more info as to the model numbers] Sounds to me like you might have the remote computer somehow getting its internet connection through a &quot;host&quot; (your wired) computer. </s>
<s> This is not what you need. </s>
<s> When setting up the network make sure you have it gaining access to the internet through a &quot;residential gateway&quot;(your router). </s>
<s> Run the Wizards and Configuration CDs included with your router and cards. </s>
<s> This should help. </s>
<s> If you include more info about OS, models, etc. </s>
<s> we can help you a little more. </s>

<s> I have a similar problem to the original query. </s>
<s> I don't know the solution, but can shed some light on the subject. </s>
<s> Equipment: Belkin high speed Mode Wireless router and desktop network card running Windows XP SP1. </s>
<s> I only have one PC at the moment but am planning to add more soon. </s>
<s> I want to move the computer to another room to decorate but use the wifi link to continue access to the Internet. </s>
<s> Router and DSL broadband modem work fine when connected using the wired lan with the wifi link disabled. </s>
<s> When enabled the wifi link has good signal - not surprising as they sit next to each other. </s>
<s> I cannot however get the Internet. </s>
<s> If I enable the wifi link while connected to the Internet and disable/disconnect the wired lan, the internet continues to work fine over the wifi link. </s>
<s> Shutting down and re booting however looses the Internet link. </s>
<s> I think Windows XP is the problem but I don't know how to configure it. </s>
<s> The Wizard seems to be a waste of time. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Do you have WEP enabled. </s>
<s> I was having a similar problem. </s>
<s> I had connection but no internet, and i was unable to ping the router. </s>
<s> Very Wierd. </s>
<s> I turned off the WEP and reinstalled the wifi card. </s>
<s> Worked then i setup the WEP again. </s>
<s> Try this then let me know. </s>
