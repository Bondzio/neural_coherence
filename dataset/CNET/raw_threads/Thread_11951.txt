Something is wrong. Should i get a Usb 2.0 hub and connect it to that because the computer is usb 1.1

What I would do now is install Intel's latest chipset drivers. Since you posted enough details I'll supply the link to the proper package. http://downloadfinder.intel.com/scripts-df-external/filter_results.aspx?strTypes=all&ProductID=816&OSFullName=Windows*+XP+Home+Edition&lang=eng&strOSs=45&submit=Go%21 &quot; Drivers
