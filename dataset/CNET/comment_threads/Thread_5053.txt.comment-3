but just because it has more doesn't mean it's better.
The memory interface is just as important if not more.
For example my system came with a 7300LE turbocache card listed as 256MB.
It was configured to use 512MB.64bit memory interface.
Most half decent cards now are true 256MB cards with a 128bit memory interface.
The higher-end cards are 256MB+ with 256bit+ memory interfaces.
