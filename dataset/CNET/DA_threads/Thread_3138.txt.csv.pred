1.1.1	I'm running a Gigabyte MB,GA7N400L and an FX5200 256meg Nvidia video card,& an Athlon XP 2800+ CPU & 1 gig RAM.	St
1.1.2	Seems if I load the fail safe bios, I'm running the FSB at 100mHz and as a result the cpu is 1250MHz instead of the 2080MHz it should.	St
1.1.3	All was well and running at the expected speeds until I suddenly noticed that the cpu was showing me the 1250.	St
1.1.4	When changing it to 166FSB, I reverted to the VGASAVE video mode and the Nvidia driver could not install.	St
1.1.5	I'm once again able to sucessfully install the NVidia Driver for XP but am running at 100FSB speed instead of the 166.	St
1.1.6	I noticed when re-plugging in the system (having removed it) the system clock was incorrect.	St
1.1.7	I'm wondering if maybe the cmos battery is possibly behind all this confusion?	St
1.1.8	Thanks as always.	St

1.2.1	I have on my secondary computer A Gigabyte GA 7N400 pro 2 motherboard, My first CPU was a AMD XP 2800 Then I switched to AMD XP 3200 Which is maxed out on that mother board.	St
1.2.2	I have AMD XP 3200 on both my computers set at 200 which gives me 400 FBS.	St
1.2.3	Inside Bios I had the AMD XP 2800 set on 166 Which is 333 FSB, and when I boot up I see AMD XP 2800 which is correct.	St
1.2.4	When I pull up CPU information, the speed I see is 2080 MHZ.	St
1.2.5	The AMD site has a utility Called CPU Info it tells you all about your CPU even if you have Intel CPU.	St
1.2.6	I still have a XFX 5700 256 LE Video card in my secondary computer.	St
1.2.7	(Works fine) My Gigabyte GA 7N400 Pro 2 had to go back to Gigabyte once for and issue.	St
1.2.8	Had know problems after that.	St
1.2.9	Check your manuel to see where your CLK Ratio is suppose to be set at on your motherboard.	St
1.2.10	It may be set incorrectly and have to be reset.	St
1.2.11	The Manuel I have has your motherboard in it wiht two others.	St
1.2.12	If you do not have the manuel download it from Gigabyte.	St
1.2.13	If you can not get the CPU settings correct, you may have a CPU or a Motherboard issue.	St
1.2.14	Call up Gigabyte and get there help, they are very good.	St
