<s> OK, I've seen and read other posts that are almost identical to my issue but none that are exactly like mine. </s>
<s> I've been through Microsoft and Dell with no solution, I'm hopeful that I can find a solution or at least a good answer here. </s>
<s> I have a Dell XPS 600 and I'm running Windows XP Pro 32bit. </s>
<s> My computer came from the factory with 2GB of dual cahnnel RAM DDR2-SDRAM PC2-5300 (333 MHz) I recently purchased two more GB of RAM from Dell making sure to ues the exact same type. </s>
<s> My computer has 4 Dimm slots and the motherboard can use up to 8GB of ram with a 64bit OS. </s>
<s> My problem is that the new ram shows up in the Bios but not in system properties. </s>
<s> It also shows in system information but system information is also telling me that I only have 2 GB available. </s>
<s> I have run PC wizard to see what it has to tell me. </s>
<s> PC wizard tells me that I have 1GB of RAM in each DIMM slot, but under the configuration tab when you click on the Windows logo it tells me that I have only 2GB of RAM, I'm a bit confused, I have the same software telling me two different things. </s>
<s> I assume at this point that my OS is seeing 4GB of RAM but is only using 2. </s>
<s> If there is anyone that can help me I can't even tell you how much I would appreciate it. </s>
<s> Even those informational ones. </s>
<s> Please do more research since it's not busted. </s>
<s> Do try the /3GB switch. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> how much ram does it say you have? </s>
<s> Hey Bob, thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I do realize that most apps in Windows can only access 2GB max, my problem is that I'm getting info that tells me that I have 4GB installed but only 2GB are available. </s>
<s> For example in my system properties it says 2GB. </s>
<s> I have tried the 3GB switch but it changed nothing. </s>
<s> Thanks Again. </s>
<s> Hi there, system properties says that I have 2GB of RAM while system info says that I have 4GB. </s>
<s> Do you know of a way to check and see if more than 2GB can ever be used? </s>
<s> I know people who have added RAM in their system and it allways shows in system properties for some reason in my situation it does not. </s>
<s> As I mentioned system info shows that I have 4GB as does the Bios. </s>
<s> If you read the articles the applications are limited to 2.0GB unless they are compiled with a special setting. </s>
<s> Nothing busted here. </s>
<s> from dell's support website: http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/xps600/en/SM/specs0.htm#wp1052939 Maximum memory: 2 GB or 8 GB NOTE: See &quot;Addressing Memory Configurations&quot; to verify the amount of memory available to the operating system. </s>
<s> http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/xps600/en/SM/parts0.htm#wp1052391 If using a 32-bit operating system such as Microsoft Windows XP, your computer will support a maximum of 2 GB of memory . </s>
<s> If you are using a 64-bit operating system, your computer will support a maximum of 8 GB (2-GB DIMMs in each of the four slots) of memory. </s>
<s> Sorry, but you max out at 2GB. </s>
<s> Thank you for the time and info Rob, honestly thanks to this forum I now know whats going with my computer. </s>
<s> Now to see if I can send the memory back. </s>
<s> Thanks Again. </s>
<s> Thats what I get for trusting the manufacturers of both the computer and the operating system that runs it to tell me what I need to know about their product. </s>
<s> Thank you for your time and your ability to state the obvious. </s>
<s> I use computers every day and I'm almost always able to fix my own issues but this time I got the idea in my head that I could run 4GB of RAM on my computer, of course this idea was given to me by a salesman selling RAM of course. </s>
<s> Anyway, thank you for your help and now I'll sit back and wait to see if the Apps I use will ever be compatible with an 64bit OS. </s>
<s> I am getting ready to build a new system and am thinking of using Vista-does it go past 2 gb? </s>
<s> There are 64-bit versions of Windows but it's a wasteland of hard to find drivers and support. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> I have been told the more ram installed the better & faster games would run.Why do they have four dimm slots in the new motherboards and tell you the capacity if it isn't going to be used? </s>
<s> While the mfg could guess which OS you're going to use, they don't know for sure what OS and what version of the OS you will be installing. </s>
<s> And with 4 DIMM slots, folks can start with 2 @ 256MBs, 2 @ 512MBs, 2 @ 1GB or 4 @ 512MBs ... depending on budget. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...DDR2 Ram hasn't always been this cheap. </s>
<s> That was back when the average machine had much less. </s>
<s> Today and for now, 2GB is plenty with no benchmarks showing more is better. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There are boot commands to get around this and a MS fix for the memory adress problem. </s>
<s> But this will slow it down as it takes a different route to say, and isnt exactly worth it unless absolutely needed. </s>
<s> If so you should be running 64bit anyways. </s>
<s> Windows will usually recognize around 3/3.5ish, it reserves system memory and gpu ram that will affect the memory count. </s>
<s> How will you fix an app that wasn't compiled with that special switch? </s>
<s> Again, the benefits of over 2GB are rare today. </s>
<s> But I do see many that love to brag they maxed it out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have what I believe is a 32 bit operating system which i was told will only hold 2, 1 gb ram sticks in its two open slots. </s>
<s> I already have one in there and the other 1gb is new. </s>
<s> I believe they both are DDR (atleast the new one is) and i have an intel processor. </s>
<s> My properties show 960 mb but my bios reads 2000 mb? </s>
<s> please help! </s>
<s> What you noted can happen as some is used for video and or other things. </s>
<s> You are posting to a 2008 post so this old post is closed. </s>
<s> Make a new post with all the machine details. </s>
