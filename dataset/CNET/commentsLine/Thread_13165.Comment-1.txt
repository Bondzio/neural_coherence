i have a sony micro vault usm8gl flash drive that is not recognized by any computer that i stick it into.
the last time that i tried to access it it said that something about it being a security device and i popped it out.
everysine then i have not been able to acess the data on the flash drive.
it is a 8gb drie and nearly full.
it has all of my most precious data on it icluding baby photo's, the book i have been writing and tax information.
i am thinking that somehow it was converted to a security device but i have searched high and low on how to change that as well with no luck whatsoever.
i am quite desperate.
i have not backed it up because of time.
so please don't give me any smart remarks about being stupid for not backing it up....i know that i was a fool for not backing it up.
