i have been working with layouts in word and doing some simple graphic design with ms publisher and adobe photoshop elements on a dell laptop.
i now want to move on to adobe indesign cs and photoshop full version and plan to buy a desktop with 2 monitors.
everything i read about graphic cards has to do with video that i have no interest in.
can anyone recommend specs for a good graphic card, ram size (1gb enough?
), and monitor size and specs for this type of application?
money is no object but i don't want to do an overkill either as everything will inevitably be obsolete faster than i can amortize it!
thanks.
