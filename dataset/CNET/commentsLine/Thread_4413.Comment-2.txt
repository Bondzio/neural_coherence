if the drive worked before, look at the ribbon cable, the motherboard and the drive itself.
all have pin 1 configuration marks.
make sure the red mark on the ribbon (pin 1) goes to pin 1 on the motherboard.
some floppies do not have the mark - so try the cable both ways.
if this doesn't work try a new cable.
