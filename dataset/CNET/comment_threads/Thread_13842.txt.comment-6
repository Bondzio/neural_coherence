I've had the same annoying stutter since I installed the N card and router.
I tried a couple of things I read on other threads, but nothing fixed it - it would stutter at least 2 or 3 times in a matter of 3 or 4 minutes.
I just tried something new and It hasn't stuttered for 10 minutes - I'm hoping this fixed it.
Go into your router's control panel and open the Wireless Settings tab - in the Basic Settings panel, make the following changes: Radio Band: Standard 20 MHZ Channel Standard Channel: 11 - 2.462GHZ Then, re-establish your connection.
I've just listened to over half a CD and still no stutter.
Hope this helps.
