While I know all that one needs in at http://www.wown.com the issue is that many can't research such ICS setups or will install a firewall before getting it to work.
About the comment about a HUB.
Such is an invalid configuration and a few get rather tense that no one can make it work.
Just because you can plug the cables in, doesn't mean it will do the job.
Also, with routers spotted at 9.99 and up, that hub will likely cost that much so why not do it right?
