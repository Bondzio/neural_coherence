I have a 1.6 pentium in it and have just scored a celeron d335+ processor. I see the cooling fan and heat sinks dont fit but can i still use the processor with my old coolling system? Do i have to edit and bios ****? Any help would be much apreciated...

Go into your bios and see if there is a cpu temperature reading if you want to use the old heatsink and fan. Remember you need to grease the heatsink with the cpu. Besides, don't the cpu you have came with a heatsink and fan combo, mine did but it was a pentinum D. If not, look up a heatsink with the correct socket for the motherboard. You can look it up on yahoo or google and find the motherboard and its socket type. Hope that helps.

Hey thanks for replying, O.k well i.ve tryed the new processor (celeron d 335+) and no go my computer or motherboard or whatever wont reconize it. So i've looked all over the net and have found out that intel no longer supports my motherboard but the last info on it that they posted was it supported a celeron 1.8 i think it was, so i'm thinking that if i change my bios to read the new processor it will work (i'm new to this stuff so if i'm totally wrong dont hold it against me.)
1578	4	237970	2428634	2428056	morphus1	3/13/07 7:00 AM	1.1737692E12	thanks	Exactly what i was thinking. can i change the bios to read the new cpu? If so can you tell me how? And as to the fan thing i dont have a clue why it doesnt fit the old system was a alu block mounted to the cpu with the fan mounted to the casing. The new systems clamps are completly different to the old.

It should work because I just changed from celeron d to pentinum d on my intel motherboard but luckily i did not need to update my bios.
