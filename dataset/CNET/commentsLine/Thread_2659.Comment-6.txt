seagate is the best because of 3 little words: five year warranty.
they also have the highest ratings (that i know of) for impact threshold.
so you may be able to throw them on the ground and have them still work; although, i wouldn't recommend it: it voids the warranty!
not to mention the fact that every single western digital drive i've got now has a screwed up track 0, which means i can no longer use them as a master drive to put windows on.
on another note i hope the it guy(s) responsible for mislabeling the topic have now been fired!
now, whenever i read your emails i'm going to have to make sure you've labeled the topics right, basically make sure you know what you're doing.
so shouldn't i be paid for doing your job?
