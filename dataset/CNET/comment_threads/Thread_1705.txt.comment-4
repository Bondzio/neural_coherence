Ouch.
Too many discussions about that.
The cable should have been fine.
However without testing it wired (my brother does this work) the client is never sure if more wifi gear is the answer.
Why?
Well on the new Smart TV and players there is a lot more lag than what you see on a common PC.
I'm finding folk compare the response times on the TV to their PC.
