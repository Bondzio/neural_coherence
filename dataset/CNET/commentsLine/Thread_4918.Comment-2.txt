all files?
or only one?
if only one, what kind of file is it?
for example, to open a quicktime movie, you need apples quicktime.
to open a microsoft project file, you need microsoft project.
so it can very well be that you don't have the right program installed on your tablet to open this type of files.
but you didn't provide the details.
