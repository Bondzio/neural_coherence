1.1.1	I have an ASUS B202 .	St
1.1.2	I do n't think a sound card was ever installed on this device , it 's a hand-me-down but it 's in great condition .	St
1.1.3	When I go to the volume control it tells me that & quot ; no active mixers are installed & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	I 've installed the drivers from the ASUS website but an error pops up during install , & quot ; no audio device on HD detected & quot ; ( or something like that ) .	St
1.1.5	I think my only way of getting sound off this thing without having to send it back to ASUS might be an external sound card ( USB ) but I know absolutely nothing about them .	St
1.1.6	Do they work ?	Ques
1.1.7	Does it basically replace what should have been installed on the motherboard ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks in advance for help , you guys rule .	St
1.2.1	Almost all HD audio solutions have us install the MS UAA ( yes that 's a google for you ) driver first from the machine or motherboard maker BEFORE the audio driver .	St
1.2.2	It seems either the documentation omits this important step or people do n't read said docs .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the tip .	St
1.3.2	I 'll try installing the UAA before I do anything else .	St
1.4.1	An external sound card will also still take care of the problem though , right ?	Ques
1.4.2	Let 's say we do n't install the ms uaa , an external would replace the need to do so ?	Ques
1.5.1	The external should come with an install CD that will walk you through it .	St
