what program are you using to extract the files?
- i use &quot;winzip&quot; from  when you say &quot;extracting&quot; do you mean you are trying to extract all the &quot;cab&quot; files from the large xpsp2.exe file you downloaded?
or have you done that already and you are now extracting individual files from the cab files?
what method are you using to produce a slip stream sp2 disk - let me know so i can read the method as well and follow what you are doing???
