1.1.1	Hi , Im deciding whether or not I should buy this computer , please give me all your suggestions , they are ALL welcome , thank you .	Ques
1.1.2	Intel Core i5 750 Quad Core Gigabyte CrossFireX USB3.0 SATA3 Motherboard Western Digital Caviar Black 1TB SATA3 6GB/S 7200RPM 64MB Cache 3.5IN Dual Proc Hard Drive OEM Samsung Black DVD writer XFX Radeon HD 5770 850MHZ Video Card Antec Three Hundred Mini Tower Gaming Case Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Edition 64BIT DVD OEM OCZ ModXStream Pro 700W ATX 20/24 PIN SLI All this adds up with about $ 1,206 Canadian dollars	St
1.2.1	buy a machine with only one hard drive .	St
1.2.2	That 1TB drive might be fine for data but I 'd put the OS and apps on something smaller .	St
1.2.3	I 'm also not seeing RAM .	St
1.2.4	If you 're going 64 bit , you 'll go 4 gigs and up .	St
1.2.5	That i5 will be dual channel so 4 gigs means 2 modules minimum so figure about 100 + bucks US per set .	St
1.3.1	I built a similar setup in Sept 09 for about $ 900 US .	St
1.3.2	But I had 2 ea .	St
1.3.3	500 GB sata drives along with the Caviar Green 1TB .	St
1.3.4	I used my old case though and a 650 Corsair PSU along with the Win 7 upgrade early release which was $ 49 .	St
1.3.5	So your prices are not far out of line , you can shop around for a little better .	St
1.3.6	ZipZoom , New Egg and Tiger are all moderately priced , sometimes you can find a deal or rebate .	St
1.4.1	Too high , why MINI tower ?	Ques
1.5.1	I 'm trying to figure out if this is a config you have setup , a system configurator ( from a website , eg : Newegg , TigerDirect , etc .	St
1.5.2	) , or a specific brand name ( HP , Acer , Gateway , Dell ) .	St
1.5.3	If it 's a system you 're thinking of putting together yourself ; I would definitely be looking at a larger case ; the Antec 300 is just too small to allow the proper ventilation you 'll need to cool the CPU and videocard , also your first build should be a joy not a nightmare because the case you bought is too small for your components .	St
1.5.4	As stated before , we think you forgot to include the RAM , this will add some cost to your project .	St
1.5.5	If this is a specific system from a manufacturer ; then make sure you check their website forums for customer reviews , problems , concerns , etc .	St
1.5.6	If you 're looking to buy a specific setup ; then you need to decide what you 're going to be using the computer for ( eg : photo/ video editing , gaming , etc .	St
1.5.7	) , then decide which components will best suit your needs .	St
1.5.8	Judging by the price ( $ 1206 CAD ) ; I 'm thinking you probably hail from Canada-not a bad thing , if you 're in the western region , try researching components from NCIX , Newegg.ca , or Memory Express .	St
1.5.9	I buy all my computer components from Memory Express for 3 reasons ; their competively priced , quality products , and the best extended warranties in the west http : //www.memoryexpress.com/ .	St
1.5.10	I do n't know if you have set your mind on Intel , but for $ 1206 you can put together a rather killer AMD system	St
