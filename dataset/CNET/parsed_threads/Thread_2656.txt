<s> I'm looking for the perfect hard drive for taking digital photographs in the field without a computer. </s>
<s> Therefore I need a portable USB hard drive with a built in card reader that can read compact flash. </s>
<s> Or, I'm not sure if hard drives come like this, but are there any USB hard drives that have their own USB port? </s>
<s> If so then could I plug a card reader into the hard drive? </s>
<s> I plan on being without computer or internet access for stretchs of a couple weeks at a time and I need a solid setup to encourage my digital photography. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
