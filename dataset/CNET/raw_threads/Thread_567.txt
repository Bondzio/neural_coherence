Does anyone have this card or have first hand experience that knows how good the graphics are. I want to be able to play games like Rome total war and the upcoming Medieval total war 2 on high settings. Or is there a better card that I should be looking at? I am getting a 400 watt power supply, have a pentium 4 processor and not afraid of spending some money, if it gets me what I want. -Thanks

The 512MB VRAM on the X1600Pro doesn't make a difference in performance; it's just for marketing. The 7600GT SLAUGHTERS the X1600Pro AND the more expensive X1600XT. You can get an eVGA 7600GT for $135 on newegg. I am getting a 400 watt power supply What brand and model is that power supply? and not afraid of spending some money How much are you willing to spend? Also, what's the rest of your computer specs?

I'm not sure of the model I would be willing to spend up to $ 300 if it is an outstanding video card (yeah, I know the best ones cost like $ 500 but I don't have the power supply for it) What other specs would you need?

The 12V rail powers the CPU, video card, motherboard, and some other important stuff, so you want to have at least 20A on the 12V rail. The more amps, the more power that can be delivered to the devices that it's powering. IE: If the PSU has 10A on the 12V rail, you multiply 10x12, and get 120. That means that 120 watts are available for all the devices powered by the 12V rail. A single high-end video card can use more than 100 watts of power, so you get the message.

They also said that installing a PSU with more than 1.5 amp would damage my mother board and that all HPs are give 1.5 amps on the 12v rail. Apparently it's impossible to upgrade my computer cause i've been doing this for about 2 weeks and still nothing.

My computer came from HP with a 300W power supply with 19A on the 12V rail. It was powering a Pentium 4, one hard drive, two DVD drives, and a Radeon X600. HP gave you the wrong information; don't cancel the order; just look at the sticker on the PSU when you receive it.

I'm having the most difficult time tracking down micro-atx power supplies above 300 watts. HP is really starting to **** me off, the keep giving me wrong info. Is there any good graphics card that could just run on my current specs. ?
