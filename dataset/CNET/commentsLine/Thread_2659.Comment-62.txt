you do not say if that contains your data only or data and program files.
assuming it is data only and figuring they get 5 gig on each dvd that comes out to 100 gig there friend.
if it were me, i'd go the hard drive route, which i do, and if you can muster the cost, make that two hard drive backups, not just one, although, you'd probably be ok with one.
actually, just do a ghost to the hard drive and then, update your data as you continue operation periodically.
