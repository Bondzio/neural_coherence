1.1.1	Hi , I noticed that the LG x130 comes with a Hidden Partition that stores the backup-recovery for the netbook .	St
1.1.2	Is there any way to completely remove the hidden partition ( or just disable the F11 option after the BIOS ) ?	Ques
1.1.3	I would like the extra space and removing that F11 function would really come in handy .	St
1.1.4	Thank you !	St
1.2.1	the partition or whatever you 'd like to do with it .	St
1.2.2	3rd party partition managers can do this or you can use something like ptedit or ptedit32 to make it visible and do as you with within Windows .	St
1.2.3	These are generally quite small so you do n't gain much in the way of hard drive space .	St
1.2.4	I presume you already have your own fool proof backup method in place .	St
1.3.1	Would I be able to use PTEDIT32 under Windows 7 ?	Ques
1.3.2	I have a feeling that the F11 option after the BIOS loads directly from the hidden partition .	St
1.3.3	So removing the partition would mean removing the F11 option .	St
1.3.4	Thanks for the help .	St
1.3.5	Other comments are still welcome since I would rather not use 3rd party software to make this hidden partition visible .	St
1.4.1	I get an error trying to run ptedit32 ( failed to start PowerQuest engine ) .	St
1.4.2	I 've not tried from a DOS boot disk , however .	St
1.4.3	I know Acronis Disk Director works but that cost money .	St
1.4.4	As for the F11 option , I ca n't speak to that as it may come from the BIOS or some special boot loader .	St
1.4.5	Personally , I 'd not worry about such a small loss of space but , if you want to try anyway , I 'd make a full HD image including the recovery partition as well .	St
1.4.6	You could always wipe the drive and just restore the primary partition to the full size of the drive .	St
1.4.7	It would accomplish the same purpose .	St
1.5.1	I use CLONEZILLA to backup the entire image to a file on my USB external NTFS formatted hard drive .	St
1.5.2	And it 's free .	St
1.5.3	Sorry if I do n't write a tutorial but it 's a little easy to use .	St
1.5.4	I also use GPARTED as well as EASYBCD for other minor duties .	St
1.5.5	And those are free and well discussed on the net .	St
1.5.6	Hope my sharing helps you save a buck , Bob	St
