first the problem with fat32 is that the maximum filesize is 4 gigabyte.
for our office our first nas was given away due to that limit.
next the real issue came home is even at 100 megabit the transfer rates are quite slow.
your average usb 2.0 is some double to quadruple that speed.
the internal drive double or more than again.
see the slowski's commercial?
with a little google you can find other nas with the better linux or ntfs (file systems) and maybe you can more to gigabit network speeds to cure the speed issue.
i now have the dlink nas, but the speed issue is still there until we upgrade the network switch to gigabit speed.
in closing, i think you'll be disappointed even if the filesystem is fixed.
