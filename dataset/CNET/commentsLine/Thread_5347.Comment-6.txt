yeah digger that is the antenna that came with that model desktop, it is obviously unplugged from the system(unscrewed) and of course is non functional in that position.
from what i saw of the other pic alluding to bluetooth (no hardware found) i am not sure what he is using for a dongle or what the configuration is but as you know, bluetooth doesn't recognize wifi.
