From what I understand of DFS it cannot utilize all the unused storage space that lives on Windows 7 or Windows XP workstations.
It can only distrubute/replicate data between Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2012.
I would like to utilize all that unused storage space on all those workstations.
It appears DFS can't do that.
