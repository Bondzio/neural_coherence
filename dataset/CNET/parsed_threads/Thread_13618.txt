<s> I have a Brother MFC-440CN multi function printer, which is network capable. </s>
<s> I use an Ethernet cable to connect it to my D-Link DIR-825 router. </s>
<s> But printing a test page does not work. </s>
<s> The D-Link people say I have to get the following from Brother: PCP port # & UDP port #. </s>
<s> I'm on hold so long with Brother that I thought I'd ask this forum how to get those numbers. </s>
<s> The D-Link people said I also have to know how to set the following in my printer: static IP address subnet mask default gateway Does anyone know how to do this? </s>
<s> P.S., I'm running Vista Home Pro 64 bit on a Dell XPS 1530 laptop. </s>
<s> No, I don't know how. </s>
<s> I do know that the MFC-440 is not listed at http://www.brother.com/E-ftp/windowsxp/us.html and a few other places. </s>
<s> As such my advice is to pack it up and return it since we can't find XP 64 drivers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> To make sure your PC can communicate with the Brother printer, you'll need to know the printers IP address. </s>
<s> This can be done by printing out a configuration page from the printer console. </s>
<s> Once you get the address, can you ping it from the PC? </s>
<s> As far as port #'s, I wouldn't be concerned with this unluss your trying to reach the printer over the Internet via a router. </s>
