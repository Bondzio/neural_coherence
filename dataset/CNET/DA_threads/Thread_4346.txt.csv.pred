1.1.1	Well , it was bound to happen sometime ... About 5 months ago , my DVD-rom was incapable of reading DVDs for a short period of time , just as I was trying to show something to someone , but it was apparently just 1 DVD that it had a problem with , and no others .	St
1.1.2	However , now , first , it could n't read DVD+Rs ( which it formerly could ) , then it could no longer read anything ... CDs or DVDs .	St
1.1.3	And thats where I am stuck now .	St
1.1.4	My drive is a MT1316B BDV212B ( or so the drivers say ) however I know its a 8X , or it was when I bought it many many years ago ( BDV tells me it should be a 12x ... . go figure ) .	St
1.1.5	Anyways , what I mainly wonder is that my friend has a CD/DVD drive cleaner , and it would be great if I could test it out , however my drive is currently incapable of even detecting whether the disk in the drive is a DVD or a CD , and wont allow me to run the program to have it access track 3 , where the brushes on the cd are ...	St
1.1.6	Question 1 : Is there a program I could use to make the drive spin up and move the lazer around to possibly clean it ?	Sug
1.1.7	Question 2 : Is thereany other suggestions someone might have for possible fixes ?	Ques
1.1.8	or any possible answers as to why this happened ?	Ques
1.1.9	I 've always used the drive lightly ...	St
1.2.1	Question 1 : Is there a program I could use to make the drive spin up and move the lazer around to possibly clean it ?	Sug
1.2.2	There are cleaner kits that you reach in and swap the lens .	St
1.2.3	Question 2 : Is thereany other suggestions someone might have for possible fixes ?	Ques
1.2.4	or any possible answers as to why this happened ?	Ques
1.2.5	I 've always used the drive lightly ...	St
1.2.6	I replace the drive since it 's a commodity item and repair of those drives are not possible .	St
1.2.7	No vendor schematics , no spare parts and tech time exceeds the cost of a drive every time .	St
1.2.8	Some want to fix the drive , but its best to let them figure out that such is n't going to happen .	St
1.2.9	Usually they rack up phone bills greater than the cost of the new drive before it sinks in .	St
1.2.10	I hope this reply will hurry your epiphany .	St
1.2.11	Your story is typical with some DVD type being hard to read and then it degrades further .	St
1.2.12	The laser loses power and soon nothing works .	St
1.2.13	Try a cd lens cleaner , new firmware and then change the drive .	St
1.2.14	Bob	St
1.3.1	.	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the info , but as usual , I 'm looking away from spendng a single penny on this , and really dont have the money to replace the drive .	St
1.4.2	Ok , well I lied , I have the money currently but ... Dont wan na spend it on a DVD rom drive ... . 16x dvd-rom that reads all formats : ~ $ 40-45 .	St
1.4.3	4x/2x/8x DVD+/-R drive that can make 1.4gb cds - $ 106 ... .	St
1.4.4	It dont seem worth buying the DVD rom ... Will save up for the DVD writer ...	St
1.5.1	The CD Lens Cleaner thing ( or swab ) is the usual .	St
1.5.2	I 've resurrected 1 drive by finding latest firmware .	St
1.5.3	But with such a low success rate , I wonder if it should be on & quot ; the list. & quot ; The cost of having & quot ; tech & quot ; update the firmware on a DVD-ROM exceeds what you can buy a DVD+/-R/W in just a few weeks .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	I use a CD cleaning disk which will play an animated cartoon while cleaning .	St
1.6.2	That means its cleaning and reading the cartoon and supposely gives a & quot ; thumbs-up & quot ; in being readable .	St
1.6.3	Its by Alstop or ALLSOP makers .	St
1.6.4	The price is less than $ 8US and available in most stores .	St
1.6.5	As for the CDs themselves , use a cleaner for them as well .	St
1.6.6	Greasy or sticky fingers can play havoc overtime so its worth it to get a device that cleans disks .	St
1.6.7	Plus a can of air to blow out any dust as well .	St
1.6.8	*NOTE* CD drives no matter what type will fail sooner or later , but a quality drive tends to last longer .	St
1.6.9	Also , users using a DVD drive to read plain CDs may find getting/replacing a std .	St
1.6.10	CD drive ( read only ) so when it fails the cost is cheaper to replace plus you keep the more expensive DVD or CD/RW drives for those tasks alone .	St
1.6.11	That 's my 2-cents -- -- -Willy	St
