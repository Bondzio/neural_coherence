Here is what happens during 6 minute video clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4x5ydW4fBM&feature=youtu.be As you see it's almost impossible to watch... This happens occasionally in other sites too. I remember once or twice even speedtest.net froze during the test. Same with bigger downloads from sites - I have to pause then resume to finish downloading but file gets damaged from it. Sometimes it downloads smoothly though ;l Torrents download with no problems. Also, sexy videos never freeze So what's wrong with my internet? Changing browsers or anti virus didn't make any difference ;l maybe I should configure router in some specific way? Specs: Win7 64bit newest updates Gygabite P61-USB3-B3 Intel i3-2120 HD5670 No parts were OC'ed Please help!
