I am trying to decide whether or not to purchase an external hard drive and I am looking for some advice.
Which ones are the best?
I would like something that is easily portable and that I can have access to whether I am in the office, car, beach, coffee shop, etc.
How secure in a sense are these drives.
For example if I drop it is data going to erase?
My flash drive has been through hell and back and still works (drops, wash machines, step on, etc.)
so I am looking for something like that.
Thanks in adavance.
