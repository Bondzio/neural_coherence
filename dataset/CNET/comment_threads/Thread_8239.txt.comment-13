If none of the other answers work (i have no idea about making home made antennas!!
), use a Yagi Antenna on a 802.11g connection.
A normal access point broadcasts the signal in a circle.
A Yagi antenna plugged into the AP sends the siganl out in a specific direction, extending the range by a long way.
Given the distance involved, you shouldn't have a problem.
Avoid Pre-N unless you really have to- The N specification has been approved yet so manufacturers have released equipment that may not conform properly in order to get a jump on the market.
When that happened with g, lots of people had problems with the pre-standard equipment
