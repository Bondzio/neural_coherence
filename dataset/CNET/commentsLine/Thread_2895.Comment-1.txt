recently because of serious system instability, i ran chkdsk to see if the problem was related to bad clusters.
of course chkdsk found a string of errors, reporting things such as &quot;deleting corrupt attribute record...&quot;, &quot;deleting index entry...&quot;, and so on.
after a long wait, the system rebooted, but i found my system even more unstable.
later i found out through the event viewer that chkdsk did 'something' to numerous files in attempt to repair them.
among those were windows core system dll's.
when i tried to look for those files, they did not exist anywhere on the hard drive.
i am afraid that maybe chkdsk didn't do a good job repairing the flies.
perhaps what chkdsk did was just overwriting the bad sectors?
i thought at least chkdsk could move the file segments on that specific sector to another healthy sector to maintain file integrity.
i dare not to use chkdsk again in the future, lest it should delete files by accident, rendering software, personal data, or even windows useless.
my question is: should i expect chkdsk to repair the hard drive while also maintaining data integrity?
or is there any other way to do exactly the tasks mentioned above?
