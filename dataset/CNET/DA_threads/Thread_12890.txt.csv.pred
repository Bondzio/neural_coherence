1.1.1	I was given a Dell FP1900 monitor.	St
1.1.2	It has a 19-pin plug for the screen [not for power].	St
1.1.3	Of course this plug doesn't fit any port on my PC.	St
1.1.4	Where can I find a plug converter to mesh the monitor to the PC?	St
1.2.1	http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/1907FP/en/about.htm#Bottom View	St
1.3.1	Ya.	St
1.3.2	Dell calls it: &quot; 24-pin Digital-only DVI Connector &quot; I assume this is useable with a PC?	St
1.3.3	But that end plug doesn't fit anything I own.	St
1.4.1	I found a vga connection under the screen.	St
1.4.2	Goes vga-vga no problem.	St
