<s> Hey, i just built a new computer that should be wrecking the performance of my old one. </s>
<s> It does run smoothly and i haven't had any issues yet, it runs games just a little better than my old PC. </s>
<s> In certain games on my old PC id get around 100fps and now its only around 125-150 and i think something is holding it back. </s>
<s> I'm going to list my specs and see what you guys think. </s>
<s> PSU maybe? </s>
<s> -Sabertooth 990fx R2.0 motherboard -AMD FX 9590 5.0 GHZ CPU -EVGA GTX 760 4g -Coolermaster HAF case -Corsair H60 water cooler -128gig Kingston SSD + 1tb 7200rpm HDD - 1 stick of 8gig gskill RAM -Coolermaster GX Bronze 650W PSU - Windows 7 pro I'd appreciate any feedback on what (or if) you think think is stopping this from making higher fps numbers. </s>
<s> I didn't see what display you have and since most displays limit at 60, why did you do this? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> its not about monitor fps, its in-game fps that you can see displayed on the screen while playing. </s>
<s> i realize that you can only see a certain amount and monitors exc. </s>
<s> but i should be out promforming my older PC by alot. </s>
<s> I've lost count of machines with no install plan and makers are not helping. </s>
<s> Microsoft had decades to correct this but there's another issue here. </s>
<s> You will find that the driver you use on the card will change as you change the version of the driver. </s>
<s> That is, if a driver goes for speed at the expense of some exactness of the pixels then some gamer flames them on that the fixed driver is usually slower. </s>
<s> There's also too many settings I can tinker with to affect FPS. </s>
<s> So if you are getting more FPS than the old system it's probably fine. </s>
<s> But let's say you aren't happy. </s>
<s> Why not make this a warranty issue and if the maker doesn't help, just return it. </s>

<s> system, specifically the motherboard, is designed to run at max efficiency in the DUAL CHANNEL or 128bit mode. </s>
<s> You indicate having only 1 8GB DIMM which means your system is running in the slower 64bit, single channel mode. </s>
<s> To make the system work in the DUAL CHANNEL MODE....you need matching DIMMs, 2x4, 2x8, 4x4, 4x8 ....all same speed, same timing, same capacity, same mfg....usually a kit containing 2 or 4 matched DIMMs. </s>
<s> Personally I'd check that too to make sure the system is optimized too. </s>
<s> Re the GTX 760...I'd check with the mfg's tech support to see what they have to say too. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Ill try that out, thanks for the input. </s>
