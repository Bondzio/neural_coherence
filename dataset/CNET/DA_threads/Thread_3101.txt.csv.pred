1.1.1	How reliable/stable is a homebulit pc ?	Ques
1.1.2	does it crash less/more than mainstream desktops ?	Ques
1.1.3	Is it more stable ?	Ques
1.1.4	Or does it depend on the hardware , like if I use a $ 50 motherboard it will crash more often etc .	St
1.1.5	Because when I look for a computer ( or anything , like a car ) reliability is a really important factor .	St
1.1.6	I 'll give up a little speed if I know that it will start up everyday .	St
1.1.7	So , are homebuilt pc 's good at reliability ?	Ques
1.2.1	I can attest to my main rig being run 24/7 365 , and I think the longest i 've gone w/o a reboot is around 3 or 4 weeks and even then those reboots are caused by driver updates not instability it depends on the hardware your using mainly , and a $ 50 mainboard is n't necisarily a bad idea in the three machines i 'm running currently , I know the price of two of the motherboards ( the other is ripped from an HP so i 'm not sure what the actual board would cost , the entire tower cost $ 3800 in 2001 ) for my K7 based system i 'm using an Abit AN7 , which currently retails for around $ 86 and for my Celeron D based system i 'm using an Abit VT7 , which was $ 62 if you want to spend $ 180+ on a motherboard go for it , it wo n't provide much stability but might provide more technologies such as SLI or CrossFire , or better overclocking support ( quite honestly the boards I mentioned above both have EXCELLENT overclocking abilities , the VT7 offers VIA 's best chipset for the current Intel platform ( it supports all Pentium 4 's , and all Celeron processors on the mPGA 478 and LGA 775 interfaces ) ) it depends on what your going to do with it , that dictates what hardware you buy I would definatly suggest a homebuilt system , because it is usually more reliable and stable ( you can adjust more settings to provide more stability , and you can get better parts than 99 % of mainstream makers use , and the other 1 % charge so much more that it just justifies building it yourself ) I would entirely suggest doing it , and would be happy to assist you in finding parts if you would like I would suggest browsing www.newegg.com to get some ideas , some brands to look at for quality and stability : Abit Chaintech AMD Intel eVGA Enermax PC Power & Cooling ATi BFG ( graphics cards only ) Maxtor Western Digital you ca n't use all those makers together , and there are quite a few i 've forgotten , but those are some of the better makers of hardware ... to answer a few quetions which might arise AMD 's Athlon64 vs Intel 's Pentium 4 why is Pentium 4 shown so fast vs AMD 's lower speed ( in GHZ ) AMD processors do more work per cycle , and are generally more efficient in that respect , I would suggest AMD due to the lower heatouput/thermal management that they offer in addition to the excellent performance ... oh and they 're cheaper to compare processors : http : //www23.tomshardware.com/index.html it 's a little dated , but it will show what i 'm talking about with valid application benchmarks from a trusted source as for graphics , your looking at 3 possible GPU vendors if your buying an add in card ( avoid all the cards with S3 or SiS chips on them ) those vendors are ATi , nVidia , and XGI I would suggest nVidia 's GeForce 6 series ( 6200 , 6600 and 6800 ) as they all support SM3.0 , and feature FP32 ATi 's Radeon X series ( X300 - X850 ) feature only SM2.0 , and only FP24 it limits gaming possiblities on the machine as for XGI , they currently do n't have any good offerings in the high end market , but if your buying value cards ( in the $ 40- $ 70 range ) consider their Volari V5 , the V8 is just priced too high other good value card options would be some of the parts from ATi 's older Radeon 9 series or nVidia 's older GeForce FX series ( basically if you want the top of the top , get a GeForce 7800 card , if you want something that 'll do about 95 % of what the 7800 can in terms of feature support , get a 6xxx card , if you just want something that works , get a GeForce FX or Radeon 9 ) if you still have questions feel free to reply , as i 'm sure lots of people are willing to assist you	St
1.3.1	Whether you build yourself , have a company build for you , or buy an OEM computer ; the computer is as reliable as it 's internal components are .	St
1.3.2	So if you buy good hardware , you 'll have a reliable computer .	St
1.3.3	But the thing about building your own is that you know who connected those wires and tightened the screws , yourself .	St
1.3.4	If you are experienced at building computers then you should have a reliable computer .	St
1.4.1	Does cooling affect stability ?	Ques
1.4.2	I do n't mean like overheat hot , obviously that affects reliability a little ... but like if my components are 40 degrees will they function better than stuff at 65 degrees ?	Ques
1.4.3	Also , I know Intels slow down then eventually shut off ( I have a Pentium 4 in a laptop ) , but what happens to AMDs when they reach their max .	St
1.4.4	core temp ?	Ques
1.5.1	alright , an AMD AthlonXP or other K7 based chip , will just die if it hits it 's max ( which is higher than a Pentium 4 's ) while an Athlon64 will underclock itself and undervolt itself no matter what it 's temperatures are , assuming Cool'N'Quiet is enabled ( it 's to conserve power and produce less heat , if your gaming it runs at 100 % ability ) some Sempron 's are K7 based and some are K8 based ( K8 = Athlon64/Athlon64 FX ) I 'd also like to point out that overheat hot levels will kill the hardware when it reaches them , not just make it less reliable quite honestly your components should never be running at 40* C ( i 'm assuming you meant C , as 40* F will basically never happen in a computer case ) if your ambient is that temperature your CPU and GPU will be almost melting through the boards target CPU temperatures/ideal temperatures is between 30* C and 45* C depending on the chip Intel 's Prescott series of CPU 's wo n't be kept that those tempertuares underload , not easily , and I doubt Smithfield 's will be kept that those temperatures with out use of a liquid cooling system ambient in the case should be ambient in the room or maybe 1-2* C higher , if it 's more than 5* C over the room 's temperatures you need to consider changing cooling methods , or adding fans/cleaing out dust overall heat does not have an impact on stability , but definatly impacts reliability if you run a K7 at 50* C ( well inside it 's operational limits from AMD ) it will die faster than the same chip run at 35* C but we 're talking about starting with an initial reliablity of maybe 10 years or more , I have old machines from the early 1980 's that are still going strong so you might be looking at 7 years instead of 10 the reason they lose longetitivty is that higher heat can tend to make them slightly instable , so the motherboard will compensate by giving the chip a little more voltage ( that 's bad , it should not change unless you change it ) which again raises temperatures if your temperatures are very good , you can run under stock voltage and keep perfectly stable , I have done this with a Pentium 4 Willamette , running it at around 33* C with basic air cooling and no case , it was able to operate 100MHZ over stock with almost a .1v reduction ( that 's big ) stock for that chip is 1.75v , and I could stabilize it at 1.668 with slight fluctuation to 1.712 in short , keep it as cool as you can	St
1.6.1	I have found you to be very knowledgeable , but I 've got to say , your AMD temps sounds a little bizarre .	St
1.6.2	I have never used anything but AMD , never had a CPU temp of 40C unless I was freezing my a** off in that room .	St
1.6.3	A case temp of around 40C is desireable .	St
1.6.4	My CPU ( XP ) runs around 50C , depending on ambiant room temperature ( I live in Texas ) ( 46.8 right now ) .	St
1.6.5	Max temp ( from AMD ) is 85C , not 50C .	St
1.6.6	My original Athlon is still running strong at a friend 's across town .	St
1.6.7	With water-cooling , your post makes more sense .	St
1.6.8	FWIW chuck	St
1.7.1	i 've never owned water cooling , and my AthlonXP is running something between 37 and 41 depending on the loading ( 41 would be heavy gaming ) if your talking about use of the stock AMD HSF , yes i can undesrtand your temperatures , but i 'm talking about using a good HSF in addition to that , I stated the max temp was up there , it 's not 85 accross the board mind you , it varies from core to core , but 50* C is n't the best of temperatures for the K7	St
1.8.1	AMD than I am .	St
1.8.2	I am not using stock HSF .	St
1.8.3	My 50C+or- CPU temp and 36C case temp is in line with an optimum operating temp as per AMD .	St
1.8.4	XP3000+ .	St
1.8.5	I know I 'm where I need to be , just found your answer to the newbie a little curious .	St
1.8.6	Anyway .	St
1.8.7	chuck	St
1.9.1	Understand , I 'm trained and experienced in building and rebuilding many a PC .	St
1.9.2	Long before PCs were around , I maintained computer rooms and their pheriphals .	St
1.9.3	So , lets say , a PC is just a small computer to me .	St
1.9.4	Building anything requires you use common sense and DO N'T skip on the required decent and basic componets .	St
1.9.5	Overall , a generic system will last as long as the user puts typical demands on it .	St
1.9.6	If you expect it to last and you use in extreme conditionns , like dust , heat or humidity , forget it .	St
1.9.7	It still needs TLC and little cleaning now and then plus build a system that 's a good match , of decent power for installed componets and namebrands ones as well .	St
1.9.8	Cheap is cheap so do n't expect that not to bite you in the long run .	St
1.9.9	Tighten screws , do n't smash them and properly fit case with good cooling or add to it .	St
1.9.10	With all that in mind , yeah a homebuild is a good system .	St
1.9.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.10.1	... all ( 10 ) of them and my belief is the performance is superior because YOU control every app on the system , there are no crapware programs each vendor seems to love .	St
1.10.2	These apps ( utilities , support etc . )	St
1.10.3	usually run at startup and all utilize resources .	St
1.10.4	Your system is inherently cleaner .	St
1.10.5	Plus , system builders usually are n't configured EXACTLY like you want them , due to proprietary hardware .	St
1.10.6	If you 've never built a PC , try the & quot ; barebone & quot ; option first , it 's easier to be successful if somebody has already done the hardest part ( getting the front panel swithches & LEDs properly connected LOL ) .	St
1.10.7	You add Harddrive , RAM , OS , install optical drives & system drivers .	St
1.10.8	Processor installation & compatibility are insured .	St
1.10.9	Getting your hands on a how-to book or magazine article is helpful too .	St
1.10.10	A written , rehearsed procedure is called for when building any PC .	St
1.10.11	It 's like building a car motor , too , you always have that moment of excitement when you first press the & quot ; On & quot ; buton .	St
1.10.12	That feeling has n't gone away yet .	St
1.10.13	Have fun !	St
1.11.1	and i 'm also using an HSF that cost 50 % what the CPU itself cost with a 92MM fan pushing over 70CFM as for buildling it , a barebone is sort of a waste of money imo , because they usually include very cheap casing and motherboards buy the motherboard first , it 's manual will tell you how to install everything you need to install then just go down the list of what you need ( that 's one way you could do it , or you could just open the motherboard first )	Sug
1.12.1	NIL	St
1.13.1	I took everything apart except the CPU , floppy and cd drives , power .	St
1.13.2	Then , I put it back together and it worked .	St
1.13.3	I actually found some pictures that I did n't know that had existed .	St
1.13.4	I had a hard drive dillema which I fixed .	St
1.13.5	My question is : How hard is getting through BIOS and how much time should I expect spending in it to get everything working ?	Ques
1.14.1	It does n't even matter what you decide on for your 1st build- just do it !	St
1.14.2	Home-builds are like growing fresh veggies- it is n't always cheaper but what you end up with is better quality because it 's & quot ; your baby & quot ; .	St
1.14.3	Generally speaking , price = better quality- but there are deals to be had if you shop around .	St
1.14.4	A $ 50 motherboard can outlast a higher priced , overclocked & stressed rig .	St
1.14.5	It really depends on how it 's utilized .	St
1.14.6	I 'd say to build in the mid-range & then you 'll have a decent performer w/o breaking the bank .	St
1.14.7	Once you have that under your belt , what you 've learned will help immensely in your understanding of the parts buying & the build process itself .	St
1.14.8	BIOS is no secret society .	St
1.14.9	Remember that you can go in a screw around to your hearts content ( just seeing what options are available ) - if you exit without saving the changes- nothig has changed , you see ?	Ques
1.14.10	I 'd also recommend making changes one at a time & seeing the result .	St
1.14.11	Changing too many at once makes it difficult to troubleshoot if the effect is not what you expected .	St
1.14.12	Good luck !	Polite
1.14.13	T	St
1.15.1	Build your own computer , the factory ones are no better than you can do yourself .	St
1.15.2	I have purchased my name brand computers and then were not that good .	St
1.15.3	When they become outdated you end up replacing the complete system .	St
1.15.4	The best selling computer maker left me with sour taste and their tech support was so so .	St
1.15.5	I guess any one 's harddrive can fail and video card and cd drives .	St
1.15.6	But all in one system was to much .	St
1.15.7	Plus you do n't get an operating system you get a backup of the orginal system as you bought or were shipped .	St
1.15.8	With your own system you have options not available to you as would had you bought a name brand computer .	St
1.15.9	Running Windows XP has make my systems run very smooth .	St
1.15.10	I say go for it , for it is a learning thing that will teach you much more than you can know .	St
1.16.1	You ca n't go wrong building your own , and CNET can help with all the info available from all the users .	St
1.16.2	I built one about 3 years ago , never crashes .	St
1.16.3	1.6G PIV , 40gig HDD , 512mb RAM,64mb video .	St
1.16.4	Nothing really outstanding , just satisfying knowing I did it .	St
1.17.1	I agree with earlier posts - buy good hardware and make sure to read about it first to avoid problems .	St
1.17.2	Make sure you get the lastest drivers and bios updates .	St
1.17.3	Install carefully and take your time .	St
1.17.4	It all matters .	St
1.17.5	But the biggest plus of doing your own is that you get a clean install without the bloatware that manufacturers install .	St
1.17.6	You do n't have to uninstall the trial versions of LOTS of programs that you do n't want .	St
1.17.7	A leaner , cleaner computer runs better longer .	St
1.17.8	One final piece of advice : after you get your nice clean install , back it all up .	St
1.17.9	Use a program like Ghost so you can apply that image to a new hard drive should the unmentionable ( crash of your OS drive ) occur .	St
1.17.10	You spend a lot of time loading programs - back it up !	St
1.18.1	I have built many aytems for my friends & family .	St
1.18.2	The reason is simple .	St
1.18.3	I do n't like priortized machines , do n't llike paying high prices for outdated equipment & do like picking my own hardware .	St
1.18.4	For First Timers I suggest for ease & peace of mind , you go the easy route .	St
1.18.5	Buy a barebones system from Multiwave Direct .	St
1.18.6	http : //www.mwave.com/mwave/main.hmx ?	Ques
1.18.7	This url will take you directly to the catalog .	St
1.18.8	A bare bones system includes case , power supply , motherboard , cpu , & memory .	St
1.18.9	They assemble these items for you & work upon arrival ( shipping usually 3-4 days ) .	St
1.18.10	You still need to decide which of the motherboards you want from a drop down list , how much memory , etc .	St
1.18.11	Do n't forget an Operating System if you do n't have one .	Sug
1.18.12	Sugggest you buy at least 1GB of mem .	St
1.18.13	Processors are spendy for the latest\greatest & you can save $ by purchasing a step or 2 back .	St
1.18.14	They have both AMD & Intel based systems .	St
1.18.15	Order additional items like : Monitor , hard drive ( s ) , burners , dvd/cd players , floppy , sound card , video card , cables , mouse , keyboard , additional cooling as desired , etc .	St
1.18.16	You will find individual items have many choices & sometimes have a package deal .	St
1.18.17	Most higher end motherboards come with built-in items like ethernet , sound & video .	St
1.18.18	I prefer to use my own sound & video ( although current sound included has improved greatly ) .	St
1.18.19	The built-in 's can be disabled from cmos & the mobo manual will explain how to do this .	St
1.18.20	It is easy .	St
1.18.21	Gamers require top notch video , compare ATI & Nvidia cards .	St
1.18.22	If this is still too much for you , for a small fee , they will assemble & test all required items for you .	St
1.18.23	Resulting in a custom designed unit ready to run upon arrival .	St
1.18.24	Once you are more comfortable with building a system you can order everything separately & do it all .	St
1.18.25	Sirzak	St
1.19.1	Just some advice I found to be of use when building your own pc .	St
1.19.2	Make sure cpu is correct type and speed for the mb you pick .	St
1.19.3	cpu speed and buss speed .	St
1.19.4	Buy the highest quality memory and do not mix brands or types of memory .	St
1.19.5	Matched memory from the same mfg is the best if you use more than one memory board .	St
1.19.6	Always check mb manual for correct installation of memory .	Sug
1.19.7	Check all mfg web sites for current info on installing there products , cpu site especially .	St
1.19.8	I believe building your own is the only way to go , especially for gamers .	St
1.19.9	Good Luck	St
1.20.1	computer ... .my first one , ten years ago or more .	St
1.20.2	NEVER again .	St
1.20.3	My systems have all been built by me , and my current system is over a year old and is only rebooted when MS updates or some other software installation program does it automatically .	St
1.20.4	Right now it has n't been rebooted in well over a month when I was troubleshooting a problem that turned out to be my harddrive actually getting too warm due to weather temps soaring here so even with extra cooling inside the case and having the sides off , it was still too warm under the desk where the tower is located .	St
1.20.5	Once I turned on my air conditioning , the problem resolved itself .	St
1.20.6	I do n't have spyware as not only do I have two programs installed to check for it , I also use common sense about where I travel on the net .	St
1.20.7	I use an up to date anti-virus program .	St
1.20.8	I keep my XP Pro updated , but download those updates manually and install when I decide to and not MS .	St
1.20.9	I do lots of video 'work ' on the system so I have a good video card and sound card .	St
1.20.10	Three harddrives , over a gig of RAM , two burner devices ( one dvd and one cdr-w ) , a powersupply that is somewhere around 550 Watts , and a P4 processor that is over a year old and probably way outdated by now but still going strong .	St
1.20.11	And I have many programs installed that I use on a regular basis for Office , Video Editing/copying/viewing from my vcr and digital camera as well as an 8-track , a cassette player , and a turntable to bring my old music to the cd format .	St
1.20.12	Using this system nearly nonstop 24/7 for well over a year now has never once brought about a crash of the system ... ..that 's not to say I have n't had to trouble shoot a program that does n't want to work/install/uninstall properly or drivers that have gone that same route when being installed or updated , but no blue screens and very , very few if any errors as I 've booted up ( and even those errors did n't prevent the system from booting to the desktop and were resolved quickly ) .	St
1.20.13	I am a firm believer in getting to know the 'quirks ' of your system and how to either work around them or find a permanent resolution to something new that shows up that you know it was n't doing ten minutes ago or yesterday .	St
1.20.14	I 've never done a system restore ... I personally think that going back does n't teach you much and I 'd rather learn how to fix it rather than throw up my hands in defeat and turn back time .	St
1.20.15	To each their own .	St
1.20.16	And BACK UP EVERYTHING YOU DO N'T WANT TO LOSE ... ... sooner or later you will be in a situation that calls for reinstalling and/or starting from scratch , whether it 's a virus that hits you , a harddrive that dies suddenly , or something else that you are thinking & quot ; not me ... that stuff happens to other people & quot ; .	St
1.20.17	Remember , YOU are the 'other people ' people like ME are thinking about ... ..just like I am one of those 'other people ' that YOU are thinking about .	St
1.20.18	Save yourself ... .or cry in your beer .	Sug
1.20.19	Think about that vehicle oil/service station commercial & quot ; pay me now or pay me later & quot ; and make it your motto when it comes to computers .	St
1.20.20	But ... .I 'll take a homebuilt/custom built system that you literally have control over right down to the installation disks instead of restore/recovery disks any day of the week .	St
1.20.21	It 's YOUR money and YOUR entertainment ... .invest in it wisely .	St
1.20.22	TONI	St
1.21.1	You do n't need to understand all that is in cmos .	St
1.21.2	Assuming you have the mobo 's manual , read through setting up cmos .	St
1.21.3	Do the recommended settings first .	St
1.21.4	Then set for hardware you have ( like raid ) or disable things you do n't use ( like serial\paralell ports , built in sound\video ) .	St
1.21.5	Then experiment with items you are less certain about .	St
1.21.6	Suggest you change only one item at a time , save & exit .	St
1.21.7	DO NOT make lots of changes at one time as it is difficult to troubleshoot which ones are not to your liking .	St
1.21.8	If it works well , try the next item of prefference .	St
1.21.9	If it does n't work , go back & reset it as original or try another choice .	St
1.21.10	It is a good idea to write down what you change , as it is easy to forget what you changed or which heading it was under .	St
1.21.11	Cross off things that do n't work & in the end you will compile a list of optimum settings .	St
1.21.12	This can take many hours if you try everything .	St
1.21.13	Some things set incorrectly will not allow the system to fire up or render some features inoperable while the system fires up in appearent working order .	St
1.21.14	TIP : If ever you find your system was working ok & later ( on fire up ) it changes settings itself , replace the battery , reset cmos to your prefferences .	St

1.22.1	About two years ago , my son gave me an empty case for mother 's day because I 'd always wanted to build my own computer .	St
1.22.2	I had added memory , hard drives , CD drives , etc. , but never built one from scratch .	St
1.22.3	I researched on the internet and read books , then went out and bought the parts that I knew I wanted .	St

1.23.1	as bright as Ozos is he seems to toally ignore all the thermal data that Intel and AMD provide in the technical papers they make available to download .	St
1.23.2	Ozos is a knowledgweable and avid gamer , and is apparently used to striving to keep the temps down to low levels which are totally unnecessary for the other everyday users .	St
1.23.3	Intel , now with their retail box CPU 's include a sheet of paper saying to keep the interior ambient in the vicinity of the HSF to 38C or below .	St
1.23.4	They design the retail heat sink and fan to have about a thermal coefficient of 0.3 Degees C per watt when at max power dissipation.. Use those numbers to calculate the temp for a CPU that dissipates 80 watts .	St
1.23.5	I see no sign that anyone has bothered to read such info .	St
1.24.1	the P4 laptop was just a reference right , b/c if you 're building your own laptop , then it 's recommended that u do n't .	St
1.24.2	Cheaper and better off to have that prebuilt	St
1.25.1	Could n't be any worse off than prebuilts for sure if done correctly , and this is n't too difficult .	St
1.25.2	Just a few humps u need to note when following self assembly guides .	St
1.25.3	The only real reasons to buy a prebuilt are : & gt ; it 's cheaper -it 's cheaper to get a low end dell like a dimension 3000 ( $ 450 ) than to build your own equivalent ( difficult unless u use cheap parts and reuse software ) -U can get online coupons for $ 750 off certain dell systems or 40 % off whole systems from places like techbargain.com & gt ; u want warranty -those who are n't tech savy or do n't have time to learn -for peace of mind for those who really could troubleshoot their own problems & gt ; no time to do so -let others build your PC if u work 80 hour weeks and juggle 4+ kids -ca n't make 20+ PCs on your own for company -u 'd rather use the time for other sutff	St

1.28.5	My care is that you IMHO needlessly are scaring the everyday user that who no way stresses the system .	St
1.28.6	If Intel will give the three year warranty at 75 C , then I feel that running at 50 C gives a huge margin , such as 8 to 10 years .	St
1.28.7	BTW what is the the naturally occuring failure mode of a CPU chip that has no latent defects from amufacturing ? ?	Ques
1.28.8	You input is absolutely excellent when oclocking and power gaming gets involved .	St
1.29.1	Generally a Home built System is VERY reliable Why ?	Ques
1.29.2	the Hardware is handpicked for Reliabilty and Features also an Experienced System builder can take a Few Days to Reaserch , gather materials and assemble .	St
1.29.3	( most Shops put a system together in under 2 Hours )	St
1.30.1	I have built a dozen systems over the years and have learned one important lesson : do n't buy dirt cheap components !	St
1.30.2	I remember some motherboards from ECS that would work -- sort of .	St
1.30.3	And then there were some memory modules that were flaky and caused random reboots .	St
1.30.4	However , my last two self-built systems use ASUS motherboards and higher end memory ( with AMD CPUs ) and have been running flawlessly for months .	St
1.30.5	Basic rule of data processing : GIGO ( garbage in , garbage out ) .	St
1.30.6	This applies to hardware too !	St
1.31.1	I have three computers , 2 that I have built , one from Dell , bought 5 years ago , been upgraded .	St
1.31.2	By the way it is still running with Linux .	St
1.31.3	My workhorse , used for editing movies is : Motherboard Abit IC7-G MAX-II , P4 2.66ghzHT , 1gig of ram , GeForce 4 6200 , AGP 8X , 256MB XFX video card .	St
1.31.4	The gaming machine is an Asus P4B533 with a P4 2.66ghz , 1 gig of RAM , Asus V8200 Geforce 3 video card , thinking of upgrading card , the motherboard does n't support 8X .	St
1.31.5	Bought it around 4 years ago , hefty price $ 382.00 .	St
1.31.6	Like it though .	St
1.31.7	The case is a Dragon Achilles , blue in color , lights , fans , etc..	St
1.31.8	Being a 63 year old geek , friends come to me for help in building theirs .	St
1.31.9	They are costly , then again it depends on what you want your computer to do , if it is surfing , e-mail , I tell them buy a Compaq or a Dell .	St
1.31.10	Angel	St
1.32.1	Reliablity of homebuilt computer depends on the components you use inside .	St
1.32.2	I 'd recommend not going cheap anywhere , but do n't go too expensive either .	St
1.32.3	Do some research on each part you are going to buy , and post back if you need help choosing your parts .	St
1.32.4	Though , expect a long argument between users on certain parts being better than the other If you 've already had a previous desktop computer , then it 's about time that you learned how to make your own .	St
1.32.5	Nothing beats the feeling of building something by yourself , especially when it 's done You might screw up here and there , but hey , we all make mistakes .	St
1.32.6	But we learn from them .	St
1.32.7	In the future , consider this : - A few notebook manufacturers make & quot ; whitebox notebooks & quot ; that allow a user to assemble his/her own notebook .	St
1.32.8	It 's not fully customizable like a desktop , but you can change the video card , processor , hard drive , cd drive , RAM , and the card in the miniPCI slot .	St
1.32.9	Yes , even the video card is upgradeable : just look for such notebooks with MXM slots .	St
1.33.1	I am gearing up to build my first computer and I would be very grateful for any known tutorial or magazine article that will give me the necessary steps in helping me put together my homebuilt system .	St
1.33.2	Can you suggest any particular articles or tutorials which will guide me step-by-step ?	Ques
1.33.3	TIA	St
1.34.1	I seem to have noticed that noone has mentioned partitioning the drive on a home built , to maintain a stable pc i always put the os on its own partition and then anything installed or downloaded goes to a seperate partition , Makes life a lot easier .	St
1.34.2	Great thread ...	Polite
1.35.1	I have found that , generally , it 's not the hardware itself that has reliablity/stability issues .	St
1.35.2	However , I have found that certain SOFTWARE can conflict and cause massive reliability/stability problems !	St
1.35.3	It takes certain quality and types of hardware to be able to do certain things .	St
1.35.4	For instance , the difference between doing a lot of sound work vs. doing a lot of graphics work or doing BOTH such as with games .	St
1.35.5	There are all kinds of sound and graphics cards to choose from for those purposes .	St
1.35.6	Just as there is a lot of other different hardwares for other purposes .	St
1.35.7	Simply build your computer with components that will best support what you will do with it . : ) ...	St
1.35.8	AND MAKE DOUBLE SURE THE DEALER YOU BUY YOUR PARTS FROM IS REPUTABLE AND OFFERS/HONORS GOOD WARRENTEES ! ! !	St
1.35.9	I 've been stung just a couple of times trying to cut co $ t $ which only CO $ T MORE $ M-O-N-E-Y $ and TIME in the long run .	St
1.35.10	; )	St
1.36.1	All in all I would have to say - build your own .	St
1.36.2	Reason being , generally you will have a budget so you will get the best you can afford .	St
1.36.3	You should have reason for putting this system together ie : gaming .	St
1.36.4	If it is then you would concentrate on the best video card , followed by the largest amount of hard drive space .	St
1.36.5	Here in New Zealand we can purchase swap kits , that is a motherboard , processor and matched RAM so that everything matches for reasonable prices , again you would select the processor for your end use .	St
1.36.6	For me it 's Pentuim for Multimedia work and AMD for gaming .	St
1.36.7	Hope this helps .	St
1.36.8	Bob	St
1.37.1	Here is an excellent article on how to build a computer .	St
1.37.2	http : //www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/homegrown/index.html I am an avid gamer and I too believe in only building computers .	St
1.37.3	I would take the time to purchase everything and just set aside about four hours to assemble the computer and load it up with an operating system	St
1.38.1	Without a doubt home grown PC 's are more stable and tend to last quite a while longer than off the shelf and assembly line manufactured units .	St
1.38.2	Well , if the person who builds it does their homework properly .	St
1.38.3	Many of the uninitiated find that there is a whole lot more to making a PC work than buying a bunch of parts that fit nicely together and they run for the hills !	St
1.38.4	But what frightens them off ?	Ques
1.38.5	Well , for starters , in my experiences it 's been three initial issues that must be resolved before they take the plunge and begin their research : what do you expect this thing to do ; what OS are you going to or want run ; and how many Dead Presidents can you spend ?	Ques
1.38.6	If that does n't scare 'em off they find that building a PC requires serious research .	St
1.38.7	They find out real quick , fast and in a hurry that this PC building stuff requires more reading than they had to do at school ; more math than what they bargained for and at a level that they 're not willing to explore ( hexadecimal and binary ) even though there are but a few simple formulas that one has to remember ; and in order to keep from unnecessarily wiping out their funds they have to know or learn how to compare prices of items they think they may want to purchase before buying them .	St
1.38.8	Of course this is but a glimpse of what all it takes , but you knew this , huh ?	Ques
1.38.9	What ever the case , that 's not the question at hand .	St
1.38.10	The question is if or not a PC that I built some years ago that happens to have an Everex motherboard ( remember them ? )	Ques
1.38.11	with an 83 MHz OverDrive Processor and a huge 64 MB ( 30 AND 72 pin SIMMS ) of RAM on the board , with an EISA Bus architecture , which means that only ISA cards fit because PCI slots were working on becoming a reality ; that I run IBM OS/2 WARP 4 on today ; stood the test of time ?	Ques
1.38.12	I say ummm hummm .	St
1.38.13	For sure !	St
1.38.14	And then there is the Intel 266 MHz system I built for my mom ( man , we were really starting to zoom back then ! )	St
1.38.15	that 's just sitting in the corner in the back in the dark , gathering dust ... she has a Dell Inspiron 8200 these days .	St
1.38.16	I 'm thinking seriously about using as a firewall an Intel 350 MHz system I built a few years ago since I do Red Hat on it .	St
1.38.17	I could interface my latest build ( about two years ago ?	Ques
1.38.18	) , an Intel 2.2 GHz system with 800 MHz Bus and 2 GB of Ram Bus RAM , etceteras , and do the wireless Pre-N thing with my Dell XPS slaptop .	St
1.38.19	In contrast to all of that , I bought my sister a Dell desktop system in 2002 for a wedding gift .	St
1.38.20	Today I 'm trying to determine if the motherboard is sick , or the video is kaput or if the CPU should be eulogized .	St
1.38.21	Go figure .	St
1.38.22	Software crashes seldom have anything to do with hardware crashes unless one has cut too many corners and is in fact utilizing hardware that is not compatible with the OS or other installed programs .	St
1.38.23	Heck , my Dell XPS SlapTop crashed a few months ago and I use WinXP Pro on it !	St
1.38.24	I guess WinXP Pro got mad or something or another .	St
1.38.25	But , one can not deny the cold hard fact ''you get the sort of performance you pay for '' .	St
1.38.26	Right ?	Ques
1.38.27	Yes , home grown PC 's are where it 's at !	St
1.39.1	How does this contribute to the thread ?	Ques
1.39.2	You typed all of that for what purpose because surely it was not to answer the question .	St
1.40.1	RobD , you say that PC building requires both hex and binary math .	St
1.40.2	I worked for a small OEM and I built a few dozen computers , and I never used math .	St
1.40.3	I can see if you are overclocking or whatnot , but not every builder wants to overclock and tweak settings .	St
1.40.4	Building a computer is n't that hard , just plug the cables from one device intto where they fit on the other device .	St
1.40.5	( yes , I know it is over simplified ) .	Res
