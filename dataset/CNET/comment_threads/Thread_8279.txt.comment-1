My new system I built has a Shuttle AN35N Ultra 400 system board with an AMD 2400+ processor, 2 Gig speed.
After getting it running I noticed in Device Manager the processor was shown as AMD 1800+ with a 1.4 Gig processor.
After a phone call to the store where I bought it I changed the FSB from 100 MHz to 133 MHz, and the listing went to 2400+, speed 2.0 Gig.
Now it's showing correctly, running like a top.
Can overclocking be this simple?
Change the FSB speed?
Not that I want to experiment, but if the FSB speed is increased, will the processor speed increase?
I do have more options.
Thanks.
