1.1.1	I would like to find out if the USB ports on my Toshiba Satellite 5205-S503 can power a portable storage device such as the Lacie Porche mobile hard drive ( 80 GB 5400 rpm ) .	St
1.1.2	I looked in devices & found only the manufacturer ( NEC ) & the driver version ( 5.1.2600 ) .	St
1.1.3	I 'm it is US .	St
1.1.4	B 2.0 .	St
1.1.5	Short of calling the manufacturer how do I find out ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thank-you	St
1.2.1	USB 1.x or 2.0 's power is 500 milliAmps and every laptop drive I see listed 1.0 to 1.5 Amperes .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	You can get ab optional AC adapter with that product .	St
1.3.2	Adaptec has an enclosure for 2.5 & quot ; hard disk drives that pull power from two USB ports or an optional AC adapter .	St
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Agree with Bob , however that drive is sold as a USB/Firewire external so there are two possibilities .	St
1.4.2	You can try a USB splitter cable that has two plugs that plug into two of yourusb ports and deliver the sum of the two ports ' output to your device .	St
1.4.3	I have been using this arrangement for over a year with no problems.However in the event that your laptop ca n't put out enough juice you can get a very small USB adapter that you connect to one of the cable branches while the other plugs into your computer for data transfer .	St
1.4.4	I think you 'll find the first arrangement will work for you as an inexpensive approach Regards Seewart	St
