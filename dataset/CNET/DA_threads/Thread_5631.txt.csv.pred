1.1.1	I have a HP 4315 ALL-IN-ONE printer..... and it seems to be stuck on FAX.	St
1.1.2	When ever I try to print something it goes to the fax settings and not the printing settings... and I have no idea why...	St
1.1.3	I don't fax things, ever(its not set up to fax).	St
1.1.4	I turned it on today and it says fax on the little LCD... where it should say print.	St
1.1.5	Anyone have this printer or know what to do?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.1.7	I've tried restarting it... nothing.	St
1.1.8	There are no actual buttons either to enable printing, it should be the default setting.	St
1.1.9	However, if I want to Fax, Scan, or Copy, there are buttons for those.	St
1.2.1	Mods can delete.	St
