I have a Vista PC and have attached a samsung ML-1740 (USB) laser printer to it.
Vista found the device, and installed drivers for it.
It completed with no errors, and Vista says it is ready for use.
When I try and print to it, it fails to print with no real specific message.
Printing a test page from control panel, simply says &quot;Test page failed to print.
Would you like to view the troubleshooter for assistance&quot;.
I have deleted the printer, downloaded newest samsung drivers and installed again...still no go even though control panel says the printer is &quot;ready&quot;.
any suggestions would be appreciated.
