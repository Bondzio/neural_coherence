<s> Epson has had archival priter ink for several years. </s>
<s> I find that they will not recycle used cartridges w/o a $5 - $10 fee! </s>
<s> (outrageous) Anyway, HP seems to have a fairly fade proof ink but I can't get &quot;Vivera&quot; ink for my printer. </s>
<s> I use a Photosmart C5580 and use 75XL and 74XL. </s>
<s> Has anyone an opinion on the ink and it's permanance? </s>
<s> Have you found the color to be fade proof??? </s>

<s> I just go to Staples and hand them back in for their bucks. </s>
<s> As to fade proof. </s>
<s> Isn't that fade &quot;resistant&quot;? </s>
<s> I'm seen claims of fade proof but after putting such in the Arizona desert sun for 5 years it did fade. </s>
<s> Also, the paper matters too. </s>
<s> But you can research more about low acid or acid free/neutralized papers. </s>

<s> Will Staples take Epson empties?? </s>
<s> Office Max says that only ink empties with &quot;heads&quot;? </s>
<s> can be recycled. </s>
<s> Epsons don't have that configuation. </s>
<s> If Staples will take my Epsons, I will give them all of my business. </s>
<s> You're right about the fade 'proof'. </s>
<s> Only resistant can be expected. </s>
<s> Years ago, only Epson had long lasting ink. </s>
<s> The old photos printed with my old HP faded within a week, but their newer inks are almost fadeless. </s>
<s> Thanks for the response. </s>
