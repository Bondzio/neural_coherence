i've had the 'clicking problem' in the past, myself.
i found that the drive wasn't getting enough electricity.
if it has an external electric plug, you might take it out of the surge/power strip and plug it directly into the wall.
if that works, you might want to buy a 'travel-type' surge protector (very small) and see if it will continue to work with that.
