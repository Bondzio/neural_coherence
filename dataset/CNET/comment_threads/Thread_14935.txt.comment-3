Thanks for that suggestion.
I have already done a bit of looking at how others are building.
Copying someone else's build without knowing how they work might not be applicable to solving my issues.
This is the reason that I have described my current use (window overload) and mentioned my current computer.
The decison for me is whether to try to improve the 4600 or to build a new one on the expectation that faster and more ram, and the duo core cpu, added to the ability to use the Diamond card (the 4600 only has PCI, not PCI Express slots).
One reason I thought to build my own is that I have the video card, extra CD and DVD writers, ATA hard drives, an Antec 500 watt PSU and case, so the main ingredients needed are only mobo, cpu, and ram.
One question here is whether SATA hdds would be helpful in dealing with my needs.
(The 4600 does have SATA connectors on the mobo, BTW.)
Any thoughts appreciated.
