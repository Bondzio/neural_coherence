i needed it for telecommuting in 1991. my first computer was bought at fedco (remember fedco?)
anyway it cost about $2,500.
it had a 15&quot; monitor, 5.25&quot; floppy and 3.5&quot; disc drive (the latest in storage) and two speakers attached to the monitor.
it ran on dos and had a graphic user interface but that's all i remember.
i still have it in the garage (but at the moment i'm not sure where the speakers went).
