but mostly about how many amperes a pin can carry.
this is why more than two wires are needed and more than one connection because the amperes exceed that of a pin, a connector and so on.
your choice on the psu but my advice is to go with single rail power supplies unless you know how to figure out what's on each rail, how many amperes is being drawn on each rail, etc.
most folk do not want to go that deep.
hence, single rail and at least 50% over the minimum.
