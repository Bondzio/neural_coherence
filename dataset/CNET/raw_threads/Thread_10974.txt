Thank you all in advance!

If the CD/DVD drives do not show up in Explorer, it's not due to these drivers but something else. Tell more and try this article. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060 Bob

Grandson's Mom is helpless with comp and I am just a touch more able, lol...but not much where this area is concerned! (Grandson is autistic, and if he knows, he isn't sharing!) Grandson's comp is a Compaq Preasio with windows xp home edition service pack 2
