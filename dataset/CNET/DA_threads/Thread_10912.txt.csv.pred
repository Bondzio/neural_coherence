1.1.1	I know for a fact that the laptop I 'm about to purchase 1 ) takes a desktop processor and 2 ) says it can only take a Wolfdale Intel Core 2 Duo only up to 2.66ghz .	St
1.1.2	Right now , I could either spend on Newegg $ 164.99 for the Wolfdale Core 2 Duo 2.66ghz E8200 or spend five bucks more $ 169.99 for an E8400 which is 3.0ghz .	St
1.1.3	Just as for as pricing goes , it makes a lot more sense to spend the extra five bucks for the faster one .	St
1.1.4	Also , I could very well use it in a different computer in the future in which case its full potential would be used .	St
1.1.5	Can I use the 3.0ghz cpu without damaging anything even though the specs for the laptop/motherboard say it only goes up to 2.66 ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks as always !	St
1.2.1	for some reason , I was looking at Wolfdale instead of Conroe .	St
1.2.2	So , same question , but Conroe not Wolfdale .	St
1.2.3	the E8200 and E8400 is n't right either	St
1.3.1	the bios may not handle other processors and the laptop 's cooling may not be able to cope with processors with higher tdp .	St
1.4.1	I thought cooling might be an issue , but that deal for the faster processor just looked so enticing .	St
1.5.1	Do n't fret .	St
1.5.2	Your laptop *might* have some settings in its BIOS for overclocking .	St
1.5.3	If so , those desktop Core 2 Duos do quite well with overclocking , at least in desktops In a laptop , you 'll want to be VERY careful - use one of those laptop cooling pads with the fans in it , increase the front-side bus speed very gradually , and only have it overclocked when you 've got the machine plugged into the mains .	St
1.5.4	And do whatever you can to keep the air going into the laptop cool as well , i.e .	St
1.5.5	no direct sunlight , and air-con .	St
