1.1.1	I need help choosing between two great cards made by ati .	St
1.1.2	It is between the x850 and the x1600xt .	St
1.1.3	I have heard that the x1600xt is the way to go but i still need help deciding.I am building a computer now with the DFI rdx200 cf-dr motherboard , 1gb of ddr memory , amd 4000+ , 120 gig hard drive used to play games fast .	St
1.2.1	the x850xt is the faster card but lacks SM3 features ( like HDR ) .	St
1.2.2	however , those features require quite a bit of graphics horsepower , and they 're of little use on mid-range ( like the x1600xt ) or low-end cards since if you turn on SM3 features , frame rates drop so low as to make the game unplayable .	St
1.2.3	here are benchmarks for both : http : //www23.tomshardware.com/graphics.html ? modelx=33 & model1=310 & model2=304 & chart=94 therefore , i suggest the x850xt over the x1600xt .	St
1.2.4	if you can afford a few dollars more , an nvidia 7600gt is a better choice ... comparable speed to x850xt and SM3 features .	St
1.2.5	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814121004	Ques
1.3.1	The cheapest X850XT is $ 164 on newegg.com .	St
1.3.2	The cheapest 7600GT is $ 149 on newegg.com ( after a $ 10 mail-in rebate . )	St
1.3.3	I know which one I 'd get .	St
1.4.1	The only problem is tha newegg does not ship to Canada !	St
1.5.1	here are links to a radeon x800gto2 ( $ 199 CAD + shipping ) and a geforce 7600gt ( $ 230 CAD + shipping ) from a canadian web shop .	St
1.5.2	the x800gto2 can be soft-modded to an x850xt .	St
1.5.3	it 's painless ( i have one and have done the mod myself . )	St
1.5.4	X800GTO2 : http : //www.pccanada.com/viewitem.asp ? id=3967 7600GT : http : //www.pccanada.com/viewitem.asp ? id=4446	Ques
1.6.1	If you know anyone who lives in the US of A , ask them to purchase it for you .	St
1.6.2	Once they receive it , ask them to send it to you via UPS .	St
1.6.3	If you do n't know anyone from the US of A , find another website that ships to Canada .	St
