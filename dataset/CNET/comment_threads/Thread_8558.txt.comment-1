I have a Compaq Presario desktop that won't start-up.
When you push the power button the lights come on and the monitor stays in the sleep mode.
I was told that the motherboard or processor were bad.
So, I purchased a new Abit VA-10 motherboard and Athlon XP processor.
I installed both items, and the computer still has the same problem.
Please help!!
What else could be wrong with the computer?
