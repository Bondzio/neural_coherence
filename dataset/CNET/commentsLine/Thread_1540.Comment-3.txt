are the newest out there, i would also assume that the voltage for both is compatible.....however, that assumption got me into trouble with a 'new' video card by nvidia that actually wasn't compatible and the only way i knew was because the video on screen actually was doing weird things that i didn't expect to see after booting up and even using the newest drivers for it.
a friend i mentioned it to hit on the problem immediately and when i swapped the card for a different one, i had no problems anymore.
so check the manual for both the card and the mobo to make sure they actually match up in that direction.
something else, since i'm not familiar with your video card.....are there separate fans on it that need to be hooked up to the motherboard or power supply?
if there are and you didn't plug them in, the card may have a setting internally to not fire up without cooling in place in order to protect itself.
also...is your card a regular agp or is it agp-pro type?
there is an extra little notch at the end of the slot for an agp-pro that has a coverplate over it, and if you remove it and your card is an agp type instead, it doesn't use that notch, but the card won't work until you cover that notch up again, so check to make sure the coverplate hasn't fallen off and you just didn't notice it.
