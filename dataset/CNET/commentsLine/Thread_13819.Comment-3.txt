i know all about &quot;os problems&quot; hehe this whole thing started from my os got screwed up and then hp recovery discs didnt work, it turns out that microsoft doesnt like when you change your computer parts =(.
at keast microsoft didnt put in a chip in every motherboard to bypass the bios like apple did.
ive tried putting mac on my pc.
mac has like 2 million lines of code and ms has 60 million and counting so mac has a more stable os.
i really don't even like ms much at all.
i recommend a mzc to anyone who isnt a hardcore gamer.
so many problems with ms and all.
anyway i need a driver for my pci card to wark so i can resume watching tv on my pc again or i can just buy a new pvr card and get frustrated =(.
