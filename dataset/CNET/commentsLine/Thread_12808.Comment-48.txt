i am in australia, i had a 9 yr old computer, a number of upgrades inc 2 hard disks, 7 gig,original, 20 gig and a 320 poetable.
it would not handle adsl2.
new one, custom built from gr-tek comps,liverpool, sydney.
it has all the bells and whistles which as yet i have not worked all out, did i really need them?.
inc tv.
goes great, flamming fast.
use avg anti virus etc.
its great but again i will probably never use some of the stuff on it.
