<s> We have an older Compaq laptop connected to an NEC 860 Superscript printer. </s>
<s> When you go to print, the little printer icon flashes on very briefly on the taskbar and then it disappears-and printer doesn't print. </s>
<s> In the device manager, the message indicates that the printer is working properly (but it isn't). </s>
<s> Anybody have this problem and what have you done to solve problem? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> PS OS is Win 98. </s>
<s> The last time this sort of thing happened it was a dead printer port. </s>
<s> The owner paid dearly as I charged them for the priviledge of a lesson in electronics, schematics, parallel interfaces and the use of an oscilloscope as well as the loopback parallel port tester. </s>
<s> Not that I didn't mind, but they wanted &quot;proof&quot; the parallel port was dead. </s>
<s> It was only 100 for the hour, but they were not so upset but that the laptop parallel port is only repaired by changing the motherboard... That's one possibility. </s>
<s> You would also install printer drivers, try other printer cables, try another printer and if you have a LAN, try to print over a network to avoid the cost of a new motherboard. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>

<s> An USB to parallel printer cable. </s>
<s> I picked up one for 20 bucks at a store to solve this issue. </s>
