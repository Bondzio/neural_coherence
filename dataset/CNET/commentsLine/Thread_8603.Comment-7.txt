thanks that is interesting.
the tablet was bought for a few reasons - one being that my wife could check the bank statements and plan the months expenses from anywhere in the house and use it to keep some of the photographs on it.
the app dslr controller works very well on this tablet and helpful in getting the lighting right on ceramic pieces that my wife makes.
as for the lense idea - your approach is definitely a good idea.
for the price and weight (with keyboard) maybe a small powerful laptop would have been better.
