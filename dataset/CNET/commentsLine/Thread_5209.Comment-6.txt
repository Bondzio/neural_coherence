in a similar vein, i recently posted the below limerick: samsung's lcds made me ill, epoxies outgassed like to kill!
strong phosphors so silent they seemed quite non-violent... yet proved worse than some poisoned pill!
(i'd also included another re: samsung printers - btw, those printers come loaded with chemicals too - the chinese don't outgas their goods which then piles up a nightmare of chemicals in this country.
in the book invisibledisease by nordstrom, it explains that when machines warm up, chemicals outgas and can be absorbed by the human body which then react to emfs (such as emfs of &quot;light&quot;).
like a vicious cycle.
