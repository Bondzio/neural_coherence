...unless you're seriously expert in your technical understanding of the windows registry - say, one in one hundred windows users sort of *expert*.
i would not recommend messing with your windows registry at all, unless you're *expert*.
items like ccleaner, registry cleaner and similar have caused more blue screens of death (*bsod*) for windows users than any other product class that i know of.
if you want to get rid of the *gunk* from your system that windows builds in the temp files / folders, browser caches, etc, try *atf cleaner* from  but because your system is running noticeably slow, it probably has little to do with some accumulated junk that needs cleaning.
the problem - short of a system infection, which others have addressed here - might probably be a hardware-related one.
contact your manufacturer (hp, dell, lenovo, etc) with the problem or go to their website.
most of the big manufacturers have system / hardware diagnostics programs and driver update programs for each machine they built.
run these diagnostics programs and make the needed updates recommended on their site.
if the machine's still running far too slow after getting your needed and recommended oem updates, you have to decide whether it's smarter to send it in for repair for whatever they'll charge or whether it's smarter to put it off to the side and invest in a new system.
