1.1.1	So I've been shopping around for a desktop to replace my old laptop and at first I was looking at Newegg, which lead to ibuyPower (I'd like a custom build) but after reading the reviews on ibuyPower I was hesitant to go with them.	St
1.1.2	One of the reviews suggested Ironside Computers.	St
1.1.3	So I went to their website and poked around bit, they seem reputable, although there were a few warning signs that went up.	St
1.1.4	First, under Testimonials, there were only 5.	St
1.1.5	Total.	St
1.1.6	Second, there was only one entry on Resellerratings.com Third, I haven't been able to find any quality discussion about the company on-line.	St
1.1.7	So I turn to you cnet, They any good?	St
1.2.1	Be honest to yourself.	St
1.2.2	If you find little or no info on a company you plan to do business with, then move on.	St
1.2.3	Don't fill-in required knowledge with hard luck stories.	St
1.2.4	Plainly put, try someone else with better reviews or at least more of them and take it from there.	St
1.2.5	While, I can't tell why you didn't much on Iron Computers, it maybe because: 1) new company 2) co. name change 3) they started selling on WWW 4) shell co. for some big name that not all good 5) legal requiremanets of some kind But, if uyou have to guess or need to find out, then why brother.	St
1.2.6	More than likely someone else sells the same items or PC build for similar costs or close to it.	St
1.2.7	You may want to checkout &quot;white box or bare-bones PC&quot; which is another term for a vendor built PC that includes only the case and installed innards from your build or what they offer as PC#1, PC#2, etc., but nothing else.	St
1.2.8	You may to supply everything else or add more to order list.	St
1.2.9	Larger online vendors offer such, like NewEgg, TigerDirect and ZoomZipFly, etc.. tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	Hello amstrdm.	St
1.3.2	Hopefully I can shed a little light on the company for you.	St
1.3.3	Before I say anything, I'm not the actual person who bought the computer my brother did.	St
1.3.4	I prefer to build my own and have been for almost 6 years now, and I probably always will.	St
1.3.5	My brother was looking around for a decent gaming desktop.	St
1.3.6	His old desktop was getting dated, and he wanted a new one.	St
1.3.7	I usually just build the computer for him, but he moved to California and I wasn't able to.	St
1.3.8	From what he told me he found them the same way you did.	St
1.3.9	He was looking up reviews for Ibuypower, and someone who had a bad experience with the company recommeded Ironside Computers.	St
1.3.10	So, He called me and asked me what I thought about them, and I told him something similar to what Wally said, but he called Ironside's customer service, and he said he was impressed with the sales rep.	St
1.3.11	He said that they knew what they were talking about, and they were very helpful took the time to answer all his questions.	St
1.3.12	I still stuck by what I told him, but he decided to order anyway.	St
1.3.13	I believe he said it took about a week or so until he received the computer, and from what he told me it booted right up and everything worked right out of the box.	St
1.3.14	About a month ago he came back to visit for our mother's birthday, and he brought the computer with him, so that I could take a look at it and give him my opinion, and I have to say I was impressed.	St
1.3.15	Everything they used was name brand.	St
1.3.16	The cable management looked very professional.	St
1.3.17	Everything looked in good condition, despite all the dust that was starting to accumulate in it.	St
1.3.18	Lol, that's when I revealed to my brother the miracles of blowing out your computer.	St
1.3.19	Overall, the computer was very well built.	St
1.3.20	I can't say if they consistently build every computer the way the did his, but if they do then I would definitely recommend them.	St
1.4.1	Every single review ive seen for them (on this page included) the person who wrote the review has only 1 post on their account on each site.	St
1.4.2	( http://www.resellerratings.com/store/Ironsidecomputers_com ) I only have this 1 post just to warn u lol.	St
1.4.3	I suggest going with a big company that you can 100% trust like dell or HP or something.	St
1.4.4	- I hope you dont get ripped off &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;	St
1.5.1	I agree with you what your saying Pat, and in fact this is my first post also, so watch out, lol.	St
1.5.2	I'm personally not an active member on Cnet just like Pat or Agabum, I just found this the same way Pat did, by googling Ironside Computers.	St
1.5.3	This was the first thing that came up, so take my post for whatever it's worth.	St
1.5.4	In this case with Ironside Computers I can definitely say they are a legit company.	St
1.5.5	I'm in the Las Vegas area, and I've had them building computers for me for almost 4 years now.	St
1.5.6	The reason you don't see many review is because they've only recently begun selling online, and if your ever in the Las Vegas area just go check them out for yourself.	St
1.5.7	They're located in southwest Las Vegas by Rainbow and Robindale.	St
1.5.8	One last thing Pat, are you seriously recommending Dell and HP.	St
1.5.9	Most people looking for companies like Ironside are trying to get away from those companies, lol.	St
1.5.10	Those big name companies simply just don't care about their customers.	Sug
1.5.11	You can see what I mean by checking out resellerratings.com.	St
1.5.12	http://www.resellerratings.com/store/Dell http://www.resellerratings.com/store/Hewlett_Packard	St
1.6.1	I was just saying 2 companies that are big as examples lol	St
1.7.1	I purchased a fairly high end gaming system about six weeks ago from Ironsides and I am impressed.	St
1.7.2	When doing research I came across this very post and told myself that if I am happy with the system I will come back here and put in my two cents.	St
1.7.3	I was a little nervous about purchasing the system from a fairly unknown company, so the first thing I did was contact customer service.	St
1.7.4	Over the next week I corresponded with them via email and was impressed with the the quick and professional responses.	St
1.7.5	It took 8 days to receive the system and again I was impressed.	St
1.7.6	It was packed carefully and securely.	St
1.7.7	I realize this is my only 'post', but if you are looking for a system I would recommend Ironside computers.	St
1.8.1	I had them build a mid-tier gaming system for me and it was well shipped, and worked perfectly and I am happy.	St
1.8.2	I found them after some research on the 'net and yes there isn't much out there review-wise but it was mostly positive and I took the plunge.	St
1.8.3	I'd recommend them.	Sug
1.8.4	Of course you will save money building your own system but I went the more expensive route.	St
1.8.5	It seemed also a better bet than Cyberpower, IBuyPower or Dell's Alienware.	St
1.8.6	Recommended	St
1.9.1	I was looking at ironside and saw this thread.	St
1.9.2	I hadn't even noticed it, but went back and googled and found that every positive review was by a person who'd written only 1 post and usually joined the same day.	St
1.9.3	It's been 1.5 years since Patisdabest pointed this out and situation seems to be the same.	St
1.9.4	I haven't bought a computer from them - maybe they're completely legit, but these endorsements don't feel right...	St
