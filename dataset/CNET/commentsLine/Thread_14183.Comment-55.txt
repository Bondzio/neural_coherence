ya yes!
a good old c-64!!
i remember trying to format a 5 1/4 floppy disk and just couldn't do it!
the command string in the book was wrong!
remember that???
when i got the correct string i was as happy as a pig in (mud) hehe it used to break about once a week so it was back to the store where i bought it to get it replaced.
i got smart after the second one that i took the circuit board out of and swapped it with the first one then took the first one back and got a new one!
i did like the 64 and had fun with that thing.
i did like choplifter so if you find anything about it please let me know.
i found one close for a pc but that sure was a simple fun game.
do you remember a game called stroker64?
i won't go into details just yet but it was funny as can be.
the good old days are gone forever!
life goes on.
