right now, i know that the netgear router i'm using (the one i'm planning to use as a wap) works with the nas i have.
i'm not overly concerned about netflix since we do not have an account and do not plan to get one.
however, in the event i need a work around, is there one... in other words, is there a way to create a &quot;white list&quot; which the router would then accept for connectivity, or am i just stuck with whatever the built-in firewall is designed to allow?
i understand that each router model may have a variety of options for firewall configuration, but this is &quot;new ground&quot; for me and i like to understand my potential options.
thanks again.
