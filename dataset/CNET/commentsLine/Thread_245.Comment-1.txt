i have a custom built machine, which i put together in september.
i have been using the soundcard built into my motherboard, in device manager called &quot;realtek high definition audio.&quot; the other day i had a microphone plugged in and it was turned on.
i turned the switch on the microphone to the off position, and as soon as i did, all hell broke loose.
i got about five dialogue boxes pop up with errors saying something about being unable to reset or detect the wave controller or something like that.
it was a few days ago, i don't remember the exact error.
ever since then, my computer does not detect when i plug in speakers or a microphone and i get absolutely no sound.
i have tried everything.
i've tried updating the soundcard driver, i've tried doing a system restore to two days before this incident, and there is no change.
i'm wondering if it's possible that i somehow shorted out the circuits in the sound card.
is there anything else i can try to restore my sound?
