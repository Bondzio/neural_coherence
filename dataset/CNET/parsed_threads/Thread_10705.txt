<s> Total newbie to wireless here. </s>
<s> Just got a laptop with Intel PRO/Wireless 2011B LAN PC Card that is supposed to give my laptop wireless capability. </s>
<s> Questions: 1. </s>
<s> Will this card work OK for hooking up to hotspots while roaming? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Does it work both 802.11b as well as 802.11g modes? </s>
<s> You said that you hot a Intel PRO/Wireless 2011B LAN PC Card More on your wireless card here http://support.intel.com/support/wireless/wlan/pro2011b/lanpccard/ You will have wireless capabilities. </s>
<s> You will have the b capabilities, meaning your connection speed will be slower than a g connection. </s>
<s> I found this and it might help to explain things better. </s>
<s> The 802.11b wireless networking standard was the first widely available wireless networking solution that users could buy; the vast majority of public wireless spaces, including coffeehouses and restaurants and the like, use the 802.11b standard. </s>
<s> It uses the 2.4 Ghz frequency for communication, and the fastest speed an 802.11b user can theoretically have is 11 Mbps. </s>
<s> The 802.11a and 802.11g standards both offer a higher theoretical maximum speed of 54 Mbps. </s>
<s> However, nearly half of that is used for routine communication between your computer and the wireless access point it's communicating with, not for transfer of your data requests. </s>
<s> 24 Mbps is the highest speed that wireless cards are required to support. </s>
<s> The 802.11a standard uses the 5.5 Ghz frequency, a signal which is less used by other devices (a bonus for wireless network users) but the signal strength drops off more quickly as you go farther from the access point. </s>
<s> However, because there's less interference, it may be easier to design good 802.11a coverage than 802.11b or 802.11g coverage in a given area. </s>
<s> All in all, though, 802.11a is currently the least common type of wireless network installation. </s>
<s> The 802.11g standard shares the 2.4 Ghz frequency with the 802.11b standard, but 802.11g provides the higher theoretical maximum speed of 54 Mbps. </s>
<s> Since they share the same frequency, many networking cards that support 802.11g also support 802.11b. </s>
<s> This is good for users who travel from network to network, since 802.11b is still the most commonly available type of wireless networking. </s>
<s> However, having a user with an 802.11b card in an 802.11g network slows the maximum speed of all the wireless network's users to the 11 Mbps 802.11b standard. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> It helps a lot. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> Looks like I'm going to get another card that will work both the 802.11g and 802.11b modes. </s>
