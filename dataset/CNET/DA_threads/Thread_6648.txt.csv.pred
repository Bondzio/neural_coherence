1.1.1	Ok , i have a Dell Inspiron 1150 notebook with a Dell Truemobile 1300 WLAN card .	St
1.1.2	I am attempting to connect through a Netgear WGT624 ( v1 ) router and all i am getting is Acquiring Network Address , and then nothing .	St
1.1.3	I am on XP Pro SP2 .	St
1.1.4	Any ideas of what may be causing this guys ?	Ques
1.2.1	I have problems .	St
1.2.2	I turn off all the routers and wait 15 seconds .	St
1.2.3	Turn everything back on and then try to connect .	St
1.2.4	Everything is fine then .	St
1.2.5	I usually have this problem after a power outage and/or surge , thank goodness for surge protectors .	St
1.2.6	Rick	St
1.3.1	Such as did it ever work .	St
1.3.2	If not we look at testing at some hotspot which if that works we suspect the router ( old firmware , dead , etc . )	St
1.3.3	If the hotspot test fails we think about spyware damage .	St
1.3.4	Of course my neighbor has the classic call .	St
1.3.5	I asked him to push the button to turn the wifi on the laptop .	St
1.3.6	Bob	St
1.4.1	It all worked fine when i first hooked it up .	St
1.4.2	I went through netgear 's Smartwizard , and configured everything for the first time .	St
1.4.3	It worked great for a few days , then all of a sudden it started dropping the connection and then reconnecting , now it wo n't even renew the ip .	St
1.4.4	The router is still working just fine wired , and my computer recognizes the network on wireless , but refuses to Acquire the network address .	St
1.4.5	Maybe just a setting somewhere ?	Ques
1.5.1	It should only be a setting if you had changed them from when it worked .	St
1.5.2	Try the usual and hold the reset on the router ( see the manual ) and run the setup wizard again .	St
1.5.3	However I 'd test at a hotspot first so I know my PC is OK then the reset , wizard and if the laptop fails to connect in the same room , pack and return the router .	St
1.5.4	I 've already noted updating firmware so I wo n't repeat that .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	If Verizon , the Westell modem/router uses the same ip address as the Netgear router .	St
1.6.2	You 'd have to change the ip address in the Netgear router to prevent the conflict .	St
1.6.3	Rick	St
1.7.1	I have Earthlink broadband through Time Warner Cable .	St
1.7.2	I will try to locate a good hotspot to see if i get anything there .	St
1.7.3	Thanks guys .	St
1.7.4	I 'll also look for a reset , but i have unplugged everything , given it time to reset , and plugged it back in , but same same .	St
1.7.5	I 'll update again once i hit a hotspot .	St
