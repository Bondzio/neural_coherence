1.1.1	I have a NFORCE 570 Slit-A motherboard .	St
1.1.2	I have a single hard drive ( 250GB ) that I have plugged into the SATA1 connector .	St
1.1.3	I have 2 IDE Channels ( one primary and one secondary ) .	St
1.1.4	I currently have my DVD RW drive plugged into the secondard IDE channel .	St
1.1.5	Is that correct ?	Ques
1.1.6	I was reading on a post that I need to buy an IDE card for the DVD but I do n't see the sense in that if I have 2 IDE 's available .	St
1.1.7	Thank you for your thoughts .	Polite

1.2.1	Get a nice 80 conductor IDE cable and from the primary IDE to the master connector on the cable with the drive set to CS plug it in there .	St

1.3.1	Bob , Is SATA supposed to be faster than IDE ?	Ques
1.3.2	Also , Would it improve performance by moving the DVD drive to the primary master IDE ?	Ques
1.3.3	Thanks again for your thoughts .	Polite
1.3.4	Tim	St
1.4.1	And to get the best effect I would use both channels .	St
1.4.2	- & gt ; Yes SATA can be faster but most DVD drives have read limits well below the SATA speeds and even IDE rates .	St
1.4.3	Let me comment that for XP , installing to a SATA drive ( XP retail versions ) can be troublesome for some .	St
1.4.4	If I wanted to make it harder to install I 'd give my tech all SATA components .	St
1.4.5	This changes in Vista but that 's another can of worms .	St
