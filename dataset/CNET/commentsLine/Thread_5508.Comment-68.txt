most likey your problem is not with the hard drive but the enclosure itself.
there is a circuit board inside all external hard drives that can go bad, resulting in the drive not being accessible, however your data is still intact.
all you need to do is remove the hard drive from the case, which can be difficult, without damaging the hard drive.
if you are lucky there will be small accessible screws.
then you can either intall the drive directly into your computer, as a slave, or buy a new external enclosure and install the hard drive into the new enclosure.
i have personally done this twice, and with my maxtor one-touch it was a pain opening the case, they are sometimes designed so they are not easily opened.
