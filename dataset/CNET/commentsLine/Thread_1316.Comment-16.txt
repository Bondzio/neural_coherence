i guess you could say it is connected.
this is my hd htpc set-up!
and that does'nt include the guitars & basses and their rigs, keyboards, drum machines, percussion, harmonicas, juice harps, horns, wash boards etc... next up on the shopping list is a couple of flat screens & a projector, along with a video switcher/mixer and some software.
master of the entertainment center says: &quot;we could use a little more tallent in the monitors, please.&quot; the unknownsoundman
