Of the three, which is the fastest way to transfer files to an external hard drive?

Today, with USB 2.0, Firewire 400 you may want to use what works best for your setup. Forget Ethernet unless you can go to 1Gg (1000Mb) or better. Bob

Firewire and USB 2.0 are pretty close. If you have a Firewire port on your laptop/desktop go for it. USB ports can be finicky and there are reports of some laptops and desktops having USB port failure for no apparent reason. That happened to my wife's laptop last year. We got her a new machine, but luckily the old one HAD a Firewire port, too, so we were able to get her files off the old machine and onto an external drive that way.

But certainly here in the UK, USB external drives are far more plentiful than firewire and the competition keeps the prices a tad lower. The specifications for Firewire 800 and USB 3 are in the final throes of standardization but as far as I am aware, nobody has yet committed to make external drives for them when available. Currently, Gigabit Ethernet would be faster (as stated earlier, don't even think about anything less than gigabit) BUT you'd be looking at attaching an iSCSI box as your external drive and these are definitely priced for business and not for consumers. One other possibility is an eSATA drive. SATA PC cards with an external aSATA port are becoming readily available but again, they aren't as cheap as USB.

To be truthful, when I compare my old system (two IDE drives) with my new one (two SATA II) drives, this human cannot really tell the difference in performance. Both seemed to do the trick for my needs (surfing, photography incl Photoshop, etc.). I got a Seagate 1TB eSATA external not long ago. Works just fine. I've never used a USB or Firewire external so I can't compare for you. BTW, would someone please explain to me WHY we need BOTH Firewire AND USB? I'm getting more than a little pi**ed off at manufacturers who decide to reinvent the wheel unnecessarily. Once some technology has evolved to a satisfactory state LEAVE THE DAMN THING ALONE! I'll murder the next jerk that comes up with yet another SCREWHEAD design, for example, or even another ME TOO/LOOKALIKE automobile. What BS!
9367	7	331105	2985277	2984748	ahtoi	2/21/09 10:21 AM	1.23521166E12	Yeah..I know the spec. is about the same (usb2 & firewire),	but My experience says firewire is faster or all my computers (3) has lousy usb2. Personally I think eSATA is the way to go but I don't think the poster has that.

9367	9	331105	2985418	2985281	rae2_2	2/21/09 1:40 PM	1.2352236E12	Too bad &quot;people&quot; most often have NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE BUYING	... but you're probably correct, ahtoi, but please note that, IMHO, &quot;people&quot; are noted for buying (and doing) what makes no sense at all. This world needs Firewire about as much as a teenager needs pimples. But... a fancy title has sold an awful pile of garbage (books, music groups, vaporware, software... you name it.) Most people have not been taught the skills necessary to critically analyze what they see, hear or read. Which is likely the MAIN reason for the global ECONOMIC catastrophe we all face today. More FIREWIRE!!!!!

Why do we need OSX and VISTA? Competition-good. If there were only one standard, we would have to wait until all the bugs are fixed before we could get any new releases
