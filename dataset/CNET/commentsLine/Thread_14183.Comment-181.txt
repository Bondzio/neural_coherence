wow, you guys are stirring up fond memories.
the first system i worked on was a ge s-200 series.
the next system i worked on was the philco 900 which got replaced by an rca spectra 70... that was our dmv's first on-line system.
mag cards were pretty cool.
in 1967 i went to work for a service bureau as a computer operator on a burroughs b-260.
it had a whopping 4.8k memory, 2 card readers, a punch and a 700 lpm drum printer.
a while later i ended up working with a burroughs b-1700, b-3500 and the b-4700.
burroughs had some pretty neat things in their os, but the hardware was not very reliable.
oh for the days when rsi was unknown.
