My question today has to do with using an HDTV as a computer monitor. With black friday coming up I am currently contemplating picking up a cheap (~400$) 32&quot; 720P LCD HDTV, and using it as my computer monitor. I am running an HP s3600t desktop with the 256mb NVIDIA graphics card, 64 bit windows, 3gb ram, etc. How well will this work? I've heard of people doing it, but im not sure how this works for a basically average desktop system with a few upgrades in it.

Will one have a better picture than the other? i would assume the HDMI one would but who knows. The big thing i was wondering though was how well the resolution would be and if there would be any issues with lag time between movement and response.

Only a gamer's top end machine can reduce lag. I have yet to be told VGA vs HDMI has a difference beyond 4.2 milliseconds. Bob
