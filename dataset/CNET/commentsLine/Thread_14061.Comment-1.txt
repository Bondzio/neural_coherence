hi!
i'm trying to build a different sub network using an adsl router/modem left from my old isp.
(a sagem f@st 2604 ) i first connected the old adsl router with my new isp gateway (a thomson tg784n) on the same net 192.168.1.0/24 with a ethernet cable (not cross-over) connecting numbered ethernet ports, (dhcp and wi-fi off) and all went ok (1).
now i'm trying to put my pc and the old sagem f@st 2604 on the 192.168.10.0/24 network , but i really don't know how to configure the different ethernet ports in the sagem modem/router, i fear that i wont be able to configure the sagem to behave as a switch(2).
(1) i don't know how this worked, but it did.
can you give any light on this subject?
(2) is it possible to configure the sagem f@st 2604 to behave as a switch?
