1.1.1	I have been using the HP 215 for about four years.	St
1.1.2	It works just fine for me, with one exception.	St
1.1.3	The batteries go dead very quickly.	St
1.1.4	They advise not to use rechargeable batteries, but the cost for replacement batteries, after a while becomes prohibitive.	St
1.1.5	Any suggestions as to a unit with more battery life?	St
1.1.6	Thanks, Bill	St
1.2.1	My Kodak dx6490 went about 8 days without charging.	St
