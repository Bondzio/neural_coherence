sorry thats a pun...my query is about memory, i currently have 1 stick of memory in my machine - kingston 256mb 333mhz ddr pc2700 - what i'm confused about is the 333mnz and the pc2700 parts, i'm looking for more memory but i'm not sure if i need to buy the same i.e pc2700 and 333mhz, can i mix and match?
for instance the one i'm looking at is 512mb 400mhz pc3200, will this have any effect.
rnning: p4 2.4gb and xp pro.
thanks goofs
