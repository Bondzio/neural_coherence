&quot; my only question is why buy an sli mobo with a psu and vidcard that won't support it?&quot; why wouldnt you want an sli mobo???
he is ready for the future, your video card is fine, all you need to do is buy another and a bridge chip when you think your machine needs a good upgrade.
keep the sli mobo.
good ram, cpu, hdd, vid card - although the 6800 series will fall in price over the next weeks and months.
superb choice on your case and power supply.
i think that case is one of the best along with the p180.
everything else is thumbs up be happy with your system konny
