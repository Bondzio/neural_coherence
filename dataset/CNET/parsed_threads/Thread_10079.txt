<s> I currently have a dell studio 1537 laptop with 3gb RAM and a intel core 2 duo t5800 processor and was wondering if upgrading to 8 gb ram will make a significant difference in performance. </s>
<s> I sometimes get bogged down but im not sure if its from the ram or the processor. </s>
<s> Unlikely to make much difference. </s>
<s> How much RAM is being used now during normal use? </s>
<s> What's your OS? </s>
<s> And you know that you need a 64-bit OS to use more than 4 GB? </s>
<s> That might add to the cost. </s>

<s> It has Windows 7 64 bit Pro and only 4GB RAM. </s>
<s> (only?) </s>
<s> I do not intend to add more since it's running much faster now that I replaced the slow stock HDD with that spiffy 7200 Hybrid HDD. </s>

<s> makes a huge difference. </s>
<s> My Levono T60 is a nice machine. </s>
<s> I keep it lean and it would boot up in about 2 - 2-1/2 minutes with the stock 60 Gig 5200 RPM drive. </s>
<s> I wanted a larger drive so I bought a 160 Gig 7200 RPM. </s>
<s> Boot time was almost cut in half. </s>
<s> And performance is much faster. </s>
