It was just for email & internet connections; maybe w/ an integrated screen. I want just that for a second home in FL......as cheaply as possible; for email & to pay bills. Small size would be a plus as well. A really cheap notebook would be ideal, but they're not so cheap in my eyes. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks.
