when i try to play music on my laptop, it's very slow to load/ play.
the hd space within my laptop is pretty much full now, so i'm thinking that's my problem.
if i were to get myself an external hd with tons more space, loaded my music & music playback software on *that*- it should all run normally, right?
i just wanna be sure 1st before i plunk down $$$.
