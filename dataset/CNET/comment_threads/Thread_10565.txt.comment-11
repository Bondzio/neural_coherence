By the way, the &quot;liquid lense&quot; if ordered via their website, is only $9.98 and shipping is a couple bucks....NOT the $5.00+ some places charge.
I got my shippment for $11.90.........
They only ship in the USA at the moment.
Use the left over for sunglasses, goggles, face masks, your watch case....anything with a scratched surface.
