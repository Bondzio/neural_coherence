Thank you for finally offering some clarification.
That wasn't so hard, was it?
And no... this was not an issue of me not reading your reply.
If you look at the way you phrased your initial response (grammatical errors aside), perhaps you could understand why ANYONE would have difficulty following.
I'll try the solution you've suggested and report back w/results.
