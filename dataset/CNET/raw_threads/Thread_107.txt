4850	6	302424	2819461	2819234	4dP	7/25/08 6:19 PM	1.21700994E12	i dont have	well i thought i made myself clear with that explanation but i dont have that service and i think thats because i'm not using windows server 2003
4850	7	302424	2819459	2819461	R. Proffitt	7/25/08 6:29 PM	1.21701054E12	Just so you know.	I do not have the time to find the same article rewritten for Vista, XP and so on. If you must have that then I have to say I'm sorry and try some other troubleshooting tactic. Let's try this. Share the services that are currently running. Here's how. Run CMD and use the NET START command then post the results here. C:\&gt;net start These Windows services are started: Automatic Updates AVG8 E-mail Scanner AVG8 WatchDog COM+ Event System Computer Browser DHCP Client DNS Client Event Log HID Input Service iPod Service IPSEC Policy Agent Kodak Camera Connection Software Logical Disk Manager Network Connections NVIDIA Display Driver Service Plug and Play Print Spooler Protected Storage Remote Access Connection Manager Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Security Accounts Manager Server System Event Notification Task Scheduler TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper Service Telephony User Profile Hive Cleanup Windows Management Instrumentation Driver Extensions Windows Time Workstation The command completed successfully.

If that's too rough or hard, boot SAFE MODE and try it there. Safe Mode should reduce the services that could interfere. Bob
4850	11	302424	2819548	2819480	4dP	7/25/08 8:52 PM	1.21701912E12	*sigh*	well i would try the dispart but i do not know the commands and do not have ink in my printer to print the commands out i tried the safe mode and nothing same errors as in normal windows boot wondering if i have it format in another computer can it work once i do that in my current pc
4850	12	302424	2819810	2819548	R. Proffitt	7/26/08 6:40 AM	1.2170544E12	That's a great idea.	Move the drive to another machine and partition it there. DISKPART commands are DOCUMENTED on the web. It's not hard to use and the only issue could be you forget to select the right drive. With no disrespect intended I think its best to learn the OS you are using even if one command at a time. My guess is it's the software installed after the OS that is at play here unless there is flighty hardware. One member revealed the drive had been dropped after we went through all the steps. Bob
