I have a somewhat old computer (a Dell XPS 410) I'm looking to add a bit more RAM to.
I was flipping through the owner's manual and found that it takes dual-channel 533-, 667- or 800MHz DDR2 RAM.
How can I be sure that's what I should get or should I take the manual's word for it?
I'm also wondering about the 'limit' of memory it states in the manual, which is listed as 4GB.
Once again, how can I be sure that's all I can put in it or should I again take the manual's word for it?
And a bit of a silly question, but I feel I should ask - Would it be best to buy an 800 MHz over the other two?
Would it run/load faster than 533- or 667-?
Thanks a bunch!
