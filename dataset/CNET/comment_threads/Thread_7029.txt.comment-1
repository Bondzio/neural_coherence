I am using a Windows XP Professional computer.
I just bought the Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 1000 to replace the same set.
The set contains a wireless mouse and a wireless keyboard.
When I move the cursor to the right edge of the screen with the mouse, the cursor will often will move on its own to a different place on the screen.
I tried adjusting some of the settings in the Mouse Properties screen but that didn't seem to help.
What could be causing this problem and how do I fix it?
Thanks.
Richard
