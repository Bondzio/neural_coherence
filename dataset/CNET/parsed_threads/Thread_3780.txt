<s> Hey guys help!! </s>
<s> I have a Maxtor 6y200po internal hard drive which I use to save data on. </s>
<s> I had a problem with my main drive and had to format it and re-load windows. </s>
<s> The problme is when I try to access the data drive throuhg My Computer it tells me the drive is not formated and do I want to do it. </s>
<s> I have loads of stuff on the drive which I dont wont to loose Can anyone help? </s>
<s> The format routine is different for each version of Windows. </s>
<s> And you didn't tell. </s>
<s> Also, if the drive is not formatted according to some version of Windows... then the data as it stands is gone. </s>
<s> Let's try this. </s>
<s> How about you read the forum tip and fill in the missing information and we'll try again? </s>
<s> The tip reads -&gt; Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. </s>
<s> Hi I am using Windows XP and the PC is a Dell Dimension 2300. </s>
<s> The problem hard drive is a Maxtor 6y200po. </s>
<s> The drive was working fine - its just since the main hd was formated its gone wrong. </s>
<s> I appreciate any help you can give Cheers </s>
<s> Microsoft only supplied the OS. </s>
<s> If you formatted the system, then drivers for motherboard, USB and more need to be found and installed for your system. </s>
<s> Also XP doesn't get USB 2.0 support till XP SP1 and even then there can be issues. </s>
<s> Most USB 2.0 drives would behave just like you wrote in your first post... As it stands you have an incomplete OS install from what I can tell. </s>
<s> -&gt; But you didn't read the forum tip so this is all I can tell you. </s>
<s> I can't point to possible drivers you might need. </s>
<s> Best of luck, bob </s>
