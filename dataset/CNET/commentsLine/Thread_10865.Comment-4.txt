just want to pipe in that i have given up with the small form factor sony's et.
al.
whether at home or traveling -- i cannot do without my dell latitude with 15.4&quot; screen and resolution of 1920 x 1200. it is a bit heavy -- but well worth the added weight.
i would consider other brands -- if i could get them to tell me what their resolution is (and sell me a laptop with a high resolution monitor at a reasonable price).
