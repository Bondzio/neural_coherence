<s> I recently purchased a new computer and I want to put all my music from the old one to the new one. </s>
<s> I was able to get them on the new computer but they won't play. </s>
<s> Media player says that I do not have the licenses, but it plays them on the old computer. </s>
<s> What do I need to do get it to work on the new computer? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> No word on the files, their DRM encoding, the player software. </s>
<s> In fact you may want to read your post as if you were not aware of anything about your PC or software. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> The music files are DRM and MP3. </s>
<s> I don't know out DRM. </s>
<s> I am using Vista as my OS and Media Player. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Sorry, I meant to type the files are WMV and MP3. </s>
<s> WMV files can be DRM'd (see google as I don't duplicate web content.) </s>
<s> The MP3 files should copy just fine. </s>
