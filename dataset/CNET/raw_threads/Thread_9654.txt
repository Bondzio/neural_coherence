12108	0	511432	5053804	NR	scatmanwfm	12/27/10 4:01 PM	1.29346566E12	Added new harddrive, performance seems slow	I originally had a Western Digital Hard drive specs are: 750 GB 7200 RPM 16MB Cache The drive I purchased to install with it was a Western Digital Caviar Black specs are: 640 GB 7200RPM 64MB Cache My problem is that once I received the new drive I wiped my computer and proceeded to install both drives everything installed fine. I used the newer drive that has better specs for the C: drive partition and the old drive that is a little bigger as a D drive. I'm only going to have the two partitions and I was going to use the D for just installing games, for instance my steam games which I have a lot of. Everything installed great. Didn't really have a problem. Seemed like the new drive was a little slow at some points but still worked out. After I installed everything I've noticed that when I go to access or just load up steam or navigate on it I get the loading cursor for a few seconds, I'm not an impatient person but I mean it brings this up every few seconds for the simplest things.. like clicking on a particular game to view the page or initializing a game to install. I was told that this could be that the old drive that I'm putting just my games on (D drive) doesn't have a paging file for it and that if it did this might clear it up but then I read somewhere that putting a paging file on a drive you will only see if a difference if the drive you put it on is faster than the other. I'm kind of confused about the whole thing can you put a paging file on two drives? Or can it just go on one? I just don't really have any knowledge on this topic at all and was wondering if someone could up my understanding of this, and also if this would even make a difference and if so how do I do it? Thank you very much for any help.

I can't find the make, model of the system or HDD. If you want to speed up discussions, don't spare the details. And PLEASE READ http://forums.cnet.com/7723-6122_102-510824.html?tag=threadListing;forum-threads The member started off with asking for overclocking but with a little digging we found the cause for the slow machine. And no amount of overclocking would have helped! Bob

Some not sluggish performance with foreign file systems I'd consider a test run with the PHY jumper noted at http://wdc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wdc.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=5387&p_created=&p_cats=185&p_cv=1.185&p_pv=2.279&p_prods=227%2C279#jumper Bob
