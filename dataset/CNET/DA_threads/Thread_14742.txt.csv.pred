1.3.1	I was confused about this & quot ; HALF HEIGHT & quot ; I thought it was a & quot ; special & quot ; type that I had to purchase the same replacement type in any brand so long as it was half height .	St
1.3.2	Do n't know what half height is .	St
1.4.1	there are some slim drives intended for use in laptops , but the rest are half-height .	St
1.5.1	Thank You very Much .	St
1.5.2	It was very confusing to me since when I search for half height only a few show up .	St
1.5.3	I do have a Best Buy close and I think your suggestion is great .	St
