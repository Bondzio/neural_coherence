ok that you changed it to stock which may help but have the machine's builder pull the heatsink off the cpu and drop some fresh heatsink paste there.
then have them make sure the heatsink is in solid contact and fans to working.
for heat issues it's very important to clear those up as it ages parts and machine quickly.
a 5 year machine will see trouble after the first year.
