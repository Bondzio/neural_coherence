1.1.1	can I connect my keyboard to the computer and play with its sounds with no delay?	St
1.2.1	i assume we're talking about a midi keyboard.	St
1.2.2	check the midi ports on your keyboard and your pc.	Sug
1.2.3	if you have pro-style midi (round plug) you'll should get a usb midi adapter and not fiddle with the sound card's port.	St
1.2.4	if you have a db plug (semi-rectangular) the keyboard may plug into your sound/game card's midi.	St
1.2.5	you'll also need some sequencing software.	St
1.2.6	as for the delay, if you attach directly to a sound card there's typically no delay.	St
1.2.7	usb can introduce a delay, but it can be minimized by using a usb-2 device and plugging it directly into the pc (not a hub).	St
1.2.8	if you have lots of usb devices, find a usb port that can provide full power since it typically won't be on a shared host.	St
