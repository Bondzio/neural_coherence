1.1.1	I've been running an Asus P4P800S-X mobo, P4 2.4c, Saphire Radeon 9600 pro, for a little over a week now with not a single problem.	St
1.1.2	Yesterday, while I was plugging in a game controller into the front usb port, I heard a loud pop sound just as the plug touched the front usb panel.	St
1.1.3	The monitor went blank, but the computer fans still continued to run.	St
1.1.4	I then smelled a strong burning plastic odor and quickly shut down the computer.	St
1.1.5	I checked everything out and all seemed to be okay, so I thought maybe my monitor fried.	St
1.1.6	I tried to turn on the computer and got nothing.	St
1.1.7	No sounds, no lights, nothing.	St
1.1.8	I pulled out the mobo and found a very small chip,(about half the size of a grain of rice) on the mobo which is burnt.	St
1.1.9	It is black with some white powder residue on it.	St
1.1.10	It also discolored the board a little.	St
1.1.11	I tested the PSU and it seems to work fine.	St
1.1.12	What caused this to happen and how can I prevent it in the future?	St
1.1.13	What are the chances that other components may have also failed as a result of this?	St
1.2.1	That may be an unanswerable question.	St
1.2.2	However, it is likely (though by no means certain) that the plugging in of the game controller is not co-incidental.	St
1.2.3	First, replace the Mother Board, and come up with just memory, cpu/fan, ps, and Motherboard.	St
1.2.4	If you get the post single beep of success, add components 1 at a time and gradually put the machine back together.	St
1.2.5	Do not however add in the game controller.	St
1.2.6	Get a cheap USB card, and plug the game controller into that, or get another game controller, if it is bad, you don't want to fry another MotherBoard, now do you?	St
1.2.7	Consider replacing the USB receptacle on the case, as that may also be the source of a wiring fault.	St
1.3.1	I had the same problem, except I plugged in a headset in the front audio input.	St
