<s> Hi, I've got a Gateway desktop that I've upgraded the operating system to Windows 7 64 bit. </s>
<s> It worked fine for the past month and all of a sudden, it started turning itself off as if someone has pressed the off button. </s>
<s> When I turn it back on, it asks me if I want to reboot in safe mode. </s>
<s> I've recently tried installing a new printer but the same issue occurs when I have unplugged my printer. </s>
<s> It does the same thing whether it's actively being used or being left unattended. </s>
<s> I don't think it's an overheating issue because it's located in a relatively cold room. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You still need to consider overheating at component level or a malfunctioning/stressed power supply. </s>
<s> Don't guess, look. </s>
<s> Check the heat sink fan and cooling fins. </s>
<s> I've seen them so clogged you couldn't see the fins. </s>
<s> I turned the machine back on this morning and it won't even boot now. </s>
<s> It asks me to either start windows normally or restore. </s>
<s> When I choose start windows normally, the window logos shows up and then it freezes. </s>
<s> When I choose restore, it loads the file and when it's completed, it freezes. </s>
<s> My guess is that it's probably a driver issue with the new drive updates that I recently installed. </s>
<s> Am I correct? </s>
<s> Try &quot;Last Known Good Configuration&quot;. </s>
<s> Try taking the case off... </s>
<s> Did your problem occure when you installed the new drive updates? </s>
<s> If so you might have damaged your hard drive. </s>
<s> Jerry </s>
<s> I've set the machine aside for the past few days and it boots again. </s>
<s> I'm deleting the programs and drivers that I've installed recently and hopefully it won't turn itself off again. </s>
