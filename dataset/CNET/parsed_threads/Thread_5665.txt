<s> Ok I have cleaned out the computer and it still shuts off. </s>
<s> I thinks because of heat. </s>
<s> I guess my next step is to replace the PSU. </s>
<s> Do I replace it with the same unit number. </s>
<s> This is a six year old H P Pavillion. </s>
<s> Is the psu plugged into the mother board in more than one place. </s>
<s> If so how do you keep track of where it plugs in. </s>

<s> First, if it's overheating, are the fans inside the case running? </s>
<s> Is the fan on the processor running? </s>
<s> Have you cleaned out the dust bunnies around the processor? </s>
<s> Have you tried running with the side cover off to allow better ventilation? </s>
<s> The PSU can be replaced if needed, but it usually won't cause overheating inside the case unless the fans mentioned above are not running. </s>
<s> The PSU will plug in to one and maybe two locations on the motherboard, depending on the board. </s>
<s> It's impossible to mix up the connectors due to their shape. </s>

<s> I don't know for sure if it was overheating, I just thought that may be the cause. </s>
<s> I did blow out the dust mites, and I did check the fans, and I did take the side off to check if that may be the cause. </s>
<s> No Luck, it still shuts down. </s>
<s> So my next step will be to replace the PSU. </s>
<s> A local repair guy said I am wasting my time. </s>
<s> Well maybe, but this is my chance to play with the old one while I set up to build a new one. </s>
<s> Right now I am just renting a Dell, while I learn somthing about this hardware. </s>
