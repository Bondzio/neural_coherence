1.1.1	Hi , I 'm having a issue with NAT settings and was hoping you guys could help .	St
1.1.2	I have a Linksys E3000 wireless N router .	St
1.1.3	I have two Xboxes connected to the router , one wired , and one wireless .	St
1.1.4	I 'm trying to get both of the Xboxes to have an open NAT , but I have n't had any luck .	St
1.1.5	I spoke with a Cisco tech , and they had me do & quot ; Port Range Triggering & quot ; for 80 and 3074 , change MTU to 1364 , uncheck & quot ; Filter Anonymous Requests & quot ; , and disable & quot ; Upnp & quot ; .	St
1.1.6	The best it would ever do is make the wired Xbox OPEN , and the wireless one Moderate .	St
1.1.7	But it seemed intermittent , and sometimes the wireless Xbox would change to STRICT .	St
1.1.8	Could you guys maybe give me a hand ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Cnet 's review wrote & quot ; The included desktop application ca n't be used together with the router 's Web interface , and neither provides the complete control over the router 's features and functions. & quot ; Between that and the failed support I 'd return this for a router that is knows to work with Xbox Live .

1.3.1	Which router would you recommend for 2 Xboxes ( wired and wireless ) , a PS3 , a Wii , and multiple other devices ( iPhones , Laptops ) .	St
1.3.2	I 'd like to stick with an N router , and my primary use for it is gaming .	St
1.3.3	Dual band is also nice .	St
1.3.4	I like the idea of using the 5GHz frequency .	St
1.3.5	Thanks !	St
1.4.1	I meant & quot ; known. & quot ;	St
1.5.1	We know that much so even I would not offer anything here .	St
1.5.2	While our home uses the simple Netgear http : //reviews.cnet.com/routers/netgear-wireless-n-router/4505-3319_7-33090709.html ? tag=lia ; rcol it may not work for those that are fascinated by dual band or other than basic router use .	St
1.5.3	There are some that claim it drops but it never has here .	St
1.5.4	However you may guess it 's set up exactly as noted in this forum 's sticky .	St
1.5.5	I eat my own dog food in other words .	St
1.5.6	Sadly the model you noted failed not once but twice so if the maker is having you play with MTU and more , it is not ready for the field .	St
1.5.7	Bob	St
1.6.1	Yes the multiple Xbox issue is simple , , udate you frimware to newest version .	St
1.6.2	and dissbale the SPI Firewall , , The SPI firewall is essentially a NAT firewall .	St
1.6.3	Linksys E3000	St
