<s> First, here's my system: Antec PC Tower Case AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ Processor Socket 939 Asus A8N-SLI Premium nForce4 SLI HIS Hightech Radeon X1800XT G.SKILL 2GB (2 x 1GB) 184-Pin DDR SDRAM Western Digital Caviar RE WD2500YD 250GB Serial ATA 7200RPM Hard Drive w/16MB Buffer LITE-ON Black ATAPI/E-IDE 5X DVD-RAM Write DVD Burner With LightScribe Model SHM-165H6S MITSUMI Black Internal Floppy Drive This is my first build and I kinda followed the guide here: http://sysbuild.corsairmemory.com/report.aspx?id=2&sid=2 Everything pretty much went fine. </s>
<s> I was able to install XP without any problems (I'm not using RAID, btw). </s>
<s> I installed my DVD Burner to the Primary IDE plug on my Mobo and installed the HDD to the SATA 1. </s>
<s> However, here's where my questions/problem come into play. </s>
<s> First, in the lower right of the desktop, near the clock, there is an icon that you would recieve if you plugged a USB stick into the PC. </s>
<s> If I highlight it, it says &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot;. </s>
<s> If I right-click it and click that, it shows my Hard Drive listed in the Hardware Devices at Location 0. </s>
<s> It gives me the options to view the Properties and the option to &quot;Stop&quot; the device. </s>
<s> I haven't tried stopping it, but I have looked at the Properties. </s>
<s> Nothing appeared wrong there. </s>
<s> However, there are no Volumes listed on the Volumes tab (I don't really know what goes here...if anything). </s>
<s> So, my first question is if my drive should be showing up like this? </s>
<s> I've looked in Device Manager and my hard drive was listed under Disk Drives. </s>
<s> Also, something &quot;odd&quot; happened when I moved my PC from where I built it to my desk. </s>
<s> After I had moved it and booted it up, my hard drive was no longer detected. </s>
<s> I checked my BIOS and it didn't recognize it either. </s>
<s> So, I opened the box back up and checked to make sure no wires had come loose...none had that I could notice. </s>
<s> I tried booting up again, but had the same problem. </s>
<s> So I rearranged some of the cables and went so far as to exchange the SATA cables that plugged into the drive. </s>
<s> Amazingly that worked. </s>
<s> This has only happened to me once so far, but I was wondering if it had anything to do with the other issue. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> first didn't show up. </s>
<s> The signal connectors for SATA drives have been known to be very poor in that they come loose and fall off easily. </s>
<s> They have been redesigned to have some of a slight retaining feature. </s>
<s> I do not know if the retainer/latch/catch requires that the drive side of the connector has to be changed to match the newer cable. </s>
<s> Thus the move most likely simply loosened the cable. </s>
<s> Did you install any mfg supplied drivers when installing WinXP (F6)? </s>
<s> See if you have an AHCI device in Device Manager; check your BIOS and see if AHCI or hot-swapping is enabled. </s>
<s> If your drives are configured to allow hot swapping, they'll appear in the &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; list just like a USB drive. </s>
<s> When I first installed an SATA drive, I installed the cable backwards. </s>
<s> One end just has a plug, but the other has a plug and a clip/lock. </s>
<s> The cable works either way but is loose if reversed. </s>
<s> Perhaps you did the same thing? </s>
<s> I'm just using the cables that came with the mobo. </s>
<s> I bought a bare drive, so it didn't come with any cables. </s>
<s> Both ends of the cables look identical. </s>
<s> I don't see any clip/lock. </s>
<s> But the cables do look kinda &quot;chintzy&quot;, so I think I agree with what the other poster said. </s>
<s> About the AHCI and whether I have hot-swapping enabled...I'll have to check that later. </s>
<s> (I'm not at that PC right now.) </s>
<s> I know that I did not press F6 at any time during boot-up, if that's what you first meant. </s>
<s> It did ask me to if I wanted though. </s>
<s> What exactly does AHCI stand for, btw? </s>
<s> And, I'm assuming that if I discover that hot swapping is enabled, then I should disable it...right? </s>
<s> Or does it matter? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I only have the cables that came with the mobo. </s>
<s> I bought a bare drive, so it didn't come with any cables. </s>
<s> When I was building the computer, I did think that the quality of the cable ends looked kinda &quot;chintzy&quot;. </s>
<s> So, you're probably right...the move just simply loosened the cable. </s>
<s> At least, I hope that's so. </s>
<s> Ha. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) is an interface specification that allows the storage driver to enable advanced Serial ATA features such as Native Command Queuing and hot plug. </s>
<s> Here's a secure cable: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=WDSC50RCW-DT&cat=CBL Since you didn't add any drivers, maybe they're part of the mobo/chipset drivers. </s>
<s> Your mobo certainly supports hot plug (page 1-3 of your user's guide). </s>
<s> Anyhoo... </s>
<s> I don't think you have anything to worry about. </s>
<s> Hot swapping and there was no AHCI device in Device Manager. </s>
<s> So I guess I just won't worry about it if I don't really need to. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> And thanks for the link to the secure cable. </s>
