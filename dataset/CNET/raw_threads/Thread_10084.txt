I have several video files that I am trying to move onto the drive, most of them around 4 GB in size. Problem is, even if I am trying to move just one at a time, I get an error message saying that the disk is full. The external drive has at least 150 GB free and even my main drive has 12 GB free. I've tried enclosing one of the videos in a .zip file and moving it over, and that works fine. But then when I try and unzip the file, I get the same &quot;disk full&quot; message. I've also tried using some &quot;backup software&quot; to move the files over, and while everything seems to work correctly, when I go to the external drive where the backed up files should be, nothing is there. Smaller video files seemed to copy over fine, as well as files of several other types. Is there anything I can do or any software I can get that will allow me to move those files over?
