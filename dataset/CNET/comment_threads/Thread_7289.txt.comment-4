...the only other way to solve this is to by a KVM (Keyboard-Video-Mouse) box.
What KVM boxes do is provide constant power to the keyboard and mouse ports so that the PC never discovers that the devices are missing.
If your PCs are close by, having the KVM can be a distinct advantage because then you only need one keyboard, video display, and mouse for all of the computers.
Also, you never have to unplugged them!
The downside is that KVM boxes can be expensive if you get the really good ones.
However, that being said, you can pick up a 4-port box from NewEgg for about $40.
It might solve your problem and create a better solution for you.
Good luck!
