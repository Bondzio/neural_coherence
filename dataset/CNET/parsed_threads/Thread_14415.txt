<s> Hey all, Everytime I turn on my second computer on my home network, my host automatically dials into the internet. </s>
<s> I have had the same problem in the past but can't figure out how to correct it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> My host is Windows XP and the second computer that is pulling my host online is running Windows 98 SE. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>

<s> http://www.annoyances.org/exec/forum/win98/1031774589 is a typical discussion. </s>
<s> http://www.wown.com has articles about ICS. </s>
<s> In a nutshell, you configured it to dial on demand. </s>

<s> I would imagine the 2nd to last paragraph is where your issue is. </s>
<s> Open Network Connections. </s>
<s> (Click Start, click Control Panel, and then doubleclick Network Connections.) </s>
<s> Click the dialup, local area network, PPPoE, or VPN connection you want to share, and then, under Network Tasks, click Change settings of this connection. </s>
<s> On the Advanced tab, select the Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection check box. </s>
<s> If you want this connection to dial automatically when another computer on your home or small office network attempts to access external resources, select the Establish a dialup connection whenever a computer on my network attempts to access the Internet check box. </s>
<s> If you want other network users to enable or disable the shared Internet connection, select the Allow other network users to control or disable the shared Internet connection check box. </s>
<s> I really appreciate the help. </s>
<s> I am going to try the steps that you have suggested when I get home this evening. </s>
<s> I am using a dial up to connect to the internet, but ethernet to network my computers. </s>
<s> I am assuming that when I double click the network connections that I am going to be adjusting my settings for dial up since I am using a modem for my internet. </s>
<s> Is this a correct assumption? </s>
<s> Thanks again for the help, Laraine Liverman </s>
<s> I did everything that I was given and I am still going online as soon as my second computer goes into windows.. </s>
<s> I am in the middle of recoverying the second computer. </s>
<s> I am going from scratch. </s>
<s> I can use all of the help I can get, Laraine Liverman </s>
