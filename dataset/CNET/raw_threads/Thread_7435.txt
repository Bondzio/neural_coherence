However, up until recently, using the same method I have always used, the DVD's no longer work. The program goes through the process of converting and burning, but the DVD can't be read by the computer or DVD player. I just recently had a virus, adware.look2me, which is removed now. Could that have had something to do with it? Ive tried re-installing the DVD-rom drivers and my converting/burning program but no luck. Here's what I am using. Comstar 16X Double Layer Internal DVD+/-R Rewriter WinAVI video converter Someone, please help Thanks
