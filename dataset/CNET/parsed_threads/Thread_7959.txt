<s> The manual on the S27C230B says I can adjust the brightness, but once it goes down, there is no &quot;Up&quot; button. </s>
<s> I chatted with Samsung support, and they told me to use the + and - buttons. </s>
<s> Umm, there are no + and - buttons. </s>
<s> So I am told that once I turned the brightness down, there is no way to turn it back up. </s>
<s> I did a reset to &quot;factory settings&quot; but the brightness didn't budge. </s>
<s> What is the trick to turn the brightness back up? </s>
<s> On most newer monitors you have some access to get to the OSD = on screen diags(menu) You then select brightness and use the +/- controls to set the level. </s>
<s> Depending on yours, that may mean left-right or up-down buttons. </s>
<s> Of course, there must be no actual damage to controls or brightness electronics themselves. </s>
<s> If you had the brightness too long at high levels or simply accepted them &quot;as is&quot; which often is high it can burnout the electronics. </s>
<s> Samsung, gee everyone sooner or later has issues with that brand. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> This monitor does not have + and - buttons. </s>
<s> There is only a &quot;down carat&quot; and NO up. </s>
<s> So once the brightness is turned down (following the manual), if I want to turn it back up, it isn't possible. </s>
<s> Or so the Samsung support agent said. </s>
<s> I find it incomprehensible that there would be a setting that can be lowered but not raised. </s>
<s> If nothing else, at least re-flash the eeprom to its original full-on setting. </s>
<s> I have always liked Samsung products, and own quite a few. </s>
<s> This has me really reconsidering. </s>
<s> But how many buttons are there along the bottom. </s>
<s> I wonder if there is indeed no up/down button but that MagicBright OSD issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There are two buttons, Menu and Power, which doubles as Down. </s>
<s> I figured Menu might double as Up, but no, it does not. </s>
<s> Nor does a combination of both buttons create an Up ... it's still Down. </s>
<s> By the time I figured that out, the intensity was at 66 percent. </s>
<s> There has to be a way to reset the brightness to factory. </s>
<s> I'm still looking. </s>
<s> Someone from Samsung .. please weigh in. </s>
<s> It's your company's reputation that's on the line. </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/samsung-forum/ tada -----Willy FYI - I have read the manual, be sure you haven't &quot;locked&quot; the controls. </s>
<s> It seems 10secs. </s>
<s> will lock/unlock them when pressed. </s>
<s> Thanks for the idea. </s>
<s> I ensured that the controls aren't locked. </s>
<s> Still can't find how to raise the brightness. </s>
<s> When you pull up the OSD menu, there is a down arrow and a right arrow in the menu display. </s>
<s> It's beyond counter-intuitive that Samsung would say &quot;you can adjust the brightness&quot; and then not have an &quot;UP&quot; button, or a button that can function as one. </s>
<s> As noted there is a Samsung forum and my company is not Samsung so get in the right forum. </s>
<s> I took the extra effort to check out the manuals and they were in my opinion too light. </s>
<s> But why keep it? </s>
<s> It's not suitable to your use and the seller and maker have not helped you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> As I see it you need to goto the menu under Samsung magic Bright and select &quot;custom&quot; then set your levels. </s>
<s> The others seem to be preset for best operation or so configured. </s>
<s> If you can't under custom go up and down, then there's a fault as I see it. </s>
<s> If there some save mode or exit that saves your custom setting, then be sure to do that. </s>
<s> I don't see any other way around this for now. </s>
<s> Of course, as I stated before no real h/w fault be part of this nagging issue. </s>
<s> manual page 36 section 3.1.1 tada ------Willy </s>
<s> The MagicBright reference seems to show more buttons than the OP says it has. </s>
<s> This one is back to the supplier and maker to correct the issue with showing them how to use it or replacing the product. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I believe I will return the monitor and purchase one from another manufacturer. </s>
<s> Thanks to all who replied. </s>
