Hello, I have an Asustek p4b motherboard, which has 3 slots for memory.
I have 2 sticks of 512 in there and I am trying to add a third stick of 512.
I can put in any of the 2 sticks, into any of the 3 slots (conclusion all the memory is fine and the 3 slots are fine also).
BUT whenever I put in all 3 sticks of memory Windows XP will not start up.
It keeps trying to start up over and over again.
I cannot even get it to start up in safe mode.
Does anyone know what might be the problem?
Thanks in advance!
!
