&quot;Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.
Also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums--revealing personal information such as your e-mail address, telephone number, and address is not recommended.&quot; Given such slim details it's a wild guess if that's it.
For instance you could have some Duron or Athlon that burns up when the heatsink falls off.
Then it would be the CPU and not the motherboard.
