the &quot;media speed&quot; of the drives is at or about sata 1.x speeds.
while a few per cent points can be gained by going to 3.0 and 6.0 gb speeds the &quot;media speed&quot; appears to be unchanged.
&quot;linear transfer rates&quot; seem to be governed by this too.
more rpms help a little but not the media speed as it gets the needed sectors under the heads faster.
i'm sure there is a paper/web page about this but the lesson is expensive as you figure out that windows scores are not a good measure of a machine and could have folk chasing rainbows (or other things.)
hope this helps, bob
