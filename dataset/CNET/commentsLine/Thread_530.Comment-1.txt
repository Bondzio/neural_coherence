don't buy the 988 if you expect to get a rebate!
i purchased an fp988d through tiger direct in november, submitted the rebate forms immediately, and 5 months later have yet to recieve my $90.
i've spoken with ty, the head of their rebate department, he's a *@#%!?
liar, not mention his &quot;flaming&quot; temper when i called him on his lies.
bottom line - the monitor will cost you $90 more than the advertised price - buy a reputable brand from from a reputable vendor!
