1.8.1	& quot ; Your modem router has a firewall that blocks unauthorized access to your wireless network and permits authorized inbound and outbound communications .	St
1.8.2	Authorized communications are established according to inbound and outbound rules .	St
1.8.3	The firewall has the following two default rules .	St
1.8.4	You can create custom rules to further restrict the outbound communications or more widely open the inbound communications : & # 8226 ; Inbound .	St
1.8.5	Block all access from outside except responses to requests from the LAN side .	St
1.8.6	& # 8226 ; Outbound .	St
1.8.7	Allow all access from the LAN side to the outside & quot ; Notice how an inbound access from WiFi is blocked ?	Ques
1.8.8	You 'll want to change that .	St
1.8.9	Page 44 ( using the page counter in the PDF viewer ) shows the default is BLOCK ALWAYS .	St
1.8.10	Again , firewalls like this are a cause for many of these issues .	St
1.8.11	Your choice to allow communication .	St
1.8.12	Sorry it took this many tries but the thumbs down on my first reply looks uncalled for .	St
