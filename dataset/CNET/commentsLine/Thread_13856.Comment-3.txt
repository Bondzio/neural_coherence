people who put two toally differant video cards together (not sli) do it not for real perfomance but to have more then one monitor.
if you want good perfmance you have to have a sli bridge.
idk if any of the cards that you metinoed are sli ready but if they are you might be able to bridge them then you get a small perfomance upgrade.
but not really worth it most likely.
