is this computer overclocked??
.... download this software and tell me your temprature ( http://www.almico.com/speedfan432.exe ) i think its because of your high temprature..so this software will give your temprature at idle....and for load download this program ( http://mersenne.org/gimps/p95v2414.exe ) and also run the speedfan because prime95 will give your pc a 100% load.
and now post your idle as well as your load temp..bye
