You got the situation correct.
I am currently using a Linksys wireless Routher, a Linksys Wireless Printer server with the upstairs printer, and a Epson Printer.
The system works great.
I just want to expand my capabilitie to the downstars printer.
I have a Epson R300 down.
How would I hook this up?
Would I use another Linksys Print Server hooked to the Epson R300 as a stand alone print server?
Mike Thanks
