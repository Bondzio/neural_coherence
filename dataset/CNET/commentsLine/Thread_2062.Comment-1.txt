my question is about how to get my os to boot properly.
i have a maxtor 60gb sata that my os is installed on, and i have a 160 gb western digital ide hdd.
after installing the second drive i started getting an error when i start my computer that says: &quot;disk boot failure; insert system disk and press enter&quot;.
i can instert a system disk and press enter, and get the same error... however if i insert a system disk and reset my comp, then wait for the &quot;press any key to boot from cd&quot; message to pass, my computer will boot just fine(only if i have the windows install disk in the drive).
to top all of this off, i'm getting an automatic check disk on drive c (not the drive my os is on) just before my computer finnishes loading windows.
the message tells me that there are &quot;inconsistancies&quot; on drive c. if i cancel this check disk it continues just fine with no errors, but if i let the check disk commence, it takes almost a full hour to check drive c, and then i get system hang when it finally logs into windows.
my specs are listed below... thanks in advance for any help.
nathan mobo: lanparty ut nf4 sli-dr cpu: amd athlon 64fx 57 ram: 2g ultra pc 3200 ddr (1024 x 2) hdd: maxtor 60g sata (6y060m0) western digital 160g ata100 (wd1600lb) os: windows xp pro (sp2) p.s.
this is the first time i have used sata... i am clueless as to how to properly set a sata disk as the o.s.
disk, and no, i did not get a cd of apps and drivers with my sata drive(it was from tigerdirect, and was a refurbished drive)
