1.2.1	1. back up the stuffs you ca n't afford to lose .	St
1.2.2	2 .	St
1.2.3	Move everything ( including hidden files as well ) from partition2 to partition3 .	St
1.2.4	3 .	St
1.2.5	Make partition 2 as free space by deleting partition2 .	St
1.2.6	4 .	St
1.2.7	Resize partition1/C : by absorbing all or part of the free space ( in this case , it was part.2 ) .	St
1.2.8	I suggest all of it .	St
1.2.9	Personally I have not work with this particular software before but seem like it could do this .	St
1.2.10	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	changing/reallocating the disk space should be pretty easy and straightforward .	St
1.3.2	The first thing to do is backup any data you do not want or can not afford to lose .	St
1.3.3	Next run Partition Wizard .	St
1.3.4	Usually the way to reallocate the space is to first reduce the space allocated from an adjacent partition .	St
1.3.5	For example ... .you would normally start by reducing E : from say 220GB to say 100GB .	St
1.3.6	You would take the space from & quot ; E : & quot ; from the side of & quot ; E : & quot ; between & quot ; D : & quot ; So E : would shrink by 120GBs whereafter you could expand & quot ; D : & quot ; to use that space .	St
1.3.7	Reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired .	St
1.3.8	Assuming that worked as planned , start Partition Wizard and increase the & quot ; D : & quot ; partition to fill the free or unallocated space formerly allocated to & quot ; E : & quot ; .	St
1.3.9	D : would increase by 120GB for a total of 232GBs .	St
1.3.10	Reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired .	St
1.3.11	Once you 've done that ... ..start Partition Wizard again and shrink & quot ; D : & quot ; on the end between & quot ; C : & quot ; and & quot ; D : & quot ; by say 50GB .	St
1.3.12	Reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired .	St
1.3.13	Last , start Partition Wizard and expand & quot ; C : & quot ; to fill the vacant space ... .roughly 50GBs , formerly allocated to & quot ; D : & quot ; .	St
1.3.14	Once again ... ..close Partition Wizard and reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired .	St
1.3.15	Sounds complicated but it 's really pretty easy if you think of it as taking contiguous space away from one partition making it available to the adjacent partition .	St
1.3.16	Any questions ... .we 'll be here .	St
1.3.17	VAPCMD .	St
