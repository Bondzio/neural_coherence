if all you do is surf the net and store pictures, i see no need to upgrade.
but!
your older pc will most likely not use usb 2.0 that is alot faster than usb 1.1. most external hard drives use usb 2.0 but are backwards compatible to 1.1 - but are very slow using 1.1. i would say get the hdd and possibly a usb 2.0 expansion card to install into the computer case.
the card should not be more than 20 bucks.
