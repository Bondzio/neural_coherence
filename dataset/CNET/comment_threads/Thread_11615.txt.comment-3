Is there any other way other than 1080p for Blueray watching you mean?
Well I really think it all depends on screen size and viewing distance.
On a large screen there would be no difference between 720p and 1080p to the eye unless your viewing form really close up.
On a 20 inch monitor, being fed a 1080p source like blueray, I think one would have a hard time discerning a 1080p monitor from a &quot;900p&quot; one.
(all else being equal) The 16X9 ratio probably makes more difference at that size than the resolution.
If I had more money I would be being a bigger monitor, not one with higher resolution at the same size.
