Give this approach a chance: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/ That approach will work with any version of Windows.
If the information is available, it will help you to get it retrieved.
I would then expect to get a new hard drive and use the recovery discs to return the PC to operating condition.
I do not see a mention of what PC this is in other than Windows XP Pro but since there are recovery discs, I have to assume it is from a major manufacturer like Dell, HP, Gateway?
There may be a way to do a repair install, if more info is provided.
