<s> I would like to build a dual processor computer but I don't know what motherboards can support this and what processors work best. </s>
<s> I like to multi task and my computer now is just SLOW when i'm doing anything that's processor intensive such as encoding a DVD. </s>
<s> I read about multi-core processors and if they work the same as dual processor then I suppose I could use that. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You are looking at Opterons and Xeons. </s>
<s> The P4 is not a dual CPU design. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, the HT version of the P4 does show dual CPUs in Windows NT, 2000, XP and Linux. </s>
<s> And does pretty darn good in transcoding sessions at a good price compared to dual CPU Opteron/Xeon based computers. </s>
<s> Today, I'd get a 3+GHz P4 with 800MHz FSB, later this year a dual core Athlon 64. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The opteron and xeon are pretty expensive. </s>
<s> Are there no cheaper processors that can be dual? </s>
<s> For Intel, the i486DX, Most of the Pentiums, P2, P3. </s>
<s> The P4 is NOT a dual CPU design. </s>
<s> Then we have the Xeon and Itaniums. </s>
<s> For Sun, then have some units from 1 to a few hundred SPARC CPUs. </s>
<s> The old MIPS CPU was multiple CPU capable, but stickly listed for mention... Then we have the Alpha, but not in wide distribution. </s>
<s> In the APPLE camp, they have some dual PowerPC or PowerSpec or such. </s>
<s> I hope this gives you the lay of the land today. </s>
<s> The HT tends to be you lowest cost almost full dual core unit today. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What motherboards are good but cost effective? </s>
<s> I would like to build a decent dual processor system below $1500 is at all possible. </s>
<s> Also I thought AMD had some processors that could be used as dual processors if the motherboard supported it? </s>
<s> Will the multi core be faster than dual processor systems nowdays even though they sound the same? </s>
<s> I'm really not all that dumb when it comes to putting a computer together I just am not good at putting this processor with that motherboard. </s>
<s> If I can just get those 2 picked out I think I can take it from there. </s>
<s> I would have bought a system but I can't find many places online that sell dual processor desktops. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Those were not &quot;friendly&quot; to builders. </s>
<s> Most builders tried to shortchange the power supply or the case cooling. </s>
<s> If this is your first PC build you will not be happy. </s>
<s> Not many places sell dual CPU boards. </s>
<s> It's a premium product. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> How can I tell which motherboards are dual processor capable? </s>
<s> For example at pricewatch.com </s>
<s> It should be fairly obvious. </s>
<s> It will be outrageously expensive, and the dual processor sockets are pretty distinct. </s>
<s> http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1183019&CatId=177 This board supports dual Xeon processors up to 3.6GHz a peice. </s>
<s> It has support for up to 16GB's of dual channel DDR2 RAM, it has PCI express... the works. </s>
<s> But a board like this and the dual processors will most likely cost you $1500 by themselves. </s>
<s> You never said what you are using now? </s>
<s> Anyway I built a dual processor PIII Tualitin 1.2ghz with 1gb ram 2 years ago, very fast for the time. </s>
<s> It would render a 20min vedio segment in about 12~14min. </s>
<s> Complete a SETI unit in 5~6 hours. </s>
<s> Got everything off Ebay ended up spending about $700. </s>
<s> An AMD2700xp will outrun it, An AMD 64 3000 will eat it alvie, do a SETI unit in 2.7 hours. </s>
<s> Remember when your encoding a DVD or any video app. </s>
<s> there is no multi-tasking no matter how fast your processor is since those programs TAKE ALL OF THE CPU(s) CYCLES, they just getit done faster. </s>
<s> Add up the cost of one expensive but superfast PC, or 2 fast PCs but reasonible cost. </s>
<s> I have 4 pcs on a KVM switch and just switch to a different pc when one is rendering video. </s>
<s> Your choice, John http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProduct.asp?submit=property&DEPA=1 </s>
