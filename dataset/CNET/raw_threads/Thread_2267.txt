Fry's Won't Fix under extended warra	In August of 2005, I purchased a Fujitsu laptop that cost approximately $1450. With that, I also purchased a 3-year extended warranty. Lately, I have been having problems with my ac adapter. The connection doesn't always work and usually requires that I fidget with it to show that the battery is charging and/or that the laptop is plugged in. I also had to do 4 system restores because the laptop kept crashing. I shipped the laptop to Seattle for my step-dad to take to the Fry's and they told him they wouldn't even look at the laptop until I paid $200 for them to fix the ac adapter jack, including ordering a part on laptop.com. I have a call into the manager, but it doesn't make sense that this isn't covered by the warranty, especially since it was a problem that isn't due to accident or abuse, and that they won't even look at the hard drive or run a diagnostics test because they said the problem with the adapter and whatever else is wrong are connected. Any advice or suggestions?

They are saying they don't have to cover it since the problem is &quot;physical damage.&quot; Yet, I think they have contradictory terms in their contract as the damage was through normal use. I spoke with the manager who said that if I buy the dc jack and bring in the laptop, they will fix it at no cost. But who knows if the jack is the true cause of the problem. BEWARE of Fujitsu's. Fujitsu said if I was still under their warranty, they would fix it if the cause was normal use and that was evidenced by the condition of the jack.

I bought the 5 year extended warranty, and they refuse to fix it because they label it &quot;physical damage&quot;. A quick perusal of the internet show's it is a design flaw and the problem comes from normal wear and tear. Thanks,

My sister had the same thing happen to hers and a different Fry's store wouldn't fix it. She had to pay $200 to get it fixed. I would maybe contact Fujitsu and see if they are willing to state, in writing, that a flaw exists, or something that acknowledges a design problem. Fry's is crooked and I will never buy a warranty from them again. They are horrible! Not to mention that the warranty states it will fix anything wrong that happens under normal use and then contradicts itself with the physical damage exemption. What is physical damage?????????
