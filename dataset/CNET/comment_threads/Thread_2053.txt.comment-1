I plug the flash drive into the pc and it reads &quot;usb device&quot; but when I look for the drive letter it doesn't exist.
Is there a way to turn on drive letters for external devices?
The cd-rom shows as d: but the usb doesn't automatically turn up as any letter.
I can see the flash drive in the device manager but I don't see the letter.
