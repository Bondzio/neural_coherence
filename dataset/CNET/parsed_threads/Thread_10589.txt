<s> hi, i recently dug out my old pc because i wanted to see if i could use it for a home network but i realised that it probably not good enough for gaming and stuff like that and the cmos battery shoulder holder is broke and wont hold it and the socket which i plug the monitor cable in is on its way out. </s>
<s> so i was wondering whether i could just get a better motherboard and cpu and a bigger hdd too and just use the rest of the stuff thats already there? </s>
<s> and is this really worth doing or expensive because i havnt got loads of money to upgrade it with at the mo. </s>
<s> i've already bought a slight ram upgrade from 64mb sdram to 2 X 128mb i know this still probably isnt enough. </s>
<s> im not sure hoe to find out the type of motherboard i have or cpu? </s>
<s> can anyone tell me how? </s>
<s> i've got it sitting here all open next to me so i can have a look if i need to. </s>
<s> i dont know all the specs but it runs xp home and its got a 40 gb hdd. </s>
<s> Its a dell optiplex, do you need to know the exact model? </s>
<s> its one of them old flat desktop ones. </s>
<s> if anyone could help me out that would be great thanx. </s>

<s> to tell. </s>
<s> It should be on the tower, on the front. </s>
<s> If not down load this software and post your specifications here. </s>
<s> http://www.cpuid.com/pcwizard.php I'd suggest a combo (combination) purchase like this if it's worth upgrading: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813135082 Have you upgraded a PC before? </s>
<s> If not you might just replace it with a low end PC for a few hundred dollars. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883114055 This is no dream machine. </s>
<s> Read the specification carefully </s>
<s> im from the uk so i'll have to buy one over here. </s>
<s> i've changed parts between pc's before but never really upgraded one so i've decided its probably best just to buy a low range one then go from there. </s>
<s> thanx for your advice tho it was very helpful. </s>
<s> there's more to this then one might think. </s>
<s> Doing it is fairly easy. </s>
<s> The work that is but the compatibilities can be a bit of a sticky wicket. </s>
<s> Let me be blunt. </s>
<s> Today's motherboards have too many changes from what was in there. </s>
<s> DON'T DO IT. </s>
<s> Why should I list the parts you'll save? </s>
<s> But in short let's skip to what is the best update to get some gaming out of that box. </s>
<s> I suggest you look at this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-cards,1805.html for your AGP slot then check the power supply rating and call it quits. </s>
<s> The headaches of saving what may be the case, the CD/DVD drive and nothing else is usually not worth it. </s>
<s> Even the OS may fail to relocate and many don't plan on that. </s>
<s> it's seen better days i think. </s>
<s> i thought i would just check and see whether it would have been worth doing something with it before i got rid of it. </s>
<s> someone gave it to me a while ago but i never realised it was so old! </s>
<s> theres a lot to learn about pc's for me. </s>
<s> i thinking of maybe buying seperate parts and over time and making a newer one or if i can just get a low range and build on that. </s>
<s> i've got another pc which is is high spec so im not desperate for another one anyway. </s>
<s> thanx for your advice, its very helpfull. </s>
<s> It's not bad to save and upgrade an old case. </s>
<s> What you save is the case and its fans, the power supply if it's adequate, your optical drives, and little things like card readers or what have you. </s>
<s> You also save the landfill from a pile of toxic junk. </s>
<s> Often times the only thing really worn out on an old computer is just that it can't keep up with the demands of today's programs. </s>
<s> A new mobo that supports modern CPUs and ddr2 RAM could be done reasonably nicely for under $400 for it all. </s>
<s> It's definitely easier to toss and buy new, but since time isn't an issue here... </s>
<s> PCs contain to two primary contaminates, lead from solder and flame retardants. </s>
<s> Many of the flame retardants are naturally curring substances that are non-toxic. </s>
<s> Lead is a heavy metal and because of it's weight, it may not travel far from the landfill. </s>
<s> This of course varies from PC too PC and the materials used so there might be some PCs safer then others. </s>
