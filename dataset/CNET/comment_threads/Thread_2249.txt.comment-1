I want to upgrade my computers RAM from 1 Gig to 3 gigs and I wanted to know whether the new RAM I get should be EXACTLY the same as the factory-installed RAM( as in the Mhz rating, PCxxxx type , and manufacturer) On that note I want to use two video cards and I am want know if you can use 2 different cards( the one in my computer is the ATI X700 and the one I want to use with it is the nVidia 6800 Ultra)
