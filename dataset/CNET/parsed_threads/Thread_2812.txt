<s> My rig has very specific power requirements and this is the only one I can find with the power and user reviews being positive. </s>
<s> Tom's Hardware guide doesn't list it in any reviews, though. </s>
<s> I've vaguely heard of this brand and it seemed to be positive. </s>
<s> The brand that THG recommends , Antec, doesn't put out enough +12V current. </s>
<s> I think the highest for Antec was 19 amps at the +12V. </s>
<s> I'm needing at least 25 amps at the +12V. </s>
<s> There are quite a few other brands that say their PS's put out the required current but THG says many brands fib. </s>
<s> Which brings me back to the subject header.... </s>
<s> Thanks for any help </s>
<s> I don't own one myself, but it has been highly recommended by many in these forums. </s>
<s> Given your requirements, I would contact the seller for additional assurance and/or guarantee of it's performance. </s>
<s> If you know what you need and can't find it, then certainly PCP&C is close to whatever you need. </s>
<s> You may even want to talk to them for special needs provided you have the wallet for it. </s>
<s> In other words, you truly get what you pay for. </s>
<s> You may want to check this website: http://www.sparklepower.com I wish my end-uers had PCP&C just to step away from persistant ATX power issues. </s>
<s> Yeah, they're expensive but the end result is far better that what's usually offered out there. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
