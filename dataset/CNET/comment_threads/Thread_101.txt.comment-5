HI, Thank you for the info about cleaning teh dust out of the computer.
I have to admit, I had let that task go for too long and it was filthy inside.
I also got a new keyboard a USB type as the one that came with the HP computer was a serial port type or a round one.
So whether it was the dust or the need to use a USB port Keyboard my computer seems to be working OK now.
I then began cleaning up a lot of other things like windows temp files and internet temp files.
I ran Spyware, Ad Aware, abd Norton Virus.
I did a security check and then fegragged the computer.
My computer now feels like a new car!
I am sure there are more things I could do like clean up the regesteries, but I am not astute enough to do that.
