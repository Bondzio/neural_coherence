Circuit City has a great bundle deal: computer, monitor and printer for $459.97 after rebates. Link: http://www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/125832/bundleId/1497/rpem/ccd/bundleDetail.do My question: How easy is it upgrade the graphics on this? ATI Radeon xpress 200 is integrated graphics, correct? Back when I was more up to speed on computer hardware, I heard that adding a new graphics card to systems with integrated graphics can cause problems. Is this still true? Any advice is appreciated.

I just went to Circuit City and they had this Compaq computer: http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Compaq-Presario-Desktop-PC-SR1550NX-/sem/rpsm/oid/125534/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do It was roughly the same price as the eMachine, but it several things that were better on the Compaq: AMD Athlon 64 3400+ instead of 3200+ 40GB more HD space DVD and CD-ROM (eMachine only has combo). The in store bundle (not on website) came with a LCD 17&quot; instead of the CRT that came with the eMachine. And it has better media card readers. I've noticed a lot people saying eMachine is the way to go for a solid value computer. But, is there anything wrong with going with Compaq?

Yes, Radeon Xpress 200 is integrated graphics which shares 128MB of memory. So really, your RAM is really 384MB. When you buy a dedicated graphics card, you will free up the 512MB of RAM, making your system perform better. There is nothing wrong with adding a gpu to a computer with integrated graphics. It's really easy. Just pop the case and put the card into a PCI slot. Windows should recognize the new hardware and then your all set. I would then check for the lastest drivers if your installing an older card model. Have fun.

Fortunately you can still find graphics cards for AGP 8X. PC Mag has a review of that particular system. IMO, the best budget computer deal out there is the eMachines T6522 . It has contains hardware found in computers $500-$1000 more, Socket 939 MOBO, 1gb of RAM, AMD Athlon 64 3500+, TV tuner, and Windows Media Center. In regards to the power supply issue. If you are buying a higher end card (6600GT-and up), a more powerful psu would be required. However, you can get buy on the lower end cards using a 300watt PSU.

I like the eMachines T5622, but it's a bit more than I want to spend and there aren't any good package deals for it.

14095	8	117663	1339315	1339293	bigygf	8/3/05 8:48 PM	1.12310208E12	it works fine on the stock power supply	in addition to the video card, i ripped out the dvd-rom and added 2 more hard drives, a 80gb and a 160gb. i had a spare 450watt psu, but due to the design of the psu and the shape of the case opening i couldn't properly mount it. i gave my brother the option of gutting the computer and moving all the parts to a larger case but we elected to try it out with the stock 300 watt psu and everything seems to work fine.

14095	10	117663	1339339	1339320	bigygf	8/3/05 9:19 PM	1.12310394E12	we'll see about that	i know what the manual recommends, but the machine is on almost constantly and it doesn't have any problems. so if there aren't any problems(voltages appear to be fine) then the psu is handling it. if the psu dies tomorrow then i'll spend the time to replace it, otherwise i won't bother.
14095	11	117663	1340048	1339339	AKonny47	8/4/05 8:10 AM	1.123143E12	agreed with nerdyboy	you should upgrade your power supply. during gaming or intense graphical work, your power supply will be taxed and often cause crashes or lock-ups. of course its your pc and your money, but we are just giving you our advice. konny
14095	12	117663	1340249	1339226	bishoco	8/4/05 9:44 AM	1.12314864E12	hp a1130n	You know what. After doing some looking around, I'm leaning towards the hp a1130n myself. It has twice the RAM and better features than the eMachines for only 200 dollars more. It has the PCI-x slot which is nice.
14095	13	117663	1340272	1340048	bigygf	8/4/05 9:48 AM	1.12314888E12	it's not like i'm trying to be cheap	after blowing a grand on this setup certainly a bigger psu would be a trivial expense, especially if i already had one laying around. i haven't had any problems gaming, downloading, video playback, burning, etc. sure my brother likes the idea of the bigger power supply since that's the reason we got it in the first place, but we had to weigh the cons of transplanting all the internals to another case(it would be difficult to make those front panel ports seamlessly in a new case, my brother already broke one motherbaord during a swap), versus just testing our curiosity to see if the stock brand-new Bestec 300 Watt psu in the hp would handle it. just wait till the hot part of summer
14095	14	117663	1340329	1340249	bigygf	8/4/05 10:14 AM	1.12315044E12	one more to look at	it took me a while to decide between the hp a1130n and the emachines t6522, circuit city has both. the t6522 has the tv tuner car for 20 bux more, and the motherboards appear to be similar. but my brother already had a tuner card and the hp's hard drive is slightly bigger and perhaps slightly faster and quieter as well. i think the hp's shutters are irritating, but they can be removed, but i prefer hp burners to whatever emachines uses. hp already has bios upgrades for the burner and motherboard, emachines hasn't posted anything yet. i used to build my own stuff, but emachines is so cheap i've switched to them and if anything breaks i just buy the part and i still come out way ahead. the main thing i'm giving up is overclocking ability, but for me the benefit(more speed) isn't worth the risk(reduced cpu life, stability/timing/heat issues, needing to buy premium cooling/memory/motherboard, experimenting to find the best settings). most of the games i play are video card limited but i don't use ultra high resolutions, the only time i work the cpu hard is when i render and i don't do that very often

14095	19	117663	1347141	1340272	Brakford	8/8/05 6:41 AM	1.12348326E12	Planning the same on my A1130N	Going to get a 6600 GT. I got the F1905 monitor with mine. I am very impressed with the whole set-up. I have read numerous threads about vid card upgrades and power supplies. Have yet to read that the PS went bad after upgrading the vid card. I really depends on how much stuff is running of the PS. Keep us informed and I will do the same. Which brand card, how much and where from?

Ended up being cheaper than buying just the computer (after rebates). I also got the 24 month 0 interest deal. I have to wait until tomorrow at the earliest to pick up though, because they had to special order it.
