1.1.5	What is the difficulty of installing a CPU fan from a scale of 1 to 5 .	St
1.2.1	Sadly , with close to 100 Watts of possible heat to remove , a silent heatsink will be fairly large and rank not only a 5 on the install difficulty but cost more than your budget .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.silentpcreview.com/article201-page1.html might come close , but still ranks a 4 on difficulty since YOU get to determine if this unit fits in your case .	St
