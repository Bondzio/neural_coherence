1.1.1	I just moved to a new apartment with two cable internet wall jacks .	St
1.1.2	The one in my room did n't seem to be working , so I ran a cable to the other jack ( my roommate 's ) and I can access the net fine with that one .	St
1.1.3	I called the apartment complex 's tech people and they sent a guy with his laptop .	St
1.1.4	He proceded to connect his laptop to the jack in my room and it worked for him .	St
1.1.5	He then told me I probably had a faulty network card and should buy a new one .	St
1.1.6	But every store I 've been to said it 's probably a settings-related problem .	St
