Give the forum a list of what you can buy in your price range.
Not all the cards I can get, will be in your market at the price you might expect it to be.
Example, a 99U$D card may be double the exchange rate in you local market.
Next look to the VGACHARTS at http://www.tomshardware.com to see how your list fared.
