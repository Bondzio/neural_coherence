I use win me and pentium 3, 256 mb ram.
I only recently upgraded the ram from 128mb.
When i go to mycomp and right click and go to performance a lot of times at resources it says 8% or lower but at startup it says 60%.
but using the program optimize memory i downloaded, it said i had like 118 mb of ram available.
I think that windows is making a mistake.
Is there a way to correct this?
