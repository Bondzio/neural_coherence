the problem was only with the laptop.
the pc worked fine, it was just the laptop that couldn't suft despite being connected to the router.
for some reason, i was playing around with the connection settings, and even though i didn't change anything at the end, when i disconnected the router and the modem for 30 seconds (i had done this before at least a bizzillion times) it started working again.
i'm guessing there was a problem with my ip???
?
