<s> My Dell monitor shows the Dell logo while booting up but then goes blank and I see nothing after that and the power light goes from green to amber. </s>
<s> If I shut the power off and turn it back on I can see my desk top for a split second. </s>
<s> I have to PC exactly the same so I took the monitor off the other PC and put it on the one with the monitor issues. </s>
<s> I got the same results so I thought it was a video card issue. </s>
<s> Next I took the monitor that won't display and hooked it up to the other PC and it did the same thing! </s>
<s> So now I am confused as to what I can eliminate next to figure out what is wrong. </s>
<s> I have even switched the cables and get the same results. </s>
<s> If it were a bad monitor I would think the monitor from the other machine would work but it doesn't. </s>
<s> And if it were the video card the monitor that is not working on my PC would work on the other PC but it doesn't!! </s>
<s> I'm pulling my hair out now! </s>

<s> Since no OS is noted, no models either I'll offer the usual. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Boot SAFE MODE (no, I don't tell how. </s>
<s> Look on google.) </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If Windows shows up, set the video mode to 800x600 and ok your way back to the Windows screen. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Click start and restart the machine. </s>
<s> Sorry for the lack of detail but this is all about learning how to find information. </s>

<s> Sorry about not enough details. </s>
<s> It is a Dell Dimension 4100 running XP SP2. </s>
<s> I will try that thank you. </s>
<s> It was running fine and then this just happened out of the blue. </s>
<s> I did not make any changes to the display settings before it happened. </s>
<s> I tried what you said and it didn't work. </s>
<s> Since I can turn the power to the monitor on and see the screen for a split second I did get it to boot in safe mode and then changed the display settings. </s>
<s> It still does the same thing. </s>
<s> Try 640x480 mode and look, find, set the refresh rate to 60Hz. </s>
<s> It's also possible it is firing up on the OTHER VGA output. </s>
<s> Many install a newer video card and why you report happens. </s>
