PS: I saw a picture of a E-IDE socket and has exactly the same amount of pins. but I'm not sure.

One possiblity that I ran into in 3 mobo's is that they insisted that the DVD drive be a Slave on either bus. They would not let it work as a Master, I know not why, but the mobo FAQs clearly said that.
