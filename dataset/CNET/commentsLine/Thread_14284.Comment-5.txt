you tossed the 2k nt file when you uninstalled something.
goto windows/repair and find it.
then copy and paste into windows/system32.
this worked for me.
also if you don't feel comfortable then read &quot;soolshock&quot;'s response.
there is an url that will allow a simple download that will replace the nt file and put it back..
