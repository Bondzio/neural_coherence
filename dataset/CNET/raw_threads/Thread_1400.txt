10809	0	123198	1396536	NR	briantacz	9/1/05 11:15 AM	1.1255733E12	DDR Question	I am running a P4, 2.6ghz (800mhz FSB)on a Asus mobo. My question is should I keep the (2) 256mb sticks of pc2700 (in duel channel) or should I swap in (2) 512mb sticks of pc2100? Which would give me better performance? Or can I just overclock the pc2100, and put all (4) DDR modules in @ the same time? Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!

This one is for the 865 chipset, but such a paer should be available for the other chipsets. http://www.intel.com/design/chipsets/applnots/253036.htm
