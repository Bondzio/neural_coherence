compare the design given to a human arm.
the box can be the hand itself.
the rod which connects is the metacarpus.
the two rods are the radius and ulna.
the second bar- with three rods- can be considered the elbow.
the last single rod is the humerus.
you're being given a design that will work.
if you make it, you can patent it, and never have to give credit.
this will represent the side of the container.--&gt; | this will represent a loop on the side --&gt; (.
(| &lt;-- that is the design.
or like a letter d. |d now using symbols here, = for two rods, | for the connecting rod, - for the representation of the humerus.
we have =|- as the basic design.
i have to use more letter for a representation of the design d as one end, and p as the other.
using this we create what the rod may look like.
d----p. this being the two ends of the horizontal rod which will fit over the vertical one and allow motion based on a simple hinge design.
like i said: put this together, take the credit, patent it, and you won't have to give anyone credit.
it's also known as being lazy and not doing things for yourself.
