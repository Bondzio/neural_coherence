ok - not a new issue, but can't figure this out after reading postings.
simpledrive 320gb usb - installed & works fine, backed up my macbook lepeord os with time machine -no problems.
used simpletech instructions for windows & mac users - all well.
hooked it up to my dell dimension 4600 with xp.
checked the device manager - it says it's working properly.
tried rolling back the driver - it says it's fine.
tried replacing the usb cord - nothing.
tried 5 different usb ports - still not showing in &quot;my computer&quot; finally - tried it on a new dell inspirion 1525 with vista - same issue.
but i did manage to get it to partition part of the drive - but only 128megs.
and it still isn't recognized back on my dell 4600. one problem is that this dell won't let me partition it.
the only thing i can choose from &quot;disk management&quot; is properties or help.
from all i've read, the only thing i can guess is that i need to partition it, but neither windows program will let me do that.
fyi - i also have another external drive (seagate) which i use on the dell 4600 and never had a problem - have tried unplugging it, using it's port, etc.
to no avail.
what now?
