I use the Netgear WGR614 v6 Router, updated to the latest firmware. I just can't think of anyway around this other than Port Forwarding, someone help.

I don't know how Linksys does it, but look at the configuration setup. My main PC and my web server have their addresses locked in my D-link router. It's under DHCP reservations.
