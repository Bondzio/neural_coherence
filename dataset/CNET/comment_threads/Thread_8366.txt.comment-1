Hiya.
I don't know if I can post links, but I was considering buying http://cgi.ebay.com/600W-Power-Supply-4-Dell-Dimension-3100-5100-E310-E510_W0QQitemZ330239908401QQcmdZViewItem that.
Right now I have 250W.
The couple things I'm curious about, is if that is a PSU, 'cuz it seems very cheap (or maybe I'm underestimating them), and how I would install it, when in fact it does come (if that's just something that's on the Dell Manual, those things are really hard to read).
I have a Dell Dimension E310.
Sorry if my question is jumbled, thank you in advance.
