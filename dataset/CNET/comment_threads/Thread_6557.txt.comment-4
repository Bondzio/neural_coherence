I know that some cable modems can act as routers and distribute IP addresses, but I do not know if the same is true of DSL modems, in which case a connection to more than one computer via a HUB would be impossible becuase both computers would try to use the same IP address.
that being said, does the other computer work if the only things connected to the hub are it and the modem?
If so, scrap the hub and get a router.
The deal is, DSL requires a PPPoE connection that has to be initialized, a router can intialize this connection permanently when configured to do so through its WAN port.
Hubs, in short, have no such capability and would be a poor choice in this instance.
