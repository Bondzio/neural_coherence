<s> I have a nick in the protective coding on my monitor's screen. </s>
<s> Its in a really annoying place and often inturrupts my work. </s>
<s> The screen is a Mitusbishi Diamond Pro 900u. </s>
<s> Is there a way to fix this? </s>
<s> I know there is a type of chemical you can drop on the casing that turns a small area of plastic into a moldable clay-like material that later hardens as it dries, and products that repair cd's using a chemical. </s>
<s> There must be something I can buy that can fix this. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of such a product? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Dave </s>
<s> You can find such at automotive repair part places. </s>
<s> But it's YMMV if you'll be happy. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Still, I don't know what Im looking for, and those sales people who work at those places can never answer anything but very simple questions like &quot;What brands of tires do you carry?&quot;, at least thats what its like here. </s>
<s> What would I be looking for? </s>
<s> Keep in mind, this isn't glass Im repairing, this is a laminate like protective coating on the glass. </s>
<s> Ive seen those glass repair kits, and those don't hide damage, they just seal it and keep cracks from spreading, which isn't my problem. </s>
<s> Also, how unsure are you about this advice? </s>
<s> (&quot;ymmv&quot;) </s>
<s> The goop is as you suspect. </s>
<s> It will not hide the problem and the visual aspect may still be noticeable. </s>
<s> There's no magic here. </s>
<s> It's optics... Let me dive off into optics for a second and use Google if a phrase sounds foriegn. </s>
<s> The refraction index of the repair material will not match the underlying material. </s>
<s> As there isn't a match, the repair will not be perfect. </s>
<s> But it could be better than no repair. </s>
<s> I offer this suggestion with the best intent and if you expect a perfect repair, you'll have to keep looking. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> Hi Dave, I've just read your email re: scratch on your Diamond Pro 900. </s>
<s> I've got a Mitsubishi Diamond Plus 91 with the same problem - an annoying little dent on the screen surface. </s>
<s> What's needed is something which dries in the dent to the same refractive index as the surrounding surface material. </s>
<s> Did you find anything which helped? </s>
<s> Thanks Michael k-s michael.kirk-smith@ntlworld.com </s>
<s> If you want a good result try something thats used to remove scratchs from eyeglasses as that has to be about perfect.Years ago I had bad scratches on motorcycle windshield.A guy I knew who worked at grinding and repairing lens gave me a liquid that I used with a buff pad on my drill and it did a perfect job.Seen different things on tv since should do same thing. </s>
<s> Interesting. </s>
<s> Have you any product names? </s>
<s> I'm in Ireland but I could get friends in the USA to send/bring something over. </s>
<s> Thanks, Michael </s>

<s> Hey have you guys seen the product they sell for repairing scratches in prescription glasses? </s>
<s> I have seen it advertised on TV here in the US and think I have seen it for sale in a national drug store chain. </s>
<s> Dont know if it will work as I have never tried it. </s>
<s> Just thought I would throw it at you as another option for you to look at. </s>
<s> The product is called &quot;LIQUID LENSE&quot;....here is their website, with how to order............. http://www.liquidlense.shoppingcartsplus.com/page/page/843825.htm </s>
<s> By the way, the &quot;liquid lense&quot; if ordered via their website, is only $9.98 and shipping is a couple bucks....NOT the $5.00+ some places charge. </s>
<s> I got my shippment for $11.90......... </s>
<s> They only ship in the USA at the moment. </s>
<s> Use the left over for sunglasses, goggles, face masks, your watch case....anything with a scratched surface. </s>
<s> So what's the verdict? </s>
<s> I have scratches on the film of my sony e500. </s>
<s> I would ate to replace this 22&quot; CRT. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I dont know if this would work but its got be a lot cheaper ---- What about the glass filler they advertise for filling in the stone chips on car windscreens ( just a suggestion ) postie </s>
<s> If it is any help I'm of to the USA (florida) next week for a fortnight Back on the 12-13 feb if it is any help ???? </s>
<s> I could try and get some for you postie </s>
<s> PS at least it saves you postage from USA postie </s>
