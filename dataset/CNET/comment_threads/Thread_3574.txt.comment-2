The old adage, &quot;buyer beware&quot; still matters.
Just remember this experience and don't let it slide as you know the same policies and marketing will be used in the future.
I've seen a marked difference in Dell's support and how they treat those with problems.
But, lets say, great, I'll get that pived user's business.
However, if they're too pived they expect too much at times, because they're on guard now.
I just wish they paid attention when they were buying the stuff.
