8520	1	99143	1136413	1136192	Brandon Eng	4/19/05 4:30 AM	1.113885E12	there are 2 ways to tell	Accesss Device Manager by typing devmgmt.msc in the RUN box, then hit enter. To the left of &quot;Processors&quot; should be a + sign. If you see 2 procs listed, you have a HT CPU. Another way is opening up Task Manager. If you see 2 graphs in Performance Tab, you have HT. Hope this helps. See: http://www.intel.com/support/processors/pentium4/sb/CS-017371.htm
