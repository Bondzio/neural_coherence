1.1.1	I recently installed Network Magic on my PC and on another in a home network .	St
1.1.2	Since the install , about 6 GBs of space has mysteriously disappeared from my hard drive .	St
1.1.3	I have installed no other programs .	St
1.1.4	I 've already looked at the obvious culprits , such as fragmented files , clearing out the various caches , defragging , etc. , and I 'm stumped .	St
1.1.5	Network Magic is a very small program ( less than 50 MBs ) , so I 'm not sure whether its installation and the disk space disappearance are purely coincidental , or whether there 's truly a correlation .	St
1.1.6	Does anyone have any ideas of what could be going on ?	Ques
1.2.1	The changes to get the network going likely caused more restore points .	St
1.2.2	If all is well , the usual cure is to disable then re-enable System Restore .	St
1.2.3	( How is told in the Start , Help pages . )	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	System Restore was the issue .	St
1.3.2	When I cleared out the restore points ( many from eons ago , I 'm sure ) , the system restored 11 GBs of hard drive space !	St
1.3.3	Thanks again and Happy New Year !	St
1.4.1	Go look up Crap Cleaner .	St
1.4.2	Be sure to read what it does since some will clean everything and wonder why menus are now unsorted , etc .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	If so , I 've been using it for some time on all my PCs .	St
1.5.2	Excellent product !	St
1.5.3	I 've never had it do anything unsightly to any of them , from file cleanups to registry cleanups .	St
1.5.4	In fact , I 'd already used it to see if it would make a dent in the 6 GBs of space before I did your fix .	St
1.5.5	Again ; thanks for the help .	Polite
1.6.1	You 've already done the CCLeaner .	St
1.6.2	I found 2 items to toss with this Decra____ .	St
