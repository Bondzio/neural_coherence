I've found going to gamer websites and/or 3rd party game PC builders provide enough info to go in the right direction.
Custom builders that offer a selection provide a basis to compare, though you need not buy from them.
Checkout ibuypower and cyberpower websites.
Further OEM systems supplied from Dell and HP using the brand labels XPS, Alien or VooDoo are top-end PCs.
You get a feel by reviewing the specs what's a good match and/or something again to compare to from any vendor.
As always read the &quot;fine print&quot;.
