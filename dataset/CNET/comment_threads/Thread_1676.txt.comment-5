you should be good to go.
See here on your motherboard: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00683218&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&product=3184155 It lists the AMD Athlon 64 X2 as supported.
Good luck finding one, though.
Try EBay.
You will see quite a difference in performance from what you now have.
