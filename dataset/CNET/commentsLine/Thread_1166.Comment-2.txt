&quot;.it's a gigabyte ga71xe-4 with a atlon thunderbird (850) and 576mb ram.
it also has a hercules prophet 8500le, a 20gb maxtor and it's in a modded case.&quot; and... &quot;most parts of the pc are 5+ years old so i would not be suprised if something is not working, but what?&quot; the old athlons created headaches even years ago with the way the cpu would take giant gulps of power.
the power supplies had to be updated.
an aging supply could be the cause.
since it's under the 1ghz mark, any 350 watt supply will do.
could be under 20 bucks to remove this from the issues list.
