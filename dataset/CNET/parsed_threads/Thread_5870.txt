<s> Hello, I am looking to buy a new desktop and I was wondering if I should buy a Area-51 7500 or Dell 710 H2C. </s>
<s> I am an extreme gamer and is looking for performance, so if any one could tell me which one I should get and why please tell me because I am on the fence with this because I like the fact the the Dell is over clocked, but the alienware has a newer motherboard and faster ram and I don't know which one to chose.thx </s>
<s> I personally prefer the Dell 710 H2C. </s>
<s> But I thought i might recommend this website. </s>
<s> Its brilliant and not too expensive for custom built computers. </s>

<s> Why if you don't mind me asking? </s>
<s> They are pretty well matched and both pretty much offer the same but I prefer the look of the Dell more. </s>
<s> The dell is more expensive but the Area-51 is more customizable. </s>
