just pick up whatever basic machine you can to handle your basic office needs...for example just goto Dell's site and see what their current &quot;special&quot; is or check HP or Gateway out possibly if you wanted to build it yourself i'd say goto newegg and get some basic parts, keep it in the $400-$500 range unless you need to host a website or do something in addition to basic finances and office work
