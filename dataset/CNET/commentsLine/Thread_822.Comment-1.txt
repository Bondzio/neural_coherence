i just bought the buffalo linkstation live, and have it installed with my 2wire router/modem combo.
when i copy a bunch of files to it, windows tells me that i am writing at about 1 mb/sec (capital b).
this isn't too bad, and the read speed seems to be very good, but my friend has a western digital nas that is doing 35 mb/sec.
anybody know where i should poke around to improve read/write speed?
i'm connecting to it wirelessly, but so was he.. thanks a ton, brian
