1.1.1	Hello , I 'm looking for a switch with these specs : - *rear* ports - min .	St
1.1.2	8 port Gigabit RJ-45 - no SFP needed - no PoE needed - support for link aggregation - prefer table model over rack mount Can anyone suggest a model ?	Ques
1.1.3	Greets .	St
1.2.1	If I needed the ports at the rear I would rotate the switch until the ports were where I wanted them .	St
1.2.2	Is this like that left handed screwdriver question ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	http : //www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/281414/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_e_1_4_last There 's a reason these are in the top 100 .	St

1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	http : //be.level1.com/Non-PoE -- -Managed/GES-0852/p-1958.htm #	St
1.6.1	But as you found one , the search ends .	St
1.6.2	It 's a shame as once in a while you find a new networker and they chase after the slimmest of gains .	St
1.6.3	I find the usual switched hub will work great .	St
1.6.4	Hey , your money .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation & quot ; Microsoft Windows does support native link aggregation starting from Windows Server 2012. & quot ; There 's more but imagine the new networker that shelled out for this and then flames everyone that it 's not paying off .	St
1.7.2	Bob	St
1.8.1	I like to take advantage of my dual nic NAS and dual server class nic mobo.. no one actually *needs* 4-wheel drive , but it sure rides comfy	St
1.9.1	I 've encountered such clients before .	St
1.9.2	They are insistent so you deliver the hardware and later they explode over how it did n't work out as good as they hoped .	St
1.9.3	In fact , most NAS do n't do this which is why we use a Linux box but you did n't reveal this .	St
1.9.4	That is , for 99.99 % , you are burning up the dollars .	St
1.9.5	But hey , your money .	St
1.9.6	Bob	St
1.10.1	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation & quot ; For the previous Windows Server versions however , some manufacturers provide software for aggregation on their multiport NICs at the device-driver layer. & quot ; Ye olde networker needs a new pair of glasses..	St
1.11.1	odd , my NAS is a linux box ( busybox 1.01 )	St
1.12.1	As to the Windows dual NIC .	St
1.12.2	Having tried it with proprietary setups , your money , not mine .	St
1.12.3	Good luck !	Polite
1.12.4	Bob	St
1.13.1	I 'll explain you how I did it	St
1.14.1	I 've been around the block a few times with writing router code in the 90 's and embedded computing .	St
1.14.2	I 've seen too many chase after such links and when they get them working they flame the supplier about how it did n't pay off .	St
1.14.3	So I worry about such a system for most .	St
1.14.4	Good luck , Bob	Polite
