i wouldn't get a new mb just to get firewire, but just get a firewire pci card.
since i have some older atx cases that don't have front usb or firewire ports i got a 5 1/4&quot; drive filer that had both, the cables go throught the caes, out the back and plug into the rear usb and firewire ports.
dose the job, cost $10.
