why did you install a psu with split rails?
also the video card called for &quot;minimum 500w or greater system power supply&quot; which you supplied.
now go find an oval track and drive your car at 120mph.
how long till it fails?
game machine builders tend to get single rail units and learn to not install the minimum.
