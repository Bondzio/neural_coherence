So a couple of days ago I had a post about how I would go about using my external drive on a PC to transfer data (I've been using it on a Mac for several years).
I was told that formatting it would erase the content so I opted not to do that.
However, now when I tried to hook it up to the same Mac its been used on for years it won't mount at all.
Instead it makes a weird clicking noise over and over and will not load!
Does this mean the drive is dead and I've lost all my data?!
I have never had a single problem with this drive and just the other day it was working fine.
Is there no way to recover the data from my external drive at this point?
?
