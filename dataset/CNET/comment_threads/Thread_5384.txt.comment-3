I have a 5200 and stepping through the setting, it doesn't show on mine.
But, it should support a lesser value at max.
(mine) of 1280X1024.
There are various vendors using the FX5200 series chipset but it should be very similar outputs.
In short its not a good marriage but *may* work as to what you HDTV range will allow.
