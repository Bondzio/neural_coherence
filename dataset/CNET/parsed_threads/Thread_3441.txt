<s> My latest attemplt to install Realtek AC'97 WHQL driver onto a Dell Dimension 3000 always results in a Blue Screen Of Death (due to device driver conflict). </s>
<s> I downloaded the newest version of the driver from Realtek website. </s>
<s> During installation, it says if I want to continue since this driver is not digitally signed by Realtek. </s>
<s> Having read the read-me on Realtek website, I clicked : Continue Anyway. </s>
<s> It continues for a little more and then gives me a blue screen of death. </s>
<s> Attempts to try different drivers does not help. </s>
<s> My Windows XP Home installation was new. </s>
<s> What can be the cause of the problem? </s>
<s> You should use Dell's version. </s>
<s> I wasn't about to read all of them. </s>

<s> I don't have the discs of the driver. </s>
<s> Search the service tag on Dell website brings up nothing to download from (not a single driver). </s>
<s> Where can I get it then? </s>
<s> Also, I believe the board is what makes the difference. </s>
<s> Using software like Everest, I know that the board is Intel with 865gv chipset. </s>
<s> So I go to Intel website to get the lastest driver. </s>
<s> All the drivers work perfectly except for the AC97 which cause BSOD on installation. </s>
<s> What should I do next? </s>
<s> Well, another look at Dell website. </s>
<s> This time I do a search on Dimension 3000 and it comes up with drivers for download. </s>
<s> However, in Audio section, the driver is not for Realtek AC97. </s>
<s> I wonder what can be the case. </s>
<s> Nevetheless, my trouble is pretty much solve. </s>
<s> My friend put in the recovery CD from Dell (which he got from another computer) and reinstall everything again. </s>
<s> Then somehow the drivers work. </s>
<s> (Now I don't understand what is the cause of my prior annoyance. </s>
<s> Oh well, guess that is what I get for not using a Mac. ) </s>
