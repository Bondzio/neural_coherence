if you have win98 or better, you really don't need any &quot;ram managers&quot; or such as the benefit isn't worth loading the pgm.. actually, when you remove the pgm.
the ram space it used is returned to the system is a plus.
if you run win95, you should get some improvemnt and even then, why are you using win95.
unless, you system uis so screwed-up or being doggy, get a systems ultiies that clean the registry and defrag the hds for a better result of overall system performance.
if you haven't already, increase &quot;physical ram&quot; while costs are very low as a true system benefit.
good luck -----willy
