My operating system is Windows XP. I have a 1.3 GZ Athalon (sp?) system. Everything works fine while I am hooked directly to the cable modem. When I add the Router to the mix, the internet connection slows to a crawl. I am connected by an ethernet cable - not wireless. I have talked with the router tech people and have tried all their suggestions but nothing seems to work. We can ping the sites and all seems fine but to load a page takes forever. I know very little about networking or anything so any help would be appreciated. Thanks, Billie
