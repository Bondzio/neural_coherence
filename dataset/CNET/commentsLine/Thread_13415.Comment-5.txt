have you even networked anything before?
you don't mention the brand of hub (and model #), whether you are trying to &quot;internet connection share&quot; or if you are a dial-up or broadband/dsl subscriber.
the switch is definitely a better choice, but a combination hub/switch is even better, and provides more flexibility, especially for a new person to networking.
are all your computers in the same &quot;workgrooup&quot;?
and do you allow them to share files, folders, and printers?
home networking is simple, and painless, especially if you are using ethernet cabling, and not trying to do it wirelessly, which is easier with xp professional, but can be done by a novice with some difficulty (3 out of 10 scale).
get your &quot;friend&quot; to bring his idea of hub/switch or switch over and start with the two computers on xp first.
forget about me until you can make to two talk/intercommunicate first.
good luck.
