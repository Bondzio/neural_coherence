can i ask why you did that?
error messages are gold.
what you add to it is &quot;the story&quot;.
as it stands, i ask you to find a bla bla ... oops couldn't resist... knoppix cd, boot it up and see if it sees the data.
try power off, open the case and reseat the cables and boards, then try again as well.
