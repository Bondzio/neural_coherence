<s> Hello My computer crashed after I blew all the dust out of the machine. </s>
<s> I bought a new one and want to transfer my old files but my old computer won't turn on. </s>
<s> I have seen lots about file trasfers but they all require the old computer to be on. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> Runs for 20 to 50 bucks and fairly simple to use. </s>

<s> external drive for whatever use you want to put it to. </s>
<s> Either way you've got to remove the old drive so you could also open up the new PC and connect it internally to get the data off. </s>
<s> Let us know how it works. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> You could find out who makes your new computers hard drive...and go to their site and d/l their hard disk upgrade software. </s>
<s> You still have to go through connecting it to your new machine but most of the software now will make a flawless copy to your new drive and if you like you can leave your old drive &lt;info intact&gt; in a box incase you have the problem again. </s>
<s> Sounds like a lot of work but fast is not always best...applies to life too...lol </s>
<s> and can you designate the target location ...like a folder? </s>
<s> Or is it a disk to disk copy,...partitions and all ? </s>
<s> If not, wouldn't that method result in overwriting whatever's on the new system HDD with what was on the old system ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I can't remember the one that does for sure... </s>
<s> I think it is seagate. </s>
<s> I just did it recently on my old NAS box. </s>
