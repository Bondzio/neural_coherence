<s> I've got a 28&quot; Hanns-G monitor that works fine for 5 minutes, then shows a bright band for the bottom two thirds of the screen. </s>
<s> It does it using HDMI or VGA and I have tried different HDMI and VGA cables. </s>
<s> I tried it on 3 different computers. </s>
<s> It is always the same. </s>
<s> I don't think it is the power board, the capacitors or the inverter/backlight bulbs. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> TIA </s>
<s> Then it's the logic board that needs changing. </s>
