with the cd drive out of action, your options are limited to enter any s/w?
i suggest you at least verify the usb ports are active in the bios area.
once checked, get your hands on a registry cleaner for windows, that's xp capable, run it and reboot after its done its job.
that will clear any registry flags, etc., and hopefully return to a more pristine registry.
if the usb ports fail still, unplug all, and make sure if vailable to use a ps/2 mouse port for a mouse instead of usb.
you may need to enter bios again and enter ps/2 for mouse usage.
if it still fails you may have a h/w fault with the usb ports and no end-user is applicable other than replace mtrbd.. the last option if not a h/w fault, then reload the os as others offered to restart fresh, this will prove either a h/w or s/w(os) fault if it fails to function.
the only other option as i see it, you may have a flaky power link to usb ports again possible mtrbd.
h/w fault(wiring) or chips overheated and are done in.
have you tried &quot;safe mode&quot;?
