that you recommended.
And I did get the RAM recommended by crucial.com.
So, 1) why doesn't my PC recognize it, and 2) why does it kill my monitor when both sticks are in??
Everything is up to date, and my system is clean.
The PC runs fine on one stick (either one!)
in either slot.
They just don't run *together*.
