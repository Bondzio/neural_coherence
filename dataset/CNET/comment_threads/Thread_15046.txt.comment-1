I am new to Mac computers, I am used to pcs.
My daughter gave me an old Ibook from 2001 that has an airport card in it.
It uses 802.11b wireless.
I would like to upgrade it to 802.11g wireless.
Is this possible?
If so, do I need to buy the expensive Apple airport card or is there another brand I can use?
Thanks for any info.
