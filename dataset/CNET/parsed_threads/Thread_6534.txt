<s> I'm looking for a good reliable All-In-One to print, copy, and fax. </s>
<s> All the User Reviews of HPs products have made me want to avoid them like the plague, but there's not many other choices. </s>
<s> Canon looks like a good, yet not perfect fit. </s>
<s> I need a good printer/copier that does well with drawings and text. </s>
<s> Printing photos isn't the most important issue, though it would be nice. </s>
<s> I also need a FAX that has an auto document feeder that works, which seems like the weakness of most that I've looked at. </s>
<s> Am I better off getting a print/copier combo and a dedicated FAX, or there any machines that do it all well? </s>
<s> I do not like the concept, and therefore I haven't paid much attention to them. </s>
<s> This one got good reviews on the forum earlier. </s>

<s> It has all the features your looking for except I don't know what kind of drawings you will be printing out but they should look good. </s>
<s> Just make sure you use diffusion or the high quality print setting for drawings. </s>
<s> Also run a automatic printhead alignment. </s>
<s> The text is near laser quality and graphics are very good and it also has a ADF. </s>
<s> The ADF seems to work the best out of all the ones I have had. </s>
<s> The photo quality is excellent. </s>
<s> Officemax and newegg.com both sell them for around $200. </s>
