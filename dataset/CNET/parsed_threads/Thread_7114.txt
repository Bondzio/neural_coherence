<s> I just bought a 300G external hardrive that has both USB 2.0 and firewire. </s>
<s> I want to be able to write and read data from my Mac G4 (OS X 10.3.5), and from my PC (Windows XP). </s>
<s> I am hoping to use this drive interchangbly between both machines. </s>
<s> I will only be using it for files (jpeg, mp3, video clips, wav. </s>
<s> files) not to run programs off of. </s>
<s> Is there a program that makes this possible? </s>
<s> If so how should I format the drive? </s>
<s> Which format, and on which machine should I format the drive? </s>
<s> Do I need to partition the drive? </s>
<s> If so, is it possible to partition half the drive for PC and half for Mac? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> Have you made any progress on this issue? </s>
<s> I have the same question still unresolved. </s>
<s> Lemme know. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Or will the 300GB be just for backup ? </s>
<s> If it's your only copy...and data is valuable...it's a bad idea. </s>
<s> If you read through these forums you will see many who lose everything stored on their externals and others who lose it but only temporarily...assumimg they survive the mental anguish. </s>
<s> Strongly recommend reading or searching these forums ...including STORAGE before making your decisions. </s>
