if its only for basic word processing, surfing the net, instant messaging, email, etc.
then the sempron will do fine.
and it depends...if u get the low end athlon 3000+ or 3200+, there probably wont be much difference between those and the semprons.
however when u go higher, there is definitely a difference.
