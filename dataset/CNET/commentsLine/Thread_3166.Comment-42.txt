two specs usually determine the life of a drive - mtbf (mean time between failure) and service life.
mtbf - although this is the most stnadardized measure provided by manufacturers, it can be deceiving, mtbf ratings can equate to 20-30 years between failures - obviously this is unlikely.
it is a good indicator of reliability and must be used in conjunction with the service life rating service life - typicaly this spec runs in the single digit number of years.
personally, i would not rely on a drive more than 4-5 years (as the cost of storage has dropped so significantly, i would not take take the chance with my data)
