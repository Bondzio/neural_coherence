<s> I have a Microsoft LifeCam version 3.0.215.0 that works In Windows 7, but I haven't found a way to activate it in Ubuntu 10.04. </s>
<s> Are there some drivers available that will work? </s>
<s> If so, how do I install them? </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=lifecam&q=+site:ubuntuforums.org+LifeCam+%2BUBUNTU finds prior discussions but I didn't find a version 3.0.315.0. </s>
<s> That sounds more like the Windows lifecam software version. </s>
