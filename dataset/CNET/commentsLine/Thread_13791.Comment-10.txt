once replaced the 4gb hard drive with a 32, kept the old one just the way it came out; the self-installed os did miss some tricks which the manufacturer had included, and i was glad to swap back to the old drive for os, swapfile and most used software, installed remaining software and copied all files to the large drive.
regularly sort saved items and transfer all i want to keep to external hd, thus built-in hd remains spacious enough to hold installed software and current files.
and this way there is an external back-up in case notebook goes awol.
re-using the old hd is likely more an enthusiast thing, where people replace a 500gb drive with a 750, or a 5400rpm with 7200. as an aside, for me, speed really increased when adding ram, not when upgrading the hd.
also ensure better cooling of notebook - i.e.
not using it on a warm lap as that way the thermal envelope is less likely to be reached - meaning the cpu and hd slow down when reaching around 50c to avoid overheating, on my desk the surrounds are 20c, on my lap 35c.
it's the main cause of slow computer when room temperature reaches 30c.
but i digress.
