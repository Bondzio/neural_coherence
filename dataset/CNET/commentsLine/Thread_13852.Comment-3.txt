i don;t think it has anything to do with hacking, cause i'm 100% sure nobody in this neighborhood even has any wireless equipment also, i'm not sure i wrote this right, the router is connected with usb to the pc and the access point connects to the router via ethernet.
this router had only one ethernet slot, and it had to be taken by the ap, so i couldn't use it to connect to the pc.
the shop i got it from reassured me it would work - and true enough, before the range expander, everything worked well (except the remote pc, due to signal).
i got ssid enabled and until i get this to work, i have disabled all protection.
now, the distance between the ap and the expander is not that big at all... i'd say about 5-10 m. max!
(with concrete walls in between).
and since it did work for a whole day (signal quality was excellent too!
), i don't understand what's stopping it now.
