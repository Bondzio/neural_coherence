1.1.1	I am running a Soyo PX400 dragon lite w/ 533 fsb p4 2.4 pentiun 533 fsb 500 w power supply 512 m Pc2700 memory The board will support Pc 3200 memory , if I would go to 512m PC3200 , how much improved performance coulld I expect .	St
1.1.2	Running Window XP Home	St
1.2.1	& quot ; The board will support Pc 3200 memory , if I would go to 512m PC3200 , how much improved performance coulld I expect. & quot ; Almost none .	St
1.2.2	The board runs at the slower speed of the slower sticks .	St
1.2.3	You can sift through http : //www.tomshardware.com/motherboard/20040119/ to see that even from PC2700 to PC3200 it will be doubtful you could tell any real difference except in a benchmark .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	If you buy the faster memory it will still run at the speed of your FSB .	St
1.3.2	That will not change with faster memory , so the speed will be no different .	St
1.3.3	You would have to boost the FSB and that would require at least a processor upgrade ( if not a motherboard upgrade as well ) .	St
1.3.4	Buying faster memory expecting to use it in the future is almost always a waste of time , because the memory requirements change every couple of years , and that memory will most likely not be fast enough for your next system .	St
