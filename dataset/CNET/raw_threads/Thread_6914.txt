While in a hurry the other night, I made the mistake of unplugging my external hard drive before &quot;safely removing&quot; the hardware via the &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; icon in the taskbar. It immediately caused the &quot;Power Surge On Hub Port&quot; warning (which will not go away), and the external hard drive no longer works on my computer. It works just fine on anyone else's computer. Please help! It is very important to me that I get that media back (I am a musician). I can deal with the Power Surge messages with the R89758 driver, but I need to be able to use the hard drive.
