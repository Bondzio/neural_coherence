I have 2 computers next to each other. A cable from each is run to an ethernet switch. I ran network wizzard on both computers, using xphome sp1 on both. I gave permission on several folders on both computers. When I go to &quot;My Network Places&quot; I can see the folders listed from both computers. If I click on a local folder, I get access. When I click on the client computer I get this message: \\clientname\folder is not accessable. You might not have permission to use this network souce. Contact the administrator of this network to find out if you have access permissions. Not enough server storage is available to process this command. Any help getting me started is greatly appreciated. I would like to be able to have file and printer shareing, and access to the internet from the client computer. I do have file and printer shareing turned on for both computers. Thank you, Rick
