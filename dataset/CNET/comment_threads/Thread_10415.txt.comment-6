I myself an looking for a desktop for under $800, and I've decided on the Lenovo K430.
If you don't like that, another good one is the Lenovo H520.
Either one will do you well, they both come with warranties.
The H520 comes with Windows 8, a 3rd generation Intel Core i7-3770 Processor( 3.40GHz 1600MHz 8MB), NVIDIA GeForce GT630 2GB Graphics, 8GB DDR3 SDRAM at 1600MHz, 2TB 7200 RPM Hard Drive.
The K430 comes with Windows 7 or 8, 3rd generation Intel&#174; Core&#8482; i7-3770 (3.40 GHz, 8MB Cache), NVIDIA&#174; GeForce&#174; GT620 1GB Graphics, up to 32GB SDRAM, 2TB (7,200 rpm).
So in conclusion, the K430 is better in terms of RAM, but for everyday use, both will do you great for a low price.
