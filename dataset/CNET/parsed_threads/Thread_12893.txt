<s> We recently upgraded from a Linksys wireless B router to the Linksys WRT54GS wireless G router with speedbooster, and everything was working fine; our old linksys B adapters and our new wireless G laptop, but my netgear wireless B adapter doesnt work anymore, but it used to on the old router. </s>
<s> I have windows XP and tried using the windows wireless configuration tool and the one that came with the adapter. </s>
<s> I also tried using it on our other XP desktops and tried enabling and disabling WEP and nothing has worked. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> on your wrt54gs and especially your netgear B adapter. </s>
<s> BUT, please be aware that, different brand compatibility do exist.. </s>
<s> Please define &quot;does not work&quot;. </s>
<s> Can your wireless even see the network? </s>
<s> Can you associate but not get an IP address? </s>
<s> When in doubt, reset to factory defaults on the router. </s>
<s> Test if you have connectivity in an open environment. </s>
<s> Then add WEP or WPA-PSk. </s>
<s> Most routers these days have the ability to support only G clients for preformance reasons. </s>
<s> SKrall </s>
<s> So I have two linksys adapters and one netgear. </s>
<s> All three can see the network, but only one linksys one will connect. </s>
<s> I tried resetting the router and it still doesnt work. </s>
<s> according to CNET, this router has great backwords compatibility, which was why we bought it. </s>
<s> So when i try to connect to the network, it says 'waiting for network to be ready' for like 30 seconds, then it stops trying, so it doesnt even get an IP address. </s>
<s> However, the one linksys adapter that works connects almost instantly. </s>
<s> Does that help? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Set router's WIRELESS NETWORK MODE to &quot;mixed&quot;. </s>
<s> Not &quot;G-only&quot; or &quot;B-only&quot;. </s>
<s> Yeah it is in mixed mode...I have my two linksys B adapters working and so my only problem is that the netgear one wont work. </s>
<s> I think at this point im just going to upgrade. </s>
