first thing you need to check is that you are actually using the epson drivers to drive your printer.
to determine this, launch the printer setup utility.
(given the lack of requested information, i'm assuming os x here) highlight (select) your epson r200 and then click on the show info button in the tool bar.
in the resulting window, you should see the driver information.
if there is a number like 5.x or the word beta, then you are not actually using the epson driver.
let us know p
