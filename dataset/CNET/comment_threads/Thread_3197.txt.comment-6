I had a geforce ti 200 before I installed the 9700 and I uninstalled the nvidia stuff first b4 i installed the new card.
I installed the new drivers off of the ati site.
I hope there isnt any remaining nividia drivers that might be conflicting with the ati stuff.
The geforce ran fine with the 450w psu.
Should I uninstall all of the ati drivers with there uninstaller then reinstall them?
