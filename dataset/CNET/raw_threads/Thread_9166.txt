I have a good Idea of what MB i want but could base my decision on suggestions... Also, I would like to use XP MCE but can get XP Pro for 30 bucks at my university, any reason I should spend the extra 100 to get the media center version?

A elegant, yet expensive choice, would be Lian-Li. Those cases could fit anywhere and still look good. I don't reccomend the skinny cases (The ones that look like regular cases on their side). They are smaller, and it looks like they are harder to upgrade. Just wondering, any specific reason for using Intel? Rather than AMD. Don't want to start an argument, but the benches speak for themselvse. ~Ibrahim
