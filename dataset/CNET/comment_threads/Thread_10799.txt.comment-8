Trying to help someone that won't take your advice.
My next door neighbor was like that.
A few months ago the Geek Squad spent a half day at his house.
I don't know what they did and I don't know what it cost but now he listens.
Amazing how a whack in the wallet will get someones attention.....go figure.
