<s> i am having problems with my dell desktop Optiplex GX280. </s>
<s> When i go to start the computer up it only keeps on making a beeping noise. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me with this. </s>
<s> Count the beeps and any sequence it may be presenting, like long-short beeps, etc. </s>
<s> Then check Dell for any clues to what the bios beep code could be telling you. </s>
<s> With power-OFF a quick fix, is to reseat the ram or swap them around. </s>
<s> Make sure they're fully seated and use static care when handling. </s>
<s> Then try rebooting again. </s>
