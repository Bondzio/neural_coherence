1.1.1	Hi everyone !	St
1.1.2	I 'm planning to get a new GPU next week , so i just wanted to take your advice on it .	St
1.1.3	My system configuration is Phenom IIx4 945 3.0 ghz GA-880GM-UD2H 4 gigs of ram GPU ( Integrated ) HD4250 Windows7 x32 Since i live in India , i have a budget in my currency that would be equal to around 250-300 $ .	St
1.1.4	I 've been doing a lot of research and found that 6870 is a pretty good deal but then again , the hunger of power never stops , so i checked out 6950 and 6970 but they kind of cross my budget .	St
1.1.5	I also check gtx560 ti and noticed that it is slightly better in performance than 6870 and perhaps on par with the 6950 and 560ti is cheaper than 6950 .	St
1.1.6	I 'm Pretty confused and ca n't decide the best deal for myself.So , i seek advice .	St
1.1.7	I use a monitor with a native resolution of 1600x900 and i 'd really like it if all the heavy games ( crysis , just cause 2 ) run smoothly at least 40fps .	St
1.1.8	Please feel free to suggest anything you may like .	Sug
1.1.9	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	What you could do is to head to tomshardware.com , find the cheapest card on your list and see the test results .	St
1.2.2	You set a SPECIFICATION of 40 FPS and the reviews often show that in games during the test .	St
1.2.3	Seems all you need to do is finish your research .	St
1.2.4	And about POWER .	St
1.2.5	Be sure to see if any mention of the power requirement in Watts or Amperes is noted .	St
1.2.6	A sad thing I encounter a lot is the new upgrader ( the person ) buys a card but the machine 's power supply is too small .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have a cooler master 550gx SMPU , good enough i guess ?	Ques
1.4.1	Sorry no one could know if that 's good enough .	St
1.4.2	For example someone could have a PC with 20 hard drives on it as well or what else ?	Ques
1.4.3	There are plenty of power supply discussions and estimators out there but I ca n't answer this question given such details so far .	St
1.4.4	And even if I had all the parts in the system it still comes with a disclaimer about the health of the parts and the ambient temperature .	St
1.4.5	I think you have some research to do .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
