<s> Hello everyone! </s>
<s> I need some advice on what PC to buy, because I don't understand much of a PC's specifications. </s>
<s> I'm going to mainly use it for games, movies etc. </s>
<s> So I want a good and a fast PC. </s>
<s> Here's the ones I consider buying, but I don't know which one. </s>
<s> So please, can you please read through the specifications. </s>
<s> I have compared them all three there: http://www.elgiganten.dk/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/store-elgigantenDK-Site/da_DK/-/DKK/ViewProductCompare-Show?products=PBDTU7HEG048@store-elgigantenDK|ACDTSKJEQ019@store-elgigantenDK|DEXPS85004196@store-elgigantenDK You can press on the green button &quot;Marker forskellene&quot; and it will highlight the differences. </s>
<s> I don't think you really need to understand Danish, as it is mostly numbers. </s>
<s> Which one should I go for, to play quality games and movies on great settings. </s>
<s> Intel Core or AMD? </s>
<s> Which one of the PCs has the greatest graphic card - NVIDIA GeForce or AMD Radeon? </s>
<s> Can any of those PCs run games like Battlefield 3, Max Payne 3 etc on highest settings? </s>
<s> Please help out. </s>
<s> I really hope to get some good advices. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Please ignore the third PC. </s>
<s> I'm only interested in the first and the second PC now. </s>

<s> That gt620 doesn't even make anyone's list. </s>
<s> Your &quot;gamer&quot; will select a GPU from a list like this list. </s>
<s> -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html The i5 is a great choice. </s>
<s> Why do I write that? </s>
<s> &quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. </s>
<s> It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. </s>

<s> Hey. </s>
<s> I'm not really a hardcore gamer (as some would say), just an average gamer that would like to play once in a while. </s>
<s> I don't need to have maxed out the setings. </s>
<s> I could be running on low settings for all I care. </s>
<s> But I want a smooth PC with a great performance and it should be fast. </s>
<s> I should be able to play those games, maybe not on highest, but medium would definitely do. </s>
<s> So now my choice is either the first PC or the second one. </s>
<s> The first one has a 3rd generation CPU, the second one has 2nd. </s>
<s> Does it matter much? </s>
<s> What is CPU Cache? </s>
<s> Seems like the second one is a bit lower on that. </s>
<s> But would it matter, since the second one has a RAM of 12gb? </s>
<s> What about the RAM speed (MHZ). </s>
<s> Would I be able to feel any difference? </s>
<s> The graphic card - which is better NVIDIA GeForce GT620 or AMD Radeon HD 7470? </s>
<s> The processor - which is better: Intel Core i5 or AMD A10 Vision? </s>
<s> Would it be the latter one, since it has 4 CPU's and the other one has 2? </s>
<s> I heard that i5 should be better though? </s>
<s> I'm sorry for all these questions, but I don't know a lot on this subject. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help and I hope you can answer all my silly questions! </s>
<s> It's like drag racing in the family van. </s>
<s> Doesn't do well at all. </s>
<s> You have a good base but the 620 video card is a problem. </s>
<s> As to the 7470, it may be better. </s>
<s> Hit up tomshardware for scores. </s>
<s> As to the CPU, you picked a winner. </s>
<s> I would not change that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hey Bob. </s>
<s> I think I might go ahead and buy this: http://www.komplett.dk/k/ci.aspx?sku=10746 What do you think? </s>
<s> Is it much better than the ones I suggested above? </s>
<s> You can view the specifications bottom of the page. </s>
<s> http://tech-reviews.co.uk/images/reviews/sp-ss500/large/silverpower%281%29.JPG shows it has dual rails of 17A each. </s>
<s> You will sometimes see those start to falter in a year or two. </s>
<s> At least you know ahead of time. </s>
<s> Good value selections but I would have stuck with the i5. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The powersupply will start to falter in a year or two? </s>
<s> Really? </s>
<s> Would you say that's the only disadvantage of this PC? </s>
<s> Could you take a look at this link: http://www.komplett.dk/k/config.aspx?ConfigSystemId=10746 Under &quot;Stromforsyninger&quot; (means powersupply), there's a list of power supplies to choose. </s>
<s> Which one would you then recommend? </s>
<s> I only noted the issue because if you are in the forums, that combination shows up in a year or 2 with odd failures. </s>
<s> Remember it's not that all will do that. </s>
<s> But it's an odd choice of products so my guess is it's about the money. </s>
<s> Sorry but there are dozens of options at that link. </s>
<s> Your prior posts looked fine as far as a working PC. </s>
<s> As you narrowed it done I took a quick dive into the PSU specs to see if it would be a single or more rail. </s>
<s> I'd want a single rail for this setup or 20+Amperes on the +12V rail. </s>
<s> This is not an offer to write a dissertation on PSU selection. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Find what Amperes you will be putting on each &quot;RAIL&quot;. </s>
<s> It does not have to be exact but it should the numbers &quot;under load.&quot; Now double that and add up the resulting Watts. </s>
<s> For a long life PC you'll want rails that you never exceed 50% of the Amperes for each rail and for total Watts you don't want to exceed 50% of the total Watts the PSU is rated for. </s>
<s> If you're read power supply shootouts like http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/stress-test,1073.html and others you learn that those ratings are usually optimistic and after a year or two are not to be believed as the part ages and loses capacity. </s>
<s> Sure you can go higher on the 50% mark and many use the 75 or 80% of the rating but it's your design. </s>
<s> Make it a good one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hey! </s>
<s> I had a friend to help me and he told me this would do the job: http://gyazo.com/0db463f101a193a087e91a2c4f805bc2.png What do you think? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817207013 Seems nice enough. </s>
<s> Will keep you out of trouble for some time. </s>
