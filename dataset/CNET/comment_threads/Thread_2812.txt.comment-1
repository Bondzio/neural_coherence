My rig has very specific power requirements and this is the only one I can find with the power and user reviews being positive.
Tom's Hardware guide doesn't list it in any reviews, though.
I've vaguely heard of this brand and it seemed to be positive.
The brand that THG recommends , Antec, doesn't put out enough +12V current.
I think the highest for Antec was 19 amps at the +12V.
I'm needing at least 25 amps at the +12V.
There are quite a few other brands that say their PS's put out the required current but THG says many brands fib.
Which brings me back to the subject header....
Thanks for any help
