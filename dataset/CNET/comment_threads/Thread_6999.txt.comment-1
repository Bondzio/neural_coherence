I recently bought a 20&quot; flat panel and I want to improve my video performance.
These are the specs on my PC: Pentium III 800 MHz 512 MB SDRAM 100 MHz NVidia GeForce DDR 64 MB AGP 1X/2X/4X Would I see any noticeable improvement if I just added a mid-level video card like the ATI Radeon 9600 128 MB w/ DVI out or would the CPU/RAM require upgrading as well?
Thanks is advance, P|&lt;
