thanx for your message, regarding the memory slots i looked that up and it seems i have 4 total 2 blue color and 2 black color i cheched crucial.com and it seems i am only allowed ddr modules 400 cl3.
i am not sure what my mobo is since the pc was open box and it didn't come with any manuals nor discs.
thanx for your help...
