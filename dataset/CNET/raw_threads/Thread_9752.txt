Before the upgrade my PC consisted of the following components: - Antec ISK 300-150 - Asus P8H67-I Deluxe - Intel i3 2120 - Corsair DDR3 4GB 1333 Mhz So-dimm - Crucial M4 256 SSD The PC was working normal and it would turn on everytime. I upgraded my PC with the following parts: - Fractal Design Node 304 - Silverstone SST-ST55F-G Strider Gold Series - 550 Watt - EVGA GTX 670 FTW Signature 2 - Hitachi 2,5' HDD 256GB The other parts stayed the same (except for the Antec case which was replaced by the Node). I was pretty happy with my build, until it didn't turn on. I tried to disconnect it from the power outlet for a few minutes, let the capacitors discharge, nothing helped. After a few tries the PC would suddenly start. Also sometimes it would start with a few seconds delay, after hitting the power button. If the pc decides to turn itself on, it will run with no hiccups and no blue screens (tested it with a few hours gaming session). Also I checked the motherboard, the green led is glowing so I'm suspecting the graphics card or the psu. Any other ideas or suggestions that could help me figure it out?

You did too much and hoped for the best. it should have worked but it came on to something went amiss. Now, you need to resolve this by removing the new items for now and build-up again, one item at a time. As I already suggested install the new PSU and allow new case to be the whole system plus the remaining old parts. From the results of the new build and if it works then proceed to add a new item and see how it works. I would overall think the new GPU is causing a problem. It at a tipping point because you seem to be at a go or no go at times. Of course, you should balance the load too, I, thus make sure your new PSU is the single rail type and still spread the load of connections so the voltages aren't overcome. Otherwise you have a dual-rail type and you better balance the load demands. Alas 550W is just about what it needs but on basic principle that means it delivers at least 75% or 80% if rated as such. Otherwise, again its too much for the PSU when all is installed. Dlo all that and come back with results. tada -----Willy &quot;:)
