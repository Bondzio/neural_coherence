i have dual displays on my pc and would like to add a third and i'm seeking advice on what i need hardware wise.
i have the monitors.
i just need an appropriate video card (i.e.
a second video card).
i don't want to spend much money on this.
here are my specs: -i'm running 64-bit vista, to be upgraded to 64-bit win7 shortly.
it's a dell studio xps core i7 pc.
-i believe this is my motherboard:  -my current video card is an ati radeon hd 3450. it handles two displays fine.
-ideally i would have dvi and vga connected monitors to this video card (1920x1080 and 1680x1050) i would like add a third monitor, which i have already, 1600x900.
from what i understand, i can do this by adding a second video card.
but i don't know what to buy.
i know an internal video card has to be compatible and can't go beyond what my motherboard and psu can take.
but i know there are also external usb video cards and i'm wondering if one of those would be the way to go.
i'm not into gaming, but i do video editing.
the ati card works fine for such purposes.
so my third display will be used for work - displaying documents, web browsing, etc.
i would have no problem unplugging the usb attached monitor during video editing if need be.
so i want a cheap solution that will allow for a third display, one that will support the resolution and give a decent picture and not impact the quality of the other two displays.
thanks!
