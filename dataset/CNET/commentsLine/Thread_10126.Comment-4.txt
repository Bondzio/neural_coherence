hi, i just bought a dell dimension 8400. i installed a wireless pci card (d-link g520+) in it, and receive the same blue screen when the machine shuts down.
d-link points to dell.
first line support of dell has no clue.
i am awaiting results of escalation within dell.
any feedback of users having same problem would be welcome.
