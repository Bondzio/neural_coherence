<s> I was wondering how much effect raises your ram does for your pc. </s>
<s> Right now i have a 1 gb of PC2100 DDR. </s>
<s> My question is if i bought 2 sticks of dual channel ram at PC3200 DDR. </s>
<s> would it increase my speed by a large amount. </s>
<s> My Specs 2.53 pentuim 1 gb ram 80 gb hard drive 480 power supply radeon 9800 pro </s>
<s> You need to verify under your manual or latest info from the vendor/mtrbd. </s>
<s> support website what memory can be installed. </s>
<s> Then, proceed to get some benefit from faster ram, however it also ties in with the cpu as well as a good match with FSB/speed. </s>
<s> Even, if the cpu won't help, the benefit will be there but don't expect a &quot;gee whiz effect&quot;, in other words, &quot;wow&quot;. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> ok I read that but friend i want to ask that BY HOW MUCH AMOUNT A DUAL CHANNAL MEMORY INCREASES THE PERFORMENCE AS COMPEARED TO SINGLE CHANNAL, AS I AM PLANNING TO |^ THE MEMORY FROM 256 TO 768 BY ADDING SINGLE STICK OF 512 MB ? </s>
<s> SHOULD I DO THAT OR PROCEED FOR DUAL CHANNAL MAMRY BY APPLYING 256 +2X128+ 256? </s>
