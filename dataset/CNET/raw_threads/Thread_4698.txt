I know for a fact that absolutely nothing happened to the hard disk during transition, so i really don't think it could be a hardware problem, can anyone maybe point me in the right direction? -Motherboard is a socket 754 Nvidia Nforce 3-a w/ Athlon 64-bit 3700+ -Drive is a Samsung 160GB SATA disk. -Windows XP Pro SP2 -2 GB DDR 400 RAM Any thoughts or assitance would be appreciated. Thanks.

I've checked into those links and most seem to suggest a repair install of XP. However, here's what's happening now.... I boot off of the xp cd, ignore the first option to repair, it detects my previous install which i then tell it to repair. Once i do this, it copies all the files and reboots my machine but when the machine comes up nothing happens. Nothing boots, setup does not continue. Ideas?

Now, when i try to boot the machine i no longer get a NTLDR error, the system does a POST, gets to the line about verifying DMI pool data, and does nothing. No errors, no activity, just a blinking cursor, keyboard is useless for anything other than ctrl+alt+del.... My question at this point is even if i reinstall, what happens when i install xp, and it reboots during the process and this happens again?

It's usually something like a dead drive, bad IDE cable, noisy power supply or &quot;other.&quot; I have yet to see it be a Windows issue. At the very lease, try the FIXMBR command. Bob

The SATA cable cam brand new with the new motherboard so i think that can be ruled out. Power supply is fine, and I know for an absolute certainty that the hard drive was working as of last week, nothing has happened to it since. BIOS can see the drive, so can Windows setup, it just refuses to boot. I tried FIXMBR and FIXBOOT from the recovery console and it is still hanging at verifiying DMI pool.... Anymore ideas?

Besides disabling USB, sound, ethernet and what ever else we can we can't use XP's repair and have a booting system. On top of the repair we boot the XP SP2 CD then hit the magic F6 key to supply the NEW SATA drivers for this new board. Bob
