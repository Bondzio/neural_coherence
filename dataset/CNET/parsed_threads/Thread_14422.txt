<s> I've just recently moved to a new house and switched from a broadband connection to DSL, and ever since then, I can't stay connected to AIM or MSN chat services or even connect to Limewire anymore. </s>
<s> I've tried other chat and P2P clients, but still none work. </s>
<s> How can I fix this? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Try the Virus forum and use the tools noted there to clean up as well as WINSOCKFIX (noted in that forum.) </s>
<s> Hopefully you can recover enough to avoid a total wipe and reinstall of this OS. </s>

<s> Woah, calm down. </s>
<s> I run frequent virus scans with several programs, and comes up. </s>
<s> Viruses aren't my problem. </s>
<s> These are not viruses and are well known to damage the OS. </s>
<s> Giddy up. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I run spyware and adware scans frequently too. </s>
<s> But let's get off this subject, please. </s>
<s> If not, why not? </s>
<s> First, please run another scan with Adaware and SpyBot just to be sure nothing snuck in when you weren't looking. </s>
<s> Bob's point in the other subthread is that &quot;frequent scans&quot; isn't frequent enough when something unknown has happened since the last scan. </s>
<s> And if you are running Windows XP, get their new spyware scanner and run it too - it is a very good utility and finds stuff that Adaware and Spybot miss. </s>
<s> Now, on to the next part... DSL is one of many forms of broadband, and it (DSL) comes in many flavors. </s>
<s> It's like saying you just changed your primary form of roadway transport from an automobile to a Chevrolet. </s>
<s> Not much information there - a Chevy is an automobile and Chevy makes a number of models. </s>
<s> So... can you tell us some specifics about your DSL - provider name, connection type, and hardware involved (modem type and is a router in the configuration). </s>
<s> Assuming there are no malware issues and you can get to the general internet without trouble, two possibilities come to mind quickly: you are having a port-forwarding issue for these specific services that needs to be resolved in your modem/routing configuration (or in your software firewalling, if you are using any such); or your ISP is doing some sort of &quot;traffic management&quot; by blocking certain ports or packet types. </s>

<s> I'm have Alltel DSL at 1.5 mbps connection running through a regular router. </s>
<s> Anything else? </s>
