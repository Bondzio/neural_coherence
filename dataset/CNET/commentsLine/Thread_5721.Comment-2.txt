a pc tv tuner card will pick up your analog/basic cable channels but it won't tune satellite at all.
some tv tuner cards can plug into your directv/dish box to control its channel selection and record from the s-video output.
ati has released a tv tuner product that utilizes a cablecard but it is for system builders only (not available in retail) and somewhat problematic.
the-free-tv.com is not &quot;real&quot; us channels.
most are from european feeds and you won't find the content you expect from cable or directv (espn, usa, disney, etc).
