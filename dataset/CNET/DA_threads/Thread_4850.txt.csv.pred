1.1.1	I used a CD disc cleaner,the ones with the little brush on the underside,and now it will not read any CD's whatsoever,but it will still play DVD's?PLEASE HELP	St
1.2.1	Seen such... We swap the drive out and move that unit to the pile of the dead.	St
1.2.2	I'm seeing DVD all format recorders fall to under 50 bucks so it's not that big a repair bill.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	The use of CD drive cleaners are not encouraged.	St
1.3.2	During the cleaning process, that one small plastic or cloth strip (that breaks in multiple strips after use) pushes the lens reader of the CD drive.	St
1.3.3	In such process, there are times that the strip mis-aligns the lens alignment, hence, you will get a disc reading problem.	St
1.3.4	Lens alignment is expensive and it could only be done by using a lens alignment/lens distance measuring device.	St
1.3.5	The lens does not get so much dirt (unless you are working in a fabric company that some fabrics go into the lens) since it does not touch anything during the reading process.	St
1.3.6	Only the IR LED does the reading.	St
