I just purchased a XFX GeForce 6800 Xtreme 256MB AGP w/Dual DVI that needs system power supply with minimum 450 Watts or higher After doing some research I'm not sure what computer to put it in and if I need to up grade the power supply.
I have a new Dell 1100 with the following specs: Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU 2.53GHz 2.6GHz Memory Slot 1 [DIMM_1] 256Mb Memory Slot 2 [DIMM_2] 256Mb Display Adapters Intel(R) 82865G Graphics Controller 96Mb I also have and older Dell 4400: PROCESSOR, 80531, 1.6G, 0, 400FSB, SOCKET N, D0 DUAL IN-LINE MEMORY MODULE,1G, 266M, 32X64, 8K, 184 CARD (CIRCUIT), GRAPHICS, 16MB, ATI TECHNOLOGIES INC, ULTRA, FULL HEIGHT I am assuming that the newer 1100 is the way to got but I can't find any information on power supply and I don't want to fry my new card.
Any info would help.
