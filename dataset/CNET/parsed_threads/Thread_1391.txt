<s> Hey all, I have a 2 year old pc with decent specs but nothing special when it comes to the video card. </s>
<s> I'm looking to upgrade so that I can play Diablo 3 on decent settings. </s>
<s> I am not sure which video card is in my range ($50-100) and would be compatible with my PC, and/or if I need to upgrade my power supply first. </s>
<s> Below are my specs. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated! </s>
<s> &gt; Inspiron 580 &gt; Mainboard : Dell 0C2KJT &gt; Chipset : Intel H57 &gt; Processor : Intel Core i5 760 @ 2800MHz &gt; Physical Memory : 6144MB 3 x 2048 DDR3-SDRAM &gt; Video Card : ATI Radeon HD 5450 &gt; Hard Disk : Western Digital WD1001FAES-75W7A0 ATA Device (1000GB) &gt; DVD-Rom Drive : HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW GH50 &gt; Operating System : Windows 7 Home Premium Home Edition Media Center 6.01.7601 Service Pack 1 (64-bit) &gt; DirectX : Version 11.00 &gt; Windows Performance Index : 4.9 on 7.9 </s>
<s> The neat part here is you are starting with that 5450. </s>
<s> That card is fine. </s>
<s> It should run that game but most want more. </s>
<s> Here's the list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html You can pick from that list in the price range and then see if you have enough Amperes and Watts in your PSU. </s>
<s> You didn't supply the PSU rating so I can't comment. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If I'm looking at the proper machine. </s>
<s> That unit is a slim-line or a mini-tower with a 300w psu. </s>
<s> Neither case is designed for gaming You might need a low profile card. </s>
<s> With a 300w psu you might not be able to move up the gpu ladder. </s>
<s> Even a GF gt440 might push the psu into overload. </s>
