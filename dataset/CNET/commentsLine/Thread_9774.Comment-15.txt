1. in your original post &quot; ali alimagik 1 chipset, iwill award bios, 128mb nvidia agp video card, 512mb ddr ram, 2hd, cdr, dvd.
i am running windows xp pro.&quot; the exact make/model of the motherboard would be helpful.
2.
&quot;a few weeks ago, the computer started to randomly reboot.
sometimes it would reboot in repeatedly and then remain stable.&quot; &quot;amli: acpi bios is attempting to write an illegal io port address (0x70), which lies in the 0x70-0x71 protected address range..&quot; this is at the crux of the problem.
while i can suggest you try other settings, you appear to not be able to find them.
so i'm left to tell you the bad news.
i've avoided calling it doa, but now i have to.
the machine has a xp incompatible bios and unless your motherboard maker has a bios update to cure this item #2, then you have the wrong os for this motherboard.
xp has doomed a few motherboards to the scrap pile.
at least you can fix it for not too much money.
