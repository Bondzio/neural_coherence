u didnt mention if there was a beep after clearing ur cmos but if u cant post and the fan on your video card isnt working it sounds as though maybe you should try a known good used video card to see if this fixes your problem.
the chipset on ur video card requires the fan otherwise the manufacturer would not have installed it.
hope this is of some use.
