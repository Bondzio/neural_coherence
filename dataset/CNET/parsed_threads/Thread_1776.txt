<s> I can't build my own and I'm not interested in having one built by a local shop. </s>
<s> Do any of the well known computer companies offer US based telephone support? </s>

<s> I'm running a 5 year old Dell that has had no problems other than the time I installed some beta software and had to reinstall Windows. </s>
<s> I needed some help with that. </s>
<s> Macs aren't a consideration for me but I do appreciate your response. </s>
<s> It's downright pleasant compared to Windows. </s>
<s> It even asks if I want to retain my files. </s>
<s> Does Windows even ask? </s>
<s> Something's very wrong with Windows in my opinion. </s>
<s> It treats our files with such disrespect and installing does take a guru. </s>
<s> Why not switch? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I had to use them for several years when working at a school district. </s>
<s> Just didn't like them at all. </s>
<s> Maybe no windows based company has US support. </s>
<s> If not, I guess I will just stay with Dell again. </s>
