i'm switching to a mac from a pc and have been trying to decide which model to get.
for a number of reasons, rational and emotional, i've settled on the imac g5.
i was wondering about the various configurations and this question seems at least a little relevant.
if you (the collective you) had the choice between a 20&quot; display with 1gb of memory or a 17&quot; display with 1.5gb, which side of the equation would you come down on?
(i think i've officially entered the nit-picky phase of selection).
thanks, jay
