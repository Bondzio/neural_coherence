hi bob, thanks for the reply.
admittedly the 300w psu i'm using isn't exactly new, but was working on a similar spec machine.
with regard to what starts, it will start fully to windows once only and will restart from any point, but after a full shut down it won't start again for, well, hours it seems.
then there's absolutely nothing, no fans, no lights, nothing.
i have other psus and will dig out another to see if it makes any difference.
thanks, minskin
