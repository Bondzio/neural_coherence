but first all this is not easy stuff.
you will find folk that want easy but this area is not.
so look at the router and see if it supports sending information via smnp and then look for a software that runs on the pc to collect that data.
finally you'll have to set up how to filter all that data.
many folk are unaware that this is going to be work on their part if they don't want to pay a few thousand for a solution in a can.
