I have a similar problem with a Sony SDM X73.
I assume it is overheating but it may significant that the problem started to manifest itself after I tried an 'electronic whiteboard' attachment (a 'Sympodium')... to my computer (a Viglem VM4 Cube) In any case, powering the monitor off , leaving, then powering on again works .
I also look forward to any ideas on this one.
