<s> I purchased the sbg900 earlier this week and i am using the wireless for two macbooks and an xbox 360. i have a WEP password on it and i had to put the 360 on the nat passthrough so i could connect to xbox live. </s>
<s> The problem i am having is that everytime i turn on the 360 or either one of the macbooks they will not connect to it so i have to unplug the sbg900 and then try to connect to it again. </s>
<s> It always connects after i unplug it but it is just extremely annoying having to unlpug the modem/router every time i want to connect to the internet. </s>
<s> In our forum sticky we don't suggest WEP, filters or much else fancy. </s>
<s> You are repeating well worn problems. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
