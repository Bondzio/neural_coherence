<s> I have this SAMSUNG 400GB PATA drive that spins OK but Windows wants to initialise all the time. </s>
<s> I have tried EASYRECOVERY PROFESSIONAL and it says there's no file system on it: the rapid SMART TEST shows the drive passes the test; so i tried the raw data recovery option, but after 5 minutes i get an error message and the drive starts clicking, so i stopped it immediately. </s>
<s> I tried R-Studio and it too sees the drive with no file system, attempts a RAW recovery but there again after 5 minutes the drive starts to click and i stop it . </s>
<s> Now, i boot from UBUNTU CD , UBUNTU RESCUE REMIX or even KNOPPIX, and none of them sees the drive !!! </s>
<s> Any idea how to get my data back ? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> It might be interesting if you told what that error message is. </s>
<s> The best way to get your data back is from your backup. </s>
<s> The second best way is by paying a data recovery company. </s>
<s> With disks that fail mechanically, as appears to be the case with this one, that's quite expensive. </s>

<s> I've just downloaded the Samsung utility test and it passed with flying colors all the tests: READ DMA SPIN DOWN/UP CHECK SMART SIMPLE SURFACE SCAN WRITE VERIFY RANDOM SURFACE SCAN RAM VERIFY TEST MULTIPLE READ TEST &quot; YOUR DD HAS NO ERROR !&quot; it says... &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> So it's a perfect drive. </s>
<s> But: - it's unpartitioned (RAW) - recovery stops after 5 minutes If you trust that diagnostic, you simply repartition it, loose all your data and hope for the best. </s>
<s> But you said you want to recover your data, so maybe that wouldn't be your preferred idea. </s>
<s> All I can offer: try the other recovery programs from http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-354911.html Maybe one works. </s>
<s> Maybe none work. </s>
<s> You'll only know when you try. </s>
