1.1.1	XP Home SP3 P4 2.8 2 GB RAM 30 GB ide C drive , 100 ide GB Slave drive ( F ) , CD-ROM RW ide master ( D ) , DVD-ROM RW SATA master ( E ) , floppy drive installed .	St
1.1.2	BIOS version is A12 .	St
1.1.3	Original was A7 .	St
1.1.4	Spring cleaning arrived , so I took system apart and canned air cleaned , put fresh paste on cpu ( original paste ) , and opened the PSU and canned air in there .	St
1.1.5	Since I updated the BIOS about a year ago , I had both ROM drives as bootable .	St
1.1.6	( Lucky me ) Something changed about two months ago , as the CD-ROM stopped booting as before .	St
1.1.7	The DVD still booted but I wanted to restore this functionality , so I disconnected the SATA ROM and the 100 GB ide drive ( to prevent a drive letter change ) as part of this project .	St
1.1.8	What prompted the cleaning was a change in power-on light behavior .	St
1.1.9	It recently started to flash a quick yellow for just a moment , then solid green power light .	St
1.1.10	Computer ran perfectly until yesterday .	St
1.1.11	I also lost the DVD drive yesterday .	St
1.1.12	It would not see a disc when inserted any more .	St
1.1.13	Nero said it lost communication with the light-scribe DVD drive and produced a window text error only .	St
1.1.14	Disconnecting the two drives caused the A12 BIOS to start very slowly , normal operation POST was done in seven seconds , now three minutes .	St
1.1.15	I removed the CMOS battery to clear the settings and reinserted .	St
1.1.16	No change , except time and date had to be set .	St
1.1.17	Boot order would not stick , default was HDD , floppy , CD-ROM , no matter how many times I tried to reset as CD-ROM , floppy , HDD .	St
1.1.18	Would not work .	St
1.1.19	Time and date did stick , though .	St
1.1.20	Downloaded a new A12 BIOS patch from Dell , ran it in Windows , it restarted and waited an hour for it to finish .	St
1.1.21	Never completed flash , so I powered down .	St
1.1.22	Before I flashed the BIOS , the diagnostic lights A , B , C , in back of unit were green , D light was yellow ( with the DVD and 100 GB HDD disconnected . )	St
1.1.23	I checked all drive connections , found ok. Windows was still coming up , but the POST was inordinately long .	St
1.1.24	Now have a solid yellow power light and no POST , no video , no beeps .	St
1.1.25	CD-ROM does flash a couple of times , as does the HDD light , then stops , but then with all peripherals disconnected just a solid yellow power light .	St
1.1.26	( Sigh ) What happened ?	Ques
1.1.27	Can this be fixed ?	Ques
1.2.1	It appears you have an older Dell PC .	St
1.2.2	You also have the CD and DVD drives plus 2 HDs , this in turn probably put stress on the PSU .	St
1.2.3	The OEM PSU was n't intended for added items even if it worked , it was over-taxed for too long .	St
1.2.4	It finally gave out .	St
1.2.5	I suspect the PSU is bad and it might even work , if you repeatly retry powering-ON now and then .	St
1.2.6	Due to wear & tear it saw better days .	St
1.2.7	replace PSU with similar or better wattage that physically fits .	St
1.2.8	The long boot times is a reflection of simply getting the juice it needs and basically was in a downward spiral of operation .	St
1.2.9	If you allowed the bad drives to remain as well these may have also burden the PSU further if power related failures , so problems plus age do n't do well together .	St
1.2.10	I find Dell PSU work well but a 250W or 300W PSU is easily going to be less capable when adding more to the mix .	St
1.2.11	For now , replace PSU and hope that is all , have an old capable PSU laying around to test ?	Ques
1.2.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	PSU will be swapped out and we 'll see .	St
1.3.2	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	the CMOS Battery ... usually a CR2032 .	St
1.4.2	Let us know .	St
1.4.3	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	CMOS battery has been in service for less than year , will replace it anyway .	St
1.5.2	Thanks .	Polite
