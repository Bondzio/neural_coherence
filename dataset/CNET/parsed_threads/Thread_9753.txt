<s> Hi: I have purchased a Webcam (Model No &quot;SN9C103&quot; make Tevion) in last year. </s>
<s> This Webcam was working perfectly fine with Windows XP operating system loaded on my old laptop. </s>
<s> I changed my laptop, which has &quot;Windows Vista&quot; pre-loaded on it. </s>
<s> Now I am trying to install this Webcam on the new laptop and it is not getting installed. </s>
<s> During installation, I am getting a message &quot;Not enough storage is available to complete this operation&quot;. </s>
<s> Can anybody help in installing this Webcam? </s>
<s> Warm Regards Chandrashekhar S. Joshi </s>
<s> http://www.sonix.com.tw/sonix/product.do?p=SN9C103 I had some trouble tracking this down. </s>
<s> It is not a Vista driver. </s>
<s> I hope this is the brand name/Manufacturer for this Web Cam. </s>
<s> Of the few sites that did list some form of driver for it, none said they had a driver for Vista. </s>
<s> Seek out the manufacturer of this product and see if the driver is available from there web site. </s>
<s> I had the same problem with a web cam and the simplest solution was to get a new one. </s>
<s> Also, I have McAfee site advisor on my computer and I don't believe I've ever seen so few sites reviewed or so many yellow warnings then I had on this search. </s>
<s> Where did you get that thing? </s>
<s> There certainly in a bad neighborhood. </s>
<s> Download & install this driver. </s>
<s> It worked for me. </s>

<s> Hi Cris: Thanks a lot for helping me out and sending the link. </s>
<s> Downloaded the drivers on the link given by you. </s>
<s> But they do not work. </s>
<s> The 1st & 3rd driver on the list didn't work for me either, but I tried the 31 bit one and it worked immediately. </s>
<s> that other guy gave that drivers for it are available. </s>
<s> The part number should be listed on the WebCam or on the driver CD/DVD, if not check the settings program within all programs. </s>
<s> Some times drivers aren't created/designed correctly so they don't work. </s>
<s> Contact this site for assistance. </s>
<s> One last note try totally uninstalling the driver before you install those available from this site. </s>
<s> This will provide a &quot;clean&quot; install of the driver. </s>
<s> Over wrighting them sometimes causes trouble. </s>
<s> A question do you like the webcam when it works? </s>
<s> How is the HiRes? </s>
<s> Is it really clear? </s>
<s> what i did was uninstall using this driver, once uninstalled reinstalled then when asked to restart do it, once restarted it will ask to carry on 5 seconds later... done ready to use... this is the link you need... http://www.trust.com/support/download.aspx?item=14383&download=http://drivers.trust.com/CAM_WEB/14383_03.exe </s>

<s> Warm Regards Chandrashekhar S. Joshi </s>
<s> Thanks also for the info but I cant link my web-cam to MSN. </s>
<s> MSN tells me that my cam is either not plugged in or it &quot;busy&quot;. </s>
