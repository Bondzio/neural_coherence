1.1.1	Im going to need a PC that will run a few apps and probably a couple of games that dont require high-end graphics.	St
1.1.2	I looked around and came up with these specifications: Intel Core 2 Duo [2.6 GHz] DDR2 Ram [2 GB] Hard Disk (sata) [250 GB] Graphics Card [256 MB] Now, I'd like to know if this will do the job and also if there are any additional things that I'm going to need other than a case.	St
1.2.1	Everyone seems to forget the psu(power supply) and is taken for granted.	St
1.2.2	All too often supplied with a new case while they work, may not for long or be underpowered.	St
1.2.3	A decent system needs a good psu in order to remain stable and provide steady outputs.	St
1.2.4	If you plan not to get into heavy gaming and generally a typical home system, a 500W+ psu will do fine.	St
1.2.5	There are cheap offerings out there in the 500W range and when you look into the matter see the difference price makes and what will suit you.	St
1.2.6	I take it seriously the lack of a decent psu in new systems, because of the reasons above.	St
1.2.7	Everything else you mentioned seems OK. Use common sense and proceed, good luck.	St
1.2.8	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	the configs are ok try to improve the VGA and get somethng good, try some awesome multimedia accessories tooo	St
1.4.1	Be sure to get good RAM don't get anything less than PC2 6400 and be sure its a decent brand like Kingston or Corsair.	St
1.4.2	Maybe upgrade the graphics card.	St
1.5.1	Two gigabytes can run a server and 256 megabytes can run a desktop and an emulated layer with games on each.	St
1.6.1	like the thing you need would be under $450.	St
1.7.1	If you can try to go for an Nvidia GeForce 9600GT graphics card with 512MB vram.	St
1.7.2	Make sure that the SMPS or PSU (the power supply)is 500W or better.	St
1.7.3	Try to get a DVD writer, its helpful in data backup.	St
1.7.4	If you're going to watch movies you can add a Blu Ray player at a later date when Blu Ray discs become mainstream.	St
1.7.5	Go for a decent 19&quot; LCD monitor or better	St
