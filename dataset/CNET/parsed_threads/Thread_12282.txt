<s> I built this computer about 8 months ago and very rarely it would just shut off (1 time a month). </s>
<s> Well over the last month it has become very frequent, randomly occuring more often to the point now it will only run for about 1 min and shut off and it happens while it is just sitting idle. </s>
<s> I do not get an error message upon restart and it just starts back up when I push the power button. </s>
<s> I replaced the PSU and that did not fix or even help the problem. </s>
<s> I have monitored the CPU and mobo temps, they seem to be running between 35 and 45 deg C. I am in the process of tearing it apart and verifying all connections again. </s>
<s> Im kind of at a loss as to where to go next short of replacing each component until the problem goes away... </s>
<s> If anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate it. </s>

<s> If it helps you know it's some part getting too warm or a part has become temperature sensitive. </s>
<s> Does not tell us much more. </s>
<s> I've seen such machines and always wonder why folk build them. </s>
