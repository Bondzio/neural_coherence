the process is complete... i'm sold.
lol... i'll be doing this from now on.
no other real problems to note.
ran into a slight snag trying to figure out how to connect the 20-pin power cable to the board but once i figurd out that it only went in 1 way(the board supports 24-pin ssi psu's) it worked great.
then i ran into some trouble trying to format the drive and as a last resort stuck the win xp cd in and it took over from there.
very nice if i do say so myself.
formatted the 136gb or so partition that i set up for c: then later in windows formatteed the rest for my mp3's.
i'm pretty sure i've got all the drivers installed as everything seems to be working fine.
i've got a thermometer sitting on the top fan and it ran about as high as 78f yesterday and hasnt gone above 70 today so i think it's staying pretty cool.
the antec psu, 2 case fans, and the hd fan are keeping the heat level down nicely.
havent gotten it into any games to really test the head dissapation yet.
that's on the list of things to do shortly... anyhow, here ends build #1. did have a question though... dual channel ddr; what exactly is it?
is the idea that it's able to do twice as much as the same amount of single channel?
cause i've got a gig of dc ddr, and if my assumption is true then it would be comperable to 2 gigs of sc ddr... also how far would i have to overclock the 3200+ to get to the performance level of a stock 3500+?
i probably wont for a while but was just wondering how hard it would be/how much it would take.
