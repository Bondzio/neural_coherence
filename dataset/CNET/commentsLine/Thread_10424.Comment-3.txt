hi shinyame, like you, i just bought cx4700 3 weeks ago.
everything works except the scanner.
i tried everything, reinstalling the software, download latest software and driver, etc, but to no avail.
both my laptops having the same problem.
i searched and googled and finally i found another forums where some people was having problem with their usb scanner (not epson) and some one suggested that the usb cable might be the problem.
the usb1.1 cable doesn't have a good shielding compared to the usb2.0.
today, i went back to the shop and specifically requested a usb2.0 cable.
they gave me a usb cable from cooler master.
on the back of the package it says it's usb1.1 and usb2.0 compatible and it has emi shielding.
after i plugged it in, the scanner works perfectly.
i hope this works for you.
good luck.
tian
