First, is this going to be a master/boot drive or is it going to be a slave to one that already exists?
What disk are you using to create the partitions?
One that came with the harddrive from Seagate or a windows bootdisk?
What version windows is the bootdisk for and does it match with what you plan to install on the drive or already is installed on another drive?
If you are using this drive as a slave, are you accidently working with the boot drive and don't realize it?
