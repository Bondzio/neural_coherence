<s> Hi there, I have just recently built a new system and have a question about the memory settings. </s>
<s> Here is the mobo, CPU and memory being used. </s>
<s> Intel DX38BT motherboard, Intell Core 2 Quad Q6700, and Corsair TWIN3X2048-1333C9 The memory is DDR3 capable of running at 1333MHz I have a total of 4GB of ram, so four 1GB modules. </s>
<s> Here is my question. </s>
<s> I've been reading places that the memory is 1.7V memory and the mobo is setup (default) to run at 1.5V. </s>
<s> Corsair's website shows that the SPD is set at 7-7-7-20 at 1066MHz and nothing about the voltage. </s>
<s> It also states that the memory was tested at 1.7V, 9-9-9-24 at 1333MHz. </s>
<s> There were some people stating problems with the PC locking up over time because of the 1.5V setting. </s>
<s> What I was wondering was, can I leave the 7-7-7-20 settings and up the voltage to 1.7V with no issues? </s>
<s> My other question is should I be using the 9-9-9-24 settings if I decide to up the voltage to 1.7V? </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance... </s>
<s> &quot;What I was wondering was, can I leave the 7-7-7-20 settings and up the voltage to 1.7V with no issues?&quot; http://www.corsair.com/products/xms3.aspx shows that's beyond it's spec so I'll write you should run it at the specified and supported settings. </s>
<s> If you are OVERCLOCKING then you are off the reservation and no one can tell you will be fine. </s>

<s> 1.7v is the necessary voltage to achieve ddr3-1333. </s>
<s> See http://www.corsair.com/_datasheets/TWIN3X2048-1333C9.pdf: &quot;Tested together at 1333MHz, Vdimm = 1.70V, at latency settings of 9-9-9-24&quot; You'll have to manually select ddr3-1333 and enter the 9...24 timings, otherwise it will default 1.5v (ddr3 standard voltage) and ddr3-1066 timings. </s>
<s> You can try to keep the tighter 7...20 timings at ddr3-1333 but there's no guarantee it will work reliably. </s>
<s> You should run some memory tests and super pi loops to ensure the system will be stable. </s>
