1.1.1	I have ATT DSL internet service with a 2wire wireless network router , which works ok , except for sporadic service interruptions .	St
1.1.2	From time to time there are 5-6 laptops and a printer working from it wirelessly and a Dish Network receiver wired to it .	St
1.1.3	Problem is ; I have two other Dish receivers that need to be connecter by wire in different rooms/floors away from where the current 2wire router is located .	St
1.1.4	Is there something I can used to connect these receivers by wire to my existing wireless network from 2wire ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks for any help !	St
1.2.1	I assume you just can not run ethernet cable which is the best and most reliable .	St
1.2.2	There are 2 popular options .	St
1.2.3	The ethernet over powerline and a ethernet to wireless bridge .	St
1.2.4	The wireless bridge method tends to be a little cheaper and simpler to setup .	St
1.2.5	The system that carry the data over your electrical lines once they are setup are much less susceptible to random loss than wireless .	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bill - Correct , I do n't want to run wires all over the house .	St
1.3.2	The Ethernet to wireless bridge sound like what I want to do .	St
1.3.3	Would the Linksys WET610N or similar be the device I would need .	St
1.3.4	Also , do you know if they make one of these with multi-port ?	Ques
1.3.5	Since I 'm hooking up the Dish receiver , if there is a multi-port device I could use the same device to hook-up the Blu-ray and TV .	St
1.3.6	I did n't think about those yesterday .	St
1.3.7	Again , thanks for the help .	Polite
1.4.1	I picked up the WGPS606 for 25 refurb and liked it so much I now have 2 .	St
1.4.2	Look at that one too .	St
