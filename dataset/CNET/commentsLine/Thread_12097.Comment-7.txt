i wouldn't worry about making the change any time soon.
using cat5e jacks with cat6 cable will indeed downgrade the link performance to cat5e.
but... the category 5e standard was written to support gigabit ethernet (1000 megabit).
even a very fast internet connection (at least here in the us) will only be about a 15 megabit per second connection.
