i did a quick google and found various models# based on your initial one provided.
knowing the &quot;full mode#l&quot; or one listed on the decal not badge plate will help.
in most cases when pcs can't boot and already provided to you by others is either flaky psu or bad caps.
bad caps can also be part of a bad psu.
in turn repeated reboots or such usually clears the immediate problem until next time.
typically, i inspect closely for bad caps(google for examples and if nothing found, just replace the psu.
if the psu is the original supplied, it has seen batter days.
if you have also upgraded your pc or added much, that too can make a psu suffer on more wattage demands and start to degrade.
to include any prolonged &quot;heat stress&quot; environments, so clean out the pc if found dusty, etc.. all this maybe too late unless the above psu is replaced.
for now, i exclude any s/w glitches or driver issues.
it always good to be up to date on everything, like drivers, ms updates, bios, etc.
until completed.
but, don't do this until your boot problem is resolved or you want to proceed regardless, since it wants to boot when warmed-up.
