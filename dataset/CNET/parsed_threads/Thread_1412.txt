<s> I have a old pentium 2 computer with a 3 gig hard drive. </s>
<s> My uncle thought it would be &quot;nice&quot; to format that and then give me windows xp pro along with microsoft office. </s>
<s> I now have about 400 mb of space LEFT( he thought that was soooo funny). </s>
<s> I put in another 3 gig hard drive that has already been formated and is compleatly empty. </s>
<s> my question is what do I now need to do to make everything work, AND transfer some stuff from one to the other. </s>
<s> Or whatever will work the best. </s>
<s> HELP!!!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Lib, Why don't you ask your uncle :-)? </s>
<s> I wonder if the machine (speed of CPU, amount of RAM, speed of hard disk) is up to Windows XP Pro, even if you upgrade it to 6 (=3+3) Gb hard disk. </s>
<s> It might be better to go back to what it was (Windows 98?). </s>
<s> Tell more about it for advice. </s>
<s> If you can see the empty hard drive in My Computer and Windows Explorer, it is already working and will be called d:. </s>
<s> It will come in handy even if you decide to go back to Windows 98. </s>
<s> The best thing to do is to move &quot;My Documents&quot; to that drive, and take care to put all your personal files there. </s>
<s> http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1566676,00.asp tells how to do it (quite simple, in fact). </s>
<s> And you might consider to uninstall MS Office and reinstall that to a folder on that drive. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> MS Office, while nice may be too much for such a machine. </s>
<s> I want to share that Open Office from http://www.openoffice.org is not very big (megabytes on the hard disk) and will give you the word processor, powerpoint and spreadsheet you may want with great compatibility with MS Office. </s>

<s> You didn't mention what PII cpu was present but even so, the system with XP pro on it will work hard just with it alone. </s>
<s> In the long haul, the system just can't handle the excessive demands of that OS even though MS says it can. </s>
<s> It will be slow and outright be a slug, compared to at least win98. </s>
<s> If anything, try a larger hard drive of at least 10gb or better and use it alone in the system with XP pro for simpliticy sake. </s>
<s> I just wouldn't recommend your arrangement now with XP, I think you'll see that as you get on. </s>
<s> sorry... enjoy -----Willy </s>
