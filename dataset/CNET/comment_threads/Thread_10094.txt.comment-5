so in short we are being mislead with false advertising such as these devices being able to perform when infact they dont !
all i am looking for is a sound device that allows me to share media files to other connected devices on my network, seems like i am fighting a loosing battle .
The questions are so easy if you already know the answers ?
if you never ask then how do we learn ?
a fundemental learning curve !
can you offer any solutions to my issue ?
would like to have this capacity on my network but now realise nas drives are not the answer.
I am currently using a netgear DGND3700 router but the ready share feature i am not to convinced with either ie; supporting a 2 TB external Hard drive ?
