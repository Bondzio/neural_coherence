you'll see a link to an open source firmware replacement.
from there you'll find a list of supported devices.
unfortunately, i don't see your routers in the list.
i also don't see them in the list of compatible router but i also don't see them in the list of incompatible routers.
i suppose this gives you the option to try this on your own if you don't mind running the risk of bricking one of your devices.
