1.2.1	if you carry your laptop around everywhere, then the iPad is a smaller, lighter, device that boots instantly and will do all of the &quot;roaming around town&quot; stuff that the laptop does.	St
1.2.2	mail, facebook, twitter, itunes, facetime are all well within the capabilities of the ipad.	St
1.2.3	is it essential to have both, No.	St
1.2.4	is it fun, Yes.	St
