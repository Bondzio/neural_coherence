thank you all of your discussion about ram.
my machine is a notebook with intel pentium m 730 processor (2 mb l2 cache, 1.6 ghz, 533 mhz fsb) centrino, 512mb ddr.
i was thinking to upgrade ram but now i think i do not need to upgrade.
your discussion helps me to take a right decision to upgrade ram or not to upgrade.
thank you again.
