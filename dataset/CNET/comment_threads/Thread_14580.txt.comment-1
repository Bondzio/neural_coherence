I was at Best Buy today looking for a new monitor and found the Samsung 215TW.
As far as I can tell, this is a new product that should not be on the shelves yet.
It is not yet on the US Samsung website (although it is on the Canadian site) and I have found only one site that has this as a pre-order.
Anyway, the price was good so I bought it and I was wondering if anyone knows anything about this product.
