Will Ram with different Timings work together?
I currently have 2gb of ddr2 800 corsair cm2x1024-6400c4 g which has lower timings then the stuff of that model im finding on newegg and i want to add some more ram.
Will it work together still?
Also would it be worth going to ddr3 1333 or just stick with the ddr2 800 i have?
Is there even a notice difference?
