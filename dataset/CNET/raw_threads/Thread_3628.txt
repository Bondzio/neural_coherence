My Easytune 6 normally reads as below Avg. System Temperature: 45CAvg. CPU Temperature: 60C I normally use it for running virtual machine or vmware server. Today twice my system got restarted due to excessive load/heat. Easytune 6 reading slightly went above the normal. I would like to know what is the standard reading for this configuration. Also i am going to buy another Vengeance? - 4GB Single Module DDR3 Memory Kit soon. Please advise to overcome this heat problem considering i will be overclocking and upgrading more RAM in future.

If it appears to be securely mounted, you might remount/reseat or preferably REPLACE the heatsink fan with something more robust....especially if you intend to OC. I'd start by looking at the ratings over http://www.frostytech.com and then look at buyer reviews over at http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=574&amp;name=CPU-Fans-Heatsinks . I've been very pleased with the Xigmatek offerings and even though I've always bought retail CPUs that come with heatsink fans, I haven't used any of them in the systems I've built over the last 15-20 years You might also explore case cooling options with better ....higher CFM, low-noise fans at stores like FrozenCPU.com, Coolerguys.com, etc.,. Suggest using PCWizard to monitor temp until you get the system and CPU temps under control. http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/pc-wizard.html Let us know how it works. VAPCMD

Is this suppose to be a water-cooled setup? Have you completed the install of it? If not or I digress then what air cooling is involved. Further, are you sure this setup was done properly, using cpu paste, secured mounting and/or correct one to include the right HSF for that cpu type and rating. Have optional case cooling fans been installed? Come back with results. I only mention this if they maybe required as std. install and not present. Verify what the heat range in the bios the &quot;default &quot; is, though I suspect it should be correct. Also, the bios setting for &quot;temp overheat&quot; while also at default, what action does it take, shutdown, reboot or slows down(cpu setting only). 60C is too much IMHO. I like to see in the 50C+ range when it gets high. However, proper cooling even if it reports high can make it all work well. The monitoring s/w too often reports incorrectly and should be taken at 10% off value. Core i7 920 specs webpage: http://www.intel.com/products/processor/corei7/specifications.htm tada -----Willy
