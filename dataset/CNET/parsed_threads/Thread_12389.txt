<s> This is the second time that i tried to build my own PC. </s>
<s> the first was a success but i am having trouble with this new motherboard. </s>
<s> PROBLEM: when i turn on the motherboard the cpu fan spins and so does the power supply case...but my MONITOR doesnt display anything! </s>
<s> it has a VGA port that i plugged the monitor into. </s>
<s> does the motherboard have to be inside a computer case? </s>
<s> this is the same monitor that i'm using right now. </s>
<s> Am i forgeting something?! </s>
<s> here is the mogherboard info: http://store.yahoo.com/bilsystem-store/modupcm815bu.html </s>
<s> With what little you've written, it's likely that you didn't get any BEEPS from the setup. </s>
<s> In short, the setup is incorrect, has the CMOS reset jumper in the reset position or another flaw/incompatible RAM/parts. </s>
<s> In short, contact the vendor to ask for a working system. </s>

<s> I do that all the time, having the mtrbd. </s>
<s> apart from the case. </s>
<s> You *may* need to grd. </s>
<s> it for a 100% sure connection, but the p/s cable should do that, but you never know. </s>
<s> Further, you should try to clear the CMOS usding the cmos pins for that purpose to start from scracth the mtrbd. </s>
<s> defaults and have only a minimal system and then try it. </s>
<s> Plus make sure all connections are fully seated and that no other &quot;shortening&quot; possibilities are present with the mtrbd. </s>
<s> so loosely assembled. </s>
<s> Any beeps or burps during boot-up? </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> ok try going into the bios and enabling the agp or vga video display look for something like that depending if you have an accelorated graphics card or regular vga... you must specify in bios good luck </s>
