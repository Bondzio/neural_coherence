Question : Does anyone know where I can find info about all the updates done on my Gigabyte motherboard's BIOS (Model Number EP45-UD3R) that includes details about what precautions I need to take to avoid damaging my system after the BIOS?
(For example, some BIOS require editting certain settings in Vista before hand in order to function properly.)
This site has a short description of what new features there are, but nothing about precautions you need to take.
Additional info : I'm having problems with my second disk on my computer, and searching on google some people resolved the problem by updating their motherboards BIOS.
Basically either my disk has gone bad or I need to update my BIOS.
I'm doing a disk check now.
However, before updating the BIOS I want to read the accompanying info about the updates to see if there is any chance it could fix my issues and to avoid doing an update if it is, for some reason, incompatible with my system.
All I can find is this: http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3013#bios Motherboard Model Number EP45-UD3R I have the original BIOS (version F3) I've never flashed BIOS before, and I don't want to do it without reading the accompanying docs on it.
