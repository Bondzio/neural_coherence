What happens if you doubleclick it? I'm rather sure that Windows won't run if ALL program files were converted to .lnk files. Explorer.exe for example is a rather essential program to run and it seems you still have your desktop, so Explorer.exe must be running. So maybe it's just a subset that you changed by accident? So tell more.

All of a sudden my desktop icons went from their usual designs to a file-looking format. And I can't run most programs. My RegSeeker icon and my recycle bin icon are normal looking, but I still can't run them. I have to go to my start menu to run my ISP. I've gotten into my Regedit folder and tried to get permission to edit, but am denied. Going into my File type tab and trying to enter an exe application won't cure my problem either.
