your new m/b can be purchased with the features you want.
if you wish to use the existing memory and cpu the board must support them.
you must also match the size of the purchased m/b to the case size.
make sure that the port plate is changable.
the power supply may also have to be changed.
couple of post floating around on new builds, you may want to check them out.
their is more to swaping a m/b than most realize.
