Is there any software which would enable an AppleStyleWriter 2 to be used with the Mac X OS. I am presently using a MacBook Pro with OS Mac 10.6.8. Thanks in advance for any help/assistance with this question. Another 2013

Granted it was a stalwart little machine, back in 1994, but its day has come and gone unless it is connected to a machine running System 9 and below. For the price of a couple of ink cartridges, you could replace that with a new ink jet printer, complete with OS X drivers P

So connect it to a Linux machine and get it printing PDFs. Now on your apple, create PDFs and then print them using the Linux machine. Bob
