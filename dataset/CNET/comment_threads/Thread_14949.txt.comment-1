I have an ActionTec Router (56mbps USB) connected to my PC for my Internet connection.
Then I use a Cat5 cable from the router to my Mac in another room.
That gets me Internet and Network to the PC.
I can't seem to get the printer in the other room working from the Mac.
I have a Dell PC(OS- XP)and Mac G5 (OSX 3.9)
