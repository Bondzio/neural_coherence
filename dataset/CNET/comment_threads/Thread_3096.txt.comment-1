My PC's CD/DVD player has twice over the last couple of months made a noise like there's something loose inside the player when a CD or DVD is playing, and when I ejected it, a flat donut-shaped, gray foam/felt object that's exactly 1-3/8&quot; wide came out.
The 1st one looked like it had a lot of radial marks in it on one side, but the 2nd one was smooth on both sides.
The unit kept working after the 1st one came out, so I forgot about it, and now a couple of months later, the 2nd one has come out, but it's still working.
I have a 2002 Dell Dimension 4550 PC and the CD/DVD drive is a Memorex 16-X player.
Did these objects come from the player or did somebody put them there when I wasn't looking?
If they came from the player, is this a minor or major issue to leave them out, and if I need to put them back in, is there a link to a tutorial to guide me thru it?
