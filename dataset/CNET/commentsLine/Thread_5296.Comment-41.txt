hi jose, the hp pc you mentioned may not have a standalone graphic card which install into a express slot.integrated means built within mother board with graphic function allow you to do most of the jobs on display screen(lcd).
for playing complex game often you need individual graphic card e.g.
nvidia g force 9600.however to buy the hp won't hurt your future graphic card expansion providing a spare express slot built on the main board.once you insert a individual graphic card, connect display screen's cable to it and install software,you should be ready to play large games.
regards ching
