Now my CPU is shown as a single core 1.8 GHZ processor instead of dual core 1.8 (Task manager, system) Also, the tab for &quot;processor&quot; disappeared in device manager. Maybe it's a driver for the motherboard? I already installed everything and updated a few audio drivers, etc. And the box clearly reads: Supports Intel Core 2 Duo and Quad. Windows XP Professional P5G41-M LX2/GB Intel Core 2 Duo E4300 1.8GHZ (If you guys want graphics card or other info, ill provide that too)
