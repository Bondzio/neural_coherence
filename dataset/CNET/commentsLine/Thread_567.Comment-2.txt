or is there a better card that i should be looking at?
nvidia 7600gt.
the 512mb vram on the x1600pro doesn't make a difference in performance; it's just for marketing.
the 7600gt slaughters the x1600pro and the more expensive x1600xt.
you can get an evga 7600gt for $135 on newegg.
i am getting a 400 watt power supply what brand and model is that power supply?
and not afraid of spending some money how much are you willing to spend?
also, what's the rest of your computer specs?
