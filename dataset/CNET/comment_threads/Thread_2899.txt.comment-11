for that other stuff.
I had a big order [lots of small stuff] with cyber and had to call about a credit card question sending to a different address.
While checking to correct the problem the girl noticed the shipping cost and said &quot;we can do a lot better than that&quot; and reduced it substantially.
I appreciated that.
