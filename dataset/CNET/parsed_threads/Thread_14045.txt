<s> My company desktop is the wired computer and I have a Dlink wireless card in my personal computer along with a Dlink Router. </s>
<s> I use VPN access on the wired computer with a cable connection directly to the company computer and that works fine. </s>
<s> I want to run the wired connection thru my router but I do not have administrator priveleges on the company desktop. </s>
<s> Without Admin Priveleges, I cannot install the Dlink software on the company machine. </s>
<s> As far as setting up a wireless connection via the router and company computer, I guess there is nothing I can do? </s>
<s> You'll need to get your IT to help you here. </s>
