<s> Hi: I've done a search here, but can't find my problem. </s>
<s> I have purchased a second SATA hard drive from Dell. </s>
<s> The first one came in my 4-year-old Dell Dimension 8300. </s>
<s> I finally figured out, with help from someone here, that I need jumpers to designate one drive as master and the other slave. </s>
<s> In a chat with Dell, I was given a phone number to talk to the folks at Dell spare parts. </s>
<s> I can't repeat here what I said before I hung up on the &quot;tech,&quot; but he told me that Dell does not have jumpers for Dell's hard drives. </s>
<s> I need to be directed to an online or on-the-street store to purchase them. </s>
<s> It would be better if it were online or by telephone, because I live in rural Kentucky, gas is $4.50 a gallon and I lost my job recently. </s>
<s> In addition to telling me where to go -- people love to do that -- but exactly what to ask for. </s>
<s> Asking Dell for jumpers sent me to a guy that sells ribbon cable. </s>
<s> SATA drives, as you all know, don't have a ribbon cables. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I know someone here can and will help me. </s>
<s> KYB </s>
<s> To limit the SATA SPEED from 3 to 1.5Gb. </s>
<s> There is no master or slave in sata. </s>
<s> IF you find the new drive is showing as master then move the drive you want as master to the lowest numbered SATA connection first. </s>
<s> The &quot;tech&quot; in the chat gave me the web site: http://www.wdc.com/en/library/eide/2579-001037.pdf and I thought the info on the second and third pages show how to set up a master/slave arrangement. </s>
<s> I don't doubt your information. </s>
<s> You've been correct about almost all questions I've asked here. </s>
<s> (I can't say where you were wrong, but nobody's perfect.JOKE!) </s>
<s> I don't know anything about speed as it applies to the drives; I learned about the jumpers from someone here, I think. </s>
<s> Whatever, Dell says I need jumpers and said to come back to the chat, they would help me install them. </s>
<s> They told me to be very careful about installing them, and if I don't have to buy and install them, it's OK with me. </s>
<s> I can, and have switched the HD cables on the MB of this Dell Dimension 8300. </s>
<s> Are you suggesting all I need is to do that is make that switch and then install the OS, Windows XP HE, the necessary drivers and that will make the new, larger drive the master/boot drive and turn the original drive into the slave? </s>
<s> Since I don't need the jumpers, how do I make the new master drive the boot drive? </s>
<s> TIA KyB </s>
<s> One thing is not like the other. </s>
<s> So, to make the new drive the master/boot drive do I install the OS, Windows XP HE, the necessary drivers and that will make the new, larger drive the master/boot drive and turn the original drive into the slave? </s>
<s> Is there anything else I need to do to make the new master drive the boot drive? </s>
<s> Now I don't offer support or much for G4U COPYDISK since it's free and I type just 3 words to perform that copy the rest of us may have to use ACRONIS, software listed at http://www.duxcw.com/digest/Howto/hd/cpyhd/index.html or &quot;other.&quot; Sorry but I don't use much other than the first 2 I noted. </s>
<s> To set one as master I plug the sata cable into the lowest numbered sata connection. </s>
<s> One of the reasons I'm going thru all this is there is a problem with the Windows installation on the old drive, and I'm trying to set the new one up with a clean install of Windows, etc. </s>
<s> and then install the software I need on it. </s>
<s> There are some things on the old drive I'd like to keep, but that's for another time. </s>
<s> I'm just going to install the SW for which I have the original CDs. </s>
<s> KyB </s>
<s> http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim8300/sm/techov.htm Connect the new HDD to SATA_0 leave the old HDD disconnected until you get the new OS installed. </s>
<s> Let us know how it works. </s>

<s> I did a quick search of the page you suggested, but nowhere did I find any mention of SATA. </s>
