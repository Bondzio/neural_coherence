ok heres the situation... every time i go to rebuild my machine it fails out on copying files from any windows bootable cd...(windows xp, 2000, and longhorn_beta).
the point is the machine gets to copying system files and then goes bad either a single file or a blue screen.
i've swapped the hdd, and the cd's and i even took the hdd and cd and they installed fine on an older box i have.
please i need any suggestion on what to do now.. oh i have also reseated the memory ide cables and changed cd-rom drives.
the only thing i haven't done yet was reseat the cpu... i hate having to move those things.
the machine is also rather dusty.. i just want this thing to work... any help greatly welcome.
thanks, ray.
