1.1.1	I want to set up Xbox Live in my room.	St
1.1.2	I allready have a wireless network setup.	St
1.1.3	i wanted to know if I could bridge the internet connection from the wireless USB adaptor to the network card and then plug my Xbox into the network card.	St
1.2.1	I've never heard of such a setup.	St
1.2.2	All the working setups I've seen are internet to router and then some connection from the xbox to the router.	St
1.2.3	Anything else and it's up to you to sort it out.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Do you know if it is at all possible?	St
1.3.2	I was just wondering.	St
1.3.3	I will still be able to hook up to my wireless router if the bridge doesnt work.	St
1.4.1	I'm going to write no.	St
1.4.2	The parts and such you noted are interesting but why would I not use an accepted and working solution?	St
1.4.3	If you want to create a new setup, then go ahead but you will have to do it yourself since it is your creation.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
