<s> Hi My wife is starting to have problems with her pc. </s>
<s> The flatscreen goes blank and nothing seems to get it working again without shutting the machine down and restarting. </s>
<s> The screen is about 2/3 years od but the graphics card is older. </s>
<s> Is there a test to see if the graphics card is failing (it's a radeon)? </s>
<s> They put in another card and retest. </s>
<s> I know what you are asking but PC makers have been lax about issuing test or diagnostic software. </s>
<s> The reason is simple. </s>
<s> Such software is expensive and swapping a card is cheaper. </s>
<s> Your issue can be a failed fan on the graphics card or software but again there is no diagnostic software worthy of mention. </s>
<s> You'll find that shops across the globe will clean the heatsinks, replace fans and reload the OS. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks - Bit beyond my talents I think. </s>
<s> I'll need to ring around to get a price. </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick reply. </s>
<s> &gt; [shops] put in another card and retest. </s>
<s> That's how I tested for a bad video board. </s>
<s> Put in a cheap one. </s>
<s> Was indeed the board. </s>
<s> I am somewhat surprised at the claim that computers do not come with diagnostics, no PC I have ever bought did not have them, either with the machine of downloadable from the manufactures site. </s>
<s> Building diagnostic software is neither difficult nor expensive, especially since the cost is am amortized over thousands of items. </s>
<s> You could also swap the monitor if you have an old one. </s>
<s> PS In my other life, I amongst other things built diagnostic software. </s>
<s> You may need to update the drivers of either the video card, the monitor, or both. </s>
<s> The problem might be caused by one or both of the drivers being outdated rather than the video card going bad. </s>
<s> If nothing has changed then it is not a driver problem </s>
<s> If the screen is going blank and the computer has to be restarted to get a picture back , then it could mean that either the monitor's driver or the card's driver has bugs in it and needs to be updated to a newer version. </s>
<s> If the video card was bad then there would be no picture at all, even after the computer is restarted. </s>
<s> And there would be a POST beep during startup to indicate that the video card is failing (usually 1 long beep and 2 short beeps). </s>
<s> Or it might be that the monitor itself is not properly connected to the video card at the back of the computer. </s>
<s> That could also cause the screen to go blank. </s>
<s> Well, I've been to the card and screen manufacturers websites and I have the latest drivers. </s>
<s> I don't think either is overheating as they both have space around them. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Just like the shops do this. </s>
<s> Swap the video card out and re-test. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Bootup a LIVECD like Ubuntu or Damn Small Linus for a test. </s>
<s> The control panel of your video card (not the control panel of windows) should have a built-in option for stress testing your video card. </s>
<s> Since you use Radeon instead of Nvidia, I don't know if your video card's control panel has such an option, since I don't use Radeon cards. </s>
<s> You should check your monitor also to see if you have the latest driver for that. </s>
<s> And you should check your connection by unplugging the monitor from the computer and then replugging it again. </s>

<s> Not true. </s>
<s> My G Force 8800 Ultra took a week to finally go completely. </s>
<s> I was getting green and blue horizontal lines across my screen. </s>
<s> And couldn't play any games unless it would freeze and require a restart. </s>
<s> At the end (waiting for my new 9800 GTX to come) the VGA took over and I couldn't bring up my video card any more. </s>
<s> At that time I looked in my Device Manager and it had the yellow question mark next to my Video Card slot, so that cemented my assumption that it was my video card. </s>
<s> Probably yours too. </s>
<s> Video cards are cheap is you buy last years models. </s>
<s> (9000 series G Force 3000 series ATI $60-$100) </s>
<s> first thing to try is plugging in another monitor, 90% of all these types of problems are the monitor and/or cable. </s>
<s> If the fault clears treat yourself to a new monitor, otherwise try and locate a new graphics card, bearing in mind that if the pc is that old you may have to buy second hand (ebay) to get one that will fit the slot! </s>
<s> check how many separators there are when you look at the connections, this will tell you what type of AGP bus it uses. </s>
<s> Hi Thanks for the posts. </s>
<s> A new dimension has been added. </s>
<s> Yesterday the screen went a puce shade of green. </s>
<s> I have tried a different monitor but no problem was encountered so I went back to the flat screen. </s>
<s> It's difficult to know when the problem will happenas it seems quite random. </s>
