I'm looking to replace my 4 year-old PC, and saw that one that looks pretty good for everything I do, which is some Adobe work (mostly InDesign and PhotoShop), Net activities, and then some MMORPGing. I have no experience with Gateway computers, but my main concern would be upgradability chances in the future. Are Gateways upgradable? The comp specs are: Processor Class:

Honestly I'm in favor of building it yourself, Gateway has a reputation as being a good vendor, however you pay more to have someone else build it. The issue with minitower system is usually the use of a Micro-ATX mainboard, which can cause some upgrade issues (you have less I/O slots). Building it yourself gurantees the system's features to be exactly what you want. The second system you found is more or less identical, except for having a cheaper graphics card, and less memory. 3GB of RAM is honestly too much, 2GB is reasonable, anything more is overkill. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/How_To_Build_A_Computer http://computer.howstuffworks.com/build-a-computer.htm http://www.xoxide.com/buy-computer-power-supplies.html (yes, the power supply selection is important enough to get its own guide)
