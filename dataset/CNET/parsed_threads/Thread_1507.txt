<s> Hi, I just completed my first computer build as a major upgrade to my old Dell Dimension 8200. </s>
<s> With help from my buddy the parts were put together without any problem. </s>
<s> Our dilemma lies in the booting of the installed O/S. </s>
<s> We tried booting with XP Professional or Linux Ubuntu 10.10 but the hard drive is not able to fully start up either O/S. </s>
<s> XP gives us the Blue Screen, while Linux only gives the blinking cursor after the bios runs. </s>
<s> My friend believes there is something wrong with the hard drive. </s>
<s> After getting the Blue Screen he used a software to do a clean wipe of the drive which found many dirty/corrupted sectors. </s>
<s> If so I can get the drive replaced by NewEgg. </s>
<s> However, I wanted to know if any of you had other suggestions. </s>
<s> Please see my build specs below. </s>

<s> Actually, I'm not. </s>
<s> I thought the drivers could only be installed after the O/S starts up all the way. </s>
<s> I can download the drivers for the HD but I'm not sure if the PC will read them since they will be on a separate disk. </s>
<s> I can try it since its worth shot. </s>
<s> How are you adding SATA support to this old OS? </s>
<s> And another suggestion. </s>
<s> Let's not duplicate the old XP and SATA discussion ever again. </s>

<s> Page 28 tells you to set the BIOS for XP &quot;2.13.1 Installing Windows? </s>
<s> XP / XP 64-bit Without RAID Functions&quot; PAGE 2 of http://www.asrock.com/support/qa/TSDQA-44.pdf repeats this advice. </s>
