<s> I have had my HP computer for a while now and have decided it is undoubtedly time to upgrade. </s>
<s> I know I can't get much for a price range of strictly $500-$700, but can someone help me out? </s>
<s> I need to know what is the best computer I can get in terms of HD memory, RAM, Video, and basically just overall stats. </s>
<s> Thanks in Advance </s>
<s> A budget of ''strictly $500-$700.'' </s>
<s> Is that just for the computer box, or do you want that to include a new keyboard, mouse, monitor, and speakers? </s>
<s> Are you interested in building it yourself? </s>
<s> Well, I'm not exactly computer illiterate but I'm not up to the task of building one myself. </s>
<s> Of course I'd love it to come with a mouse, keyboard, etc but that's just asking too much. </s>
<s> I just want the best --computer-- I can get for my price range. </s>
<s> If you were happy with your HP, go to their site and you can build your own. </s>
<s> I had my wife's PC within 6 days of ordering, and that was 4 days before they anticipated shipping it. </s>
<s> They usually have a rebate and several free upgrades going on. </s>
<s> I got her a free HD and CD-RW drive upgrade by procrastinating a day or two. </s>
<s> Well, I do like HP but I know theer are some pretty sweet deals on the internet. </s>
<s> I've searched but I' m just reluctant to buy from seemingly unknown &quot;companies&quot; that's why I'm here. </s>
<s> I don't need my computer to be brand name...I just need it to have what I need. </s>
<s> Basically my question is, and this may depend on different opinions, what is the best all-around I can get for $700? </s>
<s> Thanks foir the suggestions though </s>
<s> Buy the components online, from newegg.com, and get a local shop or geek to put it together. </s>
<s> Yes, you'll have to pay them, but you'll get the best bang for your buck. </s>
<s> In order to determine what the best computer would be for your money, we have to know what types of things you do with your computer. </s>
<s> Are you a gamer, or like to edit photos or videos, or do you just run home office type apps? </s>
<s> A good local system builder could help you determine exactly what your needs are and design a system to meet your needs. </s>
<s> i.e., if you don't need high end graphics, and an on-board video chip would suffice, you could spend the extra money on memory, hard drive or faster CPU. </s>
<s> Spending extra on memory is better than pinching your budget on memory for a faster CPU. </s>
<s> Just a few thoughts, hope this helps. </s>
<s> Well I'm not a gamer but I play a few games like Knight of the Old Republic which thi computer no longer allows me to use. </s>
<s> I need memory because I'm a frequent downloader, although I do take care of my computer. </s>
<s> I wouldn't mind a better-than-average video card but not somehing top of the line. </s>
<s> I'd also like at least 512-1 GIG RAM since that seems to be the standard now. </s>
<s> Someone please help me in choosing a model. </s>
<s> I'll answer any other questions if you'll help me, I just don't know what to do. </s>

<s> thats a hell of a deal.. u'll want to add a better video card though as most onboard gpu's are junk and maybe a sweet monitor to go with it too. </s>
<s> good deal though </s>
<s> Oh god, sorry I meant 600 bucks. </s>
<s> I think it's still a good deal though. </s>
<s> I'm trying to get the best computer I can because i can just use this monitor. </s>
<s> My main interest is getting the best computer I can. </s>
<s> Can someone tell me where I can find out about getting video cards and can I install them my self? </s>
<s> Try this link. </s>
<s> Video cards are easy to install. </s>
<s> You'll need to buy a better power supply, though. </s>
<s> HP/Compaq puts the minimum in their pc's to keep costs down. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/ProductSort/Subcategory.asp?Subcategory=48 </s>
<s> At Costco.com these are the video cards I can choose from: Integrated ATI Radeon Xpress HyperMemory [included] NVIDIA GeForce 6200SE w/TurboCache 256MB support [add $62.00] 256MB DDR ATI Radeon X1300 Pro [add $153.00] The final price with the ATI Radeon Express which is the basic one is $610 so I need a not-too-cheap-but-okay-video card. </s>
<s> I know I seem to be asking a lot of questions but I really need a good computer so I don't blow all my money on this one and have to buy another in the near future. </s>
<s> Newegg.com simply has the best prices on computer components. </s>
<s> Here's a video card that's cheaper than the ATI and performs better. </s>
<s> You will also need a new power supply; the standard one doesn't provide enough power for a seperate video card. </s>
<s> The first link is the video card; the second one is the power supply. </s>
<s> A link takes you to another page. </s>
<s> To go to that other page, click on the link. </s>
<s> The link will be blue, and when you move your mouse so that the little cursor is on top of the link, the link will become underlined. </s>

<s> I need a few opinions because for this money I'd already be tight on shipping and I need to make sure all the above makes for a pretty good computer. </s>
<s> Hello there: Have you bought your computer yet? </s>
<s> Lee </s>
<s> No, not yet. </s>
<s> I'm waiting for some more opnions on the finished product to see wheher I get it or not. </s>
<s> The computer that you chose will be good, especially with the video card and power supply. </s>
<s> You'll be able to run multiple apps at once w/o slowdown, and it will play the latest games at medium settings with good frame rates. </s>
<s> Thanks everybody for helping me. </s>
<s> Now just to make the remaining $371 I need. </s>
<s> Sigh. </s>
<s> If you haven't pulled the trigger yet, Dell's got a nice sale that just started. </s>
<s> These deals sometimes disappear fast, so don't think too long. </s>

<s> For details, see here: http://www.techbargains.com/news_displayItem.cfm/59452 (I prefer AMD processors myself, but a 19in LCD thrown in at this price is hard to pass up!) </s>
<s> I just went to that and reconfigured the PC to my standards, which aren't THAT high, nad the final price was just $2 dollars or less off of the Compaq one. </s>
<s> And the Compaq price is already including a new video card and power supply. </s>
<s> I'm not going to buy it just yet though, there's no possible way. </s>
<s> Like I said before, I need 371 more dollars so there's plenty of time for something better to pop up. </s>
<s> Until then though, my sights will be set on the Compaq but please, keep suggesting people. </s>
<s> I'm afraid I may have failed to mention a few things I want on the computer: Floppy Drive CD/DVD Burner 1 GB RAM At least 100GB HD I don't care if it comes with a monitor or speakers. </s>
<s> In any case, I'll just buy one later when I have money, I mean, this monitor and speakers will still work. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions for a good computer like the Compaq I picked out? </s>
<s> I'm buying it today or tomorrow so this is my last chance to change my plans. </s>
<s> I'd also like some more opinions on my selections. </s>
<s> The computer's information is in the above posts. </s>
<s> ...It will be good. </s>
