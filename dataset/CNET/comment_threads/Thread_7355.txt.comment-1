I'm planning on purchasing a new desktop.
I've always had custom made pc's in the past (for gaming etc).
I'm now past that stage but I still want quality and speed.
I plan on basic cable internet surfing/photo and movie edits, multi task etc.
(no tv turner).
I probably will get a Dell or HP with Vista Home Premium.
My question...to avoid hour glass should I get 2 meg ram and forget about video card/ get 1 meg ram and a video card/ or go for it and get 2 meg ram and video card?
I'm not getting a new monitor but would like to stay in the $1,200 price range.
Any advice?
