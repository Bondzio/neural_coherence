1.2.2	Same IDE / Power plug etc. , but check your BIOS and Manual first to make sure it has an & quot ; Auto-Detect & quot ; hard drive option .	St
1.2.3	If it can & quot ; Auto-detect & quot ; , it 'll almost certainly be able to use any laptop drive , as these are standard across all makes and models .	St
1.2.4	Seagate 's Momentus ( one with Perpendicular Storage ) would be a good upgrade .	St
1.2.5	These offer better speeds , quicker accesses , lower votage use , and produce less heat than usual ( but cost more ! ) .	St
1.2.6	It might inject a bit of extra life into your Laptop .	St
