I had a cd with all my drivers and after a reformat I just had to click on to reinstall drivers I did that this time it installed 3 out of 5.
The 2 it missed were ' other pci bridge device and SM bus controller'.Is there a tool or something I can use to find these 2 drivers thats not to complicated.
