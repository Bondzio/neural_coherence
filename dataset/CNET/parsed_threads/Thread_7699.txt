<s> I have Intel Core2Duo E4500,2.2ghz,2gb RAM,Intel 945 chipset & running Windows..The problem is that my cpu makes noise continuously when i run a big application process,when my cpu usage is more...the sound is irritating..my system is clean from threats..can anyone suggest me some idea? </s>
<s> Since you said it's when you run &quot;big&quot; applications, about all I can think of is heat which can cause fans to run faster or alarms on motherboards to trigger. </s>
<s> The first thing generally advised is a cleaning of all fans...especially the heatsink/fan assy. </s>
<s> thanks Steven for the suggestion..i will try out what u said. </s>
<s> I cleaned all my fans & it worked..my pc is running smooth now. </s>
