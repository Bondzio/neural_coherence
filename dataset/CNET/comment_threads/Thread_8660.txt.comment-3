Your building your own,so your not stupid,and you believe in yourself...that's all i need to know.You've read the specs on each part to insure compatibility.
I looked up what i'd get on a $394 budget: -MSI MB w/o video.Has 4 RAM slots,and two PCI-X 16x slots.
$49 -AMD Phenom 3-Core 3.0GHz CPU..crap,out of stock for good.
$70 -Rosewill Green 700WT power supply w/crossfire .
$79 -1GB video card (might grab two) $68 ea -Seagate Barracuda 7200rpm 1000GB H.D.
$69 -G.SKILL Ripjaws 4GB DDR3 1600mhz RAM (2 sticks for now) $59 Using my old hardware & operating system,4-bay case,burner,and roms.
[NOT buying a 6-core CPU,too much $] $394 COMPLETE.
