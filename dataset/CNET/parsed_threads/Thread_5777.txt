<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I have this Pentium 266 MHz Compaq Armada with 64 megabytes running Windows 2000 SP4 and I have some 802.11B card that works fine in it. </s>

<s> Hardware is probably not the limiting factor, it's the operating system - which may in its own way impose the hardware minimums. </s>
<s> A PII desktop system with an open PCI slot running Win98SE should be able to support the drivers that a WiFi card needs. </s>
<s> A USB 1.1 port would work too. </s>
<s> For a laptop of that vintage, it would need a USB 1.1 port, but you'd have to determine the exact specs of the PCMCIA/PC-Card slot to be sure the new adapter card is compatible. </s>
