is there a life expectancy on hard drives?
yes, there is, but i can't tell you what it is (it varies).
it is not based on calendar time but on &quot;power on hours&quot;, at least usually.
it's fairly long (the numbers i have seen have ranged from 50,000 to as much as 300,000; note that if the drive was left on 24x7x365, a full year is a bit over 8,000 hours).
also, drives have a system in them called &quot;s.m.a.r.t.&quot;, which is &quot;self monitoring and reporting technology&quot; or something like that, generally, in so far as &quot;natural&quot; death is concerned (not death caused by a sudden event like a physical shock), the drive will usually know when it's going to fail and is capable of giving warning if asked.
the problems with this are that smart does not always work unless the drive is connected natively (directly via ide or sata; not by usb or firewire) and many systems are not setup to &quot;ask&quot; the drive about it's health (for drives connected natively, most bios' have an option to do this each time the system boots; amazingly, the default, however, is often to disable this capability).
in particular, drives connected by usb or firewire (in other words most external drives) probably never get asked.
on the bright side: i'd probably rather trust your &quot;old faithful&quot; drives, even if they are 5 years old, than a brand new drive that i had just received from a vendor.
the death rate for drives in the first 30 days (some would say in the 1st 6 months) is frighteningly high.
last comment: an external drive should be a backup, not a primary drive.
and, further, you should always have multiple copies of anything that is important.
if these rules are followed, it would be difficult to lose data due to the loss of a single drive (and, in particular, a single external drive).
you should have another copy somewhere.
