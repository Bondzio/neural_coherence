<s> A friend has a Dell desktop system running Windows XP. </s>
<s> The system is several years old. </s>
<s> They have been having resizing issues for a while where the screen just switches to a huge font and no way to go back without a reboot. </s>
<s> Recently, when booting, they started getting the message &quot;Input signal out of range&quot;. </s>
<s> Does anyone have an idea as to what is going on and what it will take to repair? </s>
<s> If you select a video mode that is out of range, then you see that. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> I boot to safe mode and set it to 800x600 and 60 Hz. </s>
<s> Save that and reboot. </s>
