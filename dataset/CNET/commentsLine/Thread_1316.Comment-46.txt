i started with a weak gaming system back in 2002, since then i have added another system, graphix cards capable of dual view functionality (this function allows you to drag the media player window and drop it onto the tv, and click to expand it to movie size), sound cards and internet cards to inprove motherboard capabilities.
why do it?
: basically wiring your pc into your stero amp and tv will help you reduce the costs of buying new technologies.
you need a dvd burner for your computer?, might as well save the cost of buying a stand alone dvd player and just get a cable for 10$ to patch your pc's ability along to your tv and stereo amp(and don't buy cables at radeo shack/circute city or future shop: they like to inflate cable prices up to 1000%) be careful!
: first, some tv's might not have feedback sheilding, so your computer might get electric feedback from an older tv causing your pc to crash or malfunction, so always unplug the feed from the tv after watching movies.
second, if you're using a standard stereo amp and you have a quadriphonic or 5.1 speaker port set-up, keep in mind that this is not the set-up you should configure on your pc.
the feed to your stero should be configured for a headset so that both l/r channels are combined, otherwise you will only get a right side speaker sound, this is because standard computer speakers are connected in serial, so they only need one channel, not 2. ok. the benifits are extreme.
i can pound the walls with mp3s operating with crisp digital perfection at levels unattainable by high-end pc speaker systems, also helps if you build your speakers with crossover terminals too, you'll feel like you're in the recording studio!
