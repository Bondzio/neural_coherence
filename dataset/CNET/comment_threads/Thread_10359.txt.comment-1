Your help / advice is sought.
I have a Sony 50&quot; LCD WEGA HD-TV with a HDMI jack that I would like to use as a computer monitor.
I am not in need of the functionality of a Windows Media PC.
Windows XP Pro will work fine.
My main interest/goal is to be able to use a PC, probably a desktop, as a gateway to my home network with an emphasis on displaying the browser and crusing the Internet.
Any suggestions or directions where I can find a confirmation of a solid PC configuration and any tweaks I need to be aware of or plan for?
Thanks!
JHH
