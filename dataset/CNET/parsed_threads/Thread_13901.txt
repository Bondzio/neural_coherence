<s> The corrupted PC hard drive has been replaced. </s>
<s> The manufacturer will not honor the warranty unless I return it to them. </s>
<s> How do I erase the contents to protect my identity? </s>
<s> The old hard drive is in a box waiting for return to manufacturer. </s>
<s> It is NOT in the computer. </s>
<s> May mean you have to keep the drive and pay for the replacement. </s>
<s> I will mention an app but be sure that if you use it, you never have a drive attached that you can't lose the contents of. </s>
<s> DBAN is the app. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> DBAN says the hard drive must be IN THE COMPUTER, to clean it out. </s>
<s> Tech replaced it with a new hard drive. </s>
<s> The corrupted hard drive is NOT in the computer. </s>
<s> To use DBAN we would have to connect it to any computer to wipe the contents. </s>
<s> Again, this is the price of protection. </s>
<s> Maye the good old hammer to the dead drive is best? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Having to pay for a new hard drive just to keep my computer information away from Dell, hardly seems reasonable. </s>
<s> Trust is a lost commodity in 2010? </s>
<s> YES! </s>
<s> Dell did not earn my trust, respect or confidence. </s>
<s> You got a replacement HD already and installed. </s>
<s> Now, you don't want to return the old HD back because you deem the data too personal. </s>
<s> While that maybe true, how can you blame Dell for that? </s>
<s> They await the return of the HD in order for &quot;YOU&quot; to honor the warranty process. </s>
<s> It has already suggested to use a HD wiping pgm. </s>
<s> in order to remove any data. </s>
<s> If you can't do this, again how is it Dell's fault. </s>
<s> That's up to you to decide to proceed with the eraser process and then return the HD. </s>
<s> You will need to mount the HD in such a way to access your old system or another. </s>
<s> The current replacement HD can be unplugged and plug the old one back in, in order to wipe it clean. </s>
<s> It doesn't have to be screwed or physically mounted as before but have access to the HD port to proceed. </s>
<s> Any other way will be a cost factor involved. </s>
<s> If your computer savvy enough to accomplish this, its a done deal, excluding a truly damaged HD that can't power-ON or similar. </s>
<s> Otherwise keep the HD and face whatever action Dell may deem necessary. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> You are absolutely correct! </s>
<s> My anger came from Dell sending me the wrong Norton TWICE. </s>
<s> The first one was recognized by Tech #2 as an outdated 3.0 model. </s>
<s> She ordered the current 4.0, but both were for 5 person use in a business instead of one computer home use. </s>
<s> Then the rep.added PC tune-up, remotely, which I don't want. </s>
<s> Then they charged me for shipping and handling--it wasn't shipped! </s>
<s> It was installed remotely. </s>
<s> Add to that the fact that they charged taxes on shipping and handling on everything and they promised to call me within 24 hrs. </s>
<s> and credit my VISA within 48 hrs.--didn't happen. </s>
<s> Oh yes, I added all the time I spent on the phone with them in a span of 5 days = 23 1/2+ hrs. </s>
<s> with about 7 different Tech people. </s>
<s> That's not efficient or effective service from reps from India who were difficult to understand. </s>
<s> I frustrated them by asking for a repeat at various times of what was being said. </s>
<s> AFTER the local installation tech started to walk out the door with the corrupted hard drive, I was notified that I &quot;should have&quot; erased it. </s>
<s> Or I can take it to someone locally to have it erased. </s>
<s> Non return of corrupted hard drive, as determined by their Techs, means I pay for it and I keep it. </s>
<s> They can charge anything they want for this process, as evidenced by............... </s>
<s> The first rep. said it would cost me $365 for a years worth of service on software problems. </s>
<s> The 2nd rep. quoted $190 for 5 major calls and unlimited minor calls, so I accepted that offer. </s>
<s> They put a charge of $239 on my VISA. </s>
<s> The third rep. said I really should buy a warranty and quoted me $301 for the solutions services that I had already agreed to purchase for $190. </s>
<s> Too many price changes tell me it's fraud. </s>
<s> Finally, they were to send via e-mail, a label to return the two incorrect Nortons---nothing was ever mailed or emailed. </s>
<s> These are the things that are Dell's fault! </s>
<s> I sent an email telling them to e-mail the UPS label for the Nortons, credit my VISA within 48 hours for the Nortons and the PC Tune-up. </s>
<s> No reply to date and the charges are still on my VISA. </s>
<s> I will dispute the charges with VISA. </s>
<s> And finally, I've spent hours adding back programs and personalizing the computer and now it's freezing and disconnecting from the internet. </s>
<s> Services performed by others. </s>
<s> You see the same prices on services performed at an automotive repair shop. </s>
<s> EXAMPLE: A pair of brake pads at Pep Boys is 9.99 (see http://blackfriday.gottadeal.com/black-friday-3466-ProStopBrakePadsSet.html ) To have them installed is no less than 20 times that in most cases. </s>
<s> Back to your hard drive. </s>
<s> This is a CHEAP PART. </s>
<s> Under 100 bucks at many stores (see newegg.com for example.) </s>
<s> But if we don't do this ourselves then the automotive example works well here. </s>
<s> If we don't do it ourselves then we get to pay for it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Its plain now you have too many issues with your Dell system that you weren't mentioned with your 1st post here. </s>
<s> I can only offer in such circumstances to start a log and note all your instances with service, etc. </s>
<s> and keep any paperwork. </s>
<s> This you can turn over and/or start a process in a legal matter. </s>
<s> In towns/cities you can have an ombudsman or local DA that takes on such matters and goes after the said company. </s>
<s> However, this usually never in a timely matter but its NOT forgotten and you may get relief at a later date. </s>
<s> Alas, any tech is not a source to say &quot;this or that&quot; as that's usually 2nd hand info and can be misleading. </s>
<s> In other words, take it with a grain of salt. </s>
<s> Though, I'm a tech or engineer if you will I find it best not to feed any animosity in light it could come back to haunt me. </s>
<s> But, never the less if you feed warranted, the above advice could service you well. </s>
<s> As for charges and all that, that seems correct though it appears at times having been applied doesn't mean you couldn't get a &quot;return&quot;, so its up to you if you feel action is needed. </s>
<s> I don't think as a tech issue I can provide more than what was stated in earlier posts. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> &quot;I've spent hours adding back programs and personalizing the computer and now it's freezing and disconnecting from the internet.&quot; OUCH. </s>
<s> When I read this I thought &quot;ouch.&quot; This means that what you are doing after they fixed your machine has created new issues. </s>
<s> That is, they may have fixed the machine and whatever you are doing to the machine looks to create new troubles. </s>
<s> The next time you chat with those that support you, ask what they think of the programs you are installing. </s>
<s> For example: One owner installed TORRENT software and every single time their internet connection would start dropping. </s>
<s> There's a lesson there. </s>
