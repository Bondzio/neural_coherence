i don't do any overclocking on my cpu so there's no need for water cooling.
water cooling may enable a higher overclock but the cpu might not last as long due to the overclocking stress.
plus i'd worry if the water pump all of a sudden decided to fail, and my cpu in its overclocked state stopped receiving a steady stream of cool water
