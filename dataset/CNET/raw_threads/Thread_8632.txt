15162	0	286124	2719007	NR	Andokuky	3/1/08 8:40 AM	1.2043608E12	Building a new PC	Being income tax season and all, I decided when I get mine back any day now, I'm going to use some of it to build a new PC. Right now I have a prehistoric VIA computer that runs at 700MHz and can barely do anything without bogging down. I don't want a top of the line PC that will cost over a grand and allow me to play Crysis with max settings or anything, but something good enough to watch movies and play newer games at medium settings would be great. Here's what I have so far: CPU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103211 AMD Athlon 64 x2 5000+ = $100 Mobo: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138081 BIOSTAR TF560 = $70 (after rebate) Memory: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820211188 A-DATA 4GB DDR2 800 = $80 DVD/CD Drive: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827151153 Samsung = $30 HDD: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148261 Seagate Barracuda 250GB = $67 Total thus far: $357 So assuming all of this is good and all, I still need a competent video card, a good monitor and maybe a new power supply? I have speakers/keyboard/mouse and operating system covered.

Your new machine might be in need of a decent, well ventilated case where the 700MHz unit has been known to work in an enclosed box. Bob

I should have worded by original post better, what I meant was maybe I'd need to buy a new PSU to replace the one that would come with my new case? Like for instance, I was looking at this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811129155 It comes with a 450W power supply, would that be good enough? That case only has one fan, but the processor I am buying comes with a fan and heatsink, and the video card I buy will probably have one as well, would it stay cool enough in there?

All too often its minimal output, in fact buy a better psu to handle your current needs and possible future demands. If you follow the posts here, psus are a common failure. They are the bedrock of a decent system and shouldn't be taken for granted. They often are and poof at some later date, they become an issue. You may want to reviews past posts on the topic, just use the forum search engine. tada -----Willy

The most attractive option i found for the money was from Apevia, they have options of colors (red, blue, and green) but i got a blue one and it looks great. PSU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817148028 Case: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811144211 Together they come out to around $200, but its money well spent, there are cheaper options if you shop around you might be able to cut it down to around $150
