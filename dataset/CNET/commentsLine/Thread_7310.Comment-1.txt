i purchased a wireless g network card for my laptop to use on my vacation.
then i got the bright idea to get a wireless card for my desktop, just to see if i could get the laptop to talk to the desktop.
but after reading the info that came with the pci card it seems i can not do that.
i did not try it yet and figure i would ask if it will work before i try it.
now i have no wireless access point or router or anything on that line just 2 computers with wireless cards.
all i want to do is make sure the card in the laptop will work while i am away.
thanks gene
