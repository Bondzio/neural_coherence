If the budget permits...I'd replace now while you're doing the GPU. Re replacement options...I wouldn't consider either of those you've listed. I would however recommend something with a better warranty, longer MTBF, better buyer ratings, greater efficiency (uses less electricity), better tech site reviews like the one below. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139004 Hope this helps.

Manufacturer Response:Dear Valued Customer, We apologize for the inconvenience. The power supply is in total 500W. Power supplies have multiple rails because computers need multiple rails or types of power to run. For the 12V rail, it dedicates 360W, for the 3.3V and 5V it dedicates 165W, for the -12v 6W and for the +5VSB 12.5W when all added together equals 500w. The spec sheet is available via the link below. Your video card requires two six pin pci express connectors which the power supply provides. Should the power supply be faulty, you can rma the power supply via the link below. Respectfully, CMUSA - Customer Support. External Link(s): PSU Spec| RMA|&quot;

Nonetheless I wouldn't buy the CM RS-500 for a PC unless it was used strictly as a bench spare. Accordingly I couldn't recommend one for use in a gaming system for someone asking recommendation here. Looking at the GPU specs for the Sapphire HD5770, it clearly states 400W as a min PSU .. another HD5770 shows 500W as min. The combined wattage of that PSU is only 430W despite the fact it advertises as a 500W. Even the Corsair 450W PSU beats it in 12V wattage, efficiency warranty,12V AMPS (33 vs 30), review ratings and buyer ratings. http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/?psn=000101&pid=296 http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/?psn=000101&pid=305 But buyer reviews/comments for the CM RS500 reflect DOAs, short use deaths ... there isn't much subjective about those events. For what it's worth, I'm not recommending BMWs but products I've read reviews about, I've read buyer ratings on and ultimately products by mfgs I personally own . . . Corsair, Seasonic and Antec PSUs. VAPCMD
