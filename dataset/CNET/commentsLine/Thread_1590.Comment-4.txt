i have dsl with the modem hooked up to the first pc.
i have added a new pc (both are xpsp2) in an office in another building(same phone line).
i would like to connect to the internet on the new pc and was told by isp to use a router.
i bought a linksys etherfast cable/dsl routher with 4-port switch, but cannot get connected.
the phone line works, but as soon as i connect the phone cord from the filter that houses both phone and dsl, into the router, no phone and no connection.
when i manually set the ip address on the new pc it says connected but ie says not connected when i try different websites.
any help would be so much appreciated!
