<s> Why must they put pci-e x1 and x4 slots on motherboards? </s>
<s> What can they be used for in the first place? </s>
<s> What can you put in them? </s>
<s> For personal computers, mostly they are for future use. </s>
<s> Off the top of my head: X1 = video cards; network adapters; HDD/RAID controllers; USB, Firewire and Serial cards. </s>
<s> X4, X8 = HDD/RAID controllers. </s>
<s> I just Googled for PCI Express sound cards and TV tuners and came up with a few hits. </s>
<s> Hmm...I didn't know about those! </s>
<s> 2 years from now, regular pci slots will be vestigal since all new components will use the pci-e slot. </s>
<s> x16 is only needed for high-bandwidth components (like videocards). </s>
<s> x4 and x1 are intended for stuff like disk controllers, low-end video cards, co-processors (such as a physics card), etc. </s>
<s> Would it make sense to purchase a video card for pci express x1 or just get a pci graphics card. </s>
<s> My mobo has neither AGP or pci express x16. </s>
