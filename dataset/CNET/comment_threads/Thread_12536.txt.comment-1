2002 HP Media Center PC.
Upgraded to XP SP2 in Nov. Don't know if related, but no tv signal in media center.
All other feature in media center are fine.
System actually reboots when I click around.
MS/HP sites give no information.
When XP SP2 upgraded, color changed from green color scheme to blue.
Some additional features now show up.
But, w/out TV - no record feature & thats primary reason for purchase.
Advice?
Heard of this?
Could something else be the cause?
Thanks
