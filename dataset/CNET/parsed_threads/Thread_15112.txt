<s> Just when I thought I had this issue figured out (thought it was an overheating problem) it comes back to haunt me. </s>
<s> Computer: Gigabyte MB, P4 3.0Ghz, 1x 512MB PC3200 DDR, 128 MB Radeon 9600 graphics card, 400 Watt Pwr Sply With a cold machine, from start-up, the system goes through the bios configuration checks, and begins loading the O/S from the HD, it then simply shuts off! </s>
<s> Sometimes when it is running, the system would just freeze, and I have to do a hard restart to turn it off, and then the shorting-out ensues. </s>
<s> There are no error beeps when the system is turned on, I checked the MB battery (just checking everything) it was fine, the system is not overheating I've kept the case open and even blew a house fan into it (system temps were mild also), as far as I can see, the MB does not have direct contact with the case that would cause a short. </s>
<s> I am COMPLETEY STUMPED! </s>
<s> I don't know if I have a faulty processor, power supply, DDR, MB! </s>
<s> Faulty case (buttons/connectors)? </s>
<s> ANY HELP IS MUCH APPRECIATED. </s>
<s> Have you tried another bigger power supply? </s>
<s> They tend to fib about that Watt number. </s>
<s> Why not make this a warranty issue? </s>
<s> The machine is very new. </s>

<s> I built the machine myself, I would make it a warrenty issue, but I need to know which component is causing me stress, then go to that manufacturer. </s>
<s> My greatest suspect is the power supply, so I'll replace that first, if not the issue, onto the MB, if not the issue, onto the.... </s>
<s> I mean, I'm up to suggestions on how to trouble-shoot it before I completely re-build it. </s>
<s> The first one is about picking a wattage size. </s>
<s> The second reveals that too many units &quot;fib&quot; about the number. </s>
<s> Lesson? </s>
<s> Just get the big one. </s>

<s> You can try reducing the load. </s>
<s> Are there more than one hard disk? </s>
<s> Can you unplug the CD/DVD drives? </s>
<s> What else can go? </s>
<s> And the non-negotiable item. </s>
<s> Latest BIOS. </s>
<s> Some won't do this either because they think a new board would have the latest (ring the Jeopardy buzzer please...) or they are afraid. </s>
<s> In closing, without spare parts, there is no certain way to find the dead/undersized or such part. </s>
<s> The PC design isn't including diagnostics. </s>
