The pads are there to provide a uniform contact surface between the HSF and CPU.
You do not want to use a CPU without them.
I would not assemble an Athlon based machine without heat compound or the tape, its CPU suicide without it.
Try reducing the number of parts down to Power supply/HSF/CPU(with compound)/onboard speaker.
See if you get a beep.
In addition you might want to take the board out of the box and try it on a peice of cardboard, you might be shorting out somewhere.
