1.1.1	So, in my pursuit to make myself a &quot;rig&quot;, I've been looking for a way to get 64 bit Windows 7 Home Premium for a cheaper price than $200.	St
1.1.2	That is when I came across OEM software.	St
1.1.3	On Newegg currently, I can preorder Windows 7 Home Premium OEM for $100 less than retail.	St
1.1.4	Now, this sounds good and fine and all, but I was under the impression that OEM usually has a catch, like getting another piece of hard/software with it.	St
1.1.5	But this has no apparent &quot;chain&quot; that comes along with it... could someone clear this up for me?	St
1.2.1	so I have locked this and the other PC Hardware post, to prevent duplication and confusion.	St
1.2.2	http://forums.cnet.com/5208-19411_102-0.html?threadID=362563 Mark	St
