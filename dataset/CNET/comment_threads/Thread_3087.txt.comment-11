A great way to selectively synchronize your files across two or more machines is Allway Sync: http://www.allwaysync.com I need regular access to certain files from both machines, and I won't always be connected to the network with my laptop.
This free utility has been a real boon.
There are various automation features, but I just have a couple of separate jobs I created that I manually initiate at the end of the day.
Not only does it ensure that the files are in sync, but you have the added benefit of an automatic backup onto another machine.
