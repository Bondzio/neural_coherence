i have a toshiba satellite m65-s809 laptop.
it has the double laywer dvd writer, for whatever it means, i don't really know.
haha.
i just put in a maxell dvd+r rw, dvd in the slot, and i thought that i can just drag the files, and they will be copied to the new dvd.
however, the computer tells that it is inaccessible?
how come?
did i buy the wrong dvd?
thanks.
