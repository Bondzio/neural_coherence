The data was put on with a Mac. I am trying to access it with a PC. In Device Manager, I can see the drive. In Disk Management, I can see the drive but it has no letter assigned. When I write click the only options available are Delete Partition and Help. It will not let me Change Drive Letter and Paths. If I try to use the diskpart utility from command prompt, I can see the drive with list disk and list partition but not with list volume. If I try to use the add or create volume simple commands I get a message that says &quot;The command you selected is not available with this version of Windows.&quot; My computer is: Windows Home XP + SP2 AMD Athalon 1500+, 512 MB RAM, ASUS A8V266-E Motherboard USB 1.0 It is six years old. Any ideas?

It has a free trial for a week but its pay after that. The free trial is plenty for me but does anyone know a freeware program that does the same job? Thanks.
