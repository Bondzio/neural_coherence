read your posts.
it's unclear what is an &quot;error message&quot; and what is your writing.
beyond that, programs since about windows 95 don't move or operate if you move the drive over.
1. it's proper for the program to outright fail.
2. you do want to copy the data files over from the old drive and use those with the program you install on the new drive and os.
hope this helps you understand the underlying issue.
