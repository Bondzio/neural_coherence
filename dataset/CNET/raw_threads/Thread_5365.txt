I am looking at an Nvidia NVS 280 AGP card. Want to make sure that it would work, or if there are things that I need to look at. Thank you.

That card is not too heavy on the power requirements and the typical dual display card I've used in the past. I have not used this specific model but some of the predecessors of that card. Remember that like all things PC no one can issue a warranty it will work but it should be fine. Bob
