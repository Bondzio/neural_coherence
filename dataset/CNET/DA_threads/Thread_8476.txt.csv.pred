1.1.1	Hi if someone could help me i would gratly apprecite it.	St
1.1.2	Ive just bought a see thru case for my pc and need a cooler for my 2.7ghz celeron skt 478 cpu.	St
1.1.3	I bought a coolermaster DP-102 but it doesnt fit both fans due to the layout of my mobo, have tried it with 1 fan and my cpu runs at 65-75 degrees c (is this too hot ?).	St
1.1.4	I want to get this a lot cooler without using water cooling.	St
1.1.5	The heatsink also has to be attractive as i've spent a lot of money buying a see thru case, uv lighting, see thru psu, uv reative cables etc.	St
1.1.6	If you have any sugestions i would gratly appreciate this.	Polite
1.1.7	Thanks Paul	Polite
1.2.1	make sure the heatsink is mounted properly and the thermal pad/grease is applied properly.	Sug
1.2.2	i can't find any info on the coolermaster dp-102.	Ques
1.2.3	it's not on their site nor on newegg.	St
1.2.4	but this zalman unit will definitely keep your cpu under 60C and look cool doing it.	St
1.2.5	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835118118	St
1.3.1	Reset my heatsink today and added an extra 60mm fan so now it has an 8cm and a 6cm fan and now it seems to have done the trick.	St
1.3.2	It's now running at 42C.	St
1.3.3	Dont know if it should be cooler than that or if that is ok. Heres a link to the arocool dp-102 website http://www.aerocool.us/p-cooler/dp-102/dp102.htm Thanks Ramarc for your help it was greatly appreciated Thanks Paul	St
1.4.1	This is problem with some of the unique cpu cooling fans now.	St
1.4.2	You really got the check the specs or dimensions of the cpu HSF in order to be able to use it.	St
1.4.3	Yeah, you're in the upper limit of the careful temp control.	St
1.4.4	I suggest you get another one that &quot;fits&quot; the bill.	St
1.4.5	Sorry, but you learn the hard way, get another HSF.	St
1.4.6	Otherwise, you'll pay the price of a replacement cpu and that's not cheap.	St
1.4.7	tada -----Willy	St
