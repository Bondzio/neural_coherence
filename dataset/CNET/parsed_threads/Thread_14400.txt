<s> Hallo, I have another question. </s>
<s> I have just put together a PC with an AMD 2800+Athlon processor, an Abit NF7-S2 motherboard, a GeForce MX 4000 Display Card,512 MB Crucial PC 3200 RAM. </s>
<s> When I switch on the power, the CPU and Case fans start up, the led lights come on but the computer doesn't boot. </s>
<s> The monitor shows a &quot;no signal&quot; message. </s>
<s> I have cleared the cmos several times, taken out the battery and replaced it after about twenty minutes and I have insulated the motherboard from the case so I know it's not grounding. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas. </s>
<s> Thanks, Bert </s>
<s> If so, have you disabled it in the BIOS??? </s>
<s> And, of course, the mobo uses both the 4 pin and 20 [or 24 ] pin power connector and they are both connected. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply, Ray. </s>
<s> No, the motherboard doesn't have on board video and the 4 pin and 20 pin connectors from the power supply are plugged into the motherboard.Thanks, Bert </s>
<s> Here is a link with good info about pc consturction it may help to review what you have done. </s>
<s> A MB is suppose to be grounded to that case, BUT only where the standoffs for the mounting screws go. </s>
<s> Try a min post. </s>
<s> MB,PSU, 1 stick of memory, CPU/heatsink/fan,video card,keyboard and speaker. </s>
