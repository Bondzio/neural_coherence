1.1.1	Hi , I 'm posting this question from the subject that I just read about , that is taking a drive from your old PC & using it in the new one ( as a backup or to transfer files , etc . ) .	St
1.1.2	Here 's my situation : I completely rebuilt my PC , that is to say I have the & quot ; old & quot ; one now as a backup , up & running , with WinXP Pro installed , everything just the way it was , completely functional ... working Seagate IDE 80GB HDD .	St
1.1.3	In my newly built PC , I have an Asus A7V880 Mobo/AthlonXP 3000+ chip , 1GB RAM , Samsung SATA 80GB HDD , WinXP Pro , all updates , etc .	St
1.1.4	I had some music on the & quot ; old & quot ; HDD that I wanted to transfer to the new one .	St
1.1.5	I could network everything , but that 's not the problem .	St
1.1.6	The problem is that when I put the & quot ; old & quot ; IDE drive in the new PC , no matter where I put it on either IDE cable ( Primary/Secondary MS/SL/CS ) , Disk Management sees it & gives me properties , but it does n't show up as a drive in & quot ; My Computer & quot ; .	St
1.1.7	Keep in mind that it works perfectly fine in the & quot ; old & quot ; PC , & the new PC sees it , but I ca n't access it .	St
1.1.8	I can find no information on problems with SATA/IDE drives in the same machine , so I am at a loss as to the nature of my problem .	St
1.1.9	Again , this is n't insurmountable , as I can network the PCs together to transfer the data , but I ca n't figure out why the 2 drives wo n't play together .	St
1.1.10	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks in advance ... Robert	St
1.2.1	I 'm sorry I do n't have an answer for you , as I am looking for one as well .	St
1.2.2	I have to ask though , do you have Norton GoBack installed on the drive you are moving around ?	Ques
1.2.3	On mine , the partitions appear to be somehow hidden by this program when I moved it to the new computer .	St
1.3.1	I 've taken HD out of one computer put them in another , and had no problem .	St
1.3.2	The one time I did have a problem I had to run Sysprep with the reseal option .	St
