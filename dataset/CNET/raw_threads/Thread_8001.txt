TV/Radio/Cellular/Cordless phones and the other thousands of transmitters wouldn't disappear overnight. If you're still worried, move the AP at least a meter away from you, the power level at 1 meter drops by a power of 10,000.

When you pass a full power AM broadcast station you are being exposed to 50,000 watts. Many amateur radio hobbyist radiate 1000 watts. Shipboard environments exceed 1,000,000 pulsed watts. All decrease at 1/(R x R)[R = the distance from the router], so the further away you are from the antenna (R) the lower the RF intensity. I haven't included the increase in intensity antennas can create. The belief that a wireless router's radiation is dangerous is unfounded and entirely false.

I don't thing so..--- even TV remote control and electrical outlet, have some effect on you. Aside from those 'unfounded and entirely false(?)' thing, Your body can reduce the signal strenght.. By the way, unfounded means Not found yet... doesn't mean None. If I have to choose... I choose further away from the device.

We live on a planet orbiting a star system in a galaxy where everywhere there is background radiation. That radiation is in all spectrums, including X-Rays, beta rays, and gamma rays, all of which are deadly if lethal doses are absorbed by living tissue. Even if there was zero technology on this little planet, we would be surrounded by this radiation. So, the real question is &quot;Does the radiation from my wifi router significantly increase the radiation from the Sun and the galaxy?&quot;. The answer is not just &quot;No&quot;, but &quot;Hell no&quot;.
12110	7	158657	1766057	1765588	Watzman	2/23/06 5:50 AM	1.1406738E12	Not 1 watt	The output of a wifi card or access point is generally a couple hundred milliwatts, which is no where near 1-watt. [Also, 50,000 watts is the maximum for a broadcast radio station (most are 5,000 to 20,000 watts, very few are 50,000) and 1,000 is also the maximum for an amateur radio station, most are more like 200 watts on HF or 1 to 20 watts UHF). But the point, really, is that an access point or wifi card is considered to be safely low powered and is also at a reasonable distance. Consider a cell phone, which has similar power outputs (a few hundred milliwatts ... a few tenths of a watt). Most are operated less than 2 inches from your head. In my view, regulations and scientific findings not withstanding, that is cause for concern for people who use a cell phone hours and hours per day. But at 3 feet, the exposure to a wifi WAP of the same power is less than one 200th of the exposure from the cell phone at two inches, just due to the distance. And if that number becomes 5 feet, it's one 900th. So distance is your friend here, the power output is low, but once you are even a few feet away, it's the distance, coupled with the low power, that keeps your actual exposure very low. I'd be much more worried about the cell phone that is on your belt holster constantly and 2&quot; from your brain when in use. [Cell phones are transmitting and emitting radiation even when they are not in use, although not continuously].

While the increase in technology on our little floating orb is increasing the radiation exposure of us all, the background radiation is much more intense. Granted, we are adding to the rads we pick up, you are going to die from something!

Then you also have to worry about things like arsenic and bacteria in your untreated water source.

The technical comment about the distance from the router is what makes the point that a router is not a dangerous thing. Anyone that uses a cell phone on a regular basis has far more to worry about than a wireless router or cordless phone. I don't think I would sleep with it under my pillow though.

There are a couple companies, like BioPro and Advanced Tachyon Tech, which sell small round disks that are affixed to the outside of the phone. I have both on my cell phone, as a hedge. Microwave radiation like that from an microwave oven (aka ''radar'' oven) oven are banned in some countries. WRT to radiation coming in from the galaxy, I would think that part of the evolutionary process would've tweaked us to survive while bathed in some kinds of ''natural'' radiation. BTW, we here in the US get corporate science not real science. Real science still openly exists in some countries where politicians listen to their science advisors. Bottom line: cell phones and micros are not as harmless as we're told they are. Some people get the bluetooth headset which works with bluetooth enabled cell phones. This allows you to keep that antenna on the cell phone a few feet away from your head. Also if you must use a microwave oven, always keep some distance between it and yourself, at least six feet. If its door becomes warped, junk it.

This is enough - even at a distance - to interfere with low-power communications in the same frequency range, e.g. Wi-Fi @ ~2.4Ghz, Bluetooth in the same range possibly, cordless phones in that range... AFAIK, Wi-Fi operates at anywhere from ~20 milliwatts (mW) at minimum, to the 100 mW legal maximum... to the questionable (but people use them anyway, hehe ) 500mW amplifiers. I don't know the specs on Bluetooth. Cordless phones generally operate at 100mW or so, except for those which use spread-spectrum, which can run at 1 watt (1000mW). I doubt even 1 full watt is going to do any harm, esp. for the 90 seconds you're cooking your Hungry Hombre Heat'n'Eat Entree. But... the intensity diminishes the further you are from the microwave, so... Don't like the so-called &quot;risk?&quot; Stay back from the door! The guy who said you should trash a microwave with a damaged door though is right. The above stats apply only to new equipment. If the seals are damaged... you can get a lot more radiation coming out, even to the point where it can start to burn you (in the worst cases).

I have a Linksys WRT54G, with third-party firmware that lets me boost the power output somewhat. I also have high-gain antennae hooked to it. A foot away is a dual-cassete deck with a turntable (yes, it's old. I use it to dub my folks' old stuff to CD for them). It's hooked up to the sound card of the computer underneath it (the deck and router are on a hutch). If I switch the deck to tape mode and listen... you can hear little pings and pulses, several every second in bursts. At first, I thought this was being introduced through cables, but then I realized that it only happens in tape mode, and not phono mode. Also, if I disable the router's radio, it stops. Conclusion: That noise - presumably the beacon signal from the router - is being picked up magnetically, rather than electrically. By the tape deck heads.

They order: cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's Disease and accident (in that order). Alzheimer's victims usually die of pneumonia, a lung condition or a cerebrovascular condition -- so Alzheimer's victims are often declared to die of other causes. Watch out for motorcycles and cars -- very dangerous!

The limit is actually based on your EIRP, which is the transmitter and antenna combination. 4W (36dBm) is the limit for non-point-to-point communication. An example of 200mW (23dBm) card attached to a 15dBi omni antenna after losing a couple dB in cabling and connectors sits you right at the limit. 23 - 2 + 15 = 36.

The range on these units is roughly 30 meters so it has to be a neighbour on either side. Since the problem persisted when the landlord neighbour to the west had no tenants in their house, it only could have come from The East house. I have a wireless 2.4Ghz audio stereo transceiver. The noise problem went from small initially to very large shortly after. Thus showing a disposition of purposeful annoyance; by using the noise generated on my stereo (outside) to find the best results, from the position of their router, upon my equipment. The machine gun sound became louder than the source music. I liked to play classical in my backyard garden!

I install the big drums on radio towers you see driving down the road. Site to site data transfer line of site up to 50 miles. I also install hawking 500ma boosters on routers to extend range by 6 x in home installs Any thing more than a half watt 500ma needs a fcc license to buy. Just think your microwave oven works off 600 to 1200 watts power at 2.4 GHz and can cook food in a minute or two. One time when I was installed my first two watt WIFI amp on a 14 story roof I was putting Up a 25DB gain antenna dish and my co worker hade the amp on and I tasted metal in my mouth at first then got dizzy and almost fell off the roof. Stay away from any amped source over 1GHZ. at 1-? watts The IEEE states Anything over 1 GHZ is microwave energy 1 watt 2.4ghz 3-6 feet bad headache!!!

Usually when I'm done using it, I turn it off, but more recently I've been spending most of the day on the internet. My own general malaise, I've attributed to other causes but it is when my two cats began showing symptoms of illness, that I took notice. Within this year, my cats began showing symptoms of asthma. I've spent so much money on naturopathic products hoping to bring their system into balance. They already have an organic diet. The visit to the vet cost several hundred dollars with tests and solution offered? The steroidal treatment. Just the other day, they were coughing and gagging for breath all of the earlier part of the day. Then, I turned everything off to go out to run some errands. Strangely, when I returned, they were both perky and happier. Yesterday, I had my wireless turned off, leaving only the wired desktop. So far, I'm seeing significant changes in their behavior. One of my cats hadn't had any attack since then; the other one is definitely improving. And oddly, I feel better too. I don't feel as run down. I think this is serious stuff.

Nonionizing radiation was once thought to be harmless. However, the science that suggests nonionizing radiation to be harmless is null and void, and completely outdated (not to mention a complete lie [we've known for years of its negative health implications]). With the power of seemingly endless amounts of information at our very fingertips, it surprises me that more people are not aware of the facts on this matter (but then again, I'm not surprised). All one must do is simply type in &quot;cell phone dangers&quot;, &quot;radio waves&quot;, &quot;microwave radiation&quot; or the like to find out plenty of information on the subject. In doing so it would surprise me if one did not run across a credible site that delves deeply into the subject matter of harmful radio/microwaves. To make the reader's life easier I will post some pieces of info (titles/phrases to search for [copy and paste what's in the quotes]) to get them on their way: &quot;How Radio Works&quot;, &quot;Genetic Effects of Nonionizing Electromagnetic Fields Dr. Henry Lai&quot;, &quot;Nerve cell damages in mammalian brain due to microwaves icems&quot; (there's plenty of info). Even the World Health Organization (WHO [whom I really don't trust]) has recently made notice of the health implications of radio waves (cell phones, WIRELESS ROUTERS...) by classifying cell phones as possibly carcinogenic. The tech industry has done itself a great justice, with a great millions of dollars, in deceiving millions of people on the problems associated with radio waves. Why would these people tell you that their products are harmful? Would you buy their products if they told you they were harmful?--absolutely not and they know it. Don't be another subject to this ongoing Milgram Experiment of Life by believing what everyone of &quot;authority&quot; says on any subject matter. Always research something before you decide to believe in it.

Obviously because of the money losses that will be involved, in the case of people knowing the dangers, from these devises. as an ex, appliance engineer myself I say to people a mobile phone is practically like using a microwave, would you put your head in a microwave, even on the lowest setting even put it on to defrost with your head in, the answer will be NO because you know of its outcome, ( apart from not closing The door wouldn't work the microwave in the first place), of course this is hypothetical but still in the same league, I find that a mobile phone I cannot hold to my head for more than about two or three minutes and then I have to swap ears, but if I use a phone now I used a phone on the loud speaker whilst not holding it, lay it'on the side of where you are sat and talked whilst keeping a distance of at least 10in. this will help limit the indirect emission levels, headphones also can give you a low grade Emi from the speakers, Some of you will remember yuppie flu, well this is part of the scenario, whereas electromagnetic forces working against us with health issues, back in the eighties and engineer I was training was from a tank core in the army, he had to leave his post and I believe He had bought himself out of the army, he did tell me the problems he had in the tanks with the other electronics equipment there, at that time I was working as an appliance engineer, my time on computers were limited then, but I did believe what my engineered told me of his own accord, I think we need to think seriously about what we're projecting onto our children in the sense of mobile phones Wi-Fi and electronics a like, you, I will put my name up against these devices, specially been used in our schools colleges and the like, we are starting to get knowledge of these things existing we must act now, five years ago I was devising a glove that could protect your hand from these emissions, the idea was good but I believe the electromagnetic emissions coming from keyboard, mouse, and screens, in many have emissions too. We have to understand the consequences and act now, I can see in years to come many problems and I believe that there will be damages awarded to people for using these devices, The same way as the scare of asbestosis and its implications.how People perhaps disregarded it consequences at the time, but everyone is sitting up and listening now, I do hope that what I have written will make people sit up and listen and protect our children and ourselves from any possible future mutations,
