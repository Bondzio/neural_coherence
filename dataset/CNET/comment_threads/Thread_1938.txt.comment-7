I can boot up fine using the integrated card, just not the external one.
I guess it must be the card then.
I was thinking that maybe changing the resolution could affect the splash screen.
If not, then I definitely destroyed the card.
I did mess with the card when it stopped working, and I do have a network card which partially obstructs the airflow from the card's fan.
I probably screwed it up.
Crud.
