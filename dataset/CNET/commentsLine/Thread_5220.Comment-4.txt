i don't know too much about what your software needs, so i apologize if i'm wrong.
you're going to need 1 gb of memory, 2gb would help.
you probably could use a quadro ro firegl card with at least 128mb memory.
however, those cards are somewhat pricy, so stick to what you can afford.
i would also get a dual-core cpu, like the athlon 64 x2.
monitor size depends on what you view, more is better so whatever you can get is good.
unlike a computer system, you can keep using a monitor for years so i'd put more money into the monitor size, at least 19&quot;.
