Bob I guess more information is needed, tried a wired connection, originally I had my cable modem/wireless on the main floor next to by Blue Ray Player.
Purchased a 50ft Cat5E cable so my son can play xbox in the basement...It did not work, I moved the modem down to the basement plugged in a shorter cable and the xbox worked, so it had to be the cable, if I do that again with the blue ray player I am afraid the same thing will happen even though I know 50ft is well within the specifications of CAT5e.
Plus I don't really want to run a cable that long (kind of a pain) if you know what I mean
