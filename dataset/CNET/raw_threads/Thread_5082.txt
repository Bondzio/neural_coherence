Then I have a Gateway Desktop running Windows XP Pro and a Toshiba Laptop running Windows Vista Home Premium connected to the Linksys router. I just recently bought the new Linksys router that I'm using now, before with my previous Linksys router I had no problems accessing the shared files on my desktop from my laptop, but now the only way I can access them is when my laptop is connected to the network wirelessly. If I plug in the laptop directly to the router I can no longer access those files. Keep in mind I'm fairly new to networking issues so you might have to hold my hand through this. Thanks.
