try removing some devices to see if the problem clears up (as the power draw decreases).
Disconnect the CD and floppy and see if it goes through a clean boot?
If yes add the devices back in one at a time until it fails.
If it always fails with the new video in, you probably need to look elsewhere.
Check file dates past last good configuration to see what else besides the drivers changed.
