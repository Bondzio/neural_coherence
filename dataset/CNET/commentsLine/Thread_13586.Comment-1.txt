i have just purchased an external floppy drive for my desktop(vista), when i try to view a floppy disk that whas created on my laptop(xp) it tells me that the floppy needs formatting, of course this will delete all information on the floppy, when i did try to format on the desktop after a few seconds it tells me that windows was unable to format, i need access to the information on the floppy, does anybody know what the problem is and how to fix it, regards
