I have a Dell Dimension 3100 and I bought world of warcraft.
The graphics were buggy and the system kept crashing so i bought a graphics card off ebay - nvidia geforce fx5700.
However it needed an agp expansion slot and when i opened up my computer it only had 2 pci slots.
Can i insert a card into one of these and if so which one should i buy.
Thanks.
