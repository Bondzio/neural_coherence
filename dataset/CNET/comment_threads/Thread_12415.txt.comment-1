just recently my mate built me a computer and it has 2 hard drives a C drive and E drive.
the problem is that the C drive only has 4gb while the E drive has 600gb.
I dont know alot about computers so im worried about playing aorund with it 2 much without help but windows etc is stored on the c drive and it is always at low disk space.
How can i get windows to load and install programs on the E drive so there is plently of room.
Is there any advantages to the way it is set up now.
Thanks for your help.
