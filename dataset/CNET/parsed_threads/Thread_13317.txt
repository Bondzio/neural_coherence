<s> Now that Windows Vista is here, I've been hearing about some compatibility issues. </s>
<s> Anyway, I'm just wondering if keyboards designed for XP tend to have any problems in Vista. </s>
<s> Standard kybds. </s>
<s> shouldn't cause a problem. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, if you have a kybd. </s>
<s> that uses a driver or special setup pgm. </s>
<s> then expect a bleak future. </s>
<s> Thus, it *may* need some Vista driver release or patch. </s>
<s> Then again, if this is a common kybd. </s>
<s> it should be ok. </s>
<s> Overall, I haven't seen any issues, but as you noted, &quot;some compatibility issues&quot; can crop-up on a new OS release. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
