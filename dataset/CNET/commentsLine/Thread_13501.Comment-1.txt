hey, i had got a meritline rist watch sometime around march'05 with 256mb of data storage on its inbuilt usb drive.
i've formatted it with a secure (password-protected) partition and a non-password-protected partition.
it had been working fine since yesterday.
i was transferring some files from the watch to my pc, deleting those files from the watch, adding files to the secure partition...suddenly, when i tried to delete or copy anything on the watch, it showed the message that &quot;the disk is write-protected.
remove the write protection or use another disk.&quot; i can still copy data from the watch to my pc, but cannot modify the contents on the watch.
for the reason of being write-protected, i'm not even able to format the usb drive.
please help!!
!
