1.1.3	http : //i40.tinypic.com/vnh1uf.jpg I believe : cable modem - & gt ; firewall - & gt ; switch If my server is connected to the switch , it can still let me RDP to upstairs thin client from upstairs computer , right ?	Ques
1.2.1	of the Ethernet ports on the LAN side of your router .	St
1.2.2	Connect the switch to an available port on the router .	St
1.2.3	You router is already a firewall to the WAN side .	St
1.2.4	If you wanted an additional one , you 'd connect it from the router to the switch and all devices you wanted the additional firewall protection for would connect to the switch and not a router port .	St
1.2.5	Anything that currently works on your LAN now wo n't be affected by adding a switch moving devices from the router ports to it .	St
