sometimes the shadowing problem can be attributed to a faulty video connection between the pc and monitor.
try these simple things first.
reseat the video cable at both ends first, and make sure they are securely fastened.
if the cable is poorly shielded, you may have to separate the cable from other nearby power cords in order to isolate interference problems.
if the above actions do not fix your problem, then try swapping the cables between monitors.
