Cnet says to take a damp cloth and gently wipe it on your LCD. I did what they suggested, and it worked fine. Make sure you don't spray too much water.

There was this ad I saw about some sort of tough plastic to protect your LCD. It comes in a variety of sizes like 17inchs, and 19inchs, and is supposed to make text on LCDs look clearer. It is so tough that you can actually use your LCD as a cutting board! I saw an ad for this in PC magazine. I'll try to find it and post back.

I believe this is the product I am talking about. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824999207 For some reason Newegg only has a 19inch size. The ad I saw for this product had other sellers(Newegg one of them). I'll try to find the magazine to check for the other sellers.

I understand that that would probably be the best way to keep the screen clean but it's just too expensive.
2831	7	148473	1659238	1658537	UndisputedChampion	1/9/06 3:36 PM	1.13682096E12	Yeah it is.	With performance comes price. I won't be using my LCD as a cutting board so I won't need it. My LCD does get dirty, but a wipe with a damp cloth cleans it just fine. Good luck.

Taped it on up top. I wouldn't recommend this for everyone, since it is home brewed, but it is an option. I did it after a pair of round-nosed school scissors dinged my laptop's LCD; it keeps people from playing &quot;darts&quot; with my LCD monitor.

You spray, wipe, buff, and all the fingerprints, dust, and beveage splashes disappear. 20 bucks for 150 ml, but you use it [quite] sparingly for best results.

I later found out that they use polymers which do more harm than good. The Shaggymac Optimist Prime lcd spray is the best laptop lcd cleaner I have used. When used with their microfiber it cannot be beat. Even with my Sony glossy Xbrite screen, it leaves it perfectly clean. Also the Shaggymac laptop screen protector pads are awesome...a must have! http://www.shaggymac.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=2&products_id=73

Spray on cloth and wipe on any off monitor. I use it on my TV too. This system is the goods. JV.
