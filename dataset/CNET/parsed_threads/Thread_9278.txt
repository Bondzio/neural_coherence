<s> I'm getting a budget video card, and I heard that Geforce 6800 is the best for my price range, 160-180. </s>
<s> I have a aGP slot. </s>
<s> Which one of these is better? </s>
<s> Is there something else that is better than these for the price? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> The 6600 GT is way more powerful than the 6800 vanilla.... </s>
<s> Here's a good price for it.... http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1642902&CatId=1560 Hope you can get this one... My friend got one and now he can play any game at any settings with jaw-dropping results!!! </s>
<s> Good Luck, and peace out!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> due to the 4 extra pipelines and 256 bit memory interface... versus the 6600gts 8 pixelp ipelines and only 128bit memory interface the extra money for the 6800 is worth it. </s>
<s> and has more reviews...i would go for the evga one. </s>
<s> but both evga and xfx are great brands. </s>
<s> Since the 6800 is slightly better than the 6600GT because it has 4 more pixel pipelines, it makes sense to get the 6800. </s>
<s> But just the original 6800 won't give you awesome gaming performance, unless you overclock it like I do, which will definetly give you a extra boost in frame rates.... </s>
<s> I have there products and because the EVGA card has a D-sub connector. </s>
<s> Wouldn't have to use the adapter to hook up to an analog monitor. </s>
<s> One small thing I wouldn't need to remember to bring with me when I go somewhere. </s>
<s> Never purchased any XFX stuff, yet. </s>
<s> I will, though, eventually. </s>
<s> Check this out: http://firingsquad.com/hardware/geforce_6800_unlocking/ You can unlock 4 extra pipelines and make the 6800 into a 6800GT, this only works for the AGP cards. </s>
<s> Next step is to overclock with coolbits: http://www.iamnotageek.com/a/39-p1.php Do these two things and you'll have a rocking card at a low price. </s>
<s> Buy the lowest priced 6800 card, none of them stray very far, if at all, from the nVidia reference design. </s>
<s> Please don't be mad at me if you nuke your registry, or mess up your system, extreme caution should be taken when modifiying any software or system files! </s>
<s> dont. </s>
<s> i wouldnt unlock though as i remember reading something how it decreases memory speed or something, </s>
