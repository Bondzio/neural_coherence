She has it set up and says it looks pretty good. However she has been advised by a co-worker to download a driver. One did NOT come with the monitor and apparently wasn't supposed to. She did download a driver and saved it to her desktop. No matter what she does, she can't install it and Wizard is telling her it can't find it. Anyone familiar with this problem? We would greatly appreciate any help you can give us. Her operating system is WINXP. Thanks, Val

When she's on her home page, it is too small. I think that could be corrected. We were able to download a driver but can't install it or open it. There are five icons and none of them seem to be for installation. I'm thoroughly confused by this. Thanks for getting back to me. Val

What you said was what I thought but this guy (in the know)that my daughter works with, thought differently. I've got one of these monitors coming to me and I'm glad to have the problem solved. Thanks a bunch. Val
