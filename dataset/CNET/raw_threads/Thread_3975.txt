You can use an external display as your main workspace or to extend your desktop, or you can work in mirrored mode with a projector so you can view what your audience sees. Use the Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter to connect an advanced digital monitor, such as the 20- or 23-inch Apple Cinema Display, that includes a DVI connector. Review the documentation or check with the manufacturer of your monitor to make sure you're choosing the right adapter. The new CinemaView displays will be available in 19, 20.1 and 24-inch sizes, with display resolutions of 1440 x 900 pixels, 1680 x 1050 and 1920 x 1080 respectively. Each of them complements Apple's industrial design cues -- they feature aluminum stands, black bezels and glass fronts. Thanks and Regards, Rodger Hooks Switched PDU
