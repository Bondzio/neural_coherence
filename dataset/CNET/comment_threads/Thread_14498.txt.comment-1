I have just finished assembling my computer.
When I connect the power supply to an outlet, the motherboard's power light is on, but when I press the &quot;ON&quot; button through my case, nothing happens!
It seems I plugged everything in correctly, but nothing besides the motherboard is turning on!
ASUS A8N-E AMD 64 4000+ Antec P180 Case Antec TruePower 2.0 PSU 7800GT This is my first computer build.
Thank you for your help!
