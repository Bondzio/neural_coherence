The drive has already been partitioned and has around 40gb of data stored on it. My PC went in for a repair and a blanket copy had to be made and reinstalled. The only main difference to the PC was that they installed XP SP2 I'm not sure if this is related to the upgrade but the external hard drive does not apper in &quot;my computer&quot; anymore. After reading others posts I've checked the device manager and the drive does not appear in their either my C drive show up as being the basic drive. The only dives that are displayed are... C - Internal harddrive E - Internal CD drive D - Internal DVD drive G - External DVD drive The External drive used to be &quot;H&quot; but it doesnt appear now. The drive did not come with a driver as its plug and play and worked fine when I first installed it this way. The USB icon appears in my tray when I connect it and states that the device is working properly. When I click on the USB icon in the tray to stop a device, and then on &quot;mass storage device&quot; in the pop up window, it displays the drive there &quot;eg maxtor 6 USB device, so the pc must recognise it. can anyone help please, I'm at my wits end...

Thanks for your quick reply Bob I downloaded TWEAKUI from... http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx I ran it selected drives the external hard drive is not on the list, it used to be drive H. See screenshot:- http://xs28.xs.to/pics/05190/TweakUI.JPG The dive appears in the device manager see screenshot - http://xs28.xs.to/pics/05190/DeviceManager.JPG but does not appear in the disk management see screenshot - http://xs28.xs.to/pics/05190/DiskManagement.JPG Any ideas?

That is, shutdown and remove all power from all devices and power bricks for a 10 count and try again? How about plugging that into another USB port? Some discover some ports will not work, but report &quot;OK&quot;. Bob
862	4	103929	1190286	1190198	jamhay	5/15/05 1:00 PM	1.116162E12	I've Shutdown & Restarted....	Ok Bob, I completely shutdown and unplugged everything then booted back up. The external hard drive still doesn't appear in 'my computer' I have an external DVD drive that shows up, so I swapped the plugs, connecting the external HD to that USB port. Like the other port, again the PC responds when I connect it,& the 'safely remove icon' appeares in the system tray. When you click on the 'safely remove icon', it asks if you want to stop the external hard drive so the USB port must be working. view screenshot - http://xs404.xs.to/pics/05190/stopusbdevice.JPG It does say &quot;location 0&quot; would that have something to do with it?

862	6	103929	1190547	1190359	jamhay	5/15/05 4:31 PM	1.11617466E12	Is this problem unique?	The drive is only 3 months old, although it does have 90/120GB stored on it. It seems more of a PC problem than a hard drive problem it would be a shame to format it only to find out the PC still wont read it. From the info and the screenshots I've given previously would anyone be able to point me in the right direction of a driver download? I think reinstalling the driver may work?? its worth a try. Bob, is this problem unique to problems you've help with before? It just seems like theres something silly I'm missing out somewhere.........????
862	7	103929	1190692	1190547	R. Proffitt	5/15/05 6:47 PM	1.11618282E12	Here's the deal. You can't format it since...	It doesn't show in the disk management tool. The problem is not unique. Such devices fail all the time. Again, such a device is not &quot;backup.&quot; Don't entrust what you can't lose to a hard disk. AND... a test is needed on another PC to call out where the issue is. I know where my bet is. Bob

I had an external drive that suddenly lost connection and wasn't recognized by My Computer or the Disk Management. I purchased a new external case, took out the hard drive and connected it to the new case, and voila! Instant recognition, and my 100G of data was still there and safe. I have a question for Bob, if you're still following this! Bob, how DO you suggest to backup if you say that hard drives are a bad idea? I have had just as many problems with DVDs that &quot;fail&quot; and suddenly lose data. I have followed discussions about this as well, data that people thought were on their DVDs &quot;forever&quot; and suddenly all is lost, or the drive won't read the DVD, etc. Is there a REAL backup solution?
862	11	103929	1199495	1199448	R. Proffitt	5/20/05 6:42 AM	1.11657132E12	Bob's backup.	I have many levels of backup. Sadly it does take time to do this so I fit it inbetween and as part of my PC usage. 1. CDRW/DVDRW disks contain a set of what I need to move to a new machine. NO OS or applications are needed since I have the install CDs plus those have a copy. A total of 3 sets are rotated and as some media fails, it gets replaced. This is cheap compared to just a few years ago. 2. Next in line is an USB hard disk. Nice for quick backups that I don't want or need to refresh that DVDRW set (I used to use CDRW, but DVDRW is just so many less disks.) 3. A smaller set of files is sent off to my mini-server that is running OpenSSH or a secure shell server. This contains my core works that I can't lose and photos. 4. Further down the list are my set of OS CDs, applications CDs. All the originals and CDKEYS are in a package far away from the computers. A copy of these are in my recovery kit. I use my recovery kit first and if one of these CDRs fail, I can go get the original to duplicate it again and refresh the recovery. This happened once so the system works. 5. The take it with me plan. I recently acquired an 1 GB USB memory key. On it are the items that I don't want to lose if I was away from home and the home vanished. While I can't carry my photos there, key works and such are on it. Some may consider this extreme but they may not have suffered a total wipeout yet. Or watched others lose it all. Bob

It was being recognized only intermittently which was making me crazy. Some days XP saw it, some days no. Removing the USB connector from the USB hub, and then putting it into a new different port on the hub did not help the computer recognize the external USB drive. But disconnecting the external drive from its power supply, and then disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable at the external drive (with the computer on) led to XP SP2 seeing it and assigning a drive letter in Explorer. I dont remember if I reconnected the power supply or the USB cable at the external drive first, but it was nice to see it back in action.

It's a small lesson, but so far the lesson seems to be repeating too often. And yes, it should work but after dozens of failures why should I try to fix an apparent industry issue? Bob

I have the same problem with my external HD, and after reading through this thread I've not seen a solution so far. My external HD is recognised and listed in My Computer intermitently and rarely seems to work long enough to transfer a file of more than a few Mb's. It does work on a PowerBook/OS X so I figure the External HD Enclosure or the HDD is not at fault (though the sound the HD makes sometimes when it's not working you'd think it was knackered). If it's SP2 that's got issues, does anyone know of a patch or something to fix this? Thanks.

Since USB 2.0 on a good machine with proper drivers and XP SP2 is dead stable, what fix would be needed? You will find some dead drives or USB external cases, but since swapping the drive or case fixes it, how can you pin the blame on Windows? If firewire, then all I can write is you didn't take the advice. Bob

Just trying to find some conclusion to this thread and I think you made it! I'll check my drivers - not that it should need them. Failing that I'll get another IDE cable and put the HD in my computer! Thanks.

Given what we know about that machine it could be USB 1.1 or missing drivers that Microsoft doesn't supply. Your post and details about the machine are too light. I'll write it won't and shouldn't work. Bob
862	22	103929	1648896	1612477	Smoker	1/5/06 1:50 PM	1.136469E12	Acknowledged Problem by MS	I have this common bug too. Long story, it says the drive letters get mixed up with what is mapped and what is temporary trying to squeeze in so it isn't seen most of the time. Go to disk management (removeable drive, or somewhere) and reassign a drive letter to your external drive that you aren't going to be using regularly. That's reasonable enough, except you can't do it when your drive doesn't show up there. Thanks Microsoft.

To back up files-recover there is a great program I used to back up my maxtor 300gb with the same problem, it is not free but it is worth the money, it will cost you around $50.00, you can only use it on one computer so after you install it make a disk back up, reinstalling it again it will not work(they are smart), nevertheless they have a great customer service on the phone!! Go to www.quetek.com, buy it ( file scavenger) and in hours you will back you whole drive before you format it, I used it twice alredy and did not loose any files. After you install it you will be able to see your drive from within the program and copy it to another location, 150GB took the program around 7 hours. Maxtors are pron to this, to avopid this make sure that you go to computer management/disk management/then go down the second window where you will see the rectangular boxes withthe disc leters and names, rigth click on the disk you want to check, go to properties/policies and make sura that the box that say enable write caching on the disk is not checked. Maxtor external dont work well on this if there is a power failure at any point even if you dont notice it. I hope this helps!!! NV

I have somewhat of the same approach, but do not use any &quot;plastic&quot; media, only hard drives. Have 2x250 GB drives inside PC case for quick and dirty backups (no mirroring but use SyncToy to backup everything that is important - inclusing all written down &quot;keys&quot; in Excel sheets). Will soon add another 300GB drive and make these 2x250 drives as a RAID I. All this data is mirrored about once a week onto my wife's computer, in a different room, where it lands onto her D-drive (2nd disk). Outside of this, we have 2x80 GB USB drives that are stored in the basement and one 120GB hard drive that is stored at the bank in a safe deposit box. About once every month, that drive is taken home to be &quot;re-freshed&quot;. Is this anal? Possibly so, but I did have a hard drive crash (on a laptop) in 2004 and after that I rather go a bit too far since storage today is cheap. Microsoft's SyncToy is also a pretty handy and fast tool for setting up small backup routines. And, it's free!

In most cases the problem is in MBR (Master Boot Record) created in your drive's MBR sector by OS you had before upgrade or patch with service pack etc. So, basically what we need to do to get our HDD back to life is to write the MBR signature (the Hex Word 0xAA55) to your drive's MBR sector. It is easy to do. 1. Download this utiility: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download 2. UNzip it somewhere on your computer then find and run &quot;testdisk_win.exe&quot; Here is what you will see on your screen when running Test disk: ------- TestDisk 6.2-WIP, Data Recovery Utility, November 2005 Christophe GRENIER &lt;grenier@cgsecurity.org&gt; http://www.cgsecurity.org Select a media (use Arrow keys, then press ENTER): Disk /dev/hdc - 708 MB / 675 MiB Disk /dev/sda - 120 GB / 111 GiB Disk /dev/sdb - 120 GB / 111 GiB ( in the liness above you will see YOUR hard drives), so select the one which you have problem with, then press &quot;ENTER&quot;) [Proceed ] [ Quit ] ---------------------------------------------------- Next step is to select the partition table type You will see on your screen something like: --------------------------------------------- Disk /dev/sda - 120 GB / 111 GiB Please select the partition table type, press ENTER when done. [ Intel ] Intel/PC partition [ Mac ] Apple partition map [ None ] Non partioned media [ Sun ] Sun Solaris partition [ XBox ] XBox partition --------------------------------------------- So, select [ Intel ] and press enter Next screen: --------------------------------------------- Disk /dev/sda - 120 GB / 111 GiB [ Analyze ] Analyze current partition structure and search for lost partitions [ Advanced ] Filesystem utils [ Geometry ] Change disk geometry [ Options ] modify options [ MBR code ] ...... --------------------------------------------- You need to Select &quot;Analyze&quot; then press enter New screen will appear with something like: --------------------------------------------- Disk /dev/sda - 120 GB / 111 GiB Current partition structure: ------------------------- 1 * FAT32 blah blah blah............ --------------------------------------------- You don`t need to change anything , Just press ENTER New screen appear which will look almost the same, the only difference that on the bottom you will find result of the disk structure test. If your disk is not damaged ( in most cases it is will not be find as damaged. it is just misconfigured) so just press &quot;ENTER&quot; to proceed to the last step. NOTE: If your drive found as damaged you can recover it using the same utility ( how to do this? see docs on authors site) Now we are almost done! After you pressed &quot;Enter&quot; in previous step you will see something like: --------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------- Disk /dev/sda - 120 GB / 111 GiB 1 * FAT32 0 10 blah blah bla....... --------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------- And on the bottom: [ Quite ] [Search] {Write] -------------------------- We need to select [ WRITE] option.

By simply changing the external drive letters ... both partitions became visible and accessible under Explorer. Not sure why this happened because I used the external successfully just a few days before (and many times before that) to copy data from/to it...but changing the drive letters fixed it and permitted copying data to it VAPCMD

Well I was having the same problems as most of you have had and had a somewhat interesting break through without a reasonable explanation. I was using a Seagate 120Gb hard drive in my external drive and was getting the same system responce as the first guy. I tried every thing except reformatting. (Its a used drive off of a Dish Dvr player) I had no idea what to do. So I tried another drive off of a different computer. And bingo, it started right up! The only question that I have is with the Seagate. Do you think that the reason that it is not running is that it needs to reformatted?

I do not think this is the case. There are many solutions to different problems that may occur with a External Hard Drive, both used through FireWire and USB alike. One of the problems may be an issue my mom had occur to her hard drive. Currently I am having issues with my own hard drive, I found this and eventually remembered this. My mother was having trouble with her Maxtor 200gb External One Touch II Hard Drive in order to fix the problem a tech support member instructed her to uninstall Dot .NET framework 2.0 as it interferes with many hard drive devices, this fixed the problem for my mother. Hope this helps, I'm going to attempt it right now... This only occurs on my computer which has Windows SP2 & Dot NET 2.0 framework.

862	46	103929	1987042	1189903	THEDEVO	6/7/06 3:23 AM	1.14965058E12	ANother Solution	Hi all, I had this same problem and here is my solution that worked for me, and maybe others? 1.) First is the order in which the drive is connected. Connect the power to the drive, then the USB cable to the drive, then the cable to the USB port. 2.) First time the drive was plugged into the computer it came up as mass storage devie but nothing under windows explorer or computer management (but was there under device manager) 3.) Safely remove the device, then reconnect it. 4.) If this hasn't done the trick, go into device manager and uninstall both the disk under disk drives, and the USB device under usb devices. 5.) Now seach for changes in hardware (Button at the top of device manager). This should find the drive and name it accordingly. 6.) The next problem I found was i couldnt edit or read any of the files. Later found this to be due to the drive not having enough free space for windows to write its necessary information. Hope this helps some people atleast, sure got me going with my cheap Chinese USB to IDE cable.

I've assembled it and when I connected it to my laptop, Win XP would acknowledge that &quot;USB device&quot; has been connected however it would not be visible in &quot;My Computer&quot; or in &quot;Disk Management&quot; (but was detected in &quot;Device Manager&quot;). I have read and tried a lot to resolve the matter but not luck until I have put the HD in the enclosure again and I noticed that the 1st time it wasn't tightly secured in place(WARNING: do not overdo the &quot;pushing part&quot; just make sure it is tightly secured in its place). I connected it then to my laptop again and it appeared in &quot;Disk Management&quot; from where I have partioned and formated the drive. SO check the connection between the External enclosure and the actual HD, the problem could be as simple as that. Good luck...

Maxtor External HD	Hello - I have read the above strings and still have no clue on what to do. My problem is that my Acer XP computer no longer sees my Maxtor 3100 external hard drive (not seen in disk management or device manager). I plug it in and all there is is blinking on the cord and the drive. There is no sound of movement inside, as there once was. I degfragged a few days ago and thought that might be the issue (since I think it was mentioned above) but have NO IDEA how to fix the problem. All other items work in USB so it's not the plug. I did plug the wrong power supply, 24a vs normal 12a for about 1 minute, before realizing I had the wrong power supply connected to my HD. There are very important pics on the drive and I cannot afford to loose them. In addition, I am a long way from the states, so unless I know what I am looking for at the store, there isn't anyone to ask. I need help but in very simple terms; all I really know about computers is how to Google - hence how I found this help discussion. Thank you, Susan

If not.... suggest removing the hard disk drive (HDD) from the external enclosure and verifying if it is or isn't spinning up. The way I'd do that is connect it POWER ONLY as an internal HDD in a desktop PC. If it powers up ... then shut down the PC, connect it to the data cable and jumper it as a secondary NOT PRIMARY BOOTABLE DRIVE and see if the system recognizes it. If recognized, you might be able to copy your data to another hard drive in the desktop system. If the drive won't spin up and the data isn't available elsewhere...i.e. a backup of some sort, you're facing a sigificant expense for data recovery. Sorry to hear about your dilemma. VAPCMD

It's time to buy a new drive for the case then while the drive is disconnected, partition and format your new drive in the USB case. Once that's working, put the old maxtor drive intenally and copy all the files out to the new external. Once you're satisfied you've saved the files, run up the partition program in your OS and remove the partitions from the MAXTOR. Put the drive back into the MAXTOR case and then partition and format the MAXTOR. Copy all the files back there. Done. Bob

It's drive specific, so unfortunately I cannot provide any further guidance.

JAMHAY, Have you gone to DEVICE MANAGER to see if you have a conflict (exclamation point in a yellow, inverted triangle)? If there is a 'conflict' delete that USB driver for your external drive and then go to ADD HARDWARE and let your PC search and find this device. In doing this process it will add the driver back to this USB connection. I learned this process from the Western-Digital website (www.support.wdc.com) for my ADAPTEC USB 2.0 h.d. enclosure case. And it worked very well. So, you could go to W-D or Maxtor's Tech Support and possible find the same information to correct your problem. Hope this helps your frustration, Kevin

Basically, I usually keep my Lacie HD off, until I need to do my backups, (I also back up to tape once in a while), during the week I created another map to a network drive, and used the drive assignment letter ''G'', which had alway been my Lacie drive assignment. So when I went and turned on my Lacie drive last Friday, nothing happened! I thought it would just find the next available drive letter, but it did not. When I reasigned the newly mapped drive from last week and freed up ''G'' again, after a reboot and then turning on the HD drive, Explorer recognised it again. Hope this too helps.

But yesterday when i plugged it in windows xp made a sound ( the one it usually makes when i plug smthng in) but when i open my computer it doesnt show it there. Actually when the device is plugged in it cannot open my computer properly. I can see the the device on safely remove hardware but cannot safely remove it because it says it is being used by another program. I can also see the disk in device manager but when i click disk management when the thing is plugged on windows cant open it, it gets stuck and i have to use windows task manager to end the program. Also when I plug in the external hard drive my computer seems to slow down and it gets much faster as soon as i plug it out. I think 90 GB of the 120 GB disk is full. And the information in it is very important for me. My hard disk is 80GB and 70 GB's of it is full. Can these have something to do with it? Can someone out there please help me?

Add the type of platform you run eg. XP Home;XP Pro. Two things are evident from your post 1: you are running close to the bone with too little available space on your Desktop (as well as the external drive)2:Some data you risk losing, is important for you. Whatever the cause of your difficulty,you may be able to place the 80GB external drive in either your own desktop PC or a friends and transfer necessary files etc to another Hard disc or to cd/dvd backup. If necessary, (if eg. you already run 4 drives),temporarily substitute your external drive for a CD/DVD drive( so long as you have sufficient space to store data you can write the backups after you return the CD/DVD to the original home. Hope I havent confused you.

After having tried everything and at my wit's end as well, I tried changing my cables. When I changed the USB cable, everything worked perfectly. I didn't consider checking for a faulty USB cable as the system tray was able to recognize that a device was plugged in, but changing it did the trick. Hope this helps.
862	77	103929	2506281	2503821	foamieomie	6/5/07 5:35 PM	1.1810649E12	I posted this in a new thread but saw this (modified)	I recently bought a Seagate 40gb 2.0 USB external hard drive to use on my laptop for saving audio files. It says that it is plug and play and does not require anything but XP to find the driver. My setup is not top notch but will do. Toshiba laptop, XP Pro SP One, PIII, 512mb ram, and I added a PCMCIA USB 2.0 cardBus to upgrade from the 1.1 that's in the back of the laptop. When I first plugged the ext. drive in I got a &quot;this device is not working properly&quot; message in the lower right hand corener but it did recognize it. Then when I went to investigate in the device manager it was there with the yellow exclamation point and said that the drivers weren't installed. So I updated the drivers but the ones installed were the best for the device. When I went back a page to the properties it said &quot;this device cannot start - code 10&quot;. So that WAS/IS(?) the problem to be solved. I tried to restart and try again. The drive won't even be recognized now unless I put it in the slow 1.1 usb and not the 2.0. I still get the same messages when I look at the properties in the device manager too and it won't work. The 2.0 still won't recognize it as it did the first time I plugged it in. I don't think it's a power problem. The PCMCIA is powered to 5VDC like it should be and it comes with a power cord to plug it in the 1.1 slot for extra juice if you need it and according to the hard drive I do not. I also tried plugging it into the wall using another power cord. No luck. Also tried it on another computer that only had the 1.1 and it recognized it but same device properties amd problems. Sorry for the manifesto but I'd really like to get this fixed. Todd

Also follow the instructions closely. This will not solve your problem completely but will at least let you see your drive in Computer Management (CM). From there you can explore the drive and do some of the other suggestions people came up with. I suggest once you access the drive in CM create a map to change drive letter paths and creating /add/ create new folder. You will be able to see you drive in explorer under the new folder. Cheese but it works.

Essentially, turn off case, disconnect P/S and disconnect USB cable. I then plugged in USB cable, plugged power supply back into the back of the enclosure, turned it on and my computer found it.

THE SOLUTION IS TOWARDS THE END UNDER THE HEADING SOLUTION. THE PROBLEM IS HERE ____________________________ I included the problem so that you can check if your difficulties are similar to mine. You don't neccesarily have to read this part. It may be best to just read the solution first and then check to see if the problem I had is similar to yours and therefore the solution I found maybe worth trying. Just a quick preview of the difficulties I had: I have two computers running windows 2000 Pro. I am also install on partitions. My external drive is an akasa integral esata 3.5 hard drive enclosure with seperate power supply. It can take ide sata and esata 3.5 inch drives. ( fyi not relevant but...I chose this because I currently have ide hard drives but will eventually upgrade to sata. Also I bought a sata drive by mistake when I was just starting out in computing. when I upgrade the large ide drive I now have goes in the enclosure UC. Also the external power supply is a must, I can't get enough power to my HD ( or practically anythingh else )using my laptops USB 2 ports) I installed the sata drive and powered it up connected it up to my desktop all was lovely. It worked I formated it in disc manager (go to &gt;admin tools &gt;computer manager) and set up two partitions ( probably one partition to many but old habit etc). I installed the hard drive on the second partition of my laptop and the hard drive worked fine. I then installed the hard drive on the first partition of my laptop. That was when the problems started. First It would install and recogise it under &quot;device manager&quot; but &quot;my computer&quot; said it as an unpartitioned unused unformated disk drive ( althout curiously got the assigned drive letter correct). The drive was NOT recognized by disk manager. The drive WAS however recognised as a &quot;usb mass storage device&quot; in unplug eject hardware icon. I tried all know possible combination of switching it on of unplugging and rebooting and still couldn't get the thing to work for me. I checked that the machine was still working on my desktop and yess that was still fine so it wasn't the drive. well you know what they say ... IF all else fails read the manual - checked the manual , I'd played it by the book so all should be fine. check the microsoft website and nothing worthwhile, checked with the correct akasa website ( fyi - I checked www.akasa.com and got nothing, turns out the proper site address www.akasa.com.tw ( and not /tw either) someone is doing some really lame ad based cyber squating which I think is deceptive, low and pathetic) Theres an new updated version of the manual and it says that you've got make sure the jumper pins set the drive as master. ----------------------------------------- SO THE SOLUTION - SET THE JUMPER PINS TO MASTER I solved the problem by setting the jumper pins on the sata drive in the hard drive enclosure to master. one last thing If you have never set jumper pins before don't worry its the easy to do. You will need to consult the manual for your hard drive. Which you should be able to find over the internet. Because the drive I am using was SATA the manual didn't mention anything about setting the jumper pins for master and slave. However it did have something about setting the jumper pins for master and slave on a nearly identical PATA ( or ide) model. The jumper setting were thankfully the same for sata as they were for IDE. The drive is working again and I am happy. I hope this helps JAGWAPAT (JUST ANOTHER GEEK WITH A PC AND TOO much TIME)

I find that pcmcia is useless at powering almost anything heaftier than a mouse regardless if I use the power cable or not( and yess I have the correst polarity). there is only one solution for usb 2 speeds and that is an external powered drive. they're getting cheaper but then so are new laptops. hope this helps PS Manifesto WTF JAGWAPATT (JUST ANOTHER GEEK WITH A PC AND TOO much TIME)

I bought a Simpletech external hard drive (the ones designed by Pininfarina)a few months ago, 250 GBs. It used to work fine with no problems, but recently the system stopped displaying the information stored in it, first it wouldnt recognize the hard drive, then it did, but when it did, after a small while I had to restart the drive because I couldnt look at the info in it, and finally the system detects the hard drive, marks how much space is used and left, but anything stored in folders wont be displayed at all. Ive tried the following: Restoring the system Reinstalling the HD's controller Changing USB cables and ports Checking the disc for errors (at phase 4 it failed for some reason) Checking the system for virus and antispyware Checking the hard drive in other computer (works fine in other computer) I mailed Simpletech for support, but I would like to know if someone here has experienced the same problem and managed to solve it, as far as I can tell, its a system problem, not a hard drive problem, but then again, I could be wrong. The HD had a IEEE 1394a Fireware interface, Im running on Windows XP Home Edition 2002 SP2. If someone knows how to solve this problem, I would really appreciate any help and input. Thank you.

My laptop, HP, on XP sp2, p4 HT, 1gb ram is not recognising the drive, this seems to be linked to the power light on the drive, connected via usb2.0 cable. Sometimes it is recognised but increasingly it either comes up as drive f, usually its drive f but seagate f, lately its just plain and simple f and when i try to explore it there's nothing, as the laptop tries to interrogate the drive the power light goes out for long periods, and its not done that until this current problem. Hope that's enough to tempt you to assist, if you need more, please ask and i'll tell all... Thanks subsy1662

So im having that problem + did what you said, but i can't get the drive to turn on when it's off. i held it for 20 seconds one time. it'll only turn when you log into an account, but the light is on for literally 1 second and goes off. then i see the popup on my desktop that there are no drivers for this. my biggest problem is that this is my dad's 250gb maxtor external hard drive, and i'm screwed if he finds out. if it helps, i was moving my whole itunes library to it, which is over 88 gb, but fir on both drives. then moving it onto a different external hard drive (my 160gb western digital) and then it went downhill about halfway through the second process.any tips?

(USB Device not recognized on my maxtor onetouch mini4) I tried a cable for my MP3 player that was hanging around and it works fine. It was a single USB connector cable, not the dual power/data cable. Anyways it seems to be supplying enough power for it to work fine for me. Good luck Everyone.

Only difference is that I have a 320GB WD Passport which holds about 300GB of data. Before this happened, I plugged my WD into the USB port. Then I clicked and dragged one file (mp3) onto the Windows Media Player. Then my laptop froze. All open applications went &quot;Not responding&quot;. I clicked on the 'Safely Remove Hardware' icon, but nothing happened. After about 20 minutes, I pulled the USB cable, then restarted my computer. After that, I pretty much experienced what you explained. A few hours later, I could still see my files, but cannot use any file. But now (4th day) my WD just doesn't appear when I plug it in. Help!!!
