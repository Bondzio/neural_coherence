frist off i would make sure the frist router has built in hardware firewall if not get one asap then i would use one of the ports from the hub to branch off to a computer that was running linux software and use router software on that machine then hook the wireless router to the computer and branch that way cause then the hackers have to switch on the fly between the os's and this is not a feat that most noobs hackers know how to do and you can also install a linux firewall on that pc as well i use 2 software firewalls behind a linksys befsx41 hardware firewall but if you can afford it there are way higher priced routers that do a way better job of protecting the network if all that seems over your head i can help you with the installation as you have to know how to route everything so that it works if you have jsut a standard router that has no hardware firewall this is no protection and i could break into your network in under 10 seconds steal all your files in under 20 seconds and leave 1000 backdoors in under 30 seconds running one program using only one command where as you use a linux box as a router i would have to frist break into your router then into the os then thru the linux box then thru the wireless router and to a hacker that is way to much time to be messing with you see to be a good hacker you need to get in and get out in as less time as possiable so you arent detected and i could go on for days and days at how i could hide my main pc thru a series of other stolen pc's were the it would spend all day chasing his tail between his legs coming up with dead ends at every ping you can ask any good it and they will tell you that when a hacker has to switch oses to to hack some one most hackers will run like you have the plague but if all this seems over your head then at least make sure you have hardware firewall on frist router to the dsl and then run wireless off the hub but with dsl you are kinda safer then say using cable modem because everytime you use the network to access the internet the dsl router has to dail into dsl network that is when you are most unsecure is when the actual connection is made and the very frist thing i would find out is what topology your network is (star, etc) but from what you describe it sounds to be a star topology which is the best one for networking i think and i would use at least a 15 letter symbol signs uppercase lowercase password as a minimum (i my self set the password on my router with special characters from the character map tool (what this will do is lock everyone including your self out of the router as most routers will except the password but you wont be able to type it which means that after u set the router password and settings you lock it up like fort knox the bad side to this is if you need to get back into the router (which you really shouldnt have to)you will have to use the rest button to reset the defualt password back up the upside is if you use the right characters if some one was using a password cracker on the router you can make it so when they discover the password you can cause some of the letters to show up as a block instead of showing the actual letter and they will scratch there heads for years trying to figure out what is behind the block here is a example &#292;&#265;&#311;&#279;&#343;&#351;&#2652;&#266;&#261;&#315;&#315;m33&#2614;&#2587; now as you can see in this form all the symbols and stuff show up cause the way the form works but what you see is not so because some of thses are being shown as something else when they are infact different symbols hiding behind the x's and the u's are differnet if you were to veiw this from any windows os or any other os you would see square boxes where the x's and u's are and the ravai(characters &#2652;&#2614;&#2587;) would also show up as square boxes you can experment on the os your self to see what i have showed you and i dont recommend you use this tech for any os passwords as it will cause problems that can only be fixed with a reinstall of the os but on routers and such this works great only do this after you have set the router up and a password of this kind will deter the uberest hackers there are and they will scratch there heads for years trying to figure out what is behind the square boxes that there password cracker shows up the reason they show as square boxes is because os are not allowed to show special characters that the os uses for code this is an old school acsii trick
