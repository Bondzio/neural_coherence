I will look into the what Coryphaeus said and look at HP's website for a picture of my pc.
Then I will compare it to what you said.
If I understand everything and the steps are all the same, then I will try to do it.
If not, I'll come back here for more help!
You know I can't get enough of this website!
Thanks, YLC
