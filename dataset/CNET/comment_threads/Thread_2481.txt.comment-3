I have the same CPU and CPU-Z recognizes it correctly.
Try downloading the latest version of CPU-Z or just doing a fresh install.
Look under the system info in XP, if it says XP3200+ then I wouldn't be concerned about it.
I have a question though for you.
I have a similarly configured system: AMD Athlon XP 3200+ 2x512MB PC3200 ATI X1300PRO 256MB 160GB HD 7200RPM What kind of games do you play?
Do you experience any lag while playing Half-life 2 due to the CPU?
Sometimes I get some studdering and freezes while running.
Shutting down background apps helps quite a bit, but occasionally I still get some problems.
I was wondering if it was due to the low clockspeed at 2.2GHz.
