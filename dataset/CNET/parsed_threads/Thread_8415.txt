<s> For the past 2 mornings when first getting on my computer, it is showing 54% cpu usage with nothing open. </s>
<s> (I leave my computer one all the time) I go into task manager and it shows msmsgs.exe,Internet explorer and lucallback.exe running. </s>
<s> I googled the lucallback.exe which I didn't undersatnd as it says something about a proxy and also auto updates. </s>
<s> My computer is set for auto updates but the time is set for 2:30 AM, it is 6:30 when I get on my computer. </s>
<s> The time and date are correct in the control panel. </s>
<s> When I do a re-start it says that msmsgs.exe and explorer needs to close. </s>
<s> I end the program, restart and everything is back to normal with the processor runnning between 1 and 4 %. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks Wayne </s>
<s> &quot;lucallback.exe&quot; is I believe Norton's &quot;Live Update&quot; utility which is not the same as Windows Updates. </s>
<s> As for msmsgs.exe, are you leaving Windows Messenger running the background? </s>
<s> If so it may be doing various pings among other things to see if you are still connected, which icon to show, etc. </s>
<s> since some have time thresholds of like &quot;after 15 minutes of idle show Away&quot; message. </s>
<s> Internet Explorer is a world unto itself I think in terms of its CPU and memory usage at times though it could be worth noting which version you use and if there are updates or enhancements for it. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> Yes, windows messenger was running so I turned it off in gpedit.msc. </s>
<s> I am also using Norton anti-virus so I turned off the auto updates feature there and will just do it manually. </s>
<s> I keep reading that a persons computer can be used as a zombie computer so that is why I was concerned. </s>
<s> I had never seen this before. </s>
<s> Thanks again and I will keep an eye on it for the next couple days. </s>
