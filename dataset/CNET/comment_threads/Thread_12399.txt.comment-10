Sorry, it's not the cost of the software I am worried about, I am just trying to make sure I have what I need.
You had mentioned above &quot;As to the software, you dont have to buy that.
It's only needed for playing Blu ray discs.&quot; but I don't know why else I would want to install a BD drive if I wasn't going to play discs with it.
Thanks for the replies!
