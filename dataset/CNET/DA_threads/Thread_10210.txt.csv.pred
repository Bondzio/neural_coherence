1.1.1	Hello Everybody , This is my first posting here so please bear with me .	St
1.1.2	I have been having a problem with an HP Pavilion a1250n ( AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ , 1gb ram , XP Media Center 2005 ) .	St
1.1.3	I first noticed it when the modem would disconnect whenever I ran a cpu intensive program that maximized cpu usage for more than a minute , such as a long computation or even the aquarium screen saver that comes with the system .	St
1.1.4	The modem would disconnect from my dial-up service after 50 seconds and I would be unable to connect until the cpu intensive program ended or I killed it .	St
1.1.5	After many fruitless calls to HP technical support I took it upon myself to investigate the problem and found that if I moved the modem to the middle PCI slot from its default bottom PCI slot it worked fine .	St
1.1.6	I then tested a sound card and another modem in the bottom slot and neither worked correctly although they did in one of the other PCI slots .	St
1.1.7	I exchanged the machine for another of the same model and found the exact same problem .	St
1.1.8	I exchanged yet again and again found the same problem .	St
1.1.9	So it appears the bottom PCI slot is bad in all of these or a large batch of them .	St
1.1.10	All of the machines I had used an MSI motherboard although the HP website now lists an ASUS motherboard in the a1250n 's specs .	St
1.1.11	Currently the third machine is at HP for repair ( putting in the ASUS motherboard ) and it has been there since Nov. 21 .	St
1.1.12	Anyway , I was hoping people with this machine could test for the problem I described .	St
1.1.13	HP claims mine is an isolated case but my experience with three different machines indicates otherwise .	St
1.1.14	The test is easy to do -- set the screen saver to the aquarium screen saver and set an activation time of 1 minute .	St
1.1.15	Dial in to your ISP and wait .	St
1.1.16	If the problem is there , the modem should disconnect within about 50 seconds of the screen saver 's appearance .	St
1.1.17	As a side note , the HP service technician and engineer working on the case have been great but the rest of HP 's 'award winning ' customer service has been atrocious .	St
1.1.18	They had me describe the problem and gave me the same solutions over and over , they told me they were going to call back and never did , they said a case manager had been assigned but one had n't , just to name a few of the problems I 've had with them .	St
1.1.19	I appreciate your help .	Polite
1.1.20	Kelly	St
1.2.1	in the world do n't you get an eMachine then ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.2	Or upgrade the model ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.3	Or have them put a MSI mobo instead of an ASUS .	St
1.2.4	I 'd really be surprised if it was a production fopah .	St
1.2.5	ASUS just does n't put out stuff like that .	St
1.2.6	This would n't be the first time HP 's chasis were the culprit either .	St
1.2.7	Either way ... good luck !	St
1.2.8	and life goes on ... Jack	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your response and I wanted to clarify some things .	St
1.3.2	All three machines that had the problem had the MSI motherboard ( MS-7184 , which is an OEM motherboard and not supported on MSI 's website , as far as I know ) and I asked that they put in an ASUS motherboard for the repair .	St
1.3.3	As for other options , the only other Athlon 64 X2 machine that I found from HP ( model m7248n ) uses the same MSI motherboard and eMachines does n't make an Athlon 64 X2 machine .	St
1.3.4	I considered putting my own together , which I 've done in the past , but I wanted a reliable machine from a well-known company with a good warranty and support .	St
1.3.5	Ironic , is n't it ?	Ques
1.3.6	As for an update , I spoke with the HP engineer working on the problem and he was very understanding and helpful , in direct contrast to most of the others I 've dealt with at HP .	St
1.3.7	He told me that he found a problem with the MSI motherboard and forwarded it to another engineering group for further investigation .	St
1.3.8	He said he found no problem with the ASUS motherboard but because it is a non-standard motherboard I would have difficulty getting BIOS updates from the HP website .	St
1.3.9	I 'm not sure if this is correct because the HP website now lists an ASUS motherboard as standard in the a1250n .	St
1.3.10	HP has offered to buy back the computer , which would make all of the time and effort I devoted to this problem a waste of time , or fix the machine with the ASUS mobo and give me $ 100 or unspecified upgrades , which I feel still does n't go far enough .	St
1.3.11	I 'm trying to decide between getting the money , building my own machine , and cutting all ties with HP or getting the repaired machine and cash .	St
1.3.12	Thanks for listening , Kelly	St
1.4.1	Obtain a serial port connected modem .	St
1.4.2	WinModems can do as you describe and fixing the Winmodem issues usually cost more than the known fix .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Anytime !	St
1.6.2	Getting it fixed with ASUS mobo , to me , would be the way to go here .	St
1.6.3	Even tho HP won't/maybe wo n't be able to support the BIOS you could still get them from ASUS .	St
1.6.4	The update procedure is n't much different .	St
1.6.5	BTW .	St
1.6.6	Merry Christmas ! !	St
1.6.7	and life goes on ... Jack	St
1.7.1	The Winmodem issue is well known but if this is so ( bad slot ) then they only need to exercise their warranty .	St
1.7.2	My offer is a solid fix and death of a well known problem .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	Remember when you could not use the slot next to the AGP slot ?	Ques
1.8.2	That issue was and still is a well known PC design issue .	St
1.8.3	To hold HP responsible for making a PC compatible design is a very interesting stance .	Sug
1.8.4	What about all the other PC ( and Windows ) nuances and quirks ?	Ques
1.8.5	Bottomline : If we are asking for a perfect machine , I do n't think we see such yet .	St
1.8.6	Bob	St
1.9.1	The original modem , a sound card , and another modem all worked fine in the middle PCI slot ( PCI2 ) but did not work properly in the bottom PCI slot ( PCI3 ) when another program was using 100 % of the cpu .	St
1.9.2	Is there a well known design issue pertaining to high cpu usage and the PCI3 slot ?	Ques
1.9.3	I 'm no expert but I have n't come across anything in my searches .	St
1.9.4	Also , the HP engineer working on the problem has told me he found a problem with the MSI motherboard but not an ASUS motherboard that is also listed for the machine .	St
1.9.5	I think the MSI board , MS-7184 , is used in most of HP 's Athlon 64 machines and by a number of other brands including eMachines ( according to http : //www.emachineupgraders.info ) .	St
1.9.6	I wonder if the problem is related to the dual core Athlon 64 X2 processor ?	Ques
1.9.7	Otherwise it seems it would be far more widespread than it is .	St
1.9.8	HP still claims mine is the only case they have even though their own engineer found a problem on his test model .	St
1.9.9	Obviously the easiest thing to have done was to put the modem in PCI2 and lived with an unusable PCI3 slot .	St
1.9.10	That would have bothered me and HP said they would repair it and get it back to me in 5-7 days so I sent it to them .	St
1.9.11	It is still sitting in the repair shop while they wait for an ASUS motherboard to arrive .	St
1.9.12	Oh well .	St
1.9.13	Kelly	St
1.10.1	The annoyance has been around for a very long time .	St
1.10.2	However it comes and goes with how good a driver writer you have and more .	St
1.10.3	You may not find solace with HP so I offered a solid fix of how we cure that .	St
1.10.4	Your choice to fight it , but that 's your choice .	St
1.10.5	Winmodems are well known failure points with high CPU loads .	St
1.10.6	If this is news to you then welcome to the winmodem story .	St
1.10.7	Bob	St
1.11.1	I knew winmodems sometimes had problems with high cpu load but I did n't know if it was PCI slot specific .	St
1.11.2	Since the sound card I had also did n't work in the slot but both worked in another slot I thought it pointed to a motherboard problem .	St
1.11.3	I 'm finding a little solace with HP .	St
1.11.4	They finally have the new ASUS motherboard at the repair site but I 'm still trying to decide whether I want the machine back or the full refund they have offered .	St
1.11.5	I am still furious with the customer service/technical support side of things at HP so I may not want to have anything to do with them anymore .	St
1.11.6	Thank you for your interest in this issue .	St
1.11.7	Kelly	St
1.12.1	Thanks , and Merry Christmas to you as well .	St
1.12.2	I 'll probably go the route with the new ASUS motherboard but I 'm still furious at the technical support/customer service side of HP for this ordeal .	St
1.12.3	I did get a little of what I wanted from HP when the engineer called me and thanked me for troubleshooting this problem .	St
1.12.4	He also said it was now in another engineering group 's hands to come up with a fix for it , so at least I know someone at HP is working on fixing it for future machines .	St
1.12.5	Take care , Kelly	St
1.13.1	The IRQs are now shared .	St
1.13.2	If a driver has a bug then under high load the IRQ software chain may show the bugs .	St
1.13.3	This is not a HP specific issue and why I offer the surefire cure .	St
1.13.4	However there are some that do n't want to hear that PCs still have bugs to be worked out .	St
1.13.5	Bob	St
1.14.1	I suspected the shared IRQs initially but did n't have the knowledge or time to fix the problem on my own .	St
1.14.2	I hoped HP technical support would come up with a fix in the form of a driver or BIOS update but all they ever told me to do was reinstall the original driver , which did n't work .	St
1.14.3	Your suggestion of a serial attached modem is valid in that it would give me a working modem but I could have that by simply putting the modem in one of the other slots .	St
1.14.4	In either case , as pointed out by jackintucson , I would be left with a slot that I could n't use for a modem , a sound card , or who knows what else .	St
1.14.5	It seems that if one manufacturer ( ASUS ) has a board that does n't have this problem then the other manufacturer ( MSI ) should do what it takes to fix the problem with their board .	St
1.14.6	At least now someone at HP is working on this problem and hopefully a simple solution for the MSI motherboard will be found .	St
1.14.7	Thank you for your input , Kelly	St
1.15.1	Right before Xmas , I purchased a HP a1250n .	St
1.15.2	The evening I recieved it , I downloaded a BIOS upgrade and my computer has been 'hung-up ' ever since .	St
1.15.3	I ca n't describe how terrible HP 's Service has been .	St
1.15.4	I will return my machine on Monday and never purchase another HP product .	St
1.15.5	I concure that the problem is a faulty main board/BIOS .	St
1.15.6	This board , the # ms-7184 is NOT supported by MSI and that 's about the same for HP .	St
1.15.7	It looks like it was made by MSI as an OEM product for HP .	St
1.15.8	Every post I can find on this machine , reports some kind of base-level problem .	St
1.15.9	It would be my recomendation , that anyone thinking about purchasing this computer , look elsewhere .	St
1.16.1	NIL	St
1.17.1	i have hp m7290.nl with ms-7184 pci is the problem the usb dosnt working good http : //h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/nl/nl/ho/WF06b/36757-37161-39925-39925-39925-12252912-64934755.html	St
