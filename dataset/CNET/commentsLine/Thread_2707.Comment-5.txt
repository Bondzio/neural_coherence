here local thrift shops have used broadband modems of all kinds.
if your local area it should be also, depending on town/city.
its worth the try.
since, you mentioned thi is a 5yr.
old box, yeah maybe its suffering the effects of wear&tear, so a used modem is worth the swap, we're talking well under $10.
also, a friend with a cell phone certainly would be a friend if borrowed to call during an outage.
