you start over.
your doing this backwards start with the motherboard and then add from there.
choose a mother board with the most universal socket that you can get then make sure it can run the most advanced cpu that is available the day you buy it.
motherboard first then cpu then ram and graphics card, then all the rest.
much of this will depend on your personal needs and wants choose components that fit them.
