<s> I get an error message saying the power cable is not connected and the card is running on low power as a result. </s>
<s> It looks like the card has a 6 pin power cable female connector on it that needs to be supplied with power by a cable which was supposed to come with my card (which I don't have because EVGA didn't send me one in the upgrade replacement card they sent me.) </s>
<s> If you look at the below image (the first one), you'll see it's a 6 pin female connector on the card. </s>
<s> There is no such male connector coming out of my computer's PSU, (my computer is a Dell Dimension E520). </s>
<s> You'll see in the second picture that there are two Molex connectors that need to plug in somewhere. </s>
<s> WHERE DO THEY PLUG IN????? </s>
<s> EVGA still hasn't gotten back to me to answer this question. </s>
<s> This whole thing is very confusing. </s>
<s> Look at the two photos of the salient parts of the graphics card. </s>

<s> But where do the two molex connectors plug into? </s>
<s> The below power supply was the only one I found that provided a six pin connector that looked like it might plug into the Graphics card. </s>
<s> There were other 500watt power supplies (PSUs) on newegg but none of them had the 6 pin power connector. </s>
<s> Am I to believe I have to buy the below power supply in order to use my video card? </s>
<s> Please offer some clear light on this matter! </s>
<s> I'm rather flummoxed by all this. </s>
<s> And as helpful as these replies have attempted to be... </s>
<s> I don't see how they answer my question (which should be clear by now--which is where do I plug those two giant plugs into.) </s>
<s> And my second question in light of the below power supply is do I not need the two big &quot;molex?&quot; connectors to use my video card if I use the 6 pin connector supplied FROM the below PSU? </s>

<s> So that there is no possibility of confusion or misunderstanding, the two large molex connectors I'm talking about are: [img] http://bp3.blogger.com/_Y8WoJeZ-J4c/R-Auq-TqNTI/AAAAAAAAA4k/LnF6QJNLotk/s400/plugin.jpg [/img] It doesn't look like my PSU is compatible with this card. </s>
<s> There are no free power cables coming out of the PSU, except one Molex which is up by my CD drive. </s>
<s> the e520 only has a 305w power supply which is too small for an 8600gts. </s>
<s> that's why it doesn't have a pci-e plug. </s>
<s> http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dime520/en/SM_EN/specs.htm#wp1052310 most new 400+ watt power supplies will be fine for you and will have the pci-e plug. </s>
<s> i'm wary of thermaltake power supplies, but folks seem to like this 430w for $40 . </s>
<s> raidmax units are an OK budget alternatives with this 530w unit for $60 before $20 rebate . </s>
<s> don't expect a full 530w out of it (it's really more like a 400w unit), but it will handle your 8600gts. </s>
<s> antec's a good safe choice with this 500w for $79 . </s>
<s> if you prefer corsair, here's a 450w for $89 . </s>
<s> Thanks!! </s>
<s> I finally understand. </s>
<s> I bought a PSU that seems to have gotten very good reviews and also seems to be just powerful enough for my graphics card. </s>
<s> $29.99 after $10 mail in rebate. </s>

<s> consider a more robust, more efficient PSU. </s>
<s> It can save you money in the long run as it can often be used in another system requiring more watts and AMPs and greater efficiency generates reduced energy use. </s>
<s> Less efficient power supplies simply use more electricity to generate the power required to run the system. </s>
<s> By purchasing a higher quality, more powerful, more efficient PSU now .... the PSU will reliably support the current system, use less electricity and be transferable to a future system requiring more power. </s>
