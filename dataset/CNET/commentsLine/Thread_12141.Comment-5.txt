for $650 after rebates with a monitor and printer:  click on the pc specifications here:  keep in mind that a flat-screen crt monitor is not a 3-4 inch thick flat-screen(panel) lcd monitor (like the photo's show).
one additional good thing about the hp a810n is that it has an agp slot so that you can later upgrade the integrated graphics to something better for video editing and better gaming.
