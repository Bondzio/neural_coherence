<s> I am trying to set up a wireless router and I am having trouble. </s>
<s> My modem is a usb modem that was given to us by our internet provider. </s>
<s> Because of this I am having trouble connecting my router. </s>
<s> Are there routers that are able to be used with a usb modem? </s>
<s> If not where do I go from here? </s>
<s> are designed to connect to the PC only. </s>
<s> Unless you have a router with a USB port, and I haven't seen one. </s>
<s> You'll need to use an Ethernet cord to connect the modem to the router. </s>
<s> I have had a similar problem concerning USB modems and Wireless Routers. </s>
<s> My advice is to go for a Router with a Modem in it. </s>
<s> Someting like this.... http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000TZ8Z8/026-8642947-4250041 </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I will be purchasing the router that you suggested. </s>
<s> I was looking in the manual for this router and it talks about an ADSL filter. </s>
<s> Did you require one of these when you installed your router? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
