3257	0	235551	2413872	NR	whitty	2/25/07 3:02 PM	1.17241572E12	boot-up problems	I installed a new lexmark x3470 all-in-one printer/scanner/copier last week on my computer. I have xp with sp2. Today I turned on my computer and it took about 10 minutes to boot-up. If I unplug the printer cable from the computer it boots up as fast as ever. Any ideas why?
