<s> If I were to get a new mobo, and I had an ATI Graphics card, what mobo do you guys think I should get? </s>
<s> It seems pretty useless if I bought a SLI Mobo, but I saw some non SLI mobos with 2 PCI-E16 ports (one of the DFI mobos), would it be possible for 2 ATI cards to be used for a SLI like effect? </s>
<s> soon ati will come out with dat technology. </s>
<s> it will be similar to nvidias sli. </s>
<s> so if I want a ATI card, I should wait a bit longer for a new motherboard that will support ATI dual graphics? </s>
<s> hmm i not sure when dat might be. </s>
<s> i know ati will come out with the technology to support to ati cards, hmm think it was called m.v.p multivideo processing? </s>
<s> or somethin but i aint sure when dat might be. </s>
<s> however, i would go with nvidia cards as they support newer technology. </s>
<s> is there a reason u want 2 gfx card? </s>
<s> U wont see a difference in gaming. </s>
<s> only in benchmarks, the scores are higher. </s>
<s> on this board http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=13825&vpn=LANPARTY-UT-NF4-ULTRA-D&manufacture=DFI there is some Dual Xpress Graphics which I think is kinda like SLI, but it's not. </s>
<s> Has anyone heard of this? </s>
<s> Can this feature be used with ANY graphics card? </s>
<s> How does the performance compare to SLI? </s>
<s> think its sli cuz it is a nvidia nforce 4 mobo </s>
<s> ^Thats what it says in the description though... </s>
<s> I read somewhere that the new GeForce drivers won't support Dual Xpress... </s>
<s> It's supposed to say Dual Xpress Graphics is a nice option for those that are not looking for SLI. </s>
<s> A) ATI's tech is called AMR, ATI Multi Rendering B) it's release is unknown, but supposedly it comes with R520 (their next gen) which should be out around January C) Dual Xpress is for running 2 video cards for 4 monitors D) currently only certain nVidia based cards can run in SLI and aside from that just get a darn nVidia they support SM3.0 (DirectX 9.0c) while ATI does not, and cannot w/o softawre emulation (Which makes the game run super slow) i'd get a 6800GT and be done with it if you really wanna spend the money, just get a new 512MB 6800 Ultra from BFG, should set you back around $860 but personally, i say 6800GT, decent Athlon64x2, and you should be fine for a while </s>
<s> ATI just released details about CrossFire, u can mix Crossfire cards with current x800/850 cards.... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> found an inquirer article here http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=23569 and that does go along with ATI's original AMR concept to not use a bridge of any kind BUT it does'nt meet half the stuff they claimed it would (that each cadr would get 16 lanes of PCIE (which is possible a full PCIE bus is 32 lanes)) and stuff about X600's working with it but that reminds me of Voodoo2 </s>
<s> I really like the X800XL and might even get it, but I was wondering what the NVIDIA equivalent to the X800XL is. </s>
<s> The reason I'm looking to see if there is a NVIDIA board is because ATI doesn't support Shader 3.0 yet... Is the difference between Shader 2.0 and 3.0 even that big/important? </s>
<s> If not, maybe I'll just get the ATI board. </s>
<s> Can the X800XL be compared to the 6800GT? </s>
<s> There is like a $100 price difference but the performance is very similar in many benchmarks (except for DoomIII) </s>
<s> ok, i'll answer the ohter Q's too Shader Model (Pixel Shader and Vertex Shader) 3.0 vs 2.0 it's not a performance thing, unless you don't support it SM 3.0 on GeForce 6 means they can run SM 3.0 stuff smoothly (i've run Half-Life 2 in SM 3.0 on my 6800GT, and it never skipped a beat (at HIGH settings, on a comparativly slow CPU)) while ATI supports SM 2.0 you can software emulate it, BUT it will cut performance down A LOT (it takes a lot of oomph to emulate parts of it) ok secondly nVidia has no competition for the X800XL which is why ATI put it out X800XL is basically a cut down X850XT card it has a full 16 pipes in performance the 6800 Ultra is about 5-15 percent faster, and the 6800GT is about 5-15 percent slower depending on the game/benchmark/who you ask (and in Doom III nVidia cards just whip the stuffing out of that game) personally i'm going to suggest a 6800GT which is about $30 cheaper and more easily avliable for AGP if you want a PCIE card the 6800GT will cost more so that could be where your getting your dif from (the X800XL was released for PCIE first, and AGP second, so it's more expensive on AGP, while the 6800GT was released on AGP first, and PCIE second, so it's more expensive on PCIE (basically the ATI has to convert to AGP, and the nVidia has to convert to PCIE, and the conversion doesn't hurt performance at all)) hope this helps </s>
<s> I was looking at PCI-E these are the prices I saw AGP X800XL - $500+ 6800GT - $400-$500 PCI-E X800XL - $400-$500 6800GT - $490-$600 But now I'm going wait a bit, cause I think the current card prices might drop this summer with new technology possibly coming out. </s>
<s> it's not a possibility it's a definite the question is more so WHEN between now, and July and usually the prices go UP price a 5950 Ultra i gurantee it'll cost over $350 new also where are you shopping? </s>
<s> an X800XL for PCIE should cost $300-$350 and for AGP around $325-$375 and a 6800GT for AGP should be $275-$350 and for PCIE around $399-$425 </s>
<s> My figures are in canadian dollars, so i think $400 CAD is somewhere around $310-$320 USD </s>
<s> AGP X800XL - $500 CAD = $401 US = Newegg price $313US 6800GT - $400-500 CAD=$320.84-$401US = Newegg $294US PCI-E X800XL - $400-500 CAD=$320.84-$401US = Newegg $279US 6800GT - $490-600 CAD=$393-$481.18US= Newegg $349US </s>
<s> neweggs prices are very good </s>
<s> Does newegg ship to canada? </s>
<s> dang, newegg doesn't ship to canada does anyone know any good stores that do ship to canada? </s>
<s> the only ones i know are tigerdirect (which gets bad reviews) ncix, which seems okay and anitec </s>
<s> Has anyone bought anything from MonarchComputer.com before? </s>
<s> Are they good? </s>
<s> I think they ship to Canada... </s>
<s> Does anyone know if ZipZoomFly or ChiefValue.com ship to Canada? </s>
<s> Is it possible to find a 6800GT under $400 USD? </s>
<s> Newegg seems to have it, but they don't ship to canada... </s>
<s> I've been reading some articles that claim that by the time SM 3.0 code is commonly used, all the NVIDIA cards that support it today will not be able to run it at reasonable speeds, so that the X800XL is still the better deal for now. </s>
<s> Is this true? </s>
<s> cause I think I heard Far Cry or some other game is using SM 3.0 code... </s>
<s> I have also read that the X800XL gives better image quality at the cost of slighty slower fps, is this true? </s>
