I've heard it only lets you use the Amazon Apps store(although it seems to be you could use any app store with the Silk browser, I guess they're incompatible?). That is the sort of limitation I'm concerned about. Does the HD have these limitations?

I'll not duplicate open discussions but Android tablets are all over the map here. Some can't use the stores, others do, I can't keep track of the some thousand models out there but the KF HD is a great device. Bob

Let's compare the walled garden that is the iPad to the wild wild west of those android tablets from makers you never heard of. In order from garden to wild wild west I think it's like this. iPad, KF (current models), Nexus and then a long path to the no-name models. Great to have choices. I can't dissect all of this in 3 paragraphs and all this has open discussions so I will summarize. Bob
