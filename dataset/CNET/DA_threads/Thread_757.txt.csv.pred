1.9.3	You can build according to their specs .	St
1.10.1	if you know how to build computers you need to check the prices sometimes its cheaper buy a brand name , the best is DEll for just cases and MB that it uses also some of the deals they have especially this month they are giving alot away like free printer and 17 & quot ; or 19 & quot ; LCD , The other companies are a pain to add hardware like harddrives , because you do n't know whose Motherboard is used plus the cases are small and pain to take apart .	St
1.10.2	You need to get the parts cheap to match brand name since you get OS for nothing .	St
1.10.3	I just brought from DELL different computers , I could n't build them for the price I got them .	St
1.10.4	I got was Dimension 8400 has Intel Motherboard with intel 915G chipset which has Matrix RAID onboard .	St

St
1.10.8	parts along cost $ 1500 without OS .	St
1.11.1	Dell 's MB 's are of the lowest quality their cases are equal and their PSU 's , while decent , do n't allow much upgradeability you can put any hard drive in any machine it 's just an IDE device as far as grpahics it 's the same way Dell is a horrible company as they give you zero upgradeability ( few have AGP slots , bad BIOS , bad RAM , bad cooling )	St
1.12.1	That is your opinion ozos , perhaps from some you have come across in the past , but not the later Dell 's IMO , especially in the 8400 series and XPS .	St
1.12.2	Even the 4700 series ( along with the 8400/XPS now all have the PCI-Express x-16 capabilities instead of no upgrade .	St
1.12.3	The cooling is OK on the 8400 with their bigger case and the RAM is now adequate IMO .	St
1.12.4	Dell will also be coming out with the new Intel dual processors as recently reported .	St
1.13.1	i 'm talking about low end Dell 's the XPS Gen 4 is what ?	Ques
1.13.2	$ 3000 ?	Ques
1.13.3	$ 2000 ?	Ques
1.13.4	something like that the 8400 is amazingly expensive ( i know this , a friend got one , their expensive beyond belief , and for what you get ... yuck ) it wasl ike $ 2200 , and features a slower GPU , and comparable CPU to my system which is only around $ 1200 i mean seriously ... Dell 's low end are just junk , no upgrades and bad BIOS and their high end are over priced	St
1.14.1	Do n't know what your friend is telling you but the 8400 is not & quot ; amazingly expensive & quot ; .	St
