So I have a rather old IBM, its a Pentium 4 (2.4 Ghz) Netvista 8307.
It runs well, I have lots of RAM (1.5GB) but I was thinking about putting in a new video card.
As I understand though, these things have to be compatible with the motherboard.
Could any let me know if some of the newer Nvidia 8 series cards would be compatible.
I found a review of the Netvista here on Cnet and in the specifications under &quot;Free expansion slots&quot; I found 3 ( 3 ) x PCI - Three-quarter-length, 1 ( 1 ) x AGP 4x - Three-quarter-length I'm note sure what this means.
I realize older video cards used AGP system and that newer ones use PCI.
I believe the Nvidia 8 series is PCI x16.
Long story short, Nvidia 8 series card for IBM P4 (2.4Ghz) Netvista, possible?
