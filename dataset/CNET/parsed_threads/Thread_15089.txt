<s> Just got a new computer and I need to move the old files from my computer to the new computer. </s>
<s> I have seen the threads about moving files using external HDD, flash drives, transfer cables, and networking the computers. </s>
<s> However, my problem is that my new computer has Windows 7 while the old has XP. </s>
<s> Which method of file transfer would be the best for my situation? </s>
<s> Also, is there anyway that I could delete just the OS on the old hard drive and use it as a secondary drive without having any problems with file sharing? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> And used the Windows Easy Transfer. </s>
<s> I connected the ethernet cable from the old machine to the new and used some USB stick to hold Windows Easy Tranfer for the old machine. </s>
<s> This is not to write yet another tutorial but to share it works pretty good. </s>
<s> From xp to 7 is supported. </s>
