Recently, my input and output trays were broken in a freak accident, and have to be replaced. I looked at various sites, and couldn't find the parts. Are they replaceable, and if so, how much does it cost? Thank you.

Parts like that from HP are usually unavailable as you discovered and you may have to get an entire printer (dead or alive) to scavenge these. Once in a while you encounter folk that only want the parts they want. If so you, as the shop keeper get it from ebay, sell it to them for the usual markup of what the entire printer cost then ebay what remains. Bob

You can advertise there your quest or simply check on what's there. You take your chances. The other good source is simply googling away for any parts sources, but as this is a simple printer its better getting the whole unit. Goodwill online may have one or your local Sal. Army shop. http://www.shopgoodwill.com If you're lucky other thrift shops may have it too. The D4XXX series maybe common enough that other models may also work(not sure). Otherwise, you last attempt at keeping a D4200 is buying new and saving the consumables for your new printer, used as well can do this. tada -----Willy
