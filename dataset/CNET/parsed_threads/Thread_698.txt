<s> I'm looking to buy a hp laptop, for use mainly in school, and maybe some gaming here and there (Warcraft 3, civ 4, oblivion if I'm lucky, but probably not). </s>
<s> Anyway, I was wondering if there's a huge difference between have a hard drive with 5400 rpm, and a hard drive with 7200 rpm. </s>
<s> Considering what I'd be doing, would it have a huge effect? </s>
<s> I was also wondering if you could tell me if my other specs look good. </s>
<s> They look fine to me, but I'd like a second opinion. </s>
<s> - Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo Processor T6500 (2.1GHz, 2MB L2 Cache, 800MHz FSB) - 3GB DDR2 System Memory (2 Dimm) - 32-bit vista (will upgrade to win 7) - Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 4500MHD (I'm unsure about this card, I know it couldn't run Oblivion, but could it run Civ 4 an Warcraft 3) Thank you </s>
<s> While the difference is there its hardly noticeable. </s>
<s> For all intends and purposes only under intense work cycles will it be noted and even then it depends on the task. </s>
<s> Actually, for laptop usage, slower speed is desirable as a safety measure of sorts. </s>
<s> The choice is yours. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> My kid has that 4500 in a Toshiba. </s>
<s> What runs is pretty amazing. </s>
<s> Much more than I would have thought. </s>
<s> If you have to get a value machine, I'm giving this chipset the nod. </s>
<s> About drive RPM. </s>
<s> The balance in laptops would be the 5400 RPM. </s>
<s> I won't write any long dialog about this but it's where I like to be. </s>

<s> Would 1 MB for the L2 cache be enough? </s>
<s> I know vaguely what L2 cache does, but what does it and front side bus do specifically? </s>
<s> Frankly, you go get benchmarks and use a big fat black marker on the size of L2 Cache. </s>
<s> The benchmarks matter. </s>
<s> Not the L2 cache size. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> I'm ordering a custom laptop from hp. </s>
<s> I'd go 7,200 RPM. </s>
<s> The other thing you may want to consider is whether you get a matte finish (anti-glare) or gloss (highly reflective) screen with the laptop. </s>
<s> I strongly recommend the matte finish as it eliminates glare and reflection coming from anywhere and everywhere. </s>
<s> If you're getting Vista...I recommend getting the 64 bit version and that you should get a free upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. </s>
<s> Let us know how it turns out. </s>
<s> VAPCMD While I'm not 100% sure it has a matte (anti-glare) screen, this HP laptop looked pretty interesting to me. </s>
<s> Downside it is what it is.... no options although you could change/replace the drive. </s>
