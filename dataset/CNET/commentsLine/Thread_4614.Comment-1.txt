will a prescott series p4 operate properly in any 800mhz mainboard or does it require special chipset support.
i tend to think that because the main difference between the prescott and other 800mhz p4s is the l2 cache and that it is an on-die cache, it should not require any special mainboard but...... i could be wrong.
also what types of uses is the 1meg l2 cache going to benefit the most?
