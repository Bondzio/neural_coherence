<s> I've had my PC for about a year and have used my poineer DVD-RW DVR-104 to create countless CD-Rs, but now I want to create a data DVD. </s>
<s> A bought a couple DVD-RWs but I can't figure out how to write on them. </s>
<s> I have downloaded 3 different programs (BurnRight!, Burn4Free, and Click n' Burn) but I can't get any of them to burn a DVD-RW for me. </s>
<s> Some tell me to insert a blank CD, others try to burn, then say that they have finished with errors. </s>
<s> What am I doing wrong? </s>
<s> Hey, I've never heard about these burning program. </s>
<s> I always use Nero Burning Rom 6.0. </s>
<s> It easily burns DVD or what ever you want. </s>
<s> So I think it better use tried software, as I'm not sure that your programs support burning on DVD-RW. </s>
<s> I just checked the writing speed on my pioneer DVR-104 and it says the max for DVD-RW's was 1x. </s>
<s> On the cover of the DVD case it says 2-4x, is that just the reading speek or is that also the write speed they are designed for? </s>
<s> Everything you need to know is here: PioneerElectronics.com According to this chart , it looks like the max DVD-RW write speed for the drive is 1x and you can use only 1x DVD-RW media. </s>
<s> However, there is a fimrware upgrade that will allow you to write at 1x speed on 2x DVD-RW media. </s>
<s> It could be the cause, but anyway you'd better to have good convenient and clear burning soft where you could check what speed supports you DVD-burner. </s>
<s> Also check DVD-RW speed: is it the same with burner? </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
