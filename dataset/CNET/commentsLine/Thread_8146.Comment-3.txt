greetings: a quick look at &quot;logmein&quot; appears to be a paid service.
not what i was looking for at all or any help at all.
(did not see any &quot;free &quot; options other than &quot;free trial&quot;=not free.)
i have a number of free vpn clients already and have a vpn router that i paid good $$ for.
i'm connecting via: laptop=&gt;cellphone=&gt;internet=&gt;befvp41=&gt;lan
