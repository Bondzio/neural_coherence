<s> So what I want to know is will the duplicator I am looking at (Startech.com USB to IDE SATA Standalone Hard Drive Duplicator http://www.rakuten.com/prod/startech-com-usb-to-ide-sata-standalone-hard-drive-duplicator-dock/213024954.html ) duplicate my hardrive to another hardrive, then let me plug in the new hardrive and have it run like nothing ever happened. </s>
<s> That would mean duplicating the operating system and all other programs. </s>
<s> Help appreciated. </s>
<s> I've been using Norton Ghost since 2004 for this purpose. </s>
<s> I do a system backup to an external hard drive, install the new drive, restore from the external hard drive; and it's always worked for me. </s>
<s> This gives you the added protection of an external backup you can use to retrieve any of your files if needed. </s>
<s> Once you create a copy ... what else will you use the duplicator for ? </s>
<s> I'd go for a software solution as it has more flexibility in terms of backup/imaging and there's no warranty to expire or duplicator parts to lose. </s>
<s> Must be a fairly new product as it's the first time I've seen it.....and didn't find an reviews on Newegg either. </s>
<s> I use ACRONIS True Image as it will duplicate a drive as well as create images of it as is now or next week or the week after. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Can't imagine why I'd need this device. </s>
<s> So Ghost backs up every thing, operating system, programs, settings for those programs and all. </s>
<s> Bit for bit. </s>
<s> And the bios automatically recognizes the new drive? </s>
