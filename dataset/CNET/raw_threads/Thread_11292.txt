I replaced it with a new one and now while im booting up with the OS X cd for OS installation, it wont look at the HD to install the OS on. So I went to disk utility and it recognizes the HD but for some reason the HD will not show up for me to select it during OS installation. Do I need to go threw an initiallization process to get the HD to show up for that?

Find your drive and Initialize it as HFS+(Journaled) . You may see it marked as HFS Extended(Journaled) They are both the same. Once you have done that, quit from DU and all should be well. You may have to reboot before the installer sees the results of your labor. Good Luck P

Then go ahead and install OS X again. What you have there is a hodge podge of stuff that is not working well together. P

His disk was not initialized and therefore did not have a volume on which to install. P

Do you still have the disks that came with your machine? 3. Do you have a backup of all the stuff that you cannot bear to lose? This does NOT include programs that came with the computer and programs that you have installed since. WIth the answers to the above, we can move along P

Restart the computer and hold down the &quot;C&quot; key until the spinning gear appears Once the installer starts, go to the Menu bar and select Disk Utility. Initialize the drive as HFS+(journaled) or Mac OS Extended (Journaled), whichever is the choice Once you have done that, quit Disk Utility. Reboot the machine, again holding down the &quot;C&quot; key and let the installer continue to run. Check the &quot;Customize&quot;/&quot;Options&quot; at each step and remove ALL the languages that you do not need. Let the installer finish and you should have a fully working version of OS X (whatever version you have) Don't forget to update the OS once you are connected to the Internet Good Luck, Let us know how you get on P

The only thing that should be connected to your Mac is your keyboard and mouse. No internet; no printers; no blue-tooth; no external hard drives; no modems; no cameras; no iPods or MP3's; absolutely NOTHING!! Just do as mrmacfixit just said. You mentioned that you are running -or want to run- OS 10.1.4 on a iMac dual processor. If that's correct, then it's not going to work, period. As stated, use ONLY the disks that came with the machine FIRST. Don't do anything fancy like you said earlier -free BSD, connecting to the net, etc.- just be sure you have your mouse and keyboard plugged in and you are using THE ORIGINAL DISK (grey in colour) that came with THAT Mac. Sorry to get on your case but as to what I can remember and to what I see, when I mounted XP and then Vista, it requested that you had an internet connection. That's a Windows thing; not Macs. If you use Windows methods, you'll develop grey hairs and wrinkles and probably go bald.
2691	12	304654	2835941	2835771	mrmacfixit	8/17/08 7:43 AM	1.21895898E12	No Internet connection needed.	As mentioned by Ricato, you don't need anything connected to your iMac. However, if it is still connected to the internet, that's not a problem. On completion of the install, OS X will be able to configure your Network preferences if the ethernet cable is plugged in. On the subject of the version of OS X you are planning on installing. You mentioned 10.1.4 in one of your posts. I missed that but assumed that you meant 10.4.x. This is important as 10.1.4 does not run on an Intel Mac and it you have an iMac with a dual processor so it must be an Intel powered iMac. I suggest that your OS is 10.4.x A look at the disks that came with the machine, you do have those?, will tell you what version of the OS they hold. Any &quot;backup&quot; that is &quot;internalized&quot; is NOT a backup. It is a disaster waiting to happen. For instance: You make a backup of essential data to ensure that in the event of a HD failure, you will be able to replace the drive, install the OS and restore all your missing data. Backing up to the ONLY drive in that machine means that when the HD fails, ALL your essential data goes with it. Note that I said WHEN you hard drive fails, there is not IF. Transfer ALL your essential data, pictures, documents, tunes, etc. to DVD's or CD's Before you start this process. ALL your data is about to be destroyed and wiped off the face of the HD. Do not bother transferring any of your programs (applications) to DVD/CD, as you will be able to reinstall these once the OS is installed. Of course, all the software that came with the machine will be replaced by the Restore process. Let us know when you have done the backup and have the disks that came with the computer, in hand. P

2691	14	304654	2836538	2836449	mrmacfixit	8/18/08 4:58 AM	1.21903548E12	Burning disks	Make a folder on the desktop. Put all the files you want to save in that folder be careful with he Address book, dragging the application to that folder will not save your addresses. Export the addresses from Address book as an Address Book Archive. Check the the menu under File. When you have all the files you need in the folder, put a NEW BLANK DVD into the drive. When it mounts on the desktop, drag that folder to the disk. Eject the disk. When asked if you want to burn the disk, say yes. Caution. When burning from the Finder, you only get one burn per disk. So a disk with a 1k file on it is rendered completely FULL after burning. You MUST burn everything at once P

Thanks for taking the time to explain all this to me.I have 5 discs with virtually nothing on them because I thought I knew what I was doing.I just was baffled that the computer wouldn't reload a disc with almost nothing on it.That would be something for someone to work out a program to fix.I think I should be able to get along from now on.I will keep you updated on my progress and will ask when I hit the next snag.I have apple service but I find your explanations much easier to follow.They just seem to read back what's in the manual,which is how I got here in the first place.I'll pick up some new discs tomorrow and do it properly one time.I'll get back as soon as it's done or I hit my next snag,whichever comes first.

Toast is the disk burning software of choice for the Mac. It does all sorts of things and is much more flexible that burning from the Finder. P
