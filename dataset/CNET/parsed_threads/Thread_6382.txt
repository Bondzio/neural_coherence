<s> Just need a hint here. </s>
<s> We're setting up a Lacie 1TB &quot;Etherdisk&quot; NAS drive. </s>
<s> It uses embedded XP. </s>
<s> I've created several shares and users. </s>
<s> I can map a share to a designated user's PC and set up an account on it which will easily access that share on the NAS. </s>
<s> I can also browse with explorer to the share and connect. </s>
<s> The drive allows several protocols including http and ftp. </s>
<s> I've configured some of the shares with http as well with the intention of allowing teachers to access their personal shares from home. </s>
<s> We've had the NAS drive linked for remote access. </s>
<s> The problem we are having is that none of the shares allow access using http from either the local network or remotely unless I add &quot;Everyone&quot; to the permissions for that share. </s>
<s> The same PCs (All XP Pro) with the appropriate account logged on will access the share just fine by browsing to it through the network but we get &quot;permission denied&quot; if switching to a web browser (Firefox or IE7) using http. </s>
<s> I've contacted Lacie support for this and a couple other issues but this one they could not address by offering any advice other than to try connecting the NAS to a monitor, mouse and keyboard and attempting to set up the shares a different way. </s>
<s> To me that makes no sense because that's what remote admin is for. </s>
<s> Surely I'm missing something simple here. </s>
<s> Any thoughts would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The ZONE that IE put that drive in may be at fault. </s>
<s> Or your firewall. </s>
<s> The router in the school is handled remotely by IT personnel with school administration. </s>
<s> They had to open up something to get this out on the web, link it for me and give me an IP address to put in a browser for remote access. </s>
<s> But, would this explain why I can't use http from the local network...inside the school itself? </s>
<s> I can't see how it's firewall could have an effect. </s>
<s> As well, I can't figure how adding &quot;everyone&quot; to the share suddenly makes it accessible from either direction. </s>
<s> Hope this makes sense. </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick comeback. </s>
<s> http has no user authentication so for it to work you would have to allow an user to access the file system. </s>
<s> Not that I know your lacie that well but for http to work, ask what account needs to allow file access. </s>
<s> I can enable that and see if TPTB at school headquarters can port us through. </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
