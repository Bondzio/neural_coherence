<s> How many emails can a 16 GB Flash Drive hold ??? </s>
<s> 5000 emails ? </s>
<s> 7500 emails ? </s>
<s> 10,000 emails ? </s>
<s> (assuming about 2 pages per email, no video, no movies) Thank You !! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> The 2 page text email is about 60 characters per line of 50 lines, so that's 3,000 bytes per page or 6K for 2 pages. </s>
<s> Now let's bump that up to 10K to allow for overhead and make the calculation easy. </s>
<s> 16 GB is 16,000,000,000 and 10K is 10,000, so now we can just knock 4 zeros of that 16 GB and get 1,600,000 emails. </s>
<s> Is that enough for you? </s>
<s> Thank you, wpgwpg !!! </s>
<s> I guess the 16 is adequate...thanks for doing the 'quick math'....couldn't find that answer anywhere.... Is it easy to do ??? </s>
<s> Is there are 'step-by-step' directions somewhere on how to transfer all those emails in one 'block' or 2 or 3... </s>
<s> ??? </s>
<s> (hopefully - not 1 by 1) Where could I find those directions ? </s>
<s> ?/ </s>
<s> I'm afraid the procedure for exporting your email depends on what you're using for email. </s>
<s> And you've neglected to mention that little detail. </s>
<s> The key word though is EXPORT. </s>
<s> E.g. </s>
<s> with Windows Live Mail, you click the xxxxxx and click export email. </s>
<s> Point it at an empty folder and it'll put all of them in that folder. </s>
<s> Each one is a separate file, but you can put them in a single zipped file and take advantage of compression at the same time. </s>
<s> ...Email type: Plain old AOL email. </s>
