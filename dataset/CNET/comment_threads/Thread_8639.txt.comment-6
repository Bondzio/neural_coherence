Another hard disk in an USB enclosure is now under 99 bucks.
This could be what you clone your one and only copy to.
Then operate on the clone.
-&gt; Maybe I was unclear that more hardware may be needed but you are taking a wreckless approach to recovery without this copy and clone method.
Test disk may or may not work.
It may make it worse.
Sorry if I was unclear here.
