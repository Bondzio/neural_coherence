Four pieces plus a beep.
But first, imagine if everyone used your Subject title.
Take a moment to craft something more like... Changed the power supply and it still doesn't (something.)
In fact, I can't tell if it turns on or not.
My definition of &quot;on&quot; here is fans spinning.
Not that windows works (or linux.)
So given so little words, you could try just the PSU, motherboard, Speaker and the CPU+HeatSinkFan and see if it will power up and beep.
If not, you are looking at the four possible bad parts.
