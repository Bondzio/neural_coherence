1.1.1	So basically i got a job as an IT this summer to get some money so i can build myself a nicer computer.	St
1.1.2	I did some planning and came up with what i think is a nice system.	St
1.1.3	If you have any suggestions/changes/experiences please post.	Ques
1.1.4	Here's what im looking at getting: AMD Athlon 64 FX-57 1024 MB Corsair TwinX DDR400 ASUS A8N-SLI Deluxe 2 x 250 GB Western Digital SATAII, RAID0 2 x Gigabyte 7800 GTX Liteon 16X16 Double Layer DVD+/RW Soundblaster Audigy 2 ZS Gamer Cooler Master Centurion 5 Case Enermax 600 Watt SLI-Ready PSU It adds up to like $4000, so i wanna make sure there isnt anything im missing... Zalman Silent Cooler (92mm)	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	i'd say get different RAM leave that mobo just as it is, the Asus one includes audio diagnostics and a far more detailed manual compared to the DFI DFI is also notorious for poor QA (their only an option for extreme tweaking basically) i'd consider possibly a better case (don't quite know it's cooling specifics off the top of my head)	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Get 2gb of ram instead.	St
1.6.2	the industry standard for ram is slowly turning from 512 to 1gb if it hasnt already happen.	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	More than 1GB may help some developers, high end video editing, and high end graphic design/development, but in gaming, 2GB is just for chest beating, bragging, & show, or to make their PC look/seem more powerful.	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	Yeah i think im good with one gig, the reason why is the latency...2-2-2-5 on the twinX's would be lowered if i added more.	St
1.10.2	And a good latency is one of the things you need for quality gaming.	St
1.10.3	On another note, i just saw the ''OC'' version of the 7800 GTX that runs at 460 MHz rather then 430..Is it worth it?	St
1.11.1	the measly oc is not worth the $$$	St
1.12.1	good latencies are needed for performance with AMD K7 systems with Intel and AMD K8 systems the latency doesn't matter as much as the bandwidth does in addition no, 2GB of RAM is not a good idea it's worthless also, the &quot;OC&quot; version your thinking of is the BFG it's their own version XFX's &quot;Max OC&quot; version clocks in at 490 it'd be worth the purchase if the RAM is the correct spec to do 1300MHZ (meaning a lower ns rating = it can clock higher) the thing to think about the 6800 Ultra Extreme Edition's were clocked faster yet usually overclocked to a lesser degree than 6800 Ultra's could i'd suggest a normal 7800GTX to save money mainly also QA = Quality Assurance	St
