<s> I have a five year old Medeon computer with P4 2.2ghz, 250w power supply. </s>
<s> The fan on the video card is making all kinds of noise and rather than replace the whole computer, I'd rather find a good replacement for the video card; however, I'm not find any replacements when I Google it. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of where to find these older generation cards and maybe even an upgrade to the one I have. </s>
<s> Any AGP based video card out there if new is going to be better than what you have now. </s>
<s> That's good news provided as you already know can find one. </s>
<s> Thus, it will be an upgraded version quite capable. </s>
<s> Start at these vendors, http://www.geeks.com http://www.newegg.com http://www.computergate.com and google others. </s>
<s> You can use the web search engines under google, etc. </s>
<s> by narrowing it down via the price searchers, like Newtag and Shopzilla, etc.. Of course, there is eBay, just be sure to check their reviews or credentials. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> They also make this card without a fan. </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> Replace the fan. </s>
<s> I used this with a little work to drill the holes to match my old card -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CH-RD&cat=FAN 2. </s>
<s> Shop for the fx6200 or fx7200 card for the slot type you have. </s>
<s> The power requirement for this card is on the low side. </s>

<s> I should have mentioned, if your video card fan is the typical square looking type, its possible to replace. </s>
<s> Your fan size maybe 40mm or 50mm and RadioSmack does have new ones for sale. </s>
<s> Provided you can remove the fan, thus replace to include any wire splicing, yada, yada. </s>
<s> If removable, take to RadioSmack or a decent local computer shop for the replacement match-up. </s>
<s> Far cheaper than another video card. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
