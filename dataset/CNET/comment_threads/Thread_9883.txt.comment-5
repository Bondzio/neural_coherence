I can only afford so much as a realtor dying in this market; but this would be the only thing I would buy/use.
It's a sort of two in one: it's for backup and if my computer fails/crashes, as I said this is a drive I could use...I'm told it would be copied exactly as the one I'd be copying from.
I'm not worried about other elements for I work at home mostly using the laptop where it's safer conditions.
I'm really a novice with most of the technology and need all the advice I can get.
I found out today I can purchase the ABS 100GB for my 80GB LAPTOP at $187...no tax, no shipping and hopefully no headaches.
Is this a fair purchase WITH my circumstances?...like I said I wondered about other one's like La Cie and one that starts with a Western...sorry cannot think of the name; there are others but too much technology is confusing me.
I need baby steps!
