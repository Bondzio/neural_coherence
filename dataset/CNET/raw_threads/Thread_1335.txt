I was looking to put a Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-2250 into the PC but I don't know if it will work. I have Comcast cable and though one box is a DVR the other is not. While researching I've come across the fast that Comcast may or may not broadcast in clear Qam. Though I have some idea, I guess I would like someone to clear all of this up. I usually put mid level gaming rigs together and have never done anything with a TV tuner in it. Any help would be appreciated. More about : turning htpc
