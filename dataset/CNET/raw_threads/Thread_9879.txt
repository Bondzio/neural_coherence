13473	0	291390	2750962	NR	Arcelios	4/13/08 3:52 PM	1.20810192E12	Compatible RAM?	I am running a Dell Dimension DIM4600 with an Intel Pentium 4 CPU (2.66GHz), 512MB of RAM, and Windows XP Home Edition SP2. I am looking into upgrading my RAM, so the system will run a bit faster, and for gaming purposes, but I don't know what RAM is compatible and what RAM isn't. I want to upgrade to either 2GB or 4GB of RAM. I was wondering if there is a website I can look at that will tell me what is compatible, and what isn't? Thanks, Arcelios P.S.: It would be very ideal if I could find something...less than expensive.
