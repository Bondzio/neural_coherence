<s> I recently bought a notebook from HP with 512MB ram. </s>
<s> What I am confused is the Setup shows 384MB of system memory and video memory as 128 MB. </s>
<s> Similarly, Task manager on windows XP OS shows total physical memory as 384MB. </s>
<s> Called up HP support, they said that video memory is taking 128 MB out of 512 MB thats why my system memory is 384 MB. </s>
<s> Is tha true? </s>
<s> Is it not that video cards( ATI Radeon 9000) shoud have its own 128 mb memory and my system should be having 512 MB separately. </s>
<s> I just want to make sure that I am not cheated. </s>
<s> Help me out you experts...... </s>
<s> This is pretty normal for a system with integrated video. </s>
<s> You want more memory for programs you can buy more and add it to the system, there is probably a second free memory slot to do this. </s>
<s> You didn't get cheated, that's how it works. </s>
<s> When it comes to notebooks, shared resources especially ram is a given. </s>
<s> The video taking from the base ram and providing the resources it needs. </s>
<s> While some video ram can come strictly for itself on its own, more often than not it uses whatever the system memory provides. </s>
<s> Check to see if you can tailor the video ram to a lesser amount using some ulitity pgm. </s>
<s> or onboard bios setting. </s>
<s> The only other option is to upgrade the system ram even more if capable to increase overall system memory. </s>
<s> There are very few notebooks where the video ram itself is a separte item any more. </s>
<s> Check your model's specs at HP support website, they provide that, surf there. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> There is a setting in your video properties where you can select how much RAM is allocated to video depending on the PC. </s>
<s> You might right click the desktop, Properties, Settings tab, Advanced. </s>
<s> This will get you into your video card/drivers and you should be able to change the amount of RAM used. </s>
<s> You damn sure don't need 128 Meg of RAM for a laptop screen. </s>
<s> A lot of notebooks have shared video memory, i dont think theres much that anyone can do about it...:( </s>
