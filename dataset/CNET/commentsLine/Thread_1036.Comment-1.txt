i have been using an external hard drive as my main storage device and keeping the internal for vista.
last week the ext.
started losing connection to my pc and eventually dropped out completely at the weekend.
i've tried updating the drivers, a different usb port and a different usb cable and had no luck.
today i dismantled the ext.
case and connected the hdd unit with a sata cable.
when i turn on the pc and go into setup the pc lists sata 1 ide wd160 bladdy blah (the internal vista runs on), sata 3 ide wd500 etc.
(the ex-external)and sata 2 which is the dvd-rom and has nothing to do with anything really.
but if i skip the setup stage i get the message 'primary slave hard disk error'.
i know that the old ide drives could be set as master and slave by changing the jumpers and sata drives don't have this.
but i can't get the second drive to work and really need help.
what am i doing wrong?
