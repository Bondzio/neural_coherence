given that it's a three-year-old sam's club special and that i wanted to replace the crt with a flat panel anyway, and that it has some other annoying quirks, i think i'll just get a new one.
(not from sam's!)
i may be able to plug the hard drive into the new machine, but that's not a critical issue.
