someone checked out their recycling plan a while back ad t6hey found all the returned carts in the everyday trash in the pacages they were mailed back in.
maybe they changed their practice since then ,i hope so.i dont get the attitude,and why ?
i'm just a poor slob trying to gt by in life without getting burned especialy by some huge corperation that in practice does the same thing as i do but worse they sell a product designed to rip off their customers .but like u said now i wait for the hand of doom to fall all becauce of the wrong ink .
thanx for trying to help really rj
