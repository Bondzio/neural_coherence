I was thinking of purchasing the WD My Passport Hard Drive 250GB which is only $29.99 at Target and was wondering how reliable they are compared to the Free Agent drives. I know that it's has a slower speed but I like the fact that it's USB powered vice A/C/ and is extremely small. I'm just going to be using this as a backup for my MP3 files. Also, if someone knows of another good USB powered hard drive please let me know.
