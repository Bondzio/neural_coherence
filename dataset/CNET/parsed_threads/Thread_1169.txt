<s> pc wont come on light on the front does but then nothing, have changed the psu aswell and still nothing dont even hear the fan starting it was ok 3 days ago then we moved house now nothing can any one help, its a emachine 420 </s>
<s> Disconnect the hard drive, and try again. </s>
<s> You should at least get a BIOS screen. </s>
<s> If that's been done, it's time to take it to professional help. </s>
<s> something vibrated loose from the move. </s>
<s> Take the cover off and make certain everything is plugged in properly. </s>
<s> thanks for the repy but have tryed all that and put different leads ect on aswell and still no luck </s>
<s> Maybe when you moved it, the button got disconnected from the motherboard. </s>
<s> You should find the chord (usually connected to the front usb) and follow it to the motherboard. </s>
<s> Make sure it is connected. </s>
<s> &quot;&quot;pc wont come on light on the front does but then nothing, have changed the psu aswell and still nothing dont even hear the fan starting &quot;&quot; What light comes on?? </s>
<s> The Power LED?? </s>
<s> If so that means that you have 5 volts at least. </s>
<s> Are symptoms before changing PSU identical or did some of them change??? </s>
<s> What fan is it that you don't hear starting?? </s>
<s> Was the second PSU a new unit of same or higher wattage, or an old one that you had laying around?? </s>
<s> Do you know how to turn the PSU by itself? </s>
<s> try reseating the memory </s>
<s> yes its the power led, symptoms are the same and yes it was a new psuand same wattage aswell as the old one its 340wts, and no i dont no how to turn the psu by itself, thank you for the reply can you help any further pls </s>
<s> yes i have looked at that and all things are conected properly </s>
<s> how do i reseating the memory pls </s>
<s> you said that you tried replugging everything. </s>
<s> The memory sticks [or stick] should have been one of the items. </s>
<s> The memory sticks are held in by a plastic tab at each end of the stick. </s>
<s> One lifts up the tabs which then allows the memory stick to be unplugged. </s>
<s> Just remove them and plug them back in FIRMLY and then lock the tabs down again. </s>
<s> Did you replug the video card in?? </s>
<s> If you want to test the power supply by itself [probably not needed if you tried two different ones], plug it in to a wall outlet [a hot one LOL] and with the supply connectors not plugged into the computer. </s>
<s> On the 20 pin [24 pin on newer computers]connector find the green wire, use a small piece of wire to connect the green wire to any one of the black wires. </s>
<s> As long as the connection is made the supply will turn on and stay on as noted by its fan rotating. </s>
<s> The Molex connectors are a sloppy fit so with a fine piece of wire one can usually make the connection from the rear of the connector. </s>
<s> It is simply a logic connection so there is no voltage that you can feel. </s>
<s> i have even done a bench test now and still nothing, my mp3 player charges though when i plug it in to a usb port </s>
<s> thanks for replying but we have tryed that aswell and still nothing </s>
<s> have 5 volts. </s>
<s> Does the hard drive rotate? </s>
<s> The newer mobos provide power to the CPU via the 12 volt line [at one time they used the 5 volt line]. </s>
<s> If you have the 5 volts and no fans or anything running you then have no 12 volts, which depending on your computer mobo may mean that the CPU also doesn't get power. </s>
<s> For this to happen on two power supplies is hard to understand for me, although in the last month or so in these forums I have seen others with that problem. </s>
<s> Wonder if they were all eMachines. </s>
<s> Normally if the CPU were shorted and overloaded the supply, all the main voltages would shut down automatically. </s>
<s> Possibly your power supply only shuts down the voltage main that is overloaded. </s>
<s> I don't think that I can offer much help. </s>
<s> At this point AFTER you go back and make certain that you replug everything in, the only thing left is remove/replace trouble shooting. </s>
<s> Doesn't sound too good for the CPU. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> You wouldn't be the first in these forums that found the PC suddenly working after rechecking all connections for the third time. </s>
<s> no the hard drive dont rotate, im totally lost with it now thanks any way </s>
