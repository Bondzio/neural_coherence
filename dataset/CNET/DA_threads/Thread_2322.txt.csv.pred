1.1.3	Its about 200 dollars over my target of a Grand and thats before software .	St
1.1.4	I could live with it but if you guys see any changes I could make for less money and relatively the same performance .	St
1.1.5	THanks in advance you guys have been rad	St
1.2.1	My only question is why buy an SLI mobo with a PSU and VidCard that wo n't support it ?	Ques
1.2.2	I know value is good and it 's a good compromise if you plan to go that route in the future .	St
1.2.3	My philosophy is top-of-the-line or bottom , I would get an even cheaper Vid if it 's only a temporary card .	St
1.2.4	Good components all around should be a solid rig but no chest hair ... yet	St
1.3.1	Yeah I know it wasnt the best choice for a mobo with the bugdet and other gear i have listed .	St
1.3.2	The graphics card isnt necessarily temporary as im hoping this comp will last me these next 3 years of college .	St
1.3.3	I need it for CS : S n stuff .	St
1.3.4	im majoring in pre-engineering physics since EE was impacted so I might need it for any kind of programs we will use but at the same time i dont ant to go over a grand .	St
1.3.5	if you have any suggestions for a mobo that isnt SLI and a vid card that isnt as quick but plays what i need decently let me know..and work with the parts I already have .	St
1.3.6	thanks	Polite
1.4.1	& quot ; My only question is why buy an SLI mobo with a PSU and VidCard that wo n't support it ? & quot ; why wouldnt you want an sli mobo ? ? ?	Ques
1.4.2	HE IS READY FOR THE FUTURE , your video card is fine , all you need to do is buy another and a bridge chip when you think your machine needs a good upgrade .	St
1.4.3	keep the sli mobo .	St
1.4.4	good ram , cpu , hdd , vid card - although the 6800 series will fall in price over the next weeks and months .	St
1.4.5	SUPERB choice on your case and power supply .	St
1.4.6	i think that case is one of the best along with the p180 .	St
1.4.7	everything else is thumbs up be happy with your system konny	St
1.5.1	Looks pretty good .	Polite
1.5.2	My preference would be Western Digital or Seagate on the Hard Drives .	St
1.5.3	PS ... you gave wrong link ... should be : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp ? Submit=Go & DEPA=0 & type= & description=Maxtor+80GB & Category=15 & minPrice= & maxPrice= & Go.x=16 & Go.y=28 Did you read my post in the Desktop forum on the same subject : http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html ? forumID=68 & threadID=110207 & messageID=1259867	St
1.6.1	thanks for the help	Polite
1.7.1	All you need is the DVD burner , since it will do everything and save $ 22 .	St
1.7.2	You can add it later .	St
1.7.3	If you do get both , make the burner the primary .	St
1.7.4	Your link for the HD is a 200gb with a limit of one , but it is a good drive .	St
1.7.5	You could get one drive now and add the other one later .	Sug
1.7.6	Here is another HD option .	St
1.7.7	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16822144357 I assume that you are into gaming by the video card you choose .	St
1.7.8	If not you could save money there .	St
1.7.9	All in All a good system .	St
1.7.10	By droping the DVD ROM and the second HD will save $ 120 , and you can allwise add them later .	St
1.7.11	John	St
