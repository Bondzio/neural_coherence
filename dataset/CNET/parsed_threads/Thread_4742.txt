<s> Hello prospective helpers, I have a 512mb SandDisk Cruzer Mini USB drive that used to work perfectly fine until recently. </s>
<s> All of a sudden for no apparent reason my pc (XP SP2) is have trouble reading the usb drive and slows down the system in the process. </s>
<s> When I tried to access the usb drive in command prompt, after about 3 minutes I got the following error message: &quot;The volume does not contain a recognized file system. </s>
<s> Please make sure that all required file system drivers are loaded and that the volume is not corrupted.&quot; Then I went into &quot;Device Manager&quot; and saw the usb drive listed under &quot;Disk Drives&quot;. </s>
<s> Double clicking on it reveals that the &quot;Device Status&quot; is &quot;This device is working properly.&quot; So I believe the drivers are not the problem but somehow volume is corrupted. </s>
<s> Bottom line, I have very important files stored only on this USB which I need to retrieve before throwing the USB drive away. </s>
<s> I tried other USB drives on the same usb port and had no problems so it's not the usb port that has problems. </s>
<s> I also tried my faulty USB drive on other pc's and they all had trouble reading it. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> These things don't work forever but I find people lose a lot of time over what is now a 10 to 20 buck thing. </s>
<s> If you've gotten into the habit of simply plugging/unplugging after use w/o a proper dismount, you can corrupt the FAT. </s>
<s> The damage can also be due to &quot;static/ESD&quot; which can fry or damage the USB drive. </s>
<s> In either case, more than likely you can't recover if you've done a reformat and it doesn't take. </s>
<s> I had many drives just go &quot;poof&quot; as I and other users get a sudden loss of drive usage. </s>
<s> It happens and far better to move on. </s>
<s> You can try the HP USB drives tool(web search at HP) to see if it can be recovered or try another recovery tool, but usually the results are negative. </s>
