i am looking for a recommendation for a pci express or pci x sata raid controller card for a nonprofit group i am helping.
the received a brand new server but it only came with one 73gb scsi drive.
we want to run raid 1 and need at least 160 gb drives for storage/os.
i figured we could add in a sata controller card and get the drives for the price on one high capacity scsi drive.
so does anyone have a recommendation for a card/drive combination that is relatively fast but also affordable (around $400 or $500).
is having cache on the card really important?
thanks in advance.
