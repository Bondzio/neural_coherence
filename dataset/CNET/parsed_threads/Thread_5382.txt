<s> Hello all, Please, may someone know if a Mac does any change on HDD stow files? </s>
<s> I did lend my HDD to a friend and after that I can't access my files, every time I connect it to my PC it ask me to format and I can't access the files. </s>
<s> after try on few PC's with couple USB 3.0 cables another friend did connect it to his Mac and it could read all the files. </s>
<s> I don't know if the first guy to borrow it did connect it to a Mac or PC. </s>
<s> Any one saw it happen before ? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot, cheers </s>
<s> Your post didn't reveal if there were files to be saved but since we all have backups when we loan out a drive I'd just start over. </s>
