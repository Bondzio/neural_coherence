I have been reading many pages of the forum and it seems like everyone is having problems with the USB Ext hard drives.
I have a Dell desktop, 512mb mem, 40 gb hard drive that is full, and Win XP Pro.
Just wondering if anyone has had any luck buying and using a USB Ext hard drive on a system similar to mine.
Any answers appreciated.
