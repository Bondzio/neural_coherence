inexpensive tvs won't have the color range or accuracy of a good 22&quot; or 24&quot; monitor ($300 - $400).
they'll also have a lower resolution (1366x768 or 1280x720 vs 1680x1050 or 1920x1200).
if you'd also like to watch high def tv, consider this viewsonic with an hd tuner and high resolution:  choppy dvd playback could be due to a slow (by current standards) cpu.
most new video cards offer decoding assist to help the cpu so they may help you in that respect.
