windows 98 se, hp pavilion.
i added a hard drive yesterday, and it shows up and everything works fine as long as i go into the bios when i start it up.
if i don't go into the bios, (i don't even have to do anything in there, i just go into it, and exit, and the 2nd hard drive works 100%) then the hard drive won't show up in my computer, and it shows up in control panel under add new hardware that my 2nd hard &quot;this device is either not present, not working correctly, or does not have all the drivers installed properly.
(code 10) what am i doing wrong, i know its probably something dumb.
