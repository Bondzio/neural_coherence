I've been doing fine with my laptop to router signal for the most part. However, every now and then, about every 4 or 5 days, I may loose connection for some reason. I have found that the easiest way to fix the issue, is unplug the router, take a bathroom break and voila. Should I be worried about any long term affects from doing this? I have a dlink WBR1310. Settings are on TKIP, PSK, WPA Enhanced. Any comment or feedback appreciated.

The sticky post about it is the one about Vista machines that have trouble connecting to routers but you can just google up VISTA BROADCAST FLAG to decide what you want to do about that. Here I just disable it to avoid the issue. Bob
