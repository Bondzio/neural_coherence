<s> Does anyone know a site that can tell me how to set up a wireless network with two different operating systems? </s>
<s> Please be specific, give a link or something, don't just say look around CNET. </s>
<s> http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3111111 For example, here is a Linux based WAP. </s>
<s> Since Windows is covered widely I didn't supply a link. </s>
<s> there are many (too many) articles about this. </s>
<s> The killer item however is that in Linux, many fail to research if there is support for their card. </s>
<s> That tends to be the issue Bob </s>
<s> Thanks fo the link, but what I need is a good thoruogh, informative link for networking for Windows. </s>
<s> All of the sites I have seen so far have only talked about networking with XP. </s>
<s> I'm trying to network two computers. </s>
<s> One has Windwos 2000 and one has XP. </s>
<s> You don't have a WAP. </s>
<s> Yes this is rarely covered but you missed it since it's called by another name. </s>
<s> -&gt; It's called ADHOC networking. </s>
<s> I never had to consult any documentation to set that up. </s>
<s> I set the adapters to ADHOC mode and waited. </s>
<s> Too easy and maybe why it's not covered widely. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If WAP is a wireless access point, I have a wireless router (D-Link DI-624). </s>
<s> THe router is wired to the DSL Modem and my PC. </s>
<s> My laptop has an ATHEROS AR5001X+ Wireless Network Adapter. </s>
<s> The problem is that, on both the PC and the laptop, when I try to dial into the internet, Enternet says there was no response from the remote computer. </s>
<s> As well, although I'm pretty sure the computers are connected I can't get them to share printers or files. </s>
<s> Eveything I've read on networking so far has either been for Windows 98 or XP, never for 2000. </s>
<s> I'm sure it will be pretty easy to enable file and printer sharing,but my bigger problem is the internet. </s>
<s> If know a way to fix this let me know, but if you know any good sites that could help, that would be fine. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Why are you doling out the details? </s>
<s> I've guessed wrong 2 times now and given your useless information. </s>
<s> Sorry about that, but it could explain why you are finding it difficult to find help. </s>
<s> In closing, it seems you have a normal setup. </s>
<s> In that case just read what came with the router. </s>
<s> Nothing is out of the ordinary so I bid you well and write that your setup has thousands of web sites of help. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> All I want is a good site. </s>
<s> If there are thousands of sites that address my issue, can't you give me a one or two? </s>
<s> I haven't found any for networking Windows 2000 to XP. </s>
<s> 99.99% of the time set the TCPIP settings in XP and 2000 to DHCP then plug them into the DLINK router. </s>
<s> Bingo. </s>
<s> They are now networked. </s>
<s> You have yet to reveal what networking feature is not working or if you can't share files or more. </s>
<s> I can't guess what step is eluding you. </s>
<s> You may have done something like installed a FIREWALL and didn't allow filesharing, but this is yet to be revealed. </s>
<s> Please take time to tell more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> http://support.dlink.com/products/view.asp?productid=DI-624 and click on the product manual link. </s>
<s> Follow the directions. </s>
<s> So far, nothing shared here reveals anything other than a stock setup. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> My problems are that I can't connect to my DSL connection, I might be picking up the neighbours broadband connection and I can't file and print share. </s>
<s> As well, when I created a netsetup file (with the Network Setup Wizard) on my Windows XP Laptop my Windows 2000 computer told me that netsetup was not compatible with Windows 2000. </s>
<s> However, I finally got Windows XP so I'm going to install that and then reset the router. </s>
<s> Hopefully then I will be able to set up the network. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help anyways. </s>
