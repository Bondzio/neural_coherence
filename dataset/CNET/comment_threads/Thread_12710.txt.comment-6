I have the exact same problem.
Nobody seems to have any answers.
I can boot the system with a DOS floppy disk just fine.
But once I'm in XP (Home Edition), I get &quot;The system cannot find the drive specified&quot;.
I have tried *everything* (except doing a complete re-format and re-install of the OS, which I don't want to do).
I'm at Service Pack 2, but this problem started a couple months before I installed SP2.
