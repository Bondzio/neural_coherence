<s> I am looking for a recommendation for a PCI express or PCI x SATA Raid controller card for a nonprofit group I am helping. </s>
<s> The received a brand new server but it only came with one 73GB SCSI drive. </s>
<s> We want to run RAID 1 and need at least 160 GB drives for storage/OS. </s>
<s> I figured we could add in a SATA controller card and get the drives for the price on one high capacity SCSI drive. </s>
<s> So does anyone have a recommendation for a card/drive combination that is relatively fast but also affordable (around $400 or $500). </s>
<s> Is having cache on the card really important? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> RAID 1 provided one &quot;save&quot; over the past 2 decades of my work in the field. </s>
<s> Not only that but the strain of installing said unit on a SCSI based &quot;Windows?&quot; server usually outstrips most IT staffers. </s>
<s> If a backup is required try something simpler like a copy off to some NAS with Acronis. </s>
<s> I've see that survice lightning strikes and theft of the server. </s>
<s> If you insist there is something you should know. </s>
<s> Said controllers are a commodity item unless you look to Adaptec. </s>
<s> Example at http://www.adaptec.com/en-US/products/sata_prod/ Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for this opinion. </s>
<s> I always wondered how often RAID 1 actually saves the day. </s>
<s> Either way, IF we were to still go this route, you would recommend an adaptec card? </s>
<s> At the very least we need an inexpensive, decent speed, high capacity solution. </s>
<s> And this 73 GB SCSI drive is not going to cut it. </s>
<s> Do you have an adaptec card in mind that would work well? </s>
<s> Do we need cache on the card? </s>
<s> BTW, this will be an Win SBS 2003 environment with 25 users (not running Exchange). </s>
<s> That the ethernet is only 100 meagerbits per second (typo intentional) whereas the SATA rate is far beyond that. </s>
<s> There is no speed issue here. </s>
<s> As to the specific card, you note &quot;inexpensive&quot; yet this sounds mission critical. </s>
<s> Sorry to read that. </s>
<s> -&gt; Let me be blunt. </s>
<s> You can fit a 10 buck SATA card and move on or spend time to research the better adapatecs. </s>
<s> How are they better? </s>
<s> Support and features. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> first, are you totally against mirroring your scsi drive? </s>
<s> depending on the type, an extra scsi drive could only be about $200 (fujitsu 74gb 10k rpm). </s>
<s> windows server can manage the mirror for you even if you don't have a hardware raid controller. </s>
<s> as for a sata raid controller, tomshardware recently ran a roundup (sans any adaptec since they don't have any pci-express raid cards): http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/12/13/pci-express-sata-raid-controllers-for-smb-servers/ i wouldn't use any standard pci raid controller in a server nowadays since drives are fast enough to exceed the bus limits... stick with 66mhz pci, pci-x or pci-express. </s>
<s> i've had good experience with highpoint's rocketraid line but if you need tech support, lsi logic would be a better (but more expensive) choice. </s>
<s> rocketraid 2310 ($140, pci-express x4, software raid): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16816115027 lsi logic SAS/SATA ($210, pci-express x4, hardware raid) *my recommendation*: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16816118058 if you get a sata controller, i strongly recommend you install it in a test server/pc first. </s>
