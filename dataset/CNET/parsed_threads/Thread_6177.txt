<s> Are you buying a tablet this year? </s>
<s> -- Yes. </s>
<s> (Which one and why that one in particular?) </s>
<s> -- Maybe. </s>
<s> (What's holding you back?) </s>
<s> -- No. </s>
<s> (Why not?) </s>
<s> -- I already own one. </s>
<s> (Are you enjoying it?) </s>
<s> I broke down and bought an iPad 2 and must say it is much easier to use in bed than a laptop or netbook, both of which get hot fast. </s>
<s> I found a really nice app that lets me set a timer to go to sleep go my own playlist. </s>
<s> I also enjoy the Netflix app. </s>
<s> If some other show preempts re-runs of &quot;The Office,&quot; I can watch them or other tv shows on my iPad. </s>
<s> I also have an alarm clock app that has come in handy when the electricity goes out. </s>
<s> I still use a laptop during the day when I am home, but my iPad 2 is my new best bedtime and traveling buddy! </s>
<s> &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(66, 66, 68); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; &quot;&gt;I already have an iPad 2, and really love it. </s>
<s> There's nothing I can't do on it, I can create documents with iWork, diagrams with Omnigraffle, manage my data with FileMaker, entertain my self with Netflix and all the great games, and so much more. </s>
<s> I have been tempted to get an Android tablet lately, mainly because I would like to learn more about the development environment, and also because they come in smaller sizes. </s>
<s> If I end up getting one, I'm going to wait for the Sony Tablet P - mainly because the compact design looks cool and I really need mobile broadband on a tablet for on the go. </s>
<s> I bought an Acer Iconia A500 about a month ago and love it. </s>
<s> Rick Broida had a post that Staples was offering a $100 off coupon on any tablet and he specifically mentioned the Acer Iconia had been reduced from $449 to $399. </s>
<s> Went to Staples and purchased the Iconia for $299. </s>
<s> Took it home, charged it, turned it on and it immediately offered a free upgrade to 3.2 from Android 3.1. </s>
<s> Response time is excellent on my wi-fi and in general love its speed, sound and vivid screen. </s>
<s> It is a great supplement to my pc and I hardly use my laptop anymore. </s>
<s> The only shortcoming in my opinion is that when I move away from a network I do not have GPS coverage. </s>
<s> (Just a note that I am a 76 year old retired semi-techie -yes we do exist.) </s>
<s> I'm not because: 1-I have an HTC android phone (with a 32 Gb. </s>
<s> micro SD card) that does all the same as the tables (only with a little smaller screen), email, casual web surf, logmein, social networking, HD 720 P video, 8 Mp. </s>
<s> photos, music, Pandora, Skype, GPS, etc. </s>
<s> (i pay it $ 20.00 with a 2 year ATT plan) 2-For other mobility advanced task (that tablets or phones CAN'T do) I have a very comfortable dual core 6 Gb.ram 500 Gb Hard drive laptop. </s>
<s> ($ 450 HP Pro book) 3-For heavy work I have a 6 core 8 Gb 1,5 Tb, blue ray, 22' monitor etc... desktop PC. </s>
<s> (Clone PC around $ 1000.00, including windows 7 ultimate, build by me) And I don't like to carry out a (BIG) thing all the time like a tablet, because it doesn't replace the phone, and does almost the same.. </s>
<s> So have in mind your needs before spend $ 200 to $ 600 in a tablet. </s>
<s> A tablet is a nice-to-have, not a need-to-have, at least for me; but I have to admit that when I saw the iPad, my first thought was, &quot;I want one of those!&quot;. </s>
<s> For now, though, I'll wait. </s>
<s> And it will most likely be either an iPad (3, I hope) or a Samsung Galaxy Tab, which might be a better companion for the Android phone I'm also planning to buy. </s>
<s> I guess that's going to take quite a few pennies. </s>
<s> So why am I already scoping out accessories for the durn thing? </s>
<s> Right now, the novelty of tablets are driving the price. </s>
<s> I know that there are better processors coming down the pike and would rather wait. </s>
<s> I will pay five hundred dollars for a quad-core tablet; not a dual-core 1ghz. </s>
<s> I would rather buy a laptop than put up with that kind of performance. </s>
<s> Then, I want my tablet dual booted with windows 8 and android 4. </s>
<s> Peace TeraNeter </s>
<s> I find no need to run out and buy the latest whiz-bang which will be obsolete by the end of the year due to some new whiz-bang. </s>
<s> Don't need a tablet, smart phone, nor any of the other gizmos on the market. </s>
<s> Have my desktop, my laptop, my Roku. </s>
<s> That's enough, thank you. </s>
<s> I bought a 64G iPad in May from a big chain pretty much on a whim(got drawn in with a $399 price tag) and 3 months later I rarely use it. </s>
<s> I find it fits in between my other devices so it doesn't play a roll in my tech needs, my 15&quot; MBP is still my staple machine with my iPods and iPhone 4 handling the portable side of things. </s>
<s> The MBP sits on my lap freeing up my hands too do other stuff, it balances well and doesn't require adjustments if I shift around in the chair, and has a full keyboard attached vs the screen keyboard in the iPad(not friendly too type on) One thing I find is that I play way more games on the iPad which I haven't done in 15 years and watching video for it's size is handy. </s>
<s> Oh and no flash...that sucks! </s>
<s> I guess the way I would sum it up for tablets is they are the sport utility of the computer world......can do a little bit of everything but don't do anything perfectly. </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt; I just recently got a Samsung Galaxy S2 for my daily phone and I must say that I love how much freedom I have with the Android OS too manipulate how it runs, so if and when I replace the iPad I will switch too an Android.&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> Yes but not sure which will be the best deal and fit what I want to do the best..which is a Ereader light internet browsing a few games and such looking at the HP Touchpad,Nook Color Refurb,Lenovo thats coming out and the near future Amazon offering thats supposedly coming out to challenge the Nook Color. </s>
<s> Me, buy a tablet? </s>
<s> Yeah right. </s>
<s> I'd sooner spend the $500+ on a new TV (and I don't have any plans to do that either) than waste the money on a low-powered, limited-use device that's worthless for business/student usage, incompatible with many websites, and requires you to pay to download so-called &quot;apps&quot;. </s>
<s> A netbook (or even a low-end &quot;budget&quot; laptop) can do everything a tablet can do plus more, for less than half the cost. </s>
<s> Oh, and the laptop won't become obsolete overnight just because a new model is released. </s>
<s> I am convinced that the only reason these tablets are still being sold is because people are too easily swayed by Apple's marketing campaign and feel they &quot;need&quot; a tablet when really it's just an overpriced status symbol. </s>
<s> I suspect that in a couple years, when the novelty wears off, you will see people dumping their iPads on Craigslist for $150 to $200, just as you now see people dumping their netbooks for $100 to $200. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I am thinking about getting a tablet but the keyboard and typing on it is holding me back. </s>
<s> It seems like it would be like a smartphone just typing by pecking versus typing on a keyboard like a laptop. </s>
<s> So in that thought I am sticking with my laptop for now. </s>
<s> A tablet just seems like a novelty item to me at present. </s>
<s> So after thinking about it for now my laptop seems more functional actually. </s>
<s> Price is also too high in my opinion for a tablet. </s>
<s> The price HP just had for a $149 seems more like the right price for a tablet since it is not really that functional from what I have read versus a laptop. </s>
<s> $500-$600 for tablets is just way too expensive or so I feel. </s>
<s> I am still reading input on tablets and would like to hear more Cnet users on this subject as well as how others feel on the prices for tablets. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> jik47 </s>
<s> I have a Nook Color ($250) with the Nook2Android dual boot 16GB microsdhc card ($50). </s>
<s> If I find a honeycomb or later tablet that is as compelling a value, I'll consider getting one. </s>
<s> The Lenovo A1 and the Amazon tablet (neither available in the US, yet) are on my short list. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I got a Flytouch 3 which worked, at the third attempt!! </s>
<s> On the fisrt one not much seemed to work, so I sent it back for a refund. </s>
<s> The second one had a DOA PSU, so that went back as well. </s>
<s> The third one works OK, but android 2.2 is obviously a mobile phone OS. </s>
<s> Not a lot of good for a tablet, IMHO! </s>
<s> I want a tablet that runs Windows 7 and then 8, so it looks like my PC and laptop, and RDC and Logmein work 'out of the box', so I can log on to my network via the tablet where ever I am. </s>
<s> They are available, but much too pricey at present! </s>
<s> I know I can do it all with Android, but it is a real pain! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Best investment I ever made. </s>
<s> I am such a fan, I could be a spokesperson. </s>
<s> It's so much faster to boot than either my desktop or laptop, I can instantly check on current weather (severe or radar), check my email on all 3 accounts, read a book that feels just like a Kindle, play games (not interactive, I don't do that), follow recipes, learn a foreign language, etc. </s>
<s> I was apprehensive as I'd never dealt with Apple before, but after researching for over a year, when ipad2 came out, I jumped in. </s>
<s> I have the 16 gig, and haven't come up with any limitations versus the bigger ones. </s>
<s> I only have wifi, not 4g. </s>
<s> The app store is awesome, and I've only so far looked at the free apps. </s>
<s> I retired from IT, and have been a Dell snob until their products became unreliable, and now own a power HP desktop and high-end laptop, and now after buying my ipad2 I went out and bought an ipod touch as well. </s>
<s> Maybe I'm just bored with retirement, I don't know. </s>
<s> But these two products that I bought mainly for toys, have been nothing but joys. </s>
<s> I don't miss Flash, most web sites are smart enough to realize Apple users are customers also. </s>
<s> I do not do productivity apps on my ipad2, I use the big boys for that. </s>
<s> But for most of my daily agenda, I won't be without one of these in the future. </s>
<s> I'm at &quot;maybe&quot; until I can convince myself I need one. </s>
<s> For now, it is a technology in need of a use. </s>
<s> Don't need one. </s>
<s> No! </s>
<s> Just looks like another fad that will attract the usual herd of young people ; must haves . </s>
<s> If you feel that you must subsidise China then go ahead , more nails in the Western non-indstrial coffin . </s>
<s> LOL </s>
<s> I just sold my galaxy tab p1000 as I am looking forward to the release of the HTC Puccini in a couple of weeks to a month.I don't think that good reviews are on its side but I guess someone has to buy it and luckily, i would be one of them.I really enjoyed the p1000 though I grew out of its interface and everything seemed to be just a routine. </s>
<s> I have used a wildfire s before and I was pretty satisfied with the sense so I would not see the liking disappear with Puccini. </s>
<s> I refuse to buy another Apple product, so I am waiting to see what kind of table Amazon releases. </s>
<s> not up to my expectations, not as useful as a smart phone or actually a computer merely a toy. </s>
<s> I have a 3G Kindle for reading and minor surfing. </s>
<s> I need to find another compelling reason other than surfing in color to buy a tablet. </s>
<s> I already have a desktop,laptop and a phone with Internet and GPS that fills all my needs for computing power. </s>
<s> What other reason would I need to buy a tablet? </s>
<s> My choice is iPad2. </s>
<s> I read many reviews and I found that people's choice is iPad 2. </s>
<s> It has got lots of feature but a little costly. </s>
<s> We already own one (Actually, three. </s>
<s> We like gadgets.) </s>
<s> Yes, we enjoy each of them very much. </s>
<s> Each one is from a different manufactuer, and uses a different OS. </s>
<s> They all have their pros and cons. </s>
<s> We look forward to what will be coming in 2012. </s>
<s> HP Touchpad at $99? </s>
<s> Why not! </s>
<s> Pretty slick, actually! </s>
<s> Flash, apps for FB, pretty functional browser, nice response when overclocked and cleaned up! </s>
<s> I don't think of it as a real computer, and I wouldn't spend more than $200 on one. </s>
<s> I really am waiting for this: http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jeff_han_demos_his_breakthrough_touchscreen.html . </s>
<s> This technology on an affordable and for the masses computer is what I want. </s>
<s> Few month ago I bought Acer Iconia Tab W501,and I don't care about it's performances because I use it when I decide to travel. </s>
<s> Music, photos and films are everything I want to use it for. </s>
<s> For games I use my PC. </s>
<s> So if you want to find a good tablet follow my example, read reviews first. </s>
