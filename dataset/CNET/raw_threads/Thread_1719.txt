I tried to install a second hard drive with another XP on it. It booted up a couple of times, then the next cold start all I get is a beeping. I have no monitor or floppy. All I got is the beeping. I removed the second hard drive, but the beeping still continues. I tried to put in the restore CD's but they wouldn't boot up either. Any help or thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks in advance, Bobby &quot;the beep&quot;
