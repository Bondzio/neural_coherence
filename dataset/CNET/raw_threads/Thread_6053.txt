This time I got me a 10,000 RPM SATA drive and can not get it working. 1st off here is what I got. Mainboard http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=13-180-061&depa=0&manufactory=BROWSE Hard Drive http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=22-144-200&depa=0&manufactory=BROWSE When the computer boots up it does not list the drive. I enter the bois and have it look and it does not notice the drive. I can run f-disk, then start to install windows. when it starts to copy files over I get a blue screen saying it has stoped installation to prevent damage and list a error like I press f6 during the install and then it asked for a disk. I have a disk that came with the Mainboard. It then asked for a disk in drive a: I then picked raid, and storage drive drivers. It installed them..then thats when I get the blue screen of death. A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to provent damage to your computer. Blah blah STOP xxx00x0x00x00x00x

You need to find the bad ram/board and get it exchanged. There's no clue in your post about what parts you changed out. Or if you tried a PATA drive. Another fine issue is that most boards do not come with a current BIOS and your post does not tell if such was updated. Bob
