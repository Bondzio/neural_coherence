1.1.7	Thank you soo much for the help .	St
1.2.1	I used an economy 680 Watt PSU .	St
1.2.2	http : //216.239.51.104/search ? q=cache : BJhvUQRxVA4J : technologyvault.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,31/prev_next , next.html+ATX-300-122 & hl=en notes your supply and it might be abouy 440 Watt , but I 'd be guessing .	St
1.2.3	It might be fine .	Polite

1.3.1	well if u can run it with the x700 and it doesnt crash when playing games then its ok. but over time , this wo n't be good as you would be putting too much stress on your powersupply and it 'll will die .	St
1.3.2	so its your choice .	St
1.3.3	i would recommend getting a psu thats 400watt plus .	St
1.3.4	the thermaltake 430 watt at newegg that cost around 40 dollars should do u good .	St
1.3.5	its good enough for your machine although some may disagree and tell you to get psus that use a lot of wattage .	St
