it's been suggested that i should add ram to my pc.
i currently have 1gb ddr2 sdram at 533mhz as purchased.
other specs listed below.
mfr says add 1gb minimum or more to give me 2 or 3gb total.
supposedly it's an easy install for even a novice user, just open box, place the extra ram where it fits inside and make connections all per instructions they provide.
some questions: 1) after that install, does pc need a complete os and s/w reinstall?
2) since i've never had any problems with slowness, crashes, apps not performing correctly, etc.
-- will adding ram give me any tangible benefits, ones i may notice, other than making my wallet slimmer?
rarely, a few times in 2 years it's occurred -- when working in psp for hours making lots of edits on lots of images -- the app froze-up.
an expert told me just reboot because the &quot;cache&quot; was likely full and reboot would empty the cache and allow me to continue, and this worked.
3) is that &quot;full cache&quot; related to my amount of ram?
i'm not sure why this has been suggested other than to -- sell me more stuff, my ram capacity is &quot;not up to current new pc level&quot;(i see new ones with 2, 3 or 4 gb as standard), and i've heard that 1gb is just not enough for my uses.
image editing, video, audio, dvd and cd editing and creation(no hours-long video encoding sessions).
4) wouldn't i have noticed by now if my ram was lacking?
5) what are usual indicators of needing more ram?
(like #3 above?)
doing analog video capture i don't rely on pc processing power like with just a capture-card; i have a 3rd-party hardware/software combo connected to pc with usb2.0.
dell xps400, pentium d 820(2.8ghz)dualcore, 160gb sata ii 7200rpm hd, windows xp pro mce 2005. hd only 50% full at any time.
please advise.
thanks, stephen
