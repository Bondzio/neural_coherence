due to bob's replies i did google research on waps which led to repeaters and wireless range extenders.
i read reviews on many of these (mostly netgear, linksys and d-link) and most got many bad comments.
i was ready to give up when i ran across a relatively new model by diamond, the wr300n.
it had almost uniformly good reviews so i decided to try it out.
it took me about 15 minutes to set it up, and i'm glad to report that it works like a charm.
i plugged it in about 50 feet from my router and now both the desktop computer and wii at the other end of the house have strong wireless signals.
if you can't move your router or use a router as a wap i suggest trying out this product.
