At first I thought it was a bad power supply so I replaced it with another from my kid's PC and still won't turn on. When powered up, the fan trys to kick start and then nothing. The little LED light inside the MB turns on with power. I disconneted the HD, CDs and Floppy so just the MB is powered and still nothing. The MB is just 2 months old. Is the MB bad or could it be something else? Any suggestions?

How would I know if it powers upwithout CPU ? Should I plug a fan in? I was just reading up on bad capacitors. I need to check to see if any are &quot;blown&quot;.

My guess it's the power supply because when i wrote the problem to Asus they replyed me that the light on the MB doesn't mean the power suplly is adequate. Anyway i tried to strip it down and still nothing. Thanks for the help though.

The fans on the CPU spin, but I have to have memory for it to post and boot. If you have one strip of memory then that strip may have become unseated or the memory may have been blown. &quot;The Fans try to kickstart&quot; I presume that you are talking about the power supply? If so then that indicates a bad power supply, or one that is being shorted to ground. In this case it could be the motherboard, possibly a capacitor shorted to ground. If you mean the CPU fan then the same thing. If the motherboard is only a few months old then I believe that they are warranted for one year by the manufacturer ASUS. Norm

It would restart with no warning or error messages. Now it wont boot. All the fans come on even the cpu fans, but i cant open the cdrom door.

It would be a good idea to try the manual eject if the button fails, but CDROM units can be tested to some degree without a computer... Bob
