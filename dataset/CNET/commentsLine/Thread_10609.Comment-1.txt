i have lost the use of the geforce graphics card i installed over a year ago.
i have an ibm netvista with windows me o/s.
i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but windows keeps defaulting back to the intel video card the computer came with.
i can not figure out how to disable the intel card and enable the geforce card so that my system defaults to it.
when i plug my monitor into the geforce card i get a blank screen.
i have to plug back into the original port to see anything on the monitor.
i am as fustrated as can be.
any ideas are welcome.
thanks, todd
