1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	but what exactly is a DRM-compatible monitor?	St
1.3.2	Personally I could care less about Microsoft's implementation of DRM in every orifice of my computer, as long as it doesn't cause more major problems than Windows normally does.	St
1.3.3	However, if I'm forced to upgrade more than my graphics card to run it, I'm gonna be one really unhappy camper.	St
1.3.4	John	St
1.4.1	The move to HDTV and other all digital connections is to plug what the recording industry calls 'plugging the analog hole.'	St
1.4.2	To be effective all analog signals have to be designed out and the OS revamped as well to disallow programs that can record content.	St
1.4.3	This is not me agreeing with such, but just stating what I'm hearing in the various seminars and conferences I'm attending.	St
1.4.4	I wouldn't worry too much, the genie is out of the bottle so there's not any known method of putting it back in.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	and it's not so much the monitor as the OS.... basically M'soft will check what you want to watch/record at a guess, it won't &quot;allow&quot; you to watch a movie that has been 'ilegally' copied/pirated... jonah .	St
1.6.1	well, i think that is all crap, but that my own opinion.	St
1.6.2	the inquirer posts alot of stuff that usually never happens and its just a pure gossip company.IMO.	St
1.6.3	so, when i see these things take effect, i will start to care, but until then, i am happy with my windows mce 05 pc, and dont plan on upgrading it to a new OS.	St
1.6.4	konny	St
1.7.1	I think your video card may be ok if it is certified for use with Vista.	St
1.7.2	(I think) However, your monitor will only run stuff at low resolutions if it is not DRM compatable.	St
1.7.3	A DRM monitor is just a monitor with a DRM chip embedded in it.	St
1.8.1	I think your video card may be ok if it is certified for use with Vista.	St
1.8.2	(I think) However, your monitor will only run stuff at low resolutions if it is not DRM compatable.	St
