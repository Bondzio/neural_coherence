<s> I just redistributed the free space on my hard drive for one partition via Norton partition magic. </s>
<s> Switching originally with 130 gb to 250 gb (the size of the drive) because well.... no one really wants to get only half what they pay for. </s>
<s> So, merging the unallocated space I combined the two to make one partition. </s>
<s> Doing this i noticed that boot time took exceptionally long. </s>
<s> (8 minutes almost.) </s>
<s> So what I' am asking is by me merging the two make windows take forever to boot? </s>
<s> Thanks, Jack Hanington </s>
<s> Lets say your PC came with Windows XP. </s>
<s> Since XP's boot manager didn't support over 127GB in the boot drive, you could have later installed SP2 then expanded it and tripped over this nugget. </s>
<s> More at http://www.48bitlba.com that notes this issue with &quot;Windows XP.&quot; Sorry if this does not apply to your machine but you didn't tell all the details. </s>

<s> partitioned and formatted the unused space and moved some of all of the data to D: ? </s>
<s> Much better that way for me as thereafter you can do pretty much anything you want with C: leaving my data intact on D: ...if the drive dies or fails mechanically, there's no advantage. </s>
<s> But if C: becomes corrupt or won't boot ...I can re-image C:, restore or reinstall C: without touching D:. </s>
<s> For me, partitioning provides the ounce of separation for broader alternatives solving problems with drive C:. </s>
<s> Re booting...shouldn't increase booting VAPCMD </s>
<s> Sorry Bob, I have a 250 GB drive and the computer was originally installed with XP Pro SP2. </s>
<s> No problems when it was installed. </s>
<s> This might be true on the other versions. </s>
<s> You might want to look into it a bit further. </s>
