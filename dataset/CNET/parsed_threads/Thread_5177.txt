<s> We are hopefuly going to be getting High-Speed DSL within the month from Embarq, our phone company. </s>
<s> They use a 2Wire Home Portal gateway router which they charge $149.00 for, then give you $100.00 off, so basically theyll chargeme $49. </s>
<s> However, they do charge big-time for the computer network adapters. </s>
<s> They sell Linksys PCI network adapter cards for about $50. </s>
<s> I know I can find my own way cheaper. </s>
<s> We have two desktops in the house that will be using the router. </s>
<s> Mine will be hard-wired using a PCI card and my brother's upstairs will have to use a wireless PCI card. </s>
<s> Question 1.) </s>
<s> To match up with their 2Wire device do we HAVE to use Linksys PCI devices? </s>
<s> Intel, TRENDnet, D-Link, Intel and MSI all make PCI network adapter cards also. </s>
<s> I was leaning towards perhhaps a D-Link or Intel, but they use Bus = &quot;32-bit PCI 2.2&quot; or &quot;32-bit 2.3&quot; I don't think my computer has PCI 2.2. </s>
<s> My Everest utility lists (2) PCI, (1) PCI-E x 1 and (1) PCI-E x 16. </s>
<s> It does not list a &quot;PCI 2.2&quot; I tried reading about PCI and it's designations, but other than &quot;Express&quot; (a wholeother animal) I'm not cclear about PCI differencs. </s>
<s> However, I don't want cards that won't fit, not fit, but won't operate. </s>
<s> Question 2.) </s>
<s> Should I just go with the more expensive Linksys? </s>
<s> It's just plain &quot;32-bit PCI&quot;? </s>
<s> I want them to be compatible with the phone company's device. </s>
<s> Question 3.) </s>
<s> What cable do I need to purchase for my hard-wired connection? </s>
<s> Is any one better than another? </s>
<s> NOTE: Both desktops are about 2 years old. </s>
<s> Both AMD Athlon 64 2.0 GHz & 2.2GHz. </s>
<s> Both have PCI dial-up modems that we will replace with network cards. </s>
<s> I just want to get the correct ones so we're ready as soon as the 2Wire router box is in the house </s>
<s> Network capability with an ethernet port onboard. </s>
<s> It's rare to find a 2 year old system without. </s>
<s> Maybe if you could supply some make and model numbers for those computers we can look for you. </s>
<s> 1.) </s>
<s> Aspire AST-180 AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual-core processors. </s>
<s> Windows XP Media Center SP-2 Network card removed and replaced with pCI dial-up modem. </s>
<s> That &quot;upstairs&quot; computer needs a &quot;wireless&quot; PCI network adapter card. </s>
<s> 1.) </s>
<s> ABS Awesome AMD Athlon 64 2.0 GB 3200 Windows XP Media Center SP-2. </s>
<s> Never had a network card...just a PCI dial-up modem. </s>
<s> Add a wireless PCI card to one and a wired NIC to the other. </s>
<s> Plug and play. </s>
<s> Since network adapters are an industry standard, use the one you wish. </s>
<s> I'm partial to D-link. </s>
<s> Of the two mentioned above, only the wireless will need to have it's software installed. </s>
<s> You don't need to stick with their brandname. </s>
<s> And same for the other, install the make and model you can get cheap. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883102669R I'd supply a link to the models in question. </s>
<s> Onboard LAN was common 2 years ago. </s>
