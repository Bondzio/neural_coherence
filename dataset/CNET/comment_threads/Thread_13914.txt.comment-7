Games these days usually just need 128 mb.
or video memory to run smooth, so having a 256 mb.
of video memory isn't going to give you any major boosts in performance, because games only need 128 and buying a 256 is a waste of money and the game is not going to use the extra 128 mb., so just stick with the 128.
