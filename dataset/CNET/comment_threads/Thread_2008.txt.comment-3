Unlocking the pipes isn't gonna have as big of an impact as changing the MoBo/CPU though.
I've tweaked around with my Video Card, and have tried what you suggested, buto nly to have a 3-5 FPS increase...
There has to be some way to make my games like close to the way they do on the box... Anyways, I'll just do some research on good motherboards for AGP video cards or something...
