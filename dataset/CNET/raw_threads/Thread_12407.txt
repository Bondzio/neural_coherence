My iomega (model GDHDU) external hard-drive has stopped working (I think it's approx. 3 yrs old). I've tried a new power cable and it still doesn't work. Is there anything else I can try? ( I was considering opening the case and using compressed air to clear any dust) Is there any way I can access any data stored on it?

For some folk, the stuff they can't lose fits on 2 to 32GB memory sticks. And a nod to DROPBOX for another 2GB free. I have a few photos there with things I can't lose as the fifth copy in another place. It would be hard to delete all 5 copies. Bob
