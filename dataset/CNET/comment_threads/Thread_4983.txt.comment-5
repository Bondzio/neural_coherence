The default may be set to one Recycle Bin for all drives.
That does NOT mean that this is physically the case.
Read on: 1. if you disconnect an external drive before it is finished processing, then the Recycle Bin folders on that drive may become detached from the host machine's Recycle Bin and cannot be accessed thereafter.
You will then end up with &quot;deleted&quot; files in Recycle Bin folders on the external drive which are STILL USING SPACE on the external drive, AND with NO ACCESS from the host or any other machine.
2.
If you manually configure each drives Recycle Bin Properties seperately, then each drive will have it's own Recycle Bin with varying percentages of teach drive being used.
