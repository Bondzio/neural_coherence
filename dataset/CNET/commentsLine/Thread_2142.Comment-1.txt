we have 3 identical (hardware) networked computers, with a laser printer directly connected to the 2nd computer.
2 computers cannot gain access to the laser, it says they don't have permission.
i thought i had covered all the permissions by granting admin priveleges to all 3 (there are no security worries here) but have missed something very important when it comes to this printer.
all 3 computers do have successful, easy access to a 4th data repsoitory server box also with 2000, as well as a huge networked canon color printer.
does anyone have a suggestion as to what to try or where to get some detailed information on assigning rights on a peer 2 peer 2000 network?
thanks royala
