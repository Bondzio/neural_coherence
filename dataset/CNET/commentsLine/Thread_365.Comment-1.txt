hello everyone, i hope i can get some answers here.
i just built myself a p4 system.
i have an asus p4c800 deluxe motherboard, with a intel 3.0 gig hz possessor, 1gig or ram, two wd hd 250gig and 80gig, nvida 6800 agp video card, sound blaster audigy 2zs platinum, 480 watt power supply and windows xp pro.
boy was it fun to build and it works great.
my question is i have two cd/rw drives (one is a dvd/cd/rw) and i can only record on one of the, not both.
if i right click on one drive and click properties and and enable &quot;redording on this this cd drive&quot;, the other drive becomes unabled.
is there a way around this.
i also have nero 6 installed __________________ don
