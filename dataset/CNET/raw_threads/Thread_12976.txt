XP won't see it without the drivers, and a friend found it necessary to also format it [used a Win 98 boot floppy]. Installing the SATA as the boot drive using XP original install is a different matter. Then you need to create a floppy from the MOBO driver CD, hit the F6 key when offered and later insertt the floppy created, so that XP will install the mobo drivers. Confusing because it asks the question ere RAID or SCSI, but that actually includes SATA drivers.
