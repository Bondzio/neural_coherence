I've been through all of those steps, and just tried a couple of them again.
I've done everything ATI has suggested me to do.
I previously had a ATI AIW 7500 in this comp months back and had the same prob but fixed it by installing drivers off my motherboard cd.
I've formatted since then, and got this other card in here (no longer have access to the 7500).
I don't have the motherboard cd anymore, but I installed everything properly off ecs's website.
