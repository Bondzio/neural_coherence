<s> All, I am looking at the following PC and I just wanted to know what people think of these specs. </s>
<s> I do not need a beast or anything like that. </s>
<s> Rather, I want to be able to play all the current titles on at least medium-high settings with a decent FPS. </s>
<s> Needs to be able to play World In Conflict, Crysis: Warhead and Warhammer. </s>
<s> I have to go through Dell, so please let me know if you think any parts of this are sub par or going to give me trouble (rather than suggesting I use a different company). </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> the 9800gt will be fine at 1680x1050 (or lower) for those games. </s>
<s> but if you're using a 24&quot; monitor (1920x1280) or larger, you'll need a beefier video card like a radeon hd4870 or geforce gtx260. </s>
<s> I am intending on running this on a 22inch monitor so I think that should be fine. </s>
<s> Do the memory and processor look beefy enough for these games? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> it depends on the fsb rating of your northbridge. </s>
<s> your cpu supports 1333mhz. </s>
<s> if you get a board to match then you can possible get ram with a higher bandwidth, pc 8500 supports 1024mhz. </s>
<s> your board will list the different ram bandwidths it supports </s>
