http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128592 seems to show 6 classic SATA ports and 2 more for a RAID controller.
10 USB ports each with their own fuse and well, seems like a nice board.
When folk build PCs my advice is to steal a published design from the web (tom's hardware, etc.)
as they have usually done the hard thinking about power and more.
