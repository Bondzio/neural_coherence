Well there is no problem with trying, but im a paranoid type and i always have to have a plan b, so if the antenna is not 10dBi or close, i need to know that i have an alternative at any given situation.
That antenna look like exactly something i need, im also looking into the option of just modifying that antenna.
Also im wondering about the radiation pattern of that antenna since there are no actual radiation pattern image i am wondering if i can contact the manufacturer.
Yet i cant find that antenna at their website, so im starting to wonder if it is actually their product.
