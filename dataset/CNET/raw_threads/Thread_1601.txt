Then one day suddenly I think I saw an error message at the bottom of the screen. Now the hard drive doesn't show up on the computer, when I go to my computer it doesn't appear there though it is plugged in and on. please help...I really hope it isn't lost forever.

And you haven't said which operating system you're running. These are the things I would try, in no particular order: If you have XP, call up system restore and roll back to a date before the problem occurred. This should sort it out if the problem is with Windows. If it's an external model, maybe you accidentally moved it to a different socket? This can cause some devices to stop working and request software (drivers). Either way there should be an indication in Device Manager. Right click on ''My Computer'', then Properties, Hardware, Device Manager. Open up the tree entitled Disk drives. You should see two entries if you have two drives, more if you have other devices such as memory card readers. If you see a yellow exclamation mark against your drive, you might be able to resolve the problem by uninstalling it (right-click it & uninstall), then close all the windows & reboot the pc. If the drive isn't in the list at all, it's probably not connected properly.
