Yes, when I started the computer some writing came up on the screen (Is this a BIOS display) saying the memory had changed.
A friend called up to me yesterday (he worked in Dell before so I suppose he knows the inside of a computer better than me) and just did the old fashioned thing.
He took out the memory stick and put it back in and its working fine now.
One problem I have now though is when I open MS Word it takes longer than it should, like 10 - 15 seconds and sometimes when I right click on a file it takes a while for the options to appear.
I have all my antivirus software up to date and did a full system scan which didnt detect anything.
Could the slowdown be due to spyware perhaps or cookies?
