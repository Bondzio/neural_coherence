hi, i've decided to upgrade my existing pc.
i'm having a hard time deciding which route to go this time for the first time.
i was at first going to upgrade my system to one using a 925x motherboard w/pci-e, but it seems most of the reviews i've read, the socket 775 processors do not perform as expected and tend to run hot to boot!
i was then thinking about waiting for the nforce4 motherboards that run on the amd 64 platform w/ pci-e support.
is either of these platforms an option?
or is there something better?
i currently have a system with a asus p4pe 845 motherboard, a p4 2.53 processor with 512 meg of ddr pc2700 memory.
one of the reasons i want to upgrade is so i can run a better agp card than what i have now (mine can run only a 4x slot card.
thanks for any advise any of you can offer.
