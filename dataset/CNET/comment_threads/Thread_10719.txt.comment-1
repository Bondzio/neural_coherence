At the moment this is what my System Properties say my computer is like: Hewlett-Packard Company Compaq Presario AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3200+ 1.99 GHz, 2.50 GB of RAM My Graphics Card is: NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 I was thinking of upgrading my graphics card to this: http://www.play.com/PC/PCs/4-/8055665/Gigabyte-Radeon-HD-4550-512MB-DDR3-PCI-E-Graphics-Card/Product.html and was just wondering about upgrading my processor, how I would go about doing this and what to look for.
Or if it was not necessary?
I just generally want to speed up my pc, and obviously make the graphics better.
