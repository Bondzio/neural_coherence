1.1.1	I am looking to connect two computers to a wireless broadband network and am looking for all the methods to connect my two computers.	St
1.1.2	I have looked at an access point that can operate in client mode that will connect two ethernet devices and have given thought to buying two wireless cards.	St
1.1.3	Although two wireless would work i am already ethernet-ready and have a crossover cable that i could cut and crimp connectors to connect to the access point that i was discussing earlier (wired-wireless).	St
1.1.4	I am wondering if anyone knows of any cheap, but effective alternatives before i make a decision.	St
1.1.5	Thank you	St
