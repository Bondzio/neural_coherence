<s> ive currently got a computer in which i am looking to upgrade the ram and motherboard. </s>
<s> my specs are: motherboard-intel g43 chipset cpu-intel core2 quad [2.5 ghz] gpu-nvidea gt610 1gb ram-6gb ddr2 psu-220w os-win7 64 bit i would like to upgrade my ram because i use programs like c4d as well as many games in which i feel restricted because of my ram. </s>
<s> i occasionaly get an &quot;out of memory&quot; pop up when rendering high poly objects in c4d. </s>
<s> i am hoping to get new ram of ddr3 2133mhz quality or higher. </s>
<s> i need to upgrade the motherboard aswell because it is only compatible with ddr3 1066mhz max. </s>
<s> heres what im thinking... if i were to go ahead and upgrade motherboard as well one that is both compatible with my cpu and higher end ram speeds is non existant. </s>
<s> i would also need to upgrade my cpu. </s>

<s> if there is a way to get 2k speed ram without upgrading my cpu that would be great. </s>
<s> also what is better as far as the intel i3 vs the A10 posted above as far as preformance. </s>
<s> okay, this is the last stuff. </s>
<s> im also going to upgrade my case. </s>
<s> i just though i would throw that in there incase you had a comment on it. </s>
<s> here are links for the ram i wish to achieve and also the case. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> No matter what you do your going to need a psu and a gpu.......that's a given. </s>
<s> No machine will support 2000+ ram unless you overclock.......don't go there. </s>
<s> Your cpu is not great but it is not bad. </s>
<s> Lets try to keep this as cheap as possible.......unless bucks don't matter? </s>
<s> Post a link to your mobo. </s>
<s> its being used primarily for gaming but also for 3d graphics programs </s>
<s> i am hoping to keep the upgrade under $300 [not including the case] when you say i am going to need a psu/gpu does that mean a new one or are you just saying that in general. </s>
<s> also what would be acceptable ram speeds for a gaming pc. </s>
<s> i am pretty new to pc upgrades so im not quite in tune to the speeds that would run it well. </s>
<s> the reason i put the 2k ram is because i new they had it and also higher ram speeds so i just threw that out there as an assumption that it was a resonable upgrade... apparently not. </s>
<s> You can not game with your gpu......unless your talking about playing hearts or checkers. </s>
<s> You can not upgrade your gpu with that small psu. </s>
<s> So.....the psu has to be made bigger and then a better gpu can be fitted. </s>
<s> Again.......Post a link to your mobo or your machines make and model. </s>
<s> Let's see what were working with. </s>
<s> well first off i just got my gpu so im not upgrading already and second off i already do game with it. </s>
<s> i posted my specs above and also i dont need to know about my psu. </s>
<s> please just answer the questions i asked. </s>
<s> im not trying to make a god computer i just want to upgrade it a little bit </s>
<s> Benchmark wise the combo with the A10 wins. </s>
<s> Good luck with your build. </s>
