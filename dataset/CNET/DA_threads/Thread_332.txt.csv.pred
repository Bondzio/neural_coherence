1.1.1	I M AO EUARErws!!	St
1.1.2	Ca anyone help me?	Ques
1.1.3	I just bought a wansview nc541.	St
1.1.4	I'm having a heck of a time with it.	St
1.1.5	I finally found out how to kind of set it up.	St
1.1.6	I got it to work only by connecting it to my router.	St
1.1.7	In order to see it through my smart phone, it now talks about port forwarding.	St
1.1.8	I know next to nothing about that.	St
1.1.9	It doesn't work even when I unplug it from my routher; so oviously it is not true wifi.	St
1.1.10	I can see it from my laptop but haven't a clue how to go further to view away from home.	St
1.1.11	I've tried to contact wansview but have had no results with them getting back with me.	St
1.1.12	If anyone can help me to set this up I would be grateful.	St
1.1.13	If someone could please help me with the basics of setting this thing up (Set up for Dummies!)	Sug
1.1.14	it would be a big help.	St
1.1.15	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	If the product can't be setup by you with the supplied documentation and the maker/seller won't support you then you return it.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	If you have the option I would return this device.	St
1.3.2	Its is a very bad sign when they sell remote installation as a part of the device sale.	St
1.3.3	I could see them selling paid support but when it is that prominent on their web site and the lacking of the manuals for download smells.	St
1.3.4	The worse they write the manual the more money they get.	St
1.3.5	I suspect they assume you know all the details on wireless and know all about routers and how to set up port mappings.	St
1.3.6	Most product have some basic information for newer users who have never setup stuff like this before.	St
1.3.7	If they don't you are going to have to learn it the hard way by reading online manuals for other devices and seeing if it is similar.... or you pay them if you cannot return it	St

1.6.1	Most of the Axis units are good enough.	St
1.6.2	But many require us to be very conversant with TCP/IP, and configuration of the router if this is behind a router.	St
