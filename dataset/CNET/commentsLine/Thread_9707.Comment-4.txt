an hp printer.
it's a very efficient machine--but it's definitely not a fashion statement!
the software that came with my printer was junk.
the auto-update feature only worked once...after that, it was all error messages, etc.
no one at the company ever replied to any of the email inquiries i sent them.
eventually, i just decided to shutdown/remove all their software and get by with basic drivers.
everything works just fine now.
based on recent threads, i'd never buy a laptop from hp/compaq (badly designed/constructed, overheating problems, etc.)
and i'd approach their desktops with caution.
hp probably won't be of any help to you if you have a problem (or get a lemon), so you'll have to be ready to return it quickly--or fix it yourself.
if you get a good one, it will be a deal...but it will never be a fashion statement!
