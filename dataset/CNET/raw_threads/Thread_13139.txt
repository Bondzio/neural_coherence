Sometimes the Laptop or Desktop will not update the BIOS with the standard methods. Can you boot with Linux or UbunTu on a Flashdrive or a CD? Then flash / update / the BIOS? But after creating a bootable CD how you can copy the BIOS file over to it? Thank you for all of your time and new and creative ideas. Regards | Gary | New Orleans | French Quarter

Imagine the poor soul that made up another method and bricked their laptop. Now imagine if their were your friend and you bricked their laptop. This can't end well and why I suggest you always use the supported, documented methods or don't do it. Bob

Have you booted with Linux or UbunTu on a Flashdrive or a CD? . Yes I have. This is well documented and well discussed area of PCs. The only time I see folk in trouble is if their machine doesn't support this or if they didn't follow the directions on making the bootable media. Bob
