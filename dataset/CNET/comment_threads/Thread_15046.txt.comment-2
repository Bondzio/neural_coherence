Get the Apple card and be happy it just works without much ado.
Try another card and if it glitches, then you get to sort it out.
The other makers just don't get it about Mac support so that's my advice since you have an Apple.
Consider that with the older iBook you may not realize any big gain in speed.
Then again... Bob
