I would like to build a dual processor computer but I don't know what motherboards can support this and what processors work best.
I like to multi task and my computer now is just SLOW when i'm doing anything that's processor intensive such as encoding a DVD.
I read about multi-core processors and if they work the same as dual processor then I suppose I could use that.
Thanks
