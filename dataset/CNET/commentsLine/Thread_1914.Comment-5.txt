don't the wireless routers have to be the same brand in order to accomplish this?
i had an old 802.11b wireless router and i tried adding it (mainly for the extra broadcast point) to my d-link and they could never see each other.. i don't think i still have that old one, but i could certainly buy another dlink if that would work.. that would also help my signal issues i have down here as well.... if i knew it would work.
