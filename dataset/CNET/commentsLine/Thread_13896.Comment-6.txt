i know this may seem like a dumb response; after reading through the responses, it seems that the mobo is shorting out somewhere.
have you made sure there are only the standoffs needed for securing your mobo to the case; that all mobo screws are securely fastened ( a loose mobo screw will short out your board), no extra standoffs screwed into the case (this will short out a mobo as well), nothing extra rattling around inside the case.
are the phase led's part of the mobo (or more like a cold cathode tube, installed after the build as part of decoration) ?
if they are part of the mobo; then check on gigabyte's website/ forums for error codes for the led's.
