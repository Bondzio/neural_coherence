<s> I built a PC with the following configuration: MOBO- ASUS M2N-32SLI which includes Nvidia RAID controller Windows 7 Professional (64-bit) AMD Dual Core Athlon processor 4 GB RAM Current RAID confguration is 2 disks mirrored for drive C (all program installs) Mirror 2 has all docs, data, etc My question is this: how difficult would it be to reconfigure the RAID to 5? </s>
<s> Would the best solution be to break each mirror, and add an additional drive for drives C and D and convert them to a separate RAID 5 virtual drive for each? </s>
<s> Also, would I have to lose all of the data and/or programs, or does the RAID controller automatically reconfigure the data and convert it to RAID 5? </s>
<s> The reason that I'm using RAID instead of backup is that I have huge video and music files (I create videos and arrange music) and don't want to add a 2 TB drive to back up everything. </s>
<s> However, I can't risk losing my information and files. </s>
<s> I hope that this is a bit clearer than mud. </s>
<s> If anyone needs clarification or additional info, I will be happy to append it to this original post. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help. </s>

<s> Let's start by you supply the MANUAL to this RAID controller. </s>
<s> I'll read it if you supply it and see if they document how to do this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I appreciate your wiilingness to look at the documentation and I really feel stupid asking this question, but i can't find anywhere in this forum thread where I can attach a pdf file of the manual. </s>
<s> I can reply with the instructions in the message body, but the chapter on the RAID controller is 17 pages long. </s>
<s> I have searched the FAQs and every other place on this site, but cannot find where I can upload the pdf. </s>
<s> Please forgive my ignorance, but this is the first forum where I've encountered this problem. </s>
<s> Thanks, jeff </s>
<s> You can supply the maker's web link or even a dropbox public link. </s>
<s> I'm so sorry - I didn't even think about doing that. </s>
<s> Here is a link to the manual. </s>
<s> The pdf download is about at the middle of the page. </s>
<s> Again, I thank you for willing to take the time to see if you can help me. </s>
<s> Hope you're having a Happy Turkey Day! </s>

<s> &quot;Sorry. </s>

<s> ASUS M2N32-SLI Deluxe is temporary unavailable.&quot; Did I try for the wrong board? </s>
<s> Is this at the ASUS site? </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> I would create an image of the RAID 1 array and store that on another HD. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I would create the RAID 5 array on a new set of HDs using the BIOS utility to do such. </s>
<s> (This will break the RAID 1 array) You will also want to make sure your HD selection is designed for RAID operation. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I would restore the image to the new array. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> I would attempt to boot the PC. </s>
<s> With a little luck and cooperation from the imaging software, this should work since the array is considered as one drive. </s>
<s> I have used this method to move an OS on a single disk to a RAID 1 array and it worked fine with XP. </s>
<s> I've not gone from one RAID configuration to another, however. </s>
<s> Your MB claims to support RAID 0/1/5 and JBOD. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
