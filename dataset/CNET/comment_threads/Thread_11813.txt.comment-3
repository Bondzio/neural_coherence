partitioned and formatted the unused space and moved some of all of the data to D: ?
Much better that way for me as thereafter you can do pretty much anything you want with C: leaving my data intact on D: ...if the drive dies or fails mechanically, there's no advantage.
But if C: becomes corrupt or won't boot ...I can re-image C:, restore or reinstall C: without touching D:.
For me, partitioning provides the ounce of separation for broader alternatives solving problems with drive C:.
Re booting...shouldn't increase booting VAPCMD
