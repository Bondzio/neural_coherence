Sorry I was at work when I made this post so I wasn't able to provide better information.
I found out that my power supply is in total 700 watts.
I'm not sure of a program I could use to show all my information, for example the dxdiag doesn't display my information for some reason.
I know this much about my computer... Intel Quad Core Q6600 2.40GHZ Heatsink is a Hyper Master 212 Plus Asus Radeon HD 7770 8 Gigs of Ram OCZ 700 watt PSU (12v) Windows Vista 64bit Below I was able to provide a screenshot of the bluescreen I am getting.
I tried swapping out the Radeon 7770 with the 4600 series I was using before I was getting the Bluescreen and I still get it right before it shows the Windows logo then goes to desktop.
I ended up taking out everything, cleaning out the computer which built up some dust, and replaced everything and still ended up with the bluescreen.
Screenshot of Bluescreen provided below.
