1.1.1	I admittedly am a newbie when it comes to things like this , so I ask : is it better to get a Radeon X700 with PCIExpress , or a 9800 256mb with AGP ?	Ques
1.1.2	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	well if you have a integrated graphics card you know the on board then i would go with agp not pci cause the onboard graphic card will yield to the agp but will give you a fit with pci good luck	St
1.3.1	work stick with agp	St
