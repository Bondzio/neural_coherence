10489	0	580329	5397966	NR	FreddyGuy	12/15/12 4:14 PM	1.35558804E12	Updating BIOS	Question : Does anyone know where I can find info about all the updates done on my Gigabyte motherboard's BIOS (Model Number EP45-UD3R) that includes details about what precautions I need to take to avoid damaging my system after the BIOS? (For example, some BIOS require editting certain settings in Vista before hand in order to function properly.) This site has a short description of what new features there are, but nothing about precautions you need to take. Additional info : I'm having problems with my second disk on my computer, and searching on google some people resolved the problem by updating their motherboards BIOS. Basically either my disk has gone bad or I need to update my BIOS. I'm doing a disk check now. However, before updating the BIOS I want to read the accompanying info about the updates to see if there is any chance it could fix my issues and to avoid doing an update if it is, for some reason, incompatible with my system. All I can find is this: http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3013#bios Motherboard Model Number EP45-UD3R I have the original BIOS (version F3) I've never flashed BIOS before, and I don't want to do it without reading the accompanying docs on it.

Just make sure you do it on a sunny day when there're no thunderstorms because if there's a blink of the power during an update, your motherboard's reduced to a door stop. There are ways to recover, but the ounce of prevention certainly outweighs the pound of cure. It only takes a few seconds to do the update, and I have to say I've never had a problem doing it (knock, knock!), but I always check the weather channel and use a UPS (aka battery backup) just in case. With a UPS, you've got to be somewhere around 99.999% safe, and it's a good thing to have in any event. Good luck.

The good news is most GB MBs have a dual BIOS meaning if you hose up the main BIOS with a bad flash/update, you can usually switch to the backup BIOS to get back up and running. VAPCMD

I'm trying to find out if there is a more detailed description, or if that is it. Thanks for the reply though!

PDFs, when opened, look distorted, but if copied to the master drive they function normally. I'm running a disk check right now to see if it is just a bad hard drive, I've had it for a while and it used to be fine, but it only had a few files on it. Now I use it for more files and it has started being slow. Disk check has been running for 6 hours or so and I'm only at 134 out of around 125 thousand sections.

Might finish by New Year. Also might try HDTune...that can give you some quick performance info and you can compare performance between drives in the system. If the drives test OK...then you might try the BIOS FLASH to F12 as there are some known I/O issues identified with the original BIOS. BTW ...what hard drives are you running ...are they PATA or SATA ?

I'll buy one in the morning and report back when I've completed doing that, plus your other suggestions about the SATA Cable.

So I purchased a new SATA cable to replace the old one, and now the problems I was having are (so far) gone. There is still a small (and expected) delay on seeking for very large files, but I would expect that in any event. But the warping/skipping issue I was experiencing is gone.
