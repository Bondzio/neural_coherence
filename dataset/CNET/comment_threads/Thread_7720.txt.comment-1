I went through setup and internet works with any connect computer through direct connection.
Also, my Iphone and HTC Aria both connect to the router wirelessly but I cannot get my laptop or my parents computer to connect wirelessly.
I have tried allowing them through the router and it does not work.
The network is secured with a password and I am correctly typing the password in.
I do not understand how my phones can connect but not my laptop or computer?
I have updated the firmware on the router and everything works on it perfectly.
Any help would be nice.
P.S, This router is hooked up directly to a ATT Uverse Modem.
