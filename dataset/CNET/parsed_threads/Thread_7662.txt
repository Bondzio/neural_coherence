<s> OK, I know this sounds wierd, but it has really happened and I'm bummed. </s>
<s> I have an AMD Athlon XP 2200+ (1.8 GHz). </s>
<s> Everything was going smoothly until--as usual-- I had to format my HD and reinstall XP Prp SP2. </s>
<s> After installation, for some reason my CPU is recognized as AMD Athlon Xp 1500+ (1.3 GHz). </s>
<s> It is really killing me. </s>
<s> I would really appreciate it if someone could tell what in the world is wrong! </s>
<s> your mobo/BIOS into thinking it had a bad shutdown. </s>
<s> Thus it defaulted to a safe memory speed setting, thus a slower CPU clock. </s>
<s> Probably defaulted to 100MHz. </s>
<s> Simply go into BIOS and set it back to 133 MHz. </s>
<s> about the CPU clock. </s>
<s> It is set to 100MHz, but I can't seem to be able to change it unlike other options. </s>
<s> Do you have any idea how I can change it? </s>
<s> ( I go to Advanced BIOS) Thanks. </s>
<s> For example if it is DDR 2100 [100MHz which gets read twice per cycle] some mobos call that 200 MHz, the 133 can be called 266. </s>
<s> The thing that sets the CPU speed if the Front Side Bus [FSB], thus some mobos refer to setting the FSB. </s>
<s> So you may set the memory [bus] speed or the FSB. </s>
<s> In the BIOS there may be an option to set the bus speed automatically or manually. </s>
<s> It varies. </s>
<s> Do you have the manual for the mobo??? </s>
<s> Look it over closely. </s>
<s> Some of the &quot;Pidgen English&quot; used in the manuals takes some decoding. </s>
<s> LOL What mobo is it. </s>
<s> Possibly I could go to the mfr's website and download the manual to see if I can offer some help. </s>
<s> I'm relying on you that the only thing was reinstalling XP. </s>
<s> Some mobos have jumpers on the mobo to set the memory speed, but that shouldn't have changed without you doing it. </s>
<s> Thank you so much! </s>
<s> Thanks to you I have my CPU back. </s>
<s> By the way, when I was changing it to 133MHz, I could go higher. </s>
<s> What's going to happen if I do so? </s>
<s> Is my computer going to blow up?! </s>
<s> LOL Anyway, again, thanks for all of your help. </s>
<s> &quot;overclocking&quot; [assuming that you don't actually have 166 MHz memory]. </s>
<s> Don't try it without doing a lot of reading to understand all aspects of overclocking. </s>
<s> You can end up frying the CPU. </s>
<s> The faster it runs the hotter it gets unless you lower voltages and others actions. </s>
<s> There are a number of overclockers sites. </s>
<s> Check your Bios setup and make the error </s>
