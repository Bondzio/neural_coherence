Hello, I am wanting to upgrade my video card from a nVidia 8300 GS 128 MB to a card that is good enough to play Half-Life 2 Episode 2 and above.
Left4Dead2 Demo did not play that well either.
I have a 300 watt power supply, and some claim that the Radeon 4650 , and 4670 will work?
I have had others claim that I need to get a (uhm.. crappy) 8500 GT nVidia ?
Then there are others that say I need to upgrade my power supply before I even think about getting any upgrades?
Any more ideas?
