<s> Hi everyone, I have(Maxtor F01G300 OneTouch III 300GB External Hard Drive USB 2.0/FireWire 400),the old series and I am using it with Sony Vaio laptop 1.8 Hz cpu with windows xp and 512 Mb Ram with Norton 360 antivirus 2008 version which is updated properly. </s>
<s> Recently when I plug the external drive, after being recognized by the windows, as soon as i go into the directories after a couple of minutes i can not access to the data. </s>
<s> It will come up with the message: it is not accessible and the the external drive would not respond anymore and I would get a message with exclamation mark near the time and date corner of the desktop indicating the same message. </s>
<s> The time for this to happen varries between 15 seconds after connection to maximum 5 minutes. </s>
<s> I am desperately asking for HELP!! </s>
<s> Thanks to all of you guys. </s>
<s> This is a common early warning that the drive has issues. </s>
<s> Hopefully there are no files you have not backed up. </s>
<s> Next call up Maxtor and ask how much to fix. </s>
