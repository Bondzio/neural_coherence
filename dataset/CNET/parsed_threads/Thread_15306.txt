<s> I have 500GB External Hard Drive. </s>
<s> I am using it for Vedio Recording. </s>
<s> Suddenly that Hard Drive now shows size of 111GB only. </s>
<s> It used to save recording for 15 days it comes only to 5 days. </s>
<s> Any Help or Suggestion to get my lost bytes back. </s>
<s> I have Windows XP installed. </s>
<s> For example if someone plugged it into Windows XP (notice no SP?) </s>
<s> then that's what XP would report. </s>
<s> In fact it could corrupt the drive. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Plug into a system with an OS that supports over 127GB drives and start over. </s>

<s> I had that hard drive with same PC. </s>
<s> It was 500GB at the time it was installed. </s>
<s> Just recently i noticed it is not 500GB anymore...Do you suggest me to upgarde software with SP2? </s>
<s> Read http://www.48bitlba.com for more details and keep an eye out on what limits us to 127GB. </s>
<s> One of them is &quot;XP.&quot; </s>
