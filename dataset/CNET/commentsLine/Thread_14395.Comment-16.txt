bob, i always research things - people come to me for help with their systems & networks....i repair/refurb computers on the slide....i almost always find what i need by researching, and when i get stuck, i ask.
i had even posted in the vistaheads forum - no one had a clue what my problem was!
i should have come here a year ago!!
wow, a stable wifi network....i don't know what to do with myself now!
lol i'll tell you, i have yet to be satisfied with vista and all the annoying things microsoft have done with it.
the only reason i have it on this laptop is so i could get intimately acquainted with it enough to be able to assist others.
when windows 7 comes out, if anyone needs help with it, they will probably have to start paying at the local computer shop, because i don't think i can put myself through any more torture!
kudos for bob.
man, you rock.
i have stable wifi for the first time in a year!
i owe you one!
