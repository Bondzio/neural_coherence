you need to take nothing for granted.
i thought that any car a/c will cause damage and if it did just wouldn't work if that severe.
you/re going to have to check it out top to bottom and verify all is well.
clean it out, reseat components, etc., fan(s) operation and same type of location as before.
doing all that helps eliminate or resolve your problem.
it's not the same anymore, no matter how you want to view this, you moved it and relocated to different area.
sorry, no easy, replace or do this or that.
once all of the above is done, then look at possible damage.
overall, i don't see that for now.
you may need to do a total teardown and rebuild to best ideal conditions.
fyi, i've seen pcs moved but didn't work at yours.
one case involved that the user sat the pc next to the door for over a week.
moved and then issues.
upon teardown, found a mouse had visited the pc and chewed some harness and peed inside(stains) thought the pc booted and all, it never was the same.
another had roaches move in.
so, don't take things for granted whatever your cause is.
