What's the size of this 'C' drive?
If it's almost 200GB, then there is no place to make any additional partitions.
Use a Partition Resizer to reduce the size of this 'C' and then you can make additional partitions in the freed space.
Much more info has been posted in many other postings in this site!!
Hope this helps.
