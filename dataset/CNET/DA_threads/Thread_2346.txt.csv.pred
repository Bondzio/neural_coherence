1.1.1	I'll explain my layout: I have DSL internet and 2 computers.	St
1.1.2	One computer has 2 network cards, the other has one.	St
1.1.3	I have the DSL modem going into one of the network cards on computer A.	St
1.1.4	The 2nd card on computer A is hooked up to a 5 port switch.	St
1.1.5	Computer B is also hooked up to the switch.	St
1.1.6	Before I had broadband i used dialup.	St
1.1.7	This set up worked fine for dial up, but for some reason the internet wont work at all if i try to network the 2 computers using this method.	St
1.1.8	Please help me!	St
1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	to the mix.	St
1.2.2	For as little as $20, you get a device which will service the Internet connection as well as provide the infrastructure for a local area network.	St
1.2.3	ICS works fine until some software incapatibility wrecks the networking ability of XP.	St
1.2.4	A hardware solution is best.	St
1.3.1	Add the router, get rid of one of the NICs.	St
1.3.2	Connect the PCs to the router.	St
1.3.3	Done.	St
1.4.1	Is the 5 port swith a router also?	St
1.4.2	If is it then you won't have to buy a round and you would disregard the second nic card and connect the dsl directly to the switch and run ur network and share the internet thru that if now,then I would suggest buying a rounter to make things simple.	St
1.4.3	You can also set the net on PC A then run the XP network wizard on PC a with internet sharing then run the network wizard on PC B telling it to get NET access from PC A.	St
1.4.4	*** Do not foget on to distinguish the NIC cards on PC A properly 1 would be for the net and the other for the network with internet sharing enabled.	St
1.4.5	Good luck	Polite
