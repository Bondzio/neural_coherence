<s> I read Office Depot had a great clearance on computers. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, by the time I got there the Compaq Desktop display SR 1420NX was the only one left. </s>
<s> After rebates, it was only $212. </s>
<s> We'll mostly use it for word processing, surfing the internet and photo editing. </s>
<s> It's replacing an old 98 Gateway. </s>
<s> Any thoughts before my 14 days is up? </s>
<s> I don't want a $200.00 headache. </s>
<s> It has a Celeron D processor, DVD/CD burner, 80G hard drive, 512 RAM. </s>
<s> No monitor included. </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice. </s>
<s> thus far I cannot locate specs for that model but i'm guessing it should be fine </s>

<s> Just don't expect to game on it because of the lack of an AGP slot. </s>
<s> We don't do much gaming but my kids have several of the Sims.... </s>
<s> Suggest you get a gfx card upgrade. </s>
<s> Nvdia 5500 128-bit. </s>
<s> Around $100 at newegg. </s>
<s> If can't, get 5200 should be less than $50. </s>

<s> The SR1420NX was introduced Feb 16, 2005. </s>
<s> It has a Intel 845GV chipset and Integrated graphics. </s>
<s> Maybe someone who has the Intel Extreme Integrated graphics can tell you if it will handle Sims type games if they have the games. </s>
<s> There is no AGP or PCI-Express x16 slot, so to upgrade the Integrated on board graphics, you would have to get a PCI video card (again note when you buy...no AGP or PCIe card). </s>
<s> Roger mentioned the Nvidia 5200 and 5500, but they would have to be in the PCI versions. </s>
<s> The highest you can go in PCI is Nvidia 5700LE, which I would suggest. </s>
<s> Provided you get the rebates back, you got a good deal. </s>
<s> Even w/o rebates its a system worth having for awhile. </s>
<s> I won't complain if you don't. </s>
<s> Here's a link to specs and such: http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&sku_id=0926INGFS10058764&catid=20217&test%5Fcookie=1 So be happy, for a $212.00 I,m sure anyone would like to have. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I think it will be fine for what we want if for - has to be better than our old Gateway that keeps crashing! </s>
<s> i have the very same model like you and it can run very good. </s>
<s> I played Unreal Tornament 2003 on it. </s>
<s> i also played 7 different mmorpg games and it still runs fine and the same speed like when i got it </s>
