1.1.1	My system has killed two power supply units in about a year and a half .	St
1.1.2	This last one was a 800W .	St
1.1.3	I am only running a dual core AMD .	St
1.1.4	I am running a higher end video card but nothing 800W wouldnt be able to handle .	St
1.1.5	I think the other one was a 500W .	St
1.1.6	Any thoughts ?	Ques
1.2.1	are you using a good UPS or surge suppessor ?	Ques
1.3.1	Yeah I have it in a surge protector .	St
1.4.1	it 's next-to-impossible for a PC that 's functioning normally to & quot ; kill & quot ; a power supply every few months .	St
1.4.2	an electrical problem in the PC would cause it to perform erractically if at all .	St
1.4.3	however , bad AC power can cause a power supply to fail and a cheap surge suppressor wo n't clean up bad power .	St
1.5.1	Having 2 bad psus , is n't the end of the world but can suggest the & quot ; outside world & quot ; can be having an effect .	St
1.5.2	Meaning , that bad power AC as Ramac mentioned could be at fault .	St
1.5.3	A simple surge protector is NOT meant to last forever .	St
1.5.4	In fact if the surge protector got hit , its good just for & quot ; 1 time & quot ; for its rating .	St
1.5.5	It may still allow AC to flow but the protection is gone .	St
1.5.6	Better surge protectors offer a LED showing being active and NOT just AC present .	St
1.5.7	Further , considering your hi-wattage 800W psu that got pasted , a decent UPS is probably needed as well .	St
1.5.8	If possible a good & quot ; AC line conditioner & quot ; too as even more protection .	St
1.5.9	While psu rating are a good starting point to check the specs , a true decent psu provides also its RMS value or true level ( basic ) of proper stable wattage output , usually lower than the rating .	St
1.5.10	Many times the rating offered is & quot ; peak & quot ; and a psu should n't be operating at peak for long periods , again being stressed .	St
1.5.11	Taking nothing for granted , good cooling is very much desired .	St
1.5.12	Have ample cooling to the system case so its does n't set-up the psu to fail .	St
1.5.13	Lacking cooling and improper venting will cause a psu to stress-out and fail quicker .	St
1.5.14	Last , psu specs should offer the & quot ; rail voltages/amps & quot ; as any voltage once comprised will bring down the psu .	St
1.5.15	Thus , dual rails offer to spread the voltage demands to other components so no lone component ( s ) is having to do all the work .	St
1.5.16	tada -- -- -Willy	St
