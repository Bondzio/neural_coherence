I have an older sata hd that already has an os on it that I need to get some info from. How can I connect this to my current system? If I just plug it into my extra sata slot, will it automatically read my current still as the boot drive? And if so, will I have to download any drivers to be able to access this old hd to pull the info off of it? Sorry if its a little confusing. I used to work on computers but haven't dealt with any in a while, especially sata. Thanks!!
