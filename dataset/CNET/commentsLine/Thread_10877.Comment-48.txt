if the ssd was truly reliable, we should be able to treat it like a true hard drive.
it should not make a bit of difference whether we did or did not do hybernation daily.
suppose we do it once or twice a day, i would still expect the ssd to not fail in the 5 years of regular use.
by year end, you should expect composite hard drives with built-in ssd.
let us who are worried about insipient failures wait to be second into the market.
