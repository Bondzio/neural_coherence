<s> My CD-RW by MSI has quit working reliably on my home computer. </s>
<s> It will write sometimes; will not read what it has written even though I can read it on my CD-ROM; and will read a commercial disk (program). </s>
<s> I took it to the repair shop where they connected it to their computer and all worked well. </s>
<s> I'm running Win98SE, Athlon 2400, MSI motherboard (6 months old). </s>
<s> I've removed the hardware in System Devices and let Windows reinstall to no avail and cleaned the laser lens(es). </s>
<s> My thoughts now are to reverse the positions of the CD-RW and CD-ROM, try a new cable, and then take the entire system in for check. </s>
<s> Any suggestions are welcome. </s>
<s> Since the drive worked at the store in another system it is time to replace the cable. </s>
<s> Yes you can try using the drive alone on the cable or on the other cable connector to see if that does the job. </s>
<s> It's another system with an undersized power supply. </s>
<s> Tell what's in the box? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'll try a new cable and report back. </s>
<s> Bob, you may have something. </s>
<s> I got a new power supply when I put in the new motherboard but it worked great up to now. </s>
<s> I'll check the size tonight when I have the case open. </s>
<s> However, I recently added an UPS to my setup. </s>
<s> Could power from that be limited and causing the problem? </s>
<s> I've yet to see an UPS do that, but then again, the moment I write it can't be this or that... </s>
<s> Remember that CDRW drives are spotted all the time for 20 bucks, so keep that in mind as you try to recover the drive. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The power supply is 300 watt. </s>
<s> I changed the cable and tried again - no dice. </s>
<s> It will not read anything it has burned, even discs it could read a week or so ago. </s>
<s> It will read some commercial program discs. </s>
<s> All suggestions are welcome. </s>
<s> The 300W PSU is good for unmodified &quot;boxed&quot; computers, but not any home built units past about 500 MHz. </s>
<s> But your writings are just like those that the drive fails completely later. </s>
<s> Unless the power supply is dropping out. </s>
<s> Start shopping. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think I've done everything I can do here. </s>
<s> I removed the primary CD and connected the CD-RW in it's place. </s>
<s> Still no go. </s>
<s> Will read some things, but not others. </s>
<s> Mostly will not read anything it has written and only reads other CD's occasionally. </s>
<s> Fortunately, it's under warranty. </s>
<s> I'll post the final resolution. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> the question here is does the other cd read what has been written by the cdr/w writer and what type of disks are you writing to? </s>
<s> cdr or cdrw? </s>
<s> and doe this occur with both types?. </s>
<s> Chuck43, Yes, the other CD reader will read what the CD-RW has written. </s>
<s> I'm using CD-R discs, not CD-RW. </s>
<s> I put a previously written CD-RW into the drive and activated InCD and it would not recognize the presence of the RW disc. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> It turned out to be the CD-RW. </s>
<s> A new one was provided under warranty. </s>
