1.1.1	http : //www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1391632,00.asp ? kc=EWNWS112103DTX1K0000599 & quot ; In fact , there are only three non-overlapping channels , 1 , 6 and 11. & quot ; That 's a great nugget of information if you are moving your channels about to get away from some interference .	St

1.2.1	Very interesting article .	Polite
1.2.2	I have just obtained and returned a D-LINK 624 G router because the new firmware would not allow me to select a channel .	St
1.2.3	The article implies that , when operating in the 108 mode , you lose the ability to select channels .	St
1.2.4	What was frustrating was that no one in tech support at D-LINK had a clue as to why I was locked in on channel 6 .	St
1.2.5	It appears that this simply is the way the implementation is suppose to work .	St
1.2.6	I also found posts about the Netgear 108 product where people are complaining about being locked into only one channel .	St
1.2.7	Is this truly the way the implementation is suppose to work ?	Ques
1.2.8	If so , would you not think that the vendor 's own tech support would know this ?	Ques

1.3.1	In the outsourced support , they are usually spoonfed what someone thinks they need .	St
1.3.2	I find today 's outsourced support to not have a ready path back to the developers or someone who can look into the issue .	St
1.3.3	As you rightly discerned , that mode spills over the channels so there is no way they should allow you to flip channels in that proprietary mode .	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	Out of curiosity , I went back to the D-LINK site and brought up the 108G documentation .	St
1.4.2	Under the FAQ , an answer to & quot ; enabling the SUPER G mode & quot ; also stated that only channel 6 can be used .	St
1.4.3	I obviously missed this when I originally checked out the site .	St
1.4.4	Amazing that tech support did not know this .	St
1.4.5	As a result I returned a functioning router and D-LINK lost a sale .	St
1.4.6	FWIW , I was trying this router because of a perceived issue with a BELKIN wireless G router with which I was intermittently losing the Internet connection from my Motorola SB4200 cable modem ( I have posted about this on this group a few weeks ago ) .	St
1.4.7	After returning the D-LINK , I went out and purchased ( with the right to return ) an RCA cable modem since the SB4200 was also a suspect ( Comcast would not allow me to have a new modem since it & quot ; worked O.K. & quot ; directly connected ) .	St
1.4.8	Anyway , it now appears that the SB4200 was the problem .	St
1.4.9	It 's been almost 4.5 days and I 've not had a disconnect ( 4-6 times daily with the SB4200 ) .	St
1.4.10	Furthermore , my upload speeds have increased by about 20 % .	St
1.4.11	I 'm tempted to try the D-LINK again except for their poor tech support and the very good support I received from BELKIN ( sent me out a brand new , field tested router - also very easy to get to their tech support people ) .	St
1.4.12	Harvey	St
1.5.1	The issue was their router that on some number of browses would direct the user to an advertisement .	St
1.5.2	The recoil was such that Belkin was ... beat up on the web .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	My problem , of course , was not related to the & quot ; spying & quot ; issue .	St
1.6.2	My issue started before the advertisement flap .	St
1.6.3	However , BELKIN did appear to respond ( apologize ) quickly .	St
1.6.4	In fact , their is a new firmware update on their site ( put there a few days ago ) that removes the advertising code .	St
1.6.5	Harvey	St
1.7.1	.	St
