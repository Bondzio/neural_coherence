1.1.1	I purchased a used Dell Latitude Cpx from ebay in October .	St
1.1.2	When I first turned it all everything seemed fine .	St
1.1.3	After a while a timer came up and would restart my computer .	St
1.1.4	I thought it was an administrative command , so I looked for steps to stop this from happening .	St
1.1.5	Eventually I realized this was actually a sympton of the gaobot/agobot virus family !	St
1.1.6	I had to download various anti-virus programs to remove it .	St
1.1.7	Variants of this virus kept infecting my computer despite my attemtps to clean my laptop .	St
1.1.8	I had lots of spyware and malware in addition to the nasty viruses .	St

1.1.13	A few days ago I left my computer on and napped for a few hours .	St
1.1.14	When I woke up my laptop restarted itself and was stuck on the opening screen .	St
1.1.15	I turned it on then back on again to see what was going on .	St
1.1.16	I tried to start firefox and a message about an .xml document popped up .	St
1.1.17	I was n't wearing my glasses so I could n't see it .	St
1.1.18	Firefox closed immediately ; I knew something was VERY wrong .	St
1.1.19	I opened ad-aware to check out the problem .	St
1.1.20	Lo and behold my virus definitions had been corrupted or missing .	St
1.1.21	Uh oh .	St
1.1.22	My computer turned on !	St
1.1.23	I rebooted it into safe mode and ran ad-aware then .	St
1.1.24	I opened spybot and a message popped up indicating the program had been changed , which does n't occur unless there is a trojan or spyware .	St
1.1.25	My computer turns off AGAIN .	St

1.1.30	I am told this laptop was ordered 6 years ago and is a 98 system .	St
1.1.31	The ebay listing stated it was windows XP but did not mention an upgrade .	St
1.1.32	The seller said he could try to fix it but depending on the problem it might cost .	St
1.1.33	What do I do ? ! ?	Ques
1.1.34	A ) Toss the laptop and get a new one elsewhere or B ) Let the seller fix it C ) Something else .	St

1.1.36	That was a dumb decision which cost me in the long run .	St
1.1.37	I should have spent the extra few hundred dollars for a new laptop .	St
1.1.38	You get what you pay for .	St
1.2.1	It sounds like a software problem .	St
1.2.2	Have you thought about finding the drivers for the laptop then buying a fresh copy of W98SE ?	Ques
1.2.3	I mention 98 because a machine that old may not have the guts to run XP .	St
1.2.4	If you like the machine and want to keep it , I think I 'd try to do a format and reinstall the OS and system drivers .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	you may have a point .	St
1.4.2	when I spoke with Dell I was told that the computer barely fits Xp .	St
1.4.3	hmmm .	St
1.4.4	do you think the computer is worth fixing ?	Ques
1.5.1	If you can get the specs on the laptop , here is what microsoft says : Here 's What You Need to Use Windows XP Home Edition PC with 300 megahertz ( MHz ) or higher processor clock speed recommended ; 233-MHz minimum required ; * Intel Pentium/Celeron family , AMD K6/Athlon/Duron family , or compatible processor recommended 128 megabytes ( MB ) of RAM or higher recommended ( 64 MB minimum supported ; may limit performance and some features ) 1.5 gigabyte ( GB ) of available hard disk space .

1.5.4	I would n't even try it on a machine like the above .	St
1.5.5	It 's probably worth fixing , but now with XP as the OS .	St
