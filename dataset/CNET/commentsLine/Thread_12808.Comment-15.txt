i've heard many people put down emachine computers before (including the salesman that sold me mine), but honestly my $500 t3092 that i bought 3 & 1/2 years ago has been spectacular.
i have had zero problems with it, and even if it explodes in another year...who cares!
it was still half the price of a dell/hp/etc.
and it's time to upgrade anyway.
i only wish they still made laptops, i'd buy one in a heartbeat for my next computer.
