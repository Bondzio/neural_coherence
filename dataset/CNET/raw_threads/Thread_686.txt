I need a recommendation on a program for scanning my hard drives for any sort of surface damage. I've been hearing a noise from time to time on my 2nd hard drive sort of a squeaking noise and I'm worried it might be something wrong.

Proffitt	6/6/09 5:27 AM	1.24426602E12	Get their bootable DOS version next time.	&quot;The DOS version is required if installing a hard drive in a new system without existing operating system support.&quot; We can use that since you might have Vista 64 bit (do you?) You may have to change a BIOS setting to enable booting from CD or even emulate IDE over SATA but this is their test tool. http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?groupid=603&lang=en shows this version. There is also some confusion where a person does not try the Windows version on Vista 32 bit. I found that to work fine. Bob

On some drive/controller configurations it won't display the SMART attributes; but, the error scan will simply read the entire drive at the sector level. It will take over an hour to check a 500GB drive; but, even one red box is notice of impending failure and I recommend running it about once a year for safety.

But it had to do with mounting and reading a CD in DOS. So please tell more. What program do you mean? What do you want to do with it? And a link to releevant info (like a manual, if possible) on the Internet, please

The program I was trying to use is called Data Lifeguard Tools from Western Digital the windows version didn't work so I was going to try the dos, but there seems to be a problem running this too.

What I needed was the Diagnostics program it installed without a problem. I can be so silly at times. Thanks everybody for helping me out and sorry for wasting time.

Having downloaded the freebie suggested, I find my HD is in good health,and NO I will not download a Reg-cleaner again,as I think this caused the problem {:o( Manny

HD platter surfaces are extremly sensitive, if the heads crashed on a platter it'd likely ruin the entire drive. To check a drive, right-click the drive icon, click on Properties, then on the Tools tab. Click on Error Checking to test for bad sectors and other problems. As you now know, there's more extensive checking programs, but you were concernend about surface damage and this'll check for that.
