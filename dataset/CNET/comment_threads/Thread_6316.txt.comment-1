Believing that the sector map is used by the operating system to determine where (track & sector) to put a block of data I would suspect that RAID-1 should be able to be moved as the controller was &quot;just&quot; writing each block to two disks at the same time.
Putting either disk in a new system and recreating the mirror should be straight forward.
When it comes to RAID-0 the game gets complicated as there are 'stripe width&quot; issues as well as track & sector assignments to be considered.
Is there standardization among implementations?
Will a 250G 2 disk RAID-0 array from an Intel mobo be readable in an AMD system?
(I'm looking for some lost legal document images on dead systems with on board PATA RAID controllers).
