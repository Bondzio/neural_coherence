You can install another wireless router in your home office.
This router can be configured to forward dhcp requests to your main router.
Most routers come with a built-in switch with 4 to 8 ports.
You can run patch cables to the switch from the devices.
The cable drop from the other route can still be a back-up method.
But you would still need a switch to split the connection with either method.
