<s> I've noticed that some external hard drives have a port to connect AC power and then a seperate port for the USB. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what the power slot is for? </s>
<s> I know that it's meant for an adaptor to be pluged into, but I though USB ports can provide power as well as transfer data. </s>
<s> Just curious. </s>
<s> I've had a drive for some time that has both and I've always just pluged the USB cable into the laptop. </s>
<s> Thanks for any information you guys can give. </s>
<s> All of the 3.5&quot; hard drives in external enclosures I've seen require more power than the USB ports can provide. </s>
<s> Some 2.5&quot; laptop drives in external enclosures can run off the power from one USB channel but for larger drives...probably 80GBs or 100GBs and above require power from 2 USB ports ...they have a &quot;Y&quot; cable and can also run off AC adapters too. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Most USB Devices take a few watts, maybe 4-5 max. </s>
<s> But Hard drives can take as much as 25 watts. </s>
