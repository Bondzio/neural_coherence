I need some advice .... What would be a good/high quality internal HD for my iBook?
I'd like to spend around $100-150, and want to have something that is higher quality, very reliable, and fast!
Don't need a huge HD, maybe 120 GB max.
I'm more concerned with the quality than the size.
My computer is an iBook G4 (purchased June 2004), running OS X 10.4.11.
I'm also adding a one GB stick of RAM.
Thanks!
