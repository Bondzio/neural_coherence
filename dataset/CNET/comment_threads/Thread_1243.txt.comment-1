Then whenever I switched My All in one PC showed that &quot;New Hardware found&quot; and when I open its interference software It display massage &quot;No HP Device found HP Solution center is now closing&quot; When I again tried to install the AIO(ALL IN ONE) In the Step 3/4 it showes Device dected and after 15 mins It says &quot;Setup Failed&quot; .I approched HP Help center but is was useless then on 3rd November I Restored my PC.
After that I again Installed AIO It worked well Then again in Jan It showed same error Then i approched HP Service center They repared my AIO and said every thing will be all right.But I am getting same meaasge &quot;Setup Fail&quot;.
