&quot;Warning: After you convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk, local access to the dynamic disk is limited to Windows 2000 and Windows XP Professional.
Additionally, after you convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk, the dynamic volumes cannot be changed back to partitions.
You must first delete all dynamic volumes on the disk and then convert the dynamic disk back to a basic disk.
If you want to keep your data, you must first back up the data or move it to another volume.&quot; http://www.petri.co.il/basic_vs_dynamic_disks.htm and other places.
