<s> I have a 5 year old sound card that has started to give me issues when it is in my computer. </s>
<s> Its a sound blaster audigy 1. </s>
<s> I am running vista 32 bit home premium and whenever I try to use this card windows locks up and gives me a blue screen. </s>
<s> Does this sound like a driver issue or maybe the card is going bad? </s>
<s> Tell us what you installed for the motherboard drivers. </s>
<s> The drivers that came with vista are the motherboard drivers. </s>
<s> I installed the latest drivers from creative for the pci sound card. </s>
<s> Try the latest motherboard drivers from your machine's maker and NOT Microsoft. </s>
