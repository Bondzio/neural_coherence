I have an ip camera that i want to place 400ft from the house in a building and I want to connect via Access point or wireless router.
I have a motorola/netopia 3347-02 wireless router in the house currently as well as a Belkin f5d9231-4.
Is this possible or am i dreaming?
any guidence would be appreciated.
