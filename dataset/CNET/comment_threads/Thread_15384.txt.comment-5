Try reseating the IDE cable and power cable.
The system can get &quot;stale&quot; either from hot/cold cycling.
Try another IDE cable set as well if possible the cost is very low.
Also, understand high density HDs when mounted too close together get the areal spacing whacked due to the heat build-up, its an after-effect from running a long time(usage).
The Seagate HD could be heading to a failure so bck-up more often as a safety measure.
Be prepared to use your warranty if under 3-5yrs(I forget).
