A cheap solution is to get your PCI TV card and connect the composite input to the output of the DISH decoder box. There may be an internal PC Card for such, but I don't want to know the price. Bob

I have a USB Tuner that I connect to laptops and desktops. Or you can spend some bucks on a tuner card with S-video inputs. But the resolution of a PC monitor is nowhere near a good TV.

As for your tuner card, I tried Hauppauge 1196 WinTV HVR-1250 PCI Express Hybrid High Definition TV Tuner Card and it worked great. I dont know if that is the version you tried but good luck.
