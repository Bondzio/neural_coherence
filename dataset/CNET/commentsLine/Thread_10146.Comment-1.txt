hi, i'm about to start my undergrad this fall and hopefully major in industrial engineering.
every living fibre in me is telling me to get the new macbook but i can't help but wonder if a pc would be much more suitable for my studies.
i'll be using the laptop mainly for music, movies and work.
so, mac or pc?
