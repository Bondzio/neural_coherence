Yeah I will have to get True Image.
and as far as the driver disk goes...Um thats in the garbage.
I got this tower from my moms boss, which was originally configured for RAID 0 and they wanted to wipe the drives so I had put an 3.5 in it until they gave me the drives back.
Then I used crummy easus disk copy to get it on one of the original disks, then I decided to shoot for RAID.
I know I painted myself into a corner.
LOL.
These two drives were originally manufactured for RAID.
Yeah I do alot of that.....&quot;Cross your fingers and restart.&quot; Thanks dude.
You cleared a lot up for me.
