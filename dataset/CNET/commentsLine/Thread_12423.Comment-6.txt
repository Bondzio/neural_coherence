hi all just a update have taken the battery out and left the sytem without power for 5min power up and it said error on cmos so i hit f1 to contiunie and now it wornt boot.
i have taken the cd drive out so there is only the hd connected but the thing still wont boot tried cs master and slave but it just hangs with a black screen after post.
started changing setting in the bios the only way it will boot is if i disable &quot;sil3512a sata raid rom&quot; ???
i have tried the hd on cs and master but unless its on slave it wont boot and its the only drive connected to i ide any ways loaded windows super slow installed all the driver etc and its still slow egg timer etc open task manager and the cpu is sitting 5% is soon as i move the task bar window the cpu goes to 100% for a second and then idles i have ran the wd hardisk tool and it past all the s.m.a.r.t test so don't think its the hd i am about to run memtest and see what that says also checked for any blow caps and i cant see any leaks or swelling etc
