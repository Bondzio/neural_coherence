<s> What would be better - use an old win98 machine, get one of those marketed 'kids computers&quot; or actually buy one of those &quot;$299&quot; bait and switch models? </s>
<s> Looking to spend the minimum for a system useable for a couple of years - under $500 total. </s>
<s> I don't have the specs on the win98 right now, but it was a top of the line system in 1998(K5or6? </s>
<s> AMD chip), designed for scientific research/big number crunching, and has a monitor that works, network card, etc. </s>
<s> My 4 year old twins are using computers at pre-school already and keep wanting to use my Dell Inspiron E1705 laptop - no way! </s>
<s> They have an older brother in another household with a playstation - so they want to play games too (as does he when he visits). </s>
<s> If it was just the little ones, I think I might be able to make my old windows 98 machine do, but I don't know if it could handle Power Rangers Super Legends (what they are begging for). </s>
<s> ADVICE? </s>
<s> Since that game is on the PS2, just put it there -&gt; http://www.us.playstation.com/PS2/Games/Power_Rangers_Super_Legends As to the 299 desktops, I'm unsure what you mean by bait and switch. </s>
<s> I walk into these stores put the box in the cart, wheel it up to the cash register and check out. </s>
<s> Isn't that how it works? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm very doubtful that you would find much software on the market today that will run on a Windows 98 computer. </s>
<s> I personally am not familiar with &quot;Power Rangers Super Legends&quot; but if it's a recent game it almost certainly will require more computer than an old Win98 machine. </s>
<s> You would probably be restricted to whatever software you already have for it, or any you could locate. </s>
<s> As far as the &quot;$299&quot; computers, in my experience their upgrade -ability is usually limited or non-existent, so if you can't get what you want up-front with one, you're probably not going to be doing many improvements in the future. </s>
<s> As a parent, I prefer not to have video game consoles in my house - too many issues. </s>
<s> The PS2 is at the older brother's house, not mine - he just visits. </s>
<s> I'm not a total grinch - I will let the boys have a few games since they want them so bad, but only on a computer where I have more control. </s>
<s> Besides, I bought a nice TV for the family room because I want to watch a movie or the news in the evening - not level 5 of Dragonslayer XV. </s>
<s> I'm asking about the &quot;realistic&quot; system requirements because I don't play games or know anyone else that does. </s>
<s> I need help with what is a useable low level system these days, because I haven't used something less than a powerhouse for the past decade. </s>
<s> What I need for GIS applications is extreme overkill for surfing the web or word processing. </s>
<s> My problem with $299 computers? </s>
<s> - probably nothing for a knowledgable user like on this board, but they are advertised towards the first time buyer/novice user, who often gets taken advantage of when they go to the store to get it. </s>
<s> I've heard the same story too many times from my freshman students, and especially elderly friends and family members. </s>
<s> Bait and Switch - advertise a very low price machine and sell an expensive one. </s>
<s> If it is a useable out of the box system they only have extremely limited numbers in stock with no rainchecks, or if in stock, it is most often a stripped down machine that requires an additional $500+ to be min. </s>
<s> functional. </s>
<s> If you understand what comes (or doesn't come) with a $299 system they can be great deals for the knowledgeable. </s>
<s> I'm upset that salesmen pounce on the gulliable first time buyer who comes in thinking they are going to walk out the door with a brand new $300 computer fully loaded and ready to go and either steer them to a much more expensive system (usually put on a store branded credit card at 24.9% interest)which is what happens to my students, or sell them expensive monitors, keyboards, printers, etc and unneeded peripherals and software . </s>
<s> Last spring salesmen at one of the big elecronics stores convinced my widowed neighbor that she had to have an expensive monitor, joysticks and gamepads, wireless everything, wireless networking, etc - OH -and of course the $299 system couldn't take the network,video, and sound cards she &quot;had to&quot; have, so she ended up with an upgraded system suitable for a serious gamer - all because she mentioned her grandkids visit at the holidays. </s>
<s> Basically they sold her the system they wanted. </s>
<s> Thousands of wasted dollars for a little 69 y.o. </s>
<s> grandmother, first time user, who wanted to be able to receive email from her family,print photographs, and look up medical information on the web. </s>
<s> The real kicker - when she got concerned about the escalating price - they threw in a &quot;free&quot; printer - which is absolutely lousy at both text and color printing. </s>
<s> Yes, probably one of her kids (500 miles away) should have gone with her, but I resent the fact that novice computer users, who often have the least money to waste, are misled by ads in newspaper flyers and fall prey to these shady practices. </s>
<s> Some of these guys give used car salesmen a run for their money. </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure the old win98 could go up to Win2000 (if I still have system disks for that version somewhere). </s>
<s> Not that there are that many programs left that run on 2000 either probably. </s>
<s> We just kept it around at win98 to run some old programs, and it is the trusty back-up everytime the new ones crash and burn - it always works! </s>
<s> One of the two hard drives had to be replaced when it was 18 months old - no other problems since then. </s>
<s> It is the indestructable beast - built in a local computer shop in Tucson, it has outlasted 3 newer workstations (2 Dells and a HP) - that is why I thought it could withstand 4 year olds. </s>
<s> If I knew a good computer repair place around here I'd buy a used XP, but I'm in a small town and have not been impressed with the one I know in town - their used computers are really overpriced. </s>
<s> That is why if I don't use the win98, I'm looking for something new but cheap for the kids- I'm probably going to have to buy on-line. </s>
<s> For games I have to write that today you want a Core 2 Duo, 2GB RAM and the Nvidia 8800 or better display card. </s>
<s> At 99 bucks for a PS2 I think this is the better solution and it has that game they want. </s>
<s> As to the bait and switch I must be not going to the right stores. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks for the system rec's If I went with the PS2 to play games,- maybe 10 hours a month-, I would have buy a 2nd TV to sit in the same family room as our other TV, which we only watch a couple of hours a day anyway. </s>
<s> To use it as a TV, would require dropping new coax - not easy in a old house and get a second sat. </s>
<s> receiver and monthly fee. </s>
<s> No cost savings at all. </s>
<s> The game station won't enable them to use the internet, educational software, or do their homework assignments -yes, preschoolers have homework now!- that even the old win98 computer will. </s>
<s> The game use is really the least important reason I'm getting them their own computer. </s>
<s> BUT, if I do have a system which can play some games, then it might cut down on the whining from their brother when he visits, since it seems he can't go a weekend without constant TV and video games. </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=AVC-1400&cpc=SCH It was 10 bucks and solved that issue. </s>
<s> So I can see 99 bucks for the PS2, 10 bucks for that and whatever for the game. </s>
<s> Far cheaper than what a &quot;gamer PC&quot; will cost. </s>
