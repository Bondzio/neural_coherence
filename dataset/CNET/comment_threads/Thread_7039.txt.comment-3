...and just a search away too.
Search : abit av8 http://www.abit-usa.com/products/mb/techspec.php?categories=1&model=175 Listed specification shows support for an AGP 4x/8x complaint graphics card, and Athlon 64 X2 CPU.
X1300 comparison : http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/graphics/charts.html Places it right at the bottom in almost every game, but as long as the &quot;few&quot; games&quot; are at low res, low AA/AF, and a few years old..it might (just) scrape through.
ATI X1600/ nV 6600GT offer far more power (and longer game lifespan) for a little extra outlay.
Good luck, GeeBee.
