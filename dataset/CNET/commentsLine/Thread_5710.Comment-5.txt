the practical &quot;green advice&quot; for frigs in general if over 5yrs.
old, pitch it or donate.
don't move it to the garage for liquids coolers but actually get rid of it.
-or- at least use the newest frigs you got to do the same.
the energy saving matters over time but may not for short usage, like in a summer cabin/cottage but again if you're really out there any saving is worth it.
i wonder what they say about those old gmc(frigitaire) models that ran for 30yrs.+?
at my house meter it barely turns, my consumption is as low as it goes.
but, i'm sure the frig is the biggest power user after the electrical water heater.
