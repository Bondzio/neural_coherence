<s> I just purchased an HP n7060m media center PC. </s>
<s> And, boy, it's a chore adding other XP-compatible software to it. </s>
<s> I guess HP does not want you to add your own collection of (Xp-compatible) software products to it. </s>
<s> Since it will not recognize my Cakewalk Music Creator 2003 software, does anybody have a suggestion of another music-type creator software product that I can buy that will work with the HP n7060m? </s>
<s> Thanks, R </s>
<s> What do you mean &quot;wont recognize my Cakewalk Music Creator 2003 software&quot;? </s>
<s> What error do you get? </s>

<s> Perhaps it is because of http://www.cakewalk.com/Support/DX9.ASP Check to see if you have Direct X 9. </s>
<s> Type (in RUN) dxdiag then click Ok. Or, maybe Register and ask Cakewalk Support about that problem. </s>
<s> What exactly is hapening with Cakewalk Music Creator 2003. </s>
<s> Please be aware that it is most likely not a HP issue. </s>
<s> I can probably help you. </s>
<s> Here is one suggestion on the cakewalk forum http://www.cakewalk.com/forum/tm.asp?m=430644 The thread is related to the version of Direct X that you have installed. </s>
<s> For reference the 7060 comes with DX9 as is standard with Windows XP SP2 and Media Center 2005 (basicly Windows XP Pro with SP2. </s>
<s> I would search Cakewalk's user support forum for help with their products. </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestion...and it worked...to a point. </s>
<s> I got Cakewalk Creator 2003 to load onto my HP m7060n system, however, the recording function does not work. </s>
<s> When I try to record with a microphone - no sound is measured on the volume meter. </s>
<s> I get a message that my computer's Realtek sound card is not compatible with Cakewalk Creator 2003 drivers. </s>
<s> Am I sol? </s>
<s> Is there a driver I can download from HP or Cakewalk? </s>
<s> Very frustrating. </s>
