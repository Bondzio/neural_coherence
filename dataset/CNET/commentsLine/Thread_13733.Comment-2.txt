you are fighting simple laws of physics here.
more chips on the bus means more capacitance per device so there can be a slowing.
i'm going to decline explaining physics, electronics in detail here.
2. that's a new term for sata ports.
when you write a new term, explain it.
3. and 4. you want the 1066 support and as to overclocking i see too many hit the repair counters in overclocked mode, we set it back and it works again.
$120 charge to set it back is steep so take this as a free lessson.
