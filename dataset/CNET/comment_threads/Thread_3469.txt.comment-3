Either the hardware is not USB 2 functional or incorrect drivers are installed.
Make sure all drivers for the MB devices are up to date.
Sometimes Windows does not install the correct ones for some reason.
If the hardware is compatible and the USB 2 drivers are on the system but not installed, you can sometimes just remove and redetect the USB components.
Windows should find and use the best drivers.
Good luck.
