1.1.1	No I didnt do it .	St
1.1.2	I got a Gateway pc from my boss .	St
1.1.3	He formatted the hd so the & quot ; work related info & quot ; would be gone .	St
1.1.4	I know what formatting does and I need help to restore it .	St
1.1.5	It is a 20gb Quantum .	St
1.1.6	It had win98 on it and also drivers for cdrom , usb and ethernet .	St
1.1.7	I have a 2gb hd with win 98 on it but no such drivers ( base system ) I want to run the 2gb as the primary and the 20 gb as the slave so I can reinstall the OS on it .	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	You want restore the 20gbs that was formated ?	Ques
1.2.2	You want to install ( I 'm guessing ) Windows 98 on 2gb of space ?	Ques
1.2.3	Does Windows 98 fit on 2gbs ?	Ques
1.3.1	So all you need to do is boot your Windows 98 CD or diskette and install Windows 98 .	St
1.3.2	Install instructions are never given by me since we have the internet and a thousand pages on installing Windows .	St

1.4.1	I have 2 harddrives .	St
1.4.2	The one that is usefull is a 2gb harddrive that has win98 and a handful of other programs on it .	St
1.4.3	Dont ask me how they got all of that on a little hd .	St
1.4.4	My problem is that the 20gb harddrive i got was formatted .	St
1.4.5	I use the 2gb to boot the gateway system that the 20gb came in , and Im trying to create a new operating system on the 20gb .	St
1.4.6	I need to find new drivers so I can use the cdrom , and I need to find either win98 or xp to put on the 20gb after I get the new drivers installed .	St
1.4.7	The problem at hand is the jumpers on the back of the hd 's .	St
1.4.8	The 2gb has 3 sets of prongs but no jumper .	St
1.4.9	The 20gb has 4 sets of prongs with the jumper on the second set away from the ribbon .	St
1.4.10	I want to know where the jumper needs to be so that the 2gb harddrive is the primary and the 20gb harddrive is the slave .	St
1.5.1	I have 2 computers .	St
1.5.2	The first one is a Gateway Desktop pc that was made in 2000 .	St
1.5.3	It is designed for win98 and has the 20gb harddrive .	St
1.5.4	The hd in this computer was formatted by a guy that I work with .	St
1.5.5	The second & quot ; donor & quot ; computer is a no name brand built by my cousins husband .	St
1.5.6	It has a 2gb harddrive that has win98 , microsoft office and a handful of other programs .	St
1.5.7	He uses winzip to fit everything on it .	St
1.5.8	I am trying to rebuild the Gateway using the small hd from the donor to boot the system , then installing win98 or xp on the 20gb harddrive .	St
1.5.9	I cant get the system to show the two hd 's .	St
1.5.10	It will boot from the little one but it only shows that I have one , not two .	St
1.5.11	I put the jumper on the 2gb in the first spot closest to the ribbon .	St
1.5.12	The 20gb I have put the jumper in the second spot .	St
1.5.13	I am stumped .	St
1.5.14	Also , the little hd only has drivers for video and 3.5 floppy .	St
1.5.15	I need to find win98 drivers for cdrom , usb and soundblaster sound card .	St
1.5.16	Any advice or suggestions would be great .	Polite
1.5.17	Thanks	Polite
1.6.1	Today we use 80 CONDUCTOR IDE CABLES ( see google.com about that ) and both drives are jumped to Cable Select .	St
1.6.2	Even a 2000 era PC should have that cable and use those jumper settings .	St
1.6.3	The CDROM is never a CDROM DRIVER issue .	St
1.6.4	When you install the motherboard drivers , the CDROM works .	St
1.6.5	Same for USB .	St
1.6.6	Which leaves the soundblaster .	St
1.6.7	Google is your friend here .	St
1.6.8	The soundblaster drivers are a bit too easy to find .	St
1.6.9	Bob	St
