Thanks for responding.
Actually I couldn't get that far for a while (no screens ever came up so F2 didn't do anything).
After a few tries I got back into bios and changed the boot preference back to hard drive.
However, now when the screen comes up asking me to choose which drive I want to run, I get Vista or &quot;a previous version of windows&quot; whereas I used to get Vista or XP as my choices.
But worse, the arrow keys don't work on that screen, so the Vista option is highlighted and I can't change it, so after 25 seconds it tries to boot Vista automatically, triggering the loop.
Also on this screen is an option to press F8, however doing so also does nothing.
So at this point Vista is looping and I am no longer able to choose XP, which I had been doing for a week or so.
I'd prefer not to take it in for repair because where I live that means a week.
