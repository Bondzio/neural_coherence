1.4.1	That 's a rather strange message .	St
1.4.2	In fact , it 's unique .	St
1.4.3	Google has never heard from it .	St
1.4.4	Your post is the only one on the whole Internet that mentions it .	St
1.4.5	So I suppose it 's some other message .	St
1.4.6	Kees	St
1.5.1	There has to be something wrong with the wording in the original post regards the message , that makes mo sense .	St
1.6.1	No sense , but I assume you got the drift .	St
1.7.1	well thats the same i was thinking , i google it and anything came up , i will take a pic and post exactly what it says .	St

1.9.3	This is the exact message and it has been there for over 3 hours and nothing happens , Have anyone had this screen before ?	Ques
1.10.1	http : //www.tomshardware.com/forum/302636-30-updating-bios-flash OK. Look around for ANY device that is attached .	St
1.10.2	CD/DVD/USB and all hard drives and after you power off , disconnect and unplug those .	St
1.10.3	The update should only be happening if the BIOS detected the update file on some device .	St
1.10.4	If not , you get to exchange the motherboard .	St
1.10.5	Bob	St
1.11.1	could it be the motherboard that is dead ?	Ques
1.11.2	in case i need to replace the motherboard will i have to install the system again ?	Ques
1.12.1	If you replace the motherboard with exactly the same model , everything will continue to work .	St
1.12.2	But if you replace it with another type , you 'll most likely have to do a completely clean install from the Windows disk .	St
