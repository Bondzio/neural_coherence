hi, linkit, thanks for the reply.
i just checked, and all computers on the network are set to obtain the ip address automatically.
this morning i booted up one of the previously-failed computers first, and it still obtained x.x.x.151.
afterward, when i booted the 'always okay' computer to answer your question, sure enough it obtained x.x.x.101.
i'm not really comfortable trying to use the manual setup under properties of the network connection, but wonder if it's possible simply to preassign ip addresses for the four computers on the network, or would this drive the router nuts, trying to use its dhcp for this?
