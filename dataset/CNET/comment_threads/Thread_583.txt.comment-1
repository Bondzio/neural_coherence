I'm in the market for a new desktop and would like some advice on making the right selection.
My primary use is for viewing and editing photos using Photoshop.
I plan on upgrading to the most current edition of Photoshop along with the purchase of the desktop.
I won't be upgrading my monitor.
Could you make some recomendations as far as system requirements to help me select a system?
