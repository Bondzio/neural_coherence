It's pretty difficult right now to decide if to go with either the FX 57 or the XP 4800.
On one hand the FX 57 blows the XP 4800 when it comes to gaming(single application) but on the other pretty soon games will start taking advantage of the Dual Core.
For gamers like me the bottom line is, Frames Per Second, but if the games start taking advantage of dual core procesors I presume that then the single cores will run them a lot slower.
The question is, at this time, what's better?
Will the gaming industry start taking advantage of the dual core soon, or will it take another year or two?
Is it better to buy the XP 4800 and wait for the games to come out, or get the FX 57 and possibly have to replace it in one year?
Is the difference in performance large enough to choose the FX 57?
