1.1.1	I recently purchased a Dynex 2-port USB 2.0 card for my desktop at home.	St
1.1.2	Looking at the system requirements, It needed an OS from Win98SE to Windows XP SP1, no mention of SP2.	St
1.1.3	I didn't think that was a big deal at first.	St
1.1.4	I installed the card and when I rebooted Windows, Windows XP went through the whole &quot;detected new hardware&quot; thing in the lower right hand corner of the screen.	St
1.1.5	I even installed the driver CD that came with the card.	St
1.1.6	A couple of days later I tested out the new card by plugging in a flash drive into it.	St
1.1.7	No response.	St
1.1.8	I plugged the flash drive into one of the old USB 1.1 ports and the flash drive came on just fine.	St
1.1.9	I wouldn't have thought there would be a huge technological difference between SP1 and SP2.	St
1.1.10	I thought the Service Packs only dealt with Security issues.	St
1.1.11	I'm going to put the USB card on a Win98SE machine that I have that I use for emergencies and to play old PC games to see if the card works there.	St
1.1.12	Was there issues in the past with some Hardware not working when moving from SP1 to SP2?	St
1.1.13	I currently have Windows XP Home that came with SP2.	St
1.2.1	But let's check something first.	St
1.2.2	Tell me which motherboard driver package you are using.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	XP OS doesn't supply USB drivers, though it may have in earlier releases.	St
1.3.2	that's a function of the mtrbd.	St
1.3.3	support CD or USB driver from the support website.	St
1.3.4	Plus, it has to be enabled in bios.	St
1.3.5	Then you have to if so supplied install the USB cards own driver, I have found some cheaper USB cards or devices simply problematic and only the &quot;generic USB&quot; driver does any good from the http://www.usbman.com website.	St
1.3.6	Check all that... FYI - SP2 dealt with alot more than security, but it should also include SP1(or portions needed) as part of the total install package.	St
1.3.7	tada =====Willy	St
1.4.1	After the computer was re-booted a few times, the USB 2.0 card decided to work on my Win XP machine.	St
1.4.2	I'm not entirely sure why it finally decided to work, but I'm happy it did.	Res
