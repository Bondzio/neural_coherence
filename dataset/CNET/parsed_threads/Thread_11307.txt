<s> Hello,the question i have is how do they troubleshoot deskjet printers hardware problems.do they use a cd that tells them,or do they use scopes,multimeters,etc? </s>
<s> just curious on there process. </s>
<s> thanks,edward </s>
<s> The brutal reality is that in the US even a 200 buck printer may &quot;cost too much to fix&quot; so such diagnostics and tools and even a service manual will never be found. </s>
<s> Small parts like ink cartridges are always replacable. </s>
<s> The move to a disposable printer grinds some people the wrong way but it explains why nearly nothing is available as to manuals and diagnostics. </s>
<s> In closing, even if you found what part you needed, it's not in stock. </s>
<s> Cheers, bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob i appreciate the explanation. </s>
