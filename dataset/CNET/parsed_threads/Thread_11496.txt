<s> Ive been confused for a while. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade my house with wireless. </s>
<s> Looking at reviews from CNet both Belkin Pre N and the Netgear RangMax WPN824 both have excellent ratings. </s>
<s> My computers have regular g cards in them, and my laptop (Dell Inspiron 700m) has a built in Intel Pro 2200 b/g card in it. </s>
<s> It is the main focus for connection since its what i use most. </s>
<s> The reason i want to go with such great range routers is that on some days of the week i need connection in an area that is 150-200 feet away. </s>
<s> Any help or advice would be appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks, Chandan </s>
<s> The best advise is to stay away from mix-and-match. </s>
<s> You are better off running the same brand of router and card(s). </s>
<s> I use the Belkin preN and have had no problems with it other than interferrence with like-frequency wireless phones. </s>
<s> That was an easy problem to take care of. </s>
<s> Range with the Belkin preN is very good and yes, it does support older/non-preN cards, however if you want to maximize your range and speed, then use preN cards with the router. </s>
<s> Ben </s>
<s> I bought and returned two wireless routers to Fry's because they wouldn't work for me. </s>
<s> The CSR suggested Linksys and I bought one. </s>
<s> They are pricey, but the support is good in my experience. </s>
<s> I got the WRT 54GS. </s>
<s> and added a couple of antennae from freeantenns.com . </s>
