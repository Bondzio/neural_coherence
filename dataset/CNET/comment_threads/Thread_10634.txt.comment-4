Yes, it's very technical.
Leaving your wifi set to wep could have some one hijack that connection and SPOOF the mac address of your device that won't connect.
The next step is to change the SSID and move directly to WPA-PSK to lock them out.
Remember I have only a few details to work with so share if you did another often than latest firmware, mixed mode, SSID broadcasting, WPA... Good luck, Bob
