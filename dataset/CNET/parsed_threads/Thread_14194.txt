<s> I have a Belkin N+ wireless router for the convenience of our guests. </s>
<s> A couple of our guests aren't able to connect to the internet, and the common denominator is that they are using Apple products. </s>
<s> One is an I-Pad. </s>
<s> Other guests with Windows laptops are getting on the internet okay. </s>
<s> I have the network set up with WPA2-PSK security. </s>
<s> Does anyone have an idea as to what could be wrong? </s>
<s> I feel bad that these people can't connect. </s>
<s> Set the router per this forums suggestions then pull back to 802.11g and WPA. </s>
<s> I have never had this fail me when an Apple was involved. </s>

<s> Thanks for your response, Bob. </s>
<s> I'm surprised and dismayed at the idea of downgrading the settings of the router. </s>
<s> Kind of negates the advantage of getting the latest and the greatest equipment, which is why I bought this router, per the recommendations of the CNET editors. </s>
<s> Wouldn't switching to wireless G compromise the increased range and speed of the newer N standard? </s>
<s> Same with changing from the more secure WPA2 to the less secure WPA security? </s>
<s> But WPA is still tough to crack. </s>
<s> And you can mix and match the advice to see which item it is that is causing an issue. </s>
<s> It could be the old hidden SSID issue but you didn't write that. </s>
<s> Once in a while I encounter a client that won't try something because &quot;what I have now should work.&quot; Then I know that they will have to buy a new router. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...to try one fix at a time. </s>
<s> I could try switching to WPA and see what happens. </s>
<s> By hidden SSID, do you mean hiding the network's name from view? </s>
<s> I haven't done that. </s>
<s> I want our guests to see our network's name show up on their computer, then enter the password. </s>
<s> Would you recommend a better router to use? </s>
<s> The important thing to me was getting the longest range, to reach our whole building, which this one does. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> My advice was &quot;everything I change to be as compatible with the most things.&quot; The advice at the top of this forum is well worn advice. </s>
<s> Don't hide the SSID. </s>
<s> It's not adding security and in some setups folk find the connection drops out. </s>
<s> OK, OK yes this means there is some driver or other item that is showing there is a bug but it is our choice to &quot;go with what works and is secure.&quot; WPA has no ready exploit that we know. </s>
<s> Yes there is that tool that you can run and then take a day's reading then pay for a cloud service to crack it in a few days but this is far beyond what your average kiddie will do since &quot;they have to pay for it.&quot; Hope this helps and remember to try the latest router firmware too. </s>

<s> In regard to the suggested changes in settings for the router I got to thinking that everything I've read about the different wireless standards says that the newer ones are backward compatible with the older ones. </s>
<s> Is there more to the story? </s>
<s> In checking the router's settings, there are three settings for the Wireless Mode switch; N only, G only, or N+G+B. </s>
<s> It was set on N+G+B. </s>
<s> Seems like the correct setting would be N+G+B if you wanted to accommodate all users. </s>
<s> But my printer would not play with my first N router on that setting. </s>
<s> I had to set the router to G mode. </s>
<s> Since there was no firmware update I returned that model and the next model is fine. </s>
<s> I've encountered folk that get stuck on &quot;this should work&quot; rather than experiment to see what works. </s>
