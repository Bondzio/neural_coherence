1.2.1	Sounds like the usual failures .	St
1.2.2	These are usually USB powered so I carry in my kit bag a USB & quot ; Y & quot ; cable to get more power to such drives .	St
1.2.3	AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT ON LAPTOPS to be on AC POWER when using such things .	St
1.2.4	For DESKTOPS be sure to try the REAR USB PORTS ( which have more power and something else I will skip discussing . )	St
1.2.5	If that fails do n't panic yet .	St
1.2.6	Order a new USB enclosure and move the drive to the new enclosure if you must save your files .	St
1.2.7	If you fret about the warranty then exercise that but your files wo n't be coming back !	St
