<s> Hello, I've never posted here before, but I'm hoping for some help. </s>
<s> I'm looking at getting a netbook for travel purposes, and just to not have to boot up my bulky 5yr old Toshiba laptop all the time. </s>
<s> I just want to be able to do quick emails/basic web stuff on the road, and the big thing is I want to be able to do Skype video calls. </s>
<s> So, my question is, what netbook do you recommend/not recommend for this? </s>
<s> I want a built-in webcam, too. </s>
<s> There's a special on an e-machines brand right now I was thinking about. </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> Look at the slight faster netbooks with that ION chipset. </s>
<s> Figure closer to 500 for this. </s>
<s> About 3 weeks ago I purchased an Acer Aspire one at Costco for $300. </s>
<s> They have a 90 day trail during which you can return it. </s>
<s> It has 1GB Ram and 160 GB hard drive. </s>
<s> I want it for travel, checking emails, Skype, etc. </s>
<s> I love it. </s>
<s> Skype works great and connects easily to the Internet. </s>
<s> I am really happy with it. </s>
<s> I have used and HP laptop for 6 years and tis Acer is waaaay better! </s>
<s> Jim </s>
<s> I forgot to mention that the battery lasts 7 to 8 hours. </s>
<s> It is a 6-cell. </s>
<s> The netbook weighs less than 3 lbs. </s>
<s> It has Intel Atom processor, Windows 7, 10.1 inch screen and is about 1 inch thick. </s>
<s> Jim </s>
<s> Runs audio Skype just fine. </s>
<s> I find it to falter when running a video chat. </s>
