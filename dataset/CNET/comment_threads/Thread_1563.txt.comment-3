Hurrah, managed to fix it, it was the connection between the fan and the CPU I took it apart and noticed that the holders for the CPU cooler felt slightly loose - (I had inserted the motherboard into the case by holding the big Zal man CPU cooler.
doh) Took it off and also noticed that what was once a very smooth and flat base to the CPU cooler is now what appeares to be slightly cracked with 2 raised lines running across it.. not good, but it was an expensive fan so i put some decent silver thermal paste on it instead of the thermal grease i used before and tightened everything up.
PC boots with the CPU at full speed without a problem.. hurrah.
I now I have an issue with installing 2Gb or ram instead of 1.5Gb, windows crashes on booting up even in safe mode, its started loading drivers and then dies.. it even does it with a drive with a clean install.. oh well at least i can wait to upgrade later this year or early 2007 when the upgrade paths become clearer and more benficial!
