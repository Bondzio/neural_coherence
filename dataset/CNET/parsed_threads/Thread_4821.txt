<s> I'm trying to help out a school with an LCD projector issue. </s>
<s> This is a Canon model VT695. </s>
<s> The lamp was becoming dim and eventually died. </s>
<s> We've tried replacing the lamp but no go. </s>
<s> We tried another lamp from (what we thought) was a known good spare projector but still no go. </s>
<s> What I am finding is that, when using an ohmmeter, I show no conductivity between any of the three connections even though the lamp is brand new out of the box. </s>
<s> Because we've tried two lamps, I'm not convinced it's a bulb issue but I don't know how these things work. </s>
<s> I am wondering if the ohmmeter check is not valid with these as perhaps they have some other way excite the gas in the bulb and do no use a filament. </s>
<s> Anyone know this? </s>
<s> TIA </s>
<s> The troubleshooting section of the manual for this projector seems to suggest a lamp housing or lamp cover error rather than the lamp itself. </s>
<s> This comes via a flashing LED lamp sequence. </s>
<s> I see nothing that senses proper seating of these components but the lack of filament continuity is puzzling. </s>
<s> I've found a micro-switch that detects that the cover is in place. </s>
<s> When I manually activate the switch, the project lamp comes on. </s>
<s> It appears that some small piece of the molded plastic cover is broken off. </s>
<s> I'll need to fashion something and attach it with PVC cement. </s>
<s> That might work. </s>
<s> Looks like we'll make a teacher happy and maybe this finding will help someone else. </s>
