The drive being replaced is marked &quot;ATA/IDE.&quot; Question: Must the replacement drive be ATA/IDE as well, or can it be ATA 3, or ATA 4, Ultra, etc.? Finding a replacement drive described as simply ATA/IDE has been difficult. Im unable to determine if my motherboard supports any of the variant interfaces.
