<s> I installed a Brother MFC 420CN successfully on my Netgear wireless router that both my iBook and Windows ME PC can see. </s>
<s> But after installation, a Brother HL-1435 laser printer and an HP Photoprinter 1100+ &quot;stopped&quot; according to Printer setup utility in OS X Panther. </s>
<s> I tried reinstalling the Brother laser driver but the iBook doesn't see it under USB in Printer setup utility. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be appreciated! </s>
<s> (iBook G4 running OS X 10.3.9, Netgear wireless G router, Brother MFC 420CN networked printer, local Brother HL-1435 laser printer and HP Photopriner 1100+ using USB) </s>
<s> when the print queue is &quot;stopped&quot; all that needs to be done is to &quot;start&quot; it again. </s>
<s> On the menubar or the icon bar of the printer window. </s>
<s> Occasionally, you will find a document that the printer just gives up on. </s>
<s> At that point it stops the queue. </s>
<s> Deleting the offending document and restarting the queue usually works. </s>
<s> This is probably not the problem in your case. </s>

<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Both local USB printers show &quot;stopped&quot; even though I was only trying to print to one when this started. </s>
<s> Restarting the document just seemed to put it back in the queue but it would eventually stop as before. </s>
<s> (Also tried restarting computer.) </s>
<s> Deleting both printers and trying to reinstall one doesn't work, as Printer Setup Utility no longer sees ANY USB drivers. </s>
<s> Interesting. </s>
<s> Even after running the installer for a printer, it no longer sees that printer? </s>
<s> Do a search for ALL files that contain the name of the offending printer, even a partial name, and delete everything found. </s>
<s> Reinstall. </s>
<s> You say that after &quot;starting&quot; again, the document just goes back in the queue and the queue stops. </s>
<s> Did you try deleting the document and starting with a an empty print spooler? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I tried every combination of deleting document and deleting printer and reinstalling driver, restarting print document. </s>
<s> What's most interesting is that not one, but TWO local USB printers were &quot;stopped&quot; after installation of network printer. </s>
<s> No document was being printed to one of those USB printers, only the laser. </s>
<s> Yet Printer Setup Utility shows both &quot;stopped.&quot; Are you suggesting I search for files with names of either USB printer and delete them? </s>
<s> That &quot;should&quot; ensure that a fresh installation will actually put the drivers onto the disk instead of just checking to see if the drivers have the same date. </s>
<s> Worth a try It is curious that both USB printers should stop though P </s>
