<s> I have an older IBM ThinkPad laptop. </s>
<s> It does not have USB ports, but it does have two PCMCIA ports. </s>
<s> 16 bit. </s>
<s> I have searched the net for a USB PCMCIA card but can't find a 16 bit type. </s>
<s> Plenty of 32 bit but no 16 bit. </s>
<s> Is there such an animal? </s>
<s> I'm going to cross post this for a little more exposure. </s>
<s> No one has found one yet. </s>
<s> See http://www.usbman.com for more details why but the reason is quite simple. </s>
<s> PCMCIA is at maximum some 8 megabytes a second whereas USB 2.0 is some 48 megabytes per second in burst mode. </s>
<s> No match. </s>
