They are looking to have 5 computers and possibly add one more, and a server. They want all of the computers to have access to the server since they will be using a POS system and right now the point of sale has different information on each computer (which is not a good thing).' The reason I am going with wireless is that they constantly move there displays and only one of the computers is in a permanent spot. Which equipment would you guys suggest for this setup? And what would be the ideal way to set it up to access the server? Thanks

In closing, try to keep all the WIFI products of the same make and the FIRMWARE and DRIVERS the latest. Bob

Businesses broadcasting their business (not to mention credit card numbers) over radio waves is rather risky.

''Businesses broadcasting their business (not to mention credit card numbers) over radio waves is rather risky. '' In your opinion then, wireless would not be ideal for retail, or would you just make sure the network is secure?
