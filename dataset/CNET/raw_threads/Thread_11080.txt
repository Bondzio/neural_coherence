I want to buy a 17 or 19 in. LCD, but I want it to have the glossy screen. What I mean by glossy screen the coating on the screen instead of it being matted, I want it to be glossy. I know the glossy lcd's are more prone to relecting, but I'm willing to sacrafice that for the better quality screen. I've found some of those monitors, but I'd like to know all the monitors that are available, so I can compare. Is there any where I can go that provides this info, or anyone out there willing to tell me. I've found a few monitors such as the Benq F71V+, and the NEC 1770GX, but I'd like to know all of them. Such as any samsung models, ect. I'm looking for an 8ms monitor, preferably the cheaper the better, but price isn't really a factor. Please help me, and information would be greatly appreciated!
