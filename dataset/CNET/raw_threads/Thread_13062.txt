4445	2	542709	5209402	5209365	BoringPaceman	9/27/11 3:40 PM	1.317138E12	thank you R Pro	The machine was bought 2 years ago, when i7 first came out and win 7 was still on beta. Should I upgrade to Win 7 64bit? Because 4gb ram is not enough memory to run multiple software simultaneously. If not, what are my other solutions? Thank you,

At no time has any of the 32 bit OSes given access to the full 4GB RAM. I noted the 2.0GB limit per app and about the only way around that and keep a 32 bit OS is to install some &quot;HYPERVISOR&quot; and run multiple instances of Windows XP. --&gt; What a mess. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor I guess we could do that.

How does one minimize the unnecessary program/software that window runs on the bg? It really irritates me that every time I have to manually 'force close' programs that I rarely use, but yet it is running in the bg. Thanks,
