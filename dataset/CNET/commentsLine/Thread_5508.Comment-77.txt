two maxtors, a wd and a hitachi.
in every instance, putting the drive in a new case worked.
i've been using icydock usb/esata cases for quite a while and love them.
they're a little pricey but worth every penny.
the most recent ones don't even use screws - you just pop the drive in and close the hinge.
i just revived a friend's drive doing the same and then used my preferred recovery software -- r-studio -- to retrieve the files -- he only lost 6 files out of 870gb of data.
if you really need an external drive, buy a good drive and a good case and make your own, preferably an esata one.
i have one i back up all my music and video files (1.6tb) to every couple of weeks and store at my office for safekeeping.
in between those off-site backups, i copy the most recent files to the cloud.
i use jungle disk, which in turn uses amazon's s3 cloud storage.
it costs a couple of bucks a month.
you can map a drive to it and just copy the files.
all of my non-media data files are replicated using dropbox and are on three separate computers and the cloud (and my iphone).
skip the freezer trick: the drive will likely only work for a few minutes then completely give up the ghost, and with large drives you won't be able to get any meaningful quantity of data off it before it fails again.
good luck!
