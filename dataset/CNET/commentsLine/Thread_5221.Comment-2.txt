here's the gps &quot;problems&quot; i've read.
both are limitations of gps technology but new to gps users may not know about the limitation and write these are glaring defects.
1. on power up, can take many minutes to lock onto satellites.
2. doesn't work indoors or in parking garages.
is that the problems?
