1.2.1	You have to set your bios to boot frome cd first and SATA hard second and remove the IDE drive from the boot menue , then install XP on the SATA drive from the install menue .	St
1.2.2	After the install is finished on the SATA drive you can delete the XP on the IDE drive if you want to .	St
1.2.3	You will heve to reinstall ALL of your software on the SATA drive , and use the IDE as a data drive .	St
