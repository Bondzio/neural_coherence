I downloaded firmware and flashed the drive. Now it Burns +R to DVD-ROM. Also it know supports double layer recording. How do you explain that ?? The reason for my post is because I did it such a long time ago that I have forgotten how to do it and do not want to brick my drive. I just want to play videos for family who still own old dvd players that do not support +R or -R.

If you want to discuss it, supply links to the firmware and the drive so I don't have to dig it up. The booktype and it's relationship to DVD(+/-R) media not playing is well discussed. It's not the solution and as such I will not discuss it. Why? It's a deadend. Bob
