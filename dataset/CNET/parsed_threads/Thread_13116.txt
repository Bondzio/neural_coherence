<s> Hello my WRE54G is giving me problems. </s>
<s> Whenever I try to log into the webpage to configure it (192.168.1.240) it does not load. </s>
<s> I have it wired to my router (WRT150N) and have tried accessing it from a Windows 7 wireless connection and a Windows Vista Ethernet connection. </s>
<s> But both can't access the page. </s>
<s> I have tried holding the reset button for 15 seconds and still the same thing. </s>
<s> I was able to access it before but had to reset it for some reasons... </s>
<s> Anyone with some help??? </s>
<s> Thanks, Tony </s>
<s> http://homesupport.cisco.com/en-us/wireless/lbc/WRE54G shows this is a range expander. </s>
<s> To access that after a reset we have to set it to pair with our router FIRST. </s>
<s> This is far from automatic. </s>
<s> &quot;If the wireless network is secured, you cannot use the Range Expanders Auto Configuration button.&quot; And I see if your PC is connecting to the router, you can't configure the range expander. </s>
<s> Ouch. </s>
<s> This one is a bit tough on owners. </s>
<s> I bet a lot get returned. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Turn off the router then turn on the extender. </s>
<s> Now reboot the PC and see if it picks up the extender and try the setup per the instructions. </s>
<s> At some point you can configure the extender and tell it how to connect to the wifi router. </s>

<s> &quot;Try this. </s>

<s> At some point you can configure the extender and tell it how to connect to the wifi router.&quot; The extender has a power plug and a Ethernet cable. </s>
<s> I might sound stupid, but I can see the extender in my wireless connections, but it fails to connect... </s>
<s> If I turn off the router where do I plug the Ethernet cable into? </s>
<s> I have been able to access it before but for some reason it stopped working and I cannot access it. </s>
<s> I usually access it by plugging the Ethernet cord into the back of the router, then just type in the IP address. </s>
<s> We can't run ethernet and wifi at the same time. </s>
<s> As to explaining all this I must decline. </s>
<s> I offer ideas on what I would try along with references to the manual. </s>
<s> In the FAQ from the maker the setup should work. </s>
<s> If not we call it defective and ask for a refund. </s>
<s> It's that simple. </s>
<s> If the makers can't get the instructions to the point we can use the products they deserve the returns. </s>
<s> Again, I used their FAQ and my experience to see if we could find another way to setup. </s>
<s> It's possible your LAN is not on that address range but I would be guessing that. </s>
<s> By using wifi and no router the extender may be reachable. </s>
