<s> I just installed a new Plextor DVD Burner PX-880SA, I used Nero to burn a data file, it said it burned successfully at 48X, when I put it back in to read it my XP system showed nothing in that drive. </s>
<s> I popped it in my laptop which runs Vista and it was there, any Ideas? </s>
<s> Did you create a simple Single Closed Session? </s>
<s> Or Multi-Session? </s>
<s> To keep it all compatible the simple closed single session is best. </s>
<s> No drag to CD/DVD method either. </s>
