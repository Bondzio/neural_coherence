i am having this same problem for five years.
some of the dvds that i can see the files mainly pix and video clips read cdfs under properties and others say udf.
i used roxio easy creator and roxio instaled limited version and nero and even a few free downloaded dvd burners.
this is not a good idea to use different software burners as they tend to purpusely want to make you buy their repair products.
