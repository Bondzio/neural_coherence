1.1.1	okay, here is a puzzlement that i hope someone can help me with.	St
1.1.2	I have a wifi router that communicates with one computer but not another.	St
1.1.3	what is strange is, my dv1432us hp laptop cannot &quot;hear&quot; the wifi a foot away, but a desktop with a cheap usb wifi dongle in the back can communicate with the wifi router from the basement.	St
1.1.4	I have tried turning off zone alarm, no go.	St
1.1.5	the ethernet wire out of the wifi router gives great internet connection to the laptop.	St
1.1.6	the laptop wif works otherwise, I can get wifi anywhere else, including hotels and airports, and even the next door neighbor when rcn poops out.	St
1.1.7	so the internet wiring system is a rcn wire into a d-link dcm-202 modem, that runs a wire to a vonage phone router, and that outputs to a netgear wgr614 v6 wifi router.	St
1.1.8	my laptop runs win xp.	St
1.1.9	and it used to communicate fine with the wifi router but hasn't for months.	St
1.1.10	all i can think of is that i need to change the &quot;channel&quot; on the router?	St
1.1.11	not skilled enough to understand that stuff.	St
1.1.12	help!	St
1.1.13	thanks!!!	St
1.1.14	- fj	St
1.2.1	Did you try some sub 10 buck wifi USB card to stand in or take over the work?	St
1.3.1	well the laptop's wifi is ok with most every other wifi signal source, it just won't connect up with my own wifi router.	St
1.3.2	it's even weirder because my other desktop CAN link up with my router (I am certain as it has a unique name), AND i can see the router's name in the laptop's wireless connections list but there is no data getting sent/received between these 2 pieces of hardware, both of which seem to work and play well with everyone else.	St
1.3.3	i just can;t figure this out.	St
1.3.4	i like the faster wired connection but would be nice to be untethered once in a while.	St
1.3.5	thanks - jl	Polite
1.4.1	While it could be some forgotten MAC FILTER issue I can't see that detail in this post.	St
1.4.2	It sounds to me that if other wifi spots work then a new router will cure this.	St
