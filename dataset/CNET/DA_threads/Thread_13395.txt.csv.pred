1.1.1	How do I figure out a range of private IP addresses ( or at least the subnet mask ) that I want to use for 1 main office with 6 remote sites .	St
1.1.2	There 's no more than 300 computers per site .	St
1.2.1	If IT staff ca n't do this , I 'd talk to the HR department .	St
1.2.2	Since the usually mask of 255.255.255.0 only gives up 253 usuable addresses your IT staff should try 10.0.0.0 addressing and the wide open 255.255.0.0 mask But how did you end up with 300 machines and such bad IT staff ?	Ques
