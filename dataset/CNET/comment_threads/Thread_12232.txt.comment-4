theory that smaller drives last longer?
That has not been my experience.
That said, could his theory be based on older hard drives, back in the day, that seemed to last forever, or at least longer than the actual computer?
Those drives were only 2, 4, 8 GB.
If 80GB is going to do for you, go for it P
