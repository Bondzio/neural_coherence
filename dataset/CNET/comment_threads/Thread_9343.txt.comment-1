I have a D-link Dir-655 wireless router and a Acer Aspire Laptop.
Both are N band compatible.
My laptop really does not respond on the internet very quickly.
How can I test the speed I am getting on my laptop?
The laptop is Windows 7 64-bit with 2 gig of Ram and single core.
I'm using Google Chrome for a browser.
I have on order a D-link DWA 566 PCI wireless adapter for my desktop.
It is Windows 7 32-bit with 4 gig of RAM.
Will I have decrease speed with it upon installation of the wireless card?
