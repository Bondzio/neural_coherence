hey mate, that's an awesome configuration you got there and windows 7 x64 will easily run on it.
no doubt about that.
however, for such a system i advice having more space on external hard disk than in built.
320 gb is cool, but it's better you get an external hard disk of any size you want.
save most of your data on it rather than your inbuilt space.
this advice is coming out from the worst experience i had with high end systems.
but all in all, fantastic configuration you got there.
