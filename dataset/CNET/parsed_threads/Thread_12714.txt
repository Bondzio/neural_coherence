<s> Hi, I need your help... </s>
<s> I have a SATA raid card from sunix. </s>
<s> I made (2008!) </s>
<s> a RAID1. </s>
<s> But today I accidentally delete the RAID1 from the card's BIOS utillity configuration!!! </s>
<s> The PC does not boot!!!!!!!!! </s>
<s> HELP. </s>
<s> I have all my data inside the disks... </s>
<s> I made new raid 1 configuration but nothing. </s>
<s> It shows that RAID1 is GOOD and after that nothing... </s>
<s> Unless SUNIX supplies a recovery method I strongly suggest you goto http://www.drivesavers.com next. </s>
<s> That is, unless you have all you need on backup. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I search for a disk recovery in internet and was ok... (unfortunately I have to make a new windows installation) </s>
<s> Because RAID 1 recovery is very unsure and unsafe to the files on the RAID 1 set. </s>
<s> If you had not mentioned RAID I would have linked to the CNET Storage Forum &quot;Lost and Found&quot; sticky top post where there are many recovery titles for free and free to try. </s>
<s> But your post had RAID so I have to defer to the safest methods. </s>
<s> I can't help people destroy their last copy of their files. </s>
<s> Hope you understand, Bob </s>
<s> Because yours is RAID 1 (mirror) you could get lucky as long as the BIOS removal did not state all data would be lost. </s>
<s> What you might try is to remove one drive (they'd both be identical), and change the the BIOS to allow standard drive use rather than RAID. </s>
<s> If it would not boot, you could try to fix the MBR. </s>
<s> I can say I've had better luck with RAID on SATA than IDE ports when it comes to fixing broken RAID arrays. </s>
<s> I stopped using these a while back and never used RAID 0 as it's an accident waiting to happen. </s>
<s> RAID 1 is slightly more forgiving. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
