Does anyone have any advice? I have not decided wheter to buy a finished computer, or build one. I am grateful to any advice. Thanks!!

I do not need anything else than the machine (no monitors or anything). I am thinking of using Intel Core 2 Quad ..., a MB that fits it and a Graphic card compatible with Open GL and Active X-9 or more (if I decide to build it myself). I know that different components not always go together, and if any of you have some experience with parts that go well together, it would be great to hear about it.

I like to refrain from terms like &quot;powerful&quot; it should be more like &quot;capable&quot;. You don't really need a fast cpu but rather stuffed ram and decent video. If the s/w takes advantage of &quot;multiple core cpus&quot; then again, it needn't be the fastest but get one that your mtrbd. fully supports, easily. As for a mtrbd., pick top-end brands as anything cheap will certainly hurt once the crunching starts. Of course, be sure the case is well cooled. tada -----Willy

Give them your requirements and budget and go from there. A custom build is usually the preferred way to get your computer for the things your going to do, but hey, give dell a looksee and compare price with the custom shops...(xps series)

I have had a lot of computers, custom made, ready made and some I have built myself, and the ones I have been most satisfied with are the ones I have built myself. That can be plain luck, but it can also be because the ones one can buy in the shop if one have a budget, are often not the latest, but maybe 6 month old machines. If one will have the latest in parts, the machines will be very expensive (Norway is one of the most expensive country to buy stuff in, thanks to horribly high taxes). And that is why I am considering building a new computer myself. I appreciate all the tips and advices I have got so far, and will start looking for parts Thanks.
