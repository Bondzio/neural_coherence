let me be blunt.
today's motherboards have too many changes from what was in there.
don't do it.
why should i list the parts you'll save?
but in short let's skip to what is the best update to get some gaming out of that box.
i suggest you look at this list -&gt;  for your agp slot then check the power supply rating and call it quits.
the headaches of saving what may be the case, the cd/dvd drive and nothing else is usually not worth it.
even the os may fail to relocate and many don't plan on that.
