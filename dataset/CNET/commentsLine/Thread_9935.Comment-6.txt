same problem here with sandisk 4gb hdsc card (i have 2 other identical cards that still work so it is definately a problem either with the physical card hardware failing or a virus in the root of the card - which there is no apparent way of clearing as the disk is only accessable for the initial 3-4 secs of being read on insertion to the reader (still managed to salvage a few of my smaller files by quick copy and paste (drag&drop) to the desktop.
however large *.pst files are apparently lost.
i intend to return the card to sandisk with an explanitory note (their support line simply advised me to invest in a recovery tool - that can't work because the drive only exists for those few seconds - and i think that as there is a possibility that the fault is a physical defect they should at least attempt to fix/recover the data.
sage advice to back up these things regularly - my last was early feb and between that and the recovery of those smaller files it is not a complete disaster this time - but still loss of e-mails may matter later on.
let me know if you have managed to resolve and i'll post the outcome of my efforts later.
ps - on one forum a suggestion to read the card on a linux system as most virus are designed to interfere with windows - that might hold water with your &quot;the card works fine in the camera&quot; statement.
regards
