i wound up installing my osx on free bsd because i couldn't access the hard drive.is this a problem and what can i do now?i tried to start a new account but it made me install on fbsd again.??
?needless to say i started from no where and blundered along.everything seems to work alright except when i use add ons.all kinds of weird stuff happens every time i install something and i'm always having to reinstall passwords.
