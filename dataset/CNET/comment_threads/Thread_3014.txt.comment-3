I had the impression that a computer with this setup could support 64 bit applications.
But, I've read other posts on this site that have implied because of the lower cache an AMD Athlon 64 processor located on a socket 754 motherboard can not support 64 bit extensions.
So I was just hoping that someone could clear things up for me.
