1.1.1	Just went to turn my system on this morning, and it will not boot!	St
1.1.2	It has been running great, and I have added no new software or hardware for awhile.	St
1.1.3	When I turn on the computer, the XP logo splashes up, then I get a message about Windows not starting correctly.	St
1.1.4	However, I am not able to use my keyboard (USB) at all to select an option.	St
1.1.5	On the front of my computer (Dell Dimension 2400), there is a green light that keeps flashing to the right of the power button.	St
1.1.6	Any suggestions on what I could try?	St
1.1.7	Thanks!	St
1.1.8	L.T.	St
1.2.1	Bring it up in safe mode and run your anti-everything apps.	St
1.2.2	You do run them don't you?	St
1.2.3	If that should fail to fix your problem, pull out the CD that came with the system and do a repair.	St
1.2.4	Let us know.	St
1.2.5	and life goes on... Jack	St
1.3.1	Jack, thanks for the suggestion.	Polite
1.3.2	I wish I could get to safe mode!	St
1.3.3	I get the screen that asks me if I want to restart in safe mode, but I have no keyboard or mouse function which would enable me to get there.	St
1.3.4	I now have a ps2 mouse hooked up instead of my USB one, and it still does not help.	St
1.3.5	When I get the message about Windows having an error and it gives me the options of how I want to start it up, the countdown at the bottom expires and it tries to start normally.	St
1.3.6	Then, the screen goes black.	St
1.3.7	The computer power does stay on, but the green light next to the power flashes.	St
1.3.8	Do I need a new hard drive?	St
1.3.9	This computer is only about a year old.	St
1.3.10	I really, really need those documents back.	St
1.3.11	Here's yet another lesson of why I should have backed everything up last week when I thought about it!!!	Sug
1.3.12	Thanks for taking time to offer a suggestion.	St
1.3.13	I'd love to read any other ideas.	St
1.3.14	I'm open to try them!	St
1.4.1	I don't think the hard drive is the problem...yet.	St
1.4.2	The fact that you get the Windows &quot;welcome&quot; screen tells me it's working...at least a little.	St
1.4.3	I guess the warranty is out of the question?	St
1.4.4	You didn't say whether or not you had the &quot;restore&quot; CDs.	St
1.4.5	That would be my next suggestion.	St
1.4.6	You could also take that HD and put it in another system just to make sure it's OK.	Sug
1.4.7	Put it in the secondary IDE port tho, so it doesn't try to boot.	St
1.4.8	You might take the cover off and dust it out real good.	Sug
1.4.9	At least it'll be clean.	St
1.4.10	The key is going to be that restore CD that should have come with the machine, unless you built it.	St
1.4.11	Let us know.	St
1.4.12	and life goes on... Jack	St
1.5.1	I have a few suggestions: 1.	St
1.5.2	Remove any extra RAM you installed.	St
1.5.3	If not, switch your ram to a different slot because the motherboard may have trouble reconize it.	St
1.5.4	remember to discharge yourself on a metal surface before touching chips.	St
1.5.5	2.	St
1.5.6	Get a recovery CD, and run it.	St
1.5.7	3.	St
1.5.8	Press and hold F2 or F8 during powerup and enter the BIOS setup screen.	St
1.5.9	look for the USB connections selection under Hardware (depend on your BIOS) and enable all USB ports.	St
1.5.10	If your keyboard do not work, replace it with a PS/2 connector keyboard, or get an adapter.	St
1.5.11	4.	St
1.5.12	Don't buy DELL again.	Sug
1.5.13	I recommend eMachines for value-PCs.	St
1.6.1	I ended up calling the Dell tech.	St
1.6.2	line to see if someone could help me there.	St
1.6.3	I have had less than stellar tech.	St
1.6.4	service from them over the years, but my call today was fantastic.	St
1.6.5	I spoke with someone who actually spoke proper English, and he knew what he was doing.	St
1.6.6	He walked me through about 4 steps which he said would reset my keyboard in the bios.	St
1.6.7	That worked, and I am up and running again.	St
1.6.8	I am so glad that I didn't have to spend hours and $$$ trying to solve this issue.	St
1.6.9	Thanks for the help and suggestions!	St
1.7.1	What were the four (4) steps in solving the problem?	St
1.7.2	Thanks.	St
