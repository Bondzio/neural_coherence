I used ZIP storeage on my older computer so when I got this computer six months ago I bought a new Iomega ZIP 100 disk drive. The disk is bad, not the drive. I put other ZIP disks in to the drive and it works well on those ZIP disks. I saved all of my data since a year ago on this disk. I mean ALL of my data. I saved to that ZIP drive instead of my hard drive. I lost all of it That is the simplest way to put it. Can anyone help me by giving me suggestions on how to recover the data on this disk? I took it to two computer shops near where I live and both said the disk is toast. Also, what would have caused the disk to crash like that? Could a cell phone near it do it when the phone rings? Thanks. Steven stevenschwindt@hotmail.com

The suggestions is the drives themselves were destroying the disks making the date unrecoverable.
