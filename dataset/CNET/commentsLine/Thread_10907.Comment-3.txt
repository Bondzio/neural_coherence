it's not overkill and the remote access is all internal.
i don't need to remote access my network or any machine outside my house.
the closest thing i can come to is a router thats like $1200-$1400 when i know there has to be some home networking models that can be just as good.
even a switch will be suitable and i'll just uplink it to a regular router for firewall capabilities and internet access.
the longest fiber wire i have would probably be 100ft maximum since that's more than enough to reach a computer that's the furthest away from the point where my other machines are.
i tried cat6 but had some connectivity issues with it through my router so i decided to stick with cat6 for everthing else except 2 machines hooked up through fiber through a switch for blazing internal speeds and uplink to a cat5 router for internet access.
