i just purchased a panasonic sdr-h18.
the video transfers to my computer fine using the software in the box imagemixer.
but i can not get it to imovie or because it shows up as a &quot;.mod&quot; file.
does anyone know what that is and how to send these movies to my clients so they can view them on their pcs?
i am using a mac.
also i am assuming this camcorder does not have a dv port because it says nothing about it in the manual.
obviously i am a newbie to camcorders.
can you give me any advice?
thanks.
