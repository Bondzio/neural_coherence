1.1.2	The first : Intel Pentium 4 CPU w/hsf Asus mobo 512mb DDR RAM The second : Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 ( 2.4GHz ) 8MB L2 Cache Zalman CNPS 9500A HSF ( Copper ) Abit IP35Pro Mobo A-Data 4 X 1GB DDR2 800 Memory	St
1.2.1	the first may be worth $ 30- $ 50 but finding a buyer may be tough .	St
1.2.2	suggest you look into freecycle.com .	Sug
1.2.3	the second stack is much better and you should be able to sell the bundle on ebay for $ 120- $ 150 .	St
