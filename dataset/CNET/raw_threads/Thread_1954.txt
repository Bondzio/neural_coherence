It was given to me as a gift because the former owner just bought a much newer PC. I have been trying to figure out what is wrong with the CD-ROM drive. Everything works fine except for this drive. Whenever I put any type of disc into the drive it will not run automatically, so I go into My Computer and double click the D: drive. It will not load this way either. It just displays the error message: &quot;D: Not Accessible; Device is not ready.&quot; Does anyone know how to fix this. Is it software or hardware related etc.? Thanks in advance for any replies.
