<s> Hi, I have an IBM thinkpad but the processor has burnt out. </s>
<s> since then i have bought a new computer but it would be a shame to lose all my files from my laptop. </s>
<s> i also know that belkin have a product called &quot;Belkin USB 2.0 External Drive Enclosure&quot;. </s>
<s> i was wondering if i can use this with my hard drive. </s>
<s> the hard drive is a Travelstar p/n: 07N7352 Model: IC25N015ATDA04-0. </s>
<s> thank you for all your help acid </s>
<s> Some cases are USB 2.0 ONLY and don't have USB 1.1 capability. </s>
<s> This creates headaches for some owners. </s>
<s> I picked up this model -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=A-8818-N and it was USB 1.1 and 2.0 plus doesn't need a power supply. </s>
<s> It was 7.99 during a sale. </s>
<s> It works very nicely for my uses. </s>
