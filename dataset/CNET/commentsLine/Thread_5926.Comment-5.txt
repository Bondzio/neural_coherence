the raid manual also??
it confuses me totally.
would take a little time to digest.
a couple things to think of; sata drives are also called ide.
optical drives are atapi drives.
i had one computer where the raid controller could be set to run hard drives in the normal mode, but it would not accept atapi drives on those ports.
my guess is that getting the bios set up properly could be the issue.
remember the second and third ide ports are controlled from the separate sis controller, not the intel.
