<s> I have a 2.4 P4 with a 865 perl board and 1 gb of 400 memory I am satisfied with the computer speed even with PSCS2...but I would like more speed with Nikon NX. </s>
<s> Everyone seems to think adding another gb of memory will help me. </s>
<s> I am looking for more opinions and also do you think adding a SATA hard drive will help. </s>
<s> If 200 dollars will give me a fair improvement ....that will do me much better than spending big bucks for a new computer. </s>
<s> I use XP pro and I do no gaming. </s>
<s> Thanks for anyones time that tries to help. </s>

<s> If this is Nikon's editing software what most find is miniscule gains past 1G of ram. </s>
<s> The hard disk is rarely a speed factor during a photo since everything is in RAM. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If you would really like some help, we will need some more information. </s>
<s> Where do you find the biggest waits now in the software? </s>
<s> Is it in applying effects or cropping images, or while opening / saving files to your harddrive? </s>
<s> The former would point toward RAM / processor preformance. </s>
<s> Hard-drive speed mainly dictates the latter. </s>
<s> To decide if your program is ram-starved, lets try this. </s>
<s> Before opening your Nikon software, pull up your task manager. </s>
<s> You can get this by right clicking on your taskbar and selecting 'task manager'. </s>
<s> Go to the performance tab and write down the number next to Available Physical Memory. </s>
<s> Now open up the Nikon software and note the available memory again. </s>
<s> Try opening an image and note this number a final time. </s>
<s> You will want a few hundred MBs of ram available or your preformance will fall off drastically as your system starts to swap memory to and from the hard-drive. </s>
<s> Feel free to post your numbers back here for review. </s>
<s> 1GB of ram might be plenty of ram if most of it is free, but if you have several other programs and background processes running, it may not be enough. </s>
<s> As far as adding a new hard drive, this will not improve your performance much, unless your current disk is a dinosaur. </s>
<s> Adding RAM might be a good step, but it would be worthwhile to check your numbers before going out to make the purchase. </s>
<s> Its a little slow opening (rendering)and slower saving( if lots of edits were made)...the edits themself are not too bad. </s>
<s> Available memory closed------704684 NX open ----671204 NEF open----324428 I am defragging now to see if that helps. </s>
<s> You have more than 300MB free RAM after loading the program and opening a NEF file. </s>
<s> That looks good, and I doubt you will see any improvement by adding another gig. </s>
<s> The two possible bottlenecks for saving files are processor speed and hard-drive speed. </s>
<s> As you might be aware the Nikon NF software doesn't apply the edits to the original file, but saves the edits seperate, keeping the original file intact. </s>
<s> This is great in that the original file is undisturbed, but not so great in that a file with several edits becomes a resource hog. </s>
<s> Defragging your drive can't hurt, but again you can do a simple test to see which is likely slowing your system the most. </s>
<s> In task manager if you click the preformance tab, you can watch your CPU usage while saving a file. </s>
<s> If it goes to 100% and stays there for the majority of your wait, you can assume that the processor is the bottleneck. </s>
<s> If it stays considerably lower than 100 for the duration of the save, you can assume that your hard-drive speed is to blame. </s>
<s> If you need quicker disk-access, your best bet is two SATA disks configured in a RAID-0 configuration. </s>
<s> If the processor speed is the bottleneck, then an upgrade to P4 3.0E for about 90 dollars would be your best option. </s>
<s> Neither of these is quite as easy as plugging in some more ram, but if you're up to it, there is still some more preformance hidden away in your box. </s>
<s> From what you are saying it seems my CPU is OK Now the defrag seems to have helped...still no speed demon but its faster. </s>
<s> When I opened NX it hit 60% for about 1 second and then dropped to less than 30% when I opened a NEF it hit 100% for a second or two at most, and dropped to almost nothing until I started editing but never went above above 50 % again even when saving. </s>
<s> Yes, it seems that your CPU is sufficient for the work you're doing. </s>
<s> Also, the fact that the defrag helped enforces the idea that your harddrive is the culprit. </s>
<s> A SATA RAID 0 arrangement will give you the most improvement for the buck. </s>
<s> Newegg sells 80 GB SATA Seagate 7200.9 harddrives for less than 50 dollars each. </s>
<s> If you buy 2 and hook them up in RAID 0 formation, you will get a 'virtaul' 160GB drive that reads and writes twice as fast as each drive would individually. </s>
<s> If you then save your NEF's to the new drive, you would see some improvements. </s>
<s> Keep in mind if you decide to go this route, that OEM drives are shipped with just a drive. </s>
<s> You should pick up 2 SATA cables for a few dollars each while you're shopping. </s>
<s> Not being a user of Nikon NX, I really can't say how much imporvement you would see, but if you are willing to invest 100 dollars and an hour of time, you can find out. </s>
<s> I would guess that your MAX improvement would be 3 times the preformance of your current setup. </s>
<s> The Seagate drives are both quiet and fast. </s>
<s> I think you'd be happy with the setup if you decide to go this route. </s>
<s> I read &quot;for about 1 second and then dropped to less than 30%&quot;. </s>
<s> I know one owner that was complaining about speed and once the application was open the load and save times were only a few seconds. </s>
<s> Upgrades were only going to shave a second off here or there. </s>
<s> Where is the long times noted? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I cannot quantify how much time will be saved. </s>
<s> Program load times will not change much if at all, but when reading / writing large files such as NEF files, a faster drive is helpful. </s>
<s> In this case, we are looking for a 'fair' improvement. </s>
<s> Two Seagate 7200.9 drives will give a preformance increase over anything you could buy a few years ago, and this is what we are looking for. </s>
<s> Genece is looking to get a little more performance from an aging computer, and given all the info, and a budget, I believe this is the best that can be done. </s>
<s> If you have another suggestion, please contribute. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Lets say I do the SATA hard drives and get another 1gb of 3200 ram......and I still have problems.....I am sure I can use the drives , but can I use the memory if I need to get a new MB and processor? </s>
<s> Or will I be very limited to the processor I will be able to use ? </s>
<s> Or I will need to scrap the memory? </s>
<s> You will have a few options for upgrade in the future. </s>
<s> Even with your current motherboard, there is a bit of room to get a faster processor. </s>
<s> You can go as fast as 3.4 G on your current board. </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/rl/rl_proc.htm If you decide to go to a new processor / mb combo in the future, my recomendation would be the Core 2 Duo. </s>
<s> This can be a costly undertaking, but the good news is that your ram will not be obsolete in the near future. </s>
<s> There are motherboards that support DDR ram and Core 2 Duo, and there is little to no loss in speed by not running the latest DDR2. </s>
<s> http://www.anandtech.com/mb/showdoc.aspx?i=2813 I'd say go for it, add the ram and SATA drives. </s>
<s> I think you'll be pleased with the results. </s>
<s> One more question ....I have been watching the task manager when NX is open and it seems the Page file is the problem....what exactly is the page file? </s>
<s> But I've seen zero pagefile activity on 1G RAM machines even with a &quot;GIANT&quot; image file being loaded. </s>
<s> Be careful how you measure. </s>
<s> As to the RAM being compatible with the next system I'm going to call it as scrap. </s>
<s> Or something you sell off with the next system. </s>
<s> Have you used one of the new Core 2 Duo systems? </s>
<s> Very nice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> if I save a couple files from NX the page file reads about 800mb used....I really do not know if thats good or bad.. </s>
<s> But at about 600MB I see strange effects regardless of what the CPU or available memory report.. </s>
<s> I really have no problem with the speed of this machine with PSCS2 but it drags with NX. </s>
<s> Especially if there are a couple files open even though they have been saved. </s>
<s> I bet a new machine will solve the problem but I was hoping to find a less expensive fix. </s>
<s> There are many at the Nikon forum that claim 2 gbs of memory really help NX but I hate to waste the money if its not going to work. </s>
