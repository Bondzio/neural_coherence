<s> I never thought it could really happen, but my pc did explode this morning. </s>
<s> I was working on it as usual, then I smelled a burning smell, then a loud &quot;pop&quot;, then my machine shut down on its own. </s>
<s> I unplugged and opened it up to see what I could see, but honestly I didn't know what to look for. </s>
<s> I haven't cracked open the power supply yet, but I wouldn't know what to look for. </s>
<s> Please help with any suggestions! </s>
<s> I'm so desperate ! </s>

<s> Snap, Crackle and Pop is good for breakfast cereal but bad for a power supply. </s>
<s> Don't even try to restart with the existing supply, replace it and hopefully the damage was limited to that. </s>
<s> You won't know until then. </s>
<s> The sounds you heard were probably a &quot;capacitor&quot; that blew. </s>
<s> The smell is related to it and probable near-by circuits. </s>
<s> Check for a leaky, bulging or simply extended cap, these look like little barrels. </s>
<s> It will be obivous once you ralize one or more are very different looking or hanging it guts out. </s>
<s> Inspect under good lighting. </s>
<s> As the other poster said, swap out the power supply, if you crack its cover as caps are all over the system. </s>
<s> Beware, if serious damage the mtrbd. </s>
<s> is best replaced, but a cap can be replaced but no guarntee it will fix the problem. </s>
<s> FYI - In the past 18-24mo. </s>
<s> a capacitor problem is known from a bad manufacturing source. </s>
