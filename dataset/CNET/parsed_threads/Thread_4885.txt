<s> Hello, I currently have an Asus U81A, running Vista 64bit, and the hard drive just went bad. </s>
<s> The best price I can get on the repair is $250 which is about half of what I paid for the laptop 2 years ago. </s>
<s> I have loved this thing, but dont love vista. </s>
<s> So my should I just buy a new computer or fix this one? </s>
<s> And If I go for a new one what would be a good idea? </s>
<s> It has a 320gb hard drive and 4gb ram, with a intell core 2 duo. </s>
<s> I am a college student going into my last year, and this things computing power has been more than enough since I don't play a lot of games. </s>
<s> You can buy a new laptop, if you wish, it maybe good since you'll be getting the latest out there and be running Win7. </s>
<s> However, if your laptop is only the HD that is bad. </s>
<s> AND! </s>
<s> you have the recovery/restore discs, then get a new HD, a 250gb is round $60 or so and reloading the OS, etc. </s>
<s> should be a snap. </s>
<s> You can try to recover data from old HD using an ext. </s>
<s> USB case that accepts your old HD. </s>
<s> The cost for a HD replacement and such is far cheaper. </s>
<s> If you need the recovery/restore discs, then try ther vendor support, most sell them for very low cost and/or 3rd party vendors that offer OEM type restore/recovery discs. </s>
<s> Again, all this is cheaper than buying new. </s>
<s> Up to you. </s>
