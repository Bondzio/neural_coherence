After few days whenever i hibernated the system it automatically booted up after 1 or 2 hrs. When I called the dell support for help they told that this is occuring because of hard disk failure and they will replace the hard disk. The present hard disk contains the factory created system image which i want to migrate to my new hard disk but i have no idea on how to do that. I tried using the Windows Backup and Resstore utility but it didn't helped as it was not backing up some of the vital files. Please help as soon as possible as the dell technician to replace the hard disk will be coming in 3-4 days.

I'd remove it and put it into an external enclosure with a USB connection and collect data that way. Unreadable areas of that hard drive are going to create problems for some backup software. You do this manually. I'd also think that, if he technician is going to replace the hard drive, he's also going to recreate the recovery partition during the restore process. Hidden partitions are something that regular backup utilities don't deal with. Some imaging/cloning software will but they may halt on read errors. Get what you can manually.

I tried the windows backup and restored it on the virtual machine, but it didn't worked as all the files were not copied by the backup. Then i manually copied all the files and tried it. This one also doesn't worked. When i executed the recovery application it gave error &quot;ACCESS TO FILE DENIED&quot;. So i edited the permissions and restarted the application and this time it stopped responding.
