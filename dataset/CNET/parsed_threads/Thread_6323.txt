<s> Well, I currently have a broken COMPAQ Presario from '04 that is broken, and HP is making very little progress in helping me, so if worse comes to worse, I was thinking of what computer I should get. </s>
<s> I am on a budget of about $650. </s>
<s> I would like a good built in GFX card, that would be able to play games like StarCraft II, Team Fortress 2, and Mirror's Edge well. </s>
<s> I'd also like it to be able to run Phot editing software well. </s>
<s> (GIMP, PSE7, etc) I'll post more detail, but I think thats about it. </s>
<s> Oh. </s>
<s> I'm Canadian, so keep that in mind for Companies and Prices. </s>
<s> There may be little support past a few years and certainly none for free today. </s>
<s> Today all support outside of warranty is a pay for it deal. </s>
<s> I'm finding folk calling this not being nice but employees cost money, phone lines and more. </s>
<s> Back to your search. </s>
<s> There are far too many desktops out there for that price. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> In the US, many a &quot;white box&quot; type system contains everything but the monitor are going for $399 on sale or not. </s>
<s> Depnds on brands but generally again some others are sold at $499 as well same type of deal. </s>
<s> These even at basic level are better than any '04 system. </s>
<s> While some are Comanq and HP, eMachines offers some too. </s>
<s> Dell, Gateway, eMachine, Compaq, HP, Acer, Sony and Toshiba all have some entry level system and/or deals online, check out the respective websites and compare. </s>
<s> Other online vendors offer deals too, notably NewEgg, TigerDirect, Geeks and ZipZoomFly, check for Canadain sales. </s>
<s> As for support, check what best fits you after the typical warranty. </s>
<s> In warranty, certainly some maybe better than others, but generally speaking support is getting harder to please the consumer. </s>
<s> Don't expect too much any more, off-shore support and long wait times is typical. </s>
<s> But heck, it keeps me in business as unhappy consumers call me from time to time with such complaints. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> @ R. </s>
<s> Proff. </s>
<s> : I didn't mean the service was frustrating or annnoying, I meant that it took days or near a day for a person to get back to me via email. </s>
<s> HP Phone support was much &quot;worse&quot; though, as i got transfered 3 times, and given a dead number. </s>
<s> But that is just a slight gripe, the people themselves that i talked to were very nice and understanding, too. </s>
<s> @Willy: Thnaks. </s>
<s> I've been looking at a few Acer's with 4GB ram, one of them was an Athlon x3 with a pretty decent GFX card. </s>
<s> I am currently on an acer, and it seems to slow waaay down after a few years, even with cleaning it. </s>
<s> NewEgg has a few good deals, a lot on some Gateways, but a lot of the good (Core 2 duo) computers are over $599. </s>
<s> I'll have to lok at TigerDirect again, only looked at their laptops. </s>
<s> Thanks to you both. </s>
<s> Did you try newegg.ca and their &quot;picker&quot;? </s>
<s> There was one hit at http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883229194 and while you might find better, let's see what you think. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Wow, that looks.. </s>
<s> Pretty amazing, thanks, I didn't know about that. </s>
<s> Plus I had been looking at x3's and i3's. </s>
<s> I'll consider that. </s>
<s> Shipping price isn't great, but not bad either. </s>
