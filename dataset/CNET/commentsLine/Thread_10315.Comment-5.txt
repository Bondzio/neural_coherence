i have had great success in fixing 1.44 floppys that only read 720. there is a micro switch on the right side looking into the drive.
spray a shot of wd-40 on the little finger of the micro switch, push in a floppy disk several times to jar loose the finger so that it will protude up into the small hole that differentates 720 from 1.44. if the drive is truly a 720??
(they haven't bennmade in many years) then replace it with a new drive, about 10 bucks.
