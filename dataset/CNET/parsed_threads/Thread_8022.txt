<s> Dear members, I badly need 3 in one (scanner, printer and copier) with an OCR (optical character recognition) or ReadIRIS, which brand and model would you recommend, an OCR is a must for my work. </s>
<s> The printer I have now is an HP1215 PSC three in one, this model does not carry out OCR. </s>

<s> I can write that today few to none of the consumer models at the store have OCR since the consumer seems to have cooled on that being something they want. </s>
<s> Maybe you'll have to add it later. </s>
