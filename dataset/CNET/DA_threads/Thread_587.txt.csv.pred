1.1.1	Hi There can someone point me in the right direction of a web site that shows how to test a ATX PSU ie what voltages etc should be coming out of what leads etc .	St
1.1.2	I realize it should be under load conditons , MOBo and at least one hard drive but the rest I have no idea .	St
1.1.3	So your informed help would be greatly apreciated .	Polite
1.1.4	Kindest Regards Tony B .	St
1.2.1	http : //www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/powersupplies-15.html shows a test rig for testing a power supply .	St
1.2.2	Such are rarely needed for most of us .	St
1.2.3	In fact , a new power supply with Watts to spare will cost much less than testing .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	[ OSHA will hate you .	St
1.3.2	LOL ] You can probe the rear of the power connector on the mobo .	St
1.3.3	The black leads are all common [ ground in most peoples terms ] .	St
1.3.4	The main 5 volts is on pins 4 , 6 , 19 , and 20 .	St
1.3.5	The main [ once ] 12 volts is on pin 10 [ now there is also a separate 4 pin 12 volt connector , 2 pins 12 V and 2 Gnd , it is now spec 'd to be provided by a separate set of rails in the supply ] .	St
1.3.6	The 3.3v is on pins 1,2 , and 11 .	St
1.3.7	The pins run from 1 thru 10 down one side and 11 [ next to 1 ] thru 20 down the other side .	St
1.3.8	The 11 thru 20 side has 4 black wires the other row only 3 black wires .	St
1.3.9	5 volts are virtually always Red .	St
1.3.10	Minus 12 and Minus 5 volts are virtually no longer used .	St
1.3.11	Testing an ATX standalone means you have to learn how to turn the supply outputs on .	St
1.3.12	Robert 's link probably shows that .	St
1.4.1	I chuckle over some stories .	St
1.4.2	Why do you need to test it ?	Ques
1.4.3	Pwr supply fan runs=+12 good .	St
1.4.4	Processor fan and other fans=+12 good .	St
1.4.5	Hdd spins , Cdrom drive opens=+5 good .	St
1.4.6	Need meter ( Harbor Freight ~ $ 5 ) for -5 -12 -3.3 , which I have found burnt out a few times because the current rating is small .	St
1.4.7	www.duxcw.com/faq/ps/ps4.htm is a link to describe the voltages of typical ATX supply .	St
1.5.1	do with a voltage scale ? ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.5.2	They draw virtually zero current .	St
1.5.3	That 's the point of a voltmeter .	St
1.5.4	The old D'Arsonvals were usually 10,000 OHMs per volt .	St
1.5.5	Modern digital are multimegohm .	St
1.5.6	Meter burnouts occur when one tries to measure 120 VAC when on an OHMs scale [ does it every time ] .	St
1.6.1	Just a thank you to all who have contirbuted to this discussion .	Polite
1.6.2	Regards Tony B .	St
1.7.1	-12 , -5 are rated at about 300-400ma , while other voltages are rated 5a-20a .	St
1.7.2	The point being that the minus voltages can be easily burnt out .	St
1.7.3	I do n't think they have the same interupt as the + voltages do .	St
1.7.4	Short out the +5v and the pwr supp will restart instead of burn out .	St
1.7.5	Lightening or other way excessive surges can more easily burn out -voltages , as has been my experience .	St
