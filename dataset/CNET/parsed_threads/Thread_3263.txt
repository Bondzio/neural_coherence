<s> I am running a P4 2.66Ghz CPU and I want to squeeze a little more out of it instead of buying an entire new system right now. </s>
<s> I am wondering, what would be a &quot;safe&quot; frequency to overclock it to. </s>
<s> I was hoping I could get something around 3.0Ghz without it blowing up on me. </s>
<s> My Specs if needed: OS: WinXP Home CPU: Intel Pentium 4 2.66Ghz GPU: Radeon X1600 Pro RAM: 1.5Gb </s>
<s> While there are general guidelines to what you ask, nothing is secure and no set value. </s>
<s> This depends on several things which will vary according to the hardware. </s>
<s> Most important is the processor and the motherboard. </s>
<s> Manufacturing variances will determine the possibilities. </s>
<s> First look up the motherboard to see if you can even start. </s>
<s> The motherboard that will allow overclocking will have the access in the BIOS. </s>
<s> So let's start there. </s>
<s> What motherboard do you have? </s>
