Hi!!!
I have a HP Vectra VLi8 SFF Desktop PC (PIII,600 MHz,320MB RAM)with a sleek CD-ROM (like the ones used in a laptop).
This cd-rom has a strage problem.
Earlier there used to be no problem with the cd-rom.
But lately, it is recongnizing only the CD's that are either purchased from a software vendor or that come with the hardware.
It is not recongnizing the CD's that are written using a CD writer.
So I have got a heap of CD's that were recognized earlier but of no use now.
But these CD's are perfect and run well when tried on other systems.Can anyone plz.
help?
