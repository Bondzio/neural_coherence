<s> I am wondering if netbooks can handle Skype and a couple other programs at the same time. </s>
<s> The netbooks are starting to look attractive to me as a replacement for an old laptop that has roughly the same speed processor and a much smaller hard drive than comes with the netbooks. </s>
<s> How practical is it to use one of these with Skype (including video on both ends) while having perhaps a web browser and Outlook open at the same time? </s>

<s> I know skype alone is fine. </s>
<s> I would not try that and playing music though. </s>
<s> Programs as in a web browser without playing a video at the same time? </s>
<s> Sure. </s>
<s> And if I was unclear. </s>
<s> FORGET SKYPE VIDEO! </s>
<s> Just the phone feature for now. </s>
<s> When the dual core Atoms arrive my answer may change. </s>

<s> Daughters IBM ThinkPad with XP Pro (fast machine, heavy on RAM) took forever to boot, forever to open a web page, slow all around, had to click Shut down twice to get it to power off. </s>
<s> I worked on it for a couple of days then noticed Skype. </s>
<s> Uninstalled it and BAM! </s>
<s> Boots in less than two minutes and all the other speed problems are gone. </s>
<s> Skype does take a lot of resources, but it is a service that is great for my needs and is an &quot;always on&quot; program for me. </s>
<s> I use it to communicate with family, friends, and business contacts on three continents every day. </s>
<s> Thus my questions about its use on netbooks. </s>
<s> Okay, enough of my free advertising for Skype ... </s>
<s> then that's all that matters. </s>
<s> Just be prepared. </s>
<s> Skype is about the only thing I DON'T have a problem with on my Acer Aspire ... yes, the browser works a bit more slowly when I'm skyping, but then, I shouldn't be surfing the net while I'm talking to someone, should I? </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I have an Eee PC 1000; for me the determinant is internet speed. </s>
<s> If my USB wireless connection gives me enough juice, Skype video works fine. </s>
<s> I usually have at least Opera open, but turn off the music. </s>
<s> but then I have 2GB of ram, fast SSD, and monitor what I have opened. </s>
<s> Yuor wifi connection will determine the decision the most (I've had it degrade to voice only). </s>
<s> You are right about SHOULD not be surfing while talking. </s>
<s> A bad habit I have picked up! </s>
