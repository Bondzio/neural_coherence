<s> Hello, I need to build a PC that will be outside 24/7. </s>
<s> It will need to be in a protective casing that can withstand the elements. </s>
<s> Can you give me some recommendations on parts that can withstand the extreme in temperatures. </s>
<s> I need recommendations on motherboards, CPU, harddrives, fans and cases. </s>
<s> I will also need to get a PCMCIA card in order to send information back to the server. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> A mobile CPU will help get the heat down. </s>
<s> But for the rest, we need specifics. </s>
<s> What kind of temperature extremes are we talking about? </s>
<s> How will the case be designed, will there be ventilation? </s>
<s> What are you using it for and where will you be mounting it? </s>
<s> For the most part, normal PC hardware will work, unless the extremes are pretty extreme. </s>
<s> Just not enough info here to go on. </s>
<s> Hello, the case will be a weather resistant case that has insulation as well as vents for multiple fans. </s>
<s> The computer is used to analyze and collect environmental data in the wild and very very rural areas. </s>
<s> There are no cables or DSL lines where we are talking about. </s>
<s> It does have power supply, but the only way to transmit this data is through cellular link. </s>
<s> It will be about 20 feet in the air and will gather data on the environment (ie, temp, humidity, ect for scientific purposes) through a series of sensors on the ground. </s>
<s> The temperature extremes will be -20 to about 120F. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Check out http://www.mini-itx.com/store/?c=3#p1153, and look for the &quot;VoomPC Vehicle PC Enclosure&quot;. </s>
<s> It's not water tight (you'll be hard pressed to find one that is), but it is designed to be in rough temperatures and environments. </s>
<s> I hope that helps! </s>
<s> Linux has a project that is trying to create laptops for 3rd world countries. </s>
<s> they are facing the same challenges as you & more http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Hardware_specification </s>
<s> I work in a maritime enviorment. </s>
<s> We use pelican cases to keep our sensitive cases free of water and the elements you might have to mod a case but they are good...but not cheap. </s>
