I really don't want to go much over $100 if possible.
There seem to be so many different power supply units out there and with prices from as low as $15 to several hundred.
Something that I neglected in the original post has to do with fans some have 2 fans some have only one fan but more mm's.
So what should I consider as far as fans are concerned and how important is that?
