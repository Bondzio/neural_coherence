1.1.1	We are a two person non-profit office needing to get new hardware .	St
1.1.2	We were going to buy towers and a server but I am hearing conflicting info about what we really need .	St
1.1.3	I am not sure we want to host our emails , fire wall and domain because I now nada about that so if something failed I would have to call someone for support .	St
1.1.4	So now I am doing research on NAS and file servers .	St
1.1.5	We do all of our website maintenance , collateral material and artwork .	St
1.1.6	We do n't necessarily need to access ( MS Exchange ) our computers away from the office ( other software out there than can do that ) .	St
1.1.7	Can someone tell me the pros and cons of server vs NAS for a small business ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	No 2 person office I know runs a server or even a NAS .	St
1.2.2	What for ?	Ques
1.2.3	As to email you can do like most and use some gmail account while on the road .	St

1.3.1	If you growth rate or needs are simple , then keep the system simple .	St
1.3.2	The NAS will do what you want .	St
1.3.3	However , you limited in expansion , up to a point .	St
1.3.4	Any decent system can have the NAS added , as for any true server needs , then you must look at the whole system to match what you want to do .	St
1.3.5	You can look at some outside network service and allow them to host you and your cause .	St
1.3.6	That way , the expertise is on their end and all you provide is the content .	St
1.3.7	Of course this costs , but it does n't hurt to see what it involves .	St
1.3.8	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
