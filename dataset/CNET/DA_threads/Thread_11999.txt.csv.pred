1.1.1	I'm looking to upgrade the amount of RAM I have in my system, but have run into a few technical things which I'm unsure of.	St
1.1.2	Information was collected from EVEREST Current RAM: DDR SDRAM DDR-333 256mb Unbuffered PC2700 (166MHz) DIMM CL2.5 I want to upgrade to 1GB, with either 1x1gb or 2x512mb.	St
1.1.3	My motherboard only has 2 DDR DIMM RAM slots, so is it better to use 1x1gb incase I want to upgrade again in future?	St
1.1.4	are there any disadvantages to only have a 1gb stick?	St
1.1.5	I've been searching around for PC2700 for the last few days, and just noticed that everest says it supports other types: Supported RAM: DDR-266 SDRAM, DDR-333 SDRAM, DDR-400 SDRAM Since DDR-400 is supported, does that mean I can use PC3200 ram instead of 2700 and have no problems?	St
1.1.6	I'd rather buy the faster sticks if they'll work.	St
1.1.7	These are the PC3200 I've been looking at: http://www.savastore.com/productinfo/product.aspx?catalog_name=Savastore&product_id=10279841&pid=44&rstrat=0 http://www.savastore.com/productinfo/product.aspx?catalog_name=Savastore&product_id=10279842&pid=44&rstrat=0 http://www.microdirect.co.uk/ProductInfo.aspx?ProductID=6691&GroupID=1116 Are they any good and will they be supported okay?	St
1.1.8	My price range is 50-100, so if anyone has other good places to look can they post them (will need to be a uk site).	St
1.1.9	One of those sticks also says CL3.0, what's the difference between 3.0 and 2.5?	St
1.2.1	I'm not aware of any drawbacks using just 1 stick of 1gb as opposed to two of 512.	St
1.2.2	Someone else might be able to enlighten us both.	St
1.2.3	If your motherboard supports DDR-400, go for that, of course - although, check what your CPU frequency is - some would say it's better to have the same frequency for both.	St
1.2.4	CL is latency - the lower latency, the faster the memory.	St
1.2.5	From my own experience, CL2.5 is noticeably faster than CL3.	St
1.2.6	General advice - memory is key to computer perfomance; buy branded memroy from makers like Kingston, Crucial, Corsair, and not generic unknown makes.	St
1.2.7	A good place to get memory is from Crucial's own site - http://www.crucial.com/uk/ - they'll also advise you on the best compatible memory for your motherboard and their prices should be well within your budget.	St
1.2.8	Good luck!	St
1.3.1	great.	St
1.3.2	In general, PC3200 [DDR 400] will run in the meory slot, HOWEVER it will only run at the slower speed that the mobo supports [DDR 333 in this case].	St
1.3.3	Everest says that it supports DDR 400, if so then the only question is whether or not the CPU that you have supports the 400 MHz FSB.	St
1.3.4	If it does, then then you don't want a mix of PC2700 and PC3200 because all the memory will run at the lower speed.	St
1.3.5	We really need to know what CPU you have in the system.	St
1.3.6	IMHO tis very unlikely that you'll notice any difference between 2.5 and 3, However it is best to use sticks with the same CL to insure that the mobo uses the faster timing of 2.5.	St
1.3.7	Judy seems to detect a noticeable difference.	St
1.3.8	You'll certainly see a difference running DDR 400 IF your CPU supports the 400 MHz FSB.	St
1.4.1	I'll be getting rid of the PC2700 stick once I order the new ram, this is the info which everest gives me: CPU Properties CPU Type	St
1.5.1	support.	St
1.5.2	Seems that Everest says that the CPU has a multiplier of 18 and uses 166 MHz FSB to get that.	St
1.5.3	Intel quad pumps that to give a 533 MHz FSB Everest reports 533 MHz FSB, HOWEVER that may simply because you hane PC 2700.	St
1.5.4	For the PC3200 to be effective the CPU would have to support an 800 MHz FSB.	St
1.5.5	A link to Intel CPU info http://processorfinder.intel.com/scripts/list.asp You will note that there are no 2.4 P4's that support 800 MHZ, max is 533.	St
1.5.6	Thus PC3200 is of no real use.	St
1.5.7	However is it really that much more expensive?	St
1.5.8	May want to buy it for possible upgrading later.	St
1.5.9	However you have a fairly old chipset and thus an upgrade to a new mobo and Intel P4 it will likely use DDR2 memory.	St
1.5.10	So, upon rethinking, probably not worth it.	St
1.6.1	this is what everest reports for chipset: Field	St
1.7.1	install a CPU that supports the 800 MHz FSB.	St
1.7.2	As seen in the link that I provided, there are NO p4 2.4 GHz CPU that supports 800 MHz FSB.	St
