(also, i already check to verify i have the correct type of RAM)

I have a widescreen monitor and parts of words were cut off, so I hope everything makes sense. PC - HP Pavilion a630n BIOS Version - 3.04 07/05/04 Core Version - 8.00.10 Memory Bank 0 - 256 mb Memory Bank 1 - Not Installed Memory Bank 2 - 256 mb Memory Bank 3 - Not Installed I installed the new RAM in Bank 3. As I mentioned also, I had installed it in Bank 0 and tooke out the 2-256 mb RMA and got a beeping noise when I started my PC. 2 - 256 mb RAM preinstalled on computer by manufacture 1 - 1 gb RAM PNY DIMM RAM PC3200 184 pin Let me know if there is any other info you would need.

Proffitt	7/5/08 3:24 PM	1.21527144E12	Check your bios.	http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=pv-40502-1&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=426322&os=228&lang=en notes a much newer version. Hp and others release these to add support for ram and more. http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Pavilion+a630n notes DDR PC3200 memory. So while you have that spec covered lets hope this bios helps. Be sure to double check if I found the right and latest version for your machine. Bob

3492	9	300158	2806239	2806008	Willy	7/6/08 7:58 AM	1.21533108E12	RAM map	Check the specs and/or manual to see just what ram amounts can be installed. After all that's what its for. The manual may show just how the memory can be installed or mixed ram using memory map. Your 256'ers are being as DDR slots and then placing a single ram stick just isn'y working, though it may if the ram map is followed or using yet another 1gb stick of ram to make a &quot;pair&quot;. tada -----Willy

I have a DELL XPS 400, purchased oct. 05 with 2 memory cards, 512mb each, in Dimm1 and Dimm 3. [XP 2000, UltraSmart monitor, nvidia geforce 6800, 32bit OS] Today, I installed 2 PNY DDR2-667-533-400 memory sticks in Dimm 2 and Dimm3. Total memory after installation: 3 gigs. [3,0024 mb] I reconnected all cables and booted up. The computer sounded an &quot;alarm&quot; sound: 2 &quot;beeps&quot;, pause, 2 &quot;beeps&quot;, pause, 2 &quot;beeps&quot;. The monitor powered up, but no image. I pushed the status buttons on the bottom of the monitor and received a prompt message saying: No Input Signal Detected&quot;---- or words to that effect, or a message that says: &quot;In Power saving Mode. Move mouse or hit any key to activate.&quot; Moving the mouse or hitting any key does nothing. The computer sounds like it is functioning as normal, except for the alarm beeps at the beginning of the boot. I removed the PNY sticks and rebooted. Same problem: 6 alarm sounds and no monitor input. I've listened closely to the alarm sounds, and they appear to be coming from the usb ports in the back [5 in back...2 in front], but I can't confirm that. Further research indicates that what I am hearing are &quot;BIOS alarm codes&quot;. I've double checked and re-checked all my hook-ups. The monitor cable is correct. All peripherial cables are in usb ports correctly. any advice or insight to my problem will be greatly appreciated. thanks!

3492	12	300158	2806283	2806274	skittzy	7/6/08 10:25 AM	1.2153399E12	It's working now!	Here's what I did: I disconnected the computer. I removed ALL memory sticks, old and new. I restarted the computer without the memory sticks installed. I immediately turned the computer off. Disconnected the computer. I installed then new memory sticks into the Dimm slots where the old memory sticks were. Booted up fine, then. No beeps. Monitor works. Everything [so far] seems to be running just great. Apparently, my computer will not allow two different kinds of memory installed....despite what the Geek Squad down at my local Best Buy told me. thanks
3492	13	300158	2806762	2806283	squirtlewa	7/7/08 7:20 AM	1.2154152E12	prob'ly true, but...	&quot;Apparently, my computer will not allow two different kinds of memory installed....despite what the Geek Squad down at my local Best Buy told me.&quot; My hunch is Geek Squad told you technically correct. Technically-correct vs. reality are sometimes different. There's some low-level tweaking to be done. In your case, I'd think sticking with 2 GB what's working is a good approach.

So I took the 1GB stick out of that PC and put it into my PC at home. Everything's fine now. For some reason, that RAM stick just didn't want to work in my PC and I'm not sure why.

3492	17	300158	2808627	2806275	Willy	7/9/08 7:48 PM	1.21563288E12	Sit down and start over	If it worked before and only ram was changed and now no video, then return old ram into system. if the problem persists then somehow the video got disconnected, inspect closely. Once that's resolved, return new ram back in. Yes, the beeps refer to a bios error code, find out wht it means to your system, but since no video it pretty much narrows it down. if the ram you brought was the proper type&class for your system, then it should work once installed properly. Though you mentioned that you rehecked your work, sometimes the little things do get by, &quot;don't take anything for granted&quot;. tada -----Willy
