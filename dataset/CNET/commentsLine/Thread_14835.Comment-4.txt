go to the ati site and download the basic, no frills package first.
uninstall everything you have put on so far and run the basic driver file.
now, the two monitors means your card has two video ports.
i am guessing one vga and one dvi so this is ok. you did not mention if your board was ati built or from another manufacturer (such as sapphire) that uses their chipset.
i can't speak for this card but had a similar experience where the a card was finiky about who supplied the drivers.
in short, don't add all the features and controls until you get a basic driver working.
