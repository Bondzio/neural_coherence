<s> I have a Dell Desktop PC. </s>
<s> It's a Celeron 2.4Ghz, with 768MB RAM, Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> I've installed a Cicero PCI Firewire card into one of the 3 PCI slots. </s>
<s> Upon bootup, the drivers seem to install but under device manager, it simply says under the card that &quot;The device could not start.&quot; I thought that maybe the card was sharing the same IRQ as something else, so I swapped it positions with the adjacent ethernet card. </s>
<s> Same problem still occurs, yet the ethernet card works fine in both slots. </s>
<s> The card is fairly old and I can't find specific drivers for it, though I've read that it works with standard Texas Instruments drivers, which is what I already have installed. </s>
<s> Is there any other course of action I should try taking before I smash this card with a hammer? </s>
<s> http://www.flexbeta.net/forums/lofiversion/index.php/t7614.html You wouldn't be the first to have issues with it. </s>
<s> blaisadam: Im at Dell Headquarters in Austin, Texas and I just came across the thread. </s>
<s> I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with this. </s>
<s> If you're certain the slot is good and you cant get it to work with the latest bios and any of the drivers you come across I would give up and pursue returning the card. </s>
<s> If you have any questions feel free to contact me. </s>

<s> Well, I bought a brand new PCI Firewire card today (an nGear) and it's giving me the same problem!!! </s>
<s> I did some more searching and I've discovered that the problem is Windows XP SP2. </s>
<s> The new SP2 drivers somehow don't work. </s>
<s> I tried a workaround that I found somewhere that uses the SP1 drivers instead. </s>
<s> Doing this, the card shows up fine now in the Device Manager (no more &quot;Device will not start&quot;) but there's still one problem... the card won't work! </s>
<s> I plugged in my camera and nothing happened, tried to add the camera through the Control Panel, it didn't detect it... </s>
<s> There has to be some type of workaround for this. </s>
<s> I will keep trying, but any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I don't see which system you have so I can't suggest which I'd install. </s>
<s> Why did you leave out the details? </s>

<s> The computer's hard drive hasn't been formatted since we got it. </s>
<s> Would Dell really ship something with missing drivers? </s>
<s> Oh wait... maybe they would... </s>
<s> Someone accepts a driver from Windows Update. </s>
<s> Too bad you didn't tell the model number so I could share the driver(s) I would use. </s>
<s> So while it may ship with drivers, these can be replaced or &quot;old&quot;. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, after 2 and 1/2 hours on the phone with Dell tech support (Canada), the problem is finally solved. </s>
<s> It wasn't working because of the way the devices were installed in the PCI slots. </s>
<s> The initial (bad) setup was: Slot 1 ---&gt; D-Link Wifi card Slot 2 ---&gt; Firewire card Slot 3 ---&gt; 56K modem After some mixing and matching, the configuration that finally worked was: Slot 1 ---&gt; Firewire card Slot 2 ---&gt; empty Slot 3 ---&gt; D-Link Wifi card I never use the 56K modem (who does?) </s>
<s> so we got rid of that. </s>
<s> We figure the modem had some kind of conflict with something else. </s>
<s> Before doing this, we updated the BIOS, chipset drivers and installed a patch from Microsoft that had to with enabling 1394 enumeration. </s>
<s> The system is a Dell Dimension 2400. </s>
