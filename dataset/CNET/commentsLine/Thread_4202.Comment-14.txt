you go a dozzie there.
i suggest leave it as is, a minimized system.
try using the cmos clearing pin(s) to return to defaults.
reverify when the power returns and reset to the small system.
allow to finish booting, if it can.
if it doesn't and continues as it did, i believe the vrm is kaput, basically the mtrbd.
got zapped.
the vrm is a stable mtrbd.
power cleaner and/or distrubes the power to mtrbd.
componets, if you can pin-point the bad componet, it maybe a triac or diode that doesn't release when it should and puts a flase state until the power bleeds away from caps.
that's a wag but if anything i believe its the mtrbd.
at fault somewhere.
you mentioned you swapped similar mtrbds.
but you kept the componets like memory, etc.
unfortunately the problem if 1/2 of one can resurface as still 1 or 2 componets going bad.
you need a good test bed and test all componets until happy they're not it plus they work well alone with other good componets but the orginal componets if placed together again may again cause problems.
its's a pita but that's the way it is.
good luck -----willy
