I've tried a clean install and the OS is unstable.
Sometimes it finds everything during install sometimes it claims files missing from install source.
I've tried a few source discs all to find the same issues.
Somtimes it hangs during install, sometimes it doesn't..
It must be the drive, I'll contact the manufacturer to recieve another RMA and hope it turns out in my favor.
Anyone have any other advice?
