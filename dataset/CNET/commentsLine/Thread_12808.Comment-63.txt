i prefer custom builds, because of more durable parts.
most name brands incorporate descent parts with cheap parts.
i believe a good power supply, processor, hard drive, good quality compatable memory and motherboard is the key to a lasting system.
i have worked on a lot of name brands and all have the same parts.
dell uses different parts.
the processor, memory, and hard drive, are the best parts.
motherboard and power supply are weak will not withstand power outage surges.
so buyer beware!!!
!name brands are reasonable, have weak power supplys and will kill your motherboard.
