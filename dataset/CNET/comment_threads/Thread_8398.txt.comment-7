Making a &quot;backup&quot; means making a copy of the data on another medium, so you can &quot;restore&quot; it if anything happens to the original.
Usual ways to backup data on an internal hard disk is copying it to a second inernal disk or an external hard disk, copying it to a USB-drive, burning it to CD or DVD, copying to a tape drive, copying it to a drive somewhere else in the (home or office) network.
Usual ways to backup data on an external hard disk are more or less the same.
Generally it are rather large amounts of data, so the easiest way is to use a second external disk.
I assume the Iomega software is meant to copy data from an internal hard disk TO the external one.
Not about copying data FROM it.
FAT32 disks are more error-prone than disks in the NTFS (for Windows) or Apple filesystem format.
So the first thing to do with an external disk that doesn't need to be used on both Windows and Apple is to delete the partition it comes with and make a more suitable one.
