hear much more details about this locking / unlocking of the hsf.
describe exactly what you are &quot;unlocking&quot; and why you can't get the fan off.
separating the hsf combo from the cpu should be simple, the heat sink compound may cause them to stick together a little but should still be easy to separate.
also it is a combination of a heatsink and a fan.
are you trying to remove the fan from the heat sink????
any chance that you are unlocking the zif connector lever???
[zero insertion force] that allows the cpu to be put in or removed without any insertion force??
had a case in the forums where someone was doing that and caused the cpu contacts to get burned due to poor contact because the lever was not locked.
