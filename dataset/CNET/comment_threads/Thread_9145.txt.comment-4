if your mobo detects you processor correctly and its just the games you play that doesn't, there's the probability that those games weren't written with an ID of your new proc.
so it would just match it with the closest ID it can find.
AMD procs has a different architecture than Intel procs.
they don't crunch data the same way.
so its not really an apple to apple comparison.
