My laptop for work is configured to be on the network at work. It has a static IP and DNS server address. I'd like to be able to use my laptop at home on my Workgroup network. I just can't figure out how. At home everything on the network is set up to Obtain the IP and DNS addresses. I have already joined my work laptop to my home wireless network. This only accomplishes getting me access to the internet. How do I arrange to share files and printers? On the Home PC if I double click My Network Places there is an option to Set Up A Home or Small Office Network. That's usually what I use when I'm configuring a PC at home. But the work PC doesn't have this option. It's only options are: Search Active Directory or Set Up A Wireless Netowrk For A Home Or Small Office. I found a program that will easily allow me to switch which network I'm on but don't I have to join the home network before I can switch to it? Thanks for the guidance. Po

Look at http://www.netswitcher.com/ As to file and printer shares you might want to use a batch file to make the connections? &quot;don't I have to join the home network before I can switch to it?&quot; No. The idea of joining the network is for corporate lans.
