He wants to know which to choose either a Pentium D 3.4 Ghz or a Core 2 Duo E6300 the lowest one I think 1.8 Ghz. If someone can have benchmarks or something please tell me which is better in performance. The pD has a 800Mhz FSB and the Core 2 Duo has a 1066 or something Mhz FSB. Another thing he is asking me that if he had to make a decision, between getting an Nvidia 6200 with a Core 2 Duo OR an Nvidia 7600 with Pentium D, which would be better assuming prices are similar. I told him that if he didnt need gaming graphics, he should go with the Core 2 Duo combo but I would go for the better graphic card. Please i need an answer very fast. I will checkback in a few hours (2-4). Thank You

The NVIDIA 6200 is a pretty weiner card though - I would go with a mid-range 7600 instead or even an older ATI 1800 depending on price. Many of the tradeoffs you are asking about really require more detail on what your friend is prioritizing going forward. With NVIDIA getting to release the new 8800 cards expect some price compression in coming weeks on the other cards. Frankly the best time to make thes decisions will come during the frenzy the day after Thanksgiving.
