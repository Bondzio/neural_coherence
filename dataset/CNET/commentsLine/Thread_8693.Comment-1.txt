for some reason, my wireless receiver decided to stop working this morning.
it's not a battery problem, otherwise the receiver would still light up.
i still get power to the receiver, since i can still charge my mouse, and i sincerely doubt my usb ports died during the night.
i can't get by the bios since it doesn't detect a keyboard.
any advice?
it's a shame when expensive stuff doesn't work.
