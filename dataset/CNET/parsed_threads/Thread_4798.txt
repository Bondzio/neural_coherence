<s> So here's the story: My Actiontec GT704WG router has been getting worse by the day; Dropped connections, incompatibility with some wireless devices...it's just become a pain to have to constantly &quot;powercycle&quot; the thing everytime. </s>
<s> In addition, I was paying a $2.95/month rental fee just to use it! </s>
<s> After researching some reviews, I bought a Linksys WRT54GL router off Amazon, and it just arrived this afternoon. </s>
<s> While setting up, I encountered a problem: My old Actiontec didn't ask for or need a modem. </s>
<s> I was able to connect a phone line between the phone jack and the router, and an Ethernet cable between the router and my PC. </s>
<s> That's all it took for me to get an Internet connection for my PC and a wireless connection for my laptop. </s>
<s> With the Linksys WRT54GL however, this set up is not working. </s>
<s> After some research, it appears the Actiontec actually has a built-in modem! </s>
<s> I've never had to use one, and up until now I assumed whatever this &quot;modem&quot; thing was came built-in to my computer. </s>
<s> My internet company (TDS) is expecting their router back within 10 days, but until I get the Linksys set up, I'll have to keep the Actiontec around a bit longer. </s>
<s> After 10 days, it's a $39.95 fee! </s>
<s> Could someone give me a little crash course in just what a modem is, whether or not I need one, which one would be best for my router, and any other relevant information I might need to know? </s>
<s> Thanks to all for any assistance you can provide. </s>
<s> And I see them given away freely on freecycle.com If you have to buy one I can't tell what area you are in, but 39.99 would be at the low end of what a new DSL modem would cost. </s>
<s> As to &quot;best&quot;, gear supplied and supported by your ISP would be best. </s>
