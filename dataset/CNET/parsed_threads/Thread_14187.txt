<s> So this is my first build ever, just finished it this weekend, and I'm off to a very rough start. </s>
<s> Here's my parts list. </s>
<s> Motherboard : Asus Sabertooth Z77 CPU : Ivy Bridge i5-3570K RAM : Crucial Ballistix 2 x 2GB (1333 MHz) Boot Drive : Crucial M4 128GB Storage Drive : Western Digital Black 2TB PSU : 80+ Gold LEPA 500W Optical Drive : Not sure... something I pulled out of an old box. </s>
<s> I used the stock fan that came with the CPU, and it worked fine for a day. </s>
<s> Then yesterday I got a fan error while booting up. </s>
<s> I looked inside the case and indeed the fan seemed to be stuttering. </s>
<s> It would try and spin up, slow, stop. </s>
<s> Then try and spin up again, repeating the whole process. </s>
<s> I did a reboot, and the problem went away. </s>
<s> Then today I booted it up again and the problem came back, but it's not going away, no matter how many times I reboot. </s>
<s> I checked that the fan is in the right header, and it is. </s>
<s> I looked and I can see 3 headers there. </s>
<s> CPU_FAN, CPU_OPT, and CHA_FAN3. </s>
<s> Just to be sure it's really the fan I tried to boot up with the thing plugged into one of these other headers. </s>
<s> Nothing changed with CPU_OPT, but when I tried the third one the fan started spinning normally. </s>
<s> The computer won't accept it though, it still says there is a fan error and goes right into UEFI. </s>
<s> Another thing that puzzles me is that I'm using an Asus board, which comes with Q-LED indicators (those little lights all over the mobo which light up during the boot up). </s>
<s> They are supposed to help you solve a boot up problem by staying red at whatever place the problem occurs. </s>
<s> Except that when I run into the fan problem, the light stays on at the boot drive... </s>
<s> But in UEFI it says my M4 is fine. </s>
<s> Please, any help would be really appreciated. </s>
<s> The Sabertooth has a 5 year warranty, but I don't even know if it's to blame. </s>
<s> I've ordered an aftermarket CPU fan (a Noctua of some sort), but it will be a few days before it gets here. </s>
<s> In the meantime, I'd like to know what my options are. </s>
<s> Should I ask NCIX (the supplier I used) to take it all back? </s>
<s> It's been under a week so it might work, but I guess I would have to repackage them and pay for the shipping and handling... </s>
<s> I was hoping to get this up and running in time for Diablo III... </s>
<s> I doubt I'll make it. </s>
<s> But really at this point I just want a working computer. </s>
<s> Umm... the title should be &quot;Strange CPU Fan Failure&quot;. </s>
<s> Is there a way I can edit that? </s>
<s> I don't see what video card was used. </s>
<s> I missed it? </s>
<s> I see this has 3 12 Volt rails. </s>
<s> Did they offer any way to swap rails? </s>
<s> I had planned on getting a GTX 670 eventually, most people told me that with just one (no SLI) I should be fine with 500 Watts. </s>
<s> But for the time being I was planning on just gaming with the integrated Intel HD 4000. </s>
<s> I had seen samples of game-play on YouTube of HD 3000, and it looked fairly decent. </s>
<s> Especially because I have about a dozen games from 2008 or earlier that I have to catch up on, so an HD 4000 should be plenty, I figure. </s>
<s> I haven't had a decent gaming computer in a long time... </s>
<s> I'm not sure what you mean by swapping rails... </s>
<s> It's semi-modular, it came with a bunch of cables. </s>
<s> I used 1 to connect to my 3 drives, and one to connect to all my fans. </s>
<s> The rest go to the motherboard. </s>
<s> 320 divided by 12 = 26.667 Amperes. </s>
<s> Since any one rail of that PSU is 25 Amperes I wonder why the maker went for a multiple rail PSU. </s>
<s> A single RAIL 500 Watt PSU would have avoided that issue. </s>
<s> Can you share which power supply the fan uses? </s>
<s> Might be a clue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> About 14 centimeters... Is this relevant to what's happening to the CPU fan? </s>
<s> At this point and with this answer it's time for the service counter. </s>
<s> Well, wait, did you mean the CPU fan, because that's like 8 centimeters, I thought you were still talking about the PSU. </s>
<s> Anyway... </s>
<s> I'll wait and see what happens with the new CPU cooler I ordered. </s>
<s> Hopefully it will be here before Friday. </s>
