<s> Hey, guys. </s>
<s> I have a Sapphire Radeon HD 7950 in my computer that isn't being recognized in Device Manager. </s>
<s> I therefore am forced to use the Intel 4K graphics. </s>
<s> I have gone into the BIOS and set the computer to read the PCI slots first, but this was unsuccessful. </s>
<s> How do I get my GPU recognized, and how do I enable it to be the default graphics setting? </s>
<s> Installing drivers has not worked either. </s>
<s> I only have the clues you provided so these are likely incorrect. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Install the latest BIOS. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Connect the PSU lead if required to the GPU card. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Ask the PC maker if they know of any card compatibility issues. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Fit a PSU double the size for a test run. </s>
<s> video. </s>
<s> Save the change and reboot Then make sure the monitor is cabled to the new video card and restart the PC VAPCMD </s>
<s> I tried doing this in the BIOS, and now all I get is a black screen when I boot. </s>
<s> What's wronggggg? </s>
<s> If yes, did you connect it ? </s>
<s> How about you PSU.....exactly which one (PSU) do you have ? </s>
<s> How are you connecting to the monitor...via the VGA or DVI connector ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Yes, I connected the PCI express cable from the power supply to the graphs card. </s>
<s> I have an Antec High Current Gamer 620 W PSU. </s>
<s> I'm connecting to the monitor throughout DVI. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> It's connected via DVI. </s>
<s> use the DVI input or the VGA input ? </s>
<s> In my monitor manual it says: Selecting the Signal Connectors and Cables The monitor features two DVI-I connectors capable of supporting either analog or digital input. </s>
<s> The video mode supported by the DVI-I connector is determined by the video cable used. </s>
<s> - For digital operation, use the DVI-D signal cable provided. </s>
<s> Connect the DVI-D signal cable to a DVI-I connector on the monitor and the other end to the DVI connector on the computer. </s>
<s> - For analog operation, use the DVI-I to VGA signal cable provided. </s>
<s> Connect the DVI-I to VGA signal cable to a DVI-I connector on the monitor and the other end to the VGA connector on the computer. </s>
<s> The monitor will automatically determine which inputs have valid video signals. </s>
<s> The inputs can be selected through the On-Screen Display (OSD) feature by pressing the Input Select button on the front. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Alright, my monitor is working completely fine. </s>
<s> I just need the computer to recognize the video card. </s>
<s> multitude of possibilities without the benefit of being there and knowing the things you've tried. </s>
<s> If you're sure the GPU is fully seated, you've tried it in another slot (if any) and it's not working, do you have another PC you can try it in? </s>
<s> BTW ...what MB or system is this going in ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> My motherboard is the Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H, </s>
<s> The story is too light so far. </s>
<s> The full rundown of both the story, the machine is not here so there's a lot of guessing going on. </s>
<s> I wonder if mr-stat is getting frustrated? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Did you try the new card in one of the other PCIe slots ? </s>
<s> Do you have another GPU to try ? </s>
<s> Now that we know the MB...how is the BIOS set ? </s>
<s> Init Display First: Specifes the frst initiation of the monitor display from the installed PCI graphics card, PCI Express graphics card, or the onboard graphics. </s>
<s> - Auto Lets BIOS automatically configure this setting. </s>
<s> (Default) - IGFX Sets the onboard graphics as the first display. </s>
<s> - PEG Sets the PCI Express graphics card on the PCIEX16 slot as the first display. </s>
<s> - PCI Sets the graphics card on the PCI slot as the first display. </s>
<s> Internal Graphics: Enables or disables the onboard graphics function. </s>
<s> (Default: Auto) VAPCMD </s>
<s> My PC runs completely fine, except that I want to get use out of my GPU and not use Intel's onboard graphics. </s>
<s> I do not have another GPU, and if I tried installing the 7950 into another PCIe slot, it would interfere with things like sata ports because the card is so big. </s>
<s> The BIOS is set to default settings, because I had to clear cmos. </s>
<s> I tried disabling the onboard graphics in the BIOS but this just led to a black screen. </s>
<s> I'm thinking it's just a faulty card. </s>
<s> At this point, I'm looking at other 7950 variants to purchase like this one: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-r7950twinfrozr3gd5oc </s>
<s> Sadly, my 7950 has never worked. </s>
<s> Time to get it tested or just exchange it. </s>
<s> Too bad we couldn't fix the problem, but oh well. </s>
<s> Do you all like this card? </s>
<s> http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-r7950twinfrozr3gd5oc </s>
<s> That card is on the list at tomshardware and you must be sure to have the power to drive it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> buyers are reporting on the cards in question. </s>
<s> Here's a link to GPUs based on the 7950 chipset available at Newegg and how they're rated by the buyers. </s>
<s> You can ignore the ones that downrate the product because of reasons not pertaining to the card itself. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100006662&IsNodeId=1&Description=7950&bop=And&Order=RATING&PageSize=20 Personally I seems a little like a crap shoot...as some arrive DOA, some die after just a few moments and others are just perfect. </s>
<s> At least this gives you some info about the products available from different mfgs based on the 7950 chipset. </s>
<s> I too have been looking for a GPU update but there are so few cards which are consistently rated 5 or 4 which is a sad commentary on product manufacturing QC. </s>
<s> All things considered such a high-end purchase might be better made locally vice the net. </s>
<s> In the event it doesn't work...you just return or exchange it for one that is working. </s>
<s> Let us know how it works out. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
