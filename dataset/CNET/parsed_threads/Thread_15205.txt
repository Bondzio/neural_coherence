<s> I am in the market for a external hard drive these are my reason for wanting one. </s>
<s> I share a computer with other family members, I have a very large music collection, and download about thiry songs a day, I would also like a little security when it comes to my music or video, and i also like to portability of the hard drives. </s>

<s> Do i really need one? </s>
<s> Any advice would be greatly appreciated. </s>
