<s> I want to add more memory (256MB) to my DELL L500r, but am stuck because both 100 MHz and 133 MHz are shown in any catalog refences for this machine. </s>
<s> Een when I consult DELL on line, I get both options. </s>
<s> Are they interchangeable? </s>
<s> There sure seems to be a price difference. </s>
<s> If I look at Crucial.com, it takes PC100, so the faster memory should be fine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So which is faster? </s>
<s> 100 MHz or 133 MHz? </s>
<s> And are they interchangeable? </s>
<s> What happens, for example, if I use 133 and the existing memory is 100? </s>
<s> Doesn't work or runs slower? </s>
<s> 133 is faster but if you mix both speeds it will run at 100 </s>
