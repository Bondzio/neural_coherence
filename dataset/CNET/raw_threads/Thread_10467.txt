9247	0	164593	1819527	NR	oneway	3/20/06 1:56 PM	1.14286296E12	Router	I just got my router/modem today. I hooked it up in one room and put the wireless connection on the other computer which is in the room next door. The internet works fine on the computer that has the router/modem. The internet connection that has the wireless connection does not work well. Sometimes the connection is there and sometimes it is not. It says there is a very low signal and limited connectivity. Is there any way to fix this? Thanks

Download & install latest driver for wireless network adapter. Run Windows Update and install SP2 & all critical updates. Install and update personal firewall, antivirus, and antispyware. Scan with updated antivirus and at least 2 antivirus programs. Router make & model? Wireless network adapter make & model? Operating system on wireless computer? SIGNAL STRENGTH: How far is router from wireless computer? How many walls, material, and how thick? Any 2.4GHz phones or microwaves near router or wireless computer? Do you have the same problem 10 ft away and in same room as router?
