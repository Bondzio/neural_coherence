I agree that a hot heat sink is good thing in as far as it's clearly dissipating heat from the CPU but personally I would be more than a little concered running an eight year old processor at those kind of temperatures for prolonged periods of time.
If you manage to repair your mainboard I would seriously consider spending a little cash on some better cooling solutions.
