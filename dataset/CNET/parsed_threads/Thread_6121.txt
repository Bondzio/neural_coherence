<s> This is a bit confusing for me, but I'd like to use my iPhone 4s which has a 3g Verizon personal hotspot option on an iPad [wifi only] tablet for those times when I'm without wifi. </s>
<s> I've determined so far that the iPad would have to be a 3rd. </s>
<s> generation device for this to work, but would the iPhone and iPad then have to usb'd together, or on Bluetooth, or how exactly would this work? </s>
<s> Thanks much for your advice. </s>
<s> The hotspot feature does not require any 3rd gen device but simply any other thing that can connect to hotspots which ALL iPads can do. </s>

<s> Just wondering if an iPhone hotspot could connect to a non-Apple device. </s>
<s> Anything that can connect to wifi hotspots should be good to go. </s>
<s> Good question and I wonder how many get an Apple laptop because they were unsure? </s>

<s> What you're saying is good news of course, but I had read this from the Apple site earlier and assumed that when I get the iPad it should/must be a 3rd gen. model. </s>
<s> Maybe they're just trying to upsell me? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> you can turn your 3rd gen iPad or mini INTO a hotspot to connect other devices. </s>
<s> If you have the ones with WiFi AND cellular. </s>
