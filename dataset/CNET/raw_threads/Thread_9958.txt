If I do not do so the data i've just saved is sometimes lost. What causes this loss of data? Why is it so important to &quot;properly&quot; disconnect the disk-on-key. David

I've lived with another USB key and this one has an activity LED which after watching and testing found that all is well if I wait for the LED to stop, then one final blink and then I've never lost a thing if I yank it then. The &quot;why?&quot; is this. Even if windows finished copying something there on the screen, in the background data is still being written out. Pull the device during a write or when a file is open and you may see file system damage or loss. Bob
