Below is the configuration on Aux port on Line (n): line aux 0 login local modem InOut transport input all speed 115200 flowcontrol hardware I have US Robotics 56k Faxmodem which is connected to aux port of router and I am using USB dialup modem with my laptop to dailin to the router which is connected to a US Robotics Faxmodem. Then I have accessed my USB dialup modem throught HyperTerminal and I can issue all &quot;at&quot; commands and to dialin to the modem I have used the following command atdt914011111111 (atdt followed by country code, area code and landline number) Once I issue the above command it give me message &quot;Connected&quot; and after this I just get a flashing cursor. I cannot do anything nor will it display a username login prompt.

If you are using a normal rj45 roll cable you need to make sure the adapter on the end is designed to convert a cisco roll cable to the proper db25/db9 pinout. You could try to test from the router itself to see if the modem will talk to you. I think you telnet to the router address on port 2001 on a 1900 but you need to check the port number. The modem should respond OK when you hit enter. You also need to check before you dial in that on the show line display there is not a * before the aux port. Sometime it will get confused and think the aux port is in use but it is not. You need to clear the line and see if tha corrects it. Most the time I have better luck using the console port rather than the aux.
