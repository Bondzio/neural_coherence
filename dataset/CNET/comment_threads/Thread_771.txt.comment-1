In a previous post I got my CD burner working.
It's an HP CD burner in a BYTECC external USB case.
Was using wrong speed CD media.
In device manager the drive is listed as an LG CDRW CED-8080B drive, not the HP CD12i (12-10-32 speed) drive.
It's apparently the firmware in the case.
How can I get the drive to be recognized as an HP drive?
BTW, zero help at the BYTECC site, I have filed complaints.
Thanks.
