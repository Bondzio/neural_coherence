Hi I have been using windows xp professional with my current setup and its been really slowing down as of yet. I was wondering if maybe trying out the windows vista beta was worth a try or the 64 Bit version of XP to speed up the system or maybe someone can give me any other other advice as to speed it up. My Rig: AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ ASUS A8N-SLI MOBO Patriot Signature Series 1GB Dual Channel Radeon X800XL PCIe 256 MB DDR Any comments would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

When i first built the system, it would let me run two or three different tasks at once with no problem. Now i have issues when i am trying to use internet explorer and media player at the same time. I just get tired of reinstalling windows. Is there a reason that causes this slowdown, as i have defragged and optimized the page files and all already.

Try using ewido, Ad-Aware, PC-Cillin(30 day trial). Uncheck start-up keys that you dont need in msconfig. (Type msconfig in &quot;run&quot; and then click the start-up tab. Download CCleaner (free from download.com) and delete invalid registry keys. Its safe to delete keys using this program because it only scans for invalid keys and gives you a list of registry keys that are safe to delete. Check your CPU and RAM usage in the task manager under preformance during normal tasks. If the CUP or RAM is almost always being 100% used there might be a hardware problem. Open up your computer's case and remove as much dust as you can. Dust can cause slow downs and even overheating by acting like a blanket on your motherboard. I hope some of these make your computer run faster. I also wouldnt recomend a beta OS because a newer beta will come out later or the official OS will be out and you will have to upgrade again. I would stick to Windows XP for now

But Vista will slow down any system incredible due to all the resources it uses. XP should be okay with a Gig of RAM but a clean install might help. I would go with simple unix based systems www.ubuntu.com or www.pcbsd.org both are very good. check them out, your computer will run like new. I recommend deleting the whole hard drive but you can dual boot with windows pretty seamlessly. There are some limitations with the programs available but it's worth it and a learning experience
