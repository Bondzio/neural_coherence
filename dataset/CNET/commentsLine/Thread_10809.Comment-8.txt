i've had one for about 6 months and it works great, no complaints whatsoever.
reception has been very clear but it does seem to work better with some phones than others.
i have the highest speed cable modem which might help.
using on a vista hp laptop.
again, on some phones, entering data from the phone, e.g., a credit card number, can be unreliable.
seems to work better with a 2.4 mghz phone than a 5.8. it was worth the money, that's for sure.
it's paid for itself in long distance calls many times over.
