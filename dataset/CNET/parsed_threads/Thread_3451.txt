<s> I just ordered from Hsn a lexmark x7170 all in one printer, but I keep reading bad stuff about lexmark, I hope I didn't make a mistake, lexmark claims if they can't solve problem within 48 hrs. </s>
<s> they will ship new one. </s>
<s> It was a good price with alot of software. </s>
<s> please someone let me know asap about this printer </s>
<s> Has been around for a long time. </s>
<s> I've never owned one (I stick to Canon) but it's like what's better, Ford or Chevy? </s>
<s> If it does what you want, fine. </s>
<s> If it breaks, and they honor their warranty, well. </s>
