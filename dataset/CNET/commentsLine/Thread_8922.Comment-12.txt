can you supply an article that said it was?
since we don't need a router to connect a pc and test, why isn't that done?
i supplied a little detail about router issues i hit last year.
netgear was my personal experience and my shop buddies tell me of the others.
it doesn't mean this model has the issue but i keep an eye open for it.
