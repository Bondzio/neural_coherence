since the machine with the issue is a fresh install of windows 7, it's drivers may be what microsoft supplied.
which most folk are learning (again) that we must find our drivers just like we have for over a decade.
sorry but your link to mediafire is not one i can use.
that site is too full of bad things for me to consider trying.
-&gt; bottomline?
find the laptop maker's page for drivers for this laptop and install the drivers they tell you for windows 7. bob
