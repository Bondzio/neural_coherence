1.1.1	I am running an IBM 300PL 450mhz PIII with 256megs of RAM with WinXP and I am interested in the multiple monitors setup.	St
1.1.2	My current graphics card is an S3 Trident onboard VGA.	St
1.1.3	I've attempted to include the onboad output with a PCI card for the setup and also 2 PCI cards.	St
1.1.4	Each card when individually in use works fine, but when i attempt to use them in a multiple monitor setup, the computer says one is a [Code 10: The device does not work.]	St
1.1.5	My only explanation is that the bios wont let me have the setup cause the second card does not show up when i boot it.	St
1.1.6	The bios dates to 2001.	St
1.1.7	Any help would be GREAT.	St
1.1.8	thanx	St
1.2.1	&quot;My current graphics card is an S3 Trident onboard VGA.&quot; and that's about all we know about your hardware for the video.	St
1.2.2	Have you tried a dual output PCI card like a Matrox or a pair of things that others have seen working?	St
1.2.3	It's not a BIOS issue.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	No, I have not tried a dual output, I've only tried a combination of PCI cards and I thought this should work because I know others who have used a setup like what Im trying to create... are you sure its not a bios issue?	St
1.4.1	&quot;I've only tried a combination of PCI cards and I thought this should work because I know others who have used a setup like what Im trying to create... are you sure its not a bios issue?&quot; Yes.	St
1.4.2	I did have a few dual PCI card setups.	St
1.4.3	All were combos like a pair of ATI cards that had the needed dual display capable drivers or a pair of Matrox Millenium cards.	St
1.4.4	Been there, done that.	St
1.4.5	It's all in the cards and drivers.	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanx, I'll work on it.	St
