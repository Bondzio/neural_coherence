I know that when my fans are on 100%, sometimes i hear a weird buzzing noise, but i just put a book or something heavy against the case and it stops.
I think my case is suffering from metal fatique and causing unwanted vibrations which causes the buzzing.
If its not this, than you're looking at a problems with one of the fans.
Be sure to clean off the dust.
