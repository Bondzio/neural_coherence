1.1.1	I'm trying to set up a virtual hotspot (like with the program Connectify) to allow my Nintendo DS to connect to the internet through my PC.	St
1.1.2	Connectify would have worked if it weren't for the fact that the DS isn't compatible with Ad Hoc mode nor is it compatible with any form of security other than WEP (the program uses WPA2).	St
1.1.3	So, are there any programs that can allow me to create a virtual hotspot with WEP?	St
1.1.4	I mainly run Windows 7 but I have access to Linux Mint.	St
1.2.1	http://myst.forumotion.com/t368-wifi-on-a-nintendo-ds	St
1.3.1	Thanks.	St
1.3.2	Do you happen to know if it's possible to do this without an adapter?	St
1.3.3	I don't have one but they seem to be cheap so I could just buy one in the worst case scenario.	St
1.4.1	While I see it is possible on my Dell with it's &quot;DW WLAN Card Utility&quot; (google that) I think this is unsupportable.	St
1.4.2	It looks to require you hardwire to the internet router to free up the wifi card to do what you ask.	St
1.4.3	If I were to use a router and ICS (see google) then we run into the old ICS headaches.	St
1.4.4	I don't see a free fix given the details of the HOST PC.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
