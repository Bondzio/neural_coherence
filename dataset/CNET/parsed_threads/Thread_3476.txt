<s> ihave 8 computers, if i'm using only 2 computers it's just fine. </s>
<s> but when i added a hub compose of 6 computers i can't connect anymore. </s>
<s> need help here </s>
<s> What operating systems on the computers? </s>
<s> What ROUTER model number? </s>
<s> What &quot;HUB&quot; model number? </s>
<s> Wired or wireless network adapters? </s>
<s> Please elaborete on what &quot;i can't connect anymore&quot; means? </s>
<s> Anytime you use a hub to connect devices, each device connected to the hub diminishes the bandwidth from the source (in this case your internet connection coming from your pc). </s>
<s> I would suggest you get a switch instead and plug all 8 machines into it along with the incoming internet connection. </s>
<s> Everytime something is plugged into a hub, it cuts the original bandwidth or transfer speed in half. </s>
