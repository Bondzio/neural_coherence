i have a hard drive out of a dell inspiron mini1012 that has the original o/s (win7) and all factory info on it (replaced it with a ssd and did a fresh install of win7).
is it possible to put this drive in a dell dimension that i have upgraded with a decent graphics card, sound card, 3gb ram, new 3.06gb northwoodht processor, and am running windows 8 consumer preview on?
i have the original dell install discs and all.
i also have acronis true image that i can back-up with.
i see that i don't have anything to lose to try, but would like to have some input on proper procedure/technique if possible!
i can always put the old drive back in if it doesn't work.
also, i have a ide to sata conversion board, so hopefully the new drive will be recognized.
i should also mention that i no longer have the inspiron mini, which may be an issue if info from it is needed.
