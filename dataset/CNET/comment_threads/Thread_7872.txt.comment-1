Hi, So i've currently got a Sony STR-K502 reciever hooked up to my computer, and i want to get surround sound out of this thing!
im to lazy to go out and purchase a bunch of analog-to-split cables to i was wondering if i could get a santa cruz montego card and use the digital SPDIF to get surround sound on games?
from what i've read Dolby Digital Live can do this on optical.. so if i were to buy this card and use the optical to my reciever would i have true surround sound?
thanks!
