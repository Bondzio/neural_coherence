<s> i have problem on setup multiple displays. </s>
<s> I using DVI(1meter) connect to my acerx203H and VGA(1M) connect to my HDTV. </s>
<s> It is able to display my screen. </s>
<s> The problem is when i replace the VGA(1M) to VGA(10M) cable, then there is no more display on my HDTV. </s>
<s> So i wonder whether is my VGA(10M) have problem and i use it to connect between pc n my ACER X203H. </s>
<s> It have display but blur. </s>
<s> Then only i notice the length of VGA cable will affect the display quality. </s>
<s> But is this the reason my HDTV cant show? </s>
<s> or other settings than i forgotten? </s>
<s> Because the problem is just between 1M vga cable and 10M vga cable.. </s>
<s> This is why they make video extender boxes like this -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/VGA-Over-CAT5-Extender-Audio/dp/B001PBO5YK Nothing really busted here but there are limits to how long cables can be. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> so is the cable length make no display ? </s>
<s> Or the cable has a defect. </s>
<s> This is not to write why longer cables create issues but it's a well known issue with VGA signals that has been around for nearly 2 decades. </s>
