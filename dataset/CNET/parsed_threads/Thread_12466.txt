<s> MY computer has Intel d102 mother board having ATI Display chipset with 512MB Kingston DDRII RAM nad my HD is of Segate 160 GB SATA. </s>
<s> Now my system goes hung up very often and my Samsung Sync Master monitor gets restart after every few minutes. </s>
<s> Please help me with a solution </s>

<s> It is the same machine I have installed the DirectX but the problem continues. </s>
<s> The flickering of my monitor is not going. </s>
<s> It still flicker or blinks whther I do something or not. </s>
<s> Thats why I have thought may be RAM is getting damaged or is there any other problem? </s>
<s> How can I troubleshoot this problem please help. </s>
<s> Swap it with the monitor from another PC. </s>
<s> If it still flickers with the other PC, it's the monitor (probably a bad contact or capacitor inside). </s>
<s> If the 'new' monitor flickers on your PC, it's something inside the PC. </s>
<s> But my guess is that it's the monitor. </s>

<s> Thanks, My monitor had some problem. </s>
<s> i have called the samsung service engineer they have detected some problem in PCB kit ( in sweep circuit probably). </s>
<s> I will get it back may be in a week. </s>
<s> Now I am using a Dell monitor but is not supporting Counter Strike CZero. </s>
<s> pixels are getting missaligned and colour contrast is also bad </s>
