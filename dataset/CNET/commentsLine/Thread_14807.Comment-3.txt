if ddr, ebay it.
ditto with the 6800gt since a new $80 video card will be faster and you probably won't be able to play retail blu-ray discs with the 6800 gt (since it has no hd acceleration nor hdcp).
if you have a retail version of xp, you'll be able to re-use it.
otherwise, bank on getting a new os (vista).
look into intel p45 based mobos.
here's a bunch:  don't be fooled into thinking that higher cost = higher performance.
mobos using the same chipset all perform with 2-3% of each other.
if you don't plan on overclocking, just go by best price with the features you want.
(no need to pay extra for things you won't use like dual gigabit lan ports.)
