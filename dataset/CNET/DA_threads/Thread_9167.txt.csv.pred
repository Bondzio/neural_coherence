1.1.1	Does anyone know if Apple is ever going to add a Customizable Equalizer to the Ipod?	St
1.1.2	Thank you everyone, CHUSITO1975	St
1.2.1	&quot;I can give you a definite perhaps or even a positive maybe that the Customizable Equalizer will be built into the iPod before the end of the millennium&quot; Or, Your guess is as good as anyone else's, given that Apple are very quiet about future plans P	St
1.3.1	I was hoping to get a response from you.	St
1.3.2	Right now I have been using the &quot;Jazz&quot; setting on the Equalizer.	St
1.3.3	It's the one that sounds the best when using the included Ipod headphones.	St
1.3.4	I have been shopping around for &quot;in ear&quot; bud headphones, but do not know which ones to get.	St
1.3.5	Any suggestions?	St
1.3.6	Thanks again, CHUSITO1975	St
1.4.1	actually, snap!	St
1.4.2	i also used to use the jazz - best mix of quality overall... About earphones - whats your budget??	St
1.4.3	About the EQ, you CAN create custom EQ for - NOT on - the ipod... http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61567 hope helps/..	St
