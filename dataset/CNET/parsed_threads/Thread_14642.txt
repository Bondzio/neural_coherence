<s> i got a RADEON X-700 PRO for my birthday the other day but is that the best card for for the price? </s>
<s> i have been looking around on this site, but just can't make up my mind... what other cards are good or better and what can $50 extra give me? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> HIS Radeon X1300Pro Platinum PCIe 256MB(Model H130PRP256; GPU RV515PRO; GPU frecv. </s>
<s> 600 MHz; mem:256 MB(DDR2); bus 128 bits; memory frecv:800 MHz; DirectX 9.0c; VGA Output; TV Output; DVI Output; RAMDAC 400 MHz; passive cooling. </s>
<s> For the price you seek this is the best you can get. </s>
<s> And much more, you will have support for the last optimizations in games. </s>
<s> (sorry for my english) </s>
<s> You can get a X1300Pro cheaper but for around the same price as the X700Pro go for the X1600Pro. </s>
<s> The X1600Pro is comparable to a 6600GT, if not better. </s>
<s> My X1300Pro plays Call of Duty 2, BF2, Half-life 2, Age of Empires 3, and more on medium settings with no noticeable lag. </s>
<s> The X1600Pro will be even better with 12 pixel pipelines and a higher clock. </s>
<s> However I'd buy this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130263 $99 after $30 rebate. </s>
<s> Just look around at newegg.com and set yourself a budget and see what's the best deal. </s>
