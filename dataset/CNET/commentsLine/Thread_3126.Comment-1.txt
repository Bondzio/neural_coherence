hi, i'm a student, and i am in need of a new comp for christmas.
i am considering a fast computer (core 2 duo) that can run many apps.
i was looking at the 20 inch imac and the slim xps desktop for dell.
i am not sure what desktop to get.
do you guys have any suggestions of a desktop that is perfect for fast performance?
i also want to play a little games.
i don't want to waste my money and crappy computer so what is a good one?
core 2 duo at least 1 gb ram 250 above gb hard drive good graphics card thanks
