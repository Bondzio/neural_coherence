<s> The internal power cable in my external hard drive case is broken, and I have googled everywhere but can't find where to replace it. </s>
<s> Anyone have a link for me to a place I can buy it online? </s>
<s> You mentioed &quot;molex&quot; which is the brand of connector and usually refers to the inside power cable as well. </s>
<s> if that's the case, get your hands on a &quot;Y-cable&quot; and splice and dice as necessary. </s>
<s> if it is something more different, look at these websites: http://www.jdr.com http://www.cyberguys.com http://www.allelectronics.com Get the part if available or something that has the part in order to slice it all together. </s>
<s> For a neat job, you may want &quot;shrink wrap&quot; to insulate and pretty the job up. </s>
<s> Tada -----Willy </s>
<s> There has to be a place that has it ready made. </s>
<s> I'm not handy with wire-cutters and shrink-wrapping and splicing and dicing. </s>
<s> I don't want a y-splitter. </s>
<s> I just want a short little cable with 4 pins on either end, both female. </s>
<s> One end plugs into the external drive case on the inside circuit board, and the other end plugs into the power plug on the hard drive or dvd burner. </s>
<s> THAT would be simple! </s>
<s> Where do I get such a cable? </s>
<s> You didn't mention diddy about who makes the product. </s>
<s> So, in this case contact them(manufacturer) for any reference for a replacement cable. </s>
<s> Contact the orginal vendor and go from there for the &quot;exact&quot; cable replacement. </s>
<s> If none of this helps or resolves the issue then you're stuck with my first reply, that's the way it goes, especially on special or non-big selling products. </s>
<s> Overall, going with what little you did mention, splicing and dicing is a quick resolution if the cable itself isn't so unique. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The external case was cheap and I got no customer service from the place I got it. </s>
<s> The manufacturer shouldn't make a difference. </s>
<s> The bottom line is, I thought this was just a simple computer cable that connects a hard drive to the pc power source... the smaller end connects to the pc and the larger end connects to the drive. </s>
<s> These appear in EVERY external case and also in the computer, so they must be standard. </s>
<s> The y cables you mentioned wouldn't work, because all they are is extension cables if you want to add a second drive, and the single end is just a male power extension cable, it doesn't have the mini-4-pin end. </s>
<s> Does anyone ELSE have any suggestions on where to find this cable? </s>
<s> I think it's at the nearby electronics store. </s>
