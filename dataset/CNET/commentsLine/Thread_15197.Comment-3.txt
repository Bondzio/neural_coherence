a computer is not a cpu.
you can pt an old sound card in your computer, but 1st identify the make & model # and do a search for drivers for it.
you can just try it first, but 98 has very few drivers built into it - you'll most likely need to find & download the appropriate drivers (then hope the card is any good) it would be a lot less headache to buy a card complete with driver cd for @ $15 - $20
