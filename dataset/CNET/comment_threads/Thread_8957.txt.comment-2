http://www.usbman.com fielded a few questions on this one.
Turned out the XP was not patched up to what Microsoft was offering (SP1 and such.)
The issue of motherboard drivers is also an issue.
Many still rely on Microsoft.
But without knowing what motherboard you have, I can't tell if such is needed.
In short, things may just need: a.
Windows Update to latest.
b. Motherboard drivers (sorry, can't tell with your supplied info.)
