800	0	91065	1024617	NR	hoss9009	3/7/05 9:22 PM	1.11023052E12	firmware?	i've had a sony dru-530A for about 9 months now and i just updated the firmware to allow me to burn dvd-r's from 4x to 8x.... and so i bought some dvd-r's at 8x. Now when the cd's burn, they burn with a visible line in the middle from the edge of the disk to the center. The section that is closer to the disk's center, is much more prominant and looks like it has a much thicker burn. The other section looks weak, almost as if it barely burned that section. So then i went out and bought some other dvd's. Same thing. Now since i did the firmware update, (which im guessing is the problem) can i uninstall it? Eric
