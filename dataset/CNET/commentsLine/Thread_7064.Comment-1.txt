i am presently using an hp 1355 all-in-one printer.
i also use nero as my jewel box and label printer programme.
i was told that there is an all-in-one printer that will also print a label on a cd or dvd.
i have so far only found one - an epson.
i understand that epson printers are a little on the thirsty side and only capable of using small capacity, and expensive, ink cartridges.
does anybody have any suggestions about the most econimical one to use, and what the price range - preferably euros - might be?
many thanks, in advance, for taking the time to answer this.
