As long as you use Microsoft Office on both(i think) you can do it easily, without any converting and stuff.
Also, almost all usb stick drives, card readers, memory cards, ext-hdds connect to Mac computers, so sharing other files is easy too.
Just don't worry about it.
Even if what I said here doesn't work, you will find a way.
