The old SCSI drives had a jumper which in English said &quot;Spin up when you get power&quot; and the other setting was &quot;Don't spin up until you get a command from the SCSI controller.&quot; If the controller was not set proper and it former setting was used, a boot failure occurs.
The joy of SCSI.
