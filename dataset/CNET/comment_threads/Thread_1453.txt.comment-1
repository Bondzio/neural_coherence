Hi...
I'm Immanuel here...
I'm confused whether i'm supposed to enable the S.M.A.R.T capability for the Hard Disk's i have...
I've got a 80GB SATA Hard disk and a 160GB IDE hard disk..
I use Windows XP and a 915 Intel chipset Please help...
I don't want to spoil my hard disk because of a wrong setting.
