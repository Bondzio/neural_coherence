<s> What kind of performance increase would I be looking at from a Intel Core 2 Duo 2.66Ghz 1333Mhz FSB to a Intel Core 2 Extreme 3.0Ghz 1600Mhz FSB? </s>
<s> I only use my computer for school and, more power hungry, video editing. </s>
<s> I'm told my processor is already super fast for what I do and most apps are geared toward only duel cores anyway. </s>
<s> All that aside, however, I do have a weakness for the latest greatest stuff. </s>
<s> If I did get the core 2 extreme with a 1600Mhz FSB, I would have to get a new motherboard. </s>
<s> How much of an increase in performance would I be looking at if I went with an Intel Core 2 Extreme of only 1333Mhz FSB, but still 3.0Ghz instead of the 1600Mhz FSB? </s>
<s> For compute intensive work such as encoding video I'd use the straight division method. </s>
<s> That is 3/2.66 or 12.8% faster. </s>
<s> However since it's not in the right motherboard all bets are off and it may not even boot. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
