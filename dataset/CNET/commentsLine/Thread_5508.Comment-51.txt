i also have a wd external hard drive that has disappeared from windows at times.
i have been burned in the past by not having adequate backups.
now i store my critical information on more than one pc, and on external hard drives, flash drives and dvd's (you never can be too careful).
all that aside i haven't seen the solution that worked for me.
my drive worked on my vista desktop for an extended period of time and then suddenly did not show up in &quot;my computer&quot; or showed up and said it was not formatted.
my fist thought was to try it on other pc's.
the drive worked ok on my laptop and my old xp desktop.
that's when i noticed that it would show up without a drive letter assigned on the &quot;problem&quot; desktop.
i went into &quot;control panel&quot; (in classic view) then into &quot;administrative tools&quot; next in to &quot;computer management&quot;.
once in &quot;computer management&quot; (there may be an easier way to get there!)
under the &quot;storage&quot; section click on &quot;disk management&quot;.
once in disk management you should see all drives attached with drive letters (such as your c: drive) if you see what looks like a fairly large drive with no letter assigned it could be your wd drive.
right clicking an the unassigned drive will give you an option to click - &quot;change drive letter and paths...&quot; this option will allow you to assign a letter to the drive (f,g or h - whatever letter is available or the one it used to be).
once the drive letter is assigned - presto!
the drive works normally again!!!
of course your drive could be corrupted (i thought mine was).
i hope that this helps someone.
i am sure i cant be the only person this has happend to.
