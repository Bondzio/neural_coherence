sorry, thanks for the attempt to help.
but - qt &quot;7&quot; is installed in the utilities folder &quot;under&quot; snow leopard.
i have been using qt pro - (that extra cost feature carries forward so that registered ,paid, users can continue to use qt pro for basic movie editing) - since i upgraded to 10.6 about 6 months ago.
unless what you say is a more recent development, users should still be able to use qt 7 - pro for basic editing.
apple did this split-off because they have a large number of customers who paid for the qt 7 pro app and need it for actual movie editing tasks (which are not available in imovie, for example).
it gets a little complicated because imovie has a different way of doing the voice overs and it (to my knowledge) cannot join short clips into a single larger clip.
so - if you have specific information about using imovie (or any mac app) for these tasks, i'd appreciate knowing about it.
