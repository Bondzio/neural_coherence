buying a new pc, will i regret the integrated graphics card later?
it's been a long time since i've bought a new pc and i'm ready to take the plunge for a new one.
however, my concern is that the hp windows 7 system from costco that i have in mind has an integrated video card with 256mb shared memory, but i'm not too sure what that exactly means.
are there ones that are not integrated?
it seems like 256mb size for a graphic card is pretty hefty, but will it be enough to handle some of the newer games, especially the ones that are more graphic intensive.
i'm not an avid gamer, but i would like to have the option to play those games when the opportunity arises.
if i find that the graphic card isn't up to snuff, can i upgrade or add more memory to the 256mb graphic card?
or would i be stuck having this system that will never play those graphic intensive games.
i would go for a more expensive system, but i'm currently on a very limited budget and that hp system seems like the way to go, but i don't want to regret buying it.
please help, any advice is appreciated.
