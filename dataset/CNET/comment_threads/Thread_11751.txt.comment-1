Purchased an identical hdd for my Toshiba 6100 laptop.
With an IDE cable adapter I will install it into my desktop as a slave.
With the use of Norton ghost or other mirror software I hope to mirror and back up daily my laptop hdd onto the desktop slave hdd over my network.
The reason for identical drives is so I can swap it into my laptop in the`event the current hdd craps out (calling this toshiba hdd crap is being kind, I am on my third unit in two years!)
My main concern is will I be able to boot from it like nothing even happen.
I dont want to deal with recoveries or reload my OS I just want to plug it in and go.
I spoke with the Norton people but I get the feeling there not sure.
Thanks!
