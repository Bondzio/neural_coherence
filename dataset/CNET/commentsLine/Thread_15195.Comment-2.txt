you don't state what you are running now or what you would like the upgraded system to be able to handle.
for example, do you play a lot of games, do photo editing, or just want a basic system for surfing the net and home office uses?
if you upgrade the motherboard, cpu, case, ram and power supply, how is that not a new system or darn near it?
for example, you could look on extremetech's $800 build it yourself gaming system and then pick which parts to upgrade to fit your budget and wants.
