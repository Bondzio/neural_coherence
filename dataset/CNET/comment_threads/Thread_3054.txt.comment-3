Your sales person was telling you the charging proceedure for batteries such as NiCads that have memory effects.
That is if charged from say a three quarters charged state, then the battery will only discharge to the threequarters level.
Lithium Ions are claimed to have no memory characteristics so, at least in theory, you shouldn't have to worry about when to charge.
However most of the laptop manuals I've read still suggest running your battery right down before recharging.
I don't know if this is a hangover from previous practice but if you want to play on the safe side, Follow the old practice.
