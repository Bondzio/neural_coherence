Heyyy so I'm wanting to play the Sims 3 on my laptop and all of my specs match up, just my memory card says it has 64 MB of dedicated memory when I need a minimum of 124 MB, but I know I have 1071 MB of total available graphics memory. I heard you can change your dedicated memory through BIOS, but I honestly have no idea how to do so or if it's safe for someone like me (basically technology UN-savvy) to do so. If you could tell me if it's kinda foolproof or if it's easy or anything, that would be amazing. Thank you so much in advance. Laptop specs (in case you want 'em) Operating System: Windows Vista Home Premium (6.0, Build 6001) Service Pack 1 System Manufacturer: Hewlett-Packard System Model: HP Pavilion dv6700 Notebook PC Processor: AMD Turion(tm) 64 X2 Mobile Technology TL-60 (2 CPUs), ~2.0GHz Memory: 3006MB RAM DirectX Version: DirectX 10 DxDiag Version: 6.00.6001.18000 32bit Unicode Harddrive free space: 117 GB Card name: NVIDIA GeForce 7150M / nForce 630M Manufacturer: NVIDIA Chip type: GeForce 7150M / nForce 630M DAC type: Integrated RAMDAC Display Memory: 1065 MB Dedicated Memory: 57 MB Shared Memory: 1007 MB Current Mode: 1280 x 800 (32 bit) (60Hz) driver Version: 7.15.0011.7713 (English) DDI Version: 10

Its a shame the makers don't have articles about how this works. But Nvidia and ATI do but who reads those? Bob

The Sims will most definitely run smoothly on your system. If it doesn't, try bumping the graphics settings down within the game just a tad. Good luck!
