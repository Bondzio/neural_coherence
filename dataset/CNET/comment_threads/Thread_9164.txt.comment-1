Hello, We have a internal network with 4 pc's connected to our university network.
We are going to do a lot of video and we need a lot of bandwith, we want to make our 4 pc network use 1Gig ethernet to share video files faster but want to avoid having to go outside our network and use the university resources.
Can regular switches recognise the 4 pc network and avoid going outside and send it straight between those pc and only going outside to surf the internet or whatever???
These must be done usually with a programmable switch but someone told me nowdays regular switches are able to do this.
Is it true?
How can it be done?
If it is, but basic models could I get?
If not what programmable switch which is cheap could I get?
By the way we'll be using (an can only use) windows XP, no Linux...;-( Thanks
