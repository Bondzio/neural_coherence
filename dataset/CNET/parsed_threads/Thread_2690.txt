<s> My old graphics card is broke, (geforce 4 Ti 4200), and i got half life 2 for christmas, do you think this graphics card can handle it and is it worth the money? </s>
<s> It's a good card, but in todays market most of the video cards are good. </s>
<s> What it comes down to is how much $$$ you have to spend. </s>
<s> I never buy the lastest greatest but wait for price to comes down then buy a &quot;newer&quot; video card. </s>
<s> So now you can get that card for a good price. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> Most video card reviews show that card or its close cousin(series) as very good. </s>
<s> Your new game will certainly be better for it. </s>
<s> Is it worth the money, well I never spent that much for a video card as I'm a &quot;trailing edge&quot; sorta user not a bleeding edge and wait for costs to be more reasonable. </s>
<s> You can check the http://www.tomsharware.com for a review and/or check pricelists for comments made by buyers. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
