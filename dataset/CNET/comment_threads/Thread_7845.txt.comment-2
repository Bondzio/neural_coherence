And after a few tapes I declared &quot;This is nuts!&quot; I went and bought a simple 55 buck DVD recorder, connected it to my VCR, popped in the blank DVD+R, a tape, pressed play then record on the respective boxes and came back in 2 hours to retrieve the finished DVD.
Feel free to repeat the lesson I learned.
