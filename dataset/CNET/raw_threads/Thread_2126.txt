If you find a card then post a link about it in the forum and maybe some member will look it up, hunt it down or comment they own it and put a Watt meter on it. For example I used some PCI Nvidia 9500 512MB video card and in the machine with the Watt meter it tops out at 120 Watts. The PSU is 350 Watts so at less than half the PSU's rating I don't fret about it. Bob

Are there any draw backs to raising the psu in a system? Would the extra bucks really get me a bigger bang?

But those hp power supplies are weak. Try tidying up the wiring when your in there. HP just crams the wires in, not caring about good airflow inside. Hope this helps Ps You could go to the 9800 gt but I`m not sure of the fit. But with my 8800gtx card I was playing crysis and call of duty no problem.
