I just ordered this to use with Time Machine on my iMac as a back up drive.
I just read on the web it will not work as a back of drive.
Can someone please tell me if this is correct or incorrect?
I ordered the Neil Polton drive and it is scheduled to arrive in a couple of days.
I really hope the info I just read on the web was wrong.
Can someone please let me know if this will work as a back up drive using Time Machine or the included software with my iMac.
