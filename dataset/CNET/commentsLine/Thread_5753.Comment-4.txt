i mentioned maxtor and others are doing a method, but not that.
until then d-i-y solutions are what you can try.
no standards here.
i'm unsure of your skill or how long you've used a pc, but if you used winzip and an passworded zip file you could drop files on that.
remember it's not ultra secure if you pay for unlocking via  if you could write how far out you need to go, and if you are willing to lose the data if the key (soft or hard) is lost, then i'll get an idea where the security bar height needs to be set.
