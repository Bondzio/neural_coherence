Would that be money well spent or is the performance difference not that great? Are there other considerations in making the choice in these chip types? Thanks.

So from this thread's replies, I thought I would get the Core 2 Duo. However, regarding the graphics card, I thought I would downgrade what is being offered on this built-up computer. The original offer gives a G-Force 512 Mb PC-X card. However, the shop guy said I could probably do without that and just use the on-board graphics from the Mboard, a &quot;Gigabyte&quot; GA-G31M-S2C. I would save $60. What do you think? The thing is I don't play complex games on my computers. Thanx.
