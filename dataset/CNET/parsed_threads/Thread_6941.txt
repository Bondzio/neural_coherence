<s> About two months ago I ago took my first stab at wiring an existing cat-5e line in our house. </s>
<s> The line was already present, but I had to strip the cable, put on the connectors, crimp it and put on a terminating RJ-45 jack. </s>
<s> After some trials and tribulations I finally got it working...at least I thought so. </s>
<s> I have been able to connect my laptop and some other devices successful to this new line. </s>
<s> My laptop is able to register with my router, get an IP address and connect to the internet and LAN. </s>
<s> I recently got an XBOX360 for Christmas and set it up on my network on a different line with no problem. </s>
<s> The XBOX was able to register and IP address, connect to internet (XBOX Live). </s>
<s> Then I moved the XBOX to the line I created and the network status showed &quot;DISCONNECTED&quot;. </s>
<s> I tried restarting the router and several other things (other router ports, different cables..) I am able to connect the XBOX on other physical lines, but not this one. </s>
<s> This makes me believe the connectors I put in our bad, but why would some devices not work? </s>
<s> Devices that have worked: 2 Dell laptops, 6. </s>
<s> I can't recall how many times I've rewired connections because of incorrect pairing. </s>
<s> Widely documented but as a test, tell me what pairs to what pins you used. </s>
<s> Also, I test these setups for bad wiring by running my 100' cable from here to there. </s>
<s> If that works I know it's the wiring. </s>

<s> Bob, Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I didn't think it could be incorrect pairing because I was so meticulous about that. </s>
<s> I did the research on the EIA/TIA-568-A/B standard and followed what my home wiring contractors did (presumably EIA/TIA-568-A). </s>
<s> However, it appears the contractors may have created their own standard. </s>
<s> Here is what I used following the existing connectors: pin1: green/white pin2: green pin3: blue/white pin4: blue pin5: orange/white pin6: orange pin7: brown/white pin8: brown It appears pins 3 and 5 are reversed from the EIA/TIA-568-A standard. </s>
<s> I'll make a new connector and see what happens. </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestion. </s>
<s> The problem is while it's electrically correct the incorrect pairs result in odd issues such as slow downloads, fast uploads and the issues you noted. </s>
<s> Once the wiring is sorted, there are issues with XP and limited connectivity but with the wiring issue let's sort the hardware issue first. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I switched the pair and it's working now. </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestion! </s>
