<s> My sister got a used Apple 1705 monitor but no cable. </s>
<s> Upon checking, it does have a DB15 connection on the back. </s>
<s> The original cable(googled) says, it would work provided you use the &quot;adapter&quot; that came with it for PCs. </s>
<s> No cable and no adapter. </s>
<s> Now, investigating further suggests it will work with a DB15(male) to DB15(male) cable to a VGA card. </s>
<s> But, it seems there maybe a scanning issue. </s>
<s> If this is the case, will it work at all using a std. </s>
<s> VGA(PC) cable from monitor to video card. </s>
<s> No need getting a cable if it won't sync as googling provides, but others says it will work. </s>
<s> I want to believe a newer PC type video card will be able to sync but hate to waste $ for a new monitor cable. </s>
<s> I just wonder if anyone has gone through this? </s>
<s> Otherwise, it be recycled via the Goodwill. </s>
<s> Yeah, they do recycle, not resell. </s>
<s> TIA -----Willy </s>
<s> As you have noticed, the connector on the 1705 is not a standard VGA connector so the VGA to VGA idea will not work. </s>
<s> That connector is actually a DA-15 but is often referred to as DB-15. </s>
<s> The Apple monitor cable is wider than VGA and will need an adapter to bring it down in size. </s>
<s> There is an adapter, See it here that will work for you but you will need to buy an Apple monitor cable to connect the monitor to the cable. </s>
<s> Hope this helps P </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I already seen the adapter side of things. </s>
<s> Basically, they offer use with an Apple cable, since I have no cable its another expense. </s>
<s> The costs are getting to be heavy and thus won't go that route. </s>
<s> I can buy a working PC monitor for the costs of all the cable(s)/adapters, Again, thanks -----Willy </s>
