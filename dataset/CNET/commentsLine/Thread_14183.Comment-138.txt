well, as my earlier post indicated my 1st pc was in 1988 so i'm a relative latecomer compared to others on this forum.
(my life partner did have a kaypro years before and my first love in college programmed in fortran at a student job on campus so i claim a certain vintage heritage vicariously.
as for vintage audio equipment and changing media affecting museums' and archive's ability to preserve valuable recordings: it is an issue that has been barely addressed in the mainstream media but is a serious issue.
i'm doing my small part by hanging on to my old columbia gramophone from the 1930's which i purchased in 1973 in the flea market in athens, greece (had it shipped around the horn), reel-to-reel, sony and radio shack cassette decks and a walkman, portable and audiophile adcom cd player, my beloved sony 1970's vintage turntable with strobe for manually adjusting the speed), my 1950's vintage kiddie 45rpm player and my 1960's kid 45rpm and 33 1/3 rpm players, a dictation cassette deck, probably some microphones somewhere for the cassete decks, and a collection of recordings - vintage 45s, 33 1/3s (mono and stereo), and a cylinder for an edison cylinder player (although i don't have one of those...yet).
rapid planned obsolecence of computers and computer media seems to be an even worse problem than what has happened in audio.
