that's why most companies have a sales department or a customer relations department in front of the it/tech department.
so that they can take requirements from those who don't know the lingo (like me) and relay it to those who do.
i think throughout both of my posts, i did a great job explaining what i was trying to accomplish from a non-technical point of view.
if i knew all the terminology, i'd most likely know how to do this, which means i wouldn't be on this forum.
thanks again bob for taking the time to respond... i'll keep on searching
