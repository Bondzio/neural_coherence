and it looks like that, software won't help.
Only an (expensive) data-recovery company can get your data off then.
Did nobody ever tell you that you shouldn't store data on an external hard disk?
It's useful to transport data between different PC's that aren't in a network, and it's useful as a quick backup.
But surely not as primary and only storage of data.
Much too unreliable for that.
