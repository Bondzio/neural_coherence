This has happened on my Desktop a few times I did a OS reload it worked for a while but did not fix the Core issue the core issue for me is my hard drive is bad.
Corruption basically is what is happening windows can not find files so it restarts and trys again.
Boot into repair mode F8 and try to skdisk or try SPINRITE.
See if you can salvage the HD but eventually you will probably need to buy a new one.
That is only one cause for the symptom but the most likely one.
