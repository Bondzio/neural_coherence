<s> The other day I took out my card to put on some thermal gel (I had been having heat problems) and when I put the card back in, hooked it up, and turned the computer on, it booted up to the desktop, and then shut off. </s>
<s> I made sure I hooked everything back up correctly, and tried again, and it came on for about half a second, and shut off again. </s>
<s> I unhooked the cable going to the card (left it in the slot though) and turned it on, and had no problems. </s>
<s> I turned the computer back off, hooked the card back up, and again it came on for no longer than half a second and shut off again. </s>
<s> Thinking the PSU was my problem, I bought a new one, which I got today, hooked it all up with the same result. </s>
<s> So, what could be my problem? </s>
<s> Is the video card shot? </s>
<s> System: Athlon 64 3400+ Geforce 6600 GT XG Vigor 500 watt PSU Thanks </s>
<s> Where did you put this???? </s>
<s> On what part of the card?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I don't think the compound was done correctly. </s>
<s> You must first take all the old stuff off and then apply the new. </s>
<s> Try again. </s>
<s> But you'd better get it right quick or you'll fry the processor -&gt; motherboard -&gt;....get the picture? </s>
<s> BTW..Compound (if done correctly) should last for a few years. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> hello, I have the same problems. </s>
<s> I hooked up the new gc, hade to connect a powercable to it first though, used the one connected to the harddrive on the second plug. </s>
<s> Pc started but never saw any picture. </s>
<s> Disconnected the cabel and pc started no probs. </s>
<s> Now I get this warning messgae that my gc has no power to use all its functions properly....what power suppply do i need? </s>
<s> Amd 2,Ghz 3000+ XFX GeForce 6600GT don't know my power supply ratings, how can i check that? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Look on the power supply there should be a sticker on the side. </s>
<s> If it's 300-350watt you may need a new one. </s>
<s> These new cards are power hogs... Also there is a new power spec called ATX 2.0 The new motherboards & some video cards need this, so look out! </s>
<s> ohhhh mine only says 200w, can I just get a new one with more power? </s>
<s> i mean like are they all the same, as in connecting them to the motherboards, eg unversial...sorry im computer illiterate..thanks </s>
<s> I did it correctly, took off the old compound before applying the new. </s>
<s> I am sending the card back to the manufacturer (sp?) </s>
<s> in the morning, and if that doesn't work I will find someone that knows what they are doing better than me. </s>
<s> lol </s>

<s> went to the pc store today, purchased a 500w psu, and all is working a treat. </s>
