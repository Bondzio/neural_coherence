1.1.1	Hi , I have visited many forums and see this issue but no answers/fixxes .	St
1.1.2	The problem is when the monitor tried to display older games or visuals that dont meet the native resolution .	St
1.1.3	The monitor decides to go into a safe mode with a box pop up saying & quot ; Not Optimized Mode & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	There has to be a way around this .	St
1.1.5	From what i have read people are bashing samsung for this on UTube and other forums .	St
1.1.6	I have a samsung TV and 2 Pc Monitors and love them all .	St
1.1.7	Please help me fix this problem and make the fix public so the bashing may be stopped .	Sug
1.1.8	The game i am trying to play is Warcraft 3 Frozen Throne , but im positive it has nothing to do with the game as there are many posts of other games doing the same thing .	St
1.1.9	It seems to be any older game that dosent utalize the higher resolutions that the monitor is trying to force .	St
1.1.10	Samsung SyncMaster 2233 , Radeon Hd 4870 1Gb , 4 Gig Ram , Drivers all up to date .	St
1.2.1	Try the OVERRIDE setting in DXDIAG .	St
1.2.2	Put it at 60 .	St
1.2.3	Given the lack of details and you may want to bash I 'll share a fix I used .	St
1.2.4	Good luck , Bob	Polite
1.3.1	I have windows vista , dont see an override option available in the dxdiag tool .	St
1.3.2	it is set at 60 hertz though .	St
1.3.3	i even tried forcing the 60 hertz function in ati catalist control center , no luck .	St
1.3.4	when i open the game , it still tries to run at 75 hertz and says not optimum setting and goes into standby mode .	St
1.4.1	Almost all LCDs require 60Hz .	St
1.4.2	Some call that a flaw .	St
1.4.3	Ask ATI how to keep the card at 60Hz .	St
1.5.1	Above i stated the game was trying to run @ 75 hertz , this was wrong .	St
1.5.2	Think im reading to many forums and getting burned out .	St
1.5.3	It says ( & quot ; Not Optimum Mode , Recommended Mode : 1920 X 1080 @ 60 hertz ) .	St
1.5.4	The games highest setting is 1280 X 1024 .	St
1.5.5	This is where the problem is i think .	St
1.5.6	The monitor wants the game run @ 1920 X 1080 , which it can not do .	St
1.5.7	I have posted to Samsung support but have received no reply as of yet .	St
1.6.1	But give errors when the refresh rate is wrong .	St
1.6.2	The good thing we did here was to move connections to HDMI .	St
1.6.3	Do you use HDMI ?	Ques
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	I went through all the diff rez settings and the game was happy with 1280X960X32 @ 60 hertz .	St
1.7.2	So i guess the fix is to play with the rez settings till you find something the monitor is happy with .	St
1.7.3	OK works for me , i will try to spread the word .	St
1.7.4	TyVm for the help .	St
1.8.1	& quot ; 1680 x 1050 resolutions , & quot ; I wonder if ATI 's 1280x1024 is not exactly kosher .	St
1.8.2	To recap .	St
1.8.3	Must be 60Hz for all settings and watch out on the second number .	St
1.8.4	- & gt ; All this vanished as an issue over HDMI or even DVI to HDMI connections .	St
1.8.5	Ever since I changed that my kid has yet to ask me to set the resolutions .	St
1.8.6	Bob	St
1.9.1	I was having this problem , setting the resolution to 1920x1080 60 hertz , and I just found the solution .	St
1.9.2	You have to ( on the monitor itself ) hit the MENU button , and scroll down to the second from the bottom .	St
1.9.3	Hit SOURCE to select it , the hit the down button until the options become AV mode and HDMI Black Level .	St
1.9.4	Go to AV mode and hit Source to select it .	St
1.9.5	Now press up or down to change the setting to OFF .	St
1.9.6	Exit the menu .	St
1.9.7	As long as AV mode is off , the monitor will display perfectly .	St
1.9.8	If the color looks strange , change HDMI Black Level to Normal instead of the default LOW as well .	St
