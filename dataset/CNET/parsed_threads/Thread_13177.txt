<s> i wanted to know if its possible to take a hard drive from one computer and place on another and still retain all the information on it </s>
<s> In short, the answer is yes. </s>
<s> But the longer answer would need to ask just what you planning for the move. </s>
<s> If you expect everything to work as it did in the old computer, then no. </s>
<s> The information will still be there but the OS will not accept the move as if it did not happen. </s>
<s> So, just what do you expect and why? </s>
<s> just one more question: what are OS you are trying to transfer data from/to? </s>
<s> Your data will still be there but the drive will probably not boot. </s>
<s> You will not be able to say &quot;Oops&quot; and put it back in the old machine and have it work as before. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> I don't know how XP does it but it puts something on that drive to mark the installation as illegal. </s>
<s> You get to sort that out with Microsoft to get it working again. </s>
<s> what i want to recover is some pictures and songs...but most importantly some pictures i took on a vacation and i didnt back them up on a cd. </s>
