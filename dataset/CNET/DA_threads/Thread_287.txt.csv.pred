1.1.1	I 'm trying not to get my hopes up , but I bet that my MBP will come back with something wrong .	St
1.1.2	If Apple moves to replaced it like they had suggested to me ( I hope ) , I would probably get a Santa Rosa machine .	St
1.1.3	I doubt that they could get me the exact same one I had , since the 2.16Ghz models are no longer produced .	St
1.1.4	Their store site does not list any refurbished ones either , thought that does n't mean anything ...	St
1.1.5	I would n't want a refurb though .	St
1.1.6	The Mac is still relatively new ...	St
1.1.7	I 'm wondering if they would swap it with the low end 2.2Ghz model , which really is n't too different , or if they would let me go for the 2.4Ghz model .	St
1.1.8	The low end one has half of the graphics memory , a somewhat slower clock speed , and would n't give me any performance boosts that I could actually see .	St
1.1.9	Coming from a 2.16Ghz model , would a 2.4Ghz ( or a 2.6 ? )	Ques
1.1.10	show any increased performance ?	Ques
1.1.11	I mean , I 'd have a new Nvidia card with double the memory that was on my ATI card , and I 'd have a boost of at least 240Mhz .	St
1.1.12	Plus , the battery life is supposed to be very good with those LED displays .	St
1.1.13	I hope they let me get a good one that works so I do n't have to deal with any more problems ...	St
1.1.14	I 've already lost a great deal of time because of all this .	St
1.1.15	Not to mention I broke a router in the process and had to get another one ...	St
1.1.16	I 'll be happy with at least 2.4Ghz and a 250GB HD .	St
1.1.17	2GB of RAM is fine for me .	St
1.1.18	Even though the 2.2Ghz model replaced mine , I really could use a little extra power .	St
1.1.19	The 2.4Ghz model seems to represent the Santa Rosa line anyway , does it not ?	Ques
1.2.1	They 'll be doing your work and as we all know they tend to grease the squeaky wheels .	St
1.3.1	are n't always customer friendly .	St
1.3.2	I asked one Genius a similar question one time .	St
1.3.3	He gave me what seemed to be a dirty look and said that would never happen .	St
1.3.4	At least this time they acknowledged that it would be replaced if it is n't fixed this time .	St
1.3.5	They 're shipping it to the depot , so they wo n't see the repairs until it comes back .	St
1.3.6	I hope it comes back before next Friday ... Thing is , I 'm trying not to push my luck here .	St
1.3.7	I was assured that it would be completely fixed when it comes back , and I intend to hold them to that promise , though a new Mac would be kind of nice .	St
1.3.8	They have to look at the AirPort card , the Ethernet hardware , and I hope they look at the board again ... Plus , the casing is still messed up and the antennae that runs through the top of the laptop may have had issues too .	St
1.3.9	A little more than greasing I 'm afraid .	St
1.4.1	A non qualified person opened it up .	St
1.4.2	I 've seen botch jobs but not from the depot .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	This one is interesting , though I 'm pretty sure that his situation was far worse than mine .	St
1.5.2	Here 's the story : http : //mybiggestcomplaint.com/apple-refusing-to-fix-my-macbook-pro/99/ and the other half : http : //notquiteleet.com/2007/08/06/update-my-bent-macbook-pro-resolved/ That guy 's Mac saw its fair share of botched jobs .	St
1.5.3	My Mac has come back twice now without being fully repaired , but it has n't gotten too bad yet .	St
1.5.4	I mean the first two times , I explained to them all of my issues and I told them what I wanted fixed .	St
1.5.5	So far they 've done a bang up job ...	St
1.5.6	I really hope that they just swap it out when it returns , supposing it does n't work right , because that guy 's escapade does n't sound too good .	St
1.5.7	Thankfully , the two Geniuses that helped me out sounded like they got most of it down , but ...	St
1.5.8	I read the sheet with the scheduled repairs on it and I do n't think they got them all down like they said .	St
1.5.9	I typed up every single thing I could find and had problems with just for them , but I suppose three pages of problems and complaints is too much for them .	St
1.5.10	They said they got them all , but I would disagree if that paper is correct .	St
1.5.11	That 's what happened the first time ... the guy did n't write one of the things down .	St
1.5.12	I noticed that before I left and asked him about it .	St
1.5.13	Said they had it and would check it out .	St
1.5.14	But they did n't .	St
1.5.15	Here it is happening again ... Well , I look forward to my Santa Rosa machine , if I end up getting one .	St
1.5.16	My initial question remains : do the new Santa Rosa machines have any substantial advantages over their predecessors ?	Ques
1.5.17	I guess I 'll find out , but I 'd like to know ahead of time .	St
1.5.18	-BMF	St
1.6.1	three pages of whatever & quot ; is & quot ; too much for them ...	St
1.6.2	I miss my Mac now , with all of its nifty editing features .	St
1.6.3	At least FireFox has spell check .	St
