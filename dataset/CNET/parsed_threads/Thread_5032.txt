<s> My existing HP 7150 printer doesn't show up in the printers folder in the control panel.I've tried reinstalling to no avail.I was successful in installing on a second computer with no problem.It says my rpc server can't be contacted.What is an rpc server and what is my solution? </s>
<s> &quot;Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; No mention of the OS, but your mention of RPC gives a clue your machine may have become infected with one of the MS Blaster, Nachi or other worms. </s>
<s> Before you think &quot;Oh, that can't happen because I run an Antivirus, be aware that these worms are not stopped by today's antivirus programs.&quot; Such worms can cause a posting like yours. </s>
<s> Here's an article about MS-Blaster and it's removal. </s>
<s> But before I give you this URL, be aware that there are VARIENTS such as Nachi and others and this article may not apply. </s>
