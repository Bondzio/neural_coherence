If not, call your ISP for procedure It's actually not a good idea to mute the modem. You could have a dialer placed on your machine & a hacker could make phone calls from it. This happened to me years ago when I got my phone bill with calls from USA to Africa & England. A Virus scan found a dialer! If you can alway's hear your modem, this won't happen.
