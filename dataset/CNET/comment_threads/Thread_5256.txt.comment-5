I recommend that you do not buy Seagate (Maxtor).
I bought a 500 gb and now that I want to buy a new computer I have found out that it will not work with VIsta 64 bit.
Nothing on box says this.
Says it is compatible with Vista.
THey should of said Vista 32 but they did not.
No plans for new drivers either.
Just be sure that whatever brand you buy it specifies Vista 64 bit as this is the os that will soon be the norm and 32 bit will be out.
