<s> Guys, I seem to have a quandary on my hands. </s>
<s> I have bought a new dell computer w/out a wireless card, and am confused as if i should by an external wireless adapter or an internal one. </s>
<s> I have asked several people and they seem to have different opinions on what is better (best buy rep, computer store rep, cable guy). </s>
<s> What is your guys opinoin? </s>
<s> And based on what you guys say, where are some places where i can get a good price on one...or is it just the basics...Best Buy, CompUSA etc. </s>
<s> Id appreciate an answer, thanks. </s>
<s> I bought a D-Link PCI (internal) because I had the room inside the computer and I don't like having things permanantly hanging off the sides of the case. </s>
<s> I also still have all my USB ports free. </s>
<s> I followed the directions exactly (install drivers from CD before inserting card) and it has worked flawlessly ever since. </s>
<s> $30 after rebate at Officemax, and they did send me my check. </s>
<s> Good Luck, Eric </s>
<s> Put it on the inside, leave the outside clean. </s>
