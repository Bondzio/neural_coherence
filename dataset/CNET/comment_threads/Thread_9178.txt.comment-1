My Linksys 54gs is about 5 years old now and lately it has been shuting off during the night while Im downloading files.
I have already put an updated firmware on it and doesnt seem to help.
I do alot of gaming on XBOX LIVE (wired) and was thinking if there was a better router out there.
Thanx for the input
