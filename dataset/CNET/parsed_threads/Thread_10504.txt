<s> Hello All, I've been using this dvd writer for the past year and had no problems. </s>
<s> Recently I've written 3 dvd's and weirdly enough it doesn't playback on the dvd writer itself but plays in any other player or dvdrom, so you could say data verification in nero is always a failure. </s>
<s> Any solution how I can play the dvd on the dvd writer, or is there any other problem? </s>
<s> These drives have plummeted to 20 bucks at newegg and only last a year or 2. </s>
<s> -&gt; Save yourself! </s>
<s> Swap the drive out and carry on. </s>

<s> are they dvds from a stack youve used before, or a new stack? </s>
<s> if so , maybe you should check your drive to see what kind of dvds it can run/burn </s>
