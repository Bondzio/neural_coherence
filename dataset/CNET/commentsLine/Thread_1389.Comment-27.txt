recently i had a similar problem with a celeron 500mhz pc.
it was taking over 3 minutes to boot and even then it was so slow it was almost unusable, and the 2g disk was nearly full.
but it so happened i had a spare 60g disk from a much newer pc, and noting the old fashioned 40-way ribbon on the old drive, i decided to install an ide interface card and hooked up the 60g with an 80-way cable.
wow, what a difference!
less than 2 minutes to boot and copying files is 3 times faster than before.
plus i have lots of space free.
i also found a very useful program on the maxtor website which can set up a new drive and transfer everything over from the old drive and make it boot.
it seems to work with non-maxtor drives too.
maxblast 4 :  after than i decided to go one step further - my motherboard manual indicated that the pc would take a pentium 3 to replace the celeron.
now, i have to say that some research is required here as not all pentiums work on all boards - but in the end i bought a secondhand p3 600mhz for $10 via ebay.
this upgrade got me another significant speed increase - hard to define but windows &quot;feels&quot; faster.
i would definitely recommend a hard disk upgrade - plus an ide card if your current pc can't cope with the 80 way udma cable.
as mentioned in some of the other posts, keep the size down to avoid bios troubles.
