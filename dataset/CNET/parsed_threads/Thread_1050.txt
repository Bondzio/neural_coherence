<s> Hey all I need some help. </s>
<s> at work we are trying to put 2 computers in the same room, the room has only one port, and since we are renting our space from a larger company they don't want us putting a router or anything else up that would hide a PC behind its own IP. </s>
<s> So I was thinking of maybe a switch or hub? </s>
<s> Are they the same? </s>
<s> And do they create there own IP? </s>
<s> Thanks Lee </s>
<s> You need another ethernet card on one box. </s>
<s> Set it up as a sever for LAN and the second box as a client. </s>
<s> If it's like most places, that's all you need. </s>
