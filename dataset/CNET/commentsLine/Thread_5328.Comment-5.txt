&gt;&gt;&gt;why update the driver if the old one works ok?.
usually to help boost performance some, and so forth.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there should be no different drivers needed just because of a firmware update.
i agree that is what so surprising.
also i have another (older) dvd burner that works just fine, no driver problems.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;now it's back to the maker's site to find a driver that supports the new firmware.
the site doesnt have any drivers for its cd/dvd drives.
as far as i have seen, they want us to use the windows xp driver.
i dont know if i have some newer driver that windows thinks it should install or what?
i cant find the right *.inf file to get this to install properly.
