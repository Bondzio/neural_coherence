<s> hi, was running XP in Italian OS, and it has been reinstalled on my system when I wasn't there in English. </s>
<s> Not a problem. </s>
<s> however after the reinstall , my network card comes up as 1394 net adapter, and in the network settings this is the only connection available. </s>
<s> I cannot connect to the Internet, I am pretty certain that the card identified is not the correct one, but, there is no other card visible, and no way of repairing it, or installing something else. </s>
