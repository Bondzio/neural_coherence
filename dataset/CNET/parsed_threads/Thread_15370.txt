<s> I am comparing firewalls. </s>
<s> We currently use smoothwall but I am not that impressed with it. </s>

<s> If I implement another smoothwall then I have to buy a new machine for it by which time I may as well just buy an appliance. </s>
<s> I wouldn't mind seeing the back of smoothwall, but if I am to consider another solution it must interoperate with smoothwall in order keep vpns between sites etc... </s>
