i am sympathetic, believe me, and it is admirable to be frugal, as you clearly are.
i have a g3 powerbook without an airport card, myself, and have given some thought to getting the right card for my little workhorse, though it has (unfortunately) more pressing demands, at present--if i read things correctly, beginning with a new battery.
leaving frugality aside, though, you seem already to have some kind of network arrangement (did i read you right?
), and the airport card would allow you to use hot spots all over, so unless there is another, much cheaper solution, why not go for the card?
for that $60 (lucky you--i've seen the same cards offered only for more than $100) you'd be getting a lot more utility and enjoyment out of your computer.
my two cents and no disrespect.
