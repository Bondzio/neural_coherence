i just restarted my computer with the monitor unplugged, plugged it back in after it was started, and now the second monitor works fine again.
but i feel like as soon as it falls asleep and i try to wake it up, it's going to not want to wake up again.
so it's not that it's not supported i think, since it does work, but it doesn't wake up after falling asleep.
i've seen other forum posts like this but there weren't answers to those either.
