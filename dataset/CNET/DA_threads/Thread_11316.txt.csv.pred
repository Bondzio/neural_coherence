1.1.1	I live in a large two story house with an upstairs office at one end of the house and a downstairs office at the opposite end .	St
1.1.2	The cable enters the house on the second floor and I have used a DI D-link connected to the cable modem to transmit a signal to the downstairs office for a second computer .	St
1.1.3	When I started frequent dropped signals downstairs I installed a Netgear in the wall plugs near the cable modem connecting to the downstairs .	St
1.1.4	That seemed to help but I later added a much longer aerial extender to the D-Link wireless router .	St
1.1.5	I have decided to get an up to date wireless router to see if I can stop the dropped connections .	St
1.1.6	I need advice on which one to buy for consistency of connection over a large area of the house .	St
1.1.7	RonBRea	St
1.2.1	It is unlikely you will see much difference .	St
1.2.2	Most routers transmit at the maximum legal power .	St
1.2.3	You have already tried the larger antenna trick which is pretty much the only option to manipulate the signal .	St
1.2.4	You & quot ; may ? & quot ; see better performance if you move all your equipment to N rather than G but its more because N is more tolerant of interference that G the transmit power is exactly the same .	St
1.2.5	If you already run N then the brand of router will not make a difference .	St
1.2.6	If you have not tried it you can move one of your antenna parallel to the ceiling/floor .	St
1.2.7	Router antenna are generally designed to transmit the signal horizontally and not up and down .	St
1.2.8	Maybe you get lucky but floors/ceiling eat a lot more signal than walls do .	St
1.2.9	If I read that you have used the Ethernet over powerline and place a second wireless AP on the end that is one of the more common solutions to this problem .	St
1.2.10	Wireless drops are a fact of life and you just have to live with them if you want to use wireless .	St
1.2.11	It all comes down to interference that you can do little about	St
1.3.1	Thanks bill012 I have not tried the pointing of the long antenna yet .	St
1.3.2	Another comment was to make sure that I did not have a & quot ; flakey & quot ; internet card in the receiving computer downstairs .	St
1.3.3	I will let you know what I finally do and if it makes any difference at all .	St
