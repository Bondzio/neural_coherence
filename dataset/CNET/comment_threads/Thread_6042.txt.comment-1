Ok, I have a tower and power supply with no mother board, that I am just putting a lot of hard drives in.
I want to use the 600 W power supply, but without the mother board, no way for the power button to turn it on.
I'm looking for directions on how to attach the power button in front to the 20 pin on the power supply to basically just do a direct turn on of the power supply.
Thanks, Brian
