first of all, thanks for taking the time to read this.
background: i have a linksys 802.11b wireless router from an earthlink dsl modem.
about a year ago, a bright young woman from compusa set-up a wireless network between my old gateway pii 350 desktop (win 98) and newer laptop (fujitsu e7010, win xp home).
everything was working wonderfully and then i bought a new laptop (compaq win xp).
i only wanted to access the internet at home and was not having any problems until i took the computer to frys (local electronics store).
i was sitting in the caf and tried to logon to the wireless network there i couldnt get internet access.
probably because there wasnt a free network there.
when i came home i keep getting the limited /no connectivity when trying to get on my own network.
when i attempt to repair the connection, i keep getting the error regarding unable to renew ip address.
the compaq will connect to the internet when i use the ethernet cable however.
i have recently switched to firefox, downloaded spybot, and installed norton antivirus, but i wasnt having any problems until coming home from frys.
ive tried: 1.
