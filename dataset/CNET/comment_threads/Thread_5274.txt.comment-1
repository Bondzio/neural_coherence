Can anyone tell me how much importance I should put on an HD Gateway monitor/computer package, versus a similar comparable Hewlett Packard computer package with a regular lcd monitor.
I would prefer to buy the HP computer package, but for the price, I'm wondering if it would be better to stare at Gateway's HD monitor?
The computer deals are about the same, at bestbuy, so I was probably just going to get the better deal.
So since the deals are also about the same, should I just go with the High Definition Gateway Monitor even though I prefer hp?
