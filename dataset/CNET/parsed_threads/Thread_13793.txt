<s> I have a Maxtor drive that I use to store embroidery designs that I use on a regular basis. </s>
<s> I have more than 100,000 designs on this drive. </s>
<s> I have a Dell inspiron-E1505 laptop that is about 8 years old. </s>
<s> I am running XP Pro Vers 2002 - Service Pack 3 - It has an Intel CPU T2400 @1.63GHz - 1.83Ghz @.00 GB RAM Every once in a while if my machine turned itself off with the hard drive attached when I got back on it would say that it could not finish writing to the device - the E drive $MFT file. </s>
<s> I would click on the drive and it would bring up the maxtor window asking for my password and it would unlock the drive. </s>
<s> Today it showed a different file quickly and then it closed another message popped up with the MFT file name. </s>
<s> When I tried to open the drive it said, there was an I/O error. </s>
<s> I tried logging off and then doing a shutdown but nothing has helped. </s>
<s> When I went into device manager it said that the drive was a CD drive instead of an external drive storage. </s>
<s> I tried to use the trouble shooting help system at the Seagate site but you can't do much if it thinks it is a CD Drive. </s>
<s> Any help is really appreciated. </s>
<s> Thx, jane </s>
<s> External drives do tend to corrupt like that. </s>
<s> I've had to boot up and chkdsk the drive or try a chkdsk on boot (not going to duplicate chkdsk discussions at this point. </s>
<s> If you haven't learned why USB drives are not reliable yet I'd be a little surprised. </s>
<s> It's time to get that drive internal so you don't have this issue. </s>
