1.1.1	I 've been using this drive on my vista machine for a while now , but apparently only to read .	St
1.1.2	I fire up a couple of burning programs and ca n't get them to see the drive .	St
1.1.3	So I look around , see that maybe I need to use Burnrights .	St
1.1.4	Nope , it ca n't see the drive .	St
1.1.5	So I read somewhere that I should flash the firmware .	St
1.1.6	So I download the firmware flasher ( Binflash and K34503CQ from dell ) .	St
1.1.7	No go , they ca n't see the drive either .	St
1.1.8	NECWinflash also says no supported devices .	St
1.1.9	Freakin vista .	St
1.1.10	Geez .	St
1.1.11	Drive shows up in Device Manager , but none of these programs can see it .	St
1.1.12	Anyone got any advice on how to proceed ?	Ques
1.2.1	That is running XP or an OS that will allow this to get done .	St
1.2.2	However if this is just busted why not make it a warranty issue ?	Ques
1.3.1	It was previously on a XP machine , worked fine for burning and reading .	St
1.3.2	Moved to Vista , works fine for reading .	St
1.3.3	Just ca n't get any burn program to recognize it .	St
1.3.4	It 's either a Vista problem or a firmware problem .	St
1.4.1	Get it updated by a friend .	St
1.4.2	The manufacturers wo n't be good on this since a new DVDRW is all of 30 or under bucks .	St
1.4.3	Good luck ,	Polite
1.5.1	reboot .	St
1.5.2	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	Just for the heck of it download a free trial of Nero to the system and try that , you have nothing to lose unless of course you have a buddy who has a Nero or Roxio disk you can load .	St
1.6.2	For Vista it would have to be a pretty current version of either .	St
1.6.3	But I would give it a shot , especially since it shows in device manager.Good luck !	St
