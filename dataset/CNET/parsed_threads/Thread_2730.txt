<s> Hi, i'm new here and i have a vista pc that i built myselft. </s>
<s> the mobo is a gigabyte ds3 the problem i have is the OS won't boot, from the hard disk or even from the vista dvd. </s>
<s> NOTHING SHOWS UP AFTER THE FIRST &quot;LOGO&quot; troubleshooting i have already done are: resetting CMOS, trying to boot from vista dvd to reinstall OS unplugging and replugging some stuff... what happens when i start is...i see the gigabyte logo, then it shows the normal boot screen and then nothing... i didn't touch my computer and it was fine the night before... thanks for reading, i really need your help...any troubleshoot tips are welcome, thanks </s>
<s> Does it stop at vista splash screen or the computer bios splash screen. </s>
<s> First you say that after the logo nothing shows up. </s>
<s> Then you say that after the logo you see the normal boot screen. </s>
<s> That's a contradiction. </s>
<s> If you can't make your problem clear, you won't get effective help. </s>
<s> By the way, what do you mean with 'normal boot screen'? </s>

<s> I am currently having the same problem. </s>
<s> I have a self-built pc with Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit edition. </s>
<s> Has been running for about 6 months with no problems, then out of the blue, when I start my computer, it will load my ASUS screen, then the Windows logo screen comes up, and it says &quot;please wait&quot; as it is loading, then the screen goes black and stays that way. </s>
<s> On this black screen, my cursor is still visible and I can move it around, but the screen is completely black. </s>
<s> I have tried many troubleshooting solutions, including: - system restore - trying a boot repair off of the Vista disc - unplugging/replugging USB components Any ideas? </s>
