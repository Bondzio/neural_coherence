I do not know much about his computer specs sorry.... but the @ does not work, and it comes up as &quot;. He purchased another wireless keyboard with mouse and it is still with the same problem. The OS is Windows Vista 64-bit with 250GB Hard-Drive, 4GB RAM. Is this a well known problem? I be so grateful if anyone who can sort this very annoying problem out for me....

In windows there is that keyboard or regional settings that re-map the keyboard to match the keyboard or region/language. Nothing sounds wrong here with the hardware. But a trip to the control panel and changing the keyboard would be what I do next. Bob
