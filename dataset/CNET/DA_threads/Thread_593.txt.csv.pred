1.1.3	Any thoughts ?	Ques
1.2.1	Dell direct replacement should get you going with the least amount of hassle .	St
1.2.2	Though , excluding any 2ndary issues or continuing problems , it will be the least intrusive and you can continue on as if nothing happened .	St
1.2.3	Any other action you take will require extra effort on your part if not a Dell mtrbd .	St
1.2.4	and you can ask questions on this topic later .	St
1.2.5	For now I see no reason not to continue using Dell , if that suits you .	St
1.2.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	from the BIG BOX MFGs are usually not inexpensive .	St
