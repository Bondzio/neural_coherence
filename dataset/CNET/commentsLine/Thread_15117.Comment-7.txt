thank you for very much for your assistance.
i have looked at the acer models and they are missing a few things that i need.
i haven't found one that has vga, bluetooth, and a large battery like this one.
small size doesn't really matter that much.
i just don't want it to be the size of the laptop.
i also like this one because it has the new atom processor.
i have a feeling i am going to need some heavy processing.
not really that heavy but the more power i can get the better.
