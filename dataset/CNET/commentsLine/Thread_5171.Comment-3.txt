thanks for all of your responses.
you are very helpful.
the symptom is that my system locks up within the first 1 - 5 minutes of booting up, then runs fine from then on.
(i have not turned off this pc since yesterday morning).
so as i look for bad components, what kind would exhibit the &quot;bad when cool - good when warm&quot; characteristic?
ps - i ran all the &quot;checker&quot; stuff you referred me to.
no problems detected.
