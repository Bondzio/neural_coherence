<s> Im looking to upgrade my computer with some more ram, but Im not exactly sure on what type of ram my system takes. </s>
<s> I know there was a website that could inspect your system and figure it out for you, does anybody have that link? </s>
<s> Download and install CPU-Z. </s>
<s> It does the trick for me: http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php </s>
<s> Enter your computer make & model into the memory finder at Crucial.com for compatibility information. </s>
<s> make, model/series, and model number. </s>
<s> Also you system (or motherboard) manual should have such information. </s>
<s> CPU-Z can also help you verify the system/motherboard info under the Mainboard Tab. </s>
