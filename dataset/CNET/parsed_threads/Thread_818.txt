<s> Purchased the Samsung 244T recently and hooked it up two nights ago to my new rig. </s>
<s> It was running fine for about 90 minutes and then all of a sudden the video became very distorted like the pixels were mass merging together. </s>
<s> Nothing was readable and the only thing viewable was color patterns. </s>
<s> It was almost as if you had an old television and would smack the side of it if the picture started going crazy. </s>
<s> I am trying to figure out though if it is a possible driver or overheat issue because its defective. </s>
<s> I do know that it isn't the video card because I have different monitor hooked up and working fine. </s>
<s> I am currently using an Nvidia 8800 with DVI. </s>
<s> I was reading somewhere though there might be a incompatibility issue between some 3rd party software that comes with the monitor and the video card but never seen it do what I am witnessing at the moment. </s>

<s> I just received my 244T and am experiencing the same problem. </s>
<s> I suspect it is an overheating issue. </s>
<s> Did you ever determine the actual cause of the problem? </s>
<s> Did you return it for a replacement? </s>
<s> Thanx </s>
<s> I contacted Samsung which was a very pleasent experiance. </s>
<s> They have you go through some checks (video card, DVI cable, etc) before they process your order. </s>
<s> They will either ship you a new monitor w/ stand straight to your house (placing a deposit on your credit card) or you can have them send it to an UPS store for replacement, which I did. </s>
<s> The new monitor came within 5 days and has been working very well since arriving. </s>
<s> Hope all goes well for you but make sure you give them a call. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I tried the monitor with another PC and same result. </s>
<s> Well I ordered mine from Amazon and am still within my 30 days so I don't need to utilize Samsung's warranty as yet. </s>
<s> I'm going to return it for an exchange. </s>
<s> I'll let you know how it goes... </s>
<s> Got my replacement monitor earlier in the week but just hooked it up and it worked right out of the box! </s>
<s> Re-installed driver anyway. </s>
<s> My Radeon X1400 graphics adapter is not supported by the MagicTune software but I MagicRotation does work! </s>
<s> Yet to play some DVDs but so far impressed... </s>
