1.1.2	Both the 2.4 and 5 ghz frequencies often seem to reduce throughput speeds substantially when I use them and then completely disable completely ( both bands disable at same time even when I 'm using just one ) .	St
1.1.3	To get back online , I have to either turn on/off router or manually enable the wireless bands again through a wired connection and the tomato GUI .	St
