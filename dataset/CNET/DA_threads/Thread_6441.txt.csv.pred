1.1.1	What happens if I put PC3200 RAM with super low timings ( 2-2-2-5 or such ) into a board and CPU that runs with PC2700 ?	Ques
1.1.2	Now what happens if I increase the FSB of the CPU with the PC3200 installed ?	Ques
1.1.3	CPU is AMD Thoroughbred 2600+ @ 2.13MHz	St
1.2.1	Either the pc3200 wo n't work , because the board does n't support , or the pc3200 will be underclocked to 333Mhz PC2700 .	St
1.2.2	As for increasing the fsb , this is n't an athlon 64 , so increasing will be just that a increase in fsb .	St
1.3.1	PC 2700 ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.2	If so the PC 3200 should simply run at the speed of the PC2700 .	St
1.3.3	As to the memory timing , how is the timing set in the BIOS ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.4	bY SPD , or can you set the CAS [ CL ] etc ?	Ques
1.3.5	Is the mobo an overclockers type ? ?	Ques
1.3.6	if so you may be able to increase the Memory clock speed 1 MHz at a time to see how fast it will run .	Sug
1.3.7	How can you increase the FSB other than by increasing the memory clock ? ?	Ques
1.3.8	?	Ques
1.4.1	using CPUID or Speedfan I can increase the FSB ( which does increase the memory clock ) , but the mem is OEM in my HP ( thus no BIOS options ) and so the RAM is pretty low quality , I ca n't increase the FSB past 138 ( from 133 ) without it becoming unstable .	St
1.4.2	My reasoning was , if I have better ram , then I could increase the FSB ( with these programs ) more because the RAM will allow me to go higher and be stable .	St
1.4.3	I was able to push it to 143MHz , but anything that cause above a 25 % CPU usage would blue screen the comp , albeit , I pushed the 2130 to 2300 or so .	St
1.4.4	I would like to get to 2600 stablely if I could , and I think the only way I can do this is with better ram .	St
1.4.5	Lowering the multiplier from x16 wo n't work , or I have n't found a program that will actually let me do it .	St
