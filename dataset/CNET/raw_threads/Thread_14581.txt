I have moved my home-office upstairs and would like to use D-Link TM-G5240 as a wireless bridge that would connect 3 wired computers and 1 wired printer to the network. I have tried configuring the TM-G5240 according to the owners manual, but the manual is decidedly thin on details. The last thing I did was to give the D-Link TM-G5240 a static ip address on the home network (192.168. 0.140), and to communicate on the same channel (6) to the home network SSID on the Linksys WRTU54G-TM ip address (192.168.0.1) using the correct wpa password. When I try to renew the ip address of a wired computer I see activity on both the wireless and port lights on the TM-G5240. The wired computer never gets a good ip address. Instead it gets a 169.x.x.x address. Please help

I've worked around this by manually assigning the IP, Netmask, Default Gateway and DNS entries but sounds defective to me and your choice to live with this. Bob

Maybe someone else will have a different response. I do have a couple of other wireless routers. They might be better candidates for this experiment.. Thanks for your input. Ray

New out of the box doesn't mean it's fully debugged and works with all other routers. I noted a workaround but if you can't do that, and they fail to fix it with firmware or support, get your money back. Bob
