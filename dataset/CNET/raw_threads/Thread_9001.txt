Sorry, have to go get it downstairs... It's just some Top-G made in China DVD all format recorder with: - Passable install manual. - IDE cable - Audio cable (generic) - Mounting screws - Roxio's Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 - PowerDVD (a DVD player software) - Roxio's PhotoSuite 5 - one DVD+R/W media For 79 bucks, this seems to be an easy choice. bob
