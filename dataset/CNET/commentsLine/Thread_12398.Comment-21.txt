this printer is similar to the c411, but a little slower.
i had one of the cheaper color laser printers, a samsung clp550, but this ricoh printer has much cheaper consumables (the toner is a simple plastic jug, not a cartridge with rollers, gears, etc.
i think the person complaining about the ricoh printing on card stock did not have card stock chosen in the print driver.
this printer came with some features that the samsung did not.
it came with a card with sample print outs and directions to print an internal file for color calibration.
it also came with an internal page to print to physically align the print out on the page for all page handling input units (cassette, manual, duplex) very useful you want to duplex stuff and have them line up.
