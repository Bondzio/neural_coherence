Windows 98 SE, HP Pavilion.
I added a hard drive yesterday, and it shows up and everything works fine as long as I go into the BIOS when I start it up.
If I don't go into the BIOS, (I don't even have to do anything in there, I just go into it, and exit, and the 2nd hard drive works 100%) then the hard drive won't show up in My Computer, and it shows up in control panel under add new hardware that my 2nd hard &quot;This device is either not present, not working correctly, or does not have all the drivers installed properly.
(Code 10) What am I doing wrong, I know its probably something dumb.
