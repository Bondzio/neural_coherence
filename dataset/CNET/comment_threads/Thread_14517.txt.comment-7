If so, you may indeed need to install a third party driver to get XP to recognize the drive.
This is usually done by hitting F6 when prompted during initial installation and then installing the driver from a floppy.
I would check with the motherboard manufacturer and see if they provide SATA/RAID drivers that you can put on a floppy, or perhaps copy them from the provided CD.
There should be instructions either in the mobo manual or online.
