Just bought my new A8N-SLI Deluxe.
Just before windows xp starts up, I get the blue screen of death, giving me the speil about a.
)possibly having a virus, and b.)
having a corrupt harddrive.
I switched out my HD with an older one that i know works, and still got the same problem.
Booting in safe mode does not help.
the exact error message: ***STOP: 0x0000007B (0xF78A2640, 0x0000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000) System- AMD Athlon 64 3000+ A8N-SLI Deluxe mobo XfX nvidia geForce 7600 gt
