i too am beginning a custom invitation design business...up until now i always printed with a local printer, but think i'm losing a ton of money by doing that and have decided to invest in a good laser printer.
i work primarily with stardream paper so it's important that the printer i select have the capacity to print on this.
all suggestions are appreciated...thanks!
