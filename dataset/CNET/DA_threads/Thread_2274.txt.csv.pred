1.1.2	lets just say it usually took about 40min total to copy onto the harddrive and burn a dvd .	St

1.1.4	this was pretty abrupt .	St
1.1.5	ive defragged , & scanned for everything .	St
1.1.6	not sure what else to do .	Res
1.1.7	dont know if this matters , but theres about 30GB of space left on my 120GB harddrive , but this never prevented a faster burn before .	St
1.1.8	win xp P4 2.8GHZ 512MB Ram	St
1.2.1	I select recording at 1/2 the media or drive speed whichever is lowest because & quot ; I 've learned the lesson. & quot ; Maybe a good thing ?	Ques
1.2.2	Also , the DVD may be copy protected and it takes longer ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	i forgot to mention this before but before it suddenly slowed down , i was able to use the internet & play music seamlessly & the burning process didnt take any longer than usual .	St
1.3.2	but i will try to burn a disc at 1/2 speed	Sug
1.4.1	Type XP DMA into google.com and consider setting the channels to PIO and back to DMA as noted in the first article from Microsoft .	St

1.5.4	im not sure if ive mentioned this before but i used to be able to multitask alot while burning dvds , but now just to be sure that the burn comes out without errors i have to refrain from strenuous activity .	St
1.5.5	for example i could listen to music , play a flash game , burn a dvd , and surf the web with no slow down at the same time .	Sug

1.6.2	And if the owner is n't watching every update they may miss what caused the change .	St
