<s> I'm in the process of upgrading my old p3 processor and I'm a bit confused. </s>
<s> I have a p3 600 (coppermine), does that mean my motherboard is a slot 1? </s>
<s> or a slot 370? </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> It could be either. </s>
<s> Open the case and look. </s>

<s> it says 600eb/256/133/1.65v s1 can I safely assume that s1 means socket 1? </s>
<s> The form factor for me is a gimme. </s>
<s> The slot one has a big ole BRICK unit for the CPU and the 370 is pretty square with the usual heatsink and fan on top. </s>
<s> Did you look? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> it's pretty rectangular it has a heatsink, no fan though </s>
<s> To see what can be done, the make/model of the motherboard is needed to find what CPUs can be fitted. </s>
<s> It's rare to find a fanless P3. </s>
