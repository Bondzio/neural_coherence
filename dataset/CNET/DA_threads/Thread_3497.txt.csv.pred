1.1.1	Just wondering if there are any external hard drives that will automatically update files on your hard drive?	St
1.1.2	I own a business and would like to auto save all my files in a designated area at the end of each work day.	St
1.1.3	For example... set it to save all my files in my C:/My Documents/TJdavisInc/ drive at 6pm every night.	St
1.1.4	Is this possible?	St
1.1.5	steve	St
1.2.1	This drives are all hardware and would need SOFTWARE to do this.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Is there any software already developed for this?	Ques
1.5.1	Read http://learn.quinnipiac.edu/at/atdocs/tut/syncback/syncback.html for an example.	St
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	First write a batchfile with the right xcopy-command(s).	St
1.6.2	Something like: xcopy &quot;c:\documents and settings\&lt;myusername&gt;\my documents&quot; e:\backup /m /s /y This copies all files in your My documents folder to the e:\backup folder including all files in subfolders (/s).	St
1.6.3	It only copies new and changed files (that have the archive bit set) and resets the archive so the file is copied only once (/m).	St
1.6.4	And it doesn't ask questions (/y).	St
1.6.5	First time run it without /m to copy everything to have a base for the &quot;incremental backup&quot;.	St
1.6.6	Then use the task scheduler in your OS to run a batchfile at a certain time each day.	St
1.6.7	This is the Windows XP version: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308569 Or activate the job via a shortcut on the desktop if you want to do it at other times.	St
1.6.8	All of this comes with Windows, and is totally free.	St
1.6.9	It might take 15 minutes to set it up, and that's your whole investment.	Sug
1.6.10	You can use My Computer or Windows Explorer to get files back, if needed on any Windows PC: the files aren't encrypted or packed into archives.	St
1.6.11	Hope this helps.	St
1.6.12	Kees	St
1.7.1	A lot of units come with software that you can set up to do what you're asking (assuming you're XP/Vista) Some of the applications are limited to backing up either only My Documents or the whole disk, whereas others will let you do specific folders.	St
1.7.2	You can schedule it, or set it to go manually.	St
1.7.3	Personally I can't stand when a backup comes on while I'm tryin to finish my work.	St
1.7.4	One example (not a plug, just a product I'm familiar with) is Seagate's One Touch.	St
1.7.5	You buy the drive and it comes with the program.	St
