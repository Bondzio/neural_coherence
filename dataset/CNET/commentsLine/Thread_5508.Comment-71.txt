hi, and thanks to everyone for their help.
i have a wd external drive i was using as a backup, and it now is not recognized at all.
when i plug it in, i hear a somewhat loud clicking sound, as though something is trying to engage.
i'm not sure whether the repair that charlie recommended to virginia would also be recommended in this case, or whether the clicking sound represents something more ominous.
please let me know.
this drive has had very little use in the two years i've had it, since i have used large capacity thumb drives more frequently.
however, there are some files that are on the wd drive which i would like to recover, as they are not available anyplace else.
thanks again.
