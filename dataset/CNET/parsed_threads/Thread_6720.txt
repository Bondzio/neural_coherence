<s> Hello, when i am putting my Seagate external hard disk into the USB cable, the drive light turns on as it does normally,the green icon at bottom right in toolbar appears as well, but there is no autoplay and the drive is absent from 'My Computer'. </s>
<s> It is appearing in the device manager. </s>
<s> Explorer is running very slow. </s>
<s> The same thing is happening with the drive in every other cable and in other computers as well. </s>
<s> Please give an insight if you can as to what may have happened and what can be done. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> dont detect anything suggesting a solution to the above. </s>
<s> That's why we have a backup copy. </s>
<s> Since it happens the same all over it sounds like a lost format. </s>
<s> That is there is no file system on the drive. </s>
<s> Since discussions and more about Windows Disk Management is widely discussed on how to partition and format the drive, I'll stop here. </s>

<s> Forum posts (and other forums too) for people reporting the same problem. </s>
<s> What have you tried ? </s>
<s> Have you tested the drive on another USB port, tried another USB cable, tested with another PC, tried the bare drive as an internal drive in another PC ? </s>
<s> What does it show under disk management ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> tried all of the ways that you hav mentioned.However, when I keep the disk attached to the port for sometime, after half an hour or so, autoplay starts, takes ten minutes, n then the drive opens, so i guess now the problem is somewhat different. </s>
<s> Thanks for taking out the time to answer. </s>
<s> But it does sound like you can save your files before they are lost. </s>
<s> Drives fail in many ways so this does not sound different to me. </s>
<s> The only new thing is I'm encountering folk that are new to PCs or computers and don't believe they need to backup. </s>
<s> That is, they actually think that all the problems with PCs have been solved. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> are you talking to me? </s>
<s> when did I even mention that i dont feel the need to back up? </s>
<s> backing up concerns my data, wont solve the problem with the disk. </s>
<s> Go into Windows disk management (yep, that built in) and try to delete the current partition(s) and make (a) new one(s). </s>
<s> But it could be a hardware issue. </s>
<s> Then the possible solutions are: 1. </s>
<s> Get the disk out and put it in another enclosure. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Buy a new one. </s>

<s> Maybe you know better but you can imagine it's getting worse not better on the subject of backup. </s>
<s> The newer owners are being told less and less about this area and urban lore is running wild about how SSD is safer than HDD because you won't lose your files. </s>
<s> (that's a dang lie.) </s>
<s> Backup will solve this one. </s>
<s> Replace the defective parts, restore to the fixed drive and you're all good. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> hey Kees thanks for your advice.my question to you is does this procedure (deleting partition) damage the data within the disk? </s>
<s> I have been following this since I face somewhat the same problem. </s>
<s> 'Damage' isn't the right word. </s>
<s> It's simply deleted. </s>
<s> But since it isn't accessible at the moment anyway, that's no great loss. </s>
<s> As you might know (and if you didn't you know now), it's definitely not recommended to use an external disk as STORAGE. </s>
<s> They are too unreliable to trust your only copy of data to. </s>
<s> They are perfect for moving large amounts of data between computers that aren't in a local network, and the are perfect also as one of your backup media, and that's it. </s>
<s> So if they fail and can't be repaired by putting them in another enclosure, you buy a new one and backup your data again. </s>
