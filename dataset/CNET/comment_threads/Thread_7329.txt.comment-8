If you type THE DEAD PC on google you find the usual tips about stripping the machine down to the 4 parts and testing it.
If the 4 parts don't power up, you are looking at the 1 to 4 possible bad parts.
My advice is (repeating?)
when I can't tell which part it is, and I can't use my past experience as a guide or Volt METER or &quot;THE GREEN WIRE PSU TEST&quot; (google) then I replace the cheapest part first.
