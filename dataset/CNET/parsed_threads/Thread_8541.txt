<s> Hi All, This will be my first photo printer purchase so please recommend what you think would be best from your personal experiences. </s>
<s> I am seeing so many models that I can't figure out what the difference really is between all the different lines of printers in Canon or Epson. </s>
<s> I've been looking so far at the pixma8500 and the i9900. </s>
<s> It seems like the former is discontinued? </s>
<s> And then the i9900 came out? </s>
<s> I have also read about the Canon Selphy. </s>
<s> I just simply don't know which one to get! </s>
<s> Superior picture quality is of utmost importance to me. </s>
<s> Second is money (max: $500). </s>
<s> Other features like speed, card readers, pict bridge, etc... they are great, but not so purposeful for me since I won't be printing out so frequently, and mostly will be from my laptop. </s>
<s> I don't print out pictures every time, but I do like to select my best ones and custom make albums, scrapbooks etc... so that's why I prefer the quality over anything else. </s>
<s> My friends swear by Epson, and I have seen their printers at work. </s>
<s> They are great, but I find them rather bulky in style. </s>
<s> The canon's I''ve been checking out seem much less space hogging? </s>
<s> I haven't gone to a physical shop yet to test out any of the brands I've read online so please offer any advice. </s>
<s> Thanks!! </s>
<s> P. S. Oh right, one more feature is the cd/dvd supported option. </s>
<s> I know Epson Stylus supports them, but do any of the Canon's? </s>
<s> I've been reading reviews after another, but they don't mention it... mmm. </s>
<s> ...between photo printers (which are small devices which only do 4&quot; or 6&quot; prints), and colour Printers (A4 sized prints), which can of course also print onto white label CD's. </s>

<s> Taking specific models out of the matter for now, here's what I've picked up with a lot of experience with the two brands: Both print fantastic photos. </s>
<s> Canon tends to be notably faster, though. </s>
<s> That said, Epson seems to print more accurate colors without having to edit the photo. </s>
<s> Generally speaking, professional photographers seem to be die-hard toward Epson. </s>
<s> I've known some to switch, but I've also noticed lately an upswing of Canon-converts switching back to Epson. </s>
<s> What they told me was it was primarily due to the drivers. </s>
<s> Apparently Canon's were far less feature-rich and/or much harder to use. </s>
<s> I've used some Canon products and can vouch for how confusing their interfaces tend to be. </s>
<s> Epson has a major advantage on photo longevity over Canon, as well, which may be important to you. </s>
<s> Now as for models, you do seem to be listing an odd range. </s>
<s> You're mentioning wide-format photo printers, photo printers with card slots (which are usually not the professional grade or wide-format printers), and a 4x6 snapshot printer. </s>
<s> You might want to narrow down what it is you want in range, first, and then pick a model. </s>
<s> And I wouldn't say comparable Canons are any smaller than Epsons. </s>
<s> Both print borderlessly and both use individual cartridges, so there's not much wiggle room left there. </s>
<s> Some Canons may look a touch sleeker, but I'd be more concerned by the appearance of their output than the appearance of the machine. </s>
<s> Oh, and in the US, anyway, CD printing is Epson exclusive. </s>
