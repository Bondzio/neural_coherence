There's a small chance it's a problem with your PC (the USB-port), so try the same things you do now on another PC.
If that's OK, the external drive is OK.
The next small chance is that it's an issue of the electronics in the case.
That's easy to check by putting the drive in another case.
The most likely thing is that the disk has gone south.
The only solution then: replace it.
Try to get off as many files as you can, and if that's not enough find your creditcard and go to a professional data recovery company to do the others.
For the future: BACKUP!
