well when you are restoring your hard drive it most likely is restoring from a factory image sotred on a hidden partition.
if this is the case it will not affect your 2nd hd.
to be safe i would image your c: drive to the new slave hd.
aslo in this case the restore software would not let you overwrite the hd with the image on it because it is the source drive and not the target drive.
hope this helps.
the best imaging software is acronis in my opinion.
ghost is lousy and cumbersome compare to acronis and acronis is faster.
