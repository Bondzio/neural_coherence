<s> I am using Win XP Home, NERO dvd burning software and my burner is _NEC DVD_RW ND-1300A. </s>
<s> Everything has worked fine in burning my movies for months. </s>
<s> Now suddenly when I try to burn, I get the msg &quot;illlegal disc&quot; &quot;could not perform start of disc-at-once&quot; I am using Ritek brand of discs and they have worked fine for me for a long time. </s>
<s> The support group at Nero has been no help. </s>
<s> I am desperate so if someone could pls make a suggestion!! </s>
<s> thanks in advance Virgil Hummel </s>
<s> What happens? </s>
<s> CD/DVD Lens Cleaner? </s>
<s> Another drive? </s>
<s> same drive, Ritek DVD-R 4x blanks (same pack i'd used last summer to burn 40 discs without a single coaster), and Nero. </s>
<s> i get errors using Roxio 6 Classic too, so i don't think i can blame the apps, although i still can't eliminate XP as the cause (may be the first time i've tried burning DVDs since i installed SP2...) but maybe i'm clutching at straws. </s>
<s> at this point, i'm about ready to drop $40-$50 for a 16x drive :^O </s>
