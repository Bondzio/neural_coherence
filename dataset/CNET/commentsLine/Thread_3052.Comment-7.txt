i wanna blank the hard disk !
lol i used dban on it and it detected 2 partitions ide - 000 and ide - 001 !
i didnt choose automatic and yes i wasnt sure what i was doing !
so i guess what i did was use quick erase on the 001 partition .... then i reinstalled xp from the recovery disks .
then i was gonna try to install my own xp home not a recovery disk.
and when i got to the part when u can delete the partition it said that the partition was a system partition ... so i didnt do it !
all im asking is .... will i have a problem if i erase this so called system partition?
your advice would be much appricated .
