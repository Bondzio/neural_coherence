<s> I have a Canon DVD camcorder DC210. </s>
<s> I have a MAC G5 OS X 10.4.11 I want to download movies from the canon to the desktop but the camera does not have a USB port. </s>
<s> what are my options? </s>
<s> this camera records directly onto DVD so your only option is to take the finished DVD and copy it onto your Mac. </s>
<s> Without any conversion of the video, you will not be able to edit it using iMovie. </s>

<s> thanks for the info. </s>
<s> what is the best camera to have for downloading to a computer. </s>
<s> one w/ a usb type hard drive? </s>
<s> I guess for now, I am stuck or I should say my wife is stuck w/ her camera. </s>
<s> oh, well mike </s>
<s> All of the Hard drive based camera's will download to the Mac, as will most of the mini DV tape models. </s>
<s> These typically use a Firewire connection while the Hard Drive based ones use USB. </s>
<s> Sony make a good range, which work with iMovie but there is one major brand that does not work with Mac at all. </s>
<s> I'll find the name and post it here later. </s>
<s> You can edit the footage from the one you have but you first have to convert it to something that iMovie can handle. </s>
<s> Take a look at this page on the Apple site. </s>
<s> It deals with importing video from a disk. </s>
