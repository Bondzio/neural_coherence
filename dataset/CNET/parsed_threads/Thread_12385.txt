<s> I have a couple of old computers at home and would like to turn them into servers for my friend's site, http://snooples.com where they are all cluster together (I think this is the right terminology), so if one computer fails, then the other one kicks in. </s>
<s> This way the server will always be up. </s>
<s> I just want to know if this is possible? </s>
<s> Also, if one computer is corrupted or becomes infected, will they all be infected as well (since they are clustered)? </s>
<s> Then what is the best way to back up my data? </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> To do this right you need a load balancer. </s>
<s> Still that is only the network side. </s>
<s> The servers themselves have to be able keep track of each others status and detect any failure. </s>
<s> This gets very complex very fast since you have issue like open files and databases to deal with and that does not even start to think about open sessions to a end users that you would want to fail over. </s>
<s> If you are good with linux you can most likely get most this done for free. </s>
<s> If you do not have the skills you are better off paying a hosting company. </s>
<s> I suggest you not do this. </s>
<s> DONATE the machines to him and let him configure and maintain them but to run a server for a friend is a good way to lose a friend. </s>
