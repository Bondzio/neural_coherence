the pc is bought from mesh computers (online) it said when i purchased it that it had intergrated 7.1 surround sound, i'm not sure if this is suitable or not... and is there any images of the types of connection i would need for both screen and headphones?
it would be a little difficult to get a decent image of the back of my pc atm... thanks for the quick reply by the way
