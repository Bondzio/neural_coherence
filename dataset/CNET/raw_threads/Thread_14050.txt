I am looking for specific instructions on how to remedy the problem of random packet loss. I've had Comcast dig up my yard, spent countless HOURS w/tech supp. for Linksys & Dell with NO results. FINALLY someone mentioned 'packet loss and random disconnect' - this is me!! I have 2 new Dell laptops & 1 new Dell desktop all with Vista 64 bit. My router is Linksys WRT160N. Please tell me **HOW** to fix this problem. I need specific detailed instructions. I am not a pc newbie, yet not an expert either. I have reviewed the other threads only to see coloquial commentary responses. Feel free to e-mail me directly @ razzzberryl@yahoo.com Regards, Zippygirl

There can be interfering signals that you must accept the occasional drop. If there must be no drop, get wired. Also, do not use a router. Connect directly to Comcast's cable modem. Bob

The desktop is the one I fight with the most losing the signal. It will be ok for a while then it just drops off. The irony is that when the desktop drops off I have a good connection on the laptops & Xbox. And when the wireless laptops & Xbox lose connection the desktop is good. It doesn't make any sense! As I mentioned I have spent HOURS to figure it out. I have: reset every modem, router, reset & reconfigured the router, the mac address, secured the network, ipconfig/release, ipconfig/renew, ipconfig/flushdns, repaired the connection thru control panel - and nothing works.

It could be the NAT component of your router. Use default settings--DCHP, IPV4-obtain ip auto. Borrow a friend's router or buy from an electronic store that allows 100% return.

11710	9	351763	3090499	3090462	R. Proffitt	7/28/09 5:41 AM	1.24875966E12	Firsthand.	As an electronics designer I lived in labs where we would design wireless gear. What I must do is to avoid all the tech language and share that 2.4GHz cordless phones, microwave ovens and other things can cause a wifi signal to drop. But let's hear what you call &quot;packet loss.&quot; Bob

All along I thought my problem was something OTHER than the router because I had repalced it with a new one (same model wrt160n). Therein lied my problem the same crappy Linksys. I bought a Netgear RangeMax Wireless-N Gigabit WNR3500 and the problem disappeared immediately. My network is lightening fast! All along they were telling me it was my ISP followed by someone else's theory of 'packet loss'. Spread the word of an outstanding product Netgear as well as my tale of woe with Linksys. I kindly thank you all for your time & feedback. Zippygirl

I kept getting dropped connections and limited connectivity and thought it was my ISP. I jumped on my MacBook and noticed the wireless was perfectly fine, and so was my XBOX 360 connection, so it wasn't my ISP. Then I thought it had something to do with some software I installed on my new rig, so I did some troubleshooting with that for about a week with no luck. Finally, I narrowed it down to the router. I had no connection issues with my last PC connected to the router (Win7 32Bit), so I figured it must be a compatibility issue with the router and the new 64bit version of windows running on my PC. Problem Solved: Went to the linksys website and grabbed the new Firmware Version: v2.0.03, updated, and haven't had a problem since.
