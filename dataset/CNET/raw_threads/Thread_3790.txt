I don't know how, but it recenty got messed up with the BIOS, etc. Ok I want to reformat the whole thing, start all over again with the hard drives. I do have a full version of the Windows OS. I inserted that in the PC, but I can't boot the system. It tells me to insert a floppy as the boot disk. I want to insert a cd, and the floopy won't work. How do I set the BIOS to read the CD. I have never touched or played with the bios before, so what do I do?

I read in another post that I need to make the BIOS read my cd drive which I do not know how to do. ABS did ship with a boot floppy, but that got damaged somehow.

I still want to know how do I make my BIOS read my cd-rom drive first. I know what you mean by playing around in Setup, but I don't know where to go from there. In Setup I get like 8 options and that is all. Anyone know what I do in Setup to make my cd-rom drive read my Windows cd? I just want a fresh clean start all over again from my ABS system. I want all the files deleted (including the spyware) and I want a new start.

Use the arrow keys to navigate through the menus, use the Enter key to select a menu or option. Sometimes you may have to use the plus or minus keys to move items up or down a list. Look for something that says: startup disk startup order boot volume boot disk boot order etc.

I tried using the floppy to boot but I think that my floppy drive is defective. My system tells me that there is a Pri HDD error, then it tells me to insert a floppy to boot. I downloaded the correct Windows boot floopy download from Microsoft.com, transferred what I downloaded to floppies, inserted them in the floppy drive, and the drive won't read the floppies. I really need step by step instructions on how to make my BIOS read the cd-rom drive.

Motherboard model? Make & model of HD? Can you pop the drive into another system to wipe it clean or run a formatting utility from the drive mfg?
3006	9	140820	1582282	1582234	Eddiefromalienwarecomps	12/5/05 6:20 PM	1.1338068E12	You want me to give you all that info?	I got someone else telling me to change my BIOS sequence so it can read my cd-rom drive first. I did that but the computer still wants me to insert a floppy to boot. Is there any other information I should post about this situation?
3006	10	140820	1582376	1582282	linkit	12/5/05 7:28 PM	1.13381088E12	ok, a simpler question	You never stated what version of windows you are trying to install. That is important. 95? 98? ME, 2000? XP Home? XP Media Center? XP 64-bit? Other? Did the machine ship with Windows 98? Has XP ever been successfully installed on the machine? From what you have stated thus far, I have no idea.
3006	11	140820	1583831	1582376	Eddiefromalienwarecomps	12/6/05 12:48 PM	1.13387328E12	Ok	I run Windows XP home. I believe it came with 98 installed and another person upgraded the system to XP for me. That person has moved elsewhere and I don't know where he lives. My ABS did work with the XP and after it got infected with spyware, I didn't know what to do. Somehow at first my computer worked fine. It was able to boot regularly but I couldn't use my usb mouse or my ps/2 mouse. I played around in setup and my computer couldn't boot. It kept saying Pri Slave HDD error and it keeps asking me to insert a floppy and this is where I am now.

Also, open the box up with the power off and gently push all the cables into their sockets. Then boot that drive fitness test CD or diskette to see if the hard disk passes. Looks like a hardware issue so far. Good thing everyone here makes a backup. Bob
