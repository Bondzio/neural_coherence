Since that happend my PC has been turning itself off. To make things funny it only happen when standing. When I put PC on the side it works fine. I replaced video card and power supply unit, no good. It looks to me, there is some loose connection or something gets overheat, but how can I figure out what?

I would also swap out the HDMI cable, those are simple cables. It helps to know what's what, PC? video card? etc.. There also the possibility the mtrbd. has been compromised, minor crack or component in some fashion, unless you can fix, replacement is only option if found so. tada -----Willy
