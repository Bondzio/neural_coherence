Unlike many other companies that may use an Abit, Gigabyte or other, what you find is Sony makes their own and what they tell about it is at their web site and what came with the machine. Bob

It will tell you what chipset you have and any other info there is on the system. It is the way to get most answers to system questions.

Tried for days to convince them-but it took in-person demo/show&tell to convince them....thanks for the links at freshdevices
