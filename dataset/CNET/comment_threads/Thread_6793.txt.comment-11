xp will run good with 1gb.
If you already are a gig or more, go for the video card.
WHY?
XP 'likes' about 1gb of memory to stay out of the swapfile.
Any time xp reads/writes to the swapfile, everything stops... A 8800gtx won't help here...
It will just look great while waiting for the swapfile to finish.
If you have LESS than 1gb of memory, forget about the video card and buy as much memory as you can afford (and what your computer can use).
1gb is my minimum, with 2gb being a sweet spot.
