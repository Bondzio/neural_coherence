the difference is mostly in the quality of the hardware.
better lens and better sensor.
a bunch of megapixels is not very useful.
if it can handle 640x480, that's about tops.
you can use a webcam on dial-up but it is not very satisfactory, especially if you are using voice too.
a high-speed internet connection is very important for producing acceptable pictures over the net.
