1.1.1	Hello everyone.	St
1.1.2	I am researching notebook options for physicians.	St
1.1.3	We need a lightweight notebook with an external battery that performs well.	St
1.1.4	We have tried the Fujitsu life book and was EXTREMELY disappointed.	St
1.1.5	Any suggestions are appreciated.	St
1.2.1	There is no such thing since the market didn't accept such.	St
1.2.2	However, you can put together the iGO battery packs you see at Radio Shack with most laptops.	St
1.2.3	Best of luck, Bob	St
