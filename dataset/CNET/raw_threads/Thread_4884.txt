Moved to a newer PC (3gHz P-4, w2k) and the scanner doesn't work. Gives error: &quot;! UNABLE TO LOCATE SCANNER Unable to start a scan session. Device is disconnected.&quot; Tried to query HP support, no reply, probably because 1100a is no longer supported. Bought a CD which I hoped would be a newer driver but when installed, fails in the same way. And it was the same 4.3.2.50 release even though the part number on the CD was different. I installed the software on my laptop (500mHz P-3, w2k) and it works fine although if I unplug the parallel port cable I get the same error message. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

These tend to not work on new machines (port speed changed) or the OS isn't installed proper (motherboard drivers). You didn't share the gritty details. If you supplied just what you did in your post above, HP and others may just write you off. Bob

Its on a parallel port (tried LPT1 & LPT2) and except that some of the older ones were not bidirectional am not aware of any settings it can do. Of course it could be flakeyness in the MB/BIOS as I have found other glitches in this MB (ECS 848P-A) and I am considering scrapping it and putting in a better one. I selected it because it was on sale together with the P-4. What would I look for in the BIOS? Rich

I did have a few clients that would never say die and the fix was to install a PCI LPT card. The timing appears to be the older centronics speed then. But it cost as much as a new USB scanner! Bob

As a matter of fact I have already done that with a PCI card from SIIG with identical results. I already have another scanner, not a USB but on a parallel port (shared with another printer). It works fine on LPT1 (haven't tried it on the SIIG card (LPT2)). What I like about this scanner (and I suspect that any new scanner would be different) is that its a sheet feed, which scans a page in seconds and I am able to feed additional sheets in which is especially handy when I am sending a multi-page fax. The flatbed scanner takes several minutes per page and can only do one page at a time. A multi-page fax takes too long and must be saved as multiple winfax attachments to send as a fax. Rich
