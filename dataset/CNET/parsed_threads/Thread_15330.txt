<s> I have an almost 10 year old PC that I've kept limping along, but finally seems to have bit the dust. </s>
<s> It simply won't turn on. </s>
<s> A power supply failure is the most obvious reason; however, I never heard any noises coming from it nor did I get a burning smell. </s>
<s> Instead, over the past week on other occasions when it wouldn't power on, I simply unplugged the cord and plugged it back into a different outlet. </s>
<s> I did this successfully probably three different times. </s>
<s> So I'm wondering whether this sounds more like a power cord issue rather than the power supply. </s>
<s> Yes, I could simply purchase a new cord and try it out, but thought I'd ask first since I've never heard of a power cord not working. </s>
<s> By the way, I don't expect to keep using the PC, but it would be nice to access a few things that had not been backed up. </s>
<s> You probably have access to another AC cord, swap it your monitor one and retry again. </s>
<s> I rarely have any incidents of bad AC cords, far more bad PSUs. </s>
<s> Since, you mentioned a 10yr. </s>
<s> old system, well can be time to replace if you can find another similar PSU if not a better one should you want to repair. </s>
<s> As for accessing any data/files, remove the HD and mount in ext. </s>
<s> USB case and/or similar adapter in order to retrieve. </s>
<s> Google for ADA-2020 adapter or locate ext. </s>
<s> USB cases that match your HD requirements. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice--it didn't occur to me to use the monitor power cord! </s>
<s> Unfortunately, that didn't work, so I believe it's the power supply. </s>
