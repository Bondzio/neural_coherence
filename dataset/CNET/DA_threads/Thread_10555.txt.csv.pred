1.1.1	I am looking at purchasing an external drive for backup purposes.	St
1.1.2	What is a recommended size for a backup drive.	St
1.1.3	My hard drive is 55G and with about 29 used.	St
1.2.1	Some of the tenants about backup is that we need to have one to backup to.	St
1.2.2	Another with the copy in a write protected state and the last copy not in the same building or city.	St
1.2.3	That means we need 3 drives.	St
1.2.4	And they need a write protect switch to keep the contents safe.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the info, but the question was not answered.	St
1.3.2	Also, this is for a home system so I don't belived the multiple drives/locations are necessary.	St
1.4.1	Plus it doesn't matter if for home or business.	St
1.4.2	The tenants of proper backup do not change.	St
1.4.3	If you want more proof that backup is usually disregarded we only need to read other members posts about trying to recover files or accidental wipeouts of the backup (hence the need for the write protect switch.)	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	What software will you be using to back up your system ?	Ques
1.6.1	that backing up only what I can't afford to loose is the easiest.	St
1.6.2	I have a 60 Gig Maxtor in an external case.	St
1.6.3	I drag and drop my favorites, emails, sounds, pictures, movies, etc.	St
1.6.4	I then burn them to a DVD disk.	St
