Web pages are columns using only one half to one third of the nice big screen. I can &quot;zoom&quot; but that is not a permanent solution. This includes the tool bar........ its tiny. How do I make things readable and fit the screen? I cannot find the answer in the manual or online but I may be searching the wrong criteria. Help in the form of the correct web page is fine.

Problem with that is that the web pages are not built to fill the whole screen. Most are built to accommodate a 19&quot; monitor. Try hitting the green button, top left of the window, and Safari will expand to the actual size of the web page. P

Current model MB Pros don't suffer the slightly soft, out of focus screen that results when you use any setting other than the highest screen res. But if you did buy an older model then you are just going to have to live with command+ every time you open a new browser window. Or you can decrease screen res and learn to live with the slightly soft screen. 1600 x 1000 is the lowest setting I can tolerate but image/text will still appear proportionally smaller than on a 15&quot; MB Pro set to a native res of 1440 x 900 or a 20&quot; Apple cinema display set to its native res of 1680 x 1050.
