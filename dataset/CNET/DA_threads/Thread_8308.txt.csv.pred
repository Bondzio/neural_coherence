1.1.1	Win 98 , ECS K7S5A motherboard , Xtasy G2 Vid card , 2 13 gig WD HDDs , 1 DVD optical drive , 1 12X Iomega burner , 1.4 Ghz AMD cpu and 1 256 meg stick no-name pc2100 ram .	St
1.1.2	Last night , my wife shut down the computer , but it was hanging waiting for a program to end .	St
1.1.3	After about 2 mins .	St
1.1.4	and no shutdown , she called me over , and I could smell an electrical burning kinda smell , so I powered everything off from the surge protector .	St
1.1.5	This morning , I opened up the case and tried to power on and could see the G2 vid card fan was n't spinning- smelled the card and could smell that stinky electrical smell .	St
1.1.6	Powered off from power strip , as I ca n't by hitting the computer 's power button in front , can power off PSU from rear on/off switch .	St
1.1.7	Replaced vid card with my old ti4200 , and could see the led light and the fan was spinning .	St
1.1.8	Reasonably sure the old vid card is dead .	St
1.1.9	No scorch marks near cpu , as I 've seen from other fried chips .	St
1.1.10	Now , I still ca n't bootup .	St
1.1.11	I pulled all hardware from their pci slots and all ide cables ; had to leave the 256 meg pc2100 ram stick in , and vid card for video- did this to see if I could get into BIOS , no go .	St
1.1.12	So it 's down to this : The 400 watt power supply seems to be working ; all fans spin , and when hardware was installed , where there were led lights , they were lit .	St
1.1.13	So I took out all hardware except the vid card and ram , hoping to get into BIOS ; I cleared the BIOS by shorting the CMOS jumper caps , fwiw .	St
1.1.14	The cpu seems is OK ; the original AMD heatsink and fan are cool as a cucumber to the touch , and the fan spins .	St
1.1.15	So that leads me to believe it 's the 1 stick of ram that went bad .	St
1.1.16	I do n't have another stick to test with .	St
1.1.17	Changed monitors also just to be sure .	St
1.1.18	No beeps , no nothing .	St
1.1.19	Oh , I did find one stick of 32 meg pc100 168 pin ( well , it fit , there were no markings on the chip to tell me exactly what type of ram , only how many megs ; *think* it was pc100 , could have been 66MHz for all I know ) ; still no go getting into BIOS .	St
1.1.20	The board supports 168 & 184 pin ram ; pulled the 256 pc2100 for this test .	St
1.1.21	So my feeling is the ram is shot ( hopefully , but I 'm not sure since I could n't get into BIOS with the 32 meg stick ) .	St
1.1.22	Have n't ruled out the board being blown , nor the chip & PSU .	St
1.1.23	Just want to know if people agree with my assessment at the moment ( being optimistic . )	St
1.1.24	Never had a problem with this system except for the normal Win '98 probs .	St
1.1.25	TIA .	St
1.2.1	That CPU was not known to survive much ...	St
1.2.2	But you should go for beeps .	St
1.2.3	Just four parts .	St
1.2.4	PSU , CPU/HSF , motherboard and speaker .	St
1.2.5	No beeps= you are looking at the bad parts .	St
1.2.6	Another issue is that the boards with SDRAM or DDRAM support required a lot of configuration .	St
1.2.7	If one did unplug one type of RAM and instll the other type without changing the jumpers , my bet is that you could fry something on the motherboard .	St
1.2.8	I hope you configured it proper .	St
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	knew how to use it .	St
1.3.2	LOL { they 're cheap , get one from Radio Shack . ]	St
1.3.3	Only possible info for me would be related to beeps .	St
1.3.4	Did you normally get a beep when booting up ? ?	Ques
1.3.5	Then you should get lots of beeps with all of the stuff removed AND removing the video card physically .	Sug
1.3.6	I 'll post this and then read your post again to see if I can glean anythinh else .	St
1.3.7	If you have to replace the mobo I hope that you get something better than el cheapo ECS .	St
1.3.8	LOL Just kidding	St
1.4.1	The ECS board is a pretty basic cheapo board built for stability .	St
1.4.2	Double checked manual just to be sure .	St
1.4.3	Forgot to mention pulled vid card also to see if I could get *any* beeps .	St
1.4.4	Think getting NO beeps are worse than getting error beeps .	St
1.4.5	NOT how I wanted to spend my Labor Day Weekend !	St
1.4.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.5.1	yet .	Res
1.5.2	The various X 's of AGP cards used different voltags .	St
1.5.3	Wondering if yours used the 3.3 volts that the memory also uses .	St
1.5.4	Power Supply failure [ high ] [ of the 3.3 volts could have damaged lots of things , including the CPU ] .	St
1.5.5	Hopefully the on mobo regulators for the CPU did n't let the overvoltage get to the CPU .	St
1.5.6	I 'm talking as if it was the supply .	St
1.5.7	Not really intending that .	St
1.5.8	An internal supply failure could let the voltages come up but not release the Power Go signal to let the system start the boot process .	Sug
1.5.9	So many possibilities .	St
1.6.1	And NO , I would n't know how to use it anyway .	St
1.6.2	Did pull vid card also , as mentioned in response to Bob .	St
1.6.3	Yes , I always got the the single beep before .	St
1.6.4	And YES , this ECS board bites big-time !	St
1.6.5	I HATE this board !	St
1.6.6	All hardware is back in place , triple checked the seating .	St
1.6.7	Did n't pull the HDD power/reset connectors , but they 're seated well ; if you recall , when I first got this board , I had to post how to connect the cables to the headers ?	Ques
1.6.8	10 pin connectors , 9 pins onboard .	St
1.6.9	I 'd like to shoot the designer of this board .	St
1.6.10	Biggest complaint about this board on the 'net .	St
1.6.11	Ca n't even remember how I figured it out .	St
1.6.12	Well , my guys in Chinatown are open today .	St
1.6.13	I 'm so fed up , I just may go and get a barebones Shuttle !	St
1.7.1	Good Luck whatever you choose .	St
1.8.1	just being hopeful .	St
1.8.2	I see somewhere on my PSU & quot ; 3.3 volts & quot ; but ca n't honestly say what the heck it refers to , lol .	St
1.8.3	Well , I guess I can call myself lucky after all these years of my home-made systems .	St
1.8.4	About the only piece of hardware that 's ever failed on me was FDD- twice .	St
1.8.5	Never a psu , optical drive , or anything else for that matter that I can recall .	St
1.8.6	The time I had my case open with the case fan sharing the power via a Y cable falling over and ripping out the ciruit board from my brand new 80 gig HD does n't count , I think , lol .	St
1.8.7	This has NOT been a fun day .	St
1.8.8	All I need is rain , lol .	St
1.9.1	& quot ; Poor turn off technique & quot ; LOL and then come home with a 939 64 bit XP barebones .	St
1.9.2	LOL	St
1.10.1	Unfortunately , among all my old computers laying around , no PSU will fit properly into my daughter 's case .	St
1.10.2	It 's a PSU that mounts with a hinge and 2 screws .	St
1.10.3	I could prob .	St
1.10.4	rig it so that an old psu could hang by 2 screws , but I 'd probably set the place on fire .	St
1.10.5	Will let ya know how it goes .	St
1.10.6	I have 1/2 mind of simply dragging the whole thing to the shop , but the owners are n't there where they 'd prob fix the thing for nothing .	St
1.10.7	Will let ya know how it goes .	St
1.10.8	Thanks for input , Ray .	St
1.11.1	I 've told her time and again , that the '98 system hangs at shutdown and to just power EVERYTHING off !	St
1.11.2	But nooooo , she wakes me up in the middle of the night to tell me that the pc wont shut off .	St
1.11.3	Ya 'd think a BURNING ELECTRICAL smell might signal , & quot ; DANGER , DANGER ! & quot ; .	St
1.11.4	Oy !	St
1.12.1	NIL	St
