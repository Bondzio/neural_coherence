i have already read other messages regarding to this problem.
i am thinking to buy a new graphic card or only the cooling fan.
my graphic card is win fast 128 mb px 6600gt tdh (amd athlon 64 2.21 ghz and 3 gb ram, windows xp pro sp 2 with all the latest updates)it was very noisy so i disconnected the cooling fan.
i am requesting advice about this disconnection and the possible problems i may have.
