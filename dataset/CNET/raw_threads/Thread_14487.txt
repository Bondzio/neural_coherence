It will tell you if you're having a hard drive issues. Usually noticable sounds from a drive for me is a indication of mechanical failure.

In your post at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591_7-0.html?forumID=26&messageID=2236657&threadID=209750 I would not have replied as I did if you had written it was some Ebay item. Given this information I would immediately contact the seller and ask them to explain why you shouldn't return the product. There is NO SOLUTION to this issue. It will continue to click until the drive is replaced or the source of the problem is explained. However, hard drives do make some &quot;click&quot; sounds as they operate. There are bad click sounds and good click sounds. I'll take this one is bad since you took the time to register here to make your postings. Bob
