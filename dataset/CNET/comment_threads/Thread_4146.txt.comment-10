The screw hole thing still baffles me.
I'm telling you it doesn't match up.
I know the drive is in correctly.
I would take pics but I have nowhere to host them.
Why would I need to access the BIOS anyways?
Will it cause problems if I just go ahead and finish partitioning the drive without going into the BIOS settings?
