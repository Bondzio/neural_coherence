Next thing I know, regardless of what else is in my computer nor where it is, my computer will not boot up with the soundblaster in. Even with the little crappy one taken out, still no. There are no errors or anything. Nothing happens at all on the monitor. No beeps, nothing. I can boot up fine with whatever I please in, just as long as the soundblaster's not. I hear my fans start up, but nothing happens. Help?
