I have gotten frustrated with my current printer's (Canon MX310) propensity to chew up and engorge itself with each and any standard sized envelope (business #10 size)I attempt to print. For my own sanity I wish to purchase a dedicated envelope printer. I need only black ink (I do not wish to have to purchase additional color cartridges or dual purpose cartridges). My volume is low (usually no more than 10 envelopes in one day - with an average of less than 20 per week). Any recommendations for something economical that actually LIKES printing envelopes rather than eating them? Many thanks!
