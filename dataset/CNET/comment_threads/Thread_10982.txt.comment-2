you could have a faulty cable or connection in your external box.
I use the same controller card with 2 Welland cases and off the shelf WD hard drives a 160gig about 3 years old and 1 year old 640gig without any problems.
The last Welland case cost me about $43 Australian, probably about $25-30 US.
