<s> hello i just got a windows 98se so the first thing i did when i got it was to defagment the dive c. but at 11% it said windows has found a problem and cannot continue then it said to run sandisk to find the problem. </s>
<s> so i tryed to run a though check but it keeped restarting so i decided to run a standard check. </s>
<s> so when that check was completed i attempted to defagment the drive but nomatter what i do i cant make it defragment. </s>
<s> got any suggestions. </s>
<s> Try the suggestions there. </s>
<s> Make sure to stop *any* backgrd. </s>
<s> running pgms./tasks. </s>
<s> Just shut them down or disable them. </s>
<s> Usually, around 10% these pop-up and cause an issue with defrag.. Also, be sure you have some empty HD above 10% of HD available to defrag w/o hassles. </s>
<s> try all that and use any hints/tips that Robert offered in that forum suggested as well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
