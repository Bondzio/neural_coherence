there are good antivirus systems out there, like nod32 and antivir that have good detection rates, accurate heuristics and don't slow the computer down.
i may ask, where you using norton when this experience happened?
or mcafee?
either way, like the other poster said, getting the intel mac will solve your problems, and is similar to what i am doing.
it brings two computers into one and you can run windows either on its own or you can run it side by side the mac os.
there are also antivirus systems for the mac os too, not really needed for your own safety but for the safety of others, simply to check you are not holding any viruses.
that said i am disappointed to see clamxav not out yet for leopard.
