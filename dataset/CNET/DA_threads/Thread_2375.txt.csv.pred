1.1.1	I would like to change my IDE harddrive and replace the master hardrive with an Sata harddrive.	St
1.1.2	I am just worry if there will be any thing I need to pay attention to before getting a new sata harddrive.	St
1.1.3	My motherboard is an asus tusl2-c intel815ep chip set.	St
1.1.4	I would like to set the SATA as the master drive with an adaptor and then attach and ata drive just for data storage as slave.	St
1.1.5	will I be asked to intall an driver with intalling winxp since I no longer had a floppy disk.	St
1.2.1	Yes, if you are installing XP on to the SATA drive, you'll need to to install the SATA controller driver right at the beginning of setup (press F6), from a floppy disk.	St
1.2.2	I suppose you could put the driver on to a CD-R but I have only seen reference to SATA drivers being installed from a floppy.	St
1.2.3	Not sure if XP setup would see a cd-rom drive in it's initial setup phase, other than being able to boot from it of course, which is made possible by the BIOS.	St
