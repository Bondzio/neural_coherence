1.1.1	What is the fastest CPU on the market ( that anyone can buy fairly easily ) .	St
1.1.2	Also what is the fastest prosessor for the G5 , Pentium and AMD ?	Ques
1.2.1	I am not so educated on the G5 .	St
1.2.2	However , the fastest processor for AMD is the FX-55 and its specs are 2600/1024/HTT .	St
1.2.3	And the fastest for Intel is the Pentium 4 570J and its specs are 3800/1024/800 .	St
1.2.4	As Christmas nears , Intel will release a new P4EE and we will retake the market .	St
1.2.5	That P4EE will be the fastest and its specs will be 3733/2048/1066 making for a speed daemon processor .	St
1.3.1	The fastest CPU can not run on a table all by itself .	St
1.3.2	Manufacturers of MBs must be in on it too ( and RAM manufactures also ) .	St
1.3.3	The availability of the whole package is as important as it is for a single component .	St
1.3.4	These new babies tend to be pricy and tempramental .	St
1.4.1	Athlon 64 FX-55 .	St
1.4.2	http : //www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx ? i=2249	Ques
1.5.1	The fastest chip on the market to day would have to be the AMD Athlon 64 FX55 .	St
1.5.2	It is n't as versatile as the Intel P4EE 3.6GHz chip but it wins hands down in every other category .	St
1.5.3	The lack of DDR2 however , keeps me away from the AMD chip for now .	St
1.5.4	But the boards are coming .	St
1.5.5	G5 ?	Ques
1.5.6	I have no idea , I do n't work with Macs , sorry .	St
1.5.7	-Mike	St
1.6.1	Which of these processors is the fastest for continuous maths calculations , used in programs that may take many hours to complete the calculations .	St
1.7.1	Fastest CPU is AMD FX-55 .	St
1.7.2	Intel suks now especially with the expensive price and less performance .	St
1.8.1	The AMD FX-55 is faster , but you probably have to be a spoiled rich kid , or make a pretty good wage , to buy the FX-55 from $ 816- $ 840 ( processor alone - Newegg ) .	St
1.9.1	Now the fastest CPU is the Intel Core 2 Quad Q8650 .	St
1.9.2	I might have spelled it wrong but anyways it is the fastest as of 08/26/07 .	St
1.9.3	Damn I got orientation for school tomorrow	St
