i've got an emachine t5026 with this integrated setup.
it says it supports pixel shaders 2.0, but when i try to run my 7 year old's &quot;lego star wars&quot; it won't run and gives me a mesage that it requires pixel shaders 1.1. i understand this intel gma is not a gamers setup, but &^*$@ why won't it run?
i have installed the latest drivers...
