as you have an unused IDE port available.
If no port available, there are still ways to do it.
You need to tell us all of the aspects.
You must tell us about the make of the old drive and of the new one because it is possible that the jumpering of the drive may need to be explained.
I assume that the new drive will have the operating system on it, and you only want the old drivefor files that are on it or just the additional space.
Tell us what you want to use the old drive for.
Also is it presently in a working computer, and what Operating System is on it.
