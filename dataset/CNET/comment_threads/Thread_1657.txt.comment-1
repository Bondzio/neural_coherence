Here is my situation.
Recently had my Win2k machine go bad (motherboard/processor) so I got a new machine and now I need to transfer some of the files from my old HD over to the new one.
The new machine is running XP SP2.
Will I be able to buy an enclosure and hook it up via the USB connector to my new machine and move those files over?
Like I mentioned before, the old HD has Windows 2000 on it.
I've read several threads on here concerning similar instances but haven't seen one yet that involves Win2k and XP working together like this.
Any help would be appreciated.
