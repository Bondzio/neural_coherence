i agree with the other comment about contacting an it professional.
starting a company with geographically dispursed staff will need careful planning.
i run an it consulting firm in atlanta; however, we consult with companies across the country.
i would love to speak with you to understand your specific requirements.
feel free to contact me sales@precedent-tech.com.
