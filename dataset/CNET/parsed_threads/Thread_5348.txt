<s> Greetings. </s>
<s> I was hoping somebody might be able to help me out of a bind. </s>
<s> A few days ago my computer stopped connecting to the internet. </s>
<s> I'm on an ethernet network. </s>
<s> I ran ipconfig at the command prompt to release and renew my IP, which didn't work. </s>
<s> I checked the cables and connections, as well, which were all fine. </s>
<s> The computer sees no problem with the card or the connection, and no other computer is having difficulties. </s>
<s> I also ran AdAware, Winsock, and my antivirus to cover my bases. </s>
<s> The one thing that caught my eye is on the ipconfig it says &quot;Media Disconnected.&quot; I'm not extremely network savvy, but the Windows Help (yes, I was that desperate) noted it was something I should ensure it didn't say (not that it said what to do about it). </s>
<s> For the record, I'm using Windows XP, a Netgear EN104TB ethernet hub, and a RealTek RTL8169/8110 Family Gigab Ethernet NIC, although I suspect it's software related somehow. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated, and thank you in advance. </s>
<s> I pickup WINSOCKXPFIX and run it to see if some spy/malware has been at work. </s>
<s> Hint: google.com Bob </s>
<s> Don't know if this problem is old news, but I had the same problem today and discovered very simple explanation. </s>
<s> My Dell TrueMobile wireless utility showed multiple wireless networks, but my Windows wireless network connection utility showed none. </s>
<s> So my wireless card seemed to be working fine, except that I could not sign onto any networks, and ipconfig showed &quot;media disconnected&quot;. </s>
<s> After updating the driver, deleting from the device manager and rebooting, and several others of the &quot;usual&quot; fixes, I discovered that the Dell wireless utility was checked to &quot;Let this tool manage your wireless settings&quot;. </s>
<s> Turns out the Windows utility was also checked to be in control. </s>
<s> I unchecked the Dell utility and everything immediately worked fine. </s>
<s> A quick and logical fix that should be checked before (like me) you try all the other fixes. </s>
