check your motherboard manual for what is written about dual channel configurations on that particular board.
although that is not an intel motherboard, here is what intel says about it:  if you have a 256mb module in each of the slots that makes up channel a, you would then need to install a 512mb module in channel b to match the total in channel a (if adding just one module).
of course, as shown in the above intel.com link, dual channel mode may be achieved with other configurations.
dual channel module purchase preferences: 1. purchase matched pairs tested to work together.
2. purchase exact same model numbers.
3. purchase exact same density, frequency, and timings.
