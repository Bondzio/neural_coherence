but i would absolutely not accept a monitor with any dead pixels.
it just shouldnt happen.
i once bought an lcd on the internet that had three.
i returned it and the lady told me an lcd could have up to eight dead pixels.
just ridiculous.
now i have a samsung without a single dead pixel thank heavens.
i once got a kodak digital camera that had a dead pixel on the screen.
returned it for another.
these items are not cheap, and if you can find items without dead pixels why settle for one with them.
im sorry about your pixel, but - if it were me -i would zip the monitor back to where i bought without any hesitation.
even exchange it rather than to settle for it.
the rebate thing to.
i mean id call the president of fuji if i had to.
it used to be that the customer is always right.
now, we do the big boys a favor just buying from them.
no respect for the purchaser anymore.
cheap quality, service and greed.
monitors are good to buy at big box stores just for that very reason.
id wear the place out if i had to to get satisfaction.
