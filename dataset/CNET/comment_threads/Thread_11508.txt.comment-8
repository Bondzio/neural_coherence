an inexpensive alternative would be the Netgear WGR614.
It's a wired/wireless router, b/g but it cost only $29.99 at my local Shack.
I had mine up and running w/ 3 laptops and two desktops within 2 hrs.
(OK, so I took the long route and maybe did some browsing to 'test' the connection) and there hasn't been a hiccup yet.
Netgear stuff is fairly solid (IMHO) and I couldn't beat the price.
