<s> Thinking about going wireless with my home pc and xbox 360. </s>
<s> But not sure which type of router to go with. </s>
<s> I read the g is the standard, a is good for streaming video and music. </s>
<s> Which is exactly what I want to do, stream from the pc to the xbox 360(mp3 and video). </s>
<s> Any suggestions on which type of router and some suggested brands if you don't mind. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I don't run into 802.11a equipment anymore. </s>
<s> I wouldn't consider it something to fret over. </s>

<s> So is .11g good enough to stream music and video from my pc to xbox 360? </s>
<s> Remember that most internet connections are less than that. </s>
<s> Certainly music is fine at 802.11b and more. </s>
