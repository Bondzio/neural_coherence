1.1.1	I want to buy a used mac that has PC software compatability , that has acceptible freedom from freeze-ups , that will serve my needs for printing of digital camera photos and other relatively simple graphics -- and does n't cost much beyond $ 400 .	St
1.1.2	What would you suggest ?	Ques
1.2.1	LOL !	St
1.2.2	Oh , goodness .	St
1.2.3	Okay , you want a Mac that is compatible with M $ , rock-solid reliability , and cheap .	St
1.2.4	Sigh .	St
1.2.5	M $ compatibility has come a long way in recent years .	St
1.2.6	So you want a fairly recent Mac that can run OS X.3.6 .	St
1.2.7	Which requires a good bit of RAM to run well .	St
1.2.8	Yet , a used Mac might come with OS 9.2.2 .	St
1.2.9	Which was not quite rock solid , no .	St
1.2.10	And a used Mac might not come with enough RAM .	St
1.2.11	OS X should have a minimum of 256 MB .	St
1.2.12	And of course , you 'd have to buy OS X for the used Mac .	St
1.2.13	It 's not free .	St
1.2.14	OS 9 could be reliable enough if you were willing to limit the third-party stuff .	St
1.2.15	Now , I always added stuff to 'trick out ' my Macs .	St
1.2.16	But I used a brand-new Mac some years back and was surprised how fast it was running .	St
1.2.17	And realized that it was faster BECAUSE it was 'stock ' , not 'custom ' .	St
1.2.18	Which led me to understand that all the software gadgets I was running were each cutting out their own slice of processor power .	St
1.2.19	And reliability too !	St
1.2.20	The more stuff you add to OS 9 , the more likely it will crash occasionally , especially while running Web Browsers , for some reason .	St
1.2.21	But adding extra goodies to OS X is much more reliable .	St
1.2.22	So , what do I recommend ?	Ques
1.2.23	You can watch for a deal on a used iMac .	St
1.2.24	With OS X , 256 MB of RAM at least .	St
1.2.25	Or you can buy a used iMac , then buy more RAM , buy OS X.3.6 , and end up with something almost as good as buying a new eMac .	St
1.2.26	If you can handle the installation of RAM yourself , that is .	St
1.2.27	The eMac is the all-in-one low cost Mac Apple sells for education .	St
1.2.28	It goes for about $ 799 or so .	St
1.3.1	by PC software compatible do you mean run PC software titles ?	Ques
1.3.2	If so than you need to adjust your needs .	St
1.3.3	Mac 's cant run PC tittles , they can run MS office if that 's what you mean .	St
1.3.4	If you still want a cheap quality Mac than look for a used iMac 300mhz or better ...	St
1.4.1	A Used G4 Quicksilver with OS 10.3 , Microsoft word with Vitual PC would meet your needs , software is a bit pricey .	St
1.4.2	( I know of a G4 that is getting ready to go on the market )	St
1.5.1	Why would he need Virtual PC to run M $ Word on this used Mac .	St
1.5.2	There is not enough information given to help this person out .	St
1.5.3	What exactly is meant by PC Compatibility ?	Ques
