I know a 128MB thumb drive costs more than that. But with much less storage. Since the new HDs have USB ports and cables, doesn't it make sense for me to download hundreds of movies to an HD and then attach it to my large screen TV's USB port?

If as you say, there would be USB ports as well, then having a flash drive at later date would come in handy. I won't get into any DMR issues, but hundreds of movies appears to be a lot. Wouldn't a large DVR box, do? As we seem to state here often enough, any storage to a ext. HD isn't keen for long term storage, though it may do for now. The point being &quot;storage&quot; for any length of extended time, as ext. HDs tend to fail for whatever reason and/or become problematic. Which is why, it's also stated repeatably enough to store discs of CD/DVD/BD types. Now, you decide. tada -----Willy
