I think I will have to replace the drive. But first I just wanted to see if this in a common problem, that could be a bug in software.

You didn't note what machine (PC/Mac/Other?) this was in, the OS and more. I could guess and guess badly that the CD doesn't automatically play and for some that could be a problem.
