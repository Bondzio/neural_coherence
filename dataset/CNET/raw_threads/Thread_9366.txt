I have also ordered a new SATA 750 GB Hard drive from Seagate. I presently use Vista Home Premium. My question is: Can I load an Upgrade version of Windows on a new hard drive? Can I load my Office XP and Expression Web2 upgrade versions on the empty hard drive? I know that Microsoft upgrade programs require conformation of ownership of a previous version. My thought is that I could keep my old hard drive installed under another letter, and when asked for proof of previous version, I could direct the Microsoft program to the old hard drive. Is that what I would do? Do I have to fool with the BIOS with this SATA drive? What else would you suggest for a &quot;clean&quot; install? Thanks... Ken

I remember that when I installed it on the disk containing my Window XP, it searched for the previous version (proof of ownership). If I start with a new hard drive, the program won't be there for verification. I just ran into a case where my old Microsoft FrontPage had a problem. I uninstalled it, and tried to install from scratch. I couldn't do it because it was an update version, and I did not have the disc for the Windows 98 FrontPage.

I have the disc for Windows Vista, and the disk for Expression Web. I believe that is all I need to register those programs on a new drive. The reason for me not wanting to mirror my old drive to the new one is because of all the junk that accumulates after time. I did a mirror copy when I upgraded from Windows XP to Vista, also with a new drive. When I loaded Vista, I didn't select &quot;clean install&quot;, so a bunch of crap was left on the new drive. Now I want to get a good start with Windows 7. I still have one more month to worry about getting it to work. Thanks... Ken
