the pads are there to provide a uniform contact surface between the hsf and cpu.
you do not want to use a cpu without them.
i would not assemble an athlon based machine without heat compound or the tape, its cpu suicide without it.
try reducing the number of parts down to power supply/hsf/cpu(with compound)/onboard speaker.
see if you get a beep.
in addition you might want to take the board out of the box and try it on a peice of cardboard, you might be shorting out somewhere.
