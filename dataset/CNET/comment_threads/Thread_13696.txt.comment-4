There are many fine discussions about old power supplies, BAD CAPS and more.
When I fit a replacement supply if there are no reasons to really pump up the Watts and amperes (as if they added a powerful video card), I'll look at the existing PSU, add 50 to 100 Watts to the old PSU wattage rating.
Further checks for size, connections and amperes are done.
We want the same or more amperes per rail of the bigger PSU.
