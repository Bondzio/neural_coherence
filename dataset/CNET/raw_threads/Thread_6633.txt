Ive been searching online for TV tuner cards but as I keep searching I really dont know what to buy. So I turn to you, hoping you can help me with these questions: - Can you recommend a good affordable TV tuner card for my desktop? - What are the pros and cons of internal and external TV tuner cards? - If I get a USB tuner card, will my system support it? - I assume the cards come with their recording software, but is there any other software that you can recommend? thanks

Even if you had PCI slots, which I question as if you do, the software would not run on that old of a platform. Same with USB. If you wish to do that kind of work, you need a machine with more under the hood. Many newer computers will be set up to do that and have the necessary equipment built in, if you want to spend the money.

I was just wondering if there was by any chance any old tv tuner card that could still be available for my pc. thanks for your reply.
