after three full days of no outages (after moving it to a ventilated location), yesterday afternoon three times it went out briefly--about 10 minutes at a time.
i was just about thinking that this was taken care of.... ok i'll just see how this goes for another few days.
like i said, i have little faith in charter's tech support telling me anything but &quot;the line is clear from our end.&quot; that's all i've ever heard from them in the past, as well as aol in the early years of internet.... if i can live with a short spell of outages i'll just bite the bullet...if it gets too annoying i'll get a replacement model and see if that won't do the trick.
