Some of us &lt;giggles&gt; OLDER users are just getting into this new century and updating things.
Anticipating a new system configured as follows -- would GREATLY appreciate any input from ANY of you out there: &lt;Thanks!&gt; ---------------------------------- Black ANTEC TX-640b case w/ 400 SMART power prob 2 add'tl Zalman SILENT FANS) ASUS A8N-E (939 socket) PCIe OCZ Performance DDR 3200 (2x512 d/c) Copper 2-3-2-6 ASUS nVidia GF EN6600TD (256) graphics card AMD Athlon64 3200+ (1.40 w/ 1GHz FSB) Seagate Barracuda/SATA 160GB w/ NCQ NEC ND3540A (black) (really just watch DVD movies) Princeton Prototype LCD 21 (2480x1920) ----------------------------------- Current thought for CPU cooler is Scythe Ninja 1000 silver fin Heatpipe Tower &lt;&&gt; NOT SURE about upgrade for Northbridge chips yet --- I'm sure I need to learn a bit more before making THAT decision !
Only additional add-on is a custom designed BOEING PCIe-4X Firewire card (Reasonably sure SOMETHING out there will work better w/ FIREWIRE so ... better now than later I thought) !
