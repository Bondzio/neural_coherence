in most cases as yours, replacing the psu with a good one of equal wattage or *better* is the 1st step in a repair process.
however, it maybe possible the mtrbd.
or another compoent has failed.
the fans, etc.
turning on only suggests that at 12v is working, there are other voltages and likely one rail(v-outputs) has failed or been stripped of the amps it needs to turn things on.
the clue is repeated attempts may get the system going.
the mtrbd.
may have a failed capacitor(cap) that blown or leaked, etc.. a user can reduce the power demand by reducing the system, thus a possible clue if it boots-up.
that's no cure it just points int he right direct, replace psu.
