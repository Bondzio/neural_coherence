The computer should be able to handle HD video and multitasking, no gaming, maybe some video editing, and I want something the will not be obsolete in at least 7 years. Here are links to components I have selected: Case- http://tinyurl.com/43pfv5f CPU- http://tinyurl.com/3k75fsk Motherboard- http://tinyurl.com/3t9glpr Graphics Card- http://tinyurl.com/3ttpurj Power Supply- http://tinyurl.com/3wuw64n Heatsink- http://tinyurl.com/3zuwjgc Any suggestions? What kind of optical drive should I get? What can I do to save money? How much RAM and HDD do I need? Any compatibility issues? Thanks for your time!

I have made some recent changes: Motherboard: http://tinyurl.com/3ecfs9h Optical Drive: http://tinyurl.com/3bq8qow USB 3.0 Card: http://tinyurl.com/3mt397p I want the desktop to be able to handle 1080P movies (blu-ray or not). Should I still go for a cheaper mother board with built in graphics? Also, is the stock heat sink enough? The case comes with 2 fans but I was thinking of adding another. What do you think?

IMO If it's 32bit it doesn't matter , I personally like amd chips because the onboard graphics is radeon based and I like the force options for resolution , but anything ~ 2-3 ghz processor and 2+ gb ram would be sufficient for what you require ! If it's 64 bit IMO I go with an amd 64 bit dual core ~ 2-3 ghz and 2gb ram.... Iknow alot of ppl like intel but I like and notice the extra cache per cost on amd You can shave more $$ if you rethink your needs and cost.

Do you think the build in graphics will handle 1080P movies well? Thanks
