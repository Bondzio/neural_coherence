Did some research spoke to some techs, was adviced on buying an enclosure kit which would allow me to use my old hard drives as files/media back up & my DVDROM/CDRW cud be used to copy media onto my new DVDRW in the same kit. I had one slot for memory empty on my new pc so I pushed in the old one on the other slot. Looking forward to donate the motherboard, Nvidia Ti Geforce 64MB & P4 processor. Hope this helps.
