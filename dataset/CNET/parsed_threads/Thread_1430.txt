<s> I hope someone brighter than me has a solution to this very annoying problem--which appears to be evolving. </s>
<s> I first got a message from XP as follows: Cannot complete the cd writing wizard There was an error in the writing process. </s>
<s> The disc you have attempted to write may no longer be usable. </s>
<s> I followed the standard troubleshooting techniques to no avail. </s>
<s> The writer is a ''Philips CDD5301 / H1.1'' and is listed in device manager. </s>
<s> I decreased the speed to match the CD-RW speed, confirmed that burning is ''enabled'', and ran ''services.msc /s to ''start and automate'' the IMAPI CD burner. </s>
<s> Interesting thing here is that it seems to stop at some point after I start it (not, though, when I try burning). </s>
<s> I may have deleted ''record now'' and therefore installed a newer version (Sonic Record Now) without success. </s>
<s> I also reinstalled Media Player 10 just in case. </s>
<s> Finally, I attempted to update the Philips driver to a more recent one, but that doesn't seem to work either. </s>
<s> Now, I'm not even getting the error message from the CD writer, but it just seems to lock up when I ask it to ''write these files to CD.'' </s>
<s> The message remains the same, ''there is no disc in the drive, please insert a writable CD.'' </s>
<s> I tried removing the drive from the Device Manager and reinstalling without success. </s>
<s> Finally, for FYI, I have not ''reset the drive cables to the optical drive'' nor have I ''cleared the registry filters''. </s>
<s> I was hoping to find an easy solution that I could simply download and updated driver or something. </s>
<s> If anyone could please point me to a solution, I would be greatly appreciative. </s>
<s> Otherwise, I guess I'll be forced to purchase and install a new drive, though I have no experience doing so. </s>
<s> Thanks and regards! </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=kb;en-us;324129 While the above may or may not resolve it, I suggest tossing out XP's native recording which you can also read more at http://www.aumha.org/win5/a/xpcd.php that &quot;Some CDs burned by Win XP cannot be read. </s>
<s> Microsoft has acknowledged various problems with the inbuilt software that can result in files (or sometimes whole disks) being unreadable when they have been burned with the inbuilt software. </s>
<s> See MSKB 320174. </s>
<s> They have posted a patch on the Microsoft Download Center...&quot; I'd use CDBURNERXP from download.com and let Microsoft keep their problems. </s>

<s> Thanks for the insight. </s>
<s> Does this mean that my problem is limited to the s/w and that my cd-writer remains OK? </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> You would have to try CDBURNERXP and see. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I tried everything and seem to have a compatibility problem. </s>
<s> I wind up with a 5 ASC: 30 ASCQ: 0 error which, when researched, appears to indicate some sort of compatibility problem. </s>
<s> I suspect my Philips CDD5301 needs replacement. </s>
<s> Any final thoughts on other troubleshooting techniques or resources for resolution? </s>
<s> PS. </s>
<s> the link referred me to the same troubleshooting I tried earlier and the new s/w doesn't solve the problem either. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> I can't tell what that means given so little a story from you about what you used to get that error. </s>
<s> I'm also unsure if you used CDBURNERXP and tried it with new media at 1/2 the rated speed. </s>
<s> Also suspect is the drive's firmware (never revealed) and if you used a cd/dvd lens cleaner. </s>
<s> The lack of details leaves me with little traction on this one. </s>
