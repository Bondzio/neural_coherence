K...
I changed the heatsink paste and have been running my computer with the side off.
At this point I'm positive the damage has been done already.
I'm not really optimistic about a quick fix.
Now, I just want to figure out what needs to be replaced.
I talked to someone about it, and he said it's most likely my CPU or my Motherboard.
He said it also could be my RAM(I have 2 512mb sticks) I took one out and it still happened, then switched them and it still happened, so I don't think it's my RAM.
If anyone has any easy ways of testing my CPU, power supply, or motherboard, anything would be appreciated.
