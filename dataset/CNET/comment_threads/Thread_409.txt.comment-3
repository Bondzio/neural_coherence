I was able to play CDs even yesterday.
If the laser is gone then it would not have played CDs' also right.
It also displays the DVD menu for some DVDs' its only that when I click the PLAY button nothing happens.
Also when I open the Sony provided DVD Player software &quot;Media bar&quot; I hear the DVD spinning and then the DVD spinning stops and the play button on the software gets disabled.
Does this suggest any other type of problem like software on my computer etc ?
