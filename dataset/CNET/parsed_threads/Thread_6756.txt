<s> Have older IBM Thinkpad with insufficient memory. </s>
<s> Using Win XP, with Excel and Word (have eliminated all data files), and Norton 360. </s>
<s> Constantly getting virtual memory notices, and insufficient drive space to perform updates. </s>
<s> HD data indicates drive is full. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend the several hundred dollars for a complete new, larger hard drive, and don't have the provision for copying all the executable programs from the old to the new anyway. </s>
<s> I thought about getting a 1G SD card with USB adaptor and moving all the programs to it-in essence using the SD drive as my permanent drive. </s>
<s> A local computer repair center said this wasn't possible, but I would like a second opinion. </s>
<s> I am using this PC with a wireless card to primarialy check e-mail, but don't want to delete the Excel/Word/Norton stuff to free up space. </s>
<s> I ran such on 4GB so with XP it is possible. </s>

<s> In addition, I eliminated a large HP media file.In the process of doing this, Norton 360 (which said updates exceeded my capacity) basically deleted and re-installed. </s>
<s> I also found a program (Lenovo Hard Drive Quick Test) which now shows the following results: Drive capacity 18.63 GB- Buffer 1.70 GB- volume capacity- 14.39 GB, used capacity 13.44 GB. </s>
<s> Since the above actions, I haven't been on that PC much to see if the problems have been eliminated, but if the above figures are accurate, I now should have adequate memory for my purposes. </s>
<s> RAM memory- per BELARC analysis shows 64 kilobyte primary memory-primary and 512 kilobyte secondary. </s>
<s> Would replacing the 64 kilobyte be advisable? </s>
<s> That memory space sounds like what a CPU has for cache so let's just say no. </s>
<s> I have three of these http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148073 I used this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817121006 to clone the small hard drives to the 160s. </s>
