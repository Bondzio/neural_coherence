Starting with a Chromebook I can get a lot done ( http://www.howtogeek.com/161662/living-with-a-chromebook-can-you-live-with-just-a-chrome-browser/ ) and then I can find laptops for about the same price as many tablets. A notable exception is the Kindle Fire HD which we get lots of us as a video player (Amazon Prime, etc.) and it's not much. Bob
