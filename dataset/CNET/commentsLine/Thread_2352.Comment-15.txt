&quot;edward&quot; is in the ceo office for quality control and told me today that i am only the 2nd person to complain of a f1503 blackout!!
(???)
so, let's all call edward at 877-917-4380 ext.79 he was actually a very nice sounding person... i emailed hp ceo mark hurd and said that if someone doesn't try to rectify this ongoing problem, a class action law suit was in order.
i refuse to buy another new monitor for $350+!
