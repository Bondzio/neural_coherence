1.1.1	I have an MSI Wind netbook , with ( I thought ) 160GB HDD , but when I clicked on My computer properties , it says C : 39GB D : 106GB .	St
1.1.2	A message came up saying I had minimum space ( or something like that ) on the C : Drive .	St
1.1.3	I have 88GB free on D Drive .	St
1.1.4	C : has programmes on it , D : also has some programmes , and all my data .	St
1.1.5	I have XP Home SP3 .	St
1.1.6	The hard drive was already divided when I got the computer , and did n't realise everything was going on to the C Drive , until a friend advised me to put the data on D : Can I increase the size of C : with an SD card , ( there is a slot on the computer ) ?	Ques
1.1.7	If so , when I put the card in howcan I link it to the C Drive .	St
1.1.8	Also when I look at the computer properties it lists & quot ; Memory Card on EP4695a4 & quot ; ( Z : ) but I do n't know what this means , or where it is .	St
1.1.9	The only connections I have on the netbook , are the Ethernet wire slot , monitor connection , headphones and microphone connections , 3 USB ports , SD Card slot .	St
1.1.10	Can anyone enlighten me please ?	Ques
1.2.1	If we eat too much , we need larger clothing .	St
1.2.2	If we buy larger clothing , we need bigger closets .	St
1.2.3	If we fill thee closets , we either get rid of something or find other storage space .	St
1.2.4	You can invest in a larger hard drive up to the capacity that your hard drive and budget can handle and you can clone the old drive to the new .	St
1.2.5	You can buy an external drive but that takes away some portability convenience .	St
1.2.6	You may be able to merge the two drive partitions but that has its downsides as well .	St
1.2.7	I 'd start with the larger drive option and you can keep the original for either overflow storage or in case of disaster .	St
1.2.8	Ultimately , you get to work out the plan of your choice that fits your needs and finances .	St
