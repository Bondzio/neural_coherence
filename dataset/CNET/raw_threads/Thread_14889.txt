You'd be better off finding a cheap PS2 keyboard. You might check with a local PC builder to see if they could offer you a used one for a couple bucks.

When it does, the keyboard or mouse CAME WITH THAT thing. Here's a NEW PS2 keybaord that will work fine with the old gear. http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Wired-PS-Keyboard-Black/dp/B0007SXGJW There are plenty others out there. Bob
