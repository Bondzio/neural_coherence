involved includes the placement of the wireless router.
1) if it's placed very near a wall, signal, even to a room just behind that wall, will be severally affected (as my brother had complained often) 2) the number of walls between the router and the room.
the more walls between, the faster it drops signal (more so if the wall has steel bars for structure) 3) height of placement is also important.
placing too low on the floor also can affect, likewise placing too high up.
4) power saving set on your wireless adapter and router.
