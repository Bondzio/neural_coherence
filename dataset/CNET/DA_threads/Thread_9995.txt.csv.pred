1.1.1	Hi , Just wondering about the pros & cons of the Vista upgrades that are offered by the stores if you buy a new PC right now ?	Ques
1.1.2	If you buy a Media Centre PC , it comes with a free upgrade to Vista Premium .	St
1.1.3	Sounds like a good deal , but I discovered that the upgrade will be in the 32bit format , not 64 bit ...	St

1.3.1	No I do n't think so .	Res
1.3.2	having just gone thru .	St
1.3.3	the upgrade application , they made a point of saying the upgrade would be the 32 bit as opposed to the 64 bit version ...	St
1.4.1	32bit is the way to go for Vista in the new future .	St
1.4.2	64bit drivers will be barebones until the hardware manufacturers catch up .	St
1.4.3	MS will allow you to switch to 64bit for a small fee ( probably $ 25 ) .	St
1.5.1	problems getting drivers for anything yet .	St
1.5.2	I 'm running an ASUS A8N SLi Deluxe with an AMD4800X2+ , an ATI 850XT PE and 2GBs RAM .	St
1.5.3	Biggest problem I 've had with XP Pro 64 is compatible SW and there certainly should be more 64bit or 64bit-compatible SW coming soon .	St

1.6.1	The big thing with the new Vista 64 bit version will be security .	St

1.6.4	Read or listen all about it at the link below ... http : //www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm # 71 Look for the Vista security file with Leo & Steve , it 's very interesting .	St
1.7.1	Lets put it this way ; until service pack 1 comes out I would not change .	St
1.7.2	Little to no software is even able to run on Vista and what is out has been thrown to gather to get it out the door .	St
1.7.3	Remember XP when it first came out .	St
1.7.4	I would give it 6 months after it is out before I would even look at upgrading .	St
1.7.5	Yes , Vista is the newest and bigest thing in years from Microsoft , and Yes I think it is a move in the right direction .	St
