14381	0	108737	1238462	NR	charger10s	6/11/05 10:11 PM	1.11852786E12	Need advice on build and choosing case and PSU	I am in the process of planning my first build and I could use some help. I am not a gamer, but I will be using my PC primarily video editing and encoding. I do not need lots of serious mod components (water cooled, neon fans, etc) nor do I plan to overclock in the immediate future. I could find lots of info on CPUs, motherboards, video cards, etc that has helped me make my choices there. However, there are so many types of cases, from super cheap to super expensive, I'm not sure where to start. I don't need any of the serious extras (neon lights, acrylic cases, windows, etc.), but I don't want a generic whitebox either. As far as the PSU, how much power is really needed? Are the PSUs that come with cases often junk? Should I try to purchase these components separately? Here is a summary of my future build so far: - AMD Athlon 64 3200+ Winchester Integrated into Chip FSB Socket 939 Processor Model ADA3200BIBOX - Retail ~ $190 - MSI K8N NEO2 PLATINUM Socket 939 NVIDIA nForce3 Ultra ATX AMD Motherboard - Retail ~ $128 - ATI ALL-IN-WONDER 9600 100-714116 ALL-IN-WONDER Radeon 9600 128MB DDR AGP 4X/8X Video Card - Retail ~ $137 - CORSAIR ValueSelect 1GB (2 x 512MB) 184-Pin DDR SDRAM DDR 400 (PC 3200) Unbuffered Dual Channel Kit System Memory Model VS1GBKIT400 - Retail ~ $80 - NEC 3520A DVD Burner ~ &lt;$50 - Case ???? - PSU ???? Thanks for your help!

There isn't as much a difference between Pentium and AMD as some of these hardcore games would like you to think. The speed gap for different tasks are actually very small anyway, and makes no real difference in the end. If you find a good deal on AMD processors, don't just ignore it because Pentium is supposed to be faster at video compression/decompression. And another thing, don't get an extra sound card. Some of these Creative cards cost around $200! Comeon! It makes absolutely no difference if you're editing digital audio or video. Actually, it makes no difference even if you're just listening to it...

When AMD went from the 130 NM chips to the 90 NM chips the power went down from 80 some watts to about 67 watts. The Intels dissipation didn't go down one Iota. Notice that the Intel dual core using 2 P4's can't run at the speed that the one P4 could, simply because it consumes too much power. There's a great article in Tomshardware giving details. The Intel at idle consumes as much power as the dual AMD at peak. The socket 939 will support the Dual for future upgrade. The dual Intel will require a different chipset. I wonder if the slight superior video editing performance warrants forgoing the gains one gets with the AMD 939 Winchester. Not saying that you are wrong, simply food for thought. Maybe dragon will straighten him out. LOL

On rendering test the P4 if faster by a few seconds and the credit is given to the SS3 instrucion set and now AMD has it. John
