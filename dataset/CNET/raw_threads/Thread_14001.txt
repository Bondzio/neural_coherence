But within 2-3 months I am upgrading to an AMD 64. Can I upgrade to the fastest Ram I can so I can transfer it to the new machine and still use it for tha AMD 2000? Thanks, Tom

Go to crucial.com, input new system and see what memory it will take. Input your old system and see if it's compatible with new system. If so, buy the fastest RAM upgrade and temporarily install in old system for future transfer to new system. I wouldn't mix slower RAM with faster RAM in your new system, though. Buy the fastest memory for new system. Leave the slower RAM in the old system.

Brand can be diff, but it's best to have a pair of the same brand
