well, almost.
if sound is coming from the pc speakers then it's set wrong.
try under playback devices (control panel, sound), chang default from speakers to hdmi audio.
as to the screen sizes, that's all about video mode settings.
i can not offer any exact answer.
but you should try other video modes.
