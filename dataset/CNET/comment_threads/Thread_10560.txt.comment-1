I want to reformatt my windows as i am having a lot of problems with it recently.
I did purchase another internal drive for it.
When installing the other internal harddive, i had to install software before i could use it.
If i reformatt my drive, would it recognize it right way?
Its a 160GB harrdrive with very important stuff in it.
I need to know if it can recognize it after the reformatt of the 80gb harddrive it came with.
Info: eMachines 3882 Segate 160gb hdd
