I don't think the speed or timings are the problem.
I tried reinstalling my old RAM, and I also got BSOD while trying to download GW2.I ran memtest and it came back with approx.
7k errors.
I ran memtest with new RAM and I got 40k errors on first pass.
The BSOD I was getting before was irql_not_less_or_equal, now I am getting pfn_list_corrupt stop 0x0000004e.
Also, my computer would work for hour or two, but as soon as I would try to download something (the only thing I actually tried downloading was GW2) it would get BSOD.
