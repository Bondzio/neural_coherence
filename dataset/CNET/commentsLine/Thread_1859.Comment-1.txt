hey everyone, newbie here.
it all started when i tried installing visual studio .net for a programming class i'm taking.
at first the installation was going smoothly but then it slowed way down.
it took 10 just to copy small files and the cd drive sounded like it was struggling.
after 3 hours it was only 25% done and still copying files.
so i stopped it and tried to just copy the cd image onto my computer.
the same thing happened.
it copied fast at first but then slowed down and then all of a sudden it just stopped copying and it looked like explorer quit.
i tried using a different ide cable then a different cd drive but the same thing happened so it might be the computer.
i wasn't sure where to post this but i hope someone can help.
