Basically I need it for documenting patient history and physical exams The template would be something like this: chief complaint: (a few words) History of present illness: (a few sentences) Past medical History: (words) Etc Some portions would look like this with checkboxes: ()hyperthyroidism ()hypertension ()diabetes ()cancer ()CHF ()pneumonia ()etc ()etc ()etc I was hoping to find a program for a tablet so its less &quot;cold or rude&quot; when doing patient interviews to be typing while interviewing and yet still be able to write it out while I'm actually talking to the patient otherwise I can be left with several patient notes to write several hours later that will take several hours to do versus getting them done on the spot but I am starting to think what I'm looking for doesn't exist yet, or that it won't work as well as I need it to.
