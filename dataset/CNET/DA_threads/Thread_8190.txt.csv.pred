1.1.1	I have an old HP Compaq Presario Laptop ( Sempron-CPU ) which has an ATI Mobility Radeon express series 200 graphics card .	St
1.1.2	XPHome SP-2 .	St
1.1.3	I have a driver dated Dec/2005 ( 8.202.0.0 ) for it , and is the latest , as far as I know .	St
1.1.4	I have located an Newer & quot ; AMD Catalyst & quot ; driver , which indicates that their driver supports my Graphics card .	St
1.1.5	Since ATI is AMD now , my guess is that it may be OK .	St
1.1.6	I hate to guess about things like this , and am just inquiring here .	St
1.1.7	Can anyone verify that the Catalyst drivers are OK with my old laptop ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	and if a newer driver for your Radeon card is posted on their support site , it should be safe to use .	St
1.2.2	These are coming as the Catalyst suite or just the driver .	St
1.2.3	I never get the full suite .	St
1.2.4	What you 'll want to do is read up on what 's been fixed or what new features have been added that you 'd find useful .	St
1.2.5	If you 're having no known video problems that have been addressed or find no features that are important to you , you 're well enough along to leave things as they are .	St
1.2.6	If you want to go ahead and install the new driver/software anyway , do n't delete the old driver .	Sug
1.2.7	Occasionally bugs are created as well as fixed .	St
1.3.1	Thanks , for the good advice .	Polite
1.3.2	This was my first inquiry about it .	St
1.3.3	Best to do some research , on my part , before jumping on it .	St
1.3.4	Will try to post back with any success .	Sug
1.3.5	Thanks , again .	St
