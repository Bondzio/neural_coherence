place only by thermal tape.
the only heatsink fan i had to replace was on an asus mb which suffered from early fan failure and asus took forever to make replacements available.
i replaced the failed factory unit with a passive heatsink (zalman zm-ng47j) which used pushpins to hold it in place.
bottom line, i would be very reluctant to buy or use any chipset hs with passive or active cooling that would only be held in place by tape ... especially for use in a tower case.
guess you could use an epoxy thermal compound but later removal would be much more difficult if not impossible without damaging the mb.
