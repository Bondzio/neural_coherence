i'd say you may need a switch, router and an ap.
this depends on where your cable enters the house and your modem is placed.
the basic connection sequence will be pc to switch to router to modem to outside cable.
the switch will connect to one lan port on the router and all wired devices can connect to it or other free ports on the router.
ip addressing from the router can pass through the switch.
since you want the major hardware in the basement, your wireless radio device should probably be an ap.
the ap can connect to the switch or a free port on the router.
in this case, your router doesn't need to be of the wireless type but might be handy if you bring a laptop into the basement.
two wireless radios do add extra steps, however.
you said you need 20 ports.
you'll find switches that offer 16 and 24 ports so you'll go with 24. the four on your router add two more for a total of 26 possible terminal connections as one switch port and router port will be connected.
if you want to go gigabit capable, you'll need to make sure that your switch and wiring are proper.
in wall wiring should be cat6 (though cat5e may work) and so must patch cables to all devices capable of that speed.
the router speed won't matter and neither will the ap as these only provide wan connections and you won't see gigabit to/from there.
hope this helps.
