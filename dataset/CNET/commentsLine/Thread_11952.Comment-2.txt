when you use ocr software you can expect about 99% accuracy.
that means 1 error every 2 lines, with good copy.
if it is not good copy results can be a lot worse.
trying to ocr columns of text can be painful, as the software will try and do things automatically that may not work well with columns, unless you intervene.
when you scan for ocr you usually want to use 300dpi, 400 for small letters but higher resolution is not necessary for ocr.
the thing is, you have not really describe any problem, you have given us no clue about what is going wrong, or what results you need to improve.
