hello there i'm new here, my name is daniel and i have a question for you: i currently own an e-machines t3256, with this specifications: windows xp home sp2; 2.2ghz amd athlon xp 3200+; nvidia nforce-2 chipset; 512mb ddr sdram 333mhz; 64mb (shared memory) integrated geforce4 mx; wdc wd1600bb-22gua0 160gb 7,200rpm so i would like to play this games: quake 4 and doom 3 on it, but just the demo of doom 3 makes an awful performance on it, so i would like to know what would be the recommendations to upgrade my system to make this games very enjoyable on it.
i know for a fact i have an agp port, and as i saw a graphic of it, it can take up to 8x agp video cards, and the memory maybe i will have to change it to 1 gb of ram?, but still i haven't made a decition, i could use a lot of advice on it, btw i can invest like 300-400 $ to upgrade, any suggestions?
thx.
