<s> ok, I just set up 2 new computers in a small office setting. </s>
<s> One of them (which I want to use as my server) is running Vista. </s>
<s> The other is running xp. </s>
<s> I plugged everything in and to my suprise they were all talking and things were great. </s>
<s> After I installed a few things: -Avast free version -Microsoft office -All the windows updates for both computers -And I changed the users on both to one admin with a password and one restricted guest with a password. </s>
<s> Now I cannot log onto the vista machine from the xp machine. </s>
<s> It sees the computer in the workgroup list but the box just blinks when I type in the user and pass and press ok On the other end, the Vista machine sees the xp, but when I click on the icon it says that windows cannot access..., check the spelling etc. </s>
<s> Any help would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> That's where it looks to have failed. </s>
<s> Work back to where it worked. </s>
