1.1.1	I have 3 ram slots , I have one 1gb stick of ddr ram and two sticks of 512mb ddr ram , my computer works when i put the 1gb stick and one 512mb stick in , it says i have 1.50gb .	St
1.1.2	but when i try to add the last stick of 512mb my computer does not boot up .	St
1.1.3	I installed a program called sisoft to check out my motherboard to see the max amount of ram that can be installed and it says 2gb , I also have tried adding one 256mb of ddr along with the 1gb stick and one 512..but still will not boot up .	St
1.1.4	The motherboard i have is the & quot ; ASUSTeK P4PE & quot ; I am sure every stick i have works , i have tried each one individualy .	St
1.1.5	The 1gb stick is dobule sided DIMM .	St
1.1.6	One of the 512 sticks is also double sided DIMM .	St
1.1.7	The last 512 stick is single sided DIMM .	St
1.1.8	But the computer boots with either of the 512mb sticks along with the 1gb stick .	St
1.1.9	does anyone know whats wrong ?	Ques
1.1.10	= (	St
1.2.1	One of the 512 sticks is also double sided DIMM .	St
1.2.2	The last 512 stick is single sided DIMM .	St
1.2.3	I think these need to be an identical pair to work & quot ; together & quot ;	St
1.3.1	While you mention the MB size of the memory , its important to know what class & type the memory is .	St
1.3.2	If they differ too much of amongest the total of the ram installed you have computability problems not to include the system itself .	St
1.3.3	In the system , the bios must be at its latest level as it *may* correct or help in this regard .	St
1.3.4	The RAS and CAS rating of the ram are part of its make-up so if they differ , expect problems .	St
1.3.5	One way I look into the make-up of a ram module is to use Everest Home Edition , gotten from some download file service , like www.download , com or www.majorgeeks.com or similar websites .	St
1.3.6	Once installed and used , find the differences of ram installed and proceed from that .	St
1.3.7	It usually makes sense to have very similar memory installed , besides Mb sizes .	St
1.3.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Therein lies the answer .	St
1.4.2	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	I believe this has been answered for you ... but I am no expert .	St
1.5.2	what you have is mis matched .	St
1.5.3	either all 2 sided or all 1 sided ... it 's a conflict .	St
1.6.1	you can only install 3 single sided ram , if you install a double sided in slot 2 you must leave slot 3 empty as slots 2 & 3 'share the same rows'.so you can have either single or double sided in slot 1 with either 2 single sided in the remaining 2 slots OR 1 double sided in slot 2 with slot 3 remaining empty .	St
1.7.1	What you have is a timing problem .	St
1.7.2	It is likely that you have a newer stick that is too fast for the slower 512mb stick .	St
1.7.3	Without seeing the specs on each stick it is hard to say exactly which one has an issue , but it sounds like the newer one is causing the timing problem .	St
1.7.4	Count of the chips on the stick should not matter .	St
1.7.5	Look each stick of memory online to see the specs and that should help you determine what is the conflict .	St
1.8.1	Your motherboard only supports memory with speeds up to 333mhz .	St
1.8.2	Now , if each of the sticks works individually , then that is the test to see if each is at or below this limit .	St
1.8.3	Memory Matching : It is not advisable to install memory of different speed/type/size in any one machine , much less paired slots .	St
1.8.4	When I advise freinds ( or build systems for them ) I always make them buy new RAM .	St
1.8.5	Why recyle those old POS sticks ?	Ques
1.8.6	To save $ 20 ?	Ques
1.8.7	A 1gb stick of value priced RAM can be purchased for less than $ 60 .	St
1.8.8	2x2gb for less than $ 160 .	St
1.8.9	There is no excuse for cheap RAM .	St
1.8.10	Or maybe your MOBO 's fried/bad socket .	St
1.9.1	I had the same experience when replacing a 128MB RAM in slot 2 of an Intel 810 Chipset with a 256MB RAM in the same slot 2 .	St
1.9.2	PC would not boot with 256MB chipset .	St
1.9.3	Removed 256MB chipset and PC did boot with the existing 256MB chipset in slot 1 , slot 2 empty .	St
1.9.4	PC also would not boot when I inserted the original 128MB RAM in slot 2 .	St
1.9.5	PC manufacturer said my PC would only hold 256MB RAM .	St
1.9.6	Intel website said capacity was 512MB in two slots .	St
1.9.7	Intel website suggested upgrading BIOS .	St
1.9.8	Since Intel no longer supported the 810 Chipset I had to go to a second party provider for $ 40 .	St
1.9.9	Upgraded BIOS allowed the PC to boot with 512MB RAM .	St
1.9.10	A side benefit was improved performance from the PC with the new BIOS .	St
1.9.11	About six months later I reinstalled Windows XP which deleted everything from the hard drive to clean up the computer .	St
1.9.12	Low and behold the PC booted with 512 MB RAM without the new BIOS .	St
1.9.13	Apparently when I had the original problen adding RAM something happened so that the slot 2 RAM was causing a conflict .	St
1.9.14	Go figure .	St
