Its the motherboard that dictates the speed your ram runs at not the ram.
Ram described as 1066 means it is capable of running at that speed in a suitable MB not that it will run at that speed in any MB.
There is a free application called cpuz-144 that will tell you what the bus frequency of your MB is, Ram rated speed should be equal to or greater than the bus speed of the MB.
