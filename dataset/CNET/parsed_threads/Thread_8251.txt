<s> I currently have a PC, and am buying a Mac Mini. </s>
<s> Since there are a lot of things that I will still need my old PC for, I have decided to keep it. </s>
<s> What I would like to know is whether this set up will work: First of all, I would like to share files between the computers with an Ethernet cable. </s>
<s> Then they should both be controllable with one keyboard and mouse. </s>
<s> For that I will be using Synergy, a free program that lets you do that without special hardware. </s>
<s> The computers will also have to work with one monitor. </s>
<s> The monitor has both a VGA and DVI port, I was thinking that each computer could be connected to one port. </s>
<s> (PC -&gt; VGA, Mac -&gt; DVI) Will this work? </s>
<s> Also, if it will, is there any way to use both computers at the same time by splitting the monitor with some program? </s>
<s> I have a HP display and to switch video inputs I press some button on the display twice. </s>
<s> For the keyboard and mouse I use some USB switch. </s>
<s> But since you are going with Synergy you may not need that second part. </s>
<s> I wonder why you don't use some remote desktop software. </s>
<s> Ok, SPLIT SCREEN is the clue that you might want to have both computers on screen at the same time. </s>
<s> The answer is NO. </s>
<s> No that will not happen without some expensive hardware that costs far more than a second display. </s>
