Ok, so i have my system but only thing i dont have is RAM/ Memory.
Would you guys help me to consider which memory to use for i have no clue.
Memory these days are becoming more sufisticated &gt;_&lt; & the range is so many.
My motherboard is ASUS M2N-E CPU is AMD 3600 1.8GHz Dual Core (soc AM2) VGA Card is nVidia 7950GT 512MB I need preferable 1GB.
2x 512MB would be fine but yeah prefer a 1x 1GB.
Work, i do is multimedia nd graphics, as well as keeping me entertain with gaming.
Sorry for the long drought of my &quot;pc life&quot; haha but yeah any help would be much appriciated.
CHEERS =] questions r welcome.
