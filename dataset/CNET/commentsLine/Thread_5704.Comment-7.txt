even though the wgt624 v3 model just hit the stores, it may have been boxed months ago.
take a look at the firmware on netgear.com.
it looks like there is a &quot;version 1.0.128_1.0.1&quot;.
it was published on 15-sep-2005 and includes 12 bug fixes.
on the other end, download the latest driver for the wireless network adapter.
hope this helps!
