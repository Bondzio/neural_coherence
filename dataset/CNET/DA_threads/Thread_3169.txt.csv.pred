1.1.1	I realize that this is not exactly a computer issue but here goes.	St
1.1.2	I'm using an old computer power supply to power quiet 12 V cooling fans for electronic equipment in an entertainment unit.	St
1.1.3	I am running 3 120 mm fans that draw 1.4 W max.	St
1.1.4	with a 200 W power supply.	St
1.1.5	I have 2 old PS's, the oldest has a switch that will turn it on and off but has a noisy cooling fan.	St
1.1.6	The newer PS has a quieter fan but won't turn on (I'm guessing) without a signal from the motherboard; it worked OK before I removed it from a computer.	St
1.1.7	My question is two part; can I disconnect the cooling fan in the older PS since I'll be using less than 5 W of power total without overheating the PS?	St
1.1.8	Alternatively is there a way to &quot;jump&quot; the newer power supply so that it will turn on without the motherboard connection?	St
1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	can I disconnect the cooling fan in the older PS since I'll be using less than 5 W of power total without overheating the PS?	St
1.2.2	YOUR CHOICE!!	St
1.2.3	But from what I see in most designs the heat output at low loads is still too much for the PSUs to run without a fan.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I'd think the newer supply fan could just be powered by the same 12v used for the others with a little rewiring.	St
1.3.2	My guess is this one might be thermally controlled and that's the reason it doesn't come on when the 12v comes up.	St
1.3.3	Unless you just want to use what you have and not spend a few extra bucks, I'd look into something like this.	St
1.3.4	http://www.trcelectronics.com/12-volt-power-supplies-low-external.1.shtml You can get 12v dc supplies that are small and can handle a few light duty fans.	St
1.3.5	You still need a little creativity to adapt them but it sounds like you're not short on that.	St
1.4.1	To power up an ATX or ATX-2 PSU for testing, short pin 14 (PS_ON) with one of the grounds.	St
1.4.2	See here: http://pinouts.ru/Power/atxpower_pinout.shtml	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the help.	St
1.5.2	That seems to work well	St
1.6.1	I just read your post and this also worked for me.	St
1.6.2	I need to take a power supply and use it to run my fans in a cabinet that houses my network equipment thank Jeff ACS	St
