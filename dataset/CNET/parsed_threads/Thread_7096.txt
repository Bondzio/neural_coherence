<s> I really like the way my computer is setup, but would like to get more speed from it. </s>
<s> I am running Windows Vista home premium. </s>
<s> I have started a little shot and burn wedding photography business and my AMD 64X2 4200 cpu and 2 gig of ram is a little on the slow side when doing 500 or 600 pictures in Photoshop and would like to speed things up if possible. </s>
<s> If I were to replace the motherboard,CPU and go to duel channel DDR2 memory would I have to format the hard drive and re-install windows Vista, the drivers and everything that goes with it? </s>
<s> I also plan on upgrading the power supply from the 300watt that is in there now to a Antec 550watt. </s>
<s> I have a 7600GS video card, so I think that should be OK for what I am doing. </s>
<s> Price wise it comes out cheaper than buying a new system. </s>
<s> Any advise would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks Wayne </s>
<s> I would have gone for the C2D but as it stands you are running an app that can use the noted /3GB boot switch so try that even before adding ram. </s>
<s> The video care you have is fine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am not familiar with the /3GB boot switch? </s>
<s> This that RAM? </s>
<s> Also the reason for the new motherboard is mine now is a socket 939 and I can't do much more with it as far as upgrading the CPU. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> I read several articles on google and think I will pass on the /3GB switch and prefer to do the upgrade. </s>
<s> Back to the original post. </s>
<s> If I replace the motherboard, CPU and Ram will I have to do a clean re-install of Windows Vista? </s>
<s> Thanks Wayne </s>
<s> Typing XP CHANGE MOTHERBOARD SAVE OS finds the usual articles. </s>
<s> Try changing the XP to the VISTA and see if anyone is having luck at this. </s>
<s> Sorry, this is something I have yet to do. </s>
<s> As to the /3GB switch, I'd learn about it since when you go past 2GB your OS won't use the 3rd GB without it. </s>

<s> if you've got an am2 socket mobo and use ddr2 ram, then you can go from 2.2ghz to a 3.0ghz x2 6000+ for $155 and go to 3GB ram for about $35. </s>
<s> photoshop makes use of a scratch disk if you edit large (or many) files. </s>
<s> you can speed up photoshop by adding a second harddrive and using it as the scratch disk (move the windows pagefile and temp folders to it also). </s>
<s> assuming your pc uses sata drives, a fast 500gb drive is only $105 . </s>
<s> this would be a $295 upgrade that would give you a big boost in overall performance and take only 30 minutes or so. </s>
<s> My motherboard is a socket 939 and I have very few choices of faster CPUs that I can use. </s>
<s> The MSI manual says I can go up to a 64x2 4800, but I have looked at Tiger Direct, Newegg and a couple others and can't find one. </s>
<s> Also the MSI motherboard can only use DDR 3200 memory and not DDR2. </s>
<s> Bob: Thanks for your information and I think the first thing I will do is add another gig of ram and do the /3GB switch and see if that helps. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
