1.1.1	So after 6 years of ownership of a now sluggish and ancient Dell Dimension e520 , I 've decided it 's easier to run a clean install of Vista to boost performance rather than bother with uninstalling programs , etc .	St
1.1.2	My question is , should I still use the 250 gb Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 hard drive that came with the system ?	Ques
1.1.3	Or am I rolling the dice by doing a fresh install on a drive that old ?	Ques
1.1.4	I bought a new WD 1TB 7200 Caviar Blue to add as a 2nd drive for storage , but now I 'm wondering if I should use it instead as my primary drive and use the 6-year-old drive for extra storage .	St
1.1.5	What do you all think ?	Ques
1.2.1	If you had no real issue with your old HD , then do as you plan , use *it* as extra storage .	St
1.2.2	Using the new HD , install it using the s/w that came with it or the support website of s/w you get free .	St
1.2.3	That way , you can swap data over from old- & gt ; new HD and need n't do a fresh install .	St
1.2.4	Of course , you can skip that and do a fresh install , then use only the new HD .	St
1.2.5	Just run it for several weeks and decide if you want to add the old HD .	St
1.2.6	However , if you get an ext .	St
1.2.7	USB case that accepts that old HD , you can go that route .	St
1.2.8	The whole idea of swapping data from old to new , is you will need to get all the updates , etc. , to complete the install if a freshly done one , but that 's up to you .	St
1.2.9	Your new HD guide or manual to include any visit to support website should provide details on all this .	St
1.2.10	I tend to install data to new HD alone and run it for awhile , maybe a month or more .	St
1.2.11	keeping the old HD as a safeguard of data stored in a safe place .	St
1.2.12	That way should it boo-boo , you have your old HD to fall back on on that date .	Sug
1.2.13	Again , that 's all up to you .	St
1.2.14	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	That 's solid advice -- thanks for your help !	Polite
