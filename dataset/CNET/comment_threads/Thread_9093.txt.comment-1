I need to add some extra IDE discs to my server but already have 3 and a CD drive in it.
If I buy a seperate PCI IDE controller, will it work alongside the existing one in the motherboard allowing me another 4 drives or will there be a conflict?
I've had a look around various web sites but can't find anything that answers this question.
Thanks,
