<s> Hi guys: I have this new motherboard ECS KT600-A I purchased a couple of days ago with 1 Athlon XP 3000. </s>
<s> I installed a piece of 512MB DDR3200 400MHZ but it will not start. </s>
<s> It boots and flashes the bios part where it recognizes the CPU but at that instant it shuts itself down. </s>
<s> I removed the piece of memory and of course it will not boot but it does not however shut itself down (it remains on). </s>
<s> I thought it could be a piece of bad memory but I grabbed a 512MB DDR2700 which supposedly it's supported by this MoBo but yet it does the same thing: it shuts itself down after displaying the kind of CPU it has. </s>
<s> Could it be a wrong set jumper of some sort. </s>
<s> I memory form ULTRA and they say it's 100% compatible. </s>
<s> Could it be the CAS latency of this memory? </s>
<s> the MoBo manual says it does not support other than 2.5 CAS latency. </s>
<s> What should I try next? </s>
<s> Thanks guys </s>
<s> call place of purchace let them tell you use warrenty </s>
<s> CL [CAS] 2 will run at 2.5 if the mobo only supports 2.5 Not sure that the shuts down/not shuts down is a clue. </s>
<s> AMD CPU's don't shut themselves down, the mobo detects the overheat signal from the CPU and shuts down. </s>
<s> I do not think that the mobo shut down function can work without memory. </s>
<s> I would worry that your CPU is getting too hot too fast and explore that entire area before powering up again. </s>
<s> Of course I could be totally wrong, even incorrect. </s>
<s> LOL </s>
<s> Too Add AMD heat sink is notched. </s>
<s> Double check that it is installed correctly. </s>
<s> Also check that heat sink fan is pluged into the correct port. </s>
<s> Also look at capactors for leakage or crowning. </s>
<s> Ray System only appears to be running w/o memory. </s>
<s> You will see the fans running and if speaker is attached a beep code will be heard. </s>
<s> M/B, most models, will detect CPU over heat and shut down the system. </s>

<s> would work without memory. </s>
<s> I have little faith in the AMD mobo shutdown systems. </s>
<s> They can vary widely based on age and type of CPU and MOBO. </s>
<s> Thanx, mountain top man. </s>
<s> LOL </s>
<s> Two different versions [1 and 2] of Soyo mobos and one PC Chips [three of them] simply do not beep. </s>
<s> They do have the pins on the mobo for a speaker, the &quot;normal 4 pins. </s>
<s> Some give the signal name for three of them, one of which is Vcc. </s>
<s> All of the cases I am using only provide a little cylindrical gadget [assume that it is a speaker] with the two outer pins wired. </s>
<s> Have tried moving one of the outer pins to the third slot, still never get a beep. </s>
<s> Have no idea what a third wire for a speaker is for. </s>
<s> [BTW, also have tried speakers removed from older cases]. </s>
<s> &quot;little cylindrical gadget [assume that it is a speaker] with the two outer pins wired. </s>
<s> Have tried moving one of the outer pins to the third slot, still never get a beep&quot; What is being moved? </s>
<s> Some boards do have speakers attached permanently to themself, haven't seen one that could be moved. </s>
<s> Model and make of board? </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> they run two wires from the speaker to a small four pin connector that plugs onto the pins on the mobo in the area of the front panel stuff. </s>
<s> All that I have seen, and have here only have two wires, the other pins empty. </s>
<s> BUT some have the wires on pins 1 and 3, others on pins 1 and 4. </s>
<s> [that's why I move one of the pins to try both configurations. </s>
<s> These mobo manuals give designations to 3 of the 4 pins, one being Vcc. </s>
<s> Makes zero sense to me. </s>
<s> BTW I know that the little cylinder is a speaker because I heard one work in some devicw some time ago. </s>
<s> The manuals for these mobos make no mention of beeps or beep codes, and I really miss that beep at startup. </s>
<s> LOL [also get no beeps for error configutations ie no video] BTW, the &quot;speaker comes with the case, not with the mobo. </s>
<s> sounds as if the mfrs may not be talking to each other. </s>
<s> I had a question for Soyo and they responded in two daysm well written. </s>
<s> I guess that I'll have to ask them. </s>
<s> I made a prior post about that subject. </s>
<s> Hope that you Floridians are finished getting attacked by nature for a while. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
