1.1.1	Why does my WD800JD not show as Sata .	St
1.1.2	Device manager shows only Intel 82801EB ultra ATA storage controllers When I loaded XP and pressed F6 and tried to load Abit Sata Installation Disk V1.33 ( didnt get a floppy with the board ) Xp wouldnt load it .	St
1.1.3	I read ( at http : //forum.abit-usa.com/showthread.php ? s= & threadid=77346 ) I didnt need to load any drivers because the motherboard uses ICH5 not ICH5-R .	St
1.1.4	In the bios I have the onChip ide controller enabled and set to auto and the onChip Serial ATA set to enhanced ( also tried auto and sata only ) .	St
1.1.5	In this configuration the Sata 1 is to serve as IDE-3 master with controller 1 and 2 enabled and the hdd does show as 3 .	St
1.1.6	Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2 ( build 2600 ) 2.80 gigahertz Intel Pentium 4 Board : Abit IS7 ( Intel i865-ICH5 ) Bus Clock : 200 megahertz ( onboard 2 channels SATA 150 mb/s with raid function via ICH5R south bridge BIOS : Phoenix Technologies , LTD 6.00 PG 11/23/2004 WDC WD800JD [ Hard drive ] ( 80.02 GB ) -- drive 0- running dma 5 512 Megabytes Installed Memory Intel ( R ) 82801EB Ultra ATA Storage Controllers	St
1.2.1	The SATA drives will show as SCSI drives if you have an Intel ICH5-R and you load the Intel RAID drivers by pressing F6 during Windows install .	St
1.2.2	These drivers are for running RAID Arrays and will not work with the ICH5 because it does not support this feature .	St
1.2.3	The drives will show as Intel 82801EB ultra ATA and run at DMA 5 which is normal because these are the drivers that Intel/Microsoft supplies with the OS ( remember that SATA came out after Windows Xp and most other OS 's ) .	St
1.2.4	Also most SATA I drives are just PATA ( IDE ) drives with an SATA interface added to them ( basically like adding a PATA to SATA adapter to an IDE hard drive and connecting it to the SATA connector on the MB ) .	St
1.2.5	edit : from abit forum	St
