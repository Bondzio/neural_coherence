1.6.1	is standardized ( 5.2V , 500 mA , that 's 2.6W ) .	St
1.6.2	So any device suitable for USB power should n't have blown the power supply ( that 's 30W or 40W for the netbook ) , especially if you dimmed the screen to have that use less power .	St
1.6.3	Maybe they were defective and something short-circuited ?	Ques
1.6.4	Is there anything in the documentation from Acer about maximum power the USB can safely deliver ?	Ques

1.6.6	Then you have the specs for your speakerset .	St
