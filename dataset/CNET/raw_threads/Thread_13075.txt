Will an Antec 350w case with ps be enough to power an amd 64 3000+, dvdrw drive, geforce fx 5200? Which would be easier to set up ide or sata hd. If i had just the dvdrw on its own channel would i set it to slave or master and if i decided to go with an ide hd would i put the two on the same channel or on different ones and if they were on the same which would be slave and master?

Antec I would trust, and lite-on, yeah maybe I'd trust them too. But an alternate solution would be to buy a case without a PSU, take the money you save on that, and buy a PSU of your choice. That's how I always do it. and the 350 watts is kinda low for your hardware. Definetly go higher, it never hurts. Hehe, if you can get an xp 3000 i dont think an extra 50-60 will hurt? then again maybe im wrong.
