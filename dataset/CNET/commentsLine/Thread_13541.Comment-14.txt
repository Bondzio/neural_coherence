i have this old other machine that did the same.
after much going around in circles i got lucky and a nvidia card was freed up at the office.
for that machine it cured it.
but look at power supplies like your car.
your car might go 120mph but let's say you go 100. now while it can go faster you will experience issues at 100 and the occasional failure much sooner than say at 65 over the same number of miles.
some don't get that the same thing happens with power supplies.
my longest lasting and least trouble machines had about double to more watts than what they needed at any time.
i'd still head for the driver version they did those tests at because its ati... bob
