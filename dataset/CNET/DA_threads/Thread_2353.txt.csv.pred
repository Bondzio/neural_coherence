1.1.1	OK , I have an issue that I 'm not sure how to solve .	St
1.1.2	I live in college apartment where the building provides internet access with one network jack in every room .	St
1.1.3	In the living room we set up a Netgear wireless access point with DHCP turned on so all the hosts on that network have a private IP address ( IE 192.168.1.5 ect ... with a subnet of 255.255.255.0 ) In the bedroom we have a Netgear gigabit switch which has no web interface , it simply splits the bedrooms private IP address assigned by the apartment into 3 IP address ( IE 172.17.105.68 for my roommates computer , 172.17.105.162 for my computer and 172.17.105.59 for my HP printer .	St
1.1.4	They are on the subnet 255.255.252.0 ) The 172.17.105.___ is the block that my apartment uses .	St
1.1.5	My problem is that I am trying to access the files on my PC in my room on the switch using my Mac in the living room with the wireless access point .	St
1.1.6	How can I go about accessing these files without putting them online and being able to print from the wireless to the hosts on the switch ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks for any help .	St
1.2.1	It may be you need to make a route but there is some machine that hands out the 172 range .	St
1.2.2	You would need to learn a lot more about TCP/IP routing but the simple answer is no .	St
1.2.3	But look up GOTOMYPC and similar for solutions that avoid learning about networking .	St
