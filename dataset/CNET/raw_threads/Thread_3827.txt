432	0	248556	2491529	NR	BigChiz	5/20/07 9:08 AM	1.17965208E12	Replacement antenna	I have the Safecom SWBR-5400 found [URL=&quot; http://www.dealtime.co.uk/xPF-eBuyer-Ebuyer-54mbps-Wireless-Cable-DSL-WI-FI-Broadband-Router-4-port-802-11G&quot;]here [/URL] which works fine wired to my PC & Xbox 360. But I'm getting a new laptop soon & I'm going to have a problem as the router never came with an antenna as I bought it off a mate. The router's downstairs & my laptop will be upstairs & I've already tried my mates laptop & it obviously had weak signal without the antenna. So I'm hoping to buy a new antenna for it but can't find a site anywhere that sells antennas specifically for this model.

Can anyone help? If I can't find one that fits it, it'll mean I'll have to fork out another 30-40 on a new router when I know this one works fine bar the antenna problem.
