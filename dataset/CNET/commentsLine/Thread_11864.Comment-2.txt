sorry, but what you said was very confusing to me.
here is what should happen.
you need: 1. your two computers, each with some kind of network card(your first with a wired and the second with the wireless) 2. one dsl modem 3. one wireless router with an internal switch.
[i believe you have both 2 and 3, although it would help if you included more info as to the model numbers] sounds to me like you might have the remote computer somehow getting its internet connection through a &quot;host&quot; (your wired) computer.
this is not what you need.
when setting up the network make sure you have it gaining access to the internet through a &quot;residential gateway&quot;(your router).
run the wizards and configuration cds included with your router and cards.
this should help.
if you include more info about os, models, etc.
we can help you a little more.
