Both are setup on Client for microsoft networks.
Share/permissions are setup, and I have a username/password setup for my ME machine.
However, I can't access the laptop.
I've tried going to start &gt; run and using every combination of user name, password, machine name I could think of, but no go.
Am I trying to access the laptop incorrectly?
I can't see it on my network at all.
Maybe it's a ME thing, which wouldn't surprize me.
Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it.
