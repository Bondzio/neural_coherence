with epson they are necessary and, for the most part, work very well.
just note there are several versions out there as epson continually updates their smart chips, so be sure you get the right one.
(personally, i've never been a fan of epson printer quality, though.)
for hp, cannon, and lexmark, though, such devices or software packages are often difficult to find and, in truth, frequently scams.
the little 'tricks' of covering specific contacts on the ink cartridge before reinserting in a certain pattern haven't failed me yet.
however, the 'tricks' still do not enable you to use a cartridge past its expiration date.
