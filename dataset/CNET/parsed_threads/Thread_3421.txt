<s> Help me I'm desparately in need of help here, I have received a bootable copy of Windows 64 on a DVD. </s>
<s> Im so eager to try it out, but the prob is I cant get it to boot in my system. </s>
<s> No this is not a problem with the DVD , cos I tried it in the morning and it worked then ! </s>
<s> ( meaning it booted into the Windows setup 'bluescreen' ). </s>
<s> Since I dint have time then I thought I'd install it later. </s>
<s> But in the eve when i popped the DVD into the Asus DVD Writer it didnt boot at all. </s>
<s> My system is like ignoring the drive completely at startup and going into the Hard drive for booting. </s>
<s> I tried with the Windows XP bootable CD that I used to setup XP on this machine and nor does it boot with that CD now. </s>
<s> But previosuly it was working fine. </s>
<s> Im sure this is some settings gone off in da BIOS, so could someone help me in giving the correct settings. </s>
<s> No matter how much I change the boot priority ( from Hard drive to CDROM in the first boot device ) it doesnt work. </s>
<s> I tried resetting the BIOS nor did it work then. </s>
<s> I disabled RAID and that wudnt help either. </s>
<s> The biggest mystery is that altho the drive is ignored at startup it is detected in Windows and Im able to run the DVD ( altho Im unable to setup Windows 64 within Windows , cos Windows XP is a 32 bit environment ) My MoBo and config are : Gigabyte GA-k8nf-9 motherboard, AMD Athlon64 3000+ ( 1.8 GHz clock ), ASUS 16X DVD Writer, 1 Hitachi 160 GB SATA drive 1 Maxtor 120 GB ATA Diamond Plus drive </s>
<s> It appears to be one of those things that fail with age. </s>
<s> Did you check to see if ASUS has a firmware update for that drive? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yea I have done a firmware update and NO this aint an old drive. </s>
<s> It's jus 1 month old and was included with the first AMD system I built. </s>
<s> But the mystery is the 2 IDE drives dont get detecetd at all when POSTing ( meaning they dont appear on the screen with their names ) but at times they DO ! </s>
<s> When I first built my system and wanted to install Windows, I think I had truble here too and I cant remember what I did to get it work. </s>
<s> And yesterday when i wanted to give a try with the BIOS again I started the PC and then it showed the 2 IDE drives at POSTing and when I went into the BIOS the 2 IDE drives were there with thier names under &quot;Standard CMOS Settings&quot; but when I restatrted the PC ( without saving chnages to BIOS and exitting ) then it did not show the names of the 2 drives at POST ! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Swap the drive out. </s>
<s> You may have found a dud. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Latest machine BIOS. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Don't skimp on the machines PSU. </s>
<s> Try monster size. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Swap with master/slave positions. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Change the 1st boot device to DVD-RW (or whatever you have on there) disconnect the 2 hard drives, change the jumper to master on the DVD Drive and after putting the DVD in boot the system. </s>
<s> If it picks up then you rule out the drive or DVD being a problem. </s>
<s> If it doesnt work try to flash your BIOS to a newer version. </s>
<s> Long procedure but the process of elimination is a no fail. </s>
<s> Good Luck... -Ciao </s>
