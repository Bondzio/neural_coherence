security system...
Yes there are people might trying to hack (Its a given by nature) IMHO, as part of a Big reputeable company such as Seagate, they can be trusted, they must have their system protected in such a way (something like protecting someone website or domain, etc.)
And with that reputation, they won't play around with the risk of being sued by their customers.
So, please read and reviews the policies... And you should have back-up of your back-up anyway...
I don't think anyone can give a firm opinion on a question like this.
Cheers and have a nice weekend..
