<s> I have a 16G San Drive, and the extra programs installed in it are absolutely infuriating. </s>
<s> Are there any large USB thumb drives around without that trash in them? </s>
<s> 16gb, no extra programs...at least not that I recall. </s>
<s> If it had any, I simply deleted them. </s>
<s> In any case, why not simply delete the programs on your flash if you don't want to use them? </s>
<s> Last year I bought one of those Cruze Micro flash drives with the U3 software. </s>
<s> Simply reformatted it to wipe out the US software which was a waste of time. </s>
<s> All flash drives can be reformatted to be &quot;plain jane.&quot; </s>
<s> So far as I can tell, the extra trash is in RAM and cannot be erased. </s>
<s> The extra stuff is in &quot;ROM&quot;, not &quot;RAM&quot;. </s>
