I just finished building my pc and everything works; power switch, fans, LEDs, you name it.
I connected the monitor to the graphics card using HDMI to DVI respectively, and I get no signal on the monitor.
The CPU LED is also constantly on red.
I'm 100% certain the CPU is put in right.
It is an AMD Phenom II X4 3.4ghz.
Is the BIOS on the motherboard compatible with the cpu?
Do I need a new motherboard?
The motherboard and cpu are both socket AM3+.
I'm also using an SSD, which I know is working because of the LED inside.
