1.1.1	Hi : I have purchased a Webcam ( Model No & quot ; SN9C103 & quot ; make Tevion ) in last year .	St
1.1.2	This Webcam was working perfectly fine with Windows XP operating system loaded on my old laptop .	St
1.1.3	I changed my laptop , which has & quot ; Windows Vista & quot ; pre-loaded on it .	St
1.1.4	Now I am trying to install this Webcam on the new laptop and it is not getting installed .	St
1.1.5	During installation , I am getting a message & quot ; Not enough storage is available to complete this operation & quot ; .	St
1.1.6	Can anybody help in installing this Webcam ?	Ques
1.1.7	Warm Regards Chandrashekhar S. Joshi	St
1.2.1	http : //www.sonix.com.tw/sonix/product.do ? p=SN9C103 I had some trouble tracking this down .	St
1.2.2	It is not a Vista driver .	St
1.2.3	I hope this is the brand name/Manufacturer for this Web Cam .	St
1.2.4	Of the few sites that did list some form of driver for it , none said they had a driver for Vista .	St
1.2.5	Seek out the manufacturer of this product and see if the driver is available from there web site .	St
1.2.6	I had the same problem with a web cam and the simplest solution was to get a new one .	St
1.2.7	Also , I have McAfee site advisor on my computer and I do n't believe I 've ever seen so few sites reviewed or so many yellow warnings then I had on this search .	St
1.2.8	Where did you get that thing ?	Ques
1.2.9	There certainly in a bad neighborhood .	St
1.3.1	Download & install this driver .	St
1.3.2	It worked for me .	St
1.3.3	http : //www.trust.com/products/product_detail.aspx ? item=14383 & section=drivers	Ques
1.4.1	Hi Cris : Thanks a lot for helping me out and sending the link .	St
1.4.2	Downloaded the drivers on the link given by you .	St
1.4.3	But they do not work .	St
1.5.1	The 1st & 3rd driver on the list did n't work for me either , but I tried the 31 bit one and it worked immediately .	St
1.6.1	that other guy gave that drivers for it are available .	St
1.6.2	The part number should be listed on the WebCam or on the driver CD/DVD , if not check the settings program within all programs .	St
1.6.3	Some times drivers are n't created/designed correctly so they do n't work .	St
1.6.4	Contact this site for assistance .	St
1.6.5	One last note try totally uninstalling the driver before you install those available from this site .	St
1.6.6	This will provide a & quot ; clean & quot ; install of the driver .	St
1.6.7	Over wrighting them sometimes causes trouble .	St
1.6.8	A question do you like the webcam when it works ?	Ques
1.6.9	How is the HiRes ?	Ques
1.6.10	Is it really clear ?	Ques
