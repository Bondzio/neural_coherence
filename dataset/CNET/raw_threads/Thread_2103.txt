I have several and while I never rely on just one copy of my stuff anywhere, I do like the convinience of using these devices. I am curious though, about the differences, if any worth mentioning, of using one of those cheap &quot;enclosures&quot; that accept an internal 2-1/2 or 3-1/2 inch drive. I have already had one that wasn't cheap just die on me. So, I picked up a real cheap plastic dock that allows you to just slide the HD in a slot on the top. Really handy for quick changes and testing. I dropped in the HD that I had in the external enclosure that failed and was able to read and copy from it instantly. I have to wonder whether there is a known problem with these kinds of devices and if I should phase them out of use in my multi-drive back-up ritual. They seem like they do the same thing but after having a good one just quit, I am a little leary.

But like	anything ... it depends on use, handling, quality, etc., If you insert them and remove them constantly .... quality and durability really count. If you leave them in place but power off the drives when not in use, that reduces wear and tear on the device connectors. Good quality frames and removable drive trays should last a good long time and serve you well with careful use and handling. VAPCMD

But it doesn't even have a model number on it so it's not that great. I had a good Hitachi SATA 80 drive in it and I used to use it as part of my backup routine. I never had to touch a cable as I would do as you said and just &quot;turn it on&quot; by pressing a power button when ever I wanted to do a backup. Other than that, I really hadn't move a wire or cable or touched the drive because you have to dis-assemble this one to access the drive. And I was reall happy with it till one day, shortly after the warranty I'm sure, it just wouldn't turn on. Then I tried everything I could think of. Another drive in it, removing and using different cables, and I finally decided that the unit was bad. That really surprised me because it actually gets very little use and I expected it to last a lot longer. Maybe it was just one of those freak things. I just thought I would ask and see if anyone else had problems with that type of unit.
