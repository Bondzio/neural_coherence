It is connected wirelessly to a new Linksys wireless router. The other laptops in the house work fine (XP). When I go into the 'Network and Sharing Center' in Vista, the center icon which denotes the network says &quot;Identifying...&quot; and stays there most of the time. Every now and then it changes to &quot;Multiple Networks&quot; but then switches back to &quot;Identifying...&quot;. It very rarely displays the correct SSID. We updated the wireless adapter driver with no change. Any suggestions would be welcome.
