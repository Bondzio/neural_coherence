I have an ABIT mobo with onboard sound, but I find it to be very noisy, and it's increasingly frustrating.
I was thinking of getting a good sound card for my PC, which is primarily for gaming, and I was wondering what some good recommendations would be.
I had a Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 Platinum a good while back, but it was the absolute worst sound card experience of my life.
Has Creative straightened out their driver situation any in the past few years?
Or might there be another brand to consider (not holding my breath on that one &gt;_&lt;)?
Thanks much!
