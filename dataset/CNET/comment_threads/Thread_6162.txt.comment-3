Because you have a HP Pavilion system, you need a true fit or match.
While you can find replacement psu of larger wattage, it will be expensive for the reason mentioned.
HP does offer larger psus for sale if they still have them in stock.
Just be sure whatever replacement psu you do get is HP compatible and what the return policy is if a mistake is made.
Understand typical generic psu won't work in the HP system unless you're lucky due to tje physical size and shape of the psu in question.
Google HP replacement psus online.
As for PCPowerandCooling, they're very expensive but darn best quality you can get.
