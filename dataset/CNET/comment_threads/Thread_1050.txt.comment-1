Hey all I need some help.
at work we are trying to put 2 computers in the same room, the room has only one port, and since we are renting our space from a larger company they don't want us putting a router or anything else up that would hide a PC behind its own IP.
So I was thinking of maybe a switch or hub?
Are they the same?
And do they create there own IP?
Thanks Lee
