i'm a newbie to wireless.
i'd like to access a network via laptop.
i'd be using two different laptops, both of which are wireless enabled.
the main requirement is security.
i've read a number of posts in this forum.
it appears that the most popular router brands are more or less equal, and that the purchaser should take the time to update them and set them up properly.
beyond that, if security overrides all other considerations, what steps should i take to maximize security?
