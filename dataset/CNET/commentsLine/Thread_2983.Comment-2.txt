could be several things including heat build up, make sure your fans, especially cpu are functional.
do you get any beep tone errors prior or during freeze up?
many times, depending on the system, that can or may be an indicator.
pull the side case off and watch the fan function, especially cpu.
if the fan lugs or drags, it is time to replace, hope that is all it is, meanwhile, good luck!
