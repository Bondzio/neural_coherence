if you went with the x1600, x1800 or new x1900 aiw's, you would have to replace it (my hp 1250n has a 300-w ps which works fine with a 6800gs but i wouldn't try higher than that...7800/x1800's require like 450w ps).
the x800 aiw shouldn't need a ps upgrade but it couldn't hurt.
i just wouldn't want a card that old when newer ones aren't much more expensive!
i believe you can watch one and record another but i haven't tried it yet (no tuner yet on my media center pc lol).
as far as the ps upgrade itself, hp uses more standard sized ps, unlike dell which is notorious for customized ps setups (try a standard ps and watch your mb fry)
