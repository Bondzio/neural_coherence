i just ordered a new dell notebook which i should be receiving in about a week or so.
it has built-in intel pro/wireless 3945 802.11a/g mini adapter.
i'm leaning towards getting a netgear router but would also consider a linksys.
i'm currently on a linksys wired router befsr41 (about 4 or 5 years old).
any particular model i should get?
thanks, charlie
