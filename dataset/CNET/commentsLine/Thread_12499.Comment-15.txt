a good computer should easliy last 4-5 years without a hardware repair.
be sure to get a name-brand computer.
500$ sounds too cheap for a serious computer, though best buy has a name-brand desktop for 400$ mail order.
the power supply should not go bad any time soon.
i suspect you're buying cheap, no-name computers with a cheap ps.
i suspect the tech you talked to couldn't find a good fault and gave you a stock answer.
weren't there power supplies out a while back that were under-rated?
these were third-party, but some might have gotten into a few low-end computers.
the only maintainance needed would be to blow out the insides, not vaccuum.
get a can of canned air and blow out the dust with the computer off and not warm from usage.
maintain a good back-up.
get a s.m.a.r.t.
progtam to monitor your hd, though bear in mind you'll get all sorts of ignorable warnings.
when it says your drive is about to go, get a new hd immediatly.
use the old one as a backup.
if you have pets, put the computer where any fur won't get sucked in.
finally, one of my pet peeves: &quot;this is how i found out about the power supplys&quot;.
that should be &quot;power supplies&quot;, no apostrophe, and uncapitalized.
