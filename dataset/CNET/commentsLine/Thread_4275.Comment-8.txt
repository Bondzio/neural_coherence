1. what cd is this?
while i did write &quot;audio-cd&quot; and to make sure the settings are all set to analog playback, another person had made a cd with mp3 files on it and was unaware it was not &quot;cd-audio&quot; or &quot;audio-cd.&quot; just want to be crystal clear on this.
use some store bought cd to clear up 1/2 of this question.
2. is it in analog playback?
to use analog playback instead of digital: 1. in windows media player on the tools menu, click options.
2. on the devices tab, click properties for the cd-rom or dvd-rom drive that is being used for playback.
3. under playback, click analog.
