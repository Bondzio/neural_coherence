The clock speed of a processor (Ghz/Mhz) may be misleading.
Different cpus do different amount of work per cycle.
Some processor may operate at a higher clock speed, but does less work per cycle, and ends up being slower than another processor that may be operating at a slower clock speed.
AMD cpus usually have the highest processing capacity per cycle, Celeron the lowest.
That's why many gamers choose AMD over Pentium, even though the fastest Pentium 4 processor operate at a much higher clock.
That said, Celeron looks good for your purposes.
It is by far the cheapest.
