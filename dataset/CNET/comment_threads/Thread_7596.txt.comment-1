I currently have 2 Seagate 500GB SATA II HDDs in a RAID 0 array with 128k stripe.
The RAID controller is an Intel Matrix Storage Manager.
First question, is that a software implementation?
Second, I would like to buy 2-10k raptors and put them into a RAID o for perforance, image the Seagates to a 5th &quot;working drive&quot;, copy that image to the raptors setup in a RAID 0, clean everything but the OS and apps, and then use the Seagates in a RAID 1 array (mirror) for pictures, mp3s, etc.
Is this possible?
Do I need a hardware controller to do it?
Any suggestions/recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
