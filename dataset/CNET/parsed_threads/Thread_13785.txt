<s> Is there a true plug and play available for Win98SE? </s>
<s> I want to move some files/photos from an old computer that is no longer connected to the internet without having to download the drivers from a manufacturer's website ( obviously, since it isn't connected to the internet ). </s>
<s> I will be moving the files/photos to Win XP. </s>
<s> Any recommendations? </s>
<s> W98 is too old to have the required drivers. </s>
<s> You're gonna have to download them. </s>
<s> Just use the XP machine and burn the drivers to a CD. </s>
<s> Windows 98 (and later SE) were from a time before USB memory sticks became widely available. </s>
<s> You'll have to carry the driver either on CD or floppy so 98 (any version?) </s>
<s> can see the stick. </s>
<s> Here's an idea. </s>
<s> See if DAMN SMALL LINUX can be on a FAT formatted USB memory stick. </s>
<s> Then boot from said stick and copy the files out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Get the driver(another system) and burn to CD or if small enough to a floppy. </s>
<s> As for win9x ready flash drive, well I haven't seen one or heard of one. </s>
<s> But, you can look and report back. </s>
<s> Sorry... tada -----Willy </s>
