1.2.1	http : //maxtor.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/maxtor.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php ? p_faqid=2233 & p_created=1106802555 & p_sid=eJi5TTfi & p_lva= & p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9OCZwX3Byb2RzPTE5NCwwJnBfY2F0cz0wJnBfcHY9MS4xOTQ7Mi51MCZwX2N2PSZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPWFuc3dlcnMuc2VhcmNoX25sJnBfcGFnZT0xJnBfc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9Zm9ybWF0 & p_li= & p_topview=1 about holding the power button .	St
1.2.2	Also try updating the flash software .	Sug
1.2.3	If not , the unit is dead .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I already tried holding the power button for 5 seconds and resetting it .	St
1.3.2	Does anyone know if there is something that needs to be reset if the cover is removed ?	Ques
1.4.1	I did n't write about it .	St
1.4.2	Can you connect to it 's web server and do that step ?	Ques
1.4.3	I do n't recall you telling .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Well , when you run the maxtor setup program and it searches the network for the drive , it never finds it .	St
1.5.2	And this is just a simple home network with a linksys router/switch and DHCP enabled .	St
1.5.3	I 'm assuming it has to be formatted in some fashion for the box to recognize the drive ... maybe fat32 ?	Ques
1.6.1	It 's either that or the box is dead .	St
1.6.2	What happened to make you replace the drive ?	Ques
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Just wanted to upgrade the drive .	St
1.7.2	It was working fine until I put the new ( known good ) drive in .	St
1.7.3	I 've replaced the drives on a lot of the maxtor external drives and never had a problem before .	St
1.7.4	Just this time on the shared storage drive .	St
1.7.5	The only thing I can guess is that the internal OS needs the drive in a specific format before it will recognize it .	St
1.8.1	With the old drive , see what format that was in .	St
1.8.2	I would use RANISH PARTITION MANAGER to look at it .	St
1.8.3	Or even to create the new drive in the same partition type and format .	St
1.8.4	I wonder if you duplicated the jumper settings ?	Ques
1.8.5	In closing , some of these boxes have strict limits on hard disk sizes such as 127GB limits or others .	St
1.8.6	The makers rarely reveal exactly what these are but we can take clues if they never offered over 127GB .	St
1.8.7	Bob	St
1.9.1	I have the same issue .	St
1.9.2	I have put the drive into my PC and it saw it as unallocated space .	St
1.9.3	I then mounted it .	St
1.9.4	And so far I have tried everything to fix it with no luck .	St
1.9.5	It just will not take again .	St
1.9.6	Maxtor said it had to be an EXT3 partition so I put it into Linux and formatted it back .	St
1.9.7	Then placed it into the drive and still it will not recognize the drive even after a reset .	St
1.9.8	Can someone help I know I must be able to get it back to life .	St
1.9.9	I tried this http : //www.idevelopment.info/data/Unix/Linux/LINUX_PartitioningandFormattingSecondHardDrive_ext3.shtml	St
1.10.1	Im having same problem .	St
1.10.2	Anyone figure a way ?	Ques
1.11.1	If the drive wo n't reinit it 's either back to Maxtor or we replace the drive housing .	St
1.12.1	I have Data still on my drive , I wanted to make a clone backup of the drive so I put the drive in a Computer which had nothing but another blank drive tried to boot up with a drive cloning program which would n't recognize the drive anyway and ended up shutting it down .	St
1.12.2	From there the drive nolonger want to boot .	St
1.12.3	The drive pass all diagnosis test , and spins up ok .	St
1.12.4	I now trying to find a way that I can plug this drive into a OS that will recognize the data on it .	St
1.13.1	Just incase anyone asks it was Norton 's Ghost I tried to use .	St
1.14.1	- & gt ; Look up G4U Also did you try Linux to see if it recognizes the file system ?	Ques
1.14.2	Bob	St
1.15.1	The drive uses the REISERFS format .	St
1.15.2	It 's a linux based filesystem and please , under no circumstances , try to use it under a Windows environment ( as in hooking the drive directly to the IDE connector ) .	St
1.15.3	Windows will attempt the read and after failing ~255 times , for reasons unknown , it does something to the first couple of sectors of the drive that renders it unreadable once you replace the drive in it 's housing .	St
1.15.4	You must use a *nix based system to reformat the drive , and then reinstall the drive .	St
1.15.5	Hope this helps a little .	St
1.16.1	Yes have tried a few linux systems now , Knoppix , suse , and kubuntu .	St
1.16.2	Closes I can get is an error of permission accesses denied .	St
1.16.3	Linux States you do not have enough permission to read file : ///dev/disk/by-id/ata-Maxtor_6B300R0_B61ZDSBH Unsure how to bypass this	St
1.17.1	reckon this may have been a contributor , most likely something microsoft incorporated to drives that do n't follow Microsoft ways that basically says if i cant read you , noone will .	St
1.17.2	I call it a Microspit .	St
1.18.1	I could n't tell exactly what the & quot ; error message & quot ; was .	St
1.18.2	These forums do n't have great formatting so help us out by putting such in quotes .	St
1.18.3	Also , I wonder what happens if you google that error .	St
1.18.4	Bob	St
