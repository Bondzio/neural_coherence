Just to try it the last tablet was the G tablet http://reviews.cnet.com/tablets/viewsonic-g-tablet/4505-3126_7-34431221.html I also have a BN Color Nook with the Cyranogen installed.
But maybe there's more to this than Ustream.
It's just an app.

Our office works on apps so I never know exactly which tablets are free at the time.
