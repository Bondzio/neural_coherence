<s> I have a wireless b linksys router w/ two wireless cards. </s>
<s> One on the notebbok and one on the 2nd desktop. </s>
<s> I have a total of 3 computers. </s>
<s> 2 of them are wireless. </s>
<s> With the noteboock and the wireless desktop my connection is constan but will range speed. </s>
<s> I can have both wireless computers sitting 6 feet from the router and will get real crappy speeds on the internet. </s>
<s> Is it possible that I have someone outside of my two computers accessing my wireless connection. </s>
<s> And if so what can I do to identify and rectify the situation. </s>
<s> Thank you for any advice you can give on this topic. </s>
<s> Have you updated all firmware and drivers? </s>
<s> Remember that Microsoft won't do this for you. </s>

<s> Use IE and go into the setup screen for your router. </s>
<s> Check the MAC address for your cards in the Mac setup screen. </s>
<s> Set the router so it will only allow these mac addresses to use the router. </s>
<s> You can also set up a log file that will keep track of every use of the router and usually you can set it up so the log is e-mailed to any address you want. </s>
<s> It is easier to go in and look at the log rather than getting a bunch of e-mails from the router. </s>
