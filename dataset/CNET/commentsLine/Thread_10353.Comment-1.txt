i may be too young for this forum, but i need some help deciding on a laptop for school-related uses.
as you may have guessed, i am paying with my own money and am extremely limited by price.
i dont know if anyone will want to hunt a laptop down for me but i need: 1 gb of ram 12&quot; screen &gt;1.5 ghz built-in wireless price below $1,000 (as low as possible would be good) anyway, any help will be greatly appreciated!
thanks doc
