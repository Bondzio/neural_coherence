I had a similar problem when transferring large files, but I would lose all connectivity and the router would reset itself.
I tried every possible solution before giving up and buying a different make/model router.
I haven't had a problem since then.
Does the router have the latest firmware installed?
Have you tried a factory reset?
Do you have the same problem when both computers are wired to the router?
