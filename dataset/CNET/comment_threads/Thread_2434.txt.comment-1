I don't even know if there is such a thing, but if you have or have not heard of it, please let me know.
My boss wants me to find a fire proof external hard drive that our small office can use to backup our data.
I also need to know which kind of external hard drive to buy.
We probably need one with the software to run it included as we don't own any backup software, but will be getting the Office 2007 upgrade which is supposed to include backup software.
We're running new Dell's with Intel Core 2 Duo Processors with 1 GB DDR2 SDRAM at 533 MHz.
We currently run XP and Office 2003, but will be upgrading to both Vista and Office 2007 in the next 6 months.
Our storage need currently is 1.5 GB but will only grow, but maybe double every six months to a year.
Thanks for your suggestions!
