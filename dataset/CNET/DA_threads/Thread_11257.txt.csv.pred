1.1.1	I have a question about CAT 3 cable .	St
1.1.2	Is it possible to have CAT 3 cable run at 100mb ?	Ques
1.1.3	My company currently has CAT 3 cable in some of our buildings at the moment ( there is CAT 5e in most of the other buildings ) .	St
1.1.4	If it is possible , how stable is it ?	Ques
1.1.5	And over what distance is it capable of substaining ( if possible that is ) 100mb .	St
1.1.6	My company does plan to sometime in the future to replace the CAT 3 cable with either CAT 5e or CAT 6 , but for right now , we are trying to determine whether we can run the CAT 3 at CAT 5 speeds .	St
1.1.7	Thanks for any information you can provide .	St
1.2.1	at my site , this page http : //www.wayne.hardy.com/power.htm It relates directly to what you are asking although the information is for voice band frequencies .	St
1.2.2	Power , loss , and capacitance is the same in all twisted wire environments .	St
1.2.3	You might get high speeds on short runs .	St
1.2.4	But routing , external interference , gauge of the wire , etc .	St
1.2.5	affect performance .	St
1.2.6	Try it on short runs .	St
1.2.7	If you have problems , repull the wire .	St
1.3.1	In an office I just repaired , the owner was fretting over the cost of wire and trying to run on an old DUMB network hub .	St
1.3.2	It took a week of me ( elapsed time , not time face to face ) for it to sink in that 50 people at the office going down for an hour was costing far more than the cable and hub in question .	St
1.3.3	We did keep most runs , but the old dumb hub was history .	St
1.3.4	We installed a new switching hub and found what may have been the causes of the entire office going down .	St
1.3.5	It was a cable that was old , but un-marked so we did n't know what it was and a few machines with failing network cards .	St
1.3.6	You have to ask if risking downtime is worth it .	St
1.3.7	Bob PS .	St
1.3.8	Their network was crashing daily .	St
1.3.9	Now it does n't .	St
1.4.1	Is that true even if the router and switches we are using are 1000 mb ( Gig switches ) capability ?	Ques
1.4.2	The routers and switches we are using are from Foundry ( BigIron 8000 and Big Iron 4000 ) and HP Procurves .	St
1.4.3	I think the Procurves are only 10/100 mb capable if I 'm not mistaken .	St
1.4.4	Thanks for any info you can provide .	St
1.5.1	My response is still true for the place of issue .	St
1.5.2	Your choice on the matter .	St
1.5.3	Info ?	Ques
1.5.4	Simple .	St
1.5.5	You will , as noted in the responses be in unsupported territory and it 's your choice to chance it working one minute and not the next .	St
1.5.6	I do n't like unreliable things .	St
1.5.7	Bob	St
1.6.1	Ok , that 's really all I needed to know on the matter .	St
1.6.2	It sounds like it would be too unreliable to even try .	St
1.6.3	Thank you for your time .	St
1.6.4	I will now consider this subject closed .	St
1.7.1	Per CompTia 's N+ certification exam , CAT3 can carry UP TO 10 Mbps .	St
1.7.2	That 's why everyone has been switching to CAT5 .	St
1.7.3	So , I would say no , it 's not possible .	St
