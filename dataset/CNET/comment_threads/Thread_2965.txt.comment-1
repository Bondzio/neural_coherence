i was reading one of yalls post on the emachine t6520 i just recently bought an emachine t6520 and i have a question about the specs of the machine.
i read that it was labeled different than what it actualy had such as... Os:windows xp media center edition Cpu:AMD Athlon 64, 2400 MHz(12x200) 3400+ 2.4 GHz Memory:892 MB (PC3200 DDR SDRAM) Chipset: ATI radeon xpress 200 series all of this info was from the everest system scan but yall said that it was a 3200+ 2.0 Ghz and the dxdiag also says that it is a 3400+.
so is it possible taht the EVEREST home edition is wrong as well or that they corrected the hardware.
i have another question about my computer i am not too smart when it comes to computers so i have a couple of clarity questoins.
i was wondering waht some terms mean if yall dont mind explaining them for me such as... on the everest scan it has a tab called overclocking and i was wondering what that meant because i was under the empressoin that you had to overclock your system in the bios and i didnt do taht so waht do they mean when they say over clocking in one of the tabs.
another question is i have read reviews about a gfx card i would like to purchase for my comp the geforce 6600gt and several people say that they overclocked there card and that they clocked ther card at xxxx.
another question i have is i have a fan on my motherboard and when i get a gfx card will that fan still run and should i get another fan and such and will i need an extra power supply for it i have a pcie16x.
sorry for all the questions but im just very curious at the moment if you dont wont to answer all of them please look at teh first one about my computer cause i got kind of dissapointed when i saw that it was in fack an amd athlon 3200 not 3400 and socket 743 or what ever because i didnt get what i payed for thanks for all your replies
