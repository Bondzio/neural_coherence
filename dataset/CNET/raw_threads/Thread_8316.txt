Now, with a new eMachine XP system, the monitor will not turn off (hibernate) when the PC shuts down. Also, the panel buttons on the monitor (size, brightness, etc.) won't respond when it's connected to this system. Is this a driver problem with the computer? What can I test to pin this down? Thanks!

A discussion in another newsgroup found their display had suffered a mild, but totally fatal failure. Try it back on the 98 PC to see if it died. Bob
