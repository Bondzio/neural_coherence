1.1.1	Hey people , I have a little problem .	St
1.1.2	I found this really good external hard drive and its nice , sleek , and best of all CHEAP !	St
1.1.3	and its from LaCie so thats a plus .	St
1.1.4	But anyway , I 'm a little concerned because this particular hard drive that i want does not have a fan in it .	St
1.1.5	I really do n't want it to die on my any time soon .	St
1.1.6	And i am more than likely going to have the hard drive running all the time , as i am going to be putting some frequently used media on it .	St
1.1.7	So , this questions is mostly directed to people who actually own this model , but do you think that it will die on my quickly because it doesnt have a fan .	St
1.1.8	It has a little ventilation system on the back of it , but i guess it 's just holes to let air in and out .	St
1.1.9	Here 's a link from amazon with the description .	St
1.1.10	Scroll down a little and you can see what the ventilation is like .	St
1.1.11	http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112BKM8/sr=8-1/qid=1233359855/ref=noref ? ie=UTF8 & s=electronics & qid=1233359855 & sr=8-1	St
1.2.1	Passive Cooling and I 've never been a fan ( pun intended ) .	St
1.2.2	The interior of the case is probably aluminum to draw heat from the drive .	St
1.2.3	But , again , I do n't trust passive cooling .	St
1.2.4	Excellent design as far as looks go .	St
1.2.5	I own three external drive cases : A Bytecc with a fan , another something brand that is all aluminum but no fan , and a 2.5 inch drive case for laptop drives with no fan .	St
1.2.6	Guess which one I keep running .	St
1.2.7	I use the other two for backups and such where the drive will not be running for long .	St
1.2.8	Just my thoughts .	Polite
