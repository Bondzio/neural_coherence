<s> I had exactly the same problem with two laptops I had networked previously using a wired connection. </s>
<s> After changing to a wireless connection with Belkin router and network card I had no end of trouble sharing files. </s>
<s> I got into no end of a mess trying to make it work, and eventually couldn't even access some folders on one machine on or off the network. </s>
<s> I took my usual step when nothing else seems to work and formatted both machines and started again. </s>
<s> Making sure they both had the same workgroup names was all I needed to do other than running the XP network &quot;wizard&quot; to make it all work perfectly. </s>
<s> I concluded there must have been some conflict with the original wired setup. </s>
