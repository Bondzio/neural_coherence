I recently read about this Tablet PC by Wipro called e.go so I checked out its website @ www.egobywipro.com as well.
And it looks amazing.
The screen rotates 180degrees, the colour is really nice and it has a stylus as well.
But what I want to know is - Is it a good laptop for a young business professional?
And how much is it for?
Any information on this laptop would be really helpful.
Thanks
