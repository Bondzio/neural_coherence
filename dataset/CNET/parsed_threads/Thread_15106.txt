<s> ...and installing the latest UPDATE (not upgrade) of your Nero software available here: http://ww2.nero.com/enu/Updates.html If that doesn't work, try using CDBurnerXP (free). </s>

<s> I should have asked this earlier (sorry): What operating system are you using? </s>
<s> What is the model of CD/DVD burner? </s>
<s> i'm using Windows Xp Pro SP2 LG GSA-4163 Beige DVD +/-R/RW/RAM 16x16x4x4x5 Dual layer IDE </s>
<s> If you have the installation/restore disk to reinstall Nero, I would try uninstalling Nero completely, restart computer, and then reinstall Nero. </s>
<s> Add the Nero update after reinstall, too. </s>
<s> See if this works. </s>
<s> If yo have a registered copy of Nero, copy its Serial Number before you remove Nero from the computer. </s>
<s> This will allow you to re-enter the Serial Number after reinstallation. </s>
