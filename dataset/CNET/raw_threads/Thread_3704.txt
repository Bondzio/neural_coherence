Purchased the Canon PIXMA MP500 and I can't, nor can Canon support help me to figure out the problem. If I use the Arc Soft Photo Studio or Scansoft Omnipage it will scan just fine, however if i go to the MP Navigator 2.0 it will not scan and a box pops up saying &quot;the scanner driver supported by this software is not installed, install it and then retry&quot;... I spent over 2 hours on the phone to fix it, it was uninstalled, re-installed, started up with windows only and no other programs, downloaded driver and software from canon website, tried to extract drivers off the CD that came with it. Does anyone know the problem or any info on how to fix? Thanks so much

Somehow my scanner got hooked up to what looked like a printer driver. It would scan fine with other problems but would not open the MP Navigator. I actually have an MP830, but it might work for you. 1. Go into device manager and find the scanner 2. Right click and choose update driver. 3. After following the screens to select a driver yourself, from the list choose the driver that doesn't have the word inkjet in it. My two drivers were something like Canon Inkjot MP830 and Canon MP830. When I selected the second one, it seemed to work. I hope this helps. Grant

I called back a couple of days ago and went through most of the same thing again. Uninstall, re-install, all of it, parts of it. I was sooooo aggravated!! Bottom line Canon says its a glitch with my PC and the driver of my Canon printer. He clearly stated its my problem and nothing to do with Canon. I can't find anyone else that can help either. I have tried and tried. Best of luck to you with your problem! Kathy

I went into my device manager as you instructed, but there was no mention of a scanner driver for me to update nor a printer driver. I have been able to print to my MP830, but when scanning it locks up on the last step. I'm running Vista too. Is there anything else you could suggest?

We had some power surges the last few days but I'm hooked up through a pretty heavy duty surge suppressor. To be sure I ran several other devices off of same surge suppressor and they all worked fine. Anyhow, I unplugged the MP830 I felt more than a little stupid since it wouldn't power up but I had to do it. Plugged the power cord to different outlets just to be sure and still no power to machine. So there it is. It's about eight months old and not heavily used as it is my home office machine. I did consider that 1 of the ink tanks may be low but w/o power how can one get to the tanks since they have to position themselves while the machine is powered up? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

What you have to do is uninstall everything for the Canon MP....then turn off the printer...and UNPLUG the cable that connects the printer to your computer. Now re-install both the software for the MP830 and the drivers (I was using Vista so I had to go to the website to get an updated driver & software www.canon.com). Now, once that is completed, turn the machine back on and plug in the cord that connects the printer to your computer (this is when it automatically downloads the driver needed for the software to work- MP navigator- and the scanner) Hope this helps, I FINALLY got mine to work! YEAH!

The problem was, I had the printer plugged into a USB card I had added to my computer. When I moved the USB cord from this one, to a USB outlet that was orginial to the computer even though it was a slower 1.1 USB it worked. I had to delete the driver and the MP Navigator and do a reinstall, but after that it works great.

I too experienced a dead MP830 and also deduced that this happended after a power surge. No matter how good of a surge protector you have, all electronics can fall victim to disruption. So, I decided to call Canon support and they apparently are aware of this dead MP830 issue and you simply need to keep the unit unplugged for 20+ minutes to allow it to fully discharge. Then mine came back to life with power. Cheers, Michael

But since then the &quot;Scan&quot; button on the printer doesn't seem to work. When I press the &quot;Scan&quot; and select &quot;Save to PC&quot; or similar from the LCD, it used to initiate the scanner software on the PC and start scanning automatically.

When I plugged it back in the machine was able to power up and work properly. Our power went out yesterday and I think there were probably a couple of surges as it came back on. Although I'm glad the printer is now working, I'm a little disappointed it was the only one of my devices that was affacted out of the 20+ pieces of electronic equipment I probably have plugged in. Also, for such an easy fix, it's amazing I could not find reference to this in the Canon Knowledge Base. Overall, I've been very pleased with my MP530.

Downloaded the new drivers and MP Navigator 2.02 from the Canon website (for Vista 32 bit, as that's what we have). Printer works fine, but...when trying to scan from MP Navigator 2.02, it just says &quot;scanning&quot; and gives me an hour glass. The scanner never activates or does anything. When I look at task manager, mpscan.exe is running, using about 45% of the cpu. After 5 minutes, I have to kill MP Navigator via the task manager, 'cause it's simply hung. We also have Picasa 3 for photo editing. It has the ability to &quot;launch&quot; the scanner, and when we do that, the scanner works fine. We prefer using MP Navigator though. It's frustrating- scanner works fine with Picasa 3, but...doesn't work with the latest MP Navigator.

MP 530	I found a solution by unistalling all of the Canon software, restarting, reinstalling and plugging in the powered on unit, only after the installation was complete. When you plug the printer in AFTER the install, it will find the device and install all three drivers that are required (printer,scanner & fax). To properly remove all of the software make sure to remove the printer from the &quot;Devices and Printers&quot; section and unistall it from the control panel(mpnavigator and the printer). Reboot! (important!) After a reboot, confirm that the software is no longer installed and reinstall the printer and plug in the USB AFTER the installation has completed and wait about 5 minutes. Reboot. Now the MP Navigator software should function properly. This is why we follow instructions! Always install software before plugging in your hardware.
