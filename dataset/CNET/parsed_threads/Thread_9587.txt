<s> I currently have an old computer and need to upgrade it's old slow processor. </s>
<s> I have the AMD Athlon XP 3000+ with 1.5GB of Ram running Windows XP home. </s>
<s> I need to know which newer processors are compatible with my current configuration and what prices are like as I have no idea. </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> if you don't know this info, install cpu-z: http://www.cpuid.com/ the 'mainboard' tab will have the info. </s>
<s> the 'cpu' tab's name, and package will show the exact cpu and socket type. </s>
<s> if your athlon 3000+ uses socket 754 (which has been obsolete for a number of years) there will be no new CPUs compatible with it. </s>
<s> OK so I installed cpuz, my main board shows no manufacturer in the box but it does have a model number (K7S8X). </s>
<s> It is running American Megatrends BIOS. </s>
<s> For my socket it says socket A 462. </s>
<s> http://www.asrock.com/mb/overview.asp?Model=K7S8X Do you have the manual ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> You need a new system, go with a cheap mATX board and a cheap Pentium Dual Core, as the Athlon XPs are completely phazed out and rarely available, so i advize you to build a new system, rather than upgrading the old one, its cheaper and it also allows for newer technology. </s>
<s> I guess I'll open up and check. </s>
<s> I also do have the manual. </s>
<s> I will consider that. </s>
<s> I will need to upgrade this machine or get an entirely new one sometime anyway. </s>
<s> course of action. </s>
<s> Then you're starting the project with the facts. </s>
