Got the whole system ready to with a X2-3K and 2GB RAM. The 5K will make a nice addition ...and the the 3K will make a good hand me down or maybe a good backup system CPU. VAPCMD

Does that mean on the day? The announced AMD price drop will happen on Monday, July 24th. When will retailers such as Fry's and CompUSA drop their prices to match the dropped prices? On the same day? After a week? A month? A year?
11332	6	191862	2085553	2085504	VAPCMD	7/22/06 9:44 AM	1.15356144E12	You'll see the new vendor prices at places like	Techbargains.com, Anandtech.com, Tomshardware.com, Newegg.com, ZipZoomFly.com, etc., as soon as they're posted. No one here knows such info unless they work for one of the retailers .. and telling potential buyers like you or me would not be in their best interest. VAPCMD
