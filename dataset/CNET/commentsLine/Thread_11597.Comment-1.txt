i have a dell dimension l700cxe.
it only has a cd-rom and i would like to buy a cd-rw/dvd burner for it.
it only has the one opening for the cd-rom.
i don't know what i should purchase, an internal, or external.
i don't even know if i can get an internal.
i also don't know if i have to purchase the burner from dell or if i can use another brand.
can someone please help this complete novice with these dilemmas?
