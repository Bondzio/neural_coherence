I know I can cascade, BUT: Can I hook up this drive to two computers (running WinXP and Win 2003) at the same time with FireWire? Will both Windows recognize them (will it handle priorities etc)?

Some will write it works but given how many I see each year (almost equal to USB drives) and that we had firsthand experience of total wipeouts for no good reason I'll write &quot;don't.&quot; Feel free to try but don't store anything that you can't lose on them. Then again, when I connect to an Apple, we'll go firewire everytime. &quot;Can I hook up this drive to two computers (running WinXP and Win 2003) at the same time with FireWire? Will both Windows recognize them (will it handle priorities etc)?&quot; Absolutely not. Bob

It would be kind of cool to have a shared hard drive at home with all the MP3s.. Not much writing, mostly reading.. So they wouldn't have to struggle for access rights that much..

Microsoft is even moreso unlikely to work proper since it's OS will never expect the filesystem to be shared. Just like a trainwreck, this may be fun to watch. Bob

Both PCs would not even detect the hard drive. One at a time they would and when you hook up the second cable, the first computer would disconnect (and second one wouldn't find the drive).. So I didn't even get in the fun stuff of testing simult. writing etc Too bad. By the way, Windows 2003 is not too good with plug-and-play FireWire.. It would ocassionally not detect it and I had to 'Add New HardWare'.. Plus is you boot it with hard drive attached it would often just freeze.. No problems with WinXP though. Proves yet again that 2003 and XP are very different OSs and they just look similar.
