<s> After trouble free operation of my Belkin N Wireless Modem Router, it has suddenly started failing to connect with the internet (the amber internet light is flashing). </s>
<s> I have disconnected it and re-connected my old Voyager 2091 router which is working perfectly. </s>
<s> Finding that this worked, I replaced the Voyager with the Belkin, but it still fails to connect the internet (amber light flashing so I am back on the Voyager!). </s>
<s> I would prefer to be using the Belkin - any suggestions to cure the modem? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> For example this can happen on cable modem setups but the details appear to be missing. </s>
<s> Maybe the Belkin is dead, maybe it's the old cable modem issue that we cure a lot. </s>
<s> But the details elude me. </s>

<s> not in the heart of rural England! </s>
<s> It is just called an &quot;Belkin N wireless Modem Router&quot; I think the internet supply is called ADSL. </s>
<s> I bought it just one year ago but it has not had a lot of use as I ran my Voyager for aprt of the time.. Is it possible that it could suddenly have died? </s>
<s> Ok, with ADSL we have to set up the ISP details or the light will blink. </s>
<s> I can't guess those details and hopefully you have them. </s>

<s> I have contacte the Belkin help desk, but, after three lengthy emails from them and having followed all their guidance, I still get no contact. </s>
<s> However, taking into account that the Belkin router will not work on either of my two computers (one is a MAC and the others a Windows XP) and also that my old router works perfectly on both, it seems likely too me that the router itself has a fault. </s>
<s> Rather than waste any more time on it, I have decided to cut my losses and dump the router! </s>
<s> Many thanks for you comments Gerald </s>
