Hi, just purchased an Hp 1030nr mini laptop and the CPU fan stays on constantly.
I have downloaded all updates from Hp/SUPPORT even the Bios, also all Windows updates have been installed.
I am just browsing websites and Ebay with no intense typing or programs running.
This issue drains my battery down very quickly,any suggestions will be appreciated.
In Bios, there does not seem to a funcion to alter CPU usage.
