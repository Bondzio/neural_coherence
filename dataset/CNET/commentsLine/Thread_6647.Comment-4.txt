writes &quot;the core 2 duo outperforms amd's athlon 64 x2 clock for clock in most benchmarks, and it even consumes less energy than amd's offerings.&quot; so that in a nutshell is why i'd get that.
besides the stability and standard bearer intel is.
my next machine is a core 2 duo machine so power is a concern.
