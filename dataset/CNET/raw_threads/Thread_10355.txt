If I can make an adjustment, via some adjustment to the registry or whatever, Please be extremely detailed.

Proffitt: -- I have Windows Vista Home Premium: Control Panel &gt; Power Options &gt; What to do when I press buttons (see left column) &gt; adjust to hibernate when pressig the sleep button. Terrific. Thanks for waking me up!, Robert
