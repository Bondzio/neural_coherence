i had already tried three different modems, all had the same result.
but it seems there was never any problem with the modem to begin with.
after a bit of digging, i managed to find an old trial cd for a different isp, and installed it.
it worked.
i was able to connect to the internet, and visit websites without any errors.
i used the guest sign-in feature in msn 8 after going online, and that even worked.
apparently the problem is on msn's end, not mine.
even while connected to the internet, the sign-up wizard was saying i was offline.
now all i have to do is hope msn customer service doesn't put me on hold and forget about me.. again.
