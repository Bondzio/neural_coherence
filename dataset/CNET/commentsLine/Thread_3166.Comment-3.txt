of course it has a life expectancy (like everything else in the universe) but i don't think it is possible to predict when it will fail.
i have a mac pro with 4 internal drives and 2 external drives.
i have had two of the internal drives for many years.
i routinely use tech tool pro to examine the drive volumes and files.
just to make sure all looks ok. there are many other such tools for mac and pc.
some come with the computer and are free (like the disk utility for the mac).
i believe that routine maintenance should help to extend the life of the drive.
to be sure, i am a computer hobbyist, so i am sure pros will be able to provide more detail.
but back up, and then back up, and then back up some more.
i use time machine in mac osx to routinely back up all drives.
plus, i place critical files on the apple idisk, just in case the main drives and the backup drive fail.
