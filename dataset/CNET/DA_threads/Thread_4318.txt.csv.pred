1.1.1	I have a D865glc intel motherboard with a Pentium 4 2.8 GHS processor , which currently has 2 - 256 mb pc2700 ddr 333mhz non-parity non ECC sticks of double sided ram arranged so as to bank switch or opperate in DDr mode , one stick in slot 0 bank A and one in slot 0 bank B. I tried to upgrade by installing memory with the same specs , only single sided , in the blank slots .	St
1.1.2	This did n't work well .	St
1.1.3	I then went to Intel 's site and found that the board needed 4 sticks of double sided memory to expand to 1024 mb .	St
1.1.4	What possible difference does it make if the chips are on one or both sides if all other specs are the same ?	Ques
1.1.5	Os the way they work different or what ?	Ques
1.2.1	Do you have any electronics design background ?	Ques
1.2.2	It has to do with the number of chipselects and the design of the stick and not if there are chips on both sides of the stick .	St
1.2.3	Maybe that 's enough info for you ?	Ques
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Nope , no electronics design experience .	St
1.3.2	Just one question , though .	St
1.3.3	So , double sided does n't necessarily mean chips on both sides of the ram stick ?	Ques
1.3.4	Does that mean a stick with chips only on one side could be double sided in the way it works ?	Ques
1.3.5	In other words : there is no way to tell if a stick of memory is double or singled sided by just looking at it ?	Ques
1.4.1	That 's why we use places like crucial.com and keep track of the make and models of the memory sticks so we can sort it out .	St
1.4.2	It 's one of those things that just because the stick fits does not mean it 's compatible .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks for your time .	St
1.5.2	You 've probably saved me from a big headache trying to figure out why some memory chip that looks & quot ; double sided & quot ; is n't working in my system .	St
1.5.3	All that glitters is not gold , or chips on both sides of a dimm does n't necessarily double sided memory make .	St
1.6.1	When I run into this is mostly many year old machines .	St
1.6.2	Specifically those old workhouses based on LX , BX and some i8xx chipsets .	St
1.6.3	These chipsets had only some many memory select lines and quite often where you would have to dance around to find just the right memory sticks .	St
1.6.4	These are also fairly robust machines that rarely died which explains why you run into them so often .	St
1.6.5	PNY , and those store memory sticks are usually double sided and the usual 256 MB sticks are the ones that rarely work .	St
1.6.6	Why this is so is that the sticks are made purely for lowest price and what would work in the most systems .	St
1.6.7	I know it 's a little tough at first , but keep trying ... Bob	St
