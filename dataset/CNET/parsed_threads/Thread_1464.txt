<s> Hello all, Yeterday I bought a Thoshiba StorE art 3 1TB external hard drive. </s>
<s> It had some drivers inside(200MB) and when I checked the available space, it was showning 931GB. </s>
<s> I checked with the vendor and he said &quot;the acutul and the available capacities are always different and moreover it is having some space reserved for backup&quot;. </s>
<s> I do not have the access to the 1024-931=93GBs and the moment and I feel confused. </s>
<s> I can see two partitions /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb1 but only one is accessible to me. </s>
<s> Also I am using Fedora 13 and the speed I am getting is 1MB/s which is very low. </s>
<s> Pls advice.... </s>
<s> Thanks in advance|adarsh </s>
<s> Seems OK. </s>
<s> There are 2 definitions of GB. </s>
<s> They differ by 7%. </s>
<s> When selling a disk generally the one giving the largest number is used. </s>
<s> In the OS usually the other. </s>
<s> Nothing wrong with that. </s>
<s> Don't know why it's so slow (unless it's connected to a USB 1 port). </s>

<s> Hi... Can you please clarify in &quot;There are 2 definitions of GB&quot; ? </s>
<s> Also, is Thoshiba the one holding the most space than other manufacturers ? </s>
<s> If yes who is the most efficient ? </s>
<s> Is 7% a standard rate ? </s>
<s> We have decimal bytes and binary bytes. </s>
<s> A megaton is ONE MILLION TONS. </s>
<s> A computer MegaByte is 1048576. </s>
<s> We're nearly 5 per cent off already. </s>
<s> IMAGINE if you converted 1 Billion bytes to TeraBytes? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> HD makers rate capacity based on one K-byte equals 1000 bytes. </s>
<s> An OS....such as Windows...rates capacity based on one K-byte equals 1024 bytes. </s>
<s> If you think about that for a moment.....and then get out paper and pencil and expand it to one T-byte.....a whole bunch of space is going to vanish. </s>
<s> Already tried and sobbed about the ~90 GBs. </s>
<s> If it is a case of 1000mB to 1GB, then it around 7%. </s>
<s> You are right. </s>
<s> But still searching for a way to make it faster. </s>
<s> On windows I get 55KB/s. </s>
<s> In linux it literally slept.. </s>
<s> But will find a way for sure </s>
<s> For example the host PC make, model, where connected. </s>
<s> So here it is, some front USB ports fall back to USB 1.0 speed and while it is well discussed why, after years I found one person to fix it. </s>
<s> This means my advice is to use the rear ports. </s>
<s> But without make and model, how can I give that advice? </s>
<s> About Fedora. </s>
<s> Nice but I'd try Ubuntu next. </s>
<s> I find its hardware support to be a little better. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It is a vaio VPCEB12EN. </s>
<s> It does not have USB ports on the back, but three on the right side and one usb/eSATA port on left, whcih can also used as a USB port(I did not try on that one). </s>
<s> And also with windows I can see the transfer rate upto 57MB/s with the ports on the right. </s>
<s> Yes I agree with that. </s>
<s> Ubuntu has better support and also easy too, than Fedora. </s>
<s> But I love fedora ! </s>
<s> !. </s>
<s> site:forums.fedoraforum.org Fedora sony slow usb on google finds folk talking about that. </s>
<s> Sorry but I don't write on work on Fedora (just some embedded Linux) so let's let Fedora folk address that OS. </s>
<s> http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=261015 seems to echo your post here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> That is my post only. </s>
<s> Posted it yesterday. </s>
<s> I am afraid it is not a problem with sony, because I am getting reasonably good speed while on windows. </s>
<s> Seems like some driver issue in fedora. </s>
