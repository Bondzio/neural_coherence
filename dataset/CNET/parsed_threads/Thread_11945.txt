<s> I have a Samsung Blu-ray dvd player that was advertised to be netflix ready. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, it can only link to ethernet, and my home has a wireless network. </s>
<s> I tried to work around buying another $100 piece of hardware (ethernet bridge) by linking to my Gateway laptop. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the laptop does not have an ethernet connector--just phone and USB, and the DVD player does not have a USB connector. </s>
<s> There has to be a gizmo that will let me connect up. </s>
<s> I've looked at ethernet-USB connectors and I think they will work, but I thought I'd let you hardware geniuses give me some advice before I spend more money on this setup. </s>
<s> Thanks for any suggestions you have. </s>
<s> Here's the bridge I used. </s>
<s> HOWEVER it may tax the occasional networker or users. </s>
<s> The WGPS606 was so cheap and worked so well that at 25 I bought two. </s>
<s> Let me state that to setup as a bridge you CHEAT and LIE that you are setting it up as a print server but bail out when you get to the print setup. </s>
<s> Viola, a bridge. </s>
<s> Try google for the refurbs or http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=310176193084 Bob </s>
<s> If so have you considered the power line adapters? </s>
<s> Connect one to the router via Ethernet and plug it in. </s>
<s> Connect the other one (you need two) to the player and plug it in. </s>
