1.1.1	i 'm having some problems with my computer and was wondering if any of you out there may know what is causing my problem so i know whether or not to bother fixing it .	St
1.1.2	so basically my computer crashes while i am playing world of warcraft .	St
1.1.3	the screen freezes up on and the last second of sound at the time of the freeze repeats over and over like a machine gun or something .	St
1.1.4	i thought perhaps that it was my vide card seeing as how it was a 2 plus year old radeon 9600 pro , but i went out and bought a new geforce 6200 and i am still having the above mentioned problem .	St
1.1.5	the wierd thing is that my computer only seems to freeze while playing warcraft , though i havent tried any other games .	St
1.1.6	my system specs are AMD athlon XP 2800+ 2.08 ghz 1.50ghz ram geforce 6200 thanks for help in advance and if you have any questions i 'll answer them as fast as i can !	St
1.1.7	thanks again !	Polite
1.2.1	is this computer overclocked ? ?	Ques
1.2.2	... . download this software and tell me your temprature ( http : //www.almico.com/speedfan432.exe ) i think its because of your high temprature..so this software will give your temprature at idle ... .and for load download this program ( http : //mersenne.org/gimps/p95v2414.exe ) and also run the speedfan because prime95 will give your pc a 100 % load .	St
1.2.3	and now post your idle as well as your load temp..bye	St
1.3.1	I 'll be able to play it for maybe 2 hours and then it 'll quit ( P4 3.6ghz , x1900 ati ) .	St
1.3.2	I had to decrease the resolution .	St
1.3.3	And darkstar has an option to turn off shadows , which greatly increased performance .	St
1.3.4	In the support forum for the game they told me to put the program darkstar.exe in the the exceptions list turning off dep or wep , or something like that .	St
1.3.5	If after decreasing resolution and reinstalling directx still the same thing happens , its probably something you 're just going to have to live with with that game .	St
1.3.6	Darkstar one always quits on me .	St
1.4.1	I had an Athlon XP 3200+ .	St
1.4.2	I had the same problem when running even simple games , I ran some tests on it and found that the CPU was getting very hot .	St
1.4.3	Upon further research I found that this whole line of CPU 's runs notoriously hot .	St
1.4.4	I 'd recommend downloading a program to check your temp .	St
1.4.5	If its too hot , try buying some better thermal grease ( I use Arctic Silver . )	St
1.4.6	Apply that to your Athlon and give it a try .	St
1.4.7	I had to do it a couple times to get the right amount , too much = too hot , too little = too hot .	St
1.4.8	That should fix the problem , your comp is doing exactly what mine did .	Sug
1.5.1	so i installed the two programs you mentioned and at idle my temp seems to be around 20 C and when i turn on prime 95 my temperture quickly climbs to over 50 C and a little fire icon appears ... i assume this is a bad thing .	St
1.5.2	so i figure i will try what was suggested by Kestrel731 and go and buy some thermal grease to see if it helps any .	Sug
1.5.3	please feel free to post any other suggestions or tips , and thank you very much so far .	Sug
1.5.4	i 'll update my status when i try the thermal grease .	St
1.5.5	thanks again .	Polite
1.6.1	tried using some arctic silver and it seems to be working good .	St
1.6.2	temp is staying fairly low , so far so good !	St
1.6.3	thanks everyone for the help !	Polite
