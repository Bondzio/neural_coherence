Computers sometimes freeze, but if a computer freezes on startup regularly, or if it freezes when multi-tasking, there's probably something wrong.
A computer could suffer permanent damage when it stops running abruptly..

Mismatched hardware is common, even some of the large computer manufactures do insufficient analyses and testing when they select the components that make up their systems.
Many components that make up a computer just don't play well together..
