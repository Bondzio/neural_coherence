1.1.1	I was trying to help a friend set up his wireless router .	St
1.1.2	He had the Geeksquad come and set it up and I have no idea what they did .	St
1.1.3	A mess of wires .	St
1.1.4	I noticed that I was able to log into the imbeded browser of the modem and the router from the main PC .	St
1.1.5	I did n't think it was possible to log into the modem if it was set up in bridged ethernet mode .	St
1.1.6	His internet is working but I was thinking that he may have problems with double NATing .	St
1.1.7	Basically , I just want to know what options there are for setting up a router to a modem .	St
1.1.8	I 'm aware of bridged mode and setting up the router as a switch ( not real knowledgable of this one ) .	St
1.1.9	But before I tell him it 's set up all wrong , I want to know if I 'm missing something .	St
1.1.10	Seems like DHCP is enabled on both devices .	St
1.1.11	Please advise .	St
1.2.1	If it works I would leave it alone .	St
1.2.2	The problem with double nat is mostly related when you need a incoming session into a local PC .	St
1.2.3	If all the traffic outbound then it does n't matter .	St
1.2.4	Pretty much depends on the IP for the modem and the router are on the same subnet .	St
1.2.5	If they are on different ones then you have a double nat .	St
1.2.6	Running DHCP on both will work well in most cases but again it depends if you need to map ports to a PC .	St
1.2.7	The outside address of the router could technically change so mapping would change .	St
1.2.8	If there is no mapping of ports then it can change all it wants and the user PC does not care .	St
1.2.9	There is nothing wrong with double nat it tends to be confusing for people to get setup and to debug when there are issues .	St
1.2.10	Once it is works it works	St
1.3.1	I did n't know where to start with the print sever on this setup .	St
1.3.2	I just knew that the modem should be in bridged mode and the router should be left to do the address translations .	Sug
1.3.3	I 've never seen a setup with double NATing before , so I thought something was wrong .	St
1.3.4	He 's trying to connect a wireless linksys print server when he already has a wireless router .	St
1.3.5	Should just be a non-wireless print server .	St
1.3.6	I think I may leave that one alone .	St
1.4.1	know enough to be real dangerous .	St
1.4.2	Your post is light on specifics such as type of connection , make and model of modem and router , and operating system .	St
1.4.3	So here is the generic setup .	St
1.4.4	First , you do n't need to access the modem unless you 're just looking around .	St
1.4.5	Second , set both the modem and the router to default .	St
1.4.6	If there is a software switch , use it .	St
1.4.7	If there is a reset button use it .	St
1.4.8	Turn everything off .	St
1.4.9	Now , connect everything thus : modem - & gt ; router - & gt ; PC Power up the modem , wait for the lights to stabilize .	St
1.4.10	Power on the router , wait for the lights .	St
1.4.11	Power up the PC .	St
1.4.12	On the desktop , right click Network Neighborhood , choose properties and choose to show the Networking icon in the tray .	St
1.4.13	Only to see if traffic is moving .	St
