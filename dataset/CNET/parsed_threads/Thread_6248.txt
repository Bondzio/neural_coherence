<s> For several new, built-up desktop computers, I've been offered the choice of upgrading from a Dual Core chip to a Core 2 Duo for $60 (before bargaining). </s>
<s> Would that be money well spent or is the performance difference not that great? </s>
<s> Are there other considerations in making the choice in these chip types? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> if all you'll be using the PC for is web browsing and email, you probably won't notice any difference. </s>
<s> but if you're using microsoft office, rip CDs or DVDs, edit photos and videos, or watch high-definition video, the $60 upgrade will probably be worthwile. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> email, web: no difference Office, rip CD/DVD: buy it, worth your $60 Gaming/HiDef videos: better performance, but $60 on a graphics card will be felt more </s>
<s> Thanks . </s>

<s> right now I think I only would need the faster chip for burning DVDs, some CorelDraw-type graphics, large slide shows, and sometimes working with 5 or more web browser tabs and/or work programs open at once. </s>
<s> So from this thread's replies, I thought I would get the Core 2 Duo. </s>
<s> However, regarding the graphics card, I thought I would downgrade what is being offered on this built-up computer. </s>
<s> The original offer gives a G-Force 512 Mb PC-X card. </s>
<s> However, the shop guy said I could probably do without that and just use the on-board graphics from the Mboard, a &quot;Gigabyte&quot; GA-G31M-S2C. </s>
<s> I would save $60. </s>
<s> What do you think? </s>
<s> The thing is I don't play complex games on my computers. </s>
<s> Thanx. </s>
<s> playback of any high def video. </s>
<s> if you don't plan on watching video on the pc, then feel free to downgrade to the built-in intel graphics. </s>
