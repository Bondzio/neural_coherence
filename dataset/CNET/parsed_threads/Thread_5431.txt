<s> Which do you guys think would be a good blu ray player to purchase? </s>
<s> Any good recommendations would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Seems fine here. </s>
<s> Sorry, the old one not that new one. </s>
<s> I didn't quite understand what you said... any problems? </s>
<s> I'm not sure what you didn't understand. </s>
<s> Blu-ray drive. </s>
<s> Is that correct? </s>
<s> Not a standalone BP. </s>
<s> Let me share an annoying issue with many blu-ray drive purchases. </s>
<s> Many fall for the cheap bare drive buy without BluRay player software. </s>
<s> Today I don't find such for free and if you don't get it with the drive the added cost vaporises your wallet (err, savings.) </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>

<s> @ lee koo No, it's a Blu Ray Player.. </s>
<s> I'm tossing over of just using PS3 instead of buying a stand alone blu Ray player but some guys here said that it isn't a &quot;smart&quot; thing to do. </s>
<s> I think I'll agree. </s>
<s> @ Bob Thanks for the tip. </s>
<s> Regarding before, I thought you had any problems with my question. </s>
<s> You said &quot;Seems fine here&quot;, I thought I did something terrible. </s>
<s> Haha . </s>
<s> I'll continue searching first.. it isn't that urgent. </s>
