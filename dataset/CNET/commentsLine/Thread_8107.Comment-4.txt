btw, $2000 builds a high-end pc... you can have a great gamer for far less.
you could build a core i7, but i wouldn't recommend it for a first-time builder since the mobos are still a bit finicky.
here's a $1,600 build with a fast quad core, 4gb ram, dual 640gb hard drives, blu-ray drive, radeon hd 4870 1gb, xonar audio, wireless mouse/keyboard, and a 23&quot; monitor.
basically everything but speakers.
mobo: asus p5q se/r, $100 cpu: intel core2quad q9550, 2.83ghz quad core, $280 ram: g.skill 2x2gb ddr2-800, cl4, $50 video: xfx radeon hd 4870, 1gb, $220 audio: asus xonar audio, pci-express, $90 hd: 2xwestern digtial caviar green 640gb hd, $140 optical: lg ggc-h20l, bluray/hd-dvd reader, dvd burner, retail, $120 cpu cooler: asus v60, $40 case: antec 900, $110 power supply: corsair 650w, 80plus, $100 kb/mouse: microsoft wireless laser 5000, $40 os: vista premium 64bit, $100 monitor: acer x233hbid lcd, $210 intel matrixraid will allow you to setup the dual hard drives as a 100gb mirrored c: drive and a 1tb striped d: drive.
if you want more gaming horsepower, a geforce gtx 285 is another $120.
