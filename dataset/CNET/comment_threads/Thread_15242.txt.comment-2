My solution is to link the routers with the cable.
The wireless link is too hard on users and then the one wireless link I do use requires 3 devices.
That is 2 routers, a bridge/client and then that last router as an WAP.
So no.
It's not easy and I've yet to find a tutorial to put into this small space.
