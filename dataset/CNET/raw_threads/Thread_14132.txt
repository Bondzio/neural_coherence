I'm urgently seeking someone with background as a CRT/LCD designer, because I have been experiencing TERRIBLE health problems with my past two monitors, that I have not been experiencing with older (dial-knob) monitors. I am now using a 1991 13&quot; monitor which I had gotten free from a cousin, and it's not causing me the health problems that the KDS-CRT & Samsung-LCD did (the latter is just laying around the house now - and I must emphasize that I tried every so-called solution imaginable, such as raising the resolution, frequency, changing the Gamma/Vibrancy/Brightness/Contrast until it was so dim that I could barely distinguish the text on the dark grey toolbars. Nothing helped. In fact, the old 13-incher is better in that I can immediately adjust the dial-knobs as I need to, and I'm still able to distinguish text on the toolbars even while the rest of the screen is dim enough to suit me. To clarify: Proportionally, the old CRT seems to have a smaller gap between bright colors & dark colors than the newfangled ones. I tried Tinter-Lite but it only changes background colors of WordPad & the like, but I can't for example specify that if I view washing machines on a website, they should appear blue vs. white. I've seen others on the www who also developed problems after acquiring LCDs, but which were then resolved by notebook computers. For example: http://www.cloanto.com/users/mcb/19960719lcd.html also see Irlen Syndrome: http://www.evansconsult.org/is.htm Thing is, I've already spent $300 on my Samsung LCD which is now just laying around. I cannot afford to buy expensive notebooks only to find that those, too, cause me problems. Besides, I just bought a new Dell system, so all I really need is a monitor itself, not a &quot;notebook system&quot;. Is there a monitor engineer here, who really knows what's the real villain behind certain modern CRTs/LCDs, which seemingly are less of a problem in notebooks & old CRTs? Is it that the fluorescents are higher wattage? Or that there are a greater volume of bulbs? I've been fluorescent intolerant since childhood - I remember that in department stores my eyes would tear & I'd get migraine. But now my problems have been way worse - I wake up next day drained & with terrible pain in my nerve endings. I'm panicking, because what will I do when this old CRT dies? Frankly speaking, even the old CRT isn't ideal for my health, I'm sure it would be much better if it had warm back-lighting. As a separate issue, though still part of it, since connecting the old CRT, my browser Preview & Print modes are out of wack. Text becomes a skinnier string, flush on the left side & sometimes truncating on the right side. Does anyone have a clue how to fix this, so that I can print normally?

While you can get eye fatigue using a monitor for a long time, you can't damage your eyes by using them. There is something wrong with your eyes, not with the monitors, find out what it is.
6539	2	8114	95493	94797	JudySmith	1/11/04 6:36 PM	1.07384616E12	Please, I asked for an engineer/designer	Can someone please direct me to someone knowledgeable re: the workings of monitors, so that I can get practical advice? !!! If I were seeking medical help, I'd have gone to a medical board for this question. Did you see the links I gave? I'm obviously not the only one with this problem, and I suspect it isn't as uncommon as you may think, just because you and others on this board don't happen to experience it. And as far as what you said about it not being a &quot;monitor problem&quot;, note that I was just informed by a programmer (who himself had experienced this problem) regarding notebooks vs. other LCDs:

And to cross the gulf of a medical issue to the monitor selection is going to be difficult. I agree you should elicit your medical doctor's help on solving this one. Just like I have asked http://www.acb.org/ for reference at times, that is where the better resources may be for this issue. As per title, look at where such things are made now. Such things are not made in most English-speaking countries now. Bob
6539	4	8114	95667	95535	JudySmith	1/11/04 10:19 PM	1.07385954E12	How about retired older-CRT engineers? American?	Do you mean that there aren't engineers from the old days still around? Meaning the ones who designed monitors in the 1980s? That's who I'm seeking - because I suspect they'll speak my language in more ways than just &quot;English&quot;. I mean the language of stepping &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;. To give an example, I spoke recently to a guy from the company that produced my &quot;ancient&quot; CRT. He had a Chinese or Japanese accent, but he spoke & understood English. **But** despite his grasp of English, it seemed to baffle him that anyone should be asking a question outside the box. He just courteously explained that they don't produce those old models anymore, but that he'd inquire [about whatever I'd inquired] and get back to me. As far as both your referrals to doctors, how on earth are they going to help with the practical issue of finding monitors to suit my needs? They're not techies! And I don't have a problem with eyesight, but rather with overstimulated nervous system. I wake up drained, with bone pain, abdominal pain, you name it. For all I know, it may be slightly related to photosensitive epilepsy, because GABA somewhat helps my pain, just as it helps with epilepsy. But I don't get these problems from the old CRT, just the newer ones. I'm panicking, since this CRT may soon go on the blink, and then what? Just as snow-blind people need to avoid blinding snow, similarly, I need to avoid problematic monitors, & find a source for monitors that are similar to my old CRT or notebooks, *and* affordable. After all, I already spent $300 for this high-tech Syncmaster - who in their right minds would pay $300 to sit in the electric chair?

You have a physical problem, it is not the monitors. You need to see a doctor, preferrably an Opthamologist. Do not go to an Optometrist, they are not doctors. You may need glasses with a special type of filter to use just any monitor, but you can't do anything about changing how monitors work and are just not going to get anywhere in that direction. My mother has a PHD in the field of vision and works with people that have all different types of vision problems, based on her 50 years in the field what you describe needs to be treated by a Doctor not an Engineer.

I'll write it's doubtful you will find a person of an Engineering background that will fix your monitor. If it has a defect, then you pack it up and return it. If you have a condition that needs some special consideration, then you work with your doctor to find a solution. Your seeking of an electronics (CRT) engineer is going to frustrate you since they will not understand the medical angles. Wishing you the best luck, Bob

As for the rest of the issue, you don't get my point. I never expected an engineer to &quot;fix or change&quot; anything. Rather, I was seeking an engineer to help me get to the bottom of the mystery, & advise me what it is that old CRTs have in common with notebooks. That way, I'd know what to look/ask for when shopping for monitors. Do they have in common: (1) that they have fewer bulbs than digital CRTs/LCDs? (2) that the bulbs are lower wattage than digitals? (3) Other? My brother-in-law just gave me an older notebook computer to try out, after I mentioned my problem. He inherited it from a cousin, but he said it doesn't seem to be working. I never owned a notebook in my life. It's a 500 CS Toshiba Tecra with Intel Pentium. When I try hooking it up, a yellow lite lights up in the rightmost panel which has an icon that *seems* to look like a battery. But I don't understand why the display isn't lighting up - after all, it's plugged in... Am I missing something?

Can you print from other programs besides the web browser without a problem, what about print preview in other programs? I can't imagine any Flat panel screen that is $300 and is very high quality, that's what you get at the rock bottom end of the flat panel pricing. That old notebook sounds dead, the display's commonly go out. There is little, if any difference between a flat panel display in a laptop and a good flat panel display for a desktop.

The test printout page is also OK. Just from the browser - both preview & print are out of wack. My LCD is the Samsung Syncmaster 151s that had been highly touted, despite the $300 price tag.

While some may take offense at seperating discussions into specialised forums, this question is better fielded in the Browser, PC Applications or the OS Forum since it's unlikely to be caused by PC Hardware. Be sure to post the OS version, browser version and printers so the responding forum doesn't have to ask for that in their first response. I will note that an ongoing issue with HTML is that there is no print control. That is, what you see on the browser may have little to do with the printed output (or even the print preview.) This can rattle people that are new to HTML, but you will find that such is under discussion at http://www.w3c.org Bob Bob
