1.1.1	Dear all , I have problem with small Eprom , that can read and write the data , but it has only 2 pins .	St
1.1.2	Cause the name and mark was earase , so I could not know what is it to find .	St
1.1.3	It has three pins look like transitor , but using only two pins .	St
1.1.4	So any body know well about that Eprom can show me where can find it ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thank so much for instruction .	St
1.1.6	Le LT	St
1.2.1	Your best bet is the maker 's manual for technical repairs , shecmatics and such .	St
1.2.2	Since , you did n't mention even the product , well alot is not known .	St
1.2.3	I can only assume the eprom is special or rated for certain usage and pins are cut or made w/o them in order to fulfill its mission .	St
1.2.4	BUT , it maybe a generic ( you find one , then clip pins ) eprom done in this matter only because the OEM wants it that way .	St
1.2.5	-- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Read http : //www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/2913/ln/en for an example of such a component .	St
1.3.2	I have such in my ONE WIRE Weatherstation .	St
1.3.3	ONE WIRE evaluation kits are available from Maxim .	St

1.4.1	I read this , and I suspect you are talking about the clear Eprom header that a lot of motherboards have .	St
1.4.2	It is a three pin connector with a jumper that you pull from the one side and put across the other side to clear the EEPROM ( To reset the bios EEPROM back to the factory defaults ) I may be off base about this , but from your post I am guessing that you are not talking about a special EEPROM like the one wire EEPROM ...	St
1.4.3	If I am wrong , then never mind ...	St
1.4.4	If you are trying to clear your BIOS Eprom , then you need to look in the motherboard manual , or just look at the motherboard and find the 3 pin header with Erase marked next to the pin that is not jumpered .	St
1.5.1	I think it is one wire Eprom , if you know about it , please show me the equipment that can read and write this .	St
1.5.2	Thank you so much .	St
1.5.3	Le Long	St
1.6.1	Dear Bob , Thank you so much for showing , Can you tell me where can get Read And Write Equipment for this Eprom ?	Ques
1.6.2	Yours truly , Le Long	St
1.7.1	I have the Dallas ( now Maxim ) One-Wire WS-1 and other items .	St
1.7.2	I will not give you the exact order page since it 's something you can find with google.com , or at Maxim 's site .	St
1.7.3	Try http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=one+wire+kit Bob	Ques
