Look at it this way: Intel HT - 32 strong capable workers doing a task AMD - 64 workers doing the same task Up to you.
64bit simply is better at doing tasks, plus you can improve on it and have even more capabilities as time goes by.
Meaning, as any cpu before it, gets improved upon.
Plys 64bit is the wave of the future and so far has proved capable.
