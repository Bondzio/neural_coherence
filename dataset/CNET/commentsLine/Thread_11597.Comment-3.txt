thank you so much for your help bob.
i don't think you noticed that i said that i am a novice to computers.
i am so computer illiterate.
i think os stands for operating system, correct?
i am using windows me.
let me ask this, would it be possible to just have the one unit internal or just get the external and keep my cd rom?
also how would i know if it will fit into the space where the current piece is located?
