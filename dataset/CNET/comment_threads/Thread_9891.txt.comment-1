First off , excuse my language.
I'm from turkey.
I have a faculty project which will need to touch on &quot;Channel Allocation for Ad Hoc Wireless Networks&quot;.
I did some google search but found not much to help.
So , if anyone could refer me to a web site , a book or any document so on about this subject , i'll be one of the happiest men in the world.
Thanks already.
