1.2.1	A TV is not a PC so that 's the short reason why .	St
1.2.2	Also , many require us to install some DLNA server and that app ( DLNA server ) may only be coded to share specific folders .	St
1.2.3	You can imagine the security types would go bonkers if a TV could see all files on your PC .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	You will need to right-click on the folder ( s ) on your D : drive and select the & quot ; Sharing & quot ; tab , then enable sharing .	St
1.3.2	You may need to reboot the PC once you make the changes .	St
1.4.1	Bob , I finally solved this problem . !	St
1.4.2	I had to go into my network ( click on the little house-windows 7 ) to the PC/media devices/ & quot ; media player & quot ; and add the other drive and/or folders to the media player 's & quot ; library & quot ; .	St
1.4.3	Seems so simple yet I thought all I had to do was & quot ; share & quot ; the drive/folders I wanted to see on my TV .	St
1.4.4	At least with my TV ; it has to be in the PC 's Media player library .	St
1.4.5	The files are not physically in the library ; they are just indexed , so to speak : )	St
