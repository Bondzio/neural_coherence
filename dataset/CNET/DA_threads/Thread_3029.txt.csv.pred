1.2.1	OEM operating systems are locked to the motherboard and generally can not be transferred .	St
1.2.2	You can call eMachines about that and see if they 'd be willing to help you out , but chances are you 'd need to start looking into purchasing a new copy of Windows .	St
1.2.3	Other than that it should be a relatively smooth transition .	St
1.2.4	John P.S .	St
1.2.5	For those wondering , that is an eMachines t6420 , not a t640 .	St
1.3.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/desktops/emachines-t6420/4507-3118_7-31732646.html ? tag=sub Now you need to download the specs on the BIOSTAR and see if it supports your PC 3200 Ram at 400MHZ and if it supports your AMD 64 3400+ CPU .	Ques
1.3.2	Everything else should work .	St
1.3.3	They are however not necessarily interchangeable in the sense that you can install it and boot up your old operating system .	St
1.3.4	You may ( probably ) have to re-install , so make sure you have the necessary CD 's along with any applications .	St
1.3.5	Otherwise look for an identical motherboard as the one you had .	St
