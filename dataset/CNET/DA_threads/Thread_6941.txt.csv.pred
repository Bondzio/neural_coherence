1.1.1	About two months ago I ago took my first stab at wiring an existing cat-5e line in our house .	St
1.1.2	The line was already present , but I had to strip the cable , put on the connectors , crimp it and put on a terminating RJ-45 jack .	St
1.1.3	After some trials and tribulations I finally got it working ... at least I thought so .	St
1.1.4	I have been able to connect my laptop and some other devices successful to this new line .	St
1.1.5	My laptop is able to register with my router , get an IP address and connect to the internet and LAN .	St
1.1.6	I recently got an XBOX360 for Christmas and set it up on my network on a different line with no problem .	St
1.1.7	The XBOX was able to register and IP address , connect to internet ( XBOX Live ) .	St
1.1.8	Then I moved the XBOX to the line I created and the network status showed & quot ; DISCONNECTED & quot ; .	St
1.1.9	I tried restarting the router and several other things ( other router ports , different cables.. ) I am able to connect the XBOX on other physical lines , but not this one .	St
1.1.10	This makes me believe the connectors I put in our bad , but why would some devices not work ?	Ques
1.1.11	Devices that have worked : 2 Dell laptops , 6 .	St
1.2.1	I ca n't recall how many times I 've rewired connections because of incorrect pairing .	St
1.2.2	Widely documented but as a test , tell me what pairs to what pins you used .	St
1.2.3	Also , I test these setups for bad wiring by running my 100 ' cable from here to there .	St
1.2.4	If that works I know it 's the wiring .	St

1.3.1	Bob , Thanks for your reply .	Polite
1.3.2	I did n't think it could be incorrect pairing because I was so meticulous about that .	St
1.3.3	I did the research on the EIA/TIA-568-A/B standard and followed what my home wiring contractors did ( presumably EIA/TIA-568-A ) .	St
1.3.4	However , it appears the contractors may have created their own standard .	St
1.3.5	Here is what I used following the existing connectors : pin1 : green/white pin2 : green pin3 : blue/white pin4 : blue pin5 : orange/white pin6 : orange pin7 : brown/white pin8 : brown It appears pins 3 and 5 are reversed from the EIA/TIA-568-A standard .	St
1.3.6	I 'll make a new connector and see what happens .	St
1.3.7	Thanks for the suggestion .	St
1.4.1	The problem is while it 's electrically correct the incorrect pairs result in odd issues such as slow downloads , fast uploads and the issues you noted .	St
1.4.2	Once the wiring is sorted , there are issues with XP and limited connectivity but with the wiring issue let 's sort the hardware issue first .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I switched the pair and it 's working now .	St
1.5.2	Thanks for your suggestion !	St
