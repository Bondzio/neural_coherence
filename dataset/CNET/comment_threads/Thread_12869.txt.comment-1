this pc is my homebuilt one, mutt parts, core of the system is an amd athlon something or other.
is this a power supply problem?
my pc was doing some video processing, and it locked up, which hasnt happened in a very long time.
i power it down.
i power it up right away, the fans start spinning etc, but it dies immediately, like a car that wont start.
tried it again, same result.
unplugged all the perifs, powered up, and it seemed to run fine.
i put my hand behind the power supply on the back of the tower, and i notice a lot of heat coming out, beyond what i would expect normally i think.
time for a new power supply or possibly something else?
thanks!
