<s> Ok i am trying to update my graphics card and i am confused on what power supply i should buy first. </s>
<s> Can i have some advice on what one i should get give me a general idea on which one? </s>
<s> Or a few. </s>
<s> ASUSTeK Computer INC. System Model: CG1330 BIOS: BIOS Date: 06/21/10 17:32:37 Ver: 04.03 Processor: AMD Phenom(tm) II X6 1045T Processor (6 CPUs), ~2.7GHz Memory: 8192MB RAMAvailable OS Memory: 7936MB RAM Page File: 2580MB used, 13288MB available Windows Dir: C:\Windows DirectX Version: DirectX 11 copy and paste of dxdiag for system specs. </s>
<s> Card name: ATI Radeon HD 5450 Manufacturer: ATI Technologies Inc. </s>
<s> Assuming i get anywhere today on the power supply help me out with a graphics card as well? </s>
<s> I need pci express i believe, i can have two graphics cards on my motherboard. </s>
<s> Im looking for something nice, not state of the art but id like to be able to run newer games with out a problem i recently played arma 2 and my pc had some problems with screen lag. </s>
<s> I can spend a good amount, but i use ebay an usually save alot of money so though me out some ideas and let me know what kind of performance i could get thanks in advance to any answers i get. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card-game-performance-radeon-hd-6670,2935.html Even the Radeon HD 6670 at the near 100 buck mark is quite the upgrade here. </s>
<s> And it pulls about 124 total system Watts as noted at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-6570-radeon-hd-6670-turks,2925-15.html To see if you need a new power supply I'd use a P3 Watt Meter to see what your system draws now (that's about 20 bucks if you don't own one) then you can see if you can skip the PSU upgrade. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So two of these are better then the gtx 570? </s>
<s> They are the same price give or take a few bucks. </s>
<s> With this set up would i be able to run games like crysis in 1920x1200 with playable framerates? </s>
<s> Im trying to play higher end games. </s>
<s> I don't discuss dual video cards. </s>
<s> This is my choice on the matter. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Dual video cards are only for those that must go there and suffer the issues. </s>
<s> It's like a tar pit. </s>
<s> I don't go into tar pits. </s>
<s> Hope this explains my choice on this. </s>
<s> If you need more power, use the first link and move up the chain. </s>
<s> Then read the review on your selected card to sniff out if you need to replace the PSU. </s>
<s> Here I use the Watt meter before and after along with the PSU details on Amperes per rail to make the decision to replace or not replace a PSU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Not going into much technical detail choose any one of the following 1) Radeon HD 6870 : Or 6950 for more power 2) Any 80 plus certified psu minimum 550w :Corsair and Antech are good choice HD 6870 is a decent card. </s>
<s> My brother has it (with Intel i7) and plays all kinds of new games in HD monitor (1920x1200), with all details maxed and at decent frame rates: Get a good PSU. </s>
<s> 80 plus means 80% effeciency or higher. </s>
<s> Corsair, antech and cooler master is a good choice. </s>
<s> If your serious about this stuff it's a never ending quest for one or two more fps or to get rid of that very slight lag. </s>
<s> I have no idea what size/type psu you have now.......so just winging it. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139021 Assuming that fits in the machine it should carry you through most future upgrades. </s>
<s> The HD 6670....as mentioned...is quite a jump from where you are and may be a simple video card swap with no psu upgrade needed. </s>
<s> Might be worth a look..........depends how high up the gaming ladder you want to go. </s>
<s> Jump! </s>
<s> How high? </s>
<s> I really like the 6670 in this situation. </s>
<s> It's not a budget buster, and it's likely no PSU change is required. </s>
<s> Thanks for the added feedback. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My budget is up to 400 dollars, more if needed but i dont feel i need the newest or the best, just close to it. </s>
<s> I want to be able to run the newest games with decent fps rates maxed settings. </s>
<s> I want to play arma 2 specifically. </s>
<s> But if you are going dual cards, be sure to locate a vendor that accepts returns! </s>
<s> Are there frequent errors with them? </s>
<s> I can run 2 graphics cards and cross fire is supported. </s>
<s> I will need a new psu i believe though. </s>
<s> I know to never stray into that area. </s>
<s> If the seller won't discuss this with you, that's another clear sign. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You have what is a rather large budget for a video updgrade - much more than you need to &quot;something nice, not state of the art but id like to be able to run newer games with out a problem&quot;. </s>
<s> Your definition still leaves quite a range. </s>
<s> First I recommend you look at some general guidelines on how to upgrade a video card. </s>
<s> This site has good information about defining wants, system requirements, non-gaming and gaming cards, reviews, and installing video cards at: http://www.upgradevideocards.com/ It will give you a good general information on upgrading your video card and a link to excellent sources. </s>
<s> One top link is to the list of the best video cards at each budget level at THG - it includes a brief but very helpful description of which each will buy you: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2964.html Based on what little info you have provided, I think you are in the range of the GTX 560 - which is on the above list at the $190 level. </s>
<s> I recommend this EVGA (excellent brand) card at $175 after rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130660 You might also be interested in reading a reviews about the GTX 560 card and about mid-level cards in general: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-560-amp-edition-gtx-560-directcu-ii-top,2944.html http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-radeon-graphics,2977.html As you can see in the article about the GTX 560 - at load the total system usage was 150w - 200w at factory settings. </s>
<s> Assuming you have no other power hunger added components, you should be able to comfortably run the system with a PSU at 300w or more - although I would recommend 350w to be safe. </s>
<s> This also assumes you have a good PSU. </s>
<s> What brand and model do you have? </s>
<s> The first link above includes a page with a good but concise introduction to selecting power supplies for graphics cards at (about half way down the page: http://www.upgradevideocards.com/criteria.html </s>
<s> Get a new cooler </s>
<s> Isn'tthere a new bus coming soon? </s>
<s> pcie3.0? </s>
<s> While THUNDERBOLT is interesting, it's not getting much love. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> PCIe 3.0 specs were finished and announced last November. </s>
<s> I have read of only on mobo with them, an ASRock board only released this month. </s>
<s> Buy ATI Radeon HD 6850 it will run almost all games and the price of this card is also low </s>
