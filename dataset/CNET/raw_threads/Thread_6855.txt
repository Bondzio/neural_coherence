I am installing a linksys card in a computer and the card fits great but that bracket sticks about 2 inches above the back of the tower.... It is one of those modular towers from gateway that really sucks.....I can remove the bracket but then the card is not very secure and when I connect the Cat 5e to it the card moves a little. So back to.... Is there a place I can get another bracket for the card.....???? Thanks so much Brett
