i run an invitation business also and have been using the xerox 8560. i have found that on metallic stocks the ink does not adhere to the stock well.
you can rub it with a fingernail and it will smear/smudge (after significant drying time) or if you scratch with an x-acto knife tip it will scratch right off.
i was very happy with this printer when i first got it, but i can't have ink that will come off.
note that this only happens with the metallics, which about 95% of customers choose!
i do like the range of sizes that the multi-purpose try can handle, and the stocks i use go through fine so i am going to look at some other xerox machines this week.
i think the problem is with the solid ink on that stock.
i will post if i find something good.
i would recommend using the manual feed for all card stocks, as the pass through is straighter than from the tray.
i only use the tray for regular office printing on plain paper.
has anyone tried the ricoh c411?
