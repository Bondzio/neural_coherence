like i said my case never has the left panel fitted (left as in looking at case from front) so all this pressurized stuff, which i think is nonsense anyway no off-the-shelf case is pressurized, is irrelevant.
all i said would it hurt to reverse the cpu fan and it doesn't i've already tried it and there is no difference in heat dissipation, cpu runs at same temp.
