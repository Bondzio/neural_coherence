Read the manual or visit thier support website for such instructions and USUALLY this is a one time shot. Otherwise, contact the maker now and stress the need for restore/recovery disks. This may involve a small cost or none, exclduing S/H fee if recent purchase. FYI - Don't type in capitals, it expresses *loud talking/shouting* or emphessis in computer lingo. tada -----Willy
