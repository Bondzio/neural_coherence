<s> I have a pci express video card,and I was wondering if anyone knows if there is an adapter that will allow me to plug this card into a standard pci slot? </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> Not only didn't I find such but even if it was done the cost would be more than what we were trying to adapt to or a PCI video card. </s>
<s> To save posts I'll share I used some Nvidia 8400 and 9400 PCI cards as a last hurray upgrade. </s>
<s> I don't see it in stock today but if your power supply is 300 or more Watts try this one -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SP95GT1024D2LHP&cat=VCD Bob </s>
