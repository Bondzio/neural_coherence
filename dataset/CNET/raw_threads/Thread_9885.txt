I bought a CoolerMaster case and there doesn't appear to be an internal speaker to count the &quot;beeps&quot;. I guess my concern is compatibility even though I thought I did my homework when I purchased the hardware. My motherboard specifies that it is for an Intel Core 2 Duo. At the Asus website they mention that Core 2 Quad is supported but you have to update the bios. Below is a list of hardware I purchased. I'm hoping someone can help me out. I'm stuck. I checked to make sure everything was seated properly also. Case - COOLER MASTER Stacker RC-832-KKN1-GP Black Aluminum ATX Motherboard - ASUS P5WDG2-WS PRO Socket T (LGA 775) Intel 975X ATX Processor - Intel Core 2 Quad Pro 6600 2.4Ghz LGA775 Memory - Kingston 4GB(2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 667 (PC2 5300) ECC Registered Dual Channel Kit Server Memory Model KVR667D2D4P5K2/4G Hard drives - Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 ST3320620AS (Perpendicular Recording Technology) 320GB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s Hard Drive Power supply - COOLER MASTER Real Power RS-A00-EMBA ATX12V / EPS12V 1000W Power Supply I appreciate any help you can give. Thanks, Skitlboy

I've run into boards that need a BIOS update but you can only do that if you install the CPU that the BIOS supports. So we install a supported CPU, update the BIOS then we can install the CPU we really wanted to use. Don't ask me why the board comes with an outdated BIOS... Bob
