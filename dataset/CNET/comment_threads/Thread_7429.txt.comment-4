Think of the broadcast range of the wireless router as a big bubble with the router in its center.
You will likely find that you will maximize your wireless coverage if you place ther wireless router on the second floor, or maybe the first floor.
You can make a wired connection to the wireless router via a network cable.
This MUST be done for the initial setup of the router.
Any subsequent wireless connections will be from compouters that have WIRELESS NETWORK ADAAPTERS.
If a computer doesn't have a wireless network adapter, you can't make a wireless network connection.
There are internal wireless network adapters and external adapters.
Most newer notebooks come with an internal wireless adapter.
