I've got a Mega 100WR wireless adsl modem which I'm using to connect to the internet. Linked wireless to the modem are 1 Desktop (incl printer,scanner,2x ext hard drives and ext DVD writer) and 1 laptop. The problem I've got is that I need to connect another desktop however the distance between the current network and the new pc is too big. I've got another modem (Netgear - dg834gt) which I could use to link into the exsisting network. My problem is that I cannot get these two modems to talk to each other. Could someone please help in telling me what settings I need to do in order to get these modems to talk to each other. regards Charl

I also have ADSL Motorola Surfboard and I use Comcast service which is hooked up thru my desktop (Dell Dimension). I also have a wireless laptop, and it works ok,(Dell Latitude)but I wanted to hang out in another part of the room, naturually, so I got a cheap wireless modem (Belkin for the laptop, and purchased a very long Lan line,(about 20 to 30 feet) & hooked it up from the Motorolla Surfboard Modem (about 20 feet across the room) to the wireless Belkins modem, with the lan line (network cable) and a short one as well, to hook up one of 3 other connections. (I removed the lan line from the desktop tower, and hooked it from modem to modem, then the short one from wireless modem to laptop! I wish I could draw u a diagram. Anyway, somehow it is working. If not, get a stick and just put it in your desktop, let it set up a connection, then use it for a wireless connection in your laptop, and be sure you write down the information it gives you on the connections, or save it on notepad or wordpad. I hope this helps, and by the way, I do not have a phone line, got rid of it years ago! &quot;Nicki-188&quot;
