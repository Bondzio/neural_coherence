I backed up and reformatted the HD&gt;.. when I installed the board it wouldn't work... getting long beeps... turns out the memory from my old board didn't work, fortunately I ordered more ram to upgrade to 1 gig.. well I put the new ram in and the board works.... but it won't stay up... I installed drivers it shuts down... I run Norton it chuts down... I don't know what to do. Windows XP 512 Rosewill pc2100 512mb DDRam AMD Athlon XP 2600+ Creative soundblaster Live! Hauppage WinTV pci card The ram isn't on the compatibility list but should it be that much of an issue? one other thing I thought you might like to know is that I formatted with the old board in it and then did a quick format when I got the new board running... is this part of the issue..maybe old drivers left on the HD? I don't know... I didn't think that the RAM would be a big deal... do I need to change that as well? Thanks.. I'm stumped.

What are you options for memory on the new MB? You talk about fromatting but not about reinstalling XP. You can change a MB and just do a repair install of XP and load the new MB drivers, you will have to reactivate XP. Just try running with one stick of memory. John

I'm running one stick of 512 in slot 1.But the system is still unstable. It says in the mobo book that if I was running 2 sticks of 256 then one should be in slot 1 and one in slot 3 for max usage. Should I move the RAM into slot 3. It's 266 RAM and the bios says that it's running at 133. Sorry the last post was so sloppy I was at work and had to do something. HEHE

DDR 266 memory IS 133 MHz memory, that is clocked at both the leading and trasiling edge of the clock. Thus get memory reads as if the memory was 266 MHz, however the memory clock is really only 133 MHz. Then to make it more confusing the memory controller to set the FSB uses that actual clock [133 MHz], while elsewhere the BIOS will talk about 266 MHz memory. Regarding the two chips in slot 1 and slot 3. The mobo obviously must support dual channel memory. However not all obos implemented it the same way. In some you run dual channel by putting the same type memory in slot 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Others decided to number the slots 1,3,2,4 . Thus you must read the manual closely to see which slots you use for dual channel and which if you want two sticks to run single channel. Dual Channel gives a little better performance because it provides higher memory bandwidth for the CPU. Both single channel and double channel run at the same FSB Single channel memory bus is 64 MB wide, while dual channel is 128 MG wide, thus the higher bandwidth.
376	5	108065	1231965	1231691	Ray Harinec	6/8/05 12:31 PM	1.11823386E12	OK, just realized that you have	an AMD unit. Slightly different for Dual Channel. They only have three sockets. If you want to run Dual Channel put one stick in slot 1 [or slot 2] and the other in slot3. Looks like another problem. The manual only shows memory support down to DDR 266, although on the website it seemed to show support down to DDR 200 [PC2100].
376	6	108065	1232000	1231691	Ray Harinec	6/8/05 12:44 PM	1.11823464E12	Also in the event that you are not	aware. There are THREE AMD Athlon XP CPU's that are called 2600+ [even shows them in your manual. All require 166 MHz/266 Memory to run at full speed. One runs at 2133 MHz, one at 2075 MHz and one at 1917 MHz [that's the Barton. There is also a jumper [JP3] on the mobo that must be set for the correct speed. Page 15 of manual. That allows for a setting of 100 MHz.

The memory says that the speed is 266 but it reads 133 in the bios... here you are saying that the memory is only 100 I'm really confused.I don't mind sending the memory back for new stuff... if it'll make the puter run better... but will it work with the CPU that I have?

So let me review my posts and ask a Moderator to delete some so that I can restate if required. The explantion re garding the double data rate still applies to why you see tw different numbers, one twice the other.

Your manual provides the needed info. Two of the three versions will need 166/333 memory to run at full speed. If you decide to buy new memory, possibly you can get a better price on DDR400 [PC3200] because it seems to now be the most used. It'll run fine at 166/333. Hope that I didn't give you a migraine. I was reading a memory timing article that I saved and it had a sidebar with the memory speeds on one page, so I used that rather than my normal book. What a blunder.

Got distracted by the memory issue, and multiple versions of the CPU. Running the CPU slower really should make the system more stable. Here's a link to fairly good memory test. http://www.memtest86.com/ Run it from a floppy for a few hours, one stick at a time. Should get zero errors. Robert Proffitt says to stress the ememory a little. maybe run it a couple of MHz higher than its rating.

The overclocking was only meant for when you are running the memory from the floppy disk. Your system really isn't overclocking in a real sense then, [your memory will be, but it is below the nominal for that CPU.]

When I went home for lunch, I tried to load my DSL software it kept rebooting when the software was checking the system&quot;. After reading you e-mail and all the post between you and Ray. You kind of have a can worms here. So did the memory test run OK?? Take you system down to the basics, no addin cards except the video card. The rebooting could be that XP didn't get the drivers for the new motherboard correctly. Can you boot from the XPCD? and do a repair install? Please lets us know. John

I don't remember setting one up. Reformatted the HD with the windows CD and tried to reinstall windows... it stopped several times. Giving 'non_page_file_error' then something else and kept going to a blue screen. Giving a numeric code. Sorry, I didn't write them down. Lots of zeros though, at the bottom of the page. Said that my version of windows XP home wasn't valid. Backed up and punted and reinstalled old mobo... windows is stable, slow but stable, now but Norton won't install. I think that I need to reformat. I didn't realize how quick that other board is it was kinda slow when I first installed windows, when I put the drivers in it flies. Going to them for assistance. They won't be getting my businss when my subscription runs out. I've had other problems with that program, and my rebate card came back and gave me 3 days to respond to the rebate denial.That's it in a nutshell. Also the PSU is a 400 watt model, about 8 months old.

Thus your two sticks of PC2100 can only be put in slot 1 and 2, and you will run in single channel mode.

376	28	108065	1233798	1233571	Ray Harinec	6/9/05 1:22 PM	1.11832332E12	How do you plan to plug in the three sticks???	The manual is terrible in explaining the use of Dual Channel. For Dual Channel, with your new memory you would put one 256 MB stick in slot 1 and the other 256 MB in slot 3. That'll show 512 MB memory. Test that first. Then plug the 512 MB stick in slot 2, and let us know what happens. Reading the manual MIGHT seem to imply that you really only use two sticks, either both in the slot1 and slot2 single channel slots or one in slot 1 [or 2] and the other [of the same size] in slot 3. I have no idea hat will happen when you run the 256's in Dual Channel mode successfully, and then add the 512 to slot 2. I wouldn't expect any damage, but I have no idea how the system will handle it. Again terrible explanation in the manual. Maybe I'll find a manual for another mobo that uses the same 3 slot configuration and see what it says.
376	29	108065	1233855	1233798	rjonsolo	6/9/05 1:55 PM	1.1183253E12	Yeah you're right... the manual is less than exempliary.	That's exactly how I was gonna run them... 256's in 1&3 512 in 2. Now, will this make the CPU overclocked. Because now I'll be running DDR400 RAM 400MHz, right. But is that the right frequency? The math equasion that you gave earlier in the thread confused me. Can I have that formula and the reason that it works like that?
376	30	108065	1233866	1233855	Ray Harinec	6/9/05 2:04 PM	1.11832584E12	You will NOT be	overclocked if you set the memory speed to 166 as you should. Your CPU will only support 333 MHz FSB. Doubt it if will run at all if you set the memory bus to 400 MHz [200 MHz, sorry]. Your DDR 400 [PC3200] memory will run just fine at 166/333. The memory would also run fine at 200/400 BUT your CPU will not. If you try it, you may get a blank screen and then have no choice but to reset the BIOS to the defaults to get back in and set the memory to the correct speed 166/333.

Should I know this or would it be something that I assigned? Instead of doing a repair (I didn't know the password) I reformatted from dos... was that a good move. I thought that if I brought it down to bare bones... meaning DOS... then the reformat would be 'cleaner'. Or am I totally mistaken in this thought. Thanks, Jon
376	32	108065	1234066	1234023	Ray Harinec	6/9/05 4:04 PM	1.11833304E12	Apparently you or whoever first installed	XP they set a password for the Administrator. Only the Administrator would be allowed to repair. XP knows not DOS, but if you reformatted the drive, were you able to format the entire thing??? If when it had XP on it and IF it was in NTFS, then DOS [FDISK/format] wouldn't see it. If the disk is clean and you have a legit XP CD. Simply boot up from the CD with the XP CD in the drive. XP will allow you to format/partiton et al right from the CD.

Get DELPART and remove that foreign [to DOS] partition so that you can format in the file system that you want to use. I think that your friend is getting confused with the issue that the drive manufacturers give the size [and it IS the formatted size] in true megabytes 10 raised to the 6 th power. Windows reports it using binary megabytes, which are 2 raised to 20 th power which is 1,048,576 mega bytes, but called 1 megabyte by windows. Thus many people think they lost drive space when Windows shows fewer megabytes than the mfr said. This and your 8 GB unaccessable partition are two dirfferent things.
