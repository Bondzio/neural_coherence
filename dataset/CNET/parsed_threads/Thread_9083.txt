<s> Hi, I recently posted because my Sony DVD RW DW-D22A(OEM,made by Liteon as I learnt after I bought it)stopped writing and only sometimes read CDs,not DVDs.After trying everything Bob gently advised and having not luck,I brought it to the technician who said:&quot;Sorry,the laser is worn out like those old light tubes.Its expected after a year of use.'' </s>
<s> Im not sure if thats totally true.How can a DVD burner have so short life expectancy,right? </s>
<s> I mean,they are in the market for some years now.Its not a brand new technology.So,my question is... What do I have to do to take care of burners?Because there must be a list of dos and donts.And all along this year I was surfing the internet and paying attention to all the cd forums and sites around,but never found a list of dos and donts,or at least some care tips more than cleaning the media. </s>
<s> Would you mind giving your advice?It would be great if most of you talk about your personal experience with burners:how long did they live and how did they &quot;die&quot; and so on.Hahahaaa! </s>
<s> Well,you understand. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone, Claudia </s>
<s> Try the CD lens cleaner and then replace the drive. </s>
<s> The good news is dual layer 16X DVDRW drives are under 50 bucks so they are considered wear and tear items now. </s>

<s> I've usually mentioned in posts, many a burner lasts a yr. or expect problems if used alot. </s>
<s> Your expections should revolve around that. </s>
<s> As for keeping it usable longer, there's only a good blow-out of any collected(every now and then, 1x in a month) dust and a CD cleaner. </s>
<s> That's it. </s>
<s> Sony, makes a decent burner as well as Philips and Plextor are tops to me. </s>
<s> Any other brand while good or sufficient may not last any longer but may die sooner, so paying a few extra $ now goes for a happier user expereience. </s>
<s> I no longer even try to repair or resolve many s/w glitches but quickly replace burner to see if that cures things and usually 9 out of 10X does. </s>
<s> Older burners tend to last longer oinly because the default burning speeds were slower and generally &quot;settle down&quot; and do thier tasks within specs as things got faster, burning tasks became harder so in some cases reducing &quot;burn speed&quot; can help resolve some errors until it truly wears out. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> So the old rule of 5 years of life for any home appliance is not true for burners.I wish Id known that from the beginning.Well,knowing that any burner will live a year,now I have to check every review about burners to choose a new one.Thanks,guy! </s>
