When I turn on the computer, it shows the dell boot screen with the loading bar, but the loading bar only gets about 1/5th of the way before freezing. I cannot access setup or any other boot options. I replaced the CMOS battery but that did not do anything. I got it to boot once by unplugging my secondary hard drive and when it realized that there was a different IDE configuration it went to a new screen and from there it booted, but I have not been able to recreate this. Any suggestions? thanks.
