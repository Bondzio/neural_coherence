1.1.1	I installed a Rocketfish 900w ( RF-900WPS ) into my HP p6620f desktop for a new graphics card I was planning on getting .	St
1.1.2	I did a one for one swap .	St
1.1.3	The motherboard had a 24-pin slot so I used all 24 ( old PSU only had 20 ) .	St
1.1.4	I put in the 4-pin cpu connector on the MB too .	St
1.1.5	I put an 8-pin PCI-e connector in the PSU for when the card comes tomorrow .	St
1.1.6	I also put 2 connectors into the HDD/SATA ports that had the molex adapters .	St
1.1.7	I plugged one into the hard drive and one into the CD Drive .	St
1.1.8	I turn on the computer and the hard drive works fine .	St
1.1.9	However , there is now a protected Q : drive that says it is loaded with Microsoft Office Click-to-run 2010 and is 0 bytes in the properties summary .	St
1.1.10	There is no CD Drive now even though the drive physically opens and closes , and the HDD light flickers when I put in a CD .	St
1.1.11	The problem is , no optical drives can be found on my computer , and I have this pesky Q : drive that is n't real .	St
1.2.1	I 'm guesing you used the Molex connecter with some adapter as the old one was .	St
1.2.2	If so , then use it is connected or swap to yet another one test out on the PC .	St
1.2.3	It should work , there should n't any conflicts that I know of , unless that adapter is diferemnt from what intended .	St
1.2.4	Nowe the connectors that ypu used to the mtrbd .	St
1.2.5	should all done right , in other words no extra one until the video is instaklled .	St
1.2.6	I suggest you unplu azny unneeded ones even if a place is present for its use .	St
1.2.7	That way you eliminate the use of any until needed or presents a problem , just plug one in att ime .	St
1.2.8	I aslso refrain from any guesses here , be sure what is required at each plug-in.Teh CD drive should n't have jumpedfrom a Q one as the change was only a PSU as I understand it .	St
1.2.9	Check out that out and report back .	St
1.2.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
