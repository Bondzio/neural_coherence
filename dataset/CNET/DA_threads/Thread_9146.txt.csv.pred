1.1.1	I got my new Maxtor 300gb ultra ata hard drive.	St
1.1.2	After i plugged every thing in, i turned on the computer, then it takes like longer then usual to boot up, i just keeps on saying detecting ide master and slave.	St
1.1.3	Is it suppose to take this long to boot up?	St
1.1.4	also, the windows boot screen was taking a little longer too.	St
1.2.1	Detected as 300GB by BIOS?	St
1.2.2	What OS version?	St
1.2.3	Windows XP SP1 or later?	St
1.2.4	How is drive attached (motherboard controller, PCI card controller)?	St
1.2.5	Master or Slave?	St
1.2.6	DMA or PIO on HD controller?	St
1.2.7	(should be DMA)	St
1.3.1	ultra ata133, the system says theres 279gb max, but isnt there suppose to be 300?	St
1.3.2	I have windows xp pro with sp2.	St
1.3.3	Im using the ide thing on the motherboard, i have a 450 watt power.	St
1.3.4	Im using this 300gb hard drive as a slave.	St
1.4.1	300g unpartitioned is a whole lot to scan on boot.	St
1.4.2	I would diskpart anything over 80g for speed reasons.	St
1.5.1	so should i like partition the drive into like 150gb each?	St
1.6.1	and the 279 is primarily due to the fact that the drive mfr's report the size in decimal giga bytes, while Windows reports the size in Binary Gigabytes [higher number of bytes].	St
1.6.2	Thus divide the decimal by the Binary and you'll get the lower number.	St
1.7.1	so do i still get the full 300gb's even though it says 279gb?	St
1.8.1	Here is the explanation from Maxtor's Knowledge Base: ''Why does my hard drive report less capacity than indicated on the drive's label?''	St
1.9.1	ok so why is it still booting so slow.	St
1.10.1	Is the IDE CHANNEL that the drive is on set to DMA or PIO (see your Device Manager and look under IDE ATA/ATAPI CONTROLLERS)?	St
1.11.1	both primary and secondary say ide channel say dma in the advance settings.	St
1.12.1	Scan for viruses.	St
1.12.2	Scan for spyware with MORE THAN ONE antispyware program (try EWIDO, Spybot, Ad-Aware, MS-Antispyware Beta, SpySweeper-free trial).	St
1.12.3	For a clean system: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1819090,00.asp	St
1.13.1	i know i don't have any viruses or spyware.	St
1.13.2	I got norton,spybot,spyware blaster,ad aware, and microsoft anti spyware.	St
1.14.1	How is the drive jumpered: Master, slave, cable select?	St
1.14.2	Is it on an ATA/100/133 data cable?	St
1.14.3	Is it the only drive on the data cable?	St
1.14.4	What is slow?	St
1.14.5	Can you post a boot time (min:sec)?	St
1.15.1	after i installed my new hard drive its been booting so slow.	St
1.15.2	I takes about 2 mins to get to the log in screen.	St
1.15.3	The new hard drive is set a slave and the original is set to master.	St
1.15.4	My 2 hard drives are on the same wire.	St
1.15.5	There both ultra ata133.	St
1.15.6	Its the black screen part where the pc boots up when you turn it on thats slow.	St
1.15.7	it the part before the windows boot screen.	St
1.16.1	Set the primary boot drive as a master and the only drive on the cable.	St
1.16.2	Put all other drives on the other IDE channel (other cable).	St
1.16.3	Restart and confirm that the it is the boot drive.	St
1.16.4	Also, go into BIOS and enable fast/rapid booting if it is not enabled.	St
1.16.5	After you get it up and running Windows, check again to make sure that it is in DMA mode.	St
1.17.1	ok it now not taking soo long to boot up, but now i don't see the drive on my computer.	St
1.18.1	Drive jumpered as Master?	St
1.18.2	Drive set in master position on cable?	St
1.18.3	(end of cable) Did you set the drive that has Windows as the first/primary boot voulume/disk?	St
1.18.4	(This is done in the BIOS settings).	St
1.19.1	thank you linkit, i now doesn't take a long time to boot,i just had to swith to the second ide channel and fix the jumper... thanks a lot!	Polite
1.19.2	!	St
