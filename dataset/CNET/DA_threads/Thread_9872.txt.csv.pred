1.1.1	Hi , If i powered on the router for 24*7 , will it get overheated ?	Ques
1.1.2	Any concern ?	Ques
1.2.1	They are designed for being on permanently .	St
1.2.2	Some routers do n't even have an on-off switch - got ta unplug them from the wall .	St
1.2.3	However , this is based on normal conditions of reasonable ambient temperatures and locating the device where it has breathing room around it .	St
1.2.4	Installing it in the boiler room or burying it under a pile of stuff could result in overheating .	St
1.2.5	dw	St
1.3.1	So I moved it out from under another switch and its been happy ever since .	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	thanks for the reply how abt a modem ?	Polite
1.4.2	It has a on-off switch .	St
1.4.3	does that mean it can not be on 24*7 ?	Ques
1.5.1	you mean ur router overheated cos u powered on it for 24*7 ?	Ques
1.6.1	That was the cause and not the 24x7 operation .	St
1.6.2	Bob	St
1.7.1	as Bob has indicated , it is not the length of time it is on , rather it is whether or not it is in a place with enough ventilation for the small amount of heat to be naturally dissipated .	St
1.7.2	Putting it underneath something else will prevent the warmth from escaping into the air .	St
1.8.1	Ok ... thanks alot for the clarification !	Polite
1.9.1	Ok ... thanks alot for the clarification !	Polite
1.10.1	I had used DI-714P+ ( 802.11b ) for about a year and now have switched to DI-724P+ ( 802.11g ) for a month .	St
1.10.2	I notice that DI-724P+ generates more heat than DI-714P+ , probably because of its compact design .	St
1.10.3	Anyway they both work 24/7 reliably .	St
1.10.4	How about yours ?	Ques
1.11.1	i need to restart the router almost everytime after a long period of time of accessing internet .	St
1.11.2	what posibility may caused these happen ?	Ques
1.12.1	Is the firmware current ?	Ques
1.12.2	You did n't reveal your model number and what firmware you have in it so the forum ca n't look for you .	St
1.12.3	Bob	St
