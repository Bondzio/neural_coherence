I have been looking for a 19 inch LCD Monitor but I am finding that the ones I am trying have a tendency to give off a fuzzy (slight crosshatch) pattern when there is movement on the screen (such as in games or when I drag a window around the screen).
Does anyone have any idea what this is that I am seeing?
To my eyes, it appears as a small criss cross pattern that really is noticeable to me.
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
