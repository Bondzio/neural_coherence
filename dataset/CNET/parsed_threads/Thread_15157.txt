<s> I am about to upgrade everything in my pc so I need this question answered. </s>
<s> What is the difference between intel's 865PE chipset and the 85P chipset? </s>
<s> Which is the newer or more advanced one. </s>
<s> Please reply. </s>
<s> Why Intel? </s>
<s> Why not go for an Athlon 64 instead? </s>
<s> Imo it doesn't make sense to buy a 32 bit processor now, unless it is very low priced. </s>
<s> 865 and 875 Intel series? </s>
<s> I recall something about the 875 including what is called PAT technology which is supposed to provide a small performance gain. </s>
<s> Some MB manufacturers such as ASUS, are said to have unlocked it in some of their 865s. </s>
<s> I believe Intel calls the 875 their &quot;Canterwood&quot; and the 865 the &quot;Springdale&quot;. </s>
<s> I've read there is little performance difference, however. </s>
<s> Some say the 865s are a better value. </s>
<s> Most will now support the Intel Prescott CPUs. </s>
