hello.
here is what i am dealing with: - internet access via browser works - windows updates work - windows defender updates work - updates from within antivirus and malewarebytes don't work - tracert to data-cdn.mbamupdates.com executed in command line works - when i try to do the same via traceroute_malwarebytes_cdn application, its log has the following error: &quot;unable to initialize the windows sockets interface, error code 11003.&quot; - running eset online scanning tool (antivirus) doesn't work - asks if i am connected via proxy, which is not the case does anyone know what could possibly cause this block and how do i fix it?
i am running windows 7 64bit.
used kaspersky anti-virus 2013 but temporary uninstalled it due to this issue.
also, kaspersky 2013 and ie 9, 10 crash.
i had to rollback to ie 8 and it works just fine.
