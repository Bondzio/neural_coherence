Bob is correct but you need to know if the processor is a Coppermine or Tualatin core and which your motherboard can support.
Tualatins were late entries as the P4 release was imminent, as I recall, so older socket 370 boards did not support it.
BTW, OEM means &quot;Original Equipment Manufacturer&quot; which means these are the components PC builders buy in bulk and get a better deal.
You don't get the boxed products warranty from Intel and you do not get a fan/heatsink.
Hope that adds some helpful info.
