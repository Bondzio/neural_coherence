I was suspecting that much but wanted to get confirmation.
I do see some used components being sold online but figured that would put be back the cost of getting a cheap new one.
Also, The computer was built for me by a local store.
It has a bunch of retail parts.
So cant give you more details than in my orig post till I can open it.
I think I will start looking for New Year Sales for new computers.
Thanks again for your input.
