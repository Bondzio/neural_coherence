<s> hey guys, i'm new to PC building and i would like to know what constitutes a complete anti-static kit. </s>
<s> in other words, what are all the things i need to have / wear in order to have the peace of mind about not frying $5000 worth of hardware ? </s>
<s> also what are the types of anti-static surfaces on which i can safely build my PC ? </s>
<s> NOTE - Please try to be clear and specific in what you say. </s>
<s> I'm not too familiar with all these forum-specific 3 letter acronyms. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> a mat and wrist bracelet with a lead: http://www.radioshack.com/sm-electronics-anti-static-service-kit--pi-2102871.html frankly, i haven't used one in over 10 years and i build/rebuild about 3 PCs a year. </s>
<s> i work on tile/hardwood and touch a metal piece of any plugged in appliance to discharge any static. </s>
<s> (you can plug the power supply into the wall, and just touch it to discharge static.) </s>
<s> if you work on carpet, a plastic/rubber mat is recommended. </s>
