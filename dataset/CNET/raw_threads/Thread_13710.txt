However, the fastest processor for AMD is the FX-55 and its specs are 2600/1024/HTT. And the fastest for Intel is the Pentium 4 570J and its specs are 3800/1024/800. As Christmas nears, Intel will release a new P4EE and we will retake the market. That P4EE will be the fastest and its specs will be 3733/2048/1066 making for a speed daemon processor.

Manufacturers of MBs must be in on it too (and RAM manufactures also). The availability of the whole package is as important as it is for a single component. These new babies tend to be pricy and tempramental.

It isn't as versatile as the Intel P4EE 3.6GHz chip but it wins hands down in every other category. The lack of DDR2 however, keeps me away from the AMD chip for now. But the boards are coming. G5? I have no idea, I don't work with Macs, sorry. -Mike

1283	7	47432	1093687	1093439	John Robie	4/2/05 11:19 AM	1.11244074E12	Yes......	The AMD FX-55 is faster, but you probably have to be a spoiled rich kid, or make a pretty good wage, to buy the FX-55 from $816-$840 (processor alone - Newegg).
