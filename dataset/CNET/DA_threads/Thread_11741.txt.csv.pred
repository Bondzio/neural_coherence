1.1.1	Pardon what may appear to be a &quot;stupid&quot; question but a flat panel LCD monitor with built-in speakers; it's not necessary to hook up the speakers on the monitor is it?	St

1.2.1	You don't have to connect the speakers at all, and nothing will be the matter with that.	St
1.2.2	Just make sure the volume is kept turned all the way down on the monitor (if it has a volume setting) and ensure that the connector doesn't touch anything electrical (it will cause the speakers to hum).	Sug
1.3.1	NIL	St
