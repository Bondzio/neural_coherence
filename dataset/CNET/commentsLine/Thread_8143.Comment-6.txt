thanks for your response .

i need to ask for your patience .
.
.
as i understand it i need 1. something to convert my vhs tape to a digital format to be understood by my computer.
one solution is the card mentioned ati tv wonder pci.
another solution would be a converter like the one from dazzle .
.
.
moderately priced computer would not come with such a card but might be purchased as an option.
is firewire needed for this connection?
the dazzle 150 would need usb 2.0 which new machines note as hi-speed or usb 2.0.
2. i need software to edit the digitized home movie.
this may or may not come with a moderately priced ($1400) computer.
is this software part of windowsxp capabilities?
i don't care for the supplied windows movie maker.
you might like it.
3. i need a dvd writer to put the digitized home movie on a dvd.
yes.
just back from officemax with a multi-format dvd record that will be 79usd after rebates.
very good deal.
haven't seen what software is bundled, but it will put out a dvd that will play on the common players.
so the price is down to: 118 usd.
here's some combo that works.
1. the haupaugge tv pci capture card.
the go product is mono, but does not matter since capture is from your audio card.
you can use it's capture software to get the first step done.
it was 39 dollars at office max today.
2. a dvd recorder with bundled software.
many out there, but a multi-format unit with plus and minus media support and dvd creation software (light video editing too)  starts at 113 dollars.
i picked up the 79 dollar unit today at officemax.
maybe a trip to radio shack for a cable, but unlikely.
the host machine for a 2 hour video will have about 20gb free during the work and even my older p3-600 with 256 mb or ram could do the dvd creation overnight.
even with more ram and many more ghz of cpu, you still have to be patient.
bottomline?
this is getting a lot cheaper.
