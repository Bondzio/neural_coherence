I built this myself maybe a year and a half ago but am simplifying and moving to a Thinkpad. I was wondering if anyone could help me come up with a fair asking price. Here are the specs: -LIAN LI V COOL PC-V1000 Silver Aluminum ATX Mid Tower Computer Case (very nice case) -ENERMAX Liberty ELT500AWT 500W ATX12V Power Supply (nice modular cables) -ASUS A8N-SLI Premium Motherboard -AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+ Manchester -2GB DDR 400 (1GB sticks) -2 36GB 10,000RPM Raptors in raid 0 -2 300 GB Drives (1 IDE, 1 SATA) -Plextor DVD Burner (dual layer) -Lite-On Blu-ray drive (reader only) -Geforce 8600GTS -floppy -No OS, I'll probably throw Ubuntu on it if I can get everything working correctly -I've also got a Dell 24 FPW that I may sell separately or with the computer So, anyway, I know I can come up with an amount myself, but I'd like to get some other opinions on this. Thanks in advance.
