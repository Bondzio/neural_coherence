I have tried from recovery programs, such as ontrack's easy recovery and actives undelete, and yet i am still getting nothing back the problem started about 8 months back when everything was going great, and i forgot to &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; or hit the little green arrow before unplugging. so now the drive is not recognized, it is a RAW drive, and i cant even convert it in command prompt. every time i try to access the drive it says would you like to format now? and i always click no, because i think there might be a way to get everything back but theres a question, if i format it to be NTFS or whatever, is it possible to do a format recovery using Recovermyfiles? it would mean so much if somebody could just give a great solution to this annoying and time-wasting problem. thanks eitan
