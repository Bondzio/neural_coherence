Hello, Colleagues and I sometimes have the need to manipulate (fastforward, rewind, etc.)
up audio- and video-recordings.
Is there a device, a pedal, that will allow me to stop, start, rewind, and fastforward audio- and video-recordings without taking my hands off the keyboard?
I am transcribing interviews, and a pedal that is compatible with RealPlayer will be useful.
The computers involved are of diffent operating systems and models.
I posed this question to RealPlayer technical support, and they referred me to CNet.
Thank you, Jeffrey Lofton [Edited by: admin to remove member's phone number--Note to Jeffrey--it's probably not a good idea to post your phone number in public forum for the world to see.]
