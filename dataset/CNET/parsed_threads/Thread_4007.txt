<s> Hi All First, I would like to thank you all for the help in the past. </s>
<s> Was so far very helpful. </s>
<s> The problem I'm sitting now with is that I'm trying to split a ethernet cable. </s>
<s> What I have so far is a switch set up and working 100% with 11 computers. </s>
<s> Now there is another PC comming in and I need another Ethernet cable to that PC. </s>
<s> But my problem is that I have to go through walls and other obstacles. </s>
<s> I want to save some time and money on this, so I thought of splitting the cable. </s>
<s> What I have tried was, one cable that I know is working. </s>
<s> I took that point, and plugged it in to a wallbox, and then took 2 fly leads and punched them into that same wallbox. </s>
<s> Now when I connect the 2 fly leads comming out of the wallbox to the 2 PC's, the light on the back of the cards, goes on and off, and the connection shows &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot;. </s>
<s> This tells me that that method of splitting is not working. </s>
<s> All I need to know is why not?? </s>
<s> I'll be putting in another switch and work it from there, which I'm busy with, but I would like to find out why my trick didn't work out. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> But if you're trying to separate the pairs within an ethernet cable and run two digital signals through it, that isn't going to work. </s>
<s> Sure, only two of the 4 pairs are needed for data but that doesn't mean the other two pairs are just wasted. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you'd see transmit and receive pairs only. </s>
<s> Someone here might be able to explain why the unused pairs in the 8 wire system are required. </s>
<s> Perhaps it's hardware handshaking or some such. </s>
<s> I really don't know....but you need all 8 and not just 4. </s>
<s> No splitting or cable, Y connectors or un-twisting longer than necessary. </s>
<s> Never will work. </s>
<s> Each device is assigned a specific IP address. </s>
<s> Splitting the cable does two things. </s>
<s> Reduces the current/power to the device and connects two devices where one is expected. </s>
<s> It won't work. </s>
<s> Trick is correct. </s>
<s> This trick won't work. </s>
<s> Look into 3Com's IntelliJack systems These are basically small switching devices that fit into the wall and can split the signal that way. </s>
<s> They can operate on off of an AC adapter or by using PoE. </s>
<s> Thanks, I had good time with this forum, must say. </s>
<s> And also worth a try, as I hoped actually it will work, cause I realy don't want to run that cable again. </s>
<s> But, I've connected a small second hand 4port switch, and that seems to help, and I have space for another 2 cables to fit in case I need more. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time guys. </s>
<s> I appreciate it a lot </s>
