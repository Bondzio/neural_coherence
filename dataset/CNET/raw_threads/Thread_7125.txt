That processor my windows and my PC read it ''2.4GHz ~ 1.6GHz'' !!! http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9359/processor14be.jpg http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/5025/directxcheck6wk.jpg http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/8062/cpuztester1qr.jpg In that pictures U can c what I got !!! So, Anybody have idea why that happend?!?! I updated my BIOS and nothing happend... No jumpers in my GIGAbyte 8IG1000 Motherboard to change... So, what is it?!!!

1967	2	112781	1281174	1281138	magicboy000	7/5/05 3:30 PM	1.1205774E12	what's the multiplier?!?!	First: what's the Multiplier?!?!! Second: what is the BIOS defaults??! Do U mean &quot;Load Fail safe Defaults&quot; in the setup menu?!!

All I did that I found a way to increase the frequancy of the processor from 133 to 200 and when I start now it gives me 200x12=2.4GHz instead of 133x12=16GHz So, anyway to make the (12) -&gt; (18)?? or that's it?!!

No motherboard that supports Intel cpus gives you the option to change it because it's locked on most Intels. I have heard of a few motherboards giving you the option *and even then you can only change it if it's one of the rare unlocked Intels* but I don't remember what they were.

It sounds like Intel gave you a faulty CPU, making the multiplier too low. It may be still under warranty, so try to get a replacement. If you can't and wish to keep your motherboard, this one will give you almost the same performance: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819112186

If I were you, I would determine if it was a developer's chip first before RMAing it. If it was, I would sell it to the highest bidder, lol.
