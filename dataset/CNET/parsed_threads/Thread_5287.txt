<s> Good Day, I was wondering what was the best way to clean a dvd burner or dvd rom drive. </s>
<s> Can you use Cleaning disks, Compressed Air,etc. </s>
<s> I have a Dvd Rom/CD-+RW burner and a Dvd Burner. </s>
<s> They need to be cleaned, but I need some advice first because I don't want to accidently ruin the drives. </s>
<s> Any Advice? </s>
<s> Thanks.. </s>
<s> Disassemble and clean the old fashioned way with qtips and alcohol. </s>
<s> Modern way is to toss the cleaner CD in and let it do its thing. </s>
<s> With dual layer 18X lightscribe DVDRW drives at under 35 bucks we can't have the techs do this right anymore. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
