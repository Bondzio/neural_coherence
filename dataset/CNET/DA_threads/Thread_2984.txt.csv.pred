1.1.1	I use 3 external storage drives : 1 - Western Digital ( WD ) passport 250gb 2 - HP Simple Save 500 gb 3 - Apple Ipod Nano 4gb I have 2 computer which I will name : 1 - Old PC 2 - New PC -both running on windows 7 ultimate I use these 3 on separate occasions and they 've worked fine for months on the old pc .	St
1.1.2	Then , I purchased another one and was also able to use the same drives for a couple of weeks .	St
1.1.3	Then one day , ( out of nowhere ) , the PCs failed to recognize the WD hard drive .	St
1.1.4	When I plug it in , the light on the WD would turn on , and the pc balloon & quot ; USB NOT RECOGNIZED & quot ; would pop up .	St
1.1.5	The next day , both the HP and the NANO also became unrecognizable .	St
1.1.6	I do n't recall installing any new software/etc .	St
1.1.7	nor dropping the hard drives or getting them wet or whatever .	St
1.1.8	I tried plugging them in on several other computers , and the same problem : USB DEVICE NOT RECOGNIZED .	St
1.1.9	A few days after , I observed that my NEW PC also became faulty .	St
1.1.10	It would have Blue Screens every now and then , or sometimes when I start up , windows explorer would hang .	St
1.1.11	Now , I 've tried scanning for viruses using different software , GetDataBack program also wo n't recognize them , and have tried using tune-up-utilities and UniBlue Powersuite but to no avail .	St
1.1.12	.	St
1.1.13	The computer still had problems , and the drives are still unrecognizable .	St
1.1.14	I had a friend ( who 's good with computers ) check my pc and he said that the NEW PC probably had hardware problems since it had static when he opened the casing .	St
1.1.15	But he had no idea regarding the status of my hard drives and could n't really say if it was caused by the NEW PC problems .	St
1.1.16	I 'll be sending the pc back to where I bought it to have it fixed but for now I 'd just like to know if : -Is this directly related to the my Hard drives becoming unrecognizable ?	Ques
1.1.17	-If not , what 's wrong with them ?	Ques
1.1.18	-How can I fix them and save not only the hard drives ( which cost a lot of money ) but my files as well ?	Ques
1.1.19	Note : *Western Digital - & quot ; USB not recognized & quot ; balloon pops up when plugged in .	St
1.1.20	- Light turns on .	St
1.1.21	No Clicking sound ( i 've read in other threads that theirs have clicking sounds but mine does n't so i guess that 's a good thing .	St
1.1.22	- Device Manager : Under USB Controllers - Unknown Device ( updating the driver wo n't work since the computers says it 's up to date .	St
1.1.23	tried uninstalling then installing , no use ) .	St
1.1.24	- Device Status ( under unknown device properties ) : & quot ; Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems .	St
1.1.25	( Code 43 ) & quot ; - Disk Management : not detected .	St
1.1.26	*HP Simple Save - no pop-up balloon .	St
1.1.27	as if it was n't plugged in .	St
1.1.28	- Light turns on .	St
1.1.29	No Clicking sound .	St
1.1.30	- Device Manager : not detected .	St
1.1.31	- Disk Management : not detected .	St
1.1.32	*Ipod NANO - no pop-up balloon .	St
1.1.33	as if it was n't plugged in .	St
1.1.34	- not recognized by iTunes .	St
1.1.35	- Will work as an mp3 player , but wo n't charge or ca n't be recognized when plugged into the computer .	St
1.1.36	This is very odd and frustrating .	St
1.1.37	I hope someone can shed some light on my dilemma .	St
1.1.38	I would n't want to buy hard drives or replace my nano since that would cost me a lot ! !	St
1.1.39	and my files are also important .	St
1.2.1	First thing to do : get the disk out of the enclosure into a new one .	St
1.2.2	See if that works on a third PC .	St
1.2.3	If so , the disk and the data are saved for some USD 20 .	St
1.2.4	That 's cheap .	St
1.2.5	Now make a backup of that data on DVD or another hard disk .	St
1.2.6	That 's safe .	St
1.2.7	Repeat three times for three disks .	St
1.2.8	Kees	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the quick response .	St
1.3.2	That might work but take for instance the ipod nano .	St
1.3.3	I ca n't buy another case for that.. Any other thoughts ?	Ques
1.4.1	If it 's damaged in such a way that it does n't even function in any other PC or Mac ( not even after a reset ) you need repair or ( most likely ) replacement .	St
1.4.2	Kees	St
1.5.1	what do you mean by reset ?	Ques
1.5.2	How can I do that ?	Ques
1.6.1	1 .	St
1.6.2	Try it on a third PC .	St
1.6.3	2 .	St
1.6.4	Still broken ?	Ques
1.6.5	Buy a new one or have the old one repaired .	St
1.6.6	Kees	St
1.7.1	I 'm using a WD Passport 320GB and a Seagate 160GB and know how frustrating it gets .	St
1.7.2	I encountered this problem a while back and seriously there was no problem with the Hard Drives .	St
1.7.3	The problem was actually in the form of a faulty USB hub .	St
1.7.4	The clicking sound as you mentioned is nothing but low voltage .	St
1.7.5	Due to it , there is not enough voltage to make the Disk run and the disk tends to restart .	St
1.7.6	As for non-detection of ext-HDD 's it is a minor glitch that is taken care of by rebooting , provided that your PC has n't stayed ON for long .	St
1.7.7	Even your problem still persists , firstly remove all related device drivers ( This should be pretty simple if you are using Win 7 ) .	St
1.7.8	Reboot it again and check .	St
1.7.9	If you still get the errors open the cabinet and and check whether the USB cables connecting on the motherboard .	St
1.7.10	These are the only things I could come up with since I had the same type of problem and got it fixed - While doing hardware changes , the cable for USB was left lose .	St
1.7.11	I hope it works out for you .	St
1.7.12	Right now I 'm facing a similar kind of problem but it is with the ext-HDD and my LCD TV ...	St
1.7.13	It detects pendrives , but not ext-HDD ...	St
1.7.14	I wonder why ... Tell me when you have a breakthrough ... ... pruthvibhushan @ yahoo.co.in	St
1.8.1	I agree with pruthvibhushan .	St
1.8.2	That clicking is low voltage .	St
1.8.3	I 'm taking it that your & quot ; old PC & quot ; is running 1.0 USB , which does n't have the power for newer externals .	St
1.8.4	Add to that , your power supply has n't the umph to push out the juice ( so to speak ) .	St
1.8.5	Why it stopped working all of a sudden could be anything .	St
1.8.6	You 're running updates to programs which blow past your old drivers & USB 's , to you having too much of a load on the house outlet/APS/UPS .	St
1.8.7	Why your & quot ; new PC & quot ; is having problems with these drives may be an issue with the drive , I agree .	St
1.8.8	On your & quot ; new PC & quot ; is it a completely new PC , or an older tower/case ?	Ques
1.8.9	Why I ask is if you plug your front connections into a new board ( mother ) , from an old tower/case , those leads are still old , not new .	St
1.8.10	I have that issue with the one tower I use .	St
1.8.11	All of my externals are plugged into the rear , alone .	St
1.8.12	Additionally , you should n't run externals ( drives ) off a hub .	St
1.8.13	They require a separate power supply , as well as USB .	St
1.8.14	That is , they do n't like to share .	St
1.8.15	Which is good , in the event that data crosses paths .	St
1.8.16	Do n't laugh , it happens ( less now than long ago ) .	St
1.8.17	I 'd look into the computers on hand first .	St
1.8.18	Perhaps your drives are mislabeled between computers ?	Ques
1.8.19	When I swap externals , it is registered to that computer with the same letter , if , I 'm going to be doing a bunch of serious file saving & swapping .	St
1.8.20	But this is more for different OS versions , when I 'm running anything less than NTFS on the external .	St
1.8.21	Please let us know the outcome .	Sug
