<s> I have a idotconnect metal gear box 3.5&quot; Hard drive. </s>
<s> The box reads 3.5&quot; IDE TO USB 2.0/1394A I lost the power adapter for this hard drive and ALL my stuff is on it.. it's 6-PIN and it says &quot;DC IN&quot; where it plugs in to the Hard Drive. </s>
<s> I've been googling this company, the product, the adapter.. </s>
<s> I cant find anything with this PIN layout.. is this a typo?? </s>
<s> I found something similar, with the 5V and the GND Reversed.. SEE PIC BELOW http://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i440/grimlocksmom/Photoon2011-04-06at23542.jpg </s>
<s> Get a new enclosure. </s>
<s> I owned a few of those speed metal drives and that enclosure is not special. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Having your link explains alot(thanks). </s>
<s> As Robert offered, replacing the enclosure would be the better fix &quot;if&quot; you can't find another AC wart. </s>
<s> Plus, the cost may push you into getting a new enclosure anyways, if you found one. </s>
<s> I also consider this an unique adapter, because of the dual-voltages, so it becomes harder to replace. </s>
<s> Check these links: http://www.alleletronics.com http://www.bgmicro.com -OR- google away for surplus or used parts vendors. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I just need to get the data off this hard drive first.. but I need to power it up! </s>
<s> what should i be searching for? </s>
<s> is there a specific name for this kind of adapter? </s>
<s> and plug it into a port on your computer's motherboard. </s>
<s> It should be either IDE (PATA) or SATA, If no port is available, disconnect one from such as a CD ROM or secondary hard drive. </s>
<s> Plug that drive in and pull off what you need. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> As explained to you the simple fix was to replace the enclosure. </s>
<s> The new enclosure would have the required AC adapter. </s>
<s> You swap HD out and then use the new enclosure to access data. </s>
<s> Once done, you have the new enclosure as a working ext. </s>
<s> HD again. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work provided all was done correctly, then you have some true or 2ndary fault to deal with. </s>
<s> Also, Steven's suggestion to gain access for data alone, provided you have the required port and cabling, use a desktop PC and mount it as an int. </s>
<s> HD in proper setup. </s>
<s> Either way will work to gain access to data. </s>
<s> Try this one. </s>
