It's not on compaqs driver/support page with all the other drivers for this computer, and I can't figure out what kind of board this is.... can someone help me with this? Thanks. C.

Compaq Presario SR1417CL Desktop PC(English)...this is the closest I could even find http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?lc=en&cc=us&dest_page=softwareCategory&tool=softwareCategory&dlc=en&product=501557 Looks to me like the only way to get the drivers is thru COMPAQ.

4483	6	172977	2043715	1907854	selvesterson	7/2/06 3:31 PM	1.15185426E12	it's onboard and I still haven't found it yet.	I don't have the start up disks that came with it. I have a new version of XP installed... I called Microsoft and got an activation code from referencing the number on the sticker... but I have to go to compaqs site to find the drivers and they just aren't there. I've downloaded so many different video drivers and I just can't find the right one.
