i wouldn't recommend a celeron D for a gaming box.
here's a representative benchmark... google for more: http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/879/12/page_12_benchmarks_quake_4/index.html if your budget only allows $100 for a CPU and you're going with intel, then celeron D is your only option.
up your budget to $140 and get a pentium D 805 (2.6ghz dual core).
