1.1.1	I 'd like opinions on the NVidia FX 5900 XT vid cards ( specifically Chaintech 's , if possible . )	St
1.1.2	I 'd like to upgrade from my ti4200 ; correct me if I 'm wrong , but is the fx 5900 xt , just below the & quot ; Ultra & quot ; series ?	Ques
1.1.3	I 'm a gamer , but not a super hardcore one .	St
1.1.4	I 'd just like some better fps , and nicer detail in games like Far Cry , which I 'm currently playing .	St
1.1.5	The fx 5900 's need external power ; I have a 450 watt PSU , so I do n't think powering the card is an issue ( also have 2 HDD , 2 optical drives , and a FDD . )	St
1.1.6	specs for the card can be found here : http : //www.chaintech.com.tw/tw/eng/product_spec.asp ? MPSNo=14 & PISNo=255 My local pc vendor is willing to sell me the card for $ 178 ; online prices range from $ 178- $ 215 , so I 'd be getting a good price .	St
1.1.7	Would appreciate input as to how well this card runs from anyone who has it ; good gaming card , 3D , FPS ?	Ques
1.1.8	Heat issues ? .	Ques
1.1.9	All input appreciated .	Polite
1.1.10	Oh , running XP pro w/AMD 2000+ chip , 512 ram @ 266 FSB , motherboard supports 8X .	St
1.1.11	TIA !	St
1.2.1	Speakeasy forum .	St
1.2.2	There is a guy named John Robie that is an avid gamer He 's in SE all the time .	St
1.2.3	Does n't seem to show in the technical forums very much any more .	St
1.2.4	I 'm certain that he 'll be able to help you or steer you to help .	St
1.2.5	I just bought a Chaintech Ge Force MX 400 , so I 'm probably up to where you were three years ago .	St
1.2.6	LOL	St
1.3.1	At least the force is with you .	St
1.3.2	I am still with my steath3 s540 ( talk about old ! ) .	St
1.3.3	Hey Brandon , you got to stop doing these thing .	St
1.3.4	You know what always happen when you tinker with your computer .	St
1.3.5	LOL .	St
1.4.1	goto www.tomshardware.com go in there graphics/display section and look in VGA Charts III The GeForce FX 5900XT is the GeForce FX 5900SE ... they same thing , but they are actually the lowest 5900 Card , it goes like this GeForce FX 5950 Ultra ^ ^ GeForce FX 5900 Ultra ^ ^ GeForce FX 5900 ^ ^ GeForce FX 5900XT/SE The XT is a good card , not great but for $ 178 you should go for a $ 195 MSI RX9800 ( Radeon 9800 128MB ) It 's going to be faster and turn back better performance in AA/AF ... otherwise the 5900XT/SE can keep up rather fine to the 9700Pro or 9800np ( non-pro ) If you do n't want AA/AF go for the 5900XT for $ 178 If you want AA/AF goto newegg and pick up the 9800Pro ... IMO that would be best deal , if AA/AF is n't an issue with you than by all means go for the slightly less expensive and still very fast 5900XT ...	St
1.5.1	Decided I did n't want to wait .	St
1.5.2	The guy that owns the store told me he 'd eat the card if Far Cry did n't play well .	St
1.5.3	First the good news .	St
1.5.4	Took 10 mins to install card , Nvidia drivers and OS picked up card right away .	St
1.5.5	Fired up Far Cry , beautiful graphics .	St
1.5.6	Now the bad news .	St
1.5.7	I had to of course pull all the cables out to get inside my tower .	St
1.5.8	I 've now lost the use of my usb hub , which also means I ca n't use any attached peripherals , including my wireless keyboard .	St
1.5.9	The ps/2 KB works for everything EXCEPT the game !	St
1.5.10	( You called it , Art ) .	St
1.5.11	I ran into this problem once before , and Ed O'Daniel suggested a fix for me , but I ca n't remember what the heck it is .	St
1.5.12	Guess it 's google time ... .Will let ya know how it goes ... . : :sigh : : : :	Ques
1.6.1	It took 8 hrs .	St
1.6.2	after installing the card to get any keyboard functionality back .	St
1.6.3	Then another 5 hrs .	St
1.6.4	the following day to get the vid card to not lock up .	St
1.6.5	After alot of googling , I found a bunch of hits that said *not* to install drivers above 60.85 ... but I did n't have that and had to go to the Chaintech site in Taiwan to d/l that for my particular card- which took over 12 hrs .	St
1.6.6	I did n't have the NVidia drivers cuz the disk cracked when I took it out of the case .	St
1.6.7	I sent an email to Chaintech about which drivers I should get , and they said to go to the NVidia site and d/l the same drivers ( ver .	St
1.6.8	61.77 ) that locked everything up on me .	St
1.6.9	DUH !	St
1.6.10	Well , everything looks good now , Far Cry looks absolutely fantastic compared to what I had with the ti4200 ( still a good card , imo . )	St
1.6.11	I probably would have gotten a card a notch or 2 better , but this was the best card I could buy locally .	St
1.6.12	Oh , well- guess I 'll do that on my next system , which could be before the end of the year .	St
1.6.13	I want to see how the AMD socket 939 boards do , and may go the AMD 64 bit route .	St
1.6.14	Strange that my ti4200 card accepted the 61.77 drivers , while I got the & quot ; unsigned driver & quot ; message on the new card .	St
1.7.1	Are you doing any video works with this computer ?	Ques
1.7.2	I was just wondering if this card help at all for that purpose ( not that I can afford one..lol ) .	St
1.8.1	I have a TV tuner card for recording tv shows , and sometimes burn them to a RW disk and watch them at work , lol .	St
1.8.2	I use the tuner card to capture analog vids I 'm slowly archiving to DVD .	St
1.8.3	I use the firewire port from the Audigy SoundBlaster bay to capture vids from my digital video camera .	St
1.8.4	So the new card does n't factor into my video capturing stuff .	St
1.8.5	The new card seems to be working well , but not at highest resolution settings , but I can live with that .	St
1.8.6	Could be my system is n't fast enough to pump out the frame-rates I wanted ?	Ques
1.8.7	On a different note , I went back to the shop where I bought the card , and told the guy to & quot ; start eating & quot ; cuz he promised me the card would run great at highest settings , and if it did n't he said he 'd eat the card .	St
1.8.8	I was just busting his chops .	St
1.8.9	We both agreed it 's probably my system ( I told him I wanted to buy a higher end card ; he told me to stop wasting my $ $ , lol ) .	St
1.8.10	To make up for my troubles , he gave me a brand new Motorola cable modem I almost bought at Circuit City yesterday for $ 60 after a rebate .	St
1.8.11	My isp just upgraded broadband download speeds to 7MB/sec ( !	St
1.8.12	) , so I do n't have to rent a cable modem anymore .	St
1.8.13	Good deal , huh .	St
1.8.14	Do kinda wish in retrospect that I got a higher end card , but the guy probably did me a favor by not selling me one , lol .	St
