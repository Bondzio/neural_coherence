It's been disconnecting a lot and occasionally the wireless Internet connection is unusually slow. I know that it's a poor quality router and that Linksys stopped supporting it in 2004. I was wondering if anyone would recommend a good router that isn't prone to disconnections. Thanks.

Scan for viruses AND spyware Use latest router firmware Use latest network adapter drivers Use latest network adapter firmware (some models). Enable SSID Try different channels (1, 6, or 11 first) Use security to keep neighbors off your network. Move portable phones and microwave ovens away form router. Computer is too far from router/access point--move router to more centrally located position. There are good routers from Linksys, DLink, and Netgear here in the USA. A wireless-g model should be good for now. If you need a stronger signal, consider the highly rated MIMO routers.
