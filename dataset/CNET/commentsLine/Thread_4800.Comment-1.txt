i had to send my computer out to geek squad due to it wouldn't start.
they replaced my video card, for which it took them 5 weeks, and i finally got it back last week.
now my computer is booting and running very slowly and my usb 2.0 ability has disappeared, and i only have usb 1.0 abilities.
it is taking my 160 gig ipod 5 x's as long as normal to sync.
anyone who can unlock this mystery would be very much appreciated.
