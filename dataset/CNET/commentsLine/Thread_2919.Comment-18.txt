i own 3 macs and a pc, and in the last five years i've had to replace 2 hard drives on my pc and one in one of my mac laptops.
the first pc failure was out of the blue -- i booted up one morning and it just wouldn't recognize the hard drive.
it was replaced under warranty, and even though the techies swore that the drive was toasted i made sure to get the original drive back so i could crack it open and destroy the media inside; no need to risk my personal data being taken off of it.
on a lark i decided to purchase a hard drive enclosure and see if i could read the old drive... good thing!
i've been using the original drive as a secondary hard drive for the last five years without trouble!
i was even able to get all of my data off of it.
so for the cost of a $20 enclosure i learned that techies don't know everything.
the other times i was lucky enough to recognize the first signs of trouble and back up my hard drive in time to prevent the loss of any data.
i now have two external hard drives -- both from the crash of my pc drives that techies swore were no good.
when my mac drive crashed, it made a really bad screeching noise, so i'm didn't bother trying to salvage that one!
