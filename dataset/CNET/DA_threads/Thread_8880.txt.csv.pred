1.1.1	I 'm not really a computer person but my grandmother recently asked me to help her pick out a new computer .	St
1.1.2	I really want to make sure she gets something that will suit her needs and not give her any trouble .	St
1.1.3	Here 's what is important for it to have : Reliability .	St
1.1.4	Good customer support .	Sug
1.1.5	Ability to read digital camera media cards .	St
1.1.6	Sufficient speed to watch videos online .	St
1.1.7	Sufficient memory for her pictures ( she does n't take a ton of them , though , so I imagine 320GB would be enough ) .	St
1.1.8	CD/DVD burner .	St
1.1.9	Windows 7 .	St
1.1.10	Small size tower would be nice .	St
1.1.11	What 's not important : Multimedia capabilities : She does n't even have an HD TV in the house .	St
1.1.12	Gaming capabilities .	St
1.1.13	Blu Ray .	St
1.1.14	Upgrade-ability .	St
1.1.15	The most important thing is that it will be reliable .	St
1.1.16	She knows nothing about computers and I live a ways away so she always has to pay someone to look at her computer when something goes wrong .	St
1.1.17	She would also like to keep the price under 500 $ , but at or under 400 $ would be better ( tower only ) .	St
1.1.18	Many Thanks !	St
1.2.1	If I were in the marker for a new desktop and ws not going to build one myself , I would probabally buy an Asus brand from a reliability standpoint .	St
1.2.2	Whatever you do , stay away from anyting HP or Compaq .	St
1.2.3	Their hardware reliability is absolutely horrible .	Polite
1.2.4	The specs may compare , but is the quality of the parts that matter .	St
1.3.1	there are quite a few options .	St
1.3.2	Maybe get a slim tower with monitor deal at one of the big-box retailers .	St
1.3.3	you might consider finding a desktop someone does n't need and loading a linux distro , it should suit her needs and may be less complicated than windows .	St
1.3.4	I do n't think brands matter too much for desktops .	St
1.3.5	For laptops I would be more leary of reliability because parts are n't easy to replace .	St
1.3.6	The only 2 parts that may differ by who made your motherboard is the motherboard and power supply .	St
1.3.7	Almost all the companies will have a generic psu ( so no difference ) .	St
1.3.8	All companies will probably use a custom motherboard too .	Sug
1.3.9	As for the quality of the motherboard being less than that you can get if you build yourself , yes its true .	St
1.3.10	But I think they 're on par with the other value motherboards you can buy albeit with a custom bios and less features .	St
1.3.11	I think you 'll find most motherboards use the same materials and the markup on boards are for enthusiasts who are willing to pay a premium for gimmicks and the latest tech .	St
1.3.12	The profit margins for higher end stuff are a lot larger than for the value/mainstream market , but that does not mean if it costs more it 'll be more reliable .	St
1.4.1	I read these FORUMs regularly and do n't see an extraordinary number of complaints or failures on HP machines ... .regardless of platform .	St
1.4.2	Most of what I read here is people writing about upgrading the video card or RAM in their HPs .	St
1.4.3	So what is your basis for saying ... 'Their hardware reliability is absolutely horrible . '	St
1.4.4	?	Ques
1.4.5	How many HPs have you had ?	Ques
1.4.6	Are n't a fair number of the HP motherboards made by ASUS ?	Ques
1.4.7	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	Today your consumer machines are five year designs .	St
1.5.2	Once you get over that you understand you need to think of this as rent and act accordingly as well as maintain backups of what you ca n't lose .	St
1.5.3	To go beyond 5 years we 'll have to implement a maintenance system that the maker cycles parts out as they approach the usual MTBF hours .	Sug
1.5.4	Sadly this means the cost tends to go up about 10x of what you could spend with a normal replace a machine when it breaks cycle .	St
