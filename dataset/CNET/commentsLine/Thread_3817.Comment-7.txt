perhaps my celebration was too premature.
i ran generals again and it froze.
i wonder if it's a card issue.
or if i haven't really disabled the integrated video or the driver sweeper program is a bust.
any ideas?
i still am not sure how to disable the bios video.
a side note in case any one has any ideas.
i still can't install age of empires 2 get's to the 51% and stops installing.
it can't be the disc because i have two copies and both give the same results.
