<s> My Gateway has an onboard graphics chip. </s>
<s> I wanted to upgrade it so I bought an XFX 8600GT PCI Express Nvideo card. </s>
<s> It worked for about 5 months, then it died. </s>
<s> I could still hook up the monitor to the onboard graphics chip and it worked. </s>
<s> Next, I bought a Sapphire 8650 PCI Express ATI card. </s>
<s> It worked fine about 3 weeks and then it failed. </s>
<s> Again I can still hook up the monitor to the onboard graphics chip, but of course its graphic capabilities are slow. </s>
<s> Can my motherboard be frying graphic cards? </s>
<s> I am afraid to buy another one for fear it will fry after a couple of days. </s>
<s> I returned the XFX card under warranty and eventually they will send me another and I can try that one, but who knows how long that will last. </s>
<s> Anybody has any ideas? </s>
<s> My hunch is power supply, that you're under-powering the system. </s>
<s> I recently replaced a stock PSU in a Gateway. </s>
<s> It rated 300W. </s>
<s> Graphics cards like you're describing may prefer 400-450W. </s>
<s> It might be heat, too. </s>
<s> Keep the insides of your tower clean, and be sure it's where it can breathe ok. </s>
<s> Go to gateways web site and go to support, select type of computer and find your model. </s>
<s> It will list EVERYTHING about your ride, including power supply. </s>
<s> Most gateways have a 300 watt PSU. </s>
<s> The fx and a few multi-media will have 400 watters. </s>
