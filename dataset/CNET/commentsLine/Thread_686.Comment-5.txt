the nice thing about the free version of  's free version is that it won't let you do anything dangerous.
on some drive/controller configurations it won't display the smart attributes; but, the error scan will simply read the entire drive at the sector level.
it will take over an hour to check a 500gb drive; but, even one red box is notice of impending failure and i recommend running it about once a year for safety.
