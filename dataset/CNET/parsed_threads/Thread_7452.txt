<s> I have an AOPEN cd burner(CRW1632) that I want to put in my computer-It is a Vision PC-model P6STP-FL,intel celeron processor-1.00ghz-376mb of ram.How do I go about installing it,do I need other cables?It is an older computer(2001)Any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> The Vision website wasn't very helpful. </s>
<s> But this shouldn't be too much of a problem. </s>
<s> I do need more info before I can give you the proper instruction. </s>
<s> Expecially if you aren't used to getting into your machine. </s>
<s> I need to know how many harddrives and cdroms are installed on your system. </s>
<s> Also, tell me a little bit about your experience in taking apart systems. </s>
<s> Let me know. </s>

<s> Hi,thanks for the reply.I am a relatively capable installer.I have installed memory,and can take the side off the computer easily.It has one CD ROM(52x max),one harddrive (I guess) </s>
<s> OK. Take the side cover off the system and lay it on its side with the motherboard on the bottom. </s>
<s> If there is only one ribbon (flat) cable leading to the motherboard, determine that there is a &quot;secondary&quot; IDE connector on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Earlier motherboards place these connectors side-by-side. </s>
<s> If only one ribbon cable is used: Obtain another ribbon cable and install it with the new drive in an empty bay. </s>
<s> Either put the jumpers located in the rear of the drive at &quot;master&quot; or &quot;cable select (CS)&quot;. </s>
<s> Power up the system. </s>
<s> Install the CD that came with the drive, using the other CDROM. </s>
<s> Reboot and your new drive should be ready to go. </s>
<s> If two ribbon cables are used: You should connect the new drive on the same cable as the current CDROM. </s>
<s> Determine how the old drive is set by the jumpers. </s>
<s> You have a choice here. </s>
<s> Either make them both CS or one Master and the other Slave. </s>
<s> Do not make one CS and the other Master/Slave. </s>
<s> Windows doesn't like that. </s>
<s> Always make sure the system is unplugged when you do anything with the motherboard. </s>
<s> Hope this helps and let me know if you are confused about ANYTHING! </s>

<s> That should get the drive working. </s>
