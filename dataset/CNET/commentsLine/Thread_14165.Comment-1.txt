i'm about to buy a new videocard.
with my budget, i've decided on a sapphire built ati radeon 9600xt 256mb.
can anyone offer any advice here, does anyone who has this card recommend it or want to slag it off.
i've got about 120 to spend.
the system i'm using is an asus a7v600, thoroughbred 2400+ xp 266fsb with 256mb of ddr ram (although this will increase to 512 in the next couple of days).
any help is apreciated
