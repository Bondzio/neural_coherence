1.1.1	I have a 3 port Via 6306 chipped 1394 card , which I am installing under XP Pro .	St
1.1.2	XP ids the card with its native Via drivers but also adds a 1394 Net Adapter which is disabled in Network Adapters .	St
1.1.3	It seems XP alone adds this networking functionality because the same card in 98SE and W2K does not .	St
1.1.4	I thought I read something about a patch which addressed this issue but I have been unable to find it .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	My SB Live firewire had a & quot ; driver & quot ; to add FW networking to the other OSes , but I think it 's outdated now .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
