1.1.1	Hi , I am running Windows XP Pro SP2 .	St
1.1.2	I realize that everytime I start my computer , many Event 51 errors come up within a time frame of 3 seconds in the System log in the Event Viewer .	St
1.1.3	However , the errors only come up in the log when Windows starts up .	St
1.1.4	After that they do n't come up .	St
1.1.5	here is the log for the error : Event Type :	St
1.2.1	I found another person who had the same problem with the same HD model as me .	St
1.2.2	Here is his post : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Hi all -- Just came across this post after having this same Event ID 51 problem myself .	St
1.2.3	I built a new system this weekend with the following specs : ASUS A8N SLI PREMIUM Motherboard AMD x2 64 4800 Processor ( 2x ) Samsung SP2504C 250GB SATA 3G Drives with NCQ In addition to the Event ID 51 problems , I was having intermitent problems with Windows taking a long time to boot .	St
1.2.4	It was driving me MAD ! ! !	St
1.2.5	A big thank you to everyone with similar specs who solved the problem by disabling the command queueing on the controller in Device Manager .	Polite
1.2.6	That seemed to work for me as well ...	St
1.2.7	I 'll let this go a few more days but this appears to have fixed things .	St
1.2.8	Wondering if anyone has tried the 6.70 NForce4 drivers from NVidia and keeping command queueing ON .	St
1.2.9	My current drivers are the 6.65 and these clearly do n't work with NCQ .	St
1.2.10	-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - It all seems to lead to nForce4 controllers that are incompatible with the model of HD .	St
1.2.11	All my PATA and SATA controllers are nFore4 intel edition .	St
1.2.12	HTH	St
1.3.1	If this is that bothersome , turning it off is not an option and http : //support.microsoft.com/kb/244780 is no help then you have a warranty issue .	St
1.3.2	Return the board as defective .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	HI , Thanks for the reply .	St
1.4.2	Do you think just leaving the errors alone is OK ?	Ques
1.4.3	because I have been using the same computer , same board , same HD for about 2 years now and have no major problems .	St
1.4.4	Other than the warning logs in Event viewer , the system is showing no sign that any component is failing .	St
1.4.5	Its running at good speed .	St
1.4.6	No sluggish performance whatsoever .	St
1.4.7	I do n't exactly want to return the board unless the problem becomes 100 % noticable .	St
1.4.8	What do you think ?	Ques
1.4.9	Thanks Hope to receive a reply soon	St
1.5.1	If you do n't feel like trying the advice you 've found then I 'd just ignore it and keep using the machine .	St
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	Hi , I ran CHKDSK ( checkdisk ) on my HD and it came out clean .	St
1.6.2	Then after my computer restarted , I checked the Event Viewer and this time , the error did n't come up when the computer started .	St
1.6.3	I restarted again and still no error .	St
1.6.4	At first I thought that CHKDSK fixed it but then I remembered that right before I ran CHKDSK , I uninstalled a program called MSI Live Update .	St
1.6.5	It is a program that was on my graphics card utility CD that is supposed to update the VGA Drivers with one click .	St
1.6.6	The program has been nothing but trouble to me on my computer .	St
1.6.7	I have had previous experiences where the program causes ( different ) warnings in Event Viewer related to security threats and stuff .	St
1.6.8	The program sometimes causes missing DLL error messages too , so I got tired of it and completely uninstalled it .	St
1.6.9	Anyway , if I need new drivers , i 'd much rather use MSI Live Update Online ( its the same as Live Update except you run it on the web so no modifications to your computer are made .	St
1.6.10	Anyway , I do n't know what fixed it ( for now ) , Checkdisk or Uninstalling MSI Live Update .	St
1.6.11	I 'm still not 100 % sure the problem 's gone though .	St
1.6.12	I 'll post back if it comes back .	St
1.6.13	Thanks for all the help	St
1.7.1	Hi , After leaving the computer off overnight , when it started up this morning the Event 51 errors came back .	St
1.7.2	So , hoping it works ( Which it probably wo n't ) , I switched the page file to a & quot ; System managed size & quot ; .	St
1.7.3	If nothing works , I think I 'll just ignore it for now .	St
1.7.4	Also , I do n't know if this is normal , but I realize that even though I have 400MB of unused physical memnory ( RAM ) out of my total 1GB of RAM , 700MB of the page file is being used .	St
1.7.5	I just thought that the page file was only supposed to be used if the system runs out of physical memory ... Any thoughts on that ?	Ques
1.7.6	Thanks	Polite
1.8.1	Hi , After changing the pagefile option to & quot ; System managed & quot ; , the problem SEEMED to go away .	St
1.8.2	The computer was left off all night and when in started up this morning , there were no errors in the log .	St
1.8.3	I 'll post back if there are any more developments .	St
1.8.4	Thanx	St
