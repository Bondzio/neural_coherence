i recently purchased a 1 gig stick of pqi turbo low latency ddr400 ram, part number pqi3200-1024sbl.
i mistakenly believed it was 2x512 mb.
i'm thinking of trying to match this stick with another 1 gig stick for dual channel mode on a nforce4 939 motherboard (jetway 939gt4sli-g-vc).
can anyone tell me if there's another brand that will do dual channel with it?
finding the exact same ram stick for an acceptable price is problematic.
specifications part number: pqi3200-1024sbl package: 1024mb single pack organization: 128m x 64-bit cas latency: 2-3-2-5 test voltage: 2.6 v pcb board: 8 layers pcb speed: ddr 400 mhz (pc3200) type: 184-pin ddr sdram error checking: non-ecc registered/unbuffered: unbuffered thanks in advance!
