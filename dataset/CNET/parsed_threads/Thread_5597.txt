<s> I have a wireless network in my house. </s>
<s> My speeds seem to fluctuate greatly. </s>
<s> This is NOT a question about interenet speed. </s>
<s> I live in the country and I know my ISP is sub par out here. </s>
<s> I am talking about data transfer across the network to my storage. </s>
<s> I am using a Cisco E4200 storage router with a 2TB drive attached. </s>
<s> From the same location in the house using the same computer, my speed ranges from 200Kb/s to 2Mb/s. </s>
<s> I realize the speed is very slow for the router's specs, but that could be a distance,signal strength issue. </s>
<s> Shouldn't my speed be pretty consistent from that location though? </s>
<s> What could cause such a large speed disparity? </s>
<s> Things to try: - move PC and router_storage closer (a few feet or yard would be fine). </s>
<s> What happens? </s>
<s> - select another channel on the router - to compare, move a large file, not many small ones Kees </s>
<s> You say nothing of your hookup/ISP. </s>
<s> Fluctuation(s) can/could be related to several issues that could relate to ISP. </s>
<s> Bandwidth often varies, especially with a wireless hook up, a hardwire hook up is generally more stable. </s>
<s> Lesson 1. </s>
<s> Do not put your NAS on WiFi. </s>
<s> Wire it to the router. </s>
<s> Lesson 2. </s>
<s> It will be very slow on WiFi for many reasons. </s>
<s> Lesson 3. </s>
<s> NAS is much slower than your local drives. </s>
<s> Figure 10 to 1000 times slower. </s>
<s> Folk are repeating these lessons too often. </s>
<s> In parting a tip. </s>
<s> Keep your folders tidy. </s>
<s> Don't put more than a few hundred files in each folder. </s>
