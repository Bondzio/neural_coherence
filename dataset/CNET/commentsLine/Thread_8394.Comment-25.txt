here's my experience over 20 plus years and initially i thought the same as they did.
if you look at fans mounted on intel or amd cpus....they all blow air downward over the heatsink toward the cpu.
second where the fan sits on top of the hs and the fan could be mounted to blow up or down, i've only seen one mfg (alpha cool) out of the many many aftermarkets hs fans recommend the fan pull air thru the hs upwards.
otherwise they blow air downward toward the hs and cpu last, believe if you look at the vast majority of high-end aftermarket hs fans, you'll find the fans blow toward the heatsink...not away from it.
if you find multiple examples to the contrary ...where the mfgs specifically recommend the fan be mounted so as to pull vs push air through the hs...let me know.
otherwise i'll continue to think as i do now.
if you need heatsink mfg names, try frostytech.com.
