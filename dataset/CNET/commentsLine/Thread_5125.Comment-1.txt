i have xp, and i just partitioned my new external western digital hard drive as ntfs.
i took my hard drive to school ( we use macs os 10), and the mac would not recognize my drive.
the drive is supposed to be multi-platform.
how would i partition my drive so that both macs and pcs recognize the drive?
thanks!
