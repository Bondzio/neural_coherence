i built my own pc a couple years ago, and i discovered recently that my on board usb slots are all usb 1.1 after i tried to transfer some pretty big files to a friends external hd and it took forever.
i want to upgrade to usb 2.0 and mount it in one of my 5.25'' bays so they're in the front.
i've priced usb 2.0 cards, but before i buy one, i want to make sure that it'll work right.
does the motherboard need to support usb 2.0 for it to work at the higher speeds, or can i just buy a pci card and be done with it?
thanks!
