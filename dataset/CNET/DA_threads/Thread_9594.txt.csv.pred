1.1.1	Because of some remodeling , my small business is being forced to move its server .	St
1.1.2	We are currently running on a wired system , so reconnecting the network will entail lots of time , money , and pulling a great deal of wire .	St
1.1.3	The question is , should we just go to wireless instead ?	Ques
1.1.4	With speeds of up to 108Mbps , I 'm not concerned about throughput .	St
1.1.5	What I am concerned about , though , is reliability .	St
1.1.6	Our office is about 10 computers .	St
1.1.7	Will the network be dropping connections ?	Ques
1.1.8	Also , just how secure is 128-bit WEP or WPA ?	Ques
1.2.1	Anyone ?	Ques
1.3.1	just a few of us here , but welcome ... Several things , not in any particular order : You mentioned speed .	St
1.3.2	108Mbs is theoretical using proprietary techniques , and so you will need to ensure that ALL equipment at ALL times is vendor-specific .	St
1.3.3	Even then , the full 108 is shared and based on ambient conditions , meaning you will not likely see it in the real world and actual speeds will get worse the more you use it .	St
1.3.4	You mentioned reliability .	St
1.3.5	Wireless can be disrupted by the most unlikely things , such one of your employees putting a bag of popcorn in the lunchroom microwave .	St
1.3.6	Or an employee of the company in the next office suite .	St
1.3.7	The dropout rate of even the best equipment is more than you might want .	St
1.3.8	You mentioned time and money .	St
1.3.9	You 're going to have to spend some either way .	St
1.3.10	Configuring an enterprise-wide wireless network is not a snap of the fingers .	St
1.3.11	You did n't mention security .	St
1.3.12	You may gain a little time setting up the wireless access points , but you 're going to give it back in spades for the rest of all time maintaining security over your network and computing resources .	St
1.3.13	Wired security is so much easier .	St
1.3.14	My recommendation ?	Ques
1.3.15	Wire it .	St
1.3.16	If you want some limited wireless connectivity for certain place or times , add it as a spot-feature , not your core network .	St
1.3.17	dw	St
