my first computer was an xt model, with a harris 8086 processor.
i didnot have a choice in getting one as i desperately needed it for uni.
i paid over 1000 for it in south africa, it was the dogs proverbial at the time, within 6 months the at 80286 was on the market, from there the cpu chip rapidly changed in capabilities and price.
i kept the xt 8086 until 1993 when i left to come home, it was still working as well as the day i bought it.
the hard drive was a conner 40mb, all the ram was plugged as chips straight into the motherboard.
according to my inlaws it is still going well.
