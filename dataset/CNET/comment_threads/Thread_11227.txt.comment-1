I have a PNY Gforce 4 mmx 420 se 64mb Pci.
This card requires a 250 watt power supply but all I have is a Delta electronics micro atx 90 watt with a 124 watt max output.
My question is can I damage my card without the proper wattage.
If I were to upgrade to a higher wattage power supply would I notice any performance increase.
I believe with a micro atx all that is available is up to 180 watt.
Is this true?
or could I find a 250watt micro atx power supply.
