what you probably need is a manual kvm switch, not an automatic switch.
a manual switch keeps a load on the ports at all times so the pc doesn't realize that the keyboard and mouse aren't connected.
we use a manual switch in our shop to connect up to four pc's to the same keyboard, mouse and display and haven't had any problems.
an automatic switch caused many problems, but the manual one doesn't.
