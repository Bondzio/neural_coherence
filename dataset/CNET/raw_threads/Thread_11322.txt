He has 2 external hard drives on is a 500 GB Western Digital the other is a 1.5 GB Solo External Hard Drive Fireproof and Waterproof...yeh a little over kill! His computer is about 8 year old Dell...it even has a floppy drive. He saves everything! His hard drive has almost no free space. What I would love to do is set up his computer to save all his files directly to the 500 GB hard drive. Not on his computers hard drive! I was going to partition the 1.5 GB hard drive so there is a complete back up of his computer hard drive on the first partiion. Also, I would love to sync his 1.5 GB second partition to his 500 GB hard drive (which is actually saving all his files? Do you have any suggestions? I have figured out how to assign dirve letters. I know how to partition. I don't know how to sync one hard drive to the other or automatically save files directly to the 500GB. Note: I have backed up his hard drive right now to the 500GB. Using windows back up. He deleted the WD software of the 500GB! Thanks for your time...ynotbme &lt;div class=&quot;inter-pagination collapsable&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;postActions collapsable clearfix clearboth&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

There is also the MS &quot;tweakui&quot; powertool that can help. It has an option regarding special folders of which My Documents is one of these. It will help redirect the default locations where such files tend to land. Personally I prefer using the &quot;save as&quot; option and don't find it that inconvenient. But, if that's what your friend wants, it can be done.
