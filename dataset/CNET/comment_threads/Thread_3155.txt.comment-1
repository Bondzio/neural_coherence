Given the way that I am currently using my computer, I do not need a high end computer.
But my plans for when I get my new computer built will involve much more intenstive and extensive use of the computer.
I plan on having dual monitors with Adobe CS on one and Pinnacle Studio (video editing) on the other and moving some photos into the video editor, plus adding music and voice overlay.
This brings me to the subject of dual core vs quad core.
I have just read two articles with opposing views on the subject so for whatever they are worth I have listed them below Favoring Quad Core: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2406293,00.asp &gt; Favoring Dual Core http://apcmag.com/is_dualcore_better_than_quadcore.htm What are your thoughts.
