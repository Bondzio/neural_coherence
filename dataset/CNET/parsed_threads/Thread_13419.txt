<s> You might want to consider a ram upgrade........800&gt;1066. </s>
<s> It can make quite a difference for some apps. </s>
<s> It's not exactly a budget buster but may give a nice bump. </s>
<s> My system currently recognizes only 3.254GB of RAM! </s>
<s> Should I upgrade my Operating system and memory to get the best bang for the buck? </s>
<s> Swapping a couple of ram sticks and getting a little bump is about as simple as it gets. </s>
<s> Swapping an OS and getting everything to function again can put a major hit on the beer supply. </s>
<s> If the OS you have works.........leave it alone. </s>
<s> Your call. </s>
