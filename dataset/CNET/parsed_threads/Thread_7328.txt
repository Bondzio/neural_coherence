<s> Hello I'm not too new at computers since I've been a gamer all my life and have played Starcraft 2 and WoW for quite some time now, but I've decided that I want to venture into turning my computer into a DVR. </s>
<s> I currently use DishNetwork and all I've seen is people refer to cable box and such so I was wondering if there is anything I can do to record movies and such from my satellite provider. </s>
<s> I've been doing some research and I was first wondering if this capture card will record my HD movies from the satellite box since I'm working at the times that the movies I want to watch are on. </s>
<s> The card is an Avermedia AVerTV HD DVR model # MTVHDDVRR Along with this card I would like to know if the following PC configuration is overkill. </s>
<s> If it is please advise me on what would suit my needs and still be a good budget computer that I wouldn't have to update too often since I don't have the time to worry about upgrading a computer all the time. </s>
<s> Here is the configuration: It's from DigitalStorm Chasis: Cooler Master 942 HAF X Processor: Intel Core i7 950 3.06 GHx (Quad Core) Motherboard: ASUS Sabertooth X58 Memory: 6GB DDR3 1600MHz Digital Storm Certified Memory Power Supply: 750W Digital Storm Certified (Dual SLI) Hard Drive: 1.5TB Seagate Barracuda (7200RPM) (32MB Cache) Optical Drive: Blu-Ray & DVD Witer/Reader, Lite-On iHBS112 Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 470 1.2 GB OS: Windows 7 Ultimate Any help would be most appreciated since as I said I'm a gamer but computers to DVRs are a new subject for me. </s>
<s> I would think the sat. </s>
<s> people already provide a DVR standalone device for you to get, just inquire them or visit the support website. </s>
<s> While there, check FAQ of using the PC as such as well. </s>
<s> -OR- buy a used DVR that's ready for such, eliminates any config hassles, generally speasking. </s>
<s> The topic of recording on non-issued content supplier crosses the line. </s>
<s> Whatever you do, the end result is to capture anything is to have a data stream that's already decoded and simple video, etc. </s>
<s> to capture. </s>
<s> otherwise, you're against EULA of what is supplied. </s>
<s> Though, I have no idea just where it all stands, BUT it would seem the sat people already suggest the home network setup is basically what they want you to do in broadcasting the stream anywhere in the home, so its an open question to include mobile devices as well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I thought about that, but then again I do want to be able to record the shows for later viewing without having to worry about the limits that the satellite provided DVRs come with. </s>
<s> Also what if I would like to keep a backup of these shows on blu-ray in case I need to make room for another show. </s>
<s> That's why I want the PC as a DVR to give me more flexibility. </s>
<s> The rest looks to be overkill but the video card is beyond that. </s>
<s> My lowly laptop (lenovo y530) has all but an intel 5400mhd display chip and plays 1080p content on the hdtv just fine. </s>
<s> Maybe you didn't reveal this is more than a DVR. </s>
<s> Another overkill item is Windows 7 Ultimate. </s>
<s> For the DVR I could use the Home version. </s>
<s> Again, maybe there is a reason for that but DVR is not one I would pay so much for this. </s>
<s> I could also pull back to the i5. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well my main concern was that I didn't want to have to upgrade it at all. </s>
<s> Also this spec is for a good deal that I found from this company. </s>
<s> However I've read about people who are trying to have the computer be an HD DVR, I don't know if I expressed this viewpoint earlier. </s>
<s> That I'm trying to record in full HD as well as play the content on a full screen 46&quot; Sony Bravia EX500 series. </s>
<s> That's why I went with the overkill I guess. </s>
<s> Plus when I looked up some topics regarding HD DVRs people were complaining that when it recorded the picture was choppy at best and the sound wasn't good at all. </s>
<s> This is another reason for the heavy duty computer, but if people think that it can be toned down and save me some money by all means let me know where I can tone down and not have to worry about my movies being poor quality as I record them. </s>
<s> My thoughts are all about what affects recording and playback of HD content. </s>
<s> The speed of the drives is key so I'd look at a boot HDD and some RAID 0 of two other drives. </s>
<s> Since this is a DVR and not &quot;storage&quot; we can forget adding more backup devices. </s>
<s> That removes the HDD bottleneck issue. </s>
<s> Still can't see why such a hungry video solution. </s>
<s> That's a lot of Watts for something that's not in the path of recording and we know that for playback it rarely needs more than the chip I mentioned. </s>
<s> You can look at how low the y530 is and again, it plays HD just fine. </s>
<s> The OS is worth discussing. </s>
<s> Ultimate is a few hundred bucks more and I see not payback there. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I will look into the harddrives a bit more. </s>
<s> The only reason for the graphics card was to take the brunt of the video load so that to display my movies in the full HD up to 1080i. </s>
<s> As I said I've had experience with hooking a desktop up to a television to use it as my monitor instead of your standard computer monitors. </s>
<s> In the last case I did use a cheaper card by Nvidia and it plays movies just fine but I can still see some pixilation, call me picky. </s>
<s> I like to see smooth video on my television since I spent enough on having an above average television. </s>
<s> However I could tone the video card down, like I said I just want the picture to be as smooth as possible. </s>
<s> I will definately take the comments in consideration, thanks again. </s>
<s> The reason I went with the Windows 7 Ultimate is because I read that it is compatible with some Windows XP functions and I like that since I was always a fan of XP. </s>
<s> Oh I just forgot something has anyone heard of the Avermedia AVerTV HD DVR model # MTVHDDVRR? </s>
<s> I've seen some reviews on it but I would like to know if it will get the job done, I'm sure that I will have to use some software like Nero 10 to get the most out of it instead of using the stock software that comes with the card. </s>
<s> This is also one of my biggest concerns at the moment is that this card will not do the job I want it to do. </s>
<s> And the pixelation beyond a 1080p &quot;pixel&quot; is usually caused by either source or compression. </s>
<s> I tried playback on both dedicated GPU 1GB video cards and my lowly Y530 and found the same pixelation which points to it being in the source or compression and not the video card. </s>
<s> -&gt; About the Ultimate. </s>
<s> For a few dollars less you can get XP MODE from Windows 7 Pro. </s>
<s> But for a DVR we don't need that. </s>
<s> Hauppauge and others have caught up with Windows 7 as far as I can tell. </s>
<s> Then again I find folk thinking that these digital systems (HDTV, BR, BD, Hidef cable, uverse, this or that) would approach &quot;film&quot; as you see in the theater. </s>
<s> It will be a while till we get that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> From what I've seen of other users setups, they weren't all that top-end though dedicated when in use. </s>
<s> I do &quot;believe&quot; a DVR was used and then the data was passed on to the PC, as I suppose was a 2ndary device to be stored yet again. </s>
<s> As i don't get too involved in such matters, it was an interesting observation. </s>
<s> many so called &quot;media ready&quot; PCs were quite capable of storing the data stream. </s>
<s> As for BD, I would think that hits against the EULA. </s>
<s> Also, its been known that at least for cable users, they've been warned about copying movies, whether it be back-up or not. </s>
<s> How, they knew that, isn't in my providence. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
