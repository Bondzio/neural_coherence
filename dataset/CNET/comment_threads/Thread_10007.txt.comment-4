from the message link provided, you have quite a task.
Yes, a USB cable should work if the ports are configured on both.
And, if both are XP, there are wizards to assist.
You will be creating a network.
You will need to, not only connect them, but get them to agree to communicate.
You do not need to transfer AV and spyware programs but can install them right from the other machine if the installation executable is available.
As for the problem getting on line, this is another issue.
I am guessing that the &quot;data&quot; you see coming across is just the communication overhead and not really useful bytes of information.
Good luck and post your progress.
