Hello all, my brother has just bought and installed a pc memory stick that gives me around 75GB extra memory.
I have no idea about the internal workings of a pc so he bought and installed the stick for me.
He has told me that the stick has been installed properly.
How can I access that new memory from my pc?
Does the stick automatcally create a new disk drive in 'My Coputer?'
Where can I find the memory stick memory information on Windows xp?
How do I save things to the stick instead of the my harddrive?
