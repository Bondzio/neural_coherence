You can have multiple partitions on a RAID 0 array just as you can on any single drive.
Your array is seen as one drive anyway.
As for noticeable difference, I presume you mean speed.
RAID 0 will afford marginally quicker disk access but you don't double your speed by any measure.
I won't get into the hardware side but you're going to need to be careful about HD selection when creating a RAID array by making sure that the disks you buy are approved by the manufacturer for that use.
Otherwise, you RAID array is more likely to break.
