without a doubt the pc will go faster.
yea sometimes osx does get a slight boost in some applications as seen here simply because it is a much lighter os than windows.
however, the pc has outright better hardware.
if you installed windows and osx on the same amchine you might notice a small difference, however the pc has a processor that runs at a faster clock speed and is multithreaded, and the gtx 570 will blow that mobile card out of the water.
not to mention having twice as much ram at a faster speed and a 120 gb ssd.
so that should more than compensate for the &lt;3% boost from running osx.
i think you could not install any drivers at all and the pc would still run faster for the most part...but apparently some people think using windows is too complicated... or...you could get the pc an use linux, which is lighter than windows and thus you would be faster than either solution and save you $100 on linux.
