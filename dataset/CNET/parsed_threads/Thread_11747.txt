<s> At the moment my computer doesn't recognise when devices are plugged into my usb ports (not a hub). </s>
<s> So now my printer, MP3 player and External hardrive aren't recognised when they are plugged in. </s>
<s> This has happened without them being removed or in any way altered. </s>
<s> I run Windows XP SP2 and all unused USB ports in the device manager claim they are working properly, however when i get to the &quot;unkown device&quot; (my printer and.or external hardrive - both are listed as unknown devices) I get told the drivers aren't installed - yet when i try to intall them the computer won't recognise the device i want to install drivers to..........any ideas? </s>
<s> the motherboard USB drivers. </s>
<s> Have you installed them? </s>
<s> Your question is very light on system information so that's about all I can say. </s>
<s> Well luckily its all come back and it's working now - but i expect sumthing to go wrong soon because it did this before. </s>
<s> It wouldn't recognise the printer and external h/d and just came back at a random time - which doesnt help because i dont what the cause is! </s>
