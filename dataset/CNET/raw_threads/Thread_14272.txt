Now I'm seeing all these new flash drives with enchanced Windows Vista ready boost. My question is, do I really need a flash drive with this feature, or should I just get a regular normal flash drive without this feature and the useless U3 feature as well. Also I know the U3 feature can be taken out, but can the ready boost feature be taken out as well? I'm concerned if it will take up space for something that I won't use. Thanks very much :]

A chip to chip connection is better then a chip to drive connection. This will give an older system more virtual memory, some say it works better with older systems then newer ones. Once installed and formatted the drive should not be removed so put it in a rear USB port on the desk top. A 2GB USB can be bought for about $20.00 or less.

So I just wanted to know if those features could be taken out or any comparability issues I may run into..but by your post, I suppose just reformatting the flash drive will take care of any extras.....

You needn't reformat unless your using ready boost.
