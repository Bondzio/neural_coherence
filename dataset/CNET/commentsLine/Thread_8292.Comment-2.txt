i understood, i could be wrong, that using boot camp allowed windows to run as windows.
have you done any research into the feasibility of running your particular program(s) on a mac running windows?
there is also a utility called parallel which also allows windows to run on a mac.
armed with a copy of your program, head off to your local apple store/reseller and ask them to test it for you.
they should be happy to do so.
let us know how you get on p
