I have a hp pavilion a712n.
Here is all the specs http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?lc=en&cc=us&docname=c00288539 I'm looking for a video card up to 200$ dollars to install.
It has to be a PCI slot cause I do not have a AGP slot.
Any suggestions for a good place/card/price?
Thanks a lot for any help.
