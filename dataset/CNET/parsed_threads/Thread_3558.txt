<s> Hi All I have a 7&quot; Zeki tablet that was working well and then one day, I turned it on and I got a white screen with a distorted black line running through it. </s>
<s> It resembled a picture from an old etch-o- sketch. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what the issue could be? </s>
<s> Most tablets are never repaired for reasons such as no spare parts, no service manual and of course the old B.E.R. </s>
<s> issue. </s>
<s> What is BER? </s>
<s> For example this tablet seems to go for under 90 bucks and a service counter here is over 100. </s>
<s> It does not make sense to fix such a thing but to replace it. </s>
<s> You bring up a good point such as should products be offered that are not going to be repaired? </s>

<s> This would't surprise me much. </s>
<s> Planned obsolescence. </s>
<s> Thanx </s>
<s> If you are in the repair business there is a minimum counter charge of about 100 bucks. </s>
<s> So if any product is less than that, then it's BER. </s>
<s> This was not planned at all but the consumers want products that are cheap and we got there by designing out parts that would add cost to the product. </s>
<s> As you pass the 100 buck mark in parts you can drop more parts such as screws since it's not going to be opened for repairs. </s>
<s> The price continues down after that. </s>
<s> The cheapest tablets in bulk run 50-60 bucks wholesale by the container load. </s>
<s> Would you be willing to pay more for a serviceable product? </s>
