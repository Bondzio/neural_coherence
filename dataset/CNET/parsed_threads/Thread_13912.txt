<s> 7900gs is the fastest card on your list. </s>
<s> If you're getting the GeForce 8600GTS get the factory overclocked ones. </s>
<s> They have more performance. </s>

<s> I know exactly what you mean, I've been researching for the last couple of weeks myself. </s>
<s> I've finally settled on the 7600GT. </s>
<s> Its reasonably priced, and it gets over the top reviews on tigerdirect.com. </s>
<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7591_102-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=250498&messageID=2503641#2503641 and see if you find a better one. </s>

<s> The 7600 cards are good cards and have gotten good reviews, but if you buy the 7600 expecting to be able to play games like Oblivion and Dark Messiah at high (or even mid-high) settings at a reasonable frame rate, you're going to be dissapointed. </s>
<s> It just doesn't have the horsepower. </s>
<s> If you're willing to stretch your budget a few bucks you should be able to snag a 7900 based card at around $160 which will get you a pretty good jump in performance. </s>
<s> The second thing...why don't you want an ATI? </s>
<s> Their last generation of cards were great performers and you can get them now for very reasonable prices. </s>
<s> The 1950pro cards provide a great bang for the buck and you should be able to get them cheaper than the Nvidia 7900 cards. </s>
<s> The last time a bought an ATI i was greatly dissapointed... it was partially my fault for picking the card i did but the customer support did not let me return the card even though i never put the card in my system... so ya i guess i could give ATI another try; what ATI cards do u recommend under my cirustances (budget and PCI-e)? </s>
