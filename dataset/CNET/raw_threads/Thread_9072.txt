I recently installed a third harddrive in my comp for more storage space. after turning the comp back on and formatting the partition, i have had nothing but trouble. the comptuer is going slow. (eg, playing winamp, if i try to open firefox, it will start stuttering...it is truly horrible) Is there any way to find out what the problem is? my system: 512 ram 2.4 GHZ pentium 4 the harddrives: 80 gig primary, 2 secondary at 200 gig and 160 (the 160 is the new one) any help would be greatly appreciated!

If there is not much available, then that might be why. I honestly don't see why the hard drives would give you any trouble anywhere.

The stuttering would be typical. Maybe you blocked airflow in some way. The drive adds more heat, but that alone should not do it. Did you accidently disable a fan??

Where are all of your drives located (HD and optical)? Where is your drive with the operating system located? Primary IDE master Primary IDE slave Secondary IDE master Secondary IDE slave SATA Other?
