It wouldn't print at first, so we would turn it off and then back on, and then it would print. Then after a few days, that quick fix didn't work and it wouldn't print at all. I tried the suggestions from the troubleshooting manual - disconnect from pc, power, etc., then reconnect again, and that didn't work. I removed it from the pc and just plugged it in separately to a different outlet to see if it would work on it's own, and it doesn't. I have to remove the power cord entirely to turn it off. When I leave it plugged in, the printer just continuously tries to restart itself without success, then shuts down for a couple seconds, then tries to turn on again. I would try a different power adapter/cord, but it's not a traditional cord that I can just use a spare one to connect to the printer. It would cost more to service this printer than it's worth, so I just wanted to check here and see if anyone had similar issues or know of a fix. Thanks for any feedback!

There is no service manual and I've found service, even a DIAGNOSTIC to exceed the price of a new printer. Some seem upset at that but would we rather pay more for a printer and service? (If so, there are better printers which can be fixed when broken.) Bob

If you are using Vista or 7, with the C5180 you may have to upgrade the software from Hp's web site. It may be bad harware (internal printer issue) as Bob said but it could also be a software problem related to the printer/OS. Check software before you scrap the unit, C5180 was fairly decent.

I see a few for sale at 10 to 20 dollars at http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000GWMJVA/ref=dp_olp_used_mbc?ie=UTF8&amp;storeAttribute=e&amp;submit.see-all-buying-options=see-all-buying-options&amp;condition=used While service and repair is possible, the cost to do so is more than a new or used printer.
