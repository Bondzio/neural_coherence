<s> I've decided to wait on buying a new desk top (PC) for awhile. </s>
<s> Decided to upgrade my graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce FX 5600) from my HP Pavilion a450y, XP. </s>
<s> Problem - I see there are PCI, PCI 64, PCI Express, etc. </s>
<s> The device manager says the current display adapter is found in the PCI bus. </s>
<s> What do I need to know to buy the correct graphics card? </s>
<s> You need to know what expansion slots the motherboard has available for inserting a video card. </s>
<s> http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/prodinfoCategory?lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=391726&lang=en (Click on Motherboard Specifications) You have 3 PCI slots, one AGP8X slot, and no PCI Express slots. </s>
<s> Your best option is to get an AGP 8X video card. </s>
<s> Make sure your PSU can handle the video card you intend to purchase. </s>
<s> If it doesn't, you will have to upgrade the PSU. </s>
<s> Thanks so much. </s>
<s> Do you have a card in mind that performs well? </s>
