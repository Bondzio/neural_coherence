What makes most sense for battery life: a) Keep it plugged in at all times while using? b) Use on battery all the time (up to 100%, run down to 0, back up to 100% ...)? As a rule, I do not turn the computer off, put it to sleep at night, so if you recommend &quot;a&quot;, what about at night? Keep it plugged in, or recharge in the morning? And if recharge, run it to 0 first? Or what? Thanks.

I wonder why you did not just buy a desktop Mac instead of a MB Air. You have not mentioned moving it around at all. P
