1.1.1	Ok so I get this system off newegg and all and for the most part I have built over 10 systems and never have a problem.	St
1.1.2	This time I got me a 10,000 RPM SATA drive and can not get it working.	St

1.1.4	Mainboard http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=13-180-061&depa=0&manufactory=BROWSE Hard Drive http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=22-144-200&depa=0&manufactory=BROWSE When the computer boots up it does not list the drive.	St
1.1.5	I enter the bois and have it look and it does not notice the drive.	St
1.1.6	I can run f-disk, then start to install windows.	St
1.1.7	when it starts to copy files over I get a blue screen saying it has stoped installation to prevent damage and list a error like I press f6 during the install and then it asked for a disk.	St
1.1.8	I have a disk that came with the Mainboard.	St
1.1.9	It then asked for a disk in drive a: I then picked raid, and storage drive drivers.	St

1.2.1	The blue screen on install is typical of a hardware issue.	St
1.2.2	You need to find the bad ram/board and get it exchanged.	St
1.2.3	There's no clue in your post about what parts you changed out.	St
1.2.4	Or if you tried a PATA drive.	St
1.2.5	Another fine issue is that most boards do not come with a current BIOS and your post does not tell if such was updated.	St
