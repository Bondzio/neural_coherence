<s> I just added a new 100 GB hard drive to my Dell desktop computer because I ran out of storage. </s>
<s> I need to know how to transfer all files and data from my old drive to the new. </s>
<s> I specifically tried to transfer my iTunes folder to the new drive, since it was the largest folder, and it didn't work. </s>
<s> I suspect it has to do with system files being on the &quot;C&quot; (original) drive and the programs don't know to look for the songs on the &quot;F&quot; (new) drive. </s>
<s> Should I just &quot;Disk Copy&quot; or purchase a transfer utility program? </s>
<s> If there is an easier solution, I would be gratefule for the tip. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> is the easiest for most files/documents/folders. </s>
<s> You cannot move programs, you have to uninstall them and reinstall them paying close attention to the destination drive in the process. </s>
<s> But some programs may not run from a slave drive. </s>
<s> You'll just have to test it. </s>
<s> But just plain data such as pictures, documents, etc. </s>
<s> can be just dragged and dropped. </s>
<s> iTunes locks the music to the My Documents folder so it'll have to stay. </s>
<s> There is a way to redirect iTunes to another folder but it is a PITA to configure. </s>
<s> More information and about a two page tutorial on the process at the iTunes site. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> I will check out iTunes to get the full picture. </s>
