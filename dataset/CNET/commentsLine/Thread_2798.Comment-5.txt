i have added a 256?
stick of sdram and a ati all in wonder 7500 card, but not a new hard drive ( i usually remove all the programs etc.
that i don't use, most of my drive empty).
you lost me after (you want the 10 time 100 fsb model since it runs at the fsb speed.
please don't ask what fsb when we have google.com.
you'll need a new heatsink and cpu fan.
if you don't, the new cpu will be toast.)
sorry i don't understand what the 10 times 100 fsb model means, and what heatsink and cpu fan i need.
i don't know what a heatsink is either.
sorry thanx
