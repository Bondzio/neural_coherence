i also have a d-link 630 adapter card with same syptoms you have on my sony vaio.
i could not get mine to work correctly and found posts on various forums with everybody having the same problem with d-link cards and usb adapters.
uninstall your drivers.
accect your loss and buy a new card or usb adapter of a different brand.
i bought a netgear adapter card wg511 and it works great.
no problems with my network or anybody elses.
you can usually catch them onsale for around 30 dollars.
hope this helps.
