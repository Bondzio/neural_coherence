chances are it's probably a faulty keyboard.
is it a wired or wireless keyboard?
if it's wireless, first try swapping out the batteries and see if it helps.
i had a keyboard start doing weird things, stop responding, type letters that i wasn't typing, etc...i had an extra keyboard laying around, so i decided to swap it out.
the other keyboard worked fine.
however, when i picked up the original keyboard to swap it out, i found a small puddle of water underneath it.
ha..then i shook the keyboard and saw a few drops of water come out of the bottom.
sure enough, someone must have spilled water on my keyboard (i do have others using it now and then, including my little niece).
