There's a lot of info about Intel's, but it's way out of my price range. Does anyone know of something cheaper that can still be considered high quality? Just looking at what is available on different etail sites, I've found Cavalry Storage, Samsung, OCZ, Intel, and several others. If someone could share their experience I'd appreciate it. So far I'mleaning towards Cavalry and OCZ since they seem to be priced ok, plus they have USB ports. Thanks in advance.

After looking at the spec. and prices of varying unit...only Crucial has a 5 years warranty (that was printed that I can see)..strange; and only Kingston has an SLC unit (slc suppose to be better than mlc). Good luck on your selections.

I am leaning more towards OCS MLC drives because they seem cheaper than anything else. Intel 30GB is selling for around $370 and OCZ is right now for $99. I have been using this website http://www.easypricetracker.com/searchex.wsh/ocz+ssd/0/0/25/0/0/-/-1/-1/result.html to check for prices and price charts - hopefully prices will go down to $69 which is the lowest reported by this site.
