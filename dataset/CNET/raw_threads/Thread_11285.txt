What I am trying to do for a small local business is this: DSL internet, in the house, PC in shop (40 to 50 feet away), and wireless access while in the shop. What I was thinking of doing is taking a router from the house (that connects to the DSL modem and from router to PC) to the garage where a router would be set up as a switch with wireless capabilities. I need the PCs to have file sharing. I would love to see diagrams if anyone has links to them. Thanks TC

Will the router be able to turn the internet connection into wifi? So if I had a cable modem -&gt;R1 -&gt;Pc and -&gt;R2 lan1, and able to wifi and hardwire from it like a switch.

Nothing special as to settings. Besides my usual settings of ssid broadcasting, WPA there isn't a thing I changed. Bob
