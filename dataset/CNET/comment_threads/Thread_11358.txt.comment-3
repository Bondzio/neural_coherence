Acronis Disk Director Suite 10 includes a multi-boot manager.
Other methods exist, too, that will let you choose which system to boot either by mouse-click or key press.
The idea is you install one OS.
Install the boot manager.
Install the other OS on its partition or hard drive.
Naturally for each OS you'll have to do the usual bit of tweaking and chasing down drivers.
But it's basically only a bit more complicated than building two separate computers, but much more efficient on desk space.
