IEEE, Bob recommended a good start.
No manufacturer will want to talk to you unless you have up-to-date bios.
However, since this failure occurred on two seperate new drives, I suspect you have a motherboard failure.
The motherboard should also have more than one SATA port on it.
Try moving the cables to a different port (plugs on the board itself) and try that.
Hopefully you only have a partail failure of your motherboard's SATA controllers.
Let us know OK?
