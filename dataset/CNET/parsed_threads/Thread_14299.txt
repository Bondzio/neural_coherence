<s> Hello, my computer is currently refusing to cooperate with me. </s>
<s> My OS is Windows XP, SP2. </s>
<s> The problem I'm facing, is my computer is not recognizing the hardware for my router. </s>
<s> It doesn't have a signal at all. </s>
<s> The problems aren't all consistent, because occasionally some things work, but it seems to be getting worse. </s>
<s> When the computer restarts, if it is able to connect to the router and get online, it will give a &quot;Serious error message.&quot; Any advice on these problems would be appreciated. </s>
<s> &quot;if it is able to connect to the router and get online, it will give a &quot;Serious error message.&quot;&quot; My thoughts here are about spyware. </s>
<s> Scan the machine with Free AVG Spyware, eject what it finds but first download WINSOCKFIXXP since some pests trash the Winsock when you remove them. </s>
<s> Given no machine details my only other idea is to change the WIFI channel to 1 5 or 11. </s>
