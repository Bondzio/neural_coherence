help me!
All of sudden, when i turn on my computer, my CD/DVD/CDRW combo disappeared on My Computer.
It can't play anything..even tho when I pop in a CD, you can hear it spool up.
Also, now when i turn on/restart my computer, on the screen it says Sec Master Drive- ATAPI Incompatible, Press F1 to Resume..
I press F1..then Windows XP loads..but my CD Rom doesn't work...I went to Device Manager...it says my CD ROm is working fine.........what should I do!...
I heard someone said in BIOS set all IDE channels to auto...but when i go into BIOS, i can't find the IDE channels...I have AMIBIOS.......help me!
this is driving me nuteS!
