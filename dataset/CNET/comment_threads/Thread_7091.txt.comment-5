Thanks linkit, I really appreciate your help.
Sorry for responding so late.
When I tried to installe Nero Express 6, the software wants to installed the previous version I have installed which is version 4.
I'm afraid if I uninstall the older version, my CD burner may not work anymore.
SO I did not want to take that chance untill I was sure it all would ok.
I'm using ''Tevion'' disks...and a generic brand from Germany.
Max speed is 8x.
I will try one of these two programs suggested and I will report back to you as to how things are going.
Thanks G
