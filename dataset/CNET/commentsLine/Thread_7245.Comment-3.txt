that you get all the cables and jumpers right.
here's what you need to know.
once in awhile you will find a drive that will not tolerate any second ide device.
this may confuse the new to ide technician.
after the initial shock and after encountering this a few more times it dawns on the tech that not all ide devices can coexist.
yes they should but the awful truth is that a few don't.
at least we have other solutions.
i'll leave jumper and cable discussions out of my replies since that's been done many times and there are plenty of web pages about that.
