<s> My HP a6720y locked up while playing TrackMania. </s>
<s> The windows key and Ctrl Alt Del had no effect so after about 2 hours I pressed the start button until it turned off. </s>
<s> Now it wont start. </s>
<s> The power light comes on, the fans start and then stop after a second or two and then tries to reboot. </s>
<s> I get no beep codes, no display. </s>
<s> The green light on the PSU is on but blinks when the computer tries to start. </s>
<s> The Geek Squad guy said most likely MOBO failure and would be cheaper to replace the computer. </s>
<s> Do you think PSU or MOBO? </s>
<s> I have unplugged everything in the case to find a bad component and nothing changed. </s>
<s> It doesn't start or run at all before shutting down to reboot. </s>
<s> As you know, that's not enough to diagnose the machine. </s>
<s> http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&taskId=120&prodSeriesId=3823602&prodTypeId=12454&objectID=c01643511 shows this is only a few years old but the failure to start up could be anything. </s>
<s> Why do you suspect the PSU? </s>
<s> It wasn't clear. </s>
<s> Some folk forget to share &quot;I installed a powerful video card and may have stressed the PSU&quot;. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> PSU GREEN WIRE TEST </s>
<s> Well, I don't know what to suspect. </s>
<s> Others have said check the psu first. </s>
<s> I would think that if the power supply failed it machine would have turned off, not freeze. </s>
<s> After I unplugged the video card, HD, CD drive, all but one stick of RAM without any change in it I think only the PSU and motherboard are left. </s>
<s> I haven't added new hardware or programs recently. </s>
<s> The only other issue I had is the the latest Windows Update wouldn't install. </s>
<s> The green power light on the power supply blinks when the computer tries to start. </s>
<s> That would be why I suspected maybe the psu maybe. </s>
<s> This could be as simple as a broken power button. </s>
<s> Do you have an Ohm meter to check that the button (it's a momentary on switch) is still good? </s>
<s> Are you into electronics enough to try it without the switch? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The green wire test is ok. </s>
<s> The fan turned on. </s>
<s> I am not that into electronics to try it without a switch. </s>
<s> Wouldn't a bad switch make it not power up at all? </s>
<s> How would a bad power switch make the system freeze up? </s>
<s> At first I thought the hard shutdown by holding the button caused the issue but now I think the freezeup was a failure and I didn't cause anymore damage than what was there already. </s>
<s> Were the values OK or not? </s>
<s> I have to ask. </s>
<s> About the push button. </s>
<s> We can do without that on most computers to know it's not that. </s>
<s> It's unlikely but I remove it and test it on its own as it could be defective. </s>
<s> Let me be clear. </s>
<s> It would take a chapter in a book to cover all the oddities about switches like that one. </s>
<s> I can't write that here and even if I did, most folk won't have the Ohm meter. </s>
<s> That piece of test gear is about 10 or so bucks and is required if we are to diagnose things without swapping. </s>
<s> Once we know the Volts are fine we have to consider they are right and it's a motherboard failure. </s>
<s> BUT since a low CMOS battery can block booting on some but not all machines, measure that too. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The green wire test I googled didnt include voltage readings. </s>
<s> I have an old ohm meter that I am not proficient at using. </s>
<s> What I said was a fan the first time was actually the hard drive spinning. </s>
<s> The case fan and Cpu fans do not start with the jumper applied to the wires. </s>
<s> And since the Voltage is not checked, then you are left with choices to make. </s>
<s> I can't make them for you. </s>
<s> It's a voltage reading, not considered advanced when it comes to PC repair. </s>
<s> Here's a google result on using a Volt Meter. </s>
