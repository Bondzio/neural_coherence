I'm leaving in about 20 minutes for Wal-Mart and was wondering if there was a cheap cable i could replace it with?

It makes a sound when i turn it on, will wait about 10 seconds, then make another sound, never sayin that drive F has been connected or auto-run. I really dont want to lose 10 gb of data. B.T.W, I still have the original box, so warranty might be an option (it's about 2 months old)
