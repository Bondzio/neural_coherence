<s> Hi All, I have a 4.5 year old PC. </s>
<s> 1 Ghz AMD Thunderbird processor, with 762mg RAM and a 64mb Guillemot KyroII based video card, and ASUS A7V motherboard which supports only USB 1.1 and is AGP 4X. </s>
<s> Yes poor me. </s>
<s> But it does all the basics well, even some older games no problem (ie: Battlefield 1942). </s>
<s> I'm basically not looking to update my entire system yet as it still works well. </s>
<s> Maybe in another 2 years. </s>
<s> So I want to squeeze everything I can out of the current system. </s>
<s> I'm thinking about buying a new video card which supports AGP 4x. </s>
<s> Ie: the older Radeon 9550 cards or competing FX 9550. </s>
<s> I'm hoping the jump from 64mb to 128mb (or 256mb depending on manufacturer) and 128 bit will help me out when working with PhotoShop doing video rendering or playing some games. </s>
<s> Any suggestions ? </s>
<s> Other products I should look at ? </s>
<s> Again the goal is to make an upgrade with my current PC without killing the budget and replacing it. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> the graphics card won't help you with photoshop, or video encoding/rendering it will just help you with games and highly 3D intensive tasks that aren't using the CPU almost all cards on the market support AGP 4x, saying the 9550 is old is also a mistake, it's one of the newest cards in the Radeon 9x lineup my 6800GT would work in your machine, assuming the power supply could handle it since your not providing budget or PSU information, I'll suggest the GeForce FX 5500 from nVidia http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814164009 such as that one </s>
<s> a 9550 dose not go near thee performace of a 5950 a 9550 is more like a fx 5600 maybe 5600 ultra ozos always being very intelegent i would go with the 5500 yet hat is still considered budget so a 5600 may be more suitable so u get the cinefx2.0 (thats what it is right) and other junk. </s>
<s> a safe older performace card is 5700 yet dont worry i played battlefield 2 on a 5200 (64meg) useing 4x agp in a notebook on low settings no lag. </s>
<s> this is just a few notes. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Everything depends on your budget, of course. </s>
<s> An Nvidia FX5700 is ok or an ATI 9600 (better). </s>
<s> If you can stretch for it, that would make a sparkling improvement. </s>
<s> Whatever you go for, try and avoid the XT from Nvidia or the SE from ATI, these are cut down brain damaged versions of the full card (although either would blow a kyro out of the water!). </s>
<s> Just to be awkward, the XT from ATI is the cooking version!!! </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> I just wanted to say I would go with a 5600, or a 5700. </s>
<s> This becaue the other cards dont have any nice features compared. </s>
<s> And yes I can play Battlefield 2 on a FX go5200 (64meg) on low settings no lag. </s>
<s> Thanks for everyone's input. </s>
<s> My budget is max $150 cdn. </s>
<s> So that limits me to the following cards. </s>
<s> Radeon 9550GE/TD 128 bit (128mb or 256mb, depending on manufacturer costs = $85-$129). </s>
<s> Nvidia FX5500 OC with 128 bit (128/256mb costs=$129) or Nvidia FX5600 (cost=$169). </s>
<s> Finally, Radeon 9600XT 128mb and 9600 128mb both on sale this week (the XT version is $149 the 9600 is $119). </s>
<s> Is the consensues to go with the 9600 if I already have firewire on my pc (for video editing) ??? </s>
<s> I believe the XT chip is the same, only video in is the difference. </s>
<s> Comments ? </s>
<s> thks. </s>
<s> first dont pay extra for OCing it can be done no prob it is jsut moving a slider. </s>
<s> i would go for 5600 if u like openGL games (doom 3) or the 9600 if u like Directx games (far cry, half life) im not sure about if u should get the XT version of the ati. </s>
<s> just dont buy a ati SE card or an nvidia XT card. </s>
<s> also maybe look at the 6600 i belive that card is 150$ (newegg i think i saw it at). </s>
