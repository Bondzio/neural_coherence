1.1.1	See my earlier thread & quot ; How to restore System if MB fails ?	Ques
1.1.2	? & quot ; started on 12/20/03 .	St
1.1.3	I am convinced I have a hardware problem .	St
1.1.4	Lockup occurs at random points after boot-up .	St
1.1.5	I took my system apart before Christmas and really cleaned it out good .	St
1.1.6	Removed all dust - but system still locks up .	St
1.1.7	Seems to be locking up more than ever - had to re-boot 6 times today before it became stable .	St
1.1.8	( Yesterday , had to re-boot 4 or 5 times before it became stable . )	St
1.1.9	I have the MB and Power Pack part numbers from Compaq .	St
1.1.10	How can I try to be sure what I have to replace before ordering new parts ?	Ques
1.1.11	Note : There was no visible sign of bad Capacitors .	St
1.1.12	Power Pack fan and CPU fan seem to be working fine .	St
1.1.13	( To repeat : I run WIN98SE with all updates ; on a COMPAQ Presario 5838 ( 500 mhz AMD Athlon cpu ) ; 384 Megs RAM ; Compaq 2 button wheel mouse ; Logitech Mouseware Control Center version 9.00.99 ; Mouse Driver version 9.00 ; Internet Explorer 6.0 + all updates ; Norton Anti-Virus 2000 with all latest Virus updates ( it has passed all Virus scans including the latest update ) ; Network Neighborhood enabled . )	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Take out a stick of memory .	St
1.2.3	With Windows 98 , you may not notice it from 384 to 256 megabytes of memory .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	Leave to case cover off .	St
1.2.6	3 .	St
1.2.7	Age .	St
1.2.8	Sadly , even with no visible signs of capacitor issues , they still age .	St
1.2.9	The power supply , motherboard and CPU are prime hardware suspects if a total reload of the OS does n't cure it .	St
1.2.10	4 .	St
1.2.11	No parasites allowed .	St
1.2.12	This is my non-negotiable item with five noted scans/tools at http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html ? forumID=32 & threadID=1313 & start=0 There are more than virus out there .	St
1.2.13	You do n't want these either and Norton does nothing to stop these .	St
1.2.14	5 .	St
1.2.15	Unless I could get those parts for under 20 bucks , I would not repair this machine .	St
1.2.16	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for all of your responses .	St
1.3.2	You are very helpful .	St
1.3.3	The symptom is that my system locks up within the first 1 - 5 minutes of booting up , then runs fine from then on .	St
1.3.4	( I have not turned off this PC since yesterday morning ) .	St
1.3.5	So as I look for bad components , what kind would exhibit the & quot ; bad when cool - good when warm & quot ; characteristic ?	Ques
1.3.6	PS - I ran all the & quot ; checker & quot ; stuff you referred me to .	St
1.3.7	No problems detected .	St
1.4.1	ALL the parts can lead to this issue .	St
1.4.2	Well , maybe not the speaker , some indicator LEDs and a case ( but maybe ? )	Sug
1.4.3	I mentioned the age of the parts are working very much against us here .	St
1.4.4	Electrolytic capacitors used in power supplies , motherboards and almost all parts of the PC age and decrease in capacity at an astonding rate .	St
1.4.5	Chips can exhibit such anomilies and there is no firm test to find which one in any economical manner except to swap out a board/CPU/chip and see if the issue vanishes .	St
1.4.6	But since it does this with repeatability and you can use the machine , maybe all you need to do is to not spend a dime ?	Ques
1.4.7	Just turn it on 10 minutes ahead of time , then reboot ?	Ques
1.4.8	Bob PS .	St
1.4.9	If you want some engineering documentation on Electrolytic Capacitor aging , then I can supply some , but it 's mostly charts and jargon that shows the aging of time and temperature .	St
1.4.10	What no-one really tells the consumers is that most machines will fail in some number of years or develop 'issues . '	St
1.5.1	Thanks again .	St
1.5.2	Now I 'll go off and & quot ; ponder & quot ; some more .	St
1.5.3	I know its time to get a new PC but : 1 ) I do n't relish the thought of the time required to & quot ; learn & quot ; WIN XP-Pro .	St
1.5.4	2 ) I will have to buy an upgrade to my office suite , and probably spend some time learning it 's anomalies ( they all have them ) .	St
1.5.5	I am hooked on WordPerfect Office Suite - hate the thought of going to Microsoft .	St
1.5.6	3 } I 'll have to re-enable my home network .	St
1.5.7	This PC is now the hub .	St
1.5.8	It was a pain to set it up once !	St
1.5.9	4 } I 'll have to buy an upgrade for Drive Image ( and maybe for Partition Magic ) .	St
1.5.10	All of the above takes much time .	St
1.5.11	But considering all the time I have spent on the current PC issues , maybe I should have made the jump sooner !	St
1.5.12	Thanks again .	St
1.6.1	I use the following suite on all the machines now that Microsoft Office is frankly getting too pushy about one copy per machine in my house .	St
1.6.2	I can deal with it at work , but at home , no .	St
1.6.3	Open Office from http : //www.openoffice.org To complement web work , the Mozilla from http : //www.mozilla.org XP was not a big move for me , but I ran NT 4.0 at work for far too many years and Windows 2000 .	St
1.6.4	The issues of 64 kilobyte resource pools and 4 gigabyte file size maximums make the 95/98/ME line unusable now that I want to do video work at home .	St
1.6.5	Be sure to check that the fans are clear and running top notch and your machine may just need a 10 minute warning ... One last thought .	Sug
1.6.6	If you are inside the box , reseat the cards , memory and such , just to be sure .	St
1.6.7	Bob	St
