after checking with iwill's site, it looks like my bios is the most up to date.
i also turned off my option in windows to have the system reboot whenever there's an error in order to get the blue screen of death... it noted that i should check my ram...... could it be my memory is bad?
i'm still deciding whether i should buy some new ram... thanks!
