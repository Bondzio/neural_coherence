<s> I installed a new wireless router. </s>
<s> My computer detected signal from my neighbors house as well as from my own router. </s>
<s> What prevents my neighbor from accessing files on my computer? </s>
<s> The firewall? </s>
<s> Are there any precautions I should take for added security? </s>
<s> Also, the router is less than 50 feet away from the computer, yet the signal strength is poor. </s>
<s> How can I increase the signal strength? </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Two things. </s>
<s> In this order!! </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Update all FIRMWARE in all devices. </s>
<s> For me, this has paid off well. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Enable MAC address filtering. </s>
<s> Only what's in the list can now connect. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info, but what is &quot;Firmware&quot; and &quot;Mac Filtering&quot; and how do I update these? </s>
<s> Both these terms and items are either in the router's manual or the maker's web site. </s>
<s> Since I don't see the make/model in your last reply, I leave it to you to look at the maker's web site for the FIRMWARE update and how to enable MAC filtering. </s>
<s> Example at http://www.zyxel.com/support/supportnote/ZyAIR_B2000/app/MACfilter.htm Bob </s>
<s> You need to make sure that you secure your wireless network. </s>
<s> You will need to make sure you use a WEP key. </s>
<s> Without using the key your leaving your wireless connection open for anyone to join. </s>
