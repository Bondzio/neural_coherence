(windows xp)recently the cdrom/ floppydrive and cdr stopped working properly.
when i insert a cd and try to open it i get this error message: d or a:\ is not accessible.
incorrect function.
but if i restart the computer and leave the disc in the drive, after restarting it will read the disc properly.
for some reason the disc needs to be in the computer when it boots up for it to recognize it.
i was going to reinstall the drivers, but this wouldnt make sense considering it's the three different devices doing the same thing.
the only thing differently ive done to the computer lately is i installed a usb smartmedia card reader, which said it was not tested to run with xp, i installed anyway and it worked at first, then it would not and so i removed it.
but my usb mouse still functions properly, so i doubt this is the cause.
i also got the service pack2 to from microsoft to update windows xp.
and i got new antivirus software as well as adaware and spysubtract.
these shouldnt have an effect but theyre the only things ive done differently on the computer recently any help would be great, i dont know too much but am learning through each new problem, and just need some direction as to what things to check out.
