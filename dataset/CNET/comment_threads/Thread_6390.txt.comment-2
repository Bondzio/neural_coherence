You can learn it or just accept the cheat sheet about this.
When ping, lag and such matters, get wired.
No wireless solution will assure you that it won't contribute to lag, ping times.
This is why you wire such a connection.
At 80 feet, the situation is not going to get any better.
You would NEVER consider wifi for this.
You might consider ethernet cable or powerline links.
