if you don't have the answer, don't bother posting.
obviously you have no idea bob.
first of all, i was getting 300mbps last week with a different router, so i know in my super secret lab i call home, that it is possible.
second, i've done some more looking and found out important things like needing to keep wmm on, and using wpa2 security to even think about getting n speeds.
it's obvious you are clueless, please ignore all my posts from now til eternity, and leave the replies to people on this forum who know what they are talking about.
&quot;the lesson is simple.
keep what you can wired&quot;.
you're a joke dude.
