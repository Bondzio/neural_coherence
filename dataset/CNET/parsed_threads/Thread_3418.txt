<s> I have a hp photosmart p1000 printer that has a slot for a compact flash card. </s>
<s> It has always worked. </s>
<s> But now when I put the card in, it will read it and say how many photos are on it but when I push the save button on the printer, it says looking for pc a couple of times and then says pc is not connected. </s>
<s> But it is because I can print from it. </s>
<s> any suggestions? </s>
<s> uninstalling and re-installing. </s>
<s> What has transpired since it worked? </s>
<s> You might also see if there is any information and/or driver updates from HP. </s>
