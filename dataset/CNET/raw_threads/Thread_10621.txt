A bought a couple DVD-RWs but I can't figure out how to write on them. I have downloaded 3 different programs (BurnRight!, Burn4Free, and Click n' Burn) but I can't get any of them to burn a DVD-RW for me. Some tell me to insert a blank CD, others try to burn, then say that they have finished with errors. What am I doing wrong?

It easily burns DVD or what ever you want. So I think it better use tried software, as I'm not sure that your programs support burning on DVD-RW.

On the cover of the DVD case it says 2-4x, is that just the reading speek or is that also the write speed they are designed for?

However, there is a fimrware upgrade that will allow you to write at 1x speed on 2x DVD-RW media.
