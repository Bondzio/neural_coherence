I mean they say it would be slow or it might not be compatible etc etc. So, in short, I am using Windows 7 ultimate, 2 gb or RAM, 2 + 2 gigs of core 2 duo processor on hp dv 6500 special edition and I am planning to buy WD My Passport Essential SE (1 TB), so would have I any issues or would it be ok? Or may be I should just buy the My Passport Essential(500 GB)? Thanks in advance.

I have more than one 1.5TB USB drive as I maintain backups and beyond those I have other backups on DVD, USB memory sticks and more. The machines the 1.5TB USB drives are used on are a collection of machines at the office with Vista, 7 with AMD dual core, Core Duo, Core 2 Duo and i5 CPUs. It all works so I'd wonder why anyone would write it doesn't. Bob

Some were 1 Terrabyte. The end user did not either read the specification, or failed to verify at the manufacturer's site the information. To this day, there are Vendor's that market external cases with only 1 Terrabyte specs. Today, the most well-known online vendors do an adequate job with specifications. Links to the manufacturer's site, and buyer reviews can sometimes answer lingering questions.

Some cases only handle 500GB, some 1000GB, some two 1000GB as twins. The problem rests with the interface within the external case. Your link was about motherboard BIOS.
