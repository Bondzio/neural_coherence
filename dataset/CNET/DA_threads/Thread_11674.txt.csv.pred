1.2.1	There are some little 20 buck SATA to IDE converter boards on newegg.com and geeks.com.	St

1.2.3	If you can't stand experimenting then place the drive into some USB 2.0 enclosure.	St

1.3.1	with a BIOS supporting SATA drives &gt;137GBs....your old PC probably won't support 1TB drives ...even if you're OS supports it.	St
