because of their experience in the PC peripheral business and they handle HDDs up to 1,000GBs.
I've got 2 ACS-100 (with WD320GB HDDs) and 1 ACS 100 (with Seagate 100GB notebook HDD).
The Adaptec ACS-100 (3.5&quot; USB 2.0), ACS-120 (2.5&quot;, USB 2.0), and ACS-200 (3.5&quot; USB 2.0 and Firewire).
Gimme a shout if you any questions.
Newegg has a lot to choose from they have better than average product info.
Last time I looked, Buy.com had the lowest price for the Adaptec enclosures.
