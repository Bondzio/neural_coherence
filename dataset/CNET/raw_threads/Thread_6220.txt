Some remarks: - the screen size of a netbook is quite small - 600 x 800 pixels at most - this may be a limiting factor for some games - the small keyboard might be right for small 9-years hands - playing games often needs a mouse - the touchpad of an average laptop isn't nice for that; so preferably you use it sitting at a desk, and then you don't need a notebook or laptop so much - netbooks, like all laptops, have a rather limited lifetime and expensive batteries A cheap desktop MIGHT be a better solution. YOUR choice, depending on YOUR situation. Kees Kees

So the kid was able to travel and game for cheap. Later we picked up some under 400 buck Toshiba 3GB RAM, 160GB HD, Celeron with the usual. The netbook was great training wheels so I could see what respect he would have for the real thing. Bob
