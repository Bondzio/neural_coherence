776	2	189437	2053377	2053162	Txiki	7/7/06 5:05 PM	1.1522919E12	is that the only advantage?	bideo and sound?
776	3	189437	2053406	2053377	R. Proffitt	7/7/06 5:21 PM	1.15229286E12	Let me be more specific.	Once the video editing is done, the software needs to encode the video to the DVD standards. The 64 bit gets a boost here. Some scientific software has 64 bit versions but for many the machines will be nice even when we run 32-bit apps. Bob

776	5	189437	2055205	2055182	R. Proffitt	7/8/06 4:15 PM	1.1523753E12	No.	I've only seen 64-bit versions of Linux, Vista, XP and no extra eyecandy. However this area is important to a lot of scientific endeavors since the 32 bit address space (we get to talk about virtual memory operating systems) is not big enough for some work. Off the top of my head is the astronomy area. It's a big universe with big numbers. Bob
