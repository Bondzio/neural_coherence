There are ATI and Hauppaugge offerings but maybe you thought you could record in HD.
I'm going to decline explaining that one since it's been done (a few many times.)
&quot;I'm trying to use the cable signal that is already coming into my house.&quot; I can do that today since they are not discontinuing the old RF channels.
Maybe there is some confusion there?
