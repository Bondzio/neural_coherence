1.1.1	Hi, I am about to buy a mac mini and I'm also about to buy a Sharp LC-32D62U LCD tv.	St
1.1.2	I want to use the tv as a monitor for the computer though.	St
1.1.3	Do I need to find a TV that has DVI too or would the computer show up on the tv if I just bought a DVI to HDMI cable and hooked up the DVI end to the computer and put the HDMI end to the tv?	St
1.2.1	with a DVI connector on one end and an HDMI on the other, you should get a picture.	St
1.2.2	Does that TV/Monitor have a DVI input?	St
1.2.3	P	St
