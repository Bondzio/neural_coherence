<s> I have an Asus P5KPL AM EPU motherboard on an Antec VSK-2000 casing (with HD Audio front panel) According to my VIA HD AUdio deck software driver, the rear audio connectors are used for external PC speakers, and the front audio connectors are meant for headphones. </s>
<s> Does it mean that I can't connect an external PC speaker to the front headphone jack? </s>
<s> Will it fry the motherboard? </s>
<s> Or the front and rear audio jacks are interchangeable, and just ignore the VIA audio driver? </s>
<s> for speaker inputs. </s>
<s> They may tend to over drive the pre-amp stages. </s>
<s> The impedance mismatch will distort sound too. </s>
<s> I did it before. </s>
<s> It will work fine if your speakers is a standard low-voltage left and right audio speakers. </s>
<s> Having worked in the audio industry for decades, I can tell you from experience and scientific knowledge, never connect speakers to headphone jacks. </s>
<s> The requirements for each are totally different. </s>
<s> Even if you do get sound out of the speaker(s), you are overloading the Sound Card's audio output amp/circuit, and it will eventually fail. </s>
<s> Use a large speaker and it will fry the Card immediately. </s>
<s> (You'll smell the smoke too!) </s>
<s> Remember this simple rule-of-thumb: Jacks are labeled for their specific purpose. </s>
<s> If the audio jack could be used for both headphones AND speakers, it would be labeled as such. </s>
<s> Thank you for your input. </s>
<s> Now, that you've said that, I wonder if it will also destroy portable mp3 players such as creative muvo if you connect an external speaker on it instead of headphone? </s>
<s> and not headphones. </s>
<s> Earbuds need a few milli watts and headphones, depending on model, might handle a few watt's. </s>
<s> As such, most small portable MP3 players can connect to powered speakers such as you'd connect to a PC. </s>
<s> You'd need to check the instruction manual for each device to find out what output devices are compatible. </s>
<s> I have been using the headphone jack to connect to the input of a standalone hi-fi amplifier for years with no problem. </s>
<s> I play music from Pandora through the system. </s>
<s> Do not connect the headphone jack directly to the speakers. </s>
<s> Connect only to an external amplifier. </s>
<s> Sound quality is acceptable but not super good. </s>
<s> I had a 2.1 system with a subwoofer connect to the headphone jack of my laptop and work fine and never had a problem and I had it for a couple of months. </s>
<s> I do not agree with you </s>
