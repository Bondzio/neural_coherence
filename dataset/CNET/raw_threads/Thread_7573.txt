I just pop in another blank disc until I find one will burn. I usually end up with 1 disc out of 6 that won't burn. This is using Disc Utility to burn Disc Images on an external Sony DVD burner DRX-820. I also use Popcorn and/or Toast 6 Lite (which came with the burner) but don't recall problems with those programs. cheers grim

I have a cd burner which has lasted 5 years without a hiccup. Is that aby-normal or is it just a common difference between the two types of technology? Thanks for the tip about the drive showing wear and tear Bob. grim
