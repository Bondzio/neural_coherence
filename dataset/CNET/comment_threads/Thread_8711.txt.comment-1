Okay I have it to where I have my bigger LG in front of me hooked up to my alienware via HDMI, and my smaller SONY hooked up via HDMI to the left of me.
I can't seem to make it to where when I play a game like AC3 for example I can minimize the game, open firefox through my SONY (Smaller to my right) and keep FIREFOX up and then maximize AC3 on my LG.
How can I do this?
I know theres gotta be a way.
