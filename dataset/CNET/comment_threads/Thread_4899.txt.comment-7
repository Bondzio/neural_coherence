Just a word of caution.
Not sure what OS you are running.
If you are using any of the OS that needs Microsoft activation, moving the OS to a new hard drive may cause the OS not to work (MS think that you are installing the OS to another PC).
This may be the reason why HP is giving you the warning of RPM different.
You need to call MS to reactivate the system for you.
For simpilcity, I'll just add a new internal or external (USB) HD.
