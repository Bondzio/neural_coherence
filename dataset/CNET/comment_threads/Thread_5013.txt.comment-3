I've already tried installing on C but I still get the same blue screen message.
I don't think that's the issue.
The version of Windows 7 is an official original download from my university's offer.
It's not just an upgrade but it also has the option to upgrade from Vista to 7.
I'll try updating my BIOS and attempt the install again.
Any further suggestions are welcome.
Thank you in advance
