Hello this is what I am looking for, I have a labtop computer so I need some type of combo pcmcia card for esata and maybe like usb2.0 or firewire if you could send me a link to one that would be cool.
Also someone said that I should get an esata combo with active cooling does anyone know of any good ones like that if you could send me a link to that also I would really appreciate it.
I have been trouble finding stuff with esata and have no idea about any of the manufacturers I have come across so far.
thanks for your help.
