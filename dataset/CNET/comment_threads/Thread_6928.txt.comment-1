I have an epson workforce 630.
I am using it to temporarily replace our main office copier/fax machine until its repaired.
Initially I could not send or receive faxes, but then I was instructed to turn off Error Correcting Mode (ECM) and turn off v.3.4.
After I did this I was able to receive faxes and I was able to send a test fax to epson which they received, but when I try to fax to other numbers it does not go through.
Any ideas as to why this might happen?
