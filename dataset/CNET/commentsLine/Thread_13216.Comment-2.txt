i didn't find your model so you should link to your exact model.
on the page  shows a few 650 video cards so a good choice.
that psu looks to be the minimum asked for (i read 450 watt minimum on the pages so far) and the full review at  has me worried about longevity of the psu.
i see about 200 watts alone for the video card so if we want a 5 year machine we double the watt capability of the psu.
that's a bit high at 900 so the psu is an iffy choice here.
if you can get another 100 watts and keep the single rail +12v then you should be fine for years.
