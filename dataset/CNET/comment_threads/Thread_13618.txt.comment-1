I have a Brother MFC-440CN multi function printer, which is network capable.
I use an Ethernet cable to connect it to my D-Link DIR-825 router.
But printing a test page does not work.
The D-Link people say I have to get the following from Brother: PCP port # & UDP port #.
I'm on hold so long with Brother that I thought I'd ask this forum how to get those numbers.
The D-Link people said I also have to know how to set the following in my printer: static IP address subnet mask default gateway Does anyone know how to do this?
P.S., I'm running Vista Home Pro 64 bit on a Dell XPS 1530 laptop.
