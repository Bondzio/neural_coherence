The other day when I went to access one of the files, the drive asked me to format, which I know is the wrong thing to do. When I look at the drive properties the pie chart indicates that the drive is full but it also says 0 bytes on the drive. Is there any way to recover the files on this drive or am I out of luck. Running Windows XP Media Edition SP2 on Dell PC. Many thanks for any help you can give me. Bob H

These things are backup, not storage so I had to fish around but found the HP USB formatter with this search -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=HP+USB+Disk+Storage+Format+Tool Hope this helps bring it back.

I was under the impression that formatting would erase anything on the drive (am I right&gt;) In that case I've defeated the purpose which was to recover what's on this flash drive. Bob H

Just google and find many users having the same issue, lost access or ability to retrieve. The flash drives are great for &quot;temporary storage&quot; or xfer from one system to the next. Excluding any s/w glitch it may have succumb to ESD(static) damage or possible OS hi-jinks. The same recovery tools can be used as any other storage device, google away. Some are free to use or test results then buy. I suggest you look at these &quot;file websites&quot; that provide such pgms.: http://www.jumbo.com http://www.tucows.com http://www.filehippo.com good luck -----Willy

Now let's say you have a copy on your PC and that flash drive. That's barely a backup since when the PC is wiped out you only have the original and no copy. Thus no backup. -&gt; Try the stick in some other machine next. Maybe your host machine is missing drivers after a reload. But I don't see that in the story so that would be me guessing badly. Bob

I found a freeware program called PC Inspector but besides not being user friendly, it didn't seem to recover anything on the drive. Is there a better way. Thanks Bob H

I took your advice and installed Recuva from Piriform. The program refuses to scan the flash drive because it says.....&quot;Unable to read Boot Sector&quot; Thanks Bob H
12450	9	323848	2946113	2946065	Willy	1/7/09 3:12 PM	1.23134112E12	i suggest...	Try additional file recovery pgms. until you seem familiar(or like) with the process. A boot sector error is something that can't be dismissed so easily. A damaged boot sector is far worse than a erased file or folder. Remember, some pgms. offer to test and go through the process but don't really recover anything until you pay for the version. Others may proceed and actually do the work but nag anyways even freeware. Here is another popular file website: http://www.majorgeeks.com tada -----Willy

Especially to Willy and Bob who came up with the winner. Zero Assumption software did the trick, restoring all my valuable records and files......I promise never to depend on Flash hardware for storage again. I recommend this software because it's easy to use and because, unlike the others.....it works. Tell your friends. Again....thanks everyone, you made my New Year. Bob Hennessy

But some stop at one copy (2 places where the files are) and only later discover that when we lose the first copy the second copy is no longer the backup. To maintain &quot;backup&quot; we have to start with at least 3 copies of a file. Now when we have a failure we still have a backup copy. Flash drives are not so bad but you may lose one once in awhile. About the titles. Some do better than others depending on the failure, the media and so on. Keep your favorite but be ready to try the others when the favorite strikes out. Bob
