If I connect the coax cable from the wall jack directly to my television, I only get analog channels (present world).
If I add a set-top box from my cable company, I get the extra digital channels.
If I connect that same coax to the EyeTV, I get the digital channels without the set-top box (?).
Will the WinTV-HVR-2250 do that for me as well on the PC side?
