My system wouldnt recognize the HD until I Flashed the BIOS from Gigabyte. Now it recognizes 149.5 GB, but not in the BIOS. The bios wont recognize a HD, only will accept Auto. Then when I boot up, it cannot find a HD until I reboot, then it finds a 160GB HD, but my systems file still only recognizes 149.5 GB HD. When I shut down, I have to boot up twice each time I restart in order my PC to find the HD again. I checked with the Gigabyte experts but they couldnt figure it out. Anyone ever hear of a problem like this. Thanks.

But we cure it with BIOS updates and if the maker doesn't fix it... then we get a new motherboaard or a drive under the magic 127/137GB size. There is no cure if they didn't do the BIOS proper. ---------------- Some fight the jumper settings tooth and nail. I'm unsure why people insist that a jumper setting be &quot;this&quot; when &quot;that&quot; works. You didn't share the IDE cable type you used, the jumper setting of the IDE drive and what you tried. Bob

Just installed a new ULDMA cable today, same problem. Wierd. Thanks for the reply. Bob H.

Or you have the drive on master/slave on an 80 conductor cable. Or there is another drive on the same cable and ... isn't entirely compatible with its neighbor. Bob
