My 802.11g connection on my Toshiba A-35 notebook (XP) allows me to drink beer in my back yard and surf the internet as it communicates with my 802.11b Linksys Wireless 4-Port Router that provides cable modem access.
But now, I want the same mobility that will allow me to sit on the beach at Galveston; or sit on the river bank in Big Bend Nat'l Park; or as a passenger in a car driving to Dallas; and I want broadband fast connectivity.
Is this possible yet?
Details....?
