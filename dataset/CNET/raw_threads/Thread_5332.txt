They appeared to be exactly the same router, except that one was &quot;draft&quot; N and the other was just &quot;N&quot;. The draft N was about $20 bucks cheaper. I live far out in the country and the beavers and turkeys out here are of the non laptop carrying types, so I really have no need for security and encryption, but I do have a tremendous need for RANGE. Is there anyhting to fear from the draft N vs. N? I think both were Dlink routers.

As long as you buy the matched pair (Wireless N Router and Adapter), you should just look for which pair gives you the best range. With unmatched pairs (even within the same brand)you may end up having to run both in basic 802.11G mode. The $20 price difference is nothing compare to the hassles you can get with incompatible router's and adapters when non-final wireless specs are involved.
