i looked into the ipad.
i like their applications, but i also wanted to be able to download my library books to the ipad.
when i checked with the public library, they stated that the ipad is an incompatible device because: &quot;drm-protected adobe epub & pdf ebooks are incompatible with these devices&quot; does anyone know if or how this issue is being dealt with?
