<s> I have several internal HDs that are &quot;dead. </s>
<s> The oldest one might be about 8 years old. </s>
<s> There is nothing on them that I need, but I would like to see if there is anything that I might want. </s>
<s> (previous versions of drafts, unedited copies of older photos etc). </s>

<s> The recovery houses do that but use specialized rooms and equipment. </s>
<s> My Cheeto dust covered fingers would not be good? </s>
<s> I didn't think the chances were good, but thanks ! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> a challenging but frustrating and fruitless pursuit. </s>
