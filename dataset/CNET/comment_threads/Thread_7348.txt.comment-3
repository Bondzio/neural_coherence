I have a Kingston V+200 240 gig SSd on a Windows 7 computer and it is crazy fast and stable.
A friend tried that same model SSD on a Windows Vista machine and it was a total disaster, nothing but trouble.
He did a clean install of Windows 7 on that same computer, reinstalled the SSD and cloned the harddrive to the SSD and it works great.
