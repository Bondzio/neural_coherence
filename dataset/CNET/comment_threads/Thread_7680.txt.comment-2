I guess it depends what you mean by VoIP.
If all you want to do is make calls via internet many of the newer cell phones have the ability to make skype or other &quot;VoIP&quot; calls directly over a wifi network.
There are of course many phones that will directly talk to skype or vontage or whatever via wifi also.
Now if you mean you are using something like a H.323 or SIP based phone to connect to a corporate VoIP network then it gets more complex but there are phones that will connect directly via wireless it just gets complex if you have a vpn layer on top of it.
Lately I have been using a app that runs on a android based cell phone that lets me use SIP over WIFI to access a corporate network.
