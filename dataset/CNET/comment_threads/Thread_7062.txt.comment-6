And sorry but I can only guess the usual.
There is another item that repeats a lot on home built units.
The builder has left an extra mounting stud under the motherboard.
It's been a good money maker for the shop as the home builder can't believe that so they bring it in.
If it didn't fry the board, cheap for us to correct.
