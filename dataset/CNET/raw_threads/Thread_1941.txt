I currently have a linksys wireless b router (BEFW11S4) and I find that it's is becoming a bit slow, especially for file sharing. I have found a good deal on a linksys Wireless N router (WRT300N) router ( 50$ off, new). At home I currently have 2 laptops (macbook,acer) running on wifi, one desktop pc that is wired, and my ps3 that is also running on wifi. I just looking for someones extra opinion and if the router is good for me. Thanks

If you upgrade, go for it, that price is good. But the caveat here is that (and all) advertised speed is in perfect laboratory conditions. Expect around 20-30 Mb/s actual. If you want to really smoke, get a Gigabit router. I have a D-link DIR-655 Gigabit/wireless N router. Wired speeds are a sight to behold. You can add a Gigabit PCI card to a desktop and PCMCIA card for laptops. My server has built in 10/100 but I added a Gb PCI card. I then added a PCMCIA card to my IBM (has wireless G) laptop.
