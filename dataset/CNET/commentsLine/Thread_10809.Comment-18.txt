i have had magicjack for 2 years now and love it !!!
it has a local area code and call forwarding,voicemail,threeway,caller id and free 411 it also has many many more features and i got mine for 59.95 for 5 years !!
i bought 3 for my use,1 for home and 1 for my office and 1 for my daughter's room,fax machines work great also with magicjack and each magic jack has there own phone number!!
!i have cable internet and leave my computer online all the time in sleep mode,you only need a live internet for this to work,it will not work with dial-up service!
i have had no trouble at all with this magicjack and ordered 1 for my sister and she instantly disconnected her at&t phone service,she loves it!it also updates when newer magicjack services are put out for the magicjack..any more questions email me at sassybratty40@gmail.com.
