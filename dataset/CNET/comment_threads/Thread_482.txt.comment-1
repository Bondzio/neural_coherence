A very petite lady friend of mine (4' 10&quot;) is studying to be a medical transcriptionist, but is finding that conventional keyboards require her fingers to stray from the home position a lot.
This prevents her getting up to speed and might well lead to repetitive stress injuries down the road, I'm told.
Is there a keyboard available that isn't a toy that is made for smaller-than-average persons?
It would need to be pretty much a standard keyboard, but with reduced key size and/or spacing - number pad optional.
I'm presently looking at the 83-key Low Profile Mini Keyboard sold by Ergonomic Resources, but I don't know who actually makes it.
Can someone give us advice?
Thanks!
