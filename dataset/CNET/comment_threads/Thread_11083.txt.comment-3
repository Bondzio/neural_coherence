that is posing the issue - I have actually messed around with it some more - I am writing this from my den - wireless.
however I am having to go through a strange set up to get connected.
When I turn the laptop back on I have problem getting the driver to &quot;initiate&quot; so if I turn on the windows utility it sends me to the netgear utility - which then works???
wierd
