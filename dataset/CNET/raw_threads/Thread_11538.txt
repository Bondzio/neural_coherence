I broke my USB Belkin N adapter, metal cap went off after I stomp on it accidental(it fell off of my desk)and it may broke the chip, I heard I have the warranties since I brought this early 08 or 09(forgot) and broke it few day ago. Will Belken willing to replace it or am I SOL and have to buy a new one. I don't know if they willing to replace it or not since I cant find the warranties information on their site, or how much it will cost? IF anyone know or have inside info with Belkin please post the information.

My guess is that physical damage is considered as abuse or misuse and won't fall under warranty coverage.
