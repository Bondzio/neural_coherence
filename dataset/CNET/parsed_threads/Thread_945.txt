<s> Set your graphics card to the native resolution of the monitor. </s>
<s> ...for the information. </s>
<s> So the graphics card must be compatible, otherwise, have it changed ? </s>
<s> Haven't thought of that ! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Not only must we install the graphics card driver but the MONITOR.INF file for that monitor in a lot of cases to inform the graphics card driver what video modes to offer the owner. </s>
<s> This area is a little confusing at first. </s>

<s> Just bought a 22&quot; 1680x1050 Samsung monitor to replace old 19&quot; 1280x1024 CRT. </s>
<s> The new monitor works but the highest I'm offered in display settings is 1280x1024, even though my PC clearly recognisies the new monitor and I've installed its driver. </s>
<s> I've been told that any graphics card should be able to handle a higher resolution with ease (my graphic card was bought 2003)so any ideas why I can't get the right res for the new monitor? </s>
<s> Many thanks Hajr12 </s>
<s> Make, model of display, display card, driver versions of the video card and a link to the monitor.inf for your monitor. </s>
<s> Without such I can't offer much. </s>

<s> Apologies Monitor = Samsung 2232BW Driver installed. </s>
<s> Info at: http://www.samsung.com/uk/products/monitors/lcd/designer/ls22pebsfvedc.asp Graphics card = S3 Graphics ProSavageDDR bought with PC (XP, Athlon 2400) almost four years ago. </s>
<s> Driver is the latest available I believe = s3gnb.dll 6.14.10.0033, date 13/08/04. </s>
<s> I'm sorry I'm not sure what monitor.inf is, but will supply if you kindly advise. </s>
<s> Thanks for your swift response. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> Unfortunately the link you gave appears to be down at present. </s>
<s> Is it possible my current graphics card is too old/unsupported in terms of drivers to handle a widescreen monitor? </s>
<s> Bottom line: is this a problem I could solve simply by buying a more up to date graphics card? </s>

<s> At my college the techs in charge ain't the brightest bulb in the box, and as well as a load of other caveats (logging us all in as administrator accounts...) the widescreen displays are all defaulted at 1024x768... </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help. </s>
<s> Turned out my motherboard was a grand-motherboard and wouldn't support a graphics card sufficient to power the monitor at the native res - or something. </s>
