<s> I'm looking for some crazy but relatively inexpensive-to-do PC modding tutorials. </s>
<s> Things like playing Xbox games on PC or putting a mini lcd monitor in the drive bay or whatever. </s>
<s> Whatever you guys can think of. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> You maybe better served using forums or websites that are dedicated to such topics. </s>
<s> I googled and here are some results: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=bu0&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=1&ct=result&cd=1&q=pc+modder&spell=1 Further, I found this website very useful: http://www.overclockers.com to include the links they provide. </s>
<s> As for modding itself, if you really want to stand out, you must &quot;create&quot; rather than put together off-the-shelf parts. </s>
<s> You'll get the idea once you delve into this. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> I agree. </s>
<s> I'll check those links. </s>
<s> Thank you very much! </s>
