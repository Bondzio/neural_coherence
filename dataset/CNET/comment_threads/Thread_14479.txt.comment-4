When we talk Windows I go back to USB.
You are more than welcome to try firewire but what risk is there since you'll keep a backup for the day it fails or goes missing?
And the same for USB drives.
This forum is flooded with folks that thought USB and drives in general were &quot;storage&quot;.
All externals seem to fail sooner than internals.
