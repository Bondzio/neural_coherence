Currently I'm using a cable modem, a Linksys BEFSR 41 Router...
If I want to add a wireless access point, should I get the one with a router capability or just the wireless access point i.e.
Linksys WAP55AG or WRT55AG Does BEFSR41 sufficient enough to act as a firewall ---for home user---?
or should I install firewall software on every PC?
Thank You
