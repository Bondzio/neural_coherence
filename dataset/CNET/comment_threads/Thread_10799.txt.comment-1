I have been searching cnet's site for a basic how-to for a non-computer-literate person getting their first computer.
One that can take the newbie through the steps starting wth taking the computer out of the box and setting it up, through the first time it is powered on and also covering the basic maintenance steps to take from the start to keep the computer operating at its optimum for the longest possible time, things like the best free antivirus, back-up methods(especially) and other general stuff for optimum performance and health.
It needs to explain things in step-by-step form and assume the newbie knows nothing.
Is there such information on this site that is all in the same place?
I am desperate for a how-to here so that I do not have to try and explain it all for several reasons.
Firstly because the person that needs it will take no notice of what I say and also because I don't actually know it all well enought to explain it in a coherent manner.
If it doesn't already exist, how do I find the right person here at cnet to try and set up a page like what I am after?
begging for help, Tizzanne
