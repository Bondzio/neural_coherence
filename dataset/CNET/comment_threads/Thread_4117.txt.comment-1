I am looking for a schematic for an older Compaq 5BW12 or at least a detailed sequence of what components are tested before permission is granted (via PS On) for the switching supply to power up.
The computer has a 600MHZ Celeron CPU.
The power supply bench tests ok with all voltages ok.
In the machine the +5 volt standby voltage is present and one wire to the front panel switch is at a logic HIGH (+3.66 volts) the other side of the switch is at logic LOW (0 volts) pushing the switch makes both sides of the switch 0 volts.
But the PS On pin going from the MOBO to the PS always remains high (+4.98V) and permission is never given for the switching supply to power up the main board.
Removing the CPU and CPU fan, or the Memory sticks does not change any thing.
Any information or Ideas for additional checks would be appreciated.
Thank you Tom R.
