<s> System: Dell, Dimension 2400 - Windows 2000 In the bottom right hand corner of the screen, there was an icon (like that for the USB port -&quot;unplug or eject hardware&quot;) that was a picture if a camera (for my digital camera). </s>
<s> I clicked on it (like you would to stop the USB port) so I could unplug it. </s>
<s> I clicked on &quot;disable&quot;, I guess that was the wrong choice because now when I plug in my camera it doesn't recognize that there's anything there. </s>
<s> The icon for the USB port is there (&quot;unplug or eject hardware&quot;), but I can't access my G: drive (removable driver) from my computer or the desktop shortcut. </s>
<s> What do I to undo what I did!!!!!!! </s>
<s> Would greatly appreciate any help </s>
<s> Some software that came with the camera you might try opening the program and see if there are any tools or settings tabs that might offer that. </s>
<s> I'm not at all familiar with Win 2000 but if it has the ability to restore back to an earlier date that may bring it back. </s>
<s> If no luck post back. </s>
<s> I have 2000, you didn't reveal brand of your camera, You did say you could still see that Icon. </s>
<s> I fix my own troubles by trial and error, If I had that problem, I would right click in that Icon, look-see if you get a place to &quot;enable&quot;. </s>
<s> If you see &quot;enable&quot; you won't hurt anything to click on it, If &quot;enable&quot; is not there, you can get out of there by placing the cursor pointer out in the open on the desktop, and left click. </s>
<s> And you still have done no harm. </s>
<s> If you get it fixed, please post back. </s>
