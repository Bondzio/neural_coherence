for your question about solid ink...it is neither laser nor inkjet.
solid ink is a new separate class of printer.
the ink is small solid blocks (about 1.5&quot; square), kind of like crayon material.
the printer melts it and so it is always on keeping the ink warm.
the ink sits on top of the paper (doesn't get absorbed like inkjet can).
so, it almost feels like thermography (not quite as high, but you can feel the text when you run your hand over it).
but as you can see from this post, most of us are running into some issues with scratching & flaking on stardream and other papers.
it is crazy that there isn't a reasonably priced printed that we can use.
the search goes on.
the ricoh 811 seemed a bit high priced for me right now, maybe down the road or maybe leasing is an option.
