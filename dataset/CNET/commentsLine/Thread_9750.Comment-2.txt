vista rc2 is &quot;beta&quot; and until vista in whatever version does get released offically, don't expect much help from the s/w vendors until then and expect some drop-out of support as older s/w & h/w is phased out or simply no longer supported.
while you may have more luck with more popular devices or pgms.
as things settle down maybe all this will be cleared-up.
at this point you're on your own or at the mercy of things forthcoming or not.
