as far as the usb thing goes it sounds like your pc does not have usb 2.0. the larger hard drive could be a very easy thing though.
just get the new hard drive and put it in the second bay of your computer.
make sure that the hard drive is set to slave.
then you will not have to go through all the work of mirroring the drive.
you will still have the 80 gb drive just as it ws before, but now you will also have the 250 gb drive.
thats what i would do.
since you already have the 80 gb drive why not use it too.
