first, congratulations.
in making an attempt to back up your stuff you're way ahead of a bunch of folks.
the problem is that you're dealing with a electronic/magnetic/mechanical device and there is no hard answer, there is only advice.
for full time drives in the aggregate, the probability of failure has a peak during the first three-six months, falls off to near nothing then rises slowly for maybe three'ish years then starts a precipitous climb.
at five years you're living on borrowed time.
external drives are a different animal and i don't even want to pretend i know that answer.
life expectancy will depend upon storage handling somewhat but more directly the number of power cycles, total run time and the heat the drive endures.
since you are only hitting this puppy &quot;several times a year&quot; you aren't stressing it much.
the reverse of this is that you aren't exercising it much either, which may be a stress of its own.
this is why military vehicles are driven monthly, but i don't know if the analogy is valid.
suffice it to say, nothing is backed up if it doesn't reside on at least two spindles (separate media/locations gets into another discussion).
be advised that this also means that you're at risk in the period between backups.
