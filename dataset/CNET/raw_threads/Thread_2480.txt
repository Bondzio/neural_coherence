HI we have 5 PCs with windows 2000 installed and ADSL router (4 ports, without USB connector) and a Switch. we need to set one PC as a server or Administrator so we get the internet from it and not directly from the router. the server should have the ability to allow and block any one to access the Internet and even to denies some functions. Any advice would be appreciated.:)
