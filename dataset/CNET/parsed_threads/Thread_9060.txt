<s> I've been developing my site on my home intranet. </s>
<s> My local DNS names are of the order: Host Name/IP addr: musashi 192.168.0.1 Host Name/IP addr: kenshin 192.168.0.4, 192.168.0.5 URL: musashi.mydomain.com 192.168.0.1 URL: kenshin.mydomain.com 192.168.0.4 URL: secure.mydomain.com 192.168.0.5 (VHOST on kenshin) I plan to run an HTTP proxy (probably Squid) on musashi. </s>
<s> Here's my question. </s>
<s> Once I register my domain with an ISP, I'll get assign IPs for the ISP external DNS server. </s>
<s> I expect that the URL will be something like www.mydomain.com. </s>
<s> How does the translation to my internal IP addresses and URL take place. </s>
<s> Let's say I'm assigned an IP like 10.xxx.xxx.xxx how does the resolution to my home page which is on 192.168.0.1 port 80 take place? </s>
<s> Will I have to change my URLs from kenshin.mydomain.com to www.mydomain.com locally or is there a translation process for that as well. </s>
<s> What about secure.mydomain.com (SSL on a VHOST @ 192.168.0.5). </s>
<s> Will I need an additional domain name from my ISP to handle the VHOST? </s>
<s> This is my first attempt at publishing a site so any help will be appreciated. </s>
<s> Sorry my Homepage is on internal IP 192.168.0.4 port 80. </s>
<s> Detail - Details. </s>
<s> The 192.168.x.x is not a valid INTERNET address. </s>
<s> It's strictly for private LANs. </s>
<s> Your public IP however can be used but your ISP may forbid you running a server. </s>
<s> Your choice to see if they would cut you off if you do this. </s>
