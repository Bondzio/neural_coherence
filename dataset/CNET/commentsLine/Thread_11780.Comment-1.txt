on a $1200 budget, i've got two interesting offers from dell and gateway and i don't know which to choose.
i'm not a computer whiz so i need the tech support that these companies offer, but i would like to be able to upgrade the computer in the future.
i do a lot of work on photo shop and pinacle.
not pro stuff.
basic.
what should i do?
