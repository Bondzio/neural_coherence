<s> I am in the market for an external hard drive, USB 2.0 to be exact. </s>
<s> I am wondering what is the best way to go about it. </s>
<s> Should I get one that is already put together like the Maxtor or should I make on by buying an external case and HD. </s>
<s> Is doing it on your own stable? </s>
<s> Is it reliable? </s>
<s> If you can help recommend solutions like what brand of case and hd or whatever, Id appreciate it. </s>
<s> Thanx in advance. </s>
<s> Shop the sales at BB,CC, FRY's, Newegg, pricewatch.com etc. </s>
<s> The first one I assembled the 2nd one was pre built they both work. </s>
<s> Get one that has a good rebate. </s>

<s> I recently purchased two USB2 only enclosures from Newegg for 34 bucks each (free shipping too) and had no problems. </s>
<s> These were plain (no neons) aluminum boxes and are made fairly well. </s>
<s> When the drives fail (and it's when and not if ), I should be able to replace them easily. </s>
<s> I think I saved a bit by going this route. </s>
<s> I have an older Maxtor 40 Gb USB drive that just went. </s>
<s> The USB port was working but when I removed the HD and put it in one of my PCs to check, it wasn't recognized. </s>
<s> I tried a new replacement Maxtor 40 ( I don't know the interface protocol ) but it's dead behind the port. </s>
<s> So I guess there's some interface rules that have to be observed. </s>
<s> Maybe, the Maxtor USB will only work with select Maxtor HDs. </s>
<s> So get the rules first. </s>
<s> Like which class of drives will work, and hopefully will be available a year or two from now. </s>
<s> I recently bought a LaCie 80GB external USB 2.0 drive from Buy.com for $85 and have been pleasantly surpised with its quality and performance. </s>
<s> If you have Windows XP it is just plug and play. </s>
<s> It has a FAT32 format but can be reformatted to NTFS in about 20 mins. </s>
<s> Also, it has an off/on switch which is convenient. </s>
<s> All documentation (manual) is on the CD. </s>
