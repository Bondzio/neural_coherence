It has happened both with Vista 64-bit, and now with Windows 7 64-bit. Originally I thought it was a problem with my graphics cards, so I had the company send me 2 new ones...this did not solve the problem. The reason I thought my cards were the problem, was because it was locking up more during games/video streaming. Now it seems to be random. I am out of ideas as to what this could be...Possibly overheating? Possible power problem? Sometimes it doesnt lock for a few days, then some days it locks every few minutes. Have to reboot the PC everytime it happens. Any ideas/info would be greatly appreciated.
