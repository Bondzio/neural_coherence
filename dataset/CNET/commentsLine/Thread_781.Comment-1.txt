my ibook started making a strange, new noise about a week ago.
it has started making the noise more and more frequently.
i have not a clue what it may be and any hint will be appreciated.
the machine is a 1.2 ghz g4 ibook - 12 inch screen - approx.
3 years old - model m9623ll/a the sound is like an electrical motor starting up.
very low in volume to begin and gets louder (but never too loud).
if i could type out the sound, it may sound something like this... &quot;ma - waaaaaaahhh&quot; it starts out low pitched and gets higher pitched and then drifts off until the sound disappears.
the sound lasts anywhere from a second to as much as three seconds before it disappears.
the sound seems to be coming from the lower, left hand corner where an air intake is positioned.
is there a fan or transformer located in that location?
there is no disc in the cd drive and the hard drive continues to make it's regular faint clicking sound.
i use smart reporter to keep track of the physical well being of my hard drive.
i use istat pro to keep track of other system functions.
i am using my second battery after the first one was recalled.
istat pro says my current battery health is only 84%.
i would appreciate any information anyone can give me.
i can live with the noise but if it foreshadows future problems, i would like to catch it early.
thanks in advance... grim
