ok so i havent found anyone to help out, especially the idiots at best buy and radio shack.
i want to hook up my 2nd monitor to use in addition to my current one.
i thought about a vga y-splitter but that displays the same picture on both monitors.
i have a vga and a dvi port on my vid.
card here are photos: &lt;a href=&quot;  target=_blank&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;  target=_blank&gt; i cant seem to find a dvi to vga converter that works with these.
help?
?
