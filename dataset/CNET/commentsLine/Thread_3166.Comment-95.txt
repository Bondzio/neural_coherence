unless you're tossing an external drive around like a usb key, and allowing it bounce around in the trunk of the car, i fail to see why an &quot;external&quot; drive should fail any sooner than an &quot;internal&quot; one--they are the same devices, just in different cases--as others have cited, some external enclosures are abyssmal when it comes to ventilation, and that's how i lost a 420gib backup drive.
of course murphy was looking over my shoulder at the time, and made sure that the actual failure occurred while three 160gib drives were in a state of flux.
