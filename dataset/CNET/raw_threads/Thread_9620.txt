1601	0	264932	2588784	NR	dsholden	9/20/07 2:46 PM	1.19029956E12	RAM backward compatibility	I inherited a PC with a bad 256Mb PC2700 333Mhz memory card. An upgrade/replacement 512Mb PC2700 333Mhz will cost $20.99. However, I noticed that newer memory is cheaper, i.e. 512Mb PC2-5300 667Mhz is only $14.99. Is the newer RAM backward compatible and does PC2-5300 fit in the same memory slot as PC2700? My hope is that I can spend less for equal performance now, and possibly use the memory on a faster mobo later. Thanks for the help, Don
