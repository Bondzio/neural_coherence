I TRIED TO UPDATE THE MOTHERBOARD WITH A BIOS UPDATE FROM ECS. WHEN I HIT THE UPDATE BUTTON, THE DMI BLOCK UPDATED, THE MAIN BLOCK UPDATED, THE BOOT BLOCK GOT TO 67% UPDATED & THE COMPUTOR FROZE UP. WHEN I RESTARTED THE COMPUTOR, ALL I GET ARE FOUR FANS A BLOWING. THE HDD LIGHT & THE OPTICAL DRIVE LIGHTS COME ON FOR ABOUT THREE SECONDS & THEN GO OUT. THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON EXCEPT COOLING FANS. I SHORTED THE BIOS JUMPER TO RESET THE BIOS, BUT THAT DID NOTHING. IS THIS THING WASTED? CAN IT BE FIXED ? WHAT HAPPENED. ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED, DON'T SUGARCOAT IT.

If that still fails, then you need to replace bios chip, hopefully its removable one(socketed) and contact a bios replacement source. i suggest: http://www.badflash.com and take it from there. A cost(cheaper than new mtrbd.) is involved, but it varies. Also, you can &quot;hot flash&quot; the bios but only if you have access to an exact same model mtrbd.(but tricky). And no, any other at hand bios won't work unless reburned to the specs of the system mtrbd.. tada -----Willy
