<s> I think I may have a uinque little situation on my hands. </s>
<s> I have just received the airave from Sprint. </s>
<s> I received my airave, and set it up as per the instructions - modem&gt;airave&gt;router&gt;devices (and there are a lot). </s>
<s> This, inevitably, knocked my server out. </s>
<s> I've searched around, and I understand that I can hook the airave up behind the router through port forwarding. </s>
<s> This, however, is not an option. </s>
<s> My router allows me to forward 20 ports, all of which are required for my server. </s>
<s> Thus, I can forward the ports for the airave and put the airave behind the router. </s>
<s> I also have investigated the option of a switch or a hub, to 'split' the signal from the modem, and start two networks, one for the router (192.168.2.x) and the airave (192.168.17.x). </s>
<s> From this, I gather that it will not work. </s>
<s> One would need to be classed as the 'gateway to the internet' - and I will be essentially back to where I started, having spent money on a switch. </s>
<s> Thus, I need to find a solution. </s>
<s> I know that there is a firewall settings portion to the airave, to allow port forwarding and act as a virtual server. </s>
<s> I have fiddled with this, yet the default outgoing and ingoing port settings (block on schedule and block always) cannot be removed. </s>
<s> It is not allowing me to forward ports through the airave - so I can't get the server to communicate with the outside world. </s>
<s> So... suggestions? </s>
<s> Is there a way to work around all this? </s>
<s> Why so many networks. </s>
<s> When I setup a second router I configure it as a WAP. </s>
<s> And on page 4 of http://now.sprint.com/airave/files/AIRAVE2.5_Eng_Online_TTG.pdf?INTMKT=MKT:MS:20121004:AIR:MSU:EEE:TechTSEng25 I see you can put your server on that PC port. </s>
<s> Of course if this doesn't have a DMZ to put your server on, then you are indeed SOL. </s>
