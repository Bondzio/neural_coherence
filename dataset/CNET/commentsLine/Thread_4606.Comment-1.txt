i wanted to set up a small wiresless network for my home office.
i am using dial up service to access internet here.
but i got 3 laptops connected via bluetooth.
i am using one of my laptop as the host and the dial up cord in connected to that laptop, now ow to configure the other laptops so as the other ones too can get access to internet when the host laptop does!
i've gone too the manuals, but too complicated and no sucess for me.
plz advice!
