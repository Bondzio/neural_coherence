This is the second time that i tried to build my own PC.
the first was a success but i am having trouble with this new motherboard.
PROBLEM: when i turn on the motherboard the cpu fan spins and so does the power supply case...but my MONITOR doesnt display anything!
it has a VGA port that i plugged the monitor into.
does the motherboard have to be inside a computer case?
this is the same monitor that i'm using right now.
Am i forgeting something?!
here is the mogherboard info: http://store.yahoo.com/bilsystem-store/modupcm815bu.html
