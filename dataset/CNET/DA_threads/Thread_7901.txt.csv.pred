1.4.1	All depends what you mean & quot ; wireless & quot ; .	St
1.4.2	There are a couple types .	St
1.4.3	First you have ISP plans from the cell providers and they have methods to attach to a desktop most via USB .	St
1.4.4	These are expensive and slow compares to most other internet options .	St
1.4.5	Next you have what they call WISP .	St
1.4.6	These are special ISP that use radio to provide there service .	St
1.4.7	There are many types but they almost all put antenna on the outside of your house and run a cable to your PC .	St
1.4.8	There are huge differences in quality and price In general you are still better off with a cable or dsl unless you have no choice .	St
1.4.9	In both cases you are going to to have to search to see if you are in their coverage area .	St
1.4.10	The last option is to hope to use consumer wireless to access a free open internet connection .	St
1.4.11	Most any USB wireless card will work on your desktop but the harder issue is getting enough signal to be usable .	St
1.4.12	You would really have to be close enough to a free public hotspot .	St
1.4.13	Most other options that involve using another persons internet tend to be unreliable and many are violations of their agreement with a ISP .	St
1.4.14	It mostly comes down to you get what you pay for and when you try a free option you will pay in frustration getting and keeping it working .	St
