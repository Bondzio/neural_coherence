<s> I was thinking about buying a lcd monitor and i found one that was on sale. </s>
<s> But i don't know if it's good in performance, so anyone tell me if this is a good monitor in performance. </s>

<s> On a benchmark, I doubt if this monitor will score well. </s>
<s> But lots of popular monitors flunk benchmarks (especially NEC and Sony). </s>
<s> With that said, go look at the monitor and decide for yourself. </s>
<s> Ask them to run it at its native resolution (1280x1024) with stuff that you'll be using. </s>
<s> (Ask them to connect it to a laptop if necessary.) </s>
<s> If you plan on watching movies, get them to play a DVD; if you do a lot of Excel/Word, open those applications; if you play games, fire up a Quake4 demo. </s>
<s> Now do these same tests with a more expensive monitor (Samsungs LCDs are regarded as top notch) and decide if the differences are with the extra money. </s>
<s> I bought the 17inch one and am very happy with it. </s>
<s> I also in fact considered the 19-inch because it has DVI (digital) support and is two inches bigger, but it was also alot more money. </s>
<s> If you are preared to pay for that, I say go for it! </s>
