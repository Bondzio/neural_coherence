I have used a Western Digital drive in one of my PC's for over 5 years without a problem. Am using two internal and 2 external Western Digital in my PC's without any sign of a problem. JR I'm not biased I just happen to give the benefit of the doubt on a subjective basis

ZDNet sold the TV and CNet later purchased ZDNet. Was posting in the old ZDNet forums when all that happened.

I have had some go bad/crash but, that is the desinesty of all HD someday. I but which everone is on sale with a big rebate. John

Now I have seen sparks in computers, like when there is a short circit on a circit board and a voltage shorts to ground. Now it is true that dust can be very flammable. A good reason to clean PCs from time to time. John

I've used all of the three, probably more WD's, but the Seagate 5 year, when the others backed down to 1 year is tough to ignore. My last three were Seagate 5 year jobs, two were the faster SATA's that they offer. So far only warranty collected on was older 3 year WD. They met the promise to return it repaired [or replaced] in 7 days. Good company.

1477	12	110395	1260302	1254618	wahnula	6/23/05 9:04 PM	1.11956064E12	More buffer is better	It's like Chevy vs Ford, all are pretty good, but the fastest is the DiamondMax 10 series, 16MB buffer, NCQ, SATA. There's a new Hitachi that's also 16MB, NCG SATA3G and 500GB. That's gotta be the baddest boy on the block, but pricey. My money's (literelly) in the DiamondMax, I have several and they all kick.

Retail box drives have a 1-year, all the manufacturers are at least 3 and some 5 years on OEM's. Really. Check their websites. Screw Joe Consumer buying at Circuit City, but back up the folks that buy lots and lots of drives.

Get the ones with the best garantee at the cheapest price. And if you want to be bomb proof, think about a 4 disk raid array 0+1
1477	15	110395	1260880	1260748	msgale	6/24/05 6:30 AM	1.1195946E12	Who cares - Not I	All disks drives are about the same. Figure out the specs that you want, i.e. rotation speed, interface (PATA, SATA SCSI), and buffer size, Buy the cheapest with those specs that has best warrantee. I currently use Western Digital (2) Fujitsu (1), and Seagate (2). All disks are SCSI. I had a Seagate drive dies after three years. The Western Digital drives were bought in the Fall of 1997 and are still running. Look for a deal.

Just be sure to avoid Maxtor like the plague. The only drives I have ever seen just die for no reason are Maxtors. I'd estimate I've had to deal with 10-15 dead drives during this one summer job I had working for my High School's tech department and all the drives that died were Maxtors. I don't know what inspired me to do something so stupid (maybe it was the cheap price + rebates) but I bought a Maxtor myself. It didn't last very long and I lost a lot of data on it. I know you can get 200+ GB drives for a little over $100 as a Seagate add showed.
1477	19	110395	1261046	1254639	law_john	6/24/05 7:30 AM	1.1195982E12	Same here	I don't know where you found that out about the Maxtor HDD's however I would only go with Western Digital or Seagate SATA hard drives (if you have SATA) however IDE is also fine. If you where looking at SCSI first of all you need lots of $$ plus a good alternative maybe a Western Digital Raptor drive. You will also need a PCI - SCSI adapter (under $30 for a cheap one). Some good SCSI brands are Seagate and Fujistu.

You should consider building your system with a SATA HDD for faster data transfer rates and easier installation. If on the other hand you are considering SCSI drives then you might want to consider Seagate, as they make a very fine SCSI HDD.

Last year I bought an external drive enclosure, and installed a Maxtor 120GB in it. The drive got hot to the touch, was loud and vibrated. I then put in a Samsung (yes, Samsung!) OEM 160GB drive. It was cool, smooth and quiet. In my desktop I've got a Maxtor and a Hitachi. Can't even hear the Hitachi, while the Maxtor chatters noticable when accessing. I can't comment on Western Digital. Seagates have also always been smooth, quiet, cool and reliable. Seagate is my first choice. Hitachi second. Samsung third.

Replaced it under warranty and the new one lasted 2 years before it crashed. Decided to switch to western digital and it is now going strong at 3.5 years and still counting. Maxtor's in my opinion are not worth the trouble!

Hv not experienced any problems. This is the first time I hv heard of Maxtor being a possible fire hazard. For this item, I generally find Costco have the best prices -- if they have it in stock, but one always order online from them. Costco occaisonally feature Maxtor drives at special Promo prices now & then.

I have found Maxtor to be among the best and I have had the least amount of crashing and hd errors. If you have any technical questions their website is easy to navigate and they have a technical staff that has been easy to understand since I am not that hi-tech.
