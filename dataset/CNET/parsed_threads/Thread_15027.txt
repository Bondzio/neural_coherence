<s> I'm want to utilize Bluetooth USB Adapters (pair) in place of the standard USB cable to connect a Desktop computer (running XP, SP3) to Cannon PIXMA MX330 IJ ALL-IN-1 Printer. </s>
<s> Is this even possible or is there an alternative that will work? </s>
<s> I want to place the printer somewhat remote (~35 FT) from the computer. </s>

<s> Yes, I've reviewed the available adapters but it is not intuitively obvious to me that I can use them to replace the USB cable between my computer and the printer. </s>
<s> As they are relativly cheap, I plan on getting a pair and attempting the connection. </s>
<s> Thanks for the research. </s>
