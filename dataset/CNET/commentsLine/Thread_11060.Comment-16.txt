my not so venerable t5 is not compatible with win 7 (64) and even though i tried the bluetooth connection it was not successful.
after a couple of months of this and that.. i simply dual boot - using my win xp partition when i have to backup or install stuff on my palm.
eventually i will find a pda device that does what i want with win 7. because of work related security issues i can't use a cell phone device so the smart phones are out... although i think the ipod touch will apps will handle the program requirments.. too bad palm..
