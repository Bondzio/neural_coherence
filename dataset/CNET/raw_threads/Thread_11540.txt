I have a problem in accessing the cdrom drive. the problem is it can read DVD Disc but it cannot read or write CD disc. I might say I'm out of option. I have already uninstall and re-install the drivers still it doesn't work. I hope somebody outthere can help me on this and it will be highly appreciated. thanks.

This link is to their XPS forum, which has a CD/DVD forum (listed to the right under XPS Desktop)that should help. You will have to register, but that's no problem. People there are quite helpful.
