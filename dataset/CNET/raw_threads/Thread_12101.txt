CAUSE The PS2 port continues to supply power after you turn the computer off. RESOLUTION To resolve this issue, you can use the USB port to connect your device to the computer. If all of the available USB ports are in use, you can purchase a USB hub. A USB hub increases the number of USB devices that you can connect to your computer. If the continuous mouse light is acceptable to you, you can safely leave the mouse connected to the PS2 port. &quot;

If it doesn't, you will need to replace the batteries in the mouse. I'm not absolutely sure if it's an optical mouse with a cord that plugs into your PC, but I would thing it the light should go off when you shut-off it's power source, which, of course is the PC it plugs into. I've never heard of a mouse with an on/off switch.
