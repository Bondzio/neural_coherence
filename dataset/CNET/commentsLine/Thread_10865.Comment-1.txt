hi everyone, im new to this boared and i saw you guys are all pretty educational in regards to this stuff so i will ask for your opinion i have been looking for a couple of weeks now for the perfect laptop (and as most of you know that is almost impossible to find!)
i ran across the acer as5112wlmi (which is a part of the 5110 series) everything in it looks pretty amazing especially for the price that it is selling for (about 1400 us) i would be primarily using it for gaming and surfing the net but i will also use it a little at school taking notes and what not.
if you could please give me some input on what you think or have heared of this laptop it would be much much appriciated!!
thanx!!
