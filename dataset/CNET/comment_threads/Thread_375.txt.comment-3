I have an old Win98 machine that comes on in the middle of the night too.
I have assumed that it is doing maintenence which is scheduled to be done by the program which you set up to do these things (forgot the name--I don't use the pc much).
Check the program list--I think under accessories.
&quot;Scheduled Maintenence&quot; or some such.
