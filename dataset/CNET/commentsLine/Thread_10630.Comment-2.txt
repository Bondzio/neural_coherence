how long since you did this -&gt;  ?
tell me the os install routine you used.
list date and version for: a. motherboard chipset driver package.
b. sound card driver.
c. video card driver version.
in closing, type bad caps at google.com and look for that issue.
your machine is from the days you see this issue.
