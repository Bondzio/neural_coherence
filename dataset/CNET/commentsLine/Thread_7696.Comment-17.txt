like some have said, most major retailors now have completely switched to selling windows vista.
you'd have to ask an independent local builder or buy a copy of xp yourself at your local electronics store, they still sell them.
as for hd-dvd drive, i'd advise against it.
if the hd-dvd loses the format war then your hd-dvd drive will be good as nothing and you'd have to buy a blu-ray drive.
