if you like bells&whistles, etc.
maybe it won't cut it.
i've seen some pretty niffy setups and other generic cases that people can buy get way out of hand with thier styling which doesn't appeal to me.
you would think some of them were too close to a heat source or that holes everywhere is proper.
basically, you get what you like and feel comfortable with, but i tend to stick with function over form.
