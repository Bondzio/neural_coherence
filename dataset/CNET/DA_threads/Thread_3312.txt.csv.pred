1.1.1	I currently have a Deskjet 5552 printer bought new, and I have only replaced the black cartridge once, even though it is used everyday.	St
1.1.2	The 2nd cartridge has now got empty and I have refilled it with Jet Tec ink, which I have used for many years, but not on this printer.	St
1.1.3	But it will not work!	St
1.1.4	I have been through the cleaning and priming process 5 times now and still no black.	St
1.1.5	Colour is fine.	St
1.1.6	Any suggestions on how to convince it that it does have ink!!!	Ques
1.1.7	nilocp	St
1.2.1	Try an OEM cartridge, if it doesn't work with the mfg original type, you may have an issue, likely wrong ink used in refill.	St
