after you insert a dvd, try double-clicking on your hd icon on the desktop.
the window that is now open should show you along the left side, every device or disc that is mounted.
does a dvd show up there?
also, try launching dvd player first, then &quot;open&quot; a disc from the pull-down menu to see if the player will 'see&quot; the disc.
i gotta tell you, i've never come across a mac with this problem.
i'm stumped.
maybe one of the experts, like mrmacfixit, can figure it out.
