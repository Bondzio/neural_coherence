after many unsuccessful attempts i dissasembled my machine and reassembled it on a table.
i turn it on with a screw driver by jumping it where the power wire would go.
my hard drive and cd/dvd drive are both sata so i have no ide devices.
i unplugged everything and just have the processor and mother board running.
i am hearing 3 beeps in a row consistently
