Is this possible?
I have a desktop that is having internet connection problems, and I'd like to connect it to my laptop so I can download some anti-spyware software and scan that machine.
I guess I'm saying I'd like to use the desktop as an external hard drive.
I think it will make the whole process easier.
I'd preferably like to do this through a usb cable (because that is what I own).
In my mind this should work... but I don't want to try it and end up messing up one of the machines.
Thanks, Java Trish
