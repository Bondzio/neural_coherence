I recently had a HD crash, and when I replaced it I added a new cooler to my video card (ATI 9800 Pro) and a new CPU fan (AMD XP 2600) and went and bought a new HD (seagate ultra-ata 40gb.) to have while the old 80gb. is being replaced. Well now I am unable to get anything besides spinning fans. My HD spins up and video card fans turn but nothing on monitor! Ive tried my Video Card in a friends system and it runs great, along with my RAM (crucial 512 times 2), and processor works fine in his as well. Ive switched between two motherboards (an ASUS A7V600-X, and a Gigabyte not sure model # but def. supports all my hardware) and get the same problem. I also see no HD activity on my towers HD LED, but I hear it spinning. We also tested my monitor (NEC 1980-sxi) and its fine as well. So the only thing that has not been switched and matched is now my power supply. Do any of you think I could get all the signs of normal power yet have a problem with my PS? Ive tried pretty much everything else I think. Any suggestions would help.

It does seem that its just not switching on video and maybe the processor isnt &quot;waking up&quot; either. And yes I have tried what those minimum boot specs. suggest. Maybe when I added my new fans and kept the chassis fan and another blower intact I fried some inner workings that make some power available yet will not let me boot properly. Guess Ill take back the Sempron 3000 I bought last night to trouble shoot and get a decent PS. Ill let you guys know tomorrow how its goes.
