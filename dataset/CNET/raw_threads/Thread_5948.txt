You don't get these at CompUSA and BestBuy, however. They are more sturdily built than most I have seen. I am using an older T30 series for work and it's been faultless so far. T42s come with about everything but firewire built in. It's the one drawback I can think of. You'll need a cardbus (PCMCIA) device for such if you need firewire but USB2 is on board as well as a wireless port. You mentioned needing a network port and this is standard with most anyway. The T42 has an RJ45 port like most. Hope this helps and you get other recommendations.
