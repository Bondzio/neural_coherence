We want to stream internet on them but they don't have any network or internet capability. I have a PC that has a dual HDMI and DVI video card in it. I'm thinking that what I could do is that I could put a DVI-D to HDMI adapter on the DVI port and run two 50 ft HDMI in wall cables to the TVs that way I could extend the PC desktop to the TVs. Showing two different things on both TVs. I'm not sure that is even possible or will work. PLUS how would I do sound for each TV would that be possible. Anyone that can help me figure out to accomplish this or if this would even work I'd appreciate it!

I'm going with no and then suggest a solution. Get a pair of netbooks with hdmi (those 238 buck things at target.com?) and use those. Or maybe a pair of Logitech Revues at 99 bucks each and use the web browser on that. For the network you would have to reveal how you get the internet without &quot;any network or internet capability.&quot; Bob

Some motherboards have DVI AND RGB and sometime even HDMI connections all in one box. My main PC has DVI and RGB, so I use both going to different monitors. I see no difference in quality (16801x1050). On my media PC, I have onle a PCI output, which I run to a small WXGA monitor, and use a USB video adapter VisionTek() for the TV (at 1080p). I have a 5.1 audio card in the box which I use for DVD playback, but you can use a 2 or 2.1 system if you are going to stream internet, because I don't know of any (please tell me if there are) Dolby-encoded internet video sources. I'm almost sure if you get a 1080p capable video card (or mobo) with two outputs, you should be able to do it like that (be sure to ask or try it out). Otherwise, check out a USB video box, they're pretty reasonable. Even a single netbook or laptop might be fit for the job, if it has RGB and HDMI, with sufficient resolution.
