1.1.1	I am looking for a good, but simple, external hard drive with an installed back up system.	St
1.1.2	I have seen some that back up new files each time the computer is turned on.	St
1.1.3	I have also seen those that must be run daily.	St
1.1.4	I'd like advice as to the easiest to use, please.	St
1.1.5	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	Let's say you have your PC (with files) and the external that has a copy of the files.	St
1.2.2	This fails old school IT ideals about backup since backup means you have more than one copy.	St
1.2.3	Wait!	St
1.2.4	You say you have a copy?	St
1.2.5	No, when your PC fails you only have one copy left so there is no backup copy.	St
1.2.6	This simply means you need no less than 3 copies of the files you intend to safeguard.	St
1.2.7	Back to your external hard disk.	St
1.2.8	For me, the program SYNCBACK found with google does all I need and I just moved to a new machine with its help.	St
1.2.9	And I have no less than 2 external hard disks, a few USB memory keys and some DVDRW media with files for good measure.	St
1.2.10	I find most owners don't become serious about backup till they suffer loss.	St
1.2.11	In other words, backup might not be a teachable area but one that is learned.	St
1.2.12	All I can do is share what I do and how it works for me.	St
