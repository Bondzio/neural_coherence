<s> Can somebody please provide me with a link on where Cnet has reviews on flash memory. </s>
<s> Thank you for the help. </s>
<s> The problem is this. </s>
<s> These are commodity items with some few stock designs. </s>
<s> I can get some 255MB SD Stick from Sandisk for about 50 bucks. </s>
<s> There may be no reason for a review since nothing differentiates the sticks of memory. </s>

<s> I have a 256 mb Lexar jumpdrive 2.0 (I got for $50 on e-bay). </s>
<s> It has worked like a charm with my lap top, even when I used it on a Mac. </s>
<s> I am thinking that a 1 gig stick would be even better and before I went out looking for one, I would see if a particular brand is better than another. </s>
<s> I guess they are really like floppies and all about the same quality. </s>
