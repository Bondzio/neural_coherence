Also we want to create a separate guest account within that same network in order to allow clients that may come into the office to be able to log into the network using their laptops, but not have the same access or capability as the rest of the staff. Please let me know what would be the best way to set this up. Should I use a wireless router? Or can I get by with a wireless access point? Thanks

I don't see any reason than to pull out any wifi router you have and try it as an access point. Forgot how? Use this phrase at google to brush up on this. &quot;How to use a router as a wap?&quot;
