i have recently reinstalled windows xp on an hp computer which has the 9 in 1 card reader built in.
my problem is that now when i go to 'my computer' instead of having the drive names all that they say is removable disk.
i am sure all i need is the drivers but i check at hp and could not find them for the hp pavilion a523x.
thanks for you help.
