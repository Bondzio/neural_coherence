<s> If you are running the recovery media creator, that is the standard for creating recovery media on the T6212, and you get the message disk is not blank, give tech support a call 801-401-1419, and ask them for a copy of the restore disks, and they will send them to you, this is a known issue with this software If you are trying to burn it in a DVD, and it finalizes for a long time, and apppears that is will never finish, you are right, it will not finish, this is another issue with the recovery process, the DVD actually has the image on it is finishes finalizing in less then 15 minutes, the system jsut does not leave a message saying that it is done, it has the restore image on it, but the program does not say taht it has. </s>
