1.1.1	Given the way that I am currently using my computer , I do not need a high end computer .	St
1.1.2	But my plans for when I get my new computer built will involve much more intenstive and extensive use of the computer .	St
1.1.3	I plan on having dual monitors with Adobe CS on one and Pinnacle Studio ( video editing ) on the other and moving some photos into the video editor , plus adding music and voice overlay .	St
1.1.4	This brings me to the subject of dual core vs quad core .	St
1.1.5	I have just read two articles with opposing views on the subject so for whatever they are worth I have listed them below Favoring Quad Core : http : //www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2406293,00.asp & gt ; Favoring Dual Core http : //apcmag.com/is_dualcore_better_than_quadcore.htm What are your thoughts .	St
1.2.1	Years ago the discussion began about multiple cores and to this day I smile as while the discussions raged on I had my dual Pentium Pro with the Overdrive package .	St
1.2.2	I got to see and feel the benefit for years while folk , right or wrong ( remember I was already there ) debated if more than one was needed .	St
1.2.3	Today you can see more debate and I 'll smile as I rev up Handbrake and see if use every CPU core and I 'm done while those that went with less pull up such articles to prove they made the right choice .	St
1.2.4	Remember , I 'm already there so in my rear view mirror I wonder what all the fuss is about .	St
1.2.5	Here 's my latest i7 build favorite link : http : //www.pcworld.com/article/2040319/build-the-ultimate-intel-haswell-pc-for-under-1000.html So with that out of the way , is your view from hindsight or guessing what 's next ?	Ques
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	The data of the article .	St
1.3.2	If you were building the machine in 2006 then I can see where a fast dual core might be better than a slower quad core for many folks .	St
1.3.3	The industry had not quite figured out how to use all those cores .	St
1.3.4	Today ... ... the industry has figured out how to split things 4/6/8 ways .	St
1.3.5	Photoshop..video editing ... ... .I 'd jump to the 8 core .	St
1.4.1	Very interesting article but I am still not sure what I need to do what I mentioned .	St
1.4.2	Also , I am trying to find a motherboard that supports more than 6 SATA ports and 2 graphic or video ports .	St
1.5.1	Long ago another traveler had their drive collection .	St
1.5.2	They struggled with 4+ drives and I had made it worse by gifting them some old 200MB drive .	St
1.5.3	I had moved on to a 2GB drive ( large for those days ) and I continue to this day keeping the drive count low .	St
1.5.4	I thought the link I shared had a video card with 2 ports not counting the onboard port .	St
1.5.5	Did I miss something ?	Ques
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	I think it is just my own way of doing things .	St
1.6.2	Even with my ancient machine , I have 3 internal hard drives and 10 external hard drives .	St
1.6.3	I wo n't go into the reasoning for this - just that it is the way I do things .	St
1.6.4	Two video Ports is great .	Polite
1.6.5	I am going to split the difference between the Haswell and its many cores and the dual core .	St
1.6.6	At this moment I am planning on going with Intel 's DZ77GA70K mobo and Intel Core i7 3770K which are compatible .	St
1.6.7	The Mobo will support 9 SATA ports .	St
1.6.8	Thanks again for your thoughts , they are always most helpful .	St
1.7.1	I had to make a decision - which was more important extra cores or extra SATA ports .	St
1.7.2	Since I really have little experience in working with either CS or Pinnacle Studio , I may find it more than I can handle .	St
1.7.3	I have worked some with PhotoShop 5 and with an older version of Pinnacle Studio but that was a few years ago .	St
1.7.4	And as I am The Ancient One ( 85 years old ) I move rather slowly and if the computer moves slowly we will be on the & quot ; same page & quot ; .	St
1.8.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813128592 seems to show 6 classic SATA ports and 2 more for a RAID controller .	St
1.8.2	10 USB ports each with their own fuse and well , seems like a nice board .	St
1.8.3	When folk build PCs my advice is to steal a published design from the web ( tom 's hardware , etc . )	St
1.8.4	as they have usually done the hard thinking about power and more .	St
1.8.5	BOb	St
1.9.1	Considering what you plan to do , you 're already into the top end of PCs .	St
1.9.2	Whether you like it or not , I suspect having a & quot ; work station & quot ; type PC would best suit you .	St
1.9.3	As for more than 6 SATA ports , if you need more I do n't think there are many mtrbds .	St
1.9.4	out there that go beyond that as I typically see .	St
1.9.5	Again a work station being something of a Mack truck configuration is more capable and do-able for grunt tasks as it were .	St
1.9.6	It just gets the job done and depending on the cpu all the better .	St
1.9.7	While having the most multiple-core will do fine , can the s/w use it ?	Ques
1.9.8	Even , if the s/w ca n't use *all* of them it will try to use what its capable of , so it still not a waste .	St
1.9.9	Google for workstation configs and see what 's out there and build similar or buy one .	St
1.9.10	Remember , cheap is cheap so will results be if you lean too much on cost factors .	St
1.9.11	What you plan to do is certainly going to task a PC , so buying top shelf parts will be a plus .	St
1.9.12	If storage seems to be a concern because of the SATA needs , maybe look into NAS or separate storage array setup , like in a RAID server ( guessing here ) .	St
1.9.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.10.1	Thanks for all of the great information .	St
1.10.2	I always look forward to your posts to my stuff and also to other people 's posts .	St
1.10.3	You seem to grasp the totality of what a person is trying to accomplish .	St
1.10.4	I have found several Mobo 's that have more than 6 SATA ports and processors that are compatible .	St
1.10.5	Now whether or not the motherboard and CPU are of high quality or not is debatable , but at least they are within my budget .	St
1.10.6	The combination is set up for RAID configuration , though I have never tried that & quot ; program & quot ; .	St
1.10.7	A server , I believe , is beyond my capacity .	St
1.10.8	And as far as storage , I am looking forward to the eSATA port and getting an external eSATA drive to use for my monthly backup that is kept in my safety deposit box .	St
1.10.9	It is my understanding that eSATA process is a whole lot faster than my current USB 2 external drive which I am currently using for my monthly backup .	St
1.10.10	I do other backups to my internal drives on a more frequent basis .	St
1.10.11	Below is the link to the Motherboard that I am giving consideration in buying .	St
1.10.12	http : //ark.intel.com/products/63244/Intel-Desktop-Board-DZ77GA-70K These are the most important features of the motherboard in regard to my attempt to build a computer that meets my needs : Type of Mobo DZ77GA-70K Socket LGA1155 Max Memory Size 32 GB Memory Types Dual DDR3-2400/1600/1333 O.C Graphics Output HDMI Discrete Graphics 2 PCIe 3.0 x16 # of USB Ports 18 # of SATA Ports 8 # of eSATA Ports 1 RAID Configuration 0,1,5,10 Audio ( Back channel + front channel )	St
1.11.1	Looks good to me , remain with Intel cpu and of course the mtrbds .	St
1.11.2	that support it .	St
1.11.3	As for RAID , do be sure whatever drives you use are similar and capable of the tasks you plan to do .	St
1.11.4	As for back-up , please consider that any back-up plan can falter , so & quot ; redundancy & quot ; is a must for anything critical and important , then think multiple copies of back-up .	St
1.11.5	All this will add-up and make it expensive , so again if that 's what you want that 's going to be an expensive PC once done .	St
1.11.6	You should also consider an UPS or power isolater ( line conditioner ) as well to include a better surge protector .	St
1.11.7	Again you 're rubbing shoulders with the big boys , good luck .	St
1.11.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
