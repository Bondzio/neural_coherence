<s> I thought Dual Core meant that two processors. </s>
<s> But as I see in this motherboard and chip theres only space for one. </s>
<s> Its a Dual Core 4200* 2.20GHz processor. </s>
<s> Unless theres two processor in one chip. </s>
<s> Which one is true guys? </s>

<s> Unless you go with multiple CPU board for Opteron or Xeon. </s>
<s> Read, much more expensive. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> As this prevouis posts just proved a Dual Core Processor is different than two entire CPU chips. </s>
<s> I am assuming the latter would be faster? </s>
<s> My dad's server has two Xenon chips, not dual core. </s>
<s> Is that still single-threaded? </s>
<s> Does it have more physcially because more server stuff is multi-threaded? </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> I think tomshardware.com did a test of 2 single core vs a dual core opeterons (AMDs server chips). </s>
<s> They found that the dual core is a bit faster because inter-cpu communication is inside the chip rather than going across the bus. </s>
<s> (Dual core intels still have to communicate across the bus and are therefore not as efficient.) </s>
<s> Consider this analogy. </s>
<s> Assume you want to collaborate with your neighbor on some project. </s>
<s> If you're in a house, you have to go in and out of your front door to share things with your neighbor. </s>
<s> That same front door is used for your deliveries and your other comings and goings. </s>
<s> You might be bumping into the mailman or walking over your kids while they unload groceries from the van. </s>
<s> You'll be doing the same trying to get to your neighbor's front door. </s>
<s> But if you're in a duplex, you can put a door in your common wall and share things more easily and quickly. </s>
<s> And, your're not adding more traffic to your or your neighbor's front door and walkway. </s>
