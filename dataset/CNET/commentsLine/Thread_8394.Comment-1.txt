hi all.
with the recent hot weather here in uk (i know it is hard to believe) my pc has been getting quite hot.
i get the warning beeps from bios and the northbridge passive heatsink has never been effective so i have a fan blowing air into the open side of my case.
this is a good but a little noisy solution.
the fan is blowing air over all the components in my case including the processor fan but the processor fan blows air away from the processor against the flow of air coming in from the external fan.
i came to the conclusion that this is not good.
can i take the fan off the processor heatsink and reverse it (turn it upside down) so it blows air onto the processor heatsink?
or a little more drastic, cut the fan cables and reverse the polarity of the current?
thanks for any suggestions.
