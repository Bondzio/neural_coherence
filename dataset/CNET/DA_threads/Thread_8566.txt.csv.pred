1.1.1	here 's a question , I have a very fancy surge protector here .	St
1.1.2	.	St
1.1.3	.	St
1.1.4	and my motherboard recently died right after a big electrical storm .	St
1.1.5	my question is , since these surge protectors guarantee to protect you , how do you prove it did n't ? ?	Ques
1.1.6	and get reinbmursed for the fried mobo ?	Ques
1.1.7	-- fj ps just an aside , now I ca n't connect to my cable modem thru the surge protector , i have to go direct to the computer .	St
1.1.8	not sure if it 's the cable or the box tho .	Res
1.1.9	.	St
1.1.10	.	St
1.2.1	The problem is that there was more than one electrical path to the PC .	St
1.2.2	You 've lost the discussion since you had other electrical paths for damage to occur .	St
1.2.3	Sorry to hear about your loss .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	hi bob -- I had only one path -- thru the surge protector .	St
1.3.2	it was a fancy one that allowed for the high speed internet cable to go thru , so all wires leading into the computer ( and power for all its peripherals ) went thru the surge protector .	St
1.3.3	so i repeat my question : how do I prove the mobo failure was caused by the surge protector 's failure to protect it and not just the mobo dying a natural death ?	Ques
1.3.4	-- fj ( fyi , currently the internet cable does not work if it goes thru the surge protector in-outs .	St
1.3.5	.	St
1.3.6	.	St
1.3.7	sorry if that was confusing , it WAS going thru the surge protector before )	St
1.4.1	I take it you have some warranty or recourse in recouping the PC because the surge protector did its job .	St
1.4.2	The best surge protector no matter what brand can only & quot ; reduce/limit & quot ; the damage to a system .	St
1.4.3	If you 're lucky , it stops damage other than itself , otherwise it migrates down the path taking the weakest componets out .	St
1.4.4	A simple electrical surge is reduced or stopped but a & quot ; electrical/lighting & quot ; hit is another matter , you 're dealing with the big stuff well into millions of volts or its range of joules potential .	St
1.4.5	Just call or inform the surge protector co. , that after a surge , the system was n't running when it was before .	St
1.4.6	You should n't need to anything other than that .	St
1.4.7	You can place your system elsewhere to see if it powers-up w/o the surge protector , etc.. good luck -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	You had a cable modem in the brew as well .	St
1.5.2	That 's another path .	St
1.5.3	The damage would have to be very evident such as parts blown off the board for them to say it was the protection device that failed to protect .	St
1.5.4	Sorry to hear about your loss , but seeing PC failures daily for a multitude of reasons I can only write that it 's doubtful since the power supply is next in line for the line voltage to cause an issue and fail .	St
1.5.5	Not the motherboard .	St
1.5.6	Bob	St
