1.1.1	I have an Aluratek 120GB external HDD with an automatic pushbutton backup feature .	St
1.1.2	It was working fine for the past month , but today something strange happened .	St
1.1.3	I had my HDD connected and it was working fine , but then when I had no programs open or anything running off the device , I pulled out the USB cord to put the drive away .	St
1.1.4	My computer gave an error message in the taskbar saying that there was some 'fail to write ' error .	St
1.1.5	I did n't think anything of it because I have seen that message before and the device still worked .	St
1.1.6	Low and behold I try to start up my drive and it does not work .	St
1.1.7	I did not change anything since I last used it .	St
1.1.8	I plug it in , the light blinks red ( usually it just opens the drive folder ) and then does n't do anything .	St
1.1.9	Windows says it can recognize it , but I can not access it at all .	St
1.1.10	If I click on the device menu , it never opens UNLESS I remove the device .	St
1.1.11	Nothing works unless I remove the USB drive .	St
1.1.12	I tried system restore and it did nothing .	St
1.1.13	I tried it on another computer and the same thing happened .	St
1.1.14	It must be the drive .	St
1.1.15	I have a lot of stuff on the drive that I do not wish to be gone , and I would like to know what I could possibly do .	St
1.1.16	I have already emailed Aluratek about it .	St
1.2.1	It is failing , I think .	St
1.2.2	Try this http : //www.runtime.org/gdb.htm	St
1.3.1	If the drive is n't recognized at all , and does n't show up on the drives list if I go to the setup when my computer is booting , does n't that mean it does n't show up on the BIOS ?	Ques
1.3.2	What can I do if there is no way to access my drive ?	Ques
1.3.3	It just locks up my computer and never loads .	St
1.4.1	As supplied most USB drives are in FAT32 format so it works all over .	St
1.4.2	But that 's not very damage resistant and pulling the USB cable without asking the OS to eject or stop the drive is asking for trouble .	St
1.4.3	What next ?	Ques
1.4.4	Try recovery tools like these : GETDATABACK ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY Good luck with that .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Do those work if my computer ca n't access the drives at all ?	Ques
1.5.2	I swear there must be a way to fix the drive .	St
1.6.1	If not , then we move to other ideas like putting the drive into a desktop , etc .	St
1.6.2	Did you try the demos ?	Ques
1.6.3	If not , why not ?	Ques
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	What demos ?	Ques
1.7.2	I 'm sorry I ca n't seem to realize what you 're asking .	St
1.7.3	I might as well just trash the drive .	St
1.8.1	To save me time I put words in all capital letters when they need extra attention .	St
1.8.2	The names are easier to find with a search engine .	St
1.8.3	Try GETDATABACK and ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY at google.com .	St
1.8.4	I do n't like to post links since the address can change and others may have the same issue .	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
1.9.1	I think when you had taken out the drive from your computer it was in working process .	St
1.9.2	You interrupted its working , which doesnot allowing it to work properly .	St
1.9.3	As you have cheked your drive with other system .	St
1.9.4	But you dont need to worry at all as Optimum Data Recovery Inc.is a best data recovery company capable of recovering lost data from a number of storage devices.You can contact them by calling on 800 ) 580 4959 Just follow the link http : //www.optimumrecovery.com/	St
1.10.1	Hi Bob , i hate to cut in here but i have been reading these posts in hopes to learn how to recover my data back from an external hdd .	St
1.10.2	To get to my question - I am trying to run GETDATABACK for FAT32 ( im almost positive that was the formatt ) this program did find my drive and also showed fat32 files ... as soon as it started to skan this disk i got an I/O error on sector 0 ... I continued ... not 5 seconds later there was another bad sector and I/O error.. Should I continue with this scan or should I abort ?	Ques

1.12.1	Sorry but I am so new to this its like reading greek .	St
1.12.2	All of my computer knowledge is self taught .	St
1.12.3	So this data recovery software is telling me to create a bootdisk or a bootable cdrom to run dispatch .	St
1.12.4	so do i need to create a boot cd or my other option is to & quot ; EXTRACT DISPATCH from archive and save to root of ( optional hdd ) & quot ; If i just need to extract then i would pick the hdd that i 'm trying to recover or my actual internal hdd .	Ques
1.12.5	I hope i 'm not being to Simple mined here !	St
1.13.1	If creating the disk was not written in a way you could use then look to other solutions or ... have it done for you at places like drivesavers.com , ontrack.com Bob	St
1.14.1	If you wouldnt , mind would you look over my thread that i started a few days ago ... it explains what i think has happened Where to start with my external 80gb MAXTOR HDD by tayroo1018 - 7/27/07 12:03 PM I will continue to work with the links you gave me until I hear otherwise .	St
