i purchased (2) 200g wd caviars hd's (8mb buffer) and exactly the same thing happened w/ those as you explained.
(loud clickling then &lt;in my case, stalling during operation).
*by the way, those also were purchased from a certain &quot;egg&quot;centic distributor.
they both were replaced by wd and the two replacements were worst?!!
(refurbished of course?
i am now on my 3rd set (and 3rd time starting from scratch &lt;no backups my fault, i know&gt;.
the last call to c/s the tsr tried to tell me that it was normal as well?
i asked to speak to an &quot;upper level tech&quot; (which he did &quot;begrudgidly&quot;) and he explained that drives that size ran hot and that one exhaust fan was not enough?
(nowhere in wd's literature mind you).
he was nice enough to upgrade to two 200g's to 250's.
now with 2 fans blowing across the drives and 1 for heat disbursment..finally..a month w/ o no crashes..no clattering.. ebm p.s.
sent it backkkkkkkkkkk..hd clatter (fresh out of the box) is never a good sign.
