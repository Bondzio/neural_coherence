6105	0	340610	3032775	NR	barkal_l	4/26/09 9:20 AM	1.2407376E12	WD Passport vs Elements Portable	I'm in need of a portable drive to use when on the road with only my laptop, but want to avoid the fuss of the bulkier My Book plus the power adapter. However, I can't seem to figure out what the difference between these two lines is. Since they are both 2.5&quot; FF USB-powered drives, I'm stumped --- anything between these two that should sway my decision?
