There are many Chinese manufacturers out there.
Just asking if this is required to buy the keyboard.
I use a few 83 key mini keyboards for servers and at booths to save space.
After picking up one I found more for 20 bucks at game sellers.
It's the one they sell for the PS2 that connects with USB.
While they don't tell you it works with a PC, it does and at under 20 bucks not a big investment.
