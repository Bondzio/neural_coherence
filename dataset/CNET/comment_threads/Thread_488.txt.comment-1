I bought a brand new seagate freeagent 500gb usb desktop external hard drive from CompUSA (on sale for $120 + tax).
I plan to use it on an older laptop running xp and hopefully a new pc (haven't bought yet) running Vista.
My question is: How can I get a bunch of data off an old PC running windows ME ?
The machine recognizes the device as a USB disk; but it is not available to browse in My Computer.
Thanks in advance, s
