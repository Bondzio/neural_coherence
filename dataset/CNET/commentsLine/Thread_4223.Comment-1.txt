i just got an hp pavilion a6157c desktop with vista premium home, e4400 processor (2.0ghz), 320 hard drive, 2gb ram, integrated intel 950 accelerator graphics &quot;card&quot;.
i downgraded from hp a6077c w/ nvidia 7500le card, because of monitor issues and keyboarding issues that kept being unresolved.
i saved $300, but am now having trouble loading my yahoo browser email.
i freeze.
is this due to my graphics &quot;card&quot; (chip is more appropriate)??????
how do i resolve this.
