be sure we never &quot;repair&quot; or &quot;chkdsk&quot; those drives.
you admitted that there is no backup so any repairs can cause more damage.
if i put the drive into a powered case i usually see the drive and half the time i can copy out the contents (nod to roadkil's unstoppable copier?)
but if there are errors we have to consider cloning the drive and trying the titles noted at the top of this forum on the clone.
some folk don't do that clone step and post they lost it all.
