one thing to first check is that the monitor is plugged in on the mobo.
the monitor should be on first displaying the no signal fault, then turn on the pc.
if the no sig goes away but remains blank, the video bios is not starting.
a rest needs to be initiated.
if still no dispaly, pull all the parts from the case and assemble them onan anti-static surface and connect it up just like in the case.
if things start working, you've got a grounded (stand-off) mounting point.
i like to use plastic or nylon standoffs unless specified to be grounded in the user manual.
sometimes this leads to intermittent shorts as the mobo gets warm and grows a little.
