<s> Hi, I'm looking to put together a mid-range to (low)high-end workstation PC for my own use and I'm trying to educate myself on what parts I should think about getting, but I am stuck on the video card. </s>
<s> Geforce cards are way more affordable than the Quadro FX cards(I'd like to stick with Nvidia.) </s>
<s> In a perfect world I'd like the performance of the Quadro with the price of a Geforce.... but to be honest I've never used a Quadro and wouldn't know how much of a difference it makes. </s>
<s> Would it make more sense to buy a high end Geforce or a mid to entry range Quadro? </s>
<s> Basically, I want to build a PC that will be a great station for me to improve my skills with 3D softwares on, mainly Maya/3DMax. </s>
<s> I use photoshop and painter as well, but I'm certain I won't have problems running those. </s>
<s> I figure Quadros are for professionals who are making money through 3D Design, so I wouldn't need a $1,600 Quardo card, but I'm wondering if a lower end Quadro would be better for learning on than a high end Geforce. </s>
<s> any help? </s>
<s> ...geforces don't. </s>
<s> probably 95% of the time, a geforce will render exactly as a quadro with no issues. </s>
<s> but sometimes, you might encounter quirks or anamolies. </s>
<s> nvidia will not address any quirk produced by geforce drivers in autocad, maya, etc. </s>
<s> but it will address issues with quadro drivers. </s>
<s> likewise, most 3d app vendors test and certify quadro drivers to ensure they work without issues. </s>
<s> the typical quirks can usually be worked around or avoided by changing resolution, screen layout, or just living with a display anamoly. </s>
<s> a card like a $130 geforce gts 250 uses the exact same gpu as a quadro that's 4 times (or more) expensive. </s>
<s> to me the bottom line is this: if you make your living from your 3d apps, then get a quadro. </s>
<s> time is money and you don't want to futzing about with a video card issue when you're on a delivery deadline. </s>
<s> missing it could cost you a lot more than the price of a quadro. </s>
<s> but if you can live with an occassional quirk here or there (and the occassional frustration), then get a geforce. </s>
