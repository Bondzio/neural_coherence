1.1.1	I HAVE JUST RECENTLY BUILT A PC , EPOX MB , INTEL P4-1.8 G 512 MB PC2100 RAM , .	St
1.1.2	THE POWER SUPPLY SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE AND NO PROBLEMS BOOTING OR RUNNING .	St
1.1.3	HOWEVER I HAVE NOTICED THAT EVEN WHEN THE PC I SHUTDOWN THE CASE SEEM WARM WHERE THE POWER SUPPLY IS LOCATED .	St
1.1.4	I HAVE BUILT SEVERAL OTHER PC BEFORE BUT HAVE NOTICED THE HEAT BUILD UP .	St
1.1.5	ANY IDEAS	St
1.2.1	First , check your caps lock .	Sug
1.2.2	All capitals is considered screaming .	St
1.2.3	Any way , you did n't say what power supply you have .	St
1.2.4	Even now , case makers put an undersized 300w unit in most cases .	St
1.2.5	Even worse , they are rated at 300w , they usually actually far below that.For a modern machine , 400w is considered as a desirable minimum if you want to avoid heat problems and lock-ups associated with them .	St
1.2.6	chuck	St
1.3.1	Let me see if I understand .	St
1.3.2	You run the machine for some period of time and then you shut it down .	St
1.3.3	Then you run your hand on the case and find the psu area of the case to be warmer than the rest of the case .	St
1.3.4	I would think that is normal the psu is putting out some serious heat and it has to go somewhere .	St
1.4.1	I have not taken the power supply out yet to look at it , I will take a look it is suppose to be a 350 watt power supply , The actual concern is , I can have the computer off all night and in the morning the area where the power supply is is still warm .	St
1.4.2	thanks for the feed back so far .	Polite
1.5.1	The ATX supply can power a LAN card , keyboard , mouse or other circuits to effect a startup on such .	St
1.5.2	As such , the power supply will produce some heat .	St
1.5.3	Nothing 's really wrong yet .	St
1.5.4	Tell more .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	Thanks for the feed back .	St
1.6.2	I thought that might be the case , although my 2 other machines do not feel warm .	St
1.6.3	That takes care of this one Thanks again , out	St
