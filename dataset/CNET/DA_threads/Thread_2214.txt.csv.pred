1.1.2	Previous attempts at booting this system have failed at checkpoint [ithr].For help in resolving this problem, please note this check point and contact Dell Technical Support.&quot; This is how I tried to solve the problem: 1) Unplugged all USB devices and any other devices except the Monitor.

1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	On top of what Robert offered to do, you should start looking at a replacement or swap it out, the PSU.	Ques
1.3.2	provided a direct replacement or one that can work for the time being, see if that makes any improvements.	St
1.3.3	Besides heat stress, a weak or poor PSU can cause restarts.	St
1.3.4	However, you can stop restarts as that is a bios action upon any failure.	St
1.3.5	In order to stop the re-looping of restarts, do that check the bios and &quot;disable that option&quot;.	St
