1.1.1	I've had my PC for about a year and have used my poineer DVD-RW DVR-104 to create countless CD-Rs, but now I want to create a data DVD.	St
1.1.2	A bought a couple DVD-RWs but I can't figure out how to write on them.	St
1.1.3	I have downloaded 3 different programs (BurnRight!, Burn4Free, and Click n' Burn) but I can't get any of them to burn a DVD-RW for me.	St
1.1.4	Some tell me to insert a blank CD, others try to burn, then say that they have finished with errors.	Sug
1.1.5	What am I doing wrong?	St
1.2.1	Hey, I've never heard about these burning program.	Polite
1.2.2	I always use Nero Burning Rom 6.0.	St
1.2.3	It easily burns DVD or what ever you want.	St
1.2.4	So I think it better use tried software, as I'm not sure that your programs support burning on DVD-RW.	St
1.3.1	I just checked the writing speed on my pioneer DVR-104 and it says the max for DVD-RW's was 1x.	St
1.3.2	On the cover of the DVD case it says 2-4x, is that just the reading speek or is that also the write speed they are designed for?	St
1.4.1	Everything you need to know is here: PioneerElectronics.com According to this chart , it looks like the max DVD-RW write speed for the drive is 1x and you can use only 1x DVD-RW media.	St
1.4.2	However, there is a fimrware upgrade that will allow you to write at 1x speed on 2x DVD-RW media.	St
1.5.1	It could be the cause, but anyway you'd better to have good convenient and clear burning soft where you could check what speed supports you DVD-burner.	Sug
1.5.2	Also check DVD-RW speed: is it the same with burner?	Sug
1.5.3	Good luck!	St
