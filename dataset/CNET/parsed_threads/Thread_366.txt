<s> some of them like lenovo or gateway only allow for 2gigs of ram. </s>
<s> looking into the future, 2 gigs doesn't seem as if it's going to have a lot of staying power. </s>
<s> i need opinions as to whether or not a 2 gig maximum is going to be sufficient say 9 mo. </s>
<s> to a year from now. </s>
<s> i'd like a computer that will not become obsolete all to quickly. </s>
<s> thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Very few home machines get such upgrades and Vista that came with that box is all of 32 bit so that means crazy things like RAM may only register 3 to 3.5 GB even with 4GB installed. </s>
<s> Sorry, it's not a big deal for how long such a machine lasts. </s>

<s> If you have Vista and put a higher-end video card in your system 3GB of ram may be useful. </s>
<s> Vista handles ram differently. </s>
<s> For example, you upgrade to a 256mb dedicated ram video card. </s>
<s> Vista will use up to 1023mb of total system ram for graphics(including the card's 256mb). </s>
<s> So the rest of your system will have up to 768mb less ram for other things excluding graphics. </s>
<s> With DDR2 prices dropping why not? </s>
<s> I put in an extra GB for like $50.00 </s>
<s> Now put your 50 bucks into your video card... </s>
