My file server recently died and now i have the the files in one of my external enclosures, but its a pain to move it from PC to PC. It would be nice if I could access it across the whole network. If anyone has an idea of how to do this, please let me know. Thanks in advance.

But any old PC could do this task. Did you ask around if your friends have a pentium or better PC in their closets?

And I'm just an average high school student, my freinds are not geeks, and like most typical American families, they throw away a computer if they get a new one, so most likely no one has any. I have no job, due to age, and I'm not really interested in spending money for a media server. I guess I can continue lugging around the enclosure -_-.

So the PCs will probably be buried under someones banana. Suggestions always brings conflicts in my case hahah. Thanks for the suggestions anyway.
