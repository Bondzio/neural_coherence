<s> I'm trying to find out if anyone has reviewed the various brands of cd-r's available. </s>
<s> CNET had a very helpful page, with info by someone named Jon Jacobi, covering everything about cd-r's and reviewing brands. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, clicking on the links just gives you a &quot;can't find the page&quot; response. </s>
<s> I'm not computer savvy and I just need someone who can direct me to the right page on CNET (why is that so hard to find? </s>
<s> - rhetorical question.). </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>

<s> Frankly I am buying just two types of CDR. </s>
<s> The HP CDR packages and for Lightscribe the Verbatim. </s>
<s> Zero coasters and issues here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks, RP. </s>
<s> We tried the colored Sonys and are having a bad time with them. </s>
<s> Now on Maxells. </s>
<s> We'll look the Verbatims, if these fail us. </s>
<s> (Though I don't know what &quot;Lightscribe&quot; is. </s>
<s> But don't feel the need to educate me; that could be a frustrating exercise ). </s>
<s> Thanks, again. </s>
<s> If over 2 years I'd try the CD lens cleaner (see google) and if it's some desktop you are looking at under 30 to get a new drive. </s>

<s> Reduce the record speed to 2x or at least 1/2 the speed of the media or drive whichever is lower. </s>
<s> Example. </s>
<s> 52X CDRW, 32X CDR Media = 16X RECORD SPEED to keep it safe. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks, y'all. </s>
