<s> I have read in many places that one of the security measures to be taken with wireless networks is to disable the broadcast of the SSID. </s>
<s> I have tried this and find that I cannot connect to the network with my wireless laptop when the broadcast is disabled. </s>
<s> In order to get on to the network I have to enable the SSID broadcast, scan for available networks, and then connect to my network. </s>
<s> I can then surf the web or access my other wired computers. </s>
<s> Once done with my work, I then disable the broadcast of the SSID until I have need to access again with my laptop. </s>
<s> This seems foolish and not very secure as my SSID is being broadcast for as long as my wireless session lasts. </s>
<s> My question is this: Is there some way to sign onto my network with my wireless laptop even when the broadcast of the SSID is disabled. </s>
<s> Windows XP Home SP2 up to date. </s>
<s> Toshiba Satellite M35X-S329 Linksys WRT54G v1.1 with latest firmware installed. </s>
<s> Security Mode WPA Personal using TKIP. </s>
<s> Thanks SI-PTB </s>
<s> This advice is downplayed. </s>
<s> There is so little gained by doing this and it does break connectivity on many products. </s>
<s> I write &quot;don't do that.&quot; Listen to Cnet's Real Deal podcast and see what they say at http://digg.com/podcasts/The_Real_Deal_from_CNET/208840/d315700.mp3 &quot;Episode: Real Deal 41 - Wi-Fi security Robert Vamosi joins Tom Merritt to talk about the proper ways to secure your Wi-Fi router in your home. </s>
<s> They also discuss safety precautions to use when surfing over Wi-Fi in public. </s>
<s> : I encountered a REAL issue recently with WEP and MAC filters taking a brutal exploit in minutes. </s>
<s> In the next link I share my findings and ask if there is a new crack tool out. </s>
<s> Yes there is. </s>
<s> Read how to fix that at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=242736&messageID=2457489 So if you research that new tool you find it gets the SSID in seconds. </s>
<s> No gain, all pain. </s>

<s> Thanks for the advice and the links. </s>
<s> I will check them out. </s>
