1.1.1	hello .	St
1.1.2	i need guide with my motherboard .	St
1.1.3	my spec is motherboard model-intel PG35EC processor-LGA 775 intel core 2 duo 3.0 GHz gfx-nvidia geforce fx8500GT 256 ram i just bought this new intel PG35EC motherboard.i used to install 4Gb ram ( ddr 800mhz,1Gb for each slot , the motherboard have 4 slot for ram ) on my old motherboard .	St
1.1.4	my new motherboard can support up to 8Gb ram ( DDR 800/1066,4slot for ram ) but when i installed these old rams , it did not boot up .	St
1.1.5	my pc only boot when i installed 2 ram ( 1Gb each ) on 2 different slot .	St
1.1.6	It 's quite a waste for the other ram.can anyone help me how can i fix this ?	Ques
1.2.1	are all of your ram sticks the same voltage/speed/timings ?	Ques
1.2.2	boot into your bios with 2 sticks and manually configure the ram to run at ddr2-667 ( or use fail-safe settings ) .	St
1.2.3	save those settings and shutdown the pc .	St
1.2.4	install the additional 2 sticks and try to boot .	Sug
1.2.5	if it boots fine , then manually set the timings for ddr2-800 at cl 5-5-5-18 and try again .	St
1.2.6	if it still only boots with 2 sticks at ddr2-667 , then you probably have a compatibility issue and would need to replace the other two sticks .	St
1.3.1	give us the precise info mfg. , series and model number .	St
1.3.2	Intel motherboards have been known to be sensitive to RAM voltage and MBs in general can be sensitive to running 4 DIMMs ( 4 @ 1-4GB ) vs 2DIMMs ( 2 @ 2GB ) .	St
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	it is OCZ technology.it 's Gold Edition XTC and it 's PN no is OCZ2G8001G.there 's also number 5-5-5 written on it 's casing , ut i do n't what it means .	St
1.5.1	these is the details of the ram i 've obtained from HWINFO32 DIMM type-regular unbuffered ( UDIMM ) memory speed-400MHz ( PC6400 ) Manufacturer-OCZ Module number-OCZ2G8001G module width-64 bits module voltage-SSTL 1.8V supported cas latency-3.0 ( 3.75ns @ 266.7 MHZ ) , 4.0 ( 3.0ns @ 333.3 MHZ ) hope u or somebody can help .	St
1.6.1	Now that you used that to get items such as & quot ; module voltage-SSTL 1.8V & quot ; did you check the maker 's web site to see if that matched then head to the BIOS to see if you set the BIOS to match ?	Ques
1.6.2	Build your own PCs have taken a turn to more complexity as I find build after build with incorrect BIOS settings .	St
1.6.3	People seem to think this is automagic .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	but there is DC35EC and DP35DP .	St
1.7.2	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	will *any* combination of sticks work as a pair or is it only a certain combination of sticks that work as a pair ?	Ques
1.8.2	did you set the memory timings to ddr2-667 and try all 4 ?	Ques
1.9.1	it is DG35EC.i 'm sorry.i 've confirmed this.i 've went to bios and changed from 800Mhz to 667 and 553.but after i turn off my pc and add the other ram , it did not boot up.i almost want to giving up and just buy another 2GB ram , but i 'm afraid it will not compatible with the other 2 ram of 1GB .	St
1.10.1	i 've changed the settings in bios.to 667 and 553.nope.it 's not working man.thanx anyway .	St
1.11.1	and will the PC run on the new DIMMs if installed without the old DIMMs ?	Ques
1.11.2	VAPCMD	St
1.12.1	i 'm really sorry.but i 'm not used to some of detail about hardware.what is dimms actually ?	Ques
1.13.1	That 's an acronym for dual in-line memory module , as shown by http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIMM It 's just the memory card you click into the motherboard .	St
1.13.2	Kees	St
