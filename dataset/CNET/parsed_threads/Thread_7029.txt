<s> I am using a Windows XP Professional computer. </s>
<s> I just bought the Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 1000 to replace the same set. </s>
<s> The set contains a wireless mouse and a wireless keyboard. </s>
<s> When I move the cursor to the right edge of the screen with the mouse, the cursor will often will move on its own to a different place on the screen. </s>
<s> I tried adjusting some of the settings in the Mouse Properties screen but that didn't seem to help. </s>
<s> What could be causing this problem and how do I fix it? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Pack it up and return as defective. </s>
<s> If it is wireless or not, the optical mouse some times have the same problem, even the laptop tracker. </s>
<s> Its because of 3 reasons. </s>
<s> The first one is the mouse pad on which you move the mouse. </s>
<s> Some colors doesn't reflect the rays from the mouse. </s>
<s> so if you move the mouse to the color where it can reflect it the mouse pointer jumps to it. </s>
<s> second thing the mouse battery as well as the tracking of wireless receiver and your mouse. </s>
<s> Don't take the mouse to near the receiver and press the button to identify it. </s>
<s> put the mouse in a place where you are going to use it and press the buttons at the bottom of the mouse and the receiver. </s>
<s> third one is the driver. </s>
<s> check the driver is correct. </s>
