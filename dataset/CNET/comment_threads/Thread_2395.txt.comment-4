Ok, without the make, model of the printer I can't answer about color carts.
But in a nutshell just look at the offerings.
It will sink in quickly.

Sorry, 2 decades of watching others try and I decided to never do that myself.
Instead I only print what I really really really (times infinity) need.
Big savings.
