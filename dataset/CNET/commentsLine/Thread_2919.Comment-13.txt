three times in the company i worked for.
they were not happy when i insisted that they buy a new hard drive to replace the one(s) that failed, but when i got back all the data on the drives, they were thrilled.
i used file scavenger.
i took a computer with a &quot;blown&quot; drive home, used a new hard drive in a hard case (making it a second hard drive) and ran it overnight.
no one noticed any difference.
and, after i did a format several times on the &quot;blown&quot; drives, they worked a charm, so the purchase of the new drives was not so much the blow to the budget they thought.
i used those drives to back up the idiots who lost the drives in the first place (iic did not want me to back up anything but the server).
now that i'm gone, i hear the entire server when belly up -- second time in two years -- and i am so glad i'm not there anymore.
i've tried spin right on new boss' computer, but didn't work -- file scavenger did the work for me.
new that boss has a &quot;blown&quot; drive and the people she's hired has said: get a new computer.
well, she simply cannot afford that right now.
i'm telling her that i can try to get her drive back.
plus, she has two other computers just sitting there.
the tech she hired told her they are &quot;too full&quot; to be rescued.
baloney.
get rid of all the stuff those folks downloaded -- music mostly -- and they will be just fine.
they are in the business of selling computers and i cannot get her to understand that.
she's been completely scared by her brother who worked there after i went on leave of absence, and she's scared of me.
sheesh.
what good would it do for me to mess up computers that she's already been told are useless?
i can't get that little bit through her head, bless her heart.
