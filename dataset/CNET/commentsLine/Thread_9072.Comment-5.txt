if it is a heat issue, wouldnt the problem be more progressive, and more pronounced over time?
right now, i start the computer after hours of it being off and it will stutter.
i keep it on for a week straight, and there is no worsening or improvement of the situation.
im sorry if i sound stupid saying this, i am definitely no expert when it comes to computers (hence why i am here, lol)
