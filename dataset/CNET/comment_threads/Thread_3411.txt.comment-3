Thanks for the tip - however I forgot to mention, I can connect to someone elses (a neighbour?)
unsecured wireless on my laptop without any issues.
Is that kind of the same as testing it at a free wifi hotspot...?
Having done that, I've tried resetting the router several times already and gone through the setup process as per the sticky and using the manual.
The lights are all blinking as normal, too.
