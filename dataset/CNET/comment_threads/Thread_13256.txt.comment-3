I understand basically how to set up the access point.
I think my question is a little more basic.
I need to maintain wireless G access in my home network but don't want to negatively impact the wireless N performance.
I'm thinking that hard-wiring a wireless g access point from my wireless N router (D-Link DIR655) will let the router run pure N instead of downgrading the speed with g trafic.
The access point will let my Wii and guests to connect with g. True?
