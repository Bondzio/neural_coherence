Second....I also have ATI AIW 9700 Pro and in Device Mgr, it always shows two entries by default.
If you read through the install text (read me file) it will explain to you somewhere in it that this is normal.
So I would gather that your weird issue isn't related to that, and request that you describe what's happening.
