anyone that recommends it.
no matter where you install application sw including games, some files will be placed on the drive with the os.
so some of the files will be one place and other will be on the external.
using the external will usually be slower because it's running thru usb and if there's lots of reads and writes...the drives will usually run hotter in the external enclosure than they would if running internally.
generally speaking ... a bad idea in my opinion.
