I have an Asus P5KPL AM EPU motherboard on an Antec VSK-2000 casing (with HD Audio front panel) According to my VIA HD AUdio deck software driver, the rear audio connectors are used for external PC speakers, and the front audio connectors are meant for headphones.
Does it mean that I can't connect an external PC speaker to the front headphone jack?
Will it fry the motherboard?
Or the front and rear audio jacks are interchangeable, and just ignore the VIA audio driver?
