I plug it with my hard disk from my old pc P2 233MHz MMX running on Windows 98 and when turned it on, it gave an error message - Non system disk. When I ran the setup during boot up, it saw the hard disk and when I ran Windows xp install, it detected the hard disk and saw it had another OS in it. Any thought what's wrong here?

Did it ask if you wanted to install XP on the same partition or???? Possible problems is because proprietary computers such as Compaq's and especially the older ones had data stored on a hidden partiton telling the system what hardware it has and has the drivers. TheBIOS may be confused by the different drive. Can you boot up with a 98 boot floppy? Can you get into the BIOS to boot from the floppy first if it isn't already set that way. Did the drive show on the boot screen????

I just want to test whether xp sees my hard disk. The pc did not come with a floppy drive either so I have not tried boot up with a 98 boot disk. But the drive did show in the boot screen. If indeed some required data is stored in the hidden partition, how can I overcome this? If I format the hard disk and install the windows xp, do you think it will solve the problem?

What slave did you set the H.D to run on during installation, try the Bios settings during boot up and have a look at what it is recognising the HD at, Primary, Master, then come back, it could be this, i had a similar problem not long ago with a compaq trying to install 2000 Prof over Win 98, it did'nt like it, have you, or can you format your drive!

I am using this HD in my old pc and since the old pc is too slow that I bought this used Compaq. I thought it will work if I just plug the HD into the new one. I can format the HD and install windows again if it is necessary, I am just too lazy to install everything back to it. Beside I am not sure whether I will get the same error after the re-installation. If things still do not work out then I have to give it a try. But it will be my last resort.

For the mobo drivers you should be able to get them from the Compaq website [now HP because they merged]. You should also be able to find the drivers at the HP site. This assumes that you know the exact model number of the Compaq system. Possibly your Win 98 has some corrupted files which prevents it from being seen, but enough good ones for XP to see that it is there.
