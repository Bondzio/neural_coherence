4848	0	98986	1133608	NR	wrytat	4/18/05 2:42 AM	1.11379212E12	Application Sharing	I have a computer that has an application that I would like to share with a user who is using another computer. And most possibly, the user on the other end can control the application that's on my computer. My computer is located at Singapore, while he is at China. How can I do it? I know it's something like the MSN application sharing feature. But that one requires me to initiate. I want the other way round, i.e. he can directly connect to my PC and use the application without even my consent. What software, hardware, IP address or whatever do I need? How do I setup? Does anyone know? Thank you.
