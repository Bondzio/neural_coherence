I can copy CD and burn home DVD movie to the hard drive but is unable to copy the home movie DVD into a DVD disc. Although the message of Nero showed burn is successful, the copied DVD always changed to the CD drive in my computer. So the DVD player or software is unable to open it. Have you seen this type of problem after burning, the copied DVD disc has changed to the CD drive? Is it DVD burner defective?

My laptop DVD-RW drive still can copy CD and DVD into the hard drive as well as play the DVD but just cannot burn the DVD disc. After burning (The message displayed &quot;Burn Success'), the burned DVD changed to the CD drive in my computer. The other PC also read the burned DVD as the CD drive. Do you know why the burned DVD changed to the CD? Is the drive problem?

It is possible the drive doesn't support this media. But details would have to be found about the drive, firmware, media ATIP information etc. Bob PS. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=atip+frame+information+cdr+faq

So it is not readable by any DVD player or DVD ROM. I beleive the DVD drive has been defective. I tested by a new external DVD drive. It works. I just do not understand why the defective still can copy CD or DVD into the hard drive and why burned DVD disc has changed to the CD drive in my computer. The burned DVD disc is supposed to be DVD drive, right?

There are other things that could cause this but not a word about cd/dvd emulators, old cd/dvd recording software etc. When you see this you know to eject it all and head back to stock. Then install nothing that is &quot;resident&quot; (evil?) Given the low cost of the drives I don't play with them long. The hammer looks cheaper. This sentence: &quot;However, the drive still can read DVD and copy CD, and burn the DVD into the HD.&quot; Is either a typo or telling us something. I can't tell which. That burn the DVD into the HD is odd. What is that? Bob
