Personally, I let windows XP software run the adapter, so it really doesn't matter a whole lot what adapter you but. Sure, some will have a bit better range than others, but if you're well within range anyway, it won't matter. Some models have a little &quot;stand&quot; to set the unit up so you get better reception. Other cheaper ones don't. Depends how close you are to the wifi router/AP as to whether or not you need a stand. Here is a cheap TrendNet model that is low profile and liked: http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=50741847&pfp=browse&tabtype=rv#review You can also go with a PCI Adapter, if you have an open PCI port. But I hear those can be a booger to get working sometimes. I've never installed one.
