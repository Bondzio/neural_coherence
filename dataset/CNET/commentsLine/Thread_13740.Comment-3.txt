yep i have disable the intel cpu turbo as well as intel speed step.
the cpu is on a extreme power save mode.
have re-seated the cpu cooler a number of time.
what's strange is that if there was damage to the cpu/mobo/psu there would be other signs, at the very least there would be bios error codes on startup.
and my cpu has never been stressed, the oc on it has always been moderate and it's temps barely ever went past 45c.
