However, I can not find a web cam that is affordable and able to transmit video at night. Can someone help me? I've already ordered one web cam from Logitech, because it seem to generate great reviews and able to work in dimmed light. Is there any other cams that is able to deliver great video quality in dimmed and/or total dark? Thunder

So total darkness is not an option. For this we use IR Illuminators and black&white cameras. You may have to skip the USB web cam for such a specific application and use some video capture port and the right cameras. Here's one example. http://www.2mcctv.com/index-SecurityCameras-BlackWhite.html Notice the 0.1 or lower LUX rating. Add IR light if you want to really see in the dark.
