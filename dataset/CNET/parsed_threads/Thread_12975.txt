<s> Hi there, I have reluctantly upgraded to Vista Home Premium, the new computer came with it! </s>
<s> I have been having constant &quot;hardware&quot; bluscreen events. </s>
<s> My supplier has changed everything but the box, 3.5 disc reader and card reader yet this problem still occurs. </s>
<s> If you Google &quot;bluescreen Vista&quot; it seems it is a common problem, with several advertisers offering quick fixes? </s>
<s> Microsoft will not help as it is not a problem they will admit to. </s>
<s> How do I make me computer reliable? </s>
<s> Thanks and regards dunlor </s>
<s> I have a two year old HP Media Center Computer. </s>
<s> I ran out and purchaed the Windows Vista Home upgrade the day it came out. </s>
<s> So far, the only issues that I've had are compatibility issues (drivers, software, etc). </s>
<s> I've not had any blue screen events, no error messages, nothing like that. </s>
<s> I've restored Media Center a couple of times, but I always go back to Vista. </s>
<s> I like the way it looks, and my computer seems to boot up faster. </s>
<s> Sounds like your issues could be the computer itself, out of the box. </s>
<s> You neglected small details such as the BIOS version, HP's patches to run Vista so I can't tell if you've done it all. </s>
