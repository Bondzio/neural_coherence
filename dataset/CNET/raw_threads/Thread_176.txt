I'm getting ready to start a new build in a few weeks and need opinions on which processor is right for me. Like the thousands of other threads across the internet I'm deciding between the E8400 and the Q6600 but also looked at the E8200 and E7200. I ruled the E8200 out right away since for only $10=$15 I can get the E8400. I don't game very much now since my current system is over 5 years but wouldn't mind gaming once I build my new system. Besides doing some gaming I use Photoshop CS3 quite a bit for photos and graphic work, The GIMP, occasionally Dreamweaver when I need to update my site, web surfing and listening to music. I watch movies too and would like to able to play back HD content(720P and 1080P). Which processor would fit my needs? I plan on keeping this computer for at least 3-4 years maybe longer. I'll update the GPU every year or so. Although the quad core isn't really being utilized right now it seems to be the most &quot;future-proof&quot;. I understand the logic behind this but in 3-4 years won't the Q6600 be a little under-powered, even at 3Ghz+, to really matter? The E8400 is faster now but is still only dual core. Any advice on the parts I selected is much appreciated.

It's the latest quad on the market and the same price as the q6600(a little more, but worth it). When talking about overall design, the quads are the future. Without getting to complicated, programs and executions can be assigned to operate on individual &quot;cores&quot;. The quad cores will be optimized to move massive amounts of calculations by doing this. Besides the awesome numbers and benchmarking these things produce, they are the best overclocking processors on the market. I personally have seen a q6600 @ 2.4Ghz get to 3.8Ghz without breaking a sweat. They claim the q9600 will go even further. Regardless of application it makes sense to go with the Quad. Duals will lose their appeal shortly. Hope this helps and you are successful in your build.
