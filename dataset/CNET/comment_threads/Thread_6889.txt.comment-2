Hai Till this date, i have been a Preferred Dell Customer.
I have bought nearly 7 Laptops from Dell (For Me and my friends).
They have a wonderful price range, awesome components to choose from and customer support.
Never had a problem with them.
If u really need to compare ur deal made with Hp, go to dell.com and compare the same configuration with Dell.
u will certainly going to feel like a LOOSER.
Dont give people a wrong impression just because u r not able to live up with the world.
I mean to say &quot;USA is not the only country which speaks English&quot; all the best with ur computer
