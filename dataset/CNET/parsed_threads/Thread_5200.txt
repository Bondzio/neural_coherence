<s> I just read this article and I really have to agree. </s>
<s> To me, Apple could be signaling the decline of the DVD drive by excluding it with the MacBook Air. </s>
<s> This is similar to the original iMac and floppy drives, although I think that the transition to internet-based services and/or other forms of storage while be more subtle than that. </s>
<s> The Air didn't bring out anything new; other notebooks already excluded an optical drive. </s>
<s> But aside from burning a few videos, or watching them, most people may not need optical drives in their portables anymore. </s>
<s> For Macs, newer abilities like remote install can contribute to this. </s>
<s> Use a desktop computer as a base and share the optical drives over a network. </s>
<s> In theory, it all sounds great. </s>
<s> I can say that when I'm out and about, I turn to a flash drive for external storage should I need to save some files, etc. </s>
<s> I hardly use my MacBook Pro's disc drive unless I'm importing audio files, or when I throw a movie in on a long trip. </s>
<s> With these thoughts in mind, the MacBook Air would be a great mobile machine, although a somewhat faster processor would be nice. </s>
<s> With Leopard, it would be good to have an upgrade path to 4GB of RAM and a 2.1 or 2.4Ghz CPU, now that Apple uses Penryn chips. </s>
<s> 2.1 would suit it better. </s>
<s> Add in a removable battery and the Air would be just about &quot;perfect&quot;. </s>
<s> That new 256GB SSD would be good, but for now, conventional hard disks are more practical. </s>
<s> It's pretty interesting to see where all of this technology is going, and how it has evolved already. </s>
<s> So I'm wondering how Mac portables are going to change if the market follows a course similar to this. </s>
<s> Until Apple issues a complete overhaul of the MacBook and MacBook Pro designs, not much is going to happen anyway. </s>
<s> So, what do you think? </s>
<s> -BMF </s>
<s> In practice it's not been that great always. </s>
<s> I've always found that it's better to fish out the Superdrive (which sucks in all sorts of ways, but we won't go there). </s>
<s> I like having a drive. </s>
<s> And on other genuine ultraportables (not crippled lightweights like the Air) I have the option without any penalty in terms of weight, runtime or even in many cases genuinely usable power. </s>
<s> That gives more reason to improve other components, but with things like the Air, you are trying to get a package that is too small for current technology. </s>
<s> And with that, you still make a lot of compromises. </s>
<s> Sure 1.6 or 1.8Ghz is pretty good for an ultraportable, but if you're using Leopard, you may think otherwise. </s>
<s> This concept won't advance for awhile, unless Intel really does a good job with the new Atom CPUs. </s>
<s> Smaller processors will go a long way in ultraportables, no? </s>
<s> -BMF </s>
<s> The concept won't advance for a while and until then, I will need a drive. </s>
<s> And it's not that 1.6 or 1.8 is too slow for Leopard - it isn't, it's just that the Air has poor cooling of its peripheral components which also affects the CPU's ability to cool itself. </s>
<s> The shell itself doesn't get anywhere near as hot as the Crudbooks / Pros, but like almost everything Apple I've encountered since '06, it is designers pushing the entire production process and not the engineers. </s>
<s> The result is that when I stack up my 1.33ULV Vista-based SSD notebooks against the Air, the Vista notebooks in many situations are faster (yes, even with Glass on). </s>
<s> And that's pathetic, since the Air has none of the versatility of the ULV machines - no docking station, no ports, no crucial wireless connectivity even, and even what's built in - 802.11 / Bluetooth - sucks in comparison to comparable portables. </s>
<s> In case you're not clear, nothing in the Air is too small for current technology. </s>
<s> It may be too small for Apple to accomplish without problems but that's a different - and typically Apple - matter. </s>
<s> although the Air has been purpose-designed it is not an ultraportable in the vein of the Sony TZ or even the X300. </s>
<s> It is more a Macbook that has been stripped of everything in order to make it supposedly compete with the likes of the Sony and Lenovo. </s>
<s> The Air may fit into an envelope but in reality it pushes no envelopes apart from that of marketing. </s>
<s> In terms of actual build quality - i.e. </s>
<s> how it stands up to everyday use, not just fit & finish - it is somewhat worthless unlike the X300 or the TZ for example. </s>
<s> Apple knows that a sexy skin will sell whatever crap they've put inside to the majority of the Great Unwashed who don't know better. </s>
<s> The only reason I still have it, as I might have mentioned before is that I would like to run OS X on something that I can actually carry. </s>
<s> However it is a monumentally rubbish - and I will also admit monumentally pretty - lightweight notebook. </s>
<s> in the sense that it is lightweight as you say. </s>
<s> It's footprint isn't small, but you can carry it and stick in several places because of its &quot;thick/thinness&quot;. </s>
<s> It is &quot;portable&quot; and more so because it is easier to carry; that's the bottom line. </s>
<s> However, it isn't small . </s>
<s> It's light, and that's why it will never be a true replacement for the old 12-inch PowerBook. </s>
<s> Personally, I would go with the Air just because I can use the OS on it, but I still think I would get more out of the Lenovo X300 with all of its connectivity options. </s>
<s> It's running Vista on a slower processor, it's not as &quot;shiny&quot;, nor is it as thin. </s>
<s> But we all know that Thinkpad will get the job done. </s>
<s> I think that the Air concept is a good one, but its designated target is somewhat slim in comparison to other portables. </s>
<s> Honestly, for less money, I'd go with a much more powerful MacBook. </s>
<s> The only sacrifices there are the cosmetic features and the weight, but really, you're only giving up the ambient light sensor and aluminum enclosure. </s>
<s> The Air is pretty sweet. </s>
<s> Just picking one up and using at the store for a few minutes tells you that. </s>
<s> I like how it looks, but that's not why I try it out. </s>
<s> The trackpad and its weight are far more interesting. </s>
<s> I watch the screen, and that's about it. </s>
<s> Apple knows what it's doing with the Air, but until they can get it up to speed, put in more storage and offer removable upgrades (RAM, batteries), there's no point. </s>
<s> Version 2 should be much better. </s>
<s> If Apple can bring the Air up to specs and performance comparable to the standard MacBook, then it's just a matter of how much portability you want and how much you want to spend on it. </s>
<s> On a side note, I just got an AirPort Extreme card for me old iMac G4, and I was more interested in looking at the new iMacs at the store than the Air. </s>
<s> Installing the card in the base of the computer was easy; connecting to the network, not so much. </s>
<s> The area between the user-accessible RAM slot and AirPort slot in the base is made of plastic or something like it, so I tried to be careful, but I didn't plug the antenna cable in the card all the way. </s>
<s> Big mistake. </s>
<s> Course I opened it back up and got it running now. </s>
<s> Gotta love this lampshade. </s>
<s> What bothers me is that the software install disk for other AirPort utilities installs the now dysfunctional Internet Connect app (which works in Tiger, but not in Leopard) and some other AirPort utilities that I will never need. </s>
<s> Apple should make those disks more current... whatever, I just threw the three apps in a folder in my Utilities section. </s>
<s> I got this thing working now and I don't feel like deleting anything in case it something happens. </s>
<s> Too bad it is only WiFi b/g. </s>
<s> But it is plenty fast now. </s>
<s> I would much rather get another MBP over the Air. </s>
<s> 1-inch thick is still amazing to me, and 2.5Ghz is whopping fast in a portable computer these days... </s>
<s> I need my existing one to be looked at anyway. </s>
<s> Both the keyboard and aluminum exterior aren't quite perfect (minor case separation and crooked keys...). </s>
<s> But it's solid and is what I expected out of a Mac, save those cosmetic problems. </s>
<s> The Air is all looks and weight I think. </s>
<s> Again, it won't be worth it till Version 2 or 3, like the iPhone. </s>
<s> I see the 3G iPhone becoming a big seller. </s>
<s> Only a few more days till WWDC and then we'll see. </s>
<s> -BMF </s>
<s> Are no less compromised, but obviously in different ways. </s>
<s> I have several Macbook Pros in both 15&quot; and 17&quot; sizes - in fact several Macbook Pros for every generation there has been of them - which have similar but not identical heat issues, and there's the problem of durability and build quality. </s>
<s> I really am not used to my supposedly premium notebooks warping for example, and there are several other problems that they still seem not to have addressed fully with even the current incarnations. </s>
<s> I also have other premium mainstream-sized notebooks from other manufacturers once again kept current through the generations and there are very good reasons that I call the Apples Crudbook Pros. </s>
<s> For me, looking good isn't enough - it has to work right as well. </s>
<s> I've also recently bought my first Macbook since a disastrous encounter with them back in '06. </s>
<s> Better certainly, although with the litany of failures/defects the 06 Macbooks had I would not be surprised. </s>
<s> However an XPS M1330 is still so much better in various aspects. </s>
<s> for me anyways... Sure it looks good, but it goes way beyond that. </s>
<s> The OS looks good too of course, but again, not my point. </s>
<s> My MBP has performed to and exceeded many of my expectations over the period of time that I have been fortunate enough to use one. </s>
<s> I must say, I could care less about heat issues (I use it on a laptop stand to deal with that), the graphics and other hardware are superb, and overall it's been great for me. </s>
<s> Now I can't say the same for everyone, but for the most part, Apple's got a good thing going. </s>
<s> My only quarrel with Apple has been over build quality (Ex: AirPort problems, case &quot;warping&quot;, etc.) </s>
<s> and afterwards, Apple just replaced the thing with a newer one. </s>
<s> That one now sits on me desk, and with its newer, though somewhat dated today, Santa Rosa technology, it's much faster than its predecessor. </s>
<s> The only &quot;problem&quot; with this model is the build quality, and really, it's not even very bad on this particular machine, so I'm grateful for that. </s>
<s> But Macs are supposed to be &quot;premium&quot; machines, and I have AppleCare, so I expect this issue to be eradicated all together. </s>
<s> The keyboard keys should be looked at too, but the main issues lie in the screen bezel, the aluminum above the MagSafe charger port, and the area above the DVD drive. </s>
<s> That's where it is separating, and it would seem that it only gets worse over time, just like my previous MBP. </s>
<s> Now that I have my iMac all fixed up and running, I actually have a reliable Mac to turn to while the other is in for repairs. </s>
<s> Now that I think about it, it would be a quick repair anyway, since this time around all of the internal components are working perfectly (or so it would seem, LOL). </s>
<s> All they would need to do is put in a non-crooked keyboard, and replace the aluminum shells around that, the screen, and on the back of the screen to fix the issue. </s>
<s> Still, I think the MacBook Pro is one of the best notebooks out there. </s>
<s> Cosmetic issues don't always affect the computer itself, and it works great as a computer, so I think that's where it scores big. </s>
<s> -BMF </s>
<s> I go by machines not going wrong in the first place, or not having obvious faults, as a measure of quality and certainly what is 'best'. </s>
<s> That the hardware is readily replaced by the manufacturer is not a measure of such to me, especially as it means downtime for any reason - diagnostics, visit to the Apple Store, etc. </s>
<s> I have spare machines but they are for emergencies (and for the other non-Apple machines I have as spares, they are), and not for what seems like almost routine use (in the case of Apple hardware). </s>
<s> I of course acknowledge that people who do nothing particularly critical or worthwhile on their computers might feel otherwise. </s>
<s> I suppose this is what Richard Dawkins feels like when he's talking to a fundamentalist Christian... </s>

<s> I don't come to argue or flame out at other forum members, and if you thought that was directed at me, be aware that I did not take it that way. </s>
<s> Also, I was merely discussing some points of the notebook market within the computer industry with fbbbb. </s>
<s> I don't need to be put in my place, so to speak, and I was not &quot;out-of-line&quot;. </s>
<s> Do you think there was an actual argument here or a discussion? </s>
<s> FYI, I do a lot of &quot;critical&quot; work on my Macs and which is why I cannot last too long without them, which I believe I have mentioned before in some form or another. </s>
<s> To fbbbb: I have decided against bringing in the MacBook just because the problems are so minor and have no impact on the functionality of the machine whatsoever. </s>
<s> And correct me if I was wrong in my above response to the &quot;not so&quot; innocent_bystander. </s>
<s> You know, once I get some more RAM installed in the Macs, I'll have them really screaming. </s>
<s> I'm currently ordering a 4GB set and a 1GB stick for them. </s>
<s> Leopard will work very well with the memory boost. </s>
<s> Have you seen those rumors regarding OS 10.6? </s>
<s> No more PowerPC support? </s>
<s> I like the idea just because I knew as soon as I saw the Leopard requirements that my G4 is on its last major OS upgrade. </s>
<s> With Intel-only support, the next iteration of the OS will work even better on the x86 architecture. </s>
<s> The only downside to this addresses the G5 users... </s>
<s> Both those Dual and Quad Power Macs were extremely powerful, and are still useful for the most part. </s>
<s> They still fetch large prices when someone is selling them too. </s>
<s> Most of the newer Intel Macs can outperform them, but some people still rely on them. </s>
<s> They may see that Apple is trying to force them to buy a new Mac, but they should also know that this was coming ever since the transition was announced. </s>
<s> -BMF </s>
<s> But more a statement of fact. </s>
<s> and that's how I called it. </s>
<s> My Mac is very important and I do a lot of work on it. </s>
<s> And it's definitely worthwhile... *Loads DVD and plugs in headphones. </s>
<s> * Lately I've had a bunch of video work to work on, and only my MacBook Pro can handle it; the G4 can't support iMovie '08. </s>
<s> Once I get some more creative software, and after WWDC, more hardware perhaps, it'll be even easier, and I can get some websites up and running too. </s>
<s> Hopefully we'll see some Mac updates tomorrow. </s>
<s> I've been eyeing a Mac Mini for a little while, but without a decent graphics chip, provided they don't just throw in a real card, and yesterday's processors, it's a no go. </s>
<s> They're a bit overpriced too, and to get a decent, upgraded model, you could just buy an iMac and have everything you need out-of-the-box. </s>
<s> I hope Steve has some good surprises tomorrow. </s>
