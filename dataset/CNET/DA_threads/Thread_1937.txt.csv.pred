1.1.1	Hi, I just bought an External DVD Burner, Plextor PX-716UF I think it's an external version of the PX-716A.	St
1.1.2	But I didn't read properly before I bought it and it seems this drive doesn't burn on '-R' DL DVDs only the '+R' DL disks.	St
1.1.3	I'm thinking of returning it because it is my understanding that '-R' even a '-R DL' disk is more friendly with commercial DVD players... Like if I burn something on a DL Disk I want to make sure it will work at home not just on my computer.	St
1.1.4	Is this correct?	St
1.1.5	If so can anyone suggest a burner I can buy when/if I return the Plextor PX-716UF?	Ques
1.1.6	Maybe a better burner with more capabilities?	St
1.1.7	Thanks in Advance!	St
1.1.8	ohh, I have a Macintish computer so whatever burner I get has to be Mac compatible.	St
1.2.1	http://www.plextor.com/english/support/downloads/firm_716.htm writes: &quot;#Date posted: June 15, 2005 # Improved the write performance on DVD-R Dual Layer Media.&quot; Would I win a bet your firmware is out of date?	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Let me tell you Plextor has been no help...	St
1.3.2	I did actually update the firmware.	St
1.3.3	But here's the funny part, In some places on Plextor's website is says it does support DVD-R DL and in other places it says it does not support it.	St
1.3.4	I updated my firmware because thed update says it will burn DVD-R DL but then I emailed Plextor about it and the response I got was that the Drive does not do '-R DL' But you're right the Updated firmware says it does, only probelm is Plextor still says they don't.	St
1.3.5	They need to make up their mind about this.	St
1.3.6	I want to test it out myself but I can't seem to find DVD-R DL disks anywhere.	St
1.3.7	I think I'll have to order them online or something.	St
1.4.1	I'm been pummeled for adding a feature in some devices and causing web and printed content to go out of sync.	St
1.4.2	Just asking, why must you have DL DVD-R?	St
1.4.3	It seems odd since you can't find the media.	St
1.4.4	I did see DL DVD+R out there and my friend says it played fine on his players.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Downsizing...lol The reason I was looking for -R was that, it's my understanding that -R Media is more compatible with stand alone DVD players and such.	St
1.5.2	So I want to try what I can to make sure if I burn any videos they will play in most DVD players.	St
1.5.3	and I always thought +R worked, but -R worked better.	St
1.5.4	Is that wrong?	St
1.6.1	The issue here is that it all depends on the list of players you have to play with.	St
1.6.2	At first I found -R to play widely.	St
1.6.3	Now the list is reversed with more +R than -R. Here's why I know.	St
1.6.4	I have to keep a list of what type to send to who for demos.	St
1.6.5	Cheers, Bob	Polite
1.7.1	Just go to Newegg.com and order the NEC.	St
1.7.2	Always sells for $40-$47 including shipping.	St
1.7.3	It burns all media except DVD-ram, and is rated close to 100% in customer reviews.	St
1.7.4	It burns at speeds up to 16x.	St
