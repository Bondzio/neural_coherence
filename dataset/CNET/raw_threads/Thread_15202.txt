My 2006 HP pavillion a1510n (WINMCE 2005) has currently 1 gb of &quot;Dual channel memory architecture 4 x 184-pin DDR DIMM sockets support unbuffered non-ECC 400/333 MHZ DDR memory modules.&quot; My friends RAM he is giving me is Kingston DDR KVR 400/512R. There is an &quot;ASME1680613&quot; written on the stick. Model # of 740617076349. They are both 184 pin. he is giving me two of them (2 512's for a total of 1 gb)... though not specifically listed as being &quot;dual channel&quot; yet he purchased the two at the same time, just not in the same package. Would that suffice as dual channel? HP said that single sticks will work, just not as fast. Any thoughts? Thanks Wayne

It will be fine. http://www3.shopping.com/xPO-Kingston-Technologies-512MB-DDR-SDRAM-Desktop-Memory-KVR400-512R I wonder where people are getting the idea of dual channel memory? When dual channel came out no one wrote that. We just needed PAIRS. I guess the marketing got busy. Go figure. Bob
