1.1.1	Hi All !	St
1.1.2	I recently had my wireless network go down and have n't been able to get it back up in several days , so I 'm hoping someone might have some suggestions here .	St
1.1.3	Two things happened around the time the problem seemed to occur : 1 ) Downloaded and installed an audioscrobbler plugin for foobar2000 .	St
1.1.4	The network went down very shortly after the first successful scrobble .	St
1.1.5	This might be coincidence .	Res
1.1.6	2 ) Several Windows updates were applied .	St
1.1.7	My setup is : Cable Service Provider & gt ; Cable Modem & gt ; Linksys Wireless-B Broadband Router ( BEFW11S4 ) One Windows XP Home machine is connected via ethernet cable .	St
1.1.8	Two Windows XP Home machines are connected via Linksys Wireless USB Network Adapter ( WUSB11 ) .	St
1.1.9	The WUSB11 NICs seemed to be working OK , as I can see other local wireless networks ( five of them ) .	St
1.1.10	I can also connect to my neighbours network and access the internet via that .	St
1.1.11	Wired connection also works fine .	St
1.1.12	The router IS broadcasting our custom SSID , has DHCP enabled ( I was previously using static IP addresses with no problems ) , currently has security disabled ( WEP is all that it supports and we were using that before with no problems ) and I 'm NOT using MAC filters ( again , I was using this before and had no problems ) .	St
1.1.13	All other setting are at the defaults .	St
1.1.14	The router has the latest firmware and both wirelessly connected machines have the latest drivers for the NIC .	St
1.1.15	When the wireless went down , both wirelessly connected machines lost internet , so it 's difficult to pin down to one particular machine - I 'm assuming it was my machine due to the two things mentioned above that happened at about the right time .	St
1.1.16	I 've since uninstalled foobar2000 and the audioscrobbler plugin and the last few Windows updates , but this made no difference .	St
1.1.17	Running 'ipconfig /all ' previously resulted in a 'media disconnected ' message in relation to the wireless NIC .	St
1.1.18	I applied the 'DisableDHCPMediaSense ' registry fix mentioned in a Microsoft knowledge base article , and now 'ipconfig /all ' results in : Windows IP Configuration Host Name .	St

1.1.144	: 255.255.255.255 These IP addresses certainly do n't match those I used when configuring the machines with static IP addresses .	St
1.1.145	The router has been reset twice in the last few days , I 've tried the WinsockXPFix download , and spent several days googling similar problems with no success .	St
1.1.146	I 'm completely out of ideas on how to fix this situation , and also puzzled as to why this would affect two computers if the problem is only with one of them .	St
1.1.147	I 've tried to provide as much info as I can , but I 'm not terribly knowledgable about networking stuff , so if you need more info please ask	St
1.2.1	Bumping this because I 'm still stuck	St
1.3.1	The reason I asked is my dad 's BEFW11S4 died so I sent him mine .	St
1.3.2	That was over 3 years ago .	St
1.3.3	Since then I visited and we went to the office store to get another router .	St
1.3.4	He told me he gifted out the two BEFW11S4 's and given the age , maybe it 's time for a new router .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	Hi Bob , The router is definitely getting on a bit now - maybe 6 or 7 years old .	St
1.4.2	I can still access it from the wired PC and it seems to be working OK for the most part .	St
1.4.3	I realise I probably need to upgrade now anyway - I was just hoping to get maybe another year out of it ...	St
1.4.4	I 'm thinking that the fact that there are so many other networks in the neighbourhood is a strong contender for the problem .	St
1.4.5	I see lot of WPA and WPA2 networks floating around , which means their gear is a lot newer than ours and therefore ( ? )	Ques
1.4.6	probably stronger signal ...	St
1.4.7	It just seems a weird coincidence that everything went pear-shaped at around the time of the two items mentioned in my first post happened ...	St
1.5.1	The old router stopped doing wifi so he went hardline .	St
1.5.2	Later that failed and he was lucky mine still worked which saved him from learning a new router setup .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Sounds like it 's time to retire the hardware then ... Just wanted to make sure I was n't missing anything obvious before I did , but the more I look into it and cross potential problems off the list , the more I realise I 'm probably trying to save something not really worth saving ...	St
1.6.2	Thanks for the replies	St
