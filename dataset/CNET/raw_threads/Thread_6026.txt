But it doesn't work all the time. Sometimes it's fine, and sometimes there's no signal at all. (But even if I get no reception in my apartment, I know the transmitter is on because if I take my laptop down the hall, it picks up the neighbor's signal loud and clear.) Is there a stronger *receiving* antenna that I can install in my apartment so I can always pick up the neighbor's signal? All the repeaters and extenders I see advertised seem to apply to the sender's location. What, if anything, can I do as the receiver?

Also, you can construct a parabolic reflector from kitchen materials (I've done this at a party and at first they thought I was nuts, but afterwards they certified me... as what I was never quite sure) The dragonfly at http://www.usbwifi.orcon.net.nz/dragnfly.jpg is some trick.
