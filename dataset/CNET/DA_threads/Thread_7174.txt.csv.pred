1.1.1	I have just installed a 400 GHD to be used strictly for backup .	St
1.1.2	My computer sees the HD , but when I try to utilize it for a backup , I kept getting the message , & quot ; unreadable & quot ; .	St
1.1.3	I went ahead and formatted it , ( NTFS ) and tried again .	St
1.1.4	It will try to do the backup and then stops with a message that backup failed .	Sug
1.1.5	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks , Bill	St
1.2.1	You might want to supply this information .	St
1.2.2	As well , you could test the ability to access the drive by manually copying some of your data from your primary drive to the new one .	St
1.3.1	Steve , thanks so much .	Polite
1.3.2	I thought that I would & quot ; play & quot ; with the backup , ( WIN ) this morning and everything worked like a charm .	St
1.3.3	Again , thanks , Bill	Polite
