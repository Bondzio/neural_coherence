premise 1: correct - my laptop has native 1680x1050 resolution.
premise 2: also correct - the laptop is set to display *only* on the acer - totally blank screen on the laptop's display.
premise 3: also correct - windows res is set to 1680x1050 @60 hz, external display res also set to those numbers.
premise 4: correct.
acer is hooked up directly to laptop's vga port.
no intermediary devices.
and yes, i'm still losing about 1/8 of the screen (i.e.
what should be displayed) on the acer.
other steps i have taken: 1) used the acer's &quot;auto&quot; function to sync with laptop.
result: still missing 1/8 of the screen.
2) installed and updated monitor management software (acer desktop management) that came with the acer.
i did not do this initially because i wanted to the use the monitor as a simple plug-n-play.
result: still missing 1/8 of the screen.
3) manually adjusted the horizontal position of the screen so that it is as far to the right on the display as possible.
result: gains a small portion of the &quot;missing&quot; part of the screen, but still missing a significant part.
hope this gives you a better idea of what's going on.
i'll post a photo, if that would help...
