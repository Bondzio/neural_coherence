Well, I share the wireless connect with 2 computers which are not networked at all, they just communitate to the router directly.
They don't get used hardly ever at the same time and I print wirelessly to a print server so I am guessing that the printer would not be affected if I change to G. Thanks for the advice I guess I won't bother buying G then.
