After connecting the drive to the case, setting it to Master and plugging it into my USB2.0 port, Windows reports a USB Mass Storage Device, Disk Drive, and finally a WD313000 Caviar USB Device, which is displayed under &quot;Disk Drives&quot; in Device Manager. Everything seems great but... there is no drive in &quot;My Computer&quot; to access it by. After searching the problem I discovered there was also no entry in the Disk Manager (Computer Management). The only place it shows up is Device Manager. I have tried reinstalling the driver, unplugging the power source and/or USB cable and plugging them back in, rebooting, refreshing drive views, unplugging all IDE cables and plugging them back in... The drive spins up and even shows activity occasionally, but there is virtually no way to access it. I have searched this problem to the death for over 3 hours. If someone has some idea what to do short of buying another HD, please help! Regards, -- Snib

There was a disk manager but be sure you are in the right place as noted at http://www.theeldergeek.com/hard_drives.htm If the drive doesn't show up, then recheck your motherboard drivers and more things USB at http://www.usbman.com DON'T USE the front panel USB connections or try a few of them.

Any other ideas out there...?
