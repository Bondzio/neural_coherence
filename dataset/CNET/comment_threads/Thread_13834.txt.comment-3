Sorry, I led to a misunderstanding.
I was referring to the USB harddisk by &quot;device&quot;.
So, there is only a HDD with it's cable.
I couldn't find the cable but here is the description fron it's specs: Cable(s) Included 1 USB cable External Cables included qty 1 Cables form factor External Cables type USB cable I tried the HDD with many new desktops, that i am sure they have USB 2.0 ports.
XP keeps saying I'd better plug into another port..
Here is the link to the manufacturer's web page: http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=497&subcategory=514&product=11172 (as a matter of fact, Noon Technology Co., Ltd., China is manufacturing the IDE-to-USB and the case) Thanks
