I am looking at getting an AMD 64 and a new motherboard but I want to get the fastest that a new motherboard can handle. Does anyone know what speed that is?

A little less expensive: AMD Athlon 64 (90nm Socket 939) 3500 (2.2 GHz) aprx $329 Retail, needs a Heatsink-fan, aprx $63 for a Thermalright XP-120 w/Vantex Stealth 120m. If you are going Pent 4, then a Intel P4, 560 (3.6GHz) LGA 775 socket, aprx $449 Retail, comes with good Heatsink-fan. For Intel setup motherboard for good gaming the ASUS P5AD2 Deluxe aprx $197 Retail. It has the i925x Northbridge and ICH6R Southbridge. For AMD setup motherboard for good gaming the ASUS A8N - SLI, aprx $188. Has the NVidia nForce line of chipset for dual video cards, but only needs one GeForce 6800GT card for single to start out, then add another if later required for the future.
