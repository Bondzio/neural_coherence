&quot;Includes portable ATSC digital terrestrial antenna for use up to 10 miles from an ATSC transmitter&quot; Since OTA Standard Def TV is going to be dead soon, look at something like this Hauppauge unit at http://reviews.cnet.com/tv-tuner-adapters/hauppauge-wintv-hvr-950/4505-9332_7-32135209.html and others from both makers.
Some may have you install something called an IR BLASTER to control the cable box.
