But keep in mind the GATEWAY specs shows your system has 300W PSU http://support.gateway.com/s/PC/R/3724/4367cl2.shtml System requirements for the video card you installed specifies 350W PSU http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=338367&Pn=GeForce_7300_GS_Video_Card Best to start with info, specifically the part number, off the PSU. It will help you determine what physical size the PSU is. VAPCMD

Many many options...here's one with the exact same dimensions and it's a 550W PSU ... and I found it online at another site for $82.00 plus shipping. In PSUs... higher wattage PSUs for now and later are preferable to the minimum PSUs provided by many mfgs. http://www.power-on.com/ea550.html Again this is but one of many many PSUs that will work in your PC. Feel free to look around. You've just got to get a PSU with the same dimensions and more than 350W...I'd go at least 400/450 for now and perhaps higher for future systems, on/off switch on the PSU is preferred. VAPCMD
