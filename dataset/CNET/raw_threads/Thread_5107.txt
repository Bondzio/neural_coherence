When you repeatedly pull the power cord or cut the computer off manually by holding in the power button, do you risk the loss of hardware due to corruption - how about the operating system? I have been told there is no risk of doing this repeatedly over years, and would like to know what happens to hardware/software. Thanks. finmjr10

As to losing the files, filesystem or the OS the good news is that the newer filesystems are more resistant to damage but not damage proof. There is little evidence you can break the machine by removing power but if you want to try to corrupt hard disk contents it is possible. -&gt; The lesson? We only lose what we didn't backup. Bob

Sometimes a system can become unresponsive and attempts to shut down properly just don't work. You've little choice when this happens. You don't want to be doing this regularly. As for hardware damage, what I was taught was to avoid rapid off-on and on-off cycles. Today's power supplies may be better than some of yesterdays but they still like to sequence on and off in a controlled fashion. If you need to pull the plug to shut down your machine, wait several seconds before applying power again. This gives circuits time to bleed off stored current before being hit again. Long ago, I was taught to count to at least 10. That's not a hard and fast rule, however.

Thus, you're at risk every time its done. Refrain from such practices will allow for continued operation of the system. However, there are times when no other method seems to be left and you have to pull cord or hit/hold power button. Correct the problem and be happy. tada -----Willy
