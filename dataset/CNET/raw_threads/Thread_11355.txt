The main uses for the computer will be personal picture and video editing; music; internet; and general microsoft apps (word, excel, etc.) The main reasons for getting a new computer are storage space (I currently have an 80 gig hard drive and a 40 gig hard drive); memory (I currently have 512 MB of RAM); and Processor Speed (Current is 1.8 GHZ Pentium Processor). My current computer does not seem to handle multi-layered video editing very well and it is beginning to freeze up on some other programs (such as Madden 2004). I am unwilling/unable to build my own box. However, it seems that the AMD processor is the way to go (thus eliminating another Dell). What setup would you recommend assuming a price range of $1,500-$2,000. I am not interested in high end gaming, but I want my computer to last for at least as long as the last one (i.e. upgradeable).

Is any of this needed? Windows XP Thermal Compound as a substitute for the retail processor's in the box, or (if oem -&gt;Then DEFINITELY NEEDED) Motherboard Processor-Suggest AMD X2 3800+-$325 Memory-1GB DDR PC3200 Ram Hard Drive-250gb sata Optical Drives-DVD Burner Graphics Card-7800gt Sound Card if desired, and takes off load from cpu Case Psu Extra Cooling Fans if desired

I will need all of the parts for the new one as my wife will continue to use our current computer as is. I am looking for a suggestion of a computer I can buy that will include the AMD processors.

You can customize your home desktop to your liking. Click the link below as you can start. I suggest getting the AMD Athlon X2 4400+ process, but it might be a little overkill for you. You don't need such items as a graphics card, but pay attention to details such as mice and keyboard. I suggest you get the Logitech keyboard Velocity Micro offers, but again it is all up to you. http://velocitymicro.com/wizard.php?iid=34
