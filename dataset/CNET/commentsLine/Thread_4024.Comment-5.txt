thanks for the reply.. i guess it is just as well then that i am not shelling out big bucks for a graphics card.. the x1600 is only about $135 cad.
and since i don't expect vista to be stable for another year, i probably won't be migrating before then, so i still think the x1600 will do for a while.
thanks, pl
