Don't know where to plug it back in. Is it on the motherboard? Does it mate with another plug? On the power supply? There's only enough wire length to reach about 1/3 of the way into the box, but I have only found places with not enough pins. Can someone describe right where it connects?

Ususally at the front side of the case, at or near the bottom of the board. Mine has a double row of small pins for various things to plug in. The power switch, hdd led, case speaker, etc. It should be printed on the board &quot;pwr&quot; or something similar. If you have the manual that came with the computer, there should be a diagram of the motherboard with this information in it. Good Luck.

It was too hard to see and reach. With two long probes I painstakingly maneuvered the end down to the plug and somehow pushed it in. The box even started up after I put it back together.
