<s> We have a DSL connection with a Linksys 'b' wireless router in my sons room. </s>
<s> Our apartment is long with a great deal of distance from his end of the apartment to the other. </s>
<s> My office area is maybe 60 or 70 feet from the router and the wirelss connection on my laptop doesn't work when at my desk in the office and I have to use dial up. </s>
<s> I can use my laptop to connect wirelessly when I am nearer to the router. </s>
<s> We are working with Windows XP. </s>
<s> What can I do to get a strong signal in my office area? </s>
<s> Do I get another router to put in the middle of the range? </s>
<s> Do I use an access point (which is something I am unfamiliar with)? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> 1) get a pair of those extender antenna Linksys markets 2) move the router to a more centralized location (requires running cable) 3) add an access point 4) go to a MIMO router and adapters </s>
<s> Since you only need to point the signal in that direction, head to the kitchen and whip up this antenna reflector. </s>
