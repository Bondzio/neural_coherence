I found a site that suggests I need do three things (all of which seem simple to me).
1.
Connect new router as local device or bridge - If connecting the second router via Ethernet cable, plug it into one of the LAN ports on the first router (this is easy).
2.
Check / change IP address of the new router not to conflict and to be in the range served by the old one (ditto -- I already manually manage IP addresses on my net) 3.
Disable DHCP (also simple, and I assume I disable it on the new router that is acting as a bridge).
That's all it says -- is there anything else I need to know?
(I'm guessing the new router should have it's own SSID so I can select it via the N devices).
