Since I've bought it, I noticed that the temperatures were always high, a popular issue with owners of this laptop. I was looking up ways to keep it cooled, then I noticed a vent under the cpu. This is labelled as a vent on my manual, for keeping the laptop cooled. The only problem is, it's blocked. There are no holes. I don't understand why they would do this, as it causes overheating. I want to know why the vents are blocked.
