&quot;Hi, Thanks for your response.
Finally this kind of MB does not have the option of USB/FireWire in the BIOS.
Means the BIOS cannot detect the DVD burner from the FireWire port.&quot; There is no question here.
As to your first post, almost NO PCs made will do this.
It's not a feature of most PCs so nothing busted.
Did you need a history lesson on the Personal Computer?
