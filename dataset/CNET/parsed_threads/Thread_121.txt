<s> When I push the power button fans barely move and then nothing. </s>
<s> I have tested the power supply with volt meter and all have proper voltage. </s>
<s> I even changed out power supply with a spare same problem. </s>
<s> I then started disconecting power plugs and found the four pin 12 volt plug on the mother board is the problem. </s>
<s> With the 4 pin plug disconected the computer will try to power up. </s>
<s> I am then thinking mother board or processor. </s>
<s> I took the processor out and computer now trys to power up with the 4 pin connected. </s>
<s> I ordered a used processor on Ebay put it in and the same problem. </s>
<s> The computer is 5 years old and I don't want to spend the money on a mother board if I am off base. </s>
<s> Any advice would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> It's a common issue with that old a PC. </s>

<s> Often enough as Robert mentioned, &quot;bad caps&quot; are a problem especially with these smaller form PCs. </s>
<s> That also includes the PSU itself. </s>
<s> I have reseated several times the connections and that helps if not a bad cap problem as the cabling can be pinched at odd places,e tc.. </s>
<s> If a bad cable, replace until found. </s>
<s> If you do in fact find a bad cap or mtrbd. </s>
<s> itself, you should consider moving away from it, only a mtrbd. </s>
<s> replacement works(fixed) because of old age, etc.. Ebay for a working replacement mtrbd. </s>
<s> if so inlcined. </s>
