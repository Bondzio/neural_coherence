I just bought 1G (2x512 MB) of Corsair TWINX PC-3200 DDR RAM and installed it successfully after I removed my old RAM and set the settings in my BIOS manually to CAS 2-3-3-6. I want to be able to use my old RAM (512 MB (2x256) of OCZ PC-3200 DDR RAM) in my computer at the same time, but every time I install it, my computer gets past the BIOS diagnostics, but just won't load into windows. I have an ABIT IS7 mother board which is compatible with both types of RAM, it just seems like my CAS settings are not good enough for my OCZ RAM. I just learned what CAS settings are today, after having a really hard time getting my new RAM installed BTW, so I'm totaly new at this. On the OCZ website the CAS settings are 2-3-3-7. I tried changing my BIOS to those settings with just my Corsair RAM installed, to see if it would load windows, and it does. But as soon as I add my OCZ RAM back in, Windows won't load anymore. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what my CAS settings should be to work for both types of RAM? I'm so new at this and I really don't want my OCZ RAM to go to waste. Thanks in advance!
