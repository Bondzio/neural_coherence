<s> I have a blueant X5 A2DP headset and have been using it with my laptop for past 1 year. </s>
<s> One day all of a sudden it got a weird problem. </s>
<s> The headset connects to system and when i play any audio i just get a hissing sound in the headset. </s>
<s> Also the sound doesn't play in the laptop speaker. </s>
<s> I can change the track or pause n resume the playback using the headset's AVRCP features. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> There is no problem in the headset because the same headset is working normally with my cell phone. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I updated bluetooth driver on laptop still problem persists. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I'm able to use bluetooth for file transfer on my cell etc. </s>
<s> System info: Lenovo R61. </s>
<s> Model no: 8919 A44 OS : Windows XP I had some hardware issues with my laptop. </s>
<s> My System Fan had conked off and probably because of that my Motherboard also got damaged. </s>
<s> I've got the motherboard and Fan replaced recently. </s>
<s> Please let me know what can be the issue or if any more information is required. </s>
<s> Sorry but bluetooth audio was not a XP feature. </s>
<s> A2DP even more so. </s>
<s> I was surprised at Windows 7 arriving without A2DP support here. </s>
<s> You can google up how others dealt with this but it's not native and A2DP is double trouble. </s>
<s> I'd drop it. </s>
