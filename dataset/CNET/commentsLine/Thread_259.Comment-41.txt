chris: my concern is the ability to make an actual copy of my hard drive, like one would make if i were using pc relocator or a similar product.
i want to make a complete backup, hopefully without the corrupt file that is causing the problem.
my plan is to make that copy onto an external drive.
can i do that by installing windows on an external drive, use pc relocator to copy my hard drive to the external drive, format the old drive, reinstall windows and then reverse the process by using pc relocator from the external drive to my computer???
thanks, ann
