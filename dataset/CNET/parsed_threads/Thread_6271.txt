<s> According to this article ( http://blog.laptopmag.com/asus-mb168b-portable-monitor ), the 1080p MB168B+ monitor is supposed to be released during August, but I can't find much information about it online. </s>
<s> Has anyone heard anything? </s>
<s> Sales seem to be nowhere and blogs and makers try and try again. </s>
<s> Seems like a niche product since no one reports they can play video on such things. </s>
<s> Maybe with USB 3.0 that will finally let you watch a movie but if you have seem the average notebook tank on performance my bet is that folk will again go back to HDMI. </s>
<s> Besides, without HDCP, your average BluRay title will not play on this. </s>

<s> I'm really interested in something like this for work. </s>
<s> I would use it mostly for Excel, Word, PDF viewing/editing, etc. </s>
<s> I would just prefer a monitor with a resolution higher than 1366 x 768 like the 16&quot; AOC monitor out there. </s>
<s> The other downside is the cost. </s>
<s> Being a niche product you pay a premium. </s>
<s> If you just want a second display, a common monitor is the cheap fix. </s>
<s> Almost all laptops will do a dual display. </s>
<s> The wallet is usually the decider here. </s>
<s> For me, I'd give USB 3.0 displays a wide berth since drivers are still iffy. </s>
<s> You don't want to know the stories. </s>

<s> Sorry, I wasn't very clear. </s>
<s> I travel frequently for work, and I do the bulk of my work at client locations and in hotel rooms. </s>
<s> So I need a monitor that's travel friendly. </s>
<s> I'm having trouble finding non-USB monitors that are very travel friendly and have a higher resolution. </s>
<s> Do you have any suggestions for a good travel monitor that is approx 16 inches and isn't just a USB-connected monitor? </s>
<s> http://www.maxivista.com/how-to-use-laptop-as-monitor.htm for example. </s>
<s> But given your story, why not go for it and be clear about your return options? </s>
<s> I didn't want to name names but the usual 4 letter makers has had some issues with USB 3.0 Bob </s>
