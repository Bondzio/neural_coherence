i have the same fx5500 video card, and i like it.
(i'm not a gamer.)
in general, it's not that one shouln't get an agp card for an older system.
it's that investing so much (about $300 for the 7800gs) on an agp video card is not advisable.
if you get a new system, which gamers tend to do more frequently than gereral purpose users, then you can't transfer your $300 investment to the new computer's pci-express x16 slot.
imo, a big waste of money.
