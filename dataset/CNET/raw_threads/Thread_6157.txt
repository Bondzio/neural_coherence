It's like a 5 year old computer and I just upgraded to Windows 7 but here are my questions: -Largest Hard Drive (Hard Drive Size Not that Important, more Important is RPMs) -How Much RAM Can I put in this (I want 6 Gigs or More) -What Kind of Dedicated Graphics Card -Upgrade Processor Let me know. My I'm a web developer &amp; my website is Current Century Media if I can't upgrade this system much I'll just continue to use it for Microsoft Office/Notepad Editors/XAMMP I also plan on buying a Lenovo IdeaPad U410 from the Windows Store... is this a good buy or not. I want to start working with Illustrator &amp; In-Design. Thanks, Ted Cacciola Current Century Media

Also, there appear to be some prior discussions on upgrading various Dells. But without a specific model, no one can be specific. As to RAM, use crucial.com. Bob

Then find any upgrades that Dell provides, but you needn't buy from them, buy similar from other vendors. However, IMHO, you should chuck this PC if you really want this for some business as it already too dated and any upgrades won't really make it a swift or real dependable PC, it has to work real hard to keep up and/or become stressed. Check your local Craigslist and find out what that PC is going for and then check what others are selling that maybe more upgradeable and/or simply better to begin with. In other words put you possible upgrade funds to better use on a newer PC. tada -----Willy
