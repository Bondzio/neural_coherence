This may a well beaten subject, but I must get an answer.
I have used an Iomega External HD (black series/800/firewire) for about 6 months, using it to load up with important files.
Now all of a sudden, it does get recognized by either my Mac G5 (OS X 10.4) or my MacBook Pro.
In fact, I get the Disk Insertion (initialize/ignore/eject) window.
Why initialize, that will only wipe out all of my files on the HD.
Why ignore, that wont help.
Why eject, thats no use.
Please help, any advice?
Frustrated, now angry.
