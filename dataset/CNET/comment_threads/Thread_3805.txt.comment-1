I have been using the free Retrospect Express HD utility that cam with one of my external HDs.
The program has grown increasingly undependable and buggy.
Do you recommend another (totally free, not 30 day demo) data backup utility?
I use it for backing up data from/to external and internal HDs Thanks!
