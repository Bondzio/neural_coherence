1.1.1	So I have finally decided to build my first desktop from scratch .	St
1.1.2	As this is my first time , I am looking for some advice about the parts that I 've chosen , and if there is anything that I have overlooked that could cause problems for my build .	St
1.1.3	My budget is $ 2200 ( before rebates ) , but that budget is somewhat flexible , and if any recommendations could be made to lower the cost of my build without sacrificing too much quality that would be great .	St
1.1.4	Here are the parts I 've picked so far for my tentative build .	St

St
1.1.6	I do need to have a mid-tower case because most full towers will not fit in the space that I have available .	St
1.1.7	Other than that , I do n't have any preferences in particular , although I do ask that you people 's suggestions stick to the basic format that I have laid out unless there is a good reason to do so .	St
1.1.8	Also if anyone can recommend a good inexpensive UPS for my system that would be great .	Ques
1.1.9	Thank you all for your input .	St
1.1.10	oh I almost forgot .	St
1.1.11	Are there any other miscellaneous parts or wires that I am going to need to purchase to build the computer or is pretty much everything covered .	St
1.1.12	I 'm kind of clueless here .	St
1.2.1	before the P58 chipset MBs get USB 3.0 and the higher speed SATA before buying .	St
1.2.2	Some of the Socket 1156 MBs with the P55A chipset are already available with the higher speed USB and SATA ports ... Giga-Byte has some of the P55A MBs on the market now .	St
1.2.3	And remember ... build and test the system outside the case to ensure the components work before installing in the case .	St
1.2.4	VAPCMD	St
