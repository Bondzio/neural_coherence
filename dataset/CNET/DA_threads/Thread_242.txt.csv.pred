1.1.3	i was looking at the maxtor's but was wondering if there was a better solution or where i could get a could deal on a hardrive would be.	St
1.2.1	note that memory and hard drive space relate when you talk about page file size.	St
1.2.2	But that's another topic.	St
1.2.3	Max out the RAM and go for the external drive, you need a backup source off the machine.	St
1.3.1	Well, external hardrive it's a perfect solution for storage and backup.	St
1.3.2	So, if you purchase new HDD, you could remove your music, video, pictures from internal (you'll be able to bring along this external HDD, you'll have access to this data out of home) My opinion: initially purchase HDD, after that you could test your PC and make your mind of upgrade memory.
