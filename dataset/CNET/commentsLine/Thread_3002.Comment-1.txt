i recently upgraded to a new computer and got a seagate 120gb sata hard drive with it.
i have a dvd-rom and a cdrw also.
but me being me i hate getting the computer with all the different crap on the hard drive so i reformatted and reinstalled winxp pro.
i know you have to go into device manager under ide ata/atapi controllers and make sure you have &quot;dma mode if available&quot; selected.
well i am pretty sure my dvd-rom and cdrw are configured to ultra dma mode 2 on my primary ide channel.
that would leave my hard drive under the secondary ide channel configured as ultra dma mode 5. here is why i ask: #1) i really do not know how the computers hard drive was configured originally because i reformatted and reinstalled the os.
#2) when i run sisoft sandra pro 2004 it continually tells that my hard drive is underachieving.
it says it should be set to ultra dma mode 6.
#3) when i get my hard disk check results at pcpitstop.com i get unusually low percentage results (%43) in either cached or uncached speed (cant remember).
i have a dfi i875prob motherboard and have the latest bios installed.
the bios is setup to use ich5 raid type.
not highpoint raid because i only have a single hard drive.
plus when i install and configure for highpoint raid the computer boots completely different (meaning extra boot screens for the highpoint raid controller) from when i originally got the machine.
any help is appreciated as i am totally in the dark on this problem if it is a problem??
?
