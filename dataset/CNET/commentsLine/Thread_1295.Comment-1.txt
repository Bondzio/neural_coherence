hi, i have a 4 year old dell dimension 4550 pc desktop.
the pc came with 256mg ram, and i added 512mg ram to it 3 years ago.
i don't want to toss this pc, but it's running a tad sluggish.
would increasing the current 768mg ram to 1gb ram (max it can take=1gb ram) would make an appreciable difference?
the cost would be about $75 (if i bought through dell).
$ is not the issue, but i also don't want to waste my time if consensus says &quot;the pc is too old for the additional ram to make a difference.&quot; i use the pc for web-browsing, email, ms office, and the kids sometimes play not-so-intense web-based games.
thanks.
