To configuring the router to make it work since most &quot;work&quot; laptops need a domain to log into.
You can't fake that with a router.
The forum policies are very clear about help to thwart some business or IT's control.
You may feel it's ok to discuss such but the forum policies forbid it.
Sorry and hopefully it will dawn on you why the router settings are not the cure.
I have found the beer solution to work on most IT staff.
