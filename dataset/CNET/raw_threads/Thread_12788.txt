I know a bit about PC's, however, being that I am a bonafied noobie I would some suggestions or slaps across the face with my decision. My motherboard is an Intel DG965WH Series and my chip is an Intel Core Duo 6300. My goal is to get this machine to run smoothly, as I am an avid MMO player and my machine at home is about to become my wifes. I guess my question comes down to, how do I pick out the right power supply so as to power my machine and get it to accept the specs I want, and are there any restrictions about the case I pick. My goal is to hook up a 320 GB hard drive ( most likely 7200 RPM Maxtor ) 2 GB of RaM ( PC4200 )and a PCI-E Nvidia graphics card ( 256mb or above ). Any help or general slaps in the face would be appreciated.

Gaming computers need good airflow to dissipate heat, so the really small cases aren't recommended. You could get away with a standard ATX mini-tower, but you probably will be happiest with the room provided by a standard ATX mid-tower case. Look at the system requirements for the particular make and model of video card that you intend to install in the computer. The general idea is to surpass the minimum PSU requirements listed for that video card. The manual for the motherboard states that it takes a standard ATX12V PSU. Get a 20+4pin PSU from a good manufacturer with a maximum Wattage rating that surpasses the video card's requirements. Also pay attention to what Amp rating the video card requires on the PSU's +12V rail. A high-end video card can require over 30A.

I've decided to go with the Mid-Tower AthenaTech with a 400W PSU. Will be adding a 120mm fan into front when it arrives then place all into it and either cry tears of joy or take cover when it blows up.
