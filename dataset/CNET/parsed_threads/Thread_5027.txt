<s> This was working fine. </s>
<s> But now I can't see the files on my laptop from my desktop. </s>
<s> When I try to display other PC's in my workgroup I get an error Mshome is not accessible. </s>
<s> You might not have permission to use this network resource. </s>
<s> Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available. </s>
<s> I recently installed Kaspersky anti-virus after Mcafee expired. </s>
<s> But I've turned off the Kaspersky firewall and am using Windows firewall. </s>
<s> There is says file sharing is allowed. </s>
<s> But anyway I tried turning off all firewalls on both laptop and desktop and problem persists. </s>
<s> I've been through network wizard several times on both machines and check file and printer sharing allowed. </s>
<s> Printer sharing still seems to work but not file sharing. </s>
<s> Looking for any suggestion before re-installing Windows from scratch. </s>
<s> Another member had a similar issue. </s>
<s> With their &quot;suite&quot; the firewall was off but still working to block file sharing. </s>
<s> They had to uninstall the suite to remove the block. </s>
<s> This is a common bug in suites. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You were exactly right. </s>
<s> I had to completely remove Kaspersky (POS) from both desktop and laptop and file shareing started working again. </s>
<s> Fortunately, Mcafee 2008 just became available, and I've installed it and file sharing still works. </s>
<s> So I'm good for a year until that sub expires. </s>
