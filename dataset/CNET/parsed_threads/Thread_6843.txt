<s> Can I put DDR2 1066 RAM into a motherboard that specifies &quot;1200 OC / 800&quot;? </s>
<s> Or does this just mean I should get 800 and I can overclock it up to 1200... or what? </s>
<s> I'm thinkin I can put the 1066's in there because one the reviewers says he did... </s>
<s> Sorry never built a computer before, still trying to figure this all out. </s>
<s> This is the motherboard http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188013 Thanks -Hendrik </s>

<s> You can put faster in but it won't use it. </s>
<s> Some get miffed about that. </s>
<s> Also be sure to not exceed the board's size limits per stick. </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your prompt responses, both were very helpful. </s>
<s> I was on the verge of buying a pair of g.skills that wernt listed on the evga supported-ram site &gt;:-| Probably woulda caused a major headache im not in need of. </s>
<s> At any rate, as I was saying, not new to computers but kinda new to buildin em from scratch. </s>
<s> So heres bout what I came up with in my attempt to build a high-end multi-purpose pc on a mid-range budget. </s>
<s> Please let me know your thoughts! </s>
<s> Thanks -Hendrik NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI ATX Intel Motherboard, Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600, COOLER MASTER Hyper TX2 CPU Cooler, G.SKILL 4GB (2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 (PC2 6400) PC Power & Cooling Silencer 750 Quad, EVGA 640-P2-N829-AR GeForce 8800GTS SSC 640MB (probably 2, sooner rather than later...), Western digital HD, LITE-ON 20X DVDR DVD Burner. </s>
<s> GSkill probably would have worked but when a MB has been out as long as the 680i has and that memory, GSkill, is not listed...best to stick with something listed as compatible. </s>
<s> GSKill is good RAM in fact I have 4GB of the PC1066 in a GigaByte MB. </s>
<s> Re the MB...I'd recommend looking for something with a newer chipset. </s>
<s> If I recall correctly at one time there were problems with the 680i and the Q6600. </s>
<s> Maybe the 780i Re the HDD...take a look at the WD6400AAKS...640GB Re the PCP PSU....you'll like that ! </s>

<s> the 680i line has been very problematic and has had data corruption issues. </s>
<s> this 750i would be a better choice if SLI is a must: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188026 the 8800gts/640mb has been obsolete since late last year. </s>
<s> http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3140&p=7 the 9600gt/512mb and the 8800gt/512mb are faster and cheaper ($130-$170). </s>
<s> the 9800gtx/512mb is dropping to $200 in the next few days. </s>
<s> and the radeon hd 4850 and hd 4870 are generally considered the best choices at $200 and $305. </s>
<s> http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3341&p=13 if you won't be using dual cards, then a p45 based mobo would be a better choice than the 750i. </s>
<s> if you want dual GPUs then drop in a 9800gx2. </s>
