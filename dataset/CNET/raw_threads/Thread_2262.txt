I have roadrunner cable modem on a desktop on the second floor of my home. I have a desktop in the basement of my home and wish to connect the one in the basement to the cable modem. I also have a laptop (which I don't wish to connect to the modem, but I would like to keep that option open). How should I do this at the most reasonable cost? Shoud I just get a wireless router and wireless cards? Or, should I hard wire the desktops and get a router with both wired/wireless conncctions?

These units will self configure, find each other, and you're off to the races. The desktop is wired to the router, and the laptop is wireless. You can get a wireless NIC for the desktop if you want.
