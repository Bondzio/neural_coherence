Hi, I just finished putting together my new system and the darn thing wont boot from the hard disk.
But that's not the only problem.
When I turn the computer on the system posts no problem.
Takes about 1-2 minutes to detect IDE devices sits for another 1-2 minutes then goes to the IRQ screen sits there for about a minute then won't boot from the hard drive(invalid system disk).
I can boot from the cd-rom and windows runs but once i try to reboot it still wont boot from Hard disk.
I've tried two harddrives two powersupplies two motherboards and am at a real loss for what to do.
