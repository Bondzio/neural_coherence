1.1.1	The PC was dropped while moving and has been able to detect the O/S since.	St
1.1.2	I replaced the hard drive already, but it still just pulls up the gateway logo and then black screen.	St
1.1.3	Is this a problem with the board or the CPU, or is it a simply a procedural problem with the boot sequence still trying to boot the O/S from an empty HD.	St
1.1.4	Thanks, Jim	St
1.2.1	to mention that I am trying to boot O/S from disk, it won't detect anything.	St
