Router and adapter are in the same room, about 6 feet apart.
Router has always worked previously, just using ethernet cable.
But I've never tried it wirelessly before.
SSID broadcast is enabled.
Router is a 2WIRE 2701HB-G.
If I understand you, you're saying that you don't expect the wireless adapter to work if my ethernet cable is also plugged in?
