1.1.1	Hello , I decided it would be a great idea to re-install my Win XP-Pro OS because it seemed to be having too many problems .	St
1.1.2	When I backed up the drivers , I must have missed a very important one .	St
1.1.3	Now I 've searched the net for this , but to no avail .	St
1.1.4	I 'm running XP , my dvd is a Matshita SR-8176 cd/dvd-rom ( working fine until I did this ) My error keeps saying that can not find ittimg3.dll ... I do n't have the disk for my dvd-rom ... please help ! !	St
1.1.5	!	St
1.2.1	Install an OS can easily outstrip one 's capabilities and too many will plunge into such and find themselves at a shop and out one hundred bucks ... That said and you 've already begun , there is likely a TYPOGRAPHIC error in that DLL name .	St
1.2.2	Either that or it 's just a WORM , VIRUS or other MALWARE and you do n't want it .	St
1.2.3	As to the missing DVD-ROM , this is not a matter of XP not supporting said device , but more likely some other glitch like we read at http : //support.microsoft.com/ ? id=314060 In no uncertain words , I would delete the noted registry keys and retest .	St
1.2.4	In no uncertain words , a new install of XP ( note no SP1 ) will likely find the user instantly having to deal with the MS-Blaster and Sasser WORMS the moment they connect to the internet even if they installed their antivirus .	St
1.2.5	This is why it 's better to seek help on the issues rather than reinstall .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you Bob .	St
1.3.2	Are you saying I will need to buy a new cd/dvd rom ?	Ques
1.4.1	Set the BIOS to boot from the XP CD .	St
1.4.2	If it boots , they it 's unlikely that it has a read issue .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
