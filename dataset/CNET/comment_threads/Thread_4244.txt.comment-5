Right, I was able to copy the data and create a new folder in my library on the new hard drive.
The old drive was moderately functional.
I just don't know what to do with the files to get my settings, documents and pics and music back to where it was.
The files I copied don't say my documents or my music...when I open them it's like reading a foreign language, that's the reason I was trying to paste them to my new drive (c) but it wouldn't allow me to do that because I didn't have permission to do so (still not understanding that one).
And I do appreciate your input in case I hadn't mentioned that before!
