1.1.1	I have read here that putting a non-working hard drive in a freezer will make it work again .	St
1.1.2	I am asking for the specifics on the max temperature the hard drive can sustain in a freezer and how to bag it properly .	St
1.1.3	I have 2 failed hard drives , a 250GB and a 10 GB , so , i am desperate to try a way to start these drives since a professinal data recovery and a new computer is out of the question due to the prices .	St
1.1.4	-DComander1	St
1.2.1	in something absorbent first , then put it in a freezer bag and place in the freezer for 12 hours .	St
1.2.2	If it spins-up , copy the files quickly before it fails .	St
1.3.1	This does n't make it work again .	St
1.3.2	Just might get it going long enough to copy the files out .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	The & quot ; freezer cure & quot ; is a carryover when HDs were in the Mb range .	St
1.4.2	Plus , it *may* allow the electronics & quot ; contract & quot ; if an open or burnt component , BUT this is only a temporary fix , not a real fix .	St
1.4.3	Thus , you need to get any data if that 's the sole purpose and do it quickly .	St
1.4.4	Understand , if it fails further , it maybe corrupt the data even more , so beware .	St
1.4.5	Even then it may not work at all , just be sure to double wrap the HD in plastic and allow at least a few minutes before use to climatize and then power-UP .	St
1.4.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	will the drive spin up and the read/write heads track .	St
1.5.2	As , if I remember correctly , the freezer trick was for bad sectors .	St
1.5.3	On drives that do not spin up I use an external enclosure .	St
1.5.4	This allows me hold the HDD in various position , shocking the drive with the power switch .	St
1.5.5	When and if the drive spins up I hold that position , cross my fingers and start copying files .	St
1.5.6	Luck Bill	St
1.6.1	I tried the freezer trick , does n't work , i have tried it over and over again , and it still does n't work .	St
1.6.2	i got a 10Gb hard drive from ebay and it worked for a few minutes before it started clicking and it failed .	St
1.6.3	i am mad that ebay would allow such people to rip you off of 10 dollars .	St
1.6.4	hmph , and i am buying yet another hard drive from ebay , this time a 500Gb for 11 dollars .	St
1.6.5	i hope this drive is not a waste of money.anyway , what shall i do to get my moneys worth out of that 10Gb hard drive ?	Ques
1.6.6	i would hate to see my money going to some one who rips people off regularlly of their hard earned cash .	St
1.7.1	Sorry to be the bearer of bad news .	St
1.8.1	Come on , a 500gb HD for $ 10 .	St
1.8.2	It reeks of a possible failure if only worth is $ 10 for parts .	St
1.8.3	To believe it 'll work for any length of time is less likely on its own .	St
1.8.4	Remember , if it sounds to good to be true , then its not .	St
1.8.5	However , you an play with parts all you want as you can be capable of some repairs , provide you treat this as a learning experience .	St
1.8.6	good luck tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.9.1	Ive heard it all now , freeze your hard drive to make it work .	St
1.9.2	any proof this works or is this just more fairytales from the noob section .	St
1.10.1	well after doing some research on the topic , I did find out that it can work for short periods of time .	St
1.10.2	as in a few min or an hour ect .	St
1.10.3	wich can be long enough to get the files you need off the hard drive .	St
1.10.4	but also begs the question , why ask that question here ? ? .	Ques
1.10.5	for me to find the info took all of 30seconds .	St
1.10.6	click on new tab - google - type in -- freezing your hard drive And wala I found a million sites that have tons of info about that topic .	St
1.11.1	A failing laptop drive .	St
1.11.2	They thought that spinrite could bring it back but the drive would n't stay good long enough to try it .	St
1.11.3	So the put the entire laptop in the garage that was just above freezing ( 40F or so ) .	St
1.11.4	That did the trick .	St
1.11.5	Remember we are dealing with abnormal hardware with issues .	St
1.11.6	All bets are off .	St
1.11.7	Bob	St
1.12.1	its not a permenant fix .	St
1.13.1	The files were saved and we got them onto a new hard disk .	St
1.13.2	Well unless you count that the new hard disk will fail in a few years ?	Ques
1.13.3	Bob	St
1.14.1	Not sure why , but occasionally it works .	St
1.14.2	Another trick that sometimes works for drives that do n't & quot ; spin up & quot ; is the & quot ; snap spin & quot ; trick to start the platters turning .	St
1.14.3	Understand , these are last resorts that usually do n't work , and that may damage the drive , but which are being used in situations in which you are ready to trash the drive anyway .	St
1.14.4	I would n't worry too much about wrapping the drive , you are only going to put it into the freezer for 1-2 hours .	St
1.14.5	Good luck , it sometimes does work , but do n't be surprised if it does n't .	St
1.15.1	If your hard drive has a physical error ( bearing that 's bad , rubber seal that 's preventing it from spinning up , etc ) , it might work .	St
1.15.2	In any case it wo n't hurt it as long as you make sure you do not get excessive condensation on the unit .	St
1.15.3	In my case , IBM Travelstar 18 GB that failed a few years ago , it did not work .	St
1.15.4	But it did allow the drive to spin up - which it did not do before freezing it .	St
1.15.5	Hard drive recovery is still pricey , and any & quot ; no-destructive & quot ; method that you can try at home really does not do any damage .	St
1.15.6	It might start up the drive , and as other already have posted , be ready to copy the files .	St
1.16.1	This is an article I have ad for a while on the subject : 200 ways to revive a hard drive We based one of our most popular pop quiz challenges on a situation every tech support person has faced or will face at least once : a failed hard drive .	St
1.16.2	In that particular case , a Compaq Prolinea 4/66 user was getting errors like & quot ; disk 0 error & quot ; and & quot ; invalid drive specification. & quot ; Here were the other facts in the case :	St
1.17.1	I have successfully revived 5 hard drives using the following technique .	St
1.17.2	I found that the problem was not the drive assembly but the controller board attached on the drive .	St
1.17.3	My Process : 1 .	St
1.17.4	Buy an identical hard drive .	St
1.17.5	My experience tells me it must be exactly the same , right down to the manufacturer , part number , size , speed , etc .	St
1.17.6	2 .	St
1.17.7	Remove the controller board from the good drive and swap with the controller from the bad drive .	St
1.17.8	The screw head type varies - Torx , Allen , Phillips , etc .	St
1.17.9	3 .	St
1.17.10	Install and boot or read from the old hard drive with the new controller on the drive installed .	St
1.17.11	Transfer the data to a known good drive .	St
1.17.12	4 .	St
1.17.13	You can continue to use the old drive with the new board , or swap back and use the new drive with the new board .	St
1.17.14	This beats the many dollars data recovery companies charge to recover data for the price of a new drive .	St
1.17.15	Hey , if it does n't work , at least you have a new hard drive you can use .	St
1.18.1	Wrap well , let it come up to temp and I still think your chances are about 10 % .	St
1.18.2	Condensation will usually kill it and if you warm it up slowly itwill lock again but hey , if you ca n't afford restoration , you have nothing to lose .	St
1.18.3	Let us know what happened .	St
1.19.1	Place the failed Drive in an USB External Enclosure , wrapped tightly in a Ziploc Bag or plastic wrap .	St
1.19.2	Then KEEP it in the Freezer , with the USB Cable trailing out to the Computer .	St
1.19.3	Computer too far away ?	Ques
1.19.4	Place the frozen Drive in a Cooler with Sealed Gel Ice Packs .	St
1.19.5	I have not tried this , but it would keep the Drive cold far longer , and would minimize condensation issues .	St
1.20.1	This is a last ditch effort to try to get the drive spinning to copy the data .	St
1.20.2	The reason behind this is the principle of heat contracts and cold expands .	St
1.20.3	If the mechanism inside the dirve is jammed this could unjam it .	St
1.20.4	It wo n't work if you have a fry circuit or crash heads on the platter or the mechanism is to far gone for this to work .	St
1.21.1	I read all the stuff before it and could n't figure out how a hard drive can be kept cold enough during reinstallation to be worth the time in the freezer !	St
1.21.2	I can just imagine some poor sod freezing it , rushing to install it , try it but it 's warm and fails , remove it , freeze it ...	St
1.21.3	FOREVER !	St
1.21.4	But somehow , putting a drive anywhere moisture is bound to be while keeping it attached to an electrical source is bound to make you very , very unhappy sooner or later .	St
1.21.5	I had a Gateway drive that was bad and failed in 2 months .	St
1.21.6	It also made The Click Of Death before it was removed .	St
1.21.7	I would have tried the freezer trick with that 16 MB beauty but Gateway replaced it with an upgrade - a whopping 21MB ! ! ! !	St
1.21.8	- and would have voided that replacement if I 'd removed the drive myself .	St
1.21.9	( By the way , that & quot ; garbage & quot ; Gateway lasted 3 years after that and then only the sound card failed .	St
1.21.10	Go figure . )	St
1.21.11	Regarding an eBay hard drive AT ANY PRICE tho , remember that a hard drive is delicate and may have been working before the shipper dropped it , post office punted it onto a convayer belt that dropped it , and the mail carrier dropped it trying to put it in your mailbox before handing it to a neighbour ( who shook it out of curiousity ) to give you .	St
1.21.12	But you 're annoyed that you spend ( GASP ! )	St
1.21.13	$ 10 ? ? ?	Ques
1.21.14	I suggest you skip the mail order altogether and go to a used computer parts store , test the drive there , and bring it home yourself .	Sug
1.21.15	No space in the freezer needed ... : -D	St
1.22.1	I have tried this several times as a last resort .	St
1.22.2	Once it allowed me to read the drive long enough to retrieve data .	St
1.22.3	Another time the drive actually kept working reliably after the freezer treatment ( I have no idea why ) .	St
1.22.4	Most times it does n't work at all .	St
1.22.5	But if the next step is to toss the drive , why not try it .	St
1.23.1	Take a look at this webpage .	Sug
1.23.2	Very interesting .	Polite
1.23.3	http : //geeksaresexy.blogspot.com/2006/01/freeze-your-hard-drive-to-recover-data.html	St
1.24.1	ereal2000 I think you got it a bit backwards - heat expands and cold contracts - but you were on the right track .	St
1.24.2	This idea sounds bizarre , but desperate times call for desperate measures .	St
1.24.3	Next time I think we 'll find a way to double maybe even triple ghost the files to keep a crisis from happening again .	St
