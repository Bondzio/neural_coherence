<s> hey guys whats up well...here's what happened my power supply got damaged, no idea why or how since it was only 2 weeks old...but it died, so i bought a new one, hooked it up and turned on my pc... primary slave drive fail showed up, so i turned everything off, and checked was what going on, turns out the drive wasnt connected correctly, the belt was kinda loose, so i fixed that, and turned it on, everything went well, the drive showed up on the bios and no failure was detected, windows loads up and then the drive doesnt show up... how do i fix this? </s>
