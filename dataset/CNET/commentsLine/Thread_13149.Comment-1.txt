i was looking at the lite on sohw-1633s and the plextor 712a/sa.
the lite on is $40 cheaper and i wanted to know which one was better.
both got good reviews on newegg.
oh and i was planning on purchasing a lite on ltr-52327s as a cheap cd-r writer as well.
it also got good reviews so i figured the dvd writer should be good too.
please help.
thanks.
