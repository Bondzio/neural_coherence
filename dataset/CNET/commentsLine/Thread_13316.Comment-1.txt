my hard disk and graphics card seem to get quite hot after only a few minutes of operation.
my pc has been suffering from overheating problems for a few weeks now and i have installed a new fan, but the problem still persists (the pc will turn off after things get 'too' hot).
my graphics card, is so hot that i can't actually touch it (in operation) without getting a slight burn!
the hard disk is not as hot, but still feels unnecessarily hot.
is this normal?
the problem ceases when i use a household fan, so should i invest in a more expensive, more powerful fan?
if so, should it act as an 'exhaust' or should it blow in air?
i only have space for a fan at the back on the top, just under the psu.
apologies for the rather long post, and any help would be greatly appreciated thanks, marc
