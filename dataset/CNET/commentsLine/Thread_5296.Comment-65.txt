when you said a new pc i presume that you are referencing a desktop machine in which case generally speaking i wouldn't worry as you can generally easily add a graphics card later.
a few caveats to consider nevertheless.
first, is that generally speaking most oems will put a low end power supply (300w max typically) that won't be able to handle many higher end graphics cards.
in addition, if some of the very high end cards may be too long to even fit in the case.
that was certainly the case with some of the 11 inch cards i've seen people try to put in the standard hp desktop case.
that being said for a casual gamer any card that size probably would be overkill.
the final major caveat i would consider is whether this machine is a slimline case.
you can get a video card for a slimline machine, but they tend to be lower end cards so if you are really interested in getting something very high end later on you may want to avoid slim line machines.
for someone buying a new desktop i would suggest trying the integrated graphics first before spending the money on a dedicated card.
since you don't sound like you play a lot of games you will probably find that for most tasks you will hardly notice.
integrated graphics aren't as bad as they used to be.
the newer integrated solutions have enough processing power to playback blu-ray content so you may find that integrated graphics go farther than you think.
that being said on a larger resolution monitor integrated graphics may be wholly inadequate so ymmv.
as for laptops generally speaking you are pretty well limited generally to the graphics chipset the machine comes with.
for a while i saw a number of machines with mxm based graphics chipsets, but it seems to no longer be supported anymore so i would be surprised if you found any laptops where the dedicated graphics wasn't soldered to the logic board.
therefore for a laptop i would buy the best graphics that you feel comfortable spending.
