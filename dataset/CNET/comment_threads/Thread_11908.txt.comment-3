If you look at the benchmarks out there, a Celeron D at 2.4ghz will perform about the same as a sempron 2400+(1.667ghz).
However, a sempron/motherboard combination will be a bit cheaper than a Celeron D/motherboard combo.
Plus, the Celeron D's are quite loud and run hot.
The only time I would get a Celeron D is if you wanted to overclock it.
