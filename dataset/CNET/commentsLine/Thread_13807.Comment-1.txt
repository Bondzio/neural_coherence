i heard that if one is using core duo or core 2 duo series processors (or not using the new core i 3/5 etc processors) an external hdd of 1 tb or above might not work properly?
i mean they say it would be slow or it might not be compatible etc etc.
so, in short, i am using windows 7 ultimate, 2 gb or ram, 2 + 2 gigs of core 2 duo processor on hp dv 6500 special edition and i am planning to buy wd my passport essential se (1 tb), so would have i any issues or would it be ok?
or may be i should just buy the my passport essential(500 gb)?
thanks in advance.
