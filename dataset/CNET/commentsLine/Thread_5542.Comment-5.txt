it turned out the member was recording the bd-re on a dvr and trying to get them to work on the pc and other dvd/br players.
they seemed to stop posting when they switched to dvd-rw or dvd+rw media.
the dvr offered a means to make dvd r/w media compatible with other machines.
as to an apple, i fear that since apple didn't send out units with bd capability you'll have to question the maker of that bd drive.
i can't comment further since many details are missing.
