but let me share i've used hundreds of this model -&gt;  (the standard unit.)
it's quite odd to find wacom selling serial port devices, in fact i didn't see that on their site.
too bad the story and model number is missing but i can write the standard model i noted is great for serial port work.
you can find that adapter at newegg and amazon as well.
