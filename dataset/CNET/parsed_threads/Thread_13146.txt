<s> I need a driver for the Ricoh RW5125A to work on a windows 98 (i can give you the specs if need be) any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Today, no driver is required for it to function as a CD or DVD &quot;drive.&quot; However software to record or play a DVD might be needed. </s>
<s> Some refer to such as drivers but they are not drivers. </s>

<s> I didn't even try the drive as a DVD drive yet, (I didnt try to play a DVD) but I dont have software anyway. </s>
<s> My Computer labels it as a CD-Rom, I'll have to try and find some software for it and see if that works. </s>
<s> Though somebody gave me this site, http://forum.rpc1.org/dl_firmware.php?download_id=319, I don't know what to get from it. </s>
<s> subtract that comma at the end and the link will work </s>
<s> That's fine and how I see many working drives. </s>

<s> Though somebody gave me this site,&quot; I don't see how that applies. </s>
<s> If you want to play a DVD, you'll need DVD player software such as WinDVD, PowerDVD. </s>
