this could be caused by a number of things: 1. cds and dvds became corupt by some external influence 2. the optic drive's optics are misaligned 3. the laser head is dirty i choose #3. purchase a lens cleaner cd and use it.
if that fails a new drive is in order.
less than $50 for a new dvd+/- drive.
