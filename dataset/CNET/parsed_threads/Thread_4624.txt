<s> Here's the situation. </s>
<s> Our historical society is publishing a photo-oriented history book using photos from individual's private -- and often family -- collection. </s>
<s> What I am looking for is a high quality scanner that I can reasonably pack up and take to the contributor's home where I can scan the photos on site. </s>
<s> Specs required for scans: 300 dpi Output size: at least 8 inches wide or 16 inches wide for a double spread. </s>
<s> Color Mode: grayscale (8-bit) Recommendations? </s>
<s> Thanks S </s>
<s> But how about http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Using+a+digital+camera+to+scan+photographs Armed with a 8 megapixel camera I get great results and it's portable. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I work at a historical society and use a couple of portable USB-powered scanners (Canon, Xerox) with a laptop to do just as you say. </s>
<s> Either brand and others can be had for &lt;$100. </s>
<s> By the way, scan black and white photos as full color, not greyscale, to get a good quality scan and be sure to save as TIF files. </s>
<s> You may want to scan at 600dpi as well to get the best image. </s>
<s> The publisher requests that the color mode be set to grayscale 8-Bit -- so we will probably follow that direction. </s>
<s> What are the models of Canon and Xerox scanners you are using? </s>
