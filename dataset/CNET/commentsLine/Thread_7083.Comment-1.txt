suddenly hd would not boot... goes &quot;tick, tick, tick&quot; trying; then i get a message that i must boot with a cd.
i replaced the 14 month old 80 gb western digital hd... reloaded xp pro and my computer is up and running.
but i lost all data on the original hd... i am wondering if the problem could be only a virus that i might be able to correct somehow?
or since it sounds like an electro-mechanical problem, do i just have to send the hd off to a data recovery company at some terrific expense?
yep, i am intent upon being more careful to back up data from now on.
