<s> Not sure if this is the best part of the forum to post this but just today I switched on my computer (running Vista H.Premium) and it appeared to get stuck on the screen with the green loading bar that goes across with Microsoft Corporation written beneath it. </s>
<s> The bar was still going across but nothing was loading. </s>
<s> On some other forum sites I found that the problem could be something related to the HDD having major problems. </s>
<s> I eventually had to manually switch off the computer and then booted it back up again. </s>
<s> When I was prompted I chose the option to start Windows normally. </s>
<s> This time it booted fine. </s>
<s> Is this a sign that my hard drive is beginning to fail? </s>
<s> Or was it just a random windows typical failure? </s>
<s> The computer is only about 1 year old and I only installed sp1 about a week ago. </s>
<s> Thanks --Jono-- </s>
<s> Most Vista machines are still under warranty. </s>
<s> Call it in so you won't pay for this one. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You don't want to know how much it costs out of warranty. </s>
<s> well a 250gb SATA HDD costs about $180 USD and Acronis True image costs $50 USD. </s>
<s> So can I: Add the new hard drive as a slave drive and copy all the files over from the Master. </s>
<s> Make it bootable then keep that hard drive handy, and if the other one ever goes, just plug it in and boot from it. </s>
<s> If I can do that, $230 USD is an 'OK' amount to spend. </s>
<s> All I want to really know is &quot;Is the drive likely to die anytime soon?&quot;. </s>
<s> See if they have a HD fitness test program. </s>
