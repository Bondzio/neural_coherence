1.1.1	I am using arctic cooling freezer 7 as my cpu fan and my cpu temperature is 40 C idle and 60 C fully loaded .	St
1.1.2	I think it is pretty high and it may reduce my cpu life .	St
1.1.3	Should I get a better CPU heatsink ?	Ques
1.1.4	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.1.6	computer spec : 3.2ghz pentium 4 640	St
1.2.1	gotten an AMD .	St
1.2.2	They outperform and consume much less power .	St
1.3.1	I have a p4 630 and the temps are about 2-4 deg c higher than yours and I think they run that way .	St
1.4.1	BTW , my temp was not that high .	St
1.4.2	It was 36 idle and 47 loaded .	St
1.4.3	After i replaced my powersupply ( it was burnt ) , i think i touched the heatsink during the process and no matter how i mounted and tighten the heatsink , it is not as good as it was b4 .	St
1.4.4	Im sure it has nothin to do with the psu because i replaced with the same one .	St
1.4.5	I think it 's just my heatsink clamps are not as tight as it was b4	St
