1.1.1	I know, probably a weird question.	St
1.1.2	But I'm wondering if I could possibly get another LCD monitor (like the Philips 190B6CS/27 19&quot; with one USB port installed) and attach some sort of VGA-to-bluetooth adapter or something.	St
1.1.3	If I could spend under $500 ($400 monitor, &gt;$100 adapter/bluetooth module) and add a second workstation in my living room using my PC I'm currently building (Athlon 64 X2 4400+ 2.2 GHz duals, 2 GB ram, 250 GB HD 16 MB buffer, 256 MB ram w/ SLI support, Windows XP either MCE or Professional)... That would be a-m-a-z-i-n-g.	St
1.1.4	It would cost $500-ish and use my $2200 build, a $6500 computer when including software and peripherals.	St
1.1.5	anybody know of a solution?	St
1.1.6	I'm sure I can't be the only one who could appreciate this benefit.	St
1.1.7	Sure I realize it's still sharing one computer and two people can't use it at once (probably), and I imagine software can handle input options (like a KVM switch) so input shows on BOTH monitors or only one according to which key/mouse is used.	St
1.1.8	Okay PDD's (product developers and designers) get cracking!	St
1.1.9	I wanna be able to buy this product within 12 months if it doesn't already exist..	St
1.2.1	http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/07/how_to_make_a_w_1.html There are wifi terminal type units out there but I leave it for you to hunt them down.	St
1.2.2	Cheers, Bob	Polite
1.3.1	I don't know if he understood what you want.	St
1.3.2	I too want a monitor that can hookup via bluetooth.	St
1.3.3	It's another laptop in the other room and I'd like to just grab it with KB, mouse, and monitor (a separate one, not the 2nd laptop).	St
1.3.4	I alread have the KB and mouse so I'd hate to buy some wifi terminal.	St
1.3.5	That would present other probs.	St
1.3.6	I know you can get PC Anywhere or the like, but I want the 2 comps isolated due to the pileup of spyware and viruses this one gets due to my &quot;surfing habits&quot; So, I wanna too, does it exist?	St
1.4.1	With just the KB, mouse and monitor there will be some other hardware to get it to connect up.	St
1.4.2	Bluetooth is not an option past 32 feet (yes there are 100 foot devices) and the paltry speed will have us waiting for a screen to show up (figure seconds for each video frame change.)	St
1.4.3	Bluetooth is not the answer.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
