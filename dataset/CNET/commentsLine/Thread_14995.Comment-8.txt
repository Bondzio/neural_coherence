here's a review you might be interested to read about the antec earthwatts ea500 ...looks good.
psu's like this aren't usually bundled with cases.
careful and don't look at the corsair psus ... they're the new kid on the psu block made by a major mfg (seasonic) and they're getting knockout ratings everywhere .
.
.
5 year warranty included on the ones' i've seen.
btw ...energy efficient too...but maybe not as high as the antec earthwatt series..80plus.
