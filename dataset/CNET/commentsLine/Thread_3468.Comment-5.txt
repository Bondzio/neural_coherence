as a result of the first failure, gimmicky &quot;independent&quot; supplies were replaced with a common xt power supply shared by both drives.
the main use of both drives has been archiving dvds for speedier access, and a weekly backup to the 1tb drive.
as cited previously everything was fine until i relied on that backup to restore the laptop to which it's connected.
previously, the 500gb drive failed in exactly the same circumstances, and i don't believe in co-incidence!
