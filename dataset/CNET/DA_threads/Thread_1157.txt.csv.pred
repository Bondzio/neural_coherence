1.9.1	http : //www.tempestcbsi.com/guide/guide.aspx ? ID=71 & ref=France	Ques
1.10.1	which I do n't know the answer to , having not been there or done that myself .	St
1.10.2	Is USA wifi technical spec for radio channels , etc .	St
1.10.3	( which are subject to U.S. FCC requirements ) the same as in France ( subject to their sovreign governmental regulations ) .	St
1.10.4	In other words , will a wifi card in a laptop purchased in the USA connect successfully to an EU hotspot ?	Ques
1.10.5	Or will it be like FM radio where US stations are on the odd numbered decimals of the frequecy while EU ( or is it UK ) stations are on the even numbered decimals , so our & quot ; standard & quot ; radios do n't work over there .	St
1.10.6	One thing I 've noticed when downloading firmware and drivers for wireless stuff is that some of it is region-specific .	St
1.10.7	I guess , in the worst case , you 'd have to buy a new PCCard wifi adapter that conforms to the local radio requirements when you get there .	St
1.10.8	But it would be so much more convenient if US and EU radio specs were the same so the equipment would work on both sides of the big pond .	St
1.10.9	dw	St
1.11.1	I have bought several Laptop , desktop , access point and wifi card from UK and USA , they all work together with the existing network , in singapore and their neighboring country .	St
1.12.1	NIL	St
1.13.1	USA using 110v ... while many other use 220v .	St
1.13.2	AND the powerline jack differences .	St
1.13.3	So you still need to buy a power and jack converter..	St
1.14.1	It because many product are sold only to specific country/region.. so its depends on your product Serial number.. it might also make you download locally , ( supposedly ) more faster .	St
1.14.2	i.e some HP desktop that sold in Asia Pasific have something like 'AP ' in the end of the product name ...	St
1.15.1	I have used an international roaming internet account for several years .	St
1.15.2	It can cover connections by dialup , ISDN , Or WiFi/hotspot .	St
1.15.3	see www.net-roamer.com Mark	St
