i am running about 8 computers in my home business, and my web guy tells me that he can't make my combination of macs and pcs &quot;work together.&quot; the current method of printing is to email him all documents so he can send them to the printer.
he's also telling me he can't create multiple email accounts, so all the business emails come into one account which he then reads and passes along.
now i am no genius when it comes to computers, but i possess a basic understanding.
can't i just use a wired router and create a network?
i realize there may be potential issues with sata vs. usb ports on the printers as one is older, so worst case scenario would be two separate networks, right?
