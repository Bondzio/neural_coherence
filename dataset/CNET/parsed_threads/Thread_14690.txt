<s> I bought my Vista 64 bit desktop 6 months ago and have been trying to connect two wireless laptops running XP. </s>
<s> I have been all over looking for help on the web. </s>
<s> HP will not help without paying more or will Geek Squad. </s>
<s> I have a Linksys Router WRT54G that I am using and both wireless laptops connect to the internet fine, but just can't get a network. </s>
<s> I have made sure all PCs have the same name and been through settings after settings. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> Vista has us install a network discovery item on XP. </s>
<s> Your post writes you've researched this but not a word about it. </s>
<s> I see nothing about firewalls either. </s>
<s> More at http://www.vistax64.com/vista-networking-sharing/124061-network-discovery-between-vista-xp.html when the LLTD and more is covered. </s>

<s> Thanks I followed that link and now I can see the 2 XP computers but not the Vista. </s>
<s> But it tells me I do not have access to the files. </s>
<s> As far as firewall I am running Kaspersky and no Windows firewall. </s>
<s> How you manage accounts. </s>
<s> Let's say I'm on my xp machine as BOB. </s>
<s> I try to connect to that Vista machine and get that message. </s>
<s> BOB may not have an account on that Vista machine. </s>
<s> It's simple if you think about it. </s>
