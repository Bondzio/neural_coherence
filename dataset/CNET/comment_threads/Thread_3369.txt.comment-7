I just got finished rebuilding a Dell Dimension L-series computer and it was like trying to stuff a shoebox with a CRT TV.
The motherboard didn't want to fit in, the ps was always in the way, all the drive bays were in the way of the right corner's motherboard clip (that's what I hate about it, it uses clips instead of screws and spacers) the cables didn't want to go the way I wanted them to go, basically, I need a bigger case than that.
