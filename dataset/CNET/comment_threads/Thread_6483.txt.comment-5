Though I'm not sure that's exactly the case.
In the System Preferences, I can only choose one input source--the built in microphone, or the line in audio input.
I've tried adjusting the input level for the line input in AMS, but I don't notice any change, either.
However, the amplifier part of it might be more what's going on.
I suppose it doesn't exactly work like my PC's sound card line in, hehe, where it would supposedly amplify it.
Thanks for the help!
