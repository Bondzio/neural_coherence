i started the rma form.
i keep boxes and receipts for everything i own for about 6 months after i buy an item.
so i have thrown away the receipt and the box, i believe i do have it registered, but no way to show this fact, because i can't get anyone on the phone at pny's offices to corroborate this.
long story shorter, i can't return it for rma.
guess i will have to buy a new one and take the lesson learned.
