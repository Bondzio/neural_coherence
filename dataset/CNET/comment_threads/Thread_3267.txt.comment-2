He's much better off picking the right sound card, and I mean a PRO-level sound card like Roland stuff, not the Creative Labs stuff.
The CPU and mainbord wouldn't matter much for music editing.
But then, the term &quot;editing music&quot; can vary slightly.
Does he mean he want to do MIDI, or is he more into sound editing, like MOD tracking, Wav editing and so on?
