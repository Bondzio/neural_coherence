I need to run two different Powerpoint presentations on two different HD tvs from 1 PC. But the problem I see is that I also need the use of the PC monitor while the programs are running. Do I need two PC's? Is there a video card that can handle this? Is this much simpler than I imagine? Thanks Bigmart
