<s> which video card is best for moderm video games: is it RADEON 9200, or RADEON 9600? </s>
<s> The 9600 wins on better. </s>
<s> That model is however bested by even more current models. </s>
<s> Let me be clear the 9200 is a value card and while better than last years cheaps, is today's value card. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I just bought ATI Radeon9200 128 DDR PCI ( I dont have agp slot). </s>
<s> Its cheaper and work fine and have TV Out option with Dual monitor support.If you wantcheaper card with very good performance than go for 9200. </s>
<s> If you have money then go for 9600 agp. </s>
<s> He is right, 9600 is better. </s>
<s> I don't know what games you want to play...or what processor you use, or how much RAM or if you have an AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) on your Motherboard. </s>
<s> But all of that aside. </s>
<s> If I were you, looking for a relativley inexpensive soulution to play modern video games (I'm assuming games such as Unreal 2004, Half-Life Counterstrike, Half-Life 2, Hitman: Contracts, Halo etc..etc..etc..) I would splurge on something like the Radeon 9800Pro 128MB. </s>
<s> You might ask why? </s>
<s> Here is why The Radeon 9600XT (Top of the 9600 line, above pro) costs around $150-$240 ($240 is for AIW) The MSI RX9800PRO (Radeon 9800Pro) costs $195.99 To explain this more to you, the Radeon 9800 Pro is one of the best cards you can buy. </s>
<s> It will perform just like its $400 Big brother the Radeon 9800XT, and it can double the performance of the 9600. </s>
<s> The 9200 for modern video games basicly isn't an option, it runs like a GeForce FX 5200, they are budget cards designed for some gaming, but more for basic computing. </s>
<s> If you would specify if you have an AGP that would be very nice. </s>
<s> Also how big is your PSU (Power Supply Unit) the 9800Pro needs either 300W or 350W minimum, I know its somewhere in there. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
