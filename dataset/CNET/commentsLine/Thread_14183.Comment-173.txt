amiga 1000. a thousand curses on commodore for botching their business and sinking their machines.
i would love to see what the design team would have done to stay ahead of everyone else if they were still together.
followed by an a2000 and then a3000.
my wife went to the dark side and i got an ibm aptiva as the next upgrade.
i have been homebrew builder since then.
nothing fancy, i just haven't seen the advantage of dell, gateway, or hp for desktops without incredible incentives that don't show up.
