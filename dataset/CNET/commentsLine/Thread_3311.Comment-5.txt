prices with ram go by demand.
the more the demand, the more the supply and that is what becomes cheaper.
look at the old pc sdram 133 it cost about$90 for a 512 stick.
about the same as pc2100 ddr.
then look at pc3200 ddr.
the prices are a bit cheaper because it whats in demand now.
i'm not 100% sure but,believe the amd duals will go into the socket 939 boards.
go with xp pro for sure.
longhorn will be build for the newer faster 4+ gig and 64bit processors, but will look a lot like xp,with some newer feature for digital and probably some voice command features ect.
i would go the other way around with the harddrives.
theres more need for speed in gaming.
as far as price if your building one yourself you can build a real decent computer for 7 or 8 hundred.
dollars.
