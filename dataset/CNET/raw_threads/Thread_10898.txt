Hi I wanted to know what the best way to reformat a LaCie HD from a Mac format to a Windows Vista format is? I have the LaCie big disk 500GB with firewire and USB. I'm using a format program on my Mac thats making the LaCie into a MS-DOS file system. Will this work or do I need to try something new? Thank you for your help.

Would you like to schedule it to be converted the next time the system restarts (Y/N)? press y then restart your computer and then it should be done. may go through a screen before the welcome screen

OK the format that the iMac made on the LaCie worked with Vista, but when I right clicked on the LaCie Vista had a option to reformat the LaCie to the NTFS file system. I looked on the Microsoft's web site and they talked about how NTFS works with Vista, but don't work with earlier Microsoft OS? Since I'm only going to use Vista I think having a NTFS systems is not a bad deal with it's better reliability and stuff. Again thank you for your help.

One more thing do any of you know how to get my external hard drive to sleep when my computer sleeps? When I had it on my Mac the external went to sleep, but on the Vista it don't. Thank you.
