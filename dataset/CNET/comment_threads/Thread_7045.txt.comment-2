Please goto the &quot;Storage forum&quot; find the sticky post.
The uppermost post on that forum has much info and required details in *possible* rescue of your data.
understand, any attempts may further reduce recovery of data, the choice is yours.
Also, I like to part that any critical data should be saved to CD/DVD/BD discs as a more safe storage method.
Practically all ext.
storage media will fail in some way sooner or later, even if yours is a back-up it shouldn't be the sole backup, you now understand why.
good luck http://forums.cnet.com/storage-forum/ tada -----Willy
