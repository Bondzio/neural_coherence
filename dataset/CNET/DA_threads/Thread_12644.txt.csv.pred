1.1.1	I have a WD external hard drive and when I went to plug in the USB cable into the device, the plug in slot pushed directly into the device.	St
1.1.2	I am not very literate when it comes to computers so could someone explain to me (in very simple terms) how I can get my photos off this device.	St
1.1.3	I am desperate to save my photos of my son and I don't want to do anything that may put them at risk.	St
1.1.4	PLEASE HELP.	St
1.1.5	THANK YOU!	St
1.1.6	!	St
1.2.1	If not, take it to a shop and have them put the hard disk into a new case.	St
1.2.2	DIY type?	St
1.2.3	Open the case of the external drive, see if it's IDE or SATA connections and order a replacement case from newegg.com or other places.	St

1.3.1	Examples: http://www.google.com/products?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4ADBR_enUS258US258&q=USB+port+cards&um=1 By-the-way, usually there are ports for USBs in the front of the PC tower and the back of the tower on desktop PCs.	St
1.3.2	Sorry, this doesn't apply to laptops.	St
1.3.3	There are also USB extensions cords: http://www.google.com/products?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4ADBR_enUS258US258&q=USB+extension+cord&um=1 hummmmm, second of these in just a few days.	St
1.4.1	The broken port appears to be in the WD external hard drive.	St
1.5.1	If the USB was being plugged into the computer then a new USB port is needed.	St
1.5.2	I believe there is a cable that runs from the external drive to a USB port so if the port is screwed up then it must be on the computer.	St
1.5.3	This card will provide a new port without replacing the motherboard, for around $10.00.	St
1.5.4	Comprehend?	St
1.5.5	One of those days, Bob?	St
1.6.1	It's the other end at fault.	St
1.6.2	&quot;I have a WD external hard drive and when I went to plug in the USB cable into the device, the plug in slot pushed directly into the device.&quot; Your fix at the system end would work, but apparently it's at the device end, thus a new box.	St
1.6.3	Of course, if I could take it apart and check the innards, maybe the fix if not &quot;broken&quot; and slipped off or minor epoxy application to keep port at bay, all at the owners risk.	Sug
1.6.4	What?	St
1.6.5	-----Willy	St
1.7.1	With 911 in there handle someones asking for trouble.	St
1.7.2	No fooling with fate.	St
