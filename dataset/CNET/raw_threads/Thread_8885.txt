The computer recognizes it and AOL does too, but, when I try to connect online it comes back with a timeout and says no dial tone? I know the line has a dial tone, it's the same one I use to dial out on with mine, not at the same time either. The computer had a lot of spyware and adware on it among other things, which I removed. I also even reinstalled windows without reformatting the HDD. I can't figure this one out. Any ideas out there.

Try reinstalling all the software and hardware(if it can be removed). If this doesnt work. The card may be dead. It could be a part that device manager might not reveal that the actual card is bad. Modems are cheap so it shouldnt be too bad if this is the case. Tyler

Still the same situation, I'm also leaning towards a bad card now. Gateway combo card, windows ME, just don't understand why the computer is showing it good. Modem initializes and dials but that's it until it times out in 60 seconds.
