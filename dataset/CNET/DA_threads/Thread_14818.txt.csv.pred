1.1.1	I have a Dell Dimension P3 and a Dell p D dual core towers.	St
1.1.2	I want to use one mouse,keyboard and monitor to control both units I plan to use a KVM switch with ps2 connectors and vga monitor connection These towers are on dial-up with each using a serial modem to connect to ISP.	St
1.1.3	Both towers have Windows XP sp2 installed.	St
1.1.4	My question 1) Will both unit have to continue using there individual modems 2) Will this type connection even work.	St
1.1.5	Will i be able to logon from either unit so as to keep the P3 updated I am new to networking so any suggestions will be appreciated Ray	St
