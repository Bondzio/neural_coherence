you say you have a buffalo wireless router with both wired (from your desktop pc) and wireless (from your notebook) connections.
you say your wife's new high speed connection has only one &quot;plug.&quot; what kind of output connection is that?
is it a standard ethernet connector?
is it a standard ethernet patch cable that connects from the plug in the box to the ethernet input connector on your wife's computer?
if it is as i suspect, you could connect that plug to the &quot;w a n&quot; connector on the buffalo router and use the router to distribute the high speed internet connection to all three systems - your wife's computer and your desktop pc by wire and your notebook by wireless.
all of you would be connected to her isp at the initial point of connection to the internet as a whole, but once your physical connection passes through her isp, you can set your home page to anything you want.
the only things that might not work the way they do now are proprietary services of your isp that are only work for customers when they are connected through one of their incoming lines.
you didn't say who your isp is, but one example of this is aol with their proprietary mail interface and some of their members-only rooms.
give us some more information and we might be able to find a way to share that new high-speed line.
