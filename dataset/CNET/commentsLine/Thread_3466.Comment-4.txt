i was wondering about kvm switches and had a few questions about them.
i was told i could only have my monitor, keyboard and mouse all hooked up at once.
from what you were saying i could only have my mouse and keyboard hooked up and keep my 2 monitors.
can i just only hook up my mouse and keyboard?
if i can just hook up the mouse and keyboard, what is the delay between switching from one pc to the other?
