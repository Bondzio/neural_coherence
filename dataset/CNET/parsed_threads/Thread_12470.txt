<s> I have Windows XP Home Ed. </s>
<s> and use the latest version of MS Office, including using Outlook. </s>
<s> Today, I downloaded Avast, but after doing so, remembered why I hated it before. </s>
<s> I also had downloaded Firefox, but couldn't get the favorites to import from IE. </s>
<s> Then things started freezing up. </s>
<s> So, I had a bright idea: Do a system restore to yesterday, thus getting rid of the two programs. </s>
<s> OMG, what a mess! </s>
<s> When the cptr started up, first told me the Avast couldn't be installed. </s>
<s> I thought, right, since it is no longer officially there. </s>
<s> So, I did a search and sent the file to the recycle bin. </s>
<s> Then I ran my registry repair scan, which picked up five errors and I clicked the little &quot;fix&quot; button. </s>
<s> Then I tried to open Outlook and get the following message: extension failed to initialize. </s>
<s> Can't open file: extend.dat File may not exist, you may not have permission to open it, or it may be open in another program. </s>
<s> Right-click the folder that contains the file, and then click properties to check your permission for the folder. </s>
<s> Had to do another search for the extend.dat file. </s>
<s> Found THREE &quot;extend&quot; files, but none with the &quot;.dat&quot; tacked onto the end. </s>
<s> However, right-clicking did show it was a data file. </s>
<s> There was no &quot;permission&quot; thing when right-clicking - and I'm the only user of this computer. </s>
<s> However, when I moved it to &quot;Outlook&quot; (copy #3), it still didn't fix my error message. </s>
<s> The result in Outlook, as far as I can tell, is that I cannot initialize send/receive by hitting that on the toolbar or through using F9. </s>
<s> I have been able to create new messages and the send/receive works then. </s>
<s> I can also receive messages through the normally scheduled send/receive times. </s>
<s> Argh! </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>

<s> For anyone who reads this, I finally reinstalled Avast, then deleted it and it took care of my problems. </s>
<s> Thanks to all who cared enough to look this far. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> A word about System Restore. </s>
<s> I will NOT remove applications. </s>
<s> It will only restore system settings and system files necessary for XP to work properly. </s>
<s> This is a very common mistake so don't feel bad. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> It restores the registry, right? </s>
<s> Whenever something funky happens I restore it, and it says &quot;Restoring Registry&quot; ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> What I found out was that deleting the AV program (sending it to trash) without deleting it from the system from the control panel was that it took a .dat file with it. </s>
<s> What I ended up doing was reinstalling the AV program, then deleting it properly through the control panel. </s>
<s> When I reinstalled it, it gave me back the file I needed for Outlook to work right. </s>
<s> Crazy thing. </s>
<s> But, I sweat a few bullets until I figured out what to do. </s>
<s> After that was done, I went back and recleaned the registry. </s>
<s> Thanks all! </s>
