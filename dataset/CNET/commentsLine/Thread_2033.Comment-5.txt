i am probably a little naive about this, but my reason for preferring a 5:4 aspect ratio to a wide screen is being able to see two documents at once one above the other, and see more of one document at a time.
graphics capabilities is not my primary concern.
i realize everything has moved to wide screen format.
perharps there are some disadvantages that i don't understand.
i welcome your thoughts on this.
