in your situation, you are going to require a wireless lan controller which is very expensive.
though one controller can manage and control up to 25 access points.
here at honda i manage 2 controlers with 22 access points and i do load balancing on both and have the extra one for fault tollerence.
these controlers push out to the access points a number of things.
they broadcast 3 different networks that we have set up for wireless.
a guest network, a non secret network, and a confidentail network.
all three wirelss and using the same access points set up through the controller.
in your case for home use, i don't think it would be cost effective to go this route.
though if you could find a wireless lan controller for cheap, then by all means go for it.... ~spyderz
