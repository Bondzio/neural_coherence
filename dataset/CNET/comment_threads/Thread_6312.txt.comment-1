I have 2 dell computers running windows xp pro connected through a wired dell router(cat 5 cable).
When I connected my new dsl modem to the router and ran the software.
My network doesn't work and I can't have both computers on or an IP conflict occurs and nothing works.
I can get either comp.
to work by itself when I mess with it.
Any help would be great.
Thanks DSL mess
