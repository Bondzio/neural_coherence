Will It work on integrated audio? 2. Will this work past the digital tv cutoff date? I have cable that brings me the channels not an antenna. The company says they have the digital cable switch covered

It has not been made clear to me which way they are planning. You might ask your provider which way they plan on going, if they will tell you. Now the other question. I see no reason that integrated audio would not work with this if your other components are working properly.
