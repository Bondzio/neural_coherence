thanks for the suggestion i double checked the manual and it appears i should be able to run both sata and ide concurrently.
while browsing the manual i came across this, &quot;if the hard disk was already formatted on a previous system, the setup bios may detect incorrect parameters.
select [manual] to manually enter the ide hard disk drive parameters.&quot; after looking up the parameters for the hard drive, i tried to manually enter the ide hard disk drive parameters; however, i was not able to do so.
the sectors, heads, and cylinders all had adjustable values but when i set them to the proper values and hit enter, they just reset to the incorrect values.
any other suggestions?
thanks
