I am a real organize freak and a thing that really bugs me are random files that have been installed on my second harddrive.
When i double click on that harddrive it opens it up and brings me with the folders i have put on it, but also things that have been in stalled in the past.
Two of the folders on there are just a bunch of numbers.
Also there is a file called &quot;WuTempt&quot;, and &quot;msdownload.tmp&quot; and four ffast files.
Is there anyway i can move these without hurting anything.
