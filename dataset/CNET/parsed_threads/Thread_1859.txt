<s> Hey everyone, newbie here. </s>
<s> It all started when i tried installing visual studio .net for a programming class i'm taking. </s>
<s> At first the installation was going smoothly but then it slowed way down. </s>
<s> It took 10 just to copy small files and the cd drive sounded like it was struggling. </s>
<s> After 3 hours it was only 25% done and still copying files. </s>
<s> So i stopped it and tried to just copy the cd image onto my computer. </s>
<s> The same thing happened. </s>
<s> It copied fast at first but then slowed down and then all of a sudden it just stopped copying and it looked like explorer quit. </s>
<s> I tried using a different ide cable then a different cd drive but the same thing happened so it might be the computer. </s>
<s> I wasn't sure where to post this but i hope someone can help. </s>
<s> Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. </s>
<s> With just what you wrote, it appears the machine needs repair. </s>
<s> Was there anything else you can share about the machine, the OS, if the case cover off helps? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Oh yea. </s>
<s> Well i'm using windows xp pro(2.2ghz pentium) with an asus p4s8x motherboard. </s>
<s> The drive is a 'visiontek' extasy 48x12x48x . </s>
<s> I took the case off and still doesn't work. </s>
<s> and a 300 watt power supply, i'm not sure if that helps. </s>
<s> Read http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ and see if you have enough POWER to drive what's in the box. </s>
<s> Remember that 300 Watt PSU is not really 300. </s>
<s> Tom did a nice writeup about this at http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ in which out of 21 units, 9 didn't meet their own specification or just blew up. </s>
<s> By stressing the PSU, it degrades quickly and your issue is very common. </s>
<s> BUT the nutty part here is that unless you replace the PSU with a 450 or so Watt unit and re-test, you can't tell if that's it. </s>
<s> I also asked you to share what you could about the machine, which is rather slim, but did reveal the PSU issue. </s>
<s> Other items would have been nice, but I know people don't always want to reveal all. </s>
<s> Best of luck finding the bad hardware. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for the link. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if i should shell out the cash for a new psu and find it still not working. </s>
<s> And as for anything else about the machine, i didn't think anything else i could say would make a difference. </s>
<s> But now that i think that power might be an issue - I have 512mb ddr ram, a radeon 9000 video card, an 80 gig hard drive plus a 10gb additional hard drive, 3 case fans and that cd-r drive. </s>
<s> Could not enough power be the issue? </s>
<s> and is there more info my system that could help? </s>
<s> If you read the last supplied articles, you would not be asking if there is enough power. </s>
<s> I can state there isn't enough. </s>
<s> I can make a fairly safe bet the base machine didn't come with 512M RAM (it does take Watts! </s>
<s> ), the second hard disk and such. </s>
<s> What can you eject? </s>
<s> That 10GB drive is 20 Watts or so and 256 M RAM isn't too bad compared to it not working. </s>
<s> Did you try that plus set the AGP RATE TO 1X? </s>
