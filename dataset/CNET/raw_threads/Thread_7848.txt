9193	2	376278	3210971	3210977	muuuunchie	1/1/10 2:47 PM	1.26235722E12	where?	do you happen to know a website of where I could get it (first time buying a gaming desktop)
9193	3	376278	3211051	3210904	ramarc	1/1/10 5:08 PM	1.26236568E12	agreed, definitely overpriced	this build is better for gaming and $950: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883227179&cm_re=x4_965-_-83-227-179-_-Product for the same price, this one bumps the cpu down a bit, but adds one of the best video cards: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883229156&cm_re=x4_955-_-83-229-156-_-Product if you're adventuresome, you could build it yourself: antec sonata iii with 500w power supply: $100 biostar ta785g3 am3 motherboard: $78 amd phenom x4 955 (3.2ghz): $165 patriot 4gb ddr3-1333: $90 xfx hd-577x hd 1gb hd 5770: $180 seagate/wd/hitachi 500gb 7200rpm hard drive: $60 sony/lg dvd rw drive: $30 microsoft/logitech wireless keyboard/mouse: $40 windows 7 home premium: $120 $863 total not sure why you had both a wireless network card and a killer nic network card since you can't benefit from both at the same time. no diff between 4gb and 6/8gb for gaming. not sure if your build included speakers -- if it did they're probably cheap. you can find a good 2.1 set for about $40; a good 5.1 set for $70.
