<s> Well, I have a Dell Dimension E310. </s>
<s> It has a mediocre video card, and I want to upgrade. </s>
<s> I know there are strict limitations regarding the type of card possible. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated on what cards I can and can't have. </s>
<s> PS: It's for a game. </s>

<s> From Yahoo answers, not my question. </s>
<s> &quot;You may be a bit dismayed with the internal expansion option. </s>
<s> While the E310 has two PCI slots and a single PCI Express x1 slot, it lacks a dedicated x16 PCI Express slot for graphics cards. </s>
<s> The integrated Intel GMA 950 graphics of the 915G chipset are your only option. </s>
<s> The combination of midrange CPUs with a lack of video-card options means the Dimension E310 won't do much for you as a gaming system. </s>
<s> Frame rates were too low to run Half-Life 2, although older games, such as Unreal Tournament 2004, should run at lower resolutions. </s>
<s> You could possibly increase the 256 megs of RAM that it came with. </s>
<s> That's the way the big manufacturers are. </s>
<s> They will sell you something, knowing very well that it is going to need upgrading in a year to three, and since theirs aren't a lot upgradeable, they expect you to purchase a new one.&quot; </s>
<s> the e310 lacks a pci-express x16 graphics slot and thus you can't add a decent gaming video card to it. </s>
<s> cannot add a decent video to your existing system. </s>
