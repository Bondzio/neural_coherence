hi, a brief explanation of my dell dimension 2350's problems: my computer would not boot at all one day recently when i turned it on.
no dell screen even, let alone anything with windows.
it has been a reliable computer for a few years.
i tried a few times and it did boot up.
once.
duing that time i ran virus protect.
nothing.
i have firewalls and virus protect so i did not think so.
since then i have tried installing windows on another, formatted hd.
it goes through early install steps, but then won't go to windows, but circles back again like nothing was installed.
so i checked bios.
it is not recognizing the attached hd.
i tried a few different hd.
different cables.
nothing.
it does recognize my cd/dvd drives.
i reset the bios.
i was going to flash bios.
the diagnostic code lights in the back are yellow, green, green, yellow.
not one that is on the list i have.
but similar (opposite) to board failure.
i wonder if it is the ide port on the motherboard.
do i need to replace the motherboard?
if so, do i have to buy the exact same one?
there are a lot of cables that go to the front i have not seen on other mbs.
any thoughts would be great.
this computer was working fine.
no changes.
and then poof, not working.
thanks!
!
