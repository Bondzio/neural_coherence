in the south, one doesn't want a pc that generates a lot of heat.
i have a pc (new this year) with integrated graphics running on a 300 watt power supply.
the pc heat factor in my office is noticeably reduced.
the system is great for office software, editing photos, watching hulu.com or games that are not too demanding of video like civilization iv.
when you add a video card, you're adding 70 to 250 watts of power consumption.
something to think about
