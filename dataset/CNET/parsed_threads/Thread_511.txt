<s> Hi all, We need to order a wireless adapter for our nonprofit organization's laptop, and I would really appreciate advice on a good, yet reasonably priced option. </s>
<s> Our laptop is a Dell Vostro 1000 running on Windows Vista OS. </s>
<s> Any advice is helpful. </s>
<s> One option I have found is the Linksys WUSB100. </s>
<s> Any feedback on that particular brand? </s>
<s> I have seen very mixed reviews online. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>

<s> Are you sure this one doesn't already have it? </s>
<s> If not, I think it has a pci express slot. </s>
<s> I'd go that route rather than USB if I could. </s>
<s> I can't recommend a brand, however. </s>
<s> Mixed reviews tend to be par for the course. </s>
<s> Just don't get the lowest or highest price model. </s>
<s> Something mid-range. </s>
<s> Linksys is popular and owned by a reputable company that sells high end equipment. </s>
<s> It should be ok. My own favorite brands have been 3com and USRobotics. </s>
