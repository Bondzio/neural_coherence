I'm starting an invitation and card business and need something to print the cards from. I've spoke with a few other people that have the same business and most print their cards right from their own printer. The two names that keep coming up are Canon and Rikoh but I don't see any reviews here on those two brands. I bought a lexmark black & white laser printer years ago to make cards with so I could run vellum through it and it never fed right, even regular paper would jam or feed 20 sheets threw at a time. Lemark got high reviews here from cnet but not from users so i'm not eager to go with another Lexmark. So what I need is something that prints high quality in both color & black/white for text & graphics...speed is not as important, but feeding is....I do not want to have to stand there and individually feed every sheet. I need something that can handle card stock and vellum, as well as smaller print sizes, 3x5 cards, but it does not have to be larger than 8.5x11 if it does that's a plus. And of course prices is always important. I am using a mac platform, leopard operating system. Thanks for any suggestions Nicole

The HP 9500, for example, is designed for 5.000 to 25.000 pages a month (not recommended to go to the maximum of 200.000, it seems). Assuming it lasts 3 years, that's 900.000 pages (36*25.000) for $ 6.000 or less than 1 cent depreciation per page. Doesn't sound too bad (of course, there's maintenance and toner also). But you might prefer one of the lower-end printers from http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/en/WF02a/18972-18972-3328060.html Or even another manufacturer. Also note that there are offerings of printer leases against an all-in price per copy, including everything. That's like leased cars. No investment, and if it's broke the repair is included also. Might be interesting for a starting business. Kees

I would guess between maybe 500-1000 prints, 1000 being generous. This is a business I am just starting so I need to get the clients first I forgot about the leasing option....but would it be worth it for the amount of prints I would be making? I will check out the lower end printer link that you sent. Thanks

Many of my clients are changing toner when they are nowhere near half the number of pages that HP quotes with the same coverage. The first thing to do is to determine whether you need postscript or not. Genuine Adobe postscript printers are expensive, while others will have a &quot;postscript translator&quot; which isn't as good, especially when printing postscript fonts. Second, try to get test prints from the printers you are considering. If possible arrange a demo so that you can test the paper you want to use in them. Some printers are very finicky about what paper you can use in them due to the fuser. Some paper might not do so well in printers which run very hot fusers, so check that out. If you buy a printer without doing that you may end up having to buy very expensive paper to get the results you want on it and that might kill your pricing. Third, find out how much consumables, maintenance and service are going to cost you. Show samples of what you want to do on it so that the reps can give you an accurate cost per page, that way you have a starting point on what your costs are going to be on printing. Hope that helped.

Thank your for the suggestions. I will definitely keep them in mind when I can narrow it down to a few brands. If you say stay away from HP....anyone like canon or ricoh??

I bought the hp3600 laser jet and it curled the card stock. It also made black streak marks on the card stock. It handled regular paper well. I ended up sending it back to hp. The toner was $80 each. I currently have an hp officejet Pro K550 (inkjet). It handles the heavy card stock well, graphics print beautifully, but the ink smears. I am still looking for the perfect printer. Good luck!

Perhaps, 400 MHZ CPU of 6180 has better performance than 333 MHZ CPU of 6130. Based on MacReview, phaser 6180 may be worth to invest for your business for better performance and picture quality. However, updated version of phaser printers cost much more than previous versions. Because both HP and Xerox reduced their toner capacity from up to 10000 pages (eg Phaser 740) to 2000 pages (Phaser 6130 & 6180), you need to pay $350 for genuine toner set of 6180 and $300 for 6130 (2000 printing 5%). For me, I have two old color laser jet printers: Phaser 740 and HP color laserjet 4500. Both printers are slow (~2.5 actual ppm color) and little bit noisy but the color qualities are as great as updated phasers and most of all, the price of consummables are extremely cheap in eBay (eg: fuser of HP 4500 costs less than $60 but you can print up to 100K with one fuser. 4 toner set of both HP4500 (6K pages) and Phaser 740 (10K) are less than $100 at eBay.). In conclusion, if you buy color laser printer first time, choose 6180, register your 1-yr warranty card, and learn how to manage color laser with free Xerox AS help. Better user management can increase printing capacity 500+ page more. On the contrary, if you are experienced color laser printer user and do not want to pay for high cost consummables, check eBay or local Craigslists and buy well maintained pre-owned color laser printer. You can upgrade 128MB printer RAM for $50 or less, and you can buy any part of Phaser with small part of AS fee.
7074	9	273212	2667169	2639345	czyadgrl	1/1/08 10:53 AM	1.19918478E12	Any luck yet?	I'm wondering if you had picked a printer yet? I've been looking for one for the same purpose for a few months and have not yet found one that I love. I have seen print samples from a Ricoh 811 on card stock ... print quality itself was so bad that it didn't even matter that it could accept card stock. What I've found so far ... Xerox 7400 and the Oki 9600 I have been told are actually the same printer inside with different interfaces. Both have excellent print quality, will take and print well on up to 105 lb metallic card stock (Stardream). BUT BUT BUT both print a light gray haze on heavy stock, over the whole page. Konika 7450 print quality was very nice but still not up to the Xerox, and the toner did not fuse onto 105lb metallic paper. (I know that's out of the printer's spec range, but it's what I need anyhow). And the Ricoh didn't even compare. I'm realizing that having access to a Xerox DocuColor 240 at the office has completely spolied my prining expectations. So if anyone knows a printer that prints just as well at a tenth of the price ... that's what I'm looking for. If you have any new information, please share! It seems that most reviews and even the sales folks do not understand our needs are different from most offices. Everyone tries to impress me with print speeds, processing time, and how much paper the trays can hold. I care about everything BUT that... graphics print quality, font handling and paper handling such as truly heavy card stock and custom paper sizes.

Take the Canon Pixma iP4300 and you have a straight through feed so the paper doesn't get bent or curled. I know some lasers will curl paper unless it is made for a laser printer. Just a thought I had
7074	12	273212	2668176	2667753	Lcullins	1/2/08 2:29 PM	1.19928414E12	Canon	I am looking into the Canon line of printers. Specifically the Canon Pixma Pro 9000 That may work for me. Does anyone have any feedback on the Canon line? Thanks!

The last time I used an ink jet to do a one page wedding program in purple ink, I think I went thru 4 or 5 color tanks for 150 sheets of paper. (This was quite a while ago, so I'm really hoping that technology has caught up). Anyone have feedback on the ink life and does the ink spread or smear at all?

That is, I have to use a magnifying glass to see it. It's not up to the 3 dollar cards you see at Hallmark. As to ink costs. I have used the 1 dollar per page metric for years and after paying for ink, paper and printer it has been too close for me to change it. If your clients won't pay the buck a page then it's time to cost out the printing at a print shop. Bob

I never considered metallic paper though...that would have been a thought! This is all new to me. I have not done any invitations yet...just holiday cards and I am very pleased with the results...although the printer did get finicky a few times but I think it was actually because I had to few sheets of the card stock in the feeder. That's what i'm guessing. It didn't seem to do that when I had a stack in there. It has a feeder that opens in the front. So far i'm pleased with the text and graphic quality but like I said I have not done that much with it yet. I'm going to try vellum out next...we'll see how it goes.

My heaviest stock is 100 lb cover/270 g/m. I called Canon today. They told me that they did not have a printer to meet the needs of an invitation business. So I called Epson. They recommended the Stylus C120. It is a new printer released fall 07. It handles heavy stock, has excellent laser quality graphics and uses pigment based inks instead of dye which should help with smearing. It wasn't very expensive so I thought I would give it a try. I will let you know how it works out. Best wishes!

I had one of the cheaper color laser printers, a Samsung CLP550, but this Ricoh printer has much cheaper consumables (the toner is a simple plastic jug, not a cartridge with rollers, gears, etc. I think the person complaining about the Ricoh printing on card stock did not have card stock chosen in the print driver. This printer came with some features that the Samsung did not. It came with a card with sample print outs and directions to print an internal file for color calibration. It also came with an internal page to print to physically align the print out on the page for all page handling input units (cassette, manual, duplex) very useful you want to duplex stuff and have them line up.

Black Epson 68 has about 7.5ml in it, while Suggested retail is 39.99 for a double pack. Meaning 2.86 dollars per mL, The color Epson 69 each have 5ml in them with a suggested cost of 2.47 dollars per ml. Now these prices are from Epson directly. Page yields are roughly 370 pages for the 68 black (single) and 350 pages for the 69 colors. However, I know from a person who uses this printer constantly that she is getting replacements about every 2-3 weeks. And she does not use the printer as much as a card/invitation business would.

I had sent paper and a file to a reputable printer dealer to get custom samples back. Given the generally good reviews I have seen on Ricohs, I was quite surprised at what came back as a sample. I can't say what options were selected on the printer, but all I sent was card stock, so who knows what they did.... What's the heaviest stock you have tried thru the Ricoh and how did it come out?

I too am beginning a custom invitation design business...up until now I always printed with a local printer, but think i'm losing a ton of money by doing that and have decided to invest in a good laser printer. I work primarily with stardream paper so it's important that the printer I select have the capacity to print on this. all suggestions are appreciated...thanks!

How much is the most you would spend? Do not look at anything above this price level. 2. Brands to consider - HP, Xerox, Oki 3. Then look at specs for each printer in your price range - narrow down the list to 5 or so. 4. Consumables - Of those five or so that you have narrowed down too, look at the price of the high yield cartridges (if available) and the page yields. Figure out the cost per page (cost/pages). That will help you with a rough number of what it will cost you to run.

I want to be able to print myself for 2 reasons: control and convenience! I researched, like you and came up with the OKI c6000n -- another forum said that Envelopments was recommending it. I also called Mountaincow and they said they recommend both an inkjet AND a laser and recommended an HP 4700 (?) for their laser and Epson Claria (I think it's R380 or something). I've had the OKI for a month now but it can't handle above 80 lb cover/110 index so I need to get another...any strong reocmmendations??? Anyone consider the Xerox Phaser 8560 with solid ink?

I know that doesn't necessarily mean that it won't take it. I do know that Xerox is pretty picky about what stock they recommend. Being, if you put a too-heavy stock through, and it ruins anything inside your printer, it DEFFINETLY will not be covered under any kind of warranty or maintenance plan. You'll be buying new guts for your printer. I recently emailed another invitation designer who I found on a blog. She is using the 8560 with solid inks. She said that she loved it, but after she described how she needed to calibrate it with every job, and other problems, I took it off my own list. It sounded like a lot of hassle. But she did use Stardream regularly. I emailed Envelopments a few months ago, and they recommended the Oki C5300 Color Laser and the Epson R1800 Color Inkjet., and said they were currently using both (it sounded like they have been testing out several. I did recently get samples from HP, and they looked beautiful, though none on heavy card stock. Yeah, we'll all be competitors, but hey, I would still hate for anyone to waste money!

Wonder exactly what that involves? This was a frontrunner for me since it best mimics offset printing method from what I understand...

It handles 80 lb cover stock beautifully, but the 100 lb cover stock jams. I have completed 3 small jobs and my ink is half empty. Although is isn't the perfect printer, I still plan to keep it. It only cost $79.99.

I am considering your model and the 8560. It appears that 8560 will have better resolution and therefore might be worth the extra money? I have found that some reviewers feel the ink runs out too quickly and is far more costly per page than Xerox's specs would lead us to believe. What have you found to be true? Unfortunately, there just aren't as many reviews of the 8000series as of the 6000s.

I have decided to outsource my very heavy paper projects/invitations. most items can be printed on 80lb cover (216gsm) and many laser printers say they can take that. The Ricoh has been so heavily suggested that I am thinking of getting that. but in this string of notes, someone said it was terrrible. And that is really too bad! you are right, they just don't understand our needs. I have narrowed it down (for today) to the following... Ricoh 410n (no need for duplex option since it can't do it with the heavier stock) Konica Minolta 5550 Both can take 216gsm. spoke to someone at printershowcase.com and he said that a woman who prints stationery on heavy stock came in and test drove those two and chose the konica over the ricoh. So I am curious, what did you find out? It's been 2 months and I hope you found something. thanks cindy

Hi, I'm wondering if anyone can give me some recommendations for a high quality, reasonably priced color laser printer. I'm starting an invitation and card business and need something to print the cards from. I've spoke with a few other people that have the same business and most print their cards right from their own printer. The two names that keep coming up are Canon and Rikoh but I don't see any reviews here on those two brands. I bought a lexmark black & white laser printer years ago to make cards with so I could run vellum through it and it never fed right, even regular paper would jam or feed 20 sheets threw at a time. Lemark got high reviews here from cnet but not from users so i'm not eager to go with another Lexmark. So what I need is something that prints high quality in both color & black/white for text & graphics...speed is not as important, but feeding is....I do not want to have to stand there and individually feed every sheet. I need something that can handle card stock and vellum, as well as smaller print sizes, 3x5 cards, but it does not have to be larger than 8.5x11 if it does that's a plus. And of course prices is always important. I am using a mac platform, leopard operating system. Thanks for any suggestions Nicole _________________________ HI Nicole! I print cards all the time on my printer and I really like my HP PhotoSmart D7360. I get compliments all the time from my cards. Mu daughters schooled loved their Christmas Cards so much that they asked how I made and I told them about the PhotoSmart. Our Pastor when out and bought one for the church office! I must say, once I showed them how to use and how to print cards, they did a great job! I LOVED my Birthday card they made me! I have used my printer to make the church's shipping labels and to make the Sunday Church Brochure and used it for my husband business also. _____________________ Kara~ New Phaser 8560 Solid Ink technology from Xerox.

I am thinking the Xerox Phaser 8560 is the way to go, but I have a question - does it print full bleed? I do mostly custom size prints, 4.25 x 5.5. Also, what does this compare to, in card stock weight - 60 220 gsm? I saw it goes up to 80 lbs, but is 220 gsm heavier than that? Thanks!!

I'm having problems printing on cardstock that is 80# (216 g/m2). I have a HP color Laserjet 2605dn and I can only print on 80# if I do manual feed or pray...but praying only works 'sometimes'. I can't babysit the thing to make sure it doesn't jam. Does the photosmart do 80# in the regular paper tray or do you have to do manual feed? Is the print quality equivalent to a laserjet? Tried any transparency fades on your graphics? thanks for any additional info you have to ease my concerns!

When printing colour graphics, however, it posted some very slow speeds. The Lexmark Z2420's print quality rose or fell depending on the type of paper. On the plain paper we use, the black ink faded to charcoal and tended to spread on the page, resulting in slightly faded and fuzzy-looking letters. Color photos also appeared faded and grainy. On Lexmark's own photo paper, the same images brightened and showed improved, crisper details. but indeed it is a cheap printer with low maintenance JWP -------------- Cheap Phaser 8560 ink and Xerox 8560 supplies from ConcordSupplies.com.

I love the raised feel to the ink the most. It has lost connectivity by ethernet 2x, but I was able to have it serviced quickly enough and was able to use the USB connection until it was repaired (one time they were able to fix the problem over the phone!). so i recommend this printer for sure

I have read that you must do that or it uses up a lot of ink to power it up. So far, the only negative I have heard is that to leave it on standby it uses about 45 watts.

The waxy images look very &quot;professional&quot; and it's so easy to load the ink that any preschooler who's figured out how to put those shapes through the lid of the box can do it. So far I've run 5 large jobs on it using 80lb cardstock, vellum, labels, and envelopes. Everything goes through easily, though the envelopes do mis-feed occasionally. Things to think about, however: * This printer does not do borderless!!! The print quality is so good that you'll be tempted to want to do full color invites, especially since the ink will not curl the paper...just be prepared to trim off the edges. * It is very loud when running so you think about it's location. * I've been having to do a lot of research about color matching because for browns & pinks, what I see on my screen is NOT what comes out. The blues and greens seem to be fine, though. (Anyone who knows what settings to change are welcome to chime in here!!) I've been working around that with trial and error, but hoping to find the correct settings to get them to match more closely so I don't have to waste paper. Other than that, I am a happy camper. Good luck with your printer searches!!

There are a lot of great things, some bad. Feeds envelopes great, but if you print on stardream envelopes, it will smudge/rub off when mailed. Not sure about regular envelopes. But, it prints stardream cover stock great (105#) from the manual feed tray. as someone noted below, it doesn't print borderless, so you need to trim to do your bleeds. My large papercutter has a peice that holds the paper in place - but the pressure of it will offset the ink from one page to the next. So, I tediously have to put scrap sheets between each one before cutting. ugh! it doesn't always print in the right spot - for instance, I'll put my crop marks at 1&quot; and the design is dead on in illustrator, but will print 1/8&quot; off on the page, which can make this off center when cut. I manually move everything in my artwork before printing. As for color matching, it's great. It has built-in pantone matching - but don't compare to a real pantone book. There is a download from Xerox that you print out - about 20 pages worth. It will print all the different color combos. (when you create your new documents, you need it to be set to RGB, not CMYK...and for the color mgmt to be set to let the printer decide on postscript colors, not illustrator and to use Pantone Solid Coated even though you may be using uncoated paper). I have my pages that I use to choose what colors and it's dead on. Great resource so you don't waste time playing with as many test prints. i now have three printers - the 8560, the 6180 so I can print laser on envelopes and an inkjet. My tiny office looks ridiculous!

With the DN model, will it duplex print on custom size 80# card stock? I print mostly quarter pages. 2. Where did you purchase yours from, and how was customer service, and how quickly did it arrive? I need to get mine ASAP for two large projects I have coming up, and I want to avoid a long wait time, but not at the expense of quality customer service. Thanks!

I've only used the duplexing feature using full letter sized paper for programs, but I just tested it out and it worked fine on smaller sizes. I bought mine at a local Xerox dealer in Massachusetts. If you're in that area, reply and I can tell you where specifically. They were great about customer service so far - he had me meet with the Xerox tech and I spent HOURS (3 separate visits) testing out my actual designs with my papers to see if it would be right for me. they were great. I don't know about support after the fact unless you buy the exteneded warranty, which I have to decide if I want. They stocked it, so I was able to take it home in my car, with no shipping charges. They also sell the ink at the lowest price I've found (same as Xerox) for the genuine ink. I don't want to risk the fake stuff.

I've found just jiggling the paper/envelope against the sensor or pushing down gently on the tray will get it to recognize that it's been loaded. Is that the problem you're having??

It is slightly reduced by using the &quot;normal&quot; setting, but that doesn't give me good ink coverage or photo color. I'm trying to print double-sided on the Stardream card stock. I've tried putting the setting on &quot;2nd side&quot; as well, but no real change. Anyone had this happen?
7074	63	273212	2790999	2787972	ccaputo7	6/11/08 6:37 PM	1.21320942E12	xerox 8560 flaking? jamming?	I have not had the issue of the 2nd side flaking. I just finished a job doing double sided programs - using black only, and mostly text. The problem I ran into was this. After printing 130 sheets double sided of stardream cardstock, it started to jam. It would print the first side fine, and when it pulled it back in, it jammed. I let it cool a bit (was worried i was working it too hard) and then switched to printing on my stardream text stock which was the inner piece. It printed 170 of those double sided no problem but when I went to do the cardstock again, it kept jamming. although since it doesn't print both sides at the same time, it's just as easy to put it through the printer twice... did you get your envelopes to work? was that you?
7074	64	273212	2791262	2790999	czyadgrl	6/12/08 7:10 AM	1.2132546E12	xerox 8560 flaking? jamming?	Hello! More insight to my 2nd side flaking problem - it happens only when there is a photo on one side of the page, and only the photo area flakes. Back-to-back text comes out just fine. I too have noticed the jamming after printing lots of pages of the Stardream cardstock (from the manual feed tray though). In my case, the printer picks up several (!!!) pages at one time and they get stuck part way in. My hunch is that it's the texture of the paper, combined with the power of the feeder r and the manual feed tray pushing itself a little higher as the stack of paper goes down. I also notice it more on some paper colors than others. Another question - getting light shades of yellow seems tricky, as there's always other colors printing with the yellow, even with 100% Y value in my artwork. I tried going the RGB route, but it di d not change the output.

I have the Phaser 8560; HP 3600n & 3700dn & HP Photosmart Pro B8350... I also do invitations, etc. and work with the starstream papers, pearl metallics, 110lb papers, envelopes, everything! The HP 3700 has been the best for the last 4 years but I am always calling for service. Which if youve called HP, is not the easiest to deal with. I thought I would love my Phaser but when I compare my Color LaserJet to my Phaser, the LaserJet wins. The print quality is much better and truer to what I see on my screen. The Phaser ink scratches off even if I happen to get my finger nail on it gently. I am having all the issues everyone else has. On the Phaser, the sensor not reading the paper in the bi-pass tray even though its there; the colors completely don't match what is on the screen no matter how much paper I waste changing the options in techcolor feature. I will say that I use all my bi-pass trays exclusively and the jamming is kept to a minimum. But I still get jams and streaks on most things and I do large volume. Is there anything anyone loves and they have found thus far that really works? I cannot sacrifice the quality of my work or charge clients if I cannot produce a product that I wouldn't use myself! Anyone find anything else out? Noise, speed, cost not much of a factor if I can get what I need to work right...

I have found that on metallic stocks the ink does not adhere to the stock well. You can rub it with a fingernail and it will smear/smudge (after significant drying time) or if you scratch with an x-acto knife tip it will scratch right off. I was very happy with this printer when I first got it, but I can't have ink that will come off. Note that this only happens with the metallics, which about 95% of customers choose! I do like the range of sizes that the multi-purpose try can handle, and the stocks I use go through fine so I am going to look at some other Xerox machines this week. I think the problem is with the solid ink on that stock. I will post if I find something good. I would recommend using the manual feed for all card stocks, as the pass through is straighter than from the tray. I only use the tray for regular office printing on plain paper. Has anyone tried the Ricoh C411?

The only problems I'm having is that the printer takes itself out of powersave mode alot! When in standby/warm up mode it uses a lot of wattage. If I power it off/on again, it uses up a lot of ink. So, the Power Save option is sort of my best option. Anyway, I don't understand why its waking up by itself..its not even connected to a computer when I don't use it!
7074	71	273212	2832438	2832391	czyadgrl	8/12/08 12:32 PM	1.21854432E12	Flaking and Powering Itself On	I have both of these problems! Flakey ink, on certain metallic papers more than others.. And, the waking itself up all the time is really annoying. I'm still not certain this printer is the solution to my invitations. The next step, from what I can see, is a MUCH more expensive printer, as I've had 3 other Xerox's that didn't work out, even up to $1400 range. On top of that, I'm not pleased with the service Xerox provides on the Phasers. You get delegated to &quot;the Phaser department&quot;, which is not open evenings or weekends (which of course, are the only times the printer has problems!). They also take a full day to get their local techs to call and schedule an appointment. So far, the techs out have not solved any problems without creating more. And when you call and get through to the Phaser support people, they run through the simplest and most obvious things that I've usually already done to try and fix the problem myself.

When I bought it they told me to leave it in Power Save mode like you are doing too and sometimes I hear it from the other room just running and then it will go back to &quot;sleep.&quot; I think that saves it from going from completely cold to hot which is why it uses so much of the ink when it goes from power off to on. Do you have your metallics on a certain setting? All the prints come out fine and look great, but it is almost like the ink isn't really completely stuck to the paper. (Like I said this is only on the metallics.) Try this and tell me if yours does this: Print something on the metallic stock and cut through the ink with an X-Acto knife - like you were cutting out an invite with a full bleed. Does the ink kind of ball up on the knife where you cut and you have to wipe it off? Maybe it is just my machine! It is not super noticeable, but not perfection either.

On every kind of paper. The printer handles the paper well and is pretty easy to clear jams but the worst, aside from the flaking is the color match! Anyone else have completely different screen colors than what prints? I've tried EVERYTHING to match it up and did print the Phaser color sampler which I can use if I need one specific color but what about a full graphic?

The waking up is really annoying , but that is how it keeps the ink from getting too solid if you don't use it. I do see the issue with ink scratching off on stardream. If you print and then cut through it, it will flake right off. so, now I don't design with bleeds which kills me! I hate that it dictate how i need to design. I bought the xerox 6180 laser to do envelopes since the solid ink doesn't mail well (smudges off), but stardream doesn't handle too well. The colors separate so you can literally see CMYK as separate pieces. I think ultimately, laser is the way to go cause it doesn't come off, but I haven't found a good one yet with good enough quality or that can handle envelopes (tried an OKI and sent it back). on another topic, anyone found a good paper cutter? I am constantly realigning mine and it still cuts crooked! so if i'm lucky enough to get a good print job, half the time it gets messed up by the darm cutter. ahhhh! if only the printers and cutters would cooperate!

I have to manually cut with scissors and be really careful when I cut things printed from my Phaser. I like how the text feels like it's thermography (a little raised) but the whole flaking and peeling off is so annoying!

I know you'd think CYMK, but do RGB (I'm using illustrator & in design). Second, don't go by your screen - that is extremely tough unless you calibrate well. Instead, print out the Pantone Spot color chart from Xerox on the solid ink printer (link at bottom) Before you start designing, pick your colors from here and they will match. I use my charts all the time. You need to use Pantone Solid Coated swatches (even on uncoated papers!). Lastly, you must choose in the print dialog box, under Color Mgmt, Color Handling, &quot;let postscript printer determine colors&quot; http://www.support.xerox.com/go/getfile.asp?Xlang=en_US&XCntry=USA&objid=62164&EULA=0&prodID=8560&Family=Phaser&ripId=&langs=English%20 (US)&plats=Windows%20XP&Xtype=download&uType= now i've given away all my secrets

I am floating between that and the Ricoh C400 Series - either the 411 or 420. The Ricoh is supposed to have better print quality, 1200x1200 res, but the smallest size is 2.8 x 5.8 and I need smallest size to be 3x5...Has anyone tried either of those printers or the Phaser 6360? Wouldn't it be great if they started making mini digital presses???

I just got this printer and everything I've printed so far was either hot pink, brown, or black text (wedding invitations). Hardly any graphics. I'll test more next week and post. thanks, y

Even some of the lower end laser printers rubbed off on the metallic card stocks. I found the more expensive the machine, the toner did not come off. Unfortunately, running a small home-based studio like most of us do, the size/expense of these larger machines just won't work. I have one dealer looking into the Phaser 6360 as of now, I'll let you know if that one works. I demoed the Xerox Work Centre 7328 and the Docu-Color 242 (which is amazing, but also the price of a mid-size car)...The 7328 is a good lease option or maybe to get a refurbished machine. It handled the card stock very well and had settings that handled textured stocks as well. I do like Xerox because they easily take small sizes which is a must for invitation design. Anyways I am keeping my fingers crossed for the 6360...

I've actually had a really hard time getting a good &quot;hot pink&quot; so it's interesting that most of your jobs have been in that color. You didn't change any of the color settings? I can't even get it to match it's own Pantone chart! (and those weren't that great to begin with...)

I run an &quot;eco-friendly&quot; invite business, though, so most of my work is done on recycled stock. I find it's GREAT for that and even when I use the pressure guide on a paper cutter, it doesn't flake off of that. I have also had no trouble with jamming any cardstock, up to 100lb (recycled, though, not Stardream). It does misfeed envelopes occasionally, but if you load just 10 at a time, it's completely fine. Color matching, however is a BIG problem. by downloading the PS driver instead of the one they recommended for Vista, I was able to get some options under the &quot;properites&quot; section that help, but it doesn't keep the settings from one job to the next so I still find myself fiddling with the settings and running test prints. Particularly with pinks and browns, I've had a very difficult time with color and I'm not in a position to try another printer just yet. Any suggestions?

Plain paper output is nice - fast too (although the mechanism makes a lot of clunks, etc. Seems like there's a lot going on under the hood). Can I get photo quality output? I use a Epson R800 but I'm sick and tired of clogged inkjet heads... I made a test print of a photo onto plain paper - it obviously wasn't as good as an EPSON print that was made on photo glossy paper stock. Does Xerox make or recommend a photo paper stock for the 8560? Thanks! -j

We also called to see what they used because we just got their Stardream Christmas samples. They must have switched printers again. They are now using the Ricoh 811 and I have to say they are gorgeous. They printed a photograph on Stardream and it is perfect. We are also in the market for a laser that will work on Stardream. As far as the Epson, we have the R1900 and I just recently had to have ours replaced (it was 3 months old, already having the same feeding problems the R1800 was having). We don't run Stardream through it because it is so hard on printers. We currently use an Oki c5200 and have to replace the fuser every 6 months cause the paper chews it up. Epson recommends one of their Pro Imaging 3800. Supposedly made of sturdier stuff. Anyway, I think we will end up with the Ricoh just because of the samples we have seen. Hope this helps someone.

Although, I haven't noticed any comments about HP Color Laser Printers. Does anyone love their HP Color Lasers that they would recommend? I'm in the market again after owning my HP2550L for the past 4 years. I'd like to upgrade. Here's what I need my perfect printer to do: 1. Print on Stardream papers (110# +) 2. Feed 3x5 size as well as 8.5x11 3. No smearing. Is color laser better than inkjet? I don't think I'm asking for much, but I'm having a heck of a time finding My Perfect Printer. PS Stupid question: Is the Xerox 8560 inkjet? Solid Ink technology confused me. Thanks!

Solid ink is a new separate class of printer. The ink is small solid blocks (about 1.5&quot; square), kind of like crayon material. The printer melts it and so it is always on keeping the ink warm. The ink sits on top of the paper (doesn't get absorbed like inkjet can). So, it almost feels like thermography (not quite as high, but you can feel the text when you run your hand over it). But as you can see from this post, most of us are running into some issues with scratching & flaking on stardream and other papers. it is crazy that there isn't a reasonably priced printed that we can use. the search goes on. The ricoh 811 seemed a bit high priced for me right now, maybe down the road or maybe leasing is an option.

I had one for a brief period of time and the quality of the printout and the color isn't quite up to par. You want to make sure to look for a printer with a straight pass through as well, so that you don't end up curling your card stocks. I have the 8560 now and on any metallic media the ink just scratches off, so until they perfect that type of ink, I would stick with the laser. I am getting a 6360 to try out next week. I will post a review. Good luck on your search!

I got really confused and now I'm worse off than I was before. Here's what I need... I'm in the process of starting my own stationary business and have just bought a ton of software, etc., so I'm looking for a good, though not super expensive printer to get me started. I'm not opposed to starting small and maybe getting a second larger printer after I see how the business is going. So far, my best friend is my only client. Can somebody point me to a good starter printer? I'm using Illustrator/Photoshop on a Mac if that has anything to do with the choice. I know so little about printers, it's amazing that I know how to use the one I have. Thanks!

I would suggest though, that if you have already invested in a lot of new software and you only have 1 client, you might want to outsource your printing until you have more volume. Just a suggestion. I am going to do a review once I have tested out the Phaser 6360. I think the Ricoh 811 is supposed to be the best one, but that is a very expensive printer. I think we all agree that you definitely need color laser for the metallic stocks, and one with the straight pass through tray that can also handle a big range of sizes...(3x5 to letter). And though many people are rooting for the solid ink printers, it definitely does not adhere to the metallic stocks which is a quality issue that I don't want to deal with. Hopefully we'll have some positive reviews on here soon! Good luck with your business.

It's $399 plus $100 rebate.

Paper stocks soak up the ink and can also change the ink's color tone depending on the color of paper you are printing to. They also can bleed or spiderweb your print on the paper. This is most commonly true of metallic paper stock or any with a rough coated texture. A laser would be a better option if you choose to print them yourself. However, lasers are not all made to really handle cardstock in heavy volumes, and can bend or curl the card stock due to the way they bend through the machine. They can also have ink adhesion issues (ink rubbing off paper/card stock) and feeding problems. Unless you are able to invest a significant amount of money, there does not appear to be a &quot;desktop&quot; color laser with the same quality of output as the larger printing companies using printing presses and digital presses. It may be fine if you are doing business for friends and family - but be forewarned - you may run into large quality control issues, frustrating feeding issues and/or time and expenses (supplies, etc.) that won't make it worth your efforts. I hope that helps!

Hi All, I bought my phaser 8560DN at Costco when they had a sale back in June. Anyway, this week is the last week I can return the printer and I finally noticed the flaking that people are talking about. I noticed it on Bazzill Bling textured paper. When I made wedding invitations I was using a pearlescent metallic paper that it printed beautifully on. I also noticed that when I selected transparency a warning message pops up stating that I should only use Xerox brand and any other brand might damage the printer? Has anyone tried other transparencies? How about printing pictures on glossy? Are the pics decent? Lastly, is anyone returning their Phaser? Unfortunately, this printer was priced at already the max that I was willing to pay right now. So, I probably won't be replacing it anytime soon if I return it.

It is VERY large, it is loud, and the paper path is in no way straight through. It actually goes in an upward direction and does curl the card stock. The quality of text and graphics is no comparison to the 8560. The 6360 text looks grainy and large areas of solid color have a line pattern through them. I am torn as I love the 8560's printout, but since it doesn't adhere to the metallic stock very well, I certainly can't use that for final product pieces. Anyways, the 6360 is going back next week. (Good thing because it is pretty expensive...) However note that the 6360 is a great printer for a small to medium size office with a number of employees, it is just not what we all need for an invitation business. I guess we'll keep looking...

The worst problem, and the reason we are returning the unit, is that the color match is not even close. I have spent considerable time and countless wasted copies with tech support trying to resolve this issue. They thought that the ink amy be bad and had me run hundreds of copies through the machine to make sure that all the ink was used before putting in new ink blocks. That did not work. It is worse when going direct from computer than from the glass. Xerox installed this copier free of charge and &quot;just&quot; charges us for meter clicks. As it takes about 10 copies to get a job running if it runs at all, this is a very costly &quot;free&quot; copier. I don't understand their marketing strategy here as we will be replacing it with a copier purchased in the normal way, but it certainly won't be Xerox,

Unless there are some settings that aren't input correctly, I really don't see how what they are saying could be true. Ask to speak to people higher in the chain on the phone and see if you get a different response. Also try calling a local Oki dealer and technician who might be able to help more.
