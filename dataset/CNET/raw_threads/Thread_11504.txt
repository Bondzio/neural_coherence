I'll share one possible fix and not dive into driver discussions until you tell more. -&gt; Look up WINSOCKXPFIX on google.com to repair the usual spyware induced damaged networking that causes a lot of posts like yours. Cheers, Bob

I am sure this is a software problem. But I verified with spybot, microsoft anti spyware and some other anti spy ware as well. I am currently testing WinSock XP Fix. Could a device can be unrecognize due to this kind of a bug? I will post again if that won't solve the problem. Thank you Assaf OS: Windows XP Service pack 2

They expected that XP would find all the drivers. Sadly we have to check with the laptop maker for BIOS udpates, motherboard drivers and maybe patches. Windows Update and the mysterious Driver Update button will not do this for us. My bet is the OS install is incomplete. As to WINSOCKXPFIX, yes, the spyware/malware is causing such damage. Bob

Download the latest driver from Linksys.com, it will be in a &quot;zipped&quot; (compressed) folder. After extracting the uncompressed folder, just run the &quot;Setup.exe&quot; file. If you have other versions of the Linksys wireless utility software, it will instruct you to remove that program first. If this does not fix your problem, then you can try Windows Repair problem. The problem with Windows is that it sometimes installs a bad driver, if you allow it.
