is fine for 90% of all computing.
you need to go to the emachine web site and look for updated drivers for your integrated video.
if so all you need is for the updates to handle more resolution.
if none are there, a new video card will work.
it will plug into the pci or agp slot on the motherboard.
all you do is move the monitor cable from the video port on the motherboard to the video port on the card.
you will need to go into the bios and disable the &quot;on board&quot; video for the motherboard.
then install the drivers for the video card.
most mid-level graphics cards will fit 90% of all motherboards.
but you'll need to do a little research here.
go to a good pc store and find a salesperson.
tell them what you have and what you want to do.
i just bought one for my other home built and paid about 60 bucks for a nice card with 256 meg of video ram.
more than adequate for my needs.
