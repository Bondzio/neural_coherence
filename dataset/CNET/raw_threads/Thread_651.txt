External HDD: TrekStor maxi. mu - 500 GB - purchased from Future Shop on Boxing Day 2007. Never given me any problems before this. My laptop: Windows Vista SP1 64-bit. purchased 1 year ago. A few weeks ago, the drive was not even recognized by the computer when I plugged it in. Now, the letter shows up in 'My Computer', but when I click it, I get the message: &quot;Please insert a disk into Removable Disk (F:).&quot; I cannot get it to work even after several tries. What is there that I can do to get it to work and access my files? I need to fix this quick because I am home for christmas vacation and I need to backup my computer files before sending in into the HP Service Depot. I need to send the laptop in before returning to school in January! Prompt guidance would really be appreciated. More: I did open the enclosure to see if any connections were lose inside, but having never built my own drive, I can't seem to figure it out! Everything seems to be in place, and inside, it turns out that it's a Western Digital WD5000AAVS, Caviar SE (I was happy to see this). I can't hear it work either...are there any HDD troubleshooting programs that can help me run tests on the drive to see what's wrong? Please help!!

The only issue may be the drive warranty which may be voided if you choose those options. The choice is yours. VAPCMD
