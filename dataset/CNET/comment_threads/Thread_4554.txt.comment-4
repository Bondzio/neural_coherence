I'm running into a gluttony of drivers which make me happy I've been installing Windows since Windows 1.0.
Only Microsoft seems to not get it that drivers are too hard for anyone that didn't use DOS.
If the audio driver installs but doesn't work, hurt down the UAA from Microsoft (it's in a KB somewhere) install that, uninstall the audio driver, reboot and if it's like other machines it just works.
No one wants to claim rights to why it's getting so hard for drivers today.
