I have an ASUS mb with a Promise PCI RAID controller connected to two WD1200 using RAID 1.
The BIOS on the RAID controller is FastTrack TX2000.
When I use a Windows XP setup CD to boot, it loads a bunch of drivers and invites me to install Windows XP.
Then it says that it can't find a hard drive and invites me to reboot.
What should I try?
