I ordered a pc from IBuyPower on June 16th, 2006. Since I received it I've had nothing but problems. What really ticks me off is that I paid extra for one of those LCD Temperature display devices, and all they did was screw it in the bay slot and plug it into the power supply, but DID NOT install the sensor wires where there supposed to go, so therefore it was telling me the PCU, Hard Drive and System temp were all 20 degrees celcius. I called and asked about it and they tried to tell me it's only supposed to monitor the case. That's when i decided to unscrew it from the bay slot and saw for myself right behind the lcd plate that all the sensor wires were still all tied and bundled together untouched. They also did not include any manuals other than my motherboard manuel so I couldn't even do it myself til I found the online manual after searching forever. I ordered a cold cathode tube blue neon light that comes with 2 in the kit and they only put in 1 and they kept the other one and my case only lit up from the bottom and it was all dark from the middle to the top of the inside of the case. The 1st pci express slot wasn't reading my 7950 gx2 video card on a p5n32-sli deluxe motherboard because they failed to update the bios and they shipped it without the video card able to work with drivers so i had to send it back to them only because the 2nd pci express slot worked but not the 1st so I thought it was defective and not the bios liek they said it was but I still dont believe them when they said it was the bios. I had to ship it back to them and i when i got it back the video card worked but then the pc kept shutting down every so often for no reason, it was liek i unplugged it from the wall when i didn't. Lets see what else.....their customer service is really bad. Probably the worst customer service I have ever had. They were rude, they didn't build my pc as if it was their own. It was done halfa$$ and they pocketed about $8-$900 of my money as their own profit for building it. I know this because I just sent it back and I'm building a similar pc with all the same parts coming from newegg and the total is about $900 less. These guys do not deserve $900 of my money when they do not even hook up the sensor wires to my processor for the temperature device. I've called them literally 27 times in a timeframe of 4 weeks about problems and normal ?'s about the pc since I had no manuals I had no choice but to bug em about things. I talked to a couple nice techs but overall my confidence in my IBUYPOWER pc was never 100%. I never felt certain after calling them about problems and they always try to hurry up the call, it always feels liek their tempted to hang up on you if you ask another question. Oh yea almost forgot, I called and asked if they received my pc yet when i had to send it back and they told me it would take a half hour to look up the tracking number, then he was like..huuuuh(sighing like), hang on, he came back 4 min later to tell me the status of tracking from fed ex. NOW I just sent my pc back to them yesterday for a refund and they ARE charging me shipping. They snuck in an extra $49 for rush shipping when they had me believe the $85 charge for shipping was it but it was $85 +another $49 for rush shipping when they had me believe the $85 included rush delivery or else i wouldnt have asked for RUSH service. AND now another $43 to send it back, THAT'S $177 in shipping fees all for NOTHING!..they could at least have paid my $43 ground shipping for when i returned it yesterday on 7-17-2006. I also noticed, if you goto www.ibuypower.com and read their customer testimonials, you can't even add a new review yurself on their site they disabled it...hmm I WONDER WHY, but if you read a lot of their customer testimonials, yull simply be able to tell their own employees submitted all those positive reviews. I'm so upset $177 down the drain for shipping fees and I'm stuck with nothing til I finally get my refund which will be far less than what I actually paid for. Once I get that refund I'm ordering my saved cart from newegg =) god knows how long they will take to refund it. They absolutely do not care about their customers. These guys are prolly shipping out 50 pc's a day, pocketing an average of $600 per pc for their own profit and simply do not deserve it. If i had money to start my own company, I'd build all my customers pc's as if it were my own. I deserve a pc company more than these guys do. I AM FURIOUS as now the date is 7-18-06...32 days later and I'm out $177 with no pc. Nvidia recommends them on their site which is what got my attention, NVIDIA should remove their link if they want to save their reputation. Guys there's even more things that were wrong but this review has gone long enough and I need to goto work =P hope this helped, i really truly hope my comment makes an strong impact on you crazy pc lovers out there when it comes to purchasing a new pc. STAY AWAY FROM IBUYPOWER....IBUYPOOP

Dealing with your company has been a nightmare. so, we are going to have to take you up on your 30 day money back gaurantee as stated below . my pc is already being shipped back to you with the RMA all over the box. i still have the discs here but i will ship that back as well and will gladly cover the cost(of discs). we basically just want this nightmare over with and expect the money to be credited ASAP. my partner will send his customer number and invoice number shortly. we both ordered with the same company credit card. and before you answer me back with questions like; did you contact cust service? or..what about technical support? the answer is YES, on MULTIPLE occasions. &quot;iBUYPOWER provides a 30-Day Money Back Guarantee (not includes shipping, handling and rush service fees) and the following limited warranty.

Good prices, but not if they sell garbage. cyberpowerpc.com has a very similar interface and look. Are they the same company, or is this just the way several online computer companies look? Also, does anyone know what's the deal with &quot;professional wiring&quot; costing extra? If you don't pay do they let their preschooler wire your box???

They just said they'll give the refund which is $177 less than what i paid since shipping fees totaled up to that amount and they didn't have to if they just built the computer the way it's supposed to be built. Now I, the customer, have to pay extra for their mistakes. They just received it today according to the fed ex tracking site but I don't expect to see a credit on my credit card til I've completely waited myself to death. =/

Be warned, some of there systems are starting to show up in best buy. Other good companies or at least ones with good ratings, include Pugent,and Vigor. Pugent really deals with regular or advanced mods for systems. They also have comments on different system configs. Whatever you decide company wise, make sure you get acronis backup software.

I say &quot;attempted&quot; because I decided to cancel this order given the amount of trouble they had caused me before I was even technically their customer. First, it only took a few days for the money to be withdrawn from my account (they had no problems TAKING my money, only a problem with giving me what I paid for), but it took a week for someone to contact me and tell me that there was a problem with my order. Pauline Khuu from the sales department contacted me and told me that my shipping address was not verified and they could not ship my computer until I &quot;added [my] shipping address to [my] bank account&quot;. She stated that they verify the shipping address to &quot;prevent fraud&quot;... however, I fail to see how waiting until AFTER they collect the payment to verify the shipping address prevents fraud. It only protects THEM from fraud, while causing problems for the customer. Wouldn't common sense tell you to verify the addresses BEFORE taking a payment if you truly cared about your customers? Regardless, I called my bank and they had no idea what I was talking about when I asked to add my shipping address to the account, and they told me that the shipping address that I had given IBUYPOWER was the correct address that they had on-file for me and that they had no record of anyone calling to verify this address. I asked Pauline if they were calling the right bank and discovered that they were not, so I gave her the correct phone number for my bank. She called me back an hour later, Pauline: &quot;The bank will not verify any of your information for us unless you are on the line.&quot; Me: &quot;Great, so get them on the line&quot; Pauline: &quot;We don't have three-way calling. Do you have three-way calling that we can use?&quot; Not exactly what I would expect from a reputable company, but I would have complied if I had the capability. Unfortunately I did not so I asked what other options we had. The only other option was to fax or e-mail a copy of my photo ID, credit card, and a &quot;credit authorization form&quot; to them (which sounds a bit fishy to me since they already HAVE my payment. Why do they need a form authorizing credit when they have already had the funds for a week?). And, since I am an American working in Baghdad, I don't have access to a scanner or fax maching anyway, so this option was impossible... I told her that I should cancel my order then since there is no quick way to resolve this issue and I would only have a small window in September where I would be in the States and able to take delivery of the computer (and this shipping address issue meant they hadn't even BEGUN assembling my computer). She told me that it would be 5-7 business days before the funds would be put back into my account... So, at this point, I got very angry since they had deided to hold onto almost $2,000 of my money for two weeks and gave me absolutely nothing in return. To which Pauline got very defensive and started telling me about how this whole situation was actualy MY fault and insinuated that I hadn't read the fine print on the website (which I DID). I fail to see how any of this is my fault, but regardless, I don't know of any company that would go blaming their customers for a foul up, even if it IS the customer's fault. That's just not good business. Then, Pauline engaged in a full-blown argument with me and began yelling about how this wasn't the first time she had tried to contact me, and that she had actually tried to contact me several times the previous week... which was a BOLD-FACED LIE -- the phone # I gave them was to my Skype phone, and other than my wife, they are the only ones who knew of that number... so unless she and my wife shared the same name, this was the first time she had EVER tried to call me. Pauline said that she will &quot;do her best&quot; to get me my money back &quot;as quickly as possible&quot; - which I'm sure is code for &quot;whenever I get around to it&quot; -- This was yesterday the 28th, it's currently the 29th and my order is still listed on the website as &quot;Processing&quot;......... NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.

15084	13	191927	5367108	2076506	VXtech	9/28/12 1:20 PM	1.3488384E12	I so agree!!!	I had nothing but problems with my system from them right from the start and I still do even after getting it &quot;fixed&quot; by them 4 times...Now I will have to spend more money on top the 1800.- I spend on the PC form them and the return shipping charges you have to pay!...I will never buy form them again, that's for sure...
