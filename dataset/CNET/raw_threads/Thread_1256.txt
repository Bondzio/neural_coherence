Just by living in the Navy base.. you will subject to all their regulations, and one of them .. maybe .. a limited access to internet... Others, might include interference from Navy activity or devices.. So, maybe those people who says, its always down or slow, etc.. they might be right...

Meaning it sends out information in multiple packets over time rather than sending a constant signal. So you (Wireless User) are Johnny P's (ISP) dad. You're out playing footbal with him and you tell him to pass the ball. He's got a poor arm (bad signal) and can't always reach you with his passes. Either little Johnny P has got to get a better arm, or you have to move to a better location to get his passes (recieve). Now, you could invest in a better antenna, but it's as simple as adding tinfoil to your computer. 802.11 protocol uses the 2.4Ghz bandwitdh which is very populated by other things besides wireless. Read the FCC statment on yuor wireless card... it will explain this too. I would suggest trying to get a more advanced card. What can you do with out spending money? Trying positioning yourself higher. The higher you are the more chances you have of recieveing the signal.
