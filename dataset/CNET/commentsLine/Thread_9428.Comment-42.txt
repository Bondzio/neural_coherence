my friend bought a computer when 600mhz was the fastest cpu you could get.
apart from one of his two 9gb hdds dying, the only other thing that has failed is a modem that got fried during lightning.
his family is still using the computer happily for homework and surfing the internet.
i myself bought a second hand 486 pc for my business and used it untill three years ago, because i found it too hard to find compatible ink ribbon to the epson printer and newer printers didn't have backwards compatible drivers.
i still sometimes boot up the old pc to play old dos games: i prefer old games because the gameplay is king and not the pretty graphics.
the 486, which was made sometime in early to mid mineties, is still working as perfectly as the day it was bought.
my point is that there is no reason to panic, as long as you have backed up all the important files and have the necessary disks to re-install software - a habit you should adopt regardless of the age of your computer.
if something does fail, it is not usually all of the components at once but you are quite justified to upgrade at least the failed component and anything that is closely dependent on it.
the rest is up to your desire and the size of your wallet.
