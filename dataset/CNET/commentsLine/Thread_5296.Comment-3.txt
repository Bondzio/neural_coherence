integrated graphics cards are not for gamers.
they will only handle the basic gui of windows.
they will be able to play games, though older ones that aren't as graphically intensive as new games.
if you do want to play new, modern games (from 2007 onwards) you will need to buy a graphics card.
most, if not all of them go into the pci slot on your motherboard and handle all graphics on the computer.
think of having two hands.
two hands can type a document on a computer with ease.
if you tell those two hands to type on a computer and draw a picture, it will be able to do both, but much slower and with sub-par results.
think of getting a graphics card as getting an extra five pairs of hands.
the two original ones will still be typing a document, but the ten extra ones can be drawing you a magnificent picture.
