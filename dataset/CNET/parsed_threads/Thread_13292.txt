<s> you are saying your computer has integrated video but you want a graphics card. </s>
<s> Your integrated video uses &quot;shared&quot; RAM which means memory on the motherboard. </s>
<s> If you put a dedicated video card in your PC, it will have it's own RAM and will not share memory from the motherboard. </s>
<s> This means it doesn't matter what kind of RAM is on the video card you buy. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> so you'll have to live with this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131082 not very fast but still a lot better then what you have now </s>
<s> but it is possible the upgradation in compaq? </s>
<s> ?because i heard that in compaq the chances are very less..and i want to ad it 512mb graphic card.my ram type is ddr only so in graphic card i needed same ddr or 2 and 3? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I will not write more about how the video card's ram is on it's own card and system so it can be DDR, SDRAM, DDR2, 3 or other. </s>

<s> * Three PCI * No AGP slot 4. </s>
<s> With the limited PSU (see google) I might try this card: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SP94GT512D2LHPP 5. </s>
<s> It's up to you to check for clearances since it has a big heat sink. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> I bet this machine may need the cover left off to avoid overheating with this. </s>
