unless specified by the motherboard manufacturer, install chips from the smallest size to the largest size.
picture it this way, would you rathaer place a waterhose with a 2&quot; output into another hose with a 1&quot; output or the other way around?
if the larger module is installed first and then you have to begin using the smaller ones then the larger one has to unload its supply into smaller &quot;waterhoses&quot; it's best to do it the other way.
