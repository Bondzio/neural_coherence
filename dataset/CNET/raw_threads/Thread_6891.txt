( Every computer set up for wireless on our secured network must submit the computers MAC address to my fiance.) We purchased a Playstation 2 and wanted the children to play in their room so we also purchased a Linksys wireless G gaming adapter. Only problem is the game will not work unless it is on the first floor with the network direct connect. Please help!!!!!!We also run Windows XP professional edition. Thanks in advance for any help.

If your router does not have this feature then you could buy one. Besides that your out of luck as far I I can see. Sorry:(
