hi skip i tried updating win sp2, but it could not be updated.
not sure what is the problem preventing it.
next, i proceed to resetting the cmos, following the instruction stated on the mainboard's installation guidebook.
after this, the problem still persists.
do you have any idea what these 2 messages mean?
1. page_fault_in_nonpaged_area 2. irql_not_less_or_equal these appear on the blue screen how do i check if the processor is overheating?
thanks.
