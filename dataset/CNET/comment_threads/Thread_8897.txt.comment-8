Through hold components like capacitors and ferrite beads or coils.
What I do is reflow the solder on the bigger through hole parts.
Keep a keen eye for scorch marks, blown parts, etc.
That is &quot;the usual&quot; defects.
There is no &quot;do this&quot; in such expeditions or repairs.
If it was then repairs would be cheap.
