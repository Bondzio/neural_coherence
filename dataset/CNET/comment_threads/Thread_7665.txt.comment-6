Don't & I mean DO NOT buy a MacBook Pro if you can until MacWorld 2007.
The reason for this is that from August to October Macs are updated as are iPods.
In January MacWorld is all about consumer products and so there's another shot at MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo.
As it stands, the MacBook Pro is too close to the MacBook spec-wise and it WILL get the Merom very soon.
Wait if you can, otherwise I'd save some money & get a MacBook.
If you really need it, get the MacBook Pro but don't look back.
Udayan.
