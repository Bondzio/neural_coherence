Hi there, I've just installed a new WD 500GB SATA HDD in my computer.
What I would like to know is if and how I can transfer my system (XP Pro) from my ancient 13GB ATA C: drive onto the new fast, larger drive so I can use the SATA drive as my C: drive without having to reinstall XP and loosing all my settings and associations.
Thanks, Calamity
