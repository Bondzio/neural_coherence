Thanks for your advice; I already have the video card, bought from Dell for a great price.
I just started building around that...As far as the ram I understand what your saying but I dont plan on cranking up the ram, just tweaking it.
Forum users have been having great results with the crucial value and for $100 a stick thats a great deal, trying to keep build under $1500.
Im still thinking of scrapping the raptors like you said but still want the raid 0 for speed reasons.i changed the psu to a SP500 by Antec...thanks for your input
