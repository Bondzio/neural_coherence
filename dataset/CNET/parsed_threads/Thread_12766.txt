<s> XP Home, SP 2, Gateway notebook with built in wireless. </s>
<s> Home network, let's call it SM. </s>
<s> Verizon wireless DSL router, with three computers hooked into SM. </s>
<s> One is a Dell, no problem there, the other is Ethernet connected (Vista Home Premium), and the Gateway (XP Home SP2) seems to be constantly losing the wireless signal to a signal named BL. </s>
<s> This BL signal apparently is overbearing and overpowering the Gateway. </s>
<s> I had made our little home network, called SM, a WEP security system and changed the radio frequency to 11. </s>
<s> But this BL's signal still interferes with Gateway. </s>
<s> Any simple solutions suggested? </s>
<s> Would another frequency help? </s>
<s> If yes, which frequency?? </s>
<s> since we went to channel 11 to get away from this problem a few months ago with another interfering signal. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Robert </s>
<s> Change channels again and WEP is dead. </s>
<s> We tell why in our forum sticky. </s>
<s> Sorry but I gotta run and wanted you to have something to work with. </s>
<s> OOPs, I meant that we use WPA-PSK as a security feature for wireless. </s>
<s> What that being understood, what next to make sure we do not get interference from BL? </s>
<s> Thanks, R </s>
<s> Changed to channel 6 from 11. </s>
<s> Let's see what happens, Thanks, R </s>
