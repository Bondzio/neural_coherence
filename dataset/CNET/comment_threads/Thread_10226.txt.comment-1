Hi, i just recently bought a cpu cooler ( Hyper 612 PWM) Once i installed it and ran some tests i was getting between 30-35C on idle but when i started running some games, skyrim Bf3, it started to go to 90C which is abit worrying for me.
I was using real temp to get my stat's I have put the Intel stock cooler back onto the cpu and im getting 30C on idle and 50C while playing those speicific games (skyrim and Bf3) Im not sure what to do and what is wrong i paid 60 dollers for this thing so i had better expectations of it ...
