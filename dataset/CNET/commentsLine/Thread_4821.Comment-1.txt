i'm trying to help out a school with an lcd projector issue.
this is a canon model vt695.
the lamp was becoming dim and eventually died.
we've tried replacing the lamp but no go.
we tried another lamp from (what we thought) was a known good spare projector but still no go.
what i am finding is that, when using an ohmmeter, i show no conductivity between any of the three connections even though the lamp is brand new out of the box.
because we've tried two lamps, i'm not convinced it's a bulb issue but i don't know how these things work.
i am wondering if the ohmmeter check is not valid with these as perhaps they have some other way excite the gas in the bulb and do no use a filament.
anyone know this?
