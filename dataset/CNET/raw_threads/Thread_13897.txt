I installed a new power supply today -- and watched the cpu temp climb from 97.7 to 122F in one minute while the computer was idle. CPU fan is working and was rated for this cpu. I would really prefer to have this computer to work without a babysitter. Thanks for the great ideas, but what to do now? The new power supply seems more robust than the old one so that's something at least....

11001	2	94651	1071724	1071615	ozos	3/25/05 2:49 PM	1.11176214E12	um...this is a radical idea	why not upgrade the CPU cooler? most are rated to a certain point, but end up running the CPU at high temps can you give us temp readings in C also, in F it really doesn't help i'd suggest the Thermalright SI-97 and a 92MM Panaflo High Speed (i bought the U. High Speed, because it was the same cost but the noise is a bit louder) i'd also consider the motherboard as the source of the problem the PSU doesn't affect temps you need better cooling i'd suggest this: http://www.sidewindercomputers.com/thsiforamdat.html and either the Panaflo 92MM High Speed or 92MM Ultra High Speed (Their the same price last i checked, so it's really how much noise u wanna deal with) http://www.sidewindercomputers.com/arcemosi.html also get that yeah, it's a lot of TIM more than you'll probably ever use but the price is good, and you NEED A TIM don't not get it GET THAT the SI-97 comes w/o a thermal pad as for a motherboard http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-170-113&depa=1 that should work great

The edge of the Ziff socket is slightly higher than the CPU chip surface. The AMD Fan/Heatsink combo has a indented cut edge that allows the surface of the heatsink to touch the CPU surface. If you reverse this heatsink, then the surfaces do not mate. I have seen a half dozen motherboards that had the heatsink reversed and powered down because of inadequate cooling.(The CPU Heat Diode worked). Reversing the heatsink so that the cut edge fits over the Ziff socket raised edge solved the problem in every case. Also you cannot use a Pentium Fan/heatsink on an AMD because it has no cut edge.

After reading your advice I went down to the computer store and bought the biggest monster fan with heatsink that would fit. It looks like there is a jet engine on it! But after I installed it -- I had new problems. The computer now powers on but does not boot. Everything lights up, it makes happy noises but nothing -- no beeps, no video, nothing. I changed out video card, reset the mobo, checked the fitting on everything -- I even disconnected the extra drives thinking that maybe this new heatsink uses too much power. Nothing changes. The new fan has 2 plugs, one that goes to the mobo and another 4 pin that I plugged in to power it. It does light up and spin. I have not tried reinstalling the old fan yet -- working with those stupid clips makes me crazy. I will tackle that tomorrow. I will be ordering a new mobo on Monday. I think by the time I'm done I will have bought enough parts for 2 computers....

I'm very careful to check now. I hate those stupid clips -- they have got to come up with a better method. Thanks for the input.
