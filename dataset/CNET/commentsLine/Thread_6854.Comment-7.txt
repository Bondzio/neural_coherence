it has nothing to do with the wifi .
i was just saying that two laptops connect via my router using wifi.
2 computers(wired) and 2 laptops(wireless) connect perfectly to the router but the 3rd computer that is wired just keeps disconnecting, but the network connections in vista just says it is connected.
