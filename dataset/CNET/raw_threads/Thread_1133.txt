I just accidentally dropped my Macbook (120 GB Hard drive, 2GB RAM, 2.16 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, Running Mac OS X 10.4) around 20-25 CM onto my desk, with the left side tilting while it was dropped. Is there likely any major damage or minor damage? CD Drive? RAM? Hard drive?

All Macbooks are equipped with a &quot;Sudden Motion Sensor&quot; which instantly parks the heads of the HD when it detects accelerated movement, sudden changes in position or intense vibration. Hopefully you will be ok but check that everything is working correctly. P

If you dont, oh well. But it was only a foot so i dont think anything happened.

It was in the &quot;off&quot; condition when I dropped it because I took it out of the case and held it with one hand and then it dropped... Then it turned on (I don't know why, don't ask me) and then it turned off again... No, I don't have Apple Care but the warranty that comes with the Macbook is still active... No visual damage, thank goodness...
