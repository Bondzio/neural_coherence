i bought and installed a belkin 802.11g router in january and i still get dead spots in my 1600 square foot apartment.
i think i need a range extender or expander, but those seem to cost more than the router i purchased a few months ago.
plus they all seem to have difficulty with the set up and being a novice, i dont think i could get it to work.
any easier solutions, or are there expanders that are fairly simple to set up and use?
or get a newer - better router?
thanks in advance.
