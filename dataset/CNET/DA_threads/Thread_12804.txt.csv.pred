1.1.1	i have a juniper netscreen 5gt firewall device and i have public ip pools from different subnet.	St
1.1.2	One ip i had configure in the untrust mode and now i want to use seceond ip pool for whole netwrok so that my public ip changed.	St
1.1.3	please help me how can i do this..............	Ques
1.2.1	You may not DMZ the entire network.	St
1.2.2	That's a simple no.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Dear sir, actually i want to change my public ip because i have still 6 ip pending.	St
1.4.1	But you know where that IP comes from so why not ask them for another?	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	actually sir i have two ip pools and i want to change my public ip at regular basis like suppose i want a ip for one week then another ip for another week and so on and i don't want to change my untrust mode ip because i am unable to find default gateway ip field in juniper netscreen 5gt so i want to nat my whole network to another ip without changing my untrust port ip	St
1.6.1	I don't think I can help you.	St
1.6.2	It appears there is more information or a bigger question than you lead with.	St
1.6.3	It's pretty clear that you can't DMZ an entire network.	St
1.6.4	That is, a machine in the DMZ would receive all incoming connections.	St
1.6.5	So the usual network is behind a router and while a pool of IPs would let you take an IP and send incoming to that IP to a particular computer, that still fails to &quot;DMZ&quot; the entire network.	St
1.6.6	At least that's clear to your beginning first year networker.	St
1.6.7	With that out of the way, I can only suggest you chat with the folk you work with about your network.	St
1.6.8	I must bow out since I think your goal is unclear.	St
1.6.9	Bob	St
