1.1.1	I have an HP Evo D325 with Win XP Pro, an Athlon XP 2800 processor and 512 MB of RAM.	St
1.1.2	When I look at the system information screen in My Computer it tells me I have 448 MB of RAM and Im not sure why.	St
1.1.3	Ive look inside it and there are two 256 MB modules so Im curious what the reason for the different numbers is.	St
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	I assumed my Nvidia GeForce4 video card took care of all that.	St
1.4.1	The stock machine uses some for onboard video.	St
1.4.2	Did you put in a video card?	St
1.4.3	(you didn't tell) If so did you explore the BIOS or manual for ways to reduce the video ram size?	St
1.5.1	.... you have a video chip built into the MB to perform the video function.	St
1.5.2	Under that implementation, system RAM , is used to support the built in video function.	St
1.5.3	PROs....save money for the PC mfg, lower cost to buyer.	St
1.5.4	CONS....usually slow and uses system RAM.	St
1.5.5	For that reason, it's usually better to have have a least 1GB RAM for Windows XP especially for systems with built in video chips.	St
1.5.6	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	I didn't add a video card, that's just what came with the machine.	St
1.7.1	I didn't realize that.	St
1.7.2	I have been thinking about adding more RAM.	St
1.7.3	Any suggestions on a manufacturer to go with or stay away from and a good place to buy?	St
1.8.1	re RAM for HP EVO D325 with Kingston DDR333.	St
1.8.2	http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configurator_new/modelsinfo.asp?SysID=15699&mfr=HP%2FCompaq&model=Evo+Business+Desktop+D325+Microtower%2FSlim+Tower&root=&LinkBack=&Sys=15699-HP%2FCompaq-Evo+Business+Desktop+D325+Microtower%2FSlim+Tower&distributor=0&submit1=Search If this is the info for your PC ...you'd be best adding RAM in pairs to have it work in the dual channel mode.	St
1.8.3	2 DIMM slots (?)	St
1.8.4	you could install 2 @ 512MBs for 1GB total or 2 - 1GB for 2GBs total.	St
1.8.5	What bothers me is I cannot find RAM for this PC at Crucial.	St
1.8.6	DDR333 is pretty common and available most everywhere.	St
1.8.7	Let us know.	St
1.8.8	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	that's the memory my system uses.	St
1.9.2	I also had some trouble finding it on Crucial's site too.	St
1.9.3	It seems you have to look under business systems before choosing Evo.	St
1.9.4	http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=D325%20Series%20All%20Form%20Factors%20%28PC2700%29&pl=HP%20-%20Compaq&cat=RAM I also spoke to one of their reps and she said I could get a 1GB module and just replace one of the 256s.	St
1.9.5	It's possible she gave me some bad info.	St
1.10.1	Lots of alternatives here...you can by all means add a 1GB DIMM ... to go with one of the 256MB DIMMs...for a total of 1278MBs minus the RAM allocated for the graphics.	St
1.10.2	If the system doesn't support dual channel, then there's no loss mixing DIMM densities.	St
1.10.3	If the budget allows...I'd try this (link below) and I'd probably go for two...but that's up to you and your budget.	St
1.10.4	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220058 Whatever you end up doing...let us know how it works.	St
1.10.5	I'd be interested in hearing your impression of the system performance with the additional RAM.	St
1.10.6	VAPCMD	St
1.11.1	I was going to check out newegg.com but I probably wouldn't have looked at Patriot because I have never heard of them.	St
1.11.2	This is the first time I've looked at RAM in years so there's a lot that would be new to me.	St
1.11.3	I read some of the reviews and many seem pleased with the product.	St
1.11.4	The budget is a concern, I had thought about adding just a 1GB stick.	St
1.11.5	How would I make sure that my system does or doesn't support dual channel?	St
1.11.6	I'll be sure to let you know how it works when I finally make the buy.	Sug
1.12.1	channel architecture.	St
1.12.2	If you find it is dual channel, then buying matched DIMMs would be more important as dual channel and matched pair gives slightly greater performance.	St
1.12.3	Assuming it's NOT dual channel, buying pairs of the same brand mfg, speed and density gives greater assurance there will be no mismatch or incompatibility between the existing 256MB DIMM and the new 1GB DIMM.	St
1.12.4	If you buy only one 1GB DIMM, I'd recommend it be placed in the first DIMM slot 1 (or A) however it's labeled and that you test it with Memtest86+ without any other RAM installed.	St
1.12.5	Once you're sure it's OK, the add the 2nd DIMM and test again.	St
1.12.6	If all OK, then just enjoy more RAM.	St
1.12.7	Re Patriot...I wouldn't hesitate to buy...they're well tested and NewEgg will exchange or replace it if there's any problem.	St
1.12.8	Customer review for those DIMMs are outstanding.	St
1.12.9	Keep us posted.	St
1.12.10	VAPCMD	St
1.13.1	NIL	St
1.14.1	today and installed it, with no problems.	St
1.14.2	The main reason it was needed was I ordered some old aerial photos from the government and the files are huge, 337 megs.	St
1.14.3	They load a lot quicker and I can zoom in now, so it was a success.	St
1.14.4	The only problem I have now is when I zoom in, I reach a point where windows picture and fax viewer says 'drawing failed' not sure what that's about, but that was happening before I added the RAM.	St
1.15.1	Did you add 1GB to what you had or did you go to 2GBs ?	Ques
1.15.2	VAPCMD	St
1.16.1	I was told I didn't need matched pairs.	St
1.16.2	I had to reply to different post for some reason.	St
