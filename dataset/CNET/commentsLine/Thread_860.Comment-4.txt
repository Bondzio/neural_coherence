and a &quot;128mb rather good card&quot;, i dont see how it wont be able to play new games.
probably better than me setup.
512mb of ram, fx5200.
p4 no ht.
and it can play nfsmw at the very lowest settings.
but it can handle flight sim 2004, warcraft iii pretty good, doom 3 at 800x600 on medium settings no aa, pretty much everything on low settings.
i would say get an amd 3800+ dual core.
not that expensive, not that cheap.
and it would be worth it.
