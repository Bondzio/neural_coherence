it's a problem of multiple causes.
your pppoe dsl is not an always on internet connection (it has to log on) so your choice on how to configure your router.
mine had the pppoe and it worked fine but i needed to check off some box to &quot;stay connected.&quot; the model number seems off.
didn't find this router so i didn't look at it's manual.
