next we get to change the rf channel.
since other devices can interfere with your setup, i suggest you change the rf channel.
try 1, then 5 or 6 then 11. if you have some neighbors with wifi then your signals may be getting some interference.
be sure to try it without wep but turn on mac filtering for security until it gets stable.
remember that low signals will disconnect.
be sure that we are not &quot;expecting too much&quot; with a too far away connection.
