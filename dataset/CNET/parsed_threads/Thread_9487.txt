<s> Are you currently using terabyte hard drives? </s>
<s> -- Yes. </s>
<s> (How many terabytes?) </s>
<s> -- No. </s>
<s> (Why not?) </s>

<s> It sounds tera-fying! </s>

<s> What am I to do when you can get 2 tera-fying Hdd. </s>
<s> for under $70? </s>
<s> i don't happen to have one cause i don't ever have enough money to buy one and some hard drives i see are expencive to me. </s>
<s> the biggest hard drive i have is an old 320gb ide hard drive. </s>
<s> i know i should get with the times but its what i can get cheap or free. </s>
<s> I've got two, partly for data and partly for backup each from the other. </s>
<s> I am using 1TB in a computer I built two years ago and a RAID-1 server bought around the same time, and even with doing video editing, I have only filled about 40% of this. </s>
<s> Am still struggling to install the bundled drive manager software which takes up a lot of the touted 1T space! </s>
<s> No support for using on Windows 8 either .....but the prices are coming down fast which makes it attractive. </s>
<s> I have six 2TB drives configured in 2 RAID 5's; one in a desktop and one in a NAS. </s>
<s> So, 8TB usable. </s>
<s> In my primary machine, I have a 1TB drive and a 4TB drive mounted internally. </s>
<s> Externally, I have a 2 TB, a 3 TB, and a 4TB attached. </s>
<s> Although they are not terabyte drives, I also have a 750 GB drive and a 640 GB drive mounted in the HP plug-and-play drive bays. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> I use Windows Media Center a LOT (I record an average of 4 movies a day) and I need the space. </s>
<s> I also use the external 4TB drive as a backup device. </s>
<s> I use 3 250Gb drives, there is a valid reason for this. </s>
<s> 1) On C drive I have my O/S, drivers and any other programmes that MUST be on C.; 2) D Drive holds all my various Programme files and any games i have installed. </s>
<s> ; 3) E drive has ALL my personal data files (such as word or Excel files that are irreplaceable). </s>
<s> This is done deliberately. </s>
<s> I did have one of the drives (the C drive crash on me, it also wiped out my D drive However, E drive was untouched. </s>
<s> with a single drive even though partitioned this would not be the case - the whole drive would be wiped out, meaning that unless you backed up the data section regularly you would lose everything.. My motto better safe than sorry. </s>
<s> I've recently made hard drive image backups of school PCs. </s>
<s> One set of PCs had 500 GB drives and the other 1TB hard drives. </s>
<s> Both sets had about the same amount of hard drive space in use...or about 40-50 GB. </s>
<s> Creating the image of the 500 GB drives required less than 15 minutes but the image creation of the 1 TB drives took over 2 hours. </s>
<s> As well, the image created of the larger drives was about 3X the size of that of the smaller drives. </s>
<s> Why?. </s>
<s> The answer seems to be that imaging utility (Acronis True Image) defaults to the sector by sector mode of operation at some drive size threshold. </s>
<s> This means that, rather than ignoring the free space, it copies that as well. </s>
<s> My version of the utility (2010) is not current, however. </s>
<s> That being said, anyone who uses drive imaging in their backup scheme might want to take note of this finding. </s>
<s> Personally, I think it's foolish to buy a larger drive just because the cost per GB is less. </s>
<s> Who buys a 20 room house but only has 2 rooms of furniture for it? </s>
<s> 6x2tb in a separate RAID enclosure. </s>
<s> Works great! </s>
<s> Took a little fooling around to understand and get it right. </s>
