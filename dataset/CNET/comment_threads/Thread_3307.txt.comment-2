Quite frankly there just isn't that many HD makers.
Off the top of my head, there is Seagate, WD, Samsung, Hitatci and Maxtor.
Seagate now owns Samsung a as well as Maxtor.
Any other label out there maybe a &quot;rebadged&quot; HD is different from those listed.
I have found Seagate to do well to include WD brands.
I xclude any ext.
mounted drives and any 2.5in.
as well also anything SSD based.
