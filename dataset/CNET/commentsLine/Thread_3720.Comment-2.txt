i would reseat the connections at both ends, several times.
verify that any addressing jumper is present or is proper.
why, did you pull the drive in the 1st place, to access something or replace it, etc?
did you use proper &quot;static&quot; handling?
if not, then you now have the result from improper handling.
if this is sata type connection, these can be awful when reconnecting as it is possible to break or spread the contacts from touching 100%.
verify all this and come back with results.
