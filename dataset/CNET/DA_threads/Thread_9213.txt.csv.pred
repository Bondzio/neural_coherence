1.1.1	i have a netgear dgnd 3700 router and wish to add an external hard drive and was about to purchase a seagate goflex 3tb external but have read that these two are incompatible ?	Ques
1.1.2	i thought this ready share enabled feature allowed you to connect any usb/ethernet storage device ?	Ques
1.2.1	That won't work, sadly.	St
1.2.2	A USB hard drive is not an OS and doesn't have the software installed to talk to the router or manage networking.	St
1.2.3	You will need some kind of NAS (Network Attached Storage) system where you can, if you wish, connect the hdd to if you want to use it as a network drive.	St
1.2.4	There's more here; http://www.techsupportforum.com/forums/f31/connecting-usb-external-drive-to-router-137701.html That said, I wonder if &quot;Mapping the hdd&quot; would work?	St
1.2.5	That USB drive connected to one computer on a network.	St
1.2.6	The other computers on the network 'map' that drive so it behaves like a drive on them and they have access to it.	St
1.2.7	But I am not sure about that.	St

1.3.1	I visited the Netgear support website and found this: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What can I do with ReadyShare USB Storage Access?	St
1.3.2	In your home today, you connect multiple PCs and other devices to the network.	St
1.3.3	Many of the same files now need to be routinely accessed by multiple PCs, gaming consoles and other devices connected to the network.	St
1.3.4	Most consumers buy external hard drives to store the content besides the desktop hard drives.	St
1.3.5	But now you can simply plug in your USB external hard drive to the USB port of the router instead of connecting to each and every computer when required.	St
1.3.6	Any device in the network can now read/write simultaneously from the USB hard drive connected to the DGND3700 at a much higher speed than any competing router in its category.	St
1.3.7	&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet, it doesn't explain the degree of size that the router can handle and/or the small details that maybe needed for a good fit.	St
1.3.8	Thus, you will need to inquire them to see where it all leads.	St
1.3.9	I'm sure the router install should have direct setting(I assume) for any reference for the ext.	Sug
1.3.10	USB port usage.	St
1.3.11	Check the manual.	St
1.3.12	I did find that is also supports a printer from those USB port(s).	St
1.3.13	Also, you do realize a 3Tb HD is a large HD and that alone maybe an issue.	St
1.3.14	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	been doing a lot of research online regarding this matter and from what i have found along with contacting both companies i have decided to just opt for a nas drive instead.	St
1.4.2	seems to be the only solution for my needs so i have just ordered the seagate nas110 seeing as the kids have two xboxs they can now watch all there movies.	St
