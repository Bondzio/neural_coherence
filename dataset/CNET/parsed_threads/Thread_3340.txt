<s> should be &quot;msoobe /A&quot; (without quotes). </s>
<s> You'll have to try that from the command line which means going to Start/Run and type &quot;command&quot; (again, no quotes). </s>
<s> It should bring up a window. </s>
<s> Try running msoobe with the switch from there. </s>
<s> If it says not found, this means the file isn't in the &quot;path&quot; statement and you need to do this. </s>
<s> Return to the root directory from the command prompt by typing CD \ (that's CD with a space and a backslash) from there type the following CD WINDOWS\system32\oobe Now type msoobe /A </s>
