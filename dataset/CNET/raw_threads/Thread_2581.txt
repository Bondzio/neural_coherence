I highly recommend purchasing a broadband router. It adds an extra layer of security (firewall, filtering, etc.) between your computers and the DSL modem. Also, a router will allow your laptop to use the DSL Internet connection without having to turn on your desktop, as ICS requires. I recommend purchasing a wireless-G broadband router. Most allow you to make 4 wired connections and multiple wireless connections at the same time.
