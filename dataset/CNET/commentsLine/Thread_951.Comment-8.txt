here's a table about it -&gt;  it doesn't show what happens at 64gb, 128gb and so on.
that 32k cluster doubles at each size so you can get 128kb clusters in no time at all.
it's why fat32 users keep the partitions small.
but here's the killer item -&gt; fat32 partitions can't create a file larger than 4 gb since the office and i do a lot of video work, fat32 is dead.
