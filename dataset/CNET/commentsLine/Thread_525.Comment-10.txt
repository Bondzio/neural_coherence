you need to skip all this and get out your tape measure.
i did and i found that the displays do increase in height with the width.
there is no need to find who uses amat lcd machines.
i used that as a talking point about why things are the way they are.
with lcd fab machines in the millions of dollars no one could afford to make the old aspect ratio displays (4x3) without having the hdtv market as well as the laptop and pc/mac/other lcd market.
hope this clears it up for you.
