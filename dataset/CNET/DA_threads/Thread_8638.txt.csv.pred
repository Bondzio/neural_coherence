1.1.1	Esteemed List: I have an Epson Stylus CX6000 copier-printer-scanner.	St
1.1.2	I have a newish Intel 2.13 GHz MacBook, OS 10.6.2 (Snow Leopard) with 2 GBs SDRAM and PhotoShop Elements 8.	St
1.1.3	I migrated all my compatible software from a G4 12&quot; PowerBook running OS 10.3.9, including the Epson software package - printer drivers, scanner, etc.	St
1.1.4	- and the printer/copier works fine but neither Elements nor the laptop recognize the scanner software.	St
1.1.5	The Epson site has a &quot;complete&quot; driver update for Snow Leopard that supposedly covers these issues.	St
1.1.6	There is a warning that some parts of the drivers require OS 10.5, which this laptop never had.	St
1.1.7	My question: is it safe to download and install these updated drivers?	St
1.1.8	Do you have any suggestions?I do a fair amount of scanning work and need to access the Epson.	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advance!	St
1.1.10	White 2.13 GHz Macbook, OS 10.6.2, 2 GBs SDRAM; Epson Stylus CX6000, Epson Scan 2.90 software; Epson Printer Utility and Epson Printer Utility 2.	St
1.2.1	importing from the Preview app?	St
1.2.2	Or using the Image Capture app to grab stuff from the scanner.	St
1.2.3	It is probably safe to install the stuff from Epson, if it requires 10.5, and you don't have it, it should avoid installing those parts.	St
1.2.4	P	St
