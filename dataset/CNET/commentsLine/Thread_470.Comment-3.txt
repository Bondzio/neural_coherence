i totally agree with willy, you would be better off setting up a new system from scratch.
use the old gateway as secondary system and base a new unit on newer technology, you will have much better results.
shop around online for components, newegg and others, there are always deals and sales on hardware plus it is a lot of fun designing your own set up.
have fun and good luck!!
