Save your files that you can't lose.
I'm seeing FAT32 volumes on USB fail on Windows but work on other OSes (Mac, Linux).
To fix this we back off the files and delete, create the partition and give it a fresh format.
Sadly FAT32 is not damage resistant and eventually goes wonky again.
-&gt; Let me be blunt.
Do not use FAT32 volumes on USB for storage.
Only use such to transfer files.
