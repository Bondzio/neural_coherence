i can only think the usb device was the last straw that was too much of the overall burden of the p/s unit.
which is why many times here and elsewhere i've suggested getting a 400w+ p/s unit or better to have a *stable* power source.
too often on a stuffed system or in the case of usb, too many devices attached can cause problems.
if the usb is power hungary it maybe a bad match for the mtrbd.
connection to supply the power and a &quot;powered usb hub&quot; maybe the answer.
it supplies its own power and all the usb port needs to do is acknowledge the device.
-or- a pci type usb card with a nec based chipset.
as for the testing, the os checks for the presence of usb port, then device and it shares a total of .500ma of power per hub(mtrbd.)
under its device mgr.
status.
either a weak p/s, bad usb chipset, or physical weak(solder/mtrbd) wiring can be at fault.
these are my best guesses to day, but it seems some usb devices are better tahn other plus the mtrbd.
chipset involved can lessen hassles, via comes to mind often.
hey, these things happen.
good luck -----willy
