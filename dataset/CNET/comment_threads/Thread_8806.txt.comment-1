I am running a P-IV, 1.6, 512 ram,92GHD's, Win XP Pro and dial up.
I just installed a stick of 256 memory, (identical to the first stick) and since doing that, my computer is quite a bit faster, (offline) but when I connect to the web, everything loads so much slower than when I only had 256 ram.
Any suggestions?
Thanks, Bill
