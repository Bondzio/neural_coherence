We have a dial-up connection and we need to share a printer. Eventually we will buy a laptop that wil need to share the Internet connection. Both computers have windows XP Home SP2. What is the best method to do this? brpros

Other solutions are a switch to both PC's, a router for a future broadband connection or an ADHOC wireless network. The choice is your's.
