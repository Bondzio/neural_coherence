Recently OS was reinstalled and diskette which had come with card was not readable. So driver was installed from download search. It worked initially, ping was successful, I was able to surf net continuously. Now after a week what happens till I do not dial to connect through DSL ping is successful. But as soon as I connect to net just after opening few web pages hardly in 3 to 5 minutes ping command starts failing and I receive message &quot;Request timed out&quot;. After reboot same symptom re-appears i.e. initially successful ping and then &quot;Request timed out&quot; once I start surfing. What can be wrong ? [A] OS ? Ethernet Card ? [C] Any other/software conflict ? And how to resolve this ? Thx in advance. -- RKS

To test such I boot my Linux CD. As to why it might not work when you installed Windows the most common issue is a forgotten driver. Most common forgot? Motherboard driver package. I can't count the times the poor(er?) owner keep looking for the ethernet card drivers but had those already. Bob
