I read the Intel is 30% faster than the AMD. Is this true? And would someone like me notice the diffference?? How is AMD??? I can get an HP Pavillion with the AMD 1.86 GHz and 1GB memory (2 x512 sticks) with a 250GB hard drive for $799.99, or should I invest in the Intel processor at 2.13 Ghz w/2 Gb memory (2 x 1024 MB sticks) for $1299.99?? I want something that's gonna last a few years without needing updating.
