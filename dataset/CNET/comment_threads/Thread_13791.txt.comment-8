Several years ago, I saw it mathematically demonstrated that the drive had to written over for at least 3 times to ensure that nobody could retrieve the data.
Now, since some cd's are 3 dimensional, the 3 time write over supposedly doesn't work.
At a Business show a few months ago, some guys were selling a &quot;Drive Shredder&quot; that actually chops up the drive into tiny metal and plastic pieces that resembles the way a paper shredder works.
How important is your data?
How paranoid are you?
Do you think a hammer and saw could accomplish the same thing?
