<s> Monitor is Samsung SyncMaster 2253LW and the video card is Gigabyte Radeon 9200. </s>
<s> Both have analog and digital ports. </s>
<s> Running WinXP Pro, SP3, and the Samsung drivers have been installed. </s>
<s> The analog signal works just fine. </s>
<s> some monitors don't autoswitch based on the live signal. </s>
<s> I don't believe I know where to go to accomplish that. </s>
<s> I looked in the BIOS, but didn't see anything there to change, and the cables are terminated differently for DVI, and only use the rectangular fitting. </s>
<s> Look in the monitor menu settings, there should be an option, VGA/DVI etc. </s>
