1.1.1	This is about the computer I 've been having for 5 years now .	St
1.1.2	Recently I 've built a new computer that does n't show these problems , but I still need this old one .	St
1.1.3	Upgrading to a new computer is not an option , because I already have a brand new computer .	St
1.1.4	This old computer is at my parents place and I still need it there in the cases I 'm there .	St
1.1.5	Specs of the problem machine : Athlon XP 1700+ CPU 512MB RAM MSI motherboard ( not sure which model ) Hercules Geforce3 Ti500 card This machine has been showing problems already since it was a year old .	St
1.1.6	Very sometimes there was a sudden random crash for no reason .	St
1.1.7	There have been times when it was about once a day , and then there were periods when it has n't shown any problems at all for many months , and then later randomly it did it again .	St
1.1.8	It was OS-independant , so certainly not driver dependant .	St
1.1.9	I did a memtest , and made the memtest run for a whole night , and there were 0 errors .	St
1.1.10	I then always suspected the videocard , because the errors were usually video card related ( video card drivers mentioned in the crashlogs or bluescreens ) .	St
1.1.11	Then about a year ago , it had a different kind of symptom : sometimes when booting up , the motherboard started making a sequence of low/high/low/high/ ... pitched beeps .	St
1.1.12	Pressing the reset button made it boot up fine then .	St
1.1.13	Since there was that easy solution of just resetting , I never really did anything about it .	St
1.1.14	After a few months , that beeping problem disappeared again mysteriously .	St
1.1.15	But now the computer is again in a bad period .	St
1.1.16	Now , when booting up , I can go to KDE in Linux , and after a minute it 'll freeze .	St
1.1.17	Then I reboot again , to KDE again , after two minutes , it freezes again .	St
1.1.18	I also tried it with booting to MS Windows , and same thing : it freezes after a while .	St
1.1.19	Sometimes it also reboots after being frozen for a few seconds .	St
1.1.20	Then I looked in the BIOS at the temperatures .	St
1.1.21	So I boot to the BIOS and all voltages and temperatures look normal .	St
1.1.22	But then , it freezes again .	St
1.1.23	My computer actually managed to freeze while in the BIOS menu When it has been on without freezing for long enough , it manages to stay alive without freezing .	St
1.1.24	It 's only in the first half hour or hour or so that the chance of freezing appears to be higher .	St
1.1.25	I 've looked at all the capacitors on the motherboard , but none of the capacitors look like they 're leeking or exploded .	St
1.1.26	They all look fine .	Polite
1.1.27	Is it possible that there can be a bad capacitor that looks fine at the outside ?	Ques
1.1.28	Does anyone have an idea what now could be the thing that causes all these problems on this computer , and especially the recent freezing problem because that 's the worst it has ever done ?	Ques
1.1.29	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Supply pictures for us to look .	St
1.2.2	I ran into yet another where the owner had declared them good but the cap tops were domed yet no leaks .	St
1.2.3	That failed the test .	St
1.2.4	We also see issues where the mainboard when replaced fixes the issue .	St
1.2.5	Many owners dig in their heels on that but at least we can do that as a test .	St
1.2.6	Finally you did n't list the power supply .	St
1.2.7	It could be a well aged 350 or less Watt unit .	St
1.2.8	We swap and retest .	St
1.2.9	We also pull the cover off and point a fan at the unit to sniff out a heat issue .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	Too bad I have no quick way available to show pictures .	St
1.3.2	However I look at the caps and do n't see any domed tops .	St
1.3.3	The tops are flat , clean and shiny , and with a & quot ; K & quot ; , & quot ; + & quot ; or & quot ; Y & quot ; shaped marking on them .	St
1.3.4	About the power supply : It 's only 300W It 's made in China .	St
1.3.5	It does n't appear to have a brand , unless & quot ; Sales International & quot ; is a brand .	St
1.3.6	So it does n't look like the best power supply out there .	St
1.3.7	Maybe I should think about replacing this .	St
1.3.8	Could a bad power supply cause all the symptoms I mentioned ?	Ques
1.4.1	And a recurring one too .	St
1.4.2	Do you have access to an OSCILLOSCOPE to look at the power supply legs ?	Ques
1.4.3	I find it cheaper to toss in some 450 or more Watt unit and retest .	St
1.4.4	How did the cover off and fan test go ?	Ques
1.4.5	Did the lint and dust fly ?	Ques
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	I installed a brand new PSU in the computer .	St
1.5.2	A 400W PSU from NorthQ .	St
1.5.3	I 'm sure this one is fine .	St
1.5.4	I was really convinced that the problem would be solved , but NO WAY !	St
1.5.5	Just after the new 400W PSU was in there and I rebooted , Linux could boot up halfway and then hung and nothing responded anymore .	St
1.5.6	That is the typical kind of random freeze .	St
1.5.7	The second time it booted up completely and worked the whole evening .	St
1.5.8	Today I boot up again , and I worked 5 minutes in KDE , when it hung , the last half second of music that was playing looped a bit for a while , and then automatically rebooted .	St
1.5.9	This is exactly the same symptom as always , and now it occurs while the new PSU is in here .	St
1.5.10	I then rebooted to memtest86 .	St
1.5.11	After 2 seconds of the test running , there were some funny random symbols ( including a few of the ASCII smiley symbols ) on the bottom half of the screen .	St
1.5.12	The test was frozen .	St
1.5.13	I rebooted again and tried again .	St
1.5.14	Now memtest ran for 3 minutes ( indicating no errors up to that point ) , when then suddenly there were again random random symbols on the bottom half of the screen , a few rows of all-filled ascii characters this time .	St
1.5.15	The test again was frozen , the seconds of the timer not moving anymore .	St
1.5.16	WHAT can this be now ?	Ques
1.5.17	There are no bad-looking elco 's on the motherboard , the PSU is now a new 400W one , and memtest86 does n't indicate memory errors but instead just crashes .	St
1.6.1	& quot ; After 2 seconds of the test running , there were some funny random symbols ( including a few of the ASCII smiley symbols ) on the bottom half of the screen & quot ; This is typical of a failed video card .	St
1.6.2	Try another .	St
1.6.3	While 300W is slim it is also a source of failures since it 's power can sag then boards get stressed as the currents increase , parts overheat and fail in odd ways .	St
1.6.4	The PSU is never the place to skimp ( a lesson many learn over time . )	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	A month ago I did three things : -disconnect one of the two optical drives -remove one of the two RAM modules ( now I have only 256MB on this system ) -clean ALL the dust from the video card , and it was a LOT , especially below the cooler near the GPU I then booted it and it worked .	St
1.7.2	It has n't frozen once for a month !	St
1.7.3	Today I wanted my 512MB RAM back and put in the second module again .	St
1.7.4	However , when I turned on the PC , the screen was just blank , nothing happened .	St
1.7.5	So I removed the RAM module again and now it works again .	St
1.7.6	Is that RAM module broken ?	Ques
1.7.7	Or did I insert it wrongly ?	Ques
1.7.8	I know that I inserted them in a different order than they were initially ( there are 3 slots on the mobo , I used the two on the one side instead of the two on the other side , simply for reasons of easier to reach ) , does that matter ?	Ques
1.7.9	So , freezing problem fixed , I do n't know which of the 3 actions described above fixed it , and I have only 256MB RAM now .	St
