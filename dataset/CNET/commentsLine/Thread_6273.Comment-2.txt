windows 2000 will install some drivers on initial install but windows update will not install drivers... unless you configured it to do so.
my initial question would be &quot;what color depth are you using?
they should look good if you are using 16-bit or 32-bit color.
it sounds like you are using 8.&quot; but... you may need to fish around for the &quot;show icons using all possible colors&quot; setting.
i'm not on the 2000 box so i leave this for you to find.
maybe tweakui could help with that or it's icon rebuild tool.
as to drivers, i may have missed what video card you have, but as always, try the latest.
as to windows update, i suggest you set it to not do drivers.
