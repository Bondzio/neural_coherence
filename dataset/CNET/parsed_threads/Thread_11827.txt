<s> One week ago I set up the BELKIN 54Mbps Wireless ROuter as per the instuctions to my home office LAN. </s>
<s> It worked perfectly for 3 days, routing both the wired LAN and wirless access to my two laptops - IBM T42 and SONY VIAO 505. </s>
<s> Then after 3 days both laptops ceased to be able to access wirelessly [while the wired network continues to work fine]. </s>
<s> Both laptops recognize the wireless network - they just can't connect to it. </s>
<s> The IBM says the signal is too weak - even when I put it right next to the router. </s>
<s> The Sony does not give a reason. </s>
<s> I have: 1. </s>
<s> Replaced the router with a new one from the store and reinstalled it - no help. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Turned off the IBM automatic access software - no help. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Tried to reconnect everyway I can think of. </s>
<s> I am completely stimied. </s>
<s> THanks for reading this. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> firmware on the makers site. </s>
<s> In combination with a call to the makers helpline I was able to access the firmware directly on the router and reset the channel. </s>
<s> I never had a clue that there were different broadcast channels [like a phone] and of course this makes sense. </s>
<s> It fixed the problem so I can connect from my IBM laptop, but my Sony still does not work - It shows the network and connects automatically then disconnects about 2 seconds later. </s>
<s> It flips back anf forth, connected -- diconnected every couple of seconds. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> 1.) </s>
<s> Upgrade 'firmware' in router if you haven't already and if Sony notebook has 'card' or internal wireless upgrade it's 'firmware' also! </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> Is the Sony located in the vicinity of a telephone that uses 2.4Ghz carrier? </s>
<s> I experienced a similar intermittent operation and it was fixed by removing the phone completely. </s>
<s> 3.) </s>
<s> In 'Network Connections', 'Wireless network Connections Properties'(Get to via right click), 'Wireless Networks' be sure &quot;Use Windows to configure my wireless netowrk settings&quot; is checked!! </s>
