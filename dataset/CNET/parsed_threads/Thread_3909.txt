<s> I was looking for a Platform independent Remote Connection software. </s>
<s> Googling threw up VNC on top of the list. </s>
<s> So, is VNC the best avaiable option for this purpose?? </s>
<s> Also, there are myriads of VNC variations available (RealVNC, TightVNC, UltraVNC, and what not). </s>
<s> Which one of these is the best option available around? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Why criteria makes one better than the other for you? </s>
<s> I read your post twice and couldn't find how you would rank these. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My criteria is basically User-Friendliness in configuration, and performance. </s>
<s> None seem friendly to non-network savvy folk. </s>
<s> Let's give all you listed a failing grade. </s>
<s> However these are fairly technical items. </s>
<s> I won't suggest any to users that are not network proficient. </s>
<s> Example, they know what a NETMASK entry is, and how DNS works. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So, what's basically the difference between them?? </s>
<s> Is a comparative study available anywhere on the web? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Not to discourage you but each software has a homepage that you could read and see what you like about each. </s>
<s> Since all do about the same thing all that varies is laid out on the three web sites. </s>
<s> Why not do your own study? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sure, I have done my own study. </s>
<s> But these are the exact reasons why forums are there for!! </s>
<s> Every vendor makes claims about its products superiority over others. </s>
<s> I thought someone here might have had experience with these VNCs to provide an independent analysis of which one is the better one. </s>
<s> These product for my use and what they do are fungible. </s>
<s> That word should suffice why you didn't find a study. </s>
<s> All fail for your need of ease of use. </s>
<s> All of them however do function very well but require a modicum of network setup skill, understanding of what ports are, the difference of UDP, TCP and such. </s>
<s> I just connected the dots when I looked at your other discussion about the proxy issue. </s>
<s> When I did that, it's clear to me that you need something much better than any VNC made today. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I had to scramble for my dictionary when I saw your use of word: Fungible. </s>
<s> Initially, it sounded like derogatory... Anyways, It was good you looked at my other thread, and this one as they are surely related. </s>
<s> As a developer, I am pretty much at ease with ports, TCP/IP and all, just that I have not used them for a Remote Connection type of thing outside Windows RA/RDC. </s>
<s> Looks like I need to get my hands dirty. </s>
<s> Whenever I do, I will try to find a reproducible series of steps that other can use to accomplish what I am trying. </s>
<s> And I will document them here!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
