<s> I have a fairly straightforward setup - cable modem, router, wireless access point. </s>
<s> Suddenly, no internet (Time Warner). </s>
<s> Reboot everything, no go. </s>
<s> Check internet at the modem and it's working fine. </s>
<s> Reboot everything but am very careful about sequence and timing, no go. </s>
<s> Breakout my backup router which is identical to the primary. </s>
<s> Modem connected to backup router connected to laptop, no go. </s>
<s> This goes on for quite some time, all the while being careful to reboot modem each time. </s>
<s> Eventually I notice via the Windows 7 Network and Sharing Center that whenever a router is inline, the internet connection lasts for about 20 seconds, then it's off for about 20 seconds, then back on, etc. </s>
<s> Laptop connected directly to the modem, rock solid. </s>
<s> Throughout this process, I tried different computers, ethernet cables, just about everything but the cable modem. </s>
<s> All the lights are lit as they should be on the modem and as mentioned, things work great when plugged directly in. </s>
<s> I've ordered another modem off ebay and it'll take a few days but if anyone has any ideas, I'm all ears because right now, I'm mystified. </s>
<s> If your router is over 3 years old, it could need to be replaced. </s>
<s> For something with no moving parts, this has always seemed strange to me, but they do wear out somehow. </s>
<s> The good news is they are cheap. </s>
<s> You can get them for as little as $15. </s>
<s> ` Good luck. </s>
<s> but for another person rather than myself. </s>
<s> In this case, what we are seeing is the modem to randomly get out of sync and need to reconnect. </s>
<s> It may cycle over and over. </s>
<s> I can remove the router and connect the PC directly to the modem and it seems to be better. </s>
<s> I put this other persons router on my own network and ran it for days without a hiccup. </s>
<s> This person uses TWC as well and I think it's at their end. </s>
<s> The clues may be here http://www.dslreports.com/faq/3692 I'm noting that the signal to noise ratio in the other modem is a much lower number than in my own. </s>
<s> Also, the power levels are significantly lower than mine. </s>
<s> Check your modem by going to it's interface with a web browser and see if you're well within these specs. </s>
<s> If you have a Motorola, the default IP is usually 192.168.100.1. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Thanks Steve - my signal strength is about -3dBm so believe we're ok there but will check other specs based on the dslreports thread. </s>
<s> I keep a Network binder at home with all kinds of reference material and I will absolutely add this to the binder. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> Just so happens I have the exact same router (d-link DGL-4100) as a spare and had the same results when I inserted it in place of the original router. </s>
<s> With the spare inserted, configuration was simplified to just modem, router and laptop - still no internet. </s>
<s> The higher the number, the better. </s>
<s> Mine runs 40+ while the person I'm trying to help runs slightly under 30. </s>
