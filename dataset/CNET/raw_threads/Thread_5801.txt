Just installed a PCI based video card in my older desktop so that I can run dual monitors (one's on a serial port, the other is DVI). I'm wondering if there is anyway to ALSO use the OEM/stock video chipset to run a third monitor at the same time on the original serial port? We're using windows 7 here, if that helps.

As to the onboard graphics, since some machines disable onboard video when a card is installed you can't tell if you can use that until you try it. Bob
