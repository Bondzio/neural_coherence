1.1.1	I bought an LCD monitor with a: DVI-D dual input ..and a Vid card with a: DVI-I dual input ..and I have a DVI-I single input ------------ Picture for details: http://xs104.xs.to/xs104/06326/dvi-config-1_edit.gif The picture shows the cable in RED, the VGA and LCD's complementary inputs in green and violet.	St
1.1.2	------------ Now the DVI-I cable won't fit into the LCD's hub, but will fit into the Vid card's.	St
1.1.3	The only thing preventing fitting to the LCD is the 4 pins (around the flat pin) you see in the photo.	St
1.1.4	Would removing them manually cause any conflicts?	St
1.1.5	Because the alternative choice now is to buy a DVI-D cable which has no pins around the flat thing.	St
1.1.6	What do you think?	St
1.1.7	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	You have male-single link while both connectors on the card and lcd are male-dual link.	St
1.2.2	I would buy a new cable.	St
1.3.1	as far as I know, a single link will also fit into a dual link hub.	St
1.3.2	I know dual links provide higher resolutions, but I'm satisfied with my current 1280x1024.	St
