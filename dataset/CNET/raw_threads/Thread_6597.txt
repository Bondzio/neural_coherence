My dell pc have been affected due to the virus, and after formatted the disk, my important word files have gone too. I never aware that the lost files can be recovered by a data recovery software until a friend of mine said it to me. I googled with data recovery, so many softwares were found: EASEUS Data Recovery Wizard, easy recovery , active, undeleted. I dont know which is the best one to buy, I dont have too much money. Somebody recommend EASEUS, I have gone to his website, maybe it is a cost-effective one. Is there any more suggestion before I purchase EASEUSs.

If you decide to retrieve it, you've got to pay. That's reasonable. I shouldn't buy a program without knowing for sure it can find your files. So better make a new selection for programs that offer such a demo mode. Kees
