1.1.1	I have a Sony Vaio Model PCG250.	St
1.1.2	My network connection is fine.	St
1.1.3	My wireless connection status says I am connected at 53.0Mbps.	St
1.1.4	But it says I have an invalid IP address.	St
1.1.5	I am currently using a wireless router (Dlink) and a wireless PC adapter (asante).	St
1.1.6	I am connected but my internet explorer does not work.	St
1.1.7	I went to Command Prompt to look at my IP configuration, but it says 0.0.0.0 I tried to manually input an IP address but my computer does not seem to accept it.	St
1.1.8	I tried to release my ip and then renew (my friend showed me how) but I get an error message saying &quot;an error occurred while renewing interface wireless network connection 3: the system cannot find the file specified.	St
1.1.9	Please help!	St
1.2.1	and sometimes even *other* D-Link adapters.	St
1.2.2	First, do you have a static or dynamic IP address?	Ques
1.2.3	If dynamic, you may need some info from your isp.	St
1.2.4	Anyway, you may want to try this, reset the router per D-Link's instructions (normally a little button you have to push, sometime with something like a pencil point).	St
1.2.5	Open up Internet Explorer, and under tools&gt;internet options&gt;General Tab, left click the Delete Files button in the middle to get rid of any cached router addresses.	St
1.2.6	RE-setup router per the instructions.	St
1.2.7	Then go through the setup page.	St
1.2.8	Did the router and Sony EVER communicate with the 'net?	St
1.2.9	Sometimes doing a repair of your lan connection will fix it, and check to see if the XP firewall is enabled.	St
1.3.1	I also have this problem and I even tried re-formatting but it didnt help	St
1.4.1	Update the dlink firmware or suffer.	St
1.4.2	How more blunt can I make this?	St
1.4.3	If that doesn't help, try a Dlink card to match.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
