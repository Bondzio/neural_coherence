I just installed a new graphics card (ATI Radeon 9800 Pro) and for some reason it seems to be causing me problems.
My computer shuts down randomly or crashes when I play games.
The most recent error report I received was Error Message: STOP 0x000000EA THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER (Q293078) Can anyone help me?
I have all the latest drivers.
Im thinking maybe an update of the bios?
