thanks for taking the time to explain all this to me.i have 5 discs with virtually nothing on them because i thought i knew what i was doing.i just was baffled that the computer wouldn't reload a disc with almost nothing on it.that would be something for someone to work out a program to fix.i think i should be able to get along from now on.i will keep you updated on my progress and will ask when i hit the next snag.i have apple service but i find your explanations much easier to follow.they just seem to read back what's in the manual,which is how i got here in the first place.i'll pick up some new discs tomorrow and do it properly one time.i'll get back as soon as it's done or i hit my next snag,whichever comes first.
