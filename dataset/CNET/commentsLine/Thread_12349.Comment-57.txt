my experience with linksys has been love hate.
more hate than love lately.
while i love the easy router configuration and the reliability... i absolutely hate their support and past experiences with firmware updates.
after doing a firmware update on a linksys wireless g router (without speed boost) i quickly discovered that it would no longer connect to my g only wireless network.
after some searching i found many other people had the same problem.
the only work around at the time was to switch my g only network to g & b. this solution worked but i purchased and wanted router that could do a g only network.
linksys never offered any back-leveling of firmware to correct this know issue... only saying &quot;our engineers are reviewing the problem&quot;.
the final straw that broke the camels back was the purchase of the linksys wireless game adapter.
i'd have to say by far it was the most frustrating device i've ever configured in my life.
after much struggling with it i finally got rid of it replacing it with another device that worked great.
after those two experiences i'll never purchase linksys again and have since been very happy with the d-link and netgear alternatives i now own.
