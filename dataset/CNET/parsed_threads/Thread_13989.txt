<s> The network neighbourhood or NN isn't supposed to do that. </s>
<s> I won't duplicate web content as to why but don't count on this to work as you expected. </s>
<s> Next, use NET USE at a command prompt instead. </s>
<s> &quot;also i cannot connect internet&quot; Well that's another issue on it's own. </s>
<s> Your TOPIC is the NN so I'll stop here since you left out any details that I could use to help with the internet issue. </s>
