when i plugged in a laptop, i got a correct ip and was able to ping to it and from it to a connected pc and printer.
btw, when i first plugged in the copier to its drop, and let it try to pick up dhcp, it picked up a 169.254 address.
all gateways and subnets have been checked thoroughly.
like i said, it is a bizarre problem.
