sounds like i might as well stick with amd.
how can i find out what motherboard i have, and is there somewhere i can look online to see what processors will work with my motherboard?
if there isn't an easy way, i'll just go to my local computer shop.
the athlon x2 6000+ looks ok- little more than i wanted to spend, but i'll just save longer.
thanks!
