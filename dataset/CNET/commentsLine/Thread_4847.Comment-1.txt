i wanna connect 10meter usb extender to a 4ports usb hub.
but it is not working because it said unknown device.
it shows &quot;windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems.
(code 43)&quot;.
it is working fine if connecting 10meter usb extender to a mouse or keyboard.
it just can't connect to a usb hub.
so is the power problem of the usb hub or i can't connect extender to hub?
