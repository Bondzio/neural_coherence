i use my epson stylus photo 785epx printer a lot and it seems that i have to do the head cleaning routine every two or three days, usually the black ink check pattern has gaps.
ayway, i found the following site that has a lot of information about epson head cleaning and a link to download a program, ssc service utility, that allows cleaning selected print heads instead of all of them:  i haven't tried the single head cleaning yet but the ssc service utility looks interesting and does all kinds of stuff with the printer.
by the way, i refill my cartridges and have excellent results although i am sure refilling isn't for everyone...and don't tell me the refill ink clogs the heads.
i don't clean the heads any more than i had to with new epson ink cartridges.
