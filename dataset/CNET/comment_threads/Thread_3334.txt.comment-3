I can add that to my laptop no problem, that would keep from adding programs, thanks I imagine it goes something like this when i plug my laptop into their network: receive ip address or identifies computer by name traffic is routed through their server then to intended website traffic is routed back through their server from website to my box is my internet traffic visible?
can my computer be network mapped without my knowledge?
I know this is basic, but thanks for your comments
