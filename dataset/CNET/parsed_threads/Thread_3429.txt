<s> Have just upgraded from Gigabyte GA-6WMMC7 mobo with P3 cpu having on board graphics, dual screen facility easily obtained using an old AMC PN 109-40600-10 PCI graphics card. </s>
<s> This card has proved more than adequate for my non gaming needs. </s>
<s> New mobo is Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3L without on board graphics, Intel 3.2 GB Core 2 Duo CPU with 4 GB Kingston Balistix DDR2 RAM. </s>
<s> I bought new MSI RX300HM graphics card for PCI Express x 16 slot. </s>
<s> Both graphics cards use ATI drivers. </s>
<s> I use Windows XP Home on dismantled and new systems. </s>
<s> I have read the forum posts with great interest but my problem seems different. </s>
<s> NO MATTER </s>
<s> While the title tells of screen failures your post writes about some PC. </s>
<s> Read your post and tell more. </s>
<s> SORRY BUT I MIGHT HAVE A GREMLIN. </s>
<s> NO MATTER WHICH GRAPHICS CARD IS INSERTED AND FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY, when I insert the second graphics card and boot up, I hear the correct single beep from POST but neither screen will light up with a display and allow me into XP where I should be able to get things correct. </s>
<s> As a newbie, any help or ideas offered will be most welcome. </s>
<s> Does the screen show the BIOS screen? </s>
<s> If not, you need to find out why. </s>
<s> Could be a missing power plug to the video card (some, not all have that.) </s>
<s> THANKS FOR THE RESPONSE, YES I CAN GET THE BIOS FROM EITHER GRAPHICS CARD BUT WHEN USING OLDER CARD THE DISPLAY IS SO MUCH SLOWER THAT PERHAPS I WAS FOOLED INTO THINKING IT HAD FAILED. </s>
<s> THIS OLDER CARD IS AN AMC PN 109-40600-10 (VER 2.0)REQUIRING AN ATI TECHNOLOGIES 3D RAGE 2C DRIVER. </s>
<s> I GOOGLED THE CARD ID AND FOUND THAT THIS CARD APPEARS TO BE AN APG CARD. </s>
<s> COULD THIS BE A HYBRID, AGP CIRCUITRY ON A PCI FORMAT CARD AND COULD THIS BE PART OF THE PROBLEM? </s>
<s> MY NEW MSI CARD REQUIRES AN ATI RADION X300 DRIVER, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE TWO ATI DRIVERS ARE IN CONFLICT WITHIN XP? </s>
<s> IN THE XP DEVICE MANAGER THE ATI 3D RAGE 2C HAS A YELLOW CIRCLE WITH A BLACK EXCLAMATION MARK. </s>
<s> IN ADD PROGRAMS WIZARD IT SAYS CANNOT START CODE 10. </s>
<s> GOOGLE SAYS CODE 10 IS A REGISTRY ERROR. </s>
<s> MS XP HELP????? </s>
<s> AND SUPPORT????? </s>
<s> INSTRUCT TO GET SP 3, DONE THAT BUT NO IMPROVEMENT. </s>
<s> THE INSTANT THAT I REMOVE THE MSI CARD THIS ERROR INDICATION DISAPPEARS, PUT THE MSI CARD BACK IN AND THE ERROR INDICATION RETURNS. </s>
<s> MS SAYS CANNOT HELP, LOOK ELSEWHERE. </s>
<s> BY SWAPPING MONITORS ON EACH CARD AND CHANGING THE CARD START UP PRIORITY IN BIOS I CAN PROVE THAT BOTH CARDS, CARD SLOTS AND MONITORS ARE ALL FUNCTIONING PERFECTLY, I MUST ASSUME THEREFORE THAT THE MOTHERBOARD IS ALSO FUNCTIONING TO SPEC. </s>
<s> RIGHT NOW I AM AT MY WITS END BECAUSE THESE TWO CARDS WILL NOT WORK AND GIVE ME THE DUAL MONITORS THAT I NEED. </s>
<s> &quot;COULD THIS BE A HYBRID, AGP CIRCUITRY ON A PCI FORMAT CARD AND COULD THIS BE PART OF THE PROBLEM?&quot; I may have missed something in your all capital letter hard to read post. </s>
<s> BUT AGP, PCI, etc is the card format and not the card circuitry. </s>
<s> One thing leads to the other being used. </s>
<s> There is no reason for me to continue on any discussion about this. </s>
<s> It is what it is. </s>
<s> PCI is PCI, AGP is AGP, etc. </s>
<s> It sounds to me like you don't have a hardward issue (this forum's area of discussion) but can't find how to install drivers proper for your system. </s>
<s> For that you often have to research the errors or find someone to install it for you. </s>
<s> I also find some that have not followed the install notes. </s>
<s> We find the antivirus, antispyware, firewalls active during the install and sometimes that interferes which is why you find notes in the install notes about that. </s>
<s> So here we are some posts later and now its revealed you have a working single display system. </s>
<s> That's good so now contact the support desk you use to sort how to install drivers. </s>
