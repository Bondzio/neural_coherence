<s> I've owned the Dell Dimension 4100 I am typing on since 2000 and had very few problems with it. </s>
<s> I also understand the last few years have been a downward spiral for quality and customer service, which used to be their strong suites. </s>
<s> I need a new desktop and wondered if Dell has pulled their heads out of their butts yet to keep other makers like HP from taking away their market share further. </s>
<s> I'm trying to take some of the current bad stuff written about Dell with a grain of salt. </s>
<s> I realize they sell a lot of computers, so they're going to get a larger number of complaints, but percentage of machines sold that are problems are more important than sheer numbers. </s>
<s> Besides, unhappy people are more likely to post than satisfied ones. </s>
<s> Given the state of things here in June 2008, would anyone recommend an XPS 420? </s>
<s> I understand they are supposed to have their own support division. </s>
<s> The market has called for ever lower prices so this means support must transition to non-humans and underpaid staffers. </s>
<s> We also have Windows itself to contend with as it's issues continue to this day. </s>
<s> Then is no panacea and nothing that appears to be changing this trend. </s>
<s> But the hardware looks to be no better or worse than any other maker as I am surrounded by a few hundred dell laptops at the moment. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There are periodically studies/reports of repair rates. </s>
<s> The last I read for desktops had HP/Compaq and Acer/Gateway as top. </s>
<s> They all flip-flop and aren't all that far from each other. </s>
<s> Dell's pretty middle of the pack when it comes to quality. </s>
<s> World-wide they retain good marketshare. </s>
<s> My problems with Dell were more a symptom of being mail-order, getting DOA computer and having to ship it back, wasting a lot of time I didn't have. </s>
<s> The XPS 420 and others in that line impressed me as being pretty complete machines and a good value. </s>
<s> You have to decide on any merits any OEM maker has nowadays. </s>
<s> it changes often and what maybe good to you could easily be offset by another user. </s>
<s> The point being, it really doesn't matter in the long run, so read the fine print and have any problems act on them quickly and note them down. </s>
<s> Often, you can do slightly better buying or doing DIY project or have a 3rd party build one. </s>
<s> The parts are generic enough across the board so buy what best fits your needs As for XPS systems, they are nothing more than warmed over basic systems. </s>
<s> They offer nothing really special other than maybe support and the package deal. </s>
<s> Again, 3rd party builders pretty much offer the system. </s>
<s> If available in your area, Best Buy, Fry's, etc. </s>
<s> offer OEM type systems and at least if a problem crops-up you can return to the store before the real OEM warranty kicks-in. </s>
<s> Heck, even Wal-mart offers systems that have prices hard to beat and offer similar specs as well. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> When I started thinking about a new computer a year or so ago I thought of the DIY route. </s>
<s> I looked over a few tutorials and parts over at Newegg. </s>
<s> I think I could build one just fine, my problem would be being my own Tech Support. </s>
<s> The idea of syncing RAM, configuring a RAID setup, and a couple other things freaked me out a little too. </s>
<s> I may drop into BB and see what they've got. </s>
<s> Another route I thought of was Costco, which sells Dell with I believe a 90 day No Questions return policy. </s>
<s> Given the thread started with concerns about reliability and support, DIY is not a good topic to consider. </s>
<s> If something goes wrong, you're left troubleshooting and putting humpty-dumpty together again. </s>
<s> Best Buy has Geek Squad right there, so they'll be able to help with stuff. </s>
<s> I dunno if they have any XPS 420, but I'm sure they've something comparable in Dell or another brand. </s>
<s> You won't even necessarily pay more than you would for DIY. </s>
<s> But the advantage of DIY is you build it exactly the way you want it, rather than settling for the configurations that are supplied in a store. </s>
<s> My car needed its oil changed. </s>
<s> I know how to change my oil, and could have gone to an auto-parts store. </s>
<s> But instead I went to Jiffy Lube and got some reading done as they did the job in 1/4 of the time it'd have taken me (not to mention I garage-saled my jackstands and all that junk years ago). </s>
<s> http://news.cnet.com/8301-13555_3-9956616-34.html sums this up well. </s>
<s> LOL! </s>
<s> I used to change the oil in my truck every 3000. </s>
<s> Then we bought a 4Runner and my wife wanted to go to a Jiffy Lube type place, so I thought what the heck, one less vehicle to mess with. </s>
<s> Now, with a 3 1/2 year old I love bringing the car into someplace and let someone else climb under the thing, not to mention getting rid of the old oil! </s>
<s> I digress...point well taken. </s>
<s> I just wondered at the beginning what people's experience has been with Dell's quality of hardware and tech support (if needed, and I'm sure with Vista I'll need a little!) </s>
<s> were like in current terms, not the awful stories I heard a year or more ago. </s>
<s> I would probably enjoy a DIY (if I really had the time, but when thiings go wrong is where I know I don't have the time nor expertise. </s>
