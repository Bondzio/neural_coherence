here is the email i sent to western digital during my still on going nightmare with recovering data from my wd mybook essential 160 gb i purchased your product at a reasonable price simply based on the confidence of your slogan &quot;put your life on it&quot;.
according to that hefty tagline i have been dead most of this year.
i am aware that you do not provide support for data recovery and the specialists at cbl have been addressing what should be your problem.
it is incredibly disappointing as a consumer to have this experience, especially when it concerns items of irreplaceable value such as my personal data.
i am eager to hear the response to your $400 mistake.
i basically did nothing to my drive, and suddenly drive became ill with hard drive suddenly fails and now the format is shown as raw in disk management and properties.
diagnostic tests show that the drive is physically fine but the data is &quot;locked&quot; on the drive.
damage to the volume mapping information.
damage to the partition information and structure.
possible file structure damage.
i'm glad i ran into this forum because wd still has a top spot but i refuse to buy another western digital drive!
