i'm using a compaq-presario sr5130nx desktop computer with vista home premium 32 bit.
it came with a tsstcorp cd/dvdw ts-h653l scsi cdrom device (cd-rom drive).
the only problem i have is when i insert a cd with photos on it, and open the folder, the thumbnails appear for a brief instant then turn into the generic icon.
that is the only problem, everything else runs normally.
i have installed every update, all checks of the drive with pc doctor, trouble shooter show &quot;this device is working properly&quot;.
thinking perhaps the cd/dvd rom was defective i installed another device (memorex double layer 16x cd internal cd burner) vista recognized it and installed it using the same drive as the tsst corp cd rom.
i have the same results, a brief appearance of the thumbnails then the generic icon.
when i transfer the folder to my c:drive and open the folder the thumbnails appear normally.
i have made sure that the option for &quot;show icons only&quot; is unchecked.
i have uninstalled and reenstalled the drive to no avail.
i've used system restore but that goes back only 2 days.
one other thing, when i use my photo suite program and open photos from the cd thumbnails show up as they should.
now i have both cd/dvd devices installed and recognized by vista and the problem exists with both of them and both are using the same drive provided by microsoft dated 6/21/2006, version 6.0.6001.18000. once again, the problem does not exist in the c:drive.tia
