1.1.1	Just got a brand new HP pavilian dv5 notebook .	St
1.1.2	everything is fine .	St
1.1.3	except I can hear clock ticking sound from hard drive constantly .	St
1.1.4	it is not exactly one second per click , but very similar .	St
1.1.5	when hard drive is working hard , it makes normal sound .	St
1.1.6	when it is kind of idle , it is ticking .	St
1.1.7	is this normal ?	Ques
1.1.8	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I take it back .	St
1.2.2	I thought when hard drive is working , there is no ticking sound .	St
1.2.3	but I was wrong , i think it is still there , just that normal busy sound of hard drive seems overpowered that ticking sound .	St
1.3.1	and see if the sound is there .	St
1.3.2	If not , continue to boot into safe mode and take a second listen .	St
1.3.3	If the sound is only heard when Windows fully loads , it 's a background process accessing the hard drive .	St
1.3.4	What process that is may not be simple to find .	St
1.3.5	These are n't unusual .	St
1.3.6	Your computer just does n't always sit there and wait for you to input something .	St
1.3.7	It does stuff on it 's own .	St
