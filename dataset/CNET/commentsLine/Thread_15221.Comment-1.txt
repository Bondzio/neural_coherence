hi everyone, i need some info & i hope you all can guide me in the right direction.
i have a thinkcentre pc mt-m running xp pro w/sp2.
it stays on constantly.
i've never had an issue of any kind with it.
no new software or devices have been installed recently & no changes have been made to its power saving settings in any way.
i came down yesterday & noticed it making a boot noise & then, in about 2 seconds would cycle off.
i took off the side cover & noticed the fans would kick on, i could hear my screen get signal & then down it would go.
this repeats continuously.
it has a liteon ps.
any help would be appreciated.
thanks much
