My computer shut down unexpectedly and I caught a whiff of something that smelled like over-heated electrical insulation coming from the power unit. The fan was running OK, and I have since restarted the computer and there seems to be no problem. I looked at the other component and everything else seems to be fine ... CPU, hard drive, etc. That olfactory warning was enough for me! I am going to replace the power unit. I don't want to take any chances. My only question now is about installation. If it is a simple plug-and-go kind of job then I'll tackle it myself. If there is a chance I could really screw things up, then I'd rather pay someone else to do it who knows what they're doing. Should I tackle it myself? If so, should I stick with a 250-max or go higher? What brand gives me the best bang for the buck? What should I be watching out for? Any special tricks to installation? Thanks for your interest and help.

Basically a Power Supply Unti (PSU) is a big metal box (which may or may not fit in your system case : huge problem #1) with a lot of power leads and molex plugs. As long as you plug each device and drive into a molex connector (make sure you buy a PSU with enough plugs : small problem #2), the only thing remaining is to plug the motherboard in. This last step can can be a little problematic (danger Will Robinson DANGER!!!) because modern PSU's actually have a few motherboard power plugs. Often there'll be a secondary small 4 pin block. Some people don't notice this or forget to plug that in if it's required by the motherboard, and the system won't power up without that (possible problem #3). It might be that your motherboard won't need the 4pin one at all too, or may require the use of both aligned into a single larger block. Be careful with this, and look at your old motherboard / PSU connector to make sure the new one is going in with that same wire colour positions etc. Get that wrong and you can easily fry a working motherboard. Speaking of frying. The burning smell might not even be the PSU at all, as it's fan will expel smells from anywhere inside a computer. You can unplug it from all the drives and motherboard and test it ( very carefully ) like this : http://modtown.co.uk/mt/article2.php?id=psumod If it powers up, with no burning smell (cough cough) something else in your PC may be a bit crispy. Good luck, GeeBee.
