Hi, I want to buy a external hard drive, but I have 1 question I am buying the external hard drive for the gameplay video's I make.
I use a notebook, and a notebook doesn't have a big hard drive.
So i want to save the movies directly on my external hard drive.
For a fast transfer I will buy a external hard drive with USB 3.0 Now i want to know if more RPM makes a faster transfer from PC to external hard drive?
Makes 7200 RPM a faster transfer then 5400 RPM?
Greetings, Noobie ^^
