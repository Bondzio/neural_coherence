the solutions i've checked into all use wireless g which would give roughly 200-300 feet between repeaters.
the wireless n routers claim 3x the coverage of wireless g which would give 600-700 feet between repeaters.
this means less equipment would be necessary to cover the same area meaning less cost to deploy, but if im spending more money on wireless n equipment that is only gonna reach 200-300 feet whats the point?
will the wireless repeaters connect to each other using wireless n or wireless g?
does anyone know the answer to this?
