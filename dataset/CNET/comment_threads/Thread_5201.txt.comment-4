I don't have direct experience using audio/video files with Cinavia DRM (...I try to avoid DRM as much as possible) but I think PS3s support Cinavia DRM, so if your DLNA server streams the file to your PS3, it may just work.
I'd try it and see how you go.
If no success, I'd ask the developers of your DLNA server for their help.
