1.1.1	I am looking to buy a new computer and I am wondering what are the best desktop vendors out there ?	Ques
1.1.2	I currently own a computer from CyberPowerInc ( 3 years old ) which has been a great computer overall but their customer service sucks .	St
1.1.3	Still , I have still been unable to beat their prices .	St
1.1.4	Keep in mind , I am not looking to buy a computer that includes Windows or a monitor ( since some vendors make you purchase Windows ) .	St
1.1.5	I am looking in the $ 500- $ 600 range .	St
1.1.6	As a side question , is it worth it to get a AMD 64bit processor now ?	Ques
1.1.7	Also , any recommendations on the best value brands for motherboards , harddrives , DVD burners , ect .	St
1.1.8	are welcome .	Polite
1.1.9	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	You can BUILD a nice machine for 600 bucks .	St
1.2.2	Check www.newegg.com Good AMD ( non 64 ) board would be the shuttle AN35N Ultra Good AMD proc would be the mobile 2600+ ( can easily overclock to 2.5Ghz , which is what mine is at now ) Memory - Mushkin about 79 bucks for 512MB ( get 2 to run in dual channel mode ) Hard drive - any brand should do , get at least 80GB DVD burner - I always recommend Lite On , but newegg has an 8x optorite for about 48 bucks .	St
1.2.3	Video card - cheapest I would get is the 9600pro , mid would range from the 5900xt , 9800pro The motherboard I listed has onboard sound which is fine , and onboard ethernet .	St
1.2.4	The processor lacks a heatsink/fan , so be sure to get one .	St
1.2.5	I have the Thermaltake TR2 from CompUSA for 27 bucks .	St
1.2.6	Benchmarks show my proc beats a 3Ghz P4 EE .	St
1.2.7	I just put the 9600pro into a budget machine for a friend and it ran UT2004 beautifully .	St
1.2.8	I have the 5900xt and it runs Doom3 on high smoothly .	St
1.3.1	There are many places to look .	St
1.3.2	Newegg.com like the other gentleman said but also look at www.pricewatch.com .	St
1.3.3	Look at the barebone packages and add on from there .	St
1.3.4	brand name products are almost double in price for what you get .	St
1.3.5	I would wait another year for a 64 bit .	Sug
1.3.6	the prices will be cut in half .	St
1.3.7	Skip	St
1.4.1	Thank you both , I have been looking at Newegg already but I will check pricewatch as well .	St
1.4.2	Mainly the problem is n't knowing what I want but knowing which are the best but cheap brands .	St
1.4.3	I know I want an AMD , but 32bit vs. 64 bit is in the air .	St
1.4.4	Motherboards I have no idea about .	St
1.4.5	Memory , I assume I should get the PC3200 400Mhz DDR kind .	St
1.4.6	I actually do n't need a video card and choosing a harddrive shouldnt be that hard .	St
1.4.7	Finally , I dont know anything about overclocking and that kind of stuff , but I will check into that & quot ; dual channel & quot ; mode you mentioned about the RAM .	St
1.4.8	Thanks again .	St
1.5.1	What software will you run ?	Ques
1.5.2	For business software , an Athlon XP2600+ would be the best value .	St
1.5.3	If you want to run games , multimedia , CAD , Photoshop , etc .	St
1.5.4	then you should get an Athlon 64. http : //techny.com/articles.cfm ? getarticle=606 & go=0.53769656	Ques
