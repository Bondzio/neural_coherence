You do realize that the System Idle Process is the process for indicating how much of your CPU is not being used right?
And so likely when you are watching it, there aren't other applications using many resources so that isn't the time to watch.
As for the start up, what does it load initially: What firewall, anti-spyware, anti-virus, networking and other services are in that initial start up?
Additionally, you say nothing of what system you are using as it isn't that hard to imagine a rather old system needing a long time to start if it is ~75 processes to start and isn't one of the newer faster models.
