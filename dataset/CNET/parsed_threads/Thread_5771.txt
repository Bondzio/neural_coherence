<s> I want to buy a 17 or 19 in. </s>

<s> What I mean by glossy screen the coating on the screen instead of it being matted, I want it to be glossy. </s>
<s> I know the glossy lcd's are more prone to relecting, but I'm willing to sacrafice that for the better quality screen. </s>
<s> I've found some of those monitors, but I'd like to know all the monitors that are available, so I can compare. </s>
<s> Is there any where I can go that provides this info, or anyone out there willing to tell me. </s>
<s> I've found a few monitors such as the Benq F71V+, and the NEC 1770GX, but I'd like to know all of them. </s>
<s> Such as any samsung models, ect. </s>
<s> I'm looking for an 8ms monitor, preferably the cheaper the better, but price isn't really a factor. </s>
<s> Please help me, and information would be greatly appreciated! </s>
