jose, i do not play games and i do not play streaming movies.
i have never installed a graphics card in any computer i have ever built or bought, and i have never regretted it.
i will not buy a motherboard without onboard graphics for this reason.
in your case however, if you buy your computer and decide sooner or later that you wish to upgrade to a high powered graphics card, nothing will be lost by trying what you have imbedded on the motherboard.
try it and if you want more, just buy a card and install it later.
i am betting that ego will be the only factor that will make you want to upgrade.
if you are someone who just has to have 12 of anything your neighbor has 10 of, you will need a graphics card, otherwise probably no.
