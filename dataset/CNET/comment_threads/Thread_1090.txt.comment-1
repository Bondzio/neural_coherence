On this black friday, I purchased Dell XPS desktop with huge discount.
Almost half price of right this moment's price.
However recently while I am researching about dell computer, I found out that quality of dell computer parts are really low and they are using cheap parts.
Return policy period is not past and I kept every boxes and every parts of set.
Thus I am able to return the product.
Do you guys think that I should return the computer?
