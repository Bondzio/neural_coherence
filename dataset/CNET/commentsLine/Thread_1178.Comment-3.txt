one of those all-in-one copier, scanner, printer, etc., etc.
devices (on a very large scale) that has the ability to be incorporated with an existing network.
in this case, however, i'm completely unfamiliar with how the machine gets configured to talk on the network.
obviously it uses tcp/ip but it must not have the ability to acquire and use a dynamic ip as a windows client would, thus the tech's request for a static ip.
