<s> Hi, I've got 2 two rooms - each with 2 computers and a wired Ethernet hub - interconnected by an Ethernet cable. </s>
<s> I use dial-up from one computer and do not have broadband cable or DSL nor am I really interested in getting either in the near future. </s>
<s> I just got a Wi-Fi capable laptop and thought I'd get acquainted with Wi-Fi access to my wired network. </s>
<s> My first thought was getting a Wireless Access Point, say a Linksys WAP54G, but now I'm confused. </s>
<s> A router, say a Linksys WRT54G, *SEEMS* to have more functionality - 1) a WAP 2) a Hub - with 4 Ethernet ports (???) </s>
<s> 3) a cable/DSL router for *LESS MONEY*, as opposed to a WAP with only 1 Ethernet port. </s>
<s> Am I missing something ??? </s>
<s> Can I really replace a wired hub with the WRT54G and get wired hub functionality AND wireless access to my wired network ? </s>
<s> Thanks in Advance </s>
<s> Its very simple. </s>
<s> If you have a router, you can add a wap. </s>
<s> If not router, the the combo router/wap costs less. </s>
<s> I'm using a 37 dollar dlink (WifiG) from compgeeks for now so I wonder how much cheaper you can go. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> Just checking - so I can replace a wired hub with a, say Linksys WRT54G, router (even tho I currently use dial-up and won't use broadband or DSL access; the wired network is only used basically for back-ups) and will be able to 'talk' to the other wired hub and all other wired computers via wirewless from my new Wi-Fi enabled laptop via the router ? </s>
<s> Regards, Tom </s>
<s> In that case you don't want a wifi router. </s>
<s> You would setup ICS (or such) on a host machine, then run that host's ethernet to some switched hub and then wire an ethernet WAP to the switched hub. </s>
<s> Sorry if I missed you were on dialup. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, No, you didn't miss anything. </s>
<s> I could have clarified better. </s>
<s> For now, I'm perfectly content with dial-up. </s>
<s> And for now I would only want to use the router as a hub for my wired network and as a WAP to connect my new Wi-Fi enabled laptop wirelessly to since I basically just use the wired network now for backups. </s>
<s> But 'down the road' I would still have the router functionality once I decide to get broadband cable or DSL. </s>
<s> (Re dial-up Internet access: For 'grins', I occasionally run PCAnywhere 'host' on one computer to connect to the Internet and then browse from another PCAnywhere 'client' computer via the wired network. </s>
<s> Kludgey and not exactly super fast, but it works ! </s>
<s> Of course, until I get broadband cable or DSL, I'll probably also want to try this wirelessly for 'grins.') </s>
<s> Many thanks, Tom </s>
