I bought a Linksys wireless router about 4 months ago and it worked fine, i used it to get the internet on my laptop. But then, I think it was when I installed McAfee, that the internet stopped working on my laptop. I tryed taking McAffe off and putting it back on, i tryed resetting the router, i tryed repairing the coneections and checking the settings but i have no idea what to do now. The router is a &quot;Linksys Wireless-G Broadband router Model-WRT54G&quot; Any help would be very helpfull. Thanks

If you still cannot connect, try an ethernet cable to the Linksys router and see if you have a connection. If you have a connection to the Linksys router, try updating the firmware and Broadcast SSID. Use WPA security. Rick
