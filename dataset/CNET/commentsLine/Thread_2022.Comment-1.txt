hi there, ever so often my computer would not boot.
when i press the on button the fans would start, the motherboard lights would go on and thats it- no beep, no spinning hdd.
and the light on my webcam woulb be constantly on.
when i press the power button for a few seconds the computer switches off but the webcam still shows the light.
however, when i unplug and plugin the power cable again-everything would boot up o.k.
without any alert messages.
how can i solve this problem?
the computer is home build.
