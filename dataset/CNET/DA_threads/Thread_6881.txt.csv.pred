1.1.1	Hi all , Need some info as to how to reuse an IDE drive w/out wiping it clean and reloading everything .	St
1.1.2	I just replaced my old 40GB IDE drive with a new 250GB SATA drive .	St
1.1.3	Problem is , I have a 120GB IDE drive that was the slave and was used only for storage .	St
1.1.4	My question is , can I just reconnect the 120GB ( left in the & quot ; slave & quot ; configuration ) and keep using it for storage without having to wipe it and if so , how do I go about doing it ?	Ques
1.1.5	Is there a good resource out there that I can reference that will lay it out for me step-by-step ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks in advance .	St

1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	What I would do is install the 250GB SATA drive as the only drive in the computer .	St
1.2.3	Next , perform a clean install your operating system on the SATA drive .	St
1.2.4	During installation , Windows may ask you to press F6 to insert a floppy with a SATA driver -- your computer or motherboard should have come with a driver disk .	St
1.2.5	If not , you should be able to download the driver from your motherboard or computer manufacturer .	St
1.2.6	2 .	St
1.2.7	What is the manufacturer and model name of the 120GB drive ?	Ques
1.2.8	You should be able to find an installation guide for the 120GB HD on the manufacturer 's website .	St
1.2.9	Many hard drives perform better as Masters .	St
1.2.10	I would change the jumper on the pins on the back of the 120GB drive to the master position ( or Cable Select ) and install the drive at the end of the IDE cable .	St
1.2.11	On the HD , there is usually a diagram describing how to jumper it for master , slave , or cable select .	St

1.4.1	The only drive that will be ''wiped '' is the drive on which you install your operating system .	St
1.4.2	That is why I recommended having only the 250GB HD installed when you go to install your operating system .	St
1.4.3	That way , there will be no possibility of losing your storage files by accidentaly installing the operating system on the wrong drive .	St
1.5.1	You da man !	St
1.5.2	Works great !	Polite
