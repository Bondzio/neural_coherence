One of my desktop computers has an adapter which allows it to use a wireless pc card (laptop style). I know desktops usually have either PCI card or USB adapters in them but is there a disadvantage to using the cardbus adapter in the desktop? Also, any opinions on D-Link routers/adapters vs. Netgear? Thanks.
