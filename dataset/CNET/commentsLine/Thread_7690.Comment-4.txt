ddr pc2700 333mhz \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ you mentioned this ram installed, you need more of the same.
i suggest you visit  for a match to your mtrbd.
model and order it.
but, offhand just about any pc2700 should work, just be sure if you can return it if it doesn't as some systems do get picky, epseically if you tweek it too much.
vendors offering pny, specter, or simpletechnology ram will also work.
good luck -----willy
