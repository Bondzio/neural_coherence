1.1.1	I have a western digital 300 gb external hard drive we use as a media center .	St
1.1.2	It is full of music , movies , and tv shows .	St
1.1.3	I went to listen to some music and a message said I need to format the drive .	St
1.1.4	I know formatting will erase everything .	St
1.1.5	I can not do that .	Res
1.1.6	How can I get it to work or at least save everything I have	St
1.2.1	When you post these words in RED help avoid the first questions for needed details .	St
1.2.2	ote : If you 're asking for technical help , please be sure to include all your system info , including operating system , model number , and any other specifics related to the problem .	St
1.2.3	But that error is well known to be caused by bad cables , USB 1.1 ports , the USB ports on the front of machines , missing drivers , XP ( no SP1 or SP2 ) and so on .	St
1.2.4	But since no details are shared I decline from writing all that is possible .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	And possibly there 's some hardware error in the enclosure .	St
1.3.2	I 'd try it first on a different PC , and still another if does n't work there either .	St
1.3.3	Then it becomes time to open it , and put the hard drive in another enclosure to see if it works there .	St
1.3.4	If still not functioning , probably it 's gone south , but it worth the trouble to mount it as a slave in a desktop .	St
1.3.5	If everything fails , it 's time to buy a new one .	St
1.3.6	You can choose then between throwing the old one away or pay a professional data recovery company to get as much data from it as it can .	St
1.3.7	It 's much better to have two ( or three ) copies of everything .	St
1.3.8	Not just one , and certainly not just one on an external drive .	St
1.3.9	The risk of losing it is just too big for most people .	St
1.3.10	In this case , it does n't seem such a big loss : you can simply buy most music and movies again .	St
1.3.11	Re-record a TV-show is impossible , but quite a lot are for sale on DVD .	St
1.3.12	So you lose some money , that 's all .	St
1.3.13	It 's more tragic if the disk contains ( or should I say : contained ) irreplaceable data like the movie you made at your marriage and the thesis you worked on for three years .	St
1.3.14	The principle is known as BACKUP : always have one or two extra copies ( on a hard disk , or on DVD ) of everything you prefer not to loose .	St
1.3.15	Quite simple , in fact .	St
1.3.16	Remember : all hard disks will fail ; the only uncertainty is WHEN that will happen .	St
1.3.17	Might be tomorrow .	St
1.3.18	Might last 20 more years .	St
1.3.19	Nobody knows .	St
1.3.20	Better be safe .	St
1.3.21	Hope this helps .	St
1.3.22	Kees	St
