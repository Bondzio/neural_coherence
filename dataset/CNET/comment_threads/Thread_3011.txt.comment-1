I have vista for os and I have been battling with trying to get the cd to play for 2 days now.
I have gotten the program to appear on the screen but when I push say,+ part one fractions or any of the commands, table of contents..nothing I have installed or tried to upgrade my QuickTime like it instructed but I get an error.500 I changed my default once to try IE and when that didn't work I change the default to Foxfire.
I went and downloaded DirectX Sample browser to tell you the truth I don't know what prompted me to do that, should I uninstall?
I click on computer and right click the DVD Introductory and still no results and I don't know what else to do.
This all for trying to prep for getting into college, scary huh?
I'd give anything to be knowledgable on the computer.
Please help me
