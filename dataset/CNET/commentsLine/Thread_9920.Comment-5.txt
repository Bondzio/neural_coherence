so ... i booted back into windows today, expecting the ps/2 mouse not to work, or my wireless mouse to work (dead battery, i thought).
to my surprise, they both work, and i haven't done anything to actually fix the situation.
but hey, i'm not complaining.
just figured i'd let you all know that this computer is magical, or something.
that, and that it works again.
