1.6.1	I too have experienced the problems you described .	St
1.6.2	Today , 1/31/06 I faxed a four page letter to the CEO , Mark Hurd of HP requesting that they investigate the problems we are all having with the f1503 monitors .	St
1.6.3	I advised him that I am prepared and will file complaints with the State Attorney General office , and the Better Business Bureau , as well have already contacted The Law Firm of Girard Gibbs in San Francisco , who had initiated an investigation into the f1703 issues prior to HP extending the warranty on those models , to open another investigation into the f1503 if they ignore my request .	St
1.6.4	I advised him that there are many of us posting here at CNET with issues on the f1503 so he can not say that they dont know anything about it .	St
1.6.5	In the past I have found this type of action to end in positive results , but if not I will proceed with my complaints .	St
1.6.6	If I get any resolution I will advise Mr. Hurd that I will forward anyones name who is interested in a resolution also .	St
1.6.7	I will be back to let you all know the progress on this nd if its good we can maybe communicate so we all can get our issues resolved .	St
1.7.1	I was on the phone today for over an hour with three different people in India .	St
1.7.2	I guess this is where HP support is located .	St
1.7.3	I was told that there are no problems with the F1503 .	St
1.7.4	I then explained that I have read on the cnet website about many people having this problem with the F1503 .	St
1.7.5	I was told that I should not look for information on any website except the HP website .	St
1.7.6	Please include me on any information that you get .	St
1.7.7	I did have to buy a new monitor just so I can use my computer , but I still want them to fix the problem .	St
1.8.1	I 'm having the exact same problem with my F1503 HP monitor .	St
1.8.2	I think I just am gon na get a new monitor .	St

1.10.1	well , talked to a case manager and after a bunch of circling around the block , I asked if HP was refusing to investigate a consumer complaint to see if any connection existed with the f1703 .	St
1.10.2	The case manager stated that HP was refusing to investigate ... .	St
1.10.3	The Better Business Bureau is forwarding my complaint to HP as we speak , and I am filing a comnplaint with the California State Attorney Generals office in next few days .	St
1.10.4	I also contacted Girard Gibbs Law firm who had previously investigated the f1703 issue and they are looking into opening an investigation into this one .	St
1.10.5	I will keep all advised of progress as I hear back from sources .	St
1.10.6	I also emailed contact 4 , our local television consumer source but not sure if they will pursue .	St
1.10.7	Put it this way ... its not over until the last dance has been danced .	St
1.10.8	Will update soon , hopefully ...	St
1.11.1	I too have the same problem with my F1503 .	St
1.11.2	I wrote to Mark Hurd CEO of HP .	St
1.11.3	I contacted HP support and they gave me one option , buy an upgrade to the 17 '' for a mere $ 259.00 .	St
1.11.4	That 's great ''tech '' support .	Polite
1.11.5	Not really !	St
1.12.1	Well , onto my state attorney general complaint ... .. got ta document this lovely road trip ... .I havent given up yet as there are still a few avenues to go down .	St
1.12.2	Ill keep you all posted ... . What I need from everyone affected by the problems with the F1503 , only if you would be willing , is to email me at hpf1503watchers @ hotmail.com with your first and last name , return email address , how old was the monitor when you started having problems , and did you contact HP .	St
1.12.3	What I am trying to do is document an actual list of people affected so I can validate a problem exists , and so that if I can get some action from HP or someone who can represent us I can make sure that all of us are included in making a choice to pursue .	St
1.12.4	As you all know Hp ignores forums and byline names but real names and email addresses equal real people with a real problem .	St
1.12.5	I will not use the information in any way other than to get an accurate count and if any opportunity presents itself I will email you to explain what the next step maybe and see if you want to continue with the ones who do .	St
1.12.6	Any help you can all give me will just make our case stronger for trying to secure representation or support .	St
1.12.7	my name is ann baldetta and the above email address is strictly for f1503 victims .	St
1.12.8	thanks to all who are out there and dont give up yet , i live about 20 minutes from the palo alto corporate headquarters and if nothing else i may have to drop by and say hi to HP one of these days in person to lodge our complaints .	St
1.13.1	I bought my hp f1503 monitor 1year and 3 months ago and yesterday the screen blacked out .	St
1.13.2	I called HP customer service and was told I would need a new one , it would cost more to repair .	St
1.13.3	So the HP rep proceeded to give me a hard sell for another monitor ( a refurbished one at that !	St
1.13.4	) , even after I told her I just wanted to think a bit before buying another monitor .	St
1.13.5	I think I was transferred around to every HP extension when I began complaining about the monitor being just over a year old and breaking down .	St
1.13.6	I kept asking them , how can I be sure another one of their monitors would not do the same thing after just a years use ?	Ques
1.13.7	I had the feeling I was n't the first to complain about this monitor .	St
1.13.8	Please let me know how it all turns out .	Sug
1.13.9	I am interested in some resolution.I am really unhappy about this and I have always used HP products !	St
1.13.10	Thanks .	Polite
1.14.1	I 'm sharing the frustration of a blackout HP monitor that 's only 15 months old ... After numerous emails , HP is still not willing to replace it , however , with enough of us pursuing them , we will receive recourse soon !	St
1.14.2	In the meantime ... .	St
1.14.3	I took the advice of several other postings and took apart my monitor .	St
1.14.4	I know nothing about motherboards or soldering , but followed the instructions closely and successsfully FIXED the problem while making a cup a tea !	St
1.14.5	Seriously , I 'm just a 30 something , cute girl with blonde highlights and was able to dismantle and correct the blackout .	St
1.14.6	Of course , I blankly stared at the bright , colorful screen for another 20 minutes ; disbelieving that I actually fixed it ! !	St
1.14.7	I 'm tempted to go into biz .	St
1.14.8	reparing these for $ 50 a pop !	St
1.14.9	There 's a couple really good postings ... I used this one : http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7590-0.html ? forumID=67 & threadID=62739 & messageID=1263170 Do n't let this website overwhelm you , but have since found another very detailed one : http : //www.lesliewong.us/blog/ ? cat=4	Ques
1.15.1	& quot ; Edward & quot ; is in the CEO office for quality control and told me today that I am only the 2nd person to complain of a f1503 Blackout ! !	St
1.15.2	( ? ? ? )	Ques
1.15.3	So , let 's all call Edward at 877-917-4380 ext.79 He was actually a very nice sounding person ...	St
1.15.4	I emailed HP CEO Mark Hurd and said that if someone does n't try to rectify this ongoing problem , a class action law suit was in order .	St
1.15.5	I refuse to buy another new monitor for $ 350+ !	St
1.16.1	Anyone/everyone call HP 's CEO office 877-917-4380 and ask for & quot ; Edward & quot ; ext.79 This is the HP Quality Control office and they need to be made aware that more than 2 people have a problem with f1530 !	St
1.16.2	I was actually surprised that someone actually responded to my complaint to CEO Mark Hurd ( via phone !	St
1.16.3	) .	St
1.17.1	THANK YOU !	St
1.17.2	I will call tomorrow , Friday .	St

1.19.1	I have the same problem .	St
1.19.2	First occurred about a week or two ago .	St
1.19.3	Rebooting solved it the last time .	St
1.19.4	No such luck today .	Polite
1.19.5	Since there are so many posts to this forum , it does n't seem to be a case of an isolated bad monitor after all ...	St
1.20.1	Just curious if your monitor was an f1503 or an f1703 ?	Ques
1.20.2	Is there a danger of voiding any Extended Warranty that HP might decide to offer should the troubleshooting attempt go awry ?	Ques
1.21.1	I went ahead and opened the f1503 up and tried to fix it according to what I read here .	St
1.21.2	After a few frustrating hours , I took it to a friend who sometimes works on electronics .	St
1.21.3	He did find one leg that was rather loose , but he also found a couple of resistors that were bad .	St
1.21.4	He gave me the resistor numbers , and I ordered them on the internet for about $ 2 each .	St
1.21.5	A few days later the parts arrived and my friend fixed it ! !	St
1.21.6	!	St
1.22.1	ok ... so maybe not & quot ; easy & quot ; for you , but atleast cheaper than buying a new one !	St
1.22.2	safe to say that none of us will be purchasing HP monitors again ... .	St
1.23.1	I recently had a problem with my monitor as well it is just like all the posts that describe the problem and i did the online help with HP and they basicly said i need to by a new monitor i was not aware of the problem with the 1503 and 1703 until a coworker said somthing to me about how HP replaced his 1703 monitor after he brought it to their attention that he knew that they were having a problem with them .	St
1.23.2	Has there been any results for the 1503 getting replaced or fixed by HP	St
1.24.1	I noticed your issue and thought I would add more info .	St

1.24.3	There are a couple of posts from people that have the VF17 as well .	St
1.24.4	I just got off the phone with HP ( the 877-817-4380 x79 number ) .	St

1.24.7	He said that the 1703 issue was not related to the monitor blacking out .	St
1.24.8	I sent a complaint to the FTC consumer affairs https : //rn.ftc.gov/pls/dod/wsolcq $ .startup ? Z_ORG_CODE=	Ques
1.25.1	VinnyD85 , try this !	St
1.25.2	What I did , and my problem originated from placing in a new harddrive .	St
1.25.3	Wrote down any particular settings like 1024x767 and 60hz .	St
1.25.4	1 ) Uninstalled the video driver for the monitor , and then reloaded from original CD ( no fix ? )	Ques
1.25.5	2 ) Unistalled monitor from the computer ( even disconnected it while powering up ) and then reloaded monitor with CD ( no fix ? )	Ques
1.25.6	3 ) Moved my video card ... jest pressed down on it into the slot to ensure it was seated ...	St
1.25.7	( fixed ! )	St
1.25.8	4 ) Did a few computer updates to ensure monitor would not have the same problem ... worked great then 5 ) Downloaded the most recent driver from ATI Radeon site ( package installer ) as their site does n't have my ATI Radeon 9200 listed ... updated using the full installer and still working great Hope this helps Puddle Jumper	St
