all consumer grade routers have 2 sides, lan & wan.
the lan side is typically a 4 port switch with a virtual ip address that applies to all switch ports.
this interface also acts as a dhcp server.
the wan side gets the public ip address from the isp using pppoe or dhcp typically.
the wan interface runs nat (network address translation).
it convrts your lan addresses into the one public ip address and keeps track of the sessions.
nat is what allows you to share the internet connection with multiple computers.
one side effect of nat is security.
the nat implemented in consumer routers is referred to as many to one nat.
outbound from the lan has no issues.
but incomming traffic can only return to the proper computer if an outbound session was already created.
if i try to connect to your network then my session will terminate on your router.
your router has no idea where to forward the traffic.
you could direct ftp traffic to a specific machine or telnet traffic but this is good for only one pc.
if you can turn off nat you may get this to work.
or replace the router with a switch if you can.
