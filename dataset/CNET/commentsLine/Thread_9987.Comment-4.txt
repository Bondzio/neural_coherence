have you log in.
let's say you log in as &quot;dudley&quot;.
now when you want to print to another machine's printer, &quot;dudley&quot; must have an account on the other machine.
plus all the other things that need to be right as well.
simple test for that.
go to the other machine, log off and can &quot;dudley&quot; log in with the same name and password as the other machine?
