All SATA connections are &quot;masters.&quot; I am able to use both since my BIOS allows it to fake a sata connection as an IDE one. As I answered the first time, I can do this and do. If you need to convert the sata to ide or vice versa there are cheap adapaters (I use those too!) to do that. Bob

It's not a matter of master or slave but the Windows installation. -&gt; I noted that many machines have a way to emulate IDE devices that are actually attached with SATA. Your posts are void of any details that I could use to tell you if your machine has such a feature. But you can check your manuals in the BIOS section to see if it can do that. Here's an SATA to IDE adapter if you can't -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CX-STI1001&cat=CCD Bob
