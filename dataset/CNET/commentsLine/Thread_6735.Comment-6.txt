if you see this i'm trying you help you (do not buy any emachine pc), they are junk!
there junk right out of the box i have never had more problems with a computer and its service if you have one or just got one take it and get your money back.
i've had it for three months now and have not been able to use it yet i have a small home business and thought getting a faster pc would help but buying this pace of sh_t was a bad idea.
and the customer service is a joke (no idea what there talking about).
like others my pc just reboots at any given time and customer service has no clue.
ive tried reinstalling, replacing the power supply and noting works.
they try to sell me the extended service pack but why buy that when the thing isnt working now?
i will do all i can to tell every one i can not to buy an emachine.
