<s> I have an Emachine T3112 AMDSempron Processor 3100+; 1.80 GHZ, 1600 MHZ FSB; 256 KB L2 Cache; 80 GB HD; 256 MB DDR Memory (plan to upgrade this to a gig soon) current video card is a S3 Unichrome 3D with an AVG slot available. </s>
<s> 56K Modem. </s>
<s> Am running Windows XP Home Edition Version 2002 with Service Pack 2. </s>
<s> I believe the graphic card shares memory as I only show 192 or ram. </s>
<s> I read the CPUs on the Emachines are crap with low wattage(wish I had known that before I bought it.) </s>
<s> What I am looking for is advice on purchasing a gaphic card that will allow me to do some gaming without straining this machine. </s>
<s> I would be satisfied to play older games if needed. </s>
<s> Would a card like Nvidia 5500 be okay for this computer? </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>
<s> Any and all help will be very appreciated. </s>
<s> Like I cited above I plan on adding ram to the machine before installing a new card. </s>
<s> Thanks, Maxy </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com Lots of video cards, APG and PCIe, to choose from. </s>
<s> Once you narrow it down...double check the PSU requirement and go from there. </s>
<s> Re RAM...check you system DOCs carefully and by all means look at sites like CRUCIAL.COM. </s>
<s> Sometimes it best to add RAM in pairs to maximize system performance. </s>
<s> Before you go too far...check to see if buying a new unit may be better/cheaper than upgrading...adding RAM, adding new video card and maybe a new PSU. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Yes it is a Sempron which is the stripped down AMD CPU, just as a Celeron is a stripped down Pentium. </s>
<s> They run just fine for most applications [the majority of low priced systems use Celerons or Semprons. </s>
<s> Yes more memory should be a big help. </s>
<s> Do you mean that an AGP slot for a video card [not AVG] is available. </s>
<s> If so great, but don't get confused that most new video cards are PCI Express. </s>
<s> Check your BIOS if you can disable the onboard video, thus witha plug in card you will get the shared memory back also. </s>
<s> I appreciate your feedback. </s>
<s> Even though Crucial says I can add different size memory modules side by side I will probably match them. </s>
<s> BTW are they a reputable company in your opinion? </s>
<s> I know Pitstop recommends them. </s>
<s> This computer is only about a year old and except for gaming has served me okay. </s>
<s> Needs more ram but other than that no major complaints so I am by no means ready for a new machine yet. </s>
<s> I think what I probably meant to ask in my last post was: What is a good graphic card upgrade for the Emachine T3112 based on the specs and information I have included? </s>
<s> I just double checked and it says AGP slot available. </s>
<s> As far as the CPU on this machine I guess I was just relating stuff I had read on other forums. </s>
<s> Believe me I'm no expert on computers. </s>
<s> If I was I wouldn't be asking so many questions. </s>
<s> LOL. </s>
<s> Would you be kind enough to tell me how to check the Bios to see if the card can be disabled? </s>
<s> I have never ventured in there. </s>
<s> And, thanks for your feedback. </s>
<s> that EMachines use to get into the BIOS. </s>
<s> It varies. </s>
<s> The option only happens during early parts of the booting process. </s>
<s> Many computers show a message &quot;to enter set-up&quot; hit {they then give the name of the key]. </s>
<s> As an example for most non proprietary computers it is the DEL key. </s>
<s> Hopefully the manual will tell you what key to hit and when. </s>
<s> Surely someone else in these forums will know. </s>
<s> Just realize that even though the actual function you want is set-up, it is usually referred to as the BIOS or as the CMOS. </s>
<s> They're really slightly different terms but not worth worrying about is you get into that Place. </s>
<s> LOL </s>
<s> the emachines web site does not indicate any graphics slot is available for the T311x series. </s>
<s> http://www.emachines.com/support/product_support.html?cat=Desktops&subcat=T-Series&model=T3112 for other models, such as the T312x series, it does indicate if a slot is available. </s>
<s> If you are getting the bug for gaming, better to plan to build a new system. </s>
<s> As mentioned ading a high power video card may require increasuing the Power Supply capability, and then going to the AMD Athlon CPU and on and on. </s>
<s> Then cooling problems arise within the small case. </s>
<s> In this case the lower power consuming Sempron is an asset, but for higher level gaming a detriment. </s>
<s> Gaming and Video processing place the greatest demands on computers, thus low price and power are at odds, although there are now some fairly good gaming systems available for $800 or so. </s>
<s> The specs are printed on the outside of the tower right below the power button. </s>
<s> It says AGP slot available underneath the video information. </s>
<s> I will research that. </s>
<s> Now I remember the DOS screen when I boot up so that is where you would get that information huh? </s>
<s> I really just want a video card that this machine can handle. </s>
<s> I don't expect to be able to play the newest and most graphic intense games. </s>
<s> I'd be happy to play some of the older classics. </s>
<s> don't waste money on the fx series. </s>
<s> get a geforce 6 or 7 series or a radeon x15xx or better. </s>
<s> $120: geforce 7600gs http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814121020 $115: radeon x1650pro (rebate available, recommended) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814161053 $110: geforce 6800xt (rebate available) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814141038 $90: radeon x1550 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102081 $56: geforce 6200 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814127268 </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I will research these cards. </s>
<s> Appreciate your help a lot. </s>
<s> if you buy from them for your exact PC....they guarantee compatability. </s>
<s> There are other sources that carry RAM from Crucial too....like Newegg.com. </s>
<s> Re the GPU....Did you look at Tomshardware.com ????? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I am going to put in order for ram at crucial tomorrow. </s>
<s> Even though they sayI can mix sizes I think I will get a set just in case. </s>
<s> Tomshardware was super interesting. </s>
<s> I put the link in favs. </s>
<s> Thanks for helping me. </s>
<s> I just want to make the right decision and not buy a card that is too strong for my small computer. </s>
<s> If the card is better than I have I will be happy. </s>
<s> Have a good night. </s>
<s> Catch ya later. </s>
