hey everybody i'm a newbie on these forums.
i was on cnet live today.
they directed me here.
i called in asking about wanting to build a system now with one hard drive, but later as my budget allows add additional hard drives in a raid array.
the only way i know how to do this is to reinstall the os and start from scratch.
is there a way to streamline this process so i can add drives and not lose my data or rebuild the array every time?
