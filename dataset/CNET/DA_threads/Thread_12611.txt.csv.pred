1.1.1	I am looking into a new computer around Christmas time .	St
1.1.2	One is an Emachines while the other is an HP .	St
1.1.3	If I get the E-machines , I will upgrade the video card from a Radeon X200 to a 9600 .	St
1.1.4	I am having doubts because some of my classmates say I am better off building one than work with an Emachines .	St
1.1.5	But I did my homework and found out they are really good computers .	St
1.1.6	I was wondering I should even bother upgrading it or give it a shot and see what I come up with .	St
1.2.1	A very humble PC by today 's standards .	St
1.2.2	I guarantee that if I knew then what I know now , I 'd definitely build one .	St
1.2.3	When I bought the Emachines I knew nothing about PC tech .	St
1.2.4	It got me started , though .	St
1.2.5	You could build a nice little PC for about the same cost as buying a fully assembled PC and still have a better and more powerful system .	St
1.2.6	My advice would be to build one .	Polite
1.2.7	Rely on this forum for help .	St
1.2.8	This is one of the best , if not the best , forums on the World Wide Web .	St
1.2.9	If you do build a PC , make certain you stick to basics and buy the least expensive parts you can .	St
1.2.10	Once you get past this , you 'll be building screaming demons .	St
1.3.1	For the most part , you can always upgrade , why the rush .	St
1.3.2	At least see what the eMachine is putting out before getting into a upgrade mode .	St
1.3.3	Just get a feel for it , if an upgrade is needed then by all means upgrade .	St
1.3.4	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	new comps .	St
1.4.2	come with pci-express x16 since all new cards are made for pci-express x16 only	St
1.5.1	It all depends on how much you want to spend .	St
1.5.2	If you want a lower cost system , go with the eMachines .	St
1.5.3	If you want to get better quality , build your own ... if you have lots of self-control .	St
1.5.4	I thought I 'd build my own , then started planning the system out .	St
1.5.5	It only costs a few dollars more to get this better motherboard , and the better case , and the better video card , and the better ... get the idea ?	Ques
1.5.6	All those just a few dollars more add up ... and fast .	St
1.5.7	Before I knew it , I was spending double what the eMachines cost me .	St
1.5.8	Sure it was a better system ... had what I wanted in it , and would have cost even more to buy it completed if I could find one like it .	St
1.5.9	If money was no question , I 'd have built my own ... money was tight , I bought eMachines and am upgrading at my pace .. well ... as money allows .	St
1.5.10	As for the video card , you 'd want PCI-e over AGP anyway ... twice the data bus , over twice the speed .	St
1.6.1	Take a piece of advice ... Emachines and HP 's are VERY proprietary ( also Dell , Gateway , etc ) .	St
1.6.2	Here 's some things to think about : Standard ( built ) computers have at least a 300 W power supply .	St
1.6.3	These ( emachines and HP ) have about 200 or LESS in general .	St
1.6.4	Put a high end video card in there and the power supply may pop like a fire cracker .	St
1.6.5	These manufactures usually use the cheapest , sorriest , most proprietary junk they can find .	St
1.6.6	They also load the hard drives up with so much junk that you have about 1 % of system memory usable after loading all the garbage .	St
1.6.7	Example ... My Fiance has a Dell with 2.5 GHz Intel , 1GB ram , Gforce video card .	St
1.6.8	I built mine with an Athlon 3200 ( 1.8GHz ) , 1GB ram , ATI Radeon 9600 .	St
1.6.9	Well ... .My computer runs about 30 % faster than hers .	St
1.6.10	The first thing to learn about computers is the & quot ; store bought ones & quot ; are absolute garbage .	St
1.6.11	I 'm not sure where you did your homework that told you that the emachines are good .	St
1.6.12	Maybe they 're good compared to HP or other store bought or Dell machines .	St
1.6.13	However , that would be like comparing a pinto with a duster .	St
1.6.14	Comparing store bought with one you build is like comparing a pinto with a ferrari Testarosa .	St
1.7.1	Most manufactuers arre going away from proprietary parts .	St
1.7.2	Except dell , with their stupid btx cases/psu/etc ... Emachines are very upgradeable and hardly has any spyware or adware when out of th ebox .	St
1.7.3	As for hP/compaq , definitely opposite .	St
1.7.4	Sonys are okay .	Polite
1.7.5	Gateways are good .	Polite
1.7.6	DELLs , nope , i would n't buy if possible .	St
1.7.7	BTW oems use pretty good parts that are off-the-shelf , but usually modified in that certain features are disabled .	St
1.7.8	ROger	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	The eMachines T6524 came with a 300W power supply .	St
1.9.2	Of course , that is still not enough to run the new high end video cards .	St
1.9.3	I had to upgrade the psu for the ATI Radeon X800XL I added to my system .	St
1.9.4	Proprietary ?	Ques
1.9.5	Not any longer .	St
1.9.6	The MB is an OEM version made by MSI , granted a low end version , but used by at least eMachines , HP , and Compaq ( yeah , same as HP , I know ) in their systems .	St
1.9.7	But it is still a 939 Socket MB and includes a PCI-e slot , 4 RAM slots , an open drive bay , 3 open pci slots ... very upgradable , a good starting point .	St
1.9.8	As for junk on the hard drive ... nothing Add/Remove Programs could n't resolve .	St
1.10.1	i got a t6212 in may from emachines ... .upgraded the ram to 1.5 gb , disabled the onboard video and added a geforce 6600 ( its all i need for the games i play ) , cleaned out the & quot ; crap & quot ; i dont need from the hard drive , bought anti-virus , d/l spybot , adaware and spywareblaster , and my machine flies without problems .	St
1.10.2	and emachines does use decent , not great , hardware .	St
1.10.3	but for the money and self-upgrading , i would not recommend anything else .	St
1.10.4	also , i have never had a problem burning cd 's , dvd 's .	St
1.10.5	jimmy	St
