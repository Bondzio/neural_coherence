my windows 2000 machine had service pack 1, i upgraded to service pack 4 just before i hooked up my external hd.
i downloaded the service pack from windows website.
are there other patches that i need to install?
is there an easy way to find the correct patch that i need?
the machine came with 2 usb1.1 ports but i recently installed a usb2.0 pci card to take advantage of my new drive's usb2.0 connectivity.
i will try hooking the external hd to a usb1.1 drive.
as for the windows xp machine, it only has usb2.0 ports.
i did windows update a few days before i hooked up my external hd.
however, windows still says the device is in use or busy when i try to disconnect it.
what information would help diagnose my problem?
i thank you so much for your help and patience.
