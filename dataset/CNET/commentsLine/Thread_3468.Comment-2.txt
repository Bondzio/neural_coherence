while manufacturer's warrant drives with 3 or 5 year pro-rated replacement, your comment about naked and ventilation amused me.
i use an hp cto with seagate st31000528as (3 year warranty)drive.
it has been &quot;on&quot; for 2 years now 24/7.
i do ulitize seagate disk wizard to clone the drive every 2-3 monthes to three matching st31000528as drives, rotating them.
no problem with the drives.
my means of cloning involves an esata docking station made by azio.
although the drive is exposed, i still mounted a 4&quot; fan shroud (at 6vdc @ 100ma) to cool the drive.
that was because i noticed the drive was hotter during continued writes over 20 minutes.
the reduced voltage allows me to have the docking station on my computer desk, and not have to listen to the fan roar.
