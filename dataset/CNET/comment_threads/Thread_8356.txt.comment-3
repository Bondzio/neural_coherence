Thanks for your reply.
I had, however, disabled the firewalls on both computers.
A search of the net found other issues relating to connectivity such as trying to network more than one operating system, but nothing for two XP Home units.
I have a bit of mistrust for Dell.
Could there be some proprietary blocking done for purposes of security or something?
Any other ideas?
Thanks Brett
