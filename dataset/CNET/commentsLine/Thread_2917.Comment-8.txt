there are devices that can do that.
see here, for one that is fairly modern:  here is a cnet article but they are all old devices now:  of course, one could always pay someone else to do the conversions.
depending on where you live, the local drug store may provide that service on a &quot;per tape&quot; basis.
and, if you are not allergic to using ebay, you might find a device that someone bought to do vhs tapes and got theirs all done and now offer the device for sale.
