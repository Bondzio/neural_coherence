i have a dead seagate external drive, 300 gb...have it daisy-chained to a buffalo nas and use it for music/photos backup.
before the afforementioned dying of the hard drive, i would occasionally lose connection to the drive and have to restart both the nas and hd.
one night, i was moving data that was on a dvd over to the seagate and it apparently crashed in the middle of the night.
i was not able to regain connection when i restarted the drives.
on top of that, i am unable to power down the seagate and i do not hear any harddrive spinning whatsoever.
have talked to seagate support and they suggested different cords, etc, but the fact is, it won't power down or spin.
it's under warranty, but, of course, the data is not and would cost upwards of $500 to recover if i use their data recovery service.
the drive wasn't that expensive and i'm a little wary of going with whatever refurbed drive they would send me.
is there any way i can crack the case (break warranty) and try to hook up the hd like i would an internal drive?
sorry for the long message, and thanks!
(run windows xp, had to format the seagate so that the buffalo drive would see it, showed up as usbdisk1).
