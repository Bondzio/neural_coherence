<s> Hi, with the help of someone on this site as well as a few other people I have recently purchased a new desktop pc. </s>
<s> I have not purchased a monitor yet and I don't really know much about them. </s>
<s> I have narrowed down the monitors I want to 2 choices. </s>
<s> This is the first monitor. </s>
<s> This is the second monitor. </s>
<s> They are nearly an identical price so I am not worried about that part. </s>
<s> I just need to know which one is better. </s>
<s> Also if someone knows of a better monitor to get for around $200CAD or less please let me know. </s>
<s> (keep in mind I am from Canada) If you are interested, here is the computer the monitor will be hooked up to. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for anyone that can help me with this. </s>
<s> to the first and second monitor don't work. </s>
<s> They go back to your post. </s>
<s> Please try again with a better link (no quotes in it) and - before posting - try on the preview page if they really work. </s>
<s> Also tell what you want to use the monitor for. </s>
<s> For example: gaming, viewing HD video, office work, graphic design etc. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> This way, no links to fail. </s>
<s> There may be reviews on these but as it stands I think the best review is in a store where I can look at the displays. </s>
