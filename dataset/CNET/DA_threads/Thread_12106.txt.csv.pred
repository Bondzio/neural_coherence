1.1.1	I use nero burning rom with win 98 and a tdk cdrw121032 I've got no problems burning data cds, but lately I cannot burn an audio cd from mp3s or wav.	St
1.1.2	The process halts 2-5% into the burning.. right as the disc seems to be spinning for the first time.	St
1.1.3	When burning data(or audio when it used to work) there's a pause here, and burning commences.	St
1.1.4	Attempting to burn an audio disc, everything stays put and the drive, program, sometimes the whole computer locks up if I try to cancel.	St
1.1.5	If I leave it spinning for 15 minutes, I come back to an error message indicating a SCSI/IDE problem..	St
1.1.6	I'm obviously not very keen on the subject.. Any suggestions?	St
1.1.7	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	I have seen cases where data or music burning stops working, and shortly after the drive stops all together.	St
1.2.2	You might try getting one of the CD cleaning kits, see if that helps.	Sug
1.2.3	Usually replacing the drive resolves this, and drives have gotten quite inexpensive.	St
