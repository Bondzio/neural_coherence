<s> I had to reset my Netgear Router. </s>
<s> Now the wireless is turned off. </s>
<s> I need to configure/setup the router without the internet. </s>
<s> The setup CD seems to require internet access. </s>
<s> Is there a way to connect my computer to the router without connecting to the internet? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help! </s>
<s> Don't get confused by the way you address a router -- the setup pages are in firmware in the router -- not on the internet. </s>
<s> Log in to your router via Internet Explorer (or similar) using its IP address -- usually 192.168.0.1 but see the manual for precise details of default IP address and Username Password for accessing interface pages. </s>
<s> I tried without the cd. </s>
<s> Default IP is 192.168.1.1. </s>
<s> It said it couldn't find that address. </s>
<s> I tried www.routerlogin.net. </s>
<s> Couldn't find that either. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Link up computer/router by ethernet cable. </s>
<s> Go Start, All Programs, Accessories, Command Prompt At the black and white screen type IPCONFIG /ALL this will show you the IP address of all connections including the gateway which whould be the address of the router. </s>
<s> Failing that you could press reset button on router to get it to revert to factory default IP address -- but this may default all other settings in the router too. </s>
