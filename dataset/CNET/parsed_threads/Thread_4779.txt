<s> Just bought a new T6212 and I have a question concerning DVD playback. </s>
<s> What should my expectation be on the quality of playing a DVD movie on this computer? </s>
<s> I have a 17&quot; CRT monitor and usually maximize the screen. </s>
<s> Should it be just as good as watching it on TV? </s>
<s> (Probably not) The picture does show some low resolution, not real bad, but somewhat noticeable. </s>
<s> Also when the scene has some fast action to it, there is some &quot;blur&quot; that occurs. </s>
<s> I have adjusted a number of settings with no real improvement. </s>
<s> What could be done to improve this so that the playback is DVD quality? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I just bought the same machine from Circuit City. </s>
<s> (T6212) The first thing I noticed was that the 512 MB of RAM was registering as only 384. </s>
<s> The reason was that the video card shares memory so right off the bat 128 MB went to the graphics. </s>
<s> I went to Newegg and picked up an Abit 256 MhZ graphics card (make sure you get one with a PCI-Express connection) and (1) the graphics improved and (2) now all 512 MB of memory is dedicated to the processor. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> What is your experience playing a DVD using both PowerDVD and Windows Media Player. </s>
<s> Have you noticed the same thing or did adding the graphics card solve the problem? </s>
<s> the ati x200 integrated graphics are adequate for dvd playback. </s>
<s> Even if u upgrade graphics card, it'll probably show little or no difference. </s>
<s> Also the quality of the image is also from monitor so good monitor also produces good images. </s>
<s> unless ure in gaming, i would not suggest getting a gfx card. </s>
<s> if u still want to upgrade the gfx card, i would go for a nvidia 6200 or radeon x300. </s>
<s> both are adequate for everyday applications and are pretty decent with new games on like super low settings. </s>
<s> However they are good for playing older games. </s>
<s> As nerdyboy said, you wouldn't see a difference upgrading your video card. </s>
<s> With a good monitor your picture should be just as sharp as what you see on a tv. </s>
<s> Your monitor should have atleast a 12ms pixel-response time for good movie viewing. </s>
