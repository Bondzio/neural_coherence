They have a reputation in making computer hardware such as motherboards, and they are one of the best at what they do. They now make computers, so I have nothing but high expectations from their computers as well. They know their stuff. I would choose an ASUS computer over HP/Compaq, Dell, Acer. They are all garbage. HP and Dell are so bad! Source(s): I have done computer repairs for a while, hp and dell are so bad
