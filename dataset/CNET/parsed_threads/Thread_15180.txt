<s> Just got in for $499. </s>
<s> Everything looks great so far. </s>
<s> I added a ATI Radeon x800 XL PCIe, and that is working great (wish that card had 2 DVI ports though). </s>
<s> Got 2 x 1GB 400DDR PC3200 memory sticks. </s>
<s> Haven't received just yet. </s>
<s> The MOBO appears to be MSI. </s>
<s> Logitech Z-2300 speakers are on the way also. </s>
<s> Now for the fun stuff: I am going to swap the hard drive with the two other drives from my older computer. </s>
<s> I am going to move my ATI HDTV tuner from the old computer to the T6212. </s>
<s> Several questions: 1. </s>
<s> Do I need additional PS wattage? </s>
<s> The one in the box is 300W (or 350, I forgot but I am pretty sure it is 300) 2. </s>
<s> Sounds like I can't overclock the PC but can I overclock my ATI graphics card? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> What happens to the integrated memory set aside for the graphics now that I have my own card? </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> I can merge two monitors together using the DVI and VGA port on the ATI card but the quality drops (1280x???) </s>
<s> instead of 1920x1200. </s>
<s> Is there any way possible that I can have the two monitors setup on the same machine and use one screen for the PC and use the other screen for TV viewing? </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> With 4 slots for memory, I am hoping that I can throw the 2 sticks of 1GB with the other 2 slots that are filled with 2 x 256 for a total of 3GB??? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> YES you do need to buy a new power supply. </s>
<s> x800xls require at least 350w. </s>
<s> look at antec, ocz, or enermax. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> NO you cannot oc your cpu, YES you can the gpu. </s>
<s> i used ATi tool, free download, for easy oc. </s>
<s> 3. it shouldn't decrease any memory from your main memory if you have your onboard graphics disabled. </s>
<s> check your system properties to make sure. </s>
<s> 4. yes you can use two monitors. </s>
<s> thats all i know for that ? </s>
<s> lol 5. just stick with 2 sticks of 1GB. </s>
<s> dual channel will do the rest konny </s>
<s> How do I know which PSU I should get? </s>
<s> Do I need additional cooling? </s>
<s> I could always go to 4GB of RAM </s>
<s> Doubt you need additional cooling, you could get any psu with the proper number of pins in your mobo. </s>
<s> Get something with at least 18A on +12V. </s>
<s> 400watt or higher. </s>
<s> As for whther it'll fit, i dk, you might want to take measurements Roger </s>
<s> &quot;How do I know which PSU I should get?&quot; what damasta55r said and make sure it is an ATX power supply. </s>
<s> i believe emachine has a regular ATX power supply so that should be fine. </s>
<s> look for dual fans and or one 120mm fans inside the psu. </s>
<s> this will prolong the life of it and also help remove heat from your case so that you dont need additional cooling. </s>
<s> personally, i recomend this model, as its in my machine now and has been running with NO problems for over 5 months now. </s>
<s> http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=20480 also check enermax and ocz, but the above would be my choice. </s>
<s> (bestbuy, newegg, and frys carry this) konny </s>
<s> You need memory that can handle over clocking otherwise you can burn out the sticks as well as fry the cpu. </s>
<s> Also if you are going to replace the HD Drive go with a SATA Drive and set up a raid system using EID HD </s>
<s> Well, I wish I had a different drive. </s>
<s> I ghosted my old drive to the emachines installed drive (Seagate 160MB) and now I get a hal.dll missing error when the PC boots up. </s>
<s> I tried just copying the new hal.dll overwriting the hal.dll but no luck. </s>
<s> Should of expected this. </s>
<s> I don't want to do a new install of Windows because I don't have the disks and don't have CD's for most of my apps. </s>
<s> I tried editing the boot.ini file but no luck there either. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> If you're planning to stick with your Current Processor you don't need a new PSU. </s>
<s> The X800XL Uses very low energy (like 60watts). </s>
<s> go check out the X800XL online. </s>
<s> My Friend has a 250watt(or 270Watt cheap PSU) PSU; he got an X800 overclocked with a 3500+ and 768RAM, no cooling except CPU/Heatsink, 1 double layer cd/dvd combo and last but not least, a 120GB HD. </s>
<s> NO PROBLEMS AT ALL. </s>
<s> His computer doesn't get very hot, sometimes very warm. </s>
<s> Google the X800XL yourself and find out. </s>
<s> I have a T2542 (don't laugh), ran disk clean up with every thing selected and after a restart, i can't boot but restore my computer using the CD that was supplied. </s>
<s> (I did exactly the CNET weekend Project told me) </s>
<s> An X800 is different from the x800xl. </s>
<s> Suggest you get at least 350watts. </s>
<s> If you have very little things to powere, you may get away with it. </s>
