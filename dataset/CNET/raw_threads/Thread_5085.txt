He is using DSL, does not have a separate fax/modem. He was told the 2710 does not need a fax/modem. Does anyone have any experince with the HP 2710? How would you rate it? I have heard that Canon printers are much cheaper to operate due to cheaper ink. Does Canon make a similar combo unit? Thanks Ben

I suspect, without knowing the age of your son, that you can find a piece of equipment that does what your son need without paying 399. If you have any direct questions please feel free to write me at lchet_2000@yahoo.com
