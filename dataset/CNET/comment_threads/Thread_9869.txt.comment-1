Hello, I just wired each room with 3 cat5e cables (2 for internet and the other cat5e cable to wire 2 telephone lines), 2 rg6 cables.
all this wire terminates in one location in the basement where I am going to make all my connections.
I thought I would wire all my cat5e connections to a patch panel, but that does not seems to be all that I need to make all the connections work.
Do I need a switch?
I take my connection out of the modem an run it into the switch?
Managed/unmanaged switch...I assume unmannaged.
I will be connection to Comcast internet...something else I need?
For Cable, I just run my source signal into a splitter and then make all my connections to the other end of the splitter?
Something else I should consider?
