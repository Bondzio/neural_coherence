I loosened the screws on the card except for the 4 in the centre.
These 4 screws are inside a square which is drawn on the card.
I suspect they hold either the GPU or the heatsink to the card.
I didnt risk undoing them in case I couldnt get the plastic cover off and left something loose inside.
Which is what happened even after removing the other screws the plastic wouldnt move at all.
I can send you some pictures I took of the card so maybe you can advise me further.
