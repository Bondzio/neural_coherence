<s> Hello, I am looking to buy the hardware for a Pentium based system to build myself. </s>
<s> This system should include components that are great for gaming. </s>
<s> I am looking for suggestions, any at all are helpful! </s>
<s> Please include the type of Pentium processor, motherboard, video card, and RAM. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Use an AMD CPU socket 939 based system. </s>
<s> The person I am having it built for prefers Pentium to AMD, and is very stubborn on this issue. </s>
<s> I use an AMD myself, and love it. </s>
<s> check out AMD's offerings especially the Athlon 64 X2 line because it DESTROYED Intel's &quot;dull&quot;-core CPUs in CNETs test, check it out for yourself: http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-10442_7-6389077-3.html?tag=lnav </s>

<s> 6800gs? </s>

<s> or gtx? </s>
<s> i would suggest the 6800gs. </s>
<s> it is about $200 and can play modern games relatively well at high settings and will last a while. </s>
<s> the 6800gt is around $250 for a small performance boost. </s>
<s> the 7800gtx is more like 450 usd and i dont think u would want 1/2 of the computer budget to be only the graphics card. </s>
<s> 7800 gt is better value for a 1000 doller rig its only 90 buks more for almost 2 times the gaming pefromice </s>
<s> plz do your self a favor get sli nothing lower for gaming the best either the asus a8n sli delux or the asus a8n-32 sli delux </s>
