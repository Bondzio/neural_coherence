all i can write in my defense is i've been hit with that a few too many times.
with &quot;the arts&quot; (sorry if using quotes seems to upset folk) changing media over the years maybe what is needed is some national endowment for the arts to promote the development and subsidy of the things that these artists want.
and again, keep writing the folk that do those reviews.
here it's a discussion forum and i don't see the reviewers to chime in.
