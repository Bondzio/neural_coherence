Hi To merge a windows partition that has already had the windows os removed.
Goto on your mac partition utilities &gt;&gt; Disk Rtility then click the windows partition.
Click Erase tab and select &quot;MS-DOS(FAT)&quot; and name it untitled.
Then goto Bootcamp and the installer will allow you to erase partition and merge it with exsisting Mac osX Partition.
WARNING: ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE MERGING, FORMATING OR INSTALLING AN OS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PARTITION.
