when i first installed the drive it worked, but wasn't rw now it wont even read the values of the disk.. always reports 0 freespace 0 used... it not the hw... ubuntu sees it and functions normally.. so i'm assuming microsoft has somehow disabled these drives... help us fix this.. this drive is not cheap.. back in the day it was over $250 and since sony no longer makes them.. the prices go higher today..
