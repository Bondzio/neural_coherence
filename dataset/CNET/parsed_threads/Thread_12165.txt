<s> I have a laptop, and I'm just beginning to realize how inconvenient having only a touchpad is. </s>
<s> I need a mouse. </s>
<s> I see all these mice, great scores, by the reviews very comfortable, precise, etc. </s>
<s> Then I see notebook mice. </s>
<s> These never get as high a rating as the 'regular' mice and are usually said to be less ergonomic than full-size. </s>
<s> I use my laptop a lot, and I would like to be as comfortable as possible. </s>
<s> Can I get a full-size, regular mouse like the Logitech MX1000 or do I have to buy a mouse that has the word 'notebook' in the product name? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The only difference is that notebook mice are built for portability. </s>
<s> They are usually simpler, slightly smaller, and ''fold up.'' </s>
<s> That is, the cord will fit into an internal chanber, the wireless adapter will slide in and out of a slot, etc, making it easy to carry with you. </s>
<s> However, if portability isn't an issue, and comfort and functionality/abilities are, you can use any other mouse on the market, including the MX1000. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
<s> I highly reccommend the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse, Model 1023. </s>
<s> It is smaller than a standard mouse, but not so tiny as to make its use difficult -- a problem I have had with some notebook mice. </s>
<s> The USB receiver stores in the base of the mouse making a compact unit for storage, and it turns off the mouse so you won't deplete the battery. </s>
<s> Hope this helps Frank </s>
<s> Thanks a bunch! </s>
<s> Now to just add the MX1000 to my Christmas wishlist... </s>
<s> Ok, I'll check it out. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Check out the Logitech G7 Mouse. </s>
<s> The price is starting to come down (Amazon = $79.99). </s>
<s> I think its the best mouse you can buy. </s>
<s> It's a laser mouse, great features, and is wireless (and is as reponsive as a wired mouse). </s>
<s> Just check it out and read the reviews. </s>
<s> I'm giving them a Christmas presents... </s>
<s> hopefully i'll get it as a Christmas present too.. </s>
<s> Howdy, I've got the 1023 and when I engage it for service it won't power up. </s>
<s> I remove the battery and warm it in my palm . </s>

<s> sometimes this makes a difference. </s>
<s> Batteries are new from the store and am at my witts ends with yet another MS product that should still be maybe in beta!! </s>
<s> Many thanks </s>
