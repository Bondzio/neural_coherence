i used to safely remove hardware all the time then i was told if it is usb 2.0 don't bother.
so i stopped.
is it true?, not sure but i have never had a problem.
so try that first as you may be turning off your usb port each time also make sure that you are not having conflicting drives.
i had a mapped drive set to e and everytime i plugged in a memory stick i never knew if it was going to recognise it.
hope that helps
