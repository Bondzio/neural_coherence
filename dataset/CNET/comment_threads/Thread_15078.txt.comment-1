I am looking for a good TV/PC Monitor.
My current one does not have DVI or HDMI ports.
I currently have a Ceton Infini 4 Digital Tuner in my PC.
My PC connection to my monitor is RGB.
I've been told the picture from the tuners would be better quality with a monitor that has a DVI or HDMI port(s).
My video card has both.
Is this true?
If it is would someone suggest a good TV/PC Monitor.
I use the TV only at times.
