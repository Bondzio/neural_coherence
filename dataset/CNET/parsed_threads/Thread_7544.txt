<s> Hello, About 2 weeks ago my USB ports stopped functioning. </s>
<s> It says the drivers are not installed. </s>
<s> It won't roll them back either, it is if there never were any. </s>
<s> I replaced my motherboard due to another issue, the drivers still will not load. </s>
<s> I tried to load them from the motherboard CD, the windows CD and a download. </s>
<s> When I try to load it says &quot;access denied&quot;. </s>
<s> I need to have this fixed as I need to print some photos for my work ASAP. </s>
<s> If I can't get it going today I am going to wipe and reload my hard drive tonight. </s>
<s> Please help if any of you have advice. </s>

<s> Microsoft rarely gets drivers correct. </s>

<s> You neglected the Tip: that is just above the Message body and Subject that notes you should tell what OS and more: &quot;If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; 3. http://www.usbman.com notes many things about USB. </s>
<s> Including current BIOS, enabling USB in the BIOS, drivers for the motherboard, Administrator install of drivers in XP/NT/2000/2003 and more more more. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> If it's for work, then your IT staff should be called in. </s>
<s> Best of luck and if you reload the hard disk, then be sure to record all the steps for faster reinstall the next time. </s>

<s> Hey Thnaks. </s>
<s> I am using Windows XP home edition. </s>
<s> I looked at usbman but could not find anything relevant. </s>
<s> As far as the bios, I don't know how to get into it with the new board. </s>
<s> If you can't get into the BIOS and you don't know the make/model of your machine or board, USBMAN won't help much. </s>
<s> As to the BIOS, check the manual or tell the make/model of machine or board. </s>
<s> Generic boards use the Del key, and USBMAN notes that USB should be &quot;Enabled.&quot; The error messages in Windows are often mis-programmed and &quot;denied&quot; could be because your account is not capable of installing drivers (Administrator capable?) </s>
<s> or the USB ports are disabled. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I will ltry to get in the bios and check it when I go to lunch today. </s>
