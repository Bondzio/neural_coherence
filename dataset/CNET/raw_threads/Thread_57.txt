When I check other workstations control panel printer is &quot;IBM 1145 on MYSERVER01&quot; and I even have a printer name (&quot;LXK485DC8&quot;) and an IP address but nothing helps find it in the printer find window after selecting the server name to find. Other info states I need to specify (e.g. &quot;server.host1.printer/LXK485DC8&quot;) but that doesnt work either. I also try searching under the share name &quot;IBM1145&quot; and that doesnt work. Again, I have printed the printers network configuration info. and have access to printer setup GUI from the notebook but dont know how else to setup.

I realize this has to be the most hassel-filled way to do it but it worked fine. BTW, on printer, a DNS address was specified but enable DHCP was unchecked...may mean nothing. Thanks again
