it used to work on my hp laptop running vista home premium.
the mouse driver has different name than before now for some reason, it's now called &quot;hid-compliant mouse&quot;.
when i click on &quot;update driver&quot; it says i have the latest, but the driver is from 2006. i used to have a logitech control panel but now it's gone.
doesn't give me the option to rollback driver.
should i uninstall the driver, unplug mouse, and then plug it back in hoping i will get my old logitech driver back?
