<s> Is it necessary to &quot;safely remove&quot; and disconnect a USB 2 External Hard Disk from a Desktop PC before shutting down the PC ? </s>
<s> Can it be left connected to the PC ? </s>
<s> If not, is it better / safer to connect it to the Desk Top PC before pressing the Start-Up Button, or to plug it in after completion of Start-Up. </s>
<s> Would appreciate getting advice on this issue. </s>
<s> Thanks in anticipation. </s>
<s> But if it is connected before booting up computer then you CAN NOT be able to do &quot;hot swapping&quot; with the drive (safely remove will not be possible)...at least that has been my experience. </s>
<s> So don't disconnect while computer is still on. </s>
