I am probably like 85 % of the world and cant figure out the whole High-Def thing.
No doubt its better quality but understanding all of the specs etc...
Anyhow The other day I was at bb and noticed they have high-def monitors with the high-end cpus.
What I was wondering is ... isnt this just a gimick.
Aren't all lcd, + monitors by definition high-definition?
