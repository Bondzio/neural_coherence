Where or how would I check to see which security setting I have?
Should I leave my router hooked up even though I don't have a working notebook to take advantage of the signal or should I go ahead and disconnect it?
These terms, WEP, WPA, WPA2 only relate to wireless correct?
If you have DSL but no router you should have nothing to worry about?
Correct or not?
Thanks for the comments.
