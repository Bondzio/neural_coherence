<s> I'm planning to add a DVD-ROM to my new computer (it currently has a DVD/CD RW drive with Light Scribe). </s>
<s> I've found numerous models (much cheaper than I ever could have imagined $17 to $25) but have no idea what I'm looking for or what names mean quality. </s>
<s> Some of the brands I've found are: BenQ, Toshiba, Lite-On, LG, Samsung, Sony, Asus. </s>
<s> Can anyone recommend one of those brands over another? </s>
<s> Do the DVD-ROM Access Times, CD-ROM Access Times, and Cache Times mean a lot? </s>
<s> For DVD-ROM Access Times the one I like has 80-220ms but others have as low as a constant 90ms. </s>
<s> For CD-ROM Access Times the one I like as 165ms but others have as low as 95ms For Cache the one I like has 512K but other have as much as 2M. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> TBB </s>
<s> For $40 USD or less you can get a dual layer DVD+/-RW drive that will work with all major media types. </s>
<s> The more cache the better. </s>
<s> 2MB cache works great for me; I can't justify 2x-3x the $$ for 8MB. </s>
<s> As for brands, I have had good experiences with NEC and Sony. </s>

<s> I was looking at just a DVD-ROM drive because I already have a DVD +/-RW drive in my computer and was told that there may be some conflict within the computer when trying to burn items because of having two different burners. </s>
<s> Do you feel that 512K of Cache is too little? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> TBB </s>
<s> 512K is too little if you like speedy drives. </s>
<s> Get the 2MB cache drive. </s>
<s> I don't have a problem with multiple DVD+/-RW drives. </s>
<s> You just tell your burning software which drive to use when you go to burn discs--very easy. </s>
<s> I think it is wise to purchase a second DVD burner instead of a Read-Only drive since your old drive will fail at some point (as all drives do), and the dual layer DVD burners are so inexpensive these days. </s>
<s> Nevertheless, the bottom line is always your budget. </s>
