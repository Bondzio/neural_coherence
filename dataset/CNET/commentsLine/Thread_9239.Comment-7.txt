hi, did you ever figure out how to fix the proble you were having with your disk drive?
i am having the same problem.
my dvd rom can read dvd movies but it cannot read any software disks.
i wanted to reformat/restore my laptop but unfortunately i can't because the dvd wont read the restore disks.
you can contact me at elizabether@hotmail.com.
thank you in advance for any help given.
