<s> Hi, I am looking to replace my old Netgear rangemax wireless router WPN 824v2 with one that meets the following criteria: 1. </s>
<s> Good range, my router will be in the basement and my gaming computer is 2 floors up from here. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Much better speed, 300+ would be good. </s>
<s> I have been looking at the Netgear wndr3700 is there a better one out there? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Since all the advice is to not put WIFI routers in the basement you decided to do that in spite of all advice. </s>
<s> I don't think any router will deliver in this scenario. </s>

<s> Was received. </s>
<s> You ask NEW QUESTIONS so let's tackle those head on. </s>
<s> &quot; What do people do who work in large office buildings or apartment buildings regarding wireless routers. </s>
<s> Most likely they cannort have a router on each floor. </s>
<s> If I cannot relocate from the basement where it is now what would you recommend? </s>
<s> Maybe a bridge using 2 routers or what? </s>
<s> &quot; A bridge might have wifi on the other end. </s>
<s> I've noted AC POWERLINE BRIDGES that have wifi at one end which is a really nice and easy to setup solution. </s>
<s> And you could use 2 routers with some bridge but some folk are challenged by the configuration (which is noted in this forum's sticky post about post 18 or 19.) </s>
<s> The wndr3700 is a great choice but when we don't follow the maker's recommendations we often are disappointed. </s>
<s> Example at http://forum1.netgear.com/showthread.php?p=235362 Post 3 notes more. </s>
<s> You can try just one wndr3700 in the basement and have a backup plan if you are disappointed. </s>
