To make sure your PC can communicate with the Brother printer, you'll need to know the printers IP address.
This can be done by printing out a configuration page from the printer console.
Once you get the address, can you ping it from the PC?
As far as port #'s, I wouldn't be concerned with this unluss your trying to reach the printer over the Internet via a router.
