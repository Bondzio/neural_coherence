What I want to do: Have my HP PC desktop hardwired to the internet and my MacBook wirelessly to the net via my Airport. I have a DSL modem and a 3 year old Airport extream. I would also like to be able to share a HP printer between the two but that is not critical. The MacBook/Airport has been functional for a couple of years; am adding the PC desktop into the mix. How do I do this?

Set the Airpot to NOT be a DHCP server using Apple Airport software. Connect the router to the modem Surf on P

Current set up is just Modem--Airport--Macbook (wirelessly) New configuration is adding a hardwired HP desktop. Do I still need the router between the Airport and modem? I can't hardwire the HP to the Airport?
