1.1.1	I think I asked this question before and got something of a vague response .	St
1.1.2	I have a Dell computer from 2006 ( An XPS 410 ) and my video card is an nVidia GEForce 9500 GT .	St
1.1.3	Now I 've heard that with some resolutions it 's not possible to see the computer on the TV screen , but 640x480 works best and full-screen games are just fine .	St
1.1.4	My monitor is capable of going to 640x480 .	St
1.1.5	Now my other question is that I 'm planning on getting a new computer soon ( also a Dell , not sure which one yet ) .	St
1.1.6	It 's going to be widescreen , whereas the one I have now is a standard definition resolution monitor .	St
1.1.7	Will that impact what cable I need or will it work for both an older and a newer computer ?	Ques
1.1.8	I 'm quite confused by this so any help is much appreciated !	St
1.1.9	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	No mention of the make , model of the TV as well as what connections are on the PC .	St
1.2.2	I fear the answers must remain vague without details .	St
1.2.3	For example you connect same to same video inputs and outputs .	St
1.2.4	It 's that simple .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well my TV now has the standard S-Video ports ( red , white , yellow ) although I suppose in the future I could get an HDTV .	St
1.3.2	The make of the TV is Sansui , I 'm not even familiar with the company .	St
1.3.3	Not sure what the model is , but does it matter ?	Ques
1.3.4	I thought all that mattered were the connections .	St
1.3.5	I have no fancy connections on the computer , just the outlets and the monitor .	St
1.4.1	Your standard red , yellow white AV connections while not S-Video ( see http : //www.google.com/images ? hl=en & q=svideo ) are rarely found on a PC .	St
1.4.2	BE very clear that composite and svideo is going to be unacceptable to most ( so far nearly 100 % ! )	St
1.4.3	so I strongly suggest you do n't spend a dime on this .	Sug
1.4.4	Unless your PC has composite out why not try this another way ?	Ques
1.4.5	Many want to watch content from the PC on the TV but given we are going to get 1/3 to 1/4 the pixels as the VGA display again you find that folk after expending money and effort are often upset with the results .	St
1.4.6	This changes if you have a HDTV .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	Does this TV have a monitor , or HDMI connector on it ?	Ques
1.5.2	if so , you 'll dig it ... otherwise it 's a fuzzy waste .	St
1.5.3	Also , is your 9500GT built in the motherboard , or did you add it later ?	Ques
1.5.4	Look on the back of it ... it probably has an s-video plug .	St
1.5.5	( hey guys , they have HDMI outputs on video cards yet ? ) .	St
1.5.6	Analog will drive you insane , and S-video will make ya beat your dog .	St
1.5.7	( Maybe your 9500 has HDMI output , it resembles a USB slot ) The fuzzy picture you get on your TV will dissapoint unless you run a LCD , plasma , or theater projector.They look as good as any PC monitor .	St
1.5.8	The number of pins in the connector used dictates how good the TV picture will look : 1 ) MONITOR:12 pins ( lose job & girlfriend ) 2 ) HDMI vs 12 pin ?	Ques
1.5.9	( Similar to 12 pin ) 2 ) COMPSITE:6 pins ( never seen these ) 3 ) S-VIDEO : 4 pins ( Begin to hate PCs ) 4 ) ANALOG : 2 pins ( housecleaning is more fun ) Second : Your video card can throw super hi-def in widescreen ( 16:9 ) , OR standard ( 4:3 ) ... it 's in the cards settings , and has nothing to do with whatever screen used .	St
1.5.10	NOTE : monitors support limited resolutions , but far more than 640x480 ... .unless your TV/monitor is ancient .	St
1.6.1	So if I DO get an HDTV and obtain a newer model ( 2010 , 2011 ) computer , my best option is to go with composite connections ?	Ques
1.6.2	Could you explain a bit further on composite and what I 'd need to go ahead and do that ?	Ques
1.7.1	Maybe my best bet would 've been to wait until I get a new computer and an HDTV before I ask again .	St
1.7.2	My computer/TV are fairly old .	St
1.7.3	The computer is a 2006 model and the TV I 'm not even sure of .	St
1.7.4	I basically bought it used at a yard sale .	St
1.7.5	It might be a 2004/2005 model but I 'm not sure .	St
1.8.1	But I explained this and I fear one more time will not improve it .	St
1.8.2	Try this .	St
1.8.3	Head to a store and have them explain the options again .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
