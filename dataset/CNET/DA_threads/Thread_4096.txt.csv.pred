1.1.1	I build and repair computers and have for years ... I was even a Moderator here at CNET for years , so I 'm not completely dumb as a rock when it comes to hardware especially , but this has me scratching my head .	St
1.1.2	ASRock mobo that takes either DDRII or DDR RAM in dual channel configuration .	St
1.1.3	( you ca n't mix both at the same time obviously ) .	St
1.1.4	I have two sticks of DDRII in the appropriate two slots ( 1GB each ) , and this is what happens .	St
1.1.5	I put in one stick in slot 1 , and it boots up fine ... take that stick out and put it into slot 3 , and it boots up fine .	St
1.1.6	I take the other stick and do the same to it after removing the first stick , and it boots up fine both times .	St
1.1.7	If I put BOTH sticks in at the same time , it refuses to boot up and acts stupid as all get out .	St
1.1.8	I 've looked all over the place in the mobo manual and there is nothing to indicate this should n't work , since I 've tested two sticks of DDR RAM at the same time and had no problems with that ... only the DDRII .	St
1.1.9	The sticks are identical , both in size and vendor , and since they both work fine as a single mode no matter where I put them , I 'm stumped .	St
1.1.10	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.11	This is for a computer that I am selling and have to box up by Wednesday to ship it out and I would like to get this resolved as quickly as possible .	St
1.1.12	The sticks are about a year old , if that , and had been kept in their silver envelopes the entire time until I was ready to build this system .	St
1.1.13	They 've never been installed in anything else because this mobo is the only one I have that takes DDRII RAM .	St
1.1.14	Thanks for any help or suggestions ... ... TONI H	Ques
1.2.1	I might have the same/similar MB .	St
1.2.2	.	St
1.2.3	.	St
1.2.4	ASRock Dual VSTA .	St
1.2.5	I 've only tried the DDR ... I use it mostly as a bench board but never tried any DDR2 in it .	St
1.2.6	Tried bumping the RAM voltage ?	Ques
1.2.7	BIOS up to date ?	Ques
1.2.8	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	I think it was Kingston RAM ... it 's not marked with anything except the size of 1GB ( each stick ) Wondering ... .the BIOS ( which probably needs to be updated but I have n't done that and is version 2.058 ) sees one stick as 1024MB .	St
1.3.2	According to the manual , the limit for this board is 2GB .	St
1.3.3	Is it possible that because it 's over that limit totally with two sticks that that could be what is stopping it ?	Ques
1.3.4	I 'd have to check the BIOS to see what the voltage is already at .	St
1.3.5	It 's been a while since I began putting this together and I was using DDR RAM as well with no problems .	St
1.3.6	TONI H	St
1.4.1	the latest BIOS .	St
1.4.2	The manual clearly states 2GB of either DDR400 or DDR2 ... . mine boots and runs with either Crucial DDR400 or Crucial DDR2-800 ( defaults to DDR2-533 ) .	St
1.4.3	Let us know what you find .	St
1.4.4	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	states 2GB which was why I was wondering if the total being 2048MB according to the BIOS for one stick at 1024MB was making it go over the limit and refusing to see the second stick .	St
1.5.2	Rather than fight this , I think my best bet is to just go out and buy one stick of 2GB from my local computer shop today ... I can sell the 1GB sticks on Ebay one at a time and recoup my money .	St
1.5.3	LOL Thanks ... ... ... .	St
1.6.1	Do n't get hung-up on the 1000 vs 1024 memory status .	St
1.6.2	In the computer world 1024=1meg ( mb ) , thus 2meg=2048 what your system supports .	St
1.6.3	Two things come to mind on your problem .	St
1.6.4	Though you have alike ram modules they have a timing issue , its that close .	St
1.6.5	Next , you a slightly off ram module or starting to fail and its a weak link .	St
1.6.6	Last , because this is a AsRock mtrbd. , I consider their products bottom-end offering .	St
1.6.7	That means , they could have less than perfect or borderline quality , in other words , cheap .	St
1.6.8	If a bios update is lacking , then do it or at least see what the bios update does , it may correct the problem .	St
1.6.9	I would think if you have access to yet another & quot ; matched pair & quot ; of ram modules you could test the install and clear alot of questions .	St
1.6.10	Under the ram voltage setting , see if a slight tweek helps .	St
1.6.11	Check the ram setup and see how its addressed .	St
1.6.12	Maybe be more conversation or up it , play with it instead of & quot ; auto & quot ; setting .	St
1.6.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	To check the ram signature or its chip ID , you this pgm .	Sug
1.7.2	PC Wizard 2009 .	St
1.7.3	It has proved a great help at times .	St
1.7.4	Install and run it will report the ram status .	St
1.7.5	If the info for the ram does n't match , they are NOT a matched pair , though they look like it or have failed in some regard have become an unmatched pair if originally .	St
1.7.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.8.1	that program might provide an answer but after checking the site I discovered that although it will run from a flash drive or dvd/cd , you have to have an operating system ( Windows ) installed already and I 'm not including that with this system , so it 's got an empty harddrive .	St
1.8.2	Darn The only voltage setting I have available in the bios P1.150 version is Auto/High/Medium/Low ... .no 'number ' setting where I could bump it gently .	St
1.8.3	According to ASRock 's tech support site , the voltage for DDR2 is 1.8 and I ca n't tell from my options which that would be .	St
1.8.4	The manual does n't give much details for BIOS changes like other mobo manuals normally do .	St
1.8.5	Since RAM is cheap now , I 'll just get one stick of 2GB and try that instead .	St
1.8.6	I have no other systems that take DDR2 RAM , so have no other pairs to try .	St
1.8.7	Thanks for the suggestions .	St
1.8.8	TONI H	St
1.9.1	I re-read your 1st post .	St
1.9.2	You say , slot 1 and 3 are used .	St
1.9.3	That means you really have 4 slots ? ? ?	Ques
1.9.4	or 2 slots in total .	St
1.9.5	Quite frankly , how can you boot-up with one ram stick installed , it has to be failing if no OS present or stops upon finding none .	St
1.9.6	I think something is amiss here , IMHO .	St
1.9.7	Otherwise , I would think you had windoze installed and thus use pc wiz 2009 to check things .	St
1.9.8	If you have 4 slots , my thinking is your system supports a total of 2gb , then that means 512mb per slot .	St
1.9.9	While it can handle 1gb installed ( 1 ram stick ) , it may not cover the difference when 2gb ram sticks are used ( a bios update may cover this ) .	St
1.9.10	If in fact you have only 2 ram slots period then disregard this info .	St
1.9.11	The mere fact , that Asrock offers only slow/med/fast adjustment to ram gives you an idea what I mean by cheap .	St
1.9.12	Better mtrbds .	St
1.9.13	offer manual values directly to include actual voltages .	St
1.9.14	Not to belittle you , but I think you see my bewilderment here .	St
1.9.15	Anyways , good luck .	Polite
1.9.16	-- -- -Willy	St
1.10.1	There are two yellow slots for DDR2 and two blue slots for DDR Ram .	St
1.10.2	You can put one stick in either of the two yellow slots ( slot1 and 3 ) as single mode and have the computer boot up .	St
1.10.3	You can put two sticks in those slots and have dual channel mode .	St
1.10.4	This works for the blue slots as well .	St
1.10.5	If I put DDR ram into the two blue slots , it boots up fine ... it 's only the DDR2 ( yellow slots ) that gets whacked for some reason .	St
1.10.6	Hope this explains it better .	St
1.10.7	This is the last computer I will be building for sale so I know not to go with the ASRock mobo anymore .	St
1.10.8	Give me a reliable Abit or Gigabyte any day of the week .	St
1.10.9	LOL TONI H	St
