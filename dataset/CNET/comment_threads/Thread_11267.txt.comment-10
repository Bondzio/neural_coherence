I've got a 750W Corsair PSU in the case at the mo, which I'm sure will handle everything fine with the one 295 I have atm.
I'm thinking I may hold off on the SLI until the 300 cards are out and I can rock something special with two of those.
I've just found that my current mobo and chip are holding me back and I can't be bothered to OC them when I'm going to be buying new parts soon anyway.
Thanks for the motherboard tips.
I'll def get back when I decide what to go for.
I've heard good things about the Gigabyte choices.
Much research to be done
