Ok, so I have a Dell Latitude D505 laptop that I received for free.
I came with a Fujitsu 60G ATA-100 hard drive which I quickly filled up to capacity.
I purchased a new Western Digital 160G drive from newegg which is ATA-6.
I used a hard drive clone device to copy my smaller drive and then pulled out the old caddy and replaced the drive.
Upon start-up, I received an error message that the new drive was no bootable.
Is this due to the difference between ATA-6 and ATA-100?
Thats the only discernable difference.
The new drive has ~40 pins and the old drive has like a bar type connection.
If that is the case, is there anything I can do to use the ATA-6 drive or am I screwed?
