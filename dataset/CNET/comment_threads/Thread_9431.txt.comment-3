Did not change anything.
I do use MSI Afterburner and my temps never get higher than 70 running any game.
So temperature is not an issue.
Plus this happens the moment I get into the game, so there is a very small window for my GPU to reach overheated temps, which I don't think is happening.
I really can't find anyone else who has had this exact problem in my video before.
Highly frustrating!
