The other downside is the cost.
Being a niche product you pay a premium.
If you just want a second display, a common monitor is the cheap fix.
Almost all laptops will do a dual display.
The wallet is usually the decider here.
For me, I'd give USB 3.0 displays a wide berth since drivers are still iffy.
You don't want to know the stories.
