To say a rechargeable battery lifetime consists of a finite number of charge cycles is correct but misleading.
The lifetime is determined by how it is charged and discharged, and it is finite.
For NiCd, discharge it fully (but not excessively) occasionally, not every time.
For Li ion, keep it charged.
In all cases, use an intelligent charger that won't overcharge.
And use the battery, don't just leave it on the shelf for months.
