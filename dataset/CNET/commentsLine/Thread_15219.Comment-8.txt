you have a very outdated driver.
12/12/2006 predates vista's release.
i see we've found the most likely cause.
in closing, uac can block drivers.
i know to shut that down during driver installs.
also i didn't see vista mentioned till this last post.
since you are making incomplete posts, it's unlikely that anyone can guess what the issue is but given that date i'd say you found it.
