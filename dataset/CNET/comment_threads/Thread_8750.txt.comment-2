PB about upgrade CPUs ??
Even though GigaByte made the MB in your system ...they made it for PB who is responsible for supporting it.
I was not able to find any reference to that MB on the Gigabyte website.
Until you find out the upper limit of your CPU upgrade choices, the prices and describe the intended use, it's kind of difficult to comment on ...'Is it worth it?'
