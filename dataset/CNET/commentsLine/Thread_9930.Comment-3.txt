as another poster offered you can use some type of filter arrangement.
just beware that you *have* to maintain those filters and clean them, because if those get clogged up they will be worse than just a dusted fan or so, you cut-off the airflow supply.
if your system is on the floor or close to it, elevate it at least 6in.
or place on stand/small table, etc.
to reduce dust pick-up.
if you have pets, try to reduce thier dander or understand that can attribute to the dust problem.
you wil always have some dust and thus be prepared to maintain at &quot;your cleaning periods&quot; what's best for you.
