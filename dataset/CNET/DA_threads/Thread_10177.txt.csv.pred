1.1.1	What a pain .	St
1.1.2	I have a Seagate and Maxtor-drive system with an 80-pin cable installed .	St
1.1.3	I 've tried two drives and yet I get a & quot ; no 80 conductor cable installed & quot ; error message .	St
1.1.4	Is this a mainboard issue ?	Ques
1.1.5	It just happened one day when I turned on the computer , though I 've had compatability problems since I got the Seagate .	St
1.1.6	Do n't know if it 's coincidence or not .	St
1.1.7	I 've installed millions of hard disks and have never had this happen .	St
1.1.8	Any help would be greatly appreciated !	Polite
1.1.9	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Thanks , but no , the cable is in -- blue section plugged into MB .	St
1.3.2	Both drives are set to Cable Select .	St
1.3.3	Perhaps I should set the second one as Slave .	St
1.3.4	Hmmm .	St
1.4.1	Nothing I do will keep this error message from appearing .	St
1.4.2	The cable 's plugged in correctly ( blue plug into the MB ) .	St
1.4.3	Both drives were set to cable select .	St
1.4.4	I even changed the last one to SLAVE and it made no difference .	St
1.4.5	Also ca n't find much on the Internet to address this except that many people seem to be experiencing this .	St
1.4.6	Any other ideas ?	Ques
1.5.1	http : //www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCable80-c.html I 'd see if the BIOS is up to date or maybe these are very old drives ?	Ques
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	Nope , both Maxtor drives are identical and one was working beautifully as my permanent second drive .	St
1.6.2	Then one day came the dreaded knocking sound .	St
1.6.3	I noticed I was getting the error message on bootup and swapped the drive for the second one .	St
1.6.4	No knocking sound , but though the disk IS recognized in the bios , I still get the same error message .	St
1.6.5	I 'm beginning to believe it may be a MB problem .	St
1.6.6	I may just have to get a massive single drive or swap to the more modern SATA drives .	St
1.6.7	But if it 's a MB problem , I may be playing with fire .	St
1.6.8	Any other recommendations ?	Ques
1.6.9	Thanks !	St
