thanks for the info and here are the specs on the computer.
i'm running xp home installed with a clean install using an upgrade from 98se.
it is up to date with sp2 and all of the latest udated from microsoft.
it is a micron millenia (best buy) p# 733 with 2 hard drives.
i'm running awil's avast anti-virus and microsofts anti-spyware.
i just did a chkdsk on the secondary drive and it read unrecoverable.
i unhooked it and the pc started.
guess i'm back in business.
thanks again
