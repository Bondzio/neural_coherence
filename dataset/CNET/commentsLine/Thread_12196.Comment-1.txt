i am planning on installing some sort of network in my house/home office and the most important thing to me is being able to transfer files between computers quickly and storage.
like 5tb of storage... ok 5tb might be more than i need but i want alot of space for home movies, pictures, music, and work related files.
i was going to wire the house with cat6 as well as have wireless in some areas.
but really i don't know what i should do about the storage?
do i need a server?
i know there will probably be no more than 6 computers running most of the time but there can be times when that will jump to maybe 10 computers... i'm not really sure how a server works but, every computer on the network will have it's own software... the only thing i want to store centrally is files to share, and i am looking for something with a very fast data transfer speed so more than one video can be streamed through the network quickly and with no delay... i also am looking for full redundancy so if anything dies i have a backup available right away, i believe that's called raid right?
i have both macs and pc's to put on the network.
can anyone help me with ideas or what i really need to get?
thanks
