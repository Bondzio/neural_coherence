I must admit I didn't think there was that much on it!
Mostly it's simply the virus/firewall stuff plus Photoshop and Office programs and a few small utilities.
I have not turned off disc indexing - did wonder about that but did not know if there were significant disadvantages.
Not sure what you mean about the server and the rest of the stuff was way over my head too!
Appreciate you trying to help though
