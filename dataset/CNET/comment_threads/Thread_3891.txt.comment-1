I have a Netgear WNR834 RangeMax NEXT Wireless-N Broadband Router.
I ran the installation disk as stated.
I have Cox high speed internet with cable modem.
My phone is attached to the modem.
(bundle package) phone/internet/cable tv.
After setting up router I get no internet access/internet not detected.
My PS3 reads the netgear is there but at 55% signal strength.
What next?
