1.1.1	hey everyone , I 've had my core 2 duo 6300 for a few months now and i 've been messing around with overclocking it because i want to get as much out of it as i can .	St
1.1.2	i heard online that one guy got his 6600 core 2 from 2.4 GHz to over 3.0 GHz , and it was outperforming a core extreme .	St
1.1.3	i have the ability to overclock in the BIOS , but im kind of nervous about it .	St
1.1.4	without overclocking , my CPU runs at about 96 degrees f. when i overclocked it to 2.14 Ghz ( from 1.86 ) , the temp .	St
1.1.5	rose to about 103. i dont know how far i should go right now because i still have the stock fan ( i dont think it was running at MAX , but still ) .	St
1.1.6	i plan on getting a new fan pretty soon , but until then , what temperature should i stop at ?	Ques
1.1.7	i was guessing around 115 , but that may be way too hot .	St
1.1.8	any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.9	Also , the BIOS has the option to change the voltage .	St
1.1.10	Right now it is on AUTO , but i have heard that you also need to up the voltage if you overclock ... will AUTO take care of that or not ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks in advance .	St

1.2.1	115f should not be a problem with that CPU .	St
1.2.2	You can easily overclock this processor merely by raising the FSB and adding a tenth of a volt to the core to aid stability ( you 'll need to switch out of AUTO ) .	St
1.2.3	Make sure the RAM and FSB are unlinked so you do n't overclock the RAM when upping the FSB .	St
1.2.4	Best to overclock in small increments , run something like Prime95 to check for stability , and keep an eye on the temps .	St
1.3.1	i will try that .	Sug
1.3.2	is there a good free program i can use to monitor the temp while windows is running because right now i have to monitor it in the BIOS hardware monitor .	St
1.3.3	thanks -zak-	Polite

1.6.1	You should have PC Probe on your motherboard CD , or you can download it here : http : //www.techspot.com/downloads/265-asus-pc-probe.html	St

1.8.1	The software that you have to check the temp is it taking the reading from Bios .	St
1.8.2	One thing they say about Bios , it does not lie .	St
1.8.3	I reboot and go to Bios to check my temp .	St
1.8.4	Motherboard Monitor is a good software to check your system .	St
1.8.5	http : //www.download.com/Motherboard-Monitor/3000-2086_4-10518385.html ? tag=lst-0-1 Make upgrade your cooling system , That is why I never overclocked I like to stay on the safe side .	Ques
1.8.6	If you fry your CPU Intel may not cover it under the Warranty .	St
1.8.7	Good Luck : Wendell H	St
