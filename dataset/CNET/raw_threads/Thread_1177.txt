I have a desktop PC also, but plan on connecting this directly to the router and so it is just the laptop that will be wireless at the moment. House is single storey (2000 square feet), but construction is concrete walls. What router would you recommend and why? Thanks

You'll have to design a solution with some central router and wire WAPs back to it to create your wifi &quot;zones.&quot; I decline to provide a free course in network design but it's a well known problem with a simple solution.

No maker will give you assurance it will work through concrete walls. Just call them. I can tell you how I solved it but you want a solid solution and not something iffy. Bob

Connect the router to the cable modem Connect PC to router then for the rooms where I would like Wifi - run wired waps back to the router How expensive are wap's If I go this route then should I get a 802.11n router or 802.11g? Thanks as always

As to WAPs, I don't use a WAP anymore since most wifi routers can be configured as a WAP. And any router that can be programmed with OpenWRT (they have a list of them) can be turned into a WAP. So the cost is the same as a router. Bob PS. Why not duplicate what you know works?

I suppose I could get a router and give it ago. Then if it's a bust, then look into adding wired wap. Excuse the basic ?'s If I have very good cordless phone reception from reciever base to other rooms (where I would need wifi access) - would this not suggest that the wifi router might work? If I had to go wired. I would need to buy a couple of extra routers + cable and then configure these as access points - is this simple to do? cheers

Those cordless phones are not the same thing with differences I decline to list since I would have to write quite a few paragraphs. I'm an electronics designer with designs in two way paging systems so to express why would result in many paragraphs. The try it and find out is the usual route. Simple? For me yes. For others? Maybe. If you used routers that could be configured as a WAP or WAPs or that you could install OpenWRT that supports turning such into a WAP but then I would be repeating what I wrote above... Bob
