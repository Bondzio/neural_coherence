1.1.2	Power supply faulty ?	Ques

1.1.4	Mobo failing ?	Ques
1.1.5	My girlfriends computer killed a 40gb maxtor .	St
1.1.6	So I replaced it with a 40gb western digital , not trusting those silly maxtors .	St
1.1.7	That got a crapload of errors after about 3 weeks and then it croaked too .	St
1.1.8	So I took out one of my several hard drives from my computer and donated an 80gb hard drive that I have had for 2 years with no problems at all ever .	St
1.1.9	Ran disk check ( after I filled it with music ) and nothing came up .	St
1.1.10	So I formatted and put in her machine .	St
1.1.11	2 weeks later I get error checking on boot up .	St
1.1.12	Now I am convinced that 3 hard drives in 2 months is a little freakin ridiculous .	St
1.1.13	One of the hard drives will not even be recognized by bios in three different machines and the other one it just permanently errored .	St
1.1.14	I was hoping not to loose my 80gb because I kind of like it .	St
1.1.15	It is being used right now by the infernal machine .	St
1.1.16	Not sure if this matters but two of the four integrated USB ports on the motherboard are dead .	St
1.1.17	Is this a sign of motherboard crapping out on me ?	Ques
1.2.1	Is the system on a UPS ? ?	Ques
1.2.2	How old is the PC ? ?	Ques
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	When you have persistant problem ( s ) on a system you have to step back .	St
1.3.2	All too often a common link maybe the PSU and/or anything else .	St
1.3.3	I usually like to replace the PSU as a matter of course .	St
1.3.4	While this sometimes corrects the problem it *may* return as it seems yours has and then I see the other half or 2ndary problem , usually the mtrbd .	St
1.3.5	or a compotent/device that was stressed during a bad PSU or whatever caused the problems .	St
1.3.6	Another common link is a high level of & quot ; heat stress & quot ; and that effects everything as well once you have a stuffed system or non-cleaned dust bunnies in there .	St
1.3.7	Since , you have bad USB ports it could be drivers or mtrbd .	St
1.3.8	h/w fault but since you have multiple probelms it really gets hard to t/s w/o some massive swap .	St
1.3.9	Unstable AC power can also cause weird or unrelated problems in the long run , other than being in the same system .	St
1.3.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	This problem can not be because of bad ac power , since it has been in the same room as my computer without any problems and it has done this in both my house and our apt .	St
1.4.2	I doubt it is heat stress since it is so bare .	St
1.4.3	AMD 3200 with one CD rom , 2 sticks of ram , one hard drive and one pci card .	St
1.4.4	It is a roomy aluminium Mid ATX case and 3 fans ( One intake , bottom front , one exhaust in the back and one side out . )	St
1.4.5	The PSU is an interesting idea .	Polite
1.4.6	This thing uses so little power though ... it does n't even have a floppy drive .	St
1.4.7	I guess I 'll just get a new mobo ...	St
1.5.1	I had a motherboard that did the same thing only to memory chips .	St
1.5.2	I replaced the PSU and things were fine for a while and then I started getting hard drive errors .	St
1.5.3	After checking the motherboard I found several capacitors with bulging tops which meant they were bad .	St
1.5.4	Do n't know if there was a connection between the bad PSU and the capacitors .	St
