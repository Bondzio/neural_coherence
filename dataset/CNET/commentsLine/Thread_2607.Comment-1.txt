i just moved to a new apartment with two cable internet wall jacks.
the one in my room didn't seem to be working, so i ran a cable to the other jack (my roommate's) and i can access the net fine with that one.
i called the apartment complex's tech people and they sent a guy with his laptop.
he proceded to connect his laptop to the jack in my room and it worked for him.
he then told me i probably had a faulty network card and should buy a new one.
but every store i've been to said it's probably a settings-related problem.
thoughts?
i'm running winxp and have had my network card for about 3 years.
it's a netgear fa311 fast ethernet adapter.
on the box it says it is compatible with xp, but the documentation inside makes no mention of xp-compatibility.
any help is appreciated.
thanks.
