1.1.1	I have an HP desk top with a 80GB hard drive , I want to upgrade to a larger hard drive and also wanted to be able to use the system disks I created when I bought the computer so that the programs that were installed on the computer would still be there .	St
1.1.2	I have never done this before so I thought I might contact HP and ask if it was possible to do this .	St
1.1.3	They asured me that it was possible as long as the new hard drive ran the same rmps as the old one .	St
1.1.4	They told me if the rpms were not the same I would not be able to use my system recovery disks that I created from the computer .	St
1.1.5	They then tried to sell me a external hard drive which I was really not interested in .	St
1.1.6	I want to upgrade to a larger hard drive but I want an internal one .	St
1.1.7	I just wanted to ask if any one knows that this might be true and what has the rpms got to do with my system disks .	St
1.1.8	The hard drive I now have is an 5400 rpm and I did look at the new one I wanted to buy and it said it was 7200 rpm..Would it be better for me to buy an external hard drive .	St
1.1.9	I do n't want to go into the expense of a new hard drive and then not be able to use my system disks..Thank you , Wright5972	St
1.2.1	I have built and upgaded many of systems and never heard that upgrading your hard drive to higher RPMs would cause a problem .	St
1.2.2	The easiest thing to do would be to clone the drive you have now and copy that image to the new drive .	St
1.3.1	OK , how do I clone a hard drive ?	Ques
1.4.1	Given the limitation stated by HP ... why not just add a decent size 7,200 RPM as a second internal hard drive ?	Ques
1.5.1	Get at 7200 rpm drive with at least 8MB cache .	St
1.5.2	You can download the free HD cloning utility from the HD maker if the utility is n't included with the new dreve .	St
1.5.3	The cloning utility copies the image of the old HD to the new HD .	St
1.6.1	clone or what ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.6.2	I downloaded hdclone and it has partitioning capablitlies I just do n't know which to do first .	St
1.7.1	Just a word of caution .	St
1.7.2	Not sure what OS you are running .	Res
1.7.3	If you are using any of the OS that needs Microsoft activation , moving the OS to a new hard drive may cause the OS not to work ( MS think that you are installing the OS to another PC ) .	St
1.7.4	This may be the reason why HP is giving you the warning of RPM different .	St
1.7.5	You need to call MS to reactivate the system for you .	St
1.7.6	For simpilcity , I 'll just add a new internal or external ( USB ) HD .	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	1 ) You want to scrap the 80gb hard ?	Ques
1.9.2	Otherwise , why not keep the OS and 80g HD ?	Ques
1.9.3	You can do both you know .	St
1.9.4	The 80gb would be your c : and the additional Drive would be a storage D : Installation is easy and you can even format the new drive using your existing C : windows drive .	St
1.9.5	Also , you should note on your HP , there is a sticker with the license number .	St
1.9.6	If you had to install your OS again .	St
1.9.7	This number would be what you use .	St
1.9.8	In the rare case Microsoft gives you a hard time .	St
1.9.9	A phone call to their customer support will take care of it .	St
1.9.10	Not sure if you wanted to replace the drive .	Res
1.9.11	In that case you will want to back up the information you want .	St
1.9.12	Obtain an OS disk ( that matches your current version ) and do a fresh install .	St
1.9.13	That is the easiest sure fire method .	St
1.9.14	Cloning a drive as stated earlier , can cause license issues .	St
1.9.15	Hope this helps .	St
