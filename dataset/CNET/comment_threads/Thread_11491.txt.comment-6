I have decided to go without the gpu and see how things work.
Actually, I won't be doing much if any video editing until sometime next year.
In your previous post you mentioned the Haswell and I have been giving that very serious thought along with an Asus mobo (because it supports dual monitors) and now I am investigating a psu that will be compatible with the Haswell which as I understand it needs a psu that can work with a very low voltage when the cpu is in &quot;sleep mode&quot;.
