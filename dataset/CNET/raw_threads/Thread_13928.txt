If anybody out there has a suggestion what to do , that scanners, printers etc. can also be modified to run with 220 - 240 V please let me know.What do I do about the charger for my notebook ? I understand that converters are out there. Would that be the only option ? Thanks, Gryta

ANYTHING between 95 and 130 VAC (Volts Alternating Current) is considered standard wall socket and lighting voltage nearly world wide. Likewise 190 to 250 VAC is standard large appliance voltage with two phase motors or heating elements to power. I'd hate to think what would happen if you actually pluged your charger into a 220V outlet intended for heaters and dryers and such!!! It's the ALTERNATING FREQUENCY that can mess up some small appliances and electronic devices. The US and Canada supply house voltages at 60 Hertz, where European electricity measures 50 Hertz. For most wall adapters (unless engineered to compensate for lower frequencies) deliver a reduced charging voltage as a result of the different rate. On the other hand, European chargers, designed for 50 hertz, plugged into American electricity will produce HIGHER voltages. In some cases, a low operating voltage in some electronics can be just as damaging as too high a voltage. MOST electronic devices have a tag or label around the power cord that will state the input range, i.e., 100 ~ 125 VAC / 50 - 60 Hz. A tag like (that includes both 50 and 60 hertz rates) means it's safe to plug in just about anywhere in the world.

I'm trying to buy an American iron (Austrian ones leave much to be desired), but all that I look at say only 120V, so I haven't purchased one. However, am I looking at the wrong part of the tag? I only want to use an adaptor, not converter, should I be checking for 60 HZ instead? Thank you.

Simply do a google search for &quot;country voltages&quot; and you may find that your info is incorrect. Also regarding the difference between 50 HZ and 60 HZ, while for devices with iron/ferrite cores the transformer losses vary somewhat, there are very few things for which it makes a failure condition. Yes I know that many years ago when California went from 50 HZ to 60 HZ, they saved enough in power meter losses to pay for the conversion.
