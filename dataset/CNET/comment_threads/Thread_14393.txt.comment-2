Try the generic reset (power off, remove battery, ac, press+hold power button for 60 seconds, release and test.)
Yes I read you tried it but you didn't tell if the AC was removed.
And it's not a &quot;bleed off.&quot; I can only guess some web site wrote that and we now get folk saying this.
But I read you think there is a video card.
Very few laptops have such.
Less than a percent point (much lower!)
