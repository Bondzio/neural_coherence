i have a new desktop running vista home premium edition.
i have a printer hooked up to it.
i have a laptop running xp media center and is networked to the desktop via a wireless router.
when i try to print from my laptop it does not recognize the printer.
i think i have the desktop set to share the printer.
fbref.
