<s> My boss has a Dell Inspiron Notebook, less than a year old, OS Windows XP. </s>
<s> It was purchased with two other notebooks of the same. </s>
<s> His is the only one where the fan will almost continually run, and when it does the computer slows down to a crawl. </s>
<s> We had a tech in a few days ago for something else and she agreed to look at this computer, but only had a few moments. </s>
<s> She said there is interference from a wireless network somewhere else in the office park we are in. </s>
<s> We are not set up for wireless - our internet access is through a dialup LAN, which 4 of us share. </s>
<s> None of us are familiar with wireless at all. </s>
<s> What can be done to check if this is the problem and how do we stop this? </s>
<s> Could someone be piggybacking onto our antique connection? </s>
<s> We don't have a firewall (yes I know! </s>
<s> ), and I don't think the XP firewall is in active status. </s>
<s> I've never used a firewall either, so don't know much about them. </s>
<s> One of the other laptops says that the internet is already being used when we go online. </s>
<s> Both computers have Norton AV & internet protection, Spybot, & Spyware Blaster installed with definitions up to date and no infections showing. </s>
<s> I'm a rank amateur so please try to explain what to check or do as simply as possible. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> You take this back to Dell until its solved. </s>
<s> Since you are not using wireless, that is not the issue. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
