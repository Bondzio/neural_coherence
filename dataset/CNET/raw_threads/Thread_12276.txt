Symptoms: computer runs extremely slowly; windows and applications continually stop responding, sometimes temporarily, often permanently. Internet browser (IE 6.0) is a waste of time; web pages can take hours to open, if at all, despite my disabling the &quot;Show pictures&quot; option, disabling Windows XP firewall and uninstalling antivirus software (and all innessential software). The only operation my PC seems to be able to handle reasonably well is typing in NotePad (typing in MS Word 2002 entails waiting several minutes after every keystroke). Did a clean reinstallation of Windows XP Professional but that made no difference. After running well for about two years, my computer is now practically useless, (was hoping to get another year's use out of it). The diagnostic card is installed in a PCI or ISA slot; following is an explanation from the manual of what it does: &quot;When the machine is turned on, the hexadecimal display should show the various POST codes as the system executes (unless it has a rare BIOS that does not display POST codes). If the machine does not boot, system POST has detected a fatal fault and stopped. The number showing in the hexadecimal display on the Diagnostic Card is the number of the test in which POST failed.&quot; When I boot up the card display quickly runs through a few numbers and stops on 26. This is puzzling to me because my computer does boot up, albeit very slowly, contrary to the above description, which suggests that the card display should only stop at a number if the machine does not boot. An appendix in the manual lists all POST codes for the main BIOS vendors, and includes the following information: &quot;Error Code 26 Award (26)Enable slots 6;Initialize slot 6.Test protected mode exceptions.&quot; I would very much appreciate some help to understand what this means, and possibly a suggestion for further action I could take to diagnose the problem. I contacted the card vendor about this but they are Chinese and don't understand English. Motherboard: FIC AD11 CPU: AMD Athlon 1.2GB BIOS: Award ABA46 Internet connection: 56kb/s modem

For all intents and purposes, most POST cards are for &quot;dead systems&quot; thus they can help pinpiont the cause of failure. On top of that, any repair may exceed the value of the mtrbd. if cause or end device, like HD, etc. Its value is for mutliple similar systems, were repairs cards can easily be swapped into for quick uptime. POST cards are just another tool for the toolkit. Your sysptoms appears to be the action of malware, like a trojan or virus, etc. If you have an AV pgm, use it with latest update. Even if it comes back with good results, you gotta try it to eliminate that. I suspect further if you have a clean report, the cpu fan or other fan could be failing, if cpu, they tend to slowdown when up against &quot;heat problems&quot; or reboot frequently. AMD cpus are power hungary so a stable power supply is a most, especially it seems your 1.2, Throuhbred class. Open case with cover off observe operation of all fans and check for noise levels as well. If too noisy, suggests a bad fan. These are my guesses for now... good luck -----Willy

However, the best it did was 101,000 files (that took about 5 days) before disappearing, and it had found no infection up to that point. I have 3 HDDs and 5 partitions and it was on the final partition and had about 30,000 files to go when it gave up. All the remaining files were mp3s, so I doubt any of those contain viruses or trojans. I did the obvious things like checking fans, which are not unusually noisy, and the system doesn't spontaneously restart. It just seems to be extremely low on resources, and Windows itself and any other processes continually stop responding. I know that repairs are generally more expensive than the mobo itself, but I hoped that I might diagnose it myself and do the repairs. I know that to replace it I will also need to replace the CPU and RAM (it has 768MB of DDR RAM) because newer components would be incompatible with the older ones.

Norton AV-2002 needs to updated to latest release. No AV pgm. will completely do the job as trojan are many times missed or the latest threat is not yet imposed for the AV pgm. On top of all this you should look into reducing, shutting down any startup pgms., and/or terminate backgrd running tasks leaving only required ones. If no virus is found, consider again that too many tasks are running or a corrupt one is at fault, even the Norton AV will impose a drain on resources as that maybe also a cause, low resources in general. You can select what HDs to scan also, so recheck that to directly scan a single HD/partition whether than the whole HD at once just to get past hang-ups. PLus, in no way is it normal for scan to take days. Below are several pgm. scanners, etc. to help, choose whatever suits you: Info was cut&pasted and updated from various sources. -----Willy (edited for brief content) For *dead links* try the core url, for the homepage of the desired pgm..
