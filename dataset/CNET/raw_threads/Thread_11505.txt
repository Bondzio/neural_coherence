Tips plz	Ok, I'm building my first computer and I was wondering if this is a good build for online gaming and what not, it's not meant to be top of the line stuff. Motherboard: Intl Desktop Board D915PBL ATX Socket 775 Processor: Intel Pent.4 530J Prescott 800MHz FSB 1MB L2 Cache LGA 775 processor Graphics Card: Radeon X800XL Vid. Card, PCIe, 256MB DDR. Any Tips or pointer or problems? Also, does this configuration work?? Thanks for help. Also, what it's the difference between DDR-SDRAM and DDR3-SDRAM? which is better 256 Mb DDR or 128 Mb DDR3?? thanks again

If you're a die hard ATI fan, this sytem will perform well and you'll get good gaming results. If you're not a die hard ATI fan, you might want to consider a motherboard powered by Nvidia's Nforce 4 SLI Intel edition board. The PCI-E card you selected has a Nvidia counterpart that would be SLI ready and you could add a second video card at a latter date provided you could locate an identical card (same manufacturer and card model) Another option is to go with a AMD based SLI board ike the rock solid A8N-SLI line of Asus boards. This chipset supports DDR as oposed to the DDR2 spec on the Intel edition SLI. Now if stability is your mandate, my opinion is stick with the Intel processor and board. The difference between ddr and ddr3 is essentially the bandwidth at which it can transfer data. My question about that is are you refering to what type of memory is on the graphics card? If so go with the ddr3. Particularly with a PCI-E spec card. I'm not even sure if regualr ddr is available on any PCI-E cards and if you were talking about system memory, ddr3 is not available for that configuration, you'd have to use the DDR2 specified for that motherboard. Another thing to think about is many people don't realize the importance of a quality power supply. Make sure you have adequate power to run your rig or you'll end up with a whole host of problems you don't want, especially your first build. I recommend Antec, OCZ, Enermax, or Thermaltake.

I'm assuming you have monitor/key board/mouse/speakers/printer. DOn't forget windows and arctic silver 5 thermal compound, optical drives, case, hard drives, and psu? AMD 64 3200+ and cheap MSI or Gigabyte motherboard would be alright. Roger

Card, PCIe, 256MB DDR.&quot; This is last years equipment. You really should have some room to upgrade. I suggest an intel 945 motherboard or an ATI 200 Chipset. This will allow you to use Dual core chips in the future. I am personally partial to AMD chips. You should be able to get a Nvidia Nforce 4 chipset motherboard and an AMD 3500 for the same price. You would have much better performance and and have the ability to upgrade and overclock. For a few more $$ you could get an SLI motherboard and a GeForce 6600GT graphics card. This would alow you to go duual card in the future.
