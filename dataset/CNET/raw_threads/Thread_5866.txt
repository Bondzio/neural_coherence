Just purchased a Netgear Wireless N-300 Router to use with an HP 311 netbook, equipped with a wireless N card and running Windows XP. I also have a desktop with Windows XP, not that this matters as far as the router is concerned I'm sure. My question is did I purchase the right router to use with my HP, or should I have gone with the more expensive &quot;RangeMax Dual Band Wireless N&quot; router? Your help will be appreciated. Note: The Best Buy people recommended the N-300 Router and seemed to think the Dual Band was overkill.
