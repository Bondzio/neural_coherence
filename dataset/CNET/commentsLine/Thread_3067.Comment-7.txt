i guess i should have told you what my objective was in the first place.
i use adobe after effects and it suggests that you have a considerable amount of ram.
i think it recommends 2gb of ram per processor core.
and also 1 or 2gb reserved for other programs.
so i want to get a bit more ram so i can hopefully increase ae performance and also make it easier to use programs like photoshop and premiere pro at the same time.
also, since i'm canadian, i don't think i can order from newegg unfortunately.
thanks a lot for the knowledge.
