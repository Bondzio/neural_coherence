if you already have a 6-month old file backup on an unpartitioned external drive, can you then impose a partition structure on that external drive and direct your new source disk image to be copied to the newly created (empty) partition on the external drive?
if it's possible, what software packages can accomplish this?
(i'll be using macrium reflect to produce the disk image under vista sp1.)
