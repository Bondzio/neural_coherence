HELP! :)	G'day, I have a Western Digital Home Basics eSata/Firewire/USB2.0 enclosure, which had come with a 1TB &quot;Green&quot; SATA drive. I had hoped to put a 250GB Maxtor MaxLine II SATA drive into it - the one that had been inside my Power Mac G5. But, when a firewire cable is connected, the drive light just flashes on/off at about 1 second intervals, and with a USB cable connected the light stays on full, but both options fail to mount the drive, or even make it visible to the computer - although Disk Utility does take a long time to decide it can't see them... (ie as if it's trying... but fails) Any ideas how I can get the Maxtor to work in there? cheers cosmic

Were you able to find a solution to this problem? Enclosure works fine with another WD HD.
