SimpleDrive 320GB USB - installed & works fine, backed up my MacBook Lepeord OS with Time Machine -no problems. Used SimpleTech instructions for Windows & Mac users - all well. Hooked it up to my Dell Dimension 4600 with XP. Checked the Device manager - it says it's working properly. Tried rolling back the driver - it says it's fine. Tried replacing the USB cord - nothing. Tried 5 different USB ports - still not showing in &quot;My Computer&quot; Finally - tried it on a new Dell Inspirion 1525 with Vista - same issue. But i did manage to get it to partition part of the drive - but only 128megs. And it still isn't recognized back on my Dell 4600. One problem is that this Dell won't let me partition it. The only thing i can choose from &quot;Disk Management&quot; is properties or help. From all I've read, the only thing i can guess is that i need to partition it, but neither windows program will let me do that. FYI - i also have another External drive (seagate) which i use on the Dell 4600 and never had a problem - have tried unplugging it, using it's port, etc. to no avail. What now?

Here was the fix - seems i had to return to the Mac to fix it. Here you go for other Mac & Windows users: To format the drive on your Mac, follow the steps below. Notes: All data on external will be destroyed during formatting process! 1. Connect and power the drive. 2. Open MacHD on your desktop 3. Open Applications 4. Open Utilities 5. Open Disk Utility 6. On the left you should see the hard drive listed. It should show the size with a second indented line beneath that says simpledrive or untitled. Highlight the line with the size. 7. Click erase at the top of the screen 8. Select the format you want in the volume format box. MS-Dos if you want to use the drive between Mac and Windows. 9. Change the name of the drive if desired. 10. Click erase at the bottom of the screen, you will get a warning where you will click erase again. When the partitioning is completed then the drive will be ready for use.

When I click the info button regarding the drive, it has a line that says the drive can't be reformatted, even though all of the literature provided with the drive says it will work as MS-DOS thanks for any help you can provide!
