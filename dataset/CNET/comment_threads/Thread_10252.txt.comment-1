I really would like to know how to safely overclock my eMachines T6412 with AMD Athlon 64 3400+ cpu on a MICRO-STAR MS-7184 motherboard with Phoenix Technologies, LTD BIOS that is version 6.00 PG (date: 08/19/2005).
The cpu is just about 2.2 ghz at stock and I already tried to look in the BIOS to change the clock multipliter, frequency settings, or voltage settings, but it seems like eMachines hid those settings from me, probably so they would get less service calls.
And now I would like to know if there are any software programs that wold let me overclock through windows or if there is anything to do in the BIOS, I tell you I looked everywhere and I can't find anything in there.
Any help would greatly be appreciated, thank you.
