3676	0	571239	5352100	NR	JJBaritone	8/26/12 12:14 PM	1.34598324E12	Computer connects to router but not Internet	In my home, we have a router with 3 computers connected: One desktop, plugged into the router One laptop, connected wirelessly Another desktop, connected wirelessly The second desktop lost Internet access on Friday, although it still connects with the router. The other computers have not had any problems, and we did not make any changes to the setup. I thought that perhaps a McAfee update was affecting the second desktop, since none of the other computers use McAfee. After uninstalling McAfee, however, the problem persists. I've researched the problem online and tried lots of suggested remedies, with no luck. The desktop having the problem is running Vista. In case it helps, heres the &quot;ipconfig /all&quot; output for the problem computer: Windows IP Configuration Host Name . . . . . . . . . . . . : HM-PC Primary Dns Suffix . . . . . . . : Node Type .

3676	1	571239	5352131	5352100	Kees_B	8/26/12 12:34 PM	1.34598444E12	Re: no connection	So it's NOT connected to the router, because it has a 169.xxx autoconfiguration IP-address in stead of getting the usual 192.xxx address from the router via DHCP. I'd remove the wireless connection and the laptop detect it again. You'll have to re-enter the password. If it fails, try a system restore back to when it still worked. If after the system restore it still doesn't work, it might be a hardware issue. Some other things to try: - check the wireless switch or the program to enable/disable wireless; those are the things you use in an airplane to switch it off). To confirm that it's hardware, boot from a Ubuntu Live disk and see if that works - a public hotspot or with a friend - remove the connection and let Windows detect it again (you'll have to re-enter the password) Kees
3676	2	571239	5352106	5352131	JJBaritone	8/26/12 1:31 PM	1.34598786E12	still no Internet connection	Thanks for your response, Kees. I'm not quite sure how to do what you suggested. I have gone through the Network and Sharing Center on the problem desktop to disconnect it from the wireless connection and reconnect it, several times. Also, the computer connects to the router automatically every time I restart the computer. I'm not sure how to get the problem computer to &quot;forget&quot; the router password, but I tried changing the password it uses to connect, at which point it failed to connect to the router. Then I changed it back to the correct password, and it connected to the router again, but still no Internet access. There is no wireless switch on the desktop, the computer runs on Windows Vista (not Ubuntu), and I can't take it to a public hotspot, but I'll see if I can find a system restore point. If that works, I'll post an update. If there are any other suggested solutions, please let me know!
3676	3	571239	5352109	5352106	Kees_B	8/26/12 2:06 PM	1.34598996E12	Re: connection	It connects automatically, because it's a defined connection. If you remove it totally (like you do with the different connections your laptop found during its life on all places it ever was) you'll have to redefine it. Won't harm and might help. Although changing the password should have the same effect. Still, it was clear from your ipconfig output, that the DHCP didn't work. So it's only a partial connection you now have. If you hover your mouse over the wireless connection symbol on right side of the taskbar, you most likely see something about 'limited or no connectivity'. That's a well known problem ( https://www.google.com/search?q=limited+or+no+connectivity+vista ). A bad password is one of possible causes. You can run any computer on Ubuntu, by just booting from a disk you burn yourself. It's totally independent on whatever it runs when booting from disk (such as Windows Vista). But if it connects (albeit limited) I suspect some software or setting issue, not the hardware. If system restore doesn't work, and none of 'solutions' you find, a sure solution (although it takes some time) is a clean install of Windows Vista, back to factory settings. A Kees

I never figured out how to totally remove a network connection, but it looks like it's a moot point now. As for what caused the problem, I don't know if it was McAfee; I'd read that a recent McAfee update caused people to lose Internet access. To be safe, I installed AVG on the problem desktop and uninstalled McAfee. Who would have thought that after all the connection settings I changed and commands I entered, something as simple as System Restore would solve the problem? That's a lesson I won't soon forget!
