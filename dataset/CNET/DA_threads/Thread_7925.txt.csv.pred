1.1.4	If I do remove the writer , can I hook it up just like the writer ?	Ques
1.2.1	Your system should be capable of having both .	St
1.2.2	It can also do well with just one , being the new burner .	St
1.2.3	Alot depends on your usage , so take it from there .	St
1.2.4	Install both for now and if you feel later you 're really not getting the use out of both , then stick with the new .	St
1.2.5	Yes , you can install the new burner as your old , but remember to remove/delete any old s/w related to the old drive .	St
