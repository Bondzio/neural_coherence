I'll be buying the parts to put together myself or have someone do it for me. 1 - I will not be using the internet and don't need a modem. 2 - I will not be playing any games except &quot;Chessmaster 10&quot; 3 - I will not be needing a serial or parallel port 4 - I will not be needing a floppy drive 5 - I do alot of DVD conversions to AVI files 6 - I want to be able someday to watch Blue Ray movies on my system (I don't want the Blue Ray Drive now however) 7 - I will not be a monitor at the moment 8 - I'd like to use the Intel Core 2 CPUs. I'd like to start with the 8400 (45 nano) Core 2 Duo and someday move up to Core 2 Quad 9 - In a motherboard, I like it to support either the P35 or P45 chipset. I do believe both of these support the Core 2 Quad 45 nano. 10 - Video card should be able to handle Blue Ray and also have HDMI output. Right now my AMD XP system was built in 2002 and I think it's about time to get a new one - Tks David

Get the Intel Core 2 QUAD CPU. Even the cheapest one will pay back in your video conversions and later the BR playback. 2. Video card should be able to handle Blue Ray and also have HDMI output. I like cards from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,1987.html Just go down the list till you find your HDMI output. BEWARE THAT THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PLAY BLURAY MEDIA ONTO HDTV. Look up Windvd and more to discover that it's sometimes an issue until you get all the software. Bob
