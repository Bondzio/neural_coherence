i recently purchased a yamaha cavit dp-u50 personal sound receiver for the pc.
i also purchased the yamaha ns-u50 speakers as well.
how do i get these speakers to work with this receiver and did i buy the wrong speakers???
the receiver has rca plugs but the speaker are the normal &quot;bare wire&quot; connections.
i am getting no sound from this setup.
please, anyone, help!
lol
