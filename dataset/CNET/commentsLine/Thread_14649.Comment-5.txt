but there is no dedicated machine on the network which is always on.
all machine are personal systems and they are normally turned off.
so if it requires a pc which can be used to set the user profiles, and it can be turned on and off then it should be ok. but if it requires a pc which should be always on then we would have a problem.
can you help me clarify this doubt.
thanks,
