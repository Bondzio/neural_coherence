Well that was a good idea.
Unfortunately, when I put myself in as a user on the Windows 2000 computer, nothing changed on the Windows XP end or the Windows ME end.
I noticed another anomaly.
The Windows 2000 computer shows up on the network even if it is powered down.
Neither of the others shows up when powered down.
