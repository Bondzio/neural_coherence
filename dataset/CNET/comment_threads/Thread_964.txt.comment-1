I built a new system with an intel core 2 duo cpu.
The opening screen on bootup shows the processor and says 2 cores.
Xp home only shows a single screen for cpu under task manager, performance.
Using the cpuz program shows only one core.
I installed the hotfix 896256, edited the registry, and added /usepmtimer to boot.ini.
I also uninstalled the processor from device manager and rebooted.
I see from reading the web that xp home should support dual core.
