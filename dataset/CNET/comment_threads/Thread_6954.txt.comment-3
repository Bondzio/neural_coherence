Bob - I downloaded and ran the complete system scan from the link you provided.
The problem persists.
Another symptom: when I connect to a VPN, the problem automatically occurs.
As soon as I disconnect from the VPN, I am able to receive packets again.
It's a cable connection and I'm using an RCA DCM425 cable modem.
The wireless router is a Netgear MR814, but as I mentioned before, this happens both on wireless and when I'm physically connected.
Please let me know if there is any additional information that would be helpful.
I really appreciate it.
