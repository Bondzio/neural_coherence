yea i get reply's across the network when i ping comp1 from comp2 the switch has been there all the time while the network was working, no hardware changes have been made and no significant software changes that i know about.
one interesting thing was zone alarm bringing up 2 prompts of new networks, both were accepeted (this was on the host pc about 8 or so hours before the client was turned on and didnt work) but i've tried turning zone alarm off to no avail &quot;sounds like comp2 is trying to get the dns address from your gateway, comp1.&quot; if i'm understanding that right i think we tried to resolve that by taking the public dns server address from the host pc and inputting them in to the client (comp2) manually instead of the client automatically assigning dns servers but it didn't work
