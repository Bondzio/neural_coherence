1.1.1	I just got a new HP Pavilion Media Center m8530f desktop pc .	St
1.1.2	AMD Phenom X4 9550 Quad Core 750 gb single hard drive nvidia geforce 9300ge windows vista home premium 64-bit / svc pack 1 After setup , I noticed an nvidia icon on the bottom right task bar .	St
1.1.3	I clicked it open and it had something to do with optimizing my hard drive .	St
1.1.4	I clicked ok .	Polite
1.1.5	There was a drop down , default option was stripe ( I do n't remember what the other option was . )	St
1.1.6	I clicked ok , and it ran .	St
1.1.7	Now on boot-up , my pc says it is an Nvidia stripe drive .	St
1.1.8	( There is only 1 hard SATA 750 gb hard disk inside my pc ) , so it seems that I inadvertantly set up my single disk as a raid stripe .	St
1.1.9	I recovered to factory settings , hoping it would revert , but my system still boots as an nvidia strip .	St
1.1.10	I made recovery disks and did a clean boot/reformat from the recovery dvds .	St
1.1.11	Same result .	St
1.1.12	I called HP tech support and was on the phone with them for hours .	St
1.1.13	They could n't fix it ... Would welcome any suggestions on how to revert my pc back to the state before I ran the Nvidia update .	St
1.1.14	The taskbar update from Nvidia never reappeared on any of my reinstallations .	St
1.1.15	The Nvidia control panel does n't seem to have an option to reconfigure my storage devices .	St
1.1.16	It just says there that I have 1 healthy Nvidia stripe ( ~700gb ) .	St
1.1.17	Anybody know how to fix this ?	Ques
1.1.18	Or even if I have to fix this ?	Ques
1.1.19	What happens when I 'm running a single Nvidia stripe ?	Ques
1.1.20	Is the performance of my pc degraded ?	Ques
1.1.21	I do n't plan on getting another hard drive for the forseeable future , so I do n't think I need a raid config ... Please help ...	St
1.2.1	a single drive stripe set performs the same as a single drive so it 's not hurting you in anyway .	St
1.3.1	Thanks .	Polite
1.3.2	I 'll just leave it as is then ...	St
