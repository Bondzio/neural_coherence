Im not going to be using dual graphics cards, but would like to have it run decently quick. And I will be doing a little video editing too. Components I Will Be Using: Mobo - Abit KN9 Ultra Socket AM2 CPU - AMD Athlon 64 X2 5200+ Socket AM2 3 x 300GB Maxtor HDD DVD/RW - Pioneer 111 DVD ROM - Mitsumi Video - ATI X800 XL Audio - Sound Blaster X-Fi PSU - Antec 430 or 480 watt RAM - 2GBs Here are my 2 Questions: 1. Is Dual Channel Memory MUCH better than standard DDR2 Memory? 2. Which Brands Do You Prefer? Corsair, Kingston, Mushkin, Crucial, OCZ, Other? Thank You All In Advance and Have a Happy New Year!

Understand amongest those makers, they can classify thier ram produucts as budget, hi-performance, extreme or have heat exchangers/clips included, etc. Depending on your needs buy what you cab afford or desire. I see no problem with the brands again as you offered. As an added warning, get the best PSU you can afford as you are pushing it with a 480W, even though Antec, if you can get a 500W+, go for it as your system is stuffed. tada -----Willy

Re the best RAM ... it usually pays to start with RAM 'recommended' by the MB mfg for your MB. What's it say ? VAPCMD
