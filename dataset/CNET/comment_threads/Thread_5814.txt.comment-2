ok heres what happened... went to boot up, turned my back for a second to look for my winodows disk, the pc had gone past bios and had begun starting window from my disk drive- so i was chuffed the bios version was f7 im not sure if i still need to flash for f8a (probly) when i checked the system status it showed the E8500 clocked at 3.16, and not 3.12, any reason why that mite be?
i still have a bit of work to do yet, i couldnt help trying to see if it would run a game (i didnt reinstall graphics drivers) but the game got so far until i wanted to start a level then pc restarted - graphics drivers?
probly any way il see what happenes later and will update this post incase there are ppl out there lookin to get a simialar set up.
