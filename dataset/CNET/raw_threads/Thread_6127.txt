I reset the bios and originally the core clock started up at 2.66Ghz like its supposed to. But all of a sudden when i check my temps and clock speeds, it says that its running at 2.0Ghz flat. But when I go into my BIOS before my PC starts, it goes back to regular 2.66. I just cant figure out why its underclocking itself. Also, I know its not a heating problem, it runs at 42C Regularly after being on for a while. Help me?!
