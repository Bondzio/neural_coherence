Nothing is 100 percent safe, all the time, Drives do fail, and disks can fail or get damaged etc.
The thing that I do with all my personal stuff is back it up on multiple places.
I have 3 back up drives, and some stuff is on disks as well.
If one drive fails or is showing signs of failure, then your stuff is safe on another drive.
If you have just bought a new hard drive, then hook it up and let it run for a few hours or days, and if it seems OK, than start writing stuff to it.
What else do you expect to do with it?
