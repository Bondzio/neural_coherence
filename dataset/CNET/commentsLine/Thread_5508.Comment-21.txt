i ended up sending the external hard drive in to a business in town, they pulled it apart, i'm not sure what they actually did to it but when a relative of mine picked it up for me it was still in pieces (yeh they didnt even bother to put it back together after having it for about 10 days) and the only reply was that it was 'dead' and that they couldnt find any data on it that was retrievable.
i wonder if it is worth taking it to someone else as i don't know whether these professionals in town actually went through the processes described by some people here of taking out the actual drive and trying it with another motherboard etc, that is to say i don't know what lengths and processes they went to to try to fix it, so i don't know if i can 'trust' them as one person who posted on here put it, suggesting i find a professional i trust to fix it
