heya folks.
first time poster, long time lurker &gt;.&gt; i've decided to build a computer for gaming.
the last one i built was about four years ago.
i'm really into rts games and the horrible frame-rate on supcom is the last straw.
my current rig was state of the art when i put it together but a long time has passed.
based on my preliminary research, here's what i'm thinking of: cpu: amd athlon 64 fx (dual-core) $215 -i &lt;3 amd, so the cpu was a no-brainer.
motherboard: asus m2n32-sli deluxe $169 or an asus crossfire $237.66 -i really didn't know what motherboard would be best for my purposes, but both came highly recommended for my intended processor.
ram: ddr2-800 pc2-6400 2gb $89.98 x 4= $359.92 -ram wise, well... let's just say i'll probably end up repeating this process another half-decade down the line.
though, i still can't figure out the difference between just buying ram and buying a ram kit.
hard-drive: western digital wd1600ys 160gb sata2 7200mb 16mb bus.
$69.00 -as far as the hard-drive goes, i don't really have a use for uber amounts of space.
so long as it holds the game, faster is better.
video-card: geforce 8800 gtx video card, pcie, sli.
$540 x 2= $1080 -i think either motherboard was really postured for use with nvidia cards, otherwise i probably would've went with rage.
or something.
i marked it down twice because, correct me if i'm wrong, sli requires two of the same cards.
cd/dvd drive: plextor px-810sa $99.48 -i don't write dvds.
i just wanted to be able to put a game in and play.
a cheaper alternative more suited to my needs would be welcome.
case: raidmax katana atx-729wb black steel.
full tower.
$95.98 -i went with a large tower to hold all the stuff in this list.
i'd heard there were particular problems fitting it all into a mid-size.
psu: nspiregear 58655.
850w unit.
$178 -i figured this system would draw roughly 650ish watts.
i wanted to overshoot by roughly 200 just in case.
as another aside, nspire is made by texas instruments, and i loved my ti-82 to death.
literally.
keyboard: logitech g15 $68.99 -dunno.
heard it was good.
macros are are always welcome.
mouse: logitech g7 $56 -sometimes i get a fixation on fps.
it usually ends poorly.
altogether, this should run between $2391.37 - $2460.03, depending on the motherboard.
i've got quite a few concerns before i take the plunge, but i'd like outside opinion before finalizing any decisions.
