Bob, I'm not necessarily blaming XP.
I just think that the processor, chipset, and XP aren't communicating when it comes to APIC.
It could be a hardware issue that Ubuntu ignores and XP doesn't.
Maybe I have a flaky chipset or processor.
I don't usually have this much trouble tracking down problems, but this one has me stumped.
