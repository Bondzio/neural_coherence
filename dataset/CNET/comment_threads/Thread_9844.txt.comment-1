I took my Netgear WGR614v10 back to Walmart and exchanged it for a WNR2000v2.
I find out after I got home that not only is it not windows 7 certified but its not certified for xbox either.
It seems to be working better than the old router on the laptop but when I test my 360 connection I get a moderate NAT warning.
I have followed all the steps listed on the xbox support.
I have forwarded port, set xbox as the DMz.
I don't know what else to do.
The connection seems to be some better but I can't get the NAT changed to open.
Any suggestions on what to do or should I just give it up and order a wireless modem from my ISP and pay $4.00 every month?
Thanks
