1.1.1	So this started happening recently my computer keeps shutting down on its own .	St
1.1.2	I have to turn the power button on the back off and wait a few minutes before turning it back on .	St
1.1.3	I assumed at first it was the power supply .	St
1.1.4	However i remembered to turn my temp and fan speed monitor back on to find that it is overheating which could be turning my computer off as well .	St
1.1.5	Any thoughts ?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Assuming you have checked your power settings in control panel , sounds like a hardware issue .	St
1.3.2	First guess would be power supply is on the way out , could be other things that were mentioned in prior post , heat can also create the issue .	St
1.3.3	The processor fan is a fairly common culprit for that scenario if it is on the way out , slowing down or stopping can send system in to shutdown .	St
1.4.1	Boot to safe mode and check out device manager .	St
1.4.2	Probably a blown driver .	St
1.5.1	Usually fried CPU wo n't allow your system to boot .	St
1.5.2	I think your system has overheat issue .	St
1.5.3	You need to check your CPU temperature .	St
1.5.4	One useful software is called RMCLOCK , it is free for download .	St
1.5.5	It will tell you your CPU work load , and temperature .	St
1.5.6	If CPU is overheat , you might need a better CPU fan .	St
