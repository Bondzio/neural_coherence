do you have a data backup?
it sounds like your drive is corrupted somehow.
so, if you do not have a data backup, you could try to get back all your needed data with the help of some data recovery freeware online, such as recuva, testdisk and icare data recovery free, etc.
if these programs really make no sense, you'd better ask an expert for help.
otherwise, you have no choice but to replace this drive.
