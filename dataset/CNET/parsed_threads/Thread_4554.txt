<s> I have a compaq presario SR1151NX: I changed the HD and in doing so reloaded win xp plus all the drivers which I downloaded from HP web site as I did not have the original disk with drivers. </s>
<s> Everything works fine except no audio I went to the support site for compaq and followed all their instructions and even removed and reinstalled the audio drivers and cannot get sound from the speakers. </s>
<s> the speakers will give off a clicking sound when I plug into the mic connector. </s>
<s> I have the model with digital audio it has 6 audio connectors plus the 2 digital audio connectors. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>

<s> You want that restore CD! </s>
<s> I wish I could find the restore cd. </s>
<s> The instructions I received were much different than the ones you noted. </s>
<s> the ones I got lead me thru a series of bios changes plus downloading &quot;Microsoft Bus Driver&quot; and other procedures. </s>
<s> This was not a downgrade from Vista. </s>
<s> This was a reinstall of Windows XP This machine uses audio codecs, legacy drivers, and Realtek High Definition Audio. </s>
<s> I even went to Realtek and tried their drivers. </s>
<s> I guess I will try to install a audio card and see if that works. </s>
<s> THANKS FOR YOUR HELP. </s>

<s> I'm running into a gluttony of drivers which make me happy I've been installing Windows since Windows 1.0. </s>
<s> Only Microsoft seems to not get it that drivers are too hard for anyone that didn't use DOS. </s>
<s> If the audio driver installs but doesn't work, hurt down the UAA from Microsoft (it's in a KB somewhere) install that, uninstall the audio driver, reboot and if it's like other machines it just works. </s>
<s> No one wants to claim rights to why it's getting so hard for drivers today. </s>

<s> I some difficulty convincing Microsoft that I didn't have the hotfix they said I had it in SP2 but Belarc advisor didn't show it. </s>
<s> They finally sent it and after unzipping it I tried many combinations of installing and unistalling hotfix, drivers, etc. </s>
<s> it just started working and I don't know why and still is. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help RLB </s>
<s> I meant &quot;hunt&quot; rather than hurt. </s>
<s> As you discovered it's likely to be UAA. </s>
<s> That's a &quot;real new&quot; layer in the drivers so you can imagine it's causing more troubles than it solves. </s>
