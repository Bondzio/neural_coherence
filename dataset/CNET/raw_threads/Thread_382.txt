Yet, I'd probably just be using it as a hot-swap device on top of a desktop. It would be nice to be of considerable size so that I could store my OS on it along with other items. I could even go as low as 32gb possibly. I just want something from a reliable company, but I also know that patience is a virtue with internal and external storage.

Let's pick any drive maker and even though they are a reliable company and made millions of drives, that doesn't make the drives any more reliable. Let's read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive#Quality_and_performance That should help. Bob

In fact if you do, seriously reconsider the vendor. A SSD will be fast, but some have proven not to last as long or be as problem free. Many operate well, however when they do have a problem, they just up and die, no clue beforehand, via my experience. So, pick a vendor or maker with a good warranty. I have pointed to and many of the bigger vendors offer them: http://www.crucial.com http://www.kingston.com Beware of the several classes that refer to speed, size and/or data transfer rating, etc.. tada -----Willy
