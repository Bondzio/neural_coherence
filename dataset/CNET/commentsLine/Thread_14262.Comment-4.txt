but remember these issues: 1. ide ports support two devices.
you can cable up more, but it won't work.
having dealt with those that insist, i have such a cable handy so they can try it themselves.
about 1/2 are angry it doesn't work.
the other 1/2 seem to like trying.
2. ide pci cards may not support cd, cdrw, dvd or zip drives so be sure your selected ide card supports what you are going to plug into it.
