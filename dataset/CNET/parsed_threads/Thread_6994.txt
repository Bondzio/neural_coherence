<s> I have a PC, running XP, that has a dual head S-VGA video card. </s>
<s> It came with a cable which splits it to two VGA outs. </s>
<s> So I comfortably run two monitirs at a decent relolution. </s>
<s> One goes to a projector, the other to my monitor. </s>
<s> Cool beans. </s>
<s> Now I have a need for an additional s-video out (carrying the same signal as the projector), which goes to a video switcher, and ultimately to a DVD recorder. </s>
<s> What is the simplest way to accomplish this? </s>
<s> I have an older ALL-IN-Wonder card that could be installed at no cost, but will XP allow that? </s>
<s> svga is not the same as s-video. </s>
<s> Are you looking for an adaptor that would convert svga to s-video? </s>
<s> so long as it has different interface (agp, pci, pci-express) than your primary video card and you have a slot for it. </s>
<s> but you're trying to clone a high-res (s-vga) image onto low-res (s-video) signal. </s>
<s> that's going to be a problem unless a) you're willing to drop the res of one of the s-vga outputs or b) you're prepared to manually switch your video playback between output devices (s-vga or s-video). </s>
<s> ati's video driver can automatically send video to a preferred monitor, but i don't think it can send it to two seperate monitors of different resolutions. </s>
<s> The video cable needs to be connected directly to the TV for Windows to configure and use it properly. </s>
<s> Get a switcher for the TV, not the dvd. </s>
<s> If I have a PCI dual head SVGA, and one VGA card (all-in-wonder), would they not process the signal separately? </s>
