i would look into inkjet myself some more, but i'm terribly scared to see how many ink tanks a set of 150 invitations plus enclosures and envelopes eats up.
$15 x the 8 ink tanks, depending on how quickly it goes through them could be scary.
the last time i used an ink jet to do a one page wedding program in purple ink, i think i went thru 4 or 5 color tanks for 150 sheets of paper.
(this was quite a while ago, so i'm really hoping that technology has caught up).
anyone have feedback on the ink life and does the ink spread or smear at all?
