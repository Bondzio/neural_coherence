I agree with the other poster as &quot;RF&quot; being the possible source of noise.
Afterall, the wireless card uses a signal(RF) to work.
If possible try another slot or relocate speakers.
But, since this also going thru the headphones, you simply are too close to the RF noise.
As you say, the card seems to be the source, then try another brand or replace and/or move the audio card or both.
If these are actually one slot next to the other, oh yeah move them apart.
If the audio is build-in, move only the wireless card.
