i am not familiar with these units.
do you have one type or manufacturer to recommend?
i would like to read up on how they actually work and/or what they actually do.
do they plug into a wall outlet by the router?
or home computer that needs to be hooked up?
i have 3 phase wiring under ground to my shop(router location) and very high power transmission lines next to my shop and house.
do not know if this would help or hurt my situation.
