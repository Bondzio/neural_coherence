1.1.2	Now when im trying to remove my old celeron 2.4 socket 478 from my asrock p4vm8 mobo , the celeron cpu wo n't come out .	St
1.1.3	I pulled that stick up all the way , but i wo n't budge .	St
1.1.4	Should i use like a knife to pry it out , cause im afraid that i might damage the celeron cpu with the knife .	St
1.1.5	So any idea 's on how to get the old celeron cpu out ?	Ques
1.2.1	to say take it easy , take it slow .	St
1.3.1	the HSF from the CPU ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.2	If so , you should simply gently twist [ rotate ] the HSF back and forth a few times .	St
1.3.3	That 'll usually break the bond between the HSF and CPU caused by the thermal compound .	St
1.3.4	If you are lifting up with the ZIF lever still in the down/locked position you may cause real problems .	St
1.4.1	I lifted up the lever and tried pulling it out , but it wont budge .	St
1.4.2	Im not talking about the heat sink fan .	St
1.5.1	to pry against ... use something like a wooden pencil or a popsicle stick..something small enough you can use to protect the MB .	St
1.6.1	Just to cover the & quot ; not always obvious & quot ; : Is CPU fan and heatsink unfastened from the motherboard ?	Ques
1.7.1	lever , fully up should make it totally free , [ as you know ] .	St
1.7.2	Tough to imagine how any adhesive type material could be there and still have the CPU work .	St
1.7.3	Maybe someone really grossly overdid the thermal compound .	St
1.7.4	Please be sure to tell us what you find .	St
