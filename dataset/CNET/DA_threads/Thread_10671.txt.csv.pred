1.1.1	I have a Linksys wired network, and I want to hook my old computer system up to it.	St
1.1.2	This computer does not have a ethernet port, so I have to get a USB Adapter.	St
1.1.3	But, the adapters that Linksys makes, I hear, are very fragile and in all likelyhood would break very soon, seeing as I am a very clumsy and rough person.	St
1.1.4	Could I use a Belkin USB adapter to hook up to my linksys network?	St
1.2.1	are using the same set of rules.	St
1.2.2	The only issues are support from multiple vendors who will blame the other guys device when it doesn't work.	St
