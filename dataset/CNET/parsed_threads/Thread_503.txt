<s> Hi, I have 4 pc's: 2 win 98's, 1 winXP, and a new win Vista. </s>
<s> One of the 98 computers had the printer (hp deskjet series 5550). </s>
<s> I took the printer off that pentium II win 98 box (pc due to retire) and installed the printer directly connected to the new Vista box. </s>
<s> That went well. </s>
<s> (enough). </s>
<s> I added the printer as a network printer to the win XP machine, and printed a test page. </s>
<s> Wow, that went well! </s>
<s> I tried to &quot;add printer&quot; on the pentium 4 win 98 box. </s>
<s> :.-&lt; &quot;Browse for network printer&quot; will not find the printer connected to the Vista box. </s>
<s> I can't guess a path to the printer that works from the 98 box. </s>
<s> In XP shared printer is ok, in 98 &quot;add printer&quot; can't find shared printer, printer works well locally in Vista. </s>
<s> How do I use Vista printer from Win 98 computer? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> B </s>
<s> Hey, What needs to happen: Go into Properties of your Printer on Vista and under the Sharing tab click on &quot;Additional Drivers&quot; and check Win 98, this should do the trick. </s>
<s> It might want the drivers disk to do this, if you dont have a disk, google for win98 drivers. </s>
<s> This is the process to add drivers to an XP box, the Vista process might be a little different, but similar, look around for similar settings or titles to the ones I mentioned. </s>
<s> Whoa! </s>
<s> That makes sense! </s>
<s> I will give it a try. </s>
<s> B </s>
<s> In fact, it turns out that I added XP that way. </s>
<s> In Vista when I go to add drivers I get to choose by *processor*, not OS. </s>
<s> That's why I did not remember doing this. </s>
<s> The choices are: Itanium, x64, x86. </s>
<s> I'm beginning to feel non-supported by Vista! </s>
<s> Still, I oughtta be able to *find* the shared printer. </s>
<s> I'm gonna go look for it again. </s>
<s> Thanks Scottwang! </s>
