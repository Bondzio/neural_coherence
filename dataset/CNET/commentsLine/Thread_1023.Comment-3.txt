unless a member who is using the app comes on the boards the rest of us are left guessing.
hp says your machine has vista/64.
i could tell you to add ram.....won't hurt anything.....but if your not using all the 4gb won't be of much value.
ram&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2x2gb.......50 bucks.
your machine has integrate video.
avid suggest a dedicated video card.
gpu &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hd4550/5450.......50 bucks.
you might want to spend a little time with task manager and perf monitor......windows tools.
you don't have to become a wizard with these tools just a basic understanding will let you spot where the machine needs a little help.
