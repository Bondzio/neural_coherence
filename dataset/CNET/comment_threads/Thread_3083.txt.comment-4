I see the books cover server 2003.
The server we use is 2000 with the concept be the same?
Also do I need to purchase all six books or could you make a suggestion?
Sorry to bother you with such trivial questions I am new to all of this and learning as I go.
It can be very frustrating.
We do not have the money to hire a real IT person.
Thanks again for your time and assistance
