thanks for your help thus far, bob.
but since i swapped in the new power supply, things have been running as smooth as a gravy sandwich.
but, if it follows the pattern, things will go belly up in a month or two... the good news is, i can't think of anything else to replace!
thanks again for your prompt responses!
