there have been attempts to do so in software or via file systems, but this doesn't work like the solid switch or slide on floppies (remember those) or tapes.
cdr/w and dvdr/w are rendered unwritable by placing such in a dvd or cd drive that can't write.
this area is full of solutions but no one can agree on best.
the usual office backup is a central server to store the files that need backup, then some tape drive to cart the data off site in case of a disaster.
this all starts when the person responsible writes... &quot;my business's disaster recovery plan&quot;.
the drive you spoke of will do in a pinch, but is not &quot;backup&quot;.
it's a volatile copy.
