i have 2 western digital external drives.
the problem i am having is sometimes my photos will be 'gray' half way down to the bottom.
and they become unusable.
the wierd thing is this.
i recently purchased a slide program that i can see the whole photo but if i try to use it i only see a blank black space.
but when i click on the photo again from within the program (not putting it in a slide show), what i see is 3 of the same photo one each on top of the other at different levels.
i hope this is making sense.
i am afraid to open my photos on the externals as it ruins them...has anyone else had this problem or know what it might be that is causing this?
