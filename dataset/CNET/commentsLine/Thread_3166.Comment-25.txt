google tracked their hd failures.
you can read the full report here:  the main point is: &quot;in general, google's hard drive population saw a failure rate that was increasing with the age of the drive.
within the group of hard drives up to one year old, 1.7% of the devices had to be replaced due to failure.
the rate jumps to 8% in year 2 and 8.6% in year 3. the failure rate levels out thereafter, but google believes that the reliability of drives older than 4 years is influenced more by &quot;the particular models in that vintage than by disk drive aging effects.&quot; i would think the same applies to an external drive, but since you only use it for backup, maybe you do what i do.
i only turn mine on when i run the backup.
that's once a week for about 15 minutes.
i expect mine to last a long time.
