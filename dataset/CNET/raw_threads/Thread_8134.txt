14463	0	108491	1235772	NR	William Wagner	6/10/05 11:43 AM	1.11840378E12	wireless signal drops	I have bought a DI-524 wireless router. I followed all the instructions to configure the router's hardware and software and after several calls to D-Link, I achieved success. I have my notebook connected to LAN Port 1 on the router and an old Windows 98 computer has a D-Link wireless PCI card in it. It all worked. Both computers could access the internet and I set up a small home network successfully. When I turned my notebook on the next morning, my entire D-Link folder and contents had disappeared -- evaporated. It was as though Windows xp had decided it could do a better job of running a wireless newtwork than D-Link configuration could. Much to my surprise, the wireless network still works -- sort of. Every 10 to 60 seconds, a balloon pops up in the system tray of my notebook telling me a network cable is unplugged, but it isn't. The system instantly reconnects itself and I can carry on surfing the internet. My internet phone which I use for long distance calls and my Live365 radio, both of which I have used for years without problems, disconnect each time the balloon comes up -- but these two applications will not automatically reconnect as the internet will. So, I can not use my PCPhone or listen to internet radio anymore. The strangest of all is that yesterday, I had a whole day of no balloons or dropped signals. Everything worked perfectly. I listened to the radio and made several VOIP calls. The days before I had problems. Today I have problems. Yesterday, I had no problems. I have added no software or hardware. I have made no changes. Can anyone offer advice? I'm at my wit's end.
