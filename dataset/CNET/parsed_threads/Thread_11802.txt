<s> Does anyone have power consumption or battery life information on the Core solo vs. the Core duo chips? </s>
<s> Rumors suggest the new macbook will be in both core solo and duo. </s>
<s> I don't plan on doing any major computing projects beyond the occasional iLife project so would one thing I would need the core duo? </s>
<s> Is the cpu power vs. battery life difference worth getting the solo over the duo? </s>
<s> Does getting a duo over the solo add much in terms of longevity to the latptop? </s>
<s> Guess we will have to wait until both such machines exists before we can start making any form of comparisons. </s>
<s> As soon as Apple announces the versions, you can be assured that there will be comparisons made P </s>

<s> This information is gleaned from intel.com and why you may find the dual core may win in low power modes. </s>
<s> The final outcome may have to wait for real hardware. </s>

<s> I recently got a new Sony laptop with a Core Duo processor, and since it runs at the same 1.8 GHz clock speed as my other Dell with a Centrino, I decided to do some performance testing. </s>
