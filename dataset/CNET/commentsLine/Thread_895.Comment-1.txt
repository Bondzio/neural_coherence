my epson stylus c-62 printer has recently started printing only part of a page, even if i print a multiple page document, i get only the top part of the pages- sometimes just a few lines, sometimes half the page, sometimes two thirds of a page.
this happens no matter what my source is, word, notepad, internet, it does not matter.
it worked fine when i was using windows 98, i recently upgraded to windows xp.
i can't remember if it started when i changed over or if it was awhile after.
my pc is a dell pentium 4,with alot of ram and a large hard drive.
i have tried everything.
please help.
