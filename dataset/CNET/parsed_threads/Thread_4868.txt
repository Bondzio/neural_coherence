<s> Ok, here is my problem. </s>
<s> I had windows 7 installed on my computer, everything was working fine. </s>
<s> I installed Mass Effect 2 on my computer. </s>
<s> Worked fine for about, oh, 2 hours. </s>
<s> Then my monitor started to flicker. </s>
<s> Every 30-60 seconds, the screen would go blank for a split second and return back to the game. </s>
<s> To my dismay, not only does this flickering occur in the game, but also in windows. </s>
<s> And the funny thing is, is that it only happens when I do certain things like when the download dialog box pops up, or i pull down a menu list on a website, or when I go to install something. </s>
<s> It seems to me it occurs when something pops up on my screen like a dialog box, but not every dialog box though. </s>
<s> I can neither confirm nor deny that windows 7 and mass effect 2 were legit, so I though viruses were the problem. </s>
<s> Scanned for virus, nothing came up. </s>
<s> Since I recently installed windows 7 on my computer, I thought I could fix it if I did a clean install of windows 7. </s>
<s> This did not work. </s>
<s> Now, I'm back on vista business 32 bit and it is still occurring in the same manner. </s>
<s> Now I'm almost positive this is a hardware issue. </s>
<s> My monitor could not be the problem because the flickering is linked to specific action on the computer. </s>
<s> I've disabled my video card driver and the problem has stopped. </s>
<s> I'm not an expert on hardware issues, could this be a problem with my motherboard, faulty memory, faulty video card?... </s>
<s> It's a 8800gt. </s>
<s> Dell vostro 410. </s>
<s> At just 2 years with many not doing the yearly cleaning (read http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html ) plus BAD CAPS (google that) about half the time I find it's not drivers or pop ups. </s>
<s> Good sleuthing on the drivers but here's the deal. </s>
<s> Windows 7 is better than the prior versions on drivers but far from done. </s>
<s> Try the usual. </s>
<s> Remove the case cover and point a fan at it. </s>
<s> The reason you make me think it is heat related is the 2 hours. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You say that you think it is heat related, do you think it is damaged? </s>
<s> even when my computer is not in intensive applications (Crysis), it still flickers. </s>
<s> I don't think blowing off some dust at this point will help if the GPU is damaged. </s>
<s> And the 2 hours was why I thought heat. </s>
<s> As to damage, the only true test is to swap the card since the makers do not supply diagnostics. </s>
