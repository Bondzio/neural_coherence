i am almost sure this is a hardware compatability issue but someone let me know what they think.
i bought a barebone kit( ecs motherboard, duron 1.3).
when i first tried to load windows 2k it finished but had missing files(ie and others).
since i cannot get the setup to finish.
always get message #### file missing cannot complete setup.(ex.
inf file txtsetup.sif corrupt or missing) sometimes i get an i/o error 0010101. anyway, i have tried diff.
os's and boot disk etc.
but linux loads and runs fine.
my main question is how can i check the hardware compatibility with windows?
any other suggestions are welcome as i have been trying to get this machine working for over a month.
thanks for any help
