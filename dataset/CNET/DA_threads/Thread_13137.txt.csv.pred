1.1.1	Given the problems with trying to use WINE / Crossover Office , VMWare , Bochs and other non-solutions , is there hardware that can simulate two PCs , allowing one to load two operating systems and comfigure how much memory to allocate to each OS perhaps in CMOS / BIOS if in the motherboard or by a Windows , DOS , or Linux program otherwise ?	Ques
1.1.2	There are a few concerns of mine here .	St
1.1.3	There are bound to be some device-related issues here .	St
1.1.4	Perhaps have some devices accessable by only one OS at a time such as sound cards .	St
1.1.5	I am not so sure this is appropriate /workable for displays .	St
1.1.6	Another real concern would be bus mastering devices .	St
1.1.7	The only search terms and phrases I can think of lead to irrelevant results .	St
1.2.1	I use 2 machines and a KVM switch to get to each machine .	St
1.2.2	Cheaper on my time ... Bob	St
1.3.1	I suspect you are n't saving much .	St
1.3.2	I suppose one might manage to use an Ethernet card to boot over a network and make one of the machines diskless ( no hard drive , floppy drives or CD / DVD drives ) and perhaps no sound or USB as well ( or use USB instead of Serial ATA ) .	St
1.4.1	I somehow forgot the two biggest expenses .	St
1.5.1	I 'm sharing my solution to emulating a machine with two minds .	St
1.5.2	Given today 's hardware prices , it 's the cheap way out .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Time is something that costs more than the hardware here .	St
1.6.2	If I were to spend time trying to get one machine to pretend it was two , the hours would exceed the cost of my solution .	St
1.6.3	Cheers , Bob	St
1.7.1	from Microsoft This was a quick Goggle search , research some more .	St
1.7.2	Virtual PC applications are hwd intensive and Bob 's suggestion may have more merit .	St
1.7.3	Bill	St
1.8.1	I am asking if there is a ( primarily at least ) hardware-based solution .	St
1.8.2	Software based solutions , to use an AT & T phrase & quot ; just is n't worth it. & quot ;	St
1.9.1	Many years ago I was allowed only one PC at my desk .	St
1.9.2	So I found a cube box that held 2 motherboards .	St
1.9.3	The KVM sat on top and I met the goal of just one PC .	St
1.9.4	Hope this helps .	St
1.9.5	Bob	St
1.10.1	Or Virtual machine , take your pick .	St
1.10.2	But it 's kinda like toggling between the two .	St
1.10.3	You can switch with out rebooting .	St
1.10.4	One kind of hibenates while the other is active .	St
1.10.5	Now if you get yourself one of the big IBM water cooled main frames from 15 years ago you could do it easly .	St
1.10.6	I do it Bob 's way .	St
1.10.7	John	St
