<s> I have tried 3 keyboard apps so far (Samsung, kii, SwiftKey 3) and the cursor jumps around when I'm editing. </s>
<s> With the stock keyboard it doesn't seem to be a problem but the keyboard is terrible so I'd like to try something else. </s>
<s> I have been very careful to have nothing touching the screen and I don't have a cover on my tablet, not even a screen cover. </s>
<s> Any idea what setting needs to be changed, or anything else I can do? </s>
<s> Also, does anyone know how to calibrate a touch screen? </s>
<s> Everything seems to be off by a row (swype, radio buttons). </s>
<s> details : Samsung tab 2, and version 4.1.1 Thanks in advance for your help, Julie </s>
<s> I added a bluetooth keyboard to my Nexus as those touch screens are primitive. </s>
<s> That is, good enough to mash big buttons but for fine work, not that great. </s>
