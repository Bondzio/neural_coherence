12705	0	540081	5196146	NR	hanshalskrause	9/1/11 8:08 AM	1.31486448E12	PC upgrade	Hey Hey, &lt;div&gt;I just want to get quick advise. I have an old computer with the following: &lt;div&gt;Gigabyte GA P35 DS3 something like that 2,6 GHz Core 2 Duo Intel XFX Geforce 8800 GTS 2GB Memory &lt;/div&gt; to me it looks like the video card is the slowest part, so I thought I could replace the video card by maybe a GTX 260 or a GTX 460 or something like that. What do you think? Ah, my goal is to have a few more fps in games and I don't want to spend the money on a complete new computer. Thanks already Tobi &lt;/div&gt;

I had a 400mhz,a 1.2mhz,and 2.4mhz PCs on my LAN a few yrs ago...all were maxed with ram.I have alot of dated nvdia video cards laying around,so i eperimented.I was curious if a slow machine would benefit from a fast video card.I started with a 32MB in the 400,then 64,128,and finally a 256 (all cards used the same nvidia driver so it was easy.THANKS NVIDIA ! I installed tiger woods 2003 and went to work.I figured anything above a 32 or 64 would be useless overkill on that ancient 400,but i was wrong.The game ran smoother,and smoother untill i reached my 256 ceiling. I still have that 1.2,and just installed lord of the rings on it.The game demands a 1.8 cpu min,yet my 1.2 runs it smooth with a 7600GS (512mb) installed.(even though the 7600 wants a 8x AGP slot,and the 1.2 only supports a 4x) Experiment results say fast video cards are worth it,in ANY machine.CPU's are a distant second in comparison.
