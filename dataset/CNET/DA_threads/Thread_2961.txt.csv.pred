1.1.1	Hello !	St
1.1.2	I have a custom PC i built a while back , and i have noticed some games do not run as good as they should be with the part i am using .	St
1.1.3	I have done a benchmark , and the only component that is slower than normal is the CPU .	St
1.1.4	Passmark Performance test 's website says an Intel C2Q Q8400 gives an average of 3,680 CPU marks .	St
1.1.5	Mine only gets 2800-2900 .	St
1.1.6	Here are the relevant specs : Motherboard : XFX nforce 750i OS : Windows 7 ( SP1 ) 32bit Memory : 2.50 Gigs DDR2 RAM @ 800Mhz CPU : Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) 2 Quad CPU Q8400 @ 2.66GHz Video Card : Asus NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 768 Mb PSU : Thermaltake 600Watt Other Thoughts : a while back , my system was worse and only ran at 667 Mhz FSB by default but i finally changed that to 800 a month ago .	St
1.1.7	It improved performance some .	St
1.1.8	( from 2600 marks to 2800 ) In Passmark Performance Test , it reads my CPU speed as 2.044Ghz , it should read somewhere around 2.667 Ghz http : //i52.tinypic.com/28s6deb.jpg My computer runs perfectly fine ( other than im not getting the gaming performance i should be ) its a fast , modern computer runs windows 7 beautifully and never hangs .	St
1.1.9	It plays Portal 2 , COD4 , Fallout 3 , and L4D at around 60 FPS or higher , Maxed settings at 1920x1080 ( thanks to the video card ) Several other games give me much lower Framerates , even at the lowest possible resolutions and settings such as NFS Shift ( 20 ) , Dirt 2 ( 27 ) , and Crysis Demo ( 25 ) I gather from this it is a Insufficiency in CPU performance that is the cause .	St
1.1.10	I know i should be getting better results from my Processor , What can i do to Make it run like it should ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //ark.intel.com/Product.aspx ? id=38512 Hmm , my HP d4999t is on 64 bit 7 and is very nice .	St
1.2.2	But I opted for 64 bit so I do n't cramp the OS and drivers into the 32 bit space plus I know to install the Intel Rapid app .	St
1.2.3	There could be other factors such as the maker 's choice or slow RAM but since I own a few quad cores I thought I 'd share .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Going to your BIOS , and disable EIST/Speedstep , and C1E state .	St
1.3.2	This stops the system from automatically changing the multiplier ... rerun the test and see what results you get .	St
1.3.3	Let us know .	St
1.3.4	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	I disabled EIST , but i did n't find C1E .	St
1.4.2	Somehow ... it performed worse on the benchmark than with it enabled .	St
1.4.3	I retested it with both settings a few times to make sure .	St
1.4.4	CPUZ Shows My proccesor at normal stats .	St
1.4.5	333x8 2.66ghz , but passmark 's & quot ; measured CPU speed & quot ; is always on the low side ( and it varies every time i open it ) the only other CPU settings i could find in the BIOS are : CPU Function - & gt ; Execute bit support ( disabled ) , Set CPUID Maxval to 3 ( disabled ) i 'm not sure what these mean but i will test them out	St
1.5.1	It could be the 32 bit OS slowing it down ...	St
1.5.2	But would it really make such a difference ?	Ques
1.5.3	ill have to borrow a friend 's 64 bit and see the difference .	St
1.5.4	Lol , i kind of have RAM from all over the place .	St
1.5.5	I have 2x 512 OCZ , 1Gb of kingston , and a 512 of.. uh something I know its all 800Mhz though , and the startup hardware check thing says its in dual channel mode.ill try just using One stick and see how that goes	St
1.6.1	With that mismosh of RAM I wonder if that 's taking it down a notch .	St
1.6.2	It certainly ca n't be dual channel even if it reports it is .	St
1.6.3	Sorry if I do n't elaborate why but it 's why I opted for simple 2x2GB sticks .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	correctly .	St
1.7.2	Do you see that CPU speed info during boot and in the BIOS ?	Ques
1.7.3	What results do you get under Windows Performance ?	Ques
1.7.4	Is the PC performing as expected other than the Passmark Test results ?	Ques
1.7.5	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	CPU speed seems normal in BIOS Windows performance shows a CPU score of 7.0 It performs great other a few , very demanding games .	St
1.8.2	i 'll try different benchmarks	St
