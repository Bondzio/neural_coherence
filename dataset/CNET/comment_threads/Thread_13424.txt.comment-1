I have a Maxtor One Touch 500g external hard drive.
I'm running Windows XP with Norton 360 utilities.
Well, Norton said I need to defragment my hard drives to optimize the performance.
So I did.
It took a long time to do it and now when I try to access the files on my external it says they are corrupted and unreadable.
I keep my pictures and music on there from Itunes and CD's so I don't take up space on my internal.
I'm a little frustated, but is there anyway to get my stuff back or do I just need to start over by reformatting the drive back to original.
And if I am able to salvage the drive should I just not defragment it again?
Thanks in advance for any help.
