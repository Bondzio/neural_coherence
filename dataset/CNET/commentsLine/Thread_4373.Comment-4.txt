hi denille, i'm in a very similar position to you, with a similar spec pc that i built about 3 years ago.
i'd like to upgrade the processor, possibly to a dual core proc, and i'd like to boost my ram from 1gb to 2gb.
the thing that's holding me back is replacing the motherboard.
my original motherboard blew a year ago, and when windows booted on the new motherboard it didn' recognise any of the hardware and needed to be re-installed.
(i then formatted the wrong hard drive -- my data hd instead of my os hd, but that's another story!)
re-installing windows and all my apps is such a pain that it's putting me off.
tom's hardware guide has an impressive cpu overview, here:  good luck, neil
