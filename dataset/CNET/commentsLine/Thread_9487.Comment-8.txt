in my primary machine, i have a 1tb drive and a 4tb drive mounted internally.
externally, i have a 2 tb, a 3 tb, and a 4tb attached.
although they are not terabyte drives, i also have a 750 gb drive and a 640 gb drive mounted in the hp plug-and-play drive bays.
why?
i use windows media center a lot (i record an average of 4 movies a day) and i need the space.
i also use the external 4tb drive as a backup device.
