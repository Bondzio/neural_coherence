Hey stevel2000.
The PCI bus is separate from the AGP bus.
AGP has it's own bus dedicated soley to the video card plugged into it (and it's much faster than the PCI bus, despite the usual 3 or 4 PCI slots which all share the same PCI bus).
So yes, your sound card and SATA card would be sharing the same bus.
It's unfortunate that the moderator chose to, in this case, be a pretentious, unhelpful jerk.
Don't offer a coure in PC architecture?
Let's stop being condescending for a second and just say that you don't know.
