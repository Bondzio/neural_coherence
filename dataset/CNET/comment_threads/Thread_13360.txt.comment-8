Sorry, what I mean is, can a failing PSU cause incorrect POST beeps?
Failing as in, providing voltage outside normal ranges?
Not necessarily totally dead.
If a PSU can't properly power a motherboard, then I have no reason to believe the memory is bad.
Unless someone with experience can offer more details.
The source, in my opinion, starts with a good power supply.
