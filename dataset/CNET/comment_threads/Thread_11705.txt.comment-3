To keep it simple, a Sempron is a 32bit Athlon processor with a new lable on it, still a good processor.
A year ago a 3000+ Athlon would have been consirded a FAST gaming system.
It will do a good job on games.
Yes a AMD64 is a faster processor and the way things are going.
If you can return the Sempron and get the AMD64 I would do it.
The last computer I owned had a 386SX chip and I remember that I should have gotten a true 386 chip.
You haven't had one since??
