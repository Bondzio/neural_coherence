Here is the criteria that it must meet for my needs. Needs to be double layer for more space on cds, needs to be external either usb2.0 or firewire because my dell has no more internal bays. Honestly I really do like the best thing out and dont mind paying a good price for good technology. I really appreciate your alls help and any advice you can give me thanks.

On opening my COMPAQ PC, I was daunted at the possibility of breaking the plastic shielding, in removing the CD Drive, which I intended to replace with the DVD Burner, giving me two DVD Drives. I chickened out and purchased an external drive conversion kit, with cooling fan. I am very pleased with the operation of this drive and the AHEAD software.(NERO) In the U.K. the LG External DVD Drive is very highly rated and is excellent value for money. USB connection is via Belkin. Gordon WILEMAN(N.Ireland)

I have a Sony Dual layer drive in a external USB-2 case (externally powered which I recommend over USB powered). Total cost less than a hundred bucks. Data is data as far as the quality of the finished product is concerned.
