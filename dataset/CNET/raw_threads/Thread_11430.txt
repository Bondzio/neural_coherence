My mac is great for what it does so I wouldn't need a extremely fast PC for those purposes but I don't know what kind of machine I would need to learn the Development part. Money is tight so I am thinking about building my own, so what kind of set up should I be looking for in a PC for web developing? Thanks!

6577	2	93776	1061069	1060964	John Robie	3/21/05 1:05 PM	1.1114103E12	Err.........	Thank one, but I have no experience in Graphics Designs or Web Development. Edward O'Daniel has a handle on it here: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=91859&messageID=1037441 Nvidia also has some good info for developers: http://developer.nvidia.com/page/home.html

One of my clients is an elite-level software developer (PhD in Comp Sci, master of more languages/architectures than I can remember, etc.), and I'm sure he can tell you exactly what you need for web development. I'm also surrounded by photographers, illustrators, graphic artists, animators, mega geeks (people who think &quot;cluster computing&quot; is a basic requirement for a decent home network), and modders who build combination PC/goldfish ponds! How did these people get into my life...and who left the friggin' door open! And if you could: 1. Make a shopping list of all the things you'd like to do in terms of &quot;Web Development&quot;. (Microsoft .NET, C#, etc.) 2. Include all the design software you plan to use. (Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, Houdini, etc.) (BTW, John Robie can help you a lot in selecting the best video cards, etc...as can Ozos...and the gaming stuff usually surpasses the requirements of most design software. I'll also check with my friends to be sure.) 3. List everything in order of importance--with things you'd be willing to drop closer to the bottom of the list, and must-haves near the top. 4. You've said that money is tight, but a &quot;ballpark&quot; budget would be very helpful. Once I have your technical and budgetary requirements, I'll ask the Prof. and the others to put their heads together and come up with some recommmendations. The way I see it, it should be fun!

You know your gaming stuff, and you're also the best &quot;over-all&quot; guy I've seen on these forums. And if anyone needs to know where to get the best price for a rig...
6577	5	93776	1063855	1061870	mthomp2	3/22/05 3:29 PM	1.11150534E12	More Info	Thanks one and robie for all the info, basically I don't really know what im getting myself into. Im a right brained thinker so coding is not my specialty. I see that most people recommend PHP, MySQL so thats what I was going to try and focus on. My mac handles most of the graphics work so I mainly need the PC for the Database/Programming work. Now for the part that you have been waiting for, and this will make you laugh. I might be totally out of my mind but I really don't want to spend more than like $500........errr................ok, done laughing? Probably not.....................ok, you should be good now, if not you are hurting my feelings Anyways, I have the means to spend up to around $1000 but I really just want something SIMPLE but adequate for learning this software but also with the capability to expand in the future once I make some more cash from what I learn. I am aware the Macs can do PHP and MySQL but it sounds more difficult to deal with rather than just having a PC. I think maybe the only other thing I would have on there to run is Dreamweaver to do the web integration but thats about it. I would keep photoshop and all my animation programs on my mac. I hope this helps! You guys are great! Matt

The Prof sometimes scribbles code on napkins at Starbucks (on the days when he doesn't feel like carrying his laptop around), so I wouldn't worry too much! BTW, his laptop is a Dell. Are you happy now, John? (*John and I have this thing about Dell--he says they're great, and I say they're crap!)
6577	7	93776	1064608	1064568	culture_of_one	3/22/05 10:54 PM	1.11153204E12	Update	I've sent an email to the Prof and one to the Geek. The Prof is a busy man and the Geek is an inconsiderate @#$% (who, fortunately for you, owes me a ton of favors), so it might take a couple of days to get their replies. I'll keep you posted!
6577	8	93776	1064650	1064568	John Robie	3/22/05 11:30 PM	1.1115342E12	Dear One	I don't recall ever saying Dell machines are great or crap. There are quite a few in Dell's line up that I would never want to own and don't or would not suggest/recommend. I have 3 desktops that are not Dell, and will have Monarch build (assemble complete) my next computer when that time comes as they have a large quality selection, and can built what I want for the same amount of $'s that I would spend, without me having to put up with assembly & startup problems. I have several times suggested Dell over another brand of computer because of a Dell particular price and components at the time as a better bang for the $ on a specific comparable desktop. I have also suggested Emachine and had good words for other brands.:-) Regards,

6577	10	93776	1064687	1064666	John Robie	3/23/05 12:15 AM	1.1115369E12	Keepin in touch....:-)	NIL

(I've asked around, and the Prof's apparently an &quot;expert&quot; in Dreamweaver as well...surprise, surprise...) Here's what Professor Alex Bushnyy wrote: Hey John! The PHP and MySQL are very small. You don't need a powerfull PC. My laptop is too powerfull for that. You can run them on any PC or laptop. Even for a bigger application like Dreamweaver you don't need a big PC. But you are right - it makes sense to have a good video card/graphic accelerator. Your friend, Alex (It's nice to have friends like this guy!)

6577	14	93776	1069318	1068125	mthomp2	3/24/05 9:31 PM	1.11169986E12	Can't Thank you guys enough!	Hey guys, thanks a million for all your help and your research! Sounds like the professor knows his stuff. Now you are making me think about possibly going for a laptop. I don't really want to take up more space in my apartment and I don't have a laptop which would be a nice toy as well Not to drag this discussion along any longer but do you guys have any suggestions for a good sub $1000 laptop? I know this is the wrong board so ill probably skip on over there, but you guys have been so good and helpful I might as well ask the pro's here. Thanks a million! Matt
6577	15	93776	1069469	1069318	culture_of_one	3/24/05 11:31 PM	1.11170706E12	You should...	start a new thread for &quot;who makes the best laptops in the $1000 range&quot; or something like that. We'll see you there! BTW, If you run into any &quot;major&quot; snags (i.e. seemingly unsolvable problems) after you start your new life as a developer, I'd be happy to ask the Prof for advice on your behalf. He's very quick to share...and he cuts through code like a Raptor breaking a fast!

At the office we spent 720 and 829 plus 19 bucks shipping for 2 Athlon 64 R3000 refurb laptops from compgeeks.com They have 512M RAM, 60GB HD, Wifi, Bluetooth, USB 2.0, Firewire, DVD/CDRW, SVideo out, memory card reader and get from 2 to 4 hours on the battery depending on what you do. One unit has the 1024x768 standard screen, the other widescreen. One has the floppy (we never use that). Full restore CDs are included. There are a bazillion sub K laptops if you consider factory refurbs. Bob
6577	17	93776	1070631	1069932	mthomp2	3/25/05 8:56 AM	1.11174096E12	Sub 1k	Wow, that is a really great deal, who is the maker of the laptops and have you had good luck with them, im sure factory refurbished is good, but my parents got a dell refurb and its been nothing but trouble, so im a little hesitant. I am sure it was just luck of the draw but still a little weary. Thanks! Matt
6577	18	93776	1071316	1070631	R. Proffitt	3/25/05 12:42 PM	1.11175452E12	They are Compaqs.	The neat part is that the seals and boxes are from HP. HP did the refurb and not some fly-by-night outfit. Bob
