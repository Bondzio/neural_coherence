i have a laptop that i would like to connect to my di-524... it gets connection and it says excellent, but its not recieving or sending any packets.
ive noticed that under address type, it says manually configured, and i dont think its supposed to say that.
from what i know, it should say assigned by dhcp.
can someone help me fix this problem?
thx also, i have 2 other computers connected to it, so i dont think anythings wrong with the router.
