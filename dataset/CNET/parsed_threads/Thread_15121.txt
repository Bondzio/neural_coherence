<s> Basics of home network: FIOS with Vista desktop connected to router via ethernet cable,xp laptop and Lexmark S605 printer communicate wirelessly with router.Everything worked flawlessly until last weekend. </s>
<s> The old Dlink G router died on Sunday after 5yrs so I ran to Staples and bought a Cisco/Linksys E1000 'N' router.I got everything back up and running with no problems.To rejoin the S605 to the network,I went into it's wireless network settings and entered the router's ssid and p/word.I printed from both the desktop and laptop,everything worked and the network was happy! </s>
<s> Fast forward one week:I'm on the verge of taking my Mossberg 500 and using the printer for target practice. </s>
<s> Printing from either desktop/laptop gives communication errors(neither one sees the printer over the network).I can use the printer only if I connect it to the desktop via usb. </s>
<s> Things tried: Reset printer to factory defaults. </s>
<s> Delete all traces of anything Lexmark and reinstall software on both computers. </s>
<s> Result:the printer can see the router and I can add it to the network through the printer's settings but neither computer can see the printer? </s>
<s> I realize I have to create a new printer port on the desktop but I can't,entering the printer's ip addy get's 0 results. </s>
<s> The N router had to be set to 802.11 G mode and all the usual ports and firewalls tinkered with. </s>
<s> I think the Mossberg is the better idea. </s>

<s> You gave me a place to start checking for the problem,Thx. </s>
<s> The S605 is a 'N' device,I checked the router's basic wireless settings and it was set to 'mixed' which includes B/G/N so that was left as is. </s>
<s> Directly above that was 'configuration view'.WIFI protected was selected with manual being the other choice.I selected manual,saved the changes and behold! </s>
<s> The printer was no longer invisible and I was able to create a new port. </s>
<s> Didn't play on mixed mode. </s>
<s> The printer only showed up in 802.11g mode at the router. </s>
<s> Truly a Mossberg 930 target. </s>
<s> The software was no better. </s>
<s> So even after getting it to work, HP's support was not there so back to USB connections for quite a long time. </s>
<s> The printer is now history and I went to another make for awhile. </s>
