I hear you Bob, but my point was that it is a stable and usable system on a Windows 7 machine.
The bugs only occurred when I upgraded the tablet to Windows 8 Pro, and as I recall, the upgrade assistant and the Intel website noted that there were issues using the platform on Windows 8 at the time.
So it was my decision.
I like Windows 8 so I was willing to put up with the buggy WiDi driver in hopes that it gets resolved soon.
Someone who bought the same machine and kept Windows 7 on it, is likely not to have my issues, as I never did when I had solely the Windows 7 Professional installed.
