i cant do it.
info: my laptop has a wireless network connection dell wireless wlan 1350 wlan mini-pci card.
it also has a local area connection broadcom 440x 10/100 which is currently disconnected.
my desktop has a 1394 net adaptor and also a local area connection 2 3com gigabit nic it is also connected to a linksy router by an ethernet cable which in turn is connected to a dsl modem, also by an ethernet cable.
now, i have no trouble accessing the internet, but everytime i try to run the &quot;set-up network wizard&quot; it stops in middle and tells me something is wrong and it wont say what.
furthermore, i created a shared files folder on my laptop, which appeared in the network places folder on my desktop, but wouldn't let me access it, saying that it didn't really exist.
any ideas?
