1.1.1	I have in my mind that the better way to backup photos would be to put them on an external hard drive.	St
1.1.2	(I am forever hunting for the correct CD or DVD) They would be easy to get to from other computers to edit or to store from a laptop on a trip.I think I would only use it to store photos so I hope it would last many years or am I expecting too much?	St
1.2.1	Just as dependable as internals.	St
1.2.2	And just as internals, you still need to back them up since a virus or failure will cause the files to vanish.	St

1.4.1	Thanks Robert If I decide to try it, I will definately keep DVD backups	St
1.5.1	I put an 80 gig WD HD in a cheap plastic enclosure case, and it's been running fine for months- I've even forgotten to turn it off, and luckily didn't toast it.	St
1.5.2	But, as Bob said, it's TEMPORARY STORAGE.	St
1.5.3	It's convenient to carry about, works really fast on my usb 2 connection, and my network sees it.	St
1.5.4	All fine and good.	St
1.5.5	BUT- I've still archived everything important to cd/dvd disks.	St
1.5.6	Disaster strikes just when you least expect it....which reminds me, I haven't backed up some important stuff in awhile....thanks for reminder, Bob!	St
