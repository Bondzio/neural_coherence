i was wondering about this.
i tried to install xp after formatting the drive (via xp cd) and...low and behold...all of the old user files were still there.
what i am used to.... with the ox install cd you have the option for 3 levels of erasing: quick, zero, zero then write random.
i assumed this was standard.
