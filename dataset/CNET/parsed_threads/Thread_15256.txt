<s> I was meaning to use this just as a way to restore Windows, as I already have a valid Microsoft license for the computer, but had no way to re-format the machine. </s>
<s> I can see though that some people would use this for illegal purposes, however, as doing the mod would allow the disks to work on any machine, and therefore use the same Product Keys. </s>
