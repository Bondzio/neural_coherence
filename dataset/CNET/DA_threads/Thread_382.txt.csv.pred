1.1.1	Does anyone have any information on an affordable, reasonably sized (64gb & up) solid state drive?	St
1.2.1	I am guessing you are deluged with information.	St
1.2.2	Maybe you are shopping for price and didn't say?	St
1.2.3	(and what country, etc.)	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Country is US and I'm looking for something in the sub-$200 area.	St
1.3.2	Yet, I'd probably just be using it as a hot-swap device on top of a desktop.	St
1.3.3	It would be nice to be of considerable size so that I could store my OS on it along with other items.	St
1.3.4	I could even go as low as 32gb possibly.	St
1.3.5	I just want something from a reliable company, but I also know that patience is a virtue with internal and external storage.	St
1.4.1	Let's pick any drive maker and even though they are a reliable company and made millions of drives, that doesn't make the drives any more reliable.	St
1.4.2	Let's read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive#Quality_and_performance That should help.	Sug
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Pricing is a main factor in any SSD purchase, so don't expect a bargain soon.	St
1.5.2	In fact if you do, seriously reconsider the vendor.	St
1.5.3	A SSD will be fast, but some have proven not to last as long or be as problem free.	St
1.5.4	Many operate well, however when they do have a problem, they just up and die, no clue beforehand, via my experience.	St
1.5.5	So, pick a vendor or maker with a good warranty.	St
1.5.6	I have pointed to and many of the bigger vendors offer them: http://www.crucial.com http://www.kingston.com Beware of the several classes that refer to speed, size and/or data transfer rating, etc.. tada -----Willy	St
