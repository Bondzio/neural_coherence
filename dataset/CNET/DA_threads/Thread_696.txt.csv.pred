1.1.1	So the deal is that I recently bought a NAS device for our office network , which is a simple Windows configuration ( not running Windows Server 2003 , no domains or anything ) .	St
1.1.2	As such , nobody logs into the network .	St
1.1.3	Each workstation is simply assigned to a Windows network group .	St
1.1.4	I have the NAS ( a Western Digital MyBook World Edition II 1TB ) connected via Ethernet to our Cisco Catalyst 2950 router and mapped it on all the workstations without any problems .	St
1.1.5	Everything is almost perfectly .	St
1.1.6	Each of the workstations are connected on the network via the Cisco router and each workstation is operating on Windows XP for what it is worth .	St
1.1.7	The drive , by the way , comes with a Shared Storage Manager tool that allows me to create CIF shares and assign rights ( non , read only , or full ) to network users .	St
1.1.8	The problem I 'm having is that the shared rights are n't working properly .	St
1.1.9	I set the minimum permissions to a share as read only , for example , and everyone can read from that share just fine .	St
1.1.10	If I assign Full rights ( read and write ) to specific users for a particular share , they are still unable to write ( only can read ) .	St
1.1.11	So that is my stumbling block .	St
1.1.12	Among the 20 users , I want only three people to be able to write to a particular share and the read to be read only .	St
1.1.13	Any thoughts on where to begin diagnosing my problem and solve it ?	Ques
1.1.14	Can I eliminate the use of Western Digital 's Shared Storage Manager and control rights levels to the shares via Windows networking and , if so , how I would do that ?	Ques
1.1.15	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	http : //wdc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wdc.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php ? p_faqid=1495 & p_created=1168641440 & p_sid=bLTfVJLi & p_accessibility=0 & p_redirect= & p_lva= & p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9NSw1JnBfcHJvZHM Most of us returned that unit since it 's busted .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob , back in May of '07 I bought one of these units for use at home and I have not had a single problem with it .	St
1.3.2	Based on that experience , I thought it would be a good addition for network storage in our small business environment .	St
1.3.3	This , by the way , is our first foray into NAS .	St
1.4.1	I call this one busted .	St
1.4.2	The software they supplied is too far out of touch with today 's owners .	St
1.4.3	It 's also buggy .	St
1.4.4	If you ca n't use it , return it .	St
1.5.1	I 'd be interested in what you mean by & quot ; out of touch with today 's owners & quot ; , since I am relatively new to this part of networking .	St
1.5.2	The good news is that yesterday , after refining the way I assigning the share rights , I have everything working the way I need it to for our purposes .	St
1.5.3	Users who need the ability to read/write to specified shares are able to do so , while those that should be read only have just that .	St
1.5.4	In the process I think that I did discover on of the Shared Storage Manager 's quirks .	St
1.5.5	It provides a condition for establishing minimum rights for all users to a given share as none , read only , or full .	St
1.5.6	I took it to mean that I could set the minimum right to read only across the board and override it with full rights where applicable .	St
1.5.7	That did not provide the desired results .	St
1.5.8	However , when I set the minimum rights to non , then specified each user as either read only or full as needed then I did achieve the desired results .	St
1.5.9	The kicker is that the Windows dialogue box for user name/password pops up for each user when they try to access the share .	St
1.5.10	Somewhat inconvenient , but the users and I can live with that .	St
1.5.11	Another bug I discovered is that if you create a user name more than once , but with different casing ( all upper for one , mixed U/L for another ) the software sees both instances as a single user in the User Management .	St
1.5.12	However , when looking at the individual shares it then sees both user names with the casing differentiation .	St
1.5.13	It was somewhat tricky to then remove one of the duplicate entries .	St
1.5.14	The duplicate entries were , however , confusing the network and one of them did have to be removed .	St
1.5.15	As an aside , the day I posted the original questions here I also submitted the same question to Western Digital support .	St
1.5.16	As of today , two days later , all I have received is the automated response stating that follow up should occur within 24 hours , but could take as long as three days .	St
1.6.1	There 's a long list of files it forbids .	St
1.6.2	A very strange device .	St
1.7.1	As I think I mentioned earlier on , I also have one of these devices at home .	St
1.7.2	I 'm able to stream MP3 's and video over my wireless network at home without any problem ( the drive being connected to my wireless router ) .	St
1.7.3	If you 're referring to streaming MP3 's or other files remotely over the internet without having a full and paid Mionet subscription I think that is another story .	St
1.7.4	I will agree that the device has some very odd tendencies .	St
1.7.5	One of those being the inability to access folders I created in the root directory via Windows ( so they are non CIF shares ) when I had Mionet installed .	St
1.7.6	I discovered I do n't have much use for remote access , so I then uninstalled Mionet but could no longer access those folders or the root directory itself .	St
1.7.7	I had to reinstall Mionet , drag those folders to the public directory , and then uninstall Mionoet again .	St
1.7.8	Now , however , I can read those folders but can not delete them or their contents and still do n't have access to the root directory .	St
1.7.9	Talk about a quirk .	St
1.7.10	Having learned some of the things I know now I would n't recommend it and would have looked to other alternatives , but again you can chalk this up to my learning curve on NAS .	St
1.7.11	Appreciate the discussion , btw .	St
