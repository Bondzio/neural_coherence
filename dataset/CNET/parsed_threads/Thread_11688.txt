<s> I could not turn my notebook on, so I called the tech guy on my warranty. </s>
<s> He tried to resuscitate it and told me to pull out my card bus adaptor. </s>
<s> When I pulled it out it was bent and it wrecked the cardbus slot. </s>
<s> I sent it in to repair and they returned it (service denied)..when it came back it would power on ..before I sent it in it would not power on. </s>
<s> But now it does not recognize the cd rom..I give up on the warranty people..How do I know if my cdrom can be replaced or this is a motherboard issue? </s>
<s> up toooo easily. </s>
<s> YOur first mistake was to follow this so-called tech's advice and pulling your own card bus adapter. </s>
<s> Unless you put it in. </s>
<s> Without knowing more, any guesses here are just that...educated guesses. </s>
<s> Take it to a reputable tech and pay for the bench test. </s>
<s> Then you have to decide how important that laptop really is. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
