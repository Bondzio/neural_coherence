<s> Not sure what causes this. </s>
<s> I have an abit nf7s2.0 mb, 512mb 2 hard drives, xp 2500 processor. </s>
<s> 350W antec psu. </s>
<s> A couple weeks ago, the computer started making weird noises, like clunking sounds, after it shut down windows xp. </s>
<s> I haven't made any hardware changes, no lightning storms recently or any real obvious changes to the machine. </s>
<s> Its worked fine the past 3 years. </s>
<s> I was thinking it's the psu, but all the voltages look acceptable when checking the bios. </s>
<s> Boots ok, will go to s1 standby ok and wake up, checked the smart on the drives, they both passed. </s>
<s> looked at the mb no leaking caps. </s>
<s> All the connections seem ok. </s>
<s> The thing behaves as if power was bleeding off the psu to the mb and &quot;pulsing&quot; the drives and the fans until it bleeds down low enough to stop (the hd lights continue to flicker and i get a faint &quot;clicking&quot; on the pc speakers.) </s>
<s> Any suggestions on where to start troubleshooting? </s>
<s> I don't want to fry something unnecessarily! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Get your flashlight and start here.... http://www.badcaps.net/ VAPCMD </s>
<s> The system when shutting down does &quot;house keeping&quot; chores in order to better keep track and *cleanly* shutdown pgms.. </s>
<s> If you never did use any pgms. </s>
<s> that in general do all this while system is in use or you manually, then expect a longer shutdown even if no logo is shown. </s>
<s> This does however exclude any possible h/w fault. </s>
<s> If the HD itself is starting to falter it maybe in early stages and recovering from soft errors but finally gets the shutdown done. </s>
<s> The fan simply is running because power is still present and cooling is required. </s>
<s> In 3yrs. </s>
<s> if you hadn't already clean the system of dust bunnies. </s>
<s> Use the HD makers own diags. </s>
<s> to test it, get at support website for your model HD. </s>
<s> As for standby and hiberation modes you may want to disable so no XP setting effect that at least during your testing. </s>
<s> The sounds, just follow your ear, maybe a fan is getting flaky or starting to fail. </s>
<s> As always, do a back-up while you can or at least for important data. </s>
<s> Again, 3yrs. </s>
<s> is a wear%tear period when something may falter, so leave open case and see if heat is an issue too and problems seems to go away during that time. </s>
<s> Look into that... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks, Definitely not housekeeping, its easy to tell when its doing that, and this is not shutdown program cleanup stuff. </s>
<s> When you flip the switch off and then on on the psu, it runs the fans/drives for like 30 sec!! </s>
<s> When I first built the thing, it would kick the fans for about 1/2 second, 30 seconds is not normal. </s>
<s> Now, the mobo leds blink, the lan lights blink, everything looks like its getting repeated momentary power. </s>
<s> I looked at the caps, they all look ok. no bulging or tilting or leaking, even on the video card, modem (yup, good for faxing). </s>
<s> When the computer is shut down, it just pulses power. </s>
<s> I started disconnecting power to each hard drive and turned the hard switch on the back on to see if it bled/pulsed power. </s>
<s> Then the dvd drives, then the floppy, then pulled the graphics card then the modem and then the case fan. </s>
<s> All that was left was a psu, mobo, and processor. </s>
<s> powered up and the led's on the board flickered and the fan on the processor/psu spun and slowly (60 seconds) came to a stop. </s>
<s> I pulled the power connections off the mobo (figured I've been beating the crap out of it enough) and flipped the psu on. </s>
<s> The fans spun and slowly came to a stop (60 to 90 sec). </s>
<s> Hmm, bad psu? </s>
<s> I checked the 12v going to the board with an auto circuit tester (just a 12 v lamp and a couple of probes. </s>
<s> The power going to the board would flicker about 2-3 times/second!! </s>
<s> Guess its a bad psu. </s>
<s> Anyone ever have one die like this? </s>
<s> Works fine as long as its NOT shut off??!!?? </s>
<s> Anyways, going to get a new one and start there. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time </s>
<s> The ATX type psu is a &quot;logical&quot; power circuit loop. </s>
<s> That simply means there's no direct on/off to direct power as would have been for older AT type psus. </s>
<s> Swapping the psu is the next step but beware that a 2nd half of the problem maybe the mtrbd. </s>
<s> as well. </s>
<s> The start ckt. </s>
<s> for on/off cycle may have been damaged for whatever reason. </s>
<s> I would however, reseat the actual on/off harness for the frt. </s>
<s> panel. </s>
<s> I have found bad frt. </s>
<s> panel on/off sw.(rare it seems) that have weaken contacts and/or broken int. </s>
<s> contacts. </s>
<s> Remove the harness to on/off pins at mtrbd. </s>
<s> and see if problem changes. </s>
<s> Only a monetary contact with same pins provide the initial on/off start/shutdown. </s>
<s> Look around closely the immediate area of the pins the componets for obvious damage that suggest the start ckt.. Last, in your bios, if applicable there maybe a &quot;time frame&quot; of on/off action, most default to 5-6sec. </s>
<s> but can be longer(verify it), changed somehow? </s>
<s> I hope this helps. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Yeah, I pulled the pins for the front panel switch, flipped the ps on and had same behavior. </s>
<s> There's nothing around the pins to suggest damage. </s>
<s> Its a normally open contact i imagine, so if it was that switch getting &quot;stuck&quot; on, it should have behaved properly. </s>
<s> I still think the PS ate itself </s>
<s> Well, I replaced the PSU (a lot more involved than just 4 screws and some cables) and that seems to have done the trick. </s>
<s> I guess the on/off logic on the old one went kaput after 3.5 yrs of service. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help though. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I've had the same problem happen to me, but the pulsing lasts much longer, (generally would pulse all day and all night after shutdown if I didn't shut off the PS's power switch.) </s>
<s> I too had not changed the PC's configuration and checked to see if a cap had blown or if something else was amiss with the MoBo. </s>
<s> I found nothing. </s>
<s> I have an AMD 3200+ w/ a Soltek MoBo, 2GB of memory, two WD IDE HDs, NEC DVD/RW drive, ATI AGP graphics card, Soundblaster live PCI card and a USRobotics 56k modem card. </s>
<s> It has held it's own for several years now without an issue, until a month and a half ago when the pulsing started. </s>
<s> All diagnostics show there is no problem with the CPU or it's components. </s>
<s> The one thing you and I have in common is an Antec 350W PS (model:SL350S) which came standard with my Antec Solution Series SLK3700-BQE case. </s>
<s> After reading this thread, I'm going to follow through with my initial thought and replace the Power Supply and see if that fixes the problem. </s>
<s> I hope you have continued success after replacing your Antec 350W power supply which solved your problem. </s>
