i have an hp with an integrated graphic card.
it was slow and used system memory.
i plugged in a new graphic card, and got much cleaner images, faster rebuilds, etc.
but...you can't depend on the device manager to keep the old integrated card disabled, and you can't trust a machine whose nature has been preset to work with an integrated card.
you upgrade this, change that, load a new game, etc.
preferences get changed automatically...and the old graphic card is activitated, stealing memory, slowing things down, etc., or the machine out of habit supports the old card as well as the new.
if you know you're going to run a faster separate card eventually, get a machine running a separate card already.
it'll be in its nature, and you may avoid the lovely conflicts that arise among plug-in cards.
