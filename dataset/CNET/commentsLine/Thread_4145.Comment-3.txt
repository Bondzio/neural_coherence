i have tried different components for everything except the dsl modem and since it is the the only common component in my internet connection, i suspect it the most.
i like your suggestion about trying parts elsewhere.
it seems that there are a lot of people that have signals drop out, routers/nics/modems fail, & isps with shaky service.
i think that this time we live in with computers is similar to the 1920s for automobiles.
they worked but needed attention too frequently to keep them going.
thanks!
