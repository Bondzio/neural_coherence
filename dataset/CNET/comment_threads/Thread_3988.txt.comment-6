na, there is no lag whatsoever.
I just started learning how to build a computer and later on I'm hoping to spend around 3 grand to build one, but I researched around and the highest gaming machine will cost around 6-7 grand, which is why I think the XPS 710 H2C is a good deal since they overclock it and what not.
