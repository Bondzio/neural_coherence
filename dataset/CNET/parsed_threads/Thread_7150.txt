<s> I have fixed the network problems from my previous post, but am still unable to get printer shareing to work Network is 2 pc's, pc1 with xphome and hpdeskjet720c printer. </s>
<s> pc2 has win 98se. </s>
<s> Network is functional, internet connection sharing works, I can access the shared folders on pc1 from pc2. </s>
<s> printer is designated as shared, icon on pc1 has the little hand under it, but you can't see the printer from pc2. </s>
<s> What could i have forgotten ? </s>
<s> Do you have both the file and print sharing boxes checked? </s>
<s> How about firewalls. </s>
<s> The XP firewall needs to have file and print sharing checked as an exception in its settings. </s>
