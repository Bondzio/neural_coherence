<s> XP Pro and IE 7 My dear old mom (87) has terrible tremors and has a very difficult time lining up the cursor to click a link etc. </s>
<s> She exchanges emails with friends and family daily. </s>
<s> I know how to slow the mouse down, but that isn't really the problem. </s>
<s> Her hand jerks around so much that hard to line up at any speed. </s>
<s> I'm thinking maybe a sandbag on her wrist. </s>
<s> Anyways, PC mag Feb edition lists Logitech Nulooq as one of 20 best innovations. </s>
<s> It's I think 1 lb hockey puck-size device made to use with a mouse. </s>
<s> Has anyone tried one of these? </s>
<s> I'm thinking the weight of the device would be helpful. </s>
<s> Can it open emails etc? </s>
<s> Hope that I've made myself clear for a change. </s>
<s> Any any other suggestions very welcome. </s>
<s> Might not even have to use a mouse. </s>
<s> where you can record the mouse movements it takes to say &quot;make an email&quot; and then save it to a single icon. </s>
<s> Then she only has to double click one icon to execute a series of mouse movements thats automated. </s>
<s> william551, No actually. </s>
<s> She has problems speaking coherently too and sometimes can hardly speak at all. </s>
<s> She is a cancer surviver of 13 years now and the radiation treatments that saved her life have given her these afflictions. </s>
<s> A small price to pay and she is extremely healthy and active both mentally and physically otherwise. </s>
<s> Just goes to show that one can't give too much info when asking a question. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> william551, I'll think about that a bit. </s>
<s> Her problem is hitting even a desktop shortcut icon the first time. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> maybe setting them off aside from the others and spaced further apart. </s>
<s> I know you can go into desktop settings and change the icon spacing width and height. </s>
<s> Maybe 80 or 100 is a good setting in &quot;appearance&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot;. </s>
<s> And then scroll down to icon spacing. </s>
<s> william551, That's a great start and something I will do. </s>
<s> She has dial-up. </s>
<s> Turn on the computer, click the Outlook Express icon that activates her dial-up and opens OE. </s>
<s> Inbox set up with separate folders such as family, friends etc. </s>
<s> No auto preview pane. </s>
<s> The toolbar buttons can be a problem too. </s>
<s> She all too often hits Delete instead of Send/Recv after one finger typing out a reply. </s>
<s> Simple things like highlighting a line of text to copy and paste are almost impossible. </s>
<s> Trying to give you all a picture of what she has to go though to read & send email etc. </s>
<s> I need to think about that voice recognition some more too. </s>
<s> Back in the late 90s I had AOL and there was a version that had what I think was called &quot;AOL Speaks&quot;. </s>
<s> It was laughingly hopeless and I think the next version did not include it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies! </s>
<s> I guess that I might have to purchase one of those Logitech Nulooq to see how it works, but will wait a couple of days to see if anyone here is familiar with it first. </s>
<s> I hope that you live close by. </s>
<s> The first thing that I might try is using some of the accessibility controls that have been designed for disadvantaged windows users. </s>
<s> She will still have to be somewhat careful, but judicious use might make her more confident. </s>
<s> Hi, We've been through the Windows accessibility settings and they aren't good enough. </s>
<s> We live 500 miles apart. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply! </s>
<s> I'm going to try next a graphics forum for Logitech Nulooq info and then try to find a forum that would know more about speech recognition programs that william551 suggested. </s>
<s> Thanks all! </s>
