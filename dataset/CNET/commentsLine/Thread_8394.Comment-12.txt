i have never seen anywhere where the power supply fan is considered part of the total cooling picture, but it is.
that fan pulls air out of the top of the case.
case fans often are installed to both pull and push.
when you think about it, blowing air into the case assists the power supply fan by pressurizing the case.
fans which blow out of the case work against the power supply fan by de-pressurizing the case, and if they are controlled by mb temp, they probably come on when the ps starts needing extra cooling because everything is working harder.
so it makes sense to arrange the fans to blow outside air into the case (it'll be cooler than the air in the case) at all times.
most cases are nowhere near airtight anyway, so a lot of air will be simply vented as well.
as for hot air rises, it does in still air, but it takes very little breeze to de-stratify warm/cool air, so as long as fans are running, forget about convective cooling.
i have 2 case fans, both mb controlled, one is relocated on the side panel to blow on the video card when it's working hard and the other is on the back panel and blows toward the cpu.
even when they are not running, the ps fan is pulling air through the fan openings to where it is needed.
use your own head and think things through.
