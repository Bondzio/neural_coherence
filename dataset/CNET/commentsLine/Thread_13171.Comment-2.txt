before you do that, shut down the laptop and remove the ac power cord.
with the cd slot facing down, shake the laptop and see if you can coax the disk into appearing enough for you to grab it with a pair of tweezers.
i would not recommend attempting to take this thing apart to get at the optical drive.
a quick glance at the instructions that came with your laptop would have told you that only regular sized cd/dvd disks can go into a slot loading optical drive.
