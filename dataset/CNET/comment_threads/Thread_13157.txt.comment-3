I tried to plug everything into a US power strip then I plugged the strip cord into a Radio Shack Converter.
I ended up hearing a buzzing sound through the computer speakers and then heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound before the circuit blew on the wall outlet.
Do you think I damaged the computer?
I fear I may need a new power supply for the computer but how can I tell?
Also, any recommendataions on where to get power cords/step down converters for the desktop in the UK?
Thanks for your help.
