I have set up a dual boot system using XP Pro and Vista Ultra but neither one sees My Raid 1. I thought that I might reformat one of the drives to re-establish the raid 1 then try to mirror the drive with data to the &quot;empty&quot; drive. I don't Know if this will work. I might have to back up all of the data to the &quot;OS&quot; drive then reformat the raid drives and re-establish Raid 1 then transfer my data back again. Sound Scary? You bet!!!!! I was hoping for another answer fronm anybody.
