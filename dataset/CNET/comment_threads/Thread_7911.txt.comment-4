A &quot;legitimate&quot; OS you bought would have an install CD.
You don't have that so what you appear to have is a pre-installed OEM version.
Again this is all setup to make it very hard to impossible to move the OS to another machine because you don't have the install CD.
-&gt; It seems very hard for some to grasp the issue.
The parts are indeed scavenge able but the OS may be a dead item.
Let's see that install CD.
The least expensive version of XP is over at newegg.com.
And if you just need to eek by till next year &quot;Windows 7 RC will expire on June 1, 2010.&quot; So you can use that till then.
