I picked up a Silicon Graphics/Sony 20 inch CRT monitor and have had problems with the monitor resizing my viewable window upon a cold start up and in games. Upon start up (every time) I have to go into control panel and into display to advanced settings and select/switch from screen refresh rate of 75 Hertz to 85 Hertz for the screen to display properly. The next time I restart my system from a cold boot I get the same problem so I go into advanced settings and switch from 85 hertz to 75 hertz... When I play some games I can't see the whole screen as it is too low a resolution and the game screen is too large! I searched the web and I can't get a driver for this monitor as it is 5 years old (or older) and I haven't found a compatible driver from Sony. So I use the recommended windows generic driver. I have the latest driver updates from ATI for the graphics card. I am stumped, is it a video card problem or a hardware problem? It bugs me because I want to play some games and the resizing of the monitor becomes an issue when the screen resolution changes... I hope this makes sense...

I wonder if this is a monitor from the bad old days? If so, you may have to dive in and create your very own MONITOR.INF file. Such is beyond the scope of what support I'll offer here but at least you and google can research how to create a monitor.inf for said monitor that could alleviate the issue. You would also research the use of DXDIAG and the MORE tab, then the OVERRIDE button to lock in directx to that refresh rate. Hope this helps, Bob
