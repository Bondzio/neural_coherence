I have a emachine W2047 6 yrs old, some way my system was hacked.
For two weeks I did everything required to remove virus until it asked for Control F. To reassure security I created a supervisor's and user's password exited and saved.
Now I receieve an invalid password and can't enter back into Advance Bios or reboot my system.
What do I need to do?
