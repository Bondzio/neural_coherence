I can tell you that most of the Hard Drive based cameras work well with iMovie.
Avoid, like the plague, any camera that puts the video directly down onto a DVD.
Because the DVD is the finished thing, it is extremely difficult to edit the footage without having to convert the footage to DV or something similar.
And then, because it is Sunday and I have nothing to do right now, I went in search of a definitive answer for you.
I finally found it in iMovie 11, under Help.
http://help.apple.com/imovie/cameras/en/index.html?lang=en_US Just select the options that you want, remember to avoid DVD based cameras, and hit the Go button.
Voila!
A list of compatible cameras.
