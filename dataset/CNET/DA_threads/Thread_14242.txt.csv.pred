1.1.1	When I boot up , error message & quot ; operating system not found & quot ; , Can this problem be the jumper settings or who has experience with this error ?	Ques
1.2.1	Im sorry , it says & quot ; can not find the operating system & quot ; .	St
1.2.2	I just changed the hard drive , this one is used 10 gig IBM Quantum .	St
1.2.3	Not sure if it has operating system loaded or not but I would guess so .	Res
1.2.4	I want to reformat and tried to put 2000 pro booting from cd and It went through process and in partition it said to quit .	St
1.3.1	If I am getting this right , you have a used 10 gig drive and do not know what it 's contents , if anything , is .	St
1.3.2	You want to install Win2K on it , however .	St
1.3.3	Here is what I would do with such an unknown drive .	St
1.3.4	You said IBM Quantum .	St
1.3.5	Well , Quantum was it 's own company and was acquired by Maxtor .	St
1.3.6	If you can , I would try to find a diagnostic utility from their web site that you allow you to test the drive first .	St
1.3.7	You might even be able to completely erase it .	St
1.3.8	This would be best for a new Win2K installation .	St
1.3.9	If the drive is in good shape , you should be able to attempt an installation of Win2K provided the rest of the PC is capable of running it .	St
1.3.10	This will mean some minimum processor and amount of RAM .	St
1.3.11	Win 2K will want 256 megs or RAM at least but more is better .	St
1.3.12	I 'd suggest a P-3 or better processor as well .	St
1.3.13	You will also need to have other hardware drivers available .	St
1.3.14	Good luck and hope this helps .	Polite
1.4.1	Ok , thankyou , I will try and see what happens .	St
1.4.2	My system is a pentium 3 with 391 ram 933 mhz compaq .	St
1.4.3	Ill let you know if it helps .	St
1.4.4	Thanks again .	St
