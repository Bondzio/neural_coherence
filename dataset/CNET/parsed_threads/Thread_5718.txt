<s> About your USB issue. </s>
<s> The drive is either defective or you have some USB issue that http://www.usbman.com writes about. </s>
<s> I'd be more specific, but details about what chipset your machine uses was not noted. </s>

<s> Bob, a friend's eMachines/Windows XP desktop is exhibiting this same problem. </s>
<s> I'm checking into the chipset and other specs, but it's a new Maxtor 320GB SATA hard drive mounted into an aluminum housing, connected via USB cable. </s>
<s> (The internal hard drive is a single PATA unit, partitioned by eMachines into a C drive [using NTFS] and a D drive [using FAT32].) </s>
<s> There are also a number of other card reader drives, so that we would have expected this external drive to show up as Drive K. The hardware installer recognized it immediately, and it shows up in Device Manager as a USB Mass Storage Device, working properly. </s>
<s> However, it's not present as a separate drive in My Computer, and consequently we can't specify a normal drive path for backups, etc. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I also am having this problem! </s>
<s> I just bought a 50GB Maxtor external hard drive. </s>
<s> Whats with this?... </s>
<s> is it something to do with Maxtor? </s>
