1.1.1	Buying a new Mid-range desktop later this week .	St
1.1.2	Have n't decided on whether to buy one off Gateway 's web site , Velocity Micro 's site , or just go to Best Buy and make the purchase .	St
1.1.3	I chose Gateway and Velocity for there customer service and quality of systems .	St
1.1.4	Most reviews on them seem to be good .	St
1.1.5	I know you can customize if you buy from thier web sites , but that is the only advantage I see so far .	St
1.1.6	Gateway , Velocity , or Best Buy store ?	Ques
1.1.7	Your opinions please .	Sug
1.2.1	After many looksee 's I wonder if they have nothing but older models or units they bought a boatload of .	St
1.2.2	If you go that route , get the make/model and go back home to research that model and see if it 's been superseded or you can beat it by going direct .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	the retail versions of gateways are technically not as good as those offered direct from gateway .	St
1.3.2	the retail pcs use more low-end components ( lower rated power supplies , ddr2-533 vs ddr2-667 ram , i945 instead of i965 chipset , etc . )	St
1.3.3	but the prices of the retail units are hard-to-beat : $ 749 for a core2duo , 2gb ram , and 320gb hd .	St
1.4.1	I ordered one from VM last week after doing much research .	St
1.4.2	I had originally ordered one to be customized from HP .	St
1.4.3	I also ordered a monitor from them .	St
1.4.4	I got the monitor ( actually 2 ) , and since both were defective , I cancelled my order after spending about 4 hours on the phone with their & quot ; tech support & quot ; .	St
1.4.5	ARRGH !	St
1.4.6	I think the deciding factor for buying a VM was this article .	St
1.4.7	I thought it was very helpful : http : //consumer.hardocp.com/article.html ? art=MTIxNSwxLCxoY29uc3VtZXI= Good luck !	St
