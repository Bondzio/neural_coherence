in my experience the thermal tape that comes attached to the cpu heatsink is not good for two reasons.
1. it is inadequate cooling.
2. it sticks the heatsink to the cpu.
my 2nd point was proved once when i sent my computer overseas.
when i examined it upon arrival the heatsink had come loose and was hanging by its power cable.
attached to it was the cpu with some of its pins bent.
in an attempt to rescue the cpu i tried to separate it from the heatsink.
it took around 10 minutes to prise free with a chisel.
when cool heatsink tape is a superglue, not like thermal paste which retains its fluidity.
