My son and I replaced an ASUS motherboard with a Foxconn 761GXK8M8 motherboard with a packaged Athlon 64 CPU. The case is a RAID case with a Raidmax ATX 12V (sn KY-520 ATX). When the computer is powered up we get no fan starts, and no attempt to boot. The power supply was working fine just before we changed the board. The power supply has a 20 pin connector, not a 24 as recommended but the owners manual says that will work if plugged in as directed. I have verified that is correct. The 12 power supply is plugged in correctly as well. I tried jumpering the power on button across the pins on the board as I had seen on other posts with similar problems. No response. The only sign of life was last night when I reset the power strip and the power supply and CPU fans spun up for a quick second and then coasted down. This phenomena happened this AM as well when I plugged in the 20 pin connector. Checking the 20 pin connector with a multimeter, starting from the left facing the clip I got 5VDC on the 2nd and 7th pairs of pins. I get no voltage across the pins on the 4 pin 12VDC connector with the power plugged in and the toggle switch in - (on). Should I have voltage across that with the power supply on but the computer not booted up? Any other ideas on troubleshooting and repair? We have verified the reset switch, HDD LED, and power supply two pin connectors on the front of the board. I appreciate it.

If you learn one thing from this post it's always test the MB with CPU RAM and video BEFORE installing the MB in the case. That said....NO BEEPS ? VAPCMD

Additionally, when the power supply is turned on occasionally the neon light below the power supply (it has those 'gaming' cool internal case lights) will light up and the fans will spin for up to 20 seconds, but with no intervention, the fans stop, the lights go out and that is it.

I just got done pulling it out of the case (including unhooking the tempearure controller/monitor, hard drive, floppy, two CD's etc) and after plugging it in out of the case I get NO voltage on any of 12V plug ins (I do get 5VDC on two of the twenty pin pairs, so I am assumimg the power supply is bad. We put in the new motherboard and CPU due to frequent crashes until it went chronocally 'system failure due to CPU' test. Now it looks like the real root cause was that the power supply was failing. To your point there is only one 4 pin ATX connector on the board. There is another female four pin connector marked 'CPU' peeking out from behind the motherboard mounting plate but it is integral to the box not the board and I do not believe it was hooked to anything when we had the old motherboard in place so I did not mess with it.

Might want to check the HW against the PSU requirements...you didn't indicate 'what else was in the box'. Sorry it didn't come to life out of the case .. sometimes the slightest short ...like an extra standoff, can cause such problems and you'll never find it when installed in the case and connected to some or all of the peripherals. VAPCMD PS....Take a close look at the old MB and see what the capacitors look like...my daughter's A7V8X has a bad PSU replaced it and later discovered that a number of capacitors were going SOUTH. Replaced the MB not too long thereafter.

It was dead on all of the 12v connectors. Wally at CBC computer repairs (very knowledgeable and helpful) tested it for me on a Sunday afternoon. I ran to Best Buy, upgraded to a 650W, plugged everything in, reloaded Windows and it works fine. The old ASUS motherboard showed no visible signs of bad caps etc., but since the new MB was an upgrade and was already in we did not go back and try the old MB with the new power supply and I don't have the equipment to do a component level test. Thanks again for your help.
