i have no idea what you are getting at now.
did you reread all posts to make sure we are saying the same things?
is your first post supposed to say &quot;what are&quot; and not &quot;why are&quot;?
that is the only thing i can figure is wrong here.
the router works, i just reattached it.
it is a hawking hbr 49. now that i reattached it the hub(new) doesn't work.
it is a lynksys nh1005(new).
this is how i have it set up.
wall phone jack to modem, a speedstream 4200. modem to router.
2 original pcs are currently in router because the hub will not work from router ports.
the hub is currently connected to the first port, no signal.
pcs are in 2 & 3 working fine i am going to double check the cabling to make sure new cable isn't different wiring sequence.
