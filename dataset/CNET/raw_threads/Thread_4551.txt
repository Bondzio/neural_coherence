My Hard drive as we speak works a bit than goes silent, I don't have a light where my hard-drive is like most PC's to tell whether its working but its &quot;somewhat&quot; loud, but normally only while playing games. Lately (perhaps I&quot;m paying more attention) I can hear it working but it stops, much like hard drives I've had in the past. Is this normal?

Thanks!
