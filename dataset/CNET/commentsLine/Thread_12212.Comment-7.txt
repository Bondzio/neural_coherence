check with chaintech's support website to see what if any bios updates are avaialble and what they do.
next, are those new ram modules double or single sided populated?
often times mixng high or low density ram causes problems(single or double-sided).
regardless, of what they stated, it does make a difference when you mix it up too much or its just not compatible enough.
play with the ram setting in bios for the default or *safe* level for now.
in some cases, you can tweek it abit to the next level of cas and see if that works better, plus if voltage tweekable, up it a notch.
last, chaintech, imho is not a good mtrbd.
though it seems to give you past good service, its a cheapie.
