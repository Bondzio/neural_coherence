i have an ftp server at home (3com 3cserver).
it is just an old pc with several hard drives.
i can use my browser to connect using &quot; ftp://10.0.0.50&quot; in the url.
i like it better than microsoft &quot;file and print sharing&quot;.
it is all about preference.
i find the ms protocols very chatty.
this is ok on an ethernet switch with 100 meg of full duplex bandwidth but i want my wireless only sending necessary traffic.
