Sometimes there is a laptop or two added in to the mix. Currently, we are on a peer-to-peer network with a router. The system tends to be extremely slow at times. My question: What are the benefits to going to a server-based network? Everything I read wants to talk about file and print sharing (we already do), internet sharing (we already do) and similar items that any simple network will accomplish. What I want to know is if going to a server-based network will make my life easier, in any way, especially if it will speed up my network. BTW, we have no IT person. I am drafted because I am the only one who is not afraid to open the box and put the new stuff in or to research these kinds of questions. Thanks in advance for any advice, ideas etc.

You did not mention if you are wired, wireless, mixed, what speeds you are operating at, 10Mb, 100Mb, Gb, etc? You also did not mention what aspects of the network are slow. Are you experiencing slow file sharing, slow internet, both? What operating systems are you using? Do you have a back up (disaster recovery) procedures in place? I think there are a lot of factors in how and what the network is used for that would determine the benefits of having a dedicated server. Even in your small environment, a server based solution probably would give you better performance, as servers are optimized to perform things such as file transfers and etc better. But you would have to consider the cost of the server, cost of the OS, your learning curve, etc. Besides the performance increase, having a central point for file storage/sharing would make it easier to back up files, apply security settings, and processing print jobs would be better too. If you are running a slow 10Mb switch, it maybe as simple as upgrading your switch to a faster 100Mb or even GB (although that would probably require you to update the NICs in your PCs as well.) I'm getting long winded, but I think I would need more information about what you have now, and what you use the network for to give you the best answer. Perhaps others will have a stronger opinion.

While a review of the cable and network &quot;plant&quot; is a good idea (you see that covered in the other reply) the bottom line is one needs to nail down what is slow. Some may find file browses to be slow but there's a known issue with XP/2000 on that and I can share that if that's the issue. But until something specific is noted we'll just have to live with our nails, jello, hammer and a wall. Bob

What we have now are the 5 Windows XP professional machines, all 2-5 years old. I believe the switch is a 10/100 mb switch. It is not one of the newer, faster ones. I have recommended changing to those, but my boss is reluctant, thinking that we may need to upgrade to a server. For background, we are a busy law office. Main file sharing is to prepare paperwork and we use a calendar, case management program that is also shared. Obviously, the printer is also shared, as well as internet. The internet doesn't seem to be slowed much, if any. Just basically the file and printer sharing. We back up daily, overwriting the previous weeks backup so that we have 5 days of back ups at any given time. So far, we back up to a different machine than the files reside on, backing up the files that contain the information, not the programs themselves. I am not convinced this protects us adequately, but that is for another discussion. Right now, what I need to figure out is if upgrading to a newer, faster, better switch will be good enough or if we really need a dedicated server. Cost isn't as much of a factor now that dedicated server costs have gone done considerably. The biggest factor is streamlining and becoming more productive.

Some of your questions will be answered in my previous post to the other person who answered my first post. Slow is basically stopped. In other words, when someone accesses the case management program residing on my computer, my computer basically stops working while it does it's thing. It's not a 1 or 2 second stutter, but an actually 1 to 2 minute stop. It's really annoying. That is the main problem. There are other glitches here or there that we could live with, but this one is driving us all crazy. The case management program is continually accessed by all of us through out the day. When it stops, we can't even answer questions on the phone or set appointments. Thanks for your attention to this matter.

Often people don't install motherboard driver packages or don't know to flip the DMA off and on (a nifty XP bug.) I'm more than patient to wait for full details. Bob
15223	6	210152	2255207	2255159	DisneyMom92	10/10/06 1:31 PM	1.16048706E12	You are right!	OK, you totally lost me. I don't know what DMA is let alone know how to turn it on and off. As far as a complete XP install, it came installed, and I don't believe I have ever messed with it. I can give you more complete details tomorrow when I get to work. Thanks for your help.

Now before I share the link, I find it amazing that no matter what I write to warn them that this is something we just flip, many will look and not perform the simple flip that does not require a reboot. I've yet to find kind simple words so I'm approaching the day when I'll don a caveman outfit to point and grunt at it until it's done. http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx The bug is that I find XP to report it's in DMA mode but to be inaccurate about which level. Fix? Flip it. Bob

Not sure what it is expandable to. Thanks again for all your help.

15223	13	210152	2258566	2258256	R. Proffitt	10/11/06 8:56 AM	1.16055696E12	Yes, 256MB is 1/2 what I'd want to see. but...	http://www.dell.com/downloads/us/products/optix/gx270_spec.pdf#search=%22Dell%20Optiplex%20GX270%22 notes this is the 865G chipset. Did your install include this August 21, 2006 driver? http://downloadfinder.intel.com/scripts-df-external/filter_results.aspx?strTypes=all&ProductID=816&OSFullName=Windows*+XP+Professional&lang=eng&strOSs=44&submit=Go%21 &quot;I do realize that the RAM is low, but not sure if it will result in a large boost in speed if I double it. Not sure what it is expandable to.&quot; If you could accomplish the DMA flip, the driver above and get to the more common happy spot of 512M you may see a happy machine. Bob

I have installed what you suggested as well. I have also ordered memory for 512 x 2 (my computer requires 2). Can I/Should I use the existing 256 in the other two slots to increase the memory even more or just use the 2 new ones? All of the other computers also only had 256 so I am increasing those to a higher level too, depending on what the computer required (1 or 2). That brings me back to my original question: Will a dedicated server help us in any way in improved productivity/speed or is it just repeating what we already have? Thanks so much for all of the advice you have already given. I have learned a lot.
15223	15	210152	2259639	2259556	R. Proffitt	10/11/06 2:57 PM	1.16057862E12	Check the manual?	Or Crucial.com as to the RAM. I think I supplied a link to the machine but Crucial.com has a configurator that can help. &quot;That brings me back to my original question: Will a dedicated server help us in any way in improved productivity/speed or is it just repeating what we already have?&quot; It usually helps since the slowdown isn't noted by the user that has to serve it up. Did the flipflop to PIO then back to DMA and latest drivers give any relief? Bob

I ordered it directly from Dell, what they recommended for the specific machine. Cost wasn't bad so I just went with them. Thanks for all your help.
