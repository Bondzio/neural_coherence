gentlemen: my computer is a hewlett packard vectra vl400 pentium iii with a 1gb speed running windows 98se.
the bios only recognizes one floppy drive even though the motherboard has a standard floppy controller.
is there a floppy disk controller card that can be installed on this computer and what type is it?
i would like to install a 31/2 - 51/4 combination drive in an open external 51/4 bay.
thank you for your attention to and cooperation in this matter.
very truly yours, richard schmitz richardschmitz_1@hotmail.com
