<s> So the Acer Aspire AO751h can be had for as little as $280 these days. </s>
<s> This is with Win XP and the 3-cell battery. </s>
<s> The version with the six-cell battery runs for $300. </s>
<s> I'm seriously tempted... </s>
<s> I actually played around with the Acer Aspire 751 at Office Max, although they had the version with Vista on it. </s>
<s> I also looked at the Gateway LT31 series at Best Buy, which is quite similar in form factor, although the internals are different. </s>
<s> In any case, I'm a fan of the 11.6&quot; screen and full-size keyboard. </s>
<s> But that Atom Z-series processor is holding me back... even if I uninstall all the bloatware, add another gig of RAM, how well would this thing perform? </s>
<s> I wouldn't use it to watch full-screen video, although regular YouTube or Hulu viewing would be nice... although even that is not essential to me. </s>
<s> Browsing and office apps, perhaps with playing MP3s simultaneously, is as demanding as it would get. </s>
<s> I know that the Acer Aspire 1410 can be had for $450, but that's still significantly more expensive than $280-300. </s>
<s> I wouldn't use it all that often anyway. </s>
<s> So, do any of you have the AO751h with XP? </s>
<s> Would you recommend it? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> What bloatware? </s>
<s> I own the Aspire One atom powered unit and didn't find such. </s>
<s> What did you consider bloatware? </s>
<s> And I see no reason to bump the RAM. </s>
<s> I only use it for running out of the office for demos, patching up our applications so my view is that it is no laptop replacement. </s>
<s> It's a fine get out there for cheap spare laptop (but it's no laptop!) </s>

<s> You posted you bought the Dell unit so by now you know more than you let on in this post. </s>
<s> I've read several user reviews stating that the Aspire 751 comes installed with a fair amount of bloatware. </s>
<s> Some have said that uninstalling these free and trial apps helped speed up the computer somewhat. </s>
<s> I don't have time to find the URLs to these reviews (go to CNet, Amazon, etc.) </s>
<s> but they're not difficult to find. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what you are insinuating here, I certainly do not &quot;know more than (I) let on in this post.&quot; I did buy the Dell Mini 10v a couple of months ago, but I returned it a week later. </s>
<s> I didn't care for its keyboard. </s>
<s> The Mini 10v had the Atom N270 CPU with the 1024x576 screen. </s>
<s> The Aspire 751 has a slower Atom Z520 CPU that must drive a higher resolution 1366x768 display, which has nearly 50% more pixels. </s>
<s> I think it's perfectly fair for me to ask whether there's a significant performance hit between these two machines. </s>
<s> Ok, I have the Acer Aspire One here and no sign of such. </s>
<s> Can you give me one example? </s>
<s> Many you are talking about the eStuff? </s>
<s> But that's not bloat. </s>
<s> That's the software to create restore media and more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Now tell why you are considering Atom netbooks since you can find dual core machines with all the trimmings for nearly the same price. </s>
<s> Tell all. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I was considering a netbook primarily because of the size and weight advantages. </s>
<s> My desktop is my primary machine, so I don't necessarily need a laptop to replace or substitute it with. </s>
<s> As they say, the netbook would complement my desktop. </s>
<s> I'd rather not lug around a six-pound laptop with a 15.6&quot; screen. </s>
<s> You'd also have to carry around the power supply with one of those as well, whereas you wouldn't necessarily have to do that with a netbook that has a six-cell battery, making it an even more lightweight and compact solution. </s>
<s> It's quite the little performer as I demo our company applications. </s>
<s> It's running Office 2003, Visual Studio, our apps and so much more. </s>
<s> I can say I won't be upgrading its RAM or anything else. </s>
<s> Our application is Bluetooth centric so I did add the small Bluetooth adapter. </s>
<s> It's the same size as the Logitech v450 Nano Mouse's adapter. </s>
<s> There are zero performance issues to date. </s>
<s> And the 6 cell version is hovering at 300 bucks so not a budget buster. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Out of curiosity, what anti-virus or security app do you run on it? </s>
<s> If you run one at all, that is. </s>
<s> Understandably, it would make sense to install one which has a small footprint per se. </s>
<s> I installed the same thing I use on my other machine. </s>
