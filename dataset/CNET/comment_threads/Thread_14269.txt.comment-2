Which 3rd Party software are you using to monitor temprature because 58-60 definately seems to high.
I recommend a peice of software called Motherboard monitor to monitor temps.
You can get it from this site - http://mbm.livewiredev.com/ Also, check the CPU temp in the BIOS as that'll be more accurate than the 3rd Party one you're using at the moment.
