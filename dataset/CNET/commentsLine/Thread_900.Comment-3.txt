i came across a situation like that and their it staffer lost their job over it.
they had spent months trying to solve it and the owner came to me out of desperation since the trade show was looming and they had to have it working.
the it staffer was put to other work and we jerry-rigged a solution using multiple aps and routers.
their it staffer exploded and quit the next day and the show went off without a hitch.
be sure you are not restricting your options here as they were.
they were trying to do this with a single box.
