After this u should see a list. in this list, you should be able to identify display adapter. click the + button to open it. identify what it says there. then go to w/e manufacturer it says and try downloading the latest drivers.

I had found all of that and have gone to Radeon and the update downloads require service pack 2 which I have never installed. Thanks for you help. PS I cant install service pack 2 because an idiot tried to repartition my hard drive and I lost the recovery capabilities. Just as an after thought. Should I just go ahead and bite the bullet and buy the start up disks from Sony so I can straighten all this mess out.
