It's limited by the FCC in this country and being a tablet is a bit of a problem since you're never sure of orientation such as a laptop screen would be.
Figure that all tablets get a few feet less than a laptop in the same setting.
At the office we have many tablets but not this one.
Frankly if I had a choice I'd get the iPad.
Once you have a few you'll know why.
