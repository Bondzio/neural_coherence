<s> Hey guys, I'm looking at purchasing a copy of the new Media Centre Edition 2005 in light of the fact that XBox 360 will be coming out shortly. </s>
<s> I'm hoping to install it on my existing PC, but am wondering what sorts of system requirements it has. </s>
<s> Currently I am running a P4 2.8 GHz HT enabled system and Windows XP Pro SP2 (32 bit hardware and software). </s>
<s> By the time I install MCE 2005 I will have a 3.2 GHz HT enabled processor in there though (I'm building a PC for a friend and am going to do the old switcheroo :P ). </s>
<s> I have 1 GB of RAM and a RADEON 9600 Graphics card (with a dual monitor setup). </s>
<s> I also have a Lifeview Terrestrial DBV-T card installed. </s>
<s> I'll be putting a second hard drive in there for recording and buffering live TV also. </s>
<s> My motherboard is a Gigabyte GA1000MK So here are my questions; Would it run ok off a 3.2 GHz HT enabled 32 bit processor? </s>
<s> Would my graphics card do a good enough job? </s>
<s> Would the DBV-T card I have work ok (I plan on putting a second card in also - any recommendations)? </s>
<s> Would I need to purchase a hardware MPEG-2 encoder? </s>
<s> I have a D-Link DWL-G520 PCI card in there. </s>
<s> Would that be suitable for streaming to an extender (i.e. </s>
<s> an XBox 360)? </s>
<s> Are there any other hardware considerations I would have to take into account? </s>
<s> I know that's a lot of questions. </s>
<s> I've been trying to read up on as much about MCE 2005 as I can, but I have been unable to answer these questions so far, and I don't want to buy the software and a remote if it's not going to work well. </s>
<s> I would really appreciate any answers/partial answers anyone can give me!! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> purchase a Radeon AIW card instead of Windows MCE 2005, that way it's ensured to work as to your questions: A) yes the CPU should be easily fine B) yes the GPU should also be easily fine C) you would need to check www.microsoft.com for that information, there is a specific list of supported cards D) not as far as I know E) not sure what that is, i'm assuming it's a PCI Ethernet card? </s>
<s> it should be ok, but I'm not quite sure what it is (I don't feel like looking it up...) you should be fine, but quite honestly i'd just get an AIW card from ATi and go with that, mostly because you can get a more powerful GPU (depending on what you buy) and it's an excellent software package, that offers lots of features, yet doesn't really change much on the PC </s>
