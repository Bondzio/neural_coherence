i wanna get started on my own custom pc, which i hope to ugrade later.
I have parts like CD rom, and Floppy drive, and a harddrive, also a monitor, and keyboard and mouse.
I checked out oveclocking.com becase my friend recomended it and he has built many computers.
heres what i found.
I was just wondering if any1 knew if the parts were compatible with each other, i have a socket 939 motherboard, and a socket 939 cpu.
