here's a radeon 9250 ($30): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814131255 here's a geforce 6200 ($40): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814121542 if your case won't accept a full height backplate, you can remove it and mount the secondary monitor plug in an adjacent slot.
hopefully, your case provides mini backplates, but if not you can probably find some on ebay.
alternatively, you may be able to add a pci graphics card since they usually can co-exist with integrated graphics.
personally, i'd still go with once of the agp cards mentioned above, but here's a geforce2 mx400 pci card: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814139150
