Err.....Mike, I lean towards mostly what jrmar says.
The author was basing much of his comments on what he had at the time of the tests and IMO didn't fully take into consideration the potential of the T6212...by just adding a decent video card it would whip all the computers in that test on everything.
And with increasing the RAM..even more so.
The IDE hard drive is of small consideration in view of the other power potential.
Just my opinion.
Wife has a 3 year old emachine that we have never had occasion to call emachine.
If concerned about a future problem, buy from Best Buy and get their inexpensive warranty, and their 'Geek' guys will take care of it not needing a call to emachine.
BTW, I'm not sure how that pay call works with emachine...I would think it would be after the warranty period runs out???
Regards,
