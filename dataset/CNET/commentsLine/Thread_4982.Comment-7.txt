in my computer that is a 7 yr old gateway, max sdram is 768 mb dimm.
i checked it with this:  it shows i have 3 slots and non-parity sdram, pc133, in each one 256mb, 128mb & 128mb.
that means i can replace the 2 (128) with 2 (256mb).
the math checks for 256 times 3= 768mb.
it will tell you how much ram your computer supports & what you have in there now.
it also can be pc100 but they are outdated.
