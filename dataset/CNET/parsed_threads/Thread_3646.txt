<s> I bought a WD-VelociRaptor 300 Gig Hard Drive 32 MB Sata-6 G Piriform Speccy Tells me Somthing Different How do I tell if what Speccy is corect or wrong The Seller tells me something different, and western Digital told me to give them the Serial # I got what was Stated above. </s>
<s> Speccy is corect about everything else on my computer. </s>

<s> The label/decal/sticker provides the info you need. </s>
<s> It readily IDs the HD and you need proceed to the support website and use that for any further details. </s>
<s> Finding your similar posts for s/w help, the decal, etc., has always all that is needed. </s>
<s> The only way it could differ if the vendor is somehow deceiving you but not the manufacturer. </s>
<s> So other than that, the decal is good enough. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Decal is wrong Western Digital Says So They Told me to give them the Serial # and thats how they new. </s>
<s> A lot is wrong Stating on the Label and the searial # I do not care what the label says just as long a I get what I ordered. </s>
<s> Wendell </s>
<s> You better care as the label IDs the product. </s>
<s> using that SN# and since WD already says, they're not what is suppose to, then you have a case. </s>
<s> You need to contact the vendor and address the issue. </s>
<s> If you haven't already, stop any payment. </s>
<s> If local, contact them. </s>
<s> If not, then contact by whatever means in order to resolve this. </s>
<s> If in fact this is something on the illegal nature you need to report it. </s>
<s> besides contacting WD to help resolve the problem, that vendor has to be held accountable. </s>
<s> Take notes, save paperwork, whatever in order to prove your case as now if you proceed it may become a legal matter if the vendor doesn't stand behind the product. </s>
<s> As for WD, besides being contacted how or what they once you explain the matter would be a matter they may want to press. </s>
<s> It's up to you as to how you proceed but i wouldn't become uncivil in this issue. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> I should identify your disk including the serial # to make sure it matches the label. </s>
<s> The serial # does not match the what was sent to me it matches what I ordered it is Sad. </s>
<s> Two different Statement confirmation emails. </s>
<s> Thank you Wendell </s>
<s> You didn't mention where you got it so no one can tell if you purchased from a reputable vendor. </s>
<s> I could wonder if it wasn't a &quot;refurb&quot; drive that had the controller board replaced as the SN and other drive parameters would be burned onto the board's circuitry. </s>
<s> This being the case, you need to confront the seller with the information and see if they'll make this right. </s>
<s> The other option...and if you got a very friendly price...is to keep it and live with it. </s>
<s> Caveat emptor. </s>
<s> It is not refurbished it is OEM, but I am starting to wonder what it is. </s>
<s> I spent money at this place since 2004. </s>
<s> You buy something and then it is all out of stock ? </s>
<s> Wendell </s>
<s> I Do not want to take a Chance on the next one they where going to send me because it still does not match up to what I first ordered. </s>
<s> I will buy HD from another Vender. </s>
<s> (TRUST) Thank You Everybody For the Help Wendell </s>
<s> sounds to me - from china. </s>
<s> took a smaller drive and made changes to the fat to say its the right size etc and stuck a label on that matches what he wanted. </s>
<s> I ran into that with SDHC cards - smaller cards - label changed and the report back in the fat says higher mem and class. </s>
<s> not so - some dont work at all or you just end up with a 1 to 4 g card. </s>
<s> these were purch IN the usa with no mention of where from. </s>
<s> only use reputable sellers for electronics ! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I did use a reputable seller one I have been using over a decade. </s>
<s> Built three computers from buying parts I bought from them. </s>
<s> I do not chose to use their name. </s>
<s> They have refunded my money back into my account. </s>
<s> I am not happy off what happened, and hope it does not happen again to me or some one else. </s>
<s> To everybody just be carefull when you buy parts or anything online. </s>
