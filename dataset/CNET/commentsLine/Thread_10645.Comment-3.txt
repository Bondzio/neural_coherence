i bought a vista computer last christmas with only 1gb of memory on it and the improvement after i added a second was profound.
most vista systems now come with 2 gb of ram.
this change came about only a few months after i bought the computer.
i'm now hoping to upgrade to 4 gb in a few years.
unfortunately i only have two slots so i'll have to get 2 gb of ram/slot.
for me your new lower price is good news maybe i can up grade sooner then i thought.
rams come in many forms.
the faster they are the more they cost.
remember that old saying &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;.
here a link to some good basic information.
read it carefully before going ram shopping.
