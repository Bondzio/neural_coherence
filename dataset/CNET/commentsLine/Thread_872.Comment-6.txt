sometimes i wonder how i miss such things.
but the 2200 might be the dgn2200 which is why i asked.
keep in mind that netgear's latest may not be their best version (research their ipad connect issues.)
as netgear does not publish an user manual i won't be able to provide an exact answer.
again, i see you may dislike this but in the future be sure to select routers that have a manual.
