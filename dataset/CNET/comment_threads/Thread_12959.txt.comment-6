I would add I've have good luck with Plextor ... downside is cost and their ratings are't materially better than drives 1/2 their price.
NEC, Samsung and LG are the ones I'd probably look at now.
Re durability...
I've never had one fail of any brand and there are no stats that I've seen to recommend one over another.
They're truly becoming more of a commodity.
My advice again ... look at the current crop as reviewed in the refs provided ...might try PC World and and PC Magazine too...then read some of the buyer comments from Newegg.com.
Make sure they have the features you want, pick one or maybe even two ... they are very very inexpensive these days and place your order.
