Good morning, I had two go bad last year.
Fortunately a friend let me borrow a copy of the puppy Linux operating system on cd for the second one.
You start the computer with cd in drive and external drive attached.
If you have ever used dos, it works like that.
I am better at showing than telling.
Linux recognized the drive and I was able to copy everything to a new drive.
It literally took 22 or more hours to copy but worth it.
Google Puppy Linux and see what you find.
Good luck and Happy Easter.
