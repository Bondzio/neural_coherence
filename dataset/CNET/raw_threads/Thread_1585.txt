Our technician left system running overnight to run through various sequences to validate proper operation. In the morning system had crashed with the harddrive mechanically 'stuck'. The drive seems mechanically 'damaged' and refuses to spin on this and also other machines in our lab. What (if any) can I do to recover data at reasonable cost. HELP!! Thanks,

CDR drives and disks are pretty cheap and if you can support a DVD recorder, a 4.7GB R/W media is 2 bucks and the drive is 79 to 199 bucks. Which will be less than your recovery costs. Best of luck, Bob
