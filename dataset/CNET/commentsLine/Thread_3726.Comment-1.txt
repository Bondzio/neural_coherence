my computer has a k7s5a pro socket a main board.the cpu is an athlon xp 2000 which i suspect to be defective.
the heatsink is held in place by two retentipon clips on either side of the heatsink unit.
i can't figure how to remove the clips from the socket 462 base so that i can get to the cpu.
there must be an easy way to do it, but i can't figure how.
help!!
thanks, ray savage
