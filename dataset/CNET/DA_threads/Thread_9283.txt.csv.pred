1.1.1	Hey guys, Sorry if this has been covered before.	St
1.1.2	I have a laptop with a G internal wireless network card, and during the summer months when I have time off, I take the laptop up to the lake and would like to use the internet for basic things though the open networks that are up there.	St
1.1.3	Currently I can see some networks up there some locked out other not, but unfortunately I am just unable to get a strong enough signal to connect to the open ones.	St
1.1.4	For windows users maybe 1 or 2 bars (20-30%) or about -75 - -90 db.	St
1.1.5	For something to try I bought a D-link dwa 160 dual band usb wireless N unit to try and boost the range which it did to a point.Now I was getting (50-60%)/(-65 - -80db) or 3 bars on the protected networks and 1 or 2 on the un protected.	St
1.1.6	Just enough to for the network to issues me an IP address but not enough to do anything online.	St
1.1.7	I am wondering if there is any devices out there any one can recommend to improve my range and allow me to connect to some of those open networks I can see.	St
1.1.8	I see allot of antennas and boosters out there but as far as I know those are meant for transmission of existing networks not necessarily reception of WIFI.	St
1.1.9	Any help is greatly appreciated, Thanks, soundguy_99	Polite
1.2.1	Unprotected signals mean the owner will, eventually, lock it up.	St
1.2.2	Especially when they notice their network in use.	St
1.2.3	In your case, accessing these signals is, by definition, &quot;Theft of Service&quot;.	St
