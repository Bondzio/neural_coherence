1.1.1	eMachines T3092 Athlon 3000+ 2.17Ghz 2G RAM , Windows XP Just had put in e-GeForce 7600 GS AGP graphics card , says on the box it requires 400W PSU .	St
1.1.2	So upgraded my 300W to a 450W .	St
1.1.3	Was getting error message on boot saying that not enough power was going to the graphics card so it was lowering performance so as not to damage hardware .	St
1.1.4	So I got a 600W PSU put in there , and still the same thing is happening .	St
1.1.5	Why ?	Ques
1.1.6	And what do I try next ?	Ques
1.2.1	an additional/required power lead to the video card or to a special location on the mobo for that purpose ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.2	I got that message on a system a few weeks ago .	St
1.2.3	In one there was a place near the bottom of the mobo to connect a 4 pin molex to .	St
1.3.1	Thanks , finally had a chance to get the case opened , and it was the extra power connection that was unhooked .	St
1.3.2	All 's well now .	St
