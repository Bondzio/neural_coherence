Hi Guys Got an interesting problem here.
this pc with xp home sp3 with these speakers that are 8yrs+ has basic audigy sound card and videologic ZXR500 5:1 speakers /stats below Output power: Total 65W RMS; fronts,rears and centre 8W RMS; subwoofer 25W RMS Input sensitivity: 350 mV Frequency response: Amplifier 20 Hz to 20kHz SUBWOOFER Power output: 25W RMS.......SATELLITE SPEAKERS Power output: 8W RMS each sound is great...well at least it is really loud.
my other pc also xp home sp3 has no sound card but is asus mobo P5B DELUXE WI-FI with onboard sound via SOUND MAX New speakers are the highly rated LOGITECH X-540 5:1...stats below Technical Specifications o Total RMS power: 70 watts RMS Satellites: 45 watts RMS (2 x 7.4W front, 15.4W centre, 2 x 7.4W rear) Subwoofer: 25 watts RMS o Total peak power: 140 watts o Frequency response: 40 Hz - 20 kHz sound is poor better if use stereo rubbish in surround and volume is half that of the videologic sys.
Question: Is it the speakers that are poor or do i need to get a sound card thanks reptile1
