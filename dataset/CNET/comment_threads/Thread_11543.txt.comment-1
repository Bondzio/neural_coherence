I have a PCI USB card that has a question mark on it in devices in my computer properties.
Would I be right in saying that we need to remove it, re-boot without it ... shut down, plug the card back in and then re-boot to see if windows picks it up?
I need this confirmation for my hubby to see as he says it won't matter leaving it with a big Yellow question mark over it.
I know it will damage the PC if the PCI card is left unfound for too long ... am I right?
Would like to say thanks in advance.
