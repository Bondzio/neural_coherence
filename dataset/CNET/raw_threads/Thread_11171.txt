I previously had a Linksys WRT54G, before I upgraded to my new router I was getting quite good signals and my internet speed on my pc was ranging from 3.7 - 4.5 Mbps. After upgrading to a Cisco Linksys E4200 based on the great Cnet ratings, my internet speed has plumetted to a range of 2.5 - 3.1 Mbps and the Signal Strength on my wireless connection has gone to &quot;Very Low&quot; I have checked the channels of the surrounding routers (using a software called network stumbler ). I am using channel 1 which is not being used by anyone else. I am just surprised, I thought my speed and connection strength would sky rocket after getting such a good router. Anyone got any idea what I may be doing wrong?

It could be out of date firmware or some combination of MAC filtering and hiding the SSID but those details are not here. Try telling more and be sure to try it the simple way with current firmware, SSID broadcasting, router defaults and WPA2 AES personal security. Bob

However here I let my router pick the channel. It saves me from checking into this setting ever again. Call me lazy, I don't like to fiddle with the router. Bob

NAT is a firewall since there will be no inbound connections that can make it to your machine unsolicited. It can cause slowdowns in some routers. Some folk dig in their heels on item 2. It's understandable but then again, NAT is a firewall too. Bob

I have not changes the WPA2/WPA to just WPA2 because one of my wireless cards doesnn't connect if it's just WPA2. 3. I have moved a small obsturction out of the routers way. I am now getting a bit better internet speed. just as a comparison, if I am sitting next to the router the speed of the internet is above 20Mbps, but in a room upstairs (router is downstairs) I am now getting about 3.5 Mbps, so ideally I would like to get up to atleast 10 Mbps is the upstairs room.

On a personal comment, I hope these makers start offering some reduced options where they offer the things that have issues in some expert menus. Bob
