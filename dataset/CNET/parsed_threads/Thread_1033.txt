<s> I use to build computers all the time, maybe 20-25 total, but that was WAY back in the 2-core days. </s>
<s> I just simply burned out & didn't have fun doing it any longer. </s>
<s> But I still do my own family computers, since I'm a bit picky. </s>
<s> I guess I was pretty good at picking the pieces, since this ancient Athlon64X2-4800+ / Nvidia9800GT rig is only now feeling serious effects of the &quot;I-Can't-Do-That&quot; disease. </s>
<s> So it's time for new. </s>
<s> The results of several recent 3a.m. </s>
<s> bedtimes have allowed me to figure out the best parts for my price-range ... graphics, memory, case, drives, etc. </s>
<s> The MOBO won't be a problem, since that's always been my favorite piece to research. </s>
<s> However, because of how long I've been out of the loop, I'm WAY behind on new CPU-tech. </s>
<s> That's where I need YOUR help, although I have narrowed the possibilities down to a minimum. </s>
<s> There's just a couple (that means 3 or 5) items which I'm still clueless about. </s>
<s> You saw above I haven't picked a MOBO yet, for the obvious reason I haven't picked a CPU yet. </s>
<s> But I'm going with 1 of 6 for sure (or 1 of 9, I'll elaborate at the end). </s>
<s> Although I've used 90% AMD's, I'm not completely Intel-Stupid. </s>
<s> I'm NOT a fan-boy either way & hope this thread doesn't devolve into that. </s>
<s> So the basics are, I'm looking at AMD FX-8350, 8320, or 8120. </s>
<s> I shouldn't even include the last one, since it ranks quite a bit lower than the first 2 on about every benchmark/comparison I've been able to find, at only $25'ish cheaper. </s>
<s> These are all 8-core. </s>
<s> Now, for Intel, I've picked i5-2450P, 3470, or 2500K. </s>
<s> I've read remarkable stories about the last one, even though several benchmarks place it a bit lower than the 1st two. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, I'm a good OC'er & seems like that &quot;K&quot; signifies a chip which works well with that art, so it could probably be convinced to operate at near the performance of the 1st two. </s>
<s> And it also already has a higher clock speed than either, but significantly lower than the 1st two AMDs. </s>
<s> I'm plenty computer-savvy to know that doesn't mean a whole lot in modern chips, but I'll be the first to admit that it's my major CPU-weakness .... </s>
<s> I LUV seeing those monstrous clocks, like the 4.0GHZ of the biggest AMD above. </s>
<s> I do know that typically Intel usually beats AMD same-4-same, and quite often even a couple notches HIGHER of an AMD. </s>
<s> But here's my main stickler. </s>
<s> Best that I can tell, ALL i5's are 4-core. </s>
<s> All AMD's above are 8-core. </s>
<s> (Let's not get into hyperthreading discussion in depth, although it may play a part, if i5's actually have it) So ... even though Intel chips quite often outperform AMD chips, will those 8-core AMD chips have a noticable advantage above those 4-core Intels? </s>
<s> If not, will those extra 4 cores allow the AMD chips to perform AS WELL as the Intels? </s>
<s> I bring that up because ALL of the AMD's, with only 1 sole exception, are up to 60 bucks cheaper. </s>
<s> I'm NOT building a bargain-basement system here, but I'm also a Disabled Vet with fixed income. </s>
<s> $25 doesn't matter, $60 might. </s>
<s> So will I get better performance from those faster, bigger, & cheaper AMDs? </s>
<s> Or will the somewhat more expensive, smaller, & slower Intels STILL outdo them? </s>
<s> That's the main question & the only one I need a definite answer to. </s>
<s> However, as hinted at above, there are 3 more CPUs I'm eyeing as curiosities. </s>
<s> The A10-5800K, A10-5700, & A8-5600K APUs, with integrated graphics. </s>
<s> Now right off the bat I KNOW these don't ompute as well as ANY of the 6 above, but they aren't dramatically too far back. </s>
<s> My new build WILL have a great graphics card in it, so I'm not saying I'll rely on the onboard video. </s>
<s> But the plan is to buy SLI/Crossfire capable stuff, but only 1 card for now. </s>
<s> I'm not even sure I'll like a dual graphic set-up, but doing it this way allows me to add that second card later, if I so choose. </s>
<s> But will these chips with onboard Radeon graphics work together with a dedicated Radeon card, much like a Crossfire setup? </s>
<s> he biggest & neatest advantage I see by going this APU-route is that I would still have working video if I blew my card up. </s>
<s> (Remember I said that I OC'd .... well, sometimes I OD too & burn something up ) So does either of these reasons give me a legitimate reason to go with the less powerful APUs, which will actually do all the computing I want to do anyway? </s>
<s> Last thing, an &quot;addie&quot; since we got to talking about onboard graphic stuff. </s>
<s> I noticed that some new MOBOs have some decent onboard graphics now. </s>
<s> Will THIS graphics do an SLI/Crossfire-type deal with a dedicated video card? </s>
<s> Does it have to be the same brand? </s>
<s> In other words, if the MOBO graphics are Radeon, will it work with Nvidia, or just Radeon? </s>
<s> THIS option would allow me to do what I SHOULD do anyway & go with one of the faster pure-CPUs. </s>
<s> But then I'd still have that extra graphics when I melt my new dedicated video card. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for all help. </s>
<s> Add this. </s>
<s> Maybe it'll help with the CPU choice between Intel 4-cores & AMD 8-cores. </s>
<s> 3 things I basically do: 1. </s>
<s> I game. </s>
<s> NEVER on-line. </s>
<s> My games are almost entirely simulators. </s>
<s> SimCity4, upcoming SimCity Limited, Trainz 2011, Cities-XL, Tropico-4, Civ-5, junk like that. </s>
<s> I'm not running & shooting, but sometimes (often) build up humongous maps & metros. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I'm an author. </s>
<s> My books are almost always 1 of 2 genres. </s>
<s> #1 is novels built around events which could, or have, happened. </s>
<s> These require LOTS of research, so sometimes I may have 50 tabs open on 2 different browsers + my text editor open somewhere else. </s>
<s> I figure this type usage is more bandwidth/memory intensive, but it does use processor power also. </s>
<s> #2 type is BIG eye-candy books, the expensive type with large pretty pictures & little writing which you leave open on the end-table to impress your friends. </s>
<s> Here I may have much fewer tabs open, but they will each contain large hi-res images. </s>
<s> I may also have 1 or 2 image editors going (Photoshop, Ultimate-Paint, format changers, etc.) </s>
<s> So I figure this type is more graphic intensive, less bandwidth, about the same memory. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I'm a very active & somewhat advanced astrophotographer. </s>
<s> The images I take through the scopes via CCD are B&W exposed through 4 color filters. </s>
<s> The result is a set of &quot;FITS&quot; files, usually around 1500X1200, & often up to 300MB each, depending upon how long the exposure was. </s>
<s> All 4 of these will be open at one time in Photoshop, while I align, crop, adjust, etc. </s>
<s> The final, usually 500MB'ish, then goes through a converter to make it into hi-res TIFFS or lower-res PNGs. </s>
<s> VERY high memory usage, CPU, GPU, everything. </s>
<s> Maybe that info will help a little on which CPU-type is better. </s>
<s> Being a little intel biases and with bucks in mind. </s>
<s> The I5-2500/3570 seems to be the sweet spot/bang for the buck. </s>
<s> If you want to overclock add a &quot;k&quot; to the model. </s>
<s> Yes it only has 4 cores and yes you may have some app/s that will be faster with 8 cores. </s>
<s> Ram...........the fastest the machine will support. </s>
<s> Amount......enough to keep the swap file quiet. </s>
<s> I don't think your going to go very far wrong with that combo. </s>
<s> I'm in the process of my first custom build and was about to purchase an I5 2nd Gen 2400. </s>
<s> What is the difference between the two. </s>
<s> And do I need a gen 3 Intel processor to take advantage of SLI PCIe 3.0? </s>
<s> I have a cousin who is an accountant and I built her a system around the Intel&#174; Core&#8482; i5-2400 and the Asus P8Z68-M Pro board. </s>
<s> She loves it and very happy with it. </s>
<s> For gamer the Intel Core i5-2500K is a great value but if you aren't going to overclock then that really isn't much of a reason to spend the extra money. </s>
<s> 2400@3.1......turbo 3.4 2500@3.3......turbo 3.7 And do I need a gen 3 Intel processor to take advantage of SLI PCIe 3.0? </s>
<s> Looks like yes. </s>
