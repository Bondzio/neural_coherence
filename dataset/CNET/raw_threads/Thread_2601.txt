I have seen how to make a laptop into a WiFi hotspot here http://cnettv.cnet.com/make-your-laptop-hot-spot/9742-1_53-28619.html What I want to know is how do I do the same with a desktop PC with a Wired Internet connection and no WiFI capabilities so that I can share my Internet connection with my laptop or any other device. NOTE I AM USING VISTA 64 BIT OS SO PLEASE SUGGEST SOME USB ADAPTER THAT WORKS WITH VISTA 64 Additional Details I dont have a free PCI slot so can I use this or any similar one that works with Vista 64bit The ones available here. Belkin N Wireless USB Adapter Or the Belkin Wireless G which is quite in my budget Or the D-Link Wireless G DWA-110 USB Adapter Or DWA-140 RangeBooster N USB adapter(Like this one) My laptop Supports 802.11a/b/g and N draft(its an Acer Aspire 5738G)

8331	4	348933	3079870	3079819	GrandMasterTodd	7/12/09 1:09 PM	1.24740414E12	Yes	Yeah. It works like this: You hook a wireless router up to your cable/DSL modem. All of the computers that you'd like to connect wirelessly need to have a wireless adapter. Most new laptops already have this built-in. You can also have wired connections to the wireless router if you don't want to use wireless for all computers.

No extra software necessary. In fact, you don't even need the desktop to be able to use WiFi on your phone. Kees

Thus suggest me devices through which i can create an wifi hotspot in my desktop to share internet with my phone.. Thanks and regards

The 2 ways to do that seem to me: 1. The device from http://www.tataphoton.com/photon-wi-fi-hub.aspx combined with a wireless WiFi dongle in your PC 2. Using Internet Connection Sharing on your PC, then connect that to a wireless router that you setup as being an access point. Method 1 is basic. The main disadvantages of method 2 are (a) configuring ICS seems to be prohibitively difficult and (b) your PC needs to be switched on to use Internet on your phone. Kees
