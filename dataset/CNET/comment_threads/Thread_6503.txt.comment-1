Hi, when I try to print pictures and sometimes text, I get thick lines appearing vertically through it.
I have tried to re-align the print heads but it doesn't help.
I didn't have any problems until a few weeks ago and I can't seem to get rid of them.
I'm using Windows XP.
Any help would be great.
Thanks Ste
