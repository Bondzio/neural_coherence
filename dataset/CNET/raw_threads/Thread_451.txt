I've run into similiar problems, particularly with my Pro system (have 1 98, 1 XP Home laptop, and my main system with Pro). Bob mentioned ZoneAlarm, which I use. In the firewall configuration, I added the ip addresses of all the computers, AND the full range of addresses, e.g, 192.168.2.1-192.168.2.40. In addition, and this seems to have caused me the most problem, XP's firewall often automagically turns itself on, so in in the Local Area Connection Properties&gt;Advanced, I disable the XP firewall. I have the most problems with my Pro system. The 98 system NEVER has a problem, lol. So much for 'upgrades'. Hope this was of some help.
