I am in the market for a new (MAC-compatible) laser color multifunction printer that can handle printing, copying, scanning and faxing for my home office. Does any one have any suggestions/recommendations? I'm looking at the Xerox Phaser 6110MFP/X and would love anyone's thoughts on this particular model. Thanks!

Was disappointed by Canon; as far as Mac compatibility goes, they have zilcho in Color/MFP. HP doesn't even work smoothly with Windows computers at work, so I believe what I've heard about shoddy Mac drivers - haven't even looked there. Brother and Ricoh I believe have quality offerings, but neither offers Postscript 3 support as does the Xerox Phaser 6180MFP. (The 6110MFP doesn't have Postscript 3) www.ameiva.co.uk has cost per copy statistics, and the Xeroxes compare favorably. And the Xerox brochures seem to brag about their Mac compatibility - support for Bonjour. I just want to know that the scanner functions nicely with DEVONthink Pro Office?
