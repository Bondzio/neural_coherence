I am thinking to buy a new Graphic Card or only the cooling fan. My Graphic Card is Win Fast 128 MB PX 6600GT TDH (AMD Athlon 64 2.21 GHz and 3 GB RAM, Windows XP Pro SP 2 with all the latest updates)it was very noisy so I disconnected the cooling fan. I am requesting advice about this disconnection and the possible problems I may have.

The fan when disconnected should cause the device it was cooling to overheat and age quickly. There is no standard on this cooling area so you may have to be handy with small power tools and look at quiet replacements such as http://www.zalman.co.kr/eng/product/view.asp?idx=149 There are dozens of such devices.
