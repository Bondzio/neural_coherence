i installed a new wireless router.
my computer detected signal from my neighbors house as well as from my own router.
what prevents my neighbor from accessing files on my computer?
the firewall?
are there any precautions i should take for added security?
also, the router is less than 50 feet away from the computer, yet the signal strength is poor.
how can i increase the signal strength?
any help is appreciated.
