I googled microsoft &quot;windows xp setup floppy disks&quot; and I got some results.
I still want to know how do I make my BIOS read my cd-rom drive first.
I know what you mean by playing around in Setup, but I don't know where to go from there.
In Setup I get like 8 options and that is all.
Anyone know what I do in Setup to make my cd-rom drive read my Windows cd?
I just want a fresh clean start all over again from my ABS system.
I want all the files deleted (including the spyware) and I want a new start.
