I am trying to recover photos from a damaged Maxtor 80 GB Hard Drive.
I tried slaving it on my other computer, but my system would not start (tried all different variations of jumper settings).
I then placed it in a hard drive enclosure and it is visible under Disk Drives, but not listed in My Computer.
When I go to Disk Management, it appears as an unknown device and I am prompted to initialize the disk.
Will initialization delete the data on the drive?
