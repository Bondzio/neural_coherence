<s> At home I am trying to set up a local apache server to show a website on my LAN so I am able to share files through the website. </s>
<s> I have no trouble accessing the site from the host PC (I'm running windows by the way!) </s>
<s> but as soon as type the server name (HomeFiles) into the address bar on another PC on my LAN it cannot find the page! </s>
<s> Please colud someone let me know why this is happening! </s>
<s> Any other tips/suggestions would be welcomed! </s>
<s> Many Thanks </s>
<s> How would HomeFiles &quot;resolve?&quot; If Windows, add HomeFiles to your HOSTS file. </s>

<s> Try typing the IP of the computer. </s>
<s> Make sure it has a Static IP. </s>
<s> If you don't know how to set one up, use this page: http://portforward.com/networking/staticip.htm </s>
