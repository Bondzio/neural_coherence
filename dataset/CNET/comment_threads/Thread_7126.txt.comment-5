I have only turned it on when needed, hence have always shut it off manually.
Are you saying that merely turning it on every day or two should repressurize the nozzles and keep them from drying?
It would seem that the nozzle surface would need to be warmed up also to redissolve whatever was beginning to precipitate out.
Does powering it on also warm it up?
In the case of this poor Lexmark (which I bought on the recommendation of a widely-read computer magazine), the longer between uses, the more encrustation is visible on the nozzle surfact.
It would seem then that the rubber seal has lost its pliability, but the printer has been this way since the beginning, about 5 years ago, so either it was defective to begin with or this is a design defect, perhaps cost related.
