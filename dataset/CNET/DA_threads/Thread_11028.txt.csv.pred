1.1.1	I don't have a DVD-burner [never even bought a CD-burner (stop laughing!)]	St
1.1.2	but I'm planning to buy one & install it in my PC.	St
1.1.3	Someone told me to be careful of which make/manufacturer I buy because some are being made with Digital Rights Management technology built in.	St
1.1.4	This doesn't make sense to me.	St
1.1.5	What little I know about DRM makes it sound like software looking for...well, whatever it is that signals a copyrighted file.	St
1.1.6	Would the 'driver' file somehow stop working?	St
1.1.7	I'm not planning to steal movies, but after the Sony fiasco last year I don't want to trust corporate suits more than I have to.	St
1.1.8	Is there some feature or warning I should look for on the box to avoid 'Big Brother' DRM features built-in to the burner?	St
1.2.1	But there has been plenty of talk.	St
1.3.1	it wont happen.. unless they ALL DO IT at the same time... the first company that does it wont be bought from by the average people...	St
1.3.2	Consider how *Pistaed* the consumer is when there DVD/HD-DVD/Blueray player does not work.. or when you can't take a Microsoft/apple purchased music to other non approved players...	Ques
1.3.3	Imagine when they find out about the DRM in that how *PISTAED* they would be	St
1.4.1	Thats someone may have confused &quot;regional&quot; DVD play with DRM.	St
1.4.2	It basically means if you brought a DVD movie in Europe and then came to the states, you will prompted with a regional error message on a DVD player brought in the states.	St
1.4.3	There is supposablely at issue those DVD movies for HD used for Blu-ray or DVD-HD are touting HDCP, another name(IMHO) for DRM in HD.	St
1.4.4	Its still in the air, but its gets so confusing that it seems like it was meant to be that way.	St
1.4.5	None of this should apply to typical DVD players though, only HD.	St
1.4.6	tada -----Willy	St
