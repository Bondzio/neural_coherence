<s> Hi, I've currently got two desktops connected via a switch to an ADSL router, one running XP Home (P4 1.6) and one on XP Pro (P3 1.0). </s>
<s> We just bought a Toshiba A70 P4 laptop on XP Home, with wireless network capability. </s>
<s> At the same time the salesman suggested a Belkin wireless desktop PCI network card to fit to one of the desktops to act as the connection point for the laptop to the network. </s>
<s> I've set this up on the P3, and it says it is running at 11Mbps, and connection status says it is sending packets. </s>
<s> The laptop can find the home network via wireless and connection status also says it is sending packets. </s>
<s> Neither machine says it is receiving packets though and I'm not sure why. </s>
<s> I would have thought if the laptop can identify the network, then it should be able to communicate backwards and forwards between machine. </s>
<s> I have currently got WEP etc unselected as I read this could cause set up problems. </s>
<s> Any help would be much appreciated. </s>

<s> I've set this up on the P3, &quot; Sadly, I'm unfamiliar with this setup. </s>
<s> I'd call your saleperson and ask how to make it work. </s>
<s> Usually I just install a wifi router which the DSL/cable connects to and shares the internet to the rest of the machines. </s>
<s> best of luck, bob </s>
