1.3.1	yes, unless you have more than two ide headers, you will have to slave one.	St
1.3.2	it will not matter which one you slave, they will both work just the same.	St
1.3.3	i have two dvd burners.	St
1.3.4	the best way to do it, is the one that is closest to your motherboard becomes the slave (due to the master being on the end of the cable)	St
1.4.1	Thanks to both of you.	St
1.4.2	I already have the 2 HDD on one ribbon, will slave the older dvd to the new one.	St
1.4.3	Appreciate your advice.	St

1.5.1	sometimes it does matter.	St
1.5.2	Try CSL on both 1st.	St
1.5.3	If it works, fine.	St
1.5.4	If not, try each as master till setup works.	St
1.5.5	CSL is supposed to work with newer drives, but doesn't always.	St
1.5.6	I have had new drives that HAD to be Master/Slave switched and would only works as Master, not as Slave.	St
1.5.7	Hope this helps.	St
