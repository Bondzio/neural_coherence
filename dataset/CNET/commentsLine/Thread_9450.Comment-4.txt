yeah i bult the system myself.
i was thinking the same thing although the sysytem seems to be running smoothly over the past couple of days.
all i have been really doing is basic websurfing and watching movies which doesnt really put much load on the psu.
i might add that it is not overclocked at all.
everything is running on factory settings.
windows was a fresh install.
so the problem doesnt lie there.
i think stephen is right about the psu.
so i guess ill just get a new one and then put it through its paces and see how i go.
i was thinking of a 750w antec-earth they are supose to be real good on power consumption.
