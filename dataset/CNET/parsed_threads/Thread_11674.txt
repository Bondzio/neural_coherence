<s> Hi everyone, I bought a new WD HD 1T with SATA interface. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, my desktop is not modern and its motherboard doesn't have SATA port. </s>
<s> Could I install my new HD into my desktop and still keep the old one? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>

<s> There are some little 20 buck SATA to IDE converter boards on newegg.com and geeks.com. </s>
<s> These sometimes work. </s>
<s> If you can't stand experimenting then place the drive into some USB 2.0 enclosure. </s>

<s> with a BIOS supporting SATA drives &gt;137GBs....your old PC probably won't support 1TB drives ...even if you're OS supports it. </s>
<s> Not easy to find same at a reasonable price. </s>
