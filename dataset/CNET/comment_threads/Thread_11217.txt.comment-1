IMO Samsung ought to be boycotted.
Their products are so inferior, they inspired my below limericks.
They cost me hundreds in monetary loss, health loss, & aggravation.
Samsung & a zillion other far-eastern-based companies have terrible customer support to boot.
SAMSUNG ML-2510 PRINTER LIMERICK These printers cause lights to start blinking Their infernal noise sets hearts sinking Each warm-up takes AGES Then WHAM!
OUT SHOOT pages Can't someone be sued for poor thinking?
SAMSUNG SYNCMASTER-SERIES LCD's LIMERICK Samsung's LCDs made me ill, Epoxies outgassed like to kill!
Strong phosphors so silent They seemed quite non-violent...
Yet proved worse than some poisoned pill!
