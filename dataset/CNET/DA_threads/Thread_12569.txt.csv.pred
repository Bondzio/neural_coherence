1.1.1	I want to add more memory (256MB) to my DELL L500r, but am stuck because both 100 MHz and 133 MHz are shown in any catalog refences for this machine.	St
1.1.2	Een when I consult DELL on line, I get both options.	St
1.1.3	Are they interchangeable?	St
1.1.4	There sure seems to be a price difference.	St
1.2.1	If I look at Crucial.com, it takes PC100, so the faster memory should be fine.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	So which is faster?	St
1.3.2	100 MHz or 133 MHz?	St
1.3.3	And are they interchangeable?	St
1.3.4	What happens, for example, if I use 133 and the existing memory is 100?	St
1.3.5	Doesn't work or runs slower?	St
1.4.1	133 is faster but if you mix both speeds it will run at 100	St
