<s> I am looking to upgrade using a barebone as i have a lot of components i like already. </s>
<s> I know it'll be faster than my single core 3500 overclocked to single core 3800 speed. </s>
<s> What do people think of this 45w at load processor? </s>
<s> At stock, each core is 125 mhz faster than my current 3500 it meets GTA 4 minimum requirements. </s>
<s> I know the cache is only 512, but so is my single core 3500 is as well so i don't care about it. </s>
<s> What really attracts me to it is the price, power consumption that will take a big load off my 450w power supply, and if need be, overclocking room to my voltage. </s>
<s> My current ASUS AI over clocked processor voltage is 1.4 and it's been stable for 11 months. </s>
<s> The 4850e voltage is only 1.1-1.2 volts </s>
<s> it makes sense to me. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> My only question is what's the deal with AM2 RAM not running at full speed unless the CPU speed is exactly divisible by 400? </s>
<s> When i do overclock the CPU, i will do it so my DDR2 6400 memory runs at full speed. </s>
<s> I though it was called &quot;The Odd Multiplier Issue&quot; because it only effects multipliers when they are odd numbered (i.e. </s>
<s> 13x) so if you get an even numbered multiplier there are not the same problems. </s>
<s> http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2762&p=10 is a good 'quick and dirty' guide, here are some of the numbers... 200MHz Reference Clock * 12x Clock Multiplier = 2400MHz CPU Frequency 2400MHz CPU Frequency / 6 = 400MHz DDR2-800 Memory Frequency odd clock multiplier... 200MHz Reference Clock * 13x Clock Muliplier = 2600MHz CPU Frequency 2600MHz CPU Frequency / 6 = 433MHz DDR2-866 Memory Frequency 2600MHz CPU Frequency / 7 = 371MHz DDR2-742 Memory Frequency I very much doubt that anybody could tell the difference in everyday use without having to use bench numbers. </s>
