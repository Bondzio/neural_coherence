6391	2	151364	1685824	1685819	Raktus	1/20/06 9:10 AM	1.1377482E12	Thanks!	Do you think I should get a stronger power source? Ive posted the specs in the past, and someone mentioned I might need one.
6391	3	151364	1685838	1685824	yankees26	1/20/06 9:13 AM	1.13774838E12	couldnt find it in the specs	what power supply do you have i couldnt find it in the specs you listed
6391	4	151364	1685849	1685838	Raktus	1/20/06 9:19 AM	1.13774874E12	Well, it came with the case	Standard case mount TX MEDIUM TOWER CASE 350 WATT I have to ask you, since you seem to know what your doing, for 160 bucks, whats the best gaming videocard I should get?
6391	5	151364	1686119	1685849	yankees26	1/20/06 10:42 AM	1.13775372E12	well...	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814150096 it is currently priced at $179 at newegg and i now you asked for $160 but you'll want the 256MB (the other cards were 128MB) the 256MB will help also if you are willing to go up to the $210 area i would suggest http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143045 both cards i have posted have a minimum requirement of a 350 watt power supply (which you have although if the card doesnt work you might need to upgrade to 400 watts) also make sure you have a 4-pin molex connector (both require it need to be plugged into the card for power)
6391	6	151364	1686233	1686119	Raktus	1/20/06 11:19 AM	1.13775594E12	Well	Since they have none in stock and I cant get up to 210 (limits suck, lol)
