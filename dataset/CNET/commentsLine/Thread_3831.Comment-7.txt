we have this router in our house, connected to comcast, with a good 6-10 wireless routers in surrounding houses.
for a little while the router worked alright, but it's digressed to the point where its un-usable on most of my laptops unless you're within 5 feet of the unit.
when i try to load a page from the next room (10-15 feet away) the signal slowly fades from 160+mbps, with strong signal strength, down to 11, then disconnects from the network completely, even with a full strength signal.
the page times out, after which i can re-connect to the network at full strength and repeat the whole frustrating ordeal again... sigh.
interestingly, my netbook connects fine throughout the house.
not sure how that works out... im going to give this to one of my friends and get a netgear or linksys.
this unit has caused me endless hours of frustration.
