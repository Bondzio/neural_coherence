Is it worth the trouble to replace the HD with an SSD (I have a USB adapter to use to clone it) now that some 80GB -120GB SSDs are down to &lt;$110? This HD is partitioned with C: = ~80GB and D:= ~60GB-Used space = 1%(used space never grows for D:). What is this D; drive all about, recovery? It's awful big for that function. For the SSD (80GB for example) hoiw big should I make the D: drive?

That seems pretty large for a machine that has only consumed 27% of it's 82GB C: partition in 3 years. I'll check it out further though. That adaptive firmware sounds pretty cool.

Review at http://www.anandtech.com/show/5160/seagate-2nd-generation-momentus-xt-750gb-hybrid-hdd-review This is not so much about space but speed without as much of the worry. Bob

Is there any problem with XP home 32 bit addressing a 750GB HDD? I know there's a RAM address-ability limit of 4GB.

3089	8	563824	5316654	5316467	willivon4	5/29/12 12:06 PM	1.33829316E12	Yeah it's XP SP3	I stated that assuming some universality since the update to it has always been free. Does SP2 or SP 3 correct that HDD size problem? Might that be part of the reason for Asus establishing such a large D: partition on my Eee PC? What about physical drive size, can it be overcome via multi-partitioning?
3089	9	563824	5318165	5316654	R. Proffitt	6/2/12 3:34 PM	1.33865124E12	Not that I'm a historian	But the issue was first corrected in XP SP1 so you won't have to deal with that issue in any way at all. Bob

There is a third, hidden, and much smaller partition used for system recovery. You can use something like EASEUS Partition Manager to change the size and number of partitions on a drive.
