<s> Hi, I'm going to build my first PC this summer/fall. </s>
<s> I have a list of components, but I don't have a case and power supply. </s>
<s> Here's the list; does anyone have ideas for a case and power supply? </s>
<s> Motherboard: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?Submit=Suggested&Description=13-152 CPU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103535 Video Card: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102601 RAM: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145505 Sound Card: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16829102179 DVD Burner/Drive http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16827131264 Hard Drive (I own this already; that's why I didn't include it in the cost): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822144122 </s>
<s> Floppy Drive/ Media Card Reader: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16821104104 </s>
<s> I took a look at specs are new computer build and you may need to chg motherboard as graphics slot is agp and video card you want to get is pci-e x16 and you need a pci-e x16 slot which the motherboard doesn't have. </s>
<s> And that motherboard was socket 754; the CPU is a socket 939. </s>
<s> I was looking at the chaintech VNF4, but now newegg doesn't have it. </s>
<s> So here's another that I found; good? </s>
<s> Oh yeah; what about the case and power supply? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813128286 </s>
<s> Only built one but am happy with Antec case and power supply. </s>
<s> You want a spacious, but not overlarge case. </s>
<s> Do you want something flashy, or more elegant or a mix? </s>
<s> For a PSU, though it may be just a tad overkill: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817153029 This is my personal fav. </s>
<s> for a case with a power supply http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811144004 But you would be a little better off buying each component seperately as combos usually yield lower quality in one part or another. </s>
<s> This is my favorite case: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811133133 But these are just my choices. </s>
<s> Try this page for some good case ideas: http://www.newegg.com/ProductSort/SubCategory.asp?SubCategory=7 For the better quality cases, don't get a PSU, side windows always look cool, look for with CPU ducts on side or back, make sure there is enough room for expansion and current parts, and make sure it suits you! </s>
<s> On the motherboard, so are you going to AGP or using the x800 on PCI-e? </s>
<s> Do they make a x800, of that card, in AGP? </s>
<s> Wanting to clarify: IDE is P ATA, correct? </s>
<s> This is a wicked deal, if IDE is actually P ATA: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131530R Just my $.02 ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> First of all, thanks for all the advice. </s>
<s> I agree with you about that power supply, but it's a little overkill, and it's out of my budget . </s>
<s> Likewise with the case (which I just love, btw.) </s>
<s> I would like a quality case and 500W PSU, but I can't spend too much on them (I still need to buy windows and a monitor). </s>
<s> About the motherboard: I posted the wrong link; check my previous post for the right one (with a PCIe slot; I wouldn't got AGP, and the other motherboard was a socket 754.) </s>
<s> About the hard drive: My mom (I'm 14) purchased it to put in an old dell 4400. </s>
<s> But it didn't work, and now we it's just lying around. </s>
<s> I'm rather confused about the hard drives, though. </s>
<s> I know that SATA/II is the newest interface, and that IDE is older. </s>
<s> Will the hard drive work with the motherboard from my other post? </s>
<s> Once again, thank you for all your help. </s>
<s> -Nate </s>
<s> The 939 socket board you listed doesn't have a PCI X16 slot. </s>
<s> Do believe the hard drive will work on that board. </s>
<s> Just check the boards specs, PATA IDE/ATA 100/ xx/xx. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131569 Scroll down on that page for the specs. </s>
<s> Tom </s>
<s> Well, I can only find two motherboards, the first one with the 754 and the other was AGP 4x/8x. </s>
<s> Did I miss one? </s>
<s> (Lol, that case will be my case for my Dream PC, when and how I can make up $5,000 is still a mystery to me, though) Yeah, most all motherboards I found all support SATA and IDE/PATA. </s>
<s> So, the Hard drive that was supposed to go in the Dell will work. </s>
<s> That actually clears up a matter I was earlier confused about in another post. </s>
<s> I would say this case, which has a case w/ PSU, but at least it is Aspire. </s>
<s> The only thing is that it looks a little too[/i[ flashy, but thats just my opinion: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811144005 Currently, SATA3G is the best, then SATA||, then finally SATA, I think. </s>
<s> Of course there is SCSI, but we won't go into that. </s>
<s> hth ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> How 'bout this motherboard? </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131525 </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> don't forget to get a tube of arctic silver thermal compound if needed? </s>
<s> Also, since you don't list a monitor/keyboard/mouse/speakers/printer, then i assume you only need the computer and am looking for one that's around $1000? </s>
<s> If that's the case, suggest maybe a dual-core? </s>
<s> Unless you want to save for around $800 budget. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> I own a SiS Chipset, and I've had numerous problems with it, and drivers are not perfect. </s>
<s> Maybe I just have a bad board, just my $.02 ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> What kinds of problems, aside from the drivers, are you having with it? </s>
<s> What other mobo would you recommend? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
