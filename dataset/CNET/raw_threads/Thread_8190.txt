3549	0	333952	2998421	NR	jangus1	3/9/09 3:20 PM	1.236612E12	driver question	I have an old HP Compaq Presario Laptop (Sempron-CPU) which has an ATI Mobility Radeon express series 200 graphics card. XPHome SP-2. I have a driver dated Dec/2005 (8.202.0.0) for it, and is the latest, as far as I know. I have located an Newer &quot;AMD Catalyst&quot; driver, which indicates that their driver supports my Graphics card. Since ATI is AMD now, my guess is that it may be OK. I hate to guess about things like this, and am just inquiring here. Can anyone verify that the Catalyst drivers are OK with my old laptop ? Thanks

These are coming as the Catalyst suite or just the driver. I never get the full suite. What you'll want to do is read up on what's been fixed or what new features have been added that you'd find useful. If you're having no known video problems that have been addressed or find no features that are important to you, you're well enough along to leave things as they are. If you want to go ahead and install the new driver/software anyway, don't delete the old driver. Occasionally bugs are created as well as fixed.
