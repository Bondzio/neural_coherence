For others one would get a CD that has the motherboard drivers on it. For the Dell et al the drivers would be on the recovery CD [or the Recovery partition, if you didn't get or make a recovery CD]. Did you check in the BIOS, to see if the LAN was there to be enabled?? Also have you gone into device manager to see if it shows the LAN ?

There should also be a &quot;Network Connections&quot; or something about a network. If you have more than 1 ethernet device, you may need a router.
