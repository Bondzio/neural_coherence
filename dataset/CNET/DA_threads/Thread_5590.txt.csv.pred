1.1.1	Hello all ...	St
1.1.2	I got a 250gb maxtor internal drive that I put in a usb 2.0 external enclosure .	St
1.1.3	I set the jumper to Master , per the instructions that came with the enclosure .	St
1.1.4	I plan on only using it for file storage .	St
1.1.5	I was setting it up last night and the Computer recognized a new USB drive and I installed the drivers for it ( the drivers that came with the enclosure ) .	St
1.1.6	It did not show up in My Computer , which was predicted in the instructions .	St
1.1.7	Then I installed the software that came with the HD .	St
1.1.8	It found the HD and said that it was brand new and needed to be formatted .	St
1.1.9	That was around 10pm last night .	St
1.1.10	Around 9am this morning when I left for work it was still spinning .	St
1.1.11	The progress bar had n't moved ... Is it possible that it will take this long ?	Ques
1.1.12	Vital Stats : P3 700 mhz computer Windows 98SE Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	My USB 2.0 connected 160GB drive formatted in less than one hour .	St
1.2.2	But since you have a P3 , 99.99 % of P3s will have USB 1.1 .	St
1.2.3	Let me do a guess on time here .	St
1.2.4	I 'll state that 160GB completed in 1 hour on my p3-600 USB 2.0 connected drive .	St
1.2.5	If that was true and you connected via USB 1.1 ( likely !	St
1.2.6	) , then a straightforward bit of math shows ... USB 2.0 speed / USB 1.1 speed times 250 / 160 = hours Or ... 480 / 11 times 1.56 = 68.18 hours .	St
1.2.7	You 'll have to give it about 3 days .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	I do have a USB 2.0 card in the Computer ... . which makes it sound like something is not working properly .	St
1.3.2	thanks !	Polite
1.4.1	Should I have installed the drivers from the hard drive , or the drivers from the USB 2.0 External Enclosure ?	Ques
1.4.2	thanks !	Polite
1.5.1	1 .	St
1.5.2	The file system will only support 127GB ( or 137GB ) in total on that drive .	St
1.5.3	I do n't want to duplicate all that is known about this , so catch up about this at http : //www.48bitlba.com 2. http : //www.usbman.com notes the usual USB 2.0 issues .	St
1.5.4	But in a laptop it gets worse .	St
1.5.5	Very few can install Windows properly .	Sug
1.5.6	They 'll forget some motherboard or other driver .	St
1.5.7	Support is waning for this old OS , but by this time you should be an old hand at corraling the motherboard drivers , reading USBMAN and more .	St
1.5.8	This OS has n't been offered for 5 years so it 's not seen as much and ... people seem to be forgetting how it works .	St
1.5.9	Bob	St
