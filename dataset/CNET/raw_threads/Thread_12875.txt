One is wired ethernet (has a passworded proxy to get out to the internet, used for all local traffic) the other is wireless straight into an ADSL modem so unrestricted internet access. Currently everything is run through the ethernet solution and when I need un-firewalled access or am using an application that doesn't support the passworded proxy I switch over to the wireless but lose all local connectivity. Is there a way I can somehow route all of my local traffic in the 192.168.x.x range to the ethernet, and all the internet traffic (even certain applications) through the wireless connection? I would like to be able to work both locally as well as some apps on the unrestricted connection at once. Opening firewall ports or adding an exception to the proxy is not an option. I'm open to ideas on Vista as well though prefer XP. Cheers, M.
