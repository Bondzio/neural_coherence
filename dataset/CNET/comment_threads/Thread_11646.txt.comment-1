I decided to tidy up my house by providing rj45 sockets in each room with a desktop.
After setting up all the rj45 wall sockets, I connected them to a small switch and then the adsl router/modem.
Thats where my nightmare begun.
The desktops shows no sign when connected to the rj45 wall sockets but can connect when directly hooked up to the switch.
I have tried redoing the wiring on the rj45 wall sockets but it doesn't help.
This thing is driving me nuts.
Help me out guys before I loose my mind over this Cheers
