<s> I have a Compaq Presario V2135US that is acting bizarre... </s>
<s> When I boot to Windows XP or even the XP disc, my laptop will shortly thereafter shut off (within 30s or so) I boot using Ultimate Boot CD and ram MEMTEST and several other memory and hard disk diagnostic tools, but found no problems. </s>
<s> I have 2 sticks of 133mhz 256MB RAM. </s>
<s> If I remove EITHER of them and reboot, the system will work flawlessly and will not shut off. </s>
<s> I have tried both sticks of RAM separately in each slot, and either way the laptop will work as long as I only use one stick of RAM... so I'm pretty sure it's not related to the slots or the RAM itself. </s>
<s> Another thing I find interesting is with this problem... the laptop will actually turn off, rather than reboot... which is what happens sometimes when windows experiences a critical error. </s>
<s> If I try to boot to a Windows XP install disc I experience the same problem... around the time that the dialog box shows up asking me if I want to Repair or Install. </s>
<s> Thanks, any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> It maybe expercicing a hot spot and the ram just tips it over the edge and it shuts down. </s>
<s> Some laptops have a small int. </s>
<s> fan for the cpu which in turn it mounted to a heat plate, the fan helps cool the laptop. </s>
<s> if the fan fails, the heat plate still cools the cpu but it isn't as efficient, so you get into critial heat range and begin a shutdown. </s>
<s> The fan itself is quite, but a non-working is real quite and you won't know until too late. </s>
<s> If your has one, verify its operation. </s>
<s> You can use a &quot;laptop cooler&quot;, available at most office centers or shops and see if that helps. </s>
