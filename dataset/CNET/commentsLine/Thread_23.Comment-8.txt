ok, now i'm gettin flustered... i checked that all of the network sharing was working, and it was... kinda.
when i go to &quot;my network places&quot; i can see all shared folders in my netowork.
i can navigate through all folders, but when i try to access a file it gives me an error.
whether i'm trying to copy a file, play media, or run setup exe's from shared folders it always gives me some kind of access error.
when i look at my shared folders under &quot;my network places&quot; it shows them all under &quot;the internet&quot; instead of &quot;local network&quot;.
anyone have any idea why this is happening or how i can fix it?
fyi... i've already tried shutting off all firewalls, verified sharing is on in network connections, confirmed that all files are &quot;shared to the network&quot;, not just the pc, and i'm not sure if i can or how to kill the router firewall (but if i understand right the router shouldn't firewall networked computers from each other, no?)
