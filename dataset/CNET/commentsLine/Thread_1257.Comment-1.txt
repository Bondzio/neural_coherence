i recently was upgraded at work to windows 2000. i have a lexmark e238 pinter.
prior to upgrade, i was able to print documents with no problems.
since the upgrade, when printing saved documents in wordperfect 8, i get &quot;gibberish&quot; language - the characters look like playing card suits, and emoticons.
strangely i have no problems with documents i just type out and have not save.
i downloaded the updated driver for the printer.
this does not happen in any other programs.
is is possible for a communication problem with corel and lexmark?
or corel/lexmark/windows?
can any one help?
thank you for any assistance.
