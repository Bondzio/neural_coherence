1.1.1	I found a 2nd hand Etherfast Cable/DSL Router and want to try and hook it up.	St
1.1.2	It has an ethernet cable and power supply cord.	St
1.1.3	I has a 4-port switch.	St
1.1.4	What I have is a computer with DSL, and a box/modem with the first plugin for DSL, 2nd, usb, 3rd, ethernet, and 4th power.	St
1.1.5	The ethernet is plugged into the back of the tower.	St
1.1.6	I am wondering how to hook up the Linksys(where to plug it in)and also, it doesn't have a little antenna which I though all of these did.	St
1.1.7	I don't see anyplace where one might have been either?	St
1.1.8	Any help is appreciated.	St
1.1.9	I have Windows Vista SP2 and can give you further info if needed.	St
1.1.10	I want to be able to pick up the DSL signal from my laptop;) Denise	St
1.2.1	when the linksys is hooked up to the modem and pc, there is no internet connection.	St
1.2.2	The internet &quot;light&quot; is not coming on and when I try my browser it is not connected.	St
1.2.3	Can anyone tell me what I might try to fix this?	Sug
1.2.4	The lights are on on the router so it appears to be functioning properly.	St
1.2.5	I think these instructions, http://www.tech-faq.com/how-to-setup-a-linksys-router.html are correct but I can't get to the &quot;configure&quot; part where you go to the IP address online.	St
1.2.6	Can I configure that before I hook up the router maybe?	St
1.2.7	Thanks again for any help, Denise	St
1.3.1	Found out my Linksys router is the wrong kind.	St
1.3.2	Please close this thread;) ty, denise	St
