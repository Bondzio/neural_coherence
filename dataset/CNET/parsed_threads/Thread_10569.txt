<s> I have two hard drives in my HP, one with XP sp2, and the other drive has Linux Mandrake. </s>
<s> How do I remove Linux from the second drive (I'm pretty sure it's the slave) and free up that drive so I can use it for XP? </s>
<s> I'm not very computer savvy, so if you can help please don't get too technical on me! </s>
<s> Thanks very much. </s>
<s> IF you are truly a Dual Boot System, when you boot your system it will give you a choice of Mandrake or Other. </s>
<s> If this is the case and you do not want to reinstall XP and its gazillion updates. </s>
<s> Format the drive that contains Mandrake.You will still get the Option screen at start up, but will now have your former Linux drive available for XP. </s>
<s> If you presently do not get the option screen at start up. </s>
<s> Just reformat the drive with Mandrake installed. </s>
<s> If you are unfamiliar with formating a hard drive, click on help and check out formatting.It contains a very easy explanation of formatting and all the options. </s>
<s> If you really want to get rid of Linux the first thing to do is get hold of a win98 startup disk. </s>
<s> Insert into floppy drive and boot computer. </s>
<s> At the command prompt C:/ type in C:/fdisk /mbr. </s>
<s> This will get rid of the boot loader for linux and restore you windows loader, then type in exit at command prompt. </s>
<s> Remove floppy and reboot computer. </s>
<s> When windows has fully loaded left click on Start - All Programs - Administrative Tools - Computer Management - Then Disk Management in the window that opens showing you disks. </s>
<s> Right click on the drive that Linux was installed on and click on format. </s>
<s> You have now got rid of Linux. </s>
<s> Reboot your computer and the drive that was Linux should now be a blank drive ready for you to use. </s>
<s> This may seem very simplified but I have not done this for a while and I am writing this from memory. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
<s> Roxxxy, you have a very workable system now! </s>
<s> I'd recommend you simply learn to use the Linux system; it's not that different from Windows, and while Windows development is slowing down dramatically, Linux is exploding. </s>
<s> Also, I personally don't like the direction Windows is headed, with us users having less and less control over what our computers will do. </s>
<s> I didn't want &quot;Big Brother&quot; deciding what's best for me, and I certainly don't want Bill Gates to do it. </s>
<s> By its very nature, Linux has no CEO and very little government control. </s>
<s> Also: very little malware (virus etc) is being written for Linux, and I see a day coming soon when some virus cripples nearly all Windows computers. </s>
<s> That nearly did happen a few years back with the Blaster worm. </s>
