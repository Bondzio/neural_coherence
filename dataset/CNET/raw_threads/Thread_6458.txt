In the box it says &quot;the instruction at 0x00427259 referenced memory at 0x00000044. The memory could not be read&quot;. The ipod shows up in windows explorer but doesn't show up in my itunes so i cant sync my music to it. I have connected it to my other computer and that works but it does not have my music on it. What should i do?

In their case it was simple because we had the machine and it's make, model and then off to the internet for the drivers. Total time was 15 minutes. They were a little pissed about the 500 buck charge at other places. Bob PS. Your posts are not complete so no one can offer a detailed reply with a link to the drivers I suspect. Your choice here.
