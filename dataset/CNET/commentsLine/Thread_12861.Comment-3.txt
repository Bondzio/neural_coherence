you must set the jumpers one to slave and the other to master otherwise you will get nothing if you intend on keeping the 20 gig as your op drive leave it on master an set the 40 gig to slave ok of if you are setting the 40 gig as op drive do it the opesit way around u might have to reinstall your op sys
