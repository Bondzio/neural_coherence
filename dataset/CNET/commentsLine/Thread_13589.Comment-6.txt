does not list any transparency paper.
i found no support for this media for this printer.
your only hope is if you get lucky and find the old transparency stock with the full paper backing.
it's been a few years (1998?)
since i used that and i don't see it around anymore.
you can approximate what that stuff was by taping the leading edge to another sheet of paper.
