is the &quot;name&quot; of your connection...or so to speak.
it means &quot;service set identifier&quot; but you don't need to remember that.
you can see the name in your router's configuration while accessing the web interface and you can change it if you wish.
if your router is a linksys brand, the name will likely have that brand and model in the ssid.
when you do a search for wireless networks by clicking on the icon in the tray, you will be looking for that ssid and attempting to connect to it.
if you've enabled security and entered a key code or passphrase...whatever...., you will get a box asking for that code if the connection is found.
if you successfully enter the code and your ip addressing is handled as dhcp (meaning the router hands out the address), you may see a text box by the network icon saying it's &quot;acquiring&quot; the ip address.
if the address is given successfully, you're in.
but i have to think you've already seen this happen in the past.
now, one troubleshooting tip if you have no luck is to go back into the router and remove the security requirement temporarily to see if you can connect with an open system.
in fact, that's what i would have done first.
once you know a connection can be made that way, that's when it's time to secure it.
this sounds like it's been rough for you.
i'm no guru but have fought with a few network issues and found the best way to learn was to bang my against the problem and not give up.
if it was eventually solved, i learned something new and remembered it better than if someone gave the the answer.
no amount of time is ever wasted if you come away with new knowledge.
good luck.
