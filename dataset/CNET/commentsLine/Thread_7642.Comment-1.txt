i have been told that i can set up a wireless connection between my home tv and my pc (different parts of the house of course), thus enabling the lady wife to view projects which i have downloaded and can play thought the pc.
i could burn a dvd but this has not always proved possible, so this seems an answer.
wot i need to know is what attachments i require to accomplish this task.
all info very gratefully received particularly if it impresses the lady wife!!!
