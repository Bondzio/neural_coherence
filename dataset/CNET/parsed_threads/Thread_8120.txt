<s> I went to newegg and it seems all the rdram is way more expensive than all the other kinds. </s>
<s> Why is that? </s>
<s> It's most expensive because it's not widely produced and was expensive to begin with. </s>
<s> as only a few chipsets support it and it's actually lesser in performance than DDR PC 1600 in dual channel it's a rather old technology (think 2000-2001) </s>
<s> supposed to be the wave of the future but, just like VHS and Beta VCR's that changed. </s>
<s> So, rambus isn't widely produced and is more expensive because of it. </s>
