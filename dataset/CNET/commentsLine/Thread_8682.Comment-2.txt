hang in there.
today, you may see dell or hp trying to sell you (at a premium no less) some dvd+r/w or dvd-r/w drive.
since i can get an all format dvd+/- r/w drive that also can do cdr/w media with software for 99 bucks, then this is a solution that i'd consider.
as to the other drive, it's your choice what goes there.
cdrom drives are about free.
cdrw drives are seen in bulk at 10 to 20 bucks (no comments about quality...) so keep shopping and have fun.
