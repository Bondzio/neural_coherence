My other computers and Roku connect with no problem, but mine even though it says it is connected, is not connected. I have Windows XP the other computer is Vista and the desktop is also XP. Even AT&T came over the house and said something is wrong with the computer. Can anybody help me.

In that case, it looks different from how it normally looks when there is a full connection? Two related things to check: 1. Does the router management page show it as connected? What IP-address? 2. What does ipconfig (run it from the command prompt) exactly say about the IP-address of the PC, the gateway and the DNS? Kees

Only keep the networks you need in the right sequence. XP comes with a standard program for that. However, quite a few makers add their own on top or as a replacement. So I can't tell you how it works on your PC. Kees

A blue screen I can't get passed when the computer starts up. It will not even let me go into the safe mode. Now I am really. What would cause this happen? I never seen a computer with so much problems. My others are HP's and even though they are not perfect they are next to this. Help.

Now I have to figure out how to get this computer to connect to my network. It is brand new and I cannot even find the wireless connection

And you mentioned something about using a Dell disc to load the OS to an HP CD. So you should mention much more detail on what exactly you did. Maybe better start a new thread in Computer Help, because clearly this is - as you already stated yourself - a new problem. Kees

I have a network 1394 for high speed and Lan. I went to Hardware devices and that is the only thing I see for network devices. I have three other discs. One is for the Web cam one if for Cyberlink and one is drivers. But this is something I noticed late last night before I was ready to throw the computer against the wall. It seems like the power cord is connected to the problem. Could that be possible? I noticed that if I moved the laptop just a inch the wireless light came on for a second and if I took the cord out the screen got lighter not darker. I cannot hold the cord in the in place to keep the wireless light on. But I could see the wireless lights and the other lights on the side of the computer go off and on. My original cord went kaput and I got a new one, not a dell one, but from Amazon, which stated the cord was compatible. It seemed to work fine. This problem with the wireless is new. This computer is not my main computer but one I let my roommate use. He has been having a hard time getting on the internet, this is what started this whole thing. But I think it now is because something is up with the power cord. Also when the blue screen came on it said it could be because a loss of power. It seems the cord is ok just to turn the computer on and to charge it but it has to be moved around for the wireless light to come on. Could that be it?
