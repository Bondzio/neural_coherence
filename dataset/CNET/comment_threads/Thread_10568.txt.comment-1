Hello Friends, I have a problem which I want to discuss with you, I had to find out answer of a question: Are these wireless networks capable enough to completely replace wired networks in future.
I have goggled it and come to a conclusion NO as they have serious setbacks related to speed security etc.
Whats your opinion??
?
