I am looking for IBM compatible PS2 type keyboard that uses 120mA power consumtion or less. What is exactly is that type of keyboard. I looked online to see if I could find one but nothing lists the power consumption. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.

I will tell you what I am using it for, I have to enter disc info on my mega DVD player and it requires that type of keyboard I already have one for my computer and it doesn't work. Let me ask you would the ones without all of the multimedia buttons be a good start to check?

518	4	248218	2490138	2490109	MARBLEANN	5/18/07 9:24 AM	1.17948024E12	Sorry	Sorry but I thought I mentioned that because the keyboard that didn't work with my new Sony DVD player worked with my older Sony cd player and they both specified the same keyboard. I was confused about that. It was a important point. A pre senior moment on my part.
