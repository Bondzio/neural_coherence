My computer is an XP, with a P4 2.8, 1 gig of RAM, 2 drives, 1 hard drive, and a Nvidia FX 5700 LE video card with 128 MB of memory. I want to update my video card, primarly to run Oblivion on less than &quot;low&quot; settings with no extremely low frame-rates. I currently have a 250 watt power supply. I want to know if anyone can recommend a video card that meets my criteria, and is hopefully below $200. I would also like to know if, should I upgrade to that card, if I would need to upgrade my power supply, and if so, to what. Note: When examining the insides of my PC, I saw that above the AGP card slot, it said AGP slot, and also said 1.5v only. If anyone knows what this means, please share. Thanks!

You should get a larger power supply than 350 watts. If you are playing those big high tech games get a big video card you will not be disapointed. You will notice a big difference in performance. Check out the links bellow they will give you and Idea on a Video Card and a power supply, there are many.
