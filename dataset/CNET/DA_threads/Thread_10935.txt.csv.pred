1.2.1	Many of the proprietaties such as HP, Dell etc get their mobos from mainline vendors, however the vendor cannot provide info related to the mobo because by contract it is now proprietary to the computer maker.	St
1.2.2	Check the mobo mfr's site for a mobo very similar, same basic chipsets and other chips.	St
1.2.3	The drivers will very likely be the same so use that one's drivers.	St
1.3.1	without needing the resource disc.	St
1.3.2	and life goes on... Jack	St
1.4.1	This system was made by a individual who is no longer available for contact.	St

1.9.1	There was no mention of needing video or audio drivers in original post..so it was not covered.	St
1.9.2	If you need new drivers for such, go to manufacturer for them.	St
1.9.3	Which is what should be done regardless of who originally supplied them.	St
1.9.4	and life goes on.... Jack	St
1.10.1	My suggestion is contact Biostar Support.	Sug
1.10.2	If they answer, maybe they can point you to the right drivers.	St
1.10.3	Could be they are old enough to be dropped from the listing, but still available.	St
1.10.4	*This comes up if you choose the mini-pc listed as using the M7NBA motherboard.	St
1.10.5	Good luck.	St
