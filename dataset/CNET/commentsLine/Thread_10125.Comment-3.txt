i dont like how you said keep it on the floor, i know this keeps it away from dust but it is actually cooler on the ground, also some of us have huge towers and crappy desks that cant support it.
personally, i would not keep my side cover off.
as this will disrupt your airflow as the side of the case acts as a &quot;duct&quot; so that it allows airflow through any air slits and such.
leaving the case door off also allows even more dust to enter and exposes the fragile components to harm, e.g.
pets, kids, etc.
just not a good idea konny
