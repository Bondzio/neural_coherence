7104	2	321067	2931572	2931304	ramarc	12/19/08 8:13 AM	1.22967438E12	a bit unbalanced	a $50 keyboard/mouse with a $66 cpu on a $130 motherboard. consider a biostar tforce 8200 mobo for $90, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138113 microsoft wireless desktop 4000 includes a laser mouse for $20 less. use the $60 savings to upgrade elsewhere. at least get an x2 6000+ since it's only $10 more. use the remaining $50 on this 20&quot; monitor for $140: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824112013 an antec basiq 500u power supply is the same price as your selection but a better brand. this bfg 9800gtx is a smidge faster than your video card selection but $20 cheaper. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814143137 this bfg 9800gtx+ is faster still and the same price as your card. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814143166

You can choose almost any combination of components and see the effect on pricing. Then you'll know if you should build it yourself or let them do it. It also shows you what components work well together. http://www.cyberpowerpc.com/r08/ri08.asp
