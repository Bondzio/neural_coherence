Access Point 400mW Amplifier 1 Watt =1.4 Watt or only 1 Watt? If I make a wireless bridge with 2 Engenius EOC-3220 EXT APs, 1 Watt booster on both APs, and 24db grid antennas. Will that bridge work for a distance of 10-14 km? Have a good line of sight. Thanks

Through the years I have often been glad to have you answer my questions. I hope you get paid! Concerning the WLAN, how strong can a Wireless Network be to be withing the regulations of the USA? I am not in the US, but still would like to know to have an idea, and maybe use them here too. Would you consider taking the amplifiers out of the plan for this network? (Would it be a waste of money?)

Remember that we'd hand make the antennas in our shop (we are engineers) so that's a zero cost item. In the US if you interfere with others then the costs can be so high that you &quot;don't want to know.&quot; So what you noted is not done in populated areas and I must decline citing US regulations. Let me try this again. No one will tell you it will or will not work but I can give you the one important nugget and that you want to run it at 802.11b speed. Bob
