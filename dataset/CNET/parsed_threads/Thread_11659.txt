<s> Specs: Old Mobo: PC CHIPS m811 v3.1 New Mobo: PC CHIPS M863G Old GPU: nVidia GeForce 5500 FX New GPU: Radeon 9550 Proc: AMD Athlon XP 2400+ RAM: Kingston DDR400 512MB Plus a Lite-On CD/DVD drive and another ATAPI DVD drive So, as soon as I reinstalled Windows (didn't format, just did a fresh install), updated my drivers and ran Windows Update a hundred times, my system is running noticably slower than it was before. </s>
<s> The first thing I noticed was that my BIOS was reporting that I was using an Athlon 1800, or something, which was fixed when I adjusted the CPU Frequency to 133 in the BIOS. </s>
<s> This was after I tried adjusting it to 166, where my system wouldn't start up and required me to clear the CMOS. </s>
<s> The DRAM Clock is set to automatically by the BIOS, which is 200MHz. </s>
<s> The DRAM CAS# Latency is set to automatic, because I don't have any idea what it does. </s>
<s> The slowdown is especially noticable when I'm running games, where the FPS were 40 to 50, are now like 10 and 15. </s>
<s> I've also been getting &lt;i&gt;blasted&lt;/i&gt; by random, like, sound bursts of static. </s>
<s> It's very painful. </s>
<s> So am I forgetting something? </s>
<s> Should I try formatting? </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Oh, this is definitely important. </s>
<s> My CPU is reporting to be running at 2GHz, but I'm certain that before it was running at ~2.4. </s>
<s> Also, the key difference between the 2 motherboards is that the new one runs at FSB 333, the other one was FSB 266. </s>
<s> Which version of the M863G did you get? </s>
<s> The 5v or 3v. </s>
<s> And did you make sure all the new parts are speced right. </s>
<s> I noticed you did not use the recommended memory. </s>
<s> Although it might work you still can't guarantee it's even running at 333. </s>
<s> Messing with bus speeds is OK as long as you KNOW what you are doing. </s>
<s> Personally, I wouldn't even use your setup for gaming. </s>
<s> I'd be using a 800fsb with the CPU to match and the dual-channel memory. </s>
<s> But, I can understand if you are constrained by the pocket book. </s>
<s> So, as long as you are not using what was recommended I can't help you. </s>
<s> Check those things out. </s>
<s> Maybe you'll find you mismatched some things. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> I didn't see any indication of recommended memory anywhere, and, again, though my previous motherboard wasn't as good, it ran on the same RAM without a hitch. </s>
<s> But what would you suggest I do? </s>
<s> Find RAM running at 333? </s>
<s> I'm having a very hard time understanding why my previous set up worked better than this one. </s>
<s> The performance is just as bad when I'm not running any big apps. </s>
<s> Cursor lag, window lag, it's very disturbing, and it is absolutely boggling my mind. </s>
<s> V5, by the way. </s>
<s> The DDR400 memory will work but only at 333mhz because the fsb is only 333. </s>
<s> Let's look at your performance (lack of) issues. </s>
<s> What do you use for anti-virus/spyware/adware/malware and registry cleaner software? </s>
<s> If you haven't done any of that you need to. </s>
<s> Sounds like you may have picked up a virus/trojan/spyware somewhere. </s>
<s> There are plenty of good free ones around. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> You must have messed up. </s>
<s> Did you set AGP settings correctly? </s>
<s> Are you using ATI drivers instead of nVIDIA? </s>
