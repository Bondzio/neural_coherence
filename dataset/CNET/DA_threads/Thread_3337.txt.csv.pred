1.1.1	I have an old 486 laptop that would make a great clock , but I do n't know what the effects of leaving the lcd running night and day for months or even years would have on it .	St
1.1.2	Would that destroy it , or harm it at all ?	Ques
1.2.1	A common misconception about MTBF is that it means that some product may last that long .	St
1.2.2	Actually , the definition ( my rewrite ) is that on average ALL the devices will have a failure or have failed by that number of hours .	St
1.2.3	Some may expire early , later or even never .	St
1.2.4	Not knowing the LCD in question , a whack at GOOGLE shows this : http : //www.google.com/search ? & q=LCD+MTBF Being thoroughly a whack at the numbers , we see on the first page from 10,000 to 50,000 hours .	St
1.2.5	It 's not a bell curve on the failure profiles , but usually a BATHTUB shape , but for this discussion I 'm going to use the midpoints as the average time your unit will fail .	St
1.2.6	STATEMENT - & gt ; Your LCD will fail from 5,000 hours to 25,000 hours in continuous usage .	St
1.2.7	Or 208 days to 1,041 days or from 0.57 years to 2.85 years .	St
1.2.8	To extend this time , simply reducing the brightness could easily double this number .	St
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	Is it true that the number of hours to be expected are decreased by continuous usage , or does the total ontime life of the unit ( lcd ) remain the same whether it is used constantly or not .	St
1.4.1	It 's an average time before failure .	St
1.4.2	It 's a tough idea to grasp that all units in the group will fail as the 10,000 hours is reached .	St
1.4.3	The idea is simple .	St
1.4.4	The usage pattern will of course help and I noted this .	St
1.4.5	MBTF = Mean Time Between Failures .	St
1.4.6	Or on average a failure is expected ( all units ) on average at this time span .	St
1.4.7	I will not define MTBF futher , but will let you research reliability and MTBF on Googgle .	St
1.4.8	I supplied a simplified example of how many hours you might expect from such usage .	St
1.4.9	Without knowing the exact make/model and its MTBF , the method I used has been more accurate in predicting the lifespan that I care to elaborate .	St
