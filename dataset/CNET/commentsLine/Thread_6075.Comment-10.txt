i use the same mtrbd.
i can only suggest you reduce the system to bare minmium, disconnect *all* drives.
reboot and see what happens.
if still no go, shutdown.
remove cpu, and it starts to beep, then you have a bad cpu.
you can also before removing cpu, take all ram out and see if it beeps.
if it beeps, then bad ram or slots.
if you didn't experience any bad power recently, then it died of old age and/or stressed componets.
yeah, you an older mtrbd., the replacement should have eide(pata) ports instead of sata and support ddr ram(plain).
there are still many a mtrbd.
out there, check with  or  and/or any other online vendor.
