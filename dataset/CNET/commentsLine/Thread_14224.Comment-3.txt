here are options that i have found... #1-pc diagnostics company (  ) micro2000 (  ) pc certify (  ) pc doctor (  ) windsor technologies (  ) ultra-x (  ) i have yet to find any freeware in this utility arena.
much comes with trial / demo versions, which allow you to perform some tests though limited.
i'm still researching.
any thoughts and references to these and other similar products would be awesome.
thanks in advance, jody wood
