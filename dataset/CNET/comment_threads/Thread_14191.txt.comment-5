i was running a 350w that came with the antec case.
i picked up the 300 cheap to see if the PS was the problem.
my concern now is where to find a 450w supply.
i've sort of hit the bottom of my bank account on this project and i dont want to buy anything else th at wont fix it.
i mean if this is the problem, i have enough to setup 2 pcs once i pick up another power supply or 2
