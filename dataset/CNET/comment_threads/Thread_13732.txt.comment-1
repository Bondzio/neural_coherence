I want to build my computer for the first time.
I have done a good amount of research on what GPU's and CPU's are good for gaming.
I want this machine to last me at least 5 years.
I was wondering what you guys think of this build and if there are any changes you think I should make to it, or anything I may be missing.
Thanks ahead of time!
