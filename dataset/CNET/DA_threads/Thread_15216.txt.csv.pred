1.1.1	I just upgraded to Verizon 's MiFi 2200 because I was tired of having to wrestle my partner for the single use USB modem I used to have .	St
1.1.2	The problem was that neither of our desktop computers had wireless capability so I went out and purchased two Belkin wireless G 7050 adapters .	St
1.1.3	After installing the drivers I found that both computers would connect , then disconnect and would or would not reconnect when hitting the repair option for the network icon .	St
1.1.4	I decided to try using my laptop , which has a built in wireless device , to see if it was the Belkin adapter .	St
1.1.5	I learned that if only one of the Belkin adaptors is in use , everything works find .	St
1.1.6	So , the laptop and one desktop can be on line , but not the two desktops at the same time .	St
1.1.7	I wrote Belkin about this but have yet to hear back .	St
1.1.8	Does anyone have an idea as to why the MiFi will not connect through two Belkin adapters at the same time ?	Ques
1.1.9	Any suggestions would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Could be the usual settings like WEP ( busted ! )	St
1.2.2	or other things but I could n't find such detail in your post .	St
1.2.3	Try http : //forums.cnet.com/networking-and-wireless-forum/ ? tag=forum-w ; forums06 and how we ask for wifi to be setup .	St
1.2.4	If it still drops maybe it 's defective , not charged , etc .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I gave up on getting the Belkin wireless adapters to work and bought two Zonet wireles PCI adapters .	St
1.3.2	They worked perfectly from the installation .	St
1.3.3	BTW , I returned the Belkin wireless duds to Best Buy , 25 days after pruchase , and they gave me my money back !	St
1.3.4	Way to go Geek Squad !	St
