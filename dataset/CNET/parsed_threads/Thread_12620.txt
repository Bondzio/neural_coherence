<s> I just purchased a sony 710ul I have an HP laptop 2.3 p4 40 gig hard drive. </s>
<s> I have an internal 4x burner but I wanted something faster. </s>
<s> I have installed the drive but I am not getting any speed faster then what my internal drive was providing. </s>
<s> I have updated the firmware from sony's website but I still have the same problems, Any suggestions, is there something I can do to check and make sure my computer has what I need to support the drive? </s>
<s> Since 99.99% of CDRW media is 4X, it's likely why its at 4X in spite of your upgrades. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am using dvd media and it is 8x and 16x so I am not sure what you mean </s>
