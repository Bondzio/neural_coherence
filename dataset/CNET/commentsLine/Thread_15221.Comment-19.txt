told you, it was the motherboard, prepare to call microsoft because the hard drive will not get along with the new motherboard, at least that was what happened to me and everything was save on windows old but had to reinstall windows again.
if it works for you and don't have to reinstall windows again let me know how you did it so that i can learn.
thanks, bruno
