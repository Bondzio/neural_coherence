<s> Hi, I recently found myself perfectly able to connect to the campus network (can ping other computers, can be pinged by other computers), but the network was intentionally denying internet connection to my MAC address. </s>
<s> I tried to go to device manager and change &quot;locally administrated address&quot;, but ipconfig /all returns the same thing. </s>
<s> I went into the registry and changed HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\0007\Network Address, but ipconfig /all returns the same thing. </s>
<s> I have already tried disabling and reenabling under Device Manager, but no effect. </s>
<s> Rebooting makes no difference. </s>
<s> How do I get around to spoofing the MAC address? </s>
<s> Help would really be appreciated =) Louie </s>
<s> Sorry but if you check the forum policies we can't discuss how to gain access to networks that have been secured. </s>
<s> You need to ask the IT staff to add your MAC to the list. </s>
<s> It's that simple. </s>
<s> Sorry but we can't help you spoof your way onto that network. </s>
