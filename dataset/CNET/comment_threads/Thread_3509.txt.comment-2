the drive is partitioned and formatted.
If you're using FAT32 on the system, you'll experience what you're seeing.
There are file size limits as well as folder limits.
You said the external drive is virus &quot;affected&quot; but I'm not sure what that means.
An external drive cannot run virus code on its own.
It can contain files with virus code if that's what you mean.
It can also have damaged files so maybe you can explain the symptoms that led to your conclusion.
In any event, you might be able to copy the files to another external drive rather than to your PC drive if you can come up with such.
As well, your Ubuntu might be able to burn files to either an image or to DVD if it will allow disk swapping.
