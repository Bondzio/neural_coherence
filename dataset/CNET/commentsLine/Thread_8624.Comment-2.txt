why?
1. amd processors and better selection of hardware 2. regular hardware (some dell hardware is proprietary i.e power supplies, $$$$ to replace) 3. you can buy them in retail stores 4. retail store support (staples, bestbuy, circuitcity, etc.
are authorized dealers and repair centers, warranty work can be done there) 5. and the dell printers that they throw in for free, you can't find the ink anywhere... and for some comments on dell, just search &quot;dell&quot; in these forums and see what you get.
