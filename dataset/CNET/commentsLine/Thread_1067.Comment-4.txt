i worked for 35 years in the business world is why i am married to windows.
i don't wan't itunes to touch my music.
first off, i don't like popular music.
i download mp3s from amazon, mostly listen on my pc playing thru my stereo.
i have tons of copied music from old audiotapes and new cds.
i listen on my zune to music and audiobooks - a few videos.
i read books on my kindle.
the only things i would like on an ipad which are on my desktop are email, pictures, documents, writing program, games.
if i had an ipad, could i e-mail myself stuff (using house wifi) without a need for itunes installed on my desktop or laptop?
does an ipad come with an email program?
i admit total ignorance of this new medium.
