well i had read an article that stated that ibm was beginning to put cell chips in high end servers, non embeded.
so i figured someone might know if they were available yet.
this was the reason for my posting.
sbc is not an option for me because it limits the design of my syswtem, in ways which would take to long to explain.
as for actually buying a ps3, i don't want one, i don't want to use the console as a pc and i am an xbox fan and very satisfied with my 360. besides the ps3 to me says game console not computer, it may for other just not for me, i prefer to build my machines.
and like you said a dev kit costs thousands of dollars.
therefore my question was answered the processor is not available, and i will stay within the x86-64 world.
no other power risc processor impresses me.
thanks bob
