1.1.1	I 've been shopping around for a gaming machine for a few weeks now and I 've almost settled on Digital Storm to build my first true gaming rig however the more I look at the benefits of building my own PC the more tempting it becomes .	St
1.1.2	There 's a few things holding me back , among them are how to troubleshoot ?	Ques
1.1.3	How to avoid compatability issues .	St
1.1.4	Fear factor ( BIOS scares me a little ) .	St
1.1.5	No tech support .	St
1.1.6	Did I spend my money in the right places ?	Ques
1.1.7	I have a budget of $ 2000- $ 2500 for this so I know the savings of building my own will be very significant however that warm fuzzy feeling of warranties and tech support will be gone .	St
1.1.8	I do like that I 'll be getting educated as I go but fear the pain and frustration that education may cause ( not to mention money ) so I guess after all my rambling my question is ... Will that education , pain and suffering ( assuming Murphy 's law is in full effect ) end up as a rewarding and satisfactory experience or should I play it safe ?	Ques
1.2.1	Yeah , get some good education , you wo n't regret it .	St
1.2.2	I 've built three computers and when/if something goes wrong with them , I enjoy fixing the problem ( because I know what is in the computer and how it is put together ) ; and I 've had absolutely zero regrets about building my own computer , I 'll NEVER go back to a pre-built piece of crap .	St
1.2.3	You just ca n't get past the quality of a homemade machine ( so to speak ) .	St
1.2.4	With warranties and stuff wherever you buy your components , it should come with its own warranty ; and you 're your own tech support .	St

1.2.6	P.S .	St
1.2.7	Do n't worry about BIOS ' , because you just should n't upgrade BIOS ' , you 'll have to build a whole new computer before you 'll want to do that .	St

1.3.2	For 2k you can build a pretty decent system and then you KNOW what you have .	St
1.3.3	It is not hard to do , by the time you get done you will be surprised at the result .	St
1.3.4	For 2k ( or less ) you can build a slick system , far superior to what you can buy retail , unless you spend a ton of money and go to Alienware .	St

1.3.6	Good luck ! !	St

1.4.2	you could build a core i7 , but i would n't recommend it for a first-time builder since the mobos are still a bit finicky .	St
