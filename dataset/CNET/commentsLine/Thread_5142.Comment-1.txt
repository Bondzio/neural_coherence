i have an hp pavilion computer with windows me operating system.
it is connected to an hp deskjet 932c printer.
for a while now, when i print in color, i find that i get pink and black, but no blue and yellow.
i uninstalled and then reinstalled the printer.
i used the toolbox to clean the cartridges and recalibrate the printer.
since this has happened with two cartridges, bought at separate times, i don't think it's a cartridge problem.
i have also cleaned the surfaces around the cartridge with a damp rag.
nothing has worked thus far.
any suggestions would be most appreciated.
