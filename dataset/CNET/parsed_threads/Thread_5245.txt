<s> Hi, Just got a new game for my dinosaur-age computer. </s>
<s> No really, I have a PCI gpu. </s>
<s> My game requires a Nvidia GeForce 8600. </s>
<s> Looking onlince, I see a multitude of 8400s, but no 8600s. </s>
<s> I have a couple questions to ask: 1) Would it likely work with a 8400? </s>
<s> I would not want to waste my time and money. </s>
<s> 2) Are the PCI's extinct? </s>
<s> Would it save me money in the long run to get a new mobo that works with PCIe cards? </s>
<s> Thank you for the time, I would really appreciate your help, W|R </s>
<s> That the sales are very low for such cards so it's a vicious cycle of less and less choices. </s>
<s> Let's find that 9500 card. </s>

<s> it is even worth my while to buy a PCI graphics card? </s>
<s> In the end, will I have to buy a new mobo and gpu after all? </s>
<s> W|R </s>
<s> I have the slightly better 9500 video card and while it enables game play on the old box, it's not for those that want full effects and all the eye candy but the game does run. </s>
<s> Your choice when it comes to this area. </s>
