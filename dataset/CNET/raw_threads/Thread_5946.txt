Hi, with the help of someone on this site as well as a few other people I have recently purchased a new desktop pc. I have not purchased a monitor yet and I don't really know much about them. I have narrowed down the monitors I want to 2 choices. This is the first monitor. This is the second monitor. They are nearly an identical price so I am not worried about that part. I just need to know which one is better. Also if someone knows of a better monitor to get for around $200CAD or less please let me know. (keep in mind I am from Canada) If you are interested, here is the computer the monitor will be hooked up to. Thank you in advance for anyone that can help me with this.

Please try again with a better link (no quotes in it) and - before posting - try on the preview page if they really work. Also tell what you want to use the monitor for. For example: gaming, viewing HD video, office work, graphic design etc. Kees
