<s> I know that tons of people ask these questions, and that in the end it's my decision. </s>
<s> But I'm still looking for advice: I am looking to spend $200 - $250. </s>
<s> I was going to get a kindle fire hd but was concerned about lack of sd slot plus it's a little bigger than some other 7 inchers, and it's a forked version of Android, so less flexibility, etc. </s>
<s> Nexus 7 has got good reviews but no sd slot and minimal speaker (I wold have to use it's bluetooth for external speaker or headphones). </s>
<s> novo 7 flame seems to have everything I want including decent display but I am concerned about build quality, the company's reliability, etc. </s>
<s> and, even though it's not a nexus, can it use Google Now? </s>
<s> You can see I'm all over the place with this decision. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If Ainol or the sellers can't answer this one question, this is your tip off that support is non-existant and you are buying another disposable tablet. </s>
<s> I'll have my Nexus 7 in hand later today and the KF HD 7 is already in the office if you want me to check something on that one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> How is the response of the kindle fire hd to touch? </s>
<s> Is it pretty responsive? </s>
<s> How is other navigation - choppy or fairly smooth? </s>
<s> And, it is wider than the nexus 7, correct? </s>
<s> Is it also longer? </s>
<s> Is that difference noticeable? </s>
<s> do you think that Amazon will be providing updates to the OS, so that even if it is never the same as Google's (for example, it is a forked version of ice cream sandwich right now), as opposed to Jellybean on nexus or Ainol. </s>
<s> If I can sideload through my pc mp4s and mp3s, and access docs through an app like filespro, box or airsharing, and use other apps like splashtop and Picassa like i do currnelty on ipad, I might ber happy with fire hd. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Since I can't find anything broken in the OS, why do we need updates? </s>
<s> Sorry but I gotta ask. </s>
<s> If you want me to check something specific such as sideloading, I can do that. </s>
<s> I will not root this KF HD since it's the office model we use to test our apps. </s>
<s> But it appears we can load apps under development so there are other ways other than the Kindle store. </s>
<s> I have to stop here because I'd be duplicating the web. </s>
<s> There are folk wanting to use these in place of a PC so the KF may come up short as many web sites don't work. </s>
<s> Like the video at Yahoo Finance. </s>
<s> CNET Videos are fine since they know to support tablets. </s>
<s> Bob Bob </s>
<s> The Nexus finally came close to the PC browsing as I've seen. </s>
<s> But to get the usual sites to work I had to install the Firefox Beta for Android and Flash from an Android forum after I checked off the security box to allow such. </s>
<s> Very strange to see what is the leading edge Android tablet to require us to do that today but at least it passed our tests for our apps. </s>

<s> Ainol has come a long way as a tablet maker - their most recent models have stood out as good products, however, they are less known outside of Asia -- The brand new Novo 7 Legend is a 7&quot; $99 tablet with an amazingly good number of features and quality processor and screen. </s>
<s> The Novo 10 Hero is 10&quot; tablet that really impresses and also was just released this week and offers the same 1280x800 IPS screen as the Flame and the Flame's strong processor. </s>
<s> As for the Flame - overall it is a great tablet - the screen is super nice and the 5-pt Multi-touch is a lot better than the Nexus 7 (Not Sure Why???) </s>
<s> but when you zoon in and out on na image - the Flame is much more fluid and non-dragging, -- for some reason the Nexus 7 has a slight drag with the image a bit. </s>
<s> One of the first resellers in the U.S. that seems to carry both of these models is a site called TabletSprint.-- they also offfer a few 3G Android tablets as well -- </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I too am looking into the chinese tablet market for 7 inch tablets Hyundai t7s has hdmi (IMPORTANT), 1280x800 16 gb, sd slot, 5mb camera, etc etc. </s>
<s> Supports android 4.2 And the Novo Flame is on my list too. </s>
<s> Both about $180 with shipping. </s>
<s> I wanted to get the nexus 7 but it has no hdmi. </s>
<s> and Kindle Fire HD....bit bulky and not as fast and no camera anywhere. </s>
<s> unfortunately these cheaper chinese models have more quirks in their models, and im scared of lack of support. </s>
<s> Where did you read it didn't? </s>

<s> He the chinees got some wikked gadgets,, but they are all build to break,,why is that... </s>
