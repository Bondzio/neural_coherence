hi bob, thanks for your response.
it's not the monitor or the video card.
i did try another monitor just for the heck of it and there was no change.
but the problem is not simply that i'm not getting a display.
the problem is that the pc does not appear to be booting at all.
it has power, but there is no startup activity; no beeps; no flashing lights on the keyboard; no sound of activity on the hard drive or floppy drive, etc.
i was just wondering if this was specifically indicitave of anything obvious, such as a bad motherboard.
the only thing i've tried so far was removing the memory chip and disconnecting the hard drive (no difference).
thanks.
regards, --- gary
