Because of the 10 user limit and the need to accommodate more students at once, we went to a Windows XP embedded NAS drive that allowed 25 simultaneous users.
These devices, however, cannot be used like PCs.
They don't run software or third party utilities.
The one we got has remote administration capability and can be set up for remote ftp or http access over the web.
It also resides in a relay rack.
