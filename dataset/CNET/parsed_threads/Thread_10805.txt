<s> i have intel(r) 845 chipset & my o/s is xp home. </s>
<s> how do i do a reset? </s>
<s> Your post lacks any details as to what problem you want to resolve. </s>
<s> Chipsets are not reset. </s>
<s> More info is needed. </s>
<s> Maybe you are confusing with a BIOS reset. </s>
<s> If you have the mobo book, it'll tell you how. </s>
<s> Else, open the computer, pull out the button battery (you can't miss it - you may only damage the mounting if not careful! ) </s>
<s> wait for about ten minutes and put it back. </s>
<s> Warning! </s>
<s> If you are not aware of the BIOS settings and what they mean, get a knowledgable person to do this. </s>
