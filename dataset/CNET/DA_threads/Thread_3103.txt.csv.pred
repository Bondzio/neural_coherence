1.1.1	Firstly , I apologize if this is the wrong place .	St
1.1.2	My question is what is the equivalent of Motherboard in the older generation computers ( like the 1st Gen computers ) ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.3	I heard it was vacuum tubes .	St
1.1.4	If so , I would like to know how they performed the function of a motherboard .	St
1.1.5	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	If you looked at very early computers that used tubes , they often had a rudimentary backplane .	St
1.2.2	Later these advanced to such as the VMEBUS http : //duckduckgo.com/ ? q=vmebus+backplane and for the personal computers the S-100 was very common .	St
1.2.3	With the Apple 1 you see the beginnings of the motherboard where the computer was small enough to be put directly on the backplane .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	There were no mtrbds .	St
1.3.2	in the tube era .	St
1.3.3	If anything these were dedicated devices , etc .	St
1.3.4	that did a task in/out or to process .	St
1.3.5	Those computers that were mechanical and/or before anything transistors were mostly in the 50-60 's era .	St
1.3.6	There were modules at best or wirewrap to include backplanes , black boxes or PCB 's mounted on busses which are concidered backplanes .	St
1.3.7	Also , tubes found on older computers may have been power related rather than logic .	St
1.3.8	Google for computer museums , even WWII era ultra enigma decoders .	St
1.3.9	However , do n't confuse analog computers to what was the 1st electrical or non-mechanical type computers .	St
