<s> I'm looking to buy a new desktop computer but it seems like a monitor is nearly 1/3 of the price. </s>
<s> Do certain brands crap out on you? </s>
<s> What kind do you have? </s>
<s> I was looking at newegg.com and there's an Acer 17&quot; LCD for only $285. </s>
<s> Oh btw I either want a cheap LCD or a flat screen tube, at 17&quot; (under about $350. </s>
<s> Yeah I know it limits the LCDs, that's why I'm looking more towards a flat tube.) </s>
<s> So I would appreciate any recommendations. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Check out Wal-Mart or the larger electronics chains. </s>
<s> The prices are reasonable and you have the security of knowing a reputable company stands behind thier product and will help you with any warranty issues. </s>
<s> You will spend a lot more time staring into your monitor than into your PC case (unless you have a real problem with it). </s>
<s> You don't want a poor quality monitor regardless of how long it lasts. </s>
<s> If you can, take the time to look at a few in person. </s>
<s> Read some reviews as well. </s>
<s> Also keep in mind that an LCD image is only optimal when running in its &quot;native&quot; resolution. </s>
<s> I've had good luck with Viewsonic, Sony, NEC and a couple more. </s>
<s> I have not been so fortunate with CTX, Sharp, and a couple others but your experience might differ. </s>
<s> What do you mean by it's &quot;native&quot; resolution? </s>
<s> When you look at the specs for an LCD monitor, you will see one for &quot;native resolution&quot;. </s>
<s> This will have something to do with the relative density of the pixels and tends to be the best setting for image quality. </s>
<s> You can change the resolution but the image quality can visibly degrade much more than with a CRT type. </s>
<s> There is quite a difference in price as they move up in size you really need to buy one that has a native resolution that offers the amount of screen content you wish rather than get a smaller one for less money and think you can just adjust the resolution to compensate. </s>
<s> You may not be so happy with the image quality when you do this. </s>
<s> Oh okay thanks. </s>
<s> How are MAG LCD monitors? </s>
<s> Are they any good? </s>
<s> There's one on sale at BestBuy for $300. </s>
<s> Here are the specs: 17&quot; LCD screen (17&quot; viewable) 1280 x 1024 maximum resolution at 75Hz 0.264mm dot pitch </s>
<s> I was at Best Buy recently. </s>
<s> I never shopped for MAGs. </s>
<s> I had been interested in a Viewsonic VX910 (19&quot;) I had seen at CompUSA. </s>
<s> I thought it was a great looking monitor next to the rest of the Samsungs, NECs, etc. </s>
<s> They have a 17&quot; version (VX710) which is very nice. </s>
<s> I wanted digital capabilites which this series had. </s>
<s> Eventually I took a chance on a Princeton and like it a lot. </s>
<s> The Viewsonic VXs are really nice too. </s>
