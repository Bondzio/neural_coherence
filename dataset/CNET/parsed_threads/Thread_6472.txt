<s> Not sure if this is the right place for this but here goes. </s>
<s> I have a Dell dem. </s>
<s> 8400 running xp Pro wirh all the updates. </s>
<s> When I go to burn jpgs. </s>
<s> to DVD everything is fine until I click on Make Compatable. </s>
<s> It starts then I get a blue stop screen.If I don't click Make compatiable I can open the files on my computer but it does not work on others. </s>
<s> If I remember correctly I did not have this problem a few months ago. </s>
<s> I reinstalled my Sonic software but that did not help. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Are you using some type of file CD/DVD, as in drag and drop, as in the disk is like a drive? </s>
<s> If so, don't. </s>
<s> It can be flaky and takes extra data/drivers to make the disk playable on other machines. </s>
<s> I copy jpg images to DVD. </s>
<s> Everything works fine and I can open the files on the disk after burning. </s>
<s> It's just when I click on &quot;Make compatable&quot; it crashes the computer. </s>
<s> that the DVD burner works just fine when burning slide shows from Pro Show Gold. </s>
<s> It's just a start but it means that you installed some other software to enable using the media as a big floppy. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Uninstall that software and then reinstall this plus what updates they offer. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> what software that could be. </s>
<s> What should I look for. </s>
<s> The only thing I could find besides the Sonic DLA was Power DVD5.5. </s>
<s> Could that be the one? </s>
<s> DLA is a form of formatting that enables the optical drive to work like a big hard drive or floppy disk. </s>
<s> When you &quot;copy files&quot; to the optical drive you are burning them but they will only work on that PC. </s>
<s> That &quot;Make Comatable&quot; option is supposed to make the optical disk compatable with other PCs. </s>
<s> It's not. </s>
<s> As Bob said, uninstall it or use standard burning techniques. </s>
<s> Do you have a burning program? </s>
<s> Are there any programs you recomend? </s>
<s> I'm a photographer and I need to put jpgs on a DVD to give out but I have to make sure that other computers will read the files. </s>
<s> It's what I use. </s>
<s> Try download.com </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
