1.1.1	Ok, heres my problem.	St
1.1.2	I currently have a 54G wireless router from Microsoft.	St
1.1.3	I love it.	St
1.1.4	It never stops working, and is pretty easy to use.	St
1.1.5	I have an integrated 802.11g notebook, a Airlink wireless pci adapter for a desktop, and a Microsoft 54G Access point (actually for teh Xbox) connected to my Mac Mini.	St
1.1.6	The problem I am having is that because I have a large, two story house, with lots of walls, I have a speed issue.	St
1.1.7	The router is on the second floor, so it can easily reach my kitchen and living room.	St
1.1.8	It reaches my bedroom and my daughters, but it really lacks in speed.	St
1.1.9	I had Comcast come out last week, and I was told that I was operating at extremely high speeds.	St
1.1.10	On a computer that i have directly connected to the wireless router via ethernet, it rates about 2400kbps.	St
1.1.11	It significantly slows down to around 400-600.	St
1.1.12	My question is if I should buy a range extender, or get the pre-n router.	St
1.1.13	I have read alot of reviews about the range extender, and they have not been flattering.	St
1.1.14	Everything I have heard about the pre-n router has been great.	St
1.1.15	I know that to take full advantage of the pre-n, I will have to have the pci and pcmia cards, but thats 200 more.	St
1.1.16	What do you suggest?	St
1.1.17	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	I'm in a similar situation and was going to get a range extender.	St
1.2.2	I'm not sure the Pre N will help as I still have to transmit between 2 floors.	Res
1.2.3	Any suggestions?	St
1.2.4	Thanks,	St
1.3.1	You upgrade to pre-N now and it may not work with all of your equipment, cost alot and their calling it pre-N for a reason.	St
1.3.2	So get the extender because you will still have the same walls with pre-N and check into a faster broadband connection.	St
1.4.1	www.freeantennas.com has some zero cost designs I've made in the kitchen.	St
1.4.2	As to your questions.	St
1.4.3	Yes and the above.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	was looking into a D-link Extender (have d-link router and adapter) vs. Netgear electronic vs. Buffalo router and extender.	St
1.5.2	Any suggestions?	St
1.6.1	You already use D-link with no problems so just get their extender.	St
1.6.2	You may be upgrading to N in just over a year so why invest in new equipment now to change later.	St
1.6.3	but look into the free stuff because you can't beat FREE!	St
1.6.4	In the end the choice is yours.	St
1.7.1	- use a FreeAntennas.com alteration - install a higher gain antenna on current router - add a range extender/expander - add a wireless access point (requires running one network cable) - replace router with pre-n router - install firmware that will boost signal - connect two wireless routers using WDS capable firmware The last two options depend on availability of 3rd party firmware for your current model.	St
1.7.2	Personal experience: Linksys Wireless-G Range Expander (WRE54G) is a real pain to deal with--not recommended.	St
1.8.1	...to everyone for the replies.	St
1.8.2	I'm wondering if the D-Link extender will maintain the Gamerlounge technology.	St
1.8.3	Anybody know?	St
1.9.1	Going through same thing sorta, posted about it too...i think instead of beating around the bushes and getting extenders, or free antennas the source of the problem has to do with lack of preformance from the router.	St
1.9.2	im thinking either Belkin Pre N or the Netgear RangMax WPN824...now the hard part is i cant decide which one is better.	St
1.9.3	i hear good and bad about both from users on cnet.	St
1.9.4	wish i could get some help on that!	Sug
1.9.5	if anyone has a solid answer please help!	St
1.9.6	thanx, c	St
1.10.1	In RF applications not only the equipment matters but the environment and location of the RF equipment.	St
1.10.2	I know to relocate the wifi router, but others will blame the equipment.	St
1.10.3	I like the rangemax, but don't see them too often.	St
1.10.4	The lesser units work for most but then again I give the industry a failing grade on firmware and drivers.	St
1.10.5	Bob	St
