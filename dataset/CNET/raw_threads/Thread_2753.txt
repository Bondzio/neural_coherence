The problem is that everytime I open IE, I get that its not connecting to internet message. It gives me an option of running the windows diagnostic, which I do. It usually works, then I can get online. Sometimes I have to run it a few times before I can get online. any suggestions?

I do show a strong signal, on my network (and my other laptop does work fine). IE just always makes me go through the dignostic in orer to use the internet. Is there a setting taht I am missing?
