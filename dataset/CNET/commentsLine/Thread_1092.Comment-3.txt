i am rebuilding this tower for someone else.
the dell board is the 4h665.
it is used in the gx400 and precision330.
i have also used it in the dimension8100 as an upgrade.
since intel made this board and others and can be used with any os i figure this board will work as well as long as the non standard specs for dell were used for this board as well.
this board number came up during a search for the 665. the seller indicates it will work for the gx400.
but i am trying to find someone knowledgeable enough to verify this for me.
i will use the same dell psu.
if the connector pinouts are not dells than i will blow up the board.
any help welcome.
the 665 uses a 1.7 p4, up to 1 gig memory, xp pro, one 80 gig hhd, 24 plus 16 pin atx board connectors, 16 pin power connector for the front panel button.
