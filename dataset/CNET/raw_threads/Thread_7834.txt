We have 4 computers on the network 1 being wired and the rest wireless. All the computers that are wireless have draft n. But 2 of them our macs. What i want to do is connect the Hard Drive to the router and have it on the network for my parents when they offload photos onto there mac computer and have a backup of them. Will this even work?
