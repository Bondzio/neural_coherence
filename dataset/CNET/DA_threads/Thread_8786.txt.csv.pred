1.2.1	You go to their web site, plug in your device information and it lists compatible RAM.	St
1.2.2	I've used them many times with nary a problem.	St
1.3.1	Its very important to check the specs of your laptop to understand the what it supports.	St
1.3.2	I can only suggest as you have 4gb already it may not support more or you have to remove some ram in order to re-use the now empty slot(s) to populate with larger ram sticks.	St
1.3.3	Otherwise, its a mute point.	St
1.3.4	Alas, when it comes to brand it always nice to have the same type and/or brand installed.	St
1.3.5	It may not matter but it can if the system is too picky.	St

1.3.7	The vaule of either one is the replacement or if there is an issue you can return them minus any s/h costs.	St
1.3.8	review the warranty and what it entails.	St
1.3.9	I have found these website good sources due to cost and/or sales at times.	St
