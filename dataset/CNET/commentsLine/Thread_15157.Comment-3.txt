865 and 875 intel series?
i recall something about the 875 including what is called pat technology which is supposed to provide a small performance gain.
some mb manufacturers such as asus, are said to have unlocked it in some of their 865s.
i believe intel calls the 875 their &quot;canterwood&quot; and the 865 the &quot;springdale&quot;.
i've read there is little performance difference, however.
some say the 865s are a better value.
most will now support the intel prescott cpus.
