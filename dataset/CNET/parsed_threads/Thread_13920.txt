<s> I just upgraded my motherboard to a PC CHIPS M863G, and I'm having some trouble with it getting to boot. </s>
<s> In short, there is no booting. </s>
<s> No beeping, no flashing, so then there's most likely a short about. </s>
<s> The last time I tried to install a motherboard, I had this exact problem. </s>
<s> I ended up taking it to a technician, and when he fixed it up, and I asked him what the problem was, he told me that something to the effect of my CPU clock being off sync with my FSB, or something. </s>
<s> To this day, I have no idea how to adjust that setting on the motherboard, and I'm becoming pretty frustrated. </s>
<s> The manual is total garbage. </s>
<s> And if anyone already has had experience with this board, I did plug in the 4-pin power plug as well as adjusted the CMOS jumper. </s>
<s> Specs: Proc: AMD Athlon XP 2400+ RAM: Kingston DDR400 512MB GPU: nVidia GeForce 5500 FX Plus a Lite-On CD/DVD drive and another ATAPI DVD drive and two running virtual drives </s>
<s> Seems that you did what I had to do with four of them to get the supply to turn on. </s>
<s> They all came with the CMOS jumper in the wrong position. </s>
<s> In the case of these the manul showed the positions correctly, just that the mobos shipped with the jumper in the wiring position. </s>
<s> One thing common to putting new mobo in old case is to miss the fact that there is a hex standoff left on the mounting plate that does NOT line up with the new mobos plated ring mounting holes. </s>
<s> This results in shorting the artwork on the bottom layer of the mobo. </s>
<s> lay it on a piece of cardboard with ony CPU/HSF, Memory. </s>
<s> Plug the supply in and use the tip of a small slot screwdriver to momentarily short the two power on pins on the mobo togeter. </s>
<s> The power supply should turn on and STAY on, until you short the pins again, possibly for 4 or 5 seconds. </s>
<s> BTW way, this should work with a brand new mobo with NOTHING added. </s>
<s> Should work right out of the box. </s>
<s> pressing the on off switch repeatedly. </s>
<s> That worked for me yesterday. </s>
<s> I bought a mobo and put everything in and when I pressed the power button nothign happened. </s>
<s> I thought somethign was wrong so I kept flcking the power supply switch on/off while keep pressing the power button and my mobo turned on. </s>
<s> I bit the bullet and took it to the Geek Squad. </s>
<s> A guy that looks like Elliot Smith took all of 10 minute to diagnose it. </s>
<s> As it turned out, the little power/reset/LEDs were miscolored. </s>
<s> D'oh. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help though. </s>
<s> You guys do a good thing here. </s>
