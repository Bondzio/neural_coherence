was it a lack of disk manager software?
or was disk failure?
i use hitachi hard drives(with no problems and quiet)and yes they do lack the disk manager software available with wd drives.
however they do have a very good free drive fitness test that will recover failed disk surface problems that ultimately occur on drives.
