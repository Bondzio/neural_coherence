<s> Hey what's going on folks. </s>
<s> I am looking to spice up my Dell Dimension 2400. </s>
<s> I have plans on purchasing a laptop very soon, and I wanted to convert the 2400 into a Media Center PC. </s>
<s> I plan on adding 1gb of ram, a new video card with a DVI out (to hook up to my tv via DVI to HDMI), a new sound card, and a wireless internet adapter, and possibly a tv tuner. </s>
<s> Here is my dilemma I only have 3 PCI slots in this hunk of junk, but I have 4 components to hook up. </s>
<s> So here is my question do you have any suggestions on components? </s>
<s> Also do I need all of this. </s>
<s> I still have the &quot;stock&quot; video card with VGA out and no DVI. </s>
<s> I do have a Creative SB Live sound card in it right now. </s>
<s> Thank you all for any help. </s>
<s> Keep in mind I am buying a laptop so I don't have a huge budget. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
