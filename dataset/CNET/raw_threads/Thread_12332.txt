My current set up is Connected to my master telephone socket (upstairs) is a Fibre Optic Broadband modem which then goes into a Huawei HG533 (talktalk) Wifi router, giving me WIFI in the home (connected to multiple Win7 PCs/Sky Box/iPhones/Android Tablets etc) I have an office out-building which I have a cat5 cable running from the office into my home downstairs. (previously my broadband worked off the telephone slave socket and I could directly connect) now I am using a Belkin HD powerline connected to the WIFI router upstairs and then plugged in downstairs with the cat5 office cable inserted. In the office I have Netgear RangeMax WNR854T which when the cat5 from the house is connected to the DSL socket which gives me wifi and allows me to direct connect my Win 7PC/IPTelephone/Network Printer/Win7 Laptop. However this creates its own little network and whilst I can get internet ok. I can not see the home PCs and vis-a-versa. I want to be able to transfer files across the full network (currently using a USB stick) and print from any machine to the office printer. If I connect the cat5 from the house to a LAN port I can see the full network but have now internet (or wifi) in the office.I thought by doing it this way my office router would act as a network hub and allow internet through but it doesnt. I thought I had a pretty good understanding of these things but this problem has broken me!!! Can anyone help? Thank you in advance

If you used the WAN port then you are creating another LAN (sorry if I don't expand the common acronyms) on the other side of that router. This is why I use routers for such things but GOOGLE THIS PHRASE -&gt; How do I use a router as a WAP? That's all I ever needed. Bob
