Last night I had to go inside of the tower to look at the hard drive, which means in my case, I had to remove the CD-RW drive. Anyway, i got the computer back together and everything was fine except for the CD-RW drive. All of the cables are hooked up, and it blinks and lights up at startup, but Windows 98Se dosen't detect it. I went under the System Icon and checked the device maganger and it dosen't list it. However, it does list my other CD-ROM drive. I contacted Compaq and they told me to boot into safe mode and uninstall the drivers there. I tried to do that; the computer will not let me boot into saft mode; however, when I woke up this morning, it let me boot into safe mode. Then everything started to work; I got the thing to work, then the computer froze and I had to restart; once again, it wouldn't let me boot into safe mode. I contacted Compaq again, they told me to make a Win 98 Bootable Diskette so I could restore the computer to an earlier time; i did that. Still wouldn't let me boot into Safe Mode. Anyway, please help me!!! I just want the computer to get into safe mode. The computer: Compaq Presario 5BWN21, Windows 98 SE, 128MB RAM, 20GB Hard Drive, LG CED-8080B CD-RW drive.

Were going to get a new computer in a couple of months anyway, I just want to get the drive working, can you help me?

It boots up, let me uninstall the drive, and I thought it would work, however, it didn't reinstall the drive when I booted into Windows. Here is the answer to you questions: 1. Yes. That is how I knew the drive model, make, etc. 2. I don't remember if it did. I don't think it did. I might just wait to get the thing fixed when we get a new computer.
