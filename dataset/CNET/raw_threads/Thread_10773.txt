How do I find out what is compatable with my computer so I don't buy something that won't fit? Buy the way it has the AMD Athlon 64X2 Duel core TK-55 1.80 GHz processor, and 959 MB RAM. The video card is the basic Nvidea graphics card that comes with the entertainment pc's but i want a much better one for HD movies and gaming.
