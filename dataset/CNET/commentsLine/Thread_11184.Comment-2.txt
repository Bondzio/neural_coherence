looking at  i see this is a via based board.
no mention of the os and if you installed the latest drivers you can find for the motherboard, but it's a common cause.
the mention of fans plus quite a full machine would have me running it without the case cover for now.
while my p4 is all of 3.0ghz, i fitted a generic 680watt supply to it for the simple reason i know to max out that area even though i don't believe it could deliver that number.
