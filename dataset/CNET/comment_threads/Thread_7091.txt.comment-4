Nero burning programs are pretty good.
What problem do you have with installing it?
What version of Nero is it supposed to be?
What type of DVD discs are you trying to burn?
What max speed are the discs?
Here is a good free program to try until you get Nero working: http://www.download.com/CDBurnerXP-Pro/3000-2646_4-10409087.html?tag=lst-0-1 I usually use Nero Ultra and CDBurnerXP Pro.
Also, there is a firmware update for that drive: http://www.liteonit.com/ODD/English/e_downloads/e_firmware_dvd%20rw.asp
