inside that little plastic connector for the external adapter, is a small switch that selects the power source.
either adapter of battery.
this jack gets jammed, yanked and pulled six ways at once.
it's not uncommon for the connector to work loose, pull up traces, create cold solder joints and burn things up.
after repeated repairs from repeated abuse, i just put the connector on a pig tail that hangs through the hole.
this keeps that connector area free from stress and can patch around a damaged pcb to salvage an otherwise junked unit.
an inspection is certainly called for.
