yep, it's win98se.
just bought the nic and the drivers are the latest from the web (and disk).
updates for os are getting harder to come by, but i have installed all available updates (had to really search for some of them) that may even remotely apply to this problem.
last night, ran full scan, defrag, sfc, virus check, reg check, couple different ad-aware type programs, etc...and this was all before i knew i have a problem with the device refusing to load!
had a system crash a week ago...computer wouldn't do anything, but almost everything is restored to previous operating environment (windows troubleshooter still will not function).
as a result of fix, i now have a second computer (also win98se) and came up with clever idea to establish a network.
clever, my ***!
i'm determined now to complete this task.
keep the ideas coming!
