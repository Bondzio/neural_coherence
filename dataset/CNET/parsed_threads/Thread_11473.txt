<s> This has probably been asked before but i am wracking my brain looking for an answer. </s>
<s> I have a new Dell Inspiron Desktop with the new i3 processor and Win7. </s>
<s> I wanted to set up a network with my older Dell Dimension which has P4 proccessor and WinXP and a Dell Inspiron laptop. </s>
<s> Neither desktop has wireless cards but the laptop does. </s>
<s> I purchased a Netgear Wireless N 300 router and a Netgear N300 wireless usb adapter. </s>
<s> Both feature the Push n Connect security feature. </s>
<s> I connected the router to the new desktop and the adapter to the older desktop. </s>
<s> Everything is now connected, up and running and the network is secure. </s>
<s> The laptop can be connected to the network by typing in a passphrase I created. </s>
<s> My question is: I was under the impression I needed a wireless adapter for the new desktop. </s>
<s> Is this true and is it necessary? </s>
<s> What will happen if one is not installed. </s>
<s> Sorry but I am still learning about all this. </s>
<s> Thanks anyone! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> It's rather simple. </s>
<s> You either need a cable for a wired connection between the Dell and the router, or a wireless adapter. </s>
<s> If you go for a wireless one, you can choose between one connected via USB or one connected via the Ethernet port. </s>
<s> So, all in all, you've got three things to choose from. </s>

<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I kinda figured. </s>
<s> I guess I have a wired and wireless connection hooked up? </s>
