...they aren't known for their monitors...i, like you guys, found out the hard way...but, i found a solution, if you have the daring and the guts to dig into the monitor...no guarantees....this'll void your warranty, so proceed with caution....but it's relatively easy, with a few common hand tools...screwdrivers, needle nose pliers.....worked for me...reply back to this discussion, and i'll tell you what i did...monitor's working fine for now, so far, so good..:) matt
