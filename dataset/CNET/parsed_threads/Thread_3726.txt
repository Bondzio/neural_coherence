<s> My computer has a K7S5A PRO Socket A Main Board.The CPU is an Athlon XP 2000 which I suspect to be defective. </s>
<s> The heatsink is held in place by two retentipon clips on either side of the heatsink unit. </s>
<s> I can't figure how to remove the clips from the socket 462 base so that I can get to the CPU. </s>
<s> There must be an easy way to do it, but I can't figure how. </s>
<s> HELP!! </s>
<s> Thanks, Ray Savage </s>

<s> If you look closely one of the clips is &quot;hinged&quot; thus it will move away after pushing down on that clip. </s>
<s> When free, twist and wingle the heatsink to break free the heatsink itself as the heatsink compounf may have siezed it abit. </s>
<s> You can now unlock the cpu ZIF handle to remove cpu &quot;with care&quot;, denote the ordination should you decide to remove cpu. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Bob: This is just what I needed - don't know what some of us would do without folks like you!! </s>
<s> MANY THANKS and Merry Christmas! </s>

<s> Willy: Thanks for your reply and help. </s>
<s> Your info combined with Bob's has made this problem simple. </s>

<s> I have an AMD athlon chip on my computer and when I took the heat sink of there was no thermal pad but there was thermal grease I cleaned it up and then added more is it bad that I don;t have a thermal pad? </s>
<s> The Thermal paste is just as effective as the thermal tape. </s>
<s> I suspect that as the processors got faster and the heat increased, the manufacturers found a quick way of providing heat protection (Thermal Tape), that would not rub off in transit. </s>
<s> The Boxed CPUs come with the thermal tape applied so that you don't forget, however OEM CPUs come naked and you have to buy a fan/sink combo which may or may not come with thermal tape. </s>
<s> It is difficult to find thermal tape.If you have to remove the Boxed CPU for any reason, or supply your own fan, a tube of thermal paste/grease is always available at the nearest RadioShack. </s>
<s> If you use the Thermal Paste make sure that you apply a thin layer on the Die, rather than let a gob of it get down on the exposed resistors, since some of the paste is made from Zinc metal and may short out your CPU. </s>
<s> Remember, all you want to do is fill in any uneven spots on the die and the surface of the heatsink, so that a gas tight fit is achieved between the heatsink and the die. </s>
<s> This helps wick away the heat. </s>
