<s> i've got an LCD monitor that can take VGA input. </s>
<s> I would like to buy a cable so that i can use my wireless keyboard and mouse from my bed. </s>
<s> THe only thing is i am not sure which cable to get. </s>
<s> I see that there are DB15 and HD15. </s>
<s> what is the difference? </s>
<s> There are limits to how long you can reliably get away with. </s>
<s> Pure guess would be that the HD is a better made and shielded cable to allow possibilities of running with a longer cable. </s>
<s> Price may show the difference. </s>
<s> my card has a DVI connection so i would be getting a DVI to APG converter and then a 10' cable. </s>
<s> so i should go with the HD15? </s>
<s> cable will probably work OK. </s>
<s> I assume that the adapter is simply the standard block about 2 inches long. </s>
