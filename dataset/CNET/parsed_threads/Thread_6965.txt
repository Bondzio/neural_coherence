<s> I've had my PC set up, with my laptop, in a network for a few yrs. </s>
<s> We recently moved and before I set up my PC again, I used the laptop at my daughter's home and used her Internet Connection to access the internet, with no problems at all! </s>
<s> Now that I have set up the PC in our new home, I have been able to access the internet from both the PC and the laptop. </s>
<s> In the past 2 wks, a problem started happening, every few days, with the laptop connecting to the internet. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what it was exactly but this past week, the laptop has had NO connection, at all!! </s>
<s> I've tried everything I can think about or find out about (google searching) but I can't get this problem fixed!!! </s>
<s> I need help!!!! </s>
<s> Problem: On the laptop, the icon for internet connectivity, shows the little vibes signs that means the laptop has connected with the internet. </s>
<s> Each time I restart, or boot up the laptop, a dialog box states: &quot;Wireless network connection is now connected.&quot; Below that it states the correct &quot;Connected to:name&quot; and states that the &quot;Signal Strength is Excellent&quot; BUT I can't get any of my browsers to open. </s>
<s> They all say the same &quot;this page can't be displayed&quot;, etc!! </s>
<s> How frustrating!! </s>
<s> My PC is connected and working fine. </s>
<s> My HP Pavillion Media Center PC is hooked up to a cable modem which is hooked up to a D-Link wireless router ((DI-524). </s>
<s> When I networked the Acer laptop to the PC, thru the router, in Jan/07, I followed the things I learned from the CNET online course for networking. </s>
<s> Everything worked great for almost all of this time prior to the move. </s>
<s> When it didn't, I used Network Magic to repair the connection and it was always successful. </s>
<s> Now, I'm at a loss as to why I can't get the laptop to connect to the internet!! </s>
<s> Becuz Network Magic couldn't do a thing for me, on the laptop, I uninstalled it. </s>
<s> The Network Map (on the PC) didn't show the laptop or anything, like it did on the laptop (showed the PC - Barbara's Lifeline, the router, the laptop, and the printers). </s>
<s> I didn't uninstall it from the PC, tho. </s>
<s> I checked all of my settings, starting with the workgroup name, to make sure that both the PC and the laptop had the same ones and they do. </s>
<s> Network Magic did a great job until this problem. </s>
<s> I uninstalled it from the laptop and I tried using the &quot;Windows to configure my wireless network settings&quot; but that didn't help either. </s>
<s> I hope I have given you enough specs about each piece of hardware and enough info that someone can help me fix this problem. </s>
<s> I searched and searched thru all of CNET's forum titles for info that could help me but I didn't have any luck finding a thread with the same situation as mine. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP! </s>
<s> Others here with more knowledge of networks and wireless will be able to help I'm sure, but until then try a couple of things. </s>
<s> First. </s>
<s> What happens if you connect the laptop directly to the modem? </s>
<s> Do you get a usable network connection then? </s>
<s> By usable, I mean your browser works. </s>
<s> If so, then the problem is likely the laptop's configuration with the router. </s>
<s> If not, then the problem lies within the laptop itself, possibly the firewall or it could even be virus/spyware damage. </s>
<s> Please tell us what firewall you use, and what anti-virus and anti-spyware utilities you use. </s>
<s> Are those utilities up to date, (virus/spyware definitions)? </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> Hi Mark, Sorry for not getting back to you sooner but we had a family tragedy so I wasn't able to post back until now. </s>
<s> I don't have a clue what was wrong but I decided to clean up the laptop and when I removed one of the programs I didn't need anymore, I had to do a restart to finish uninstalling it. </s>
<s> When it rebooted, my internet connection was back and running just fine. </s>
<s> Go figure! </s>
<s> So, this post is now resolved. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help anyway, Mark. </s>
