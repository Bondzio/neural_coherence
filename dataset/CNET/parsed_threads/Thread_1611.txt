<s> Hey, I have a laptop supporting 802.11g with Linksys wireless routur WRT54G(the one not supporting speedbooster). </s>
<s> I have it hooked up to my main computer in my room and the laptop also in my room. </s>
<s> My connection goes from 54Mbps to 2.0Mbps in a matter of about 30min. </s>
<s> I always seem to loose strength even though the router is right there next to the laptop. </s>
<s> I have to reboot my laptop just to get back to 54Mbps. </s>
<s> Not sure why I have to reboot once it goes between 1.0-2.0Mbps, when my laptop is right there. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
