Think clearance around stuff. Shop for an atx mobo. HDD - Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB/Western Digital Caviar Blue 500GB Not sure if that means your going to get one or two.....but anyway do some reading about this style unit. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007603&IsNodeId=1&Description=PPSSSSHD&name=Desktop%20Hard%20Drives

In addition to his point about clearance, I'd say ventilation/heat may become another issue in the long term. Your CPU, GPU will run hot, especially when playing games. The more space for ventilation you have the better... Note, the CoolerMaster Hyper 212 EVO will help cooling the CPU, but it's large in size and won't do much for your GPU. Plus, when thinking of all the internal cables (i.e. SATA), power cables (both the PSU and GPU) it will get tight in there... The Case you're buying has tons of room, and it comes with 3 fans, I suggest getting 2 more...to ensure you get max ventilation. Good luck Sam
