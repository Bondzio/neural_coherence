Could anybody give me some suggestions to recover my contents from a WD external hard drive? I pulled it out while transferring some files from it to my computer. I know that is not right! And now, when I plunge it back to my computer, it says it is needed to be formatted. I don't want to lose my data on this drive. What should I do? Please, give me some suggestions. Thank you in advance!

Anyway, have a look at http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-354911/lost-and-found-or-the-storage-forum-sticky/ The usual sequence: free programs, paid programs, data recovery company. But in your case, one of the free programs might work. Kees

You can wait for replies or if you're in a hurry, you can find potential solutions by reading prior posts and following those that make sense to you based on your situation. Good Luck, VAPCMD

One is always asked to use his drive correctly, if he wants to avoid data loss and prolong his hard drive lifespan. But, extracting a hard drive in use is absolutely not right! So, you've got this &quot;not formatted error&quot; problem. You should always act carefully to get back your data. 1). Do not click &quot;yes&quot; to format this drive before you've restored all your data back. 2). Do not save new data on this drive in case that your original data would be rewritten and gone permanently. 3). Do not choose a data recovery program randomly. The efficiency of data recovery program could decide whether you could successfully retrieve all your data back to some extent. You should carefully select a proper one. In my opinion, there are some drive data recovery freeware that could help you a lot: Recuva, Easeus and iCare Data Recovery Free, etc. 4). Do not forget to back up all your restored data on a different drive. Good luck!
