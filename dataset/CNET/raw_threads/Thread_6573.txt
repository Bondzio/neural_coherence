The internet access would be a DSL line on the phone. Because of the size of the pool area, range would be very important. Therefore I'm assuming an N wireless router would be best. In looking at reviews I keep seeing the Trendnet N-Draft Router TEW-631BRP topping the charts in the 200 foot range tests. Anyone with experience with this wireless router that could comment? Or recommend a wireless router with good range and reliability? While the various new draft N routers are coming on the market, it looks like the old Belkin pre-N router is beating the new ones in the reviews. Would that be a good one for range if I can find it?
