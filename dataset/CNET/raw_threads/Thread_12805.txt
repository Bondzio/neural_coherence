8851	0	194639	2099599	NR	hippiechick37	7/29/06 7:26 AM	1.15415796E12	Graphics Card	I am looking to upgrade my graphics card and was wondering if anyone could tell me about this particular one (i.e. if it's worth the buy); Crucial Radeon X1600 PRO 512MB AGP. Also, any suggestions on a card would be appreciated. Thanks.
