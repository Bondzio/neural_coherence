<s> As it gets ready to feed a new piece of paper, HP Photosmart 8250 makes horrid grinding noise. </s>
<s> It makes normal clicking noises, then very fast thack-thack-thack-thack, more normal clicking and then another set of grinding. </s>
<s> There are no error messages and it prints just fine (when there's ink). </s>
<s> It's been doing this for a while and we've been ignoring it. </s>
<s> What could cause it? </s>
<s> I posted this question in HP's forum in January and got no replies. </s>
<s> We don't print enough to use the ink up before it expires. </s>
<s> We ignore the warnings about using expired ink. </s>
<s> That wouldn't cause this, would it? </s>
<s> (Those expiration messages are just SO ANNOYING.) </s>
<s> Now it won't print black & white because it says we are out of yellow ink. </s>
<s> What does yellow ink have to do with printing black & white? </s>
<s> We don't know whether to throw this piece of cr*p away or buy more ink and put up with grinding noise. </s>
<s> This is Windows 7 Home 64-bit. </s>
<s> Any advice would be most welcome! </s>
<s> I see at http://www.amazon.com/HP-Photosmart-8250-Printer-Q3470A/dp/B000A6X9CU this was first available in 2005. </s>
<s> ANY CONSUMER GRADE PRINTER is non-repairable for very simple reasons. </s>
<s> The minimum shop fee is over 100 bucks and a new printer can be had for less. </s>
<s> This does infuriate some folk so we know to not upset them by writing about this issue. </s>
<s> (Oops.) </s>
<s> I see folk do sell used ones starting at 50 bucks so your choice to get another to take its place without issues. </s>

<s> I suppose it did serve us well. </s>
<s> It's not the answer I was hoping for. </s>
<s> Yes, I'm one of the folks that gets infuriated by the planned obsolescence! </s>
<s> Something else to add to the landfill, not to mention the waste unused and probably expired ink cartridges (but no yellow)! </s>
<s> I hear you but are you willing to pay for the repairs that cost more than the printer? </s>
<s> It's not planned ob... </s>
<s> It's simple economics. </s>
<s> If you can make a printer for 50 bucks retail that lasts for 2 years then why not? </s>
<s> It beats having to pay about a grand for a printer that lasts a decade. </s>
<s> 250 bucks is cheaper than 1,000? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am using that same printer and it will make that noise when it's doing self maintenance. </s>
<s> If it has a empty ink cartridge it will do the clunky weird noise almost every time you try to print. </s>
<s> I let one of the cartidges go dry when I first got the printer and it did just what you are discribing. </s>
<s> After I replaced the cartridge the noise went away except for when it does it's maintenance. </s>
<s> Have not let one go dry since and no noise. </s>
<s> You may have a different problem, but as Bob said, it's not worth wasting money to have it repaired when a new printer is cheaper. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
