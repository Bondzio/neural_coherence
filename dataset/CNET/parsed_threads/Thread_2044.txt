<s> I reinstalled windows 2000 on a new hard drive. </s>
<s> It will not connect to internet. </s>
<s> My laptop connects no problem, via cable modem. </s>
<s> What devices do I need to connect to internect, it shows a nonworking pci icon on device manager, also nic card shows running but it may be missing driver, any advise on this. </s>
<s> Thanks Dan </s>
<s> Get those drivers and install them! </s>
<s> Unfortunately, that is the best advice we can give you because only you know the make & model of that laptop. </s>
<s> Now, if we knew what you know, then we could tell you where to download all the drivers (the laptop maker's website). </s>
<s> BTW, where is your driver CD that came with the computer? </s>
