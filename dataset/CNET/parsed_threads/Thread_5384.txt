<s> I have a dell dimension 8300 with a geforce fx 5200 card installed. </s>
<s> I am looking at getting a widescreen hdtv with a native resolution of 1386x788... will my video card support that resolution? </s>
<s> I haven't been able to find any info that will tell me if it will support any widescreen resolutions. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?q=geforce+5200+in+widescreen finds some discussion about this. </s>
<s> However there are 22 fx5200 cards out there and I can't know if yours has a compatible DVI connection. </s>

<s> I have a 5200 and stepping through the setting, it doesn't show on mine. </s>
<s> But, it should support a lesser value at max. </s>
<s> (mine) of 1280X1024. </s>
<s> There are various vendors using the FX5200 series chipset but it should be very similar outputs. </s>
<s> In short its not a good marriage but *may* work as to what you HDTV range will allow. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
<s> I finally took the plunge and bought the Sony KDF42WE655 LCD Rear-Projection HDTV. </s>
<s> So great hooked up to my pc!!! </s>
<s> The only problem is, it turns out the tv doesn't accept high resolutions from the pc. </s>
<s> In fact for now I'm stuck using S-Video to get a half-decent 1024x728 resolution, the HDMI cable only allowed 640x400 or 640x480. </s>
<s> but I have the tv set on wide-zoom mode which stretches the picture a little, but still looks great. </s>
<s> Gotta look more into software to beef of my HDMI resolutions. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I'll give it a shot. </s>
<s> Any recommendations for a tutorial, or is it pretty self-explanatory? </s>
<s> I think bruises are the usual badges of learning this one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Just wanted to say thanks for the help... </s>
<s> I got everything set up, the tv looks great. </s>
<s> In case anyone has similar questions, I ended up not using powerstrip at all. </s>
<s> Turns out the updated drivers to the geforce 5200, which I had previously ignored due to s-video problems, made the pc to tv hookup with an hdmi to dvi cable easy as 1, 2, 3. </s>
