Hello, I have been having some trouble with my laptop.
I have a HP Pavillion DV8000 with Windows XP.
None of my USB ports seem to work, when I plug something in the error message titled &quot;USB Device Not Recognized&quot; pops up and the device does not operate.
I have researched this as much as possible for about 2 hours now and I have tried these methods.
- Unpluging power cord and battery - Deleting the items for USB under Device Manager - Checking for updates in windows update - Scanning for hardware changes in Device Manager I would really appreciate some help.
I have Service Pack 3.
