that ibook will only take the airport .11b (original) card and does not have the physical connections, or space, for the .11g airport card.
there are a number of usb wireless adapters out there but, as bob pointed out, their performance can be a little short of steller.
i don't think that any major speed gain would be made by spending extra cash on an external wireless card for this device.
i think you will find the speed adequate for normal web surfing and email p
