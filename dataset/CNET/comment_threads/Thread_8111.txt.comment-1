Hi, I would like to connect two Windows machines (XP and Vista) using a crossover cable and use remote desktop.
Is this possible?
I have only one monitor so I would like to see what is going on in the other machine using remote desktop.
If remote desktop does not work, are there any other options for me?
Thanks for your help.
