for gaming i find that just about any motherboard will do.
i like to see the i5 cpu as you surely have read the following.
&quot;our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved.
it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines.
&quot;  with the motherboard and cpu out of the way, i like to pick a video card from this list.
