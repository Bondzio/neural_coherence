I managed to strip it down to this. http://i.imgur.com/p145A.jpg So the first thing I notice is that this chip is loose. http://i.imgur.com/CyP4C.jpg And on the underside, it has 4 metal contacts, so we know that it goes there in that missing spot. http://i.imgur.com/FG87J.jpg However, it could orient either way, and I've tried holding it there myself and plugging it in, but to no avail. So, now I'm stuck here. I really need to recover this.Thanks.

A specialized data recovery company would have done better, and it might be more expensive now than it would have been if you hadn't started yourself. Anyway, a USB-stick should - exactly like a floppy 15 years ago - be considered as a good means to move data between computers. Not as permanent storage, and certainly not as a good place to store the only copy of some data. So - for everybody following that simple rule - no data is ever lost by a failed drive and there's no need at all for any expensive recovery. Let's hope you fall in that category. Kees

Use a magnifying glass and notice the solder pattern, because they would fit. However, how you solder it back is another issue. The proper tech way is find PIN 1 of solder area, it may have the #1 to ID it and the chip has a #1 or indent, dot, hollow or/on chip form, then match and resolder. Because, this is SMC stuff, it can be hard to do w/o proper tools, so you're left at the mercy of your skills. tada -----Willy

Using maybe small wood/leather pads in order to NOT smash chip, apply to flash drive and clip on the pliers using just necessary force to keep it from moving. Use a USB cable too extend the flash drive away from the port and allow ease of access. The constant contact may allow access to data if that's all it is, chip off pcb. You can apply a micro-drop of super glue with toothpick, again if ordination is known to keep chip in place, but apply pliers quickly before it sets. tada -----Willy
