i went ahead and opened the f1503 up and tried to fix it according to what i read here.
after a few frustrating hours, i took it to a friend who sometimes works on electronics.
he did find one leg that was rather loose, but he also found a couple of resistors that were bad.
he gave me the resistor numbers, and i ordered them on the internet for about $2 each.
a few days later the parts arrived and my friend fixed it!!
