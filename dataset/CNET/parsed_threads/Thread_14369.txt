<s> My socket 775 motherboard died about three months ago (verified by the Geek Squad at Best Buy), and my hubby purchased a replacement on Ebay. </s>
<s> I was planning to install it myself, but he claims we have to download all sorts of drivers and involves more than either of us can handle. </s>
<s> He purchased the board without consulting me, but claims he verified with the seller that everything should match. </s>
<s> The computer is custom-built (from a barebones kit), Windows XP Pro, DDR. </s>
<s> It was built by an acquaintance, but we live more than two hours away now, and none of the local computer shops have good reputations. </s>
<s> Please let me know what's involved and whether I should try installing the motherboard myself. </s>
<s> I've installed and formatted a hard drive, and stuck extra memory chips into the motherboard, but wouldn't consider myself a computer whiz by any stretch of the imagination. </s>
<s> Many thanks. </s>
<s> But I can't comment on the driver issue since the fine details are not available. </s>
<s> Also I can't comment if you'll need a new OS. </s>
<s> For instance some HP/Compaq/other owners get a rude shock when they replace their boards. </s>

<s> Bob, Thank you for your quick reply! </s>
<s> Here is the type of MB my hubby purchased: INTEL P4 HT LGA 775 FSB 800 DDR 400 ATX MOTHERBOARD+L+S I asked hubby for more info on the computer (he bought the kit and helped his friend build it), but he said he couldn't really provide any more info than I did initially. </s>
<s> According to the USPS, it's now in Maryland (we live one state over). </s>
<s> Thanks, Bindarra </s>

<s> From that I'm going to guess it's your everyday home built PC. </s>
<s> The only issues will likely be that XP may not boot. </s>
<s> Don't panic since there are articles aplenty to deal with that. </s>
<s> Here they are -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=XP+CHANGE+MOTHERBOARD&btnG=Google+Search Most of them offer advice on drivers as well. </s>

<s> Bob -- Thanks for all your advice. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, we ran into an unexpected delay -- Best Buy misinformed us about the type of board I have. </s>
<s> When they diagnosed it as dead, they told me it was a socket 775. </s>
<s> When we opened it up, however, we discovered the malfunctioning board was a socket A/462. </s>
<s> Thankfully, the gentleman my hubby bought it from consented to a switch, and we're waiting for the 462 to arrive. </s>
<s> I do have one question from reading the links you posted: if I need to reinstall some Windows files, will that erase my hard drive? </s>
<s> I have a lot of stuff on there I want to preserve! </s>
<s> I'll post again once we get this done -- I'm sure I'll run into problems and will need your expert advice once again. </s>

<s> It will note &quot;Change motherboard and save OS.&quot; Also known as the XP REPAIR INSTALL. </s>
<s> Of course with any such change there are no guarantees your hard disk will keep your files. </s>
<s> That's why you read so much about backup. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> After all this time, I wanted to let you know what happened. </s>
<s> Basically, everything failed. </s>
<s> The first Socket 462 motherboard wouldn't fire up, although the power supply came on. </s>
<s> A friend gave us another one, never removed from the box ... and the power supply wouldn't even come on. </s>
<s> So I'm giving up. </s>
<s> Repairing this computer is obviously a money pit, and no one seems to be able to diagnose just what is wrong with it. </s>
<s> I'll probably buy another barebones kit from Tiger Direct, although I'm so bitter about this, my third consecutive faulty computer, that I may not buy another one. </s>
<s> Anyway, thank you for your assistance. </s>
<s> new hardware on the bench (outside the case) before putting in the case. </s>
<s> Much easier to figure out what's wrong and try different parts should the need arise. </s>
<s> Better luck on the next one. </s>
