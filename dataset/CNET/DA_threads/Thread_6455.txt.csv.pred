1.1.1	I work out of my car often and am in need of a very small printer(for 8.5x11 paper) that puts out good quality and won't break the bank.	St
1.1.2	anyone out there have any suggestions as to which ones i should look at?	Ques
1.2.1	Plainly put there aren't that many to choose from.	St
1.2.2	HP and Canon offer some models for mobile or portable use.	St
1.2.3	These easily attach to a laptop.	St
1.2.4	Just google using those keywords, &quot;mobile or portable printer&quot; and review them.	St
1.2.5	Of course, whatever you get usually isn't made to output reams of paper, so typical small usage is advised or wait for heavy demands.	St
1.2.6	tada -----Willy	St
