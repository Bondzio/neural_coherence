I think what with the specifications on the MacBook it's not a very graphically intensive machine like the MacBook Pro. However, we can wait to see the results from Veronia. Or we can say that since on the Apple website it states that it can run games but not graphically intensive games (go into software and games) like the Pro. Sorry but no luck on WoW I think.
