If your DVD watching is producing noticeable choppiness, then it could be several reasons.
It could be the video card, motherboard, CPU, or OS.
Or even a combination of these.
It might be the monitor if the refresh rate is too slow or the response speed of the monitor is too low.
Changing to a TV for a monitor would only make it worse if the system is at fault.
