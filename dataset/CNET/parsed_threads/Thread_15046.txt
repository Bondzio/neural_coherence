<s> I am new to Mac computers, I am used to pcs. </s>
<s> My daughter gave me an old Ibook from 2001 that has an airport card in it. </s>
<s> It uses 802.11b wireless. </s>
<s> I would like to upgrade it to 802.11g wireless. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> If so, do I need to buy the expensive Apple airport card or is there another brand I can use? </s>
<s> Thanks for any info. </s>
<s> Get the Apple card and be happy it just works without much ado. </s>
<s> Try another card and if it glitches, then you get to sort it out. </s>
<s> The other makers just don't get it about Mac support so that's my advice since you have an Apple. </s>
<s> Consider that with the older iBook you may not realize any big gain in speed. </s>
<s> Then again... Bob </s>
<s> That iBook will only take the Airport .11b (original) card and does not have the physical connections, or space, for the .11g Airport card. </s>
<s> There are a number of USB Wireless adapters out there but, as Bob pointed out, their performance can be a little short of steller. </s>
<s> I don't think that any major speed gain would be made by spending extra cash on an external Wireless card for this device. </s>
<s> I think you will find the speed adequate for normal web surfing and email P </s>
<s> A PC-CARD slot is needed for any 802.11g card I've found. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the iBook does not sport a PC card slot so if there is any upgrading to do it would have to be via the USB connector. </s>
<s> Here are three I found just now. </s>
<s> I have not done any research as to their compatibility with OS X or OS 9 , but the devices do exist. </s>

<s> USB 1 is 11 megabit, and 802.11b about the same. </s>
<s> The pipe is full. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes, they did mention on one site that you would see greater speed increases with USB 2.0 but did not say why. </s>
<s> Sneaky! </s>
