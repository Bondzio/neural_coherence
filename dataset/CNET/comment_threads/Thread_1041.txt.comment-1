I have comcast digital cable, and I don't have a network card.
I recently bought a Network Adapter for my Playstation 2, and I don't have a correct plug for the network adapter.
If anyone has a network adapter, they know that you are supposed to plug in what looks like a phone jack.
What do I need to buy in able to use my network adapter?
Someone has told me these: A router, a network card (which we tried and it didn't work), and a cat5 cable...
Please help!
