<s> I recently moved my computer far enough away from the monitor and keyboard that I needed to add extension cables to make up the difference. </s>
<s> The monitor is working fine but just about every time I start the computer, I get an error message that the keyboard was not found or not present. </s>
<s> If I unplug the usb cable and plug it back in and push the reset button on the computer, it usually starts with no problem. </s>
<s> I have tried 4 different cables and the same thing happens. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me why this is happening and possibly how to fix it? </s>
<s> I see no mention of make or model but I did run into a machine that needed a BIOS setting to be able to use the USB keyboard without an error message on startup. </s>
<s> Something like USB Keyboard support and telling it not to halt on errors. </s>
<s> The lack of the PS2 connected keyboard was an error according to it's programming. </s>
<s> And there are limits to cable length. </s>
<s> If you over reached the length, this won't help. </s>
