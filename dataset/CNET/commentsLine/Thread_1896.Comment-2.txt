&quot;tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; not a whisper of what make/model or any part and the wattage of the power supply.
i've seen many issues, but you supplied nothing for the forum to comment on.
start very small.
a piece of cardboard, the cpu/heatsinkfan(hsf), power supply unit(psu), motherboard and a speaker.
plug just that on the cardboard and touch the power up jumper with a metal pen tip or jumper.
beeps are a good sign.
no beeps and one of the four parts are misconfigured or dead.
