1.1.2	Is this feasible ?	Ques
1.1.3	How would I know how many MBs or GBs I would need ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	If you have 40GB of disk data to back up to achieve a reliable backup you need 3 copies .	St
1.2.2	1 for storage away from the machine , number 2 as the copy that you will not overwrite during backup and number 3 will be the set you use to backup to .	St
1.2.3	Since 1GB Jumpdrives are fairly common , you need 120 of these units and with that many lets say you get them at the discount/sale price of 59 bucks each .	St
1.2.4	$ 7,080 later and heavy in debt you wonder if this was a good idea .	St
1.2.5	DVDRW backup seems cheaper .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
