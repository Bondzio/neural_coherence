i finally took the plunge and bought the sony kdf42we655 lcd rear-projection hdtv.
so great hooked up to my pc!!!
the only problem is, it turns out the tv doesn't accept high resolutions from the pc.
in fact for now i'm stuck using s-video to get a half-decent 1024x728 resolution, the hdmi cable only allowed 640x400 or 640x480.
but i have the tv set on wide-zoom mode which stretches the picture a little, but still looks great.
gotta look more into software to beef of my hdmi resolutions.
