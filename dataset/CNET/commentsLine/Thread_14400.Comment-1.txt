hallo, i have another question.
i have just put together a pc with an amd 2800+athlon processor, an abit nf7-s2 motherboard, a geforce mx 4000 display card,512 mb crucial pc 3200 ram.
when i switch on the power, the cpu and case fans start up, the led lights come on but the computer doesn't boot.
the monitor shows a &quot;no signal&quot; message.
i have cleared the cmos several times, taken out the battery and replaced it after about twenty minutes and i have insulated the motherboard from the case so i know it's not grounding.
does anyone have any ideas.
thanks, bert
