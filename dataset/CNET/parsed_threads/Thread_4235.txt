<s> The past week I have noticed my montor will flicker and then make all my windows have this huge distorted look similar to a &quot;pulled taffy&quot; wide effect. </s>
<s> Sometimes it will flicker back to normal 800x600 but lately it has been staying stuck at that wide window look. </s>
<s> I have tried the manual controls, doing a windows update and applying 800x600 again in Control Panel but nothing brings permanent solutions. </s>
<s> Before I shell out $$ for a new monitor (which comes at a bad time after spending $ on textbooks.) </s>
<s> Is there something I am overlooking or is it time to chuck it? </s>
<s> I have a 6 year old Comp USA 17&quot; CRT. </s>
<s> My destop is brand new, almost a year old. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> At 6 years old plus, and the description, my bet is that the monitor is failing. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Set it to 640x480 and see if that's bad too. </s>
<s> The real test is that monitor on another PC. </s>
