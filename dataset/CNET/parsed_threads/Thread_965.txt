<s> I am looking for a port replicator with extra USB hubs...basically a docking station plus USB hub. </s>
<s> Mostly what I would like are parallel, serial, PS2, and 6+ USB hubs, with power. </s>
<s> I have heard there are items like this out there, just wondering if anybody could recommend a brand. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> It does have PS2 for mouse/KBD, 1 rs232, 1 parallel and 4 usb 2.0 ports. </s>
<s> I've yet to see one with more. </s>
<s> It connects to an USB 2.0 port so I'm unsure if you would call it a docking device but it saves me a few connections. </s>

<s> Maybe I'm not sure how a docking station is different from a port replicator. </s>
<s> But basically, I wanted something with its own power to plug my computer in to the aforementioned ports, but with extra USB's so that I don't have to buy 2 different devices. </s>
<s> Does that make sense? </s>
<s> And I shared what I found. </s>
<s> I haven't seen one that met your specs. </s>
<s> But it seems close. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
