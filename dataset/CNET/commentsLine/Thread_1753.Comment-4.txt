it's why i just get it from crucial for many machines.
i have xp on a few machines with 512mb and a few with 1gb.
one xp machine has 2gb but i can't say it's any faster as to computations due to the ram.
bob ps.
i have a simple, cheap dv6910us that i run vs2008 on.
i have this crc routine that does some 4 billion crcs in a little over 3 minutes.
i'm impressed.
