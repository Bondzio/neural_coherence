Every time during installation finalising stage of windows XP professional the computer will shut down automatically during the Finalizing Installation stage. And it won't be able to power on unless I take out the processor and put it back again. I suspect it is either MB problem or processor problem.(tried installing server 2003 and same problem occurs) Anyone have experienced this problem before can confirm which one is to blame? Thanks!

Memory failure. Try with one stick. Run memory tests from http://www.memtest86.com 3. BIOS is not the latest. New to PC builders don't understand why a new board wouldn't have the latest BIOS. I can't explain it, but unless the BIOS is latest, you may crash and burn. 4. BIOS SAFE DEFAULTS until it's up. 5. POWER. I still see small power supplies driving big rigs. Easy to test. Just downsize the machine to one hard disk, one stick o'ram, one CD drive, one video card and try again with the case cover off. 6. The WORMS. A new install of today's Windows will catch a worm infection as soon as you go to install the patches. Drives people insane. Bob

Check the bios area and reset to defaults, reboot and then configure as needed, be on the safe side though. Review what the setting is for &quot;heat overtemp&quot; and the action taken if meant. Don assume, check it/any. Next, since you reseat the cpu, only way to do that once with orginal heat compound is a no-no multiple times. In other words, don't trust re-using what the vendor gave you. Buy a heatsink compound paste, instead of the &quot;heat pad&quot; the OEM provides. Of course make sure the whole HSF setup is seated and fully engaged. Overall, I think you got a &quot;heat&quot; problem. If none of this helps, return the mtrbd. and cpu, etc., it also suggests bad parts. Understand, if you handled these wrong, ESD(static) can do strange things as well. IMHO, Epox brand isn't top rated with me, but that's me. good luck -----WIlly
