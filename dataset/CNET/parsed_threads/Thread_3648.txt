<s> ok, first my specs: Sony Vaio w/ 3.6 ghz P4 w/HT (560J Prescott) 1 gig of 3200 DDR ram (400 mhz) ASUSTeK motherboard model PTGD2-VX XFX 7600 GT video card 256 GDDR2 MB PCIe (590 mhz core) 2 SATA 250 GB hd's @ 7200 RPM I bought this PC about 2 years ago, but am now wondering if it's time I upgrade or if I should wait.. </s>
<s> I currently use my PC for music composition and internet.. </s>
<s> But intend to also start playing a new game coming out called &quot;Supreme Commander&quot;.. After running 3DMark06, my PC only scored a 3350 on the overall tests.. </s>
<s> If I do buy a new PC, I do want to see improvement in overall system performance, such as day to day stuff -- but also, in gaming as well. </s>
<s> I'm a little confused as to whats what these days, Intel has come out with several new CPU's since this one came out. </s>
<s> The Core 2 Duo is a bit confusing as they advertise as 1.87, 2.13, and so on.. And if they are truely faster, I'm very uncertain how much faster.. </s>
<s> Although, I do know my FSB is not as fast, nor is my memory speed, which is only 400 mhz and I believe the top is around 667 mhz at the moment.. </s>
<s> I'm not looking to plunk down $5000 for a new system, so Alien-***** is out... would appreciate any suggestions you guys might have. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> the low 3dmark06 is due to the graphics card. </s>
<s> your sony can't be upgraded to a core2duo, but it can probably accept a dual-core upgrade. </s>
<s> here are my suggestions: 1) call sony/visit tech support and see if your motherboard supports the pentium-d. if so, a pentium-d 945 is $170 (2 3.4ghz processors vs 1 3.6ghz) and would you give a boost in day-to-day activities. </s>
<s> You can eBay the 560J for about $80. </s>
<s> (if sony tech support is hard to contact, you can download cpu-z from http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php; if your mainboard chipset is i945 or i975 it *should* support a pentium-d.) 2) consider getting a 7900GS (about $180) or 7950GT (about $240) based video card. </s>
<s> you may have to upgrade your power supply for another $50. </s>
<s> 3) consider adding another 512mb to 1gb of ram if you have 2 free slots ($60-$120 or so). </s>
<s> for about $400 you'd have a pc that won't be very far behind today's curve and should keep you happy till next Christmas at least. </s>
<s> http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/referrer/srtest It is the company that lists the reqs on the sides of the boxes. </s>
<s> It scans your computer and gives you suggestions based on the game you want to play. </s>
<s> It can also detect errors in your hardware setup and gives links to get the newsest drivers for stuff. </s>
