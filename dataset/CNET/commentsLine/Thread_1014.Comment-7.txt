video card for editing.
maybe someone with experience in that field can.
switching to a mac for video is however an idea.
i do not have experience there either but have heard that video editing on a mac is much easier and less stressful.
check out why most of the professional video special effects are done with a mac.
also, check in the mac forum for what type mac is used and if you can swing the purchase.
