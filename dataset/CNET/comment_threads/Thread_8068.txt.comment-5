You can make it a basic or minimized system, disconnect all drives.
If the sound returns, then some fan or sound source can be located by &quot;ear&quot;.
Don't discount any &quot;resonance&quot; like metal contact, etc.. You can test the PSU alone by jumpering the wiring, Google PSU self-test, if the noise appears then you have your source.
Remember, no drives connected and only the PSU and PC case alone to power-ON should eliminate alot of stuff.
Testing the PSU alone also can be done.
If you can't find a source then, well you do have a mystery, maybe allow someone else to hear it.
Also, be sure no wiring is banging against any fans.
