<s> Hey guys. </s>
<s> I'm makin my own rig in a few months hopefully and my friend brought up a cool idea. </s>
<s> He was wondering if there was a type of CD Drive where you just insert the CD into like in a car. </s>
<s> I had never thought about that. </s>
<s> Is there such a thing for PCs? </s>
<s> Slot loading drives are known to have a little trouble with mini-media or smaller diameter CDs. </s>
<s> So there it is. </s>
<s> &quot;Slot loading.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> I haven't seen any available for the last few years. </s>
<s> Damn, that would of been real cool :/ More expensive but cool. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
