i want to burn dvds so that they play on dvd players these will contain still and video pictures.
we have a dell vostro with vista and a dell inspiron 6000 with xp.
the vostro has a dvd burner but dvds done on it may or may not work on players.
any suggestions for an external burner and software that will produce dvds that will reliably play on dvd players as well as on other computers???
thanks ed s
