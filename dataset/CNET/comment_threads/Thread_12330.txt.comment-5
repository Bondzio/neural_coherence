FAT32 can't read a filename of up to 255 characters like NTFS can.
In your home, you probably don't have a file much deeper than &quot;C:\Program Files\Someprogram\something\whatever&quot; which is only about 40 characters so you WILL have no problem.
Note this person is talking about a business.
A whole new story.
At my job, we have filenames over 200 characters, which isn't uncommon in a business environment.
If you are using a Win98 machine on our network, you won't be able to access many of our files.
Almost all of our &quot;shared&quot; files are over 150 characters.
