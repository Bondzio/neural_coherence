I'm very new at this so it has all been a steep learning curve.
I have swapped the IDE cables around and plugged the hard drive and cd in every combination I can think of - and as the hard drive keeps working - I'm guesssing the cables are fine.
I did discover that if I booted with the &quot;recovery CD-rom&quot; in the 'problem drive'- it worked fine - i.e.no reading problems.
If I cancelled to Dos I could get it to list (DIR) the contents of the CD (something that doesnt happen when going through the MS-Prompt from Windows - where it stil thinks the CD is empty) - so this leads me to think its a software problem.
I used the recovery cd to refresh &quot;windows OS&quot; but this has made no difference.
Shall I try reinstalling windows?
