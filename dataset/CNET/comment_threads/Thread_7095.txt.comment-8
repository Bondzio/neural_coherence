(Look at previous posts) i cant figure out wether it is the cpu or another thing that is wrong.
(logic suggests cpu since that is what i messed with) is it possible to shock a cpu and it still work for a while, and act like it is now?
Do you think that the new thermal paste is not doin its job causing it to overheat during intensive CPU use?
Please help, Tyler
