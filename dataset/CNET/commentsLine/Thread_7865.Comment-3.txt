thanks for your response.
i should add some more information, rookie error on my part.
the router is apparently very capable and has highly rated load balance between the 2.4 and 5ghz bands, hence why i got it.
i updated the stock firmware to the most recent which is version 3.0.0.4.260. we have two netgear wn3000rp dual band range extenders at opposite ends of the building from the main router, all of which run on separate channels (1, 7 and 11) for 2.4ghz connections.
currently the asus router handles all dhcp requests, although the range extenders are capable of doing this as well.
would you recommend that i offload some of the dhcp requests onto the extenders (which serve a significantly smaller number of machines)?
if not, i have some old linksys wag200g adsl routers that could probably be pressed into service, although they're obviously only b/g devices.
