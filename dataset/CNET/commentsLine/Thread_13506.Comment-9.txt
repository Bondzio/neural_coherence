i'm running zonealarm as well (on both the &quot;host&quot; computer and &quot;client&quot;) - and can access the shared printer without a problem.
you may want to try turning off za (briefly) on the client computer and trying to access to see if it makes a difference.
you can turn off za by right-clicking on the za icon in the system tray and selecting &quot;shutdown za.&quot; you may also want to check to make sure your home wireless network is in the trusted zone (double-click on the za icon in the system tray, click on the &quot;firewall&quot; tab/button on the left side of the za panel, then click on the &quot;zones&quot; tab).
