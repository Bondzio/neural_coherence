Problem: When I woke up one morning I always turn my monitor first and my computer second and go off to brush my teeth. Coming back, the monitor was still off it seems. I press the power button many times until I realized that the monitor is possibly broke. If I try to power on my monitor it will either do two things: After a few minutes without power when I press the power button it will make the kind of sound I always hear when its turn on but nothing else Or After a few minutes and pressing the power button I will create that sound and may turn the blue light for a few seconds then gone again. I know my graphic card isn't the problem since it doesn't matter if its plugged in or not and I don't feel like buying another 19&quot;(200$). I used my old computer's monitor on this computer to manage with my daily stuff. If you can help in any way, thanks. Wolf

For some reason they fix on the wrong port and there's no signal. I would need to use the input select button to make it go to the right port.

Thats what the repair man said and of course it will cost more than the monitor to repair so I just used my old 15&quot; and replace my other computer with my cousin's monitor. Also, he mention it was cause by electricity problems so my parents bought surge arrest. Over all, I suggest you buy another monitor and a surge protector(The power strip I had sucked).

Proffitt	2/16/08 7:20 AM	1.2031464E12	There are some models with issues.	http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7590_102-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=62739&messageID=744233 is a discussion about a model that was sold in the millions. As such I can't say it was a defect but given the sheer number of the units fielded it's population shows a failure that is common in that line. And it's sadly true that repairs are exceeding replacement costs. I doubt it was some AC power surge. Bob

It cost me way too much money to have to replace it after only a few years! I have had to purchase more than 3 &quot;replacement&quot; monitors for PCs in the past 15 years and I am tired of it. There needs to be something to protect us as consumers. When you purchase a product, you have to consider the replacment cost in with the original purchase price just so you know you're getting a good enough deal. If not, then don't buy. It's always after the warranty wears off. It's wrong and if enough people have this problem with the same monitor they should take care of replacing them. People need to keep this in mind before they buy an HP product. It's like we're all Beta testing products after purchasing them for full price and someone should consumers when companies like HP do this.

It was meant to imply, &quot;someone should protect consumers who are being ripped off by HP&quot;. It's a prevalent problem and I would be willing to participate in a class action suit against HP.

And just like always its faulty capacitors inside the monitor on the power control circuit. The repair guy is just trying to take an advantage of you. As for HP these is high failure piece and some pc's experience this as well. The older 325ST model pc had capacitors that would exblode on the motherboard. &quot;note explode by the tops bursting open and the insulators inside busting outwards&quot; This can be a cheap fix for you at radio shack for 6$. If you have a soldering iron it will only take 30 min to fix.

If and when it is successful, or not, I'll be sure to come back here and update. I really do appreciate your replies to my issue with this HP vs19b monitor. It was brilliant-- for the short time it worked anyway.

It is doing exactly the same thing as these other monitors. It goes black. If I turn it off...then back on...it will come on but only for 2-3 seconds. I bought it as a package and one month after the warranty expired...BAM! Dang it all...this ain't right! Any how...I took it apart according to this page ( http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7590_102-0.html?threadID=62739 ) but...I don't know for sure what I'm doing (not computer talented) Class action suit is what's needed...that's for sure. I emailed the CEO of HP with this problem awhile back. Good luck try'in to get a reply. Anyway...do you fix computers? I see where you offered another person to fix theirs. Anything to help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for your time on this matter.

I have taken the monitor apart-and can't really make heads or tails of what I'm seeing. (I am NOT smart in electronics etc)If you do fix monitors-how much would you charge and where do I send it? Oh? Since I have it opened can I send only the boards? Would that be ok? Thank you for your help!
1517	16	278610	3136410	3136401	aptivaa12	9/27/09 2:30 AM	1.2540186E12	HP Monitor	Take as many pics as you can of all boards and the monitor while you have it apart. Mainly the boards off the metal casing both sides of the pcb. Send to aptivaa12@yahoo.com I'll edit the photo to show you what caps are bad. This will prevent you from sending me a board that may not be damaged as well and save yourself some postage. But please make them as clear as possible. Thank You

Now I'm curious as to how many other electronic devices (i.e. LCD TVs) suffer from similar problems. I suppose now I'll be tearing apart any junk ones I happen upon for a while!
