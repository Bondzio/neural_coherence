1.1.1	I purchased a new iPad last week !	St
1.1.2	However , news today I read shows that in the next iPad event a more latest iPad is going to be released ! !	St
1.1.3	This is my first apple product , and one reason as to why I delayed buying the iPad in the first place .	St
1.1.4	My manager told me & quot ; they 're ALWAYS going to be updating the products & quot ; - so stop waiting ! !	St
1.1.5	Should I return the product ?	Ques
1.1.6	( despite using it in and out for a week !	St
1.1.7	) ; or just accept it and move on and enjoy my current ipad ?	Ques
1.1.8	( New ipad model ) Thank you	St
1.2.1	Yet folk still buy and use them .	St
1.2.2	If your worry is that it will be updated and not that you can use it then YES ! ! !	St
1.2.3	Return it since your issue is not about use but worry .	St
1.2.4	Return it and no more worry .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Since it was so soon , I probably would go ahead and return it .	St
1.3.2	But your manager is right in essence , if you always wait , you will never have one , the one you just bought probably would be useful for several years , depending on what you need to do with it .	St
1.3.3	Its like this with all tech.. My firm belief is get the best processor you can afford on comps , worry about the rest later , easy enough to expand the rest .	St
1.3.4	Tablets are different as most are really self contained units , what you buy is what you get , but it all depends on what you need it for .	St
1.3.5	Me , im looking for one that basically does two things 90 % of the time , stream a few movies and read books , the rest is play some music and hold a few files .	St
