<s> I am looking on eBay at a ready assembled desktop PC in a couple of different configurations all of which are designed around gaming. </s>
<s> I have a budget limit of $1050 and have run into a few questions regarding motherboard and case. </s>
<s> I will supply my own operating system, keyboard, mouse and screen. </s>
<s> The general build goes as follows: CPU - Ivy Bridge Intel i5 3570k RAM - 8gb DDR3 1333MHz HDD - 1gb SATA III Hard Drive Motherboard - B75M Pro OR for $50 more 4th Gen Z77 Pro DVDRW - Generic Case - Generic with 2 USB ports at the front OR Thermaltake V3 for $30 or V4 for $55 GPU - 1G GTX 660 Power supply - Generic 850W Here is the link - http://tinyurl.com/au4yacq </s>
<s> I see you read about the CPU for gaming. </s>
<s> I'll copy it again here. </s>
<s> &quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. </s>
<s> It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. </s>
<s> &quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html The video card might be changed. </s>
<s> I'd see how high I can go on this list. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html The PSU is something of a problem area. </s>
<s> Is it a single rail? </s>
<s> If not are you sure you won't exceed the Amperes of any rail? </s>
<s> Part of the reason of getting a single rail is for folk that don't want to learn about this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Case....get a mid tower. </s>
<s> &quot;Bling&quot; drives the price on these things.......how much 'bling' do you want? </s>
<s> For me a 20 buck generic works fine.....your call. </s>
<s> Mobo......get an atx......not a micro atx. </s>
<s> Brand.....I doubt it makes much difference. </s>
<s> Look at the features of both and see if something jumps at you. </s>
<s> Gpu.....I see you can get a Hd 7850 for about the same bucks. </s>
<s> That would be my choice. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply Bob, Yeah I initially was going to get an i7 just because I assumed it would be the best as its Intels highest chipset but the more I looked into it the less and less important it seemed to be for gaming purposes. </s>
<s> For HD video rendering and 3D modeling yeah sure, go the i7 but for gaming it just wasn't necessary I emailed the seller asking if he could supply a Radeon 7870 but if not unfortunately the options only go up to Radeon 7850. </s>
<s> Which is better out of the Radeon 7850 and GTX 660 (non Ti version). </s>
<s> I'm reading a lot of conflicting reviews I'm not sure with the PSU, I'm assuming they will look at the parts I will request and put in something that can handle it. </s>
<s> Surely they wouldn't give me a ****** PSU when the rest of the rig will be somewhat power hungry because when it melts 2 days after they supply it I'll just be returning it...obviously not what a business wants. </s>
<s> Don't the more expensive towers come with more/better fans? </s>
<s> This is going to run kinda warm isn't it? </s>
<s> So I want to keep it nice and cool. </s>
<s> I plan to game at full HD resolution with BF3 being my benchmark game. </s>
<s> Hoping to run it on ultra or near to that settings at 30+ fps. </s>
<s> Would you still reccomend the HD 7850 over the GTX 660 (non Ti version) for this resolution? </s>
<s> I see people are saying the HD 7550/7870 really come into their own element at higher resolutions than this but that full HD and under that the GTX 660 would be better? </s>
<s> Would you agree with that ? </s>
<s> Take the side cover off and then you won't need all those more/better/noisy fans. </s>
<s> Gpu......I think both those cards are pretty close.....since your cost is the same for either...... this might come down to splitting hairs. </s>
<s> I still opt for the Hd 7850.....more bandwidth. </s>
<s> It might be best to get the 2GB model if your planning on using max settings. </s>
