<s> On a Sony Viao desktop computer. </s>
<s> I took the heat difuser if the processor to clean dust out. </s>
<s> Put new heat sink compound on and re-installed. </s>
<s> Now computer will not begin to start but will stop and start again. </s>
<s> anyone have this problem? </s>
<s> We don't know your processor type or how the heat sink locks down on it but I'd bet dollars to donuts that you don't have good contact between the two. </s>
<s> Those cheesy plastic 1/4 turn locking mounts are the worst...if that's what you have. </s>
<s> You need the thermal compound evenly spread. </s>
<s> No gaps. </s>
<s> And you need the heat sink flush across the entire CPU with all mounts exerting even pressure. </s>
<s> If one mount pops up, heat transfer is severely compromised. </s>
<s> On top of Steven reply, you need to check these areas of concern. </s>
<s> Applying compound need not be too much. </s>
<s> Also, the cpu surface should be 100% cleaned before application. </s>
<s> Smear the compound out and then re-attach the HSF to it. </s>
<s> As explained by Steven, if applied wrong or at a slight angle, etc., it may not have full contact. </s>
<s> Any ducting is in place as it should be. </s>
<s> Any wiring(fan or sensor) re-connected, etc..Also, don't over-tighten screws as well. </s>
<s> Since, you know its related to the previous work you did, it needs to be rechecked. </s>
