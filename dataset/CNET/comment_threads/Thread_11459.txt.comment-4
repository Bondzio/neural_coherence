Adding options or rather the whole pkg.
maybe more than 1 step.
If a menu comes up and offers yet other options, look into that to correct the pop-up.
If no action taken or there's a possible [X] box in the pop-up to check-off that annoyance as you don't use that scanning portion or otherwise just install it if its an unfinished complete install sorta thing.
