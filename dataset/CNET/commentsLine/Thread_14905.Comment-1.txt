i just recently built my own pc.
i bought the dfi 648fx-ale motherboard, and a pentium 4 2.6ghz w\800mhz front side bus speed procesor.
the motherboard can support an 800mhz fsb speed, yet when i run pcmark04 it reads my fsb bus speed as 200mhz.
i cannot find anywhere in the bios where to change it, and i do not believe my motherboard has any fsb speed jumpers.
i would hate to think that my pc is running alot slower than it could thank you for your help.
ohh yeah i have phoenix bios.
