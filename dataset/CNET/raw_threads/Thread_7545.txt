It is 3.5&quot; and has 7200RPM, 250GB, 16MB cache, and is SATA II. Please help me by answering the following. Just give me a one word answer unless you have additional advice/recommendations. 1.)Which is better: A or B? (Note that I will be getting a powerful drive listed above). A.)An aluminum enclosure with a fan but has no vent holes except for where the fan is located. B.)An aluminum enclosure with no fan but has several vent holes around the case. 2.)Which is better: A or B? A.)An aluminum enclosure that fits tightly but has no fan and not many or no vent holes. B.)An aluminum enclosure with a fan but has alot of extra space inside the enclosure because the enclosure can also fit a 5.25&quot; drive? My drive is 3.5&quot;. 3.)I am looking for a hard drive enclosure with the following specification. Any recommendations (note: must meet all specifications below)? - Brand name - SATA II - Aluminum - Has a good fan - Has vent holes - Prevents vibration/shock - Quiet fan - Good chipset - Internal: SATA, External: USB

Let me note this item you listed &quot;Prevents vibration/shock&quot;. That would have to include a sensor to tell the drive to park. Outside of a few laptops nothing has this. You may see such in a few years but not today. Best of luck, Bob

Not sure it makes anything faster with a 3.0GB SATA as the max USB 2.0 transfer rate is limited to 480Mb/s. This one might work ...if you can find it in stock http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817145390

But for the right price...I'm sure someone could add shock sensors and maybe even shock absorbers. Only problem it would be so expensive, no one would buy. VAPCMD

While admirable for the list, to prevent such shocks and more, the unit would almost need to have Artificial Intelligence with video sensors and legs to move out of the way of an oncoming collision.
