1.1.1	I currently have 4gb of DDR2 ram , and an ATI Radeon 4650 HD , and I wanted to know if i can upgrade it to 8gb DDR3 ram or stick with DDR2 , and also , to what GPU can I get the motherboard to .	St
1.1.2	I have a 2.33 GHZ Quad Core , and my power supply is a Micronics 230W .	St
1.1.3	I play games such as the AC series , Tomb Raider amongst others , high motion games .	St
1.1.4	2 hours ago Also , I want to know if i will need to upgrade my power source	St
1.2.1	I 'd say do nothing .	St
1.2.2	There are posts about which list to check but in this case not only would you be in for a new GPU but without a new PSU I 'd not touch this .	St
1.2.3	I 'd leave this alone .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	But if i upgrade my PSU to say , 500 watts ?	Ques
1.4.1	Because you might get some dual or triple rail PSU and that would be no upgrade .	St
1.4.2	http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html is the usual list .	St
1.4.3	And look at the rating needed and then again , unless you know your Amperes , you get a single rail of the rated value .	St

1.5.1	So i guess it 's better to buy a new PC than to try and improve my current one	St
1.6.1	But it wo n't affect frame rates in games .	St
1.6.2	If you found this old PC with say a 5400 RPM drive , for cheap I could fit a 7200 RPM drive and the improved boot and load times could have the owner happy for a bit .	St
1.6.3	The 230W PSU is just too low to consider any card on the list .	St
1.6.4	And without knowing which 500W you have so I can check rails , I ca n't be sure it will do .	St
1.6.5	That 's one reason why you hear folk asking for a single rail .	St
