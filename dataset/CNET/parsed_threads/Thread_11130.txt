<s> Hello everyone, I am building a new system with a MSI 939 socket motherboard and Athlon 64 CPU, 2GB Ram, 256 MB video etc. </s>
<s> It will be rather high grade system from what I have owned previously. </s>
<s> It was suggested to me to purchase a high grade power supply. </s>
<s> The Enermax 660 Watt PSU was recommended. </s>
<s> It looks to be a heavy duty unit. </s>
<s> What are your thoughts on the Enermax 660 watt PSU? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Greetings from Canada. </s>
<s> Hi, I belive that you made a good choice. </s>
<s> A 660 watt power supply will power all your components and you won't get any power hiccups due to a low watt power supply. </s>
<s> Also a high watt power supply will surport newer hardware that demand more power, if you decide to upgrad in the future... </s>
<s> I have always recommended the Antec and Enermax psus. </s>
<s> They have provided decent service if a good match is found the more wattage the better. </s>
<s> However, Enermax also makes I believe the PowerMax series of psus and is trying to leviate those models to a premium level which it maybe, but generally if you have the wattage and build-in cooling most do well. </s>
<s> If you like the bells and whistles sorta thing, remember that is usally just that it really do much to cool or maintain a stable output, so look beyond LED lites, dials, and too fancy cabling. </s>
<s> I suggest it should have at least 2 fans for best operation, the quieter the better. </s>
