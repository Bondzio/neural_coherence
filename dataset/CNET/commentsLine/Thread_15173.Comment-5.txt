good question.
just that it is the latest thing and i'd like to try it.
i like the adaptability of having the lightness of a tablet when i browse the internet in a coffee shop, or watch a movie on the train, then the ability to connect it to a keyboard at my desk when i need to write a big word file.
i may either settle on another small laptop, or hold out for the windows 8 tablets coming out within 2 months, eg the samsung ativ smart pc (which is a large monster, am assuming there will be smaller win8 tablet offers)
