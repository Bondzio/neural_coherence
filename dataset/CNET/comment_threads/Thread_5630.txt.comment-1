I took a glance at my old motherboard, and I noticed that it has some DDR RAM in it.
The pink sticker (this was a built computer, so the various parts have pink stickers labeling them) says it's PC266 32x64 256MB DDR RAM.
I was wondering... could I possibly use this in conjunction with my PC3200 512MB DDR RAM?
I checked out the slot with the 256 stick, and it'd fit in there if I put it in, but I don't know if it's compatible with the motherboard, or maybe with the other RAM.
Two other things about the 512 stick - it's Kingston, and it's 184 pin (the 256 probably is 184, too, because it fits).
My new motherboard is an ASUS K8N motherboard, AMD processor, etc.
More info needed, please ask.
Thanks, -Christopher
