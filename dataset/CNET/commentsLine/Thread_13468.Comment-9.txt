thank you everyone for your suggestions.
it helped me to narrow down my choice to buy the 'kit' rams.
the deal i found from vapcmd's link turned out to be the best: kit dual channel ram - 2 x 1gb, ddr2 800, 240 pin, 1.8v, 5-5-5-18 latency, heat spreader: comes to around $65 (after rebates, incl shipping).
here is the link:  thanks again!
