I had a few issues with my Belkin router, and not really knowing what I was doing, I fiddled around and enable the &quot;configure router as access point&quot; option. I now have an issue where some, but not all, wired devices can access the internet, and I've no WiFi access at all. This is only temporary, as I'm getting a new Wireless N modem/router from my ISP, but this won't be for approx 4 weeks. In the meantime, how can I log onto the router's settings and disable the access point only? The previous IP of 192.168.1.0 has now been altered. Current setup: Scientific Atlanta EPC2100 cable modem Belkin F5D8236-4 router PC (Vista &amp; Ubuntu GNU/Linux)- able to connect over ethernet on both OS's PS3 - able to connect over ethernet laptop (XP) - unable to connect either with or without network switch (shared with below) laptop (OSX) - unable to connect either with or without network switch (shared with above). Any thoughts?

How can I find the IP address? Using ipconfig in windows (or ifconfig in Ubuntu) will only show my modem's WAN IP - not my router's LAN IP - suggested (as I suspect &quot;access mode&quot; implies) that the connection is effectively bypassing the routing function entirely, and treating the router as a simple (if quite expensive) ethernet switch. Does anyone have any experience of using a Belkin F5D8236, or indeed of switching off access-point mode in any router once enabled?
