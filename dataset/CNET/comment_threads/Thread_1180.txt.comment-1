well this really does suck.
i opened up my compaq sr1000v to find out that theres no agp slot!
i can see that theres holes for one but theres not one to be seen.
theres everything needed to have one (the holes, space, and the removable metal slide on the case) but theres not one in site!
can i just add one, get a slot from a different computer and hammer it in the holes, or even buy the slot and put it in?
a reply would be GREATLY apprieciated thank you
