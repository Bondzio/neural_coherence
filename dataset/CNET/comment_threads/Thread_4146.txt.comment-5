So if I was to go the &quot;cable select&quot; route rather than master/slave, the cable select would be selected on both drives?
How does the system know which drive to boot from?
Another issue I have thought of is the fact that I have a USB keyboard that is not &quot;active&quot; until I actually choose a profile.
Is this going to cause problems?
