1.1.1	completing my question first: ....wiring in a building rather than dedicated ethernet hard wiring or wireless?	St
1.1.2	I know baby alarms can use the 240volt mains (with a modulated signal thro a transformer or somesuch) !	St
1.1.3	Anyone know of any kit which will do it - big savings in a larger building!	St
1.1.4	andy	St
1.2.1	AC Powerline networking is what it is called and the makers cover the limitations and more than I can write here.	St
1.2.2	It's not any savings in the cost of the gear over the cost of the Ethernet for us.	St
1.2.3	That is we can run the Ethernet for less than the AC Powerline network gear.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yes, there are AC type networking devices.	St
1.3.2	For whatever reason they never really caught on, if they're still available, you need to search for them.	St
1.3.3	if you do find them, then get what you need, because you may not find replacements.	St
1.3.4	Maybe, that's why they're not big networking setups using them.	St
1.3.5	the cost isn't any cheaper though the h/w is easy, you still need to s/w setup.	St
1.3.6	Also, i suppose there is a safety issue, but I haven't heard of anything negative on that for now.	St
1.3.7	I suspect wifi setups easily win against AC networks due to far easier install/setup.	St
1.3.8	http://www.pcworld.com/article/85003/just_plug_it_in_networking_via_power_circuits.html tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	Thanks for link - in our case an ethernet cable is being quoted at &#163;500 due to length and building complexity so mains route may well be economical.	St
1.4.2	I'll need to find out if the mains sockets both have to be on the same ring main or if just being on the same distribution board will do!	St
1.4.3	andy	St
1.5.1	Asking the question about the mains cost us more than trying it.	St
1.5.2	Here, an off the shelf powerline bridge is 50USD and asking the question cost more than that once you pay employees or the electrical contractor to see if it is or is not.	St
1.5.3	Hope this speeds things up.	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
