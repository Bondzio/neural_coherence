<s> Windows XP Professional SP3 After a failed installation of anti-virus software, my mouse stopped working. </s>
<s> Its Properties say &quot;Windows cannot start this hardware because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged (Code 19).&quot; Troubleshooter instructs me to uninstall the device, after which Windows searches for Plug and Play devices. </s>
<s> It then says, &quot;This Troubleshooter is unable to solve your problem.&quot; Attempting to update the driver using the Hardware Update Wizard results in the following message: &quot;The Wizard cannot find a better match for your hardware than the software you currently have installed.&quot; </s>
<s> I'm confused. </s>
<s> Is this failing mouse a USB device and you are looking for a compatible PS/2 mouse? </s>
<s> I've never seen that type of message with a PS/2 mouse. </s>
<s> The mouse is designated in Device Manager as &quot;PS/2 Compatible Mouse&quot;. </s>
<s> I've seen this message when a bum filter driver was installed. </s>
<s> Logitech issued a how to remove it but today we see malware and registry cleaners create this problem. </s>
<s> Try the easy fix first. </s>
<s> Boot SAFE MODE, head to device manager and remove the device there. </s>
<s> On reboot we hope it will straighten it out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> I've already tried that and nothing changes. </s>
<s> Logitech had some issues years ago. </s>
<s> Lesson? </s>
<s> Don't install mouse and keyboard drivers. </s>
<s> Read http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Mice-and-Trackballs/Optical-mouse-driver-Win-Vista/m-p/239914/highlight/true?nobounce= Today MALWARE can cause this. </s>
<s> Read GRIF's advice at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6121_102-0.html?threadID=378815&tag=forums06;forum-threads </s>
<s> Thanks for those two links, Bob. </s>
<s> I don't think the Logitech issue applies in this case. </s>
<s> As I understand it, that was about a Logitech optical mouse that was installed and conflicts that occurred with something called SetPoint in a Vista environment. </s>
<s> My mouse was manufactured by Microsoft; underneath it says, &quot;Intellimouse Serial and PS/2 Compatible&quot;. </s>
<s> Any drivers that are installed on my system are Windows XP's native drivers. </s>
<s> I downloaded the malware scanners recommended on the other page to which you referred me, and scanned my system. </s>
<s> A few suspect items were detected and deleted or quarantined, but it hasn't solved my mouse problem. </s>
<s> I would like to suggest you to get replaced your mouse then check the result. </s>
<s> If it doesn't work so I think you need to consult with any hardware specialist. </s>
<s> I have tried four different mice and none works. </s>
<s> I do not believe there is anything wrong with the mouse I am using or that my actual hardware is the source of this problem. </s>
<s> As the message in Device Manager says, &quot;Windows cannot start this hardware because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged (Code 19).&quot; This indicates to me that the problem is with corrupt or incorrect data on my computer. </s>
<s> As for hiring a hardware specialist, I think that would cost me more than my computer is worth. </s>
<s> The CODE 19 is the clue here. </s>
<s> This code has been seen on other mice when the driver messed up. </s>
<s> Sadly some will want an exact fit when I supply a link. </s>
<s> This may be possible but since this is all volunteer I limit my searches to close enough examples. </s>
<s> -&gt; What I try next is to unplug all the mice and boot SAFE MODE. </s>
<s> Try it with just one mouse and in SAFE MODE head to the device manager and uninstall all mice found. </s>
<s> On the next boot Windows will redetect compatible mice and hopefully cures it. </s>
<s> The logitech code 19 often resulted in reloading the OS. </s>
<s> And beyond the setpoint the mouse filter drivers were causing CODE 19 and other issues. </s>
<s> That history is well, history. </s>
<s> I learned to avoid installing such but let's think about today's malware. </s>
<s> A keyboard+mouse logger could create this problem. </s>
<s> It's why we can't discount malware. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This error seems like windows registery file corrupted. </s>
<s> I think you should repair windows thank you may be fix this problem. </s>
<s> Thanks, but I do not know exactly where any corruption might be located, or how to repair Windows short of reinstalling it. </s>
