That's a sign of deeper problems such as power.
Since you built it, then it's likely you get to fix it.
No one may be able to get this to work with the sticks of RAM you have.
To get it to work, you would fit the monster power supply (try 550 or 650 Watts) so you know that's not the issue, have the latest BIOS or don't complain and then use 1GB memory sticks of the make/model that the motherboard maker lists as compatible.
Remember that some boards have odd requirements for pairs of sticks to get better memory access.
