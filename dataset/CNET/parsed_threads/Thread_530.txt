<s> Don't buy the 988 if you expect to get a rebate! </s>
<s> I purchased an FP988D through Tiger Direct in November, submitted the rebate forms immediately, and 5 months later have yet to recieve my $90. </s>
<s> I've spoken with TY, the head of their rebate department, he's a *@#%!? </s>
<s> liar, not mention his &quot;Flaming&quot; temper when I called him on his lies. </s>
<s> Bottom Line - the monitor will cost you $90 more than the advertised price - buy a reputable brand from from a reputable vendor! </s>
<s> I had the exact same problem. </s>
<s> No rebate for me either on my fuji monitor from Tigerdirect. </s>
<s> I will never shop at tigerdirect.com again. </s>
<s> They offer great rebates on everything but you must pay more in advance and hope you get your rebate. </s>
<s> I'll just pay an extra $20 next time somewhere else to avoid the hassle and risk of the rebate. </s>
<s> I sent in a meticulously filled out rebate form to Fuji on 12/13/2005. </s>
<s> It's now May 21st, 2006, and I've yet to receive it. </s>
<s> Rebates are a scam! </s>
<s> All it took was 2 phone calls and the check was in the mail Knowing this delay I would buy again with this large rebate. </s>
<s> I BROUGHT THIS MONITOR FROM E-COST 6 MONTHS AGO WAITING FOR RERATE.NOTHING ?I SEND 2 E-MAIL.1 LETTER TO FUJIPLUS AND REPORT TO E-COST NOTHING HAPPEN EVEN A REPLY.SO I CALL IT A SCAM. </s>
