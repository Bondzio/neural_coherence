1.1.1	I've just moved to Elements 4.0 and when I try to import from my HP 5370c scanner I get the preview to come up but it won't give me the scan button.	St
1.1.2	If I start Scanjetpro on it's own the scan button is there but Elements isn't listed in the Scan To box.	St
1.1.3	Any ideas?	St
1.1.4	THX HRW	St
1.2.1	And place the results where the other programs can use them.	St
1.2.2	Why this happens.	St
1.2.3	In XP the &quot;WIA&quot; driver may not be done well or compliant.	St
1.2.4	You'll have to try HP for an update or change scanners.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
