my oldest computer has lasted for 18+ years, and the psu died recently (18+ years) and all of the hardware (excluding my 2007 hard drive, and 2007 dvd burner) have been around for 18+ years.
i'm just doing some diagnostics on my hsing tech m912 v1.7 motherboard & 230w standard at psu to check and see which part is dead.
i'm planning to buy a new power supply so that i can actually get this machine up and running again.
the motherboard only has 7 isa 8/16-bit slots and 3 vlb 32-bit for video cards.
the hardware i have installed are: winbond i/o card isa, sound blaster 16 pnp isa, s3 trio64 bahamas 64 paradise 2mb vlb video card, amd am486 dx4-120 processor, 24mb simm-72 memory, acer al1917w 19&quot; widescreen lcd monitor, logitech keyboard hooked up with a ps/2 to at keyboard adapter, and that's about it.
the psu is an lsi fr-230w at psu with the flip-switch, the hard drive is a wdc wd800jb 80gb hard drive with ontrack dynamic drive overlay installed (since the award bios doesn't support hard drives larger than 8.4gb), and the dvd burner is a lite-on dvd rw lh-18a1p.
the one problem my system has is it does turn on but it doesn't post (power-on self-test), there is no video, no beeps, or anything else, except the hard drive powers on, the dvd burner powers on, and the heatsink fan turns on, and so does the psu fan, not the motherboard.
i tested the psu to see what the problem was, and i believe there was too much dust on the power supply board.
here are the specs: hsing tech m912 v1.7 motherboard logitech keyboard sound blaster 16 pnp isa winbond i/o isa card s3 trio64 bahamas 64 paradise vlb video card lsi fr-230 standard at psu wdc wd800jb hard drive with ontrack(r) dynamic disk overlay (32gb windows 98se, 42.5gb data) lite-on dvd rw lh-18a1p dvd burner 24mb simm-72 memory amd am486 dx4-120 processor i tested the psu with the switch at 115v; the psu thought it was at 230v (3a), but when i set the voltage switch to 230v, the system doesn't power on.
i used a voltage meter to test the connections, but the wires that connect to the voltage switch must have bad wiring due to aging and brown outs.
this never occured to me with any of the computers i had in the past to today.
as for the motherboard, i tested the connections that the psu connects to, and everything is all perfect.
this pc was sitting in my back room for a long time since 1999 after we got a pentium-class (amd k6-2/300) computer, which lasted for 10 years; the processor shorted out and the motherboard was fried.
does anyone know if its either the motherboard that's dead or the psu?
i'd say an average is at least 20 years, if someone is lucky to have an old ibm xt pc from the 1980s.
