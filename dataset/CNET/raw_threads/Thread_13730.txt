I just thought someone should start a new thread to corner all the Dell lovers in one place. So, go ahead - jump around and shout &quot;Dell&quot;&quot;Dell&quot;&quot;Dell&quot;! Pat each other on the back! Make new friends who share your opinion! Don't hold anything back! This is your big chance, so knock yourselves out! W.W.
