Hi - yes I came across the site as I was looking for instructions for dismantling - I was led to it by another one by this guy : http://mywebpages.comcast.net/macdan/tibook_display.html His advice on how to remove the display bezel was spot on and I managed to get mine of without any damage at all.
I have to say I was originally intending to send just the screen off, but thought I could save a bit by trying to do it myself.
Am waiting for a new stainless steel hinge from the powerbookguy - then all I have to do is source suitable glues.
In the meantine I have managed to identify the part - it isn't actually referred to in the ifixit guide, but through a process of elimination I have determined where it goes, partly supported by the ifixit picture of the modem board.....
Thanks again!
!
