that does not connect to the internet, just get a switch, have all computers connected to that switch, and make all computers part of the same work group, and assign each computer a fixed ip address that is in the same sub net ie 10.10.26.1 - x and use a mask of 255.255.255.0 dont worry about the dns settings, leave blank then you can map drives between them and see all of them using the browse network icon.
