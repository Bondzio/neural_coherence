<s> Hello, I am looking for a best I/O Card to watch TV Channels on my computer can you please suggest the best brand and the product for this purpose. </s>
<s> Yes if there is any external card please also advice. </s>
<s> Thanks and regards. </s>
<s> Since you're asking about a card, I'll assume you have a desktop. </s>
<s> Most of the desktop cards are PCI, which should work in pretty much any current system. </s>
<s> The two big names are ATI and Hauppauge, but there are many others. </s>
<s> As with anything else, what's &quot;best&quot; depends on what you can afford, your current hardware and operating system, etc. </s>
<s> Rather than reinvent the wheel, I suggest you simply Google &quot;PCI TV tuner&quot; and read some review sites, such a CNET's here: http://reviews.cnet.com/tv-adapters/ Good luck! </s>
<s> Thanks alot..for the support. </s>
<s> really appreicate Thanks and regards </s>
