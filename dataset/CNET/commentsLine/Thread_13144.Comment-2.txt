thankfully my hard drive was still under warranty and maxtor is sending me a new one immediately.
when i told the maxtor tech support my issues with the drive, he immediately suggested that there was in fact, a defect with the drive.
so if you have a hard drive that is sending out the same signals, pray that you're under warranty!
