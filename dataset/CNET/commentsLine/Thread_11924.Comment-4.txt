1. are you freaking kidding me?
the 8500 pro is like 6 years old.
whoever told you it is still a good card must be smoking crack, or you read an article 6 years ago saying it was good.
2. if you're not going to game, and not going to do any graphics work, you don't need a dedicated graphics card.
chances are, the lag is because of out-of-date drivers.
3. if you want a card that badly, pick up an x1650 xt for about $50.
ps.
nowadays, video ram isn't everything.
it used to be everything back in the old days of descent and dos.
