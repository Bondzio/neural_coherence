Dear Sir/Madam, I have just completed the home build of my own computer: Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-965P-DS3/S3 CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo HDD: Samsung HD400LD - IDE Video Card: GeForce 8500GT CD/DVD: Lite-On Corp - LH-20A1S - SATA (Pwr+Data) Monitor: Samsung SyncMaster 2032bw (DVI) PSU: Akasa - AK-P050 FG8 So far these are the only components connected.
All seems OK during BIOS and POST and I have set Bootup to First CDROM, Second HDD, Third Floppy.
My problem is at end of BIOS and all details are on monitor BOOT FROM CD/DVD is indicated, the Windows Vista Office Home and Student 2007 installation disk is active and runs on my CD/DVD drive for 1 minute and slows down eventually stopping.
There is no error message on screen, only BOOT FROM CD/DVD: and nothing else.
I have tried changing many enable/disable functions in BIOS with no changes.
I have verified both drives and they run, all fans run, LEDs all active.
There is something I'm missing!
Any help appreciated.
