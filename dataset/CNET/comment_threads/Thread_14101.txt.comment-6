Your concept machine will cost 2X what you can get today with top notch performance.
Since you paid 1/2 the price you can sock the money away to replace it with something 4 to more times better then.
I've seen people attempt your path and their attitude soars and flames in about a year as their leading edge machine is eclipsed.
Just sharing I've seen this too many times and hope to dissaude you.
