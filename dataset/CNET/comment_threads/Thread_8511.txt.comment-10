Guessing here...... Unscrew the utmost top 2 screws and the lower bottom two outward screws.
Does it loosen.
The very corners probably have a sliding post, once screws are loose, they are only there to keep corners in, though I'm guessing no actual lock downs of some sort.
If anything the 4 center screws that are following the printed outline are the fan screws.
Of course, you can loosen all other screws but fan screws and see what happens.
use gentle deft force at all times, don't break it.
