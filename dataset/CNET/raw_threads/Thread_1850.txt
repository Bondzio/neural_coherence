This machine has a built in air card [Verizon Sierra CDMA2000, wireless standard - CDMA 1xEVDO, type- WAN, antenna - Ultra connect, Frequency- 800MHz/1.9GHz, wireless implementation (form factor) - Mini-PCIe]. Can this be programmed for the Sprint network? If so where can I find the data for programming? Thank you, Jim G.
