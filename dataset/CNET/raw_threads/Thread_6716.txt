(cnet wireless lan card lost). How can I fix this problem. The router is fine on the other computers. I am a novice so anyhelp would be good and an 800 number would be good to call cnet also. thanks m

Also, the person who sold you the cards should offer this support. I'd love to note more about this issue, but you haven't followed the forum tip. It reads: &quot;If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; The laptop make/model as well as the models of the cards, the OS involved are needed to get a clue. Some have this issue and it's just the WAP's firmware was never updated. Give google.com and the supplier a try or fill in the information blanks to see if this forum can help. Bob
