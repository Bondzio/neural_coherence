1. you lose the use of a pci slot for every pci express x16 card inserted.
2. worst case scenario is that if you go with 2 video cards in sli, you will be left with one pci slot and one pci-e x4 slot.
this usually is not a problem for sli gamers who really only need pci for a good sound card.
everything else, excpet maybe a dial-up modem, is integrated into the motherboard.
if you need more expandability, use the pci-e x4 slot or external hardware via usb or firewire.
