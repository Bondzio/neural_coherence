sorry to resurrect this topic but i'm trying to get this mouse working again, so i'm thinking of testing it with regular aa batteries.
are you sure it won't damage anything if i pop in regular aa batteries into the mouse (i believe the model number is logitech mx500) instead of using the rechargeable batteries that came with it?
this person put regular batteries in their phone that normally takes rechargeable batteries and the regular batteries ended up melting, so i'm worried about that:
