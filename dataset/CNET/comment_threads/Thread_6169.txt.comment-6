in how they can be configured.
First off, I'd be creating a user account other than the administrator account.
You didn't mention whether or not you used a password.
Always create a username giving it a password and make sure the same is configured on both machines.
If you haven't tried already, you can disable the firewall on both to see if that's part of the issue.
