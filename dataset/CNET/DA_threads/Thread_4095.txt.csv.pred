1.1.1	Hey .	St
1.1.2	I got this computer a year ago for Christmas for a few hundred bucks .	St
1.1.3	It has Linux installed on it , but after seeing I was n't compattable with Linux I intalled WindowsXP .	St
1.1.4	Since then , everything has been a bit sluggish .	St
1.1.5	I believe someone told me to get a new CPU ?	Ques
1.1.6	And I know I need some RAM .	St
1.1.7	However , my problem is , i 'm completely oblivious to computer hardware .	St
1.1.8	I do n't know a damn thing about it .	St
1.1.9	= ( This is the information from my system control pannel .	St
1.1.10	Computer : VIA Samuel 2 801 HMz 112 MB of RAM I have playback issues with particular movies I download .	St
1.1.11	They 're skip and jump , sound does n't match up with video .	St
1.1.12	I heard my processor was too slow for this job , and that I would be best off getting an Intell Pentium III .	St
1.1.13	Also I was told I need a stick of 215MB of RAM , or something along those lines .	St
1.1.14	Anyway , what i 'm trying to get at is , I need to speed up my computer .	St
1.1.15	When I play games , the graphics are really bad , I do n't know if that also is my CPU or if I need to buy a graphics card .	St

1.1.17	Seriously , any information will help..	St
1.2.1	My Via Cyrix 733MHz is below that , but I put on 512MB of RAM and it plays DVDs fine .	St
1.2.2	That 128MB RAM is about 1/2 what I would try for DVD playback .	St
1.2.3	Also , not a word in your post about OS , etc so go get a GEEXBOX ( hint : google.com ) CD and see if that plays your DVD .	St
1.2.4	I do n't offer any support for this since it 's all documented on the web .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thing is , GeeXBoX runs under Linux , where as I have WinXP .	St
1.3.2	I only stated I had Linux previously installed just incase that would effect anything .	St
1.4.1	And it 's all of 6.1 MB download .	St
1.4.2	The OS , the DVD player and more on a bootable CD with only 6.1 MB .	St
1.4.3	It 's a simple test to see if your hardware can play a DVD .	St
