i could tell a story about a company the went down in flames since their product idea relied on their concept of how nn (network neighborhood) worked.
frankly, nn is less than reliable.
there are many arcane rules about how it works, when it populates and when it forgets.
the time between refreshes is from 10 minutes to weeks and is somewhat configurable.
to work around all this i just use the net view command line.
it's a minor skill you should work on.
-&gt; then again, you could have a firewall installed.
