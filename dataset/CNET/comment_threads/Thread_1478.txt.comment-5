Believe me you can do alot better on a case.
If you are really pressed for cash,, there are alot of cases on the cheap.
I remembered 2 weeks ago I saw a Thermaltake Soprano for like $80 and that is a great case.
Processor wise, I would not get the AMD X2 4800+, It's expensive and can get the 3800+ for alot cheaper, you save more than $400 if you do opt for the 3800+.
If you do get the 3800+, the $600 can get you a video card.
I say you get the 6800 which is cheap and you can add an second one later on your motherboard.
That costs about $200.
The remaining 400 can get you an 2 optical drives ( there was a sony dvd burner for $60), more ram and I say go up to 2 gb for excellent performance( of course you can go all out for 4gb later).
I haven't done the exact calculations but you should have just enough for a good pair of 2.1 speakers (if you get the 3800+ and the Soprano case).
