It has the visual feeling and responsiveness of Mac OS 10 yet with the robust performance of windows, infact i really think microsoft has copied alot of the graphic design for vista and office 2007 from the mac operating system. However there are some major problems u should consider b4 installing Vista: Firslty i recommend you use the dual boot system so u can boot back to XP to uninstall or change programs that don't work in in vista - and alot of programs don't work well on vista. Expect up to 3 hrs for install of vista, better to clean install rather than upgrade. 1. Install it on a large hard drive - it requires 15G just for the op system, and don't use paritions - 6. Vista freaks out with stupid warning promtps when you copy and paste between partitions - so don't use them 2. Have at least 1 G of ram 3. Uninstall all Norton symantec products esp norton internet security before installing upgrade of vista. It completely srews vista up and is hard to unistall from vista,esp the firewall - I use trend micro pccillin 2007 for vista 4. DISABLE USER ACCOUNTS CONTROL - this feature is stupid and so annoying in vista - its meant to stop uncontrolled use of programs from hacker and adware but i mean most good firewalls stop this anyways. These terrible prompts that come up all the time when u run programs - disable this 5. Cute FTP and WSFTp don't work on vista yet!

CuteFTP is reported to work.	http://www.google.com/search?q=Cute+FTP+and+WSFTp+don%27t+work+on+vista+yet%21&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=mozilla&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial finds reports it does. However what I found was the owner was flumoxed by firewall or other settings. Here's a thought. Ask in Cnet's Vista forum. Bob

That being said, I have only seen about 4 programs that will not install on Vista as of yet. Obviously, I dont use every program ever made, so there will be lots more. 2. It did not take me 3 hours to install, it took me less than 1 hour. 3. True, Symantec products cause some grief in vista. 4. User Accounts Control should not be disabled. Relying completely on a firewall or antivirus software is just asking for an infection. I'm not trying to flame, but I cannot stand people making suggestions without doing research.

Did you say the &quot;visual feeling and responsiveness&quot; of MacOS [I agree with you on that one] and the *reliability* of Windows&quot;? Yeesh! I remember memory leak testing an application once, and being told that the leak wasn't significant enough to fix. I asked my boss why he thought it was worth fixing, and he replied: &quot;Which platform are we designing this for?&quot;. &quot;32-bit Windows&quot; I replied. He then did a quick multiplication of the amount of memory that was leaking per day by the average number of days between blue-screens on our NT test rigs and said: &quot;Well, a hard reboot should release a few megs back onto the heap before that becomes a problem, shouldn't it?&quot;
