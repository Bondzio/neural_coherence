<s> ok so im looking to purchase a 320GB Western Digital SATA Hard Drive(Retail - Includes SATA cable).. i will also be pairing this with the Gigabyte DS3R P35 Motherboard (has 8 SATA slots).. do i need to buy some kind of Adapter in order to use this SATA Hard Drive? </s>
<s> I'm not really knowledgable with this at all =/ What exactly can i do with a SATA hard drive that gives it an advantage over the old IDE style? </s>
<s> Ive been reading about people saying that you need a SATA adapter and all kinds of cables in order to run a SATA hard drive.. any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks </s>
<s> You don't need anything with an SATA HDD and that MB. </s>

<s> so why do i see people talking about getting a SATA adapter? </s>
<s> I dont understand why you would need a SATA adapter.. what is the use of one of these? </s>
<s> and also what are the cons to having a SATA HDD compared to the old IDE HDD's? </s>
<s> As VAPCMD said you don't need on that board because it's new. </s>
<s> People with older boards may need adaptors for the SATA power connector, or a PCI SATA card if they don't have onboard SATA connectors. </s>
<s> There are no con's to SATA HDD's, they are faster. </s>
<s> Older systems may need SATA drivers on floppy disk to install XP. </s>
<s> Your board SATA can be set in bios to IDE mode, so you don't need to worry about the driver for XP. </s>
<s> think about the circumstances and options for just a moment. </s>
<s> Bet you can ... VAPCMD </s>
