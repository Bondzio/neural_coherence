If someone could tell me if they are ok or not it would be appreciated. Athlon 2800 Barton 256 GeForce fx5600XT TV out 1*GA-7vt600pl, viakt600, 5 * PCI, 3 * DDR 400, agp8X. 6USB2, SATA, LAN 80 GB Hard Drive 512 Ram DVD Burner Windows XP Home creative live 5.1 FDD Belkin Wireless keyboard mouse bundle 2 years parts and labour. Is there anything in there that i should change, was thinking about maybe a 3000 processor. The system will mainly be used for the net, study and very few games. Thanks a lot. Justin.

If you'd still like the speed of a 3000, you can always overclock if you feel confident doing so. Honestly though, the 2800 is fine.

Make sure it comes with real recovery disks-not a partition on the HD, bigger hard drive ( you'll wish for more space in less than 6 months) perhaps the ATI agp card instead of the Geforce-more ram up front-1Gb at least.
