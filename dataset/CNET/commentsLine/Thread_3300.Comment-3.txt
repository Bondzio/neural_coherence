i've read that the x2 perfrom noticeably better than the 8xx series from intel... they also, supposedly, are more future proof.
the computer should work.
hte only thing that might not would be the psu.
i think you need to like change the voltage or something... but almost all psus have those switches... the xeons, i think, are better with the multi-tasksing.
is that two physical processors, each with two different heatsinks or is that dual-core?
also, maybe upgrade the ram, its cheap... -ibrahim
