A friend of mine told me that it might help to go into flash and increase the amount of information websites are allowed to store on the computer ( or disk space). as of now info from websites i visit store o amount of info and websites i haven't yet visited, store around 100 kb, just wanna hear some opinions before i change these setting and end up screwing up my computer lol, thanks for any help

However, you could increase the limit for Flash and see if it makes any difference for you. If it doesn't, then just move it back to the original setting. Flash is a resource hog and many Mac users block Flash content altogether. Internet connection speed also plays a major part in the way video is presented P
