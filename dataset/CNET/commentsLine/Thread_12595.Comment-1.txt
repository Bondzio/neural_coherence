hi all, is there anyone own a hp psc 1610 all-in-one printer/scanner ?
i'v just bought one and to my dissappointment, i think the scanning quality is quite bad.
attached a scanned sample here: [img]  [/img] (if cant view the above pic, goto  ) check out those straight lines in the attached picture, my original drawing is a very clean-cut straightline, very fine but my scanned result is like this.
its the problem with my scanner or setting?
any advise/comment?
thank you regards, sean liewss80@yahoo.com
