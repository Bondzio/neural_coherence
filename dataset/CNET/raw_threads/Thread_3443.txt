Internet --- broadband modem --- router ~ -- ~ computers --- wired ~ -- ~ wired and/or wireless NOTE: You can use the router to network the computers together without connecting it to a broadband modem. You don't have to connect to the router wirelessly, but it is a nice convenience for notebook computers.
