based on early benchmarks, am2 offers 3-4% performance increase over 939, i believe.
i was in the same position as you - looking at a 4200 or 4400 x2, but ended up going with a 170 based on the user reviews.
the main difference?
most chips are produced with a certain (high) level of performance in mind.
towards the end of production, they're 'binned' - they test each one, knowing that there will be variances in performance - out of the same batch of cpus, some will end up being $300 cpus, some will end up 1000 cpus.
opterons are some of the better performing and most sturdy - server-class.
they're selected with the premise that they'll be on, running 100% load, 24/7/365 for years and it's possibly because of this that they oc so incredibly well.
okay, 4200, 4400, opty 170 - difference between the 4200 and the 4400 is the l2 cache - twice the size in the 4400. the optys all have that larger l2 cache, but the clock multiplier is lower.
both the 4200 & 4400 have an 11x multi (core clock x multi = cpu speed, in this case, 200mhz x 11 = 2200mhz = 2.2ghz) the 170 has a 10x multi, the 165 a 9x multi with the same stock 200mhz core clock speed... but they oc well - you can increase that significantly.
i normally run my 170 24/7 at 260 x 10 = 2.6ghz or fx60 speed, although i can run it a little higher.
some people run'em at 280*10, some 300*10, some higher... let's put it this way - if you don't get it to run 260*10, something's not right!
