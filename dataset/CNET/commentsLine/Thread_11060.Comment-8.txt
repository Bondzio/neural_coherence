lee, a couple of years ago i upgraded to a new computer with windows vista.
downloaded new drivers for epson scanner and hp printer.
they worked fine.
however, wacom had discontinued my digital tablet model and no driver was available.
i was forced to buy a new tablet.
it added around $150 to the cost of the upgrade.
annoying, but i got over it.
