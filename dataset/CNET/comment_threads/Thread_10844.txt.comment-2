Question 1 - Why does the Hard Drive need to be partitioned and formatted?
Answer: Because no operating system works with an unpartitioned and unformatted HDD...even if it's only a single HDD with a single partition.
Question 2 - How is partitioning and formatting done?
I read in one particular CNET response, that all you had to do in Windows was to go to &quot;Disk Management&quot; to complete this task, however, I have searched and can not even find &quot;Disk Management&quot; on my computer.
Go to: Start Settings Control Panel Administrative Tools Computer Mgmt Disk Mgmt
