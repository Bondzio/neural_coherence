1.1.1	I just bought this video card: http://www.bfgtech.com/bfgr85256gte.aspx Works great for my purposes, but the fan is way too loud!	St
1.1.2	Can anyone point me to a nice, quiet fan?	St
1.1.3	I'm not sure what I'd be looking for exactly and I could really use someone's help.	Res
1.1.4	Also, I noticed the stock fan can be 'slid' out from the silver Heatsink, so would I need to get a fan that can also 'slide' in?	St
1.1.5	I'm guessing that's not going to be easy to find and that I'll need a completely new heatsink/fan product?	St
1.2.1	Did you look at replacement heatsink and fans at newegg.com and geeks.com?	St
1.2.2	I'm fitting this one on a Nvidia I own -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=A1655	St
1.3.1	I think that's a little over the top in terms of how much cooling I need for the card, no?	St
1.3.2	I was looking for something a little simpler... Also, the current heatsink is &quot;glued&quot; on to the card I guess with some special heat-absorbent glue or something?	St
1.3.3	Would I need to buy that kind of glue?	St
1.4.1	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835119080 Would something like this fit?	St
1.4.2	Are the push-pin locations standard across all VGA cards?	St
1.4.3	Is there a better solution?	St
1.5.1	See if there are others at newegg and the usual places.	St
1.5.2	I chose this one so I don't have to revisit it next year or so.	St
1.5.3	My bet is that even if the fan failed the passive cooling might be enough.	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	Make it fanless.	St
1.6.2	The Accelero S2 provides better cooling than some fan-based stock heatsinks and is zero noise.	St
1.6.3	The only caveat is that your case needs good airflow.	St
1.6.4	And since you're probably going to hang onto the card for a while - what's $8 extra really?	St
1.6.5	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186017	St
1.7.1	That is a good suggestion and ideally I would do that, however, I have a stock Dell E521 machine and I don't think there is enough air-flow in the whole tower for a solution like this to work... but I'm not positive...	St
1.8.1	You need to visit overclocking and/or modding websites to help better with cooling replacements and/or tips/clues.	St
1.8.2	Just google away for possible websites to visit.	St
1.8.3	Once, you find such sites, they explain or direct you to possible fixes, replacements, etc., don't expect too simple a solution as you mentioned you have a glued on heatsink.	St
1.8.4	If you can, simply return the video card and get one that better suits your needs.	St
1.8.5	A quick note, to remove any glued on heatsink, you &quot;freeze&quot; and snap off as the sticking glue may not hold.	St
1.8.6	However, you do this at your own risk.	St
1.8.7	tada -----Willy	St
1.9.1	Shouldn't be a problem.	St
1.9.2	In fact, the cooler will face up so it might even perform better.	St
1.9.3	The only issue I can see on the E521 is clearance between the cooler when installed and the CPU HSF shroud.	St
1.9.4	Dimensions should be up on the Arctic website, so double-check before buying.	St
1.10.1	... and I'm sure you're aware of this, but as far as I'm aware the third-party fan invalidates the BFG lifetime warranty.	St
1.10.2	It's normally not a big deal but just, like, warning you	St
1.11.1	... actually, maybe not.	St
1.11.2	I've realised the PCI backplate for the Accelero wouldn't fit since you have no blanking plates above the GPU slot.	St
1.11.3	Hmmm.	St
1.11.4	What you'll need is an 'over and under' passive cooler.	St
1.11.5	I'll get back to you.	St
1.12.1	Not noisy at all now.	St
1.12.2	But I did have the hacksaw off a small corner since a heatsink on the motherboard was in the same area.	St
1.12.3	This heatsink looks like it will do fine without the fan in this system but we'll see how it runs later.	St
1.12.4	Bob	St
1.13.1	Ah, I see, thanks for the heads up and thanks for looking into this for me.	Polite
1.13.2	I really appreciate it.	Polite
1.13.3	So, maybe a fan-based solution is best after all?	Sug
1.13.4	Let me know...	St
1.13.5	Thanks again!	St
1.14.1	... and also, what are my options to avoid voiding the warranty, if possible?	St
1.15.1	Why isn't this a warranty issue?	St
1.16.1	What do you mean?	St
1.17.1	What do you guys think of this fan?	Ques
1.17.2	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835226018 Is there anything cheaper for around the same noise level?	St
1.18.1	You can't fix it without voiding the warranty so it's back to dealing with the company to fix it.	St
1.18.2	Bob	St
1.19.1	It's the Video card that I just bought which works but has a very loud fan IMO.	St
1.19.2	Others might be able to deal with it, but I find it very high-pitched and irritating after a while, so I would like to replace it with a quieter fan.	St
1.19.3	I don't think it's necessarily 'broken'.	St
1.20.1	It's warranty is over.	St
1.20.2	Is that not worth doing?	St
1.21.1	If any of my previous BFG's are anything to go by, silence is not their game.	St
1.21.2	I don't think they attach their HSF's to any sort of speed control.	St
1.22.1	There's a similarly priced Gigabyte, but all rely on an 80mm fan to move air - the same as your choice.	St
1.22.2	I'm out of ideas for a fanless solution.	St
