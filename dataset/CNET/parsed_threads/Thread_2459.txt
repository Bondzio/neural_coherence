<s> Hi, i've bought a new pc, and it only recognises some of the dvd's I put in the drive. </s>
<s> I have burnt loads of back up dvd's off my laptop, howver lately when I pop them in the drive, the &quot;Autoplay&quot; feature asks if I want to burn anything to them saying &quot;It's a blank DVD disk&quot;.. </s>
<s> ..I put the dvd back into my laptop and it shows the files on the DVD no problem. </s>
<s> Am I going to have send it back? </s>
<s> As you still have warranty for a new machine, that's free. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> i'm afraid i'm going to have to send it back, which is really annoying as I've just got all my software installed on there.. ..bloody computers man, they do my nut in! </s>
<s> Did it do that when NEW? </s>
<s> That is before you installed all your software? </s>
<s> I've completed a recover, and it's still doing it, so it's going back.. ...how annoying that nothing just works nowadays, lol </s>
