i currently have 3 networked pcs in my house.
these are wired using high speed cable internet.
my question is should i consider going wireless with them.
there are no issues with wiring but i am wondering if wireless is faster.
im looking at the d-link di-624 router with d-link airplusxtremeg pci adapter.
will this improve my speed?
would it be worth while?
thanks
