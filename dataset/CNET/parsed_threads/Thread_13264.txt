<s> I have 3 Windows based computers each individually set up as a rack system mounted inside an enclosure. </s>
<s> I haven't updated my computers in close to 5 years so it's time. </s>
<s> I want to update each computer 1 at a time as funds allow. </s>
<s> All 3 computers within rack system, I use mostly for multimedia application from video and graphic editing to music production along with gaming and general everyday office use. </s>
<s> I would like upgrade all my components starting with my first computer including motherboard, graphics cards, sound card, processor, etc. </s>
<s> Based on today's technology, what would you recommend as the ideal components if this computer is going to be used for doing video and graphics editing? </s>
<s> Should I wait until next January when the next generation of processors come out? </s>
<s> Should I opt for for dual processors? </s>
<s> The second rack mounted computer is going to be used for music production. </s>
<s> HOw should I upgrade this computer to get the most bang for the buck? </s>
<s> My third computer is where I dump everything for entertainment and general use including music files, games along with my regular everyday softare like MS Office and email programs which don't take up much space. </s>
<s> I don't want to bog down the other computers with additional software that may drain resources for when I'm working on them. </s>
<s> So what components should I use to upgrade these to. </s>
<s> Each rack mounted computer contains 2-3 hard drives. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance. </s>
<s> In today's technology and for near future (18 mo. </s>
<s> anyways) you should go dual-core. </s>
<s> AMD's Athlon64 X2 4800 is the fastest one out there now. </s>
<s> Graphics is now in the PCIe x16 era and you can use two on same mobo. </s>
<s> Go with 256mb overclocked. </s>
<s> Memory: OCZ seems to top the list here. </s>
<s> SoundBlaster Audigy for sound. </s>
<s> Two SATA drives striped (WD Raptor 74s). </s>
<s> SATA large capacities for music and game and videos and photos and... 21&quot; 1600X1200 high contrast ratio LCD or Flat screen monitor. </s>
<s> Flat screen still give best graphics if you have the room. </s>
<s> Buckle-up and let 'er rip! </s>
<s> I did. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
