firewire port on pc not working properly.pls help.
?i have a dell inspiron with windows xp that is about 4 years old.it has 2 firewire ports (ieee) through which i connect my audio interface.i've never had problem with it so far but yesterday when i connected the interface,i got a light on my interface (hardware) but the pc does not seem to recognize it.i tried using a different firewire interface &amp; the same thing happened.looks like something is going wrong on the firewire port of my pc.my knowledge on computers is not v good,besides the pc is out of warranty.can someone tell me what i should do to get the firewire port working well once again?i tried a new firewire cable &amp; the problem still exists.
