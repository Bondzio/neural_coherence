I went all the way with iMac: 20&quot; screen and 2 gigs of memory.
I read on the Apple site that with matched memory sticks &quot;it will operate with a 128-bit data path&quot; instead of the 64 one DIMM would support.
Sounds good to me.
I look forward to learning the system and putting all that power to use.
Thanks again, Jay
