I can't install neither my webcam nor video camera. A friend of mine says that is may be USB problem which mine are USB 1 and cameras require USB 2. My question is : What is difference between USB 1 and USB 2 ?? is it hardware or software difference?? And how can I solve the problem?? Thanks. Kamran
