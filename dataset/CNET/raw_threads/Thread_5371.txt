(I have heard that they are the pintos of routers) whether this is true or not is up to discussion). A guy at work swears by microsoft routers. My question is this. Do wireless routers degrade over time? I have probably had this one for a year and a half or 2 years and probably did a firmware update about 6 months ago or so. I have noticed that my signal has not been nearly as strong as it was a a couple months ago. I am now connected at around 1mbps or 2, whereas I used to be connected around 18-54. Is it possible that the router has hit its life span and I should do some research on a new one, possibly the Pre-N? Any help would be appreciated. My location of my computer has not changed at all. I am using windows xp, on a 1.8ghz machine.
