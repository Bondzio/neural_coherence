<s> So I own a Dell Inspiron M5010, which came equipped with a 320GB, 5400 RPM Samsung Spinpoint M7 (HM321HI) HDD. </s>
<s> After about 3 months, the HDD became unusable due to a high count of bad sectors (&gt;500). </s>
<s> I've replaced the broken HDD with a brand new, identical HDD which reached a bad sector count of over 250 in ~1 month. </s>
<s> I have then upgraded the HDD to a 500GB, 7200 RPM Samsung Spinpoint M7 (HM500JI); at the moment it has 166 bad sectors in about 2 months of usage. </s>
<s> I did not use the laptop under harsh conditions, it is not filled with dust, it did not suffer mechanical shocks. </s>
<s> What should I be on the lookout for? </s>
<s> The current HDD temperature varries from 42-45 when idling to ~52-54 when playing a video game or using it extensively and the CPU temperature is always above 59 degrees Celsius, even when first booting up the laptop. </s>
<s> Also, the original power supply stopped working after 4 months since I purchased the laptop and I have replaced it with another 90W power supply. </s>
<s> Fun fact: a few (1-8) sectors were being marked as &quot;bad&quot; almost every time the song changed in an Youtube playlist; not always, but most of the time. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Inspiron-Windows-Premium-Battery/dp/B004AMTDAM Why are YOU repairing this thing? </s>
<s> Something is broken. </s>
<s> Let Dell fix it. </s>

<s> Yes, it wasn't even half year old when I had to replace the first HDD. </s>
<s> I was abroad and I didn't have access to any Dell authorized shops therefore I had to replace the HDD myself and I lost the warranty. </s>
<s> By the way, I have the M5010 with an AMD Phenom II Quad-Core P920 CPU. </s>

<s> To check power supply levels the next part to swap is the motherboard. </s>
<s> And a new drive of course. </s>
