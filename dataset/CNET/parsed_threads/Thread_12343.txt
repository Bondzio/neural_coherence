<s> ...but I already formatted my other HD where Windows was once installed. </s>
<s> How do I get it to recognize that it's gone. </s>

<s> In a dual boot environment, these are the choices you get. </s>
<s> What OS are you running? </s>
<s> Some will fail in a reinstall of XP and simply create a dual boot. </s>
<s> Editing the Boot.ini file will solve the problem. </s>

<s> Do you realize how little information you have supplied? </s>
<s> YOu at least have to tell us what OS you are trying to install, and a lot more info about the environment is also needed. </s>
<s> With many OS's you can wipe the drive and repartition it during install, others you need to format the drive, but you give us nothing to go on. </s>
<s> How many hard drives in the system? </s>
<s> Sorry, I have Windows XP Pro. </s>
<s> It was also installed on the other hard drive. </s>
<s> I accidentally installed it there when I was doing a re-install. </s>
<s> I formatted that drive, but it still asks me to choose between the two &quot;Microsoft Windows XP Professional&quot; OS's. </s>
<s> But it's only on my C drive. </s>
<s> The D drive has nothing on it. </s>
<s> Hope this clears up the confusion. </s>
<s> Clint </s>
<s> Physically disconnect the D: drive and install to C:. </s>
<s> When you first get into the XP install have it Delete the partition on C and recreate it (do a Quick format). </s>
<s> With both of those steps you should be able to eliminate the problem. </s>
