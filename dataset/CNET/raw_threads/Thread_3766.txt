My TV is PC/TV compatable. however, do still need the reciever form my Dish Network? i want to get rid of it d/t increase price. also, one tv/pc supports HDMI/VGA/DVI/S-Video (Viewsonic). TV #2 supports RGB Video Output & RS-232 Connector. what cables do i need for each TV? Do i Require the Dish Reciever for the Broadband? i'm so confused. i appreciate your help thx

That's either a dish (to receive satellite) or a DVB-T (terrestial digital signal) antenna. Or your local cable company. Or possibly your ADSL-connection offers digital TV. We don't know, but you can check what's available where you live. For HD (high definition) there might be less options than for SD (standard definition). What do your friends, colleagues and family have? That's a good sign. I'm confused about you mentioning your laptop here. What is it's role? Any receiver or antenna can be coupled directly to a TV.

As for connections to the TV or monitor, it's a different issue. So one thing at a time. I don't know much about at&t broadband but are you getting all you want from at&t on your laptop now..and satisfied with it?

Another way (more expensively) would be doing it wirelessly. A few box comes to mind (Apple tv, slingbox, DSM330 by I/O gear..I think).

AT&T offers U-Verse enabling one to record tv shows,etc, but it's not available here. that would work for me. i could get rid of the Dish. the Dish has many useless channels(i'm on lower end package) and shows the same shows over and over. Ahtoi, i'll check your wireless suggestions, that's what i need. i found one for $295.00 called &quot;InternetVue 2100&quot; by Add logix, but out of my budget at this time, maybe later. does anyone have any knowledge of MSN TV? thx for the f/u ressponse guys. much appreciated.

Verizon's FiOS is like U-Verse tv. Check to see if that's available in your area yet. http://www22.verizon.com/content/FiOSTV/ To tell you the truth, I personally don't think they are that much cheaper than other services (cable/satellite).
