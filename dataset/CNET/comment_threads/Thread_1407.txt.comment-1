Just had a new computer built including a Raptor drive for the OS and programs.
This is very noisy and I have become aware of the level of disc access which is happening even when the computer has been idle for several hours.
The clunking noise from the drive is like a distant drum beat and happens every 1 to 2 seconds.
Is this normal - and if not is there any way of finding out what is causing it?
If it should be happening all the time - any recommendations an enclosure to quieten it which will keep the temperature reasonable - it runs at anything from 32 to 34 degrees at the moment?
