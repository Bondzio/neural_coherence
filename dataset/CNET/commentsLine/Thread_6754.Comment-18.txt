you mentioned going to a coffee shop, refreshing the connections and linking to a secure one.
this is ok if you know the pass code.
by definition, a secure connection disallows anyone who doesn't have right key to encrypt the data being carried in the signal.
now, if your laptop exhibits no problems with connections at other locations but doesn't work with your router, you have a problem with the router, your settings or something environmental that's causing interference with the signal.
unfortunately there's no easy way to know.
it can be a time consuming ordeal.
what i would do if possible is see if you have a friend that has a laptop that could come over and try to connect to your router.
if they have problems, that's good evidence that the issue is in that location.
