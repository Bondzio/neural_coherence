I have an epox EP-9NDA3J Socket 939 AMD Athlon 64 Motherboard that supports SATA and IDE hardrives.
I am purchasing a new hardrive and would like to upgrade to a SATA 80G Drive.
I also have 2 60GB IDE drives, one of which I would like to use in either a raid configuration or to store data.
My questions are these: Will I have any difficulties using both a SATA and IDE drive in a raid configuration?
Will I have any difficulties transfering data from one to the other if I do not use a raid configuration?
Do I need to have two operating systems installed on both drives to use a raid configuration?
What specs should I look for in a SATA hardrive so I notice a difference in speed?
Thanks in advance.
