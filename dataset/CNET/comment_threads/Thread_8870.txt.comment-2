Personally I dont care for gateways that much.
My friend had a couple and I wasnt impressed with the machine given the price.
I recently purchased an HP and have had problems with it as well.
My so called warranty isnt worth anything since my DVD+- died on me and the experts at their India &quot;service center&quot; run me around in circles for hours until I finally have given up.
Heard the same thing about other major brands.
Basically for the money I would go with a Dell/IBM (if they still have em) low cost server and purchase the extras seperately or get a year old workstation with dual processor capability and jack it up.
Since most of the service/call centers have moved overseas I wouldnt put much hope in getting something fixed if it breaks &quot;under warranty&quot;.
Definitely would not purchase an HP but I am sure others have had better experiences.
