1.1.1	Recently added a new (4th) ide drive.	St
1.1.2	After hours of jumper fun, I finally got all drives to show up in Disk Manager.	St
1.1.3	Formatted drives 3 & 4.	St
1.1.4	All healthy.	St
1.1.5	They show up on boot (I have a dual boot, so can see them in the list).	St
1.1.6	Problem is, drives 3 & 4 (F & S) do not show up in My Computer!	St
1.1.7	So I can't access them.	St
1.1.8	Any help would be greatly appreciated!	St
1.1.9	RickyB51	St
1.2.1	What drive letter was assigned to them in Disk Management.	St
1.3.1	F & S. I notice on boot that one says windows, not slave.	St
1.4.1	Click start, run and put in this?	St
1.4.2	F:\ Bob	St
1.5.1	Hmm - error - F:/ refers to location that is unavailable, etc.	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	If you have configurated properly on bios, i.e.	St
1.7.2	master with HD switched to master a.s.o.	St
1.7.3	most probably you have a driver problem.	St
1.7.4	It depends on which chipset has your motherboard.	St
1.7.5	VIA chipsets are really a pain.. because of the poor reliability of it's drivers.	St
1.7.6	So I suggest: Identify the chipset.	St
1.7.7	It is easier if it is a Intel, because Intel provides a utility in order to identify which.	St
1.7.8	If it'is a branded PC, look at the support page and get the chipset from there.	St
1.7.9	Look at the device manager My Computer &gt;&gt; right button&gt;&gt;Properties&gt;&gt;Hardware&gt;Device Manager tab&gt;&gt; look at H disk and check the properties in detail.	St
1.7.10	Which drivers,from whom, details.	St
1.7.11	Microsoft update, if you have selected automatic updates has the nasty behaviour of replace original drivers whith Microsoft's ones, which are all a piece of...	St
1.7.12	So, or roll back or better find the latest either on manufacturer (mobo) support page or at the chipset mfct.	St
1.7.13	web site.	St
1.7.14	If you have an older PC , you should download the last and a previous Windows certificated drivers, because the last ones may not work properly.	St
1.7.15	If everithing goes ok, take note of version, keep a copy of the sys file,and eventually dll's and do not allow windows to change or update automatically : choice must be yours not Microsoft.	St
1.8.1	Before I do anything, here's some info - XP pro, custom built computer, AMD, 2-3 yrs.	St
1.8.2	old.	St
1.8.3	2 boot partitions - office & studio (recording).	Sug
1.8.4	Has always worked fine.	St
1.8.5	Also drive 2 is 2 partitions (for audio) E: & G: ON boot I choose wich partition.	St
1.8.6	The window says - Studio - hdd1-Primary 1-(size) --- Office - hdd1-Primary 2-(size) --- Hard Disk 2 - HDD2 - MBR - (size)512 by - (mode) none Hard Disk 3 - HDD3 - MBR - (size)512 by - (mode) none Windows - HDD3 - Primary 1 (size) 149GB - (mode) auto (this is the old H:, now F: Hard Disk 4 - HDD4 - MBR - (size)512 by - (mode) none (This is new, now S:.	St
1.8.7	Checked drivers for all drives - all are mocrosoft, dated 2001, same version number.	St
1.8.8	All drives - device is working properly.	St
1.8.9	Seems like the Windows drive could be wierd.	St
1.8.10	Does this indicate a jumper issue, again?	St
1.8.11	The windows HDD3 & Drive 4 HDD4 are the ones not showing in My Computer.	St
1.8.12	Thanks for you helps o far!	St
1.8.13	Rick	St
1.9.1	When you replied to my post, you got the command wrong and if you get it right then I may have another idea for you.	St
1.10.1	Got the same error message.	St
1.11.1	Just to clear up your message.	St
1.11.2	Kees	St
1.12.1	When I did RUN F:\.	St
1.12.2	I also did S:\, same result.	St
1.13.1	Now wait for Bob's second idea!	Sug
1.13.2	I can't guess.	St
1.13.3	Kees	St
1.14.1	But are you writing you put RUN F:\ in the run box?	St
1.14.2	I can never be sure.	St
1.14.3	Head to disk management, make it full screen, and take a screen shot.	St
1.14.4	Post it on photobucket.com for us to see.	St
1.14.5	Bob	St
1.15.1	No, I didn't put the word RUN, just - F:\ http://s974.photobucket.com/albums/ae226/RIckyB_photos/ Hope this works.	St
1.16.1	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=XP+HEALTHY+ (UNKNOWN+PARTITION)&aq=f&oq=&aqi= finds this discussed by many others so I'll want more story about these drives.	St
1.16.2	http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555056 and MANY OTHER ARTICLES cover this.	St
1.16.3	More details are needed to discover why these are this way.	St
1.16.4	Bob	St
1.17.1	Is any third party boot manager in play?	St
1.17.2	Some cause this.	St
1.18.1	Boot It was used... Again, all was fine until I took ut my DVD drive (F:) and put in the new hard drive.	St
1.18.2	I see int eh scrn shot that it looks like the new drives are 'hidden', darker blue looks like the studio hidden drive.	St
1.18.3	A I wrong?	St
1.19.1	And do the old drives come back?	St
1.19.2	And is there anything useful on the new drive?	Ques
1.19.3	Can you assign a letter to it (in disk management?)	St
1.19.4	Bob	St
1.20.1	Not sure why remove.	St
1.20.2	The old drives are fine.	St
1.20.3	The new 500GB(4th)dirve is newly formatted, no data.	St
1.20.4	#3 drive (160GB) is also newly formatted.	St
1.20.5	These are the 2 that are dark blue.	St
1.20.6	Letters are assigned, F: & S:	St
1.21.1	If this was me I would have done something like remove the partition, created it and formatted that new drive again in disk management.	St
1.21.2	Your screen shot clearly showed no drive letter assigned to disk 2 or 3.	St
1.21.3	Bob	St
1.22.1	hmm...	St
1.22.2	When I formatted, I DID assign a letter.	St
1.22.3	You're right, now they aren't there.	St
1.22.4	SO, you suggest I redo the process adn see if it works out, correct?	St
1.22.5	Though I won't be able to get ot it today.	St
1.22.6	Thanks, Rick	St
1.23.1	Sort of like lather, rinse, repeat until its in the shape you want.	St
1.23.2	Bob	St
1.24.1	Ha!I will try that & let you know.	Sug
1.24.2	Again, I thank you all so much for your input so far!	Polite
1.24.3	Rick	St
1.25.1	Well, after all of that, the lst idea worked!	St
1.25.2	Something must've gone wrong first time around, so deleted the aprtition and redid.	St
1.25.3	Both drives are now there and accessable!	St
1.25.4	Thanks to all for your kindness.	St
1.25.5	A great relief.	Polite
1.25.6	Rick	St
1.26.1	Man, this frustrating.	St
1.26.2	Reformatted & named the 2 drives F: & H:, they showed up healthy in My computer.	St
1.26.3	I plugged my Ext.	St
1.26.4	dvd drive in a usb port, it showed up as F: and the drives went away again.	St
1.26.5	I reformatted etc.	St
1.26.6	again, named H: & M:.	St
1.26.7	Plugged the dvd drive back in, came up F:, and the drives were there now, so it seemed to be the F: name.	St
1.26.8	Rebooted to my studio partition: Drives gone again.	St
1.26.9	Formatted & healthy, but no name & unknown partition.	St
1.26.10	WTF!	St
1.26.11	Rebooted to my office partition again - same thing.	St
1.26.12	Any ideas, guys?	St
1.26.13	Rick	St
1.27.1	if you use a program norton partition manager you can see all your partition in your machine, maby you have forget hidden they partitions i'm not shure for that but a try does not harm!	St
1.27.2	have nice day ^_^	Polite
1.28.1	Thanks for your reply.	St
1.28.2	They are definitely not hidden.	St
1.28.3	It's something else.	St
1.29.1	Just asking.	St
1.29.2	Why didn't you change that external letter from F:?	St
1.29.3	Also there are some nasties that hide in the autorun of externals.	St
1.29.4	Let's fix or stop that.	Sug
1.29.5	Ready?	St
1.29.6	-&gt; Install http://download.cnet.com/Autorun-Eater/3000-2239_4-10752777.html	St
1.30.1	Well, I guess I'm in fix.	St
1.30.2	I've got calls into some guys for help.	St
1.30.3	See what comes next.	St
1.30.4	Rick	St
1.31.1	Well, about 2 weeks ago I spoe w/ a friend who knows about this stuff, adn found that my problem was that I didn't format the drives as an Extended partition.	St
1.31.2	Once done, everything works great.	St
1.31.3	I knew it would be something that simple, but something I overlooked or didn't know.	St
1.31.4	Now I do!	St
1.31.5	Thanks to all for your responses.	St
1.31.6	Rick	St
