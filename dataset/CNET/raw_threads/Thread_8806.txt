6765	0	209619	2235164	NR	wanness	9/30/06 8:34 AM	1.15960524E12	Memory	I am running a P-IV, 1.6, 512 ram,92GHD's, Win XP Pro and dial up. I just installed a stick of 256 memory, (identical to the first stick) and since doing that, my computer is quite a bit faster, (offline) but when I connect to the web, everything loads so much slower than when I only had 256 ram. Any suggestions? Thanks, Bill
