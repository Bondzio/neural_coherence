well the good news is i was able to install the router with the new inspiron being wired as instructed in the installation cd.
when i connected to linksys to register there was new firmware to be installed which i did download, but then i didn't know how to run it (didn't know which program to use).
unfortunately i lost my powerlink internet connection (which appears to be a reoccuring problem with our cable provider this week in the evening hours) so hopefully tonight i will be able to try connecting wirelessly with the inspiron and then do the installation of the router on the old dell wired.
wish me luck!
