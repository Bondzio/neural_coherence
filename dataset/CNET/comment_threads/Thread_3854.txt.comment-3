I'm a consultant with a home office---if that sheds any light on my preferences.
At present I'm using a Netopia 3546; no complaints.
I want to add 802.11g and dislike having more boxes around than strictly necessary.
Any recommendations?
Not necessarily limited to Netopia ... What I'd REALLY like is a wireless gateway/router with gigabit Ethernet.
Not that my DSL service needs the humongous bandwidth; I'd just like to network my computers at high speed.
