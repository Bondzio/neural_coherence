Remember that we are dealing with a dying machine so we can try everything and anything to avoid the motherboard.
For example I would unplug all CD/HD/DVD drives from the motherboard since we know an IDE short can stop the boot.
Same for ANY PCI or other card.
Remove what we can and get down to just the motherboard, power supply, CPU and heatsink.
If those don't start up and beep in protest for the lack of ram and more then we are looking at the bad parts.
Some &quot;test&quot; the power supply but since the RISE TIME of the voltages can cause odd boot issues I've learned to always swap it out.
