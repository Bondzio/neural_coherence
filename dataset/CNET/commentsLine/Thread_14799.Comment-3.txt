beware of this product!!!
see my review on cnet.
i got two that were defective right out of the box.
i gave up on h-p after wasting many hours of my time, including several hours on the phone with h-p's technical support.
a dvd+rw disk will not play in the typical dvd player.
i have tried it on several myself.
