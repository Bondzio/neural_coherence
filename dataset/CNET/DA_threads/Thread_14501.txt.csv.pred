1.1.1	What are the signs of needing a new DVD R/RW drive Emachines T5026 Pentium 4 3.06 CPU 768 RAM Windows XP Home 160 Hard Drive Basically I have the factory system the same way when I bought it from Best Buy.	St
1.2.1	Are you having any?	St
1.2.2	Feel free to share.	St
1.3.1	If you want one, then get one.	St
1.3.2	If you *need* one, by all means install one.	St
1.3.3	It's really up to you if no problems are present now.	St
1.3.4	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	I don't think I have any problems, my dvds burn and play pretty good.	St
1.4.2	I was just thought that after a year of heavy burning(dvd and cd) the burner would be dead but it seems okay.	St
1.4.3	I did some research on the brand name of the drive-TSST Corp.	St
1.4.4	Which is a joint venture between Toshiba and Samsung.	St
1.4.5	The last firmware upgrade I got maybe fall of 2005, and none since.	St
1.4.6	This is why I think maybe I should get a new burner, because they've stop giving updates, meaning that my burner is outdated.	Sug
1.4.7	Maybe I'm over reacting, I guess if it ain't broke, don't fix it!	St
1.5.1	Even if you got a new DVD burner, it may need an update so don't sweat it if no updates are available for you're current burner.	St
1.5.2	&quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; is alot of common sense.	St
1.5.3	You have the option to replace in the future, cross-fingers good or bad.	St
1.5.4	tada -----Willy	St
