I can do the usual stuff but if I have more than a few windows open, it starts to slow down big time. Here are the stats: Intel&#174; Pentium&#174; 4 at 2.6ghz 256mb DDR RAM Nvidea GeForce FX 5200 and its running XP The CPU is fine, it doesn't use up more than 20% and it almost never even gets to 20%. I don't need to upgrade video cards, I don't really play games and that will be for a different computer. So I'm thinking of upgrading the ram. So my PC runs Dual Channel DDR SDRAM and has four memory connectors. The memory capacities are 128-, 256-, 512-MB or 1-GB. The maximum memory supported is 4gb and the Memory types are PC2700 (333-MHz) or PC3200 (400-MHz) DDR SDRAM (non-ECC) So I was thinking of getting four 1gb sticks. But I never really changed the hardware on my computer. I know that RAM is easy to change because it doesn't store anything 1)but would I have to change anything in the BIOS? 2)would it be a good idea or not, considering the fact that I may be getting a better computer in maybe a year?

As to 4GB, be sure to not expect all that to show up on XP. It's a common complaint that you read 1.9 to 3.5GB reported after this upgrade (varies with the machine) so some feel ripped off. Bob
