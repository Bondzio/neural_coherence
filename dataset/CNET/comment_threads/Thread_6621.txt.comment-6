I'm having same problem.
This problem only happens to new release DVDs.
I have powerDVD and winDVD, and have 3 domputers with 3 different dvd-drives.
However results are same.
I was trying to watch 'Transporter 2' which just came on BlockBuster last week, but it won't play on a computer but my reg.
DVD-Player plays it.
I think it's new copyright stuff or something.
Sucks!
