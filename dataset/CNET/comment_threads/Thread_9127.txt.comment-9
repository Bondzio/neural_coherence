Yea, I got that same problem, loud fan sounds like an air plane is going to take off, I notice this only happens when it's a hot day.
I was thinking if a water cooling system could be installed on a dell 3000, anyone know?
I got a: Dell Dimension 3000 - P4 HT - L2 Cache - 512 MB Of Ram - 80 HDD - 3.00 GHZ
