to replace it with a larger hdd and use the old one as backup.
alternatively you could put some of the data onto cds or dvds and free up some space on the hdd.
another way to think about disk space is 'parking spaces' and 'vehicles'.
the hard disk is like a big parking lot divided up into parking spaces for data, not cars.
but once you park a vehicle in a space (cluster, block, etc.,), even though it doesn't fill the whole parking space.... the remainder of the space is no longer available for another car, regardless of size.
the unused space is sometimes referred to as 'slack space'.
hope this helps.
