So I just email the people at compaq asking what's the maximum size I can upgrade my Harddrive to, and they said maximum is 60GB.
I just bought a 160GB Western Digital HD!!
I haven't opened the package yet, and in the email, compaq peeps said they have not tested harddrives bigger than 60GB.
Do you think I should go ahead and try to install the new hard drive??
They did say my system is compatible with IDE hard drive, which is what I bought.
My pc is a Pentium III 750Mhz, 128Ram, Windows 98 SE.
