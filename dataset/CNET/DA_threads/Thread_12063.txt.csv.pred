1.1.1	I snapped the tab off my network cable today.	St
1.1.2	Just caught it on something the wrong way I guess and POP it came right off.	St
1.1.3	I guess it doesn't happen all the time, but i feel like it happens more than it should.	St
1.1.4	Does anyone know of a good sturdy cable that maybe doesn't have a tab to lock it in?	Ques
1.2.1	I had the same problem, although it happened to me more often.	St
1.2.2	I was pretty rough with my cables and the tabs always popped off in my bag on the way to class.	St
1.2.3	Now I get my network cables from www.tendonusa.com They have a tab protector thing that works really well.	St
1.2.4	They were inexpensive too.	St
1.2.5	Try them out, you won't be sorry.	St
1.3.1	if you goto a big electronics store like bestbuy circut city and maybe fry's electronics, if you live near one, if you look at the network cables they are either bare or have a little rubber shield over the end.	St
1.3.2	there are many out there and just as cheap as bare ones.	St
1.3.3	other solution: tape that suckuh into the socket!	St
1.3.4	good luck	Polite
