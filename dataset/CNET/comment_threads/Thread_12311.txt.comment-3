You could also try the ASUS EP-121 which is a Windows 7 tablet.
I have one that I use both for home and work which provides more versatility and flexibility.
Only disadvantages are its weight of 2.6lbs, battery life of 3.0 - 3.5 hours and of course the price of 1199.00 for the 64gb version which I recommend.
I comes with a leather cover, and Bluetooth keyboard with pen for writing.
