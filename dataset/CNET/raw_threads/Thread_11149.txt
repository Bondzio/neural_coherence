Swerve.	&quot;OS-XP PRO 64 bit&quot; The number of posts pleading for help to get drivers for this OS is amazing. Sorry, but why are you driving towards this brick wall? In closing, it looks ok but I'd like to see 500+ Watt PSU in that list and some idea if gaming is an issue since OS-XP PRO 64 bit would not be a good choice for that. Bob
