I have a 4 year old Compaq Deskpro, Pentium III 660 mhz, with a SMART III Ultra ATA 66 10GB hard drive, which is (not suprisingly) almost full. I am running Windows XP Professional. I would like to extend the life of this computer by adding a hard drive. How do I know what kind to buy, and how to do it. I understand that you have to do something with the BIOS, and I've never done this. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

Shop for an under 120GB hard disk since over that size requires BIOS and more support. Said retail drive will have instructions how to copy your 10GB drive to the new drive and then swap the 120 or less into the boot position. Leave the 10GB drive out and eventually sell it or use it as a bookend. Bob

Seems sensible to go for the larger capacity as there isn't a big difference in price. Is an ATA 100 drive compatible? (Ultra ATA 66 is what is in there at the moment.) Thanks you.

My last 120GB 7200 RPM 8MB Cache WD drive was 69 bucks after rebate so all drives (to me) seem crammed into the 39 to 69 bucks for the sizes you would consider. I don't consider that &quot;a big difference in price.&quot; Bob
