it is not the cable.
if you get a light then the cable is good, the cable only know about electrical voltages.
you need to compare the tcpip settings on the network connection between the one that works and the one that does not.
in general it means that the pc is not being given a ip address by the router or you are using manually assigned addresses and this machine is setup for dhcp.
if both machines are setup the same and use dhcp it is more than likely a router setting.
