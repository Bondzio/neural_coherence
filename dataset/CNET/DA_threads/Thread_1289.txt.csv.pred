1.6.1	Ray , Thank you for taking the time to look at this .	St
1.6.2	I guess I should have researched this better before I purchased it .	St
1.6.3	( Ebay purchase )	St
1.7.1	speakers , because the unit does not have an amplifier built in..	St
1.7.2	The first link that I went to [ $ 190 or so ] said that it came with powered speakers , then saw on other links that you could get it much cheaper without speakers .	St
1.7.3	Did n't know that you bought it through EBay .	St
1.7.4	I 've never even looked there for anything .	St
1.7.5	I figure if I got burned once I would never save enough to make up for it on another purchase .	St
1.7.6	You can get a cheap pair of powered speakers at Wal-Mart for $ 15.00 .	St
1.7.7	With a so called & quot ; woofer & quot ; for $ 25.00 .	St
1.7.8	Hope that things turn out OK , now that you know the solution .	St
1.8.1	Yeah ... DP-U50 is a processor only , no amp .	St
1.8.2	The RP-100 has the built in 30 watt per ch .	St
1.8.3	amp + a tuner ; still only 2 channels ( Virtual Dolby 5.1 .	St
1.8.4	-You can find one for $ 99.- nice price ) .	St
1.8.5	Also , if I 'm not mistaken , you can check out the RP-U200 : 5 channel discrete + a remote .	St
1.8.6	I picked up a pair of the NS-U50 's for $ 17.99 ( new ) last week .	St
1.8.7	They 're O.K with a sub , but my Polk R15 's sound much better .	St
1.8.8	I 'm using the RP-100 , mostly in straight stereo .	St
1.8.9	I got it to use with my G4 Cube which only has USB sound interface- does everything I need & more for not a lot more than a pair of those tinny mac pro speakers .	St
1.8.10	Good luck .	Polite
