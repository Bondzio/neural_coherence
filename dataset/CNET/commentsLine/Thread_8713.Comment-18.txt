i took a look at my 6 mo old dell xps, and the grates in the front are covered with dust.
i am in a newly constructed house, and i am still collecting quite a bit of construction dust in my furnace filters.
if i don't use a vacuum, how can i remove this?
if i use canned air, it will blow it inside the case.
