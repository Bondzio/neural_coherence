<s> Hi all, I have a Mac Pro running dual Quad-Core Intel Xeon processors. </s>
<s> I use two displays, an Apple 30&quot; cinema display and a 27&quot; display, which I use side-by-side. </s>
<s> Recently, my 27&quot; display has been having difficulties that are reminiscent of the special effects used in the Matrix movies when the character is dodging bullets - when moving an open document or window on the 27&quot; display, it suddenly begins leaving a trail of ghost images behind that completely muck up the screen. </s>
<s> Generally, I can correct the problem by grabbing another open document and moving it all over the screen - in effect using it to &quot;wash&quot; away all the duplicate images. </s>
<s> I'm trying to figure out if this is a problem that can be easily corrected (perhaps a memory or cache issue) vs. some sort of fatal hardware or video card issue. </s>
<s> I have a screenshot of this, but I'm a newbie to this forum and unsure if I can easily link it to my post. </s>
<s> I'd be grateful for advice with this problem. </s>
<s> Given the machine story so far can you reveal how long since you did the usual canned air on the heatsinks (maintenence)? </s>
<s> I find many users never do that. </s>

<s> Thanks for your reply, Bob. </s>
<s> I realized that I have four video cards in this machine, so I switched that display to one of the other cards and it seemed to solve the problem. </s>
<s> Regarding the heat sinks, I recently vacuumed out the the entire unit, but prior to doing so, it had accumulated a lot of dust. </s>
<s> Poor maintenance might have overheated my video card prior to the recent cleaning.. </s>
<s> Regards, Jim </s>
