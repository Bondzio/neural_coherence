<s> But today when I started one of the computers there is a message: *** For Realtec RTL8139 (A/B/C) RTL8130 PCI Fast Ethernet Controller Client MAC ADDR: 00 11 09 97 55 33 GUID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 DHCP... (and fast changing symbols \|/-\|/-... that looks like spining) *** After a while the message *** PXE-E53 No boot filename received PXW-M0F Exiting PXW ROM *** apears at the bottom and the same goes again. </s>
<s> If I unplug the network cable it shows a message, informing me that the cable is out. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> It came out, that BIOS has loaded the default settings by itself. </s>
<s> Therefore SATA was disabled and it couldn't find my HDD. </s>
<s> Therefore it was trying to do a network boot etc. </s>
