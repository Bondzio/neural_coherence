1.1.1	Hi everyone - I am hoping I do n't have a unique problem but I feel that I do .	St
1.1.2	Here is my situation .	St
1.1.3	I had been running a Linksys WRT54G as a router on my home network .	St
1.1.4	Included on that network I also was running several Panasonic BL-C130 ( 1 ) Ip cameras so I could keep an eye on things while at work .	St
1.1.5	Well I outgrew the LinkySys , was having some slowness issues so I purchased a new NetGear WNDR 3700 router , great router very fast compared to my LinkSys .	St
1.1.6	So here is where the problem comes in .	St
1.1.7	The Panasonic cameras only support WEP encryption or no encryption which is not really an good option .	St
1.1.8	My NetGear router does not support WEP .	St
1.1.9	So I have been trying to setup both routers on my single internet connection , using the Linksys solely for the cameras .	St
1.1.10	I 've tried chaining the routers together ( internet to the Netgear Internet port - cable from Netgear port to Linksys Internet connection as well as lan port ) , making sure the wireless channels are not overlapping , turning off DHCP on the Linksys , turning off WEP encryption on the Linksys ( again not a good option ) , etc .	St
1.1.11	Still not working .	St
1.1.12	So I am wondering if I am over-thinking this .	St
1.1.13	Can I just take the internet connection from my cable modem , send it through a small switch and then 1 cable to the Netgear internent connection and 1 cable to my Linksys internet connection ? ?	Ques
1.1.14	Essentially running 2 seperate routers/networks off a single cable modem connection .	St
1.1.15	If not , I 've been looking into changing the firmware on the Linksys with DD-Wrt or other similar 3rd party firmware .	St
1.1.16	Thanks in advance for any and all help .	St
1.2.1	http : //www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GDC/WNDR3700V1/WNDR3700_SM_04JUN2010.pdf and about page 38 shows it still does WEP .	St
1.2.2	I own the 3800 and it can do WEP .	St
1.2.3	As to chaining , google this phrase .	St
1.2.4	& quot ; How to use a router as a WAP & quot ; As to your question & quot ; Can I just take the internet connection from my cable modem , send it through a small switch & quot ; the answer is yes but it is costly .	St
1.2.5	The last time someone did that if your cable bill for internet was 50 bucks , the second IP would add 50 a month , and so it .	St
1.2.6	So yes , but you pay !	St
1.2.7	So here we are with your statement & quot ; My NetGear router does not support WEP .	St
1.2.8	& quot ; and the documents disagree .	St
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	Hi Bob , Thanks so much for your reply .	St
1.3.2	Wow , internet bill doubles ? ? ! !	Ques
1.3.3	I wo n't be going that route Also , thank you so much for spotting that in the manual .	St
1.3.4	I read through that document and there are 2 places that WEP is mentioned but still I look at the screen and there is no where that I see WEP .	St
1.3.5	My hunch was that you are right so I investigated futher .	St
1.3.6	So in order to use WEP , which is not mentioned in the document , is the following .	St
1.3.7	I am going through the trouble in case someone else needs to do so .	St
1.3.8	Advanced tab - & gt ; Setup - & gt ; Wireless Setup and under Wireless Network 2.4Ghz change the mode to 'up to 54Mps ' .	St
1.3.9	Once that is done WEP is revealed !	St
1.3.10	So thanks again as you spurred me on into finding this though investigation .	Polite
1.4.1	It 's not that great a speed loss .	St
1.4.2	I 've had to limit some WiFi spots to 802.11g mode and speed and while it is slower , it 's not so bad .	St
1.4.3	That 300 speed is under the best of circumstances .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Hi Bob , Yes , I agree that there is very little difference in the speed .	St
1.5.2	I did a speedtest for reference and the amount was unnoticeable .	St
1.5.3	I did get everything working as well .	St
1.5.4	I renamed the SSID from default to a different one and it started working immediately .	St
1.5.5	So all is good .	Polite
1.5.6	I wanted to thank you again for your interaction .	Polite
1.5.7	Have a good one !	St
