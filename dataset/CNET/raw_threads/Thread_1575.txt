Okay so i am thinking about buying the desktop, but i have heard a lot of mixed reviews on this thing. Some people say that the motherboard is crap, and that it might crap out on me. Some people say that its amazing. Im on the fence on whether or not to get this. Please dont suggest any other desktops. Also, its a refurb.
