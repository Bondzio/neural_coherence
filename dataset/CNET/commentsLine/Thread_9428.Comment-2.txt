two big changes are coming up, imo: new am2 socket, the last socket 939 cpu is already out.
that is coming on 06/06 microsoft vista: the newest windows os in a few years, minus the yearly media centers.
it comes out later this year, but most systems in a few months should work well on vista... soon, companies will start marking systems &quot;vista-ready&quot; but i am very patient.
these are coming in months, not weeks, months.
most higher-endish computer should work good on these systems, but i give no 100% garauntee.(sp?)
i would at least wait for socket am2, as 939 is dying.
not saying current 939 sytems are slow, god no, but they have a limited and slowly dying upgrade path.
