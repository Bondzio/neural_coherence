<s> What is a Simm??????? </s>
<s> I am upgrading this Gateway 2000 computer and it says it has 128 MB of memory. </s>
<s> They are tiny memory chips, and all the slots are filled. </s>
<s> The cover panel of the case has a giant sticker that has instructions on it, and it says that the memory chips are called Simms. </s>
<s> How rare are these, and does anybody know the maximum amount of Ram this machine can hold? </s>
<s> They can provide RAM for most any modern PC. </s>
<s> They're highly recommended. </s>
