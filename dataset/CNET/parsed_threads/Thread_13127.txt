<s> I've scoured for three weeks for a good solution, and if there is one - I missed it. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I am buying two tablets to place on floor stands at an exhibit. </s>
<s> I'd like to design an offline interactive presentation with a home screen (~4 button options), and buttons that link to other pages and back home, all within the same presentation. </s>
<s> It would ideally have an &quot;app-like&quot; appearance and restrict access to other programs. </s>
<s> I've done some very involved presentations this way using PowerPoint action buttons. </s>
<s> Macros/ppsm extensions apparently don't work on ipads or androids. </s>
<s> I can't get a clear answer on Windows RT (some VBA restrictions?). </s>
<s> Perhaps windows 8 convertible could work, but those are a bit salty. </s>
<s> Quick office and office mobile (with 365) were not able to recognize .ppsm extensions though sources said they would. </s>
<s> My understanding is that Keynote and Prezi cannot produce the result that I want. </s>
<s> Kiosk Pro (small cost) seems like it can get the closest to what I need, with guided access turned on. </s>
<s> It restricts me to an iPad (which is fine) but seems to have a steep learning curve which may be an issue with my time constraint. </s>
<s> I was hoping to get something in the $400/ea or less range because they will only be used 30 days per year at exhibits. </s>
<s> Battery life, weight, memory, etc. </s>
<s> aren't a huge concern. </s>
<s> I was actually considering the Slate 21, but android + no battery... it definitely has very little potential to be used outside of the 30 exhibit days. </s>
<s> Suggestions on software and tablet? </s>
<s> I'm a beggar because I can't contribute much to this community. </s>
<s> *grovels* </s>
<s> Some presentation apps in Google store but I don't know if they'd suit. </s>
<s> Dafydd. </s>
<s> We used to do that but today don't bother and just let it run as a presentation. </s>
<s> While we used to worry about this the cost of the custom app was there and we wanted to cut that cost out so for now we're back to simple. </s>
<s> For Android? </s>
<s> Did you try this search? </s>
