<s> Os is not important. </s>
<s> But genrally speaking does laser last longer than inkjet? </s>
<s> And I like epson but not had good luck with any lately. </s>
<s> Somebody said the print heads on epson are not builtin to the cartridge like hp and some others. </s>
<s> Is that true? </s>
<s> And if so does that make it clog or break faster. </s>
<s> Thanks, Confusimo </s>
<s> Might be older. </s>
<s> Look at it this way -----&gt; You change your socks every day, but you never wash your feet, ''what do you think is going to happen''? </s>
<s> The same effect with inkcarts. </s>
<s> While many printers use inkcarts that install new inkjets along with ink, usually tend to last longer or at least less prone to ''ink clogs/crud'', but on an Epson is really a PITA to deal with. </s>
<s> At least with any other printer you can buy a new inkcart and usually proceed foward. </s>
<s> There are trade-offs, Epson makes ''great, wonderful'' output but overtime will become clogged and hard to deal with. </s>
<s> HP and Canon are far better on ink saving costs and less prone to clogs but they do get them, just beware at least as an user you can correct this w/o finally pitching the printer if it was an Epson, IMHO. </s>
<s> Now, for laser printers. </s>
<s> They are simply more robust overall and generally get the job dome with less hassles. </s>
<s> The initial cost of a laser is more but you get more use out of it and if b&w model be happy for a long time. </s>
<s> The cost for color is hard at times, but overall, if you don't need supreme output, it usually suffices. </s>
<s> Try them at a local office outlet to get a feel for them. </s>
<s> beware of cheap or low cost color lasers, the replacement toner cost is high, so pick a ''popular model'' to at least get some saving for toner replacement. </s>
<s> While at the local shop, check out pricing of toner carts as well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> My last printer was an Epson CX6600 and it died shortly after the warranty expired; then no authorized support center available for repair, even if on my dime. </s>
<s> No more Epsons for me. </s>
<s> The problems were probably due to my use habits... </s>
<s> I may go for a month or more without even turning the printer on and this leads to clogs with inkjets. </s>
<s> I started looking for a decent color laser at an affordable price and found a Konica Minolta 2530CL at Sams Club for $249. </s>
<s> I had a group of photos that I had printed with the Epson in an envelope for mailing that I had failed to send out, and I printed the same photos on the color laser. </s>
<s> The color laser produced much better images than the old Epson in my opinion. </s>
<s> The downside, if there is one, is that the printer is shipped with &quot;standard&quot; toner cartridges rated at about 1500 copies b/w. </s>
<s> Both &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;high-capacity&quot; cartridges are available for replacement but the H/C seem to be a little better buy. </s>
<s> If I recall the H/C &quot;pack&quot; is about $349, but sold as 4500 prints @5%. </s>
<s> At least I don't have to be concerned with the printhead drying out and clogging now. </s>
<s> As I said earlier, there are times when I go for long periods without using the printer, but when I need it I expect it to produce. </s>
<s> I have to say it again... </s>
<s> The photos printed on this printer were much much better than I expected, and surpassed my previous inkjets. </s>
