...yes,listen to profitt...borrow someones keyboard,or try one u have.Allways solve a problem by starting with the obvious.If the problem remains,see step two (whatever that is ) I've had similar problems,and a new mouse or keyboard solved it.I just spent hours trying to figure out a mouse pointer glitch...the thing would freeze every 10 seconds or so....it seemed like a software issue...it wasn't....the mouse was bad.
