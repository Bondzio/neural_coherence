1.3.1	While you can put ink into the printer cartridges and seal them , the problem you will run into is the chip that is on the cartridge .	St
1.3.2	The chip needs to be reset .	St
1.3.3	While you can buy the chip resetter , it runs between $ 200- $ 600 .	St
1.3.4	Does n't make it worth it for a home user .	St
1.3.5	There are reset printer cartridges out there for your printer .	St
1.3.6	You just need to look in the right places .	St
1.4.1	I do it .	St
1.4.2	Your printer program will give you a number of low ink warnings and it will eventually ask you to replace the cartridge or if you choose , you may override the safeguards and keep printing .	St
1.4.3	I have n't done it for a while , but you end up depressing one of the buttons on the machine to enable the override .	St
1.4.4	The final prompt will instruct you .	St
1.4.5	Just be careful that you periodically inspect the cartridge levels so you do n't run out and damage the nozzles/print head .	St
