simply put, because you updated the ram, you cannot then assume your system will show that much more available.
as rob stated, the o/s will find a use for the extra ram you've given it.
whether that be for cacheing hard disk data or whatever.
generally, the more ram you have the better, it may not show that in the % being used, but you may find a marked system performance increase because the o/s generally has to rely less on the pagefile or &quot;virtual ram&quot; on your hard disk.
reading and writing to and from physical ram is drmatically faster than to and from the hard disk.
simply put, the more ram you have the more the computer will use because if it goes to the physical ram looking for something and doesn't find it there, it'll look in the &quot;virtual ram&quot; on the hard disk, decreasing the time performance for that function.
the more that can be loaded into the physical ram the better.
