1.1.1	I have a Dell PC that I bought at a closing down sale and only cost $1200.	St
1.1.2	Problem I have is that the digital cable I had to connect it to the monitor (came with pc) does not fit the back of the pc.	St
1.1.3	This cable was already connected to the back of the monitor, and both ends of this cable are identical, and have a symbol that is identical to the symbol on the port on the PC.	St
1.1.4	This symbol is the same as my sisters cable, but in her PC, she has a slightly different port.	St
1.1.5	It's the same as in the back of her monitor.	St
1.1.6	My problem is, even though the symbol is the same, is this a digital cable or not?	St
1.1.7	I can't get the cable to fit it.	St
1.1.8	Thankyou all.	St
1.2.1	See this link -&gt; http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Connector_Digital_Visual_Interface_DVI_Bus.html Harumph!	St
1.2.2	That shows at least four DVI connections and I've seen at least one other with a cross instead of a bar in the C1, C2, C3 and C4 area.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the info, but I found exactly the same thing in my search.	St
1.3.2	Problem is, my connection in the PC is different; I don't have the bar bit.	St
1.3.3	Just three rows across the connection, with one hole missing on the bottom row, 3 from the edge.	St
1.3.4	Still, it has the Digital symbol on face, so it must be a digital connection.	St
1.3.5	Right?	St
1.3.6	I'm confused.	St
1.4.1	As you can tell there are varieties to the DVI connection which can be all analog.	St
1.4.2	To solve this puzzle you have to figure out what video card you have and your monitor's capabilities and get the right cable.	St
1.4.3	However this information is missing so all we can do is look at the issue.	St
