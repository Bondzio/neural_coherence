Out of all the vendors/makers out there, IBM is the most helpful.
They have a support website and provide the details you need.
They really do, check there.
Since laptops vary, I &quot;assume&quot; this maybe one where you lift the kybd.
up by unlatching a 2nd set of locks where you lift the lcd up(when latched), check there.
That's a guess... Next time, give *FULL* details of what your model is.
