1.1.1	I just got a program called speedfan v4.34 , The readings i got are as follow : Fan 1 : 4821 RPM Fan 2 : 0 RPM Fan 3 : 0 RPM Temp 1 : 25C Temp 2 : -55C Temp 3 : 52C HD0 : 35C So um.. is that normal for a PC or is this software just useless .	St
1.1.2	If yes then is there any foolproof way to moniter PC temperature .	St
1.1.3	please explain in details .	Sug
1.1.4	Sorry if posted in wrong section .	St
1.2.1	The author of speedfan also has a support forum if I recall .	St
1.2.2	There are some that will demand it works but keep in mind the price we paid here .	St
1.2.3	Again , take it up with the author and be sure to supply whatever details they ask for .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I do n't dwell too much on monitoring pgms. , speedfan included .	St
1.3.2	I use them during a fix to check results but not on a constant basis monitoring .	St
1.3.3	It can be off and i tend to use them as a suggested rate of observation .	St
1.3.4	Others may say , they get good results , but real measurements can vary from those provided by any such apps. , so take with a grain of salt .	St
1.3.5	On top of all that , proper install of ans , etc .	St
1.3.6	will show at least they 're working .	St
1.3.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	You were not specific in your concerns .	St
1.4.2	The -55C could be a pin that could have a temp sensor but is not used .	St
1.4.3	As to foolproof the old saying is once you make it foolproof only _ools would use it .	St
1.4.4	Good luck , Bob	Polite
1.5.1	some secondary fans do n't support speed monitoring .	Sug
1.5.2	likewise , some motherboards/bioses do n't implement temperature monitoring in a standard fashion .	St
1.5.3	you can configure speedfan to ignore/skip the sensors that are n't producing a reading .	St
1.5.4	if you want a foolproof method , you 'll have to download monitoring software from your motherboard manufacturer and use only PWM fans .	Sug
1.6.1	Well a person on another board told me that no other softwares will give me a more accurate status reading of my PC then my system Bios .	St
1.6.2	accordingly I went into bios setup ( pressing Del twice ) and checked out an option called PC Health Status .	St
1.6.3	It showed.. CPU Temperature : 67C CPU Fan Speed : 4821-4963 RPM System Fan Speed : 0 RPM Now here I have some questions .	St
1.6.4	First is 67C an OK temp for my PC .	St
1.6.5	second what is the difference between CPU Fan and System Fan .	St
1.6.6	I can open my CPU cabinet .	St
1.6.7	Can someone tell me how to identify and check if both CPU and System Fan are there and working .	St
1.6.8	I can see three fans , one on the board ( motherboard ) , second attached to the cabinet which can be seen from the back holes of the cabinet and third i believe in the power supply box inside at the topmost side of the cabinet .	St
1.6.9	Checking with a flashlight , they all seems to be rotating .	St
1.6.10	System Info : Gigabyte 8I845GVMRZ motherboard , intel pentium 4 , chipset i845G , 512 mb ram running windows 2000 pro , and Award Modular Bios v6.00PG	St
1.7.1	That 's on the Intel.com site but 67c is fine .	St
1.8.1	Maybe if you shared if there is an issue with the PC we could break free of this gazing at temps ?	Ques
1.9.1	Well actually there are many problems and I had a feeling it had something to do with fans and PC temperature .	St
1.9.2	First and worst problem is that sometimes when i am running my PC , suddenly in the middle it hangs for sometime and then restarts .	St
1.9.3	On the first screen after restart , Primary Master Disk is not detected .	St
1.9.4	Like this.. Pri .	St
1.9.5	Master Disk : None Pri .	St
1.9.6	Slave Disk : None Sec .	St
1.9.7	Master Disk : None Sec .	St
1.9.8	Slave Disk : None And on the second screen after restart , an error comes up after which i can do nothing but turn off the main power switch of the PC .	St
1.9.9	Error is..	St
1.9.10	Boot From CD/DVD : Disk Boot Failure , Insert System Disk And Press Enter Weather i try to install Norton Ghost 2003 Image which i had earlier created or even to reinstall the whole Windows 2000 pro from its install CD ; error comes up saying that Hard drives are not detected .	St
1.9.11	I have observed this problem mostly occurs when I am installing softwares , running windows update or browsing my picture folders ( thumbnail view ) which contains a lots of pictures .	St
1.10.1	Only now know what the real issues are .	St
1.10.2	You may want to rethink such posts since they rarely get back on track of the real problem .	St
1.10.3	- & gt ; Now that I know this I can share that many i845 boards had bad caps ( see google about BAD CAPS ) and many are old .	St
1.10.4	The old , tired power supply can have the same issue so we know to inspect for the bad caps plus pop in a monster power supply for a test run .	St
1.10.5	We also leave the cover off until we think we 've fixed it .	St
1.10.6	Bob	St
1.11.1	No profit mate , i wanted to know some things about my PC fans as well as the rest of its problems .	St
1.11.2	especially why Bios is stating system fan is at 0 RPM readings .	St
1.11.3	But moving on to my main problem , i will see what google says about i845 boards and BAD CAPS .	St
1.11.4	About power supply box , i had it changed a year back and repaired couple of months back .	St
1.11.5	so its not that old .	St
1.11.6	I did n't understand what you mean by , & quot ; leave the cover off until we think we 've fixed it. & quot ;	St
1.12.1	I mean you should & quot ; leave the cover off until we think we 've fixed it. & quot ; Your choice here .	St
