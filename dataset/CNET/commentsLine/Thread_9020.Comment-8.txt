i went all the way with imac: 20&quot; screen and 2 gigs of memory.
i read on the apple site that with matched memory sticks &quot;it will operate with a 128-bit data path&quot; instead of the 64 one dimm would support.
sounds good to me.
i look forward to learning the system and putting all that power to use.
thanks again, jay
