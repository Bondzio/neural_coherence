for some reason my pc started to run scan disk after a normal shut down.every time i start the computer after a normal shutdown it runs,and it's not the short scan it's the complete scan.the first time it did it i let it run all the way thru but after that i just cancel.i have disabled it but i would like to fix the problem.
any ideas?
im running a 750 athlon with win/me.
thanks
