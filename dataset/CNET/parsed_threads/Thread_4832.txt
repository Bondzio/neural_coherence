<s> Hi, Really hope you guys could help me find some answers. </s>
<s> I've got a 2 month old 320GB Transcend Storejet mobile [one of those drop tested, unopenable ones]. </s>
<s> Was working fine all this while, but I got a new motherboard fixed over the weekend and it stopped working ever since i connected it to the front USB drive. </s>
<s> I got a 'problem with the USB drive error - malfunction - please try reconnecting or change device'. </s>
<s> I tried using it in my laptop, but it does not get recognized anymore. </s>
<s> I can feel the HDD starting and spinning as I connect it, but nothing else happens - the LED blinks for a fraction of a second when i connect it but thats all. </s>
<s> I opened the comp up and found out that the guy had installed my front USBs with the +5V and GND interchanged. </s>
<s> My other USB stuff work fine now, but I really need the data on my disk. </s>
<s> Is there any way I can get it to work? </s>
<s> I'd really like an idea please. </s>

<s> Mine is still under warranty so I'm kinda stuck. </s>
<s> I wouldn't mind opening the casing to get the data but I'm afraid of losing both data and warranty on it... Do manufacturers help get data back if replaced under warranty? </s>
<s> So far, no. </s>
<s> Thanks a bunch anyways. </s>
<s> Any chance that it might show up on Linux? </s>
<s> In Windows, it does not get recognized at all... </s>
<s> Something you should try. </s>
<s> Asking is fine but if you are reading other discussions you know you have to try such things. </s>
<s> -&gt; Bottom line. </s>
<s> Is the data worth the cost of a new case or not? </s>
