8299	0	61866	733390	NR	newbfh	2/1/05 10:18 PM	1.10729628E12	Sony 710UL	I just purchased a sony 710ul I have an HP laptop 2.3 p4 40 gig hard drive. I have an internal 4x burner but I wanted something faster. I have installed the drive but I am not getting any speed faster then what my internal drive was providing. I have updated the firmware from sony's website but I still have the same problems, Any suggestions, is there something I can do to check and make sure my computer has what I need to support the drive?
