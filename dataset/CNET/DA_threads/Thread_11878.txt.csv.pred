1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	I have a new HP Deskjet F4480 that works great.	St
1.4.2	I may find it a slightly more expensive to buy HP ink cartridges but the convenience makes the difference as I buy them on line and HP has them delivered to me the next day in my mailbox or mail service they use.	St
1.5.1	Cheeper	St
1.6.1	I buy Original Ink Cartridges for my HP injet Printer since I don't use it much they last my very long time.I would,nt trust the other ones.	St
1.7.1	2 reasons: #1 - I once purchased a Staples brand re-manufactured cartridge, which then exploded and ruined my printer.	St
1.7.2	My warranty was voided.	St
1.7.3	I never had problem refilling used cartridges though.	St
1.7.4	#2 - I have a staples reward account that gives me $2 + 10% of the purchase price.	St
1.7.5	Combine that with stocking up when there are periodic promotions (mind you- we're talking about buying $50 or more) offering additional Staples rewards, and I have yet to see any re manufactured cartridge or refill kit price beat that.	St
1.7.6	I'm sure other office stores (like Office Max) would have similar savings.	Sug
1.7.7	Bonus info - Staples (and I'm sure Office Max) occasionally have rebates on HP paper where you can get 1 or 2 reams of HP paper and receive a rebate.	St
1.7.8	Your net cost is either $1 per ream or occasionally free for Stapes rewards members.	St
1.7.9	You still need to pay sales tax on the full retail value, though (at least in NY State).	St
1.7.10	Get a staples reward card and sign up for their email alerts.	St
1.8.1	OEM cartridges are very expensive.	St
1.8.2	One full set can cost as much as the printer!	St
1.8.3	I bought some after-market cartridges for about 1/3 the price.	St
1.8.4	No issues with print quality.	St
1.8.5	The only minor inconvenience is that I can get a little ink on my finger when I pull the tape that covers the breathing hole.	St
1.8.6	A worthwhile trade.	St
1.9.1	I've found the two cheapest replacement methods are to either order online from Costco, in which case I've had cartridges arrive the very next day in the mail (!	St
1.9.2	), or drop empties off at Costco's photo desk at the start of a shopping trip, and pick the refills up before checkout.	St
1.9.3	$8 @ is hard to beat.	St
1.10.1	I tried twice to refill a HP inkjet black cartridge and twice it would not work.	St
1.10.2	Now I buy the original, and even then ,the last one had to be sent in for a trade in,as it stopped 1/2 full.	St
1.11.1	I bought a new HP Photosmart Plus printer since the sales person said it had very low ink usage.	St
1.11.2	Wrong!!	St
1.11.3	It goes through ink much faster than my old HP 277.	St
1.11.4	Even worse the cartridges cannot be refilled at the local Walgreens or other places.	St
1.11.5	As others have mentioned, it also uses colored ink when just printing black text.	St
1.11.6	A very nice printer whose strong points are greatly diminished by its use of ink.	St
1.12.1	...mostly because of the high cost of new cartridges.	St
1.12.2	I can get a $40 inkjet cartridge refilled for $10, and the quality is as good as the original manufacturer's cartridge.	St
1.12.3	I do a lot of high-color graphics-intensive work and the print quality is very important, but I find no difference between the new and a refilled cartridge.	St
1.12.4	Sadly though, I may have to move up to a new printer before long, mine is over 10 years old, it's still working great, and I really like it, but it's no longer supported by the manufacturer and I'm afraid supplies for it will soon become extinct.	St
1.13.1	Thx them developing the printer for humans to conveniently print out documents.	St
1.13.2	Third party do nothing and just take the advantage of printer manufacturers, don't you think that's an evil thing ?	Ques
1.14.1	I have used remanufactured cartridges for several years in a Canon MP160 which is now 9 years old.	St
1.14.2	There are two firms offering these in my town, either of which perform very well, except that the ink level reporting does not work as expected.	St
1.14.3	The difference in cost of the ink makes the inconvenience well worth the hassle.	St
1.15.1	on several occasions I've tried used, refurbished, or cheaper ink supplies - always with dissappointment.	St
1.15.2	First the quality of the inks just don't measure up.	St
1.15.3	Second - I've found that without good quality ink the ink jets get clogged or damaged - causing additional $$$ for replacement - thus invalidating any possible savings.	St
1.15.4	So in conclusion - pay the few cents (per print) extra and go with a higher quality product.	St
1.15.5	You'll save yourself money downstream and have a better quality printed document.	Sug
1.16.1	I had an Epson years ago and used aftermarket ink no problem.	St
1.16.2	Two lots of aftermarket and you have saved enough to replace the printer!	St
1.16.3	Current Brother (MFC-215 all in one) collapsed in a screaming heap within hours of first set of aftermarket ink.	St
1.16.4	Went back to original and it works fine again, but over $100 AU for a set of inks hurts, especially when they need replacing every year even if you don't do much printing- watch that daily self test.	St
1.16.5	I also have a HP Deskjet 460 where ink lasts forever because it doesn't self test and lets you print at draft.	St
1.17.1	I have used a succession of inkjet printers from several manufacturers over the past ten years or so and found that third-party cartridges have been, and continue to be, just fine in terms of cost (about a third or less of the OEM equivalent) and the quality is indistinguishable from the originals, as well as capacity.	St
1.17.2	There was a time when it was necessary to strip the chip off the old cartridge and apply to the new, which disabled the ink level readings, but that seems to be a thing of the past.	St
1.17.3	In addition, I have bought these cartridges from different retails (all of them online) and they all gave the same excellent results.	St
1.17.4	In most cases, delivery was next day at no extra charge.	St
1.17.5	If you haven't tried to use these yet, let me reassure you that any risk must be minimal in return for the incredible savings over a relatively short time.	Sug
1.17.6	Although this never happened to me yet, even if a cartidge damaged the printer beyond repair (100% in the case of out-of-warranty situations), the cost of replacing the printer would not be significant if you use normal consumer home printers from virtually any manufacturer.	St
1.17.7	I have used both Epsom and Canon printers, and have no issues with these cartridges when used with the printers.	St
1.18.1	I've had trouble finding remanufactured cartridges, especially if I need them right away.	St
1.18.2	The reman's that I've bought on-line have worked fine.	St
1.18.3	However, I've found it difficult to compare them, and there's also a shipping charge.	St
1.18.4	I don't waste ink(using draft etc.	St
1.18.5	), so I don't need to replace them often.	St
1.19.1	The reason I use OEM inks is because my father-in-law had a Canon BJC-600 (yes, that was a long time ago) and I had one too.	St
1.19.2	He chose to go the cheap route and use aftermarket 3rd party inks and his printer got all messed up and Canon told him that using those inks would cause problems.	St
1.19.3	I never had a problem with my BJC-600, so I stuck with the OEM inks.	St
1.19.4	Luckily Canon was very gracious and refurbished his printer.	St
1.19.5	I just don't want to go through the aggravation (and my luck would probably not be as good as my father-in-laws as far as getting my printer fixed for free).	St
1.19.6	That's my 10 cents worth... Dennis	St
1.20.1	I/we use 5 Epson IJ printers and 1 HP all in one.	St
1.20.2	All the Epsons have Continuous Ink Supplies and I purchase ink in bulk.	St
1.20.3	It's relatively cheap.	St
1.20.4	The HP doesn't have a CIS and it is expensive.	St
1.20.5	Printer breaks, buy a new one, they are cheap.	St
1.20.6	The Epson C88+ costs around $80.00 on sale and a new set of inks almost that much from Epson, so buy a new printer when the inks in the new one runs out.	St
1.20.7	BTW, the printer tells you the ink is gone long before it really is in order to encourage you to purchase more.	St
1.20.8	Thought Epson was sued and lost over that Marketing ploy.	St
1.20.9	Naughty naughty Epson.	St
1.20.10	Buy someone elses ink!	St
1.20.11	!	St
1.21.1	I tried Cartridge World (where I traded in my original HP cartridge for whatever refilled one they had already filled).	St
1.21.2	Not one page printed.	St
1.21.3	Tried the refill station at Office Max (where they took my cartridge and supposedly refilled it), but again not one page printed.	St
1.21.4	I DID get monetary refunds, but wasted too much time and gas and ended up buying new HP cartridge.	St
1.21.5	I tested the waters again at Office Max, buying a refilled cartridge that DID work fine: however, $$ savings were just $3 off buying new.	St
1.22.1	After reading the other posts about printer failure with refills, I realized my own printer's demise MIGHT have been connected with using the refill??	St
1.22.2	I had assumed it was just &quot;Old age&quot;, but there was abundant ink slime near cartridge idle position---exactly where the mechanical failure occurred.	St
1.23.1	Previously had a Cannon &amp; tried a DIY refil kit and the print head blocked up - no ammount of flushing owuld clear it &amp; eventually had to scrap the printer - hence the switch to HP I have used HP printers for the past 10 years, now on my 3rd &quot;all in one&quot;.	St
1.23.2	I use remanufactured ink cartridges as Hp are so expensive and seem to be half empty!	St
1.23.3	I'm happy to do this as the print head is in the ink cartridge and if it gets blocked I just replace it.	St
1.23.4	Beware as not all remanufactured units are the same - I've had instances of units not working or pertially blocked.	St
1.24.1	I use the original mfr cartridges because they are what I can find.	St
1.24.2	I did use a refill kit on a previous printer but it doesn't work on my current cartridges and I had an ink leakage problem once too.	St
1.24.3	So any way using the original mfr cartridges always works.	St
1.25.1	I have been using 4inkjets online now for 3 years.	St
1.25.2	They have never once let me down.	St
1.25.3	I receive my print cartridges in a few days along with a prepaid envelope to drop my old ones in the mail.	St
1.25.4	I get the remanufactured lexmark catridges (high yield) and they last me just about as long as the originals did.	St
1.25.5	I don't normally review online companies, but this one has earned my loyalty.	St
1.25.6	I actually switched to another online company (TFP International) just to try because their cartridges were a little cheaper.	St
1.25.7	BIG mistake.	St
1.25.8	See the thread on TFP International on CNET.	St
1.25.9	Anyway, that's my personal consumer story and I have been very happy with the remanufactured cartridges.	St
1.25.10	The trick is finding the right company.	St
1.25.11	I ruined a previous printer I had trying to refill my own cartridges.	St
1.25.12	All was well for about 4 months and then the cartridge leaked all over my printer and ruined it.	St
1.25.13	PS; Love my Lexmark Printer and will never buy another brand again.	St
1.26.1	In the old days, HP was OK.	St
1.26.2	Sine their 4000-series, quality (of especially software y W-Fi) went so low that I had to move to Canon, which is great.	St
1.26.3	An old Brother or HP laser do a good job for general printing.	Ques
1.27.1	I hate the printer I own.	St
1.27.2	At work, we just get our cartridges refilled by Cartridge World (super cheap, and eco-friendly).	St
1.27.3	The one I have at home is a Dell printer, the kind that refuse to print unless the built in page counter isn't at 0.	St
1.27.4	So, unless I buy new ones, the ones from Cartridge World refuse to print, because the stupid printer thinks that the cartridge is empty.	St
1.27.5	I wish printers could tell the difference between refilled and brand new.	St
1.28.1	NIL	St
1.29.1	Have you ever been to a reputable place to get your cartridges refilled?	St
1.29.2	I've gone to Cartridge World to get new ink for the printer where I work-we haven't bought a new cartridge for the past 5 years (SUPER CHEAP)!	St
1.29.3	Your lucky to have HP.	Polite
1.29.4	Dell printers (my home printer is Dell) refuse to work with refilled cartridges.	St
1.30.1	I was also dismayed at the rip off prices for OEM ink cartridges and have used after market refills for years with rarely a problem.	St
1.30.2	I do clean my HP-950 all in one every couple of years.	St
1.30.3	Only issues I have had is when a cartridge does fail and just mail it back with the provided mailer and they give me a new one.	St
1.30.4	No questions or hassle from them.	Ques
1.30.5	I do shop where I get a 1 year warranty on the failure of the cartridge.	St
1.30.6	I have only had 2 fail over 12 years out of maybe 25 or so cartridges.	St
1.30.7	I figure the money I have saved over buying OEM I can buy many new printers when this one does finally die.	St
1.30.8	As for cleaning I do clean the contacts inside the printer with a coffee filter ever time I change a cartridge.	St
1.30.9	When I remove the cartrdiges a do a thorough cleaning I do take the tope off with a torque driver and get easier access to the guts to clean with damp paper towels.	St
1.30.10	I do wear vinyl gloves.	St
1.30.11	I also turn off the printer anytime its not being used which I was told is the safest park position.	St
1.30.12	This has worked well for me so I feel no need to tweak what is working well.	St
1.31.1	Dell printers will refuse to print with refilled ones because the page counter thing can't be reset.	St
1.31.2	Have you ever read this?	St
1.31.3	: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/printers It has some foul language, but it really expresses why printers are one of the worst inventions of all times!	St
1.32.1	I have a fairly old Epson 800 which consumes enormous amounts of ink,about 100 every time for a complete refill, so I used generic ink capsules once and never again - they blocked all the inkjets and it took me a week to clean the darned thing.Also the Epson ink gives better quality photographs which is important to me.	St
1.33.1	It all depends on the printer.	St
1.33.2	I can't always find replacement ink or toner to refill with.	St
1.33.3	I've been refilling since it was called re-inking (ribbons).	St
1.33.4	I just went with inksupply dot com because they had empty carts &amp; the ink needed for one of my inkjets.	St
1.33.5	For my laser (KM 1600w), I can't find refill toner.	St
1.33.6	I figure that if the refill companies aren't selling the toner itself, than it's not going to be as good as the original stuff.	St
1.33.7	My old HP printer has always been hard to refill, but it can be done.	St
1.33.8	I use that for greeting cards &amp; things I don't care about replicating the artwork precisely on.	St
1.33.9	I've used cart doc &amp; all of those companies for the chintzy printers at work &amp; they seem fine (enough for reports &amp; e-mails).	St
1.34.1	I started out refilling my own cartridges and found that to be the cheapest by far.	St
1.34.2	Then Canon did their chip thing and refilling got too complex.	St
1.34.3	I use LD Products for Canon carts and have not had a bad experience in over a year (4 orders).	St
1.34.4	For an MX860, the carts run $5-7, less if you buy more of each.	St
1.34.5	They are at http://www.ldproducts.com/ .	St
1.35.1	I have tried remanufactured cartridges but originals produce a far better results when printing photographs.	St
1.36.1	I have a Canon, an HP Photosmart 6150 and HP Officejet Pro 8500 and I use re-manufactured cartridges in all of them with 99% satisfaction.	St
1.36.2	The 1% refers to when I print photos from my 6150 (seldom) and I use HP cartridges because occasionally the re-mfg.	St
1.36.3	cartridges color may be off a wee bit.	St
1.36.4	For everyday use though they are great and I've NEVER had a problem or malfunction.	St
1.36.5	The economy factor is my first objective and they do save a lot of money for our home office.	St
1.36.6	With these cartridges I can print cheaper than with my laser color printer.	St
1.36.7	I did search around for suppliers before I selected the one I use now.	St
1.36.8	Some products were not as reliable so caveat emptor.	St
1.36.9	I'm not shilling for the one I've used for 4-5 yrs but will recommend them if you ask.	St
1.36.10	Toddney	St
1.37.1	I live in Langley B.C.	St
1.37.2	Canada, use an HP Photosmart C5280.	St
1.37.3	I've used SAVE ON CARTRIDGE in downtown Langley (Fraser Highway) to refill my cartridges for years.	St
1.37.4	Andy is straight up enough to test each refill - if it's not up to doing a good job he'll tell the customer &amp; let them make the decision.	St
1.37.5	Highly recommended.	St
1.37.6	TED	St
1.38.1	I have tried using clones and refills ftom Costco, Walgreens and online and 95% of the time they will not work.	St
1.38.2	It is not worth the aggravation and I have decided to use only originals.	St
1.38.3	I have just switched to a Kodak E3250 that claims to use less ink.	St
1.38.4	Jury still out.	St
1.39.1	I have been using an HP Office jet Pro k550 for several years and refill my own cartridges.	St
1.39.2	I buy the ink on-line in pints.	St
1.39.3	The cartridges have a date incoded to prevent refill beyond that date but I override it in two ways: 1, If the printer prints a part of a page and stops, Pull out the cartridge with the flashing light above it and put it back, this will usually allow continued printing.	St
1.39.4	2.	St
1.39.5	If printer stops and the yellow &quot;resume&quot; light is on and you get a message regarding cartridge date, press and hold the &quot;power&quot; button while pressing the &quot;resume&quot; button 3 times.	St
1.39.6	This resets the cartridge date.	St
1.40.1	CNet had a glitch, I could not fill in text.	St
1.40.2	BUT I have refurbed HP laserjet 4+.	St
1.40.3	Online I got refill stuff, I get 1400 pages laser quality b/w prints for about $10 toner.	St
1.40.4	initial outlay for cartridges, but I had them already, and for the cutter tool, but that was trivial.	St
1.40.5	A site will provide lesser cost cartridges for this &quot;obsolete&quot; printer.	St
1.41.1	I get great quality photo printing on my Epson.	St
1.41.2	Save time and money too!	St
1.42.1	I am using the same lexmark printer for the last 10 years..the company has been cooperative for any problems (very few) but the ink seems to just flow away.	St
1.42.2	I have tried to get the refills but the printer will not read them as filled , so will not print...there is no reason for the high cost of these inkjets but because the printer is so inexpensive and did not need to be replaced and considering the long time of use, I think I'm about even..and I know that lexmark has to make money somehow.	St
1.42.3	msfig	St
1.43.1	I use HP45 and HP78 cartridges in my 9 year old Photosmart 1115.	St
1.43.2	Walgreens was unsuccessful in refilling my cartridges but I stumbled upon ocinkjet.com.	St
1.43.3	I was hesitant, too, about what to expect but I have had excellent results with their product.	St
1.43.4	I even had the cartridges for a little over a year before I installed them in my printer, but they fired right up and have been working fine for the past few months that they've been installed.	St
1.43.5	I do not print photos on my printer so maybe they wouldn't be as vibrant as OEM cartridges, but for my purposes they meet or exceed my expectations and I can't see any difference in my text or drawings.	St
1.43.6	For about 1/3 or 1/4 the cost of OEM cartridges I'm totally convinced this is the way to go (for me).	St
1.44.1	I use Kodak larger size economy ink refills.	St
1.44.2	I have owned every major brand: Multiple Epsons, Canon, Brother, and although I LOVED my Epson, who can afford OEM cartridges?	St
1.44.3	I did not get a good result with the remans.	St
1.44.4	Now I love my Kodak...	St
1.44.5	It was a Christmas gift 2 years ago....	St
1.44.6	I got rid of a BRAND NEW EPSON.	St
1.44.7	I love love love the Kodak because it does EXACTLY what they say it does and so does the INK Go Kodak!!!	St
1.44.8	!	St
1.45.1	I have had problems in the past using non OEM ink in printers and I just cant get myself to use them again.	St
1.45.2	I find if I look for bargains ahead of time on E-Bay, Amazon, New Egg and others I will get originals with good chips at about 1/2 the price.	St
1.45.3	You just have to spend some time and stock up a little when a bargain comes around.	St
1.46.1	I use HP cartridges because I am very particular with my finished work, which is largely photography.HPOffice Jet Pro l7580 does beautiful work.	St
1.46.2	However, I usually print to PDF files.	St
1.46.3	When a hard copy is definitely needed, I print from the PDF file.	St
1.46.4	Often those perfect copies live in the pdf format and never do get printed.	St
1.46.5	From Acrobat they are easy to view, find, or email, using the Organizer in the Acrobat Professional program.	St
1.46.6	(They can be viewed perfectly without opening the file).	St
1.46.7	So then my answer in keeping ink costs down is &quot;don't print so much!&quot; Or be prudent in what is actually needed in hard copy.	St
1.46.8	Previously I had an Epson, which I ruined using refilled cartridges which leaked.	St
1.46.9	I believe there is a big difference in refill service, even when done by the same franchise brand name.	St
1.46.10	Some of these answers are very useful, however.	St
1.47.1	Have an HP all in one printer and have read many post on refilled and such ink cartridges and fell it is better to stay with HP original ink cartridges.	St
1.48.1	NIL	St
1.49.1	Ive found that I they last a long time and the quality is high.	St
1.49.2	I used after market and they jammed about halfway through a cartridge.	St
1.49.3	They last a long time, and the print quality is also superior.	St
1.49.4	I generally get them for 10 bucks delivered by mail.	St
1.49.5	The color last me about 7 months per set and I go through a black one every couple of months.	St
1.49.6	My printer is an all in one that is a few years old, but is somewhat slow but good quality.	St
1.49.7	Ive also found the cheap printers suck ink as a general rule.	St
1.50.1	There are lots of ink choices, and though, originals can produce better results, remanufactured inks and toners can save you a lot on printing costs as well as help save the environment.	St
1.50.2	Sites like http://www.inkjetsuperstore.com/lexmark-18Y0143-oem-inkjet-cartridge_2 can provide some of the best options for printing needs whether you are using inkjet or laser.	St
1.51.1	My family has three inkjet printers: two Canon MP600-series (they use the same cartridges) and an older HP Photosmart 2610.	St
1.51.2	We also live in a small town where just about the only stores that carry printer supplies are Walmart and Radio Shack.	St
1.51.3	We generally don't do a lot of printing, so even one printer wouldn't get all that much use; the three printers are more for convenience's sake than anything else.	St
1.51.4	If we did a lot of printing, I'd seriously consider a less expensive ink option; but since we don't go through a lot of ink, and because local purchase options are so limited, I just buy the manufacturers' ink and keep only one spare of each cartridge on hand.	St
1.51.5	Years ago I used both house-brand and refilled cartridges, and even bought a few refill kits.	St
1.51.6	(Before that, I re-inked my dot-matrix ribbons.)	St
1.51.7	Most of the time the cartridges worked just fine, although the print quality wasn't quite equal to what I got with the manufacturer's cartridges.	St
1.51.8	But I did have a few cartridges that leaked, and two others that (I think) clogged the print heads of my HP printers.	St
1.51.9	I'm sure quality has improved since those days, and I'd consider using either refilled or third-party ink cartridges again if I did that much printing.	St
